</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xterm - terminal emulator for X

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xterm</b> [-<u>toolkitoption</u> ...] [-<u>option</u> ...] [<u>shell</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>xterm</u> program is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102/VT220 and
       selected features from higher-level terminals such as VT320/VT420/VT520 (VT<u>xxx</u>).  It also provides
       Tektronix 4014 emulation for programs that cannot use the window system directly.  If the underlying
       operating system supports terminal resizing capabilities (for example, the SIGWINCH signal in systems
       derived from 4.3BSD), <u>xterm</u> will use the facilities to notify programs running in the window whenever it
       is resized.

       The VT<u>xxx</u> and Tektronix 4014 terminals each have their own window so that you can edit text in one and
       look at graphics in the other at the same time.  To maintain the correct aspect ratio (height/width),
       Tektronix graphics will be restricted to the largest box with a 4014's aspect ratio that will fit in the
       window.  This box is located in the upper left area of the window.

       Although both windows may be displayed at the same time, one of them is considered the “active” window
       for receiving keyboard input and terminal output.  This is the window that contains the text cursor.  The
       active window can be chosen through escape sequences, the <b>VT</b> <b>Options</b> menu in the VT<u>xxx</u> window, and the
       <b>Tek</b> <b>Options</b> menu in the 4014 window.

</pre><h4><b>EMULATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xterm</u> provides usable emulations of related DEC terminals:

       •   VT52 emulation is complete.

       •   VT102  emulation  is  fairly complete, but does not support autorepeat (because that would affect the
           keyboard used by other X clients).

           Double-size characters are displayed properly if your font server supports scalable bitmap fonts.

       •   VT220 emulation does not support soft fonts, it is otherwise complete.

       •   VT420 emulation (the default) supports controls for manipulating rectangles of characters as well  as
           left/right margins.

           <u>Xterm</u> does not support some other features which are not suitable for emulation, e.g., two-sessions.

       Terminal database (<u>terminfo</u> (5) or <u>termcap</u> (5)) entries that work with <u>xterm</u> include

              an optional platform-specific entry (“xterm”),
              “xterm”,
              “vt102”,
              “vt100”,
              “ansi” and
              “dumb”

       <u>Xterm</u>  automatically  searches  the  terminal  database in this order for these entries and then sets the
       “TERM” variable (and the “TERMCAP” environment variable on a few older systems).  The alternatives  after
       “xterm” are very old, from the late 1980s.

       VT100  and  VT102  emulations  are  commonly  equated,  though  they actually differ.  The VT102 provided
       controls for inserting and deleting lines.

       Similarly, “ansi” and “vt100” are often equated.  These are not really the same.  For instance, they  use
       different  controls for scrolling (but <u>xterm</u> supports both).  These features differ in an “ansi” terminal
       description from <u>xterm</u>:

       <b>acsc</b>
               Pseudo-graphics (line-drawing) uses a different mapping.

       <b>xenl</b>
               <u>Xterm</u> wraps text at the right margin using the VT100 “newline glitch” behavior.

       Because of the wrapping behavior, you would occasionally have to repaint the screen  when  using  a  text
       editor with the “ansi” description.

       You  may  also  use  descriptions  corresponding  to  the various supported emulations such as “vt220” or
       “vt420”, but should set the terminal emulation level with the <b>decTerminalID</b> resource.

       On most systems, <u>xterm</u> will use the terminfo database.  Some older systems use termcap.   (The  “TERMCAP”
       environment  variable  is  not  set  if  <u>xterm</u>  is linked against a terminfo library, since the requisite
       information is not provided by the termcap emulation of terminfo libraries).

       Many of the special <u>xterm</u> features may be  modified  under  program  control  through  a  set  of  escape
       sequences different from the standard VT<u>xxx</u> escape sequences (see <u>Xterm</u> <u>Control</u> <u>Sequences</u>).

       The  Tektronix 4014 emulation is also fairly good.  It supports 12-bit graphics addressing, scaled to the
       window size.  Four different font sizes and five different lines types are supported.  There is no write-
       through or defocused mode support.  The Tektronix text and graphics commands are recorded  internally  by
       <u>xterm</u>  and  may  be written to a file by sending the COPY escape sequence (or through the <b>Tektronix</b> menu;
       see below).  The name of the file will be

           “COPY<u>yyyy</u>-<u>MM</u>-<u>dd</u>.<u>hh</u>:<u>mm</u>:<u>ss</u>”

       where <u>yyyy</u>, <u>MM</u>, <u>dd</u>, <u>hh</u>, <u>mm</u> and <u>ss</u> are the year, month, day, hour, minute and second  when  the  COPY  was
       performed  (the  file  is created in the directory <u>xterm</u> is started in, or the home directory for a login
       <u>xterm</u>).

       Not all of the features described in this manual are necessarily available  in  this  version  of  <u>xterm</u>.
       Some  (e.g.,  the  non-VT220  extensions)  are  available  only if they were compiled in, though the most
       commonly-used are in the default configuration.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xterm</u> automatically highlights the text  cursor  when  the  pointer  enters  the  window  (selected)  and
       unhighlights it when the pointer leaves the window (unselected).  If the window is the focus window, then
       the text cursor is highlighted no matter where the pointer is.

       In VT<u>xxx</u> mode, there are escape sequences to activate and deactivate an alternate screen buffer, which is
       the  same  size  as  the  display  area  of  the window.  When activated, the current screen is saved and
       replaced with the alternate screen.  Saving of lines scrolled off the top of the window is disabled until
       the normal screen is restored.  The usual terminal description for <u>xterm</u> allows the visual  editor  <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1)
       to  switch  to  the  alternate  screen for editing and to restore the screen on exit.  A popup menu entry
       makes it simple to switch between the normal and alternate screens for cut and paste.

       In either VT<u>xxx</u> or Tektronix mode, there are  escape  sequences  to  change  the  name  of  the  windows.
       Additionally, in VT<u>xxx</u> mode, <u>xterm</u> implements the window-manipulation control sequences from <u>dtterm</u>, such
       as resizing the window, setting its location on the screen.

       <u>Xterm</u>  allows  character-based  applications  to receive mouse events (currently button-press and release
       events, and button-motion events) as  keyboard  control  sequences.   See  <u>Xterm</u>  <u>Control</u>  <u>Sequences</u>  for
       details.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Because  <u>xterm</u> uses the <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> library, it accepts the standard <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> command line options.  <u>Xterm</u>
       also accepts many application-specific options.

       By convention, if an option begins with a “<b>+</b>” instead of a “<b>-</b>”, the option is  restored  to  its  default
       value.

       Most of the <u>xterm</u> options are actually parsed by the <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u>, which sets resource values, and overrides
       corresponding  resource-settings  in your X resource files.  <u>Xterm</u> provides the <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> with a table of
       options.  A few of these are marked, telling the <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> to ignore them (<b>-help</b>, <b>-version</b>,  <b>-class</b>,  <b>-e</b>,
       and  <b>-into</b>).   After  the  <u>X</u>  <u>Toolkit</u>  has  parsed the command-line parameters, it removes those which it
       handles, leaving the specially-marked parameters for <u>xterm</u> to handle.

       These options do not set a resource value, and are handled specially:

       <b>-version</b>
               This causes <u>xterm</u> to print a version number to the standard output, and then exit.

       <b>-help</b>   This causes <u>xterm</u> to print out a verbose message describing  its  options,  one  per  line.   The
               message  is  written  to  the  standard  output.  After printing the message, <u>xterm</u> exits.  <u>Xterm</u>
               generates this message, sorting it and noting whether  a  “<b>-</b><u>option</u>”  or  a  “<b>+</b><u>option</u>”  turns  the
               feature  on or off, since some features historically have been one or the other.  <u>Xterm</u> generates
               a concise help message (multiple options per line) when an unknown option is used, e.g.,

                   xterm -z

               If the logic for a particular option such as logging is not compiled into <u>xterm</u>,  the  help  text
               for that option also is not displayed by the <b>-help</b> option.

       The  <b>-version</b> and <b>-help</b> options are interpreted even if <u>xterm</u> cannot open the display, and are useful for
       testing and configuration scripts.  Along with <b>-class</b>, they are checked  before  other  options.   To  do
       this,  <u>xterm</u>  has  its own (much simpler) argument parser, along with a table of the <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u>'s built-in
       list of options.

       Relying upon the <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> to parse the options and associated values has the  advantages  of  simplicity
       and good integration with the X resource mechanism.  There are a few drawbacks

       •   <u>Xterm</u>  cannot  tell  easily  whether  a  resource  value  was set by one of the external resource- or
           application-defaults files, whether it was set using <b><a href="../man1/xrdb.1.html">xrdb</a></b>(1), or if  it  was  set  through  the  <b>-xrm</b>
           option  or  via  some directly relevant command-line option.  <u>Xterm</u> sees only the end-result: a value
           supplied when creating its widgets.

       •   <u>Xterm</u> does not know the order in which particular options and items in resource files are  evaluated.
           Rather,  it  sees  all  of  the  values  for a given widget at the same time.  In the design of these
           options, some are deemed more important, and can override other options.

           The <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> uses patterns (constants and wildcards) to match resources.  Once a particular  pattern
           has  been  used, it will not modify it.  To override a given setting, a more-specific pattern must be
           used, e.g., replacing “*” with “.”.  Some poorly-designed resource files are too  specific  to  allow
           the command-line options to affect the relevant widget values.

       •   In  a  few  cases,  the  <u>X</u>  <u>Toolkit</u> combines its standard options in ways which do not work well with
           <u>xterm</u>.  This happens with the color (<b>-fg</b>, <b>-bg</b>) and reverse (<b>-rv</b>) options.  <u>Xterm</u> makes a special case
           of these and adjusts its sense of “reverse” to lessen user surprise.

       One parameter (after all options) may be given.  That overrides <u>xterm</u>'s built-in choice of shell program:

       •   If the parameter is not a relative path, i.e., beginning with “./” or “../”, <u>xterm</u> looks for the file
           in the user's PATH.  In either case, this check fails if <u>xterm</u> cannot construct an absolute path.

       •   If that check fails (or if no such parameter is given), <u>xterm</u> next checks the “SHELL”  variable.   If
           that  specifies  an  executable  file, <u>xterm</u> will attempt to start that.  However, <u>xterm</u> additionally
           checks if it is a valid shell, and will unset “SHELL” if it is not.

       •   If “SHELL” is not set to an executable file, <u>xterm</u> tries to use the shell program  specified  in  the
           user's password file entry.  As before, <u>xterm</u> verifies if this is a valid shell.

       •   Finally, if the password file entry does not specify a valid shell, <u>xterm</u> uses <u><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></u>.

       The <b>-e</b> option cannot be used with this parameter since it uses all parameters following the option.

       <u>Xterm</u>  validates  shell  programs  by finding their pathname in the text file <b><a href="file:/etc/shells">/etc/shells</a></b>.  It treats the
       environment variable “SHELL” specially because (like “TERM”), <u>xterm</u> both reads and updates the  variable,
       and because the program started by <u>xterm</u> is not necessarily a shell.

       The  other  options  are  used  to  control the appearance and behavior.  Not all options are necessarily
       configured into your copy of <u>xterm</u>:

       <b>-132</b>    Normally, the VT102 DECCOLM escape sequence that switches between  80  and  132  column  mode  is
               ignored.   This  option causes the DECCOLM escape sequence to be recognized, and the <u>xterm</u> window
               will resize appropriately.

       <b>-ah</b>     This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should always highlight the text cursor.  By default, <u>xterm</u> will
               display a hollow text cursor whenever the focus is lost or the pointer leaves the window.

       <b>+ah</b>     This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should do text cursor highlighting based on focus.

       <b>-ai</b>     This option disables active icon support if that  feature  was  compiled  into  <u>xterm</u>.   This  is
               equivalent to setting the <u>vt100</u> resource <b>activeIcon</b> to “false”.

       <b>+ai</b>     This  option  enables  active  icon  support  if  that  feature was compiled into <u>xterm</u>.  This is
               equivalent to setting the <u>vt100</u> resource <b>activeIcon</b> to “true”.

       <b>-aw</b>     This option indicates that auto-wraparound should be allowed, and is equivalent  to  setting  the
               <u>vt100</u> resource <b>autoWrap</b> to “true”.

               Auto-wraparound allows the cursor to automatically wrap to the beginning of the next line when it
               is at the rightmost position of a line and text is output.

       <b>+aw</b>     This  option  indicates  that auto-wraparound should not be allowed, and is equivalent to setting
               the <u>vt100</u> resource <b>autoWrap</b> to “false”.

       <b>-b</b> <u>number</u>
               This option specifies the size of the inner border (the distance between the outer  edge  of  the
               characters  and  the  window  border) in pixels.  That is the <u>vt100</u> <b>internalBorder</b> resource.  The
               default is “2”.

       <b>-barc</b>   This option, corresponding to the <b>cursorBar</b> resource, makes the cursor a bar instead of a box.

       <b>+barc</b>   This option, corresponding to the <b>cursorBar</b> resource, makes the cursor a box instead of a bar.

       <b>-baudrate</b> <u>number</u>
               Set the line-speed, used to test the behavior  of  applications  that  use  the  line-speed  when
               optimizing their output to the screen.  The default is “38400”.

       <b>-bc</b>     turn on text cursor blinking.  This overrides the <b>cursorBlink</b> resource.

       <b>+bc</b>     turn off text cursor blinking.  This overrides the <b>cursorBlink</b> resource.

       <b>-bcf</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
               set the amount of time text cursor is off when blinking via the <b>cursorOffTime</b> resource.

       <b>-bcn</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
               set the amount of time text cursor is on when blinking via the <b>cursorOnTime</b> resource.

       <b>-bdc</b>    Set  the  <u>vt100</u>  resource  <b>colorBDMode</b>  to “false”, disabling the display of characters with bold
               attribute as color.

       <b>+bdc</b>    Set the <u>vt100</u> resource <b>colorBDMode</b> to “true”,  enabling  the  display  of  characters  with  bold
               attribute as color rather than bold.

       <b>-cb</b>     Set the <u>vt100</u> resource <b>cutToBeginningOfLine</b> to “false”.

       <b>+cb</b>     Set the <u>vt100</u> resource <b>cutToBeginningOfLine</b> to “true”.

       <b>-cc</b> <u>characterclassrange</u><b>:</b><u>value</u><b>[,</b> <b>...]</b>
               This  sets  classes  indicated by the given ranges for using in selecting by words (see <b>CHARACTER</b>
               <b>CLASSES</b> and the <b>charClass</b> resource).

       <b>-cjk_width</b>
               Set the <b>cjkWidth</b> resource to “true”.  When turned on, characters with East  Asian  Ambiguous  (A)
               category in UTR 11 have a column width of 2.  Otherwise, they have a column width of 1.  This may
               be  useful  for  some legacy CJK text terminal-based programs assuming box drawings and others to
               have a column width of 2.  It also should be turned on when you specify a  TrueType  CJK  double-
               width  (bi-width/monospace)  font  either with <b>-fa</b> at the command line or <b>faceName</b> resource.  The
               default is “false”

       <b>+cjk_width</b>
               Reset the <b>cjkWidth</b> resource.

       <b>-class</b> <u>string</u>
               This option allows you to override <u>xterm</u>'s resource class.  Normally it is “XTerm”,  but  can  be
               set to another class such as “UXTerm” to override selected resources.

               <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> sets the <b>WM_CLASS</b> property using the instance name and this class value.

       <b>-cm</b>     This  option  disables  recognition of ANSI color-change escape sequences.  It sets the <b>colorMode</b>
               resource to “false”.

       <b>+cm</b>     This option enables recognition of ANSI color-change escape sequences.  This is the same  as  the
               <u>vt100</u> resource <b>colorMode</b>.

       <b>-cn</b>     This  option  indicates  that  newlines  should  not be cut in line-mode selections.  It sets the
               <b>cutNewline</b> resource to “false”.

       <b>+cn</b>     This option indicates that  newlines  should  be  cut  in  line-mode  selections.   It  sets  the
               <b>cutNewline</b> resource to “true”.

       <b>-cr</b> <u>color</u>
               This  option  specifies  the  color  to  use  for  text  cursor.   The default is to use the same
               foreground color that is used for text.  It  sets  the  <b>cursorColor</b>  resource  according  to  the
               parameter.

       <b>-cu</b>     This  option  indicates that <u>xterm</u> should work around a bug in the <b><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></b>(1) program that causes it
               to incorrectly display lines that are exactly the width of the window and are followed by a  line
               beginning  with  a  tab (the leading tabs are not displayed).  This option is so named because it
               was originally thought to be a bug in the <u><a href="../man3x/curses.3x.html">curses</a></u>(3x) cursor motion package.

       <b>+cu</b>     This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should not work around the <b><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></b>(1) bug mentioned above.

       <b>-dc</b>     This option disables the escape sequence to change  dynamic  colors:  the  vt100  foreground  and
               background  colors,  its  text cursor color, the pointer cursor foreground and background colors,
               the Tektronix emulator foreground and background colors, its  text  cursor  color  and  highlight
               color.  The option sets the <b>dynamicColors</b> option to “false”.

       <b>+dc</b>     This  option  enables  the  escape  sequence  to  change  dynamic  colors.   The  option sets the
               <b>dynamicColors</b> option to “true”.

       <b>-e</b> <u>program</u> <u>[</u> <u>arguments</u> <u>...</u> <u>]</u>
               This option specifies the program (and its command line arguments) to be run in the <u>xterm</u> window.
               It also sets the window title and icon name to be the basename of the program being  executed  if
               neither <u>-T</u> nor <u>-n</u> are given on the command line.

               <b>NOTE:</b> This must be the <b>last</b> <b>option</b> on the command line.

       <b>-en</b> <u>encoding</u>
               This option determines the encoding on which <u>xterm</u> runs.  It sets the <b>locale</b> resource.  Encodings
               other  than  UTF-8 are supported by using <u>luit</u>.  The <b>-lc</b> option should be used instead of <b>-en</b> for
               systems with locale support.

       <b>-fa</b> <u>pattern</u>
               This option sets the pattern for fonts selected from the FreeType library  if  support  for  that
               library  was compiled into <u>xterm</u>.  This corresponds to the <b>faceName</b> resource.  When a CJK double-
               width font is specified, you also need to turn on the <b>cjkWidth</b> resource.

               If you specify both <b>-fa</b> and the <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> option <b>-fn</b>, the <b>-fa</b> setting overrides the latter.

               See also the <b>renderFont</b> resource, which combines with this to determine  whether  FreeType  fonts
               are initially active.

       <b>-fb</b> <u>font</u>
               This  option  specifies  a  font  to  be  used  when  displaying bold text.  It sets the <b>boldFont</b>
               resource.

               This font must be the same height and width as the normal font, otherwise it is ignored.  If only
               one of the normal or bold fonts is specified, it will be used as the normal  font  and  the  bold
               font will be produced by overstriking this font.

               See also the discussion of <b>boldMode</b> and <b>alwaysBoldMode</b> resources.

       <b>-fbb</b>    This  option  indicates  that <u>xterm</u> should compare normal and bold fonts bounding boxes to ensure
               they are compatible.  It sets the <b>freeBoldBox</b> resource to “false”.

       <b>+fbb</b>    This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should not compare normal  and  bold  fonts  bounding  boxes  to
               ensure they are compatible.  It sets the <b>freeBoldBox</b> resource to “true”.

       <b>-fbx</b>    This  option  indicates  that  <u>xterm</u>  should not assume that the normal and bold fonts have VT100
               line-drawing characters.  If any are missing, <u>xterm</u> will draw the characters directly.   It  sets
               the <b>forceBoxChars</b> resource to “false”.

       <b>+fbx</b>    This  option  indicates  that <u>xterm</u> should assume that the normal and bold fonts have VT100 line-
               drawing characters.  It sets the <b>forceBoxChars</b> resource to “true”.

       <b>-fc</b> <u>fontchoice</u>
               Specify the initial font chosen from  the  font  menu.   The  option  value  corresponds  to  the
               <b>initialFont</b> resource.

       <b>-fd</b> <u>pattern</u>
               This option sets the pattern for double-width fonts selected from the FreeType library if support
               for that library was compiled into <u>xterm</u>.  This corresponds to the <b>faceNameDoublesize</b> resource.

       <b>-fi</b> <u>font</u>
               This option sets the font for active icons if that feature was compiled into <u>xterm</u>.

               See also the discussion of the <b>iconFont</b> resource.

       <b>-fs</b> <u>size</u>
               This  option  sets the pointsize for fonts selected from the FreeType library if support for that
               library was compiled into <u>xterm</u>.  This corresponds to the <b>faceSize</b> resource.

       <b>-fullscreen</b>
               This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should ask the window manager to let it use the full-screen  for
               display, e.g., without window decorations.  It sets the <b>fullscreen</b> resource to “true”.

       <b>+fullscreen</b>
               This  option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should not ask the window manager to let it use the full-screen
               for display.  It sets the <b>fullscreen</b> resource to “false”.

       <b>-fw</b> <u>font</u>
               This option specifies the font to be used for displaying wide text.  By default, it will  attempt
               to  use  a  font  twice as wide as the font that will be used to draw normal text.  If no double-
               width font is found, it will improvise, by stretching the normal font.  This corresponds  to  the
               <b>wideFont</b> resource.

       <b>-fwb</b> <u>font</u>
               This  option  specifies  the  font to be used for displaying bold wide text.  By default, it will
               attempt to use a font twice as wide as the font that will be used  to  draw  bold  text.   If  no
               double-width  font is found, it will improvise, by stretching the bold font.  This corresponds to
               the <b>wideBoldFont</b> resource.

       <b>-fx</b> <u>font</u>
               This option specifies the font to be used for displaying the preedit string in the  “OverTheSpot”
               input method.

               See also the discussion of the <b>ximFont</b> resource.

       <b>-hc</b> <u>color</u>
               (see <b>-selbg</b>).

       <b>-hf</b>     This  option  indicates  that HP function key escape codes should be generated for function keys.
               It sets the <b>hpFunctionKeys</b> resource to “true”.

       <b>+hf</b>     This option indicates that HP function key escape codes should  not  be  generated  for  function
               keys.  It sets the <b>hpFunctionKeys</b> resource to “false”.

       <b>-hm</b>     Tells   <u>xterm</u>   to   use   <b>highlightTextColor</b>   and   <b>highlightColor</b>  to  override  the  reversed
               foreground/background colors in a selection.  It sets the <b>highlightColorMode</b> resource to “true”.

       <b>+hm</b>     Tells  <u>xterm</u>  not  to  use  <b>highlightTextColor</b>  and  <b>highlightColor</b>  to  override  the   reversed
               foreground/background colors in a selection.  It sets the <b>highlightColorMode</b> resource to “false”.

       <b>-hold</b>   Turn  on  the  <b>hold</b>  resource, i.e., <u>xterm</u> will not immediately destroy its window when the shell
               command completes.  It will wait until you use the window manager to destroy/kill the window,  or
               if you use the menu entries that send a signal, e.g., HUP or KILL.

       <b>+hold</b>   Turn  off  the  <b>hold</b>  resource,  i.e.,  <u>xterm</u>  will immediately destroy its window when the shell
               command completes.

       <b>-ie</b>     Turn on the <b>ptyInitialErase</b> resource, i.e., use the pseudo-terminal's sense of the <b><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></b>(1)  erase
               value.

       <b>+ie</b>     Turn  off  the  <b>ptyInitialErase</b> resource, i.e., set the <u>stty</u> erase value using the <b>kb</b> string from
               the termcap entry as a reference, if available.

       <b>-im</b>     Turn on the <b>useInsertMode</b> resource, which forces use of insert mode by adding appropriate entries
               to the TERMCAP environment variable.  (This option is ignored on most systems, because TERMCAP is
               not used).

       <b>+im</b>     Turn off the <b>useInsertMode</b> resource.

       <b>-into</b> <u>windowId</u>
               Given an X window identifier (an integer, which can be hexadecimal, octal or decimal according to
               whether it begins with "0x", "0" or neither), <u>xterm</u> will reparent its top-level shell  widget  to
               that window.  This is used to embed <u>xterm</u> within other applications.

               For  instance, there are scripts for Tcl/Tk and Gtk which can be used to demonstrate the feature.
               When using Gtk, there is a limitation of that toolkit which requires that <u>xterm</u>'s <b>allowSendEvents</b>
               resource is enabled.

       <b>-itc</b>    Set the <u>vt100</u> resource <b>colorITMode</b> to “false”, disabling the display of  characters  with  italic
               attribute as color.

       <b>+itc</b>    Set  the  <u>vt100</u>  resource  <b>colorITMode</b>  to “true”, enabling the display of characters with italic
               attribute as color rather than italic.

       <b>-j</b>      This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should do jump scrolling.   It  corresponds  to  the  <b>jumpScroll</b>
               resource.   Normally,  text  is  scrolled  one  line  at a time; this option allows <u>xterm</u> to move
               multiple lines at a time so that it does not fall as far behind.  Its use is strongly recommended
               since it makes <u>xterm</u> much faster when scanning through large amounts of text.  The  VT100  escape
               sequences  for enabling and disabling smooth scroll as well as the <b>VT</b> <b>Options</b> menu can be used to
               turn this feature on or off.

       <b>+j</b>      This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should not do jump scrolling.

       <b>-jf</b>     When doing jump-scrolling or related indexing, e.g., carriage returns, <u>xterm</u> will defer  flushing
               screen-updates, to improve speed.  This corresponds to the <b>fastScroll</b> resource.

       <b>+jf</b>     When  doing  jump-scrolling  or  related  indexing,  e.g., carriage returns, <u>xterm</u> will not defer
               flushing screen-updates, to improve speed.  This corresponds to the <b>fastScroll</b> resource.

       <b>-k8</b>     This option sets the <b>allowC1Printable</b> resource.  When <b>allowC1Printable</b> is  set,  <u>xterm</u>  overrides
               the mapping of C1 control characters (code 128–159) to treat them as printable.

       <b>+k8</b>     This option resets the <b>allowC1Printable</b> resource.

       <b>-kt</b> <u>keyboardtype</u>
               This  option  sets  the  <b>keyboardType</b>  resource.   Possible values include: “unknown”, “default”,
               “legacy”, “hp”, “sco”, “sun”, “tcap” and “vt220”.

               The value “unknown”, causes the corresponding resource to be ignored.

               The value “default”, suppresses the associated resources

               <b>hpFunctionKeys</b>,
               <b>scoFunctionKeys</b>,
               <b>sunFunctionKeys</b>,
               <b>tcapFunctionKeys</b>,
               <b>oldXtermFKeys</b> and
               <b>sunKeyboard</b>,

               using the Sun/PC keyboard layout.

       <b>-l</b>      Turn logging on, unless disabled by the <b>logInhibit</b> resource.

               Some versions of <u>xterm</u> may have logging enabled.  However, normally logging is not supported, due
               to security concerns in the early 1990s.  That was a problem in  X11R4  <b>xterm</b>  (1989)  which  was
               addressed by a patch to X11R5 late in 1993.  X11R6 included these fixes.  The older version (when
               running  with  <u>root</u>  privilege)  would  create the log file using <u>root</u> privilege.  The reason why
               <u>xterm</u> ran with <u>root</u> privileges was to open pseudo-terminals.  Those  privileges  are  now  needed
               only on very old systems: Unix98 pseudo-terminals made the BSD scheme unnecessary.

               Unless overridden by the <b>-lf</b> option or the <b>logFile</b> resource:

               •   If the filename is “-”, then logging is sent to the standard output.

               •   Otherwise  a  filename  is generated, and the log file is written to the directory from which
                   <u>xterm</u> is invoked.

               •   The generated filename is of the form

                       XtermLog.<u>XXXXXX</u>

                   or

                       Xterm.log.<u>hostname.yyyy.mm.dd.hh.mm.ss.XXXXXX</u>

                   depending on how <u>xterm</u> was built.

       <b>+l</b>      Turn logging off.

       <b>-lc</b>     Turn on support of various encodings according  to  the  users'  locale  setting,  i.e.,  LC_ALL,
               LC_CTYPE,  or  LANG  environment  variables.   This  is  achieved by turning on UTF-8 mode and by
               invoking <u>luit</u> for conversion between locale encodings and UTF-8.  (<u>luit</u> is not invoked  in  UTF-8
               locales.)  This corresponds to the <b>locale</b> resource.

               The  actual list of encodings which are supported is determined by <u>luit</u>.  Consult the <u>luit</u> manual
               page for further details.

               See also the discussion of the <b>-u8</b> option which supports UTF-8 locales.

       <b>+lc</b>     Turn off support of automatic selection of locale encodings.  Conventional 8bit mode or, in UTF-8
               locales or with <b>-u8</b> option, UTF-8 mode will be used.

       <b>-lcc</b> <u>path</u>
               File name for the encoding converter from/to locale encodings and UTF-8 which is  used  with  <b>-lc</b>
               option or <b>locale</b> resource.  This corresponds to the <b>localeFilter</b> resource.

       <b>-leftbar</b>
               Force  scrollbar  to the left side of VT100 screen.  This is the default, unless you have set the
               <b>rightScrollBar</b> resource.

       <b>-lf</b> <u>filename</u>
               Specify the log filename.  This sets the <b>logFile</b> resource.  If set to “-”, <u>xterm</u> writes  its  log
               to the standard output.  See the <b>-l</b> option.

       <b>-ls</b>     This  option  indicates  that the shell that is started in the <u>xterm</u> window will be a login shell
               (i.e., the first character of argv[0] will be a dash, indicating to the shell that it should read
               the user's .login or .profile).

               The <b>-ls</b> flag and the <b>loginShell</b> resource are ignored if <b>-e</b> is also given, because <u>xterm</u> does  not
               know  how  to  make  the  shell start the given command after whatever it does when it is a login
               shell - the user's shell of choice need not be a Bourne  shell  after  all.   Also,  <u>xterm</u> <u>-e</u>  is
               supposed  to  provide  a consistent functionality for other applications that need to start text-
               mode programs in a window, and if <b>loginShell</b> were not ignored, the  result  of  <a href="file:~/.profile">~/.profile</a>  might
               interfere with that.

               If you do want the effect of <b>-ls</b> and <b>-e</b> simultaneously, you may get away with something like

                   xterm -e <a href="file:/bin/bash">/bin/bash</a> -l -c "my command here"

               Finally,  <b>-ls</b>  is  not  completely  ignored,  because  <u>xterm</u> <u>-ls</u> <u>-e</u>  does  write a <u>wtmp</u> entry (if
               configured to do so), whereas <u>xterm</u> <u>-e</u> does not.

       <b>+ls</b>     This option indicates that the shell that is started should not be a login shell (i.e.,  it  will
               be a normal “subshell”).

       <b>-maximized</b>
               This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should ask the window manager to maximize its layout on startup.
               This corresponds to the <b>maximized</b> resource.

               Maximizing  is  not  the  reverse  of  iconifying;  it is possible to do both with certain window
               managers.

       <b>+maximized</b>
               This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should ask the window manager to  not  maximize  its  layout  on
               startup.

       <b>-mb</b>     This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should ring a margin bell when the user types near the right end
               of a line.

       <b>+mb</b>     This option indicates that margin bell should not be rung.

       <b>-mc</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
               This option specifies the maximum time between multi-click selections.

       <b>-mesg</b>   Turn off the <b>messages</b> resource, i.e., disallow write access to the terminal.

       <b>+mesg</b>   Turn on the <b>messages</b> resource, i.e., allow write access to the terminal.

       <b>-mk_width</b>
               Set  the  <b>mkWidth</b>  resource  to  “true”.   This  makes  <u>xterm</u> use a built-in version of the wide-
               character width calculation.  The default is “false”

       <b>+mk_width</b>
               Reset the <b>mkWidth</b> resource.

       <b>-ms</b> <u>color</u>
               This option specifies the color to be used for the pointer cursor.  The default  is  to  use  the
               foreground color.  This sets the <b>pointerColor</b> resource.

       <b>-nb</b> <u>number</u>
               This  option  specifies the number of characters from the right end of a line at which the margin
               bell, if enabled, will ring.  The default is “10”.

       <b>-nomap</b>  This option disables the initial <u>mapping</u> of the terminal window.  Mapping an X  window  makes  it
               visible if it is <u>managed</u>.  The default is “false” because <u>xterm</u>'s window is normally displayed on
               startup.

               After  startup,  an unmapped <u>xterm</u> window can be mapped by identifying its window-id, e.g., using
               <b><a href="../man1/xwininfo.1.html">xwininfo</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/xlsclients.1.html">xlsclients</a></b>(1), and then employing another program such as <b><a href="../man1/xdotool.1.html">xdotool</a></b>(1)  to  ask  the
               window manager to make it visible.

               If  the  <u>xterm</u> window is visible (i.e., mapped), <u>xterm</u>'s menus and actions (i.e., <b>set-visibility</b>)
               allow one to select whether the VT100 or Tek4014 windows should be displayed.

       <b>+nomap</b>  This option enables the initial <u>mapping</u> of the terminal window.  This is the default behavior.

       <b>-nul</b>    This option disables the display of underlining.

       <b>+nul</b>    This option enables the display of underlining.

       <b>-pc</b>     This option enables the PC-style use of bold colors (see <b>boldColors</b> resource).

       <b>+pc</b>     This option disables the PC-style use of bold colors.

       <b>-pf</b> <u>font</u>
               This option specifies the font to be used for the pointer.  The corresponding  resource  name  is
               <u>pointerFont</u>.  The resource value default is <u>cursor</u>.

       <b>-pob</b>    This option indicates that the window should be raised whenever a Control-G is received.

       <b>+pob</b>    This option indicates that the window should not be raised whenever a Control-G is received.

       <b>-report-charclass</b>
               Print  a  report to the standard output showing information about the character-classes which can
               be altered using the <b>charClass</b> resource.

       <b>-report-colors</b>
               Print a report to the standard output showing information about colors as <u>xterm</u>  allocates  them.
               This corresponds to the <b>reportColors</b> resource.

       <b>-report-fonts</b>
               Print  a  report  to  the standard output showing information about fonts which are loaded.  This
               corresponds to the <b>reportFonts</b> resource.

       <b>-report-icons</b>
               Print a report to the standard output showing information about pixmap-icons  which  are  loaded.
               This corresponds to the <b>reportIcons</b> resource.

       <b>-report-xres</b>
               Print  a  report  to  the  standard  output  showing  the  values of boolean, numeric or string X
               resources for the VT100  widget  when  initialization  is  complete.   This  corresponds  to  the
               <b>reportXRes</b> resource.

       <b>-rightbar</b>
               Force scrollbar to the right side of VT100 screen.

       <b>-rvc</b>    This option disables the display of characters with reverse attribute as color.

       <b>+rvc</b>    This option enables the display of characters with reverse attribute as color.

       <b>-rw</b>     This  option indicates that reverse-wraparound should be allowed.  This allows the cursor to back
               up from the leftmost column of one line to the rightmost column of the previous  line.   This  is
               very useful for editing long shell command lines and is encouraged.  This option can be turned on
               and off from the <b>VT</b> <b>Options</b> menu.

       <b>+rw</b>     This option indicates that reverse-wraparound should not be allowed.

       <b>-s</b>      This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> may scroll asynchronously, meaning that the screen does not have
               to  be  kept completely up to date while scrolling.  This allows <u>xterm</u> to run faster when network
               latencies are very high and is typically useful when running across a very large internet or many
               gateways.

       <b>+s</b>      This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should scroll synchronously.

       <b>-samename</b>
               Does not send title and icon name change requests when the request would have no effect: the name
               is not changed.  This has the advantage of preventing flicker and the disadvantage  of  requiring
               an  extra round trip to the server to find out the previous value.  In practice this should never
               be a problem.

       <b>+samename</b>
               Always send title and icon name change requests.

       <b>-sb</b>     This option indicates that some number of lines that are scrolled  off  the  top  of  the  window
               should be saved and that a scrollbar should be displayed so that those lines can be viewed.  This
               option may be turned on and off from the <b>VT</b> <b>Options</b> menu.

       <b>+sb</b>     This option indicates that a scrollbar should not be displayed.

       <b>-selbg</b> <u>color</u>
               This  option  specifies  the color to use for the background of selected text.  If not specified,
               reverse video is used.  See the discussion of the <b>highlightColor</b> resource.

       <b>-selfg</b> <u>color</u>
               This option specifies the color to use for selected text.  If not  specified,  reverse  video  is
               used.  See the discussion of the <b>highlightTextColor</b> resource.

       <b>-sf</b>     This option indicates that Sun function key escape codes should be generated for function keys.

       <b>+sf</b>     This option indicates that the standard escape codes should be generated for function keys.

       <b>-sh</b> <u>number</u>
               scale line-height values by the given number.  See the discussion of the <b>scaleHeight</b> resource.

       <b>-si</b>     This  option  indicates that output to a window should not automatically reposition the screen to
               the bottom of the scrolling region.  This option can be turned on and off  from  the  <b>VT</b>  <b>Options</b>
               menu.

       <b>+si</b>     This option indicates that output to a window should cause it to scroll to the bottom.

       <b>-sk</b>     This  option  indicates that pressing a key while using the scrollbar to review previous lines of
               text should cause the window to be repositioned automatically  in  the  normal  position  at  the
               bottom of the scroll region.

       <b>+sk</b>     This  option  indicates that pressing a key while using the scrollbar should not cause the window
               to be repositioned.

       <b>-sl</b> <u>number</u>
               This option specifies the number of lines to save that have been scrolled  off  the  top  of  the
               screen.  This corresponds to the <b>saveLines</b> resource.  The default is “1024”.

       <b>-sm</b>     This option, corresponding to the <b>sessionMgt</b> resource, indicates that <u>xterm</u> should set up session
               manager callbacks.

       <b>+sm</b>     This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should not set up session manager callbacks.

       <b>-sp</b>     This option indicates that Sun/PC keyboard should be assumed, providing mapping for keypad “+” to
               “,”, and CTRL-F1 to F13, CTRL-F2 to F14, etc.

       <b>+sp</b>     This  option indicates that the standard escape codes should be generated for keypad and function
               keys.

       <b>-t</b>      This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should start in Tektronix  mode,  rather  than  in  VT<u>xxx</u>  mode.
               Switching between the two windows is done using the “Options” menus.

               Terminal database (<u>terminfo</u> (5) or <u>termcap</u> (5)) entries that work with <u>xterm</u> are:

               “tek4014”,
               “tek4015”,
               “tek4012”,
               “tek4013”,
               “tek4010”, and
               “dumb”.

               <u>Xterm</u>  automatically searches the terminal database in this order for these entries and then sets
               the “TERM” variable (and the “TERMCAP” environment variable, if relevant).

       <b>+t</b>      This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should start in VT<u>xxx</u> mode.

       <b>-tb</b>     This option, corresponding to the <b>toolBar</b> resource, indicates that <u>xterm</u> should display a toolbar
               (or menubar) at the top of its window.  The buttons in the toolbar correspond to the popup menus,
               e.g., control/left/mouse for <b>Main</b> <b>Options</b>.

       <b>+tb</b>     This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should not set up a toolbar.

       <b>-ti</b> <u>term_id</u>
               Specify the name used by <u>xterm</u> to select the correct response to terminal ID  queries.   It  also
               specifies  the  emulation level, used to determine the type of response to a DA control sequence.
               Valid values include vt52, vt100, vt101, vt102, vt220, and vt240 (the  “vt”  is  optional).   The
               default is “vt420”.  The <u>term_id</u> argument specifies the terminal ID to use.  (This is the same as
               the <b>decTerminalID</b> resource).

       <b>-tm</b> <u>string</u>
               This  option  specifies  a  series  of  terminal setting keywords followed by the characters that
               should be bound to those functions, similar to the  <b><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></b>(1)  program.   The  keywords  and  their
               values are described in detail in the <b>ttyModes</b> resource.

       <b>-tn</b> <u>name</u>
               This  option  specifies the name of the terminal type to be set in the TERM environment variable.
               It corresponds to the <b>termName</b> resource.  This terminal type must exist in the terminal  database
               (termcap  or  terminfo, depending on how <u>xterm</u> is built) and should have <u>li#</u> and <u>co#</u> entries.  If
               the terminal type is not found, <u>xterm</u> uses the built-in list “xterm”, “vt102”, etc.

       <b>-u8</b>     This option sets the <b>utf8</b> resource.  When <b>utf8</b> is set, <u>xterm</u> interprets incoming data  as  UTF-8.
               This sets the <b>wideChars</b> resource as a side-effect, but the UTF-8 mode set by this option prevents
               it  from being turned off.  If you must turn UTF-8 encoding on and off, use the <b>-wc</b> option or the
               corresponding <b>wideChars</b> resource, rather than the <b>-u8</b> option.

               This option and the <b>utf8</b> resource are overridden by the <b>-lc</b> and <b>-en</b> options and <b>locale</b>  resource.
               That  is, if <u>xterm</u> has been compiled to support <u>luit</u>, and the <b>locale</b> resource is not “false” this
               option is ignored.  We recommend using the <b>-lc</b> option or the  “<b>locale:</b> <b>true</b>”  resource  in  UTF-8
               locales  when  your  operating system supports locale, or <b>-en</b> <b>UTF-8</b> option or the “<b>locale:</b> <b>UTF-8</b>”
               resource when your operating system does not support locale.

       <b>+u8</b>     This option resets the <b>utf8</b> resource.

       <b>-uc</b>     This option, corresponding to the <b>cursorUnderLine</b> resource, makes the cursor  underlined  instead
               of a box.

       <b>+uc</b>     This  option  m,  corresponding to the <b>cursorUnderLine</b> resource, akes the cursor a box instead of
               underlined.

       <b>-ulc</b>    This option disables the display of characters with underline attribute as color rather than with
               underlining.

       <b>+ulc</b>    This option enables the display of characters with underline attribute as color rather than  with
               underlining.

       <b>-ulit</b>   This  option, corresponding to the <b>italicULMode</b> resource, disables the display of characters with
               underline attribute as italics rather than with underlining.

       <b>+ulit</b>   This option, corresponding to the <b>italicULMode</b> resource, enables the display of  characters  with
               underline attribute as italics rather than with underlining.

       <b>-ut</b>     This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should not write a record into the system <u>utmp</u> log file.

       <b>+ut</b>     This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should write a record into the system <u>utmp</u> log file.

       <b>-vb</b>     This  option  indicates  that a visual bell is preferred over an audible one.  Instead of ringing
               the terminal bell whenever a Control-G is received, the window will be flashed.

       <b>+vb</b>     This option indicates that a visual bell should not be used.

       <b>-wc</b>     This option sets the <b>wideChars</b> resource.

               When <b>wideChars</b> is set, <u>xterm</u> maintains internal structures for 16-bit characters.   If  <u>xterm</u>  is
               not  started  in  UTF-8  mode  (or  if  this  resource  is not set), initially it maintains those
               structures to support 8-bit characters.  <u>Xterm</u> can later be  switched,  using  a  menu  entry  or
               control sequence, causing it to reallocate those structures to support 16-bit characters.

               The default is “false”.

       <b>+wc</b>     This option resets the <b>wideChars</b> resource.

       <b>-wf</b>     This  option  indicates  that <u>xterm</u> should wait for the window to be mapped the first time before
               starting the subprocess so that the initial terminal size settings and environment variables  are
               correct.  It is the application's responsibility to catch subsequent terminal size changes.

       <b>+wf</b>     This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should not wait before starting the subprocess.

       <b>-ziconbeep</b> <u>percent</u>
               Same  as  <b>zIconBeep</b> resource.  If percent is non-zero, xterms that produce output while iconified
               will cause an XBell sound at the given volume and have “***”  prepended  to  their  icon  titles.
               Most  window  managers  will  detect  this  change  immediately, showing you which window has the
               output.  (A similar feature was in x10 <u>xterm</u>.)

       <b>-C</b>      This option indicates that this window should receive console output.  This is not  supported  on
               all systems.  To obtain console output, you must be the owner of the console device, and you must
               have  read and write permission for it.  If you are running X under <u>xdm</u> on the console screen you
               may need to have the session startup and reset programs explicitly change the  ownership  of  the
               console device in order to get this option to work.

       <b>-S</b><u>ccn</u>   This option allows <u>xterm</u> to be used as an input and output channel for an existing program and is
               sometimes  used  in specialized applications.  The option value specifies the last few letters of
               the name of a pseudo-terminal to use in slave  mode,  plus  the  number  of  the  inherited  file
               descriptor.   If  the  option contains a “/” character, that delimits the characters used for the
               pseudo-terminal name from the file descriptor.  Otherwise, exactly two characters are  used  from
               the  option  for  the  pseudo-terminal name, the remainder is the file descriptor.  Examples (the
               first two are equivalent since the descriptor follows the last “/”):

                   -S/dev/pts/123/45
                   -S123/45
                   -Sab34

               Note that <u>xterm</u> does not close any file descriptor which it did not open for its own use.  It  is
               possible  (though  probably  not  portable)  to  have  an  application  which passes an open file
               descriptor down to <u>xterm</u> past the initialization or the <b>-S</b> option to a  process  running  in  the
               <u>xterm</u>.

   <b>Old</b> <b>Options</b>
       The following command line arguments are provided for compatibility with older versions.  They may not be
       supported in the next release as the <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> provides standard options that accomplish the same task.

       <b>%</b><u>geom</u>   This  option  specifies the preferred size and position of the Tektronix window.  It is shorthand
               for specifying the “<b>tekGeometry</b>” resource.

       <b>#</b><u>geom</u>   This option specifies the preferred position of the icon window.  It is shorthand for  specifying
               the “<b>iconGeometry</b>” resource.

       <b>-T</b> <u>string</u>
               This option specifies the title for <u>xterm</u>'s windows.  It is equivalent to <b>-title</b>.

       <b>-n</b> <u>string</u>
               This  option  specifies  the  icon  name for <u>xterm</u>'s windows.  It is shorthand for specifying the
               “<b>iconName</b>” resource.  Note that this is not the same as the <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> option <b>-name</b>.  The  default
               icon name is the application name.

               If no suitable icon is found, <u>xterm</u> provides a compiled-in pixmap.

               <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> sets the <b>WM_ICON_NAME</b> property using this value.

       <b>-r</b>      This  option  indicates  that  reverse  video  should be simulated by swapping the foreground and
               background colors.  It is equivalent to <b>-rv</b>.

       <b>-w</b> <u>number</u>
               This option specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding the window.  It is equivalent
               to <b>-borderwidth</b> or <b>-bw</b>.

   <b>X</b> <b>Toolkit</b> <b>Options</b>
       The following standard <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> command line arguments are commonly used with <u>xterm</u>:

       <b>-bd</b> <u>color</u>
               This option specifies the color to use for the border of the window.  The corresponding  resource
               name is <b>borderColor</b>.  <u>Xterm</u> uses the <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> default, which is “XtDefaultForeground”.

               <u>Xterm</u>'s  VT100  window  has  two  borders:  the  <u>inner</u> border <b>internalBorder</b> and the <u>outer</u> border
               <b>borderWidth</b>, managed by the <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u>.

               Normally <u>xterm</u> fills the inner  border  using  the  VT100  window's  background  color.   If  the
               <b>colorInnerBorder</b>  resource is enabled, then <u>xterm</u> may fill the inner border using the <b>borderColor</b>
               resource.

       <b>-bg</b> <u>color</u>
               This option specifies the color to use for the  background  of  the  window.   The  corresponding
               resource name is <u>background</u>.  The default is “XtDefaultBackground”.

       <b>-bw</b> <u>number</u>
               This option specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding the window.

               This  appears  to be a legacy of older X releases.  It sets the <b>borderWidth</b> resource of the shell
               widget, and may provide advice to your window manager to set the thickness of the  window  frame.
               Most  window  managers  do not use this information.  See the <b>-b</b> option, which controls the inner
               border of the <u>xterm</u> window.

       <b>-display</b> <u>display</u>
               This option specifies the X server to contact; see <a href="../man7/X.7.html">X</a>(7).

       <b>-fg</b> <u>color</u>
               This option specifies the color to use for displaying text.  The corresponding resource  name  is
               <u>foreground</u>.  The default is “XtDefaultForeground”.

       <b>-fn</b> <u>font</u>
               This option specifies the font to be used for displaying normal text.  The corresponding resource
               name is <u>font</u>.  The resource value default is <u>fixed</u>.

               <u>Xterm</u>'s <b>-fn</b> option accepts a comma-separated list like <b>-fa</b>, for the VT100 widget, using the first
               bitmap font (and discarding additional fonts).  However, other widgets (such as the toolbar) will
               be confused by this and give a warning.

       <b>-font</b> <u>font</u>
               This is the same as <b>-fn</b>.

       <b>-geometry</b> <u>geometry</u>
               This option specifies the preferred size and position of the VT<u>xxx</u> window; see <a href="../man7/X.7.html">X</a>(7).

               The  normal  geometry  specification  can  be  suffixed  with  <b>@</b>  followed  by  a Xinerama screen
               specification; it can be either <b>g</b> for the global screen (default), <b>c</b> for the current screen or  a
               screen number.

       <b>-iconic</b>
               This option indicates that <u>xterm</u> should ask the window manager to start it as an icon rather than
               as the normal window.  The corresponding resource name is <u>iconic</u>.

       <b>-name</b> <u>name</u>
               This  option specifies the application name under which resources are to be obtained, rather than
               the default executable file name.  <u>Name</u> should not contain “.” or “*” characters.

       <b>-rv</b>     This option indicates that reverse video should be  simulated  by  swapping  the  foreground  and
               background colors.  The corresponding resource name is <b>reverseVideo</b>.

       <b>+rv</b>     Disable the simulation of reverse video by swapping foreground and background colors.

       <b>-title</b> <u>string</u>
               This  option  specifies the window title string, which may be displayed by window managers if the
               user so chooses.  It is shorthand for specifying the “<b>title</b>” resource.  The default title is  the
               command line specified after the <b>-e</b> option, if any, otherwise the application name.

               <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> sets the <b>WM_NAME</b> property using this value.

       <b>-xrm</b> <u>resourcestring</u>
               This  option  specifies  a  resource  string  to  be used.  This is especially useful for setting
               resources that do not have separate command line options.

       <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> accepts alternate names for a few of these options, e.g.,

       •   “<b>-background</b>” for “<b>-bg</b>”

       •   “<b>-font</b>” for “<b>-fn</b>”

       •   “<b>-foreground</b>” for “<b>-fg</b>”

       Abbreviated options also are supported, e.g., “<b>-v</b>” for “<b>-version</b>.”

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xterm</u> understands all of the core <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> resource names and classes.   It  also  uses  the  <u>X</u>  <u>Toolkit</u>
       resource  types  (such  as  booleans,  colors,  fonts, integers, and strings) along with their respective
       converters.  Those resource types are not always sufficient:

       •   <u>Xterm</u>'s resource values may be lists of names.  <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> resource types do not include lists.  <u>Xterm</u>
           uses a string for the resource, and parses it.

           Comma-separated lists of names ignore case.

       •   <u>Xterm</u> may defer processing a resource until it is needed.   For  example,  <b>font2</b>  through  <b>font7</b>  are
           loaded as needed, to start faster.  Again, the actual resource type is a string, parsed and used when
           needed.

       Application specific resources (e.g., “<b>XTerm.</b><u>NAME</u>”) follow:

   <b>Application</b> <b>Resources</b>
       <b>backarrowKeyIsErase</b> (class <b>BackarrowKeyIsErase</b>)
               Tie  the  VT<u>xxx</u>  <b>backarrowKey</b>  and <b>ptyInitialErase</b> resources together by setting the DECBKM state
               according to whether the <u>initial</u> <u>erase</u> character is a backspace (8) or delete (127) character.  A
               “false” value disables this feature.  The default is “True”.

               Here are tables showing how the initial settings for

               •   <b>backarrowKeyIsErase</b> (BKIE),

               •   <b>backarrowKey</b> (BK), and

               •   <b>ptyInitialErase</b> (PIE), along with the

               •   <u>stty</u> erase character (^H for backspace, ^? for delete)

               will affect DECBKM.  First, <u>xterm</u> obtains the initial <u>erase</u> character:

               •   <u>xterm</u>'s internal value is ^H

               •   <u>xterm</u> asks the operating system for the value which <b><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></b>(1) shows

               •   the <b>ttyModes</b> resource may override <u>erase</u>

               •   if <b>ptyInitialErase</b> is false, <u>xterm</u> will look in the terminal database

               Summarizing that as a table:
               <b>PIE</b>     <b>stty</b>   <b>termcap</b>   <u>erase</u>
               ───────────────────────────────
               false    ^H      ^H       ^H
               false    ^H      ^?       ^?
               false    ^?      ^H       ^H
               false    ^?      ^?       ^?
               true     ^H      ^H       ^H
               true     ^H      ^?       ^H
               true     ^?      ^H       ^?
               true     ^?      ^?       ^?

               Using that <u>erase</u> character, <u>xterm</u> allows further choices:

               •   if <b>backarrowKeyIsErase</b> is true, <u>xterm</u> uses the <u>erase</u>  character  for  the  initial  state  of
                   <b>DECBKM</b>

               •   if  <b>backarrowKeyIsErase</b>  is  false,  <u>xterm</u>  sets  <b>DECBKM</b> to 2 (internal).  This ties together
                   <b>backarrowKey</b> and the control sequence for <b>DECBKM</b>.

               •   applications can send a control sequence to set/reset <b>DECBKM</b> control set

               •   the “Backarrow Key (BS/DEL)” menu entry toggles <b>DECBKM</b>

       <b>buffered</b> (class <b>Buffered</b>)
               Normally <u>xterm</u> is built with double-buffer support.  This resource can be used to turn it  on  or
               off.  Setting the resource to “true” turns double-buffering on.  The default value is “False”.

       <b>bufferedFPS</b> (class <b>BufferedFPS</b>)
               When  <u>xterm</u>  is built with double-buffer support, this gives the maximum number of frames/second.
               The default is “40” and is limited to the range 1 through 100.

       <b>cursorTheme</b> (class <b>CursorTheme</b>)
               The <a href="../man7/Xcursor.7.html">Xcursor</a>(7) library provides a way to change the pointer shape and size.  The X11 library uses
               this library to extend the font- and glyph-cursor calls used by applications such  as  <u>xterm</u>   to
               substitute external files for the built-in “core” cursors provided by X.

               <u>Xterm</u> uses the <b>pointerShape</b> resource to select the X cursor shape.  Most of the available sets of
               cursor  themes provide an incomplete set of “core” cursors (while possibly adding other cursors).
               Because of this limitation, <u>xterm</u> disables the feature by default.

               The cursor theme feature can be useful because  X  cursors  are  not  scalable  and  on  a  high-
               resolution  display,  the  cursors  are  hard  to find.  Some of the cursor themes include larger
               cursors to work around this limitation:

               •   The default core cursors are 8x8 pixels;

               •   Some cursor themes include cursors up to the X server limit of 64x64 pixels.

               At startup, <u>xterm</u> sets the <b>XCURSOR_THEME</b> environment variable to enable  or  disable  the  cursor
               theme  feature.   The  default value is “none”.  Other values (including “default”) are passed to
               the Xcursor library to select a cursor theme.

       <b>fullscreen</b> (class <b>Fullscreen</b>)
               Specifies whether or not <u>xterm</u> should ask the window  manager  to  use  a  fullscreen  layout  on
               startup.  <u>Xterm</u> accepts either a keyword (ignoring case) or the number shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                  Fullscreen  layout  is  not  used  initially,  but  may be later via menu-selection or control
                  sequence.

               true (1)
                  Fullscreen layout is used initially, but may be disabled later via menu-selection  or  control
                  sequence.

               always (2)
                  Fullscreen  layout  is  used  initially,  and  cannot  be disabled later via menu-selection or
                  control sequence.

               never (3)
                  Fullscreen layout is not used, and cannot be  enabled  later  via  menu-selection  or  control
                  sequence.

               The default is “false”.

       <b>hold</b> (class <b>Hold</b>)
               If true, <u>xterm</u> will not immediately destroy its window when the shell command completes.  It will
               wait  until you use the window manager to destroy/kill the window, or if you use the menu entries
               that send a signal, e.g., HUP or KILL.  You may scroll back, select text, etc., to  perform  most
               graphical  operations.   Resizing  the  display  will  lose  data,  however,  since this involves
               interaction with the shell which is no longer running.

       <b>hpFunctionKeys</b> (class <b>HpFunctionKeys</b>)
               Specifies whether or not HP function key escape codes should be generated for function keys.  The
               default is “false”, i.e., this feature is disabled.

               The <b>keyboardType</b> resource is the preferred mechanism for selecting this mode.

       <b>iconGeometry</b> (class <b>IconGeometry</b>)
               Specifies the preferred size  and  position  of  the  application  when  iconified.   It  is  not
               necessarily obeyed by all window managers.

       <b>iconHint</b> (class <b>IconHint</b>)
               Specifies  an  icon  which  will be added to the window manager hints.  <u>Xterm</u> provides no default
               value.

               Set this resource to “none” to omit the hint entirely, using  whatever  the  window  manager  may
               decide.

               If  the <b>iconHint</b> resource is given (or is set via the <b>-n</b> option) <u>xterm</u> searches for a pixmap file
               with that name, in the current directory as well as in /usr/share/pixmaps.  if the resource  does
               not  specify  an  absolute  pathname.   In  each  case,  <u>xterm</u> adds “_48x48” and/or “.xpm” to the
               filename after trying without those suffixes.  If it is able to load the  file,  <u>xterm</u>  sets  the
               window  manager  hint  for  the  icon-pixmap.   These pixmaps are distributed with <u>xterm</u>, and can
               optionally be compiled-in:

               •   mini.xterm_16x16, mini.xterm_32x32, mini.xterm_48x48

               •   filled-xterm_16x16, filled-xterm_32x32, filled-xterm_48x48

               •   xterm_16x16, xterm_32x32, xterm_48x48

               •   xterm-color_16x16, xterm-color_32x32, xterm-color_48x48

               In either case, <u>xterm</u> allows for adding a “_48x48” to specify the largest of  the  pixmaps  as  a
               default.  That is, “mini.xterm” is the same as “mini.xterm_48x48”.

               If  no  explicit  <b>iconHint</b> resource is given (or if none of the compiled-in names matches), <u>xterm</u>
               uses “mini.xterm” (which is always compiled-in).

               The <b>iconHint</b> resource has no effect on “desktop” files, including “panel” and “menu”.  Those  are
               typically  set  via a “.desktop” file; <u>xterm</u> provides samples for itself (and the <u>uxterm</u> script).
               The more capable desktop systems allow changing the icon on a per-user basis.

       <b>iconName</b> (class <b>IconName</b>)
               Specifies a label for <u>xterm</u> when  iconified.   <u>Xterm</u>  provides  no  default  value;  some  window
               managers may assume the application name, e.g., “xterm”.

               Setting  the  <b>iconName</b> resource sets the icon label unless overridden by <b>zIconBeep</b> or the control
               sequences which change the window and icon labels.

       <b>keyboardType</b> (class <b>KeyboardType</b>)
               Enables one (or none) of the various keyboard-type  resources:  <b>hpFunctionKeys</b>,  <b>scoFunctionKeys</b>,
               <b>sunFunctionKeys</b>, <b>tcapFunctionKeys</b>, <b>oldXtermFKeys</b> and <b>sunKeyboard</b>.

               The  resource's  value  should  be  one  of the corresponding strings “hp”, “sco”, “sun”, “tcap”,
               “legacy” or “vt220”, respectively.

               The individual resources are provided for legacy support; this resource is simpler to use.  <u>Xterm</u>
               will use only one keyboard-type, but if multiple resources are set, it warns and  uses  the  last
               one it checks.

               The default is “unknown”, i.e., none of the associated resources are set via this resource.

       <b>maxBufSize</b> (class <b>MaxBufSize</b>)
               Specify  the maximum size of the input buffer.  The default is “32768”.  You cannot set this to a
               value less than the <b>minBufSize</b> resource.  It will be increased  as  needed  to  make  that  value
               evenly divide this one.

               On  some  systems  you may want to increase one or both of the <b>maxBufSize</b> and <b>minBufSize</b> resource
               values to achieve better performance if the operating system prefers larger buffer sizes.

       <b>maximized</b> (class <b>Maximized</b>)
               Specifies whether or not <u>xterm</u> should ask the window manager to maximize its layout  on  startup.
               The default is “false”.

       <b>menuHeight</b> (class <b>MenuHeight</b>)
               Specifies  the  height  of  the  toolbar,  which  may be increased by the <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> Layout widget
               depending upon the fontsize used.  The default is “25”.

       <b>menuLocale</b> (class <b>MenuLocale</b>)
               Specify the locale used for character-set computations when loading the popup menus.  Use this to
               improve initialization performance of the <u>Athena</u> popup menus, which  may  load  unnecessary  (and
               very large) fonts, e.g., in a locale having UTF-8 encoding.  The default is “C” (POSIX).

               To  use  the current locale (only useful if you have localized the resource settings for the menu
               entries), set the resource to an empty string.

       <b>messages</b> (class <b>Messages</b>)
               Specifies whether write access to the terminal is allowed initially.  See <b><a href="../man1/mesg.1.html">mesg</a></b>(1).   The  default
               is “true”.

       <b>minBufSize</b> (class <b>MinBufSize</b>)
               Specify  the  minimum  size  of the input buffer, i.e., the amount of data that <u>xterm</u> requests on
               each read.  The default is “4096”.  You cannot set this to a value less than 64.

       <b>omitTranslation</b> (class <b>OmitTranslation</b>)
               Selectively omit one or more parts of <u>xterm</u>'s default  translations  at  startup.   The  resource
               value is a comma-separated list of keywords, which may be abbreviated:

               default
                      ignore (mouse) button-down events which were not handled by other translations

               fullscreen
                      assigns a key-binding to the <b>fullscreen()</b> action.

               keypress
                      assigns keypresses by default to the <b>insert-seven-bit()</b> and <b>insert-eight-bit()</b> actions.

               paging assigns key bindings to the <b>scroll-back()</b> and <b>scroll-forw()</b> actions.

               pointer
                      assigns  pointer  <u>motion</u>  and  <u>button</u>  events to the <b>pointer-motion()</b> and <b>pointer-button()</b>
                      actions respectively.

               popup-menu
                      assigns mouse-buttons with the <u>control</u> modifier to the popup-menus.

               reset  assigns mouse-button 2 with the <u>meta</u> modifier to the <b>clear-saved-lines</b> action.

               scroll-lock
                      assigns a key-binding to the <b>scroll-lock()</b> action.

               block-select
                      an optional (compile-time) feature for supporting  rectangular  selections.   By  default,
                      this is bound to <u>Meta</u> <u>button</u> <u>one</u>.

               select assigns mouse- and keypress-combinations to actions which manipulate the selection.

                      <u>Xterm</u>  also  uses  these  actions  to  capture mouse button and motion events which can be
                      manipulated with the mouse protocol control sequences.  If  the  <u>select</u>  translations  are
                      omitted,  then  the  <b>pointer-motion</b> and <b>pointer-button</b> handle these mouse protocol control
                      sequences instead.

               shift-fonts
                      assigns key-bindings to <b>larger-vt-font()</b> and <b>smaller-vt-font()</b> actions.

               wheel-mouse
                      assigns buttons 4 and 5 with different modifiers to the  <b>scroll-back()</b>  and  <b>scroll-forw()</b>
                      actions.

       <b>ptyHandshake</b> (class <b>PtyHandshake</b>)
               If  “true”,  <u>xterm</u>  will  perform handshaking during initialization to ensure that the parent and
               child processes update the <u>utmp</u> and <b><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></b>(1) state.

               See also <b>waitForMap</b> which waits  for  the  pseudo-terminal's  notion  of  the  screen  size,  and
               <b>ptySttySize</b>  which  resets  the screen size after other terminal initialization is complete.  The
               default is “true”.

       <b>ptyInitialErase</b> (class <b>PtyInitialErase</b>)
               If “true”, <u>xterm</u> will use the pseudo-terminal's sense of the <u>stty</u> erase value.  If “false”, <u>xterm</u>
               will set the <u>stty</u> erase value to match its own  configuration,  using  the  <b>kb</b>  string  from  the
               termcap entry as a reference, if available.

               In  either  case,  the  result is applied to the TERMCAP variable which <u>xterm</u> sets, if the system
               uses TERMCAP.

               See also the <b>ttyModes</b> resource, which may override this.  The default is “True”.

       <b>ptySttySize</b> (class <b>PtySttySize</b>)
               If “true”, <u>xterm</u> will reset the screen size after terminal initialization is complete.   This  is
               needed  for some systems whose pseudo-terminals cannot propagate terminal characteristics.  Where
               it is not needed, it can interfere with other methods for setting the initial screen size,  e.g.,
               via window manager interaction.

               See  also  <b>waitForMap</b>  which waits for a handshake-message giving the pseudo-terminal's notion of
               the screen size.  The default is “false” on Linux and macOS systems, “true” otherwise.

       <b>reportColors</b> (class <b>ReportColors</b>)
               If true, <u>xterm</u> will print to the standard output a summary of colors as it allocates  them.   The
               default is “false”.

       <b>reportFonts</b> (class <b>ReportFonts</b>)
               If  true,  <u>xterm</u> will print to the standard output a summary of each font's metrics (size, number
               of glyphs, etc.), as it loads them.  The default is “false”.

       <b>reportIcons</b> (class <b>ReportIcons</b>)
               If true, <u>xterm</u> will print to the standard output a summary of each pixmap icon as it loads  them.
               The default is “false”.

       <b>reportXRes</b> (class <b>ReportXRes</b>)
               If  true,  <u>xterm</u>  will  print  to the standard output a list of the boolean, numeric and string X
               resources for the VT100 widget after initialization.  The default is “false”.

       <b>sameName</b> (class <b>SameName</b>)
               If the value of this resource is “true”, <u>xterm</u> does not send title and icon name change  requests
               when  the  request  would  have  no  effect:  the name is not changed.  This has the advantage of
               preventing flicker and the disadvantage of requiring an extra round trip to the  server  to  find
               out the previous value.  In practice this should never be a problem.  The default is “true”.

       <b>scaleHeight</b> (class <b>ScaleHeight</b>)
               Scale  line-height values by the resource value, which is limited to “0.9” to “1.5”.  The default
               value is “1.0”,

               While this resource applies to either bitmap or TrueType fonts, its main purpose is to help  work
               around  incompatible changes in the Xft library's font metrics.  <u>Xterm</u> checks the font metrics to
               find what the library claims are the bounding boxes for each glyph (character).  However, some of
               Xft's features (such as the autohinter) can cause  the  glyphs  to  be  scaled  larger  than  the
               bounding boxes, and be partly overwritten by the next row.

               See <b>useClipping</b> for a related resource.

       <b>scoFunctionKeys</b> (class <b>ScoFunctionKeys</b>)
               Specifies  whether  or  not  SCO function key escape codes should be generated for function keys.
               The default is “false”, i.e., this feature is disabled.

               The <b>keyboardType</b> resource is the preferred mechanism for selecting this mode.

       <b>sessionMgt</b> (class <b>SessionMgt</b>)
               If the  value  of  this  resource  is  “true”,  <u>xterm</u>  sets  up  session  manager  callbacks  for
               <b>XtNdieCallback</b> and <b>XtNsaveCallback</b>.  The default is “true”.

       <b>sunFunctionKeys</b> (class <b>SunFunctionKeys</b>)
               Specifies  whether  or  not  Sun function key escape codes should be generated for function keys.
               The default is “false”, i.e., this feature is disabled.

               The <b>keyboardType</b> resource is the preferred mechanism for selecting this mode.

       <b>sunKeyboard</b> (class <b>SunKeyboard</b>)
               <u>Xterm</u> translates certain key symbols based on its assumptions about your keyboard.  This resource
               specifies whether or not Sun/PC keyboard layout (i.e., the PC keyboard's numeric keypad  together
               with 12 function keys) should be assumed rather than DEC VT220.  This causes the keypad “+” to be
               mapped  to  “,”.  and CTRL F1-F10 to F11-F20, depending on the setting of the <b>ctrlFKeys</b> resource,
               so <u>xterm</u> emulates a DEC VT220 more accurately.  Otherwise (the default, with <b>sunKeyboard</b>  set  to
               “false”), <u>xterm</u> uses PC-style bindings for the function keys and keypad.

               PC-style  bindings  use  the Shift, Alt, Control and Meta keys as modifiers for function-keys and
               keypad (see <u>Xterm</u> <u>Control</u> <u>Sequences</u> for details).  The PC-style bindings are analogous to PCTerm,
               but not the same thing.  Normally these bindings do not conflict with the use of the Meta key  as
               described  for  the  <b>eightBitInput</b>  resource.   If  they  do, note that the PC-style bindings are
               evaluated first.

               See also the <b>keyboardType</b> resource.

       <b>tcapFunctionKeys</b> (class <b>TcapFunctionKeys</b>)
               Specifies whether or  not  function  key  escape  codes  read  from  the  termcap/terminfo  entry
               corresponding  to  the <b>TERM</b> environment variable should be generated for function keys instead of
               those configured using <b>sunKeyboard</b> and <b>keyboardType</b>.  The default is “false”, i.e., this  feature
               is disabled.

               The <b>keyboardType</b> resource is the preferred mechanism for selecting this mode.

       <b>termName</b> (class <b>TermName</b>)
               Specifies the terminal type name to be set in the TERM environment variable.

       <b>title</b> (class <b>Title</b>)
               Specifies a string that may be used by the window manager when displaying this application.

       <b>toolBar</b> (class <b>ToolBar</b>)
               Specifies whether or not the toolbar should be displayed.  The default is “true”.

       <b>ttyModes</b> (class <b>TtyModes</b>)
               Specifies  a  string containing terminal setting keywords.  Except where noted, they may be bound
               to <u>characters</u>.  Other keywords set <u>modes</u>.  Not all keywords are  supported  on  a  given  system.
               Allowable keywords include:
               <b>Keyword</b>   <b>POSIX?</b>   <b>Notes</b>
               ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
               brk       no       <u>CHAR</u> may send an “interrupt” signal, as well
                                  as ending the input-line.
               dsusp     no       <u>CHAR</u>  will  send  a  terminal  “stop” signal
                                  after input is flushed.
               eof       yes      <u>CHAR</u> will terminate input (i.e., an  end  of
                                  file).
               eol       yes      <u>CHAR</u> will end the line.
               eol2      no       alternate <u>CHAR</u> for ending the line.
               erase     yes      <u>CHAR</u> will erase the last character typed.
               erase2    no       alternate  <u>CHAR</u>  for erasing the last input-
                                  character.
               flush     no       <u>CHAR</u> will cause output to be discarded until
                                  another <b>flush</b> character is typed.
               intr      yes      <u>CHAR</u> will send an “interrupt” signal.
               kill      yes      <u>CHAR</u> will erase the current line.
               lnext     no       <u>CHAR</u> will enter the next character quoted.
               quit      yes      <u>CHAR</u> will send a “quit” signal.
               rprnt     no       <u>CHAR</u> will redraw the current line.
               start     yes      <u>CHAR</u> will <u>restart</u> the output after  stopping
                                  it.
               status    no       <u>CHAR</u>  will  cause  a system-generated status
                                  line to be printed.
               stop      yes      <u>CHAR</u> will stop the output.
               susp      yes      <u>CHAR</u> will send a terminal “stop” signal
               swtch     no       <u>CHAR</u> will switch to a different shell layer.
               tabs      yes      <u>Mode</u> disables tab-expansion.
               -tabs     yes      <u>Mode</u> enables tab-expansion.
               weras     no       <u>CHAR</u> will erase the last word typed.

               Control characters may be specified as ^char (e.g., ^c or ^u) and <b>^?</b>  may  be  used  to  indicate
               delete (127).  Use <b>^-</b> to denote <u>undef</u>.  Use <b>\034</b> to represent <b>^\</b>, since a literal backslash in an
               X resource escapes the next character.

               This  is  very  useful for overriding the default terminal settings without having to run <b><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></b>(1)
               every time an <u>xterm</u> is started.  Note, however, that the <u>stty</u> program on a  given  host  may  use
               different  keywords;  <u>xterm</u>'s  table  is built in.  The <u>POSIX</u> column in the table indicates which
               keywords are supported by a standard <u>stty</u> program.

               If the <b>ttyModes</b> resource specifies a value for <b>erase</b>, that overrides the <b>ptyInitialErase</b> resource
               setting, i.e., <u>xterm</u> initializes the terminal to match that value.

       <b>useInsertMode</b> (class <b>UseInsertMode</b>)
               Force use of insert mode by adding appropriate entries to the TERMCAP environment variable.  This
               is useful if the system termcap is broken.  (This resource is ignored on  most  systems,  because
               TERMCAP is not used).  The default is “false”.

       <b>utmpDisplayId</b> (class <b>UtmpDisplayId</b>)
               Specifies  whether  or  not <u>xterm</u> should try to record the display identifier (display number and
               screen number) as well as the hostname in the system <u>utmp</u> log file.  The default is “true”.

       <b>utmpInhibit</b> (class <b>UtmpInhibit</b>)
               Specifies whether or not <u>xterm</u> should try to record the user's terminal in the  system  <u>utmp</u>  log
               file.  If true, <u>xterm</u> will not try.  The default is “false”.

       <b>validShells</b> (class <b>ValidShells</b>)
               Augment  (add  to)  the  system's  <u><a href="file:/etc/shells">/etc/shells</a></u>,  when  determining  whether  to  set  the “SHELL”
               environment variable when running a given program.

               The resource value is a list of lines (separated by newlines).  Each  line  holds  one  pathname.
               <u>Xterm</u>  ignores  any  line beginning with “#” after trimming leading/trailing whitespace from each
               line.

               The default is an empty string.

       <b>waitForMap</b> (class <b>WaitForMap</b>)
               Specifies whether or not <u>xterm</u> should wait  for  the  initial  window  map  before  starting  the
               subprocess.   This  is  part  of  the <b>ptyHandshake</b> logic.  When <u>xterm</u> is directed to wait in this
               fashion, it passes the terminal size from the display end of the pseudo-terminal to the  terminal
               I/O  connection,  e.g.,  using  the size according to the window manager.  Otherwise, it uses the
               size as given in resource values or command-line option <b>-geometry</b>.  The default is “false”.

       <b>zIconBeep</b> (class <b>ZIconBeep</b>)
               Same as -ziconbeep command line argument.  If the value of this resource is non-zero, xterms that
               produce output while iconified will cause an XBell sound at the  given  volume  and  have  “*** ”
               prepended  to  their  icon  titles.   Most  window  managers will detect this change immediately,
               showing you which window has the output.  (A similar feature was in x10 <u>xterm</u>.)  The  default  is
               “false”.

       <b>zIconTitleFormat</b> (class <b>ZIconTitleFormat</b>)
               Allow customization of the string used in the <b>zIconBeep</b> feature.  The default value is “*** %s”.

               If  the  resource  value  contains a “%s”, then <u>xterm</u> inserts the icon title at that point rather
               than prepending the string to the icon title.  (Only the first “%s” is used).

   <b>VT100</b> <b>Widget</b> <b>Resources</b>
       The following resources are specified as part of the <u>vt100</u> widget (class <u>VT100</u>).  They are  specified  by
       patterns such as “<b>XTerm.vt100.</b><u>NAME</u>”.

       If  your  <u>xterm</u>  is  configured to support the “toolbar”, then those patterns need an extra level for the
       form-widget which holds the toolbar and vt100 widget.  A wildcard between the top-level “XTerm”  and  the
       “vt100” widget makes the resource settings work for either, e.g., “<b>XTerm*vt100.</b><u>NAME</u>”.

       <b>activeIcon</b> (class <b>ActiveIcon</b>)
               Specifies  whether  or not active icon windows are to be used when the <u>xterm</u> window is iconified,
               if this feature is compiled into <u>xterm</u>.  The active icon is a  miniature  representation  of  the
               content  of  the  window  and  will  update  as  the  content  changes.   Not all window managers
               necessarily support application icon windows.  Some window  managers  will  allow  you  to  enter
               keystrokes into the active icon window.  The default is “default”.

               <u>Xterm</u> accepts either a keyword (ignoring case) or the number shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                      No active icon is shown.

               true (1)
                      The active icon is shown.  If you are using <u>twm</u>, use this setting to enable active-icons.

               default (2)
                      <u>Xterm</u>  checks  at  startup, and shows an active icon only for window managers which it can
                      identify and which are known to support the feature.  These are <u>fvwm</u> (full  support),  and
                      <u>window</u> <u>maker</u> (limited).  A few other window managers (such as <u>twm</u> and <u>ctwm</u>) support active
                      icons, but do not support the extensions which allow <u>xterm</u> to identify the window manager.

       <b>allowBoldFonts</b> (class <b>AllowBoldFonts</b>)
               When  set  to “false”, <u>xterm</u> will not use bold fonts.  This overrides both the <b>alwaysBoldMode</b> and
               the <b>boldMode</b> resources.

       <b>allowC1Printable</b> (class <b>AllowC1Printable</b>)
               If true, overrides the mapping of C1 controls (codes 128–159) to make them be treated as if  they
               were  printable  characters.   Although  this  corresponds  to no particular standard, some users
               insist it is a VT100.  The default is “false”.

       <b>allowColorOps</b> (class <b>AllowColorOps</b>)
               Specifies whether control sequences that set/query the dynamic colors should  be  allowed.   ANSI
               colors are unaffected by this resource setting.  The default is “true”.

       <b>allowFontOps</b> (class <b>AllowFontOps</b>)
               Specifies  whether  control  sequences that set/query the font should be allowed.  The default is
               “false”.

       <b>allowMouseOps</b> (class <b>AllowMouseOps</b>)
               Specifies whether control sequences that enable <u>xterm</u> to send escape sequences  to  the  host  on
               mouse-clicks and movement.  The default is “true”.

       <b>allowPasteControls</b> (class <b>AllowPasteControls</b>)
               If  true, allow control characters such as BEL and CAN to be pasted.  Formatting characters (tab,
               newline) are normally allowed, unless suppressed via the <b>disallowedPasteControls</b> resource.  Other
               C0 control characters are suppressed unless this resource is enabled.  The exact set  of  control
               characters   (C0  and  C1)  depends  upon  whether  UTF-8  encoding  is  used,  as  well  as  the
               <b>allowC1Printable</b> and <b>disallowedPasteControls</b> resources.  The default is “false”.

       <b>allowScrollLock</b> (class <b>AllowScrollLock</b>)
               Specifies whether control sequences that set/query the Scroll Lock key should be allowed, as well
               as whether the Scroll Lock key responds to user's keypress.  The default is “false”.

               When this feature is enabled, <u>xterm</u> will sense the state of the Scroll  Lock  key  each  time  it
               acquires focus.  Pressing the Scroll Lock key toggles <u>xterm</u>'s internal state, as well as toggling
               the  associated  LED.   While the Scroll Lock is active, <u>xterm</u> attempts to keep a viewport on the
               same set of lines.  If the current viewport is scrolled past  the  limit  set  by  the  <b>saveLines</b>
               resource, then Scroll Lock has no further effect.

               The  reason  for setting the default to “false” is to avoid user surprise.  This key is generally
               unused in keyboard configurations, and has not acquired a standard meaning even when it  is  used
               in that manner.  Consequently, users have assigned it for ad hoc purposes.

               See also the <b>autoScrollLock</b> resource.

       <b>allowSendEvents</b> (class <b>AllowSendEvents</b>)
               Specifies  whether  or  not  synthetic  key  and  button  events  (generated using the X protocol
               SendEvent request) should be interpreted or discarded.  The default is “false” meaning  they  are
               discarded.   Note  that  allowing  such events would create a very large security hole, therefore
               enabling this resource forcefully disables the <b>allow</b><u>XXX</u><b>Ops</b> resources.  The default is “false”.

       <b>allowTcapOps</b> (class <b>AllowTcapOps</b>)
               Specifies whether control sequences that query the terminal's notion of its function-key strings,
               as termcap or terminfo capabilities should be allowed.  The default is “true”.

               A few programs, e.g., <u>vim</u>, use this feature to get an  accurate  description  of  the  terminal's
               capabilities, independent of the termcap/terminfo setting:

               •   <u>Xterm</u>  can  tell  the  querying  program  how  many  colors it supports.  This is a constant,
                   depending on how it is compiled, typically 16.  It does not  change  if  you  alter  resource
                   settings, e.g., the <b>boldColors</b> resource.

               •   <u>Xterm</u>  can  tell  the  querying  program what strings are sent by modified (shift-, control-,
                   alt-) function- and keypad-keys.  Reporting control- and  alt-modifiers  is  a  feature  that
                   relies on the <u>ncurses</u> extended naming.

       <b>allowTitleOps</b> (class <b>AllowTitleOps</b>)
               Specifies  whether control sequences that modify the window title or icon name should be allowed.
               The default is “true”.

       <b>allowWindowOps</b> (class <b>AllowWindowOps</b>)
               Specifies whether extended window control sequences (as used in <u>dtterm</u>) should be allowed.  These
               include several control sequences which manipulate the  window  size  or  position,  as  well  as
               reporting  these  values  and  the  title or icon name.  Each of these can be abused in a script;
               curiously enough most terminal emulators that implement these restrict only a small part  of  the
               repertoire.  For fine-tuning, see <b>disallowedWindowOps</b>.  The default is “false”.

       <b>altIsNotMeta</b> (class <b>AltIsNotMeta</b>)
               If  “true”,  treat  the  Alt-key  as  if  it  were  the Meta-key.  Your keyboard may happen to be
               configured so they are the same.  But if they are not, this allows you to use  the  same  prefix-
               and  shifting  operations  with  the  Alt-key  as  with  the  Meta-key.   See  <b>altSendsEscape</b> and
               <b>metaSendsEscape</b>.  The default is “false”.

       <b>altSendsEscape</b> (class <b>AltSendsEscape</b>)
               This  is  an  additional  keyboard  operation  that  may  be  processed  after  the   logic   for
               <b>metaSendsEscape</b>.  It is only available if the <b>altIsNotMeta</b> resource is set.

               •   If  “true”, Alt characters (a character combined with the modifier associated with left/right
                   Alt-keys) are converted into a two-character sequence with the character itself  preceded  by
                   ESC.   This  applies as well to function key control sequences, unless <u>xterm</u> sees that <b>Alt</b> is
                   used in your key translations.

               •   If “false”, Alt characters input from the keyboard cause a shift to  8-bit  characters  (just
                   like   <b>metaSendsEscape</b>).    By   combining  the  Alt-  and  Meta-modifiers,  you  can  create
                   corresponding combinations of ESC-prefix and 8-bit characters.

               The default is “False”.  <u>Xterm</u> provides a menu option for toggling this resource.

       <b>alternateScroll</b> (class <b>ScrollCond</b>)
               If “true”, the <b>scroll-back</b> and <b>scroll-forw</b> actions send cursor-up and -down keys  when  <u>xterm</u>  is
               displaying the alternate screen.  The default is “false”.

               The <b>alternateScroll</b> state can also be set using a control sequence.

       <b>alwaysBoldMode</b> (class <b>AlwaysBoldMode</b>)
               Specifies  whether  <u>xterm</u>  should check if the normal and bold fonts are distinct before deciding
               whether to use overstriking to simulate bold fonts.  If this resource is  true,  <u>xterm</u>  does  not
               make the check for distinct fonts when deciding how to handle the <b>boldMode</b> resource.  The default
               is “false”.
               <u>boldMode</u>   <u>alwaysBoldMode</u>   <u>Comparison</u>   <u>Action</u>
               ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
               false      false            ignored      use font
               false      true             ignored      use font
               true       false            same         overstrike
               true       false            different    use font
               true       true             ignored      overstrike

               This resource is used only for bitmap fonts:

               •   When  using  bitmap fonts, it is possible that the font server will approximate the bold font
                   by rescaling it from a different font size than expected.  The <b>alwaysBoldMode</b> resource allows
                   the user to override the (sometimes poor) resulting bold font with overstriking (which is  at
                   least consistent).

               •   The  problem does not occur with TrueType fonts (though there can be other unnecessary issues
                   such as different coverage of the normal and bold fonts).

               As an alternative, setting the <b>allowBoldFonts</b> resource to false overrides both the <b>alwaysBoldMode</b>
               and the <b>boldMode</b> resources.

       <b>alwaysHighlight</b> (class <b>AlwaysHighlight</b>)
               Specifies whether or not <u>xterm</u> should always display a highlighted text cursor.  By  default  (if
               this  resource is false), a hollow text cursor is displayed whenever the pointer moves out of the
               window or the window loses the input focus.  The default is “false”.

       <b>alwaysUseMods</b> (class <b>AlwaysUseMods</b>)
               Override the <b>numLock</b> resource, telling <u>xterm</u> to use the  Alt  and  Meta  modifiers  to  construct
               parameters  for  function  key  sequences  even  if  those  modifiers  appear in the translations
               resource.  Normally <u>xterm</u> checks if Alt or Meta is used in a translation that would conflict with
               function key modifiers, and will ignore these modifiers in that special  case.   The  default  is
               “false”.

       <b>answerbackString</b> (class <b>AnswerbackString</b>)
               Specifies  the string that <u>xterm</u> sends in response to an ENQ (control/E) character from the host.
               The default is a blank string, i.e., “”.  A hardware VT100 implements this  feature  as  a  setup
               option.

       <b>appcursorDefault</b> (class <b>AppcursorDefault</b>)
               If  “true”,  the  cursor  keys  are initially in application mode.  This is the same as the VT102
               private DECCKM mode, The default is “false”.

       <b>appkeypadDefault</b> (class <b>AppkeypadDefault</b>)
               If “true”, the keypad keys are initially in application mode.  The default is “false”.

       <b>assumeAllChars</b> (class <b>AssumeAllChars</b>)
               If “true”, this enables a special case in bitmap fonts to allow the font server to choose how  to
               display missing glyphs.  The default is “true”.

               The reason for this resource is to help with certain quasi-automatically generated fonts (such as
               the ISO-10646-1 encoding of Terminus) which have incorrect font-metrics.

       <b>autoScrollLock</b> (class <b>AutoScrollLock</b>)
               If “true”, <u>xterm</u> will maintain its viewport of displayed lines whenever displaying scrollback, as
               if  <b>allowScrollLock</b>  were  enabled  and  the  Scroll  Lock  key had been pressed.  The default is
               “false”.  This feature is only useful if the <b>scrollTtyOutput</b> resource is set to “false”.

       <b>autoWrap</b> (class <b>AutoWrap</b>)
               Specifies whether or not auto-wraparound should be enabled.   This  is  the  same  as  the  VT102
               DECAWM.  The default is “true”.

       <b>awaitInput</b> (class <b>AwaitInput</b>)
               Specifies whether or not <u>xterm</u> uses a 50 millisecond timeout to await input (i.e., to support the
               <u>Xaw3d</u> arrow scrollbar).  The default is “false”.

       <b>backarrowKey</b> (class <b>BackarrowKey</b>)
               Specifies  whether  the  backarrow key transmits a backspace (8) or delete (127) character.  This
               corresponds to the DECBKM control sequence.  A “true” value specifies backspace.  The default  is
               “True”.  Pressing the control key toggles this behavior.

       <b>background</b> (class <b>Background</b>)
               Specifies   the   color   to   use   for   the   background   of  the  window.   The  default  is
               “XtDefaultBackground”.

       <b>bellIsUrgent</b> (class <b>BellIsUrgent</b>)
               Specifies whether to set the Urgency hint for the window manager when making a bell  sound.   The
               default is “false”.

       <b>bellOnReset</b> (class <b>BellOnReset</b>)
               Specifies whether to sound a bell when doing a hard reset.  The default is “true”.

       <b>bellSuppressTime</b> (class <b>BellSuppressTime</b>)
               Number  of  milliseconds  after  a  bell  command  is  sent during which additional bells will be
               suppressed.  Default is 200.  If set non-zero, additional bells will also be suppressed until the
               server reports that processing of the first bell has been completed; this feature is most  useful
               with the visible bell.

       <b>boldColors</b> (class <b>ColorMode</b>)
               Specifies  whether  to  combine  bold  attribute  with colors like the IBM PC, i.e., map colors 0
               through 7 to colors 8 through 15.  These normally are  the  brighter  versions  of  the  first  8
               colors, hence bold.  The default is “true”.

       <b>boldFont</b> (class <b>BoldFont</b>)
               Specifies the name of the bold font to use instead of overstriking.  There is no default for this
               resource.

               This font must be the same height and width as the normal font, otherwise it is ignored.  If only
               one  of  the  normal  or bold fonts is specified, it will be used as the normal font and the bold
               font will be produced by overstriking this font.

               See also the discussion of <b>boldMode</b> and <b>alwaysBoldMode</b> resources.

       <b>boldMode</b> (class <b>BoldMode</b>)
               This specifies whether or not text with the bold attribute should be overstruck to simulate  bold
               fonts  if  the resolved bold font is the same as the normal font.  It may be desirable to disable
               bold fonts when color is being used for the bold attribute.

               Note that <u>xterm</u> has one bold font which you may set explicitly.  <u>Xterm</u> attempts to derive a  bold
               font for the other font selections (<b>font1</b> through <b>font7</b>).  If it cannot find a bold font, it will
               use  the  normal  font.  In each case (whether the explicit resource or the derived font), if the
               normal and bold fonts are distinct, this resource has no effect.  The default is “true”.

               See the <b>alwaysBoldMode</b> resource which can modify the behavior of this resource.

               Although <u>xterm</u> attempts to derive a bold font for other font selections, the font server may  not
               cooperate.   Since  X11R6,  bitmap fonts have been scaled.  The font server claims to provide the
               bold font that <u>xterm</u> requests, but the result is  not  always  readable.   XFree86  introduced  a
               feature  which  can be used to suppress the scaling.  In the X server's configuration file (e.g.,
               “/etc/X11/XFree86” or “/etc/X11/xorg.conf”), you can add “:unscaled” to the end of the  directory
               specification  for the “misc” fonts, which comprise the fixed-pitch fonts that are used by <u>xterm</u>.
               For example

                   FontPath  "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/"

               would become

                   FontPath  "/usr/lib/X11/fonts/misc/:unscaled"

               Depending on your configuration, the font server may have its own configuration file.   The  same
               “:unscaled”  can be added to its configuration file at the end of the directory specification for
               “misc”.

               The bitmap scaling feature is also used by <u>xterm</u> to  implement  VT102  double-width  and  double-
               height characters.

       <b>brokenLinuxOSC</b> (class <b>BrokenLinuxOSC</b>)
               If  true,  <u>xterm</u>  applies  a workaround to ignore malformed control sequences that a Linux script
               might send.  Compare the palette control sequences documented in <u>console_codes</u> with ECMA-48.  The
               default is “true”.

       <b>brokenSelections</b> (class <b>BrokenSelections</b>)
               If true, <u>xterm</u> in 8-bit mode will interpret <b>STRING</b> selections as carrying  text  in  the  current
               locale's  encoding.   Normally  <b>STRING</b>  selections  carry  ISO-8859-1 encoded text.  Setting this
               resource to “true” violates the ICCCM; it may, however,  be  useful  for  interacting  with  some
               broken X clients.  The default is “false”.

       <b>brokenStringTerm</b> (class <b>BrokenStringTerm</b>)
               provides  a  work-around  for some ISDN routers which start an application control string without
               completing it.  Set this to “true” if <u>xterm</u> appears to freeze when connecting.   The  default  is
               “false”.

               <u>Xterm</u>'s state parser recognizes several types of control strings which can contain text, e.g.,

               <b>APC</b> (Application Program Command),
               <b>DCS</b> (Device Control String),
               <b>OSC</b> (Operating System Command),
               <b>PM</b> (Privacy Message), and
               <b>SOS</b> (Start of String),

               Each  should  end  with  a  string-terminator  (a  special character which cannot appear in these
               strings).  Ordinary control characters  found  within  the  string  are  not  ignored;  they  are
               processed  without  interfering  with  the  process of accumulating the control string's content.
               <u>Xterm</u> recognizes these controls in all modes, although some of the functions  may  be  suppressed
               after parsing the control.

               When  enabled,  this feature allows the user to exit from an unterminated control string when any
               of these ordinary control characters are found:

               control/D (used as an end of file in many shells),
               control/H (backspace),
               control/I (tab-feed),
               control/J (line feed aka newline),
               control/K (vertical tab),
               control/L (form feed),
               control/M (carriage return),
               control/N (shift-out),
               control/O (shift-in),
               control/Q (XOFF),
               control/X (cancel)

       <b>c132</b> (class <b>C132</b>)
               Specifies whether or not the VT102 DECCOLM escape sequence, used to switch  between  80  and  132
               columns, should be honored.  The default is “false”.

       <b>cacheDoublesize</b> (class <b>CacheDoublesize</b>)
               Tells  whether  to  cache  double-sized fonts by <u>xterm</u>.  Set this to zero to disable double-sized
               fonts altogether.

       <b>cdXtraScroll</b> (class <b>CdXtraScroll</b>)
               Specifies whether <u>xterm</u> should scroll to a  new  page  when  clearing  the  whole  screen.   Like
               <b>tiXtraScroll</b>,  the intent of this option is to provide a picture of the full-screen application's
               display on the scrollback before wiping out the text.

               <u>Xterm</u> accepts either a keyword (ignoring case) or the number shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                      nothing is added to the scrollback.

               true (1)
                      the current screen is added to the scrollback.

               trim (2)
                      the current screen is added to the  scrollback,  but  repeated  blank  lines  are  trimmed
                      (reduced to a single blank line).

               The default for this resource is “false”.

       <b>charClass</b> (class <b>CharClass</b>)
               Specifies comma-separated lists of character class bindings of the form

                   <u>low</u>[-<u>high]</u>[:<u>value</u>].

               These  are used in determining which sets of characters should be treated the same when doing cut
               and paste.  See the <b>CHARACTER</b> <b>CLASSES</b> section.

       <b>checksumExtension</b> (class <b>ChecksumExtension</b>)
               DEC VT420 and up support a control sequence <b>DECRQCRA</b> which reports the checksum of the characters
               in a rectangle.  <u>Xterm</u> supports this, with extensions that can be configured  with  bits  of  the
               <b>checksumExtension</b>:

               0    do not negate the result.

               1    do not report the VT100 video attributes.

               2    do not omit checksum for blanks.

               3    omit checksum for cells not explicitly initialized.

               4    do not mask cell value to 8 bits or ignore combining characters.

               5    do not mask cell value to 7 bits.

               With  the  default  value  (0),  <u>xterm</u>  matches  the  behavior  of  DEC's  terminals.  To use all
               extensions, set all bits, “-1” for example.

       <b>cjkWidth</b> (class <b>CjkWidth</b>)
               Specifies whether <u>xterm</u> should follow the traditional East Asian width convention.   When  turned
               on,  characters  with  East Asian Ambiguous (A) category in UTR 11 have a column width of 2.  You
               may have to set this option to “true” if you have some old East  Asian  terminal  based  programs
               that  assume  that  line-drawing characters have a column width of 2.  If this resource is false,
               the <b>mkWidth</b> resource controls the choice between the system's  <b><a href="../man3/wcwidth.3.html">wcwidth</a></b>(3)  and  <u>xterm</u>'s  built-in
               tables.  The default is “false”.

       <b>color0</b> (class <b>Color0</b>)

       <b>color1</b> (class <b>Color1</b>)

       <b>color2</b> (class <b>Color2</b>)

       <b>color3</b> (class <b>Color3</b>)

       <b>color4</b> (class <b>Color4</b>)

       <b>color5</b> (class <b>Color5</b>)

       <b>color6</b> (class <b>Color6</b>)

       <b>color7</b> (class <b>Color7</b>)
               These  specify  the  colors  for  the ISO-6429 extension.  The defaults are, respectively, black,
               red3, green3, yellow3, a customizable dark blue, magenta3, cyan3, and gray90.  The default shades
               of color are chosen to allow the colors 8–15 to be used as brighter versions.

       <b>color8</b> (class <b>Color8</b>)

       <b>color9</b> (class <b>Color9</b>)

       <b>color10</b> (class <b>Color10</b>)

       <b>color11</b> (class <b>Color11</b>)

       <b>color12</b> (class <b>Color12</b>)

       <b>color13</b> (class <b>Color13</b>)

       <b>color14</b> (class <b>Color14</b>)

       <b>color15</b> (class <b>Color15</b>)
               These specify the colors for the ISO-6429 extension if the bold attribute is also  enabled.   The
               default  resource  values  are respectively, gray50, red, green, yellow, a customized light blue,
               magenta, cyan, and white.

       <b>color16</b> (class <b>Color16</b>)

       through

       <b>color255</b> (class <b>Color255</b>)
               These specify the colors for the 256-color extension.  The default resource values are for

               •   colors 16 through 231 to make a 6x6x6 color cube, and

               •   colors 232 through 255 to make a grayscale ramp.

               Resources past <b>color15</b> are available as a compile-time option.  Due to a hardcoded limit in the X
               libraries on the total number of resources (to 400), the resources  for  256-colors  are  omitted
               when  wide-character support and <u>luit</u> are enabled.  Besides inconsistent behavior if only part of
               the resources were allowed, determining the exact cutoff is difficult, and the X  libraries  tend
               to crash if the number of resources exceeds the limit.  The color palette is still initialized to
               the same default values, and can be modified via control sequences.

               On the other hand, the resource limit does permit including the entire range for 88-colors.

       <b>colorAttrMode</b> (class <b>ColorAttrMode</b>)
               Specifies  whether  <b>colorBD</b>,  <b>colorBL</b>, <b>colorRV</b>, and <b>colorUL</b> should override ANSI colors.  If not,
               these are displayed only when no ANSI colors have been set for the corresponding  position.   The
               default is “false”.

       <b>colorBD</b> (class <b>ColorBD</b>)
               This  specifies  the  color  to  use  to display bold characters if the “colorBDMode” resource is
               enabled.  The default is “XtDefaultForeground”.

               See also the <b>veryBoldColors</b> resource which allows combining bold and color.

       <b>colorBDMode</b> (class <b>ColorAttrMode</b>)
               Specifies whether characters with the bold attribute should be displayed  in  color  or  as  bold
               characters.  Note that setting <b>colorMode</b> off disables all colors, including bold.  The default is
               “false”.

       <b>colorBL</b> (class <b>ColorBL</b>)
               This  specifies  the  color  to  use to display blink characters if the “colorBLMode” resource is
               enabled.  The default is “XtDefaultForeground”.

               See also the <b>veryBoldColors</b> resource which allows combining underline and color.

       <b>colorBLMode</b> (class <b>ColorAttrMode</b>)
               Specifies whether characters with the blink attribute should be displayed in  color.   Note  that
               setting <b>colorMode</b> off disables all colors, including this.  The default is “false”.

       <b>colorEvents</b> (class <b>ColorEvents</b>)
               Specifies  OSC  control  codes  that  can  be  processed  from  client  messages  with  the  type
               <b>XTERM_CONTROL</b>.  These events may be generated  using  the  X  protocol  SendEvent  request.   The
               resource  value  is  a  comma  separated list of codes allowed.  The default is the empty string,
               disallowing all processing.

               The names are listed below.  <u>Xterm</u> ignores capitalization, but they are shown in  mixed-case  for
               clarity.  Either a name or a number can be used.

               TEXT_FG (10)
                    text foreground

               TEXT_BG (11)
                    text background

               TEXT_CURSOR (12)
                    text cursor

               MOUSE_FG (13)
                    mouse foreground

               MOUSE_BG (14)
                    mouse background

               TEK_FG (15)
                    tektronix foreground

               TEK_BG (16)
                    tektronix background

               HIGHLIGHT_BG (17)
                    highlight background

               TEK_CURSOR (18)
                    tektronix cursor

               HIGHLIGHT_FG (19)
                    highlight foreground

               For example, if messages for the text color are enabled, e.g., by setting the resource to

                   text_fg, text_bg

               the text foreground color can be set to black by sending a message with this content:

                   10;#000000

       <b>colorIT</b> (class <b>ColorIT</b>)
               This  specifies  the  color  to use to display italic characters if the “colorITMode” resource is
               enabled.  The default is “XtDefaultForeground”.

               See also the <b>veryBoldColors</b> resource which allows combining attributes and color.

       <b>colorITMode</b> (class <b>ColorAttrMode</b>)
               Specifies whether characters with the italic attribute should be displayed in color or as  italic
               characters.  The default is “false”.

               Note that:

               •   Setting <b>colorMode</b> off disables all colors, including italic.

               •   The <b>italicULMode</b> resource overrides <b>colorITMode</b>.

       <b>colorInnerBorder</b> (class <b>ColorInnerBorder</b>)
               Normally, <u>xterm</u> fills the VT100 window's inner border using the background color.

               If  the  <b>colorInnerBorder</b>  resource is enabled, at startup <u>xterm</u> will compare the <b>borderColor</b> and
               the window's background color.  If those are different, <u>xterm</u> will use the  <b>borderColor</b>  resource
               to fill the inner border.  Otherwise, it will use the window's background color.

               The default is “false”.

       <b>colorMode</b> (class <b>ColorMode</b>)
               Specifies  whether  or not recognition of ANSI (ISO-6429) color change escape sequences should be
               enabled.  The default is “true”.

       <b>colorRV</b> (class <b>ColorRV</b>)
               This specifies the color to use to display reverse characters if the  “colorRVMode”  resource  is
               enabled.  The default is “XtDefaultForeground”.

               See also the <b>veryBoldColors</b> resource which allows combining reverse and color.

       <b>colorRVMode</b> (class <b>ColorAttrMode</b>)
               Specifies  whether characters with the reverse attribute should be displayed in color.  Note that
               setting <b>colorMode</b> off disables all colors, including this.  The default is “false”.

       <b>colorUL</b> (class <b>ColorUL</b>)
               This specifies the color to use to display underlined characters if the “colorULMode” resource is
               enabled.  The default is “XtDefaultForeground”.

               See also the <b>veryBoldColors</b> resource which allows combining underline and color.

       <b>colorULMode</b> (class <b>ColorAttrMode</b>)
               Specifies whether characters with the underline attribute should be  displayed  in  color  or  as
               underlined   characters.   Note  that  setting  <b>colorMode</b>  off  disables  all  colors,  including
               underlining.  The default is “false”.

       <b>combiningChars</b> (class <b>CombiningChars</b>)
               Specifies the number of wide-characters which can be stored in a  cell  to  overstrike  (combine)
               with the base character of the cell.  This can be set to values in the range 0 to 5.  The default
               is “2”.

       <b>ctrlFKeys</b> (class <b>CtrlFKeys</b>)
               In  VT220 keyboard mode (see <b>sunKeyboard</b> resource), specifies the amount by which to shift F1-F12
               given a control modifier (CTRL).  This allows you to generate key symbols for F10-F20 on a Sun/PC
               keyboard.  The default is “10”, which means that CTRL F1 generates the key symbol for F11.

       <b>curses</b> (class <b>Curses</b>)
               Specifies whether or not the last column bug in <u><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></u>(1) should be worked  around.   See  the  <b>-cu</b>
               option for details.  The default is “false”.

       <b>cursorBar</b> (class <b>CursorBar</b>)
               Specifies  whether to make the cursor a left-bar or a box, unless the <b>cursorUnderLine</b> resource is
               set.  The default is “false”.

       <b>cursorBlink</b> (class <b>CursorBlink</b>)
               Specifies whether to make the cursor blink.  <u>Xterm</u> accepts either a keyword  (ignoring  case)  or
               the number shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                  The  cursor  will  not  blink,  but  may  be  combined  with escape sequences according to the
                  <b>cursorBlinkXOR</b> resource.

               true (1)
                  The  cursor  will  blink,  but  may  be  combined  with  escape  sequences  according  to  the
                  <b>cursorBlinkXOR</b> resource.

               always (2)
                  The cursor will always blink, ignoring escape sequences.  The menu entry will be disabled.

               never (3)
                  The cursor will never blink, ignoring escape sequences.  The menu entry will be disabled.

               The default is “false”.

       <b>cursorBlinkXOR</b> (class <b>CursorBlinkXOR</b>)
               <u>Xterm</u> uses two inputs to determine whether the cursor blinks:

               •   The <b>cursorBlink</b> resource (which can be altered with a menu entry).

               •   Control sequences (private mode 12 and DECSCUSR).

               The <b>cursorBlinkXOR</b> resource determines how those inputs are combined:

               false
                    <u>Xterm</u>  uses  the  logical-OR of the two variables.  If either is set, <u>xterm</u> makes the cursor
                    blink.

               true
                    <u>Xterm</u> uses the logical-XOR of the two variables.  If only one is set, <u>xterm</u> makes the cursor
                    blink.

               The default is “true”.

       <b>cursorColor</b> (class <b>CursorColor</b>)
               Specifies the color to use for the  text  cursor.   The  default  is  “XtDefaultForeground”.   By
               default,  <u>xterm</u> attempts to keep this color from being the same as the background color, since it
               draws the cursor by filling the background of a text  cell.   The  same  restriction  applies  to
               control sequences which may change this color.

               Setting  this  resource overrides most of <u>xterm</u>'s adjustments to cursor color.  It will still use
               reverse-video to disallow some cases, such as a black cursor on a black background.

       <b>cursorOffTime</b> (class <b>CursorOffTime</b>)
               Specifies the duration of the “off” part of the cursor blink  cycle-time  in  milliseconds.   The
               same timer is used for text blinking.  The default is “300”.

       <b>cursorOnTime</b> (class <b>CursorOnTime</b>)
               Specifies  the  duration  of  the “on” part of the cursor blink cycle-time, in milliseconds.  The
               same timer is used for text blinking.  The default is “600”.

       <b>cursorUnderLine</b> (class <b>CursorUnderLine</b>)
               Specifies whether to make the cursor underlined or  a  box.   If  unset  (false),  the  <b>cursorBar</b>
               resource may set the cursor shape.  The default is “false”.

       <b>cutNewline</b> (class <b>CutNewline</b>)
               If “false”, triple clicking to select a line does not include the <u>newline</u> at the end of the line.
               If “true”, the Newline is selected.  The default is “true”.

       <b>cutToBeginningOfLine</b> (class <b>CutToBeginningOfLine</b>)
               If  “false”,  triple  clicking  to  select a line selects only from the current word forward.  If
               “true”, the entire line is selected.  The default is “true”.

       <b>decGraphicsID</b> (class <b>DecGraphicsID</b>)
               Allows a way to combine the graphics feature from certain DEC terminals (125, 240, 241, 330,  340
               or  382)  with  other  emulation  levels  which  did  not  provide  the  graphics feature.  As in
               <b>decTerminalID</b>, leading non-digit characters are ignored, e.g., “vt340” and “340” are the same.

               If the resource value is nonzero, <u>xterm</u> uses that emulation level when initializing  the  drawing
               region and decoding control sequences to draw graphics.

               The default is “0”.

       <b>decTerminalID</b> (class <b>DecTerminalID</b>)
               Specifies  the  emulation  level  (100=VT100,  220=VT220,  etc.),  used  to determine the type of
               response to a DA control sequence.  Leading non-digit characters are ignored, e.g.,  “vt100”  and
               “100” are the same.  The default is “420”.

       <b>defaultString</b> (class <b>DefaultString</b>)
               Specify  the  character  (or  string)  which  <u>xterm</u>  will  substitute when pasted text includes a
               character which cannot be represented in the current encoding.  For instance, pasting UTF-8  text
               into  a  display  of  ISO-8859-1 characters will only be able to display codes 0–255, while UTF-8
               text can include Unicode values above 255.  The default is “#” (a single pound sign).

               If the undisplayable text would be double-width, <u>xterm</u> will add a space after the “#”  character,
               to give roughly the same layout on the screen as the original text.

       <b>deleteIsDEL</b> (class <b>DeleteIsDEL</b>)
               Specifies what the <u>Delete</u> key on the editing keypad should send when pressed.  The resource value
               is  a  string,  evaluated  as  a  boolean  after  startup.  <u>Xterm</u> uses it in conjunction with the
               <b>keyboardType</b> resource:

               •   If the keyboard type is “default”, or “vt220” and the resource is either  “true”  or  “maybe”
                   send the VT220-style <u>Remove</u> escape sequence.  Otherwise, send DEL (127).

               •   If  the  keyboard type is “legacy”, and the resource is “true” send DEL.  Otherwise, send the
                   <u>Remove</u> sequence.

               •   Otherwise, if the keyboard type is none of these special cases, send DEL (127).

               The default is “Maybe”.  The resource is allowed to be a non-boolean “maybe” so  that  the  popup
               menu <b>Delete</b> <b>is</b> <b>DEL</b> entry does not override the keyboard type.

       <b>directColor</b> (class <b>DirectColor</b>)
               Specifies whether to handle direct-color control sequences using the X server's available colors,
               or  to  approximate those using a color map with 256 entries.  A “true” value enables the former.
               The default is “true”.

       <b>disallowedColorOps</b> (class <b>DisallowedColorOps</b>)
               Specify which features will be disabled if <b>allowColorOps</b> is false.   This  is  a  comma-separated
               list of names.  The default value is
               SetColor,GetColor,GetAnsiColor

               The  names  are listed below.  <u>Xterm</u> ignores capitalization, but they are shown in mixed-case for
               clarity.

       <b>disallowedFontOps</b> (class <b>DisallowedFontOps</b>)
               Specify which features will be disabled if <b>allowFontOps</b> is false.  This is a comma-separated list
               of names.  The default value is

                   SetFont,GetFont

               The  names  are listed below.  <u>Xterm</u> ignores capitalization, but they are shown in mixed-case for
               clarity.

               SetFont
                    Set the specified font.

               GetFont

       <b>disallowedMouseOps</b> (class <b>DisallowedMouseOps</b>)
               Specify which features will be disabled if <b>allowMouseOps</b> is false.   This  is  a  comma-separated
               list  of  names.   The default value is “*” which matches all names.  The names are listed below.
               <u>Xterm</u> ignores capitalization, but they are shown in mixed-case for clarity.

                    This overrides the <b>alternateScroll</b> resource.

       <b>disallowedPasteControls</b> (class <b>DisallowedPasteControls</b>)
               Use this resource to disallow pasting specific C0 control characters when the  <b>allowPasteControls</b>
               resource is false (i.e., the default).  This resource defines the set of control characters which
               cannot be pasted, converting each into a space.  Other C0 controls are pasted without change.

               The  resource  value  is  a  comma-separated  list  of names.  <u>Xterm</u> ignores capitalization.  The
               default value is

       <b>disallowedTcapOps</b> (class <b>DisallowedTcapOps</b>)
               Specify which features will be disabled if <b>allowTcapOps</b> is false.  This is a comma-separated list
               of names.  The default value is

                   SetTcap,GetTcap

               The  names  are listed below.  <u>Xterm</u> ignores capitalization, but they are shown in mixed-case for

       <b>disallowedWindowOps</b> (class <b>DisallowedWindowOps</b>)
               Specify which features will be disabled if <b>allowWindowOps</b> is false.  This  is  a  comma-separated
               list of names, or (for the controls adapted from <u>dtterm</u> the operation number).  The default value
               is

                   1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,13,14,18,19,20,21,GetSelection,SetSelection,SetWinLines,SetXprop
                   (i.e., no operations are allowed).

               The  names  are listed below.  <u>Xterm</u> ignores capitalization, but they are shown in mixed-case for
               clarity.  Where a number can be used as an alternative, it is  given  in  parentheses  after  the
               name.

               ColumnMode
                    Enable  (or  disable) switching between 80 and 132 columns.  This is in addition to the <b>c132</b>

       <b>dynamicColors</b> (class <b>DynamicColors</b>)
               Specifies whether or not escape sequences to change colors assigned to different  attributes  are
               recognized.

       <b>eightBitControl</b> (class <b>EightBitControl</b>)
               Specifies whether or not control sequences sent by the terminal should be eight-bit characters or
               escape sequences.  The default is “false”.

       <b>eightBitInput</b> (class <b>EightBitInput</b>)
               If  “true”,  Meta  characters (a single-byte character combined with the <u>Meta</u> modifier key) input
               from the keyboard are presented as a single character, modified  according  to  the  <b>eightBitMeta</b>
               resource.   If  “false”,  Meta  characters  are  converted into a two-character sequence with the
               character itself preceded by ESC.  The default is “true”.

               The <b>metaSendsEscape</b> and <b>altSendsEscape</b> resources may override this feature.  Generally  keyboards
               do not have a key labeled “Meta”, but “Alt” keys are common, and they are conventionally used for
               “Meta”.   If  they  were  synonymous,  it  would  have  been  reasonable  to  name  this resource
               “<b>altSendsEscape</b>”, reversing its sense.  For more background on this, see the <b><a href="../man3x/meta.3x.html">meta</a></b>(3x) function in
               curses.

               Note that the <u>Alt</u> key is not necessarily the same as the  <u>Meta</u>  modifier.   The  <u>xmodmap</u>  utility
               lists  your  key modifiers.  X defines modifiers for shift, (caps) lock and control, as well as 5
               additional modifiers which are generally used to configure key  modifiers.   <u>Xterm</u>  inspects  the
               same  information  to find the modifier associated with either <u>Meta</u> key (left or right), and uses
               that key as the <u>Meta</u> modifier.  It also looks for the NumLock  key,  to  recognize  the  modifier
               which is associated with that.

               If  your <u>xmodmap</u> configuration uses the same keycodes for Alt- and Meta-keys, <u>xterm</u> will only see
               the Alt-key definitions, since those are tested before Meta-keys.  NumLock is tested  first.   It
               is  important  to  keep  these  keys  distinct;  otherwise  some  of <u>xterm</u>'s functionality is not
               available.

               The <b>eightBitInput</b> resource is tested at startup time.  If “true”, the  <u>xterm</u>  tries  to  put  the
               terminal  into  8-bit  mode.   If “false”, on startup, <u>xterm</u> tries to put the terminal into 7-bit
               mode.  For some configurations this is unsuccessful; failure is ignored.   After  startup,  <u>xterm</u>
               does not change the terminal between 8-bit and 7-bit mode.

               As  originally  implemented  in  X11,  the  resource value did not change after startup.  However
               (since patch #216 in 2006) <u>xterm</u> can modify <b>eightBitInput</b> after startup via a  control  sequence.
               The  corresponding  terminfo capabilities <b>smm</b> (set meta mode) and <b>rmm</b> (reset meta mode) have been
               recognized by <u>bash</u> for some time.  Interestingly enough, <u>bash</u>'s notion  of  “meta  mode”  differs
               from  the  standard definition (in the <u>terminfo</u> manual), which describes the change to the eighth
               bit of a character.  It happens that <u>bash</u> views “meta mode” as the ESC character that <u>xterm</u>  puts
               before  a  character  when a special meta key is pressed.  <u>bash</u>'s early documentation talks about
               the ESC character and ignores the eighth bit.

       <b>eightBitMeta</b> (class <b>EightBitMeta</b>)
               This controls the way <u>xterm</u> modifies the eighth bit of a single-byte key when  the  <b>eightBitInput</b>
               resource is set.  The default is “locale”.

               The resource value is a string, evaluated as a boolean after startup.

               false
                    The key is sent unmodified.

               locale
                    The key is modified only if the locale uses eight-bit encoding.

               true The key is sent modified.

               never
                    The key is always sent unmodified.

               Except  for  the <b>never</b> choice, <u>xterm</u> honors the terminfo capabilities <b>smm</b> (set meta mode) and <b>rmm</b>
               (reset meta mode), allowing the feature to be turned on or off dynamically.

               If <b>eightBitMeta</b> is enabled when the locale uses UTF-8, <u>xterm</u> encodes the value  as  UTF-8  (since
               patch #183 in 2003).

       <b>eightBitOutput</b> (class <b>EightBitOutput</b>)
               Specifies  whether  or  not  eight-bit  characters sent from the host should be accepted as is or
               stripped when printed.  The default is “true”, which means that they are accepted as is.

       <b>eightBitSelectTypes</b> (class <b>EightBitSelectTypes</b>)
               Override <u>xterm</u>'s default selection target  list  (see  <b>SELECT/PASTE</b>)  for  selections  in  normal
               (ISO-8859-1) mode.  The default is an empty string, i.e., “”, which does not override anything.

       <b>eraseSavedLines</b> (class <b>EraseSavedLines</b>)
               Specifies  whether or not to allow <u>xterm</u> extended ED/DECSED control sequences to erase the saved-
               line buffer.  The default is “true”.

       <b>faceName</b> (class <b>FaceName</b>)
               Specify the pattern for scalable fonts selected from the FreeType library  if  support  for  that
               library was compiled into <u>xterm</u>.  There is no default value.

               One  or  more  fonts  can be specified, separated by commas.  If prefixed with “x:” or “x11:” the
               specification applies to the XLFD <b>font</b> resource.  A “xft:” prefix  is  accepted  but  unnecessary
               since a missing prefix for <b>faceName</b> means that it will be used for TrueType.  For example,

                   XTerm*faceName: x:fixed,xft:Bitstream Vera Sans Mono

               Two  TrueType fonts can be specified in this way.  The first is the primary font; the second acts
               as a manual override to the <u>fontconfig</u> fontset.

               If no <b>faceName</b> resource is specified, or if there is no match for both TrueType normal  and  bold
               fonts, <u>xterm</u> uses the XLFD (bitmap) <b>font</b> and related resources.

               It is possible to select suitable bitmap fonts using a script such as this:

                   #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
                   FONT=`xfontsel -print`
                   test -n "$FONT" &amp;&amp; xfd -fn "$FONT"

               However  (even though <u>xfd</u> accepts a “<b>-fa</b>” option to denote FreeType fonts), <u>xfontsel</u> has not been
               similarly extended.  As a workaround, you may try

                   fc-list :scalable=true:spacing=mono: family

               to find a list of scalable fixed-pitch fonts which may be used for the <b>faceName</b> resource value.

       <b>faceNameDoublesize</b> (class <b>FaceNameDoublesize</b>)
               Specify a double-width scalable font for cases where an application requires this, e.g.,  in  CJK
               applications.  There is no default value.

               Like  the  <b>faceName</b>  resource,  this allows one or more comma-separated font specifications to be
               applied to the <u>wide</u> TrueType or XLFD fonts.

               If the application uses double-wide characters and this resource is not given, <u>xterm</u> will  use  a
               scaled version of the font given by <b>faceName</b>.

       <b>faceSize</b> (class <b>FaceSize</b>)
               Specify  the  pointsize  for fonts selected from the FreeType library if support for that library
               was compiled into <u>xterm</u>.  The default is “8.0” On the <b>VT</b> <b>Fonts</b>  menu,  this  corresponds  to  the
               <u>Default</u> entry.

               Although  the  default is “8.0”, this may not be the same as the pointsize for the default bitmap
               font, i.e., that assigned with the <b>-fn</b> option, or  the  <b>font</b>  resource.   The  default  value  of
               <b>faceSize</b>  is  chosen  to  match the size of the “fixed” font, making switching between bitmap and
               TrueType fonts via the font menu give comparable sizes for the window.  If your <b>-fn</b> option uses a
               different pointsize, you might want to adjust the <b>faceSize</b> resource to match.

               You can specify the pointsize for TrueType  fonts  selected  with  the  other  size-related  menu
               entries such as Medium, Huge, etc., by using one of the following resource values.  If you do not
               specify  a  value,  they default to “0.0”, which causes <u>xterm</u> to use the ratio of font sizes from
               the corresponding bitmap font resources to obtain a TrueType pointsize.

               If all of the <b>faceSize</b> resources are set, then <u>xterm</u> will use this information to  determine  the
               next smaller/larger TrueType font for the <b>larger-vt-font()</b> and <b>smaller-vt-font()</b> actions.  If any
               are not set, <u>xterm</u> will use only the areas of the bitmap fonts.

       <b>faceSize1</b> (class <b>FaceSize1</b>)
               Specifies the pointsize of the first alternative font.

       <b>faceSize2</b> (class <b>FaceSize2</b>)
               Specifies the pointsize of the second alternative font.

       <b>faceSize3</b> (class <b>FaceSize3</b>)
               Specifies the pointsize of the third alternative font.

       <b>faceSize4</b> (class <b>FaceSize4</b>)
               Specifies the pointsize of the fourth alternative font.

       <b>faceSize5</b> (class <b>FaceSize5</b>)
               Specifies the pointsize of the fifth alternative font.

       <b>faceSize6</b> (class <b>FaceSize6</b>)
               Specifies the pointsize of the sixth alternative font.

       <b>faceSize7</b> (class <b>FaceSize7</b>)
               Specifies the pointsize of the seventh alternative font.

       <b>faintIsRelative</b> (class <b>FaintIsRelative</b>)
               Faint  colors are derived from the current text color, e.g., the ANSI colors, by scaling the red,
               green and blue components.  Use this resource to specify whether that is  done  relative  to  the
               current background color, or as an absolute value.  The default is “false”.

       <b>fastScroll</b> (class <b>FastScroll</b>)
               Modifies  the  effect of jump scroll (<b>jumpScroll</b>) by suppressing screen refreshes for the special
               case when output to the screen has completely shifted the contents off-screen.  Likewise,  screen
               refreshes for related actions, e.g., carriage returns, are suppressed.

               For  instance,  <u>cat</u>'ing  a  large file to the screen normally results in a large number of screen
               refreshes.  By suppressing the corresponding refreshes, scrolling speed improves.

               The default is “true”.

       <b>font</b> (class <b>Font</b>)
               Specifies the name of the normal font.  The default is “fixed”.

               See the discussion of the <b>locale</b> resource, which describes how this font may be overridden.

               NOTE: some resource files use patterns such as

                   *font: fixed

               which are overly broad, affecting both

                   xterm.vt100.font

               and

                   xterm.vt100.utf8Fonts.font

               which is probably not what you intended.

       <b>font1</b> (class <b>Font1</b>)
               Specifies the name of the first alternative font, corresponding to “Unreadable” in  the  standard
               menu.

       <b>font2</b> (class <b>Font2</b>)
               Specifies the name of the second alternative font, corresponding to “Tiny” in the standard menu.

       <b>font3</b> (class <b>Font3</b>)
               Specifies the name of the third alternative font, corresponding to “Small” in the standard menu.

       <b>font4</b> (class <b>Font4</b>)
               Specifies  the  name  of  the  fourth alternative font, corresponding to “Medium” in the standard
               menu.

       <b>font5</b> (class <b>Font5</b>)
               Specifies the name of the fifth alternative font, corresponding to “Large” in the standard menu.

       <b>font6</b> (class <b>Font6</b>)
               Specifies the name of the sixth alternative font, corresponding to “Huge” in the standard menu.

       <b>font7</b> (class <b>Font7</b>)
               Specifies the name of the seventh alternative font, corresponding to “Enormous” in  the  standard
               menu.

       <b>fontDoublesize</b> (class <b>FontDoublesize</b>)
               Specifies whether <u>xterm</u> should attempt to use font scaling to draw double-sized characters.  Some
               older  font servers cannot do this properly, will return misleading font metrics.  The default is
               “true”.  If disabled, <u>xterm</u> will simulate double-sized characters by  drawing  normal  characters
               with spaces between them.

       <b>fontWarnings</b> (class <b>FontWarnings</b>)
               Specify whether <u>xterm</u> should report an error if it fails to load a font:

               0    Never report an error (though the X libraries may).

               1    Report an error if the font name was given as a resource setting.

               2    Always report an error on failure to load a font.

               The default is “1”.

       <b>forceBoxChars</b> (class <b>ForceBoxChars</b>)
               Specifies  whether  <u>xterm</u>  should  assume  the  normal  and  bold  fonts  have VT100 line-drawing
               characters:

               •   The fixed-pitch ISO-8859-*-encoded fonts used by <u>xterm</u> normally have the  VT100  line-drawing
                   glyphs in cells 1–31.  Other fixed-pitch fonts may be more attractive, but lack these glyphs.

               •   When  using  an  ISO-10646-1  font and the <b>wideChars</b> resource is true, <u>xterm</u> uses the Unicode
                   glyphs which match the VT100 line-drawing glyphs.

               If “false”, <u>xterm</u> checks for missing  glyphs  in  the  font  and  makes  line-drawing  characters
               directly  as  needed.   If  “true”,  <u>xterm</u>  assumes  the  font  does not contain the line-drawing
               characters, and draws them directly.  The default is “false”.

               The VT100 line-drawing character set (also known as the <u>DEC</u> <u>Special</u> <u>Character</u>  <u>and</u>  <u>Line</u>  <u>Drawing</u>
               <u>Set</u>) is shown in this table.  It includes a few <u>special</u> characters which are not used for drawing
               lines:

       <b>forcePackedFont</b> (class <b>ForcePackedFont</b>)
               Specifies  whether  <u>xterm</u>  should  use the maximum or minimum glyph width when displaying using a
               bitmap font.  Use the maximum width to help with proportional  fonts.   The  default  is  “true”,
               denoting the minimum width.

       <b>forceXftHeight</b> (class <b>ForceXftHeight</b>)
               Specifies  whether  <u>xterm</u>  should  use  the  given  font metrics for TrueType fonts, or amend the
               ascent/descent to total no more than the given font-height.  This optional  feature  is  used  to
               work around inconsistencies in FreeType's rounding computation.  The default is “false”, denoting
               the given metrics.

       <b>foreground</b> (class <b>Foreground</b>)
               Specifies  the color to use for displaying text in the window.  Setting the class name instead of
               the instance name is an easy way to have everything that would normally appear in the text  color
               change color.  The default is “XtDefaultForeground”.

       <b>formatCursorKeys</b> (class <b>FormatCursorKeys</b>)
               When  <b>modifyCursorKeys</b>  is 4 or greater, use modified form as in <b>formatOtherKeys</b>, for cursor-keys
               instead of the conventional form.  The default is “0”.

       <b>formatFunctionKeys</b> (class <b>FormatFunctionKeys</b>)
               When <b>modifyFunctionKeys</b> is 4 or greater, use modified form as in <b>formatOtherKeys</b>,  for  function-
               keys instead of the conventional form.  The default is “0”.

       <b>formatKeypadKeys</b> (class <b>FormatKeypadKeys</b>)
               When  <b>modifyKeypadKeys</b>  is  4  or  greater,  use modified form as in <b>formatOtherKeys</b>, for numeric
               keypad-keys instead of the conventional form.  The default is “0”.

       <b>formatModifierKeys</b> (class <b>FormatModifierKeys</b>)
               When <b>modifyModifierKeys</b> is 4 or greater, use modified form as in <b>formatOtherKeys</b>,  for  modifier-
               keys instead of the conventional form.  The default is “0”.

       <b>formatOtherKeys</b> (class <b>FormatOtherKeys</b>)
               Overrides the format of the escape sequence used to report modified keys with the <b>modifyOtherKeys</b>
               resource.

               0  send modified keys as parameters for function-key 27 (default).

               1  send modified keys as parameters for CSI u.

       <b>formatSpecialKeys</b> (class <b>FormatSpecialKeys</b>)
               When <b>modifySpecialKeys</b> is 4 or greater, use modified form as in <b>formatOtherKeys</b>, for special keys
               instead of the conventional form.  The default is “0”.

       <b>freeBoldBox</b> (class <b>FreeBoldBox</b>)
               Specifies  whether  <u>xterm</u>  should  assume  the  bounding  boxes  for  normal  and  bold fonts are
               compatible.  If “false”, <u>xterm</u> compares them and will reject choices of bold fonts  that  do  not
               match  the  size  of the normal font.  The default is “false”, which means that the comparison is
               performed.

       <b>geometry</b> (class <b>Geometry</b>)
               Specifies the preferred size and position of the VT<u>xxx</u> window.  There  is  no  default  for  this
               resource.

       <b>highlightColor</b> (class <b>HighlightColor</b>)
               Specifies  the  color to use for the background of selected (highlighted) text.  If not specified
               (i.e.,  matching  the  default  foreground),   reverse   video   is   used.    The   default   is
               “XtDefaultForeground”.

       <b>highlightColorMode</b> (class <b>HighlightColorMode</b>)
               Specifies whether <u>xterm</u> should use <b>highlightTextColor</b> and <b>highlightColor</b> to override the reversed
               foreground/background  colors  in  a  selection.   The  default is unspecified: at startup, <u>xterm</u>
               checks if those resources are set to something other than the default foreground  and  background
               colors.  Setting this resource disables the check.

               The  following table shows the interaction of the highlighting resources, abbreviated as shown to

       <b>highlightReverse</b> (class <b>HighlightReverse</b>)
               Specifies whether <u>xterm</u> should reverse  the  selection  foreground  and  background  colors  when
               selecting  text  with  reverse-video  attribute.   This  applies  only  to the <b>highlightColor</b> and
               <b>highlightTextColor</b> resources, e.g., to match the color scheme of <u>xwsh</u>.  If “true”, <u>xterm</u> reverses
               the colors, If “false”, <u>xterm</u> does not reverse colors, The default is “true”.

       <b>highlightSelection</b> (class <b>HighlightSelection</b>)
               Tells <u>xterm</u> whether to highlight all of the selected positions, or only the selected text:

               •   If “false”, selecting with the mouse highlights all  positions  on  the  screen  between  the
                   beginning of the selection and the current position.

               •   If “true”, <u>xterm</u> highlights only the positions that contain text that can be selected.

               The default is “false”.

               Depending  on  the  way  your applications write to the screen, there may be trailing blanks on a
               line.  <u>Xterm</u> stores data as it is shown on the screen.  Erasing the display changes the  internal
               state  of each cell so it is not considered a blank for the purpose of selection.  Blanks written
               since the last erase are selectable.  If you do not wish to have trailing blanks in a  selection,
               use the <b>trimSelection</b> resource.

       <b>highlightTextColor</b> (class <b>HighlightTextColor</b>)
               Specifies  the  color to use for the foreground of selected (highlighted) text.  If not specified
               (i.e.,  matching  the  default  background),   reverse   video   is   used.    The   default   is
               “XtDefaultBackground”.

       <b>hpLowerleftBugCompat</b> (class <b>HpLowerleftBugCompat</b>)
               Specifies  whether to work around a bug in HP's <u>xdb</u>, which ignores termcap and always sends ESC F
               to move to the lower left corner.  “true” causes <u>xterm</u> to interpret ESC F as a request to move to
               the lower left corner of the screen.  The default is “false”.

       <b>i18nSelections</b> (class <b>I18nSelections</b>)
               If false, <u>xterm</u> will not request the targets <b>COMPOUND_TEXT</b> or <b>TEXT</b>.  The default is  “true”.   It
               may be set to false in order to work around ICCCM violations by other X clients.

       <b>iconBorderColor</b> (class <b>BorderColor</b>)
               Specifies  the  border  color  for the active icon window if this feature is compiled into <u>xterm</u>.
               Not all window managers will make the icon border visible.

       <b>iconBorderWidth</b> (class <b>BorderWidth</b>)
               Specifies the border width for the active icon window if this feature  is  compiled  into  <u>xterm</u>.
               The default is “2”.  Not all window managers will make the border visible.

       <b>iconFont</b> (class <b>IconFont</b>)
               Specifies  the font for the miniature active icon window, if this feature is compiled into <u>xterm</u>.
               The default is “nil2”.

       <b>incrementalGraphics</b> (class <b>IncrementalGraphics</b>)
               When displaying SIXEL graphics, refresh the screen after processing each cell.   The  default  is
               “false”.

       <b>indicatorFormat</b> (class <b>IndicatorFormat</b>)
               When  displaying  the status line using the <u>indicator</u> mode (i.e., selecting DECSSDT line type 1),
               format the status using this resource.

               The default value of the resource displays the version of <u>xterm</u>,  the  cursor  position  and  the
               time/date:

                   “%{version%}  %{position%}  %{unixtime%}”

               If  a  “%”  marker  does  not  match any of the three special tokens used in the default resource
               setting, <u>xterm</u> uses <b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></b>(3) to interpret it.

       <b>initialFont</b> (class <b>InitialFont</b>)
               Specifies which of the VT100 fonts to use initially.  Values are the same as for the  <b>set-vt-font</b>
               action.  The default is “d”, i.e., “default”.

       <b>inputMethod</b> (class <b>InputMethod</b>)
               Tells <u>xterm</u> which type of input method to use.  There is no default method.

       <b>internalBorder</b> (class <b>BorderWidth</b>)
               Specifies the number of pixels between the characters and the window border.  The default is “2”.

       <b>italicULMode</b> (class <b>ColorAttrMode</b>)
               Specifies  whether  characters with the underline attribute should be displayed in an italic font
               or as underlined characters.  It is implemented only for TrueType fonts.

       <b>jumpScroll</b> (class <b>JumpScroll</b>)
               Specifies whether or not jump scroll should be used.   This  corresponds  to  the  VT102  DECSCLM
               private mode.  The default is “true”.  See <b>fastScroll</b> for a variation.

       <b>keepClipboard</b> (class <b>KeepClipboard</b>)
               Specifies  whether  <u>xterm</u>  will  reuse the selection data which it copied to the clipboard rather
               than asking the clipboard for its current contents when  told  to  provide  the  selection.   The
               default is “false”.

               If compiled into <u>xterm</u>, the menu entry <b>Keep</b> <b>Clipboard</b> allows you to change this at runtime.

       <b>keepSelection</b> (class <b>KeepSelection</b>)
               Specifies  whether <u>xterm</u> will keep the selection even after the selected area was touched by some
               output to the terminal.  The default is “true”.

               The menu entry <b>Keep</b> <b>Selection</b> allows you to change this at runtime.

       <b>keyboardDialect</b> (class <b>KeyboardDialect</b>)
               Specifies the initial keyboard dialect, as well as the default value when the terminal is  reset.
               The  value  given  is  the  same  as  the  final  character in the control sequences which change
               character sets.  The default is “B”, which corresponds to US ASCII.

       <b>limitFontsets</b> (class <b>LimitFontsets</b>)
               Limits the number of TrueType fallback fonts (i.e., fontset) which can be tested.  The default is
               “50”.  No more than “255” will be scanned.

               This limits the number of fallback  fonts  which  <u>xterm</u>  uses  to  display  characters.   Because
               TrueType  fonts typically are small, <u>xterm</u> may open several fonts for good coverage, and may open
               additional fonts to obtain information.  You can see which font-files <u>xterm</u> opens by setting  the
               environment variable <b>XFT_DEBUG</b> to 3.  The Xft library and <u>xterm</u> write this debugging trace to the
               standard output.

               Set this to “0” to disable fallbacks entirely.

       <b>limitFontHeight</b> (class <b>LimitFontHeight</b>)
               When scaling a TrueType font to provide the parts for a double-high character, <u>xterm</u> compares the
               scaled font with the original to ensure that it is taller.

               The default is “10” (percent).

       <b>limitFontWidth</b> (class <b>LimitFontWidth</b>)
               When  looking  for  fallback fonts, <u>xterm</u> checks to see that the character to be displayed is the
               same width as the primary font.  If a character extends outside the font's  bounding  box,  <u>xterm</u>
               will clip it, to fit.

               This  resource  controls  the  amount  by which the character can extend outside its bounding box
               before <u>xterm</u> looks further for a better font.

               This  resource  is  also  used  in  scaling  TrueType  fonts  for  double-wide  characters,  like
               <b>limitFontHeight</b> for double-wide characters.

               The default is “10” (percent).

       <b>limitResize</b> (class <b>LimitResize</b>)
               Limits resizing of the screen via control sequence to a given multiple of the display dimensions.
               The default is “1”.

       <b>limitResponse</b> (class <b>LimitResponse</b>)
               Limits  the  buffer-size  used  when  <u>xterm</u> replies to various control sequences.  The default is
               “1024”.  The minimum value is “256”.

       <b>locale</b> (class <b>Locale</b>)
               Specifies how to use <b><a href="../man1/luit.1.html">luit</a></b>(1), an encoding converter between  UTF-8  and  locale  encodings.   The
               resource value (ignoring case) may be:

               <u>true</u>
                   <u>Xterm</u>  will use the encoding specified by the users' LC_CTYPE locale (i.e., LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE,
                   or LANG variables) as far as possible.  This is realized by always enabling  UTF-8  mode  and
                   invoking <u>luit</u> in non-UTF-8 locales.

               <u>medium</u>
                   <u>Xterm</u>  will follow users' LC_CTYPE locale only for UTF-8, east Asian, and Thai locales, where
                   the encodings were not supported by conventional 8bit mode with changing  fonts.   For  other
                   locales, <u>xterm</u> will use conventional 8bit mode.

               <u>checkfont</u>
                   If  mini-luit  is compiled-in, <u>xterm</u> will check if a Unicode font has been specified.  If so,
                   it checks if the character encoding for the current locale is POSIX, Latin-1 or Latin-9, uses
                   the appropriate mapping to support those with the Unicode font.  For other  encodings,  <u>xterm</u>
                   assumes that UTF-8 encoding is required.

               <u>false</u>
                   <u>Xterm</u> will use conventional 8bit mode or UTF-8 mode according to <b>utf8</b> resource or <b>-u8</b> option.

               Any  other  value,  e.g., “UTF-8” or “ISO8859-2”, is assumed to be an encoding name; <u>luit</u> will be
               invoked to support the encoding.  The actual list of supported encodings depends  on  <u>luit</u>.   The
               default is “medium”.

               Regardless of your locale and encoding, you need an ISO-10646-1 font to display the result.  Your
               configuration may not include this font, or locale-support by <u>xterm</u> may not be needed.

               At  startup,  <u>xterm</u> uses a mechanism equivalent to the <b>load-vt-fonts(utf8Fonts,</b> <b>Utf8Fonts)</b> action
               to load font name subresources  of  the  VT100  widget.   That  is,  resource  patterns  such  as
               “<b>*vt100.utf8Fonts.font</b>”  will  be  loaded, and (if this resource is enabled), override the normal
               fonts.  If no subresources are found, the normal fonts such as “<b>*vt100.font</b>”, etc., are used.

               For instance, you could have this in your resource file:

                   *VT100.font: 12x24
                   *VT100.utf8Fonts.font:9x15

               When started with a UTF-8 locale, <u>xterm</u> would use 9x15, but allow you to switch to the 12x24 font
               using the menu entry “<b>UTF-8</b> <b>Fonts</b>”.

               The resource files distributed with <u>xterm</u> use ISO-10646-1 fonts, but do not rely on  them  unless
               you are using the locale mechanism.

       <b>localeFilter</b> (class <b>LocaleFilter</b>)
               Specifies  the  file  name for the encoding converter from/to locale encodings and UTF-8 which is
               used with the <b>-lc</b> option or <b>locale</b> resource.  The help message shown by “xterm -help”  lists  the
               default value, which depends on your system configuration.

               If  the encoding converter requires command-line parameters, you can add those after the command,
               e.g.,

                   *localeFilter: xterm-filter -p

               Alternatively, you may put those parameters within a shell script to execute the  converter,  and
               set this resource to point to the shell script.

               When  using  a  locale-filter,  e.g., with the <u>-e</u> option, or the shell, <u>xterm</u> first tries passing
               control via that filter.  If it fails, <u>xterm</u> will retry without the locale-filter.   <u>Xterm</u>  warns
               about the failure before retrying.

       <b>logFile</b> (class <b>Logfile</b>)
               Specify  the name for <u>xterm</u>'s log file.  If no name is specified, <u>xterm</u> will generate a name when
               logging is enabled, as described in the <b>-l</b> option.

       <b>logInhibit</b> (class <b>LogInhibit</b>)
               If “true”, prevent the logging feature from being enabled, whether by the command-line option <b>-l</b>,
               or the menu entry <b>Log</b> <b>to</b> <b>File</b>.  The default is “false”.

       <b>logging</b> (class <b>Logging</b>)
               If “true”, (and if <b>logInhibit</b>  is  not  set)  enable  the  logging  feature.   This  resource  is
               set/updated by the <b>-l</b> option and the menu entry <b>Log</b> <b>to</b> <b>File</b>.  The default is “false”.

       <b>loginShell</b> (class <b>LoginShell</b>)
               Specifies  whether  or  not the shell to be run in the window should be started as a login shell.
               The default is “false”.

       <b>marginBell</b> (class <b>MarginBell</b>)
               Specifies whether or not the bell should be rung when the user types near the right margin.   The
               default is “false”.

       <b>maxGraphicSize</b> (class <b>MaxGraphicSize</b>)
               If  <u>xterm</u>  is  configured  to support ReGIS or SIXEL graphics, this resource controls the maximum
               size of a graph which can be displayed.

               The default is “1000x1000” (given as <u>width</u> by <u>height</u>).

               If the resource is “auto” then <u>xterm</u> will use the <b>decGraphicsID</b>  resource  (or  <b>decTerminalID</b>  if
               that is not set):
               <b>Result</b>    <b>decGraphicsID</b>
               ────────────────────────
               768x400             125
               800x460             240
               800x460             241
               800x480             330
               800x480             340
               860x750             382
               800x480           <u>other</u>

       <b>maxStringParse</b> (class <b>MaxStringParse</b>)
               <u>Xterm</u>'s state parser recognizes several types of control strings which can contain text, e.g.,

               <b>APC</b> (Application Program Command),
               <b>DCS</b> (Device Control String),
               <b>OSC</b> (Operating System Command),
               <b>PM</b> (Privacy Message), and
               <b>SOS</b> (Start of String),

               <u>Xterm</u>  reads  these  strings, accumulating them into a buffer until they are properly terminated.
               At that point, <u>xterm</u> interprets the strings.  If they happen to be <b>DCS</b>  commands  to  draw  ReGIS
               images,  these  strings may be large, in the hundreds of kilobytes.  A few <b>OSC</b> commands may be as
               large as 10 kilobytes.

               This resource sets a limit on the size of the buffer used for  these  strings.   The  default  is
               “600000”  based  on  the  features which are configured for <u>xterm</u>.  Control strings which require
               larger buffer size are ignored.

       <b>metaSendsEscape</b> (class <b>MetaSendsEscape</b>)
               Tells <u>xterm</u> what to do with input-characters modified by <u>Meta</u>:

               •   If “true”, Meta characters (a character combined with the <u>Meta</u> modifier  key)  are  converted
                   into  a  two-character  sequence  with the character itself preceded by ESC.  This applies as
                   well to function key control sequences, unless <u>xterm</u> sees that  <b>Meta</b>  is  used  in  your  key
                   translations.

               •   If   “false”,  Meta  characters  input  from  the  keyboard  are  handled  according  to  the
                   <b>eightBitInput</b> resource.

               The default is “False”.

       <b>mkSamplePass</b> (class <b>MkSamplePass</b>)
               If <b>mkSampleSize</b> is nonzero, and <b>mkWidth</b> (and <b>cjkWidth</b>) are false, on startup <u>xterm</u>  compares  its
               built-in  tables  to the system's wide character width data to decide if it will use the system's
               data.  It tests the first <b>mkSampleSize</b> character values, and allows up to <b>mkSamplePass</b> mismatches
               before the test fails.  The default (for the allowed number of mismatches) is 655 (one percent of
               the default value for <b>mkSampleSize</b>).

       <b>mkSampleSize</b> (class <b>MkSampleSize</b>)
               With <b>mkSamplePass</b>, this specifies a startup test  used  for  initializing  wide  character  width
               calculations.  The default (number of characters to check) is 65536.

       <b>mkWidth</b> (class <b>MkWidth</b>)
               Specifies  whether  <u>xterm</u>  should use a built-in version of the wide character width calculation.
               See also the <b>cjkWidth</b> resource which can override this.  The default is “false”.

               Here is a summary of the resources which control the choice of wide character width calculation:
               <u>cjkWidth</u>   <u>mkWidth</u>   <u>Action</u>
               ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
               false      false     use system tables subject to <b>mkSamplePass</b>
               false      true      use built-in tables
               true       false     use built-in CJK tables
               true       true      use built-in CJK tables

               To disable <b>mkWidth</b>, and use the system's tables, set both <b>mkSampleSize</b> and <b>mkSamplePass</b>  to  “0”.
               Doing  that  may make <u>xterm</u> more consistent with applications running in <u>xterm</u>, but may omit some
               font glyphs whose width correctly differs from the system's character tables.

       <b>modifyCursorKeys</b> (class <b>ModifyCursorKeys</b>)
               Tells how to handle the special case where Control-, Shift-, Alt- or Meta-modifiers are  used  to
               add  a  parameter  to the escape sequence returned by a cursor-key.  X11 cursor keys are the four
               keys with arrow symbols:

                   Left Right Up Down

               as well as some commonly found on an “editing keypad”

                   Home Prior Page_Up Next Page_Down End Begin

               The default is “2”:

               -1   disables the feature.

               0    uses the old/obsolete behavior, i.e., the modifier is the first parameter.

               1    prefixes modified sequences with CSI.

               2    forces the modifier to be the second parameter if it would otherwise be the first.

               3    marks the sequence with a “&gt;” to hint that it is private.

               4    changes the format to match <b>modifyOtherKeys</b> 3,  sending  an  escape  sequence  according  to
                    <b>formatCursorKeys</b>.

       <b>modifyFunctionKeys</b> (class <b>ModifyFunctionKeys</b>)
               Tells  how  to handle the special case where Control-, Shift-, Alt- or Meta-modifiers are used to
               add a parameter to the escape sequence returned by a (numbered)  function-key.   The  default  is
               “2”.  The resource values are similar to <b>modifyCursorKeys</b>:

               -1   permits the user to use shift- and control-modifiers to construct function-key strings using
                    the normal encoding scheme.

               0    uses the old/obsolete behavior, i.e., the modifier is the first parameter.

               1    prefixes modified sequences with CSI.

               2    forces the modifier to be the second parameter if it would otherwise be the first.

               3    marks the sequence with a “&gt;” to hint that it is private.

               4    changes  the  format  to  match  <b>modifyOtherKeys</b> 3,  sending an escape sequence according to
                    <b>formatFunctionKeys</b>.

               If <b>modifyFunctionKeys</b> is zero, <u>xterm</u> uses Control- and  Shift-modifiers  to  allow  the  user  to
               construct numbered function-keys beyond the set provided by the keyboard:

               Control
                    adds the value given by the <b>ctrlFKeys</b> resource.

               Shift
                    adds twice the value given by the <b>ctrlFKeys</b> resource.

               Control/Shift
                    adds three times the value given by the <b>ctrlFKeys</b> resource.

       <b>modifyKeyboard</b> (class <b>ModifyKeyboard</b>)
               Normally <u>xterm</u> makes a special case regarding modifiers (shift, control, etc.)  to handle special
               keyboard  layouts (<b>legacy</b> and <b>vt220</b>).  This is done to provide compatible keyboards for DEC VT220
               and related terminals that implement user-defined keys (UDK).

               The bits of the resource value selectively enable modification of the given category  when  these
               keyboards are selected.  The default is “0”:

               0    The  legacy/vt220  keyboards  interpret only the Control-modifier when constructing numbered
                    function-keys.  Other special keys are not modified.

               1    allows modification of the numeric keypad

               2    allows modification of the editing keypad

               4    allows modification of function-keys, overrides use of Shift-modifier for UDK.

               8    allows modification of other special keys

       <b>modifyKeypadKeys</b> (class <b>ModifyKeypadKeys</b>)
               Like <b>modifyCursorKeys</b> “4”, tells <u>xterm</u> to construct an escape sequence for <u>numeric</u>  <u>keypad</u>  keys.
               The default is “0”.

       <b>modifyModifierKeys</b> (class <b>ModifyModifierKeys</b>)
               Like  <b>modifyCursorKeys</b>  “4”,  tells  <u>xterm</u>  to  construct  an escape sequence for <u>modifier</u> (e.g.,
               “shift”) keys.  The default is “0”.

       <b>modifyOtherKeys</b> (class <b>ModifyOtherKeys</b>)
               Like <b>modifyCursorKeys</b> “4”, tells <u>xterm</u> to  construct  an  escape  sequence  for  <u>ordinary</u>  (i.e.,
               “other”)  keys  (such  as  “2”)  when modified by Shift-, Control-, Alt- or Meta-modifiers.  This
               feature does not apply to <u>special</u> <u>keys</u>, i.e., cursor-, keypad-,  function- or control-keys  which
               are labeled on your keyboard.  Those have key symbols which XKB identifies uniquely.

               The default is “0”:

               0    disables this feature.

               1    enables  this  feature  for  keys  except  for  those  with  well-known behavior, e.g., Tab,
                    Backarrow and some special control character cases which are built  into  the  X11  library,
                    e.g., Control-Space to make a NUL, or Control-3 to make an Escape character.

                    Except for those special cases built into the X11 library, the Shift- and Control- modifiers
                    are  treated  normally.   The  Alt-  and  Meta-  modifiers do not cause <u>xterm</u> to send escape
                    sequences.  Those modifier keys are interpreted according  to  other  resources,  e.g.,  the
                    <b>metaSendsEscape</b> resource.

               2    enables  this  feature  for keys including the exceptions listed.  <u>Xterm</u> ignores the special
                    cases built into the X11 library.  Any shifted  (modified)  ordinary  key  sends  an  escape
                    sequence.  The Alt- and Meta- modifiers cause <u>xterm</u> to send escape sequences.

               3    extends the feature to send unmodified keys as escape sequences.

               The <u>Xterm</u> FAQ has an extended discussion of this feature, with examples:

               https://invisible-island.net/xterm/modified-keys.html

       <b>modifySpecialKeys</b> (class <b>ModifySpecialKeys</b>)
               Like  <b>modifyCursorKeys</b>  “4”,  tells <u>xterm</u> to construct an escape sequence for <u>special</u> keys (e.g.,
               “escape” not in the other categories).  The default is “0”.

       <b>multiClickTime</b> (class <b>MultiClickTime</b>)
               Specifies the maximum time in milliseconds between multi-click select  events.   The  default  is
               “250” milliseconds.

       <b>multiScroll</b> (class <b>MultiScroll</b>)
               Specifies whether or not scrolling should be done asynchronously.  The default is “false”.

       <b>nMarginBell</b> (class <b>Column</b>)
               Specifies the number of characters from the right margin at which the margin bell should be rung,
               when enabled by the <b>marginBell</b> resource.  The default is “10”.

       <u>name</u><b>Keymap</b> (class <u>Name</u><b>Keymap</b>)
               See the discussion of the <b>keymap()</b> action.

       <b>nextEventDelay</b> (class <b>NextEventDelay</b>)
               Specifies a delay time in milliseconds before checking for new X events.  The default is “1”.

       <b>numColorRegisters</b> (class <b>NumColorRegisters</b>)
               If  <u>xterm</u>  is  configured to support ReGIS or SIXEL graphics, this specifies the number of color-
               registers which are available.

               If this resource is not specified, <u>xterm</u> uses a value determined by the <b>decTerminalID</b> resource:
               <b>Result</b>   <b>decTerminalID</b>
               ───────────────────────
                    4             125
                    4             240
                    4             241
                    4             330
                   16             340

                 1024           <u>other</u>

       <b>numLock</b> (class <b>NumLock</b>)
               If “true”, <u>xterm</u> checks if NumLock is used as a modifier (see <b><a href="../man1/xmodmap.1.html">xmodmap</a></b>(1)).  If so, this  modifier
               is  used  to  simplify  the logic when implementing special NumLock for the <b>sunKeyboard</b> resource.
               Also (when <b>sunKeyboard</b> is false), similar logic is used to find the modifier associated with  the
               left and right Alt keys.  The default is “true”.

       <b>oldXtermFKeys</b> (class <b>OldXtermFKeys</b>)
               If  “true”,  <u>xterm</u>  will  use  old-style (X11R5) escape sequences for function keys F1 to F4, for
               compatibility with X Consortium <u>xterm</u>.  Otherwise, it uses the VT100 codes for PF1 to  PF4.   The
               default is “false”.

               Setting  this  resource  has  the  same  effect  as  setting  the  <b>keyboardType</b>  to  <b>legacy</b>.  The
               <b>keyboardType</b> resource is the preferred mechanism for selecting this mode.

               The old-style escape sequences resemble VT220 keys, but appear to have been invented for <u>xterm</u> in
               X11R4.

       <b>on2Clicks</b> (class <b>On2Clicks</b>)

       <b>on3Clicks</b> (class <b>On3Clicks</b>)

       <b>on4Clicks</b> (class <b>On4Clicks</b>)

       <b>on5Clicks</b> (class <b>On5Clicks</b>)
               Specify selection behavior in response to multiple mouse clicks.  A single mouse click is  always
               interpreted  as described in the <b>Selection</b> <b>Functions</b> section (see <b>POINTER</b> <b>USAGE</b>).  Multiple mouse
               clicks (using the button which activates the <b>select-start</b> action) are  interpreted  according  to
               the resource values of <b>on2Clicks</b>, etc.  The resource value can be one of these:

               <b>word</b>
                  Select a “word” as determined by the <b>charClass</b> resource.  See the <b>CHARACTER</b> <b>CLASSES</b> section.

                  If  the pointer is on a “word” then <u>xterm</u> searches back to the beginning of the word, and then
                  to the end.

                  If the pointer is not on a “word” then the result depends  on  whether  it  is  on  whitespace
                  (including  a  newline),  or  past the end of the line.  In the latter case <u>xterm</u> may select a
                  “word” beginning after the newline, if there is no additional whitespace.

               <b>line</b>
                  Select a line (counting wrapping).

               <b>group</b>
                  Select a group of adjacent lines (counting wrapping).  The selection stops on  a  blank  line,
                  and does not extend outside the current page.

               <b>page</b>
                  Select all visible lines, i.e., the page.

               <b>all</b>
                  Select all lines, i.e., including the saved lines.

               <b>regex</b>
                  Select  the  best  match  for the POSIX extended regular expression (ERE) which follows in the
                  resource value:

                  •   <u>Xterm</u> matches the regular expression  against  a  byte  array  for  the  entire  (possibly
                      wrapped) line.  That byte array may be UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1, depending on the mode in which
                      <u>xterm</u> is running.

                  •   <u>Xterm</u>  steps  through  each byte-offset in this array, keeping track of the best (longest)
                      match.  If more than one match ties for the longest length, the first is used.

                      <u>Xterm</u> does this to make it convenient to click anywhere in the area of interest and  cause
                      the regular expression to match the entire word, etc.

                  •   The “^” and “$” anchors in a regular expression denote the ends of the entire line.

                  •   If  the  regular  expression contains backslashes “\” those should be escaped “\\” because
                      the X libraries interpret backslashes in resource strings.

               <b>none</b>
                  No selection action is associated with this resource.  <u>Xterm</u> interprets it as the end  of  the
                  list.   For  example,  you  may  use  it  to  disable  triple (and higher) clicking by setting
                  <b>on3Clicks</b> to “none”.

               The default values for <b>on2Clicks</b> and <b>on3Clicks</b> are “word” and “line”, respectively.  There is  no
               default  value  for  <b>on4Clicks</b> or <b>on5Clicks</b>, making those inactive.  On startup, <u>xterm</u> determines
               the maximum number of clicks by the <b>on</b><u>X</u><b>Clicks</b> resource values which are set.

       <b>openIm</b> (class <b>OpenIm</b>)
               Tells <u>xterm</u> whether to open the input method at startup.  The default is “true”.

       <b>pointerColor</b> (class <b>PointerColor</b>)
               Specifies the foreground color of the pointer.  The default is “XtDefaultForeground”.

       <b>pointerColorBackground</b> (class <b>PointerColorBackground</b>)
               Specifies the background color of the pointer.  The default is “XtDefaultBackground”.

       <b>pointerFont</b> (class <b>PointerFont</b>)
               Specifies the font to be used for the pointer.  The shapes specified by <b>pointerShape</b>  are  glyphs
               in this font.  The resource value default is <u>cursor</u>.

       <b>pointerMode</b> (class <b>PointerMode</b>)
               Specifies  when  the pointer may be hidden as the user types.  It will be redisplayed if the user
               moves the mouse, or clicks one of its buttons.

               0  never

               1  the application running in <u>xterm</u> has not activated mouse mode.  This is the default.

               2  always.

       <b>pointerShape</b> (class <b>Cursor</b>)
               Specifies the name of the shape of the pointer.  The default is “xterm”.

               Other shapes can be selected.  Here is a list of the “core” (i.e., <u>standard</u>) names extracted from
               &lt;X11/cursorfont.h&gt;:

                   X_cursor,  arrow,  based_arrow_down,  based_arrow_up,  boat,  bogosity,   bottom_left_corner,
                   bottom_right_corner,   bottom_side,   bottom_tee,   box_spiral,  center_ptr,  circle,  clock,
                   coffee_mug,  cross,  cross_reverse,  crosshair,  diamond_cross,  dot,  dotbox,  double_arrow,
                   draft_large,  draft_small,  draped_box, exchange, fleur, gobbler, gumby, hand1, hand2, heart,
                   icon,  iron_cross,  left_ptr,  left_side,  left_tee,  leftbutton,  ll_angle,  lr_angle,  man,
                   middlebutton,  mouse, pencil, pirate, plus, question_arrow, right_ptr, right_side, right_tee,
                   rightbutton,   rtl_logo,   sailboat,   sb_down_arrow,    sb_h_double_arrow,    sb_left_arrow,
                   sb_right_arrow,  sb_up_arrow,  sb_v_double_arrow,  shuttle,  sizing,  spider, spraycan, star,
                   target, tcross, top_left_arrow, top_left_corner, top_right_corner, top_side,  top_tee,  trek,
                   ul_angle, umbrella, ur_angle, watch, xterm

               If  you are using a <u>cursor</u> <u>theme</u>, expect it to provide about a third of those names, while adding
               others.

       <b>popOnBell</b> (class <b>PopOnBell</b>)
               Specifies whether the window would be raised when Control-G is received.  The default is “false”.

               If the window is iconified, this has no effect.  However, the  <b>zIconBeep</b>  resource  provides  you
               with the ability to see which iconified windows have sounded a bell.

       <b>precompose</b> (class <b>Precompose</b>)
               Tells  <u>xterm</u> whether to precompose UTF-8 data into Normalization Form C, which combines commonly-
               used accents onto base characters.  If it  does  not  do  this,  accents  are  left  as  separate
               characters.  The default is “true”.

       <b>preeditType</b> (class <b>PreeditType</b>)
               Tells  <u>xterm</u>  which  types  of  preedit  (preconversion)  string  to  display.   The  default  is
               “OverTheSpot,Root”.

       <b>preferLatin1</b> (class <b>PreferLatin1</b>)
               Tells <u>xterm</u> whether to use DEC Supplemental  Graphic,  or  ISO  Latin-1  for  the  user-preferred
               supplemental  set  (UPSS) when initializing character sets.  The former is the documented setting
               for hardware terminals, but the latter is expected by most users.  The  default  is  “true”  (ISO
               Latin-1).

       <b>printAttributes</b> (class <b>PrintAttributes</b>)
               Specifies  whether  to  print  graphic attributes along with the text.  A real DEC VT<u>xxx</u> terminal
               will print the underline, highlighting codes but your printer may not handle these.

               •   “0” disables the attributes.

               •   “1” prints the normal set of attributes (bold, underline, inverse and blink)  as  VT100-style
                   control sequences.

               •   “2” prints ANSI color attributes as well.

               The default is “1”.

       <b>printFileImmediate</b> (class <b>PrintFileImmediate</b>)
               When  the <b>print-immediate</b> action is invoked, <u>xterm</u> prints the screen contents directly to a file.
               Set this resource to the prefix of the filename (a timestamp  will  be  appended  to  the  actual
               name).

               The default is an empty string, i.e., “”, However, when the <b>print-immediate</b> action is invoked, if
               the string is empty, then “XTerm” is used.

       <b>printFileOnXError</b> (class <b>PrintFileOnXError</b>)
               If  <u>xterm</u>  exits with an X error, e.g., your connection is broken when the server crashes, it can
               be told to write the contents of the screen to a file.  To enable the feature, set this  resource
               to the prefix of the filename (a timestamp will be appended to the actual name).

               The  default  is  an  empty  string,  i.e.,  “”,  which disables this feature.  However, when the
               <b>print-on-error</b> action is invoked, if the string is empty, then “XTermError” is used.

               These error codes are handled: ERROR_XERROR, ERROR_XIOERROR and ERROR_ICEERROR.

       <b>printModeImmediate</b> (class <b>PrintModeImmediate</b>)
               When the <b>print-immediate</b> action is invoked, <u>xterm</u> prints the screen contents directly to a  file.
               You can use the <b>printModeImmediate</b> resource to tell it to use escape sequences to reconstruct the
               video  attributes  and  colors.   This uses the same values as the <b>printAttributes</b> resource.  The
               default is “0”.

       <b>printModeOnXError</b> (class <b>PrintModeOnXError</b>)
               <u>Xterm</u> implements the <b>printFileOnXError</b> feature using the printer feature, although the output  is
               written  directly to a file.  You can use the <b>printModeOnXError</b> resource to tell it to use escape
               sequences to reconstruct the video attributes and colors.  This  uses  the  same  values  as  the
               <b>printAttributes</b> resource.  The default is “0”.

       <b>printOptsImmediate</b> (class <b>PrintOptsImmediate</b>)
               Specify the range of text which is printed to a file when the <b>print-immediate</b> action is invoked.

               •   If  zero  (0), then this selects the current (visible screen) plus the saved lines, except if
                   the alternate screen is being used.  In that case, only the alternate screen is selected.

               •   If nonzero, the bits of this resource value (checked in descending order) select the range:

                   8  selects the saved lines.

                   4  selects the alternate screen.

                   2  selects the normal screen.

                   1  selects the current screen, which can be either the normal or alternate screen.

               The default is “9”, which selects the current visible screen plus saved lines,  with  no  special
               case for the alternated screen.

       <b>printOptsOnXError</b> (class <b>PrintOptsOnXError</b>)
               Specify  the  range of text which is printed to a file when the <b>print-on-error</b> action is invoked.
               The resource value is interpreted the same as in <b>printOptsImmediate</b>.

               The default is “9”, which selects the current visible screen plus saved lines,  with  no  special
               case for the alternated screen.

       <b>printRawChars</b> (class <b>PrintRawChars</b>)
               If “true”, <u>xterm</u> allows Unicode non-characters to be printed.

       <b>printerAutoClose</b> (class <b>PrinterAutoClose</b>)
               If  “true”,  <u>xterm</u>  will  close  the  printer  (a pipe) when the application switches the printer
               offline with a Media Copy command.  The default is “false”.

       <b>printerCommand</b> (class <b>PrinterCommand</b>)
               Specifies a shell command to which <u>xterm</u> will open a pipe when the first MC (Media Copy)  command
               is  initiated.   The  default is an empty string, i.e., “”.  If the resource value is given as an
               empty string, the printer is disabled.

       <b>printerControlMode</b> (class <b>PrinterControlMode</b>)
               Specifies the printer control mode.  A “1” selects autoprint mode, which causes <u>xterm</u> to print  a
               line from the screen when

               •   you move the cursor off that line with a line feed, form feed or vertical tab character, or

               •   an autowrap occurs.

               Autoprint  mode  is overridden by printer controller mode (a “2”), which causes all of the output
               to be directed to the printer.  The default is “0”.

       <b>printerExtent</b> (class <b>PrinterExtent</b>)
               Controls whether a print page function will print the entire page (true),  or  only  the  portion
               within the scrolling margins (false).  The default is “false”.

       <b>printerFormFeed</b> (class <b>PrinterFormFeed</b>)
               Controls  whether  a  form  feed is sent to the printer at the end of a print page function.  The
               default is “false”.

       <b>printerNewLine</b> (class <b>PrinterNewLine</b>)
               Controls whether a newline is sent to the printer at the end  of  a  print  page  function.   The
               default is “true”.

       <b>privateColorRegisters</b> (class <b>PrivateColorRegisters</b>)
               If  <u>xterm</u> is configured to support ReGIS or SIXEL graphics, this controls whether <u>xterm</u> allocates
               separate color registers for each sixel device control string, e.g., for DECGCI.   If  not  true,
               color  registers  are allocated only once, when the terminal is reset, and color changes  in  any
               graphic  affect all graphics.  The default is “true”.

       <b>quietGrab</b> (class <b>QuietGrab</b>)
               Controls whether the cursor is  repainted  when  <u>NotifyGrab</u>  and  <u>NotifyUngrab</u>  event  types  are
               received during change of focus.  The default is “false”.

       <b>regisDefaultFont</b> (class <b>RegisDefaultFont</b>)
               If  <u>xterm</u> is configured to support ReGIS graphics, this resource tells <u>xterm</u> which font to use if
               the ReGIS data does not specify one.  No default value is specified;  <u>xterm</u>  accepts  a  TrueType
               font specification as in the <b>faceName</b> resource.

               If no value is specified, <u>xterm</u> draws a bitmap indicating a missing character.

       <b>regisScreenSize</b> (class <b>RegisScreenSize</b>)
               If  <u>xterm</u> is configured to support ReGIS graphics, this resource tells <u>xterm</u> the default size (in
               pixels) for these graphics, which also sets the default coordinate space  to  [0,0]  (upper-left)
               and [<u>width</u>,<u>height</u>] (lower-right).

               The  application  using  ReGIS may use the “A” option of the “S” command to adjust the coordinate
               space or change the addressable portion of the screen.

               <u>Xterm</u> accepts a special resource value “auto”, which tells <u>xterm</u> to  use  the  <b>decGraphicsID</b>  and
               <b>decTerminalID</b>  resources  to set the default size based on the hardware terminal's limits.  Those
               limits are the same as for the <b>maxGraphicSize</b> resource.

               The default is “auto”.

       <b>renderFont</b> (class <b>RenderFont</b>)
               If <u>xterm</u> is built with the Xft library, this controls whether the <b>faceName</b> resource is used.  The
               default is “default”.

               The resource values are strings, evaluated as booleans after startup.

               false
                    disable the feature and use the normal (bitmap) font.

               true
                    startup using the TrueType font specified by the <b>faceName</b> and  <b>faceSize</b>  resource  settings.
                    If there is no value for <b>faceName</b>, disable the feature and use the normal (bitmap) font.

                    After  startup, you can still switch to/from the bitmap font using the “TrueType Fonts” menu
                    entry.

               default
                    Enable the “TrueType Fonts” menu entry to allow runtime switching  to/from  TrueType  fonts.
                    The initial font used depends upon whether the <b>faceName</b> resource is set:

                    •   If the <b>faceName</b> resource is not set, start by using the normal (bitmap) font.  <u>Xterm</u> has
                        a  separate  compiled-in  value  for  <b>faceName</b>  for this special case.  That is normally
                        “mono”.

                    •   If the <b>faceName</b> resource is set, then start by using the TrueType font rather  than  the
                        bitmap font.

               defaultOff
                    Enable  the  “TrueType  Fonts” menu entry to allow runtime switching to/from TrueType fonts,
                    but allow it to be initially unselected if no <b>faceName</b> resource was given.

       <b>resizeByPixel</b> (class <b>ResizeByPixel</b>)
               Set this “true” to disable hints to the window manager that request resizing by character  rather
               than pixels.

               Most window managers provide visual feedback showing the size of a window as you resize it, using
               these  hints.   When  you  maximize <u>xterm</u>, it disables those hints to allow the window manager to
               make better use of fractional rows or columns.  Setting this resource disables the hints all  the
               time.

               The default is “false”.

       <b>resizeGravity</b> (class <b>ResizeGravity</b>)
               Affects  the  behavior  when  the window is resized to be taller or shorter.  <b>NorthWest</b> specifies
               that the top line of text on the screen stay fixed.  If the window is  made  shorter,  lines  are
               dropped from the bottom; if the window is made taller, blank lines are added at the bottom.  This
               is compatible with the behavior in X11R4.  <b>SouthWest</b> (the default) specifies that the bottom line
               of  text  on the screen stay fixed.  If the window is made taller, additional saved lines will be
               scrolled down onto the screen; if the window is made shorter, lines will be scrolled off the  top
               of the screen, and the top saved lines will be dropped.

       <b>retryInputMethod</b> (class <b>RetryInputMethod</b>)
               Tells  <u>xterm</u> how many times to retry, in case the input-method server is not responding.  This is
               a different issue than unsupported preedit type, etc.   You  may  encounter  retries  if  your  X
               configuration  (and  its  libraries)  are missing pieces.  Setting this resource to zero “0” will
               cancel the retrying.  The default is “3”.

       <b>reverseVideo</b> (class <b>ReverseVideo</b>)
               Specifies whether or not reverse video should be simulated.  The default is “false”.

               There are several aspects to reverse video in <u>xterm</u>:

               •   The command-line <b>-rv</b> option tells the X libraries to reverse the  foreground  and  background
                   colors.  <u>Xterm</u>'s command-line options set resource values.  In particular, the <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> sets
                   the <b>reverseVideo</b> resource when the <b>-rv</b> option is used.

               •   If  the  user  has  also  used  command-line  options  <b>-fg</b>  or  <b>-bg</b> to set the foreground and
                   background colors, <u>xterm</u> does not see these  options  directly.   Instead,  it  examines  the
                   resource values to reconstruct the command-line options, and determine which of the colors is
                   the user's intended foreground, etc.  Their actual values are irrelevant to the reverse video
                   function;  some users prefer the X defaults (black text on a white background), others prefer
                   white text on a black background.

               •   After startup, the user can toggle the “Enable Reverse Video” menu entry.  This exchanges the
                   current foreground and background colors of  the  VT100  widget,  and  repaints  the  screen.
                   Because of the X resource hierarchy, the <b>reverseVideo</b> resource applies to more than the VT100
                   widget.

               Programs  running  in  an  <u>xterm</u> can also use control sequences to enable the VT100 reverse video
               mode.  These are independent of the <b>reverseVideo</b> resource and the menu  entry.   <u>Xterm</u>  exchanges
               the  current  foreground  and  background  colors  when  drawing  text  affected by these control
               sequences.

               Other control sequences can alter the foreground and background colors which are used:

               •   Programs can also use the ANSI color control sequences to set the foreground  and  background
                   colors.

               •   Extensions  to the ANSI color controls (such as 16-, 88- or 256-colors) are treated similarly
                   to the ANSI control.

               •   Using other control sequences (the “<u>dynamic</u>  <u>colors</u>”  feature),  a  program  can  change  the
                   foreground and background colors.

       <b>reverseWrap</b> (class <b>ReverseWrap</b>)
               Specifies  whether  or  not  reverse-wraparound  should  be enabled.  This corresponds to <u>xterm</u>'s
               private mode 45.  The default is “false”.

       <b>rightScrollBar</b> (class <b>RightScrollBar</b>)
               Specifies whether or not the scrollbar should be displayed on the right  rather  than  the  left.
               The default is “false”.

       <b>saveLines</b> (class <b>SaveLines</b>)
               Specifies the number of lines to save beyond the top of the screen when a scrollbar is turned on.
               The default is “1024”.

       <b>scrollBar</b> (class <b>ScrollBar</b>)
               Specifies whether or not the scrollbar should be displayed.  The default is “false”.

       <b>scrollBarBorder</b> (class <b>ScrollBarBorder</b>)
               Specifies  the  width  of the scrollbar border.  Note that this is drawn to overlap the border of
               the <u>xterm</u> window.  Modifying the scrollbar's border affects  only  the  line  between  the  VT100
               widget and the scrollbar.  The default value is 1.

       <b>scrollKey</b> (class <b>ScrollCond</b>)
               Specifies  whether  or  not  pressing a key should automatically cause the scrollbar to go to the
               bottom of the scrolling region.  This corresponds to <u>xterm</u>'s private mode 1011.  The  default  is
               “false”.

       <b>scrollLines</b> (class <b>ScrollLines</b>)
               Specifies  the  number  of  lines  that  the  <b>scroll-back</b> and <b>scroll-forw</b> actions should use as a
               default.  The default value is 1.

       <b>scrollTtyOutput</b> (class <b>ScrollCond</b>)
               Specifies whether or not output to the terminal should automatically cause the scrollbar to go to
               the bottom of the scrolling region.  The default is “true”.

       <b>selectToClipboard</b> (class <b>SelectToClipboard</b>)
               Tells <u>xterm</u> whether to use the <b>PRIMARY</b> or <b>CLIPBOARD</b> for <b>SELECT</b> tokens in the selection mechanism.
               The <b>set-select</b> action can change this at runtime, allowing the user to work  with  programs  that
               handle only one of these mechanisms.  The default is “false”, which tells it to use <b>PRIMARY</b>.

       <b>shiftEscape</b> (class <b>ShiftEscape</b>)
               <u>Xterm</u> uses the <b>translations</b> resource to determine how to invoke actions for selecting and copying
               text  using  the pointer (e.g., a mouse).  It also provides a mouse protocol which can be used by
               applications running in an xterm to detect mouse button clicks.

               The mouse protocol causes <u>xterm</u> to send special escape sequences which allow  an  application  to
               determine if <u>modifiers</u> (i.e., one or more of <u>shift</u>, <u>control</u>, <u>alt</u>, and <u>meta</u>) were used.

               <u>Xterm</u>  provides  this  mouse  protocol by interpreting button- and motion-events in the functions
               which the <b>translations</b> resource calls for selecting and copying text:

                      <b>insert-selection</b>
                      <b>select-end</b>
                      <b>select-extend</b>
                      <b>select-start</b>
                      <b>start-extend</b>

               While the mouse protocol is active, <u>xterm</u> reserves most of the mouse button  events  for  sending
               special  escape  sequences to the application.  <u>Xterm</u> normally allows you to use the <u>shift</u>-key to
               temporarily override this mouse protocol, permitting the selection  and  copying  actions  to  be
               used.

               The  <b>shiftEscape</b>  resource  setting allows you to tell <u>xterm</u> whether to use the <u>shift</u>-key in this
               way (i.e., overriding the mouse protocol).  <u>Xterm</u> accepts either a keyword (ignoring case) or the
               number shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                  Mouse protocol does not send special escapes when <u>shift</u>-key is used.

               true (1)
                  Mouse protocol may send special escapes when <u>shift</u>-key is used.

                  At startup, <u>xterm</u> analyzes the <b>translations</b> to see which  buttons  are  used  in  the  (mouse)
                  button-related  bindings  for  selection  and copying text.  If the <u>shift</u>-key is not mentioned
                  explicitly in a button's binding, <u>xterm</u> allows that button with <u>shift</u>-key for  overriding  the
                  mouse protocol.

               always (2)
                  Mouse protocol can always send special escapes when <u>shift</u>-key is used.

               never (3)
                  Mouse protocol will never send special escapes when <u>shift</u>-key is used.

               <u>Xterm</u>  interprets  a  control  sequence which can change this setting between “true” and “false”.
               The default is “false”.

       <b>shiftFonts</b> (class <b>ShiftFonts</b>)
               Specifies whether to  enable  the  actions  <b>larger-vt-font()</b>  and  <b>smaller-vt-font()</b>,  which  are
               normally bound to the shifted KP_Add and KP_Subtract.  The default is “true”.

       <b>showBlinkAsBold</b> (class <b>ShowBlinkAsBold</b>)
               Tells <u>xterm</u> whether to display text with blink-attribute the same as bold.  If <u>xterm</u> has not been
               configured  to  support blinking text, the default is “true”, which corresponds to older versions
               of <u>xterm</u>, otherwise the default is “false”.

       <b>showMissingGlyphs</b> (class <b>ShowMissingGlyphs</b>)
               Tells <u>xterm</u> whether to display a box outlining places where a character has been  used  that  the
               font does not represent.  The default is “true”.

       <b>showWrapMarks</b> (class <b>ShowWrapMarks</b>)
               For debugging <u>xterm</u> and applications that may manipulate the wrapped-line flag by writing text at
               the  right  margin,  show  a  mark on the right inner-border of the window.  The mark shows which
               lines have the flag set.

       <b>signalInhibit</b> (class <b>SignalInhibit</b>)
               Specifies whether or not the entries in the <b>Main</b> <b>Options</b> menu for sending signals to <u>xterm</u> should
               be disallowed.  The default is “false”.

       <b>sixelScrolling</b> (class <b>SixelScrolling</b>)
               If <u>xterm</u> is configured to support SIXEL graphics, this resource tells it whether to scroll up one
               line at a time when sixels would be written past the bottom line on the window.  The  default  is
               “true” which enables scrolling.

               Sixel  scrolling is the opposite of DEC Sixel Display Mode (DECSDM): when one is on, the other is
               off.

       <b>sixelScrollsRight</b> (class <b>SixelScrollsRight</b>)
               If <u>xterm</u> is configured to support SIXEL graphics, this resource tells it whether to scroll to the
               right as needed to keep the current position visible rather than truncate the plot on the on  the
               right.  The default is “false” which disables scrolling.

       <b>tekGeometry</b> (class <b>Geometry</b>)
               Specifies  the preferred size and position of the Tektronix window.  There is no default for this
               resource.

       <b>tekInhibit</b> (class <b>TekInhibit</b>)
               Specifies whether or not the escape sequence to enter Tektronix  mode  should  be  ignored.   The
               default is “false”.

       <b>tekSmall</b> (class <b>TekSmall</b>)
               Specifies  whether  or  not  the  Tektronix  mode  window should start in its smallest size if no
               explicit geometry is given.  This is useful when running <u>xterm</u> on displays  with  small  screens.
               The default is “false”.

       <b>tekStartup</b> (class <b>TekStartup</b>)
               Specifies whether or not <u>xterm</u> should start up in Tektronix mode.  The default is “false”.

       <b>tiXtraScroll</b> (class <b>TiXtraScroll</b>)
               Specifies whether <u>xterm</u> should scroll to a new page when processing the <u>ti</u> or <u>te</u> termcap strings,
               i.e.,  the  private  modes  47,  1047  or 1049.  This is only in effect if <b>titeInhibit</b> is “true”,
               because the intent of this option is to  provide  a  picture  of  the  full-screen  application's
               display  on the scrollback without wiping out the text that would be shown before the application
               was initialized.

               <u>Xterm</u> accepts either a keyword (ignoring case) or the number shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                      nothing is added to the scrollback.

               true (1)
                      the current screen is added to the scrollback.

               trim (2)
                      the current screen is added to the  scrollback,  but  repeated  blank  lines  are  trimmed
                      (reduced to a single blank line).

               The default for this resource is “false”.

       <b>titeInhibit</b> (class <b>TiteInhibit</b>)
               Originally specified whether or not <u>xterm</u> should remove <u>ti</u> and <u>te</u> termcap entries (used to switch
               between alternate screens on startup of many screen-oriented programs) from the TERMCAP string.

               TERMCAP is used rarely now, but <u>xterm</u> supports the feature on modern systems:

               •   If set, <u>xterm</u> also ignores the escape sequence to switch to the alternate screen.

               •   <u>Xterm</u>  supports  terminfo  in  a  different way, supporting composite control sequences (also
                   known as private modes) 1047, 1048 and 1049 which have the same effect  as  the  original  47
                   control sequence.

               The default for this resource is “false”.

       <b>titleModes</b> (class <b>TitleModes</b>)
               Tells  <u>xterm</u>  whether  to accept or return window- and icon-labels in ISO-8859-1 (the default) or
               UTF-8.  Either can be encoded in hexadecimal:

               •   UTF-8 titles require special treatment, because they may contain bytes which can be  mistaken
                   for control characters.  Hexadecimal-encoding is supported to eliminate that possibility.

               •   As  an  alternative,  you  could  use the <b>allowC1Printable</b> resource, which suppresses <u>xterm</u>'s
                   parsing of the relevant control characters (and as a result, treats those bytes as data).

               The default for this resource is “0”.

               Each bit (bit “0” is 1, bit “1” is 2, etc.)  corresponds to one of  the  parameters  set  by  the
               title modes control sequence:

               0    Set window/icon labels using hexadecimal

               1    Query window/icon labels using hexadecimal

               2    Set window/icon labels using UTF-8 (gives the same effect as the <b>utf8Title</b> resource).

               3    Query window/icon labels using UTF-8

       <b>translations</b> (class <b>Translations</b>)
               Specifies  the  key  and  button  bindings for menus, selections, “programmed strings”, etc.  The
               <b>translations</b> resource, which provides much of <u>xterm</u>'s configurability, is  a  feature  of  the  <u>X</u>
               <u>Toolkit</u> <u>Intrinsics</u> library (Xt).  See the <b>Actions</b> section.

       <b>trimSelection</b> (class <b>TrimSelection</b>)
               If  you  set  <b>highlightSelection</b>,  you can see the text which is selected, including any trailing
               spaces.  Clearing the screen (or a line) resets it to a state containing no spaces.   Some  lines
               may  contain trailing spaces when an application writes them to the screen.  However, you may not
               wish to paste lines with trailing spaces.  If this resource is true,  <u>xterm</u>  will  trim  trailing
               spaces  from  text  which is selected.  It does not affect spaces which result in a wrapped line,
               nor will it trim the trailing newline from your selection.  The default is “false”.

       <b>underLine</b> (class <b>UnderLine</b>)
               This specifies whether or not text with the underline attribute should be underlined.  It may  be
               desirable  to  disable  underlining  when  color  is being used for the underline attribute.  The
               default is “true”.

       <b>useBorderClipping</b> (class <b>UseBorderClipping</b>)
               Tell <u>xterm</u> whether to apply clipping when <b>useClipping</b> is false.  Unlike <b>useClipping</b>, this  simply
               limits  text  to  keep  it  within  the  window borders, e.g., as a refinement to the <b>scaleHeight</b>
               workaround.  The default is “false”.

       <b>useClipping</b> (class <b>UseClipping</b>)
               Tell <u>xterm</u> whether to use clipping to keep from producing dots outside  the  text  drawing  area.
               Originally  used  to  work around for overstriking effects, this is also needed to work with some
               incorrectly-sized fonts.  The default is “true”.

       <b>utf8</b> (class <b>Utf8</b>)
               This specifies whether <u>xterm</u> will run in UTF-8 mode.  If you set this resource, <u>xterm</u>  also  sets
               the  <b>wideChars</b>  resource  as  a  side-effect.   The resource can be set via the menu entry “UTF-8
               Encoding”.  The default is “default”.

               <u>Xterm</u> accepts either a keyword (ignoring case) or the number shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                  UTF-8 mode is initially off.  The command-line option <b>+u8</b> sets the  resource  to  this  value.
                  Escape sequences for turning UTF-8 mode on/off are allowed.

               true (1)
                  UTF-8 mode is initially on.  Escape sequences for turning UTF-8 mode on/off are allowed.

               always (2)
                  The  command-line  option  <b>-u8</b>  sets the resource to this value.  Escape sequences for turning
                  UTF-8 mode on/off are ignored.

               default (3)
                  This is the default value of the resource.  It is changed during initialization  depending  on
                  whether  the <b>locale</b> resource was set, to false (0) or always (2).  See the <b>locale</b> resource for
                  additional discussion of non-UTF-8 locales.

               If you want to set the value of <b>utf8</b>, it should be in  this  range.   Other  nonzero  values  are
               treated the same as “1”, i.e., UTF-8 mode is initially on, and escape sequences for turning UTF-8
               mode on/off are allowed.

       <b>utf8Fonts</b> (class <b>Utf8Fonts</b>)
               See  the  discussion  of  the <b>locale</b> resource.  This specifies whether <u>xterm</u> will use UTF-8 fonts
               specified via resource patterns such as “<b>*vt100.utf8Fonts.font</b>” or normal (ISO-8859-1) fonts  via
               patterns  such  as “<b>*vt100.font</b>”.  The resource can be set via the menu entry “<b>UTF-8</b> <b>Fonts</b>”.  The
               default is “default”.

               <u>Xterm</u> accepts either a keyword (ignoring case) or the number shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                      Use the ISO-8859-1 fonts.  The menu entry is enabled, allowing the choice of fonts  to  be
                      changed at runtime.

               true (1)
                      Use  the  UTF-8  fonts.   The  menu  entry  is enabled, allowing the choice of fonts to be
                      changed at runtime.

               always (2)
                      Always use the UTF-8 fonts.  This also disables the menu entry.

               default (3)
                      At startup, the resource is set to true or false, according to the effective value of  the
                      <b>utf8</b> resource.

       <b>utf8Latin1</b> (class <b>Utf8Latin1</b>)
               If true, allow an ISO-8859-1 <u>normal</u> font to be combined with an ISO-10646-1 font if the latter is
               given via the <b>-fw</b> option or its corresponding resource value.  The default is “false”.

       <b>utf8SelectTypes</b> (class <b>Utf8SelectTypes</b>)
               Override  <u>xterm</u>'s  default  selection  target  list  (see  <b>SELECT/PASTE</b>)  for selections in wide-
               character (UTF-8) mode.  The default is an empty  string,  i.e.,  “”,  which  does  not  override
               anything.

       <b>utf8Title</b> (class <b>Utf8Title</b>)
               Applications can set <u>xterm</u>'s title by writing a control sequence.  Normally this control sequence
               follows  the  VT220  convention,  which  encodes the string in ISO-8859-1 and allows for an 8-bit
               string terminator.  If <u>xterm</u> is started in a UTF-8 locale, it translates the ISO-8859-1 string to
               UTF-8 to work with the X libraries which assume the string is UTF-8.

               However, some users may wish to write a title string encoded in UTF-8.   The  window  manager  is
               responsible  for drawing window titles.  Some window managers (not all) support UTF-8 encoding of
               window titles.  Set this resource to “true” to also set UTF-8 encoded  title  strings  using  the
               EWMH properties.

               This feature is available as a menu entry, since it is related to the particular applications you
               are  running  within  <u>xterm</u>.   You  can also use a control sequence (see the discussion of “Title
               Modes” in <u>Xterm</u> <u>Control</u> <u>Sequences</u>), to set an equivalent flag (which can also be  set  using  the
               <b>titleModes</b> resource).

               <u>Xterm</u> accepts either a keyword (ignoring case) or the number shown in parentheses:

               false (0)
                      Set  only  ISO-8859-1  title  strings, e.g., using the ICCCM <b>WM_NAME</b> STRING property.  The
                      menu entry is enabled, allowing the choice of title-strings to be changed at runtime.

               true (1)
                      Set both the EWMH (UTF-8 strings) and the ICCCM <b>WM_NAME</b>, etc.  The menu entry is  enabled,
                      allowing the choice to be changed at runtime.

               always (2)
                      Always  set  both the EWMH (UTF-8 strings) and the ICCCM <b>WM_NAME</b>, etc.  This also disables
                      the menu entry.

               default (3)
                      At startup, the resource is set to true or false, according to the effective value of  the
                      <b>utf8</b> resource.

               The default is “default”.

       <b>utf8Weblike</b> (class <b>Utf8Weblike</b>)
               Provide an alternate error-handling scheme for ill-formed UTF-8 as recommended in a W3C document.
               The  Unicode  standard does not require this for conformance.  Some additional information can be
               found here:

               https://invisible-island.net/xterm/bad-utf8/

               The default is “false”.

       <b>veryBoldColors</b> (class <b>VeryBoldColors</b>)
               Specifies whether to combine video attributes with colors specified by <b>colorBD</b>, <b>colorBL</b>, <b>colorIT</b>,
               <b>colorRV</b>, and <b>colorUL</b>.  The resource value is the sum of values for each attribute:
                 1 for reverse,
                 2 for underline,
                 4 for bold,
                 8 for blink, and
                 512 for italic

               The default is “0”.

       <b>visualBell</b> (class <b>VisualBell</b>)
               Specifies whether or not a visible bell (i.e., flashing) should be used  instead  of  an  audible
               bell  when  Control-G  is  received.  The default is “false”, which tells <u>xterm</u> to use an audible
               bell.

       <b>visualBellDelay</b> (class <b>VisualBellDelay</b>)
               Number of milliseconds to delay when displaying a visual bell.  Default is 100.  If set to  zero,
               no  visual  bell  is displayed.  This is useful for very slow displays, e.g., an LCD display on a
               laptop.

       <b>visualBellLine</b> (class <b>VisualBellLine</b>)
               Specifies whether to flash only the current line  when  displaying  a  visual  bell  rather  than
               flashing the entire screen: The default is “false”, which tells <u>xterm</u> to flash the entire screen.

       <b>vt100Graphics</b> (class <b>VT100Graphics</b>)
               This  specifies  whether  <u>xterm</u>  will interpret VT100 graphic character escape sequences while in
               UTF-8 mode.  This feature also applies to code-pages (e.g., for VT320  and  VT520)  and  National
               Replacement  Character  Sets  (VT220  and up), but not US-ASCII (the initially selected character
               set), to avoid conflict with UTF-8.  The default is “true”, to provide support for various legacy
               applications.

       <b>wideBoldFont</b> (class <b>WideBoldFont</b>)
               This option specifies the font to be used for displaying bold wide text.   By  default,  it  will
               attempt  to  use  a  font  twice  as wide as the font that will be used to draw bold text.  If no
               double-width font is found, it will improvise, by stretching the bold font.

       <b>wideChars</b> (class <b>WideChars</b>)
               Specifies if <u>xterm</u> should respond to control  sequences  that  process  16-bit  characters.   The
               default is “false”.

       <b>wideFont</b> (class <b>WideFont</b>)
               This  option specifies the font to be used for displaying wide text.  By default, it will attempt
               to use a font twice as wide as the font that will be used to draw normal  text.   If  no  double-
               width font is found, it will improvise, by stretching the normal font.

       <b>xftMaxGlyphMemory</b> (class <b>XftMaxGlyphMemory</b>)
               Set  the  Xft  library's  limit  on glyph memory (typically 4Mb).  When it reaches this limit, it
               discards “randomly chosen” glyphs to make room for new ones.  The default is  “0”  to  use  Xft's
               default value.

       <b>xftMaxUnrefFonts</b> (class <b>XftMaxUnrefFonts</b>)
               Set  the  Xft  library's  limit  on  fonts  which have been loaded (typically 16), e.g., matching
               patterns for fallback searches, but are not actually used.  The  default  is  “0”  to  use  Xft's
               default value.

       <b>xftTrackMemUsage</b> (class <b>XftTrackMemUsage</b>)
               Enables  glyph memory tracking (introduced in Xft 2.3.5), which allows Xft to efficiently discard
               obsolete data when running short of memory.  The default is “false”.

       <b>ximFont</b> (class <b>XimFont</b>)
               This option specifies the font to be used for displaying the preedit string in the  “OverTheSpot”
               input method.

               In “OverTheSpot” preedit type, the preedit (preconversion) string is displayed at the position of
               the cursor.  It is the XIM server's responsibility to display the preedit string.  The XIM client
               must  inform the XIM server of the cursor position.  For best results, the preedit string must be
               displayed with a proper font.  Therefore, <u>xterm</u> informs the XIM server of the proper  font.   The
               font  is  be supplied by a "fontset", whose default value is “*”.  This matches every font, the X
               library automatically chooses fonts with proper charsets.  The <b>ximFont</b> resource  is  provided  to
               override this default font setting.

   <b>Tek4014</b> <b>Widget</b> <b>Resources</b>
       The following resources are specified as part of the <u>tek4014</u> widget (class <u>Tek4014</u>).  These are specified
       by patterns such as “<b>XTerm.tek4014.</b><u>NAME</u>”:

       <b>font2</b> (class <b>Font</b>)
               Specifies font number 2 to use in the Tektronix window.

       <b>font3</b> (class <b>Font</b>)
               Specifies font number 3 to use in the Tektronix window.

       <b>fontLarge</b> (class <b>Font</b>)
               Specifies the large font to use in the Tektronix window.

       <b>fontSmall</b> (class <b>Font</b>)
               Specifies the small font to use in the Tektronix window.

       <b>ginTerminator</b> (class <b>GinTerminator</b>)
               Specifies  what  character(s) should follow a GIN report or status report.  The possibilities are
               “none”, which sends no terminating characters, “CRonly”, which  sends  CR,  and  “CR&amp;EOT”,  which
               sends both CR and EOT.  The default is “none”.

       <b>height</b> (class <b>Height</b>)
               Specifies the height of the Tektronix window in pixels.

       <b>initialFont</b> (class <b>InitialFont</b>)
               Specifies  which  of  the  four Tektronix fonts to use initially.  Values are the same as for the
               <b>set-tek-text</b> action.  The default is “large”.

       <b>width</b> (class <b>Width</b>)
               Specifies the width of the Tektronix window in pixels.

   <b>Menu</b> <b>Resources</b>
       The resources that may be specified for the various menus are described  in  the  documentation  for  the
       <u>Athena</u>  <b>SimpleMenu</b>  widget.   The  name and classes of the entries in each of the menus are listed below.
       Resources named “<b>line</b><u>N</u>” where <u>N</u> is a number are separators with class <b>SmeLine</b>.

       As with all X resource-based widgets, the labels mentioned are customary defaults for the application.

       The <b>Main</b> <b>Options</b> menu (widget name <u>mainMenu</u>) has the following entries:

       <b>toolbar</b> (class <b>SmeBSB</b>)
               This entry invokes the <b>set-toolbar(</b><u>toggle</u><b>)</b> action.

       <b>securekbd</b> (class <b>SmeBSB</b>)
               This entry invokes the <b>secure()</b> action.

       <b>allowsends</b> (class <b>SmeBSB</b>)
               This entry invokes the <b>allow-send-events(</b><u>toggle</u><b>)</b> action.

       <b>redraw</b> (class <b>SmeBSB</b>)
               This entry invokes the <b>redraw()</b> action.

       <b>logging</b> (class <b>SmeBSB</b>)
               This entry invokes the <b>logging(</b><u>toggle</u><b>)</b> action.

       <b>print-immediate</b> (class <b>SmeBSB</b>)
               This entry invokes the <b>print-immediate()</b> action.

       <b>print-on-error</b> (class <b>SmeBSB</b>)
               This entry invokes the <b>print-on-error()</b> action.

       <b>print</b> (class <b>SmeBSB</b>)

   <b>Scrollbar</b> <b>Resources</b>
       The following resources are useful when specified for the <u>Athena</u> Scrollbar widget:

       <b>background</b> (class <b>Background</b>)
               Specifies the color to use for the background of the scrollbar.

       <b>foreground</b> (class <b>Foreground</b>)
               Specifies the color to use for the foreground of the scrollbar.

       <b>thickness</b> (class <b>Thickness</b>)
               Specifies the width in pixels of the scrollbar (default: 14).

               This may be overridden by the <b>width</b> resource.

       <b>thumb</b> (class <b>Thumb</b>)
               The  default  “thumb”  pixmap used for the scrollbar is a simple checkerboard pattern alternating
               pixels for foreground and background color.

       <b>width</b> (class <b>Width</b>)
               Specifies the width in pixels of the scrollbar (default: 0).

               The widget checks the <u>width</u> resource first, using the <u>thickness</u> value if the <u>width</u> is zero.

</pre><h4><b>POINTER</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Once the VT<u>xxx</u> window is created, <u>xterm</u> allows you to select text and copy it within the  same  or  other
       windows using the <u>pointer</u> or the keyboard.

       A  “pointer”  could  be a mouse, touchpad or similar device.  X applications generally do not care, since
       they see only <u>button</u> <u>events</u> which have

       •   position and

       •   button up/down state

       <u>Xterm</u> can see these events as long as it has <u>focus</u>.

       The keyboard also supplies events, but it is less flexible than the pointer for selecting/copying text.

       <u>Events</u> are applied to <u>actions</u> using the <b>translations</b> resource.  See <b>Actions</b>  for  a  complete  list,  and
       <b>Default</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Bindings</b> for the built-in set of <b>translations</b> resources.

   <b>Selection</b> <b>Functions</b>
       By  default, the selection functions are invoked when the pointer buttons are used with no modifiers, and
       when they are used with the “shift” key.  The “shift” key is special, because <u>xterm</u> uses that  to  ensure
       that selection functions are still available when it is programmed to send escape sequences in one of the
       mouse modes (see <u>Xterm</u> <u>Control</u> <u>Sequences</u>, as well as the resource <b>disallowedMouseOps</b>).

       At  startup,  <u>xterm</u>  inspects  the <b>translations</b> resource to see which pointer buttons may be used in this
       way, and remembers these buttons when deciding whether to send escape sequences or perform selection when
       those buttons are used with the “shift” modifier.  Other pointer buttons, e.g., typically those sent  for
       wheel mouse events, are not affected.

       The  assignment  of the functions described below to keys and buttons may be changed through the resource
       database; see <b>Actions</b> below.

       Pointer button one (usually left)
            is used to save text into the cut buffer:

                ~Meta &lt;Btn1Down&gt;:<b>select-start</b>()

            Move the cursor to beginning of the text, and then hold the button down while moving the  cursor  to
            the  end  of  the region and releasing the button.  The selected text is highlighted and is saved in
            the global <u>cut</u> <u>buffer</u> and made the selection when the button is released:

                &lt;BtnUp&gt;:<b>select-end</b>(<b>SELECT</b>, <b>CUT_BUFFER0</b>) \n

            Normally (but see the discussion of <b>on2Clicks</b>, etc):

            •   Double-clicking selects by words.

            •   Triple-clicking selects by lines.

            •   Quadruple-clicking goes back to characters, etc.

            Multiple-click is determined by the time from button up to  button  down,  so  you  can  change  the
            selection unit in the middle of a selection.  Logical words and lines selected by double- or triple-
            clicking may wrap across more than one screen line if lines were wrapped by <u>xterm</u> itself rather than
            by the application running in the window.  If the key/button bindings specify that an X selection is
            to be made, <u>xterm</u> will leave the selected text highlighted for as long as it is the selection owner.

       Pointer button two (usually middle)
            “types” (<u>pastes</u>) the text from the given selection, if any, otherwise from the cut buffer, inserting
            it as keyboard input:

                ~Ctrl ~Meta &lt;Btn2Up&gt;:<b>insert-selection(SELECT,</b> <b>CUT_BUFFER0)</b>

       Pointer button three (usually right)
            <u>extends</u> the current selection.

                ~Ctrl ~Meta &lt;Btn3Down&gt;:<b>start-extend()</b>

            (Without  loss  of  generality,  you  can  swap  “right”  and  “left” everywhere in the rest of this
            paragraph.)  If pressed while closer  to  the  right  edge  of  the  selection  than  the  left,  it
            extends/contracts the right edge of the selection.  If you contract the selection past the left edge
            of  the  selection,  <u>xterm</u>  assumes you really meant the left edge, restores the original selection,
            then extends/contracts the left edge of the selection.  Extension starts in the selection unit  mode
            that the last selection or extension was performed in; you can multiple-click to cycle through them.

       By  cutting  and pasting pieces of text without trailing new lines, you can take text from several places
       in different windows and form a command to the shell, for example, or take  output  from  a  program  and
       insert it into your favorite editor.  Since cut buffers are globally shared among different applications,
       you  may  regard each as a “file” whose contents you know.  The terminal emulator and other text programs
       should be treating it as if it were a text file, i.e., the text is delimited by new lines.

   <b>Scrolling</b>
       The scroll region displays the position and amount of text currently showing in the window  (highlighted)
       relative  to  the  amount of text actually saved.  As more text is saved (up to the maximum), the size of
       the highlighted area decreases.

       Clicking button one with the pointer in the scroll region moves the adjacent  line  to  the  top  of  the
       display window.

       Clicking button three moves the top line of the display window down to the pointer position.

       Clicking  button  two moves the display to a position in the saved text that corresponds to the pointer's
       position in the scrollbar.

   <b>Tektronix</b> <b>Pointer</b>
       Unlike the VT<u>xxx</u> window, the Tektronix window does  not  allow  the  copying  of  text.   It  does  allow
       Tektronix  GIN  mode, and in this mode the cursor will change from an arrow to a cross.  Pressing any key
       will send that key and the current coordinate of the cross cursor.  Pressing button one,  two,  or  three
       will  return  the  letters “l”, “m”, and “r”, respectively.  If the “shift” key is pressed when a pointer
       button is pressed, the corresponding upper case letter is sent.  To distinguish a pointer button  from  a
       key,  the high bit of the character is set (but this is bit is normally stripped unless the terminal mode
       is RAW; see <u><a href="../man4/tty.4.html">tty</a></u>(4) for details).

</pre><h4><b>SELECT/PASTE</b></h4><pre>
       X clients provide select and paste support by responding to requests conveyed by the  X  server.   The  X
       server  holds  data  in “atoms” which correspond to the different types of selection (<b>PRIMARY</b>, <b>SECONDARY</b>,
       <b>CLIPBOARD</b>) as well as  the  similar  cut  buffer  mechanism  (<b>CUT_BUFFER0</b>  to  <b>CUT_BUFFER7</b>).   Those  are
       documented in the ICCCM.

       The  ICCCM  deals with the underlying mechanism for select/paste.  It does not mention <u>highlighting</u>.  The
       <u>selection</u> is not the same as <u>highlighting</u>.  <u>Xterm</u> (like many applications) uses highlighting to show  you
       the  currently  selected text.  An X application may <u>own</u> a selection, which allows it to be the source of
       data copied using a  given  selection  atom  <u>Xterm</u>  may  continue  owning  a  selection  after  it  stops
       highlighting (see <b>keepSelection</b>).

   <b>PRIMARY</b>
       When  configured to use the primary selection (the default), <u>xterm</u> can provide the selection data in ways
       which help to retain character encoding information as it is pasted.

       The <b>PRIMARY</b> token  is  a  standard  X  feature,  documented  in  the  ICCCM  (<u>Inter-Client</u>  <u>Communication</u>
       <u>Conventions</u> <u>Manual</u>), which states

          The  selection named by the atom <b>PRIMARY</b> is used for all commands that take only a single argument and
          is the principal means of communication between clients that use the selection mechanism.

       A user “selects” text on <u>xterm</u>, which highlights the selected text.   A  subsequent  “paste”  to  another
       client  forwards  a  request to the client owning the selection.  If <u>xterm</u> owns the primary selection, it
       makes the data available in the form of one or more “selection targets”.  If it does not own the  primary
       selection, e.g., if it has released it or another client has asserted ownership, it relies on cut-buffers
       to  pass  the  data.   But  cut-buffers handle only ISO-8859-1 data (officially - some clients ignore the
       rules).

   <b>CLIPBOARD</b>
       When configured to use the clipboard (using the <b>selectToClipboard</b> resource), the problem with persistence
       of ownership is bypassed.  Otherwise, there is no difference regarding the data which can be  passed  via
       selection.

       The  <b>selectToClipboard</b>  resource  is  a compromise, allowing <b>CLIPBOARD</b> to be treated almost like <b>PRIMARY</b>,
       unlike the ICCCM, which describes <b>CLIPBOARD</b> in different terms than <b>PRIMARY</b> or  <b>SECONDARY</b>.   Its  lengthy
       explanation begins with the essential points:

          The  selection  named  by  the  atom  CLIPBOARD is used to hold data that is being transferred between
          clients, that is, data that usually is being cut and then pasted or copied and then pasted.   Whenever
          a client wants to transfer data to the clipboard:

          •   It should assert ownership of the CLIPBOARD.

          •   If  it  succeeds  in  acquiring  ownership,  it should be prepared to respond to a request for the
              contents of the CLIPBOARD in the usual way (retaining the data to be  able  to  return  it).   The
              request may be generated by the clipboard client described below.

   <b>SELECT</b>
       However,  many applications use <b>CLIPBOARD</b> in imitation of other windowing systems.  The <b>selectToClipboard</b>
       resource (and corresponding menu entry <b>Select</b> <b>to</b> <b>Clipboard</b>) introduce the <b>SELECT</b>  token  (known  only  to
       <u>xterm</u>) which chooses between the <b>PRIMARY</b> and <b>CLIPBOARD</b> tokens.

       Without using this feature, one can use workarounds such as the <u>xclip</u> program to show the contents of the
       X clipboard within an <u>xterm</u> window.

   <b>SECONDARY</b>
       This is used less often than <b>PRIMARY</b> or <b>CLIPBOARD</b>.  According to the ICCCM, it is used

       •   As the second argument to commands taking two arguments (for example, “exchange primary and secondary
           selections”)

       •   As  a means of obtaining data when there is a primary selection and the user does not want to disturb
           it

   <b>Selection</b> <b>Targets</b>
       The different types of data which are passed depend on what the receiving client  asks  for.   These  are
       termed <u>selection</u> <u>targets</u>.

       When asking for the selection data, <u>xterm</u> tries the following types in this order:

            UTF8_STRING
                 This  is  an XFree86 extension, which denotes that the data is encoded in UTF-8.  When <u>xterm</u> is
                 built with wide-character support, it both accepts and provides this type.

            TEXT the text is in the encoding which corresponds to your current locale.

            COMPOUND_TEXT
                 this is a format for multiple character set data, such as multi-lingual  text.   It  can  store
                 UTF-8 data as a special case.

            STRING
                 This is Latin 1 (ISO-8859-1) data.

       The middle two (TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT) are added if <u>xterm</u> is configured with the <b>i18nSelections</b> resource
       set to “true”.

       UTF8_STRING  is  preferred  (therefore  first  in  the list) since <u>xterm</u> stores text as Unicode data when
       running in wide-character mode, and no translation is needed.  On the other hand, TEXT and  COMPOUND_TEXT
       may  require  translation.   If the translation is incomplete, they will insert X's “defaultString” whose
       value cannot be set, and may simply be empty.  <u>Xterm</u>'s <b>defaultString</b> resource specifies the string to use
       for incomplete translations of the UTF8_STRING.

       You can alter the types which <u>xterm</u> tries using the  <b>eightBitSelectTypes</b>  or  <b>utf8SelectTypes</b>  resources.
       For  instance,  you  might  have  some  specific  locale  setting which does not use UTF-8 encoding.  The
       resource value is a comma-separated list of the selection targets, which consist of the names shown.  You
       can use the special name I18N to denote the optional inclusion of TEXT and COMPOUND_TEXT.  The names  are
       matched ignoring case, and can be abbreviated.  The default list can be expressed in several ways, e.g.,

              UTF8_STRING,I18N,STRING
              utf8,i18n,string
              u,i,s

   <b>Mouse</b> <b>Protocol</b>
       Applications can send escape sequences to <u>xterm</u> to cause it to send escape sequences back to the computer
       when  you press a pointer button, or even (depending on which escape sequence) send escape sequences back
       to the computer as you move the pointer.

       These escape sequences and the responses, called the <u>mouse</u> <u>protocol</u>,  are  documented  in  <u>XTerm</u>  <u>Control</u>
       <u>Sequences</u>.   They  do not appear in the <u>actions</u> invoked by the <b>translations</b> resource because the resource
       does not change while you run <u>xterm</u>, whereas applications can change the mouse  prototol  (i.e.,  enable,
       disable, use different modes).

       However,  the  mouse  protocol  is  interpreted  within  the <u>actions</u> that are usually associated with the
       pointer buttons.  <u>Xterm</u> ignores the mouse protocol in the <b>insert-selection</b> action  if  the  shift-key  is
       pressed  at  the  same  time.   It  also  modifies a few other actions if the shift-key is pressed, e.g.,
       suppressing the response with the pointer position, though not eliminating changes to the selected text.

</pre><h4><b>MENUS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xterm</u> has four menus, named <u>mainMenu</u>, <u>vtMenu</u>, <u>fontMenu</u>, and <u>tekMenu</u>.  Each menu pops up under the correct
       combinations of key and button presses.  Each menu is divided into sections, separated  by  a  horizontal
       line.   Some  menu  entries correspond to modes that can be altered.  A check mark appears next to a mode
       that is currently active.  Selecting one of these modes  toggles  its  state.   Other  menu  entries  are
       commands; selecting one of these performs the indicated function.

       All  of the menu entries correspond to X actions.  In the list below, the menu label is shown followed by
       the action's name in parenthesis.

   <b>Main</b> <b>Options</b>
       The <u>xterm</u> <u>mainMenu</u> pops up when the “control” key and pointer button one are pressed in a  window.   This
       menu contains items that apply to both the VT<u>xxx</u> and Tektronix windows.  There are several sections:

       Commands for managing X events:

              <b>Toolbar</b> (resource <b>toolbar</b>)
                     Clicking on the “Toolbar” menu entry hides the toolbar if it is visible, and shows it if it
                     is not.

              <b>Secure</b> <b>Keyboard</b> (resource <b>securekbd</b>)
                     The  <b>Secure</b> <b>Keyboard</b> mode is helpful when typing in passwords or other sensitive data in an
                     unsecure environment (see <b>SECURITY</b> below, but read the limitations carefully).

              <b>Allow</b> <b>SendEvents</b> (resource <b>allowsends</b>)
                     Specifies whether or not synthetic key and button events generated  using  the  X  protocol
                     SendEvent   request   should   be  interpreted  or  discarded.   This  corresponds  to  the
                     <b>allowSendEvents</b> resource.

              <b>Redraw</b> <b>Window</b> (resource <b>redraw</b>)
                     Forces the X display to repaint; useful in some environments.

       Commands for capturing output:

              <b>Log</b> <b>to</b> <b>File</b> (resource <b>logging</b>)
                     Captures text sent to the screen in a log file, as in the <b>-l</b> logging option.

              <b>Print-All</b> <b>Immediately</b> (resource <b>print-immediate</b>)
                     Invokes the <b>print-immediate</b> action, sending the text of the current window  directly  to  a
                     file,  as  specified  by  the <b>printFileImmediate</b>, <b>printModeImmediate</b> and <b>printOptsImmediate</b>
                     resources.

              <b>Print-All</b> <b>on</b> <b>Error</b> (resource <b>print-on-error</b>)
                     Invokes the <b>print-on-error</b> action, which toggles a flag telling <u>xterm</u> that if it exits with
                     an X error, to send the text of the current window directly to a file, as specified by  the
                     <b>printFileOnXError</b>, <b>printModeOnXError</b> and <b>printOptsOnXError</b> resources.

              <b>Print</b> <b>Window</b> (resource <b>print</b>)
                     Sends the text of the current window to the program given in the <b>printerCommand</b> resource.

              <b>Redirect</b> <b>to</b> <b>Printer</b> (resource <b>print-redir</b>)
                     This  sets the <b>printerControlMode</b> to 0 or 2.  You can use this to turn the printer on as if
                     an application had sent the appropriate control sequence.  It is also useful for  switching
                     the printer off if an application turns it on without resetting the print control mode.

              <b>XHTML</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>Dump</b> (resource <b>dump-html</b>)
                     Available only when compiled with screen dump support.  Invokes the <b>dump-html</b> action.  This
                     creates  an  XHTML  file matching the contents of the current screen, including the border,
                     internal border, colors and most attributes: bold,  italic,  underline,  faint,  strikeout,
                     reverse;  blink  is  rendered  as  white-on-red;  double  underline is rendered the same as
                     underline since there is no portable equivalent in CSS 2.2.

                     The font is whatever your browser uses for preformatted (&lt;pre&gt;) elements.  The  XHTML  file
                     references  a cascading style sheet (CSS) named “<b>xterm.css</b>” that you can create to select a
                     font or override properties.

                     The following CSS selectors are used with the expected default behavior in the XHTML file:

                     <u>.ul</u> for underline,
                     <u>.bd</u> for bold,
                     <u>.it</u> for italic,
                     <u>.st</u> for strikeout,
                     <u>.lu</u> for strikeout combined with underline.

                     In addition you may use

                     <u>.ev</u> to affect even numbered lines and
                     <u>.od</u> to affect odd numbered lines.

                     Attributes faint, reverse and blink are  implemented  as  <u>style</u>  attributes  setting  color
                     properties.   All colors are specified as RGB percentages in order to support displays with
                     10 bits per RGB.

                     The name of the file will be

                         <b>xterm.</b><u>yyyy</u><b>.</b><u>MM</u><b>.</b><u>dd</u><b>.</b><u>hh</u><b>.</b><u>mm</u><b>.</b><u>ss</u>.xhtml

                     where <u>yyyy</u>, <u>MM</u>, <u>dd</u>, <u>hh</u>, <u>mm</u> and <u>ss</u> are the year, month, day, hour, minute  and  second  when
                     the screen dump was performed (the file is created in the directory <u>xterm</u> is started in, or
                     the home directory for a login <u>xterm</u>).

                     The <b>dump-html</b> action can also be triggered using the Media Copy control sequence CSI 1 0 i,
                     for example from a shell script with

                         printf '\033[10i'

                     Only the UTF-8 encoding is supported.

              <b>SVG</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>Dump</b> (resource <b>dump-svg</b>)
                     Available  only when compiled with screen dump support.  Invokes the <b>dump-svg</b> action.  This
                     creates a Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file matching the contents of the current  screen,
                     including the border, internal border, colors and most attributes: bold, italic, underline,
                     double  underline,  faint, strikeout, reverse; blink is rendered as white-on-red.  The font
                     is whatever your renderer uses for the <u>monospace</u> font-family.  All colors are specified  as
                     RGB percentages in order to support displays with 10 bits per RGB.

                     The name of the file will be

                         <b>xterm.</b><u>yyyy</u><b>.</b><u>MM</u><b>.</b><u>dd</u><b>.</b><u>hh</u><b>.</b><u>mm</u><b>.</b><u>ss</u>.svg

                     where  <u>yyyy</u>,  <u>MM</u>,  <u>dd</u>, <u>hh</u>, <u>mm</u> and <u>ss</u> are the year, month, day, hour, minute and second when
                     the screen dump was performed (the file is created in the directory <u>xterm</u> is started in, or
                     the home directory for a login <u>xterm</u>).

                     The <b>dump-svg</b> action can also be triggered using the Media Copy control sequence CSI 1 1  i,
                     for example from a shell script with

                         printf '\033[11i'

                     Only the UTF-8 encoding is supported.

       Modes for setting keyboard style:

              <b>8-Bit</b> <b>Controls</b> (resource <b>8-bit-control</b>)
                     Enabled  for VT220 emulation, this controls whether <u>xterm</u> will send 8-bit control sequences
                     rather than using 7-bit (ASCII) controls, e.g., sending a byte in the range 128–159  rather
                     than  the  escape  character followed by a second byte.  <u>Xterm</u> always interprets both 8-bit
                     and 7-bit control sequences  (see  <u>Xterm</u>  <u>Control</u>  <u>Sequences</u>).   This  corresponds  to  the
                     <b>eightBitControl</b> resource.

              <b>Backarrow</b> <b>Key</b> <b>(BS/DEL)</b> (resource <b>backarrow</b> <b>key</b>)
                     Modifies  the  behavior  of the backarrow key, making it transmit either a backspace (8) or
                     delete (127) character.  This corresponds to the <b>backarrowKey</b> resource.

              <b>Alt/NumLock</b> <b>Modifiers</b> (resource <b>num-lock</b>)
                     Controls the treatment of Alt- and NumLock-key modifiers.  This corresponds to the  <b>numLock</b>
                     resource.

              <b>Meta</b> <b>Sends</b> <b>Escape</b> (resource <b>meta-esc</b>)
                     Controls  whether  <u>Meta</u> keys are converted into a two-character sequence with the character
                     itself preceded by ESC.  This corresponds to the <b>metaSendsEscape</b> resource.

              <b>Delete</b> <b>is</b> <b>DEL</b> (resource <b>delete-is-del</b>)
                     Controls whether the Delete key on  the  editing  keypad  should  send  DEL  (127)  or  the
                     VT220-style Remove escape sequence.  This corresponds to the <b>deleteIsDEL</b> resource.

              <b>Old</b> <b>Function-Keys</b> (resource <b>oldFunctionKeys</b>)

              <b>HP</b> <b>Function-Keys</b> (resource <b>hpFunctionKeys</b>)

              <b>SCO</b> <b>Function-Keys</b> (resource <b>scoFunctionKeys</b>)

              <b>Sun</b> <b>Function-Keys</b> (resource <b>sunFunctionKeys</b>)

              <b>VT220</b> <b>Keyboard</b> (resource <b>sunKeyboard</b>)
                     These  act  as  a  radio-button,  selecting  one style for the keyboard layout.  The layout
                     corresponds  to   more   than   one   resource   setting:   <b>sunKeyboard</b>,   <b>sunFunctionKeys</b>,
                     <b>scoFunctionKeys</b> and <b>hpFunctionKeys</b>.

       Commands for process signalling:

              <b>Send</b> <b>STOP</b> <b>Signal</b> (resource <b>suspend</b>)

              <b>Send</b> <b>CONT</b> <b>Signal</b> (resource <b>continue</b>)

              <b>Send</b> <b>INT</b> <b>Signal</b> (resource <b>interrupt</b>)

              <b>Send</b> <b>HUP</b> <b>Signal</b> (resource <b>hangup</b>)

              <b>Send</b> <b>TERM</b> <b>Signal</b> (resource <b>terminate</b>)

              <b>Send</b> <b>KILL</b> <b>Signal</b> (resource <b>kill</b>)
                     These  send the SIGTSTP, SIGCONT, SIGINT, SIGHUP, SIGTERM and SIGKILL signals respectively,
                     to the process group of the process running under <u>xterm</u> (usually the shell).   The  <b>SIGCONT</b>
                     function  is  especially  useful  if the user has accidentally typed CTRL-Z, suspending the
                     process.

              <b>Quit</b> (resource <b>quit</b>)
                     Stop processing X events except to support the <b>-hold</b> option, and then send a SIGHUP  signal
                     to the process group of the process running under <u>xterm</u> (usually the shell).

   <b>VT</b> <b>Options</b>
       The  <u>xterm</u>  <u>vtMenu</u> sets various modes in the VT<u>xxx</u> emulation, and is popped up when the “control” key and
       pointer button two are pressed in the VT<u>xxx</u> window.

       VT<u>xxx</u> Modes:

              <b>Enable</b> <b>Scrollbar</b> (resource <b>scrollbar</b>)
                     Enable (or disable) the scrollbar.  This corresponds to the <b>-sb</b> option  and  the  <b>scrollBar</b>
                     resource.

              <b>Enable</b> <b>Jump</b> <b>Scroll</b> (resource <b>jumpscroll</b>)
                     Enable  (or  disable) jump scrolling.  This corresponds to the <b>-j</b> option and the <b>jumpScroll</b>
                     resource.

              <b>Enable</b> <b>Reverse</b> <b>Video</b> (resource <b>reversevideo</b>)
                     Enable (or disable) reverse-video.  This corresponds to the <b>-rv</b> option and the <b>reverseVideo</b>
                     resource.

              <b>Enable</b> <b>Auto</b> <b>Wraparound</b> (resource <b>autowrap</b>)
                     Enable (or disable) auto-wraparound.  This corresponds to the <b>-aw</b> option and  the  <b>autoWrap</b>
                     resource.

              <b>Enable</b> <b>Reverse</b> <b>Wraparound</b> (resource <b>reversewrap</b>)
                     Enable  (or  disable)  reverse  wraparound.   This  corresponds  to  the <b>-rw</b> option and the
                     <b>reverseWrap</b> resource.

              <b>Enable</b> <b>Auto</b> <b>Linefeed</b> (resource <b>autolinefeed</b>)
                     Enable (or disable) auto-linefeed.  This is  the  VT102  NEL  function,  which  causes  the
                     emulator  to  emit  a  line  feed  after  each  carriage return.  There is no corresponding
                     command-line option or resource setting.

              <b>Enable</b> <b>Application</b> <b>Cursor</b> <b>Keys</b> (resource <b>appcursor</b>)
                     Enable (or disable) application cursor keys.   This  corresponds  to  the  <b>appcursorDefault</b>
                     resource.  There is no corresponding command-line option.

              <b>Enable</b> <b>Application</b> <b>Keypad</b> (resource <b>appkeypad</b>)
                     Enable  (or  disable)  application  keypad  keys.  This corresponds to the <b>appkeypadDefault</b>
                     resource.  There is no corresponding command-line option.

              <b>Scroll</b> <b>to</b> <b>Bottom</b> <b>on</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Press</b> (resource <b>scrollkey</b>)
                     Enable (or disable) scrolling to the bottom of the scrolling region on  a  keypress.   This
                     corresponds to the <b>-sk</b> option and the <b>scrollKey</b> resource.

                     As a special case, the XON / XOFF keys (control/S and control/Q) are ignored.

              <b>Scroll</b> <b>to</b> <b>Bottom</b> <b>on</b> <b>Tty</b> <b>Output</b> (resource <b>scrollttyoutput</b>)
                     Enable  (or  disable)  scrolling  to  the  bottom  of the scrolling region on output to the
                     terminal.  This corresponds to the <b>-si</b> option and the <b>scrollTtyOutput</b> resource.

              <b>Allow</b> <b>80/132</b> <b>Column</b> <b>Switching</b> (resource <b>allow132</b>)
                     Enable (or disable) switching between 80 and 132 columns.  This  corresponds  to  the  <b>-132</b>
                     option and the <b>c132</b> resource.

              <b>Keep</b> <b>Selection</b> (resource <b>keepSelection</b>)
                     Tell  <u>xterm</u>  whether  to  disown the selection when it stops highlighting it, e.g., when an
                     application modifies the display so that it no longer  matches  the  text  which  has  been
                     highlighted.   As  long  as  <u>xterm</u>  continues to own the selection for a given atom, it can
                     provide the corresponding text to other clients which  request  the  selection  using  that
                     atom.

                     This  corresponds  to  the  <b>keepSelection</b> resource.  There is no corresponding command-line
                     option.

                     Telling <u>xterm</u> to not disown the selection does not prevent other applications  from  taking
                     ownership  of  the selection.  When that happens, <u>xterm</u> receives notification that this has
                     happened, and removes its highlighting.

                     See <b>SELECT/PASTE</b> for more information.

              <b>Select</b> <b>to</b> <b>Clipboard</b> (resource <b>selectToClipboard</b>)
                     Tell <u>xterm</u> whether to use the <b>PRIMARY</b> or <b>CLIPBOARD</b> for <b>SELECT</b> tokens  in  the  <b>translations</b>
                     resource which maps keyboard and mouse actions to select/paste actions.

                     This corresponds to the <b>selectToClipboard</b> resource.  There is no corresponding command-line
                     option.

                     The  <b>keepSelection</b>  resource  setting  applies  to <b>CLIPBOARD</b> selections just as it does for
                     <b>PRIMARY</b> selections.  However some window  managers  treat  the  clipboard  specially.   For
                     instance, XQuartz's synchronization between the OSX <u>pasteboard</u> and the X11 <u>clipboard</u> causes
                     applications  to  lose  the selection ownership for that atom when a selection is copied to
                     the clipboard.

                     See <b>SELECT/PASTE</b> for more information.

              <b>Enable</b> <b>Visual</b> <b>Bell</b> (resource <b>visualbell</b>)
                     Enable (or disable) visible bell  (i.e.,  flashing)  instead  of  an  audible  bell.   This
                     corresponds to the <b>-vb</b> option and the <b>visualBell</b> resource.

              <b>Enable</b> <b>Bell</b> <b>Urgency</b> (resource <b>bellIsUrgent</b>)
                     Enable  (or  disable)  Urgency  window  manager  hint  when  Control-G  is  received.  This
                     corresponds to the <b>bellIsUrgent</b> resource.

              <b>Enable</b> <b>Pop</b> <b>on</b> <b>Bell</b> (resource <b>poponbell</b>)
                     Enable (or disable) raising of the window when Control-G is received.  This corresponds  to
                     the <b>-pop</b> option and the <b>popOnBell</b> resource.

              <b>Enable</b> <b>Blinking</b> <b>Cursor</b> (resource <b>cursorblink</b>)
                     Enable  (or  disable)  the blinking-cursor feature.  This corresponds to the <b>-bc</b> option and
                     the <b>cursorBlink</b> resource.  There are also escape sequences (see <u>Xterm</u> <u>Control</u> <u>Sequences</u>):

                     •   If the <b>cursorBlinkXOR</b> resource is set, the menu entry and the  escape  sequence  states
                         will  be XOR'd: if both are enabled, the cursor will not blink, if only one is enabled,
                         the cursor will blink.

                     •   If the <b>cursorBlinkXOR</b> is not set; if either the  menu  entry  or  the  escape  sequence
                         states are set, the cursor will blink.

                     In  either  case,  the  checkbox  for the menu shows the state of the <b>cursorBlink</b> resource,
                     which may not correspond to what the cursor is actually doing.

              <b>Enable</b> <b>Alternate</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>Switching</b> (resource <b>titeInhibit</b>)
                     Enable (or disable) switching between the normal and alternate screens.   This  corresponds
                     to the <b>titeInhibit</b> resource.  There is no corresponding command-line option.

              <b>Enable</b> <b>Active</b> <b>Icon</b> (resource <b>activeicon</b>)
                     Enable  (or  disable)  the active-icon feature.  This corresponds to the <b>-ai</b> option and the
                     <b>activeIcon</b> resource.

              <b>Sixel</b> <b>Scrolling</b> (resource <b>sixelScrolling</b>)
                     This corresponds to the <b>sixelScrolling</b> resource.  It can also be turned off  and  on  using
                     the private mode DECSDM (Sixel Display Mode).

                     •   When enabled, <u>xterm</u> draws sixel graphics at the current text cursor location, scrolling
                         the  image  vertically  if it is larger than the screen, and leaving the text cursor at
                         the same column in the next complete line after the image when returning to text mode

                         This is the default, which corresponds to the <u>reset</u> state of DECSDM.

                     •   When disabled, <u>xterm</u> draws sixel graphics starting at the upper  left  of  the  screen,
                         cropping to fit the screen, and does not alter the text cursor location.

                         This corresponds to the <u>set</u> state of DECSDM.

                     There is no corresponding command-line option.

              <b>Private</b> <b>Color</b> <b>Registers</b> (resource <b>privateColorRegisters</b>)
                     If  <u>xterm</u>  is  configured  to support ReGIS graphics, this controls whether a private color
                     palette can be used.

                     When enabled, each graphic image uses a  separate  set  of  color  registers,  so  that  it
                     essentially  has  a  private palette (this is the default).  If it is not set, all graphics
                     images share a common set of registers which is how sixel  and  ReGIS  graphics  worked  on
                     actual hardware.  The default is likely a more useful mode on modern TrueColor hardware.

                     This corresponds to the <b>privateColorRegisters</b> resource.  There is no corresponding command-
                     line option.

       VT<u>xxx</u> Commands:

              <b>Do</b> <b>Soft</b> <b>Reset</b> (resource <b>softreset</b>)
                     This corresponds to the VT220 DECSTR control sequence.  A soft reset leaves the contents of
                     the window intact, but resets modes which affect subsequent updates:

                     Soft reset differs from full reset in a minor detail:

                     •   Set the saved cursor position to the upper-left corner of the window.

                     •   Exit from the status-line without erasing it.

                     Both soft/full resets do the following:

                     •   Make  the  cursor  visible,  with  shape  reset  according  to  the <b>cursorUnderLine</b> and
                         <b>cursorBar</b> resources.

                     •   Enable or disable the cursor-blinking state according to the <b>cursorBlink</b> resource,  and
                         set the <u>Enable</u> <u>Blinking</u> <u>Cursor</u> menu checkmark to match.

                     •   Reset video attributes, e.g., bold, italic, underline, blink.

                     •   Reset the ANSI color mode to the <u>xterm</u> default foreground and background.

                     •   Reset the 256-color palette to its initial state.

                     •   Reset  the  selected  character  set,  e.g., ASCII, alternate character set.  The UTF-8
                         modes are not changed.

                     •   Reset ECMA-48 KAM.

                     •   Reset DECCKM and DECKPAM per resources <b>appcursorDefault</b> and <b>appkeypadDefault</b>.

                     •   Reset key-format and key-modifier modes to the values set by resources, i.e.,

                             <b>formatCursorKeys</b>,   <b>formatFunctionKeys</b>,    <b>formatKeypadKeys</b>,    <b>formatModifierKeys</b>,
                             <b>formatOtherKeys</b>, and <b>formatSpecialKeys</b>.

                         as well as

                             <b>modifyCursorKeys</b>,     <b>modifyFunctionKeys</b>,     <b>modifyKeyboard</b>,     <b>modifyKeypadKeys</b>,
                             <b>modifyModifierKeys</b>, <b>modifyOtherKeys</b>, and <b>modifySpecialKeys</b>.

                     •   Reset origin mode (DECOM).

                     •   Reset all margins (i.e., top/bottom and left/right).  This can be convenient when  some
                         program has left the scroll regions set incorrectly.

                     •   Set  autowrap  and  reverse  wrapping  according  to  the  resource values <b>autoWrap</b> and
                         <b>reverseWrap</b>.

                     •   Reset checksum extension to the <b>checksumExtension</b> resource.

              <b>Do</b> <b>Full</b> <b>Reset</b> (resource <b>hardreset</b>)
                     A full reset does this in addition to a soft reset:

                     •   Clear the window.

                     •   Reset tab stops to every eight columns.

                     •   Reset the screen to match the <b>reverseVideo</b> resource.

                     •   Resize the screen to 80 columns if 132-column mode was initially enabled with the  <b>c132</b>
                         resource.

                     •   Reset scrolling (jump versus smooth) per the <b>jumpScroll</b> resource.

                     •   Enable linefeed mode (ECMA-48 LNM) and send/receive mode (ECMA-48 SRM).

                     •   Reset DEC user-defined keys (DECUDK).

                     •   Disable application mode for cursor- and keypad-keys (DECCKM, DECKPAM).

                     •   Reset menu entry <u>8-bit</u> <u>Controls</u>, per resource <b>eightBitControl</b>.

                     •   Reset interpretation of the backarrow key, per initial resource settings.

                     •   Set  the  keyboard  type  according  to  the  resources  <b>keyboardType</b>,  <b>hpFunctionKeys</b>,
                         <b>scoFunctionKeys</b>, <b>sunFunctionKeys</b>, <b>tcapFunctionKeys</b>, <b>oldXtermFKeys</b> and <b>sunKeyboard</b>.

                     •   Turn mouse tracking off.

                     •   Reset title and pointer modes per resources <b>titleModes</b> and <b>pointerMode</b>.

                     •   Reset the readline and bracketed paste modes.

                     •   Discard all SIXEL and ReGIS graphics data from memory.

                     •   Reset <b>sixelScrolling</b> and <b>privateColorRegisters</b> from initial resource values.

                     •   Set DECSDM if the <b>sixelScrolling</b> resource is true.  Otherwise, reset DECSDM.

                     A full reset does this, unlike a soft reset:

                     •   Move the cursor to the upper-left corner of the window, and then save that position.

                     •   Hide the status-line, setting its display-type to “none”.

              <b>Reset</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clear</b> <b>Saved</b> <b>Lines</b> (resource <b>clearsavedlines</b>)
                     Perform a full reset, and also clear the saved lines.

                     This corresponds to the VT102 RIS control sequence, with a few  obvious  differences.   For
                     example, your session is not disconnected as a real VT102 would do.

       Commands for setting the current screen:

              <b>Show</b> <b>Tek</b> <b>Window</b> (resource <b>tekshow</b>)
                     When  enabled,  pops the Tektronix 4014 window up (makes it visible).  When disabled, hides
                     the Tektronix 4014 window.

              <b>Switch</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tek</b> <b>Mode</b> (resource <b>tekmode</b>)
                     When enabled, pops the Tektronix 4014 window up if it is not already visible, and  switches
                     the  input  stream  to  that  window.   When  disabled, hides the Tektronix 4014 window and
                     switches input back to the VT<u>xxx</u> window.

              <b>Hide</b> <b>VT</b> <b>Window</b> (resource <b>vthide</b>)
                     When enabled, hides the VT<u>xxx</u> window, shows the Tektronix 4014 window if it was not already
                     visible and switches the input stream to that  window.   When  disabled,  shows  the  VT<u>xxx</u>
                     window, and switches the input stream to that window.

              <b>Show</b> <b>Alternate</b> <b>Screen</b> (resource <b>altscreen</b>)
                     When  enabled,  shows  the alternate screen.  When disabled, shows the normal screen.  Note
                     that the normal screen may have saved lines; the alternate screen does not.

   <b>VT</b> <b>Fonts</b>
       The <u>xterm</u> <u>fontMenu</u> pops up when the “control” key and pointer button three are pressed in a  window.   It
       sets  the  font  used in the VT<u>xxx</u> window, or modifies the way the font is specified or displayed.  There
       are several sections.

       The first section allows you to select the font from a set of alternatives:

              <b>Default</b> (resource <b>fontdefault</b>)
                     Set the font to the default, i.e., that given by the <b>*VT100.font</b> resource.

              <b>Unreadable</b> (resource <b>font1</b>)
                     Set the font to that given by the <b>*VT100.font1</b> resource.

              <b>Tiny</b> (resource <b>font2</b>)
                     Set the font to that given by the <b>*VT100.font2</b> resource.

              <b>Small</b> (resource <b>font3</b>)
                     Set the font to that given by the <b>*VT100.font3</b> resource.

              <b>Medium</b> (resource <b>font4</b>)
                     Set the font to that given by the <b>*VT100.font4</b> resource.

              <b>Large</b> (resource <b>font5</b>)
                     Set the font to that given by the <b>*VT100.font5</b> resource.

              <b>Huge</b> (resource <b>font6</b>)
                     Set the font to that given by the <b>*VT100.font6</b> resource.

              <b>Enormous</b> (resource <b>font7</b>)
                     Set the font to that given by the <b>*VT100.font7</b> resource.

              <b>Escape</b> <b>Sequence</b> (resource <b>fontescape</b>)
                     This allows you to set the font last specified by the Set Font escape sequence  (see  <u>Xterm</u>
                     <u>Control</u> <u>Sequences</u>).

              <b>Selection</b> (resource <b>fontsel</b>)
                     This  allows  you  to  set  the font specified the current selection as a font name (if the
                     <b>PRIMARY</b> selection is owned).

       The second section allows you to modify the way it is displayed:

              <b>Bold</b> <b>Fonts</b> (resource <b>allow-bold-fonts</b>)
                     This is normally checked (enabled).  When unchecked, <u>xterm</u> will not use  bold  fonts.   The
                     setting corresponds to the <b>allowBoldFonts</b> resource.

              <b>Line-Drawing</b> <b>Characters</b> (resource <b>font-linedrawing</b>)
                     When  set, tells <u>xterm</u> to draw its own line-drawing characters.  Otherwise it relies on the
                     font containing these.  Compare to the <b>forceBoxChars</b> resource.

              <b>Packed</b> <b>Font</b> (resource <b>font-packed</b>)
                     When set, tells  <u>xterm</u>  to  use  the  minimum  glyph-width  from  a  font  when  displaying
                     characters.  Use the maximum width (unchecked) to help display proportional fonts.  Compare
                     to the <b>forcePackedFont</b> resource.

              <b>Doublesized</b> <b>Characters</b> (resource <b>font-doublesize</b>)
                     When  set, <u>xterm</u> may ask the font server to produce scaled versions of the normal font, for
                     VT102 double-size characters.

       The third section allows you to modify the way it is specified:

              <b>TrueType</b> <b>Fonts</b> (resource <b>render-font</b>)
                     If the <b>renderFont</b> and corresponding resources were set, this is a further  control  whether
                     <u>xterm</u> will actually use the Xft library calls to obtain a font.

              <b>UTF-8</b> <b>Encoding</b> (resource <b>utf8-mode</b>)
                     This  controls  whether  <u>xterm</u>  uses  UTF-8  encoding  of  input/output.   It is useful for
                     temporarily switching <u>xterm</u> to display text from an application which does not  follow  the
                     locale settings.  It corresponds to the <b>utf8</b> resource.

              <b>UTF-8</b> <b>Fonts</b> (resource <b>utf8-fonts</b>)
                     This  controls  whether  <u>xterm</u>  uses UTF-8 fonts for display.  It is useful for temporarily
                     switching <u>xterm</u> to display text from an  application  which  does  not  follow  the  locale
                     settings.  It combines the <b>utf8</b> and <b>utf8Fonts</b> resources, subject to the <b>locale</b> resource.

              <b>UTF-8</b> <b>Titles</b> (resource <b>utf8-title</b>)
                     This  controls  whether  <u>xterm</u>  accepts  UTF-8  encoding  for  title control sequences.  It
                     corresponds to the <b>utf8Fonts</b> resource.

                     Initially the checkmark is set according to both the <b>utf8</b> and  <b>utf8Fonts</b>  resource  values.
                     If  the  latter  is  set to “always”, the checkmark is disabled.  Likewise, if there are no
                     fonts given in the <b>utf8Fonts</b> subresources, then the checkmark also is disabled.

                     The standard <b>XTerm</b> app-defaults file defines both sets of  fonts,  while  the  <b>UXTerm</b>  app-
                     defaults file defines only one set.  Assuming the standard app-defaults files, this command
                     will launch <u>xterm</u> able to switch between UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 encoded fonts:

                         uxterm -class XTerm

       The  fourth section allows you to enable or disable special operations which can be controlled by writing
       escape sequences to the terminal.  These are disabled if the SendEvents feature is enabled:

              <b>Allow</b> <b>Color</b> <b>Ops</b> (resource <b>allow-color-ops</b>)
                     This corresponds to the <b>allowColorOps</b> resource.  Enable or disable control  sequences  that
                     set/query the colors.

              <b>Allow</b> <b>Font</b> <b>Ops</b> (resource <b>allow-font-ops</b>)
                     This  corresponds  to  the <b>allowFontOps</b> resource.  Enable or disable control sequences that
                     set/query the font.

              <b>Allow</b> <b>Mouse</b> <b>Ops</b> (resource <b>allow-mouse-ops</b>)
                     Enable or disable control sequences that cause the terminal to  send  escape  sequences  on
                     pointer-clicks and movement.  This corresponds to the <b>allowMouseOps</b> resource.

              <b>Allow</b> <b>Tcap</b> <b>Ops</b> (resource <b>allow-tcap-ops</b>)
                     Enable  or  disable  control sequences that query the terminal's notion of its function-key
                     strings, as termcap  or  terminfo  capabilities.   This  corresponds  to  the  <b>allowTcapOps</b>
                     resource.

              <b>Allow</b> <b>Title</b> <b>Ops</b> (resource <b>allow-title-ops</b>)
                     Enable  or  disable  control  sequences  that  modify  the window title or icon name.  This
                     corresponds to the <b>allowTitleOps</b> resource.

              <b>Allow</b> <b>Window</b> <b>Ops</b> (resource <b>allow-window-ops</b>)
                     Enable or disable extended window control sequences (as used in dtterm).  This  corresponds
                     to the <b>allowWindowOps</b> resource.

   <b>Tek</b> <b>Options</b>
       The  <u>xterm</u> <u>tekMenu</u> sets various modes in the Tektronix emulation, and is popped up when the “control” key
       and pointer button two are pressed in the Tektronix window.  The current font  size  is  checked  in  the
       modes section of the menu.

              <b>Large</b> <b>Characters</b> (resource <b>tektextlarge</b>)

              <b>#2</b> <b>Size</b> <b>Characters</b> (resource <b>tektext2</b>)

              <b>#3</b> <b>Size</b> <b>Characters</b> (resource <b>tektext3</b>)

              <b>Small</b> <b>Characters</b> (resource <b>tektextsmall</b>)

       Commands:

              <b>PAGE</b> (resource <b>tekpage</b>)
                     Simulates the Tektronix “PAGE” button by

                     •   clearing the window,

                     •   cancelling the graphics input-mode, and

                     •   moving the cursor to the <u>home</u> position.

              <b>RESET</b> (resource <b>tekreset</b>)
                     Unlike the similarly-named Tektronix “RESET” button, this does everything that <b>PAGE</b> does as
                     well as resetting the line-type and font-size to their default values.

              <b>COPY</b> (resource <b>tekcopy</b>)
                     Simulates  the  Tektronix  “COPY” button (which makes a hard-copy of the screen) by writing
                     the information to a text file.

       Windows:

              <b>Show</b> <b>VT</b> <b>Window</b> (resource <b>vtshow</b>)

              <b>Switch</b> <b>to</b> <b>VT</b> <b>Mode</b> (resource <b>vtmode</b>)

              <b>Hide</b> <b>Tek</b> <b>Window</b> (resource <b>tekhide</b>)

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       X environments differ in their security consciousness.

       •   Most servers, run under <u>xdm</u>, are capable of using a “magic  cookie”  authorization  scheme  that  can
           provide  a  reasonable  level of security for many people.  If your server is only using a host-based
           mechanism to control access to the server (see <b><a href="../man1/xhost.1.html">xhost</a>(1)</b>), then if you enable access for  a  host  and
           other  users are also permitted to run clients on that same host, it is possible that someone can run
           an application which uses the basic  services  of  the  X  protocol  to  snoop  on  your  activities,
           potentially capturing a transcript of everything you type at the keyboard.

       •   Any  process  which  has  access  to  your  X  display  can  manipulate it in ways that you might not
           anticipate, even redirecting your keyboard  to  itself  and  sending  events  to  your  application's
           windows.   This is true even with the “magic cookie” authorization scheme.  While the <b>allowSendEvents</b>
           provides some protection against rogue applications tampering with your programs, guarding against  a
           snooper is harder.

       •   The  X  input  extension  for  instance  allows  an  application to bypass all of the other (limited)
           authorization and security features, including the GrabKeyboard protocol.

       •   The possibility of an application spying on your keystrokes is of particular concern when you want to
           type in a password or other sensitive data.  The best solution to this problem is  to  use  a  better
           authorization mechanism than is provided by X.

       Subject to all of these caveats, a simple mechanism exists for protecting keyboard input in <u>xterm</u>.

       The <u>xterm</u> menu (see <b>MENUS</b> above) contains a <b>Secure</b> <b>Keyboard</b> entry which, when enabled, attempts to ensure
       that  all  keyboard  input  is directed <u>only</u> to <u>xterm</u> (using the GrabKeyboard protocol request).  When an
       application prompts you for a password (or other sensitive data), you can enable  <b>Secure</b>  <b>Keyboard</b>  using
       the menu, type in the data, and then disable <b>Secure</b> <b>Keyboard</b> using the menu again.

       •   This ensures that you know which window is accepting your keystrokes.

       •   It  cannot  ensure  that  there  are  no  processes which have access to your X display that might be
           observing the keystrokes as well.

       Only one X client at a time can grab the keyboard, so when you attempt to enable <b>Secure</b> <b>Keyboard</b>  it  may
       fail.  In this case, the bell will sound.  If the <b>Secure</b> <b>Keyboard</b> succeeds, the foreground and background
       colors will be exchanged (as if you selected the <b>Enable</b> <b>Reverse</b> <b>Video</b> entry in the <b>Modes</b> menu); they will
       be  exchanged  again  when  you  exit  secure mode.  If the colors do <u>not</u> switch, then you should be <u>very</u>
       suspicious that you are being spoofed.  If the application you  are  running  displays  a  prompt  before
       asking  for the password, it is safest to enter secure mode <u>before</u> the prompt gets displayed, and to make
       sure that the prompt gets displayed correctly (in  the  new  colors),  to  minimize  the  probability  of
       spoofing.   You  can  also  bring  up  the menu again and make sure that a check mark appears next to the
       entry.

       <b>Secure</b> <b>Keyboard</b> mode will be disabled automatically if your <u>xterm</u> window becomes iconified (or  otherwise
       unmapped),  or  if you start up a reparenting window manager (that places a title bar or other decoration
       around the window) while in <b>Secure</b> <b>Keyboard</b> mode.  (This is a  feature  of  the  X  protocol  not  easily
       overcome.)   When  this  happens, the foreground and background colors will be switched back and the bell
       will sound in warning.

</pre><h4><b>CHARACTER</b> <b>CLASSES</b></h4><pre>
       Clicking the left pointer button twice in rapid succession (double-clicking) causes all characters of the
       same class (e.g., letters, white space, punctuation) to be selected as a “word”.  Since different  people
       have  different  preferences  for what should be selected (for example, should filenames be selected as a
       whole or only the separate subnames), the default mapping can  be  overridden  through  the  use  of  the
       <b>charClass</b> (class <u>CharClass</u>) resource.

       This resource is a series of comma-separated <u>range</u>:<u>value</u> pairs.

       •   The <u>range</u> is either a single number or <u>low</u>-<u>high</u> in the range of 0 to 65535, corresponding to the code
           for the character or characters to be set.

       •   The  <u>value</u>  is  arbitrary.   For  example,  the  default table uses the character number of the first
           character occurring in the set.  When not in UTF-8 mode, only the first 256  entries  of  this  table
           will be used.

       The default table starts as follows -

           static int charClass[256] = {
           /* NUL  SOH  STX  ETX  EOT  ENQ  ACK  BEL */

              For  example, the string “33:48,37:48,45-47:48,38:48” indicates that the exclamation mark, percent
              sign, dash, period, slash, and ampersand characters should be treated the same way  as  characters
              and numbers.  This is useful for cutting and pasting electronic mailing addresses and filenames.

</pre><h4><b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       It  is  possible  to  rebind  keys (or sequences of keys) to arbitrary strings for input, by changing the
       <b>translations</b> resources for the vt100 or tek4014 widgets.  Changing the <b>translations</b> resource  for  events
       other than key and button events is not expected, and will cause unpredictable behavior.

   <b>Actions</b>
       The following actions are provided for use within the <u>vt100</u> or <u>tek4014</u> <b>translations</b> resources:

       <b>allow-bold-fonts(</b><u>on/off/toggle</u><b>)</b>
               This  action  sets,  unsets  or  toggles  the  <b>allowBoldFonts</b> resource and is also invoked by the
               <b>allow-bold-fonts</b> entry in <u>fontMenu</u>.

       <b>allow-color-ops(</b><u>on/off/toggle</u><b>)</b>
               This action sets, unsets or toggles the  <b>allowColorOps</b>  resource  and  is  also  invoked  by  the
               <b>allow-color-ops</b> entry in <u>fontMenu</u>.

       <b>allow-font-ops(</b><u>on/off/toggle</u><b>)</b>
               This  action  sets,  unsets  or  toggles  the  <b>allowFontOps</b>  resource  and is also invoked by the
               <b>allow-font-ops</b> entry in <u>fontMenu</u>.

       <b>allow-mouse-ops(</b><u>on/off/toggle</u><b>)</b>
               This action sets, unsets or toggles the  <b>allowMouseOps</b>  resource  and  is  also  invoked  by  the
               <b>allow-mouse-ops</b> entry in <u>fontMenu</u>.

       <b>allow-send-events(</b><u>on/off/toggle</u><b>)</b>
               This  action  sets,  unsets  or  toggles  the <b>allowSendEvents</b> resource and is also invoked by the
               <b>allowsends</b> entry in <u>mainMenu</u>.

       <b>allow-tcap-ops(</b><u>on/off/toggle</u><b>)</b>
               This action sets, unsets or toggles  the  <b>allowTcapOps</b>  resource  and  is  also  invoked  by  the
               <b>allow-tcap-ops</b> entry in <u>fontMenu</u>.

       <b>allow-title-ops(</b><u>on/off/toggle</u><b>)</b>
               This  action  sets,  unsets  or  toggles  the  <b>allowTitleOps</b>  resource and is also invoked by the
               <b>allow-title-ops</b> entry in <u>fontMenu</u>.

       <b>allow-window-ops(</b><u>on/off/toggle</u><b>)</b>
               This action sets, unsets or toggles the <b>allowWindowOps</b>  resource  and  is  also  invoked  by  the
               <b>allow-window-ops</b> entry in <u>fontMenu</u>.

       <b>alt-sends-escape()</b>
               This action toggles the state of the <b>altSendsEscape</b> resource.

       <b>bell([</b><u>percent</u><b>])</b>
               This action rings the keyboard bell at the specified percentage above or below the base volume.

       <b>clear-saved-lines()</b>
               This  action  does  <b>hard-reset()</b>  and  also  clears the history of lines saved off the top of the
               screen.  It is also invoked from the <b>clearsavedlines</b> entry in <u>vtMenu</u>.  The effect is identical to
               a hardware reset (RIS) control sequence.

       <b>copy-selection(</b><u>destname</u> <b>[,</b> <b>...])</b>
               This action puts the currently selected text into all of the selections or  cutbuffers  specified
               by  <u>destname</u>.   Unlike  <b>select-end</b>,  it  does  not  send a mouse position or otherwise modify the
               internal selection state.

       <b>create-menu(</b><u>m/v/f/t</u><b>)</b>
               This action creates one of the menus used by <u>xterm</u>, if it has not been previously  created.   The
               parameter values are the menu names: <u>mainMenu</u>, <u>vtMenu</u>, <u>fontMenu</u>, <u>tekMenu</u>, respectively.

       <b>dabbrev-expand()</b>
               Expands  the  word  before  cursor  by  searching  in the preceding text on the screen and in the
               scrollback buffer for words starting with that abbreviation.  Repeating <b>dabbrev-expand()</b>  several
               times  in  sequence  searches for an alternative expansion by looking farther back.  Lack of more
               matches is signaled by a bell.  Attempts to expand an empty word (i.e., when cursor  is  preceded
               by a space) yield successively all previous words.  Consecutive identical expansions are ignored.
               The  word  here  is  defined  as a sequence of non-whitespace characters.  This feature partially
               emulates the behavior of “dynamic abbreviation” expansion in Emacs (bound there to M-/).  Here is
               a resource setting for <u>xterm</u> which will do the same thing:

                   *VT100*translations:    #override \n\
                           Meta &lt;KeyPress&gt; /:<b>dabbrev-expand</b>()

       <b>deiconify()</b>
               Changes the window state back to normal, if it was iconified.

       <b>delete-is-del()</b>
               This action toggles the state of the <b>deleteIsDEL</b> resource.

       <b>dired-button()</b>
               Handles a button event (other than press and release) by  echoing  the  event's  position  (i.e.,
               character line and column) in the following format:

                   ^X ESC G &lt;line+“ ”&gt; &lt;col+“ ”&gt;

       <b>dump-html()</b>
               Invokes the <b>XHTML</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>Dump</b> feature.

       <b>dump-svg()</b>
               Invokes the <b>SVG</b> <b>Screen</b> <b>Dump</b> feature.

       <b>exec-formatted(</b><u>format</u><b>,</b> <u>sourcename</u> <b>[,</b> <b>...])</b>
               Execute  an  external  command, using the current selection for part of the command's parameters.
               The first parameter, <u>format</u> gives the basic command.  Succeeding parameters specify the selection
               source as in <b>insert-selection</b>.

               The <u>format</u> parameter allows these substitutions:

               %%   inserts a "%".

               %P   the screen-position at the beginning of the highlighted  region,  as  a  semicolon-separated
                    pair of integers using the values that the CUP control sequence would use.

               %p   the screen-position after the beginning of the highlighted region, using the same convention
                    as “%P”.

               %S   the length of the string that “%s” would insert.

               %s   the content of the selection, unmodified.

               %T   the length of the string that “%t” would insert.

               %t   the  selection,  trimmed of leading/trailing whitespace.  Embedded spaces (and newlines) are
                    copied as is.

               %R   the length of the string that “%r” would insert.

               %r   the selection, trimmed of trailing whitespace.

               %V   the video attributes at the beginning of the highlighted region,  as  a  semicolon-separated
                    list of integers using the values that the SGR control sequence would use.

               %v   the  video  attributes after the end of the highlighted region, using the same convention as
                    “%V”.

               After constructing the command-string, <u>xterm</u> forks a subprocess and executes the  command,  which
               completes independently of <u>xterm</u>.

               For  example,  this  translation  would  invoke  a new <u>xterm</u> process to view a file whose name is
               selected while holding the shift key down.  The new process is started when the mouse  button  is
               released:

                   *VT100*translations: #override Shift \
                       &lt;Btn1Up&gt;:<b>exec-formatted</b>("xterm -e view '%t'", <b>SELECT</b>)

       <b>exec-selectable(</b><u>format</u><b>,</b> <u>onClicks</u><b>)</b>
               Execute  an  external  command,  using  data  copied  from  the  screen for part of the command's
               parameters.  The first parameter, <u>format</u> gives the  basic  command  as  in  <b>exec-formatted</b>.   The
               second parameter specifies the method for copying the data as in the <b>on2Clicks</b> resource.

       <b>fullscreen(</b><u>on/off/toggle</u><b>)</b>
               This action sets, unsets or toggles the <b>fullscreen</b> resource.

       <b>hard-reset()</b>
               This  action  resets  the  scrolling  region,  tabs,  window size, and cursor keys and clears the
               screen.  It is also invoked from the <b>hardreset</b> entry in <u>vtMenu</u>.

       <b>iconify()</b>
               Iconifies the window.

       <b>ignore()</b>
               This action ignores the event but checks for special pointer position escape sequences.

       <b>insert()</b>
               This action inserts the character or string associated with the key that was pressed.

       <b>insert-eight-bit()</b>
               This action inserts an eight-bit (Meta) version of the character or string  associated  with  the
               key  that  was pressed.  Only single-byte values are treated specially.  The exact action depends
               on the value of the <b>altSendsEscape</b> and the <b>metaSendsEscape</b> and the <b>eightBitInput</b> resources.   The
               <b>metaSendsEscape</b> resource is tested first.  See the <b>eightBitInput</b> resource for a full discussion.

               The  term  “eight-bit”  is  misleading:  <u>xterm</u>  checks if the key is in the range 128 to 255 (the
               eighth bit is set).  If the value is in that range, depending on the resource values,  <u>xterm</u>  may
               then do one of the following:

               •   add 128 to the value, setting its eighth bit,

               •   send an ESC byte before the key, or

               •   send the key unaltered.

       <b>insert-formatted(</b><u>format</u><b>,</b> <u>sourcename</u> <b>[,</b> <b>...])</b>
               Insert the current selection or data related to it, formatted.  The first parameter, <u>format</u> gives
               the  template  for  the  data  as in <b>exec-formatted</b>.  Succeeding parameters specify the selection
               source as in <b>insert-selection</b>.

       <b>insert-selectable(</b><u>format</u><b>,</b> <u>onClicks</u><b>)</b>
               Insert data copied from the screen, formatted.  The first parameter, <u>format</u>  gives  the  template
               for  the  data  as  in <b>exec-formatted</b>.  The second parameter specifies the method for copying the
               data as in the <b>on2Clicks</b> resource.

       <b>insert-selection(</b><u>sourcename</u> <b>[,</b> <b>...])</b>
               This action inserts the string found in the  selection  or  cutbuffer  indicated  by  <u>sourcename</u>.
               Sources  are  checked in the order given (case is significant) until one is found.  Commonly-used
               selections  include:  <b>PRIMARY</b>,  <b>SECONDARY</b>,  and  <b>CLIPBOARD</b>.   Cut  buffers  are  typically  named
               <b>CUT_BUFFER0</b> through <b>CUT_BUFFER7</b>.

       <b>insert-seven-bit()</b>
               This  action is a synonym for <b>insert()</b>.  The term “seven-bit” is misleading: it only implies that
               <u>xterm</u> does not try to add 128 to the key's value as in <b>insert-eight-bit()</b>.

       <b>interpret(</b><u>control-sequence</u><b>)</b>
               Interpret the given control sequence locally, i.e., without passing it to the host.   This  works
               by  inserting  the  control  sequence  at the front of the input buffer.  Use “\” to escape octal
               digits in the string.  Xt does not allow you to put  a  null  character  (i.e.,  “\000”)  in  the
               string.

       <b>keymap(</b><u>name</u><b>)</b>
               This  action  dynamically  defines  a  new translation table whose resource name is <u>name</u> with the
               suffix “<u>Keymap</u>” (i.e., <u>name</u><b>Keymap</b>, where case  is  significant).   The  name  <u>None</u>  restores  the
               original translation table.

       <b>larger-vt-font()</b>
               Set the font to the next larger one, based on the font dimensions.  See also <b>set-vt-font()</b>.

       <b>load-vt-fonts(</b><u>name</u><b>[,</b><u>class</u><b>])</b>
               Load  fontnames from the given subresource name and class.  That is, load the “*VT100.<u>name</u>.font”,
               resource as “*VT100.font” etc.  If no name is given, the original set of fontnames is restored.

               Unlike <b>set-vt-font()</b>, this does not affect the escape- and  select-fonts,  since  those  are  not
               based  on  resource  values.  It does affect the fonts loosely organized under the “Default” menu
               entry, including <b>font</b>, <b>boldFont</b>, <b>wideFont</b> and <b>wideBoldFont</b>.

       <b>maximize()</b>
               Resizes the window to fill the screen.

       <b>meta-sends-escape()</b>
               This action toggles the state of the <b>metaSendsEscape</b> resource.

       <b>pointer-button()</b>
               Use this action as a fall-back to handle button press- and release-events for the  mouse  control
               sequence protocol when the selection-related translations are suppressed with the <b>omitTranslation</b>
               resource.

       <b>pointer-motion()</b>
               Use  this  action  as a fall-back to handle motion-events for the mouse control sequence protocol
               when the selection-related translations are suppressed with the <b>omitTranslation</b> resource.

       <b>popup-menu(</b><u>menuname</u><b>)</b>
               This action displays the specified popup  menu.   Valid  names  (case  is  significant)  include:
               <u>mainMenu</u>, <u>vtMenu</u>, <u>fontMenu</u>, and <u>tekMenu</u>.

       <b>print(</b><u>printer-flags</u><b>)</b>
               This action prints the window.  It is also invoked by the <b>print</b> entry in <u>mainMenu</u>.

               The  action  accepts  optional  parameters,  which  temporarily  override resource settings.  The
               parameter values are matched ignoring case:

               noFormFeed
                    no form feed will be sent at the end of the last  line  printed  (i.e.,  <b>printerFormFeed</b>  is
                    “false”).

               FormFeed
                    a  form  feed  will  be  sent  at the end of the last line printed (i.e., <b>printerFormFeed</b> is
                    “true”).

               noNewLine
                    no newline will be sent at the end of the last line  printed,  and  wrapped  lines  will  be
                    combined into long lines (i.e., <b>printerNewLine</b> is “false”).

               NewLine
                    a  newline  will  be sent at the end of the last line printed, and each line will be limited
                    (by adding a newline) to the screen width (i.e., <b>printerNewLine</b> is “true”).

               noAttrs
                    the page is printed without attributes (i.e., <b>printAttributes</b> is “0”).

               monoAttrs
                    the page is printed with monochrome (vt220) attributes (i.e., <b>printAttributes</b> is “1”).

               colorAttrs
                    the page is printed with ANSI color attributes (i.e., <b>printAttributes</b> is “2”).

       <b>print-everything(</b><u>printer-flags</u><b>)</b>
               This action sends the entire text history, in addition to the  text  currently  visible,  to  the
               program  given  in  the  <b>printerCommand</b>  resource.  It allows the same optional parameters as the
               <b>print</b> action.  With a suitable printer command, the action can be used to load the  text  history
               in an editor.

       <b>print-immediate()</b>
               Sends  the text of the current window directly to a file, as specified by the <b>printFileImmediate</b>,
               <b>printModeImmediate</b> and <b>printOptsImmediate</b> resources.

       <b>print-on-error()</b>
               Toggles a flag telling <u>xterm</u> that if it exits with an X error, to send the text  of  the  current
               window  directly  to  a  file,  as  specified  by  the  <b>printFileOnXError</b>,  <b>printModeOnXError</b> and
               <b>printOptsOnXError</b> resources.

       <b>print-redir()</b>
               This action toggles the <b>printerControlMode</b> between 0 and 2.  The corresponding popup  menu  entry
               is useful for switching the printer off if you happen to change your mind after deciding to print
               random binary files on the terminal.

       <b>quit()</b>
               This  action sends a SIGHUP to the subprogram and exits.  It is also invoked by the <b>quit</b> entry in
               <u>mainMenu</u>.

       <b>readline-button()</b>
               Supports the optional readline feature by echoing repeated cursor  forward  or  backward  control
               sequences  on button release event, to request that the host application update its notion of the
               cursor's position to match the button event.

       <b>redraw()</b>
               This action redraws the window.  It is also invoked by the <b>redraw</b> entry in <u>mainMenu</u>.

       <b>restore()</b>
               Restores the window to the size before it was last maximized.

       <b>scroll-back(</b><u>count</u> <b>[,</b><u>units</u> <b>[,</b><u>mouse</u><b>]</b> <b>])</b>
               This action scrolls the text window backward so that text that had previously  scrolled  off  the
               top of the screen is now visible.

               The <u>count</u> argument indicates the number of <u>units</u> (which may be <u>page</u>, <u>halfpage</u>, <u>pixel</u>, or <u>line</u>) by
               which  to  scroll.   If  no <u>count</u> parameter is given, <u>xterm</u> uses the number of lines given by the
               <b>scrollLines</b> resource.

               An adjustment can be specified for the <u>page</u> or <u>halfpage</u> units by appending  a  “+”  or  “-”  sign
               followed by a number, e.g., <u>page-2</u> to specify 2 lines less than a page.

               If the second parameter is omitted “lines” is used.

               If the third parameter <u>mouse</u> is given, the action is ignored when mouse reporting is enabled.

       <b>scroll-forw(</b><u>count</u> <b>[,</b><u>units</u> <b>[,</b><u>mouse</u><b>]</b> <b>])</b>
               This action is similar to <b>scroll-back</b> except that it scrolls in the other direction.

       <b>scroll-lock(</b><u>on/off/toggle</u><b>)</b>
               This  action  sets,  unsets  or  toggles  internal state which tells <u>xterm</u> whether Scroll Lock is
               active, subject to the <b>allowScrollLock</b> resource.

       <b>scroll-to(</b><u>count</u><b>)</b>
               Scroll to  the  given  line  relative  to  the  beginning  of  the  saved-lines.   For  instance,
               “<b><a href="../man0/scroll-to.0.html">scroll-to</a>(0)</b>” would scroll to the beginning.  Two special nonnumeric parameters are recognized:

               <b>scroll-to(begin)</b>
                       Scroll to the beginning of the saved lines.

               <b>scroll-to(end)</b>
                       Scroll to the end of the saved lines, i.e., to the currently active page.

       <b>secure()</b>
               This  action  toggles  the <u>Secure</u> <u>Keyboard</u> mode (see <b>SECURITY</b>), and is invoked from the <b>securekbd</b>
               entry in <u>mainMenu</u>.

       <b>select-cursor-end(</b><u>destname</u> <b>[,</b> <b>...])</b>
               This action is similar to <b>select-end</b> except that it should be used with <b>select-cursor-start</b>.

       <b>select-cursor-extend()</b>
               This action is similar to <b>select-extend</b> except that it should be used with <b>select-cursor-start</b>.

       <b>select-cursor-start()</b>
               This action is similar to <b>select-start</b> except that it begins the selection at  the  current  text
               cursor position.

       <b>select-end(</b><u>destname</u> <b>[,</b> <b>...])</b>
               This  action  puts the currently selected text into all of the selections or cutbuffers specified
               by <u>destname</u>.  It also sends a mouse position and updates the internal selection state to  reflect
               the end of the selection process.

       <b>select-extend()</b>
               This  action  tracks  the  pointer  and extends the selection.  It should only be bound to Motion
               events.

       <b>select-set()</b>
               This action stores text  that  corresponds  to  the  current  selection,  without  affecting  the
               selection mode.

       <b>select-start()</b>
               This  action  begins  text selection at the current pointer location.  See the section on <b>POINTER</b>
               <b>USAGE</b> for information on making selections.

               If <u>xterm</u> is configured to support block-selection, this action accepts a parameter “block”  which
               initiates a block-selection rather than the default character-oriented selection.

       <b>send-signal(</b><u>signame</u><b>)</b>
               This  action  sends  the  signal  named  by <u>signame</u> to the <u>xterm</u> subprocess (the shell or program
               specified with the <u>-e</u> command line option).   It  is  also  invoked  by  the  <b>suspend</b>,  <b>continue</b>,
               <b>interrupt</b>,  <b>hangup</b>, <b>terminate</b>, and <b>kill</b> entries in <u>mainMenu</u>.  Allowable signal names are (case is
               not significant): <u>tstp</u> (if supported by the operating system), <u>suspend</u> (same as <u>tstp</u>),  <u>cont</u>  (if
               supported by the operating system), <u>int</u>, <u>hup</u>, <u>term</u>, <u>quit</u>, <u>alrm</u>, <u>alarm</u> (same as <u>alrm</u>) and <u>kill</u>.

       <b>set-8-bit-control(</b><u>on/off/toggle</u><b>)</b>
               This  action  sets,  unsets or toggles the <b>eightBitControl</b> resource.  It is also invoked from the
               <b>8-bit-control</b> entry in <u>vtMenu</u>.

       <b>set-allow132(</b><u>on/off/toggle</u><b>)</b>
               This action sets, unsets or toggles the <b>c132</b> resource.  It is  also  invoked  from  the  <b>allow132</b>
               entry in <u>vtMenu</u>.

       <b>set-altscreen(</b><u>on/off/toggle</u><b>)</b>
               This action sets, unsets or toggles between the alternate and current screens.

               <u>1</u> through <u>7</u> indicate the fonts specified by the <b>font1</b> through <b>font7</b> resources,

               <u>e</u> or <u>E</u> indicate the normal and bold fonts that have been set through escape codes  (or  specified
                      as the second and third action arguments, respectively), and

               <u>s</u>  or  <u>S</u>  indicate  the font selection (as made by programs such as <b><a href="../man1/xfontsel.1.html">xfontsel</a>(1)</b>) indicated by the
                      second action argument.

               If <u>xterm</u> is configured to support wide characters, an  additional  two  optional  parameters  are
               recognized for the <u>e</u> argument: wide font and wide bold font.

       <b>smaller-vt-font()</b>

               process filesystem, e.g., “<a href="file:/proc">/proc</a>”, which <u>xterm</u> can read.

               Use the “cwd” process entry, e.g., /proc/12345/cwd to obtain the working directory of the process
               which is running in the current <u>xterm</u>.

               On  systems  which  have  the  “exe” process entry, e.g., /proc/12345/exe, use this to obtain the
               actual executable.  Otherwise, use the <b>$PATH</b> variable to find <u>xterm</u>.

               If parameters are given in the action, pass them to the new <u>xterm</u> process.

       <b>start-cursor-extend()</b>
               This action is similar to <b>select-extend</b> except that the selection is extended to the current text
               cursor position.

       <b>start-extend()</b>
               This action is similar to <b>select-start</b> except that the  selection  is  extended  to  the  current
               pointer location.

       <b>string(</b><u>string</u><b>)</b>
               This action inserts the specified text string as if it had been typed.  Quotation is necessary if
               the  string  contains  whitespace  or non-alphanumeric characters.  If the string argument begins
               with the characters “0x”, it is interpreted as a hex character constant.

       <b>tek-copy()</b>
               This action copies the escape codes used to generate the current window contents to a file in the
               current directory beginning with the name COPY.  It is also invoked from  the  <b>tekcopy</b>  entry  in
               <u>tekMenu</u>.

               This action resets the Tektronix window.  It is also invoked by the <b>tekreset</b> entry in <u>tekMenu</u>.

       <b>vi-button()</b>
               Handles a button event (other than press and release) by echoing a control sequence computed from
               the event's line number in the screen relative to the current line:

                   ESC ^P

               or

                   ESC ^N

               according  to  whether  the event is before, or after the current line, respectively.  The ^N (or
               ^P) is repeated once for each line that the event differs from the  current  line.   The  control
               sequence is omitted altogether if the button event is on the current line.

       <b>visual-bell()</b>
               This action flashes the window quickly.

       The Tektronix window also has the following action:

       <b>gin-press(</b><u>l/L/m/M/r/R</u><b>)</b>
               This action sends the indicated graphics input code.

   <b>Default</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Bindings</b>

             Lock @Num_Lock Ctrl &lt;Btn5Down&gt;:<b>scroll-forw</b>(1,halfpage,m) \n\
                  @Num_Lock Ctrl &lt;Btn5Down&gt;:<b>scroll-forw</b>(1,halfpage,m) \n\
                                 &lt;Btn5Down&gt;:<b>scroll-forw</b>(5,line,m)     \n\
                                    &lt;BtnUp&gt;:<b>select-end</b>(<b>SELECT</b>, <b>CUT_BUFFER0</b>) \n\
                                &lt;BtnMotion&gt;:<b>pointer-motion</b>() \n\
                                  &lt;BtnDown&gt;:<b>pointer-button</b>() \n\
                                    &lt;BtnUp&gt;:<b>pointer-button</b>() \n\
                                  &lt;BtnDown&gt;:<b>ignore</b>()

       The default bindings in the Tektronix window are analogous but less extensive.  These are for the <u>tek4014</u>
       widget:

                            ~Meta&lt;KeyPress&gt;: <b>insert-seven-bit</b>() \n\
                             Meta&lt;KeyPress&gt;: <b>insert-eight-bit</b>() \n\
                           !Ctrl &lt;Btn1Down&gt;: <b><a href="../manmainMenu/popup-menu.mainMenu.html">popup-menu</a></b>(mainMenu) \n\
                      !Lock Ctrl &lt;Btn1Down&gt;: <b><a href="../manmainMenu/popup-menu.mainMenu.html">popup-menu</a></b>(mainMenu) \n\
            !Lock Ctrl @Num_Lock &lt;Btn1Down&gt;: <b><a href="../manmainMenu/popup-menu.mainMenu.html">popup-menu</a></b>(mainMenu) \n\
                 !Ctrl @Num_Lock &lt;Btn1Down&gt;: <b><a href="../manmainMenu/popup-menu.mainMenu.html">popup-menu</a></b>(mainMenu) \n\
                           !Ctrl &lt;Btn2Down&gt;: <b>popup-menu</b>(tekMenu) \n\
                      !Lock Ctrl &lt;Btn2Down&gt;: <b>popup-menu</b>(tekMenu) \n\
            !Lock Ctrl @Num_Lock &lt;Btn2Down&gt;: <b>popup-menu</b>(tekMenu) \n\
                 !Ctrl @Num_Lock &lt;Btn2Down&gt;: <b>popup-menu</b>(tekMenu) \n\
                      Shift ~Meta&lt;Btn1Down&gt;: <b>gin-press</b>(L) \n\
                            ~Meta&lt;Btn1Down&gt;: <b>gin-press</b>(l) \n\
                      Shift ~Meta&lt;Btn2Down&gt;: <b>gin-press</b>(M) \n\
                            ~Meta&lt;Btn2Down&gt;: <b><a href="../manm/gin-press.m.html">gin-press</a></b>(m) \n\
                      Shift ~Meta&lt;Btn3Down&gt;: <b>gin-press</b>(R) \n\
                            ~Meta&lt;Btn3Down&gt;: <b>gin-press</b>(r)

   <b>Custom</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Bindings</b>
       You can modify the <b>translations</b> resource by overriding parts of it, or merging your resources with it.

       Here is an example which uses shifted select/paste to copy to the clipboard, and  unshifted  select/paste
       for  the  primary  selection.   In  each case, a (different) cut buffer is also a target or source of the
       select/paste operation.  It is important to remember however, that cut buffers store data  in  ISO-8859-1
       encoding,  while  selections  can store data in a variety of formats and encodings.  While <u>xterm</u> owns the
       selection, it highlights it.  When it loses the selection, it removes the corresponding  highlight.   But
       you can still paste from the corresponding cut buffer.

           *VT100*translations:    #override \n\
              ~Shift~Ctrl&lt;Btn2Up&gt;: <b>insert-selection</b>(<b>PRIMARY</b>, <b>CUT_BUFFER0</b>) \n\
               Shift~Ctrl&lt;Btn2Up&gt;: <b>insert-selection</b>(<b>CLIPBOARD</b>, <b>CUT_BUFFER1</b>) \n\
              ~Shift     &lt;BtnUp&gt; : <b>select-end</b>(<b>PRIMARY</b>, <b>CUT_BUFFER0</b>) \n\
               Shift     &lt;BtnUp&gt; : <b>select-end</b>(<b>CLIPBOARD</b>, <b>CUT_BUFFER1</b>)

       In  the  example, the class name <b>VT100</b> is used rather than the widget name.  These are different; a class
       name could apply to more than one widget.  A leading “*” is used because the widget hierarchy  above  the
       <u>vt100</u> widget depends on whether the toolbar support is compiled into <u>xterm</u>.

       Most  of  the  predefined  translations are related to the mouse, with a few that use some of the special
       keys on the keyboard.  Applications use  special  keys  (function-keys,  cursor-keys,  keypad-keys)  with
       modifiers  (shift,  control, alt).  If <u>xterm</u> defines a translation for a given combination of special key
       and modifier, that makes it unavailable for use by applications within the terminal.  For  instance,  one
       might extend the use of <u>Page</u> <u>Up</u> and <u>Page</u> <u>Down</u> keys seen here:

               Shift &lt;KeyPress&gt; Prior : <b>scroll-back</b>(1,halfpage) \n\
               Shift &lt;KeyPress&gt; Next  : <b>scroll-forw</b>(1,halfpage) \n\

       to the <u>Home</u> and <u>End</u> keys:

               Shift &lt;KeyPress&gt; Home : <b>scroll-to</b>(begin) \n\
               Shift &lt;KeyPress&gt; End  : <b>scroll-to</b>(end)

       but then shift-<u>Home</u> and shift-<u>End</u> would then be unavailable to applications.

       Not  everyone  finds  the  three-button  mouse bindings easy to use.  In a wheel mouse, the middle button
       might be the wheel.  As an alternative, you could add a binding using shifted keys:

           *VT100*translations:      #override \n\
               Shift &lt;Key&gt;Home:    <b>copy-selection</b>(<b>SELECT</b>) \n\
               Shift &lt;Key&gt;Insert:  <b>copy-selection</b>(<b>SELECT</b>) \n\
               Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;C:  <b>copy-selection</b>(<b>SELECT</b>) \n\
               Ctrl Shift &lt;Key&gt;V:  <b>insert-selection</b>(<b>SELECT</b>)

       You would still use the left- and right-mouse buttons (typically 1 and 3)  for  beginning  and  extending
       selections.

       Besides  mouse problems, there are also keyboards with inconvenient layouts.  Some lack a numeric keypad,
       making it hard to use the shifted keypad plus and minus bindings for switching between font  sizes.   You
       can work around that by assigning the actions to more readily accessed keys:

           *VT100*translations:      #override \n\
               Ctrl &lt;Key&gt; +:       <b>larger-vt-font</b>() \n\
               Ctrl &lt;Key&gt; -:       <b>smaller-vt-font</b>()

       The  keymap  feature  allows  you to switch between sets of translations.  The sample below shows how the
       <b>keymap()</b> action may be used to add special keys for entering commonly-typed words:

           *VT100.Translations: #override &lt;Key&gt;F13: keymap(dbx)
           *VT100.dbxKeymap.translations: \
                   &lt;Key&gt;F14:       <b>keymap</b>(None) \n\
                   &lt;Key&gt;F17:       <b>string</b>("next") \n\
                                   <b><a href="../man0x0d/string.0x0d.html">string</a></b>(0x0d) \n\
                   &lt;Key&gt;F18:       <b>string</b>("step") \n\
                                   <b><a href="../man0x0d/string.0x0d.html">string</a></b>(0x0d) \n\
                   &lt;Key&gt;F19:       <b>string</b>("continue") \n\
                                   <b><a href="../man0x0d/string.0x0d.html">string</a></b>(0x0d) \n\
                   &lt;Key&gt;F20:       <b>string</b>("print ") \n\
                                   <b>insert-selection</b>(<b>PRIMARY</b>, <b>CUT_BUFFER0</b>)

   <b>Default</b> <b>Scrollbar</b> <b>Bindings</b>
       Key bindings are normally associated with the <u>vt100</u> or <u>tek4014</u> widgets which act as  terminal  emulators.
       <u>Xterm</u>'s scrollbar (and toolbar if it is configured) are separate widgets.  Because all of these use the <u>X</u>
       <u>Toolkit</u>,  they  have  corresponding  <b>translations</b>  resources.   Those  resources  are distinct, and match
       different patterns, e.g., the differences in widget-name and number of levels of widgets which  they  may
       contain.

       The  <u>scrollbar</u>  widget  is  a  child  of  the <u>vt100</u> widget.  It is positioned on top of the <u>vt100</u> widget.
       Toggling the scrollbar on and off causes the <u>vt100</u> widget to resize.

       The default bindings for the scrollbar widget use only mouse-button events:

              &lt;Btn5Down&gt;: StartScroll(Forward) \n\
              &lt;Btn1Down&gt;: StartScroll(Forward) \n\
              &lt;Btn2Down&gt;: StartScroll(Continuous) MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\
              &lt;Btn3Down&gt;: StartScroll(Backward) \n\
              &lt;Btn4Down&gt;: StartScroll(Backward) \n\
              &lt;Btn2Motion&gt;: MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\
              &lt;BtnUp&gt;:    NotifyScroll(Proportional) EndScroll()

       Events which the <u>scrollbar</u> widget does not recognize at all are lost.

       However, at startup, <u>xterm</u> augments these translations with the default translations used for  the  <u>vt100</u>
       widget,  together  with  the  resource “actions” which those translations use.  Because the <u>scrollbar</u> (or
       <u>menubar</u>) widgets do not recognize these actions (but because it has a  corresponding  translation),  they
       are passed on to the <u>vt100</u> widget.

       This augmenting of the scrollbar's translations has a few limitations:

       •   <u>Xterm</u>  knows  what  the  default  translations  are,  but  there is no suitable library interface for
           determining what customizations a user may have added to the <u>vt100</u> widget.  All that <u>xterm</u> can do  is
           augment  the  <u>scrollbar</u>  widget  to  give it the same starting point for further customization by the
           user.

       •   Events in the gap between the widgets may be lost.

       •   Compose sequences begun in one widget cannot be completed in the other, because the input methods for
           each widget do not share context information.

       Most customizations of the scrollbar translations  do  not  concern  key  bindings.   Rather,  users  are
       generally more interested in changing the bindings of the mouse buttons.  For example, some people prefer
       using  the  left  pointer  button  for  dragging the scrollbar thumb.  That can be set up by altering the
       translations resource, e.g.,

           *VT100.scrollbar.translations:  #override \n\
              &lt;Btn5Down&gt;:     StartScroll(Forward) \n\
              &lt;Btn1Down&gt;:     StartScroll(Continuous) MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\
              &lt;Btn4Down&gt;:     StartScroll(Backward) \n\
              &lt;Btn1Motion&gt;:   MoveThumb() NotifyThumb() \n\
              &lt;BtnUp&gt;:        NotifyScroll(Proportional) EndScroll()

</pre><h4><b>CONTROL</b> <b>SEQUENCES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>KEYBOARD</b></h4><pre>
       Applications can send sequences of characters to the terminal to change its  behavior.   Often  they  are
       referred to as “ANSI escape sequences” or just plain “escape sequences” but both terms are misleading:

       •   ANSI  x3.64  (obsolete)  which  was replaced by ISO 6429 (ECMA-48) gave rules for the <u>format</u> of these
           sequences of characters.

       •   While the original VT100 was claimed to be  ANSI-compatible  (against  x3.64),  there  is  no  freely
           available  version of the ANSI standard to show where the VT100 differs.  Most of the documents which
           mention the ANSI standard have additions not found in the original (such as those based on <b>ansi.sys</b>).
           So this discussion focuses on the ISO standards.

       •   The standard describes only sequences sent from the host to the terminal.  There is no  standard  for
           sequences  sent  by  special  keys  from  the  terminal to the host.  By convention (and referring to
           existing terminals), the format of those sequences usually conforms to the host-to-terminal standard.

       •   Some of <u>xterm</u>'s sequences do not fit into the standard scheme.  Technically those are  “unspecified”.
           As an example, DEC Screen Alignment Test (DECALN) is this three-character sequence:

               <u>ESC</u> # 8

       •   Some  sequences  fit into the standard format, but are not listed in the standard.  These include the
           sequences used for setting up scrolling margins and doing forward/reverse scrolling.

       •   Some of the sequences (in particular, the single-character functions such as tab  and  backspace)  do
           not include the <u>escape</u> character.

       With all of that in mind, the standard refers to these sequences of characters as “control sequences”.

       <u>Xterm</u>  <u>Control</u>  <u>Sequences</u>  lists  the  control  sequences  which an application can send <u>xterm</u> to make it
       perform various operations.  Most of these operations are standardized, from either the DEC or  Tektronix
       terminals, or from more widely used standards such as ISO-6429.

       A few examples of usage are given in this section.

   <b>Window</b> <b>and</b> <b>Icon</b> <b>Titles</b>
       Some scripts use <b>echo</b> with options <b>-e</b> and <b>-n</b> to tell the shell to interpret the string “\e” as the <u>escape</u>
       character  and  to  suppress  a  trailing  newline  on  output.  Those are not portable, nor recommended.
       Instead, use <b><a href="../man1/printf.1.html">printf</a></b>(1) (POSIX).

       For example, to set the <u>window</u> <u>title</u> to “Hello world!”, you could use one of these commands in a script:

           printf '\033]2;Hello world!\033\\'
           printf '\033]2;Hello world!\007'
           printf '\033]2;%s\033\\' "Hello world!"
           printf '\033]2;%s\007' "Hello world!"

       The <b><a href="../man1/printf.1.html">printf</a></b>(1) command interprets the octal value “\033” for <u>escape</u>, and (since it was not  given  in  the
       format) omits a trailing newline from the output.

       Some  programs  (such  as  <b><a href="../man1/screen.1.html">screen</a></b>(1)) set both window- and icon-titles at the same time, using a slightly
       different control sequence:

           printf '\033]0;Hello world!\033\\'
           printf '\033]0;Hello world!\007'
           printf '\033]0;%s\033\\' "Hello world!"
           printf '\033]0;%s\007' "Hello world!"

       The difference is the <u>parameter</u> “0” in each command.  Most window managers will honor either window title
       or icon title.  Some will make a distinction and allow you to set just the  icon  title.   You  can  tell
       <u>xterm</u> to ask for this with a different parameter in the control sequence:

           printf '\033]1;Hello world!\033\\'
           printf '\033]1;Hello world!\007'
           printf '\033]1;%s\033\\' "Hello world!"
           printf '\033]1;%s\007' "Hello world!"

   <b>Special</b> <b>Keys</b>
       <u>Xterm</u>,  like  any  VT100-compatible  terminal  emulator, has two modes for the <u>special</u> <u>keys</u> (cursor-keys,
       numeric keypad, and certain function-keys):

       •   <u>normal</u> <u>mode</u>, which makes the special keys transmit “useful” sequences such as  the  control  sequence
           for cursor-up when pressing the up-arrow, and

       •   <u>application</u>  <u>mode</u>,  which  uses a different control sequence that cannot be mistaken for the “useful”
           sequences.

       The main difference between the two modes is that normal mode sequences start  with  <u>CSI</u>  (<u>escape</u> <u>[</u>)  and
       application mode sequences start with <u>SS3</u> (<u>escape</u> <u>O</u>).

       The  terminal is initialized into one of these two modes (usually the normal mode), based on the terminal
       description (termcap or terminfo).  The terminal description also has capabilities (strings) defined  for
       the keypad mode used in curses applications.

       There  is  a problem in using the terminal description for applications that are not intended to be full-
       screen curses applications: the definitions of special keys are only correct for this keypad  mode.   For
       example,  some shells (unlike <b><a href="../man1/ksh.1.html">ksh</a></b>(1), which appears to be hard-coded, not even using termcap) allow their
       users to customize key-bindings, assigning shell actions to special keys.

       •   <b><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a></b>(1) allows <u>constant</u> strings to be assigned to functions.  This is only successful if the terminal
           is initialized to application mode by default, because <b>bash</b> lacks flexibility in this area.  It  uses
           a (less expressive than <b>bash</b>'s) <b>readline</b> scripting language for setting up key bindings, which relies
           upon the user to statically enumerate the possible bindings for given values of <b>$TERM</b>.

       •   <b><a href="../man1/zsh.1.html">zsh</a></b>(1)  provides  an  analogous  feature,  but it accepts runtime expressions, as well as providing a
           <b>$terminfo</b> array for scripts.  In particular, one can use the  terminal  database,  transforming  when
           defining  a key-binding.  By transforming the output so that <u>CSI</u> and <u>SS3</u> are equated, <b>zsh</b> can use the
           terminal database to obtain useful definitions for its command-line use  regardless  of  whether  the
           terminal uses normal or application mode initially.  Here is an example:

               [[ "$terminfo[kcuu1]" == "^[O"* ]] &amp;&amp; \
               bindkey -M viins "${terminfo[kcuu1]/O/[}" \
               vi-up-line-or-history

   <b>Changing</b> <b>Colors</b>
       A  few  shell programs provide the ability for users to add color and other video attributes to the shell
       prompt strings.  Users can do this by setting <b>$PS1</b> (the primary prompt string).  Again, <b>bash</b> and <b>zsh</b> have
       provided features not found in <b>ksh</b>.  There is a problem, however: the prompt's width on the  screen  will
       not  necessarily  be  the  same  as  the number of characters.  Because there is no guidance in the POSIX
       standard, each shell addresses the problem in a different way:

       •   <b>bash</b> treats characters within “\[” and “\]” as nonprinting (using no width on the screen).

       •   <b>zsh</b> treats characters within “%{” and “%}” as nonprinting.

       In addition to the difference in syntax, the shells provide different methods for obtaining useful escape
       sequences:

       •   As noted in <b>Special</b> <b>Keys</b>, <b>zsh</b> initializes the $terminfo array with the terminal capabilities.

           It also provides a function <b>echoti</b> which works like <b><a href="../man1/tput.1.html">tput</a></b>(1) to convert a terminal capability with its
           parameters into a string that can be written to the terminal.

       •   Shells lacking a comparable feature (such as <b>bash</b>) can always use the  program  <b><a href="../man1/tput.1.html">tput</a></b>(1)  to  do  this
           transformation.

       Hard-coded  escape sequences are supported by each shell, but are not recommended because those rely upon
       particular configurations and cannot be easily moved between different user environments.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xterm</u> sets several environment variables.

   <b>System</b> <b>Independent</b>
       Some variables are used on every system:

       <b>DISPLAY</b>
            is the display name, pointing to the X server (see <u>DISPLAY</u> <u>NAMES</u> in <a href="../man7/X.7.html">X</a>(7)).

       <b>TERM</b>
            is set according to the terminfo (or termcap) entry which it is using as a reference.

            On some systems, you may encounter situations where the shell which you  use  and  <u>xterm</u>  are  built
            using  libraries  with different terminal databases.  In that situation, <u>xterm</u> may choose a terminal
            description not known to the shell.

       <b>WINDOWID</b>
            is set to the X window id number of the <u>xterm</u> window.

       <b>XTERM_FILTER</b>
            is set if a locale-filter is used.  The value is the pathname of the filter.

       <b>XTERM_LOCALE</b>
            shows the locale which was used by <u>xterm</u> on startup.  Some shell initialization scripts  may  set  a
            different locale.

       <b>XTERM_SHELL</b>
            is  set  to  the  pathname  of the program which is invoked.  Usually that is a shell program, e.g.,
            <u><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></u>.  Since it is not necessarily a shell program however, it is distinct from “SHELL”.

       <b>XTERM_VERSION</b>
            is set to the string displayed by the <b>-version</b> option.  That is normally an  identifier  for  the  X
            Window  libraries  used  to build <u>xterm</u>, followed by <u>xterm</u>'s patch number in parenthesis.  The patch
            number is also part of the response to a Secondary Device  Attributes  (DA)  control  sequence  (see
            <u>Xterm</u> <u>Control</u> <u>Sequences</u>).

   <b>System</b> <b>Dependent</b>
       Depending on your system configuration, <u>xterm</u> may also set the following:

       <b>COLUMNS</b>
            the width of the <u>xterm</u> in characters (cf: “stty columns”).

            When  this  variable  is  set, <u>curses</u> applications (and most terminal programs) will assume that the
            terminal has this many columns.

            <u>Xterm</u> would do this for systems which have no ability to tell the size of the terminal.   Those  are
            very rare, none newer than the mid 1990s when SVR4 became prevalent.

       <b>HOME</b>
            when <u>xterm</u> is configured (at build-time) to update utmp.

       <b>LINES</b>
            the height of the <u>xterm</u> in characters (cf: “stty rows”).

            When  this  variable  is  set, <u>curses</u> applications (and most terminal programs) will assume that the
            terminal has this many lines (rows).

            <u>Xterm</u> would do this for systems which have no ability to tell the size of the terminal.   Those  are
            very rare, none newer than the mid 1990s when SVR4 became prevalent.

       <b>LOGNAME</b>
            when <u>xterm</u> is configured (at build-time) to update utmp.

            Your configuration may have set <b>LOGNAME</b>; <u>xterm</u> does not modify that.  If it is unset, <u>xterm</u> will use
            <b>USER</b> if it is set.  Finally, if neither is set, <u>xterm</u> will use the <b><a href="../man3/getlogin.3.html">getlogin</a></b>(3) function.

       <b>SHELL</b>
            when  <u>xterm</u>  is  configured  (at  build-time) to update utmp.  It is also set if you provide a valid
            shell name as the optional parameter.

            <u>Xterm</u> sets this to an absolute pathname.  If you have set the variable to a relative pathname, <u>xterm</u>
            may set it to a different shell pathname.

            If you have set this to an pathname which does not correspond to a valid shell, <u>xterm</u> may unset  it,
            to avoid confusion.

       <b>TERMCAP</b>
            the  contents of the termcap entry corresponding to <b>$TERM</b>, with lines and columns values substituted
            for the actual size window you have created.

            This feature is, like <b>LINES</b> and <b>COLUMNS</b>, used rarely.  It addresses the same  limitation  of  a  few
            older systems by providing a way for <u>termcap</u>-based applications to get the initial screen size.

       <b>TERMINFO</b>
            may be defined to a nonstandard location using the configure script.

</pre><h4><b>WINDOW</b> <b>PROPERTIES</b></h4><pre>
       In the output from <b><a href="../man1/xprop.1.html">xprop</a></b>(1), there are several properties.

   <b>Properties</b> <b>set</b> <b>by</b> <b>X</b> <b>Toolkit</b>
       <b>WM_CLASS</b>
            This  shows the <u>instance</u> <u>name</u> and the X resource <u>class</u>, passed to <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> during initialization of
            <u>xterm</u>, e.g.,

                WM_CLASS(STRING) = "xterm", "UXTerm"

       <b>WM_CLIENT_LEADER</b>
            This shows the window-id which <u>xterm</u> provides with an environment variable (<b>WINDOWID</b>), e.g.,

                WM_CLIENT_LEADER(WINDOW): window id # 0x800023

       <b>WM_COMMAND</b>
            This shows the command-line arguments for <u>xterm</u> which are passed to <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> during initialization,
            e.g.,

                WM_COMMAND(STRING) = { "xterm", "-class", "UXTerm", "-title", "uxterm", "-u8" }

       <b>WM_ICON_NAME</b>
            This holds the icon title, which different window managers handle in various ways.  It  is  set  via
            the <b>iconName</b> resource.  Applications can change this using control sequences.

       <b>WM_LOCALE_NAME</b>
            This shows the result from the <b><a href="../man3/setlocale.3.html">setlocale</a></b>(3) function for the <u>LC_CTYPE</u> category, e.g.,

                WM_LOCALE_NAME(STRING) = "en_US.UTF-8"

       <b>WM_NAME</b>
            This  holds  the  window  title,  normally  at  the  top of <u>xterm</u>'s window.  It is set via the <b>title</b>
            resource.  Applications can change this using control sequences.

   <b>Properties</b> <b>set</b> <b>by</b> <b>Xterm</b>
       <u>X</u> <u>Toolkit</u> does not manage EWMH properties.  Xterm does this directly.

       <b>_NET_WM_ICON_NAME</b>
            stores the icon name.

       <b>_NET_WM_NAME</b>
            stores the title string.

       <b>_NET_WM_PID</b>
            stores the process identifier for <u>xterm</u>'s display.

   <b>Properties</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>Xterm</b>
       <b>_NET_SUPPORTED</b>
            Xterm checks this property on the <u>supporting</u>  <u>window</u>  to  decide  if  the  window  manager  supports
            specific  maximizing  styles.  That may include other window manager hints; <u>xterm</u> uses the X library
            calls to manage those.

       <b>_NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK</b>
            Xterm checks this to ensure that it will only update the EWMH properties for a window manager  which
            claims EWMH compliance.

       <b>_NET_WM_STATE</b>
            This  tells  <u>xterm</u> whether its window has been maximized by the window manager, and if so, what type
            of maximizing:

            <b>_NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN</b>

            <b>_NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_HORZ</b>

            <b>_NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_VERT</b>

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The actual pathnames given may differ on your system.

       <u><a href="file:/etc/shells">/etc/shells</a></u>
            contains a list of valid shell programs, used by <u>xterm</u> to decide if the “SHELL” environment variable
            should be set for the process started by <u>xterm</u>.

            On systems which have the <u>getusershell</u> function, <u>xterm</u> will use that function rather  than  directly
            reading the file, since the file may not be present if the system uses default settings.

       <u><a href="file:/var/run/utmp">/var/run/utmp</a></u>
            the system log file, which records user logins.

       <u><a href="file:/var/log/wtmp">/var/log/wtmp</a></u>
            the system log file, which records user logins and logouts.

       <u>/etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm</u>
            the <u>xterm</u> default application resources.

       <u>/etc/X11/app-defaults/XTerm-color</u>
            the <u>xterm</u> color application resources.  If your display supports color, use this

                *customization: -color

            in  your  .Xdefaults  file  to  automatically  use  this  resource  file  rather  than <u>/etc/X11/app-</u>
            <u>defaults/XTerm</u>.  If you do not do this, <u>xterm</u> uses its compiled-in  default  resource  settings  for
            colors.

       <u><a href="file:/usr/share/pixmaps">/usr/share/pixmaps</a></u>
            the directory in which <u>xterm</u>'s pixmap icon files are installed.

</pre><h4><b>ERROR</b> <b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       Most of the fatal error messages from <u>xterm</u> use the following format:

           xterm: Error <u>XXX</u>, errno <u>YYY</u>: <u>ZZZ</u>

       The <u>XXX</u> codes (which are used by <u>xterm</u> as its exit-code) are listed below, with a brief explanation.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Large pastes do not work on some systems.  This is not a bug in <u>xterm</u>; it is a bug in the pseudo terminal
       driver  of  those systems.  <u>Xterm</u> feeds large pastes to the pty only as fast as the pty will accept data,
       but some pty drivers do not return enough information to know if the write has succeeded.

       When connected to an input method, it is possible for <u>xterm</u> to hang if the XIM  server  is  suspended  or
       killed.

       Many of the options are not resettable after <u>xterm</u> starts.

       This  program  still  needs  to  be  rewritten.   It should be split into very modular sections, with the
       various emulators being completely separate widgets that do not know about each  other.   Ideally,  you'd
       like to be able to pick and choose emulator widgets and stick them into a single control widget.

       There needs to be a dialog box to allow entry of the Tek COPY file name.

       EWMH  uses  <u>UTF8_STRING</u>  pervasively without defining it, but does mention the ICCCM.  Version 2.0 of the
       ICCCM does not address UTF-8.  That is an extension added in XFree86.

       •   Markus Kuhn summarized this in <u>UTF-8</u> <u>and</u> <u>Unicode</u> <u>FAQ</u> <u>for</u> <u>Unix/Linux</u> (2001), in the  section  “Is  X11
           ready for Unicode?”

           https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html

       •   Juliusz  Chroboczek  proposed  the  UTF8_STRING selection atom in 1999/2000, which became part of the
           ICCCM in XFree86.

           https://www.irif.fr/~jch/software/UTF8_STRING/

           An Xorg developer removed that part of the documentation in 2004 when incorporating other  work  from
           XFree86 into Xorg.  The feature is still supported in Xorg, though undocumented as of 2019.
