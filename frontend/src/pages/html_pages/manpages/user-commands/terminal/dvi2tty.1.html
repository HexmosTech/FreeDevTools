       dvi2tty - preview a TeX DVI file on an ordinary ASCII terminal

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dvi2tty</b> [ options ] dvifile

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>dvi2tty</u>  converts  a  TeX  DVI  file to a format that is appropriate for terminals and line printers. The
       program is intended to be used for preliminary proofreading of TeX-ed documents.  By default  the  output
       is  directed  to the terminal, possibly through a pager (depending on how the program was installed), but
       it can be directed to a file or a pipe.

       The output leaves much to be desired, but is still useful if you want  to  avoid  walking  to  the  laser
       printer (or whatever) for each iteration of your document.
       Since  <u>dvi2tty</u>  produces  output  for  terminals  and  line  printers  the representation of documents is
       naturally quite primitive.  In principle font changes are totally ignored, but <u>dvi2tty</u> recognizes  a  few
       mathematical and special symbols that can be displayed on an ordinary ASCII terminal, such as the '+' and
       '-' symbol.

       If  the  width  of  the output text requires more columns than fits in one line (cf. the -w option) it is
       broken into several lines by <u>dvi2tty</u> although they will be printed as one  line  on  regular  TeX  output
       devices  (e.g.,  laser  printers). To show that a broken line is really just one logical line an asterisk
       (``*'') in the last position means that the logical line is continued on the next physical line output by
       <u>dvi2tty.</u>  Such a continuation line is started with a space and an asterisk in the first two columns.

       Options may be specified  in  the  environment  variable  DVI2TTY.   Any  option  on  the  command  line,
       conflicting with one in the environment, will override the one from the environment.

       <b>Options:</b>

       <b>-o</b> <b>file</b>
              Write output to file ``file''.

       <b>-p</b> <b>list</b>
              Print the pages chosen by list.  Numbers refer to TeX page numbers (known as \count0).  An example
              of  format  for list is ``1,3:6,8'' to choose pages 1, 3 through 6 and 8.  Negative numbers can be
              used exactly as in TeX, e.g., -1 comes before -4 as in ``-p-1:-4,17''.

       <b>-P</b> <b>list</b>
              Like -p except that page numbers refer to the sequential ordering of the pages  in  the  dvi-file.
              Negative numbers don't make a lot of sense here...

       <b>-w</b> <b>n</b>   Specify terminal width <u>n.</u>  Valid range 16â€“132.  Default is 80. If your terminal has the ability to
              display in 132 columns it might be a good idea to use -w132 and toggle the terminal into this mode
              as output will probably look somewhat better.

       <b>-v</b>     Specify height of lines. Default value 450000. Allows one to adjust linespacing.

       <b>-q</b>     Don't  pipe the output through a pager.  This may be the default on some systems (depending on the
              whims of the person installing the program).

       <b>-e</b> <b>n</b>   This option can be used to influence the spacing between words.  With a negative value the  number
              of  spaces  between  words  becomes  less,  with a positive value it becomes more.  -e-11 seems to
              worked well.

       <b>-f</b>     Pipe through a pager, $PAGER if defined, or whatever the installer  of  the  program  compiled  in
              (often ``more''). This may be the default, but it is still okay to redirect output with ``&gt;'', the
              pager will not be used if output is not going to a terminal.

       <b>-F</b>     Specify  the  pager  program  to  be used.  This overrides the $PAGER environment variable and the
              default pager.

       <b>-Fprog</b> Use ``prog'' as program to pipe output into. Can be used  to  choose  an  alternate  pager  (e.g.,
              ``-Fless'').

       <b>-t</b>     \tt fonts were used (instead of cm) to produce the dvi file.

       <b>-a</b>     Dvi2tty  normally tries to output accented characters. With the -a option, accented characters are
              output without the accent sign.

       <b>-l</b>     Mark page breaks with the two-character sequence ``^L''. The default is to mark them with a  form-
              feed character.

       <b>-c</b>     Do not attempt to translate any characters (like the Scandinavian/latin1 mode) except when running
              in tt-font.

       <b>-u</b>     Toggle  option  to  process  certain  latin1  characters. Use this if your output devices supports
              latin1 characters.  Note this may interfere with -s. Best not to use -u and -s together.

       <b>-s</b>     Toggle option to process the special Scandinavian  characters  that  on  most  (?)   terminals  in
              Scandinavia  are mapped to ``{|}[\]''.  Note this may interfere with -u. Best not to use -u and -s
              together.

       <b>-J</b>     Auto detect NTT JTeX, ASCII pTeX, and upTeX dvi format.

       <b>-N</b>     Display NTT JTeX dvi.

       <b>-A</b>     Display ASCII pTeX dvi.

       <b>-U</b>     Display upTeX dvi.

       <b>-Eenc</b>  Set output Japanese encoding. The enc argument 'e', 's', 'j', and 'u' denotes  EUC-JP,  Shift_JIS,
              ISO-2022-JP, and UTF-8, respectively.

       <b>-bdelim</b>
              Print  the  name  of  fonts  when  switching  to it (and ending it). The delim argument is used to
              delimit the fontname.

       <b>-h</b>     Show a help massage and exit successfully.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:/bin/more">/bin/more</a>     probably the default pager.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       PAGER         the pager to use.
       DVI2TTY       can be set to hold command-line options.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Blanks between words get lost quite easily. This is less likely if you are using a wider output than  the
       default 80.

       Only one file may be specified on the command line.
