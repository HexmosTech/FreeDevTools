</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pterm ‐ yet another X terminal emulator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pterm</b> [ <u>options</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pterm</b> is a terminal emulator for X. It is based on a port of the terminal emulation engine in the Windows
       SSH client PuTTY.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The command-line options supported by <b>pterm</b> are:

       <b>-e</b> <u>command</u> [ <u>arguments</u> ]
              Specify  a  command  to be executed in the new terminal. Everything on the command line after this
              option will be passed straight to the <b>execvp</b> system call; so if you need the command  to  redirect
              its input or output, you will have to use <b>sh</b>:

              pterm -e sh -c 'mycommand &lt; inputfile'

       <b>--display</b> <u>display-name</u>
              Specify  the  X  display  on  which to open <b>pterm</b>. (Note this option has a double minus sign, even
              though none of the others do. This is because  this  option  is  supplied  automatically  by  GTK.
              Sorry.)

       <b>-name</b> <u>name</u>
              Specify  the  name  under  which <b>pterm</b> looks up X resources. Normally it will look them up as (for
              example) <b>pterm.Font</b>. If you specify `<b>-name</b> <b>xyz</b>', it will look them up as  <b>xyz.Font</b>  instead.  This
              allows you to set up several different sets of defaults and choose between them.

       <b>-fn</b> <u>font-name</u>
              Specify  the  font  to  use  for  normal  text  displayed in the terminal. For example, <b>-fn</b> <b>fixed</b>,
              <b>-fn</b> <b>"Monospace</b> <b>12"</b>.

       <b>-fb</b> <u>font-name</u>
              Specify the font to use for bold text displayed in the terminal. If the <b>BoldAsColour</b>  resource  is
              set  to  1  (the default), bold text will be displayed in different colours instead of a different
              font, so this option will be ignored. If <b>BoldAsColour</b> is set to 0 or 2 and you do  not  specify  a
              bold font, <b>pterm</b> will overprint the normal font to make it look bolder.

       <b>-fw</b> <u>font-name</u>
              Specify  the font to use for double-width characters (typically Chinese, Japanese and Korean text)
              displayed in the terminal.

       <b>-fwb</b> <u>font-name</u>
              Specify the font to use for bold double-width characters (typically Chinese, Japanese  and  Korean
              text). Like <b>-fb</b>, this will be ignored unless the <b>BoldAsColour</b> resource is set to 0 or 2.

       <b>-geometry</b> <u>geometry</u>
              Specify  the  size  of the terminal, in rows and columns of text. See <b>X</b>(<u>7</u>) for more information on
              the syntax of geometry specifications.

       <b>-sl</b> <u>lines</u>
              Specify the number of lines of scrollback to save off the top of the terminal.

       <b>-fg</b> <u>colour</u>
              Specify the foreground colour to use for normal text.

       <b>-bg</b> <u>colour</u>
              Specify the background colour to use for normal text.

       <b>-bfg</b> <u>colour</u>
              Specify the foreground colour to use for bold text, if the <b>BoldAsColour</b> resource is set to 1  (the
              default) or 2.

       <b>-bbg</b> <u>colour</u>
              Specify  the foreground colour to use for bold reverse-video text, if the <b>BoldAsColour</b> resource is
              set to 1 (the default) or 2. (This colour is best thought of as the bold version of the background
              colour; so it only appears when text is displayed <u>in</u> the background colour.)

       <b>-cfg</b> <u>colour</u>
              Specify the foreground colour to use for text covered by the cursor.

       <b>-cbg</b> <u>colour</u>
              Specify the background colour to use for text covered by the cursor. In other words, this  is  the
              main colour of the cursor.

       <b>-title</b> <u>title</u>
              Specify  the  initial  title  of  the  terminal  window. (This can be changed under control of the
              server.)

       <b>-ut-</b> or <b>+ut</b>
              Tells <b>pterm</b> not to record your login in the <b>utmp</b>, <b>wtmp</b> and <b>lastlog</b> system log files; so  you  will
              not show up on <b>finger</b> or <b>who</b> listings, for example.

       <b>-ut</b>    Tells  <b>pterm</b> to record your login in <b>utmp</b>, <b>wtmp</b> and <b>lastlog</b>: this is the opposite of <b>-ut-</b>. This is
              the default option: you will probably only need to specify it explicitly if you have  changed  the
              default using the <b>StampUtmp</b> resource.

       <b>-ls-</b> or <b>+ls</b>
              Tells <b>pterm</b> not to execute your shell as a login shell.

       <b>-ls</b>    Tells  <b>pterm</b>  to  execute  your  shell as a login shell: this is the opposite of <b>-ls-</b>. This is the
              default option: you will probably only need to specify it  explicitly  if  you  have  changed  the
              default using the <b>LoginShell</b> resource.

       <b>-sb-</b> or <b>+sb</b>
              Tells <b>pterm</b> not to display a scroll bar.

       <b>-sb</b>    Tells <b>pterm</b> to display a scroll bar: this is the opposite of <b>-sb-</b>. This is the default option: you
              will  probably  only  need  to  specify  it  explicitly  if you have changed the default using the
              <b>ScrollBar</b> resource.

       <b>-log</b> <u>logfile</u>, <b>-sessionlog</b> <u>logfile</u>
              This option makes <b>pterm</b> log all the terminal output to a file as well  as  displaying  it  in  the
              terminal.

       <b>-cs</b> <u>charset</u>
              This  option  specifies  the  character set in which <b>pterm</b> should assume the session is operating.
              This character set will be used to interpret all the data received from the session, and all input
              you type or paste into <b>pterm</b> will be converted into this character set before being  sent  to  the
              session.

              Any  character  set  name which is valid in a MIME header (and supported by <b>pterm</b>) should be valid
              here (examples are `<b>ISO-8859-1</b>', `<b>windows-1252</b>' or `<b>UTF-8</b>'). Also, any character encoding which is
              valid in an X logical font description should be valid (`<b>ibm-cp437</b>', for example).

              <b>pterm</b>'s default behaviour is to use the same character encoding as its primary font. If you supply
              a Unicode (<b>iso10646-1</b>) font, it will default to the UTF-8 character set.

              Character set names are case-insensitive.

       <b>-nethack</b>
              Tells <b>pterm</b> to enable NetHack keypad mode, in which  the  numeric  keypad  generates  the  NetHack
              <b>hjklyubn</b>  direction  keys. This enables you to play NetHack with the numeric keypad without having
              to use the NetHack <b>number_pad</b> option (which requires you to press `<b>n</b>' before any repeat count). So
              you can move with the numeric keypad, and enter repeat counts with the normal number keys.

       <b>-xrm</b> <u>resource-string</u>
              This option specifies an X resource string. Useful for setting resources which do not  have  their
              own command-line options. For example:

              pterm -xrm 'ScrollbarOnLeft: 1'

       <b>-help</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display a message summarizing the available options.

       <b>-pgpfp</b> Display  the  fingerprints of the PuTTY PGP Master Keys, to aid in verifying new files released by
              the PuTTY team.

</pre><h4><b>X</b> <b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pterm</b> can be more completely configured by means of X resources. All of these resources are of  the  form
       <b>pterm.FOO</b>  for  some  <b>FOO</b>;  you  can  make  <b>pterm</b>  look  them  up under another name, such as <b>xyz.FOO</b>, by
       specifying the command-line option `<b>-name</b> <b>xyz</b>'.

       <b>pterm.CloseOnExit</b>
              This option should be set to 0, 1 or 2; the default is 2. It controls what  <b>pterm</b>  does  when  the
              process  running inside it terminates. When set to 2 (the default), <b>pterm</b> will close its window as
              soon as the process inside it terminates. When set to 0,  <b>pterm</b>  will  print  the  process's  exit
              status,  and  the  window  will remain present until a key is pressed (allowing you to inspect the
              scrollback, and copy and paste text out of it).

              When this setting is set to 1, <b>pterm</b> will close immediately if the process exits cleanly (with  an
              exit status of zero), but the window will stay around if the process exits with a non-zero code or
              on  a  signal. This enables you to see what went wrong if the process suffers an error, but not to
              have to bother closing the window in normal circumstances.

       <b>pterm.WarnOnClose</b>
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 1. When set to 1, <b>pterm</b>  will  ask  for
              confirmation before closing its window when you press the close button.

       <b>pterm.TerminalType</b>
              This  controls the value set in the <b>TERM</b> environment variable inside the new terminal. The default
              is `<b>xterm</b>'.

       <b>pterm.BackspaceIsDelete</b>
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the  default  is  1.  When  set  to  0,  the  ordinary
              Backspace  key  generates  the  Backspace  character  (<b>^H</b>); when set to 1, it generates the Delete
              character (<b>^?</b>). Whichever one you set, the terminal device inside <b>pterm</b> will be set up  to  expect
              it.

       <b>pterm.RXVTHomeEnd</b>
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. When it is set to 1, the Home and
              End keys generate the control sequences they would generate in the <b>rxvt</b> terminal emulator, instead
              of the more usual ones generated by other emulators.

       <b>pterm.LinuxFunctionKeys</b>
              This option can be set to any number between 0 and 5 inclusive; the default is 0. The  modes  vary
              the  control  sequences sent by the function keys; for more complete documentation, it is probably
              simplest to try each option in `<b>pterm</b> <b>-e</b> <b>cat</b>', and press the keys to see what they generate.

       <b>pterm.NoApplicationKeys</b>
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. When set to 1, it stops  the  server
              from  ever  switching  the numeric keypad into application mode (where the keys send function-key-
              like sequences instead of numbers or arrow keys). You probably only need this if some  application
              is making a nuisance of itself.

       <b>pterm.NoApplicationCursors</b>
              This  option  should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. When set to 1, it stops the server
              from ever switching the cursor keys into application mode (where the keys send slightly  different
              sequences). You probably only need this if some application is making a nuisance of itself.

       <b>pterm.NoMouseReporting</b>
              This  option  should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. When set to 1, it stops the server
              from ever enabling mouse reporting mode (where mouse clicks are sent to the application instead of
              controlling cut and paste).

       <b>pterm.NoRemoteResize</b>
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. When set to 1, it stops  the  server
              from being able to remotely control the size of the <b>pterm</b> window.

       <b>pterm.NoAltScreen</b>
              This  option  should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. When set to 1, it stops the server
              from using the `alternate screen' terminal feature, which lets full-screen applications leave  the
              screen exactly the way they found it.

       <b>pterm.NoRemoteWinTitle</b>
              This  option  should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. When set to 1, it stops the server
              from remotely controlling the title of the <b>pterm</b> window.

       <b>pterm.NoRemoteQTitle</b>
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 1. When set to 1, it stops  the  server
              from remotely requesting the title of the <b>pterm</b> window.

              This  feature  is  a  <u>POTENTIAL</u> <u>SECURITY</u> <u>HAZARD</u>. If a malicious application can write data to your
              terminal (for example, if you merely <b>cat</b> a file owned by someone else on the server  machine),  it
              can  change  your window title (unless you have disabled this using the <b>NoRemoteWinTitle</b> resource)
              and then use this service to have the new window title sent back to the server as if typed at  the
              keyboard.  This  allows  an  attacker  to  fake  keypresses and potentially cause your server-side
              applications to do things you didn't want. Therefore this feature is disabled by default,  and  we
              recommend you do not turn it on unless you <u>really</u> know what you are doing.

       <b>pterm.NoDBackspace</b>
              This  option  should  be  set  to  either 0 or 1; the default is 0. When set to 1, it disables the
              normal action of the Delete (<b>^?</b>) character when sent from the server to the terminal, which is  to
              move the cursor left by one space and erase the character now under it.

       <b>pterm.ApplicationCursorKeys</b>
              This  option  should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. When set to 1, the default initial
              state of the cursor keys are application mode (where the  keys  send  function-key-like  sequences
              instead of numbers or arrow keys). When set to 0, the default state is the normal one.

       <b>pterm.ApplicationKeypad</b>
              This  option  should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. When set to 1, the default initial
              state of the numeric keypad is application mode (where the keys send  function-key-like  sequences
              instead of numbers or arrow keys). When set to 0, the default state is the normal one.

       <b>pterm.NetHackKeypad</b>
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. When set to 1, the numeric keypad
              operates in NetHack mode. This is equivalent to the <b>-nethack</b> command-line option.

       <b>pterm.Answerback</b>
              This option controls the string which the terminal sends in response to receiving the <b>^E</b> character
              (`tell me about yourself'). By default this string is `<b>PuTTY</b>'.

       <b>pterm.HideMousePtr</b>
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. When it  is  set  to  1,  the  mouse
              pointer  will  disappear  if  it is over the <b>pterm</b> window and you press a key. It will reappear as
              soon as you move it.

       <b>pterm.WindowBorder</b>
              This option controls the number of pixels of space between the text in the <b>pterm</b>  window  and  the
              window  frame.  The  default  is  1.  You  can  increase this value, but decreasing it to 0 is not
              recommended because it can cause the window manager's size hints to work incorrectly.

       <b>pterm.CurType</b>
              This option should be set to either 0, 1 or 2; the default is 0. When set to 0,  the  text  cursor
              displayed  in  the  window is a rectangular block. When set to 1, the cursor is an underline; when
              set to 2, it is a vertical line.

       <b>pterm.BlinkCur</b>
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. When it is set to 1, the text cursor
              will blink when the window is active.

       <b>pterm.Beep</b>
              This option should be set to either 0 or 2 (yes, 2); the default is 0. When it is set to 2,  <b>pterm</b>
              will respond to a bell character (<b>^G</b>) by flashing the window instead of beeping.

       <b>pterm.BellOverload</b>
              This  option  should  be  set  to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. When it is set to 1, <b>pterm</b> will
              watch out for large numbers of bells arriving in a short time and  will  temporarily  disable  the
              bell  until  they stop. The idea is that if you <b>cat</b> a binary file, the frantic beeping will mostly
              be silenced by this feature and will not drive you crazy.

              The bell overload mode is activated by receiving N bells in time T; after a further time S without
              any bells, overload mode will turn itself off again.

              Bell overload mode is always deactivated by any keypress  in  the  terminal.  This  means  it  can
              respond  to  large  unexpected  streams of data, but does not interfere with ordinary command-line
              activities that generate beeps (such as filename completion).

       <b>pterm.BellOverloadN</b>
              This option counts the number of bell characters which will activate bell  overload  if  they  are
              received within a length of time T. The default is 5.

       <b>pterm.BellOverloadT</b>
              This  option  specifies  the  time  period  in  which receiving N or more bells will activate bell
              overload mode. It is measured in microseconds, so (for example) set it to 1000000 for one  second.
              The default is 2000000 (two seconds).

       <b>pterm.BellOverloadS</b>
              This  option  specifies  the time period of silence required to turn off bell overload mode. It is
              measured in microseconds, so (for example) set it to  1000000  for  one  second.  The  default  is
              5000000 (five seconds of silence).

       <b>pterm.ScrollbackLines</b>
              This  option specifies how many lines of scrollback to save above the visible terminal screen. The
              default is 200. This resource is equivalent to the <b>-sl</b> command-line option.

       <b>pterm.DECOriginMode</b>
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. It specifies the  default  state  of
              DEC Origin Mode. (If you don't know what that means, you probably don't need to mess with it.)

       <b>pterm.AutoWrapMode</b>
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 1. It specifies the default state of
              auto wrap mode. When set to 1, very long lines will wrap over to the next line  on  the  terminal;
              when set to 0, long lines will be squashed against the right-hand edge of the screen.

       <b>pterm.LFImpliesCR</b>
              This  option  should  be  set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. When set to 1, the terminal will
              return the cursor to the left side of the screen when it receives a line feed character.

       <b>pterm.WinTitle</b>
              This resource is the same as the <b>-T</b> command-line option: it controls  the  initial  title  of  the
              window. The default is `<b>pterm</b>'.

       <b>pterm.TermWidth</b>
              This  resource is the same as the width part of the <b>-geometry</b> command-line option: it controls the
              number of columns of text in the window. The default is 80.

       <b>pterm.TermHeight</b>
              This resource is the same as the width part of the <b>-geometry</b> command-line option: it controls  the
              number of columns of text in the window. The defaults is 24.

       <b>pterm.Font</b>
              This  resource  is  the  same as the <b>-fn</b> command-line option: it controls the font used to display
              normal text. The default is `<b>fixed</b>'.

       <b>pterm.BoldFont</b>
              This resource is the same as the <b>-fb</b> command-line option: it controls the  font  used  to  display
              bold  text  when  <b>BoldAsColour</b>  is set to 0 or 2. The default is unset (the font will be bolded by
              printing it twice at a one-pixel offset).

       <b>pterm.WideFont</b>
              This resource is the same as the <b>-fw</b> command-line option: it controls the  font  used  to  display
              double-width characters. The default is unset (double-width characters cannot be displayed).

       <b>pterm.WideBoldFont</b>
              This  resource  is  the same as the <b>-fwb</b> command-line option: it controls the font used to display
              double-width characters in bold, when <b>BoldAsColour</b> is set to 0 or 2. The default is unset (double-
              width characters are displayed in bold by printing them twice at a one-pixel offset).

       <b>pterm.ShadowBoldOffset</b>
              This resource can be set to an integer; the default is ‐1. It specifies the offset at  which  text
              is  overprinted when using `shadow bold' mode. The default (1) means that the text will be printed
              in the normal place, and also one character to the right; this seems  to  work  well  for  most  X
              bitmap  fonts, which have a blank line of pixels down the right-hand side. For some fonts, you may
              need to set this to ‐1, so that the text is overprinted one pixel to the left;  for  really  large
              fonts, you may want to set it higher than 1 (in one direction or the other).

       <b>pterm.BoldAsColour</b>
              This  option  should  be  set  to  either 0, 1, or 2; the default is 1. It specifies how bold text
              should be displayed. When set to 1, bold text is shown by displaying it in a brighter colour; when
              set to 0, bold text is shown by displaying it in a heavier font;  when  set  to  2,  both  effects
              happen at once (a heavy font <u>and</u> a brighter colour).

       <b>pterm.Colour0</b>, <b>pterm.Colour1</b>, ..., <b>pterm.Colour21</b>
              These  options  control  the  various  colours  used to display text in the <b>pterm</b> window. Each one
              should be specified as a triple of decimal numbers giving red, green  and  blue  values:  so  that
              black is `<b>0,0,0</b>', white is `<b>255,255,255</b>', red is `<b>255,0,0</b>' and so on.

              Colours  0  and 1 specify the foreground colour and its bold equivalent (the <b>-fg</b> and <b>-bfg</b> command-
              line options). Colours 2 and 3 specify the background colour and its bold equivalent (the <b>-bg</b>  and
              <b>-bbg</b> command-line options). Colours 4 and 5 specify the text and block colours used for the cursor
              (the  <b>-cfg</b>  and  <b>-cbg</b> command-line options). Each even number from 6 to 20 inclusive specifies the
              colour to be used for one of the ANSI primary colour specifications (black,  red,  green,  yellow,
              blue,  magenta,  cyan,  white,  in that order); the odd numbers from 7 to 21 inclusive specify the
              bold version of each colour, in the same order. The defaults are:

              pterm.Colour0: 187,187,187
              pterm.Colour1: 255,255,255
              pterm.Colour2: 0,0,0
              pterm.Colour3: 85,85,85
              pterm.Colour4: 0,0,0
              pterm.Colour5: 0,255,0
              pterm.Colour6: 0,0,0
              pterm.Colour7: 85,85,85
              pterm.Colour8: 187,0,0
              pterm.Colour9: 255,85,85
              pterm.Colour10: 0,187,0
              pterm.Colour11: 85,255,85
              pterm.Colour12: 187,187,0
              pterm.Colour13: 255,255,85
              pterm.Colour14: 0,0,187
              pterm.Colour15: 85,85,255
              pterm.Colour16: 187,0,187
              pterm.Colour17: 255,85,255
              pterm.Colour18: 0,187,187
              pterm.Colour19: 85,255,255
              pterm.Colour20: 187,187,187
              pterm.Colour21: 255,255,255

       <b>pterm.RectSelect</b>
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. When set to 0,  dragging  the  mouse
              over several lines selects to the end of each line and from the beginning of the next; when set to
              1,  dragging the mouse over several lines selects a rectangular region. In each case, holding down
              Alt while dragging gives the other behaviour.

       <b>pterm.MouseOverride</b>
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 1. When set to 1,  if  the  application
              requests  mouse tracking (so that mouse clicks are sent to it instead of doing selection), holding
              down Shift will revert the mouse to normal selection. When set to  0,  mouse  tracking  completely
              disables selection.

       <b>pterm.Printer</b>
              This  option  is  unset by default. If you set it, then server-controlled printing is enabled: the
              server can send control sequences to request data to be sent to a printer. That data will be piped
              into the command you specify here; so you might want to set it to  `<b>lpr</b>',  for  example,  or  `<b>lpr</b>
              <b>-Pmyprinter</b>'.

       <b>pterm.ScrollBar</b>
              This  option  should  be  set  to either 0 or 1; the default is 1. When set to 0, the scrollbar is
              hidden (although Shift-PageUp and Shift-PageDown still work). This is the same as the <b>-sb</b> command-
              line option.

       <b>pterm.ScrollbarOnLeft</b>
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. When set to 1, the scrollbar will be
              displayed on the left of the terminal instead of on the right.

       <b>pterm.ScrollOnKey</b>
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. When set to 1, any  keypress  causes
              the position of the scrollback to be reset to the very bottom.

       <b>pterm.ScrollOnDisp</b>
              This  option  should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 1. When set to 1, any activity in the
              display causes the position of the scrollback to be reset to the very bottom.

       <b>pterm.LineCodePage</b>
              This option specifies the character set to be used for the session. This is the same  as  the  <b>-cs</b>
              command-line option.

       <b>pterm.NoRemoteCharset</b>
              This  option  disables  the terminal's ability to change its character set when it receives escape
              sequences telling it to. You might need to do this to interoperate with programs which incorrectly
              change the character set to something they think is sensible.

       <b>pterm.BCE</b>
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 1. When set to 1, the  various  control
              sequences  that  erase parts of the terminal display will erase in whatever the current background
              colour is; when set to 0, they will erase in black always.

       <b>pterm.BlinkText</b>
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 0. When set to  1,  text  specified  as
              blinking  by  the  server  will  actually blink on and off; when set to 0, <b>pterm</b> will use the less
              distracting approach of making the text's background colour bold.

       <b>pterm.StampUtmp</b>
              This option should be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 1. When set to 1, <b>pterm</b>  will  log  the
              login in the various system log files. This resource is equivalent to the <b>-ut</b> command-line option.

       <b>pterm.LoginShell</b>
              This  option  should  be set to either 0 or 1; the default is 1. When set to 1, <b>pterm</b> will execute
              your shell as a login shell. This resource is equivalent to the <b>-ls</b> command-line option.

       Most of the X resources have silly names. (Historical reasons from PuTTY, mostly.)
