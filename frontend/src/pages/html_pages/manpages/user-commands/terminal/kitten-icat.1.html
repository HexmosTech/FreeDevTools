       kitten-icat - Display images in the terminal

</pre><h4><b>Overview</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Display</u> <u>images</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>terminal</u>

       The <b>icat</b> kitten can be used to display arbitrary images in the <u>kitty</u> terminal. Using it is as simple as:

          kitten icat image.jpeg

       It  supports all image types supported by <u>ImageMagick</u>. It even works over SSH. For details, see the <u>kitty</u>
       <u>graphics</u> <u>protocol</u>.

       You might want to create an alias in your shell's configuration files:

          alias icat="kitten icat"

       Then you can simply use <b>icat</b> <b>image.png</b> to view images.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          <u>ImageMagick</u>  must  be  installed  for   the   full   range   of   image   types.   Without   it   only
          PNG/JPG/GIF/BMP/TIFF/WEBP are supported.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          kitty's  image display protocol may not work when used within a terminal multiplexer such as <b>screen</b> or
          <b>tmux</b>, depending on whether the multiplexer has added support for it or not.

       The <b>icat</b> kitten has various command line arguments to allow it to be used from inside other  programs  to
       display images. In particular, <u>--place</u>, <u>--detect-support</u> and <u>--print-window-size</u>.

       If you are trying to integrate icat into a complex program like a file manager or editor, there are a few
       things  to  keep in mind. icat normally works by communicating over the TTY device, it both writes to and
       reads from the TTY. So it is imperative that while it is running the host program does  not  do  any  TTY
       I/O.   Any  key  presses  or  other input from the user on the TTY device will be discarded. If you would
       instead like to use it just as a backend to generate the escape codes for image display, you need to pass
       it options to tell it the window dimensions, where to place the image in the window and the transfer mode
       to use. If you do that, it will not try to communicate with the TTY device at all. The requisite  options
       are:  <u>--use-window-size</u>,  <u>--place</u>  and  <u>--transfer-mode</u>,  <u>--stdin=no</u>.   For example, to demonstrate usage
       without access to the TTY:

          zsh -c 'setsid kitten icat --stdin=no --use-window-size $COLUMNS,$LINES,3000,2000 --transfer-mode=file myimage.png'

       Here, <b>setsid</b> ensures icat has no access to the TTY device.  The values, 3000, 2000 are made up. They  are
       the window width and height in pixels, to obtain which access to the TTY is needed.

       To  be  really  robust  you should consider writing proper support for the <u>kitty</u> <u>graphics</u> <u>protocol</u> in the
       program instead.  Nowadays there are many libraries that have support for it.

</pre><h4><b>Source</b> <b>code</b> <b>for</b> <b>icat</b></h4><pre>
       The source code for this kitten is <u>available</u> <u>on</u> <u>GitHub</u>.

</pre><h4><b>Command</b> <b>line</b> <b>interface</b></h4><pre>
          kitten icat [options] image-file-or-url-or-directory ...

       A cat like utility to display images in the  terminal.  You  can  specify  multiple  image  files  and/or
       directories.  Directories are scanned recursively for image files. If STDIN is not a terminal, image data
       will be read from it as well. You can also specify HTTP(S)  or  FTP  URLs  which  will  be  automatically
       downloaded and displayed.

   <b>Options</b>
       <b>--align</b> <b>&lt;ALIGN&gt;</b>
              Horizontal alignment for the displayed image.  Default: <b>center</b> Choices: <b>center</b>, <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>

       <b>--place</b> <b>&lt;PLACE&gt;</b>
              Choose  where  on  the  screen  to  display  the  image.  The image will be scaled to fit into the
              specified rectangle. The syntax for specifying rectangles  is  &lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;@&lt;left&gt;x&lt;top&gt;.  All
              measurements are in cells (i.e. cursor positions) with the origin (0, 0) at the top-left corner of
              the  screen. Note that the <u>--align</u> option will horizontally align the image within this rectangle.
              By default, the image is horizontally centered within the rectangle. Using place  will  cause  the
              cursor  to  be  positioned  at  the top left corner of the image, instead of on the line after the
              image.

       <b>--scale-up</b>
              When used in combination with <u>--place</u> it will cause images that are  smaller  than  the  specified
              area to be scaled up to use as much of the specified area as possible.

       <b>--background</b> <b>&lt;BACKGROUND&gt;</b>
              Specify  a  background  color,  this  will cause transparent images to be composited on top of the
              specified color.  Default: <b>none</b>

       <b>--mirror</b> <b>&lt;MIRROR&gt;</b>
              Mirror the image about a horizontal or vertical  axis  or  both.   Default:  <b>none</b>  Choices:  <b>both</b>,
              <b>horizontal</b>, <b>none</b>, <b>vertical</b>

       <b>--clear</b>
              Remove all images currently displayed on the screen.

       <b>--transfer-mode</b> <b>&lt;TRANSFER_MODE&gt;</b>
              Which  mechanism  to  use  to transfer images to the terminal. The default is to auto-detect. file
              means to use a temporary file, memory means to use shared memory, stream means to  send  the  data
              via  terminal  escape  codes.  Note  that if you use the file or memory transfer modes and you are
              connecting over a remote session then image display  will  not  work.   Default:  <b>detect</b>  Choices:
              <b>detect</b>, <b>file</b>, <b>memory</b>, <b>stream</b>

       <b>--detect-support</b>
              Detect  support  for  image display in the terminal. If not supported, will exit with exit code 1,
              otherwise will exit with code 0 and print the supported transfer mode to stderr, which can be used
              with the <u>--transfer-mode</u> option.

       <b>--detection-timeout</b> <b>&lt;DETECTION_TIMEOUT&gt;</b>
              The amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a response from the  terminal,  when  detecting  image
              display support.  Default: <b>10</b>

       <b>--use-window-size</b> <b>&lt;USE_WINDOW_SIZE&gt;</b>
              Instead of querying the terminal for the window size, use the specified size, which must be of the
              format: width_in_cells,height_in_cells,width_in_pixels,height_in_pixels

       <b>--print-window-size</b>
              Print  out  the window size as &lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt; (in pixels) and quit. This is a convenience method
              to query the window size if using <b>kitten</b> <b>icat</b> from a scripting language that cannot  make  termios
              calls.

       <b>--stdin</b> <b>&lt;STDIN&gt;</b>
              Read  image  data from STDIN. The default is to do it automatically, when STDIN is not a terminal,
              but you can turn it off or on explicitly, if needed.  Default: <b>detect</b> Choices: <b>detect</b>, <b>no</b>, <b>yes</b>

       <b>--silent</b>
              Not used, present for legacy compatibility.

       <b>--engine</b> <b>&lt;ENGINE&gt;</b>
              The engine used for decoding and processing of images. The default is to use the most  appropriate
              engine.  The <b>builtin</b> engine uses Go's native imaging libraries. The <b>magick</b> engine uses ImageMagick
              which requires it to be installed on the system.  Default: <b>auto</b> Choices: <b>auto</b>, <b>builtin</b>, <b>magick</b>

       <b>--z-index</b> <b>&lt;Z_INDEX&gt;,</b> <b>-z</b> <b>&lt;Z_INDEX&gt;</b>
              Z-index  of  the  image.  When  negative, text will be displayed on top of the image. Use a double
              minus for values under the threshold for drawing images under cell background colors. For example,
              <b>--1</b> evaluates as -1,073,741,825.  Default: <b>0</b>

       <b>--loop</b> <b>&lt;LOOP&gt;,</b> <b>-l</b> <b>&lt;LOOP&gt;</b>
              Number of times to loop animations. Negative values loop forever. Zero means only the first  frame
              of  the  animation is displayed. Otherwise, the animation is looped the specified number of times.
              Default: <b>-1</b>

       <b>--hold</b> Wait for a key press before exiting after displaying the images.

       <b>--unicode-placeholder</b>
              Use the Unicode placeholder method to display the images. Useful to  display  images  from  within
              full  screen  terminal  programs  that  do  not  understand  the  kitty  graphics protocol such as
              multiplexers or editors. See <u>Unicode</u> <u>placeholders</u> for details. Note that when using  this  method,
              images  placed  (with  <u>--place</u>) that do not fit on the screen, will get wrapped at the screen edge
              instead of getting truncated. This wrapping is per line and therefore the image will look like  it
              is interleaved with blank lines.

       <b>--passthrough</b> <b>&lt;PASSTHROUGH&gt;</b>
              Whether  to  surround  graphics  commands  with  escape  sequences  that allow them to passthrough
              programs like tmux. The default is to detect when running inside tmux and  automatically  use  the
              tmux   passthrough   escape   codes.   Note   that   when   this  option  is  enabled  it  implies
              <u>--unicode-placeholder</u> as well.  Default: <b>detect</b> Choices: <b>detect</b>, <b>none</b>, <b>tmux</b>

       <b>--image-id</b> <b>&lt;IMAGE_ID&gt;</b>
              The graphics protocol id to use for the created image. Normally, a random id is created if needed.
              This option allows control of the id. When multiple images are sent, sequential ids starting  from
              the  specified  id  are  used.  Valid ids are from 1 to 4294967295. Numbers outside this range are
              automatically wrapped.  Default: <b>0</b>

       <b>--no-trailing-newline,</b> <b>-n</b>
              By default, the cursor is moved to the next line after displaying an image. This option,  prevents
              that.  Should not be used when catting multiple images. Also has no effect when the <u>--place</u> option
              is used.
