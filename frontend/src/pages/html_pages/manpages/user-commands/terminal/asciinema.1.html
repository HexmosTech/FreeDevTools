</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>asciinema</b> - terminal session recorder

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>asciinema</b> <b>--version</b>
       <b>asciinema</b> <u>command</u> [<u>options</u>] [<u>args</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       asciinema lets you easily record terminal sessions, replay them in a terminal as well as in a web browser
       and  share  them  on  the web.  asciinema is Free and Open Source Software licensed under the GNU General
       Public License v3.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       asciinema is composed of multiple commands, similar to <b>git</b>, <b>apt-get</b> or <b>brew</b>.

       When you run <b>asciinema</b> with no arguments a help message is displayed, listing all available commands with
       their options.

   <b>rec</b> <b>[</b><u><b>filename</b></u>]
       Record terminal session.

       By running <b>asciinema</b> <b>rec</b> <b>[filename]</b> you start a new recording session.  The  command  (process)  that  is
       recorded  can  be  specified with <b>-c</b> option (see below), and defaults to <b>$SHELL</b> which is what you want in
       most cases.

       You can temporarily pause recording of terminal by pressing Ctrl+\.  This is useful when you want to exe‐
       cute some commands during the recording session that should not be captured (e.g. pasting secrets).   Re‐
       sume by pressing Ctrl+\ again.

       Recording  finishes  when you exit the shell (hit Ctrl+D or type <b>exit</b>).  If the recorded process is not a
       shell then recording finishes when the process exits.

       If the <u>filename</u> argument is omitted then (after asking for confirmation) the resulting asciicast  is  up‐
       loaded to asciinema-server (https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-server) (by default to asciinema.org),
       where it can be watched and shared.

       If  the  <u>filename</u>  argument  is given then the resulting recording (called asciicast) is saved to a local
       file.  It can later be replayed with <b>asciinema</b> <b>play</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> and/or uploaded to asciinema  server  with
       <b>asciinema</b> <b>upload</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>.

       <b>ASCIINEMA_REC=1</b>  is  added  to  recorded process environment variables.  This can be used by your shell’s
       config file (<b>.bashrc</b>, <b>.zshrc</b>) to alter the prompt or play a sound when the shell is being recorded.

       Available options:

              <b>--stdin</b>
                     Enable stdin (keyboard) recording (see below)

              <b>--append</b>
                     Append to existing recording

              <b>--raw</b>  Save raw STDOUT output, without timing information or other metadata

              <b>--overwrite</b>
                     Overwrite the recording if it already exists

              <b>-c,</b> <b>--command=&lt;command&gt;</b>
                     Specify command to record, defaults to <b>$SHELL</b>

              <b>-e,</b> <b>--env=&lt;var-names&gt;</b>
                     List of environment variables to capture, defaults to <b>SHELL,TERM</b>

              <b>-t,</b> <b>--title=&lt;title&gt;</b>
                     Specify the title of the asciicast

              <b>-i,</b> <b>--idle-time-limit=&lt;sec&gt;</b>
                     Limit recorded terminal inactivity to max <b>&lt;sec&gt;</b> seconds

              <b>--cols=&lt;n&gt;</b>
                     Override terminal columns for recorded process

              <b>--rows=&lt;n&gt;</b>
                     Override terminal rows for recorded process

              <b>-y,</b> <b>--yes</b>
                     Answer “yes” to all prompts (e.g. upload confirmation)

              <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
                     Be quiet, suppress all notices/warnings (implies <b>-y</b>)

       Stdin recording allows for capturing of all characters typed in by the user  in  the  currently  recorded
       shell.   This  may  be  used by a player (e.g.  asciinema-player (https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-
       player)) to display pressed keys.  Because it’s basically a key-logging (scoped to  a  single  shell  in‐
       stance), it’s disabled by default, and has to be explicitly enabled via <b>–stdin</b> option.

   <b>play</b> <b>&lt;</b><u><b>filename</b></u>&gt;
       Replay recorded asciicast in a terminal.

       This command replays a given asciicast (as recorded by <b>rec</b> command) directly in your terminal.  The asci‐
       icast can be read from a file or from <u><b>stdin</b></u> (`-'):

       Playing from a local file:

              asciinema play /path/to/asciicast.cast

       Playing from HTTP(S) URL:

              asciinema play https://asciinema.org/a/22124.cast
              asciinema play <a href="http://example.com/demo.cast">http://example.com/demo.cast</a>

       Playing   from   asciicast   page  URL  (requires  <b>&lt;link</b>  <b>rel="alternate"</b>  <b>type="application/x-asciicast"</b>
       <b>href="/my/ascii.cast"&gt;</b> in page’s HTML):

              asciinema play https://asciinema.org/a/22124
              asciinema play <a href="http://example.com/blog/post.html">http://example.com/blog/post.html</a>

       Playing from stdin:

              cat /path/to/asciicast.cast | asciinema play -
              ssh user@host cat asciicast.cast | asciinema play -

       Playing from IPFS:

              asciinema play dweb:/ipfs/QmNe7FsYaHc9SaDEAEXbaagAzNw9cH7YbzN4xV7jV1MCzK/ascii.cast

       Available options:

              <b>-i,</b> <b>--idle-time-limit=&lt;sec&gt;</b>
                     Limit replayed terminal inactivity to max <b>&lt;sec&gt;</b> seconds (can be fractional)

              <b>-s,</b> <b>--speed=&lt;factor&gt;</b>
                     Playback speed (can be fractional)

       While playing the following keyboard shortcuts are available:

              <u><b>Space</b></u>  Toggle pause

              <u><b>.</b></u>      Step through a recording a frame at a time (when paused)

              <u><b>Ctrl+C</b></u> Exit

       Recommendation: run `asciinema play' in a terminal of dimensions  not  smaller  than  the  one  used  for
       recording as there’s no “transcoding” of control sequences for the new terminal size.

   <b>cat</b> <b>&lt;</b><u><b>filename</b></u>&gt;
       Print full output of recorded asciicast to a terminal.

       While <b>asciinema</b> <b>play</b>  replays the recorded session using timing information saved in the asciicast, <b>asci‐</b>
       <b>inema</b> <b>cat</b> dumps the full output (including all escape sequences) to a terminal immediately.

       <b>asciinema</b>  <b>cat</b>  <b>existing.cast</b> <b>&gt;output.txt</b> gives the same result as recording via <b>asciinema</b> <b>rec</b> <b>--raw</b> <b>out‐</b>
       <b>put.txt</b>.

   <b>upload</b> <b>&lt;</b><u><b>filename</b></u>&gt;
       Upload recorded asciicast to asciinema.org site.

       This command uploads given asciicast (recorded by <b>rec</b> command) to asciinema.org, where it can be  watched
       and shared.

       <b>asciinema</b>  <b>rec</b>  <b>demo.cast</b>  + <b>asciinema</b> <b>play</b> <b>demo.cast</b> + <b>asciinema</b> <b>upload</b> <b>demo.cast</b> is a nice combo if you
       want to review an asciicast before publishing it on asciinema.org.

   <b>auth</b>
       Link and manage your install ID with your asciinema.org user account.

       If you want to manage your recordings (change title/theme, delete) at asciinema.org you need to link your
       “install ID” with your asciinema.org user account.

       This command displays the URL to open in a web browser to do that.  You may be asked to log in first.

       Install ID is a random ID (UUID v4 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier))  gener‐
       ated  locally when you run asciinema for the first time, and saved at <b>$HOME/.config/asciinema/install-id</b>.
       It’s purpose is to connect local machine with uploaded recordings, so they can later be  associated  with
       asciinema.org  account.  This way we decouple uploading from account creation, allowing them to happen in
       any order.

       Note: A new install ID is generated on each machine and system user account you use asciinema on.  So  in
       order  to  keep all recordings under a single asciinema.org account you need to run <b>asciinema</b> <b>auth</b> on all
       of those machines.  If you’re already logged in on asciinema.org website and  you  run  `asciinema  auth'
       from a new computer then this new device will be linked to your account.

       While  you  CAN  synchronize your config file (which keeps the API token) across all your machines so all
       use the same token, that’s not necessary.  You can assign new tokens to your account  from  as  many  ma‐
       chines as you want.

       Note: asciinema versions prior to 2.0 confusingly referred to install ID as “API token”.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Record your first session:

              asciinema rec first.cast

       End your session:

              exit

       Now replay it with double speed:

              asciinema play -s 2 first.cast

       Or with normal speed but with idle time limited to 2 seconds:

              asciinema play -i 2 first.cast

       You  can  pass  <b>-i</b>  <b>2</b> to <b>asciinema</b> <b>rec</b> as well, to set it permanently on a recording.  Idle time limiting
       makes the recordings much more interesting to watch, try it.

       If you want to watch and share it on the web, upload it:

              asciinema upload first.cast

       The   above   uploads   it   to   &lt;https://asciinema.org&gt;,   which   is   a   default    asciinema-server
       (&lt;https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-server&gt;) instance, and prints a secret link you can use to watch
       your recording in a web browser.

       You can record and upload in one step by omitting the filename:

              asciinema rec

       You’ll  be  asked  to  confirm the upload when the recording is done, so nothing is sent anywhere without
       your consent.

   <b>Tricks</b>
       Record slowly, play faster:
              First record a session where you can take your time to type slowly what you want to  show  in  the
              recording:

                     asciinema rec initial.cast

              Then  record  the  replay  of  `initial.cast'  as  `final.cast', but with five times the initially
              recorded speed, with all pauses capped to two seconds and with a title set as “My fancy title”::

                     asciinema rec -c "asciinema play -s 5 -i 2 initial.cast" -t "My fancy title" final.cast

       Play from <u><b>stdin</b></u>:

              cat /path/to/asciicast.json | asciinema play -

       Play file from remote host accessible with SSH:

              ssh user@host cat /path/to/asciicat.json | asciinema play -

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ASCIINEMA_API_URL</b>
              This variable allows overriding asciinema-server URL (which defaults to https://asciinema.org)  in
              case you’re running your own asciinema-server instance.

       <b>ASCIINEMA_CONFIG_HOME</b>
              This  variable  allows  overriding  config  directory  location.   Default  location  is $XDG_CON‐
              FIG_HOME/asciinema (when $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set) or $HOME/.config/asciinema.
