</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tic</b> - compile terminal descriptions for <u>terminfo</u> or <u>termcap</u>

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tic</b> [<b>-01acCDfgGIKLNqrstTUVWx</b>] [<b>-e</b> <u>terminal-type-list</u>] [<b>-o</b> <u>dir</u>] [<b>-Q</b>[<u>n</u>]] [<b>-R</b> <u>subset</u>] [<b>-v</b>[<u>n</u>]] [<b>-w</b>[<u>n</u>]] <u>file</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>tic</b> command translates a <b>terminfo</b> file from source format into compiled format.  The compiled format
       is necessary for use with the library routines in <b><a href="../man3NCURSES/ncurses.3NCURSES.html">ncurses</a></b>(3NCURSES).

       As described in <b><a href="../man5/term.5.html">term</a></b>(5), the database may be either a directory tree (one file per terminal entry)  or  a
       hashed  database (one record per entry).  The <b>tic</b> command writes only one type of entry, depending on how
       it was built:

       •   For directory trees, the top-level directory, e.g., <a href="file:/usr/share/terminfo">/usr/share/terminfo</a>, specifies  the  location  of
           the database.

       •   For  hashed databases, a filename is needed.  If the given file is not found by that name, but can be
           found by adding the suffix ".db", then that is used.

           The default name for the hashed database is the same as the default directory  name  (only  adding  a
           ".db" suffix).

       In either case (directory or hashed database), <b>tic</b> will create the container if it does not exist.  For a
       directory, this would be the “terminfo” leaf, versus a "terminfo.db" file.

       The  results  are  normally  placed in the system terminfo database <b><a href="file:/etc/terminfo">/etc/terminfo</a></b>.  The compiled terminal
       description can be placed in a different terminfo database.  There are two ways to achieve this:

       •   First, you may override the system default either by using the <b>-o</b> option, or by setting the  variable
           <u>TERMINFO</u> in your shell environment to a valid database location.

       •   Secondly,  if  <b>tic</b>  cannot  write  in  <u><a href="file:/etc/terminfo">/etc/terminfo</a></u>  or  the  location specified using your <u>TERMINFO</u>
           variable, it looks for the directory <u>$HOME/.terminfo</u> (or hashed database <u>$HOME/.terminfo.db)</u>; if that
           location exists, the entry is placed there.

       Libraries that read terminfo entries are expected to check in succession

       •   a location specified with the <u>TERMINFO</u> environment variable,

       •   <u>$HOME/.terminfo</u>,

       •   directories listed in the <u>TERMINFO_DIRS</u> environment variable,

       •   a compiled-in list of directories (<a href="file:/etc/terminfo">/etc/terminfo</a>:/lib/terminfo:<a href="file:/usr/share/terminfo">/usr/share/terminfo</a>), and

       •   the system terminfo database (<u><a href="file:/etc/terminfo">/etc/terminfo</a></u>).

       The <u>Fetching</u> <u>Compiled</u> <u>Descriptions</u> section in the <b><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></b>(5) manual goes into further detail.

   <b>Aliases</b>
       This is the same program as infotocap and captoinfo; usually those are linked to,  or  copied  from  this
       program:

       •   When invoked as infotocap, tic sets the <b>-I</b> option.

       •   When invoked as captoinfo, tic sets the <b>-C</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-0</b>     restricts the output to a single line

       <b>-1</b>     restricts the output to a single column

       <b>-a</b>     tells  <b>tic</b>  to  retain  commented-out  capabilities rather than discarding them.  Capabilities are
              commented by prefixing them with a period.  This  sets  the  <b>-x</b>  option,  because  it  treats  the
              commented-out  entries  as  user-defined  names.  If the source is termcap, accept the 2-character
              names required by version 6.  Otherwise these are ignored.

       <b>-C</b>     Force source translation to termcap format.  Note: this differs from the <b>-C</b> option  of  <b><a href="../man1/infocmp.1.html">infocmp</a></b>(1)
              in  that  it  does  not merely translate capability names, but also translates terminfo strings to
              termcap format.  Capabilities that are not translatable are left in the entry under their terminfo
              names but commented out with two  preceding  dots.   The  actual  format  used  incorporates  some
              improvements  for  escaped  characters  from  terminfo  format.   For  a  stricter  BSD-compatible
              translation, add the <b>-K</b> option.

              If this is combined with <b>-c</b>, <b>tic</b> makes additional checks to report cases where the terminfo values
              do not have an exact equivalent in termcap form.  For example:

              •   <b>sgr</b> usually will not convert, because termcap lacks the ability to work  with  more  than  two
                  parameters,  and  because  termcap  lacks  many  of  the  arithmetic/logical operators used in
                  terminfo.

              •   capabilities with more than one delay or with delays before the end of  the  string  will  not
                  convert completely.

       <b>-c</b>     tells  <b>tic</b>  to  only  check  <u>file</u> for errors, including syntax problems and bad use-links.  If you
              specify <b>-C</b> (<b>-I</b>) with this option, the code will print warnings  about  entries  which,  after  use
              resolution,  are  more than 1023 (4096) bytes long.  Due to a fixed buffer length in older termcap
              libraries, as well as buggy checking for the buffer length (and a documented limit  in  terminfo),
              these entries may cause core dumps with other implementations.

              <b>tic</b> checks string capabilities to ensure that those with parameters will be valid expressions.  It
              does  this  check only for the predefined string capabilities; those which are defined with the <b>-x</b>
              option are ignored.

       <b>-D</b>     tells <b>tic</b> to print the database locations that it knows about, and exit.  The first location shown
              is the one to which it would write compiled terminal descriptions.  If <b>tic</b> is not able to  find  a
              writable database location according to the rules summarized above, it will print a diagnostic and
              exit with an error rather than printing a list of database locations.

       <b>-e</b> <u>list</u>
              Limit writes and translations to the comma-separated <u>list</u> of terminal types.  If any name or alias
              of  a  terminal  matches  one of the names in the list, the entry will be written or translated as
              normal.  Otherwise no output will be generated for it.  The option value is interpreted as a  file
              containing  the  list if it contains a '/'.  (Note: depending on how tic was compiled, this option
              may require <b>-I</b> or <b>-C</b>.)

       <b>-f</b>     Display complex  terminfo  strings  which  contain  if/then/else/endif  expressions  indented  for
              readability.

       <b>-G</b>     Display constant literals in decimal form rather than their character equivalents.

       <b>-g</b>     Display constant character literals in quoted form rather than their decimal equivalents.

       <b>-I</b>     Force source translation to terminfo format.

       <b>-K</b>     Suppress some longstanding <u>ncurses</u> extensions to termcap format, e.g., "\s" for space.

       <b>-L</b>     Force source translation to terminfo format using the long C variable names listed in &lt;<b>term.h</b>&gt;

       <b>-N</b>     Disable smart defaults.  Normally, when translating from termcap to terminfo, the compiler makes a
              number  of  assumptions  about the defaults of string capabilities <b>reset1_string</b>, <b>carriage_return</b>,
              <b>cursor_left</b>, <b>cursor_down</b>, <b>scroll_forward</b>, <b>tab</b>, <b>newline</b>,  <b>key_backspace</b>,  <b>key_left</b>,  and  <b>key_down</b>,
              then  attempts  to  use  obsolete termcap capabilities to deduce correct values.  It also normally
              suppresses output of obsolete termcap capabilities such as <b>bs</b>.  This option forces a more  literal
              translation that also preserves the obsolete capabilities.

       <b>-o</b><u>dir</u>  Write compiled entries to given database location.  Overrides the <u>TERMINFO</u> environment variable.

       <b>-Q</b><u>n</u>    Rather  than  show  source  in  terminfo  (text)  format,  print  the  compiled (binary) format in
              hexadecimal or base64 form, depending on the option's value:

               1  hexadecimal

               2  base64

               3  hexadecimal and base64

       <b>-q</b>     Suppress comments and blank lines when showing translated source.

       <b>-R</b><u>subset</u>
              Restrict output to a given subset.  This option is for use with archaic versions of terminfo  like
              those  on SVr1, Ultrix, or HP-UX that do not support the full set of SVR4/XSI Curses terminfo; and
              outright broken ports like AIX 3.x that have their own extensions incompatible with SVr4/XSI.

              Available subsets are
              “SVr1”, “Ultrix”, “HP”, “BSD”, and “AIX”

              See <b><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></b>(5) for details.

       <b>-r</b>     Force entry resolution (so there are no remaining tc capabilities) even when doing translation  to
              termcap  format.   This  may  be  needed if you are preparing a termcap file for a termcap library
              (such as GNU termcap through version 1.3 or BSD termcap  through  4.3BSD)  that  does  not  handle
              multiple tc capabilities per entry.

       <b>-s</b>     Summarize  the  compile  by  showing the database location into which entries are written, and the
              number of entries which are compiled.

       <b>-T</b>     eliminates size-restrictions on the generated  text.   This  is  mainly  useful  for  testing  and
              analysis, since the compiled descriptions are limited (e.g., 1023 for termcap, 4096 for terminfo).

       <b>-t</b>     tells  <b>tic</b>  to  discard  commented-out  capabilities.   Normally when translating from terminfo to
              termcap, untranslatable capabilities are commented-out.

       <b>-U</b>     tells <b>tic</b> to not post-process the data after parsing the source file.  Normally,  it  infers  data
              which is commonly missing in older terminfo data, or in termcaps.

       <b>-V</b>     reports the version of <u>ncurses</u> which was used in this program, and exits.

       <b>-v</b><u>n</u>    specifies  that  (verbose)  output  be  written  to standard error trace information showing <b>tic</b>'s
              progress.

              The optional parameter <u>n</u> is a number from 1 to 9,  inclusive,  indicating  the  desired  level  of
              detail of information.

              •   If <u>ncurses</u> is built without tracing support, the optional parameter is ignored.

              •   If <u>n</u> is omitted, the default level is 1.

              •   If  <u>n</u>  is  specified  and  greater than 1, the level of detail is increased, and the output is
                  written (with tracing information) to the “trace” file.

              The debug flag levels are as follows:

              1   Names of files created and linked

              2   Information related to the “use” facility

              3   Statistics from the hashing algorithm

              4   Details of extended capabilities

              5   (unused)

              6   (unused)

              7   Entries into the string-table

              8   List of tokens encountered by scanner

              9   All values computed in construction of the hash table

       <b>-W</b>     By itself, the <b>-w</b> option will not force long strings to be wrapped.  Use the <b>-W</b> option to do this.

              If you specify both <b>-f</b> and <b>-W</b> options, the latter is ignored when <b>-f</b> has already split the line.

       <b>-w</b><u>n</u>    specifies the width of the output.  The parameter is optional.  If it is omitted, it  defaults  to
              60.

       <b>-x</b>     Treat  unknown  capabilities  as  user-defined  (see  <b><a href="../man5/user_caps.5.html">user_caps</a></b>(5)).   That  is,  if  you supply a
              capability name which <b>tic</b> does not recognize, it will infer its type (Boolean, number  or  string)
              from  the syntax and make an extended table entry for that.  User-defined capability strings whose
              name begins with “k” are treated as function keys.

   <b>Parameters</b>
       <u>file</u>   contains one or more <b>terminfo</b> terminal descriptions in  source  format  [see  <b><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></b>(5)].   Each
              description in the file describes the capabilities of a particular terminal.

              If <u>file</u> is “-”, then the data is read from the standard input.  The <u>file</u> parameter may also be the
              path of a character-device.

   <b>Processing</b>
       All  but  one  of the capabilities recognized by <b>tic</b> are documented in <b><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></b>(5).  The exception is the
       <b>use</b> capability.

       When a <b>use</b>=<u>entry</u>-<u>name</u> field is discovered in a terminal entry currently being compiled, <b>tic</b> reads in  the
       binary  from  <b><a href="file:/etc/terminfo">/etc/terminfo</a></b>  to  complete the entry.  (Entries created from <u>file</u> will be used first.  <b>tic</b>
       duplicates the capabilities in <u>entry</u>-<u>name</u> for the current entry, with the exception of those capabilities
       that explicitly are defined in the current entry.

       When an entry, e.g., <b>entry_name_1</b>, contains  a  <b>use=</b><u>entry</u>_<u>name</u>_<u>2</u>  field,  any  canceled  capabilities  in
       <u>entry</u>_<u>name</u>_<u>2</u>  must  also  appear  in  <b>entry_name_1</b>  before  <b>use=</b> for these capabilities to be canceled in
       <b>entry_name_1</b>.

       Total compiled entries cannot exceed 4096 bytes in the legacy storage format, or 32768 using the extended
       number format.  The name field cannot exceed 512 bytes.   Terminal  names  exceeding  the  maximum  alias
       length  (32  characters on systems with long filenames, 14 characters otherwise) will be truncated to the
       maximum alias length and a warning message will be printed.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/etc/terminfo">/etc/terminfo</a></u>
              compiled terminal description database

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       There is some evidence that historic <b>tic</b> implementations treated description fields with no whitespace in
       them as additional aliases or short names.  This <b>tic</b> does not do that, but it does warn when  description
       fields may be treated that way and check them for dangerous characters.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Unlike  the SVr4 <b>tic</b> command, this implementation can actually compile termcap sources.  In fact, entries
       in terminfo and termcap syntax can be mixed in a single source file.  See <b><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></b>(5)  for  the  list  of
       termcap names taken to be equivalent to terminfo names.

       The SVr4 manual pages are not clear on the resolution rules for <b>use</b> capabilities.  This implementation of
       <b>tic</b>  will  find  <b>use</b> targets anywhere in the source file, or anywhere in the file tree rooted at <u>TERMINFO</u>
       (if <u>TERMINFO</u> is defined), or in the user's <u>$HOME/.terminfo</u> database (if it exists), or (finally) anywhere
       in the system's file tree of compiled entries.

       The error messages from this <b>tic</b> have the same format as GNU C error messages, and can be parsed  by  GNU
       Emacs's compile facility.

       Aside from <b>-c</b> and <b>-v</b>, options are not portable:

       •   Most of tic's options are not supported by SVr4 <b>tic</b>:

           <b>-0</b> <b>-1</b> <b>-C</b> <b>-G</b> <b>-I</b> <b>-N</b> <b>-R</b> <b>-T</b> <b>-V</b> <b>-a</b> <b>-e</b> <b>-f</b> <b>-g</b> <b>-o</b> <b>-r</b> <b>-s</b> <b>-t</b> <b>-x</b>

       •   The NetBSD <b>tic</b> supports a few of the <u>ncurses</u> options

           <b>-a</b> <b>-o</b> <b>-x</b>

           and adds <b>-S</b> (a feature which does the same thing as infocmp's <b>-e</b> and <b>-E</b> options).

       The SVr4 <b>-c</b> mode does not report bad “use=” links.

       System  V  does not compile entries to or read entries from your <u>$HOME/.terminfo</u> database unless <u>TERMINFO</u>
       is explicitly set to it.

</pre><h4><b>PORTABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       X/Open Curses Issue 7 (2009) provides a brief description of <b>tic</b>.  It lists one option: <b>-c</b>.  The omission
       of <b>-v</b> is unexpected.  The change history states that the description is derived from Tru64.  According to
       its manual pages, that system also supported the <b>-v</b> option.

       Shortly after Issue 7 was released, Tru64 was discontinued.  As of 2019, the surviving implementations of
       <b>tic</b> are SVr4 (AIX, HP-UX and Solaris), <u>ncurses</u> and NetBSD curses.  The SVr4 <b>tic</b> programs all support  the
       <b>-v</b> option.  The NetBSD <b>tic</b> program follows X/Open's documentation, omitting the <b>-v</b> option.

       The X/Open rationale states that some implementations of <b>tic</b> read terminal descriptions from the standard
       input  if  the  <u>file</u>  parameter is omitted.  None of these implementations do that.  Further, it comments
       that some may choose to read from ”./terminfo.src” but that is obsolescent behavior from SVr2, and is not
       (for example) a documented feature of SVr3.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       System V Release 2 provided a <b>tic</b> utility.  It accepted a single option: <b>-v</b>  (optionally  followed  by  a
       number).   According  to  Ross  Ridge's  comment  in <u>mytinfo</u>, this version of <b>tic</b> was unable to represent
       canceled capabilities.

       System V Release 3 provided a different <b>tic</b> utility, written by Pavel Curtis, (originally named “compile”
       in <u>pcurses</u>).  This added an option <b>-c</b> to check the file for errors, with the caveat that errors in “use=”
       links would not be reported.  System V Release 3 documented a few warning messages which did  not  appear
       in  <u>pcurses</u>.   While the program itself was changed little as development continued with System V Release
       4, the table of capabilities grew from 180 (<u>pcurses</u>) to 464 (Solaris).

       In early development of <u>ncurses</u> (1993), Zeyd Ben-Halim used the table from <u>mytinfo</u> to extend the  <u>pcurses</u>
       table  to 469 capabilities (456 matched SVr4, 8 were only in SVr4, 13 were not in SVr4).  Of those 13, 11
       were ultimately  discarded  (perhaps  to  match  the  draft  of  X/Open  Curses).   The  exceptions  were
       <b>memory_lock_above</b> and <b>memory_unlock</b> (see <b><a href="../man5/user_caps.5.html">user_caps</a></b>(5)).

       Eric  Raymond  incorporated  parts  of  <u>mytinfo</u>  into <u>ncurses</u> to implement the termcap-to-terminfo source
       conversion, and extended that to  begin  development  of  the  corresponding  terminfo-to-termcap  source
       conversion, Thomas Dickey completed that development over the course of several years.

       In 1999, Thomas Dickey added the <b>-x</b> option to support user-defined capabilities.

       In  2010, Roy Marples provided a <b>tic</b> program and terminfo library for NetBSD.  That implementation adapts
       several features from <u>ncurses</u>, including <b>tic</b>'s <b>-x</b> option.

       The <b>-c</b> option tells <b>tic</b> to check for  problems  in  the  terminfo  source  file.   Continued  development
       provides additional checks:

       •   <u>pcurses</u> had 8 warnings

       •   <u>ncurses</u> in 1996 had 16 warnings

       •   Solaris (SVr4) curses has 28 warnings

       •   NetBSD tic in 2019 has 19 warnings.

       •   <u>ncurses</u> in 2019 has 96 warnings

       The  checking  done  in <u>ncurses</u>' <b>tic</b> helps with the conversion to termcap, as well as pointing out errors
       and inconsistencies.  It is also used to ensure consistency with the  user-defined  capabilities.   There
       are 527 distinct capabilities in <u>ncurses</u>' terminal database; 128 of those are user-defined.
