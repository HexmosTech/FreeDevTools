       Terminal - GNUstep Terminal Emulator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>openapp</b> <b>Terminal</b> <b>[program</b> <b>[arguments</b> <b>...]]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  documents briefly the <b>Terminal</b> GNUstep application.  This manual page was written for
       the Debian distribution because the original program does not have a manual page.

       <b>Terminal</b> provides terminal emulation in  a  GNUstep  environment.   It  gives  colorized  terminals  with
       configurable fonts, and also allows users to configure shell utilities as GNUstep services.

   <b>Fonts</b>
       You  can  change the fonts used for normal and bold text in the preferences panel.  Terminal will get the
       metrics for the character cells from the normal font, so this font really should be a fixed pitch font or
       things will look messed up.  The bold font should closely match the normal font.

       Terminal assumes that all characters, bold and normal, stay inside the normal font's  bounding  box.   If
       they  don't,  there  will  be  visual glitches.  However, it is more common that a non-fixed pitch font's
       bounding box is very large (since it needs to enclose <u>all</u> characters in the font), so that  the  terminal
       window will be very wide.

   <b>Keys</b>
       By default, the command key is used to access key equivalents for menu entries, and thus can't be used as
       a  meta  key  in  the  terminal.   If you have command mapped to the key you want to use as meta, you can
       enable `Treat the command key as meta' in the preferences panel.  However,  this  will  disable  all  key
       equivalents in Terminal.  The `proper' solution to this problem is to remap the command key (and possibly
       alternate key).  The alternate key will always be treated as meta.

       Often,  the  escape  key  can be used to emulate a meta key.  This means that in some programs, you might
       have to press escape twice to get a `real' escape, or there will be a delay before it  is  handled.   The
       `Send a double escape...' option causes Terminal to send a double escape when you hit the escape key (ie.
       "\e\e"), which should work better (but you can no longer use the escape key as meta).

   <b>Terminal</b> <b>services</b>
       Terminal  can provide services for other applications by piping the selection through arbitrary commands.
       Services are configured in one of the preferences panel's tabs.  The first time  you  open  this  tab,  a
       default set of services will be loaded.  To save these where make_services will actually find them, press
       `Apply and save'.  This will also run make_services to update the services list, but it may take up to 30
       seconds for running applications to notice the change.

       The `Add' and `Remove' buttons add and remove services.  Using the `Export' button it is possible to save
       a  set  of  services to a file.  These files can be imported using the `Import' button, so it is possible
       for users to share terminal services definitions.  The extension of the  file  should  be  `.svcs'.   The
       default  set  of services is such a file located in the application wrapper's resource directory.  If you
       import a service with the same name as an existing service, and they aren't identical, the new  one  will
       be renamed to avoid a conflict.

          <b>Name</b>
              This is the name of the service as it appears in the services menu.  By default, terminal services
              will  be  placed in a `Terminal' submenu of the Services menu, but you can override this by giving
              the name a leading `/'.  In this case, you can also use a second `/' to create your own  submenus.
              (gnustep-gui doesn't support submenus of submenus, though.)  Names must be unique.

          <b>Key</b>
              The  key  equivalent for this command, if any.  Note that if an application uses this key for some
              other menu entry, the key will activate that menu entry, not the service.

          <b>Command</b> <b>line</b>
              The command line.  It is passed to <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>, so any shell commands will  work,  and  arguments  may
              have  to  be  quoted.  A  `%p'  in  the command line will cause a prompt to be brought up when the
              service is run.  If input is to be placed on the command line, you can mark the place to put it at
              with `%s' (otherwise it will be appended to the command line).  You can use `%%'  to  get  a  real
              `%'.

          <b>Run</b> <b>in</b> <b>background/new</b> <b>window/idle</b> <b>window</b>
              If a service is set to run in the background, the command will have to complete before the service
              will  return, and the service can return output.  Otherwise, the command's output will appear in a
              window.  ``new window''  causes  a  completely  new  window  to  be  opened  (and  it  will  close
              automatically  when  the  command  is  completed  if  that option is set).  ``idle window'' causes
              Terminal to try to reuse an existing idle window.  If there is no such window it will open  a  new
              window (and that window won't close automatically).

          <b>Ignore/return</b> <b>output</b> <b>(only</b> <b>applies</b> <b>to</b> <b>background</b> <b>services)</b>
              If  set to ignore, the output of the command will be discarded.  Otherwise, it will be parsed to a
              string or a bunch of filenames, depending on the acceptable types.  The output is  assumed  to  be
              utf8 encoded.

          <b>No</b> <b>input/Input</b> <b>in</b> <b>stdin/Input</b> <b>on</b> <b>command</b> <b>line</b>
              If  set  to  `No  input', the service won't accept any input.  Otherwise it is necessary to select
              something to run it, and the selection will be either piped to the command (`in stdin') or  placed
              on the service's command line (either at the `%s' or at the end, see above). Input will be sent to
              the command utf8 encoded.

          <b>Accept</b> <b>types</b>
              Plain  text will be sent verbatim to the command.  A list of filenames (possibly just one) will be
              sent separated by ' ':s (if on the command line), or newlines (if in stdin).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Commands can be given on the command line which will be run in the newly opened shell window.

</pre><h4><b>EMULATION</b></h4><pre>
       The terminal emulation code is based on Linux's console code, and nearly all parts  of  it  are  handled.
       Thus,  the  TERM  environment  variable  is set to `linux'.  Additionally, `vt100', `vt220', `xterm', and
       others similar to these should mostly work.  To distinguish Terminal from a  `real'  linux  console,  the
       environment variable <b>TERM_PROGRAM</b> is set to GNUstep_Terminal.

       The xterm extensions for setting the window's title are also supported.  You set the title using:

       ' 33]'+0, 1, or 2+';'+the title+' 07'
       1 sets the miniwindow title, 2 sets the window title, and 0 sets both.

       Example (from Jeff Teunissen):

       export PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]2;Terminal - ${HOSTNAME}:${PWD}\007"'

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Terminal</b> sets the following environment variables:

       <b>TERM</b> Will be set to <b>linux</b>.

       <b>TERM_PROGRAM</b>
            Will be set to <b>GNUstep_Terminal</b>.

</pre><h4><b>LANGUAGES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Terminal</b>  speaks  English,  French,  German, Hungarian, Norwegian, Russian, Spanish, Italian, Swedish and
       Turkish.
