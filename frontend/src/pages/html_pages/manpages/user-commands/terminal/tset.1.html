</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <u><b>tset</b></u> <b>—</b> <b>initialization</b>
       This program initializes terminals.

       First, <b>tset</b> retrieves the current terminal mode settings for your terminal.  It does this by successively
       testing

       •   the standard error,

       •   standard output,

       •   standard input and

       •   ultimately “/dev/tty”

       to  obtain  terminal  settings.  Having retrieved these settings, <b>tset</b> remembers which file descriptor to
       use when updating settings.

       Next, <b>tset</b> determines the type of terminal that you are using.  This determination is  done  as  follows,
       using the first terminal type found.

       1. The <b>terminal</b> argument specified on the command line.

       2. The value of the <u>TERM</u> environment variable.

       3.  (BSD  systems  only.)  The  terminal  type  associated  with  the standard error output device in the
       <u>/etc/ttys</u> file.  (On System V hosts and systems using that convention, <u><a href="../man8/getty.8.html">getty</a></u>(8) does this job by  setting
       <u>TERM</u> according to the type passed to it by <u>/etc/inittab</u>.)

       4. The default terminal type, “unknown”, is not suitable for curses applications.

       If  the terminal type was not specified on the command-line, the <b>-m</b> option mappings are then applied; see
       subsection “Terminal Type Mapping”.  Then, if the terminal type begins with a question  mark  (“?”),  the
       user is prompted for confirmation of the terminal type.  An empty response confirms the type, or, another
       type  can  be  entered  to  specify a new type.  Once the terminal type has been determined, the terminal
       description for the terminal is retrieved.  If no terminal description is found for the type, the user is
       prompted for another terminal type.

       Once the terminal description is retrieved,

       •   if the “<b>-w</b>” option is enabled, <b>tset</b> may update the terminal's window size.

           If the window size cannot be obtained from the operating system, but  the  terminal  description  (or
           environment,  e.g., <u>LINES</u> and <u>COLUMNS</u> variables specify this), use this to set the operating system's
           notion of the window size.

       •   if the “<b>-c</b>” option is enabled, the backspace, interrupt and line kill characters  (among  many  other
           things) are set

       •   unless  the  “<b>-I</b>”  option  is  enabled,  the  terminal and tab <u>initialization</u> strings are sent to the
           standard error output, and, if the terminal device does not appear to be a pseudoterminal  (as  might
           be used by a terminal emulator program), <b>tset</b> waits one second in case a hardware reset was issued.

       •   Finally,  if  the  erase,  interrupt  and  line kill characters have changed, or are not set to their
           default values, their values are displayed to the standard error output.

   <u><b>reset</b></u> <b>—</b> <b>reinitialization</b>
       When invoked as <b>reset</b>, <b>tset</b> sets the terminal modes to “sane” values:

       •   sets canonical (“cooked”) and echo modes,

       •   turns off cbreak and raw modes,

       •   turns on newline translation and

       •   resets special input characters to their default values

       before doing the  terminal  initialization  described  above.   Also,  rather  than  using  the  terminal
       <u>initialization</u> strings, it uses the terminal <u>reset</u> strings.

       The <b>reset</b> command is useful after a program dies leaving a terminal in an abnormal state:

       •   you may have to type

               <u>&lt;LF&gt;</u><b>reset</b><u>&lt;LF&gt;</u>

           (the  line-feed  character is normally control-J) to get the terminal to work, as carriage-return may
           no longer work in the abnormal state.

       •   Also, the terminal will often not echo the command.

   <b>Setting</b> <b>the</b> <b>Environment</b>
       It is often desirable to enter the terminal type and information about the terminal's  capabilities  into
       the shell's environment.  This is done using the <b>-s</b> option.

       When  the  <b>-s</b> option is specified, the commands to enter the information into the shell's environment are
       written to the standard output.  If the <u>SHELL</u> environment variable ends in “csh”, the  commands  are  for
       <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1), otherwise, they are for <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1).  The <u>csh</u> commands set and unset the shell variable <b>noglob</b>, leaving
       it unset.  The following line in the <b>.login</b> or <b>.profile</b> files will initialize the environment correctly:

           eval `tset -s options ... `

   <b>Terminal</b> <b>Type</b> <b>Mapping</b>
       When  the  terminal is not hardwired into the system (or the current system information is incorrect) the
       terminal type derived from the <u>/etc/ttys</u> file or the <u>TERM</u> environment variable is often something generic
       like <b>network</b>, <b>dialup</b>, or <b>unknown</b>.  When <b>tset</b> is used in a startup script it is often desirable to provide
       information about the type of terminal used on such ports.

       The <b>-m</b> options maps from some set of conditions to a terminal type, that is, to tell <b>tset</b> “If I'm on this
       port at a particular speed, guess that I'm on that kind of terminal”.

       The argument to the <b>-m</b> option consists of an optional port type, an optional operator, an  optional  baud
       rate  specification,  an  optional  colon (“:”) character and a terminal type.  The port type is a string
       (delimited by either the operator or the colon character).  The operator may be any combination  of  “&gt;”,
       “&lt;”,  “@”,  and  “!”; “&gt;” means greater than, “&lt;” means less than, “@” means equal to and “!” inverts the
       sense of the test.  The baud rate is specified as a number and is compared with the speed of the standard
       error output (which should be the control terminal).  The terminal type is a string.

       If the terminal type is not specified on the command line, the <b>-m</b> mappings are applied  to  the  terminal
       type.   If  the  port  type  and  baud rate match the mapping, the terminal type specified in the mapping
       replaces the current type.  If more than one mapping is specified, the first applicable mapping is used.

       For example, consider the following mapping: <b>dialup&gt;9600:vt100</b>.  The port type is dialup ,  the  operator
       is &gt;, the baud rate specification is 9600, and the terminal type is vt100.  The result of this mapping is
       to  specify  that if the terminal type is <b>dialup</b>, and the baud rate is greater than 9600 baud, a terminal
       type of <b>vt100</b> will be used.

       If no baud rate is specified, the terminal type will match any baud rate.  If no port type is  specified,
       the  terminal  type  will  match  any  port type.  For example, <b>-m</b> <b>dialup:vt100</b> <b>-m</b> <b>:?xterm</b> will cause any
       dialup port, regardless of baud rate, to match the terminal type vt100, and any non-dialup port  type  to
       match  the terminal type ?xterm.  Note, because of the leading question mark, the user will be queried on
       a default port as to whether they are actually using an xterm terminal.

       No whitespace characters are permitted in the <b>-m</b> option argument.  Also, to  avoid  problems  with  meta-
       characters,  it is suggested that the entire <b>-m</b> option argument be placed within single quote characters,
       and that <u>csh</u> users insert a backslash character (“\”) before any exclamation marks (“!”).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The options are as follows:

       <b>-c</b>   Set control characters and modes.

       <b>-e</b> <u>ch</u>
            Set the erase character to <u>ch</u>.

       <b>-I</b>   Do not send the terminal or tab initialization strings to the terminal.

       <b>-i</b> <u>ch</u>
            Set the interrupt character to <u>ch</u>.

       <b>-k</b> <u>ch</u>
            Set the line kill character to <u>ch</u>.

       <b>-m</b> <u>mapping</u>
            Specify a mapping from a port type to a terminal; see subsection “Terminal Type Mapping”.

       <b>-Q</b>   Do not display any values for the erase, interrupt and line kill characters.  Normally <b>tset</b> displays
            the values for control characters which differ from the system's default values.

       <b>-q</b>   The terminal type is displayed to the standard output, and the terminal is not  initialized  in  any
            way.  The option “-” by itself is equivalent but archaic.

       <b>-r</b>   Print the terminal type to the standard error output.

       <b>-s</b>   Print  the  sequence  of  shell commands to initialize the environment variable <u>TERM</u> to the standard
            output; see subsection “Setting the Environment”.

       <b>-V</b>   reports the version of <u>ncurses</u> which was used in this program, and exits.

       <b>-w</b>   Resize the window to match the size deduced via <b><a href="../man3NCURSES/setupterm.3NCURSES.html">setupterm</a></b>(3NCURSES).  Normally this has  no  effect,
            unless <b>setupterm</b> is not able to detect the window size.

       The  arguments  for the <b>-e</b>, <b>-i</b>, and <b>-k</b> options may either be entered as actual characters or by using the
       “hat” notation, i.e., control-h may be specified as “^H” or “^h”.

       If neither <b>-c</b> or <b>-w</b> is given, both options are assumed.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>tset</b> command uses these environment variables:

       <u>SHELL</u>
            tells <b>tset</b> whether to initialize <u>TERM</u> using <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1) or <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1) syntax.

       <u>TERM</u> Denotes your terminal type.  Each terminal type is distinct, though many are similar.

       <u>TERMCAP</u>
            may denote the location of a termcap database.  If it is not an absolute pathname, e.g., begins with
            a “/”, <b>tset</b> removes the variable from the environment before looking for the terminal description.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/ttys</u>
              system port name to terminal type mapping database (BSD versions only).

       <u><a href="file:/etc/terminfo">/etc/terminfo</a></u>
              compiled terminal description database directory

</pre><h4><b>PORTABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Neither IEEE Std 1003.1/The Open Group Base  Specifications  Issue 7  (POSIX.1-2008)  nor  X/Open  Curses
       Issue 7 documents <b>tset</b> or <b>reset</b>.

       The  AT&amp;T  <b>tput</b>  utility  (AIX,  HP-UX,  Solaris)  incorporated the terminal-mode manipulation as well as
       termcap-based features such as resetting tabstops from <b>tset</b> in BSD (4.1c), presumably with the  intention
       of making <b>tset</b> obsolete.  However, each of those systems still provides <b>tset</b>.  In fact, the commonly-used
       <b>reset</b> utility is always an alias for <b>tset</b>.

       The  <b>tset</b>  utility  provides  backward  compatibility  with  BSD  environments; under most modern Unices,
       <u>/etc/inittab</u> and <u><a href="../man8/getty.8.html">getty</a></u>(8) can set <u>TERM</u> appropriately for each dial-up line,  obviating  what  was  <b>tset</b>'s
       most  important  use.   This  implementation  behaves  like  4.4BSD  <b>tset</b>, with a few exceptions we shall
       consider now.

       A few options are different because the <u>TERMCAP</u> variable is  no  longer  supported  under  terminfo-based
       <u>ncurses</u>:

       •   The <b>-S</b> option of BSD <b>tset</b> no longer works; it prints an error message to the standard error and dies.

       •   The <b>-s</b> option only sets <u>TERM</u>, not <u>TERMCAP</u>.

       There  was  an  undocumented  4.4BSD feature that invoking <b>tset</b> via a link named “TSET” (or via any other
       name beginning with an upper-case letter) set the terminal to use upper-case only.  This feature has been
       omitted.

       The <b>-A</b>, <b>-E</b>, <b>-h</b>, <b>-u</b> and <b>-v</b> options were deleted from the <b>tset</b>  utility  in  4.4BSD.   None  of  them  were
       documented  in  4.3BSD  and all are of limited utility at best.  The <b>-a</b>, <b>-d</b>, and <b>-p</b> options are similarly
       not documented or useful, but were retained as they appear to be  in  widespread  use.   It  is  strongly
       recommended  that  any usage of these three options be changed to use the <b>-m</b> option instead.  The <b>-a</b>, <b>-d</b>,
       and <b>-p</b> options are therefore omitted from the usage summary above.

       Very old systems, e.g., 3BSD, used a different terminal driver which was replaced in 4BSD  in  the  early
       1980s.   To  accommodate  these older systems, the 4BSD <b>tset</b> provided a <b>-n</b> option to specify that the new
       terminal driver should be used.  This implementation does not provide that choice.

       It is still permissible to specify the <b>-e</b>, <b>-i</b>, and <b>-k</b> options without arguments, although it is  strongly
       recommended that such usage be fixed to explicitly specify the character.

       As of 4.4BSD, executing <b>tset</b> as <b>reset</b> no longer implies the <b>-Q</b> option.  Also, the interaction between the
       - option and the <u>terminal</u> argument in some historic implementations of <b>tset</b> has been removed.

       The  <b>-c</b> and <b>-w</b> options are not found in earlier implementations.  However, a different window size-change
       feature was provided in 4.4BSD.

       •   In 4.4BSD, <b>tset</b> uses the window size from the termcap description to set the window size if  <b>tset</b>  is
           not able to obtain the window size from the operating system.

       •   In  <u>ncurses</u>,  <b>tset</b> obtains the window size using <b><a href="../man3NCURSES/setupterm.3NCURSES.html">setupterm</a></b>(3NCURSES), which may be from the operating
           system, the <u>LINES</u> and <u>COLUMNS</u> environment variables or the terminal description.

       Obtaining the window size from a terminal's type description  is  common  to  both  implementations,  but
       considered  obsolescent.   Its  only practical use is for hardware terminals.  Generally, the window size
       will remain uninitialized only if there were a problem obtaining the value from the operating system (and
       <b>setupterm</b> would still fail).  The <u>LINES</u> and <u>COLUMNS</u> environment variables may thus be useful for  working
       around  window-size  problems,  but have the drawback that if the window is resized, their values must be
       recomputed and reassigned.  The <u><a href="../man1/resize.1.html">resize</a></u>(1) program distributed with <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) assists this activity.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       A <b>reset</b> command written by Kurt Shoens appeared in  1BSD  (March  1978).   It  set  the  <u>erase</u>  and  <u>kill</u>
       characters to <b>^H</b> (backspace) and <b>@</b> respectively.  Mark Horton improved this <b>reset</b> in 3BSD (October 1979),
       adding  <u>intr</u>, <u>quit</u>, <u>start</u>/<u>stop</u>, and <u>eof</u> characters as well as changing the program to avoid modifying any
       user settings.  That version of <b>reset</b> did not use <u>termcap</u>.

       Eric Allman wrote a distinct <b>tset</b> command  for  1BSD,  using  a  forerunner  of  <u>termcap</u>  called  <u>ttycap</u>.
       Allman's  comments in the source code indicate that he began work in October 1977, continuing development
       over the next few years.  By late 1979, it had migrated to <u>termcap</u>  and  handled  the  <u>TERMCAP</u>  variable.
       Later  comments  indicate  that  <b>tset</b>  was  modified  in September 1980 to use logic copied from the 3BSD
       “reset” program when it was invoked as <b>reset</b>.  This version appeared in 4.1cBSD,  late  in  1982.   Other
       developers such as Keith Bostic and Jim Bloom continued to modify <b>tset</b> until 4.4BSD was released in 1993.

       The <u>ncurses</u> implementation was lightly adapted from the 4.4BSD sources to use the <u>terminfo</u> API by Eric S.
       Raymond &lt;<a href="mailto:esr@snark.thyrsus.com">esr@snark.thyrsus.com</a>&gt;.
