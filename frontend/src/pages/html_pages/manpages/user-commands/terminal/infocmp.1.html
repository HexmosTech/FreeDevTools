       <b>infocmp</b> - compare or print out <u>terminfo</u> descriptions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>infocmp</b>  [<b>-1cCdDeEFgGiIKlLnpqrtTuUVWx]</b>  [<b>-A</b> <u>directory</u>]  [<b>-B</b> <u>directory</u>] [<b>-Q</b> <u>encoding</u>] [<b>-R</b> <u>subset</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>key</u>]
              [<b>-v</b> <u>level</u>] [<b>-w</b> <u>width</u>] [<u>terminal-type</u> ... ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>infocmp</b> reports a human-readable terminal type description from a compiled entry in the <u>terminfo</u> database
       in a variety of selectable formats, compares such entries to each other, and rewrites an entry to replace
       “<b>use</b>” expressions with the content of other entries by reference.  A <u>terminfo</u>  <u>entry</u>  entry  comprises  a
       list  of  one or more terminal type identifiers, a human-readable description of the terminal type, and a
       list of terminal <u>capabilities</u> that characterize its programming interface.  In  all  cases,  the  program
       reports Boolean-valued capabilities first, followed by numeric ones, and then string-valued capabilities.

   <b>Default</b> <b>Options</b>
       If  no  options are specified and zero or one <u>terminal-types</u> is specified, <b>infocmp</b> assumes the <b>-I</b> option.
       If more than one is specified, the program assumes the <b>-d</b> option.

   <b>Source</b> <b>Listing</b> <b>Options</b> <b>[-I]</b> <b>[-L]</b> <b>[-C]</b> <b>[-r]</b>
       The <b>-I</b>, <b>-L</b>, and <b>-C</b> options will produce a source listing for each terminal named.

                                    <b>-I</b>   use <u>terminfo</u> capability codes
                                    <b>-L</b>   use “long” capability names
                                    <b>-C</b>   use <u>termcap</u> capability codes
                                    <b>-r</b>   with <b>-C</b>, include nonstandard capabilities
                                    <b>-K</b>   with <b>-C</b>, improve BSD compatibility

       If no <u>terminal-types</u> are given, the environment variable <u>TERM</u> will be used for the terminal name.

       The source produced by the <b>-C</b> option may be used directly as a <b>termcap</b> entry, but not  all  parameterized
       strings  can be changed to the <b>termcap</b> format.  <b>infocmp</b> will attempt to convert most of the parameterized
       information, and anything not converted will be plainly marked in the output and  commented  out.   These
       should be edited by hand.

       For  best  results  when converting to <b>termcap</b> format, you should use both <b>-C</b> and <b>-r</b>.  Normally a termcap
       description is limited to 1023 bytes.  <b>infocmp</b> trims away less essential parts to make it  fit.   If  you
       are  converting  to  one of the (rare) termcap implementations which accept an unlimited size of termcap,
       you may want to add the <b>-T</b> option.  More often however, you must help  the  termcap  implementation,  and
       trim excess whitespace (use the <b>-0</b> option for that).

       All  padding information for strings will be collected together and placed at the beginning of the string
       where <b>termcap</b> expects it.  Mandatory padding (padding  information  with  a  trailing  “/”)  will  become
       optional.

       All  <b>termcap</b>  variables  no  longer  supported  by  <b>terminfo</b>, but which are derivable from other <b>terminfo</b>
       variables, will be output.  Not all <b>terminfo</b> capabilities will be translated; only those variables  which
       were  part  of <b>termcap</b> will normally be output.  Specifying the <b>-r</b> option will take off this restriction,
       allowing all capabilities to be output in <u>termcap</u> form.  Normally you  would  use  both  the  <b>-C</b>  and  <b>-r</b>
       options.   The  actual  format  used  incorporates some improvements for escaped characters from terminfo
       format.  For a stricter BSD-compatible translation, use the <b>-K</b> option rather than <b>-C</b>.

       Note that because padding is collected to the beginning of  the  capability,  not  all  capabilities  are
       output.   Mandatory  padding  is  not  supported.  Because <b>termcap</b> strings are not as flexible, it is not
       always possible to convert a <b>terminfo</b> string capability into an equivalent <b>termcap</b> format.  A  subsequent
       conversion  of  the  <b>termcap</b>  file  back into <b>terminfo</b> format will not necessarily reproduce the original
       <b>terminfo</b> source.

       Some common <b>terminfo</b> parameter sequences, their  <b>termcap</b>  equivalents,  and  some  terminal  types  which
       commonly have such sequences, are:

   <b>Entry</b> <b>Comparison</b> <b>Options</b> <b>[-d]</b> <b>[-c]</b> <b>[-n]</b>
       Given  <b>-c</b>, <b>-d</b>, or <b>-n</b>, <b>infocmp</b> compares the <u>terminfo</u> description of the first specified <u>terminal-type</u> with
       those of each of the subsequent operands.  If fewer <u>terminal-types</u> than required are  specified,  <b>infocmp</b>
       uses the environment variable <u>TERM</u> in their place.

       If  a  capability  is  defined for only one terminal type, the value reported depends on the capability's
       type:

       •   <b>F</b> for missing Boolean variables

       •   <b>NULL</b> for missing integer or string variables

       The <b>-c</b> and <b>-d</b> options report string capability values between “'”  characters.   Use  the  <b>-q</b>  option  to
       distinguish <u>absent</u> and <u>canceled</u> capabilities; see <b><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></b>(5).

       The comparison option selects the form of report.

       <b>-d</b>   lists each capability that <u>differs</u> between two entries.  Each capability name is followed by “:” and
            comma-separated capability values, then a period.

       <b>-c</b>   lists  each  capability  that two entries have in <u>common</u>.  <b>infocmp</b> ignores capabilities missing from
            either entry.  Each capability name is followed by “=”, a space, and the capability  value,  then  a
            period.

            If  the <b>-u</b> option is further specified, <b>infocmp</b> rewrites the description of the first type employing
            “use=” syntax to use the second as a building block.

       <b>-n</b>   lists capabilities that are in <u>none</u> of the given entries.  Each capability name is preceded  by  “!”
            and followed by a period.

            Normally  only  conventional  capabilities  are  shown.   Use the <b>-x</b> option to add BSD-compatibility
            capabilities (names prefixed with “OT”).

   <b>Use=</b> <b>Option</b> <b>[-u]</b>
       The <b>-u</b> option produces a <b>terminfo</b> source  description  of  the  first  terminal  <u>terminal-type</u>  which  is
       relative  to the sum of the descriptions given by the entries for the other <u>terminal-types</u>.  It does this
       by analyzing the differences between the first <u>terminal-types</u> and the other <u>terminal-types</u> and  producing
       a  description  with  <b>use=</b>  fields  for  the other terminals.  In this manner, it is possible to retrofit
       generic terminfo entries into a terminal's description.  Or, if two similar  terminals  exist,  but  were
       coded  at  different  times  or by different people so that each description is a full description, using
       <b>infocmp</b> will show what can be done to change one description to be relative to the other.

       A capability will be printed with an at-sign (@) if it no longer exists in the first  <u>terminal-type</u>,  but
       one  of the other <u>terminal-type</u> entries contains a value for it.  A capability's value will be printed if
       the value in the first <u>terminal-type</u> is not found in any of the other <u>terminal-type</u> entries,  or  if  the
       first  of  the  other  <u>terminal-type</u>  entries  that  has  this capability gives a different value for the
       capability than that in the first <u>terminal-type</u>.

       The order of the other <u>terminal-type</u> entries is significant.  Since the  terminfo  compiler  <b>tic</b>  does  a
       left-to-right  scan  of  the capabilities, specifying two <b>use=</b> entries that contain differing entries for
       the same capabilities will produce different results depending on the order that the  entries  are  given
       in.   <b>infocmp</b>  will  flag  any  such  inconsistencies between the other <u>terminal-type</u> entries as they are
       found.

       Alternatively, specifying a capability <u>after</u> a <b>use=</b> entry that contains that capability  will  cause  the
       second  specification  to  be  ignored.  Using <b>infocmp</b> to recreate a description can be a useful check to
       make sure that everything was specified correctly in the original source description.

       Another error that does not cause incorrect compiled files, but will slow down the compilation  time,  is
       specifying extra <b>use=</b> fields that are superfluous.  <b>infocmp</b> will flag any other <u>terminal-type</u> <u>use=</u> fields
       that were not needed.

   <b>Changing</b> <b>Databases</b> <b>[-A</b> <u><b>directory</b></u><b>]</b> <b>[-B</b> <u><b>directory</b></u><b>]</b>
       Like other <u>ncurses</u> utilities, <b>infocmp</b> looks for the terminal descriptions in several places.  You can use
       the  <u>TERMINFO</u>  and <u>TERMINFO_DIRS</u> environment variables to override the compiled-in default list of places
       to search.  See <b><a href="../man3NCURSES/ncurses.3NCURSES.html">ncurses</a></b>(3NCURSES), as well as the <u>Fetching</u> <u>Compiled</u> <u>Descriptions</u> section in <b><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></b>(5).

       You can also use the options <b>-A</b> and <b>-B</b> to override the list of places to search when  comparing  terminal
       descriptions:

       •   The <b>-A</b> option sets the location for the first <u>terminal-type</u>

       •   The <b>-B</b> option sets the location for the other <u>terminal-types</u>.

       Using  these options, it is possible to compare descriptions for a terminal with the same name located in
       two different databases.  For instance, you can use this feature for comparing descriptions for the  same
       terminal created by different people.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-0</b>   causes the fields to be printed on one line, without wrapping.

       <b>-1</b>   causes the fields to be printed out one to a line.  Otherwise, the fields will be printed several to
            a line to a maximum width of 60 characters.

       <b>-a</b>   tells  <b>infocmp</b>  to  retain commented-out capabilities rather than discarding them.  Capabilities are
            commented by prefixing them with a period.

       <b>-D</b>   tells <b>infocmp</b> to print the database locations that it knows about, and exit.

       <b>-E</b>   Dump the capabilities of the given terminal as tables, needed in the C initializer  for  a  TERMTYPE
            structure  (the terminal capability structure in the <b>&lt;term.h&gt;</b>).  This option is useful for preparing
            versions of the curses library hardwired for a given terminal type.  The  tables  are  all  declared
            static, and are named according to the type and the name of the corresponding terminal entry.

            Before <u>ncurses</u> 5.0, the split between the <b>-e</b> and <b>-E</b> options was not needed; but support for extended
            names required making the arrays of terminal capabilities separate from the TERMTYPE structure.

       <b>-e</b>   Dump  the  capabilities  of  the  given  terminal  as  a C initializer for a TERMTYPE structure (the
            terminal capability structure in the <b>&lt;term.h&gt;</b>).  This option is useful for preparing versions of the
            curses library hardwired for a given terminal type.

       <b>-F</b>   compare terminfo files.  This assumes that two following arguments are  filenames.   The  files  are
            searched  for pairwise matches between entries, with two entries considered to match if any of their
            names do.  The report printed to standard output lists entries with no matches in  the  other  file,
            and  entries  with more than one match.  For entries with exactly one match it includes a difference
            report.  Normally, to reduce the volume of the  report,  use  references  are  not  resolved  before
            looking for differences, but resolution can be forced by also specifying <b>-r</b>.

       <b>-f</b>   Display   complex  terminfo  strings  which  contain  if/then/else/endif  expressions  indented  for
            readability.

       <b>-G</b>   Display constant literals in decimal form rather than their character equivalents.

       <b>-g</b>   Display constant character literals in quoted form rather than their decimal equivalents.

       <b>-i</b>   Analyze the initialization (<b>is1</b>, <b>is2</b>, <b>is3</b>), and reset (<b>rs1</b>, <b>rs2</b>, <b>rs3</b>), strings in the entry, as well
            as  those  used  for  starting/stopping  cursor-positioning  mode  (<b>smcup</b>,   <b>rmcup</b>)   as   well   as
            starting/stopping keymap mode (<b>smkx</b>, <b>rmkx</b>).

            For each string, the code tries to analyze it into actions in terms of the other capabilities in the
            entry, certain X3.64/ISO 6429/ECMA-48 capabilities, and certain DEC VT-series private modes (the set
            of  recognized  special  sequences  has  been  selected  for completeness over the existing terminfo
            database).  Each report line consists of the  capability  name,  followed  by  a  colon  and  space,
            followed by a printable expansion of the capability string with sections matching recognized actions
            translated into {}-bracketed descriptions.

            Here is a list of the DEC/ANSI special sequences recognized:

       It  also  recognizes  a  SGR  action corresponding to ANSI/ISO 6429/ECMA Set Graphics Rendition, with the
       values NORMAL, BOLD, UNDERLINE, BLINK, and REVERSE.  All but NORMAL may be prefixed with

              •   “+” (turn on) or

              •   “-” (turn off).

              An SGR0 designates an empty highlight sequence (equivalent to {SGR:NORMAL}).

       <b>-l</b>   Set output format to terminfo.

       <b>-p</b>   Ignore padding specifications when comparing strings.

       <b>-Q</b> <u>n</u> Rather than show source in terminfo (text) format, print the compiled (binary) format in hexadecimal
            or base64 form, depending on the option's value:

               1  hexadecimal

               2  base64

               3  hexadecimal and base64

            For example, this prints the compiled terminfo value as a string which  could  be  assigned  to  the
            <u>TERMINFO</u> environment variable:

                infocmp -0 -q -Q2

       <b>-q</b>   This makes the output a little shorter:

            •   Make  the  comparison  listing  shorter  by  omitting  subheadings,  and  using  “-”  for absent
                capabilities, “@” for canceled rather than “NULL”.

            •   However, show differences between absent and canceled capabilities.

            •   Omit the “Reconstructed from” comment for source listings.

       <b>-R</b><u>subset</u>
            Restrict output to a given subset.  This option is for use with archaic versions  of  terminfo  like
            those  on  SVr1,  Ultrix, or HP-UX that do not support the full set of SVR4/XSI Curses terminfo; and
            variants such as AIX that have their own extensions incompatible with SVr4/XSI.

            •   Available terminfo subsets are “SVr1”, “Ultrix”, “HP”, and “AIX”; see <b><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></b>(5) for details.

            •   You can also choose the subset “BSD” which selects only capabilities  with  termcap  equivalents
                recognized by 4.4BSD.

            •   If  you  select  any other value for <b>-R</b>, it is the same as no subset, i.e., all capabilities are
                used.

            A few options override the subset selected with <b>-R</b>, if they  are  processed  later  in  the  command
            parameters:

            <b>-C</b>   sets the “BSD” subset as a side-effect.

            <b>-I</b>   sets the subset to all capabilities.

            <b>-r</b>   sets the subset to all capabilities.

       <b>-s</b> <u>[d|i|l|c]</u>
            The <b>-s</b> option sorts the fields within each type according to the argument below:

            <b>d</b>    leave fields in the order that they are stored in the <u>terminfo</u> database.

            <b>i</b>    sort by <u>terminfo</u> name.

            <b>l</b>    sort by the long C variable name.

            <b>c</b>    sort by the <u>termcap</u> name.

            If  the <b>-s</b> option is not given, the fields printed out will be sorted alphabetically by the <b>terminfo</b>
            name within each type, except in the case of the <b>-C</b> or the <b>-L</b> options, which cause the sorting to be
            done by the <b>termcap</b> name or the long C variable name, respectively.

       <b>-T</b>   eliminates size-restrictions on the generated text.  This is mainly useful for testing and analysis,
            since the compiled descriptions are limited (e.g., 1023 for termcap, 4096 for terminfo).

       <b>-t</b>   tells <b>tic</b> to discard  commented-out  capabilities.   Normally  when  translating  from  terminfo  to
            termcap, untranslatable capabilities are commented-out.

       <b>-U</b>   tells  <b>infocmp</b>  to not post-process the data after parsing the source file.  This feature helps when
            comparing the actual contents of two source files, since it excludes  the  inferences  that  <b>infocmp</b>
            makes to fill in missing data.

       <b>-V</b>   reports the version of <u>ncurses</u> which was used in this program, and exits.

       <b>-v</b> <u>n</u> prints out tracing information on standard error as the program runs.

            The optional parameter <u>n</u> is a number from 1 to 10, inclusive, indicating the desired level of detail
            of information.  If <u>ncurses</u> is built without tracing support, the optional parameter is ignored.

       <b>-W</b>   By itself, the <b>-w</b> option will not force long strings to be wrapped.  Use the <b>-W</b> option to do this.

       <b>-w</b> <u>width</u>
            changes the output to <u>width</u> characters.

       <b>-x</b>   print  information  for  user-defined  capabilities  (see <b><a href="../man5/user_caps.5.html">user_caps</a></b>(5).  These are extensions to the
            terminfo repertoire which can be loaded using the <b>-x</b> option of <b>tic</b>.

       extensions.

</pre><h4><b>PORTABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       X/Open  Curses  Issue 7 (2009) specifies <u>infocmp</u>.  It does not mention options for producing descriptions
       in <u>termcap</u> format.

       SVr4 <u>infocmp</u> does not distinguish between absent  and  canceled  capabilities.   It  furthermore  reports
       missing  integer  capabilities  as  <b>-1</b>  (its internal representation).  <u>ncurses</u> shows these as “NULL” for
       consistency with missing string capabilities.

       The <b>-r</b> option of <u>ncurses</u> <u>infocmp</u> uses SVr4's notion of “termcap” capabilities.  BSD  <u>curses</u>  had  a  more
       restricted set.  To see only those present in 4.4BSD, use “<b>-r</b> <b>-RBSD</b>”.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       Although  System  V  Release 2 provided a terminfo library, it had no documented tool for decompiling the
       terminal descriptions.  Tony Hansen (AT&amp;T) wrote the first <b>infocmp</b> in early 1984, for System V Release 3.

       Eric Raymond used the AT&amp;T documentation in 1995 to  provide  an  equivalent  <b>infocmp</b>  for  <u>ncurses</u>.   In
       addition, he added a few new features such as:

       •   the <b>-e</b> option, to support <u>fallback</u> (compiled-in) terminal descriptions

       •   the <b>-i</b> option, to help with analysis

       Later,  Thomas  Dickey  added  the  <b>-x</b>  (user-defined  capabilities) option, and the <b>-E</b> option to support
       fallback entries with user-defined capabilities.

       For a complete list, see the <u>EXTENSIONS</u> section.

       In 2010, Roy Marples provided an <b>infocmp</b> program for NetBSD.  It is less capable than the SVr4 or <u>ncurses</u>
       versions (e.g., it lacks the sorting options documented in  X/Open),  but  does  include  the  <b>-x</b>  option
       adapted from <u>ncurses</u>.
