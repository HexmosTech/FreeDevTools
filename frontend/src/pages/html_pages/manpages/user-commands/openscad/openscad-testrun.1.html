</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       openscad-testrun - set up and run the OpenSCAD test suite

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>openscad-testrun</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>openscad-testrun</b> command.

       <b>openscad-testrun</b>  is  a  script that sets up a directory in which the OpenSCAD test suite (implemented in
       ctest) can be run by creating symlinks to the system locations of  the  input  data,  and  runs  it.  The
       created directory is not removed, but will contain the test results in addition to the symlinks.

       It  is  required  as  the  test  suite in its original form expects all the test input and output data in
       relative locations, and the typical user has no write access to where the data resides. Future changes to
       the test suite might make it more flexible, removing the need for this script.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b> <u>directory</u>, <b>--directory</b> <u>directory</u>
              Set up the tests in a directory called <u>directory</u>. By default, this is generated from  the  current
              date and time like <b>openscad-test-2012-02-15_13_37</b>.

       <b>-j</b> <u>N</u>, <b>--parallel</b> <u>N</u>
              Run  <u>N</u>  test  jobs  in  parallel.  This  can  also  be set in the <b>CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL</b> environment
              variable. The default is to run  as  many  jobs  as  the  number  of  available  processing  units
              available, as returned by <u><a href="../man1/nproc.1.html">nproc</a></u>(1).

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>
              Do not run the test suite, just set it up.

       <b>--virtual</b>
              Use <u>xvfb-run</u> to execute the tests inside a virtual X server.

       All additional arguments are passed on to ctest.
