</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dnsviz-grok - assess diagnostic DNS queries

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dnsviz</b> <b>grok</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>domain_name...</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Process  the  results  of  diagnostic  DNS  queries previously performed, e.g., using <b><a href="../man1/dnsviz-probe.1.html">dnsviz-probe</a>(1)</b>, to
       assess the health of the associated DNS deployments for one or more domain names specified.  The  results
       of this processing are serialized into JSON format for further programmatic diagnostics or alerts.

       The source of the diagnostic query input is either a file specified with <b>-r</b> or standard input.

       Domain  names  to  be  processed  may be passed either as command-line arguments, in a file (using the <b>-f</b>
       option), or simply implied using the diagnostic query input.  The latter  is  the  preferred  methodology
       (and  the  simplest)  and  is  useful,  except  in  cases where the input contains diagnostic queries for
       multiple domain names, only a subset of which are to be processed.

       If <b>-f</b> is not used and no domain names are supplied on the command line,  then  the  domain  names  to  be
       processed are extracted from the diagnostic query input.  If the <b>-f</b> option is used, then names may not be
       specified on the command line.

       The  domain names passed as input are fully-qualified domain names, such as example.com, www.example.com,
       _443._tcp.example.com, 1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa, or 8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.  Because it is  implied  that
       specified domain names are fully qualified, no trailing dot is necessary.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f,</b> <b>--names-file</b> <u>filename</u>
              Read names from a file (one name per line), instead of from command line.

              If this option is used, then names may not be specified on the command line.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--input-file</b> <u>filename</u>
              Read diagnostic query input from the specified file, instead of from standard input.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--trusted-keys-file</b> <u>filename</u>
              Use  trusted  keys from the specified file when processing diagnostic queries.  This overrides the
              default behavior of using the installed keys for the root zone.

              The format of this file is master  zone  file  format  and  should  contain  DNSKEY  records  that
              correspond to one more trusted keys for one or more DNS zones.

              This option may be used multiple times on the command line.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--algorithms</b> <u>alg</u>[,<u>alg...]</u>
              Support  only  the  DNSSEC  algorithms  specified.   If  this  option  is used, any algorithms not
              specified will appear as  "unsupported."   The  status  of  any  RRSIG  records  corresponding  to
              unsupported  algorithms  will  be  unknown.   Additionally,  when  a zone has only DS records with
              unsupported algorithms, the zone is treated as "insecure", assuming the DS  records  are  properly
              authenticated.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--digest-algorithms</b> <u>digest_alg</u>[,<u>digest_alg...]</u>
              Support  only  the  DNSSEC  digest  algorithms  specified.   If  this  option  is used, any digest
              algorithms not specified will appear as "unsupported."  The status of any DS records corresponding
              to unsupported digest algorithms will be unknown.  Additionally, when a zone has only  DS  records
              with unsupported digest algorithms, the zone is treated as "insecure", assuming the DS records are
              properly authenticated.

       <b>--ignore-rfc8624</b>
              Ignore  errors  associated  with RFC 8624, DNSSEC algorithm implementation requirements.  RFC 8624
              designates some DNSSEC signing algorithms and some DS digest algorithms as prohibited ("MUST NOT")
              or not recommended for validation and/or signing.  If this option is used, then no  warnings  will
              be issued, and the code will still assess their cryptographic status, rather than ignoring them.

       <b>--ignore-rfc9276</b>
              Ignore  errors  associated  with  RFC  9276, NSEC3 parameter settings.  RFC 9276 specifies that if
              NSEC3 is used, the iterations count must be 0 and the salt length must be 0.  If  this  option  is
              used, then no warnings will be issued for NSEC3 records that violate this specification.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>--enforce-cookies</b>
              Enforce  DNS  cookies  strictly.  Require  a  server to return a "BADCOOKIE" response when a query
              contains a COOKIE option with no server cookie or with an invalid server cookie.

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--allow-private</b>
              Allow private IP addresses  for  authoritative  DNS  servers.   By  default,  if  the  IP  address
              corresponding  to  an  authoritative  server is in IP address space designated as "private", it is
              flagged as an error.  However, there are some cases where this is allowed.  For  example,  if  the
              diagnostic  queries  are  issued  to  servers  in  an  experimental  environment,  this  might  be
              permissible.

       <b>--trust-cdnskey-cds</b>
              Trust all CDNSKEY and CDS records, even if they are not "signed with a key that is represented  in
              both the current DNSKEY and DS RRsets" (RFC 7344).  This is allowed if "the Parent uses the CDS or
              CDNSKEY  RRset  for initial enrollment; in that case, the Parent validates the CDS/CDNSKEY through
              some other means" (RFC 7344).  Because there is no way for  DNSViz  to  discover  the  out-of-band
              means  with  which  the  parent might have validated the CDNSKEY and/or CDS records, this trust is
              signaled with the use of the <b>--trust-cdnskey-cds</b> command-line option.

       <b>--multi-signer</b>
              Don't issue errors for missing KSKs with DS RRs.  Typically an error is issued if a  given  DNSKEY
              is not found in the DNSKEY RRset returned by one or more servers.  If <b>--multi-signer</b> is specified,
              then  no  error  is  issued,  in  the case that 1) the DNSKEY is not signing any non-DNSKEY RRsets
              (i.e., is a zone-signing key or ZSK) and 2) the DNSKEY corresponds to a DS record in  the  parent.
              This corresponds to the Model 2 use case in RFC 8901.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--output-file</b> <u>filename</u>
              Write the output to the specified file instead of to standard output, which is the default.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--minimize-output</b>
              Format JSON output minimally instead of "pretty" (i.e., with indentation and newlines).

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--log-level</b> <u>level</u>
              Display  only  information  at  the specified log priority or higher.  Valid values (in increasing
              order of priority) are: "error", "warning", "info", and "debug".  The default is "debug".

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display the usage and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       The exit codes are:

       0      Program terminated normally.

       1      Incorrect usage.

       2      Required package dependencies were not found.

       3      There was an error processing the input or saving the output.

       4      Program execution was interrupted, or an unknown error occurred.
