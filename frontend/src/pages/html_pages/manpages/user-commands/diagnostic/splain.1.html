</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       diagnostics, splain - produce verbose warning diagnostics

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Using the "diagnostics" pragma:

           use diagnostics;
           use diagnostics -verbose;

           diagnostics-&gt;enable;
           diagnostics-&gt;disable;

       Using the "splain" standalone filter program:

           perl program 2&gt;diag.out
           splain [-v] [-p] diag.out

       Using diagnostics to get stack traces from a misbehaving script:

           perl -Mdiagnostics=-traceonly my_script.pl

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>The</b> <b>"diagnostics"</b> <b>Pragma</b>
       This module extends the terse diagnostics normally emitted by both the perl compiler and the perl
       interpreter (from running perl with a -w switch or "use warnings"), augmenting them with the more
       explicative and endearing descriptions found in perldiag.  Like the other pragmata, it affects the
       compilation phase of your program rather than merely the execution phase.

       To use in your program as a pragma, merely invoke

           use diagnostics;

       at the start (or near the start) of your program.  (Note that this <u>does</u> enable perl's <b>-w</b> flag.)  Your
       whole compilation will then be subject(ed :-) to the enhanced diagnostics.  These still go out <b>STDERR</b>.

       Due to the interaction between runtime and compiletime issues, and because it's probably not a very good
       idea anyway, you may not use "no diagnostics" to turn them off at compiletime.  However, you may control
       their behaviour at runtime using the disable() and enable() methods to turn them off and on respectively.

       The <b>-verbose</b> flag first prints out the perldiag introduction before any other diagnostics.  The
       $diagnostics::PRETTY variable can generate nicer escape sequences for pagers.

       Warnings dispatched from perl itself (or more accurately, those that match descriptions found in
       perldiag) are only displayed once (no duplicate descriptions).  User code generated warnings a la <b>warn()</b>
       are unaffected, allowing duplicate user messages to be displayed.

       This module also adds a stack trace to the error message when perl dies.  This is useful for pinpointing
       what caused the death.  The <b>-traceonly</b> (or just <b>-t</b>) flag turns off the explanations of warning messages
       leaving just the stack traces.  So if your script is dieing, run it again with

         perl -Mdiagnostics=-traceonly my_bad_script

       to see the call stack at the time of death.  By supplying the <b>-warntrace</b> (or just <b>-w</b>) flag, any warnings
       emitted will also come with a stack trace.

   <b>The</b> <u><b>splain</b></u> <b>Program</b>
       Another program, <u>splain</u> is actually nothing more than a link to the (executable) <u>diagnostics.pm</u> module,
       as well as a link to the <u>diagnostics.pod</u> documentation.  The <b>-v</b> flag is like the "use diagnostics
       -verbose" directive.  The <b>-p</b> flag is like the $diagnostics::PRETTY variable.  Since you're post-
       processing with <u>splain</u>, there's no sense in being able to <b>enable()</b> or <b>disable()</b> processing.

       Output from <u>splain</u> is directed to <b>STDOUT</b>, unlike the pragma.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following file is certain to trigger a few errors at both runtime and compiletime:

           use diagnostics;
           print NOWHERE "nothing\n";
           print STDERR "\n\tThis message should be unadorned.\n";
           warn "\tThis is a user warning";
           print "\nDIAGNOSTIC TESTER: Please enter a &lt;CR&gt; here: ";
           my $a, $b = scalar &lt;STDIN&gt;;
           print "\n";
           print $x/$y;

       If you prefer to run your program first and look at its problem afterwards, do this:

           perl -w test.pl 2&gt;test.out
           ./splain &lt; test.out

       Note that this is not in general possible in shells of more dubious heritage, as the theoretical

           (perl -w test.pl &gt;/dev/tty) &gt;&amp; test.out
           ./splain &lt; test.out

       Because you just moved the existing <b>stdout</b> to somewhere else.

       If you don't want to modify your source code, but still have on-the-fly warnings, do this:

           exec 3&gt;&amp;1; perl -w test.pl 2&gt;&amp;1 1&gt;&amp;3 3&gt;&amp;- | splain 1&gt;&amp;2 3&gt;&amp;-

       Nifty, eh?

       If you want to control warnings on the fly, do something like this.  Make sure you do the "use" first, or
       you won't be able to get at the <b>enable()</b> or <b>disable()</b> methods.

           use diagnostics; # checks entire compilation phase
               print "\ntime for 1st bogus diags: SQUAWKINGS\n";
               print BOGUS1 'nada';
               print "done with 1st bogus\n";

           diagnostics-&gt;disable; # only turns off runtime warnings
               print "\ntime for 2nd bogus: (squelched)\n";
               print BOGUS2 'nada';
               print "done with 2nd bogus\n";

           diagnostics-&gt;enable; # turns back on runtime warnings
               print "\ntime for 3rd bogus: SQUAWKINGS\n";
               print BOGUS3 'nada';
               print "done with 3rd bogus\n";

           diagnostics-&gt;disable;
               print "\ntime for 4th bogus: (squelched)\n";
               print BOGUS4 'nada';
               print "done with 4th bogus\n";

</pre><h4><b>INTERNALS</b></h4><pre>
       Diagnostic messages derive from the <u>perldiag.pod</u> file when available at runtime.  Otherwise, they may be
       embedded in the file itself when the splain package is built.   See the <u>Makefile</u> for details.

       If an extant $SIG{__WARN__} handler is discovered, it will continue to be honored, but only after the
       <b>diagnostics::splainthis()</b> function (the module's $SIG{__WARN__} interceptor) has had its way with your
       warnings.

       There is a $diagnostics::DEBUG variable you may set if you're desperately curious what sorts of things
       are being intercepted.

           BEGIN { $diagnostics::DEBUG = 1 }

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Not being able to say "no diagnostics" is annoying, but may not be insurmountable.

       The "-pretty" directive is called too late to affect matters.  You have to do this instead, and <u>before</u>
       you load the module.

           BEGIN { $diagnostics::PRETTY = 1 }

       I could start up faster by delaying compilation until it should be needed, but this gets a "panic:
       top_level" when using the pragma form in Perl 5.001e.

       While it's true that this documentation is somewhat subserious, if you use a program named <u>splain</u>, you
       should expect a bit of whimsy.
