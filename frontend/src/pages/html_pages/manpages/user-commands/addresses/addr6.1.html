       addr6 - An IPv6 address analysis and manipulation tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>addr6</b>  [<b>-a</b>  <u>IPV6_ADDR</u> -i]  [<b>-d</b>]  [<b>-d</b>]  [<b>-q</b>]  [<b>-s</b>]  [<b>-j</b> <u>PREFIX</u>] [<b>-b</b> <u>TYPE</u>] [<b>-k</b> <u>SCOPE</u>] [<b>-w</b> <u>UNICAST_TYPE</u>] [<b>-g</b>
       <u>IID_TYPE</u>] [<b>-J</b> <u>PREFIX</u>] [<b>-B</b> <u>TYPE</u>] [<b>-K</b> <u>SCOPE</u>] [<b>-W</b> <u>UNICAST_TYPE</u>] [<b>-G</b> <u>IID_TYPE</u>] [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-h</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>addr6</b> is an IPv6 address analysis tool tool. It can employed identify the address type/scope,  and  infer
       the  type  of  Interface  ID employed by an IPv6 address. Additionally, <b>addr6</b> can also produce statistics
       about a set of IPv6 addresses.

       <b>addr6</b> can filter lists of IPv6 addresses based on a number of  criteria  (address  type,  address  scope,
       prefixes,  duplicate  addresses,  etc.).  There  are  two  types  of filters: "block filters" and "accept
       filters". If any "block filter" is specified, and IPv6 addresses matching any of those  filters  will  be
       discarded.  If  any  "accept filter" is specified, any IPv6 address matching that filter will be accepted
       (and printed on stdout).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>addr6</b> takes its parameters as command-line options. Each of the options can be  specified  with  a  short
       name  (one  character  preceded  with  the  hyphen character, as e.g. "-i") or with a long name (a string
       preceded with two hyphen characters, as e.g. "--stdin").

       <b>-a</b> <u>IPV6_ADDRESS</u><b>,</b> <b>--address</b> <u>IPV6_ADDRESS</u>

              This option ca be employed to specify a single IPv6 address that is meant to be processed  by  the
              tool.  This  option  is  typically  employed in conjunction with the '-d' tool, to decode the IPv6
              address in question.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--stdin</b>

              This option request the tool to read IPv6 addresses from standard  input  (stdin),  until  an  EOF
              (End-Of-File) condition is found.

       <b>-j</b> <u>PREFIX</u><b>,</b> <b>--accept</b> <u>PREFIX</u>

              Accept IPv6 addresses belonging to the specified IPv6 prefix (PREFIX/LEN).

       <b>-b</b> <u>TYPE</u><b>,</b> <b>--accept-type</b> <u>TYPE</u>

                * global

       <b>-G</b> <u>IPV6_ADDRESS</u><b>,</b> <b>--block-iid</b> <u>IID_TYPE</u>

              Block  unicast IPv6 addresses with an Interface ID of the specified type. Valid Interface ID types
              are:

                * ieee
                * isatap
                * ipv4-32
                * ipv4-64
                * ipv4-all
                * embed-port
                * embed-port-rev
                * embed-port-all
                * low-byte
                * byte-pattern
                * random

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--print-unique</b>

              This option causes the tool to eliminate duplicate addresses from the list of IPv6 addresses  read
              from  standard input (stdin). That is, when reading a list of addresses from stdin, only the first
              "copy" of each address will be processed by the tool (with later ones being simply ignored).

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--print-canonic</b>

              This option request the tool to print the IPv6 address specfied with the '-a' option (or a list of
              addresses read froom stdin if the '-i' option was set) in its canonic  form.  This  is  useful  to
              before  comparing textual representations of IPv6 addresses, since the same address can usually be
              written in multiple different ways.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--print-decode</b>

              This option request the tool to decode the IPv6 address specfied with the '-a' option (or  a  list
              of  addresses  read  froom  stdin  if  the  '-i'  option was set). The current version of the tool
              supports only decode type, in which information is printed for each  address  with  the  following
              syntax:

                      AddressType=AddressSubtype=Scope=IIDType=IIDSubtype

              This  simple  syntax  is meant to be easy for scripting purposes. Future versions of the tool will
              incorporate a human-friendly mode.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--print-stats</b>

              This option requests the tool to produce address statistics from the list of IPv6  addresses  read
              from  standard  input.  This  option should be used in conjunction with the '-i' option, such that
              multiple addresses can be given as input to addr6.

              addr6 will always print the total number of IPv6  addresses  that  have  been  examined,  and  the
              percentage  of unicast, multicast, and unspecified (::) addresses. If at least one unicast address
              is identified, unicast-specific statistics will be printed. In the  same  way,  if  at  least  one
              multicast address is identified, then multicast-specific statistics will be printed.

              Unicast-specific statistics include:

                1) Number and percentage of each unicast address type (global
                   unicast, link-local unicast, 6to4, Teredo, etc.).

                2) Number and percentage of each of the different Interface
                   ID types (IEEE-based, low-byte, etc.).

              Only those unicast address types for which there are multiple possible types of Interface-IDs will
              be considered for the Interface-ID assessment. Namely,

                * 6to4
                * Global Unicast
                * Link-local Unicast
                * Site-local unicast addresses (deprecated)
                * Unique local unicast addresses

              Unicast  address  types  such  as  'Teredo' are not considered by this analysis, since they have a
              single type of Interface-ID, as specified by the corresponding specifications.

              Multicast-specific statistics include:

                1) Number of addresses and percentage of each multicast
                   address type (Permanent, Embedded-RP, etc).

                2) Number addresses and percentage of each of the multicast
                   address scope different Interface ID types (Link, Interfa-
                   ce, Global, etc.)

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>

              This option selects the "verbosity" of the tool. If this option is left unspecified, only  minimum
              information is printed.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>

              Print help information for the <b>addr6</b> tool.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following sections illustrate typical use cases of the <b>addr6</b> tool.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#1</b>

       $ cat addresslist.txt | addr6 -i -q

       addr6  will  read IPv6 addresses from stdin ('-i' option), and will only print the first instance of each
       address ('-q' option), thus effectively removing any duplicates from the list.

           Note: In this particular scenario, the address list results
           from the command 'cat addresslist.txt', that has its output
           redirected to the standard input of the addr6 tool.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#2</b>

       $ addr6 -a fc00::1

       Decode the IPv6 address specified with the '-a' option. Note that while the '-d' option was not set, this
       is the default behavior of the tool (unless overridden y another option).

       <b>Example</b> <b>#3</b>

       $ cat addresslist.txt | addr6 -i -q -s

       addr6 will read IPv6 addresses from stdin ('-i' option), will ignore duplicate addresses  ('-q'  option),
       and will print statistics about the processed IPv6 addresses.

           Note: In this particular scenario, the address list results
           from the command 'cat addresslist.txt', that has its output
           redirected to the standard input of the addr6 tool.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#4</b>

       $ cat addresslist.txt | addr6 -i -q -d

       addr6  will  read IPv6 addresses from stdin ('-i' option), will ignore duplicate addresses ('-q' option),
       and will decode each of the remaining addresses.

           Note: In this particular scenario, the address list results
           from the command 'cat addresslist.txt', that has its output
           redirected to the standard input of the addr6 tool.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#5</b>

       $ cat addresslist.txt | addr6 -i -j 2001:db8::/16

       addr6 will read IPv6 addresses from stdin ('-i' option), will discard any addresses that do not belong to
       the prefix 2001:db8::/16 (i.e., it will "accept" addresses belonging to such prefix).

           Note: In this particular scenario, the address list results
           from the command 'cat addresslist.txt', that has its output
           redirected to the standard input of the addr6 tool.
