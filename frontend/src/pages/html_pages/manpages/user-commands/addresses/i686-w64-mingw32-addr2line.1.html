                 [addr addr ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>addr2line</b> translates addresses or symbol+offset into file names and line numbers.  Given an address or
       symbol+offset in an executable or an offset in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the debugging
       information to figure out which file name and line number are associated with it.

       The executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the <b>-e</b> option.  The default is the file
       <u>a.out</u>.  The section in the relocatable object to use is specified with the <b>-j</b> option.

       <b>addr2line</b> has two modes of operation.

       In the first, hexadecimal addresses or symbol+offset are specified on the command line, and <b>addr2line</b>
       displays the file name and line number for each address.

       In the second, <b>addr2line</b> reads hexadecimal addresses or symbol+offset from standard input, and prints the
       file name and line number for each address on standard output.  In this mode, <b>addr2line</b> may be used in a
       pipe to convert dynamically chosen addresses.

       The format of the output is <b>FILENAME:LINENO</b>.  By default each input address generates one line of output.

       Two options can generate additional lines before each <b>FILENAME:LINENO</b> line (in that order).

       If the <b>-a</b> option is used then a line with the input address is displayed.

       If the <b>-f</b> option is used, then a line with the <b>FUNCTIONNAME</b> is displayed.  This is the name of the
       function containing the address.

       One option can generate additional lines after the <b>FILENAME:LINENO</b> line.

       If the <b>-i</b> option is used and the code at the given address is present there because of inlining by the
       compiler then additional lines are displayed afterwards.  One or two extra lines (if the <b>-f</b> option is
       used) are displayed for each inlined function.

       Alternatively if the <b>-p</b> option is used then each input address generates a single, long, output line
       containing the address, the function name, the file name and the line number.  If the <b>-i</b> option has also
       been used then any inlined functions will be displayed in the same manner, but on separate lines, and
       prefixed by the text <b>(inlined</b> <b>by)</b>.

       If the file name or function name can not be determined, <b>addr2line</b> will print two question marks in their
       place.  If the line number can not be determined, <b>addr2line</b> will print 0.

       When symbol+offset is used, +offset is optional, except when the symbol is ambigious with a hex number.
       The resolved symbols can be mangled or unmangled, except unmangled symbols with + are not allowed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are equivalent.

       <b>-a</b>
       <b>--addresses</b>
           Display  the  address  before  the  function  name, file and line number information.  The address is
           printed with a <b>0x</b> prefix to easily identify it.

       <b>-b</b> <u>bfdname</u>
       <b>--target=</b><u>bfdname</u>
           Specify that the object-code format for the object files is <u>bfdname</u>.

       <b>-C</b>
       <b>--demangle[=</b><u>style</u><b>]</b>
           Decode (<u>demangle</u>) low-level symbol  names  into  user-level  names.   Besides  removing  any  initial
           underscore prepended by the system, this makes C++ function names readable.  Different compilers have
           different  mangling  styles.  The  optional  demangling  style  argument  can  be  used  to choose an
           appropriate demangling style for your compiler.

       <b>-e</b> <u>filename</u>
       <b>--exe=</b><u>filename</u>
           Specify the name of the executable for which addresses should be translated.   The  default  file  is
           <u>a.out</u>.

       <b>-f</b>
       <b>--functions</b>
           Display function names as well as file and line number information.

       <b>-s</b>
       <b>--basenames</b>
           Display only the base of each file name.

       <b>-i</b>
       <b>--inlines</b>
           If  the  address  belongs  to  a  function that was inlined, the source information for all enclosing
           scopes back to the first non-inlined function will also be printed.  For example, if  "main"  inlines
           "callee1"  which  inlines  "callee2",  and  address  is  from  "callee2",  the source information for
           "callee1" and "main" will also be printed.

       <b>-j</b>
       <b>--section</b>
           Read offsets relative to the specified section instead of absolute addresses.

       <b>-p</b>
       <b>--pretty-print</b>
           Make the output more human friendly: each location  are  printed  on  one  line.   If  option  <b>-i</b>  is
           specified, lines for all enclosing scopes are prefixed with <b>(inlined</b> <b>by)</b>.

       <b>-r</b>
       <b>-R</b>
       <b>--recurse-limit</b>
       <b>--no-recurse-limit</b>
       <b>--recursion-limit</b>
       <b>--no-recursion-limit</b>
           Enables  or  disables  a limit on the amount of recursion performed whilst demangling strings.  Since
           the name mangling formats allow for an infinite level of recursion it is possible to  create  strings
           whose  decoding  will  exhaust  the amount of stack space available on the host machine, triggering a
           memory fault.  The limit tries to prevent this from happening by restricting recursion to 2048 levels
           of nesting.

           The default is for this limit to be enabled, but disabling it may be necessary in order  to  demangle
           truly  complicated names.  Note however that if the recursion limit is disabled then stack exhaustion
           is possible and any bug reports about such an event will be rejected.

           The <b>-r</b> option is a synonym for the <b>--no-recurse-limit</b> option.  The <b>-R</b> option is  a  synonym  for  the
           <b>--recurse-limit</b> option.

           Note this option is only effective if the <b>-C</b> or <b>--demangle</b> option has been enabled.

       <b>@</b><u>file</u>
           Read  command-line  options  from <u>file</u>.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @<u>file</u>
           option.  If <u>file</u> does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be  treated  literally,  and
           not removed.

           Options  in <u>file</u> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option by
           surrounding the entire option in  either  single  or  double  quotes.   Any  character  (including  a
           backslash)  may be included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The <u>file</u> may
           itself contain additional @<u>file</u> options; any such options will be processed recursively.
