</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>netperfmeter</b>  is  a network performance meter for the UDP, TCP, MPTCP, SCTP and DCCP transport protocols.
       It simultaneously  transmits  bidirectional  flows  to  an  endpoint  and  measures  the  resulting  flow
       bandwidths. The results are written as vector and scalar files.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The following arguments have to be provided:

       Port    The port number for the passive side's data socket. The port number of the control socket will be
               port+1.  Specifying  a  port  number  turns  netperfmeter  in passive mode, i.e. it will wait for
               incoming connections.

       Destination:Port
               Specifies the destination endpoint to connect to. This will turn  netperfmeter  in  active  mode,
               i.e. it will connect to the specified remote endpoint.

       <b>-control-over-tcp</b>
               Use TCP instead of SCTP for the control connection. This is useful for NAT traversal.

       <b>-local=Address[,Address,...]</b>
               Specifies address(es) of the local *data* endpoint. For TCP, UDP and DCCP, only the first address
               is  used!   On  an  active  node, this option applies to the following flows, i.e. it must be set
               before specifying a flow!

       <b>-controllocal=Address[,Address,...]</b>
               Specifies address(es) of the local *control* endpoint (SCTP or TCP).  For  TCP,  only  the  first
               address is used!

       <b>-runtime</b>
               Specifies the measurement runtime in seconds. After the given time span, netperfmeter will finish
               the measurement.

       <b>-config=Name</b>
               Specifies the name of the configuration file to write. Default is output.config.

       <b>-vector=Name</b>
               Specifies  the name pattern of the vector files to write. If the suffix of this name is .bz2, the
               file will be BZip2-compressed on the fly. The vector name is automatically extended to  name  the
               flow  vector  files by adding -&lt;active|passive&gt;-&lt;flow_id&gt;-&lt;stream_id&gt; before the suffix.  Default
               is vector.vec.bz2, hence the name of the vector file for flow 5, stream 2  on  the  passive  node
               will be vector-passive-00000005-0002.vec.bz2.

       <b>-scalar=Name</b>
               Specifies  the name pattern of the scalar files to write. If the suffix of this name is .bz2, the
               file will be BZip2-compressed on the fly. The scalar name is automatically extended to  name  the
               flow  scalar  files by adding -&lt;active|passive&gt;-&lt;flow_id&gt;-&lt;stream_id&gt; before the suffix.  Default
               is scalar.vec.bz2, hence the name of the scalar file for flow 5, stream 2  on  the  passive  node
               will be scalar-passive-00000005-0002.vec.bz2.

       <b>-activenodename=Description</b>
               Sets a textual description of the active node (e.g. Client).

       <b>-passivenodename=Description</b>
               Sets a textual description of the passive node (e.g. Server).

       <b>-quiet</b>  Reduces verbosity of log output. May be specified multiple times.

       <b>-verbose</b>
               Increases verbosity of log output. May be specified multiple times.

       <b>-verbosity=Level</b>
               Sets the verbosity of the log output to a given level, from 0 (lowest) to 6 (highest).

       <b>-v6only</b>
               Use sockets with IPv6 only (by setting IPV6_V6ONLY socket option).

       <b>-pathmgr=name</b>
               Set MPTCP path manager for the passive node (MPTCP for Linux only. Requires socket options kernel
               patch!).   On  an  active  node,  this option applies to the following flows, i.e. it must be set
               before specifying a flow!

       <b>-scheduler=name</b>
               Set MPTCP scheduler for the passive node (MPTCP for Linux only. Requires  socket  options  kernel
               patch!).   On  an  active  node,  this option applies to the following flows, i.e. it must be set
               before specifying a flow!

       rcvbuf=bytes
               Sets the receiver buffer size (on the listening socket) to the given number of bytes.

       sndbuf=bytes
               Sets the sender buffer size (on the listening socket) to the given number of bytes.

       <b>-sctp</b>   Establish a new SCTP association. The streams of this association must be  specified  by  one  or
               more FLOWSPEC specifications as following parameters.

       <b>-tcp</b>    Establish  a  new  TCP  or  MPTCP  connection. The flow of this connection must be specified by a
               FLOWSPEC specification as following parameter. MPTCP  support  in  NetPerfMeter  is  realized  as
               additional "MPTCP" socket (i.e. another TCP socket, but bound to another port number and with CMT
               enabled). That is, for MPTCP usage, it must contain the option cmt=mptcp (see below) to usage the
               MPTCP socket instead of the TCP socket.

       <b>-udp</b>    Establish  a  new  UDP  connection.  The  flow of this connection must be specified by a FLOWSPEC
               specification as following parameter.

       <b>-dccp</b>   Establish a new DCCP connection. The flow of this connection must  be  specified  by  a  FLOWSPEC
               specification  as  following  parameter.  Note,  that DCCP is not available on all platforms yet.
               Currently, only Linux provides DCCP in its official kernel.

       FLOWSPEC
               Specifies           a           new           flow.           The           format            is:
               outgoing_frame_rate:outgoing_frame_size:incoming_frame_rate:incoming_frame_size:option:...    The
               first                                       four                                       parameters
               (outgoing_frame_rate:outgoing_frame_size:incoming_frame_rate:incoming_frame_size:option)  may  be
               substituted by the option "default", creating a flow  with  some  more  or  less  useful  default
               parameters.

               outgoing_frame_rate
                       The  frame  rate  of  the outgoing transfer (i.e. active node to passive node). If set to
                       const0, the sender will be saturarted, i.e. it will try to send as much as possible.

               outgoing_frame_size
                       The frame size of the outgoing transfer (i.e. active node to passive  node).  If  set  to
                       const0, there will be *no* data transmission in this direction.

               incoming_frame_rate
                       The  frame  rate  of  the  incoming  transfer  (i.e.  passive  node  to active node). See
                       outgoing_frame_rate for details.

               incoming_frame_size
                       The frame size of  the  incoming  transfer  (i.e.  active  node  to  passive  node).  See
                       outgoing_frame_size for details.

               Possible options:

                       id=Flow Identifier
                               Sets an ID number for the flow. The IDs within a measurement must be unique!

                       description=Description
                               Sets a textual description of the flow (e.g. HTTP-Flow). Do not use spaces in the
                               description!

                       maxmsgsize=Bytes
                               Splits  frames  into  messages of at most the given number of bytes. Messages may
                               not exceed 65535 bytes.

                       defragtimeout=Milliseconds
                               Messages not received within this timeout after the  last  successfully  received
                               message  are accounted as lost. NOTE: this also happens if the transport protocol
                               is reliable and the message is actually received later!

                       unordered=Fraction
                               Specifies the fraction of the messages that will be sent in unordered mode  (SCTP
                               only).

                       ordered=Fraction
                               Specifies  the  fraction  of the messages that will be sent in ordered mode (SCTP
                               only).

                       reliable=Fraction
                               Specifies the fraction of the messages that will be sent in reliable  mode  (SCTP
                               only).

                       unreliable=Fraction
                               Specifies the fraction of the messages that will be sent in unreliable mode (SCTP
                               only).

                       rtx_timeout=Milliseconds
                               Sets the retransmission timeout for unreliable messages (SCTP only; not available
                               on all platforms!)

                       rtx_trials=Trials
                               Sets  the retransmission trials for unreliable messages (SCTP only; not available
                               on all platforms!)

                       rcvbuf=Bytes
                               Sets the receiver buffer size to the given number of bytes.

                       sndbuf=Bytes
                               Sets the sender buffer size to the given number of bytes.

                       onoff=t1,t2,...[,repeat]
                               A list of time stamps when the flow should be activated or deactivated. If  onoff
                               is given, the flow is off at startup. At t1, it will be turned on; at t2, it will
                               be  turned  off,  etc..  Time  stamps  can  be  given  as  absolute  values (e.g.
                               onoff=0,10,30 - to turn on at t=0, turn off at t=10 and turn  on  again  at  t=30
                               until  end of measurement) or relative values (e.g. on=10,+30,+60 - to turn on at
                               t=10, turn off at t=40 and turn on again at t=100 until end of  measurement).   A
                               repetition  of  the  list is possible with the keyword "repeat" at the end of the
                               list. Then, all values need to be relative values and the number of items must be
                               even.

                       error_on_abort=on|off
                               By default, the active side stops with an error when a transmission  tails  (e.g.
                               on connection abort). This parameter turns this behaviour on or off.

                       nodelay=on|off
                               Deactivate Nagle algorithm (TCP and SCTP only; default: off).

                       debug=on|off
                               Set  debug  mode  on  socket  (currently:  MPTCP  for Linux only. Requires socket
                               options kernel patch!).

                       ndiffports=number
                               Set number of different MPTCP subflows (MPTCP for  Linux  only.  Requires  socket
                               options kernel patch!).

                       <b>-v6only</b>
                               Use socket with IPv6 only (by setting IPV6_V6ONLY socket option).

                       pathmgr=name
                               Set  MPTCP  path  manager  (MPTCP  for Linux only. Requires socket options kernel
                               patch!).

                       scheduler=name
                               Set MPTCP scheduler  (MPTCP  for  Linux  only.  Requires  socket  options  kernel
                               patch!).

                       cc=name
                               Set congestion control name (TCP and MPTCP for Linux only).

                       cmt=off|cmt|cmtrpv1|cmtrpv2|like-mptcp|mptcp-like|mptcp
                               Configures  usage  of  Concurrent  Multipath  Transfer  (CMT):  off  (turned off;
                               default),  cmt  (independent  paths),  cmtrpv1  (CMT/RPv1),  cmtrpv1  (CMT/RPv2),
                               mptcp/like-mptcp/mptcp-like   (MPTCP),  0-255  (custom  value).   Currently  only
                               supported by CMT-SCTP on FreeBSD systems and MPTCP on Linux  systems.  Note:  CMT
                               for MPTCP always uses MPTCP congestion control.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Some netperfmeter usage examples:

       netperfmeter 9000
               Start in passive mode, i.e. accepting connections, on port 9000.

       netperfmeter       172.16.255.254:9000      -vector=output.vec.bz2      -scalar=output.sca.bz2      -sctp
               const5:exp1000:const3:exp500:description="Alpha":onoff=+10
               const5:exp1000:const3:exp500:description="Beta":onoff=+30                                    -tcp
               const5:exp1000:const3:exp500:description="Gamma":onoff=+60 -runtime=300
               Start  in  active  mode,  i.e. establish connection to 172.16.255.254, port 9000.  Frames will be
               segmented into messages of up to 4096 bytes.  Write vectors to output.vec.bz2 (BZip2-compressed).
               Write scalars to output.sca.bz2 (BZip2-compressed).  Establish SCTP association.  At t=10s, start
               flow "Alpha" as first stream of this association, using a frame rate of 5 (constant) and  average
               frame  size  of  1000 bytes (negative exponential distribution) for the outgoing data and a frame
               rate of 3 (constant) and average frame size of 500 bytes (negative exponential distribution)  for
               the  incoming  data.   At t=30s, start flow "Beta" as second stream on the SCTP association (same
               parameters as flow "Alpha").  Start TCP connection.  At t=60s, start flow "Gamma"  over  the  TCP
               connection (same parameters as flow "Alpha").  At t=300s, stop the measurement.

       netperfmeter 172.16.255.254:9000 -control-over-tcp -tcp const2:const1000
               Start  in  active  mode,  i.e.  establish  connection  to  172.16.255.254, port 9000. The control
               connection uses TCP instead of SCTP.
