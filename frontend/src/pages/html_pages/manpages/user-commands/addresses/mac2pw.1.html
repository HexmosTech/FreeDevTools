</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mac2pw - Qualcomm Atheros Ethernet Device Password Generator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mac2pw</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>address</u> [<u>address</u>] [...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Print  a  range  of  consecutive  Ethernet  addresses and passwords on stdout such that each device has a
       unique password.  Program output is suitable as input to the Qualcomm Atheros HomePlug AV Production Test
       System or may be used in custom production  systems.   A  starting  address  and  an  address  range  are
       specified.   Computed  passwords consist of upper case letters and digits with optional group separators.
       Output consists of address/password pairs in text format.

       This program is designed to generate passwords for a large number of consecutive  device  addresses.   It
       complements  program  <b>mac2pwd</b> which generates passwords for non-consecutive device addresses occurring in
       unspecified order.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the <b>AMP</b> man page for an overview and
       installation instructions.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Atheros provides this program as a simple means of generating unique device passwords for a large  volume
       of  Ethernet  devices.  Two different password algorithms are implemented but neither one is required for
       HomePlug AV compliance.  Vendors are free to use other methods to generate their own device passwords and
       are encouraged to do so.

       Random Method
              Generate passwords based on system entropy.  A different set of passwords is generated for a given
              address range with each program execution.  There is  no  correlation  at  between  addresses  and
              passwords.   This method is secure but requires care when programming and labelling devices at the
              factory.  It may be necessary to maintain a database if regular device  maintenance  and  firmware
              upgrade are needed.

       Device Method
              Generate  passwords  based  on  device address.  The same set of passwords will be generated for a
              given address range with each program execution.  This method may be appropriate on  system  where
              regular  maintenance  and firmware updates are required.  This method is not secure because device
              addresses can be determined using a variety of network management programs.  Anyone having  access
              to  this  program,  or  the algorithm, could compute the device password and gain access to device
              features reserved for privileged users.  This program does provide features to mitigate the  risks
              of using this method.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -<b>b</b> <u>bunch</u>
              The password bunching factor.  Passwords consists of <u>count</u> uppercase letters and digits optionally
              displayed in groups separated by hyphens.  The bunching factor specifies the number of letters and
              digits  in each group.  When <u>bunch</u> is <b>0</b> or greater than <u>count</u>, bunching is suppressed.  Separating
              hyphens increase overall password length.  The minimum is <b>0</b> and the maximum is <b>255</b>.   The  default
              is <b>0</b> which suppresses bunching.

       -<b>e</b>     Compute  passwords  based  on  host  system entropy.  Passwords consist of uppercase letters [A-Z]
              optionally grouped using option <b>-b</b>.  This method produces a non-repeatable set of unique passwords
              over a given address range.  This method is the default and is secure.

       -<b>l</b> <u>count</u>
              The number of letters in the password string.  Overall password length is the sum  of  <u>count</u>  plus
              the  number of delimiters implied by <u>bunch</u>.  The minimum is <b>12</b> and the maximum is <b>64</b>.  The default
              is <b>16</b>.

       -<b>m</b>     Compute passwords based on target device address.  Passwords consist of uppercase  letters  [A-Z].
              This method produces a repeatable set of unique passwords over a given address range.  This method
              is not secure.

       -<b>n</b> <u>number</u>
              The  number of consecutive addresses and passwords to compute and print.  The minimum is <b>0</b> and the
              maximum is <b>1677215</b> or 0xFFFFFF.  The  default  is  <b>1</b>.   In  addition,  <u>number</u>  cannot  exceed  the
              remaining   available   addresses   in  the  <u>vendor</u>  range.   For  example,  given  start  address
              00:B0:52:FF:FF:00, there are only 255 remaining addresses in the 00:B0:52 vendor range so it would
              be an error to request more than that number.

       -<b>q</b>     Quiet mode.  Exclude the device address on output.  This option can be used in scripts  to  return
              the password associated with a given device address.

       -<b>v</b>     Verbose  mode.  Prefix each line with a '0' column.  The Atheros Production Test System (PTS) uses
              the first column of a password database file  to  indicate  which  addresses  and  passwords  have
              already been used.

       -<b>?</b>,--<b>help</b>
              Print  program help information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on the
              command line.

       -<b>!</b>,--<b>version</b>
              Print program version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other  options  on
              the  command line.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so that
              they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>address</b>
              The first Ethernet address expressed as 12 consecutive hexadecimal  digits.   Puncutation  is  not
              permitted.   The  final  address  of the range is computed by adding <b>number</b> to this address.  This
              argument is required.  There is no default <b>address</b>.  If more than one device address is  specified
              then an address/password series will be computed for each.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  example  prints  the  given  device  address and a random password string on stdout.  The
       default password length is 25 characters long but the length can be changes using option <b>-l</b>.

          # mac2pw 00B052000001
          00B052000001 5KAXCQFQNN4PPNC76XN2YUWMS

       Repeating the command will generate a new password string.  This is the default behaviour and is the same
       as specifying option <b>-e</b> for "<b>entropy</b>".

          # mac2pw 00B052000001
          00B052000001 CA35TM5JLG4S6XBKSM3HSU6J4

       This example ommits the device address.  Repeating the command produces a new password string.

          # mac2pw 00B052000001 -q
          2LJ6P5JPEHE6V63GZWC337Q8E
          # mac2pw 00B052000001 -q
          5Z8J7EGGL2HJDKMZ978W8V94W

       The next example shows how to generate passwords for three  different  devices  with  one  command.   The
       program generates a password for each device address specified on the command line.

          # mac2pw 00B052000001 00B05200BABE 00B05200DEAD
          00B052000001 NJHWXEFRPVVW87C9J4BQEHYYE
          00B05200BABE 5PT9Z64Z4TVRPEJCK8LR2XFMR
          00B05200DEAD 7R2LJYGJB42329AS4NM29H8V4

       The  next  example  prints  <b>10</b> consecutive device addresses and random passwords on stdout.  The starting
       device address is given and option <b>-n</b> specifies the number of addresses to print.  Output can be piped to
       a file or another process.

          # mac2pw 00B052000001 -n 10

          00B05200000A KEY9D3DW66HX68AWZRCD4VPD9

       The following example prints <b>10</b> consecutive device addresses and passwords but inserts a <b>0</b> at  the  start
       of  each  line  to  indicate  that  the  address  and  password have not been used.  The Qualcomm Atheros
       Production Test System (PTS) will set the <b>0</b> to <b>1</b> after it programs a device.  This format  is  simlar  to
       PTS DBBuilder Utility output.

          # mac2pw 00B052000006 -n 10 -v
          0 00B052000006 VZNKWJUHAV2687NV6EJYUVQ4D

       The  next  example  prints <b>10</b> consecutive device addresses and passwords, as before, but changes password
       length and character bunching.  Option <b>-l</b> specifies <b>12</b> characters and  option  <b>-b</b>  specifies  a  bunching
       factor of three.

          # mac2pw 00B052000001 -n 10 -l 12 -b 3
          00B052000001 S2J-V4B-NB6-37M

          00B05200000A TX3-NUS-TKM-LVL

       The  next  example  prints  <b>10</b>  consecutive  device addresses and passwords, as before, but starts from a
       different device address.  We specified option <b>-m</b> so that  passwords  are  generated  based  on  the  MAC
       address.  This ensures that the same password is generated each time for a given device address.  We also
       specified password length or <b>16</b> characters using option <b>-l</b> and bunching factor of <b>4</b> with option <b>-b</b>.

          # mac2pw 00B052000001 -m -l 16 -b 4 -n 10

       The  following example prints <b>10</b> consecutive device addresses and passwords, as before, but starts from a
       different device address.  The address range here overlaps the range shown  above  but  identical  device
       addresses have identical passwords.  Address based passwords may be of interest on large private networks
       requireing frequent firmware upgrades or device configuration.
