</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>addr2line</b> translates addresses into file names and line numbers.  Given an address in an executable or an
       offset in a section of a relocatable object, it uses the debugging information to figure out which file
       name and line number are associated with it.

       The executable or relocatable object to use is specified with the <b>-e</b> option.  The default is the file
       <u>a.out</u>.  The section in the relocatable object to use is specified with the <b>-j</b> option.

       <b>addr2line</b> has two modes of operation.

       In the first, hexadecimal addresses are specified on the command line, and <b>addr2line</b> displays the file
       name and line number for each address.

       In the second, <b>addr2line</b> reads hexadecimal addresses from standard input, and prints the file name and
       line number for each address on standard output.  In this mode, <b>addr2line</b> may be used in a pipe to
       convert dynamically chosen addresses.

       The format of the output is <b>FILENAME:LINENO</b>.  The file name and line number for each address is printed
       on a separate line.  If the <b>-f</b> option is used, then each <b>FILENAME:LINENO</b> line is preceded by a
       <b>FUNCTIONNAME</b> line which is the name of the function containing the address.  If the <b>-a</b> option is used,
       then the address read is first printed.

       If the file name or function name can not be determined, <b>addr2line</b> will print two question marks in their
       place.  If the line number can not be determined, <b>addr2line</b> will print 0.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are equivalent.

       <b>-a</b>
       <b>--addresses</b>
           Display  address  before  function names or file and line number information.  The address is printed
           with a <b>0x</b> prefix to easily identify it.

       <b>-b</b> <u>bfdname</u>
       <b>--target=</b><u>bfdname</u>
           Specify that the object-code format for the object files is <u>bfdname</u>.

       <b>-C</b>
       <b>--demangle[=</b><u>style</u><b>]</b>
           Decode (<u>demangle</u>) low-level symbol  names  into  user-level  names.   Besides  removing  any  initial
           underscore prepended by the system, this makes C++ function names readable.  Different compilers have
           different  mangling  styles.  The  optional  demangling  style  argument  can  be  used  to choose an
           appropriate demangling style for your compiler.

       <b>-e</b> <u>filename</u>
       <b>--exe=</b><u>filename</u>
           Specify the name of the executable for which addresses should be translated.   The  default  file  is
           <u>a.out</u>.

       <b>-f</b>
       <b>--functions</b>
           Display function names as well as file and line number information.

       <b>-s</b>
       <b>--basenames</b>
           Display only the base of each file name.

       <b>-i</b>
       <b>--inlines</b>
           If  the  address  belongs  to  a  function that was inlined, the source information for all enclosing
           scopes back to the first non-inlined function will also be printed.  For example, if  "main"  inlines
           "callee1"  which  inlines  "callee2",  and  address  is  from  "callee2",  the source information for
           "callee1" and "main" will also be printed.

       <b>-j</b>
       <b>--section</b>
           Read offsets relative to the specified section instead of absolute addresses.

       <b>-p</b>
       <b>--pretty-print</b>
           Make the output more human friendly: each location  are  printed  on  one  line.   If  option  <b>-i</b>  is
           specified, lines for all enclosing scopes are prefixed with <b>(inlined</b> <b>by)</b>.

       <b>@</b><u>file</u>
           Read  command-line  options  from <u>file</u>.  The options read are inserted in place of the original @<u>file</u>
           option.  If <u>file</u> does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be  treated  literally,  and
           not removed.

           Options  in <u>file</u> are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace character may be included in an option by
           surrounding the entire option in  either  single  or  double  quotes.   Any  character  (including  a
           backslash)  may be included by prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The <u>file</u> may
           itself contain additional @<u>file</u> options; any such options will be processed recursively.
