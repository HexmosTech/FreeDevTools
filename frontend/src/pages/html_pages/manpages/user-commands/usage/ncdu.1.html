</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ncdu</b>  (NCurses Disk Usage) is an interactive curses-based version of the well-known <u><a href="../man1/du.1.html">du</a></u>(1), and provides a
       fast way to see what directories are using your disk space.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Mode</b> <b>Selection</b>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
               Print a short help message and quit.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
               Print version and quit.

       <b>-f</b> <u>file</u>
               Load the given file, which has earlier been created with the <b>-o</b> flag.  If <u>file</u> is  equivalent  to
               '-', the file is read from standard input.

               For the sake of preventing a screw-up, the current version of <b>ncdu</b> will assume that the directory
               information  in  the  imported  file does not represent the filesystem on which the file is being
               imported.  That is, the refresh, file deletion and shell spawning options in the browser will  be
               disabled.

       <u>dir</u>     Scan the given directory.

       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>
               Export  all  necessary  information to <u>file</u> instead of opening the browser interface.  If <u>file</u> is
               '-', the data is written to standard output.  See the examples section below for some  handy  use
               cases.

               Be warned that the exported data may grow quite large when exporting a directory with many files.
               10.000 files will get you an export in the order of 600 to 700 KiB uncompressed, or a little over
               100  KiB when compressed with gzip.  This scales linearly, so be prepared to handle a few tens of
               megabytes when dealing with millions of files.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--extended</b>, <b>--no-extended</b>
               Enable/disable extended information mode.  This will, in addition to the usual file  information,
               also  read the ownership, permissions and last modification time for each file.  This will result
               in higher memory usage (by roughly ~30%) and in a larger output file when exporting.

               When using the file export/import function, this flag should be added  both  when  exporting  (to
               make  sure  the  information  is  added  to  the  export)  and when importing (to read this extra
               information in memory).  This flag has no effect when importing a file  that  has  been  exported
               without the extended information.

               This  enables viewing and sorting by the latest child mtime, or modified time, using 'm' and 'M',
               respectively.

       <b>--ignore-config</b>
               Do not attempt to load any configuration files.

   <b>Scan</b> <b>Options</b>
       These options affect the scanning progress, they have no effect when importing directory information from
       a file.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--one-file-system</b>
               Do not cross filesystem boundaries, i.e. only count files and directories on the same  filesystem
               as the directory being scanned.

       <b>--cross-file-system</b>
               Do  cross  filesystem  boundaries.   This  is  the  default,  but  can be specified to overrule a
               previously configured <b>-x</b>.

       <b>--exclude</b> <u>pattern</u>
               Exclude files that match <u>pattern</u>.  The files are still displayed by default, but are not  counted
               towards  the  disk  usage  statistics.   This  argument  can  be added multiple times to add more
               patterns.

       <b>-X</b>, <b>--exclude-from</b> <u>file</u>
               Exclude files that match any pattern in <u>file</u>.  Patterns should be separated by a newline.

       <b>--include-caches</b>, <b>--exclude-caches</b>
               Include (default) or exclude directories containing <u>CACHEDIR.TAG</u>.  Excluded cache directories are
               still displayed, but their contents will not  be  scanned  or  counted  towards  the  disk  usage
               statistics.  https://bford.info/cachedir/

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--follow-symlinks</b>, <b>--no-follow-symlinks</b>
               Follow  (or  not)  symlinks  and  count the size of the file they point to.  This option does not
               follow symlinks to directories and will cause each symlinked file to  count  as  a  unique  file.
               This  is  different from how hard links are handled.  The exact counting behavior of this flag is
               subject to change in the future.

       <b>--include-kernfs</b>, <b>--exclude-kernfs</b>
               (Linux only) Include (default) or exclude Linux pseudo filesystems such  as  <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u>  (procfs)  and
               <u><a href="file:/sys">/sys</a></u> (sysfs).

               The  complete list of currently known pseudo filesystems is: binfmt, bpf, cgroup, cgroup2, debug,
               devpts, proc, pstore, security, selinux, sys, trace.

       <b>--exclude-firmlinks</b>, <b>--follow-firmlinks</b>
               (MacOS only) Exclude or follow firmlinks.

   <b>Interface</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-0</b>      Don't give any feedback while scanning a directory or importing a file, except when a fatal error
               occurs.  Ncurses will not be initialized until the scan is complete.   When  exporting  the  data
               with  <b>-o</b>,  ncurses  will not be initialized at all.  This option is the default when exporting to
               standard output.

       <b>-1</b>      Similar to <b>-0</b>, but does give feedback on the scanning progress with  a  single  line  of  output.
               This option is the default when exporting to a file.

               In  some  cases, the ncurses browser interface which you'll see after the scan/import is complete
               may look garbled when using this option.  If you're not exporting to a  file,  <b>-2</b>  is  usually  a
               better choice.

       <b>-2</b>      Show a full-screen ncurses interface while scanning a directory or importing a file.  This is the
               only interface that provides feedback on any non-fatal errors while scanning.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--slow-ui-updates</b>, <b>--fast-ui-updates</b>
               Change  the  UI  update interval while scanning or importing.  <b>ncdu</b> updates the screen 10 times a
               second by default (with <b>--fast-ui-updates</b> ), this can be decreased to once every 2  seconds  with
               <b>-q</b>  or  <b>--slow-ui-updates</b>.   This  option  can be used to save bandwidth over remote connections.
               This option has no effect in combination with <b>-0</b>.

       <b>--enable-shell</b>, <b>--disable-shell</b>
               Enable or disable shell spawning from the file browser.  This feature is enabled by default  when
               scanning a live directory and disabled when importing from file.

       <b>--enable-delete</b>, <b>--disable-delete</b>
               Enable  or  disable  the built-in file deletion feature.  This feature is enabled by default when
               scanning a live directory and disabled  when  importing  from  file.   Explicitly  disabling  the
               deletion feature can work as a safeguard to prevent accidental data loss.

       <b>--enable-refresh</b>, <b>--disable-refresh</b>
               Enable or disable directory refreshing from the file browser.  This feature is enabled by default
               when scanning a live directory and disabled when importing from file.

       <b>-r</b>      Read-only mode.  When given once, this is an alias for <b>--disable-delete</b>, when given twice it will
               also  add  <b>--disable-shell</b>,  thus  ensuring  that  there is no way to modify the file system from
               within <b>ncdu</b>.

       <b>--si</b>, <b>--no-si</b>
               List sizes using base 10 prefixes, that is, powers of 1000 (kB,  MB,  etc),  as  defined  in  the
               International System of Units (SI), instead of the usual base 2 prefixes (KiB, MiB, etc).

       <b>--disk-usage</b>, <b>--apparent-size</b>
               Select  whether  to  display  disk usage (default) or apparent sizes.  Can also be toggled in the
               file browser with the 'a' key.

       <b>--show-hidden</b>, <b>--hide-hidden</b>
               Show (default) or hide "hidden" and excluded files.  Can also be toggled in the file browser with
               the 'e' key.

       <b>--show-itemcount</b>, <b>--hide-itemcount</b>
               Show or hide (default) the item counts column.  Can also be toggled in the file browser with  the
               'c' key.

       <b>--show-mtime</b>, <b>--hide-mtime</b>
               Show  or  hide  (default)  the  last  modification  time column.  Can also be toggled in the file
               browser with the 'm' key.  This option is ignored when not in extended mode, see <b>-e</b>.

       <b>--show-graph</b>, <b>--hide-graph</b>
               Show (default) or hide the relative size bar column.  Can also be toggled  in  the  file  browser
               with the 'g' key.

       <b>--show-percent</b>, <b>--hide-percent</b>
               Show (default) or hide the relative size percent column.  Can also be toggled in the file browser
               with the 'g' key.

       <b>--sort</b> <u>column</u>
               Change  the  default  column  to  sort  on.   Accepted values are <u>disk-usage</u> (the default), <u>name</u>,
               <u>apparent-size</u>, <u>itemcount</u> or <u>mtime</u>.  The latter only makes sense in extended mode, see <b>-e</b>.

               The column name can be suffixed  with  <b>-asc</b>  or  <b>-desc</b>  to  change  the  order  to  ascending  or
               descending, respectively.  For example, <b>--sort=name-desc</b> to sort by name in descending order.

       <b>--enable-natsort</b>, <b>--disable-natsort</b>
               Enable (default) or disable natural sort when sorting by file name.

       <b>--group-directories-first</b>, <b>--no-group-directories-first</b>
               Sort (or not) directories before files.

       <b>--confirm-quit</b>, <b>--no-confirm-quit</b>
               Require  a  confirmation  before  quitting  ncdu.  Can be helpful when you accidentally press 'q'
               during or after a very long scan.

       <b>--confirm-delete</b>, <b>--no-confirm-delete</b>
               Require a confirmation before deleting a file or directory.   Enabled  by  default,  but  can  be
               disabled if you're absolutely sure you won't accidentally press 'd'.

       <b>--color</b> <u>off</u> | <u>dark</u> | <u>dark-bg</u>
               Set  the  color  scheme.  The following schemes are recognized: <u>off</u> to disable colors, <u>dark</u> for a
               color scheme intended for dark backgrounds and <u>dark-bg</u> for a variation of the <u>dark</u>  color  scheme
               that also works in terminals with a light background.

               The default is <u>off</u>.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ncdu</b>  can  be  configured by placing command-line options in <u>/etc/ncdu.conf</u> or <u>$HOME/.config/ncdu/config</u>.
       If both files exist, the system configuration will be loaded  before  the  user  configuration,  allowing
       users  to  override  options  set  in  the  system configuration.  Options given on the command line will
       override options set in the configuration files.  The files will not be read at all when  <b>--ignore-config</b>
       is given on the command line.

       The  configuration  file  format is simply one command line option per line.  Lines starting with '#' are
       ignored.  Example configuration file:

             # Always enable extended mode
             -e

             # Disable file deletion
             --disable-delete

             # Exclude .git directories
             --exclude .git

</pre><h4><b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       ?       Open help + keys + about screen

               <b>-e</b> flag.

       d       Delete  the  selected file or directory.  An error message will be shown when the contents of the
               directory do not match or do not exist anymore on the filesystem.

       t       Toggle dirs before files when sorting.

       g       Toggle between showing percentage, graph, both, or none.  Percentage is relative to the  size  of
               the current directory, graph is relative to the largest item in the current directory.

       c       Toggle display of child item counts.

       m       Toggle display of latest child mtime, or modified time.  Requires the <b>-e</b> flag.

       e       Show/hide  'hidden' or 'excluded' files and directories.  Be aware that even if you can't see the
               hidden files and directories, they are still there and they are still included in  the  directory
               sizes.   If  you  suspect that the totals shown at the bottom of the screen are not correct, make
               sure you haven't enabled this option.

       i       Show information about the current selected item.

       r       Refresh/recalculate the current directory.

       b       Spawn shell in current directory.

               <b>ncdu</b> determines your preferred shell from the NCDU_SHELL or SHELL environment variable  (in  that
               order),  or  calls <u><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></u> if neither are set.  This allows you to also configure another command
               to be run when he 'b' key is pressed.  For example, to spawn the <u><a href="../man1/vifm.1.html">vifm</a></u>(1) file manager instead  of
               a shell, run <b>ncdu</b> as follows:
                     <b>NCDU_SHELL=vifm</b> <b>ncdu</b>
               The NCDU_LEVEL environment variable is set or incremented before spawning the shell, allowing you
               to  detect  if  your  shell  is  running  from  within <b>ncdu</b>.  This can be useful to avoid nesting
               multiple instances, although <b>ncdu</b>  itself  does  not  (currently)  warn  about  or  prevent  this
               situation.

       q       Quit

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       Entries in the browser interface may be prefixed by a one-character flag.  These flags have the following
       meaning:

       !       An error occurred while reading this directory.

       .       An error occurred while reading a subdirectory, so the indicated size may not be correct.

       &lt;       File or directory is excluded from the statistics by using exclude patterns.

       &gt;       Directory is on another filesystem.

       ^       Directory is excluded from the statistics due to being a Linux pseudo filesystem.

       @       This is neither a file nor a folder (symlink, socket, ...).

       H       Same file was already counted (hard link).

       e       Empty directory.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To scan and browse the directory you're currently in, all you need is a simple:
             <b>ncdu</b>
       If you want to scan a full filesystem, for example your root filesystem, then you'll want to use <b>-x</b>:
             <b>ncdu</b> <b>-x</b> <b>/</b>

       Since  scanning  a  large directory may take a while, you can scan a directory and export the results for
       later viewing:

             ncdu -1xo- / | gzip &gt;export.gz
             # ...some time later:
             zcat export.gz | ncdu -f-
       To export from a cron job, make sure to replace <b>-1</b> with <b>-0</b> to suppress any unnecessary output.

       You can also export a directory and browse it once scanning is done:
             <b>ncdu</b> <b>-o-</b> | <b>tee</b> <b>export.file</b> | <b>./ncdu</b> <b>-f-</b>
       The same is possible with gzip compression, but is a bit kludgey:

             <b>ncdu</b> <b>-o-</b> | <b>gzip</b> | <b>tee</b> <b>export.gz</b> | <b>gunzip</b> | <b>./ncdu</b> <b>-f-</b>
       To scan a system remotely, but browse through the files locally:
             <b>ssh</b> <b>-C</b> <b>user@system</b> <b>ncdu</b> <b>-o-</b> <b>/</b> | <b>./ncdu</b> <b>-f-</b>
       The <b>-C</b> option to ssh enables compression, which will be very useful over slow links.  Remote scanning and
       local viewing has two major advantages when compared to running <b>ncdu</b> directly on the remote  system:  You
       can  browse  through the scanned directory on the local system without any network latency, and <b>ncdu</b> does
       not keep the entire directory structure in memory when exporting, so this won't consume  much  memory  on
       the remote system.

       Directory  hard  links  are  not supported.  They are not detected as being hard links, and will thus get
       scanned and counted multiple times.

       Some minor  glitches  may  appear  when  displaying  filenames  that  contain  multibyte  or  multicolumn
       characters.

       All  sizes  are  internally represented as a signed 64bit integer.  If you have a directory larger than 8
       EiB minus one byte, ncdu will clip its size to 8 EiB minus one byte.  When deleting or  refreshing  items
       in  a  directory with a clipped size, the resulting sizes will be incorrect.  Item counts are stored in a
       32-bit integer without overflow detection.  If you have a directory with more than 2 billion files, quite
       literally anything can happen.

       On macOS 10.15 and later, running ncdu on  the  root  directory  without  <b>--exclude-firmlinks</b>  may  cause
       directories  to  be scanned and counted multiple times.  Firmlink cycles are not detected, so it may also
       cause <b>ncdu</b> to get stuck in an infinite loop and eventually run out of memory.

       Please report any other bugs you may find at the bug tracker, which can be  found  on  the  web  site  at
