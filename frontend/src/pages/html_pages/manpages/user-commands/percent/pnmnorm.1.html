       pnmnorm - normalize the contrast in a Netpbm image

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pnmnorm</b>

       [<b>-bpercent=</b><u>percent</u> | <b>-bvalue=</b><u>N</u> | <b>-bsingle</b>]

       [<b>-wpercent=</b><u>percent</u> | <b>-wvalue=</b><u>N</u> | <b>-wsingle</b>]

       [<b>-midvalue=</b><u>N</u>]

       [<b>-middle=N</b>]

       [<b>-maxexpand=</b><u>percent</u>]

       [<b>-keephues</b>]

       [<b>-luminosity</b> | <b>-colorvalue</b> | <b>-saturation</b>]

       [<u>ppmfile</u>]

       All  options  can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  You may use two hyphens instead of one
       to designate an option.  You may use either white space or an equals sign between an option name and  its
       value.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pnmnorm</b> reads a PNM image (PBM, PGM, or PPM).  It normalizes the contrast by forcing the brightest pixels
       to  white, the darkest pixels to black, and spreading out the ones in between.  It produces the same kind
       of file as output.  This is pretty useless for a PBM image.

       The program offers two ways of spreading out the pixels in between the darkest and brightest: linear  and
       quadratic.   In  the  quadratic  case, you specify some in between brightness and specify what brightness
       that should become in the output.  With those three constraints: the brightness that becomes  black,  the
       brightness  that  becomes  white,  and  the brightness that becomes that middle value, <b>pnmnorm</b> computes a
       quadratic equation that maps all the other brightnesses from input values to output values.

       The program first determines a mapping of old brightness to new brightness.  For each possible brightness
       of a pixel, the program determines a corresponding brightness for the output image.

       Then for each pixel in the image, the program computes a color which has the  desired  output  brightness
       and  puts  that in the output.  With a color image, it is not always possible to compute such a color and
       retain any semblance of the original hue, so the brightest and dimmest pixels may  only  approximate  the
       desired brightness.

       For a PPM image, you have a choice of three ways to define brightness:

       •      luminosity

       •      color value

       •      saturation

              In  the case of saturation, "brightness" is pretty much a misnomer, but you can use the brightness
              analogy to see what it does.  In the analogy, bright means saturated and dark means unsaturated.

       Note that all of these are different from separately normalizing the individual color components.

       An alternative way to spread out the brightnesses in an image  is  <b>pnmhisteq</b>.   <b>pnmhisteq</b>  stretches  the
       brightest pixels to white and the darkest pixels to black, but rather than linearly adjusting the ones in
       between,  it  adjusts  them so that there are an equal number of pixels of each brightness throughout the
       range.  This gives you more contrast than <b>pnmnorm</b> does,  but  can  considerably  change  the  picture  in
       exchange.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see  Common
       Options ), <b>pnmnorm</b> recognizes the following command line options:

       By default, the darkest 2 percent of all pixels are mapped to black, and  the  brightest  1  percent  are
       mapped  to  white.  You can override this behavior and specify either a different percentage, or specific
       brightness values to map to black and to white, or just have the single greatest brightness map to  white
       and the least brightness map to black.

       <b>-bpercent</b>

       <b>-wpercent</b>

       <b>-bvalue</b>

       <b>-wvalue</b>

              To  specify  a  percentage,  use the <b>-bpercent</b> and <b>-wpercent</b> options, or you can specify the exact
              pixel values to be mapped by using the <b>-bvalue</b> and  <b>-wvalue</b>  options.   You  can  get  appropriate
              numbers  for  the  options  from  <b>ppmhist</b>.   If you just want to enhance the contrast, then choose
              values at elbows in the histogram; e.g. if value 29 represents  3%  of  the  image  but  value  30
              represents 20%, choose 30 for <u>bvalue</u>.  If you want to brighten the image, then set <u>bvalue</u> to 0 and
              just  fiddle  with  <u>wvalue</u>;  similarly,  to  darken  the image, set <u>wvalue</u> to maxval and play with
              <u>bvalue</u>.

              If you specify both <b>-bvalue</b> and <b>-bpercent</b>, <b>pnmnorm</b> uses the one that produces  the  least  change.
              The  same  goes  for  <b>-wvalue</b> and <b>-wpercent</b>.  (In Netpbm 10.26 (January 2005), the <b>-bvalue</b>/<b>-wvalue</b>
              takes precedence, and before that, it's a syntax error to specify both).

              If you want to maximize the change instead of minimizing it, just cascade  two  runs  of  <b>pnmnorm</b>,
              specifying values for the first and percentages for the second.

              <b>-bpercent</b>  and  <b>-wpercent</b>  values  are  floating  point decimal.  Zero is valid and is the same as
              <b>-bvalue=0</b> or <b>-wvalue=</b><u>maxval</u>, respectively.

              Because there are whole numbers of pixels at each brightness, <b>pnmnorm</b>  obviously  can't  guarantee
              the  exact  percentage,  so  it  arranges  that  <u>at</u> <u>least</u> the percentage of pixels you specify get
              remapped as promised.

              It is possible for your <b>-bpercent</b> or <b>-wpercent</b> to overlap your <b>-wvalue</b> or  <b>-bvalue</b>,  respectively.
              For  example,  you  say  <b>-bpercent=20</b> and <b>-wvalue=100</b> for an image in which only 10 percent of the
              pixels are darker than 100.  In that case, <b>pnmnorm</b> adjusts the percentile value as  required.   In
              the example, it uses 99 as the black value (like <b>-bvalue=99</b>).

              It  is  also possible for your <b>-bpercent</b> and <b>-wpercent</b> options to select the same brightness value
              for the stretch-to-white and stretch-to-black  value  because  of  the  fact  that  <b>pnmnorm</b>  can't
              subdivide a histogram cell.  E.g. if an image is all brightness 100, then no matter what <b>-bpercent</b>
              and  <b>-wpercent</b>  values you choose, it's the same as saying <b>-bvalue=100</b> <b>-wvalue=100</b>.  In that case,
              <b>pnmnorm</b> changes one of the values by 1 to make it legal.  In the  example,  <b>pnmnorm</b>  would  either
              make the black value 99 or the white value 101.

              Before Netpbm 10.43 (June 2008), <b>pnmnorm</b> fails if the <b>-wpercent</b> and/or <b>-bpercent</b> values specify an
              overlap.

              The stretch points are further constrained by the <b>-maxexpand</b> option.  Sometimes, too much contrast
              is  a  bad  thing.   If  your  intensities  are  all  concentrated  in the middle, <b>-bpercent=2</b> and
              <b>-wpercent=1</b> might mean that an intensity of 60 gets stretched up to 100 and intensity of  20  gets
              stretched  down  to  zero,  for  a range expansion of 150% (from a range of 40 to a range of 100).
              That much stretching means two adjacent pixels that used to differ in intensity  by  4  units  now
              differ by 10, and that might be unsightly.

       <b>-bsingle</b>

              To  specify  that  the single least brightness in the image should stretch to black in the output,
              specify <b>-bsingle</b>.  To specify that the single greatest brightness in the image should  stretch  to
              white  in  the output, specify <b>-wsingle</b>.  <b>-bsingle</b> and <b>-wsingle</b> were new in Netpbm 10.69 (December
              2014).

       <b>-maxexpand</b>

              So that you can put a limit on the amount of expansion without having to examine the image  first,
              there  is  the  <b>-maxexpand</b>  option.   It  specifies the maximum expansion you will tolerate, as an
              additional percentage.  In the example above, you could say <b>-maxexpand=50</b>  to  say  you  want  the
              range  to  expand  by  at  most  50%,  regardless of your other options.  <b>pnmnorm</b> figures out what
              intensity to stretch to full intensity  and  what  intensity  to  stretch  to  zero  intensity  as
              described above, and then raises the former and lowers the latter as needed to limit the expansion
              to the amount you specified.

              When <b>pnmnorm</b> limits the expansion because of <b>-maxexpand</b>, it tells you about it with a message like
              this:

                  limiting expansion of 150% to 50%

              In any case, <b>pnmnorm</b> tells you exactly what expansion it's doing, like this:

                  remapping 25..75 to 0..100

              Before  Netpbm  10.26  (December  2004), it was not valid to specify both <b>-bvalue</b> and <b>-bpercent</b> or
              <b>-wvalue</b> and <b>-wpercent</b>.

              <b>-maxexpand</b> was new in Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006).

       <b>-keephues</b>

              This option says to keep each pixel the  same  hue  as  it  is  in  the  input;  just  adjust  its
              brightness.   You  normally  want this; the only reason it is not the default behavior is backward
              compatibility with a design mistake.

              By default, <b>pnmnorm</b> normalizes contrast in each component independently (except that  the  meaning
              of  the  <b>-wpercent</b>  and <b>-bpercent</b> options are based on the overall brightnesses of the colors, not
              each component taken separately).  So if you have a color which is intensely red but dimly  green,
              <b>pnmnorm</b> would make the red more intense and the green less intense, so you end up with a different
              hue than you started with.

       <b>-midvalue=</b><u>N</u>

       <b>-middle=</b><u>N</u>

              When  you  specify  <b>-midvalue=</b><u>N</u>,  <b>pnmnorm</b> uses a quadratic function to map old brightnesses to new
              ones, making sure that an old brightness of <u>N</u> becomes 50% bright in the output.  You can  override
              that  50%  default  with  <b>-middle</b>.  The value of <b>-middle</b> is a floating point number in the range 0
              through 1 with 0 being full darkness and  1  full  brightness.   If  your  <b>-midvalue</b>  and  <b>-middle</b>
              indicate  an ambiguous or impossible quadratic function (e.g. <b>-midvalue</b> is the same as <b>-bvalue</b>, so
              an infinite number of quadratic functions fit), <b>pnmnorm</b>  just  ignores  your  <b>-midvalue</b>  and  maps
              linearly.

              <b>-midvalue</b> and <b>-middle</b> were new in Netpbm 10.57 (December 2011).

              If  you  specify  <b>-keephues</b>,  <b>pnmnorm</b>  would  likely  leave  this  pixel  alone, since its overall
              brightness is medium.

              <b>-keephues</b> can cause clipping, because a certain color may be below a target intensity while one of
              its components is saturated.  Where that's  the  case,  <b>pnmnorm</b>  uses  the  maximum  representable
              intensity  for  the  saturated  component and the pixel ends up with less overall intensity, and a
              different hue, than it is supposed to have.

              This option is meaningless on grayscale images.

              When you <u>don't</u> specify <b>-keephues</b>, the <b>-luminosity</b>, <b>-colorvalue</b>, and <b>-saturation</b> options affect the
              transfer function (which is the same for all three RGB components), but are  meaningless  when  it
              comes to applying the transfer function (since it is applied to each individual RGB component).

              Before Netpbm 9.25 (March 2002), there was no <b>-keephues</b> option.

       <b>-luminosity</b>

       <b>-colorvalue</b>

       <b>-saturation</b>

              <b>-luminosity</b>,   <b>-colorvalue</b>,  and  <b>-saturation</b>  determine  what  property  of  the  pixels  <b>pnmnorm</b>
              normalizes.  I.e., what kind of brightness.  You cannot specify more than one of these.

              The <b>-luminosity</b> option says to use the luminosity (i.e. the "Y" in the YUV or YCbCr  color  space)
              as  the  pixel's brightness.  The luminosity is a measure of how bright a human eye would find the
              color, taking into account the fact that the human eye is more sensitive to  some  RGB  components
              than others.

              This option is default.

              This option is meaningless on grayscale images.

              Before  Netpbm 10.28 (August 2005), there was no <b>-luminosity</b> option, but its meaning was still the
              default.

              Before Netpbm 10.28 (August 2005), there was no <b>-colorvalue</b> option.

              The <b>-colorvalue</b> option says to use the color value (i.e. the "V" in the HSV color  space)  as  the
              pixel's  brightness.   The  color  value  is  the gamma-adjusted intensity of the most intense RGB
              component.

              This option is meaningless on grayscale images.

              Before Netpbm 10.28 (August 2005), there was no <b>-colorvalue</b> option.

              The <b>-saturation</b> option says to use the saturation (i.e. the "S" in the HSV  color  space)  as  the
              pixel's  brightness.   The  saturation  is  the  ratio  of  the  intensity of the most intense RGB
              component to the difference between the intensities of the most and least  intense  RGB  component
              (all intensities gamma-adjusted).

              In  this  case,  "brightness"  is  more of a metaphor than anything.  "bright" means saturated and
              "dark" means unsaturated.

              This option is meaningless on grayscale images.

              Before Netpbm 10.28 (August 2005), there was no <b>-colorvalue</b> option.
