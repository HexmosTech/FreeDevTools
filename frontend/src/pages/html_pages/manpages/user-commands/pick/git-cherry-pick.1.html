       git-cherry-pick - Apply the changes introduced by some existing commits

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git</u> <u>cherry-pick</u> [--edit] [-n] [-m &lt;parent-number&gt;] [-s] [-x] [--ff]
                         [-S[&lt;keyid&gt;]] &lt;commit&gt;...
       <u>git</u> <u>cherry-pick</u> (--continue | --skip | --abort | --quit)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Given one or more existing commits, apply the change each one introduces, recording a new commit for
       each. This requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit).

       When it is not obvious how to apply a change, the following happens:

        1. The current branch and <b>HEAD</b> pointer stay at the last commit successfully made.

        2. The <b>CHERRY_PICK_HEAD</b> ref is set to point at the commit that introduced the change that is difficult
           to apply.

        3. Paths in which the change applied cleanly are updated both in the index file and in your working
           tree.

        4. For conflicting paths, the index file records up to three versions, as described in the "TRUE MERGE"
           section of <b><a href="../man1/git-merge.1.html">git-merge</a></b>(1). The working tree files will include a description of the conflict bracketed
           by the usual conflict markers &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.

        5. No other modifications are made.

       See <b><a href="../man1/git-merge.1.html">git-merge</a></b>(1) for some hints on resolving such conflicts.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       &lt;commit&gt;...
           Commits to cherry-pick. For a more complete list of ways to spell commits, see <b><a href="../man7/gitrevisions.7.html">gitrevisions</a></b>(7). Sets
           of commits can be passed but no traversal is done by default, as if the <b>--no-walk</b> option was
           specified, see <b><a href="../man1/git-rev-list.1.html">git-rev-list</a></b>(1). Note that specifying a range will feed all &lt;commit&gt;... arguments to a
           single revision walk (see a later example that uses <u>maint</u> <u>master..next</u>).

       -e, --edit
           With this option, <u>git</u> <u>cherry-pick</u> will let you edit the commit message prior to committing.

       --cleanup=&lt;mode&gt;
           This option determines how the commit message will be cleaned up before being passed on to the commit
           machinery. See <b><a href="../man1/git-commit.1.html">git-commit</a></b>(1) for more details. In particular, if the <u>&lt;mode&gt;</u> is given a value of
           <b>scissors</b>, scissors will be appended to <b>MERGE_MSG</b> before being passed on in the case of a conflict.

       -x
           When recording the commit, append a line that says "(cherry picked from commit ...)" to the original
           commit message in order to indicate which commit this change was cherry-picked from. This is done
           only for cherry picks without conflicts. Do not use this option if you are cherry-picking from your
           private branch because the information is useless to the recipient. If on the other hand you are
           cherry-picking between two publicly visible branches (e.g. backporting a fix to a maintenance branch
           for an older release from a development branch), adding this information can be useful.

       -r
           It used to be that the command defaulted to do <b>-x</b> described above, and <b>-r</b> was to disable it. Now the
           default is not to do <b>-x</b> so this option is a no-op.

       -m &lt;parent-number&gt;, --mainline &lt;parent-number&gt;
           Usually you cannot cherry-pick a merge because you do not know which side of the merge should be
           considered the mainline. This option specifies the parent number (starting from 1) of the mainline
           and allows cherry-pick to replay the change relative to the specified parent.

       -n, --no-commit
           Usually the command automatically creates a sequence of commits. This flag applies the changes
           necessary to cherry-pick each named commit to your working tree and the index, without making any
           commit. In addition, when this option is used, your index does not have to match the HEAD commit. The
           cherry-pick is done against the beginning state of your index.

           This is useful when cherry-picking more than one commits' effect to your index in a row.

       -s, --signoff
           Add a <b>Signed-off-by</b> trailer at the end of the commit message. See the signoff option in <b><a href="../man1/git-commit.1.html">git-commit</a></b>(1)
           for more information.

       -S[&lt;keyid&gt;], --gpg-sign[=&lt;keyid&gt;], --no-gpg-sign
           GPG-sign commits. The <b>keyid</b> argument is optional and defaults to the committer identity; if
           specified, it must be stuck to the option without a space.  <b>--no-gpg-sign</b> is useful to countermand
           both <b>commit.gpgSign</b> configuration variable, and earlier <b>--gpg-sign</b>.

       --ff
           If the current HEAD is the same as the parent of the cherry-pickâ€™ed commit, then a fast forward to
           this commit will be performed.

       --allow-empty
           By default, cherry-picking an empty commit will fail, indicating that an explicit invocation of <b>git</b>
           <b>commit</b> <b>--allow-empty</b> is required. This option overrides that behavior, allowing empty commits to be
           preserved automatically in a cherry-pick. Note that when "--ff" is in effect, empty commits that meet
           the "fast-forward" requirement will be kept even without this option. Note also, that use of this
           option only keeps commits that were initially empty (i.e. the commit recorded the same tree as its
           parent). Commits which are made empty due to a previous commit will cause the cherry-pick to fail. To
           force the inclusion of those commits, use <b>--empty=keep</b>.

       --allow-empty-message
           By default, cherry-picking a commit with an empty message will fail. This option overrides that
           behavior, allowing commits with empty messages to be cherry picked.

       --empty=(drop|keep|stop)
           How to handle commits being cherry-picked that are redundant with changes already in the current
           history.

           <b>drop</b>
               The commit will be dropped.

           <b>keep</b>
               The commit will be kept. Implies <b>--allow-empty</b>.

           <b>stop</b>
               The cherry-pick will stop when the commit is applied, allowing you to examine the commit. This is
               the default behavior.

           Note that <b>--empty=drop</b> and <b>--empty=stop</b> only specify how to handle a commit that was not initially
           empty, but rather became empty due to a previous commit. Commits that were initially empty will still
           cause the cherry-pick to fail unless one of <b>--empty=keep</b> or <b>--allow-empty</b> are specified.

       --keep-redundant-commits
           Deprecated synonym for <b>--empty=keep</b>.

       --strategy=&lt;strategy&gt;
           Use the given merge strategy. Should only be used once. See the MERGE STRATEGIES section in <b><a href="../man1/gitmerge.1.html">git-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man1/gitmerge.1.html">merge</a></b>(1) for details.

       -X&lt;option&gt;, --strategy-option=&lt;option&gt;
           Pass the merge strategy-specific option through to the merge strategy. See <b><a href="../man1/git-merge.1.html">git-merge</a></b>(1) for details.

       --rerere-autoupdate, --no-rerere-autoupdate
           After the rerere mechanism reuses a recorded resolution on the current conflict to update the files
           in the working tree, allow it to also update the index with the result of resolution.
           <b>--no-rerere-autoupdate</b> is a good way to double-check what <b>rerere</b> did and catch potential mismerges,
           before committing the result to the index with a separate <b>git</b> <b>add</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SEQUENCER</b> <b>SUBCOMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       --continue
           Continue the operation in progress using the information in <b>.git/sequencer</b>. Can be used to continue
           after resolving conflicts in a failed cherry-pick or revert.

       --skip
           Skip the current commit and continue with the rest of the sequence.

       --quit
           Forget about the current operation in progress. Can be used to clear the sequencer state after a
           failed cherry-pick or revert.

       --abort
           Cancel the operation and return to the pre-sequence state.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>git</b> <b>cherry-pick</b> <b>master</b>
           Apply the change introduced by the commit at the tip of the master branch and create a new commit
           with this change.

       <b>git</b> <b>cherry-pick</b> <b>..master</b>, <b>git</b> <b>cherry-pick</b> <b>^HEAD</b> <b>master</b>
           Apply the changes introduced by all commits that are ancestors of master but not of HEAD to produce
           new commits.

       <b>git</b> <b>cherry-pick</b> <b>maint</b> <b>next</b> <b>^master</b>, <b>git</b> <b>cherry-pick</b> <b>maint</b> <b>master..next</b>
           Apply the changes introduced by all commits that are ancestors of maint or next, but not master or
           any of its ancestors. Note that the latter does not mean <b>maint</b> and everything between <b>master</b> and
           <b>next</b>; specifically, <b>maint</b> will not be used if it is included in <b>master</b>.

       <b>git</b> <b>cherry-pick</b> <b>master~4</b> <b>master~2</b>
           Apply the changes introduced by the fifth and third last commits pointed to by master and create 2
           new commits with these changes.

       <b>git</b> <b>cherry-pick</b> <b>-n</b> <b>master~1</b> <b>next</b>
           Apply to the working tree and the index the changes introduced by the second last commit pointed to
           by master and by the last commit pointed to by next, but do not create any commit with these changes.

       <b>git</b> <b>cherry-pick</b> <b>--ff</b> <b>..next</b>
           If history is linear and HEAD is an ancestor of next, update the working tree and advance the HEAD
           pointer to match next. Otherwise, apply the changes introduced by those commits that are in next but
           not HEAD to the current branch, creating a new commit for each new change.

       <b>git</b> <b>rev-list</b> <b>--reverse</b> <b>master</b> <b>--</b> <b>README</b> | <b>git</b> <b>cherry-pick</b> <b>-n</b> <b>--stdin</b>
           Apply the changes introduced by all commits on the master branch that touched README to the working
           tree and index, so the result can be inspected and made into a single new commit if suitable.

       The following sequence attempts to backport a patch, bails out because the code the patch applies to has
       changed too much, and then tries again, this time exercising more care about matching up context lines.

           $ git cherry-pick topic^             <b>(1)</b>
           $ git diff                           <b>(2)</b>
           $ git cherry-pick --abort            <b>(3)</b>
           $ git cherry-pick -Xpatience topic^  <b>(4)</b>

        <b>1.</b> apply the change that would be shown by <b>git</b> <b>show</b> <b>topic^</b>. In this example, the patch
           does not apply cleanly, so information about the conflict is written to the index
           and working tree and no new commit results.
        <b>2.</b> summarize changes to be reconciled
        <b>3.</b> cancel the cherry-pick. In other words, return to the pre-cherry-pick state,
           preserving any local modifications you had in the working tree.
        <b>4.</b> try to apply the change introduced by <b>topic^</b> again, spending extra time to avoid
           mistakes based on incorrectly matching context lines.
