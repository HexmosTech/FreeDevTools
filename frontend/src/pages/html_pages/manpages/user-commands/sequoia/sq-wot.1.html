</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       An implementation of OpenPGP's web of trust.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--gpg</b>  Uses gpg's keyring and gpg's trust roots.

              When this option is set, `sq-wot` reads gpg's keyring and gpg's ownertrust.  This is equivalent to
              passing `--gpg-keyring` and `--gpg-ownertrust`.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keyring</b>=<u>FILE</u>
              Adds KEYRING to the list of keyrings

              The  keyrings  are  read  at  start  up  and  used  to  build  a web of trust network.  Note: if a
              certificate occurs multiple times, the first version is taken; they are not currently merged.

       <b>--gpg-keyring</b>
              Adds GnuPG's keyring to the list of keyrings.

              This option causes `sq-wot` to read  gpg's  keyring,  by  parsing  the  output  of  `gpg  --export
              --export-options export-local-sigs`.

       <b>--network</b>
              Looks up missing certificates over the network.

              This  causes `sq-wot` to look up missing certificates on a key server.  The default key server can
              be overridden using the `--keyserver` option.

              Certificates fetched from a key server are cached locally in  the  default  cert-d.   The  default
              cert-d is also checked prior to fetching a certificate from the key server.

       <b>--keyserver</b>=<u>KEYSERVER</u> [default: hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com]
              Sets the keyserver to use to KEYSERVER.

              This  option only makes sense when used in conjunction with the `--network` option.  Currently, it
              is only possible to set a single keyserver.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--trust-root</b>=<u>FINGERPRINT|KEYID</u>
              Treats the specified certificate as a trust root.

              It is possible to have multiple trust roots.  All trust roots are treated equivalently.  This  can
              be combined with `--gpg-ownertrust`.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--format</b>=<u>FORMAT</u> [default: human-readable]
              Render the output in a specific format

              Choosing  a  different output format allows for further post processing of the data using external
              tools.

              <u>Possible</u> <u>values:</u>

                     • dot: output in graphviz's DOT format

                     • human-readable: output in human readable format

       <b>--gpg-ownertrust</b>
              Causes `sq-wot` to use gpg's trust roots as the trust roots.

              `sq-wot` reads the output of  `gpg  --export-ownertrust`.   It  treats  gpg's  ultimately  trusted
              certificates  as  fully  trust roots.  Similar to gpg, it also treats certificates marked as fully
              and marginally trusted as fully and marginally trusted roots, if a  self-signed  User  ID  can  be
              authenticated by an ultimately trusted root.

              It is possible to set additional trust roots using the `--trust-root` option.

       <b>--gossip</b>
              Treats all certificates as unreliable trust roots.

              This  option  is  useful  for  figuring out what others think about a certificate (i.e., gossip or
              hearsay).  In other words, this finds arbitrary paths to a particular certificate.

              Gossip is useful in helping to identify alternative  ways  to  authenticate  a  certificate.   For
              instance,  imagine  Ed  wants  to  authenticate  Laura's  certificate,  but asking her directly is
              inconvenient.  Ed discovers that Micah has  certified  Laura's  certificate,  but  Ed  hasn't  yet
              authenticated Micah's certificate.  If Ed is willing to rely on Micah as a trusted introducer, and
              authenticating  Micah's certificate is easier than authenticating Laura's certificate, then Ed has
              learned about an easier way to authenticate Laura's certificate.

              EXAMPLES:

              # Get gossip about a certificate.{n}  $  sq-wot  --keyring  keyring.pgp  \\{n}  --gossip  identify
              3217C509292FC67076ECD75C7614269BDDF73B36

       <b>--certification-network</b>
              Treats the network as a certification network.

              Normally,  `sq-wot`  treats  the  web-of-trust  network  as  an  authentication  network  where  a
              certification only means that the binding is correct, not that the target should be treated  as  a
              trusted  introducer.   In  a  certification  network, the targets of certifications are treated as
              trusted introducers with infinite depth, and any regular expressions are ignored. Note: The  trust
              amount remains unchanged.  This is how most so-called pgp path-finding algorithms work.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--trust-amount</b>=<u>TRUST_AMOUNT</u>
              The required amount of trust.

              120  indicates  full  authentication;  values less than 120 indicate partial authentication.  When
              `--certification-network` is passed, this defaults to 1200, i.e., sq-wot tries to find 10 paths.

       <b>--partial</b>
              Require partial authentication.

              This is the same as passing `--trust-amount 40`.

       <b>--full</b> Require full authentication.

              This is the same as passing `--trust-amount 120`.

       <b>--double</b>
              Require double authentication.

              This is the same as passing `--trust-amount 240`.

       <b>--time</b>=<u>TIME</u>
              Sets the reference time to TIME.

              TIME is interpreted as an ISO 8601 timestamp.  To set the reference  time  to  July  21,  2013  at
              midnight UTC, you can do:

              $ sq-wot --time 20130721 CMD ...

              To include a time, add a T, the time and optionally the timezone (the default timezone is UTC):

              $ sq-wot --time 20130721T0550+0200 CMD ...

       <b>--known-notation</b>=<u>KNOWN_NOTATION</u>
              Adds NOTATION to the list of known notations

              This is used when validating signatures.  Signatures that have unknown notations with the critical
              bit set are considered invalid.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print help (see a summary with '-h')

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
