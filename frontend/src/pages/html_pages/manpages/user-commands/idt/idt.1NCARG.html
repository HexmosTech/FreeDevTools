       idt - X window interactive image display tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>idt</b>  [ <b>-toolkitoption</b> <u>...</u>  ] [ <b>-background</b> <u>color</u> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>font</u> ] [ <b>-foreground</b> <u>color</u> ] [ <b>-history</b> ] [ <b>-lmin</b>

       [ <b>metafile</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>idt</b>  provides  a  graphical user interface to the NCAR View interactive metafile translator <b>ictrans</b>.  <b>idt</b>
       supports a subset of the <b>ictrans</b> command interface.

       <b>idt</b> provides two types of command panels for interacting with imagery. The  first  type  is  the  control
       panel,  which  you  see  when  you  initially  invoke  <b>idt</b>.  The control panel displays messages from the
       translators, provides a metafile selection utility and is responsible for instantiating the  second  type
       of  command  panel, the display panel. The display panel provides mechanisms for controlling translators.
       Each display panel manages a single  metafile  translator.  There  can  be  multiple  display  panels  in
       existence at the same time but only one control panel.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>idt</b>  accepts  all  of  the  standard  X  Toolkit  command  line options (see <a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a>(1)).  <b>idt</b> also accepts the
       following options:

       <b>-f</b> <u>fontcap</u>
              Fontcap file to be used for stroking text.   When  interpreting  CGM  <b>TEXT</b>  command  elements  use
              <u>fontcap</u>  as  the default font for textual translation. Note: CGMs may contain textual descriptions
              which are  not  embedded  in  CGM  <b>TEXT</b>  elements.  Hence  they  are  not  influenced  by  <u>fontcap</u>
              specifications.   Note  also  that  a CGM may explicitly specify a named font which may override a
              font provided on the command line. The environment variable FONTCAP may also be used to specify  a
              default fontcap.

              If  <u>fontcap</u>  is  preceded by a UNIX directory path then <b>ctrans</b> will look in that directory for the
              specified fontcap. Otherwise <b>idt</b> searches the  directory  $NCARG_ROOT/lib/ncarg/fontcaps  for  the
              fontcap.

              See  <b><a href="../man5NCARG/fontcap.5NCARG.html">fontcap</a>(5NCARG)</b>  for  a description of the available fontcaps. See <b><a href="../man1NCARG/fcap.1NCARG.html">fcap</a>(1NCARG)</b> for a list of
              the fontcaps installed on your system.

              This option overrides the <b>FONTCAP</b> environment variable.

       <b>-history</b>
              Write a record of all commands sent to the translator to the file <b>./.idthist</b>.

       <b>-Version</b>
              Print the version number and then exit.

       The following options are ignored by <b>idt</b> and are passed  on  to  the  metafile  translator  <b>ictrans</b>.  See
       <b><a href="../man1NCARG/ictrans.1NCARG.html">ictrans</a>(1NCARG)</b> for a description of their use.

       <b>-soft</b>

       <b>-lmin</b> <u>linewidth</u>

       <b>-lmax</b> <u>linewidth</u>

       <b>-lscale</b> <u>linewidth</u>

       <b>-pal</b> <u>pal_fname</u>

       <b>-foreground</b> <u>color</u>

       <b>-background</b> <u>color</u>

       <b>-reverse</b>

</pre><h4><b>CONTROL</b> <b>PANEL</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The  control  panel  provides  a  text  widget  for displaying messages from the translators and a row of
       command buttons. Messages are preceded  with  the  string  "Display[X]",  where  "X"  is  an  integer  id
       associated  with  the  translator  sending the message. The first translator spawned is "Display[0]", the
       second is "Display[1]", etc.

       select file
              Selects a file for translation. This button brings up a popup menu  containing  a  file  selection
              box.  The  uppermost  dialog  box  of  the  file selection box is used for specifying a filter for
              searching for files. For example,  the  filter  "<a href="file:/usr/local/lib/">/usr/local/lib/</a>*.cgm"  finds  all  files  in  the
              directory  <a href="file:/usr/local/lib">/usr/local/lib</a>  whose  names  end  with  ".cgm".  The finder understands standard shell
              metacharacters.

              The bottom dialog box displays the currently selected file. The user may enter a file name here or
              select one with the mouse from the list of files displayed in the middle text widget.

       display
              Popup a display panel. A display panel is popped  up  ready  for  translation  of  the  file  most
              recently selected with the file selector. This command will fail if a file has not been selected.

       quit   Quits the application and terminates all translators.

</pre><h4><b>DISPLAY</b> <b>PANEL</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The  display  panel  provides  a  mechanism  for manipulating the translator associated with a particular
       metafile. On most systems the name of the metafile appears in the title bar at the top of the panel.  The
       first  row  in the panel contains a scroll bar for randomly selecting a frame to be translated. The label
       bar to the right displays the number of the frame scrolled to. The panel is intended to resemble a  video
       tape editor. Thus, the second row contains play back, jog back, stop, jog and play buttons, respectively.
       The third and forth rows contain more complex display commands.

       loop   Toggle  the looping mode on or off. When loop is on pressing the play (playback) button causes the
              translator to process all the frames in the segment sequentially (reverse sequentially)  and  then
              start over from the beginning (end). The process continues until the "stop" button is selected. By
              default loop mode is off.

       dup    Sets  duplication  variable.  If  dup is set to <b>1</b> each frame is displayed once, if dup is set to <b>2</b>
              each frame is displayed twice, etc. The default value of dup is <b>1</b>.

       goto   Go to the specified frame and translate it.  <b>goto</b> provides random access to the  frames  contained
              in the metafile.

       skip   Set the skip variable. If skip is set to <b>1</b> every other frame is displayed during subsequent plays,
              if skip is set to <b>2</b> every third frame is displayed, etc. The default value for skip is <b>0.</b>

       delay  Set the between-frame animation delay-time. When <b>idt</b> is in animation mode you may request that <b>idt</b>
              pause  for a period of time between the display of each image.  The effect of setting a delay time
              is to govern the speed at which <b>idt</b> "plays" imagery.

       start segment
              Define the first frame in the segment. This button and the <b>stop</b> <b>segment</b> button  define  a  segment
              which  is  a subset of the frames contained in the metafile. When in play (playback) mode only the
              frames contained within the defined segment are translated. The default value for <b>start</b> <b>segment</b> is
              <b>1</b>, the first frame in the file.

       stop segment
              Define the last frame in the segment. The default frame is the last frame in the file.  Hence,  by
              default the segment is the entire metafile.

       set window
              Specify  the  workstation window (in the GKS sense). Four coordinates are specified which define a
              rectangular window which is a subset of normalized VDC rectangle  with  corner  points  (0,0)  and
              (1.0,1.0).  The  specified  window  is  then  mapped onto the entire viewport. For example, if the
              workstation window is defined by the corner points (0,0) and (0.5 0.5) then the lower left quarter
              of a plot would be blown up to fill the largest rectangle which fits in the drawing  window  while
              retaining  the  aspect  ratio  described  by  the normalized coordinates.  Specification of such a
              window can be used for zooming and panning.

       done   Terminate processing of current metafile.

       current frame
              Update the "Scrolled to Frame -&gt;" label box with the number of the current frame.

       print  Send the current frame to the printer.  The  <b>print</b>  command  brings  up  a  menu  of  all  devices
              configured  for  accepting  translator  output.  This  list  is created dynamically in response to
              changes in the spooler configuration file (see <a href="../man5NCARG/ncarv_spool.5NCARG.html">ncarv_spool</a>(5NCARG)).  Selecting an item  from  the
              menu causes the current frame to be sent to that device.

       save   Save  a  frame to a file. This command allows you to write the metacode for the current frame to a
              file. The result is a complete NCAR Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) containing a single frame.

       unzoom Reset windowing transformations previously set by the <b>zoom</b> command back to their default.

       zoom   Zoom in on an area of a plot. The function of this command is identical  to  that  of  the  <b>window</b>
              command.  The  <b>zoom</b> command, however, allows you to select the area of interest interactively with
              the mouse.

       animate
              Toggle animation mode on or off. When <b>idt</b> is put into animation mode the currently defined segment
              is rasterized with the translator and loaded into the X server  memory.  Subsequent  <b>idt</b>  commands
              operate  on  the  memory-resident images. Not all <b>idt</b> commands are available in animation mode. By
              default animation is off.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       As with all standard X applications, <b>idt</b> may be customized through entries in the resource  manager.   In
       the  following  list  of application resources provided by <b>idt</b> the resource name is given followed by its
       class in parentheses.  These resources supplement the resources provided by the widgets themselves.

       history (Class History)
              Specify whether a history of commands sent to the metafile translators is  recorded  to  the  file
              "./.idthist" or not. The default for this resource is "False".

       fileSelectAction (Class FileSelectAction)
              Set  the default action to be executed after a file has been selected with the file selection box.
              Currently the only value this resource understands is "display".

              Specifies the <b>ictrans</b> "-foreground" option.

       translatorBackground (Class TranslatorBackground)
              Specifies the <b>ictrans</b> "-background" option.

       translatorReverse (Class TranslatorReverse)
              Specifies the <b>ictrans</b> "-reverse" option.

</pre><h4><b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>idt</b> provides the following actions for use in event translation:

       FinderTranslation()
              This  action causes the file selector popup to search for files using the key supplied in the file
              finder text box.

       OkFinderTranslation()
              This action notifies the file selector that a selection has been made.

       SelectFileTranslation()
              This action updates the text box in the file selector which displays the currently selected file.

       OkSDTranslation()
              This action confirms a selection made in one of the display panel popup dialog boxes.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGETS</b></h4><pre>
       In order to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of the widgets which make up  <b>idt</b>.   In
       the  notation  below,  indentation  indicates hierarchal structure. The widget class name is given first,
       followed by the widget instance name.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following resource specification can be used to set the default size of the graphics  display  window
       to 200 by 200 pixels:

                 Idt*canvas.width:   200
            Idt*canvas.height:  200

       If  you want to place the control panel in the top right corner insert the following into your .Xdefaults
       file:

                 idt.geometry:        -0+0

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b>
              This is the standard X environment variable for specifying display name. If the translation output
              device is <b>X11</b> this variable MUST be set.

       <b>FONTCAP</b>
              Default fontcap specifier.

       <b>NCARG_ROOT</b>
              Path to root of NCAR Graphics installation.

       <b>NCARG_LIB</b>
              If set this variable contains the path  to  the  installed  NCAR  Graphics  libraries.   <b>NCARG_LIB</b>
              overrides <b>NCARG_ROOT</b>.

       <b>NCARG_TMP</b>
              If  set,  this  environment  variable contains a directory path to be used for temporary files. On
              most systems the default is <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b>.  On some systems the default is <b>/usr/tmp</b>.

       <b>SHELL</b>  Specifies the UNIX shell that the file selector is to use for expanding metacharacters. <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> is
              used by default.

       <b>XENVIRONMENT</b>
              Specifies the name of  a  resource  file  that  overrides  the  global  resources  stored  in  the
              RESOURCE_MANAGER property.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Zooming in on large cell arrays causes the translator to crash.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       The  metafile file translation process is performed by spawning the <b>ictrans</b> translator.  <b>ictrans</b> does not
       understand standard X Toolkit  options.  Hence,  the  DISPLAY  environment  variable  must  be  set  when
       translating a metafile to be displayed in a window.

       You  can  not  save  "zoomed" plots to a file. More precisely, you may save a "zoomed" plot, however, the
       resultant plot will not be "zoomed".

       The "Scrolled to Frame" label is not continuously updated.

       The range with which one may zoom in on a plot with either the <b>zoom</b> or <b>window</b> command is severely limited
       by Xlibs use of 'short' integers for containing screen coordinate data.

       IRIX 4.x users should not set use the shared memory connection to their  X  server.  i.e  don't  use  the
       display shm:0.

       Background  color  changes  don't work when <b>idt</b> is in animate mode.  <b>idt</b> will use whatever color was most
       recently set in the animation segment for the entire segment.
