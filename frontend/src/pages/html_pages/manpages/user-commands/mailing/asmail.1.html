</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>asmail</b> is a X11 application that acts as an e-mail monitor for a number of various format mailboxes.
       The <b>asmail</b> provides a distinctive Afterstep window manager look and feel and features multiple options to
       allow the customization.

       Basically, the tool shows you the following:

       - The background image changes depending on whether
         there is e-mail in your mailboxes or not.
         Custom images may be loaded and used for animation
         sequences.

       - The tool will display the number of e-mails waiting
         in each mailbox and/or the total numbers for all
         mailboxes together.

       - For each mailbox, there is a status indicator that
         shows whether the update is running at this moment
         and indicates if there is an error. The same indicator
         shows up next to the summary line.

       The folowing indicators are used for the status display:

         <b>R</b>  An update on the mailbox is running at this moment.
            For small mailboxes with fast access, you may never
            actually see it - so fast it disappears.

         <b>L</b>  An error occured that has to do with the login
            procedure. Most probably, your name/password
            combination was not accepted by the server.

         <b>C</b>  A connection problem. <b>asmail</b> could not
            connect to the server for some reason. The reasons
            may be many - server down, network unreachable,
            service not available and so on.

         <b>T</b>  A time-out has occured while <b>asmail</b> was
            waiting for the server's answer. If you have a
            frequent problem with this but the server seems
            to be available in other applicaitons, try
            increasing the "timeout" setting for the mailbox.

         <b>F</b>  This is an indicator of a general error condition.
            Something is wrong, maybe the configuration is not
            correct, or the mailbox is not readable. Check the
            output of <b>asmail</b> by running from the terminal -
            this should give you an idea of what is wrong.

       The resource files may be specified with a command line option. The logic of <b>asmail</b> is simple:  first  it
       parses the resource file that you specified on the command line.  If you do not specify the resource file
       on  the  command line, <b>asmail</b> will look in the default location (<a href="file:~/.asmailrc">~/.asmailrc</a>).  If it exists, <b>asmail</b> will
       parse that one. If no configuration file was given on the command line and there is no configuration file
       in the default location, <b>asmail</b> will attempt to monitor the mailbox specified by the <b>$MAILBOX</b> environment
       variable.

       <b>How</b> <b>asmail</b> <b>distinguishes</b> <b>between</b> <b>old</b> <b>and</b> <b>new</b> <b>mail.</b>

       The <b>UNIX</b> <b>mailbox</b> format does not contain any indication on the outside. The mailbox  must  be  parsed  to
       check  if some e-mail is new. Parsing the mailbox is an expensive operation, especially if the mailbox is
       large. <b>asmail</b> checks the mailbox file modification time with the  <b><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></b>(2)  system  call.  When  the  file
       modification  time  changes,  the  mailbox  is  parsed. The lines "<b>From</b> " are counted and taken to be the
       number of e-mails in the box. After each "<b>From</b> " line, asmail looks for the "<b>Status:</b>" header. This header
       contains flags when the message was seen and read. Messages without this header line (or  with  an  empty
       header) are considered to be new.

       The  <b>Maildir</b>  format  is very well-behaved. There are separate folders for old and new e-mails so we just
       count the number of files in "<b>cur</b>" and "<b>new</b>" subdirectories.  The "<b>tmp</b>"  subdirectory  is  ignored  since
       this is the temporary storage and is not supposed to be taken into account.

       The <b>mH</b> format is somewhere between Maildir and the UNIX mailbox formats. It is used by mh, nmh, balsa and
       xfmail  among others. The messages are all stored in separate files, one message per file, and all of the
       messages in a single directory. Each message file is named  with  an  increasing  number,  so  the  first
       message  recieved  in the mailbox is stored as "1" and the 39th message is stored as "39".  There are two
       ways that the status of the messages are kept track of. Traditionally, the mH tools used  a  file  called
       "<b>.mh_sequences</b>",  which  is  stored  in  the  mH directory, to keep track of status. This file contains a
       series of sequences, each one starting with a token followed by a colon and then by a series  of  message
       numebrs, representing the messages that belong to that sequence. It looks something like this:
              unseen: 1 2 3-5 19 25-31
       Although  there  are  many  sequences,  some  standard  and  some  user-defined,  if the <b>use-mh-sequences</b>
       configuration option is set to "yes" for that mailbox, then asmail will parse this file, looking for  the
       "unseen"  sequence to determine how many messages are new.  Some mail clients don't use the .mh_sequences
       file and instead treat the files in the mH mailbox just like a collection of  seperate  messages  from  a
       UNIX  mailbox.  So,  if  the <b>use-mh-sequences</b> configuration option is set to "no", or is not specified at
       all, then asmail will parse all of the files in the  mH  directory,  searching  for  the  <b>Status</b>  header.
       Therefore,  this  mode is definitely the most "processor hungry" format from the point of view of <b>asmail</b>.
       mh, nmh, and newer versions of balsa utilize the .mh_sequences file, while older versions  of  balsa  and
       xfmail do not.  It is not known how other clients treat mH mailboxes.

       The  <b>POP3</b>  protocol  does not support the notion of new or old e-mail. Your e-mail client keeps a list of
       messages and can tell whether you read one of them or not. Since <b>asmail</b> does not keep a list of  messages
       there  is  no  way to tell a new message from the old one. Ok, so what we do is assume that all e-mail is
       new at start-up. This is a logical assumption for most of  the  people  because  they  store  the  e-mail
       locally  and  remove  it  from  the  server.   Others  are  out of luck. Now, when the number of messages
       decreases, we assume that you read all your e-mail and deleted some, so all messages are marked  as  old.
       When  the  number of messages increases, we assume that the new mail arrived and we report the additional
       mail as new.

       The <b>IMAP</b> protocol is very well behaved, it reports the number of new e-mails and the  number  of  old  e-
       mails  if  you  ask  politely  :) Since we open the mailbox in read-only mode, we do not cause any status
       changes for the mailbox on the server. The <b>IMAP</b> server will store a special e-mail into your  mailbox  if
       it  is in UNIX format. This e-mail allows the server to keep track of the new and old e-mails. The server
       will not report this e-mail into the number of e-mails, so that if you check your <b>UNIX</b>  <b>mailbox</b>  directly
       the number of messages will be one more.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h
              prints a short description and usage message.

       -V
              Version control. Prints out the version of the program.

       -v
              Verbose mode. In this mode, <b>asmail</b> will print the information about mailboxes onto the controlling
              terminal.   The  information  includes:  number  of  updates  requested,  per mailbox: thread PID,
              [<b>R</b>]unning or idle, any errors are signalled with leters (see above) and the number of  e-mails  in
              the  format  new/old.  This  mode  is  useful  for debugging or could be used to monitor mailboxes
              without X Windows interface (give the <b>-nox</b> option).

       -f resource file
              Specifies the alternative location for the resource file.  The default location is <a href="file:~/.asmailrc">~/.asmailrc</a>  If
              the alternative file is specified, the default location is ignored.

       -geometry X geometry specification
              Specifies  the  size and position of the application on the screen in the standard X11 format (see
              <b>XParseGeometry</b> <b>(3x)</b> for details):

              [=][&lt;width&gt;{xX}&lt;height&gt;][{+-}&lt;xoffset&gt;{+-}&lt;yoffset&gt;]

       -noconfig
              Forces <b>asmail</b> to ignore the resource file even if one is present. <b>asmail</b> will run with all default
              settings and check the Unix mailbox specified by the <b>$MAIL</b> environment variable.

       -nox
              Starts the <b>asmail</b> application in the terminal-only mode. The X Windows interface is  not  started.
              The configuration file is still parsed as usual though.

              This option implies <b>-v</b> option.

       -insecure
              Usually,  <b>asmail</b>  will  check that the resource file has the <b>600</b> mode, that is there are no access
              rights for "group" and "others". If such access rights are granted, <b>asmail</b> will complain and exit.
              This is done to make you remember the passwords you put into the resource file.  If there  are  no
              passwords  stored  in the file (e.g. you are using UNIX mailbox on the local machine) the check is
              not applied.

              This option forces <b>asmail</b> to continue operation even if the resource file has insecure permissions
              and passwords are stored in that file.

       -iconic
              This option will cause <b>asmail</b> to start up  as  an  icon  rather  than  as  a  normal  window.  The
              application can still be de-iconized and iconized as usual.

       -withdrawn
              This  option  will  cause <b>asmail</b> to start up in a so-called "withdrawn" mode. This mode is used by
              <b>WindowMaker</b> window manager to dock the application into their version of the <b>Wharf</b>.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCE</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       The syntax of the resource file is described in a separate man page under <b>asmailrc</b> (5).

</pre><h4><b>INVOCATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>asmail</b> can be called in different ways.  The most common invocation is the command line:

            user@host[1]% asmail &amp;

       Another way to call <b>asmail</b> is from the window manager:

            *Wharf "asmail" nil Swallow "asmail" /usr/local/bin/asmail &amp;

       This line, when placed in the <u>wharf</u> file in the users Afterstep configuration directory will cause <b>asmail</b>
       to become a button on the <b>Wharf</b> <b>(1)</b> button bar under the <b>afterstep</b> <b>(1)</b> window manager.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       My programs do not have bugs, they just develop random features ;-)

       Well, there are limitations. All the strings for the color names, file names, and other strings have  the
       length  limit  of  256 characters (terminating zero included).  The program will complain about very long
       names in the configuration file.

       The number of mailboxes is not limited by the space on the icon but the stats will be chopped (not shown)
       if you have too many and they do not fit into the icon.  Make sure you pick up a tall icon  if  you  have
       many mailboxes and want to see info on each of them because they are shown from the top down and there is
       no way to change this.

       The  information about mailboxes will not appear when you use "shaped" windows with transparency if it is
       printed in the transparent area.

       <b>asmail</b> may interfere with your mail client program when you use the POP3 server. There is no way to login
       to the POP3 server twice (from the mail client and <b>asmail</b>),  so  there  is  an  inherent  race  condition
       between  the  two.   The  one  that  tries to log in second, will fail. <b>asmail</b> logs out immediately after
       checking so your mail client will have a much higher chance of precluding <b>asmail</b> from logging in than the
       other way around.

       If the program is not satisfied with the specification of one of the mailboxes, it will  print  an  error
       message,  set  the  status  for  that  mailbox to <b>F</b> (Failed) and exit the thread (only the thread that is
       responsible for handling that particular mailbox). Other mailboxes will be checked normally.   Check  the
       standard output of the tool to see what the problem is.
