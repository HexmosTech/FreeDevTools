       mail, mailx, Mail — send and receive mail

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mail</b> [<b>-dEIinv</b>] [<b>-a</b> <u>header</u>] [<b>-b</b> <u>bcc-addr</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>cc-addr</u>] [<b>-r</b> <u>from-addr</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>subject</u>] [<b>--</b>] <u>to-addr</u> <u>...</u>
       <b>mail</b> [<b>-dEIiNnv</b>] <b>-f</b> [<u>file</u>]
       <b>mail</b> [<b>-dEIiNnv</b>] [<b>-u</b> <u>user</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mail</b>  is an intelligent mail processing system which has a command syntax reminiscent of <u><a href="../man1/ed.1.html">ed</a></u>(1) with lines
       replaced by messages.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-a</b>      Specify additional header fields on the command line such as "X-Loop: foo@bar" etc.   It  can  be
               also  used  to  override  MIME headers <b>mail</b> adds by default to each outgoing mail, see “Character
               sets and MIME” below.  You have to use quotes if the string contains spaces.  This  argument  may
               be specified more than once, the headers will then be concatenated.

       <b>-b</b> <u>bcc-addr</u>
               Send blind carbon copies to <u>bcc-addr</u>.

       <b>-c</b> <u>cc-addr</u>
               Send carbon copies to list of users.  <u>cc-addr</u> should be a comma separated list of names.

       <b>-d</b>      Causes <b>mail</b> to output all sorts of information useful for debugging <b>mail</b>.

       <b>-E</b>      Don't send messages with an empty body.

       <b>-f</b>      Use  an alternate mailbox.  Defaults to the user's <u>mbox</u> if no <u>file</u> is specified.  When quit, <b>mail</b>
               writes undeleted messages back to this <u>file</u>.

       <b>-I</b>      Forces <b>mail</b> to run in interactive mode, even when input is not a terminal.   In  particular,  the
               special <b>~</b> command character, used when sending mail, is only available interactively.

       <b>-i</b>      Ignore tty interrupt signals.  This is particularly useful when using <b>mail</b> on noisy phone lines.

       <b>-N</b>      Inhibits initial display of message headers when reading mail or editing a mail folder.

       <b>-n</b>      Inhibits reading <u>/etc/mail.rc</u> upon startup.

       <b>-r</b> <u>from-addr</u>
               Use <u>from-addr</u> as the from address in the message and envelope.  Overrides any <u>from</u> options in the
               startup files.

       <b>-s</b> <u>subject</u>
               Specify  subject on command line (only the first argument after the <b>-s</b> flag is used as a subject;
               be careful to quote subjects containing spaces).

       <b>-u</b> <u>user</u>
               Equivalent to:

                     <b>$</b> <b>mail</b> <b>-f</b> <b>/var/mail/user</b>

               except that locking is done.

       <b>-v</b>      Verbose mode.  The details of delivery are displayed on the user's terminal.

       <b>--</b>      End of options. Any further argument is treated as a direct receipient address.

               <u>Note:</u> For security reasons the <b>--</b> separator is strongly recommended for scripts that need to send
               mails to addresses obtained from untrusted sources (such as web forms).

   <b>Startup</b> <b>actions</b>
       At startup time, <b>mail</b> will execute commands in the system command file, <u>/etc/mail.rc</u>,  unless  explicitly
       told not to by using the <b>-n</b> option.  Next, the commands in the user's personal command file <u><a href="file:~/.mailrc">~/.mailrc</a></u> are
       executed.   <b>mail</b>  then  examines  its  command line options to determine whether the user requested a new
       message to be sent or existing messages in a mailbox to be examined.

   <b>Sending</b> <b>mail</b>
       To send a message to one or more people, <b>mail</b> can be invoked with arguments which are the names of people
       to whom the mail will be sent.  You are then expected to type in your message, followed  by  a  control-D
       (‘^D’)  at the beginning of a line.  The section below, “Replying to or originating mail”, describes some
       features of <b>mail</b> available to help you compose your letter.

   <b>Reading</b> <b>mail</b>
       In normal usage, <b>mail</b> is given no arguments and checks your mail out of the post office, then prints  out
       a  one  line  header  of  each  message found.  The current message is initially set to the first message
       (numbered 1) and can be printed using the <b>print</b> command (which can be abbreviated <b>p</b>).  Moving  among  the
       messages is much like moving between lines in <u><a href="../man1/ed.1.html">ed</a></u>(1); you may use <b>+</b> and <b>-</b> to shift forwards and backwards,
       or simply enter a message number to move directly.

   <b>Disposing</b> <b>of</b> <b>mail</b>
       After  examining  a  message, you can <b>delete</b> (<b>d</b>) or <b>reply</b> (<b>r</b>) to it.  Deletion causes the <b>mail</b> program to
       forget about the message.  This is not irreversible; the message can  be  <b>undeleted</b>  (<b>u</b>)  by  giving  its
       number,  or  the  <b>mail</b> session can be aborted by giving the <b>exit</b> (<b>x</b>) command.  Deleted messages, however,
       will usually disappear, never to be seen again.

   <b>Specifying</b> <b>messages</b>
       Commands such as <b>print</b> and <b>delete</b> can be given a list of message numbers  as  arguments  to  apply  to  a
       number  of messages at once.  Thus <b>delete</b> <b>1</b> <b>2</b> deletes messages 1 and 2, while <b>delete</b> <b>1-5</b> deletes messages
       1 through 5.

       Messages may also be selected using one of the following categories:

             *       all messages
             $       last message
             :d      deleted messages
             :n      new messages
             :o      old messages
             :r      read messages
             :u      unread messages

       Thus the command <b>top</b>, which prints the first few lines of a message, could be used in <b>top</b> <b>*</b> to print  the
       first few lines of all messages.

   <b>Replying</b> <b>to</b> <b>or</b> <b>originating</b> <b>mail</b>
       You can use the <b>reply</b> command to set up a response to a message, sending it back to the person who it was
       from.   Text  you then type in, up to an end-of-file, defines the contents of the message.  While you are
       composing a message, <b>mail</b> treats lines beginning with the tilde (‘~’) character specially.  For instance,
       typing <b>~m</b> (alone on a line) will place a copy of the current message into the response, right shifting it
       by a single tab-stop (see the <u>indentprefix</u> variable, below).  Other escapes will set up  subject  fields,
       add  and  delete recipients to the message, and allow you to escape to an editor to revise the message or
       to a shell to run some commands.  (These options are given in the summary below.)

   <b>Ending</b> <b>a</b> <b>mail</b> <b>processing</b> <b>session</b>
       You can end a <b>mail</b> session with the <b>quit</b> (<b>q</b>) command.  Messages which have been examined go to your  <u>mbox</u>
       file unless they have been deleted, in which case they are discarded.  Unexamined messages go back to the
       post office (see the <b>-f</b> option above).

   <b>Personal</b> <b>and</b> <b>system</b> <b>wide</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>lists</b>
       It  is  also  possible  to create personal distribution lists so that, for instance, you can send mail to
       “<b>cohorts</b>” and have it go to a group of people.  Such lists can be defined by placing a line like

             <b>alias</b> <b>cohorts</b> <b>bill</b> <b>ozalp</b> <b>jkf</b> <b>mark</b> <b>kridle@ucbcory</b>

       in the file <u>.mailrc</u> in your home directory.  The current list of such aliases can be displayed  with  the
       <b>alias</b>  command  in  <b>mail</b>.   System  wide  distribution lists can be created by editing <u>/etc/aliases</u>, (see
       <u><a href="../man5/aliases.5.html">aliases</a></u>(5)); these are kept in a different syntax.  In mail you send, personal aliases will  be  expanded
       in mail sent to others so that they will be able to <b>reply</b> to the recipients.  System wide aliases are not
       expanded  when  the  mail  is sent, but any reply returned to the machine will have the system wide alias
       expanded as all mail goes through an MTA.

   <b>Recipient</b> <b>address</b> <b>specifications</b>
       Recipient addresses (any of the “To”, “Cc” or “Bcc” header fields) are  subject  to  expansion  when  the
       <b>expandaddr</b> option is set.

       An address may be expanded as follows:

       <b>•</b>       An  address  that starts with a pipe (‘|’) character is treated as a command to run.  The command
               immediately following the ‘|’ is executed with the message as its standard input.

       <b>•</b>       An address that starts with a ‘+’ character is treated as a folder.

       <b>•</b>       An address that contains a ‘/’ character but no ‘!’, ‘%’, or ‘@’ characters is also treated as  a
               folder.

       <b>•</b>       If none of the above apply, the recipient is treated as a local or network mail address.

       If the <b>expandaddr</b> option is not set (the default), no expansion is performed and the recipient is treated
       as a local or network mail address.

   <b>Character</b> <b>sets</b> <b>and</b> <b>MIME</b>
       Generally  <b>mail</b>  does not handle neither different character sets nor any other MIME feature.  Especially
       it does not perform any any conversions between character sets while displaying or sending mails.

       Starting from April 2017, however, as a Debian extension this version of <b>mail</b> adds a few MIME headers  to
       every  outgoing  mail  in  order  to  indicate  that  the mail is sent as 8-bit plain text data that uses
       character set encoding detected from the current <u><a href="../man7/locale.7.html">locale</a></u>(7) settings.  The <b>-a</b> command-line option  can  be
       used to override those headers, for example:
             <b>$</b> <b>mail</b> <b>-a</b> <b>'Content-Type:</b> <b>text/plain;</b> <b>charset="ISO-8859-1"'</b>
       sets header indicating legacy character encoding.

</pre><h4><b>SUMMARY</b></h4><pre>
       (Adapted from the “Mail Reference Manual”.)

       Each  command  is  typed  on  a  line  by itself, and may take arguments following the command word.  The
       command need not be typed in its entirety — the first command which matches the  typed  prefix  is  used.
       For  commands  which  take message lists as arguments, if no message list is given, then the next message
       forward which satisfies the command's requirements is used.  If there are  no  messages  forward  of  the
       current  message, the search proceeds backwards, and if there are no good messages at all, <b>mail</b> types “No
       applicable messages” and aborts the command.

       <b>-</b>       Print out the preceding message.  If given a numeric argument <u>n</u>, goes to the <u>n</u>th previous message
               and prints it.

       <b>=</b>       Prints the currently selected message number.

       <b>?</b>       Prints a brief summary of commands.

       <b>!</b>       Executes the shell (see <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1) and <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1)) command which follows.

       <b>alias</b>   (<b>a</b>) With no arguments, prints out all currently defined aliases.  With one argument,  prints  out
               that alias.  With more than one argument, creates a new alias or changes an old one.

       <b>alternates</b>
               (<b>alt</b>)  The <b>alternates</b> command is useful if you have accounts on several machines.  It can be used
               to inform <b>mail</b> that the listed addresses are really you.  When you <b>reply</b> to messages,  <b>mail</b>  will
               not  send  a  copy  of the message to any of the addresses listed on the <b>alternates</b> list.  If the
               <b>alternates</b> command is given with no argument, the current set of alternate names is displayed.

       <b>chdir</b>   (<b>cd</b> or <b>ch</b>) Changes the user's working directory to that specified, if given.  If no directory  is
               given, then changes to the user's login directory.

       <b>copy</b>    (<b>c</b>)  The  <b>copy</b>  command  does  the  same  thing  that <b>save</b> does, except that it does not mark the
               messages it is used on for deletion when you quit.

       <b>delete</b>  (<b>d</b>) Takes a list of messages as argument and marks them all as deleted.   Deleted  messages  will
               not be saved in <u>mbox</u>, nor will they be available for most other commands.

       <b>dp</b>      (also  <b>dt</b>) Deletes the current message and prints the next message.  If there is no next message,
               <b>mail</b> says “<b>No</b> <b>more</b> <b>messages.</b>”

       <b>edit</b>    (<b>e</b>) Takes a list of messages and points the text editor at each one in turn.  On return from  the
               editor, the message is read back in.

       <b>exit</b>    (<b>ex</b>  or  <b>x</b>) Effects an immediate return to the shell without modifying the user's system mailbox,
               <u>mbox</u> file, or edit file in <b>-f</b>.

       <b>file</b>    (<b>fi</b>) The same as <b>folder</b>.

       <b>folder</b>  (<b>fo</b>) The <b>folder</b> command switches to a new mail file or folder.  With no arguments, it  tells  you
               which  file  you  are  currently  reading.  If you give it an argument, it will write out changes
               (such as deletions) you have made in the current file and read in the  new  file.   Some  special
               conventions are recognized for the name.  # means the previous file, % means your system mailbox,
               %user  means  user's  system  mailbox,  &amp;  means your <u>mbox</u> file, and +folder means a file in your
               folder directory.

       <b>folders</b>
               List the names of the folders in your folder directory.

       <b>from</b>    (<b>f</b>) Takes a list of messages and prints their message headers.

       <b>headers</b>
               (<b>h</b>) Lists the current windowful of headers.  To view the next or previous group of  headers,  see
               the <b>z</b> command.

       <b>help</b>    A synonym for <b>?</b>.

       <b>hold</b>    (<b>ho</b>, also <b>preserve</b>) Takes a message list and marks each message therein to be saved in the user's
               system mailbox instead of in <u>mbox</u>.  Does not override the <b>delete</b> command.

       <b>ignore</b>  Add  the  list  of header fields named to the <u>ignored</u> <u>list</u>.  Header fields in the ignore list are
               not printed on your terminal  when  you  print  a  message.   This  command  is  very  handy  for
               suppression  of certain machine-generated header fields.  The <b>Type</b> and <b>Print</b> commands can be used
               to print a message in its entirety, including ignored fields.  If  <b>ignore</b>  is  executed  with  no
               arguments, it lists the current set of ignored fields.

       <b>inc</b>     Incorporate  any  new  messages that have arrived while mail is being read.  The new messages are
               added to the end of the message list, and the current message is reset to be the first  new  mail
               message.  This does not renumber the existing message list, nor does it cause any changes made so
               far to be saved.

       <b>list</b>    (<b>l</b>) List the valid <b>mail</b> commands.

       <b>mail</b>    (<b>m</b>) Takes as argument login names and distribution group names and sends mail to those people.

       <b>mbox</b>    Indicate  that  a list of messages be sent to <u>mbox</u> in your home directory when you quit.  This is
               the default action for messages if you do <u>not</u> have the <b>hold</b> option set.

       <b>more</b>    (<b>mo</b>) Takes a message list and invokes the pager on that list.

       <b>next</b>    (<b>n</b>) (like <b>+</b> or CR) Goes to the next message in sequence and types it.   With  an  argument  list,
               types the next matching message.

       <b>preserve</b>
               (<b>pre</b>) A synonym for <b>hold</b>.

       <b>Print</b>   (<b>P</b>) Like <b>print</b> but also prints out ignored header fields.  See also <b>print</b>, <b>ignore</b>, and <b>retain</b>.

       <b>print</b>   (<b>p</b>) Takes a message list and types out each message on the user's terminal.

       <b>quit</b>    (<b>q</b>) Terminates the session, saving all undeleted, unsaved messages in the <u>mbox</u> file in the user's
               login  directory, preserving all messages marked with <b>hold</b> or <b>preserve</b> or never referenced in the
               user's system mailbox, and removing all other messages from the user's system  mailbox.   If  new
               mail  has  arrived  during the session, the message “<b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>new</b> <b>mail</b>” is given.  If given while
               editing a mailbox file with the <b>-f</b> flag, then the edit file is rewritten.  A return to the  shell
               is  effected,  unless  the rewrite of edit file fails, in which case the user can escape with the
               <b>exit</b> command.

       <b>Reply</b>   (<b>R</b>) Reply to originator.  Does not reply to other recipients of the original message.

       <b>reply</b>   (<b>r</b>) Takes a message list and sends mail to  the  sender  and  all  recipients  of  the  specified
               message.  The default message must not be deleted.

       <b>respond</b>
               A synonym for <b>reply</b>.

       <b>retain</b>  Add  the  list of header fields named to the <u>retained</u> <u>list</u>.  Only the header fields in the retain
               list are shown on your  terminal  when  you  print  a  message.   All  other  header  fields  are
               suppressed.   The  <b>Type</b>  and  <b>Print</b>  commands can be used to print a message in its entirety.  If
               <b>retain</b> is executed with no arguments, it lists the current set of retained fields.

       <b>save</b>    (<b>s</b>) Takes a message list and a filename and appends each message in turn to the end of the  file.
               The  filename  in  quotes, followed by the line count and character count is echoed on the user's
               terminal.

       <b>saveignore</b>
               <b>saveignore</b> is to <b>save</b> what <b>ignore</b> is to <b>print</b> and <b>type</b>.  Header fields thus marked  are  filtered
               out when saving a message by <b>save</b> or when automatically saving to <u>mbox</u>.

       <b>saveretain</b>
               <b>saveretain</b>  is  to <b>save</b> what <b>retain</b> is to <b>print</b> and <b>type</b>.  Header fields thus marked are the only
               ones saved with a message when saving by <b>save</b> or when automatically saving to  <u>mbox</u>.   <b>saveretain</b>
               overrides <b>saveignore</b>.

       <b>set</b>     (<b>se</b>)  With  no  arguments, prints all variable values.  Otherwise, sets option.  Arguments are of
               the form <u>option=value</u> (no space before or after =) or <u>option</u>.   Quotation  marks  may  be  placed
               around any part of the assignment statement to quote blanks or tabs, i.e., <b>set</b> <b>indentprefix="-&gt;"</b>.

       <b>shell</b>   (<b>sh</b>) Invokes an interactive version of the shell.

       <b>size</b>    Takes a message list and prints out the size in characters of each message.

       <b>source</b>  The <b>source</b> command reads commands from a file.

       <b>top</b>     Takes  a  message  list  and  prints  the  top few lines of each.  The number of lines printed is
               controlled by the variable <b>toplines</b> and defaults to five.

       <b>Type</b>    (<b>T</b>) Identical to the <b>Print</b> command.

       <b>type</b>    (<b>t</b>) A synonym for <b>print</b>.

       <b>unalias</b>
               Takes a list of names defined by <b>alias</b> commands and discards the remembered groups of users.  The
               group names no longer have any significance.

       <b>undelete</b>
               (<b>u</b>) Takes a message list and marks each message as not being deleted.

       <b>unread</b>  (<b>U</b>) Takes a message list and marks each message as not having been read.

       <b>unset</b>   Takes a list of option names and discards their remembered values; the inverse of <b>set</b>.

       <b>visual</b>  (<b>v</b>) Takes a message list and invokes the display editor on each message.

       <b>write</b>   (<b>w</b>) Similar to <b>save</b>, except that <b>only</b> the message body (without the header) is saved.   Extremely
               useful for such tasks as sending and receiving source program text over the message system.

       <b>xit</b>     (<b>x</b>) A synonym for <b>exit</b>.

       <b>z</b>       <b>mail</b> presents message headers in windowfuls as described under the <b>headers</b> command.  You can move
               <b>mail</b>'s  attention  forward  to  the  next  window  with the <b>z</b> command.  Also, you can move to the
               previous window by using <b>z-</b>.

   <b>Tilde/escapes</b>
       Here is a summary of the tilde escapes, which  are  used  when  composing  messages  to  perform  special
       functions.   Tilde  escapes  are  only  recognized at the beginning of lines.  The name “tilde escape” is
       somewhat of a misnomer since the actual escape character can be set by the option <b>escape</b>.

       <b>~b</b><u>name</u> <u>...</u>
               Add the given names to the list of carbon copy recipients but do not make the  names  visible  in
               the Cc: line ("blind" carbon copy).

       <b>~c</b><u>name</u> <u>...</u>
               Add the given names to the list of carbon copy recipients.

       <b>~d</b>      Read the file <u>dead.letter</u> from your home directory into the message.

       <b>~e</b>      Invoke  the  text editor on the message collected so far.  After the editing session is finished,
               you may continue appending text to the message.

       <b>~F</b><u>messages</u>
               Identical to <b>~f</b>, except all message headers are included.

       <b>~f</b><u>messages</u>
               Read the named messages into the message being sent.  If no messages are specified, read  in  the
               current  message.   Message headers currently being ignored (by the <b>ignore</b> or <b>retain</b> command) are
               not included.

       <b>~h</b>      Edit the message header fields by typing each one in turn and allowing the user to append text to
               the end or modify the field by using the current terminal erase and kill characters.

       <b>~M</b><u>messages</u>
               Identical to <b>~m</b>, except all message headers are included.

       <b>~m</b><u>messages</u>
               Read the named messages into the message being sent, indented  by  a  tab  or  by  the  value  of
               <u>indentprefix</u>.  If no messages are specified, read the current message.  Message headers currently
               being ignored (by the <b>ignore</b> or <b>retain</b> command) are not included.

       <b>~p</b>      Print out the message collected so far, prefaced by the message header fields.

       <b>~q</b>      Abort  the  message being sent, copying the message to <u>dead.letter</u> in your home directory if <b>save</b>
               is set.
       <b>~R</b><u>string</u>
               Use <u>string</u> as the Reply-To field.

       <b>~r</b><u>filename</u>
       <b>~&lt;</b><u>filename</u>
               Read the named file into the message.

       <b>~s</b><u>string</u>
               Cause the named string to become the current subject field.

       <b>~t</b><u>name</u> <u>...</u>
               Add the given names to the direct recipient list.

       <b>~v</b>      Invoke an alternate editor (defined by the VISUAL  option)  on  the  message  collected  so  far.
               Usually, the alternate editor will be a screen editor.  After you quit the editor, you may resume
               appending text to the end of your message.

       <b>~w</b><u>filename</u>
               Write the message onto the named file.

       <b>~x</b>      Abort the message being sent.  No message is copied to <u><a href="file:~/dead.letter">~/dead.letter</a></u>, even if <b>save</b> is set.

       <b>~?</b>      Prints a brief summary of tilde escapes.

       <b>~!</b><u>command</u>
               Execute the indicated shell command, then return to the message.

       <b>~|</b><u>command</u>
               Pipe  the  message through the command as a filter.  If the command gives no output or terminates
               abnormally, retain the original text of the message.  The command <u><a href="../man1/fmt.1.html">fmt</a></u>(1) is often used as <b>command</b>
               to rejustify the message.

       <b>~:</b><u>mail-command</u>
       <b>~_</b><u>mail-command</u>
               Execute the given mail command.  Not all commands, however, are allowed.

       <b>~~</b><u>string</u>
               Insert the string of text in the message prefaced by a single ~.  If you have changed the  escape
               character, then you should double that character in order to send it.

       <b>~.</b>      Simulate end of file on input.

   <b>Mail</b> <b>options</b>
       A  number of options can be set in the <u>.mailrc</u> file to alter the behavior of <b>mail</b>, controlled via the <b>set</b>
       and <b>unset</b> commands.  Options may be either binary, in which case it is only significant  to  see  whether
       they  are  set  or  not;  or  string,  in which case the actual value is of interest.  The binary options
       include the following:

       <u>append</u>  Causes messages saved in <u>mbox</u> to be appended to the  end  rather  than  prepended.   This  should
               always be set (perhaps in <u>/etc/mail.rc</u>).

       <u>ask</u>, <u>asksub</u>
               Causes <b>mail</b> to prompt you for the subject of each message you send.  If you respond with simply a
               newline, no subject field will be sent.

       <u>askbcc</u>  Causes you to be prompted for additional blind carbon copy recipients at the end of each message.
               Responding with a newline indicates your satisfaction with the current list.

       <u>askcc</u>   Causes  you  to  be  prompted  for  additional carbon copy recipients at the end of each message.
               Responding with a newline indicates your satisfaction with the current list.

       <u>autoinc</u>
               Causes new mail to be automatically incorporated when it arrives.  Setting  this  is  similar  to
               issuing  the  <b>inc</b>  command  at each prompt, except that the current message is not reset when new
               mail arrives.

       <u>autoprint</u>
               Causes the <b>delete</b> command to behave like <b>dp</b>; thus, after deleting a message, the next one will be
               typed automatically.

       <u>debug</u>   Setting the binary option <u>debug</u> is the same as specifying <b>-d</b> on the command line and causes  <b>mail</b>
               to output all sorts of information useful for debugging <b>mail</b>.

       <u>dot</u>     The  binary  option  <u>dot</u> causes <b>mail</b> to interpret a period alone on a line as the terminator of a
               message you are sending.

       <u>expandaddr</u>
               Causes <b>mail</b> to expand message recipient addresses, as explained in the section “Recipient address
               specifications”.

       <u>from</u>    Causes <b>mail</b> to use the specified sender address in the “From:” field of the  message  header.   A
               stripped down version of the address is also used in the message envelope.  If unset, the message
               will  not  include  an  explicit  sender  address  and  a default value will be added by the MTA,
               typically “user@host”.  This value can be overridden by specifying the <b>-r</b>  flag  on  the  command
               line.

       <u>hold</u>    This option is used to hold messages in the system mailbox by default.

       <u>ignore</u>  Causes interrupt signals from your terminal to be ignored and echoed as @'s.

       <u>ignoreeof</u>
               An option related to <u>dot</u> is <u>ignoreeof</u> which makes <b>mail</b> refuse to accept a control-D as the end of
               a message.  <u>ignoreeof</u> also applies to <b>mail</b> command mode.

       <u>keep</u>    Setting  this option causes <b>mail</b> to truncate your system mailbox instead of deleting it when it's
               empty.

       <u>keepsave</u>
               Messages saved with the <b>save</b> command are not normally saved in  <u>mbox</u>  at  quit  time.   Use  this
               option to retain those messages.

       <u>metoo</u>   Usually,  when  a  group  is  expanded  that  contains the sender, the sender is removed from the
               expansion.  Setting this option causes the sender to be included in the group.

       <u>noheader</u>
               Setting the option <u>noheader</u> is the same as giving the <b>-N</b> flag on the command line.

       <u>nosave</u>  Normally, when you abort a message with two interrupt characters (usually control-C), <b>mail</b> copies
               the partial letter to the file <u>dead.letter</u> in your home directory.   Setting  the  binary  option
               <u>nosave</u> prevents this.

       <u>quiet</u>   Suppresses the printing of the version when first invoked.

       <u>Replyall</u>
               Reverses the sense of <b>reply</b> and <b>Reply</b> commands.

       <u>searchheaders</u>
               If  this  option  is  set,  then  a  message-list specifier in the form “/x:y” will expand to all
               messages containing the substring ‘y’ in the  header  field  ‘x’.   The  string  search  is  case
               insensitive.  If ‘x’ is omitted, it will default to the “Subject” header field.  The form “/to:y”
               is a special case, and will expand to all messages containing the substring ‘y’ in the “To”, “Cc”
               or  “Bcc”  header  fields.   The check for “to” is case sensitive, so that “/To:y” can be used to
               limit the search for ‘y’ to just the “To:” field.

       <u>skipempty</u>
               Don't send messages with an empty body.

       <u>verbose</u>
               Setting the option <u>verbose</u> is the same as using the <b>-v</b> flag on the command line.  When <b>mail</b>  runs
               in verbose mode, the actual delivery of messages is displayed on the user's terminal.

   <b>Option</b> <b>string</b> <b>values</b>
       EDITOR        Pathname  of  the  text  editor  to use in the <b>edit</b> command and <b>~e</b> escape.  If not defined,
                     <u><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?ex">/usr/bin/ex</a></u> is used.

       LISTER        Pathname of the directory lister to use in the <b>folders</b> command.  Default is <u><a href="file:/bin/ls">/bin/ls</a></u>.

       MBOX          The name of the <u>mbox</u> file.  It can be the name of a folder.  The default is “<b>mbox</b>”  in  the
                     user's home directory.

       PAGER         Pathname  of  the  program to use in the <b>more</b> command or when the <u>crt</u> variable is set.  The
                     default paginator <u><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></u>(1) is used if this option is not defined.

       REPLYTO       If set, will be used to initialize the Reply-To field for outgoing messages.

       SHELL         Pathname of the shell to use in the <b>!</b> command and the <b>~!</b> escape.  A default shell  is  used
                     if this option is not defined.

       VISUAL        Pathname  of  the  text editor to use in the <b>visual</b> command and <b>~v</b> escape.  If not defined,
                     <u><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?vi">/usr/bin/vi</a></u> is used.

       <u>crt</u>           The valued option <u>crt</u> is used as a threshold to determine how long a message must be before
                     PAGER is used to read it.  If <u>crt</u> is set without a value, then the height of  the  terminal
                     screen stored in the system is used to compute the threshold (see <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1)).

       <u>escape</u>        If defined, the first character of this option gives the character to use in the place of ~
                     to denote escapes.

       <u>folder</u>        The name of the directory to use for storing folders of messages.  If this name begins with
                     a  ‘/’,  <b>mail</b>  considers  it to be an absolute pathname; otherwise, the folder directory is
                     found relative to your home directory.

       <u>indentprefix</u>  String used by the <b>~m</b> tilde escape for indenting messages,  in  place  of  the  normal  tab
                     character (‘^I’).  Be sure to quote the value if it contains spaces or tabs.

       <u>record</u>        If  defined,  gives  the  pathname  of  the  file used to record all outgoing mail.  If not
                     defined, then outgoing mail is not so saved.

       <u>screen</u>        Size of window of message headers for <b>z</b>.

       <u>sendmail</u>      Pathname to an alternative mail delivery system.

       <u>toplines</u>      If defined, gives the number of lines of a message to be printed out with the <b>top</b>  command;
                     normally, the first five lines are printed.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mail</b> utilizes the HOME, LOGNAME, USER, SHELL, DEAD, PAGER, LISTER, EDITOR, VISUAL, REPLYTO, MAIL, MAILRC,
       and MBOX environment variables.

       If the MAIL environment variable is set, its value is used as the path to the user's mail spool.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/var/mail/">/var/mail/</a>*</u>                      post office (unless overridden by the MAIL environment variable)
       <u><a href="file:~/mbox">~/mbox</a></u>                           user's old mail
       <u><a href="file:~/.mailrc">~/.mailrc</a></u>                        file  giving  initial  mail  commands;  can be overridden by setting the
                                        MAILRC environment variable
       <u>/tmp/R*</u>                          temporary files

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>mailx</b> utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”) specification.

       The flags [<b>-iNnu</b>] are marked by IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”) as being optional.

       The flags [<b>-eFH</b>] are marked by IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (“POSIX.1”) as being optional, and are not  supported
       by this implementation of <b>mailx</b>.

       The flags [<b>-abcdEIrv</b>] are extensions to the specification.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       A  <b>mail</b> command appeared in Version 1 AT&amp;T UNIX.  This man page is derived from the <u>Mail</u> <u>Reference</u> <u>Manual</u>
       originally written by Kurt Shoens.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Usually, <b>Mail</b> and <b>mailx</b> are just links to <b>mail</b>, which can be confusing.
