       imapfilter — mail filter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>imapfilter</b>   [<b>-inVv</b>]   [<b>-c</b>   <u>configfile</u>]   [<b>-d</b>  <u>debugfile</u>]  [<b>-e</b>  <u>'command'</u>]  [<b>-l</b>  <u>logfile</u>]  [<b>-p</b>  <u>pidfile</u>]
                  [<b>-t</b> <u>truststore</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>imapfilter</b> is a mail filtering utility. It connects to remote mail servers  using  the  Internet  Message
       Access  Protocol  (IMAP),  sends  searching  queries  to  the server and processes mailboxes based on the
       results. It can be used to delete, copy, move, flag, etc. messages residing in mailboxes at the  same  or
       different mail servers. The 4rev1 and 4 versions of the IMAP protocol are supported.

       The command line options of <u><a href="../man1/imapfilter.1.html">imapfilter</a></u>(1) are as follows:

       <b>-c</b> <u>configfile</u>
               Path  to  the configuration file to read, or the ‘-’ character to read the configuration from the
               standard input stream.  The default is <u>$HOME/.imapfilter/config.lua</u>.

       <b>-d</b> <u>debugfile</u>
               File that contains debugging information about the full communication with the server, along with
               other inner workings' details.

       <b>-e</b> <u>'command'</u>
               May be used to enter “one line” of configuration, while it  is  also  possible  to  pipe  a  full
               configuration as a string.  When this option is used, a configuration file will not be loaded.

       <b>-i</b>      Enters interactive mode after executing the configuration file.

       <b>-l</b> <u>logfile</u>
               File that contains logs of error messages produced.

       <b>-n</b>      This  option  enables the so called dry-run mode, and any actions that would result in changes to
               the server do not actually take place. So the requests that would modify any data are not sent to
               the server, even though informational messages about these actions are still printed.

               Any other methods, that only receive data from the server, are performed as normal, such  as  for
               example  the  searching  methods.  Note,  that the number of messages an action is reported to be
               applied upon, might differ between dry-run mode and the normal execution, and this is expected as
               in the latter case the data on the server are continuously altered by subsequent actions.

       <b>-t</b> <u>truststore</u>
               The path to the system's SSL CA TrustStore directory or file. SSL connections will  be  validated
               using  the  CA  certificates  found in this directory or file, and when this is not possible, the
               local  <u>$HOME/.imapfilter/certificates</u>  file  will  be  used.   The  default   CA   directory   is
               <u><a href="file:/etc/ssl/certs/">/etc/ssl/certs/</a></u>, and the default CA file is <u>/etc/ssl/cert.pem</u>.

       <b>-p</b> <u>pidfile</u>
               Write the process ID (PID) to this file on startup, and delete it on exit.

       <b>-V</b>      Displays version and copyright information.

       <b>-v</b>      Enables printing of some brief details of the communication with the server.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       HOME    User's home directory.

       IMAPFILTER_HOME
               Program's configuration directory, which overrides the default <u>$HOME/.imapfilter/</u>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$HOME/.imapfilter/config.lua</u>
               Default  configuration file. Because this file may contain sensitive data such as user passwords,
               the recommended permissions are read/write for the user, and not accessible by others.

       <u>$HOME/.imapfilter/certificates</u>
               File where the SSL certificates are stored.
