</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  binary is used to send all kinds of mail to mlmmj managed mailinglists, but can potentially be used
       standalone for sending mails.

       The only option that is not self explanatory is the <b>-l</b> list control option:

              '1' means 'send a single mail'

              This is used together with <b>-F</b> and <b>-T</b> to send one mail to one recipient.

              '2' means 'mail to moderators'

              Used for sending mails to the moderators of a list.

              '3' means 'resend failed list mail'

              '4' means 'send to file with recipients'

              '5' means 'bounceprobe'

              '6' means 'single listmail to single recipient'

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page is very scarce documentation of the mlmmj-send binary. The reason for this is that  it's
       really  not  supposed to be used by any human, but only supposed to be invoked from other mlmmj binaries.
       So in case more documentation is needed, please read the source.
