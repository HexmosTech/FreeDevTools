</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mailutil</b> replaces the old chkmail, imapcopy, imapmove, imapxfer, mbxcopy, mbxcreat, and mbxcvt programs.

       <b>mailutil</b>  <b>check</b>  determines  whether  new  mail  exists in the given mailbox (the default is INBOX).  The
       number of new messages is defined as the number of messages  that  have  "Recent"  status  set.   If  the
       mailbox contains no new messages, <b>mailutil</b> <b>check</b> will indicate that no new mail is present; otherwise, it
       will  report the number of new messages.  In either case, it will also indicate the canonical form of the
       name of the mailbox.

       <b>mailutil</b> <b>create</b> creates a new <u>mailbox</u> with the given name.  The mailbox name must not already  exist.   A
       mailbox can be created in a particular format by prefixing the name with <u>#driver.</u>  followed by the format
       name and a <u>/</u> character.  For example, the command
          mailutil create #driver.mbx/junkmail
       will create a new mailbox named "junkmail" in mbx format.

       <b>mailutil</b> <b>delete</b> deletes an existing <u>mailbox</u> with the given name.

       <b>mailutil</b>  <b>rename</b>  renames  an  existing  mailbox to a new name (which must not already exist).  This only
       works if the old and new names are in the same mail store.  A more general means to rename a  mailbox  is
       to do a <b>mailutil</b> <b>copy</b> of the old name to the new name, followed by a <b>mailutil</b> <b>delete</b> of the old name.

       <b>mailutil</b>  <b>copy</b>  creates a new mailbox and copies messages from the old mailbox to the new mailbox.  As in
       <b>mailutil</b> <b>create</b> a mailbox format can be specified with the new mailbox.  For example, the command
          mailutil copy INBOX #driver.mbx/INBOX
       will copy messages from your existing INBOX to an mbx-format INBOX.

       <b>mailutil</b> <b>move</b> is similar to <b>mailutil</b> <b>copy</b> but in addition will  also  remove  (delete  and  expunge)  the
       messages from the old mailbox after copying them to the new mailbox.

       <b>mailutil</b>  <b>append</b>  and  <b>mailutil</b>  <b>appenddelete</b> are similar to <b>mailutil</b> <b>copy</b> and <b>mailutil</b> <b>move</b> respectively
       except that they do not create the destination mailbox.

       <b>mailutil</b> <b>prune</b> prunes the mailbox of messages which match certain criteria, which  are  in  the  form  of
       IMAP2 (RFC 1176) SEARCH arguments.  For example, the command.
         mailutil prune INBOX "before 1-jan-2004"
       will delete and expunge all messages written before January 1, 2004.

       Note  that mailutil implements pruning by deleting the matching messages, and then expunging the mailbox.
       Consequently, mailutil will also expunge any messages which were deleted at the time of the pruning.

       <b>mailutil</b> <b>transfer</b> copies an entire hierarchy of mailboxes from the named source to the named destination.
       Mailboxes are created on the destination as needed.   Any  error  in  copying  messages  will  cause  the
       transfer to stop.

       Normally,  any  error in creation will cause the transfer to stop.  However, if <b>-m</b> <b>MODE</b> or <b>-merge</b> <b>MODE</b> is
       specified, a merging transfer is performed.  The <b>MODE</b> argument indicats the type of merge:

       <b>-m[erge]</b> <b>prompt</b> indicates that the user should be asked for an alternative name to create.   If  creating
       the new name fails, the user will be asked again.

       <b>-m[erge]</b> <b>append</b> indicates that it's alright to copy the messages into an existing mailbox with that name.
       If the mailbox does not exist, the user will be prompted for an alternative name.

       <b>-m[erge]</b>  <b>suffix=XXXX</b>  where  XXXX  is  any string, indicates that an alternative name should be built by
       appending the given suffix to the name.  It that alternative name can't be created, then the user will be
       prompted for an alternative name.

       The source hierarchy consists of all mailboxes  which  start  with  the  given  source  name.   With  the
       exception  of  a remote system specification (within "{}" braces), the source name is used as the name of
       the destination.  The destination hierarchy is a prefix applied to any  new  names  being  created.   For
       example,
          mailutil transfer foo bar
       will  copy  all  mailboxes  with names beginning with "foo" to names beginning with "bar" (hence "foobar"
       will be copied to "barfoobar").  Similarly,
          mailutil transfer "{imap.foo.com}" "{imap.bar.com}old/"
       will copy all mailboxes from the imap.foo.com IMAP server to equivalent names starting with "old/" on the
       imap.bar.com IMAP server.

</pre><h4><b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>-d</b> or <b>-debug</b> flag prints full debugging telemetry including protocol operations.

       The <b>-v</b> or <b>-verbose</b> flag prints verbose (non-error) telemetry.

       The <b>-u</b> <b>USERID</b> or <b>-user</b> <b>USERID</b> switch attempts to become the indicated user.  This is for the  benefit  of
       system  administrators  who  want to do mailutil operations on a userid that does not normally have shell
       access.

       The <b>-rw</b> or <b>-rwcopy</b> flag causes the source mailbox to be open in readwrite mode rather than readonly mode.
       Normally, mailutil tries to use readonly mode to avoid altering any flags in the source mailbox, but some
       mailbox types, e.g.  POP3, can't be open in readonly mode.

       The <b>-kw</b> or <b>-kwcopy</b> flag causes the keywords of the source  mailbox  to  be  created  in  the  destination
       mailbox.   Normally,  mailutil does not create keywords in the destination mailbox so only those keywords
       that are already defined in the destination mailbox will be preserved.  Note that some IMAP  servers  may
       automatically create keywords, so this flag may not be necessary.

       The <b>-ig</b> or <b>-ignore</b> flag causes the keywords of the source mailbox to be ignored completely and no attempt
       is made to copy them to the destination mailbox.

       The <b>-ig[nore]</b> and <b>-kw[copy]</b> flags are mutually exclusive.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The  arguments  are  standard  c-client  mailbox  names.   A variety of mailbox name formats and types of
       mailboxes are supported by c-client; examples of the most common forms of names are:

       Name           <u>Meaning</u>

       INBOX          primary incoming mail folder on the local system

       archive/tx-project
                      mail folder  named  "tx-project"  in  "archive"  subdirectory  of  local  filesystem  home
                      directory

       {imapserver.foo.com}INBOX
                      primary incoming mail folder on IMAP server system "imapserver.foo.com"

       {imapserver.foo.com}archive/tx-project
                      mail   folder   named  "tx-project"  in  "archive"  subdirectory  on  IMAP  server  system
                      "imapserver.foo.com"

       #news.comp.mail.misc

       {newserver.foo.com/nntp}comp.mail.misc
                      newsgroup "comp.mail.misc" on NNTP server system "newserver.foo.com"

       {popserver.foo.com/pop3}
                      mail folder on POP3 server system "popserver.foo.com"

       system.
