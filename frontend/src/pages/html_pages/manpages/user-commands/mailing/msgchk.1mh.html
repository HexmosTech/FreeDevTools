       msgchk - nmh's check for incoming email

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>msgchk</b> [<b>-help</b>] [<b>-version</b>] [<b>-date</b> | <b>-nodate</b>] [<b>-notify</b> all/mail/nomail ] [<b>-nonotify</b> all/mail/nomail ]
            [<b>-host</b> <u>hostname</u>] [<b>-port</b> <u>portname/number</u>] [<b>-user</b> <u>username</u>] [<b>-sasl</b> | <b>-nosasl</b>] [<b>-saslmech</b> <u>mechanism</u>]
            [<b>-tls</b>] [<b>-initialtls</b>] [<b>-notls</b>] [<b>-certverify</b> | <b>-nocertverify</b>] [<b>-authservice</b> <u>service</u>] [<b>-snoop</b>] [<u>users</u>
            ... ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>msgchk</b> program checks all known mail drops for mail waiting for you.  For those drops which have mail
       for you, <b>msgchk</b> will indicate if it believes that you have seen the mail in question before.

       The  <b>-notify</b> <u>type</u> switch indicates under what circumstances <b>msgchk</b> should produce a message.  The default
       is <b>-notify</b> <u>all</u> which says that <b>msgchk</b> should always report the status of  the  users  mail  drop.   Other
       values  for  `type'  include `mail' which says that <b>msgchk</b> should report the status of waiting mail; and,
       `nomail' which says that <b>msgchk</b> should report the status of empty mail drops.  The <b>-nonotify</b> <u>type</u>  switch
       has  the  inverted sense, so <b>-nonotify</b> <u>all</u> directs <b>msgchk</b> to never report the status of mail drops.  This
       is useful if the user wishes to check <b>msgchk</b>'s exit status.  A non-zero exit status indicates  that  mail
       was <u>not</u> waiting for at least one of the indicated users.

       If <b>msgchk</b> produces output, then the <b>-date</b> switch directs <b>msgchk</b> to print out the last date mail was read,
       if this can be determined.

   <b>Using</b> <b>POP</b>
       <b>msgchk</b>  will  normally  check  all  the  local mail drops, but if the option “pophost:” is set in the mts
       configuration file “mts.conf”, or if the <b>-host</b> <u>hostname</u> switch is  given,  <b>msgchk</b>  will  query  this  POP
       service  host  as to the status of mail waiting.  The <b>-port</b> switch specifies the port name or number used
       to connect to the POP server.  If unspecified, the default is “pop3”.

       To specify a username for authentication with the  POP  server,  use  the  <b>-user</b>  <u>username</u>  switch.   The
       credentials profile entry in <u><a href="../man5/mh-profile.5.html">mh-profile</a></u>(5) describes the ways to supply a username and password.

       For  debugging purposes, there is also a switch <b>-snoop</b>, which will allow you to watch the POP transaction
       take place between you and the POP server.  If <b>-sasl</b> <b>-saslmech</b> <b>xoauth2</b> is used, the HTTP  transaction  is
       also shown.

       If  <b>nmh</b> has been compiled with SASL support, the <b>-sasl</b> switch will enable the use of SASL authentication.
       Depending on the SASL mechanism used, this may require an additional password prompt from the  user  (but
       the  <u>netrc</u>  file can be used to store this password, as described in <u><a href="../man5/mh-profile.5.html">mh-profile</a></u>(5).  The <b>-saslmech</b> switch
       can be used to select a particular SASL mechanism.

       If SASL authentication is successful, <b>msgchk</b> will attempt to  negotiate  a  security  layer  for  session
       encryption.   Encrypted  traffic  is  labelled  with `(encrypted)' and `(decrypted)' when viewing the POP
       transaction with the <b>-snoop</b> switch; see <u><a href="../man8/post.8.html">post</a></u>(8)'s description of <b>-snoop</b> for its other features.

       If <b>nmh</b> has been compiled with OAuth support,  the  <b>-sasl</b>  <b>-saslmech</b>  <b>xoauth2</b>  switch  will  enable  OAuth
       authentication.   The  <b>-user</b> switch must be used, and the <u>user-name</u> must be an email address the user has
       for the service, which must be specified with the <b>-authservice</b> <u>service</u> switch.  Before  using  this,  the
       user  must  authorize nmh by running <b>mhlogin</b> and grant authorization to that account.  See <u><a href="../man1/mhlogin.1.html">mhlogin</a></u>(1) for
       more details.

       If <b>nmh</b> has been compiled with TLS support, the <b>-tls</b> and <b>-initialtls</b> switches will require the negotiation
       of TLS when connecting to the remote POP server.  The <b>-tls</b> switch will  negotiate  TLS  as  part  of  the
       normal  POP protocol using the STLS command.  The <b>-initialtls</b> switch will negotiate TLS immediately after
       the connection has taken place, before any POP commands are sent or received.  Data encrypted by  TLS  is
       labeled  `(tls-encrypted)' and `(tls-decrypted)' with viewing the POP transaction with the <b>-snoop</b> switch.
       The <b>-notls</b> switch will disable all attempts to negotiate TLS.

       When using TLS the default is to verify the remote certificate and SubjectName against the local  trusted
       certificate  store.   This  can  be  controlled  by the <b>-certverify</b> and <b>-nocertverify</b> switches.  See your
       OpenSSL documentation for more information on certificate verification.
