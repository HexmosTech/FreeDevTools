</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mw - mutt-wizard - autoconfigure email accounts for neomutt and isync

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mw</b> [ <u>OPTIONS</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mw</b> takes a user email account and sets up a terminal-based email interface for it with <b>neomutt.</b>  This can
       include  offline  email  with  <b>isync/mbsync</b>  and  configs  for <b>msmtp</b> for sending mail, and also passwords
       automatically encrypted and stored with <b>pass.</b>

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b> <b><a href="mailto:your@email.com">your@email.com</a></b>
              add an email address

       <b>-l</b>     list all email accounts configured by mutt-wizard

       <b>-d</b>     pick an already configured account and remove its configuration

       <b>-D</b> <b><a href="mailto:your@email.com">your@email.com</a></b>
              remove a configured account without confirmation

       <b>-y</b> <b><a href="mailto:your@email.com">your@email.com</a></b>
              download and upload mail for an email account

       <b>-Y</b>     sync all email accounts

       <b>-t</b> <b>15</b>  toggle a cronjob that syncs your mail every 15 minutes (or any other number under 60)

       <b>-T</b>     toggle a cronjob without specifying minutes between sync

       <b>-r</b>     reorder account shortcut numbers

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>ADDING</b> <b>ACCOUNTS</b></h4><pre>
       These can be specified on the command line, otherwise, you will be prompted for what is necessary.  mutt-
       wizard  knows  the  IMAP/SMTP  server information for most email providers, so specifying them is usually
       redundant.

       <b>-u</b> <b>billy</b>
              Account logon/username if required and different from email address.

       <b>-n</b> <b>Billy</b>
              Real name which will appear in emails. Should be put in quotes if multiple words.

       <b>-m</b> <b>number</b>
              Set a maximum number of messages to be stored offline.

       <b>-i</b>     IMAP/POP server address

       <b>-I</b>     IMAP/POP server port (assumed to be 993 for IMAP and 995 for POP if not specified)

       <b>-s</b>     SMTP server address

       <b>-S</b>     SMTP server port (assumed to be 465 if not specified)

       <b>-x</b>     Account password. You will be prompted for the password interactively if this option is not given.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f</b>     Force account creation and guess mailboxes without attempting to connect to server.  Otherwise  if
              connection cannot be made, the configured account settings will not be persistent.

       <b>-o</b>     Create  settings  for an account to be used online only without mail syncing abilities. Without <b>-f</b>
              connection will still be attempted in setup to discover mailboxes.

       <b>-p</b>     Add a Protonmail account. Protonmail Bridge must be installed and set up.

       <b>-X</b>     When removing an email profile with either <u>-d</u> or <u>-D,</u> also delete the local mail (will  not  delete
              the mail on the server).

       <b>-P</b>     Use  POP  protocol  instead  of  IMAP.  Requires <u>mpop</u> to download mail after configuration. Server
              details can still be given with the <u>-i</u> and <u>-I</u> options as if it were a IMAP.

</pre><h4><b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mw-mailsync</b>
              mutt-wizard calls a script <u>mw-mailsync</u> to sync mail. This script  additionally  indexes  new  mail
              with  notmuch  and  gives  you  a  notification if new mail has arrived. If you want to bypass its
              additional features, you can always just run <u>mbsync</u> <u>-a</u> to sync your mail directly.

       <b>Mail</b> <b>location</b>
              If the user chooses to keep offline email with <b>isync,</b> it will  be  kept  in  <u><a href="file:~/.local/share/mail/.">~/.local/share/mail/.</a></u>
              <b>notmuch</b>  can  be  used  to  index and search this mail by giving this directory when first running
              <b>notmuch</b> <b>setup.</b>  If you have not set up notmuch before, mutt-wizard will automatically set it up in
              the background the first time you add an account.

       <b>muttrc</b> <b>files</b>
              mutt-wizard will create a muttrc file for each created account holding  account-specific  details.
              These  will  appear in <u><a href="file:~/.config/mutt/accounts/">~/.config/mutt/accounts/</a></u> and can be edited by the user if needbe. Note that
              the mutt-wizard will also source these files and create the bindings to switch between  them,  and
              these will appear in your default <u><a href="file:~/.config/mutt/muttrc">~/.config/mutt/muttrc</a></u> file.

       <b>Mail</b> <b>deletion</b>
              mutt-wizard's  delete  action  will  delete configuration files and <u>not</u> downloaded mail for safety
              (and time)'s sake. If you want to delete downloaded mail, do so manually by removing it  from  the
              directory above.

       <b>Default</b> <b>settings</b>
              The  mutt-wizard  has  many  default  settings  that focus on making it aesthetically pleasing and
              supplying more vim-like bindings. These can be found in  <u>/usr/share/mutt-wizard/mutt-wizard.muttrc</u>
              and  the  default  mailcap  file  can  be  found  in <u>/usr/share/mutt-wizard/mailcap.</u>  Any of these
              settings can be overwritten in <u><a href="file:~/.config/mutt/muttrc">~/.config/mutt/muttrc</a>,</u> but be mindful that  your  overriding  binds
              should appear after the <u>mutt-wizard.muttrc</u> file is sourced.

       <b>Detecting</b> <b>server</b> <b>settings</b>
              mutt-wizard   has   a   repository  of  email  services  and  their  server  information  kept  in
              <u>/usr/share/mutt-wizard/domains.csv</u> which is used to automatically configure  email  settings.   If
              your  email provider is not found there, it will prompt you to input your email service's IMAP and
              SMTP server information which can usually be found by searching online.

              If you would like to help develop mutt-wizard for others, you are  invited  to  add  this  service
              information  to  <u>domains.csv</u> on mutt-wizard's Github &lt;https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/mutt-wizard&gt;
              or Gitlab &lt;https://gitlab.com/lukesmithxyz/mutt-wizard&gt; pages.

       <b>Gmail</b> <b>accounts</b>
              Google will require you to allow "less-secure" (third party)  applications  or  remove  two-factor
              authentication  in  order to access their IMAP servers to download your mail. If you use Gmail, be
              sure         to         handle          this          before          running          mutt-wizard
              &lt;https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255&gt;.

       <b>Protonmail</b> <b>accounts</b>
              Protonmail  users  must use the Protonmail Bridge &lt;https://protonmail.com/bridge/&gt; to access their
              IMAP and SMTP servers. This too should be configured before running mutt-wizard.

       <b>Enterprise</b> <b>and</b> <b>university</b> <b>accounts</b>
              Many universities and businesses might host their domain's email via Google  or  another  service.
              This  often  requires a special IMAP/SMTP-specific password that you must generate and use. Again,
              mutt-wizard can handle these systems, but only once they've been set up.

       <b>Password</b> <b>decryption</b>
              mutt-wizard uses <u>pass</u> and therefore <u>gpg</u> to decrypt your passwords. Provided your  GPG  key  has  a
              password,  this might mean that you will be prompted for your GPG password the first time you sync
              or send mail in a session. Once your password is cached, it might also expire later as well.

              Because of this I strongly recommend the program <u>pam-gnupg</u>  &lt;https://github.com/cruegge/pam-gnupg&gt;
              which  automatically unlocks your GPG password on login and keeps it active, thus giving you, with
              mutt-wizard, secure access to all your email accounts on your system without ever having to  input
              a password.

              If  you  don't  want  to use this program, you can also increase the cache time of an inputted GPG
              password with the <u>default-cache-ttl</u> and <u>max-cache-ttl</u> variables in your <u>gpg-agent.conf.</u>

</pre><h4><b>MUTT-WIZARD'S</b> <b>NEOMUTT</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Here is a list of not only mutt-wizard's particular defaults, but what you need to get the  most  out  of
       email accounts configured with mutt-wizard.

       <b>Color</b>  The  mutt-wizard's  default  settings add color to messages in the index and color mail details to
              make them easier to see. New mail, in addition to being marked by the  typical  N,  will  also  be
              bold.

       <b>Movement</b> <b>with</b> <b>h/j/k/l</b>
              Use vim keys to move down <u>j</u> or up <u>k</u> in mail, while <u>l</u> opens mail, then the attachment view, then an
              attachment, while <u>h</u> is the reverse.  While mail is open, go to next or previous mail with <u>J</u> and <u>K.</u>
              In  the mail index, <u>d</u> and <u>u</u> go down and up by a half page and <u>gg</u> and <u>G</u> go to the very top and very
              bottom.

       <b>Search</b> <b>mail</b>
              If you have <b>notmuch</b> configured with your proper mail directory (see above), you may run <u>ctrl-f</u>  to
              search  for mail containing any given sequence.  Even without notmuch, <u>L</u> limits mail, showing only
              those with the given sequence in the subject while <u>A</u> shows all mail (same as limiting to "all").

       <b>Deleting</b> <b>mail</b>
              <u>D</u> deletes mail, while <u>U</u> undeletes it (type in mail number to get to deleted  mail).  Note  that  <u>S</u>
              saves  your mailbox, finalizing deletion. If you have a <u>Trash</u> box, deleted mail is moved there. If
              you want it to skip that and simply be deleted, comment out or remove the <u>set</u> <u>trash</u> line  in  that
              account's muttrc.

       <b>Send</b> <b>mail</b>
              <u>m</u>  creates  a  new  mail message; <u>r</u> replies to the selected message; <u>R</u> replies all to the selected
              message and <u>f</u> forwards the selected message.

       <b>Compose</b> <b>mail</b> <b>screen</b>
              Once you write mail and save the buffer you will be brought to the compose screen. Press <u>a</u> to  add
              attachments,  use  <u>s/t/c/b/d</u>  to  change  the subject/to/CC/BCC/description. Press <u>S</u> to change the
              signature/encryption. Press <u>y</u> to send the mail.

       <b>Saving</b> <b>and</b> <b>autocompleting</b> <b>email</b> <b>addresses</b> <b>with</b> <b>abook</b>
              Install the optional dependency abook and you will be able to save the sender's email address with
              <u>a.</u>  Once this is done, when you are typing in any email/contact prompt, you may press <u>Tab</u> to  find
              contacts  matching your input. Although abook is often used with mutt, it is also a useful program
              in its own right.

       <b>Switching</b> <b>and</b> <b>moving</b> <b>mail</b> <b>between</b> <b>mailboxes</b>
              The <u>g</u> key can be paired with several other keys to automatically  move  to  another  mailbox:  gi:
              Inbox;  gs: Sent; gd: Drafts; ga: Archive; gS: Spam; gj: Junk; gt: Trash. These bindings will only
              be present for accounts that have the boxes in question. Instead of <u>g,</u> you can  also  press  <u>C</u>  to
              copy mail or <u>M</u> to move mail to the same boxes.

       <b>Switching</b> <b>between</b> <b>accounts</b>
              mutt-wizard  can  configure  as many as nine accounts each numbered by the lowest available number
              when configured. Press <u>i</u> followed by an account's number to change to that account: i2,  i5,  etc.
              <u>ctrl-b</u> to open a menu to select a url you want to open in you browser.

       <b>Sidebar</b>
              mutt-wizard  enables the sidebar by default which displays your account's boxes with mail tallies.
              <u>B</u> will toggle the sidebar. Move up and down in it with <u>ctrl-k/j.</u>  Open a box with <u>ctrl-o.</u>

       <b>More</b> <b>information</b>
              Remember that you can press <u>?</u>  at any time in neomutt to  get  a  list  of  all  key-bindings  and
              functions. This list can also vary for different context menus.
