</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xlbiff - mail notification pop-up with configurable message scans

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xlbiff</b> [ <u>-option</u> ... ] [ <u>mail_file_or_imap_server</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Is  “you have mail” not quite enough detail?  Is a per-message notification too much?  Welcome to <b>xlbiff</b>,
       the X Literate Biff.

       <b>xlbiff</b> presents enough information to tell you: Is this new mail worth reading right now?  And  it  stops
       distracting you once you decide.

       <b>xlbiff</b>  waits  in  the  background,  monitoring  your mailbox file or IMAP server (or running your custom
       check-mail script).  When a new message arrives, it invokes the MH <b><a href="../man1/scan.1.html">scan</a></b>(1) command (or your custom  mail-
       scanning  script)  and  pops up a window with the output (typically the <u>From</u> and <u>Subject</u> line of each new
       message).  If more mail arrives, <b>xlbiff</b> scans again and resizes its preview window accordingly.

       Clicking the left mouse button anywhere in the window causes it to vanish.  It will also  vanish  if  the
       mailbox  becomes  empty.   <b>xlbiff</b>  stays  out of your way when there is no new mail and pops up only when
       something requests your attention.

       Features:
         • occupies no screen real estate until mail comes in
         • supports scripts for checking mail
         • has configurable screen location, color, and font
         • can notify by bell and/or keyboard LED
         • shows all new messages in one, easy-to-dismiss window
         • lets you click anywhere on it; no trying to select a tiny “x”

</pre><h4><b>GETTING</b> <b>STARTED</b></h4><pre>
       If your new mail arrives in a local mail file in the usual system directory:

           xlbiff

       If your mail file is in a different location, you will need to specify the filename:

           xlbiff <a href="file:~/Mailbox">~/Mailbox</a>

       If your mail is on an IMAP server, specify the server's name:

           xlbiff imap.example.com

       Whichever way you start xlbiff, if you have new mail, it should pop up a window displaying summary  lines
       for  the  new messages.  (If you don't have new mail, you won't see any window, which is how <b>xlbiff</b> tries
       to stay out of your way.)  The window will stay visible until you click it away or read the new mail.

       You may need an entry in <u><a href="file:~/.netrc">~/.netrc</a></u> to provide login credentials for the IMAP server of your mail provider.
       The format of this file is described in <b><a href="../man1/mailbox-preview.1.html">mailbox-preview</a></b>(1).

       When you have the correct options to <b>xlbiff</b> figured out,  you  will  probably  want  to  run  it  in  the
       background or start it at the beginning of your X session.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xlbiff</b>  accepts  all  of  the  standard  X Toolkit command line options along with the additional options
       listed below:

       <b>-file</b> <u>file_or_server_name</u>
               This option specifies the name of the file or IMAP server that should be monitored.  By  default,
               it watches file <a href="file:/var/mail/">/var/mail/</a><u>username</u>, where <u>username</u> is your login name.

               If  given  the  name  of an IMAP server, <b>xlbiff</b>, assisted by its default <u>checkCommand/scanCommand</u>
               script <b><a href="../man1/mailbox-preview.1.html">mailbox-preview</a></b>(1), will peek at your new messages on this server.

               The <b>-file</b> is optional; a non-option argument will be treated the same.

       <b>-bottom</b> This  option  tells  <b>xlbiff</b>  to  realize/unrealize()  the  output   window   instead   of   using
               XtPopup/down().   This has the effect of causing the window manager to reposition the window each
               time it pops up, and is useful for when you specify negative Y coordinates, i.e., at  the  bottom
               of the screen.  Running <b>xlbiff</b> in this situation without -bottom would cause new lines to run off
               the bottom edge of the screen.

       <b>+bottom</b> Opposite of -bottom.

       <b>-rows</b> <u>height</u>
               This option specifies the maximum height, in lines of text, of the <b>xlbiff</b> window.  The default is
               20.

       <b>-columns</b> <u>width</u>
               This option specifies the maximum width, in characters, of the <b>xlbiff</b> window.  The default is 80.

       <b>-resetSaver</b>
               If this option is set, <b>xlbiff</b> will reset the screen saver when new mail comes in.  This is useful
               if you're doing something near your workstation but not on it.

       <b>+resetSaver</b>
               Opposite of -resetSaver.

       <b>-update</b> <u>seconds</u>
               This  option  specifies  the frequency in seconds at which <b>xlbiff</b> should update its display.  The
               default is 15 seconds.

       <b>-fade</b> <u>seconds</u>
               Number of seconds to wait before popping window back down.  This option can be  used  to  monitor
               events  of  non-lasting  importance,  such  as  syslog.  The default value of 0 disables the <b>fade</b>
               option.

       <b>-led</b> <u>ledNum</u>
               This option specifies a keyboard LED to light up when there is mail waiting  in  the  <u>file.</u>   The
               default is zero (do not light a LED).

       <b>-ledPopdown</b>
               This  option  indicates that the LED should be turned off when xlbiff is popped down.  Ordinarily
               the LED stays lit to remind one of awaiting mail.  This option has no effect if the  -led  option
               is disabled.

       <b>+ledPopdown</b>
               Opposite of -ledPopdown.

       <b>-refresh</b> <u>seconds</u>
               This  option  specifies the number of seconds to wait before re-posting the mail window after you
               acknowledge it, and it still contains the same mail.  The default is 0 (no  refresh).   A  useful
               value for this is 1800 (30 minutes).

       <b>-mailerCommand</b> <u>command</u>
               Specifies  the command to invoke when the mailer() action, described below, is activated.  Due to
               mailbox consistency considerations, the mailerCommand should not exit before it is finished  with
               the mailbox, i.e., it should not run its command in the background.

               Example <b>mailerCommand</b> values:

                   xterm -e alpine
                   emacsclient --eval '(mh-rmail)' --suppress-output

               There is no default <b>mailerCommand</b>.

       <b>-scanCommand</b> <u>command</u>
               Specifies  a  shell  command  to be executed to list the contents of mailbox <b>file</b>.  The specified
               string value is used  as  the  argument  to  a  <b><a href="../man3/popen.3.html">popen</a></b>(3)  call  and  may  therefore  contain  I/O
               redirection.   The  command's  stdout is used to generate the window.  Internally, the command is
               generated as

                   sprintf(buf, scanCommand, file, columns, rows)

               so a %s, %d and %d respectively in <b>scanCommand</b> will generate the values  of  <b>file</b>,  <b>columns</b>,  and
               <b>rows</b>.  The default <b>scanCommand</b>, specified by the <u>XLbiff</u> application resources file, is

                   mailbox-preview %s --width %d --max-messages %d 2&gt;&amp;1

               If  a <b>scanCommand</b> is used to change the way the mailbox is accessed (as opposed to change the way
               the content is displayed), you will need to supply a compatible <b>checkCommand</b>.

       <b>-checkCommand</b> <u>command</u>
               Specifies a shell command to be executed to check for new mail (or some other  condition)  rather
               than  simply  examining  the  size  of  the mail file.  The specified string value is used as the
               argument to a <b><a href="../man3/popen.3.html">popen</a></b>(3) call, and the output generated is important.  Like <b>xbiff</b>, an  exit  status
               of
                • 0 indicates that a change in condition demands a new evaluation of scanCommand and subsequent
                popup,
                • 1 indicates no change in status, and
                • 2 indicates that the condition has been cleared and the <b>xlbiff</b> window should pop down.

               The default, specified by the <u>XLbiff</u> application resources file, is

                   mailbox-preview %s --check %d

               Similarly to scanCommand, the checkCommand is generated internally as

                   sprintf(buf, checkCommand, file, previous)

               <b>previous</b>  is  the  numeric  value output by the last time checkCommand was run, or zero the first
               time.  This is useful for allowing the checkCommand to maintain state.

               See the EXAMPLES section, below, for different ways to use checkCommand.

       <b>-volume</b> <u>percentage</u>
               This option specifies how loud the bell should be rung when new mail comes in.

       The following standard X Toolkit command line arguments are commonly used with <b>xlbiff</b>:

       <b>-display</b> <u>display</u>
               This option specifies the X server to contact.

       <b>-geometry</b> <u>+x+y</u>
               This option specifies the preferred position of the scan window.

       <b>-bg</b> <u>color</u>
               This option specifies the color to use for the background of the window.

       <b>-fg</b> <u>color</u>
               This option specifies the color to use for the foreground of the window.

       <b>-xrm</b> <u>resourcestring</u>
               This option specifies a resource string to be  used.   This  is  especially  useful  for  setting
               resources that do not have separate command line options.

       <b>-help</b>   This  option  indicates that a brief summary of the allowed options should be printed on standard
               output.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       The application class name is XLbiff.  It understands all of the core resource names and classes as  well
       as:

       <b>bottom</b> (class <b>Bottom</b>)
               Same as the <b>-bottom</b> option.

       <b>file</b> (class <b>File</b>)
               Same as the <b>-file</b> option.

       <b>mailerCommand</b> (class <b>MailerCommand</b>)
               Same as the <b>-mailerCommand</b> option.

       <b>scanCommand</b> (class <b>ScanCommand</b>)
               Same as the <b>-scanCommand</b> option.

       <b>checkCommand</b> (class <b>CheckCommand</b>)
               Same as the <b>-checkCommand</b> option.

       <b>resetSaver</b> (class <b>ResetSaver</b>)
               Same as the <b>-resetSaver</b> option.

       <b>update</b> (class <b>Interval</b>)
               Same as the <b>-update</b> option.

       <b>fade</b> (class <b>Fade</b>)
               Same as the <b>-fade</b> option.

       <b>columns</b> (class <b>Columns</b>)
               Same as the <b>-columns</b> option.

       <b>rows</b> (class <b>Rows</b>)
               Specifies the maximum height, in lines, of the <u>xlbiff</u> window.  The default is 20.

       <b>led</b> (class <b>Led</b>)
               Same as the <b>-led</b> option.

       <b>ledPopdown</b> (class <b>LedPopdown</b>)
               Same as the <b>-ledPopdown</b> option.

       <b>refresh</b> (class <b>Refresh</b>)
               Same as the <b>-refresh</b> option.

       <b>sound</b> (class <b>Sound</b>)
               Specify  a  command  to  be  run in place of a bell when new mail arrives.  For example, on a Sun
               Sparc you might use:

               *sound: /usr/demo/SOUND/play -v %d /usr/demo/SOUND/sounds/doorbell.au

               The command is generated internally with <b><a href="../man3/sprintf.3.html">sprintf</a></b>(3), so the characters “%d” will be replaced with
               the numeric value of the <b>volume</b> resource.

       <b>volume</b> (class <b>Volume</b>)
               Same as the <b>-volume</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xlbiff</b> provides the following actions for use in event translations:

       <b>popdown()</b>
               This action causes the window to vanish.

       <b>mailer()</b>
               This action causes <b>xlbiff</b> to pop down the main window and run the defined <b>mailerCommand</b> (if any),
               waiting for it to exit.  Then <b>xlbiff</b> will check for new mail, and if necessary pop up again.

       <b>exit()</b>  This action causes <b>xlbiff</b> to exit.

       The default translations are

           &lt;Button1Press&gt;:  popdown()
           &lt;Button2Press&gt;:  mailer()
           &lt;Button3Press&gt;:  exit()

</pre><h4><b>CUSTOMIZING</b></h4><pre>
       You may want to tweak some values in an app-defaults file and/or add some resources to your .Xdefaults or
       .Xresources file.  See the system app-defaults file <u>/etc/X11/app-defaults/XLbiff</u> for examples of what you
       can customize.

       You also probably want to tell your window manager not to put borders or titlebars or whatever around the
       <b>xlbiff</b> window.

       Note that an MH format file, <u>xlbiff.form</u>, is included.  This form
         • omits message number, which is meaningless in this context
         • omits message size, since <u>scan</u> <u>-file</u> can't figure it out
         • puts a “*” next to the message if your name is on the To: list (to distinguish from mailing lists and
         cc's)
         • displays the date in a friendly format
         • packs as much subject and body into one line as possible.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Bulk</b> <b>maildrops</b>
       <b>xlbiff</b> ships with two sample scripts, <u>Bcheck</u> and <u>Bscan</u>, intended to be used in  conjunction.   These  are
       for checking mail in “bulk” maildrops.  See <u>README.bulk</u> for more info.

   <b>Laptop</b> <b>fan</b> <b>speed</b>
       <b>xlbiff</b>  can  be  used  to  display  your laptop's temperature sensors only when the fan is running.  This
       example uses the <b><a href="../man1/sensors.1.html">sensors</a></b>(1) program as a scanCommand to display the sensor values.  To pop  up  the  info
       only when the laptop is hot, we can use a check command that extracts from the sensors output whether the
       fan is running and whether its speed has changed.  Here is a possible check script:

           fan1_speed=$(sensors | sed -E -n '/^fan/{s/.* ([0-9]+).*/\1/p;q}')
           echo "$fan1_speed"
           [ "$fan1_speed" = 0 ] &amp;&amp; exit 2
           [ "$fan1_speed" = "$1" ] &amp;&amp; exit 1
           exit 0

       If the script is called <u>xlbiff-fan-check.sh</u>, you can use it by running xlbiff like this:

           xlbiff -checkCommand 'xlbiff-fan-check.sh %d' -scanCommand sensors

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b> is used to get the default host and display number.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/var/mail/">/var/mail/</a>$USER</u>
               Default mail file to check.

       <u>/etc/X11/app-defaults/XLbiff</u>
               System  app-defaults file for X11 resources.  Override entries here in your own app-defaults file
               or your own <u><a href="file:~/.Xdefaults">~/.Xdefaults</a></u> or <u><a href="file:~/.Xresources">~/.Xresources</a></u> file.

       <u><a href="file:~/.netrc">~/.netrc</a></u>
               Login info for the IMAP server.  See <b><a href="../man1/mailbox-preview.1.html">mailbox-preview</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Specifying dimensions in <b>-geometry</b> causes badness.

       The <b>led</b> option does not work on Suns before SunOS 4.1/X11R5.
