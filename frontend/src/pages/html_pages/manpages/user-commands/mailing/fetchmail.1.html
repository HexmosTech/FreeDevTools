</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fetchmail - fetch mail from a POP, IMAP, ETRN, or ODMR-capable server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fetchmail</b> [<u>option...</u>] [<u>mailserver...</u>]
       <b>fetchmailconf</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fetchmail</b>  is  a  mail-retrieval  and  forwarding  utility;  it fetches mail from remote mail servers and
       forwards it to your local (client) machine's delivery system.  You can then  handle  the  retrieved  mail
       using  normal mail user agents such as <b><a href="../man1/mutt.1.html">mutt</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/elm.1.html">elm</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/Mail.1.html">Mail</a></b>(1).  The <b>fetchmail</b> utility can be run in a
       daemon mode to repeatedly poll one or more systems at a specified interval.

       The <b>fetchmail</b> program can gather mail from servers supporting any of the common mail-retrieval protocols:
       POP2 (legacy, to be removed from future release), POP3, IMAP2bis, IMAP4, and IMAP4rev1.  It can also  use
       the  ESMTP  ETRN  extension  and ODMR.  (The RFCs describing all these protocols are listed at the end of
       this manual page.)

       While <b>fetchmail</b> is primarily intended to be used over  on-demand  TCP/IP  links  (such  as  SLIP  or  PPP
       connections),  it  may  also  be  useful  as a message transfer agent for sites which refuse for security
       reasons to permit (sender-initiated) SMTP transactions with sendmail.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT,</b> <b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       For troubleshooting, tracing and debugging, you need to increase fetchmail's verbosity  to  actually  see
       what  happens. To do that, please run <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>following</b> <b>commands,</b> <b>adding</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>options</b> <b>you'd</b>
       <b>normally</b> <b>use.</b>

              env LC_ALL=C fetchmail -V -v --nodetach --nosyslog

              (This command line prints in English how fetchmail understands your configuration.)

              env LC_ALL=C fetchmail -vvv  --nodetach --nosyslog

              (This command line actually runs fetchmail with verbose English output.)

       Also see item #G3 in fetchmail's FAQ.

       You can omit the LC_ALL=C part above if you want output in the local language (if supported). However  if
       you  are posting to mailing lists, please leave it in. The maintainers do not necessarily understand your
       language, please use English.

</pre><h4><b>TLS</b> <b>(SSL)</b> <b>QUICKSTART</b></h4><pre>
       Your fetchmail distribution should have come with a README.SSL file, which see.   It  is  recommended  to
       configure  all polls with --ssl --sslproto tls1.2+ if supported by the server, which configures fetchmail
       along recent IETF proposed standards and best current practices, RFC-8314, RFC-8996, RFC-8997.

</pre><h4><b>CONCEPTS</b></h4><pre>
       If <b>fetchmail</b> is used with a POP or an IMAP server (but not with ETRN or ODMR),  it  has  two  fundamental
       modes of operation for each user account from which it retrieves mail: <u>singledrop</u>- and <u>multidrop</u>-mode.

       In singledrop-mode,
              <b>fetchmail</b>  assumes  that  all  messages  in the user's account (mailbox) are intended for a single
              recipient.  The identity of the  recipient  will  either  default  to  the  local  user  currently
              executing <b>fetchmail</b>, or will need to be explicitly specified in the configuration file.

              <b>fetchmail</b>  uses singledrop-mode when the fetchmailrc configuration contains at most a single local
              user specification for a given server account.

       In multidrop-mode,
              <b>fetchmail</b> assumes that the mail server account actually contains mail intended for any  number  of
              different recipients.  Therefore, <b>fetchmail</b> must attempt to deduce the proper "envelope recipient"
              from  the  mail  headers of each message.  In this mode of operation, <b>fetchmail</b> almost resembles a
              mail transfer agent (MTA).

              Note that neither the POP nor IMAP protocols were intended for use  in  this  fashion,  and  hence
              envelope  information is often not directly available. The ISP must store the envelope information
              in some message header <b>and</b>. The ISP must also store one copy of  the  message  per  recipient.  If
              either of the conditions is not fulfilled, this process is unreliable, because <b>fetchmail</b> must then
              resort  to  guessing  the  true envelope recipient(s) of a message. This usually fails for mailing
              list messages and Bcc:d mail, or mail for multiple recipients in your domain.

              <b>fetchmail</b> uses multidrop-mode when more than one local user and/or a wildcard is specified  for  a
              particular server account in the configuration file.

       In ETRN and ODMR modes,
              these  considerations  do not apply, as these protocols are based on SMTP, which provides explicit
              envelope recipient information. These protocols always support multiple recipients.

       As each message is retrieved, <b>fetchmail</b> normally delivers it via SMTP to port 25 on  the  machine  it  is
       running  on  (localhost),  just  as  though it were being passed in over a normal TCP/IP link.  <b>fetchmail</b>
       provides the SMTP server with an envelope recipient derived in the manner described previously.  The mail
       will then be delivered according to your MTA's rules (the Mail Transfer  Agent  is  usually  <b><a href="../man8/sendmail.8.html">sendmail</a></b>(8),
       <b><a href="../man8/exim.8.html">exim</a></b>(8),  or <b><a href="../man8/postfix.8.html">postfix</a></b>(8)).  Invoking your system's MDA (Mail Delivery Agent) is the duty of your MTA.  All
       the delivery-control mechanisms (such as <u>.forward</u> files) normally available through your system  MTA  and
       local delivery agents will therefore be applied as usual.

       If your fetchmail configuration sets a local MDA (see the --mda option), it will be used directly instead
       of talking SMTP to port 25.

       If  the  program  <b>fetchmailconf</b>  is available, it will assist you in setting up and editing a fetchmailrc
       configuration.  It runs under the X window system and requires  that  the  language  Python  and  the  Tk
       toolkit  (with  Python  bindings)  be  present on your system.  If you are first setting up fetchmail for
       single-user mode, it is recommended that you use Novice mode.  Expert mode provides complete  control  of
       fetchmail  configuration,  including the multidrop features.  In either case, the 'Autoprobe' button will
       tell you the most capable protocol a given mail server supports, and warn you of potential problems  with
       that server.

</pre><h4><b>PREFACE</b> <b>ON</b> <b>THIS</b> <b>MANUAL</b></h4><pre>
       Fetchmail's  run-time  strings have been translated (localized) to some languages, but the manual is only
       available in English.  In some situations, for comparing output to manual, it may be  helpful  to  switch
       fetchmail to English output by overriding the locale variables, for instance:

              env LC_ALL=C fetchmail # add other options before the hash

              env LANG=en fetchmail # other options before the hash

       or similar. Details vary by operating system.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  behavior  of <b>fetchmail</b> is controlled by command-line options and a run control file, <u><a href="file:~/.fetchmailrc">~/.fetchmailrc</a></u>,
       the syntax of which we describe in a later section (this file is what the <b>fetchmailconf</b>  program  edits).
       Command-line options override <u><a href="file:~/.fetchmailrc">~/.fetchmailrc</a></u> declarations.

       Each  server  name that you specify following the options on the command line will be queried.  If you do
       not specify any servers on the command line, each 'poll'  entry  in  your  <u><a href="file:~/.fetchmailrc">~/.fetchmailrc</a></u>  file  will  be
       queried, unless the idle option is used, which see.

       To  facilitate  the  use  of <b>fetchmail</b> in scripts and pipelines, it returns an appropriate exit code upon
       termination -- see EXIT CODES below.

       The following options modify the behavior of <b>fetchmail</b>.  It is seldom necessary to specify any  of  these
       once you have a working <u>.fetchmailrc</u> file set up.

       Almost all options have a corresponding keyword which can be used to declare them in a <u>.fetchmailrc</u> file.

       Some  special  options are not covered here, but are documented instead in sections on AUTHENTICATION and
       DAEMON MODE which follow.

   <b>General</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-?</b> <b>|</b> <b>--help</b>
              Displays option help.

       <b>-V</b> <b>|</b> <b>--version</b>
              Displays the version information for  your  copy  of  <b>fetchmail</b>.   No  mail  fetch  is  performed.
              Instead, for each server specified, all the option information that would be computed if <b>fetchmail</b>
              were  connecting  to that server is displayed.  Any non-printable characters in passwords or other
              string names are shown as back-slashed  C-like  escape  sequences.   This  option  is  useful  for
              verifying that your options are set the way you want them.

       <b>-c</b> <b>|</b> <b>--check</b>
              Return  a  status  code  to  indicate  whether there is mail waiting, without actually fetching or
              deleting mail (see EXIT CODES below).  This option turns off daemon mode (in  which  it  would  be
              useless).   It  does  not play well with queries to multiple sites, and does not work with ETRN or
              ODMR.  It will return a false positive if you leave read but undeleted mail in your server mailbox
              and your fetch protocol cannot tell kept messages from new ones.  This means  it  will  work  with
              IMAP, not work with POP2, and may occasionally flake out under POP3.

       <b>-s</b> <b>|</b> <b>--silent</b>
              Silent  mode.  Suppresses all progress/status messages that are normally echoed to standard output
              during a fetch (but does not suppress actual error  messages).   The  --verbose  option  overrides
              this.

       <b>-v</b> <b>|</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Verbose  mode.   All  control  messages passed between <b>fetchmail</b> and the mail server are echoed to
              stdout.  Overrides --silent.  Doubling this option (-v -v) causes extra diagnostic information  to
              be printed.

       <b>--nosoftbounce</b>
              (since v6.3.10, Keyword: set no softbounce, since v6.3.10)
              Hard  bounce  mode.  All  permanent delivery errors cause messages to be deleted from the upstream
              server, see "no softbounce" below.

       <b>--softbounce</b>
              (since v6.3.10, Keyword: set softbounce, since v6.3.10)
              Soft bounce mode. All permanent delivery errors cause messages to be left on the  upstream  server
              if  the  protocol  supports  that.   <b>This</b>  <b>option</b>  <b>is</b>  <b>on</b>  <b>by</b>  <b>default</b> <b>to</b> <b>match</b> <b>historic</b> <b>fetchmail</b>
              <b>documentation,</b> and will be changed to hard bounce mode in the next fetchmail release.

   <b>Disposal</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-a</b> <b>|</b> <b>--all</b> <b>|</b> <b>(since</b> <b>v6.3.3)</b> <b>--fetchall</b>
              (Keyword: fetchall, since v3.0)
              Retrieve both old (seen) and new messages from the mail server.  The  default  is  to  fetch  only
              messages  the  server  has  not  marked seen.  Under POP3, this option also forces the use of RETR
              rather than TOP.  Note that POP2 retrieval behaves as though --all is  always  on  (see  RETRIEVAL
              FAILURE  MODES  below)  and  this  option does not work with ETRN or ODMR.  While the -a and --all
              command-line and fetchall rcfile options have been supported  for  a  long  time,  the  --fetchall
              command-line option was added in v6.3.3.

       <b>-k</b> <b>|</b> <b>--keep</b>
              (Keyword: keep)
              Keep retrieved messages on the remote mail server.  Normally, messages are deleted from the folder
              on  the  mail  server after they have been retrieved.  Specifying the <b>keep</b> option causes retrieved
              messages to remain in your folder on the mail server.  This option does  not  work  with  ETRN  or
              ODMR. If used with POP3, it is recommended to also specify the --uidl option or uidl keyword.

       <b>-K</b> <b>|</b> <b>--nokeep</b>
              (Keyword: nokeep)
              Delete  retrieved  messages  from the remote mail server.  This option forces retrieved mail to be
              deleted.  It may be useful if you have specified a default of <b>keep</b>  in  your  <u>.fetchmailrc</u>.   This
              option is forced on with ETRN and ODMR.

       <b>-F</b> <b>|</b> <b>--flush</b>
              (Keyword: flush)
              POP3/IMAP  only.   This  is  a  dangerous  option and can cause mail loss when used improperly. It
              deletes old (seen) messages from the mail server before retrieving new  messages.   <b>Warning:</b>  This
              can  cause mail loss if you check your mail with other clients than fetchmail, and cause fetchmail
              to delete a message it had never fetched before.  It can also cause mail loss if the  mail  server
              marks the message seen after retrieval (IMAP2 servers). You should probably not use this option in
              your  configuration  file.  If  you  use  it  with  POP3, you must use the 'uidl' option. What you
              probably want  is  the  default  setting:  if  you  do  not  specify  '-k',  then  fetchmail  will
              automatically delete messages after successful delivery.

       <b>--limitflush</b>
              POP3/IMAP  only,  since  version  6.3.0.   Delete  oversized  messages from the mail server before
              retrieving new messages. The size limit should be separately specified with  the  --limit  option.
              This option does not work with ETRN or ODMR.

   <b>Protocol</b> <b>and</b> <b>Query</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-p</b> <b>&lt;proto&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--proto</b> <b>&lt;proto&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--protocol</b> <b>&lt;proto&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: proto[col])
              Specify  the  protocol  to  use when communicating with the remote mail server.  If no protocol is
              specified, the default is AUTO.  <b>proto</b> may be one of the following:

              AUTO   Tries IMAP, POP3, and POP2 (skipping any of these for which support has not  been  compiled
                     in).

              POP2   Post Office Protocol 2 (legacy, to be removed from future release)

              POP3   Post Office Protocol 3

              APOP   Use POP3 with old-fashioned MD5-challenge authentication.  Considered not resistant to man-
                     in-the-middle attacks.

              RPOP   Use POP3 with RPOP authentication.

              KPOP   Use POP3 with Kerberos V4 authentication on port 1109.

              SDPS   Use POP3 with Demon Internet's SDPS extensions.

              IMAP   IMAP2bis, IMAP4, or IMAP4rev1 (<b>fetchmail</b> automatically detects their capabilities).

              ETRN   Use the ESMTP ETRN option.

              ODMR   Use the On-Demand Mail Relay ESMTP profile.

       All  these  alternatives  work  in  basically the same way (communicating with standard server daemons to
       fetch mail already delivered to a mailbox on the server) except ETRN and ODMR.  The ETRN mode allows  you
       to  ask  a compliant ESMTP server (such as BSD sendmail at release 8.8.0 or higher) to immediately open a
       sender-SMTP connection to your client machine and begin forwarding any items  addressed  to  your  client
       machine  in  the  server's queue of undelivered mail.   The ODMR mode requires an ODMR-capable server and
       works similarly to ETRN, except that it does not require the client machine to have a static DNS.

       <b>-U</b> <b>|</b> <b>--uidl</b>
              (Keyword: uidl)
              Force UIDL use (effective only with POP3).  Force client-side tracking of  'newness'  of  messages
              (UIDL  stands  for  "unique  ID  listing"  and is described in RFC1939).  Use with 'keep' to use a
              mailbox as a baby news drop for a group of users. The fact  that  seen  messages  are  skipped  is
              logged,  unless  error  logging  is  done  through syslog while running in daemon mode.  Note that
              fetchmail may automatically enable this option depending on upstream  server  capabilities.   Note
              also  that  this option may be removed and forced enabled in a future fetchmail version. See also:
              --idfile.

       <b>--idle</b> <b>(since</b> <b>6.3.3)</b>
              (Keyword: idle, since before 6.0.0)
              Enable IDLE use (effective only with IMAP). Note that this works with only  one  account  and  one
              folder  at  a  given  time,  other  folders or accounts will not be polled when idle is in effect!
              While the idle rcfile keyword had been supported for a long time, the --idle  command-line  option
              was  added in version 6.3.3. IDLE use means that fetchmail tells the IMAP server to send notice of
              new messages, so they can be retrieved sooner than would be possible with regular polls.

       <b>-P</b> <b>&lt;portnumber&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--service</b> <b>&lt;servicename&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: service) Since version 6.3.0.
              The service option permits you to specify a service name to connect to.  You can specify a decimal
              port number here, if your services database lacks the required service-port assignments.  See  the
              FAQ item R12 and the --ssl documentation for details. This replaces the older --port option.

       Note  that  this  does not magically switch between TLS-wrapped and STARTTLS modes, if you specify a port
       number or service name here that is TLS-wrapped, meaning  it  starts  to  negotiate  TLS  before  sending
       application data in the clear, you may need to specify --ssl on the command line or ssl in your rcfile.

       <b>--port</b> <b>&lt;portnumber&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: port)
              Obsolete  version of --service that does not take service names.  <b>Note:</b> this option may be removed
              from a future version.

       <b>--principal</b> <b>&lt;principal&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: principal)
              The principal option permits you to specify a service principal for mutual  authentication.   This
              is  applicable to POP3 or IMAP with Kerberos 4 authentication only.  It does not apply to Kerberos
              5 or GSSAPI.  This option may be removed in a future fetchmail version.

       <b>-t</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--timeout</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: timeout)
              The timeout option allows you to set a server-non-response timeout in seconds.  If a  mail  server
              does not send a greeting message or respond to commands for the given number of seconds, <b>fetchmail</b>
              will  drop  the  connection  to  it.   Without  such  a timeout <b>fetchmail</b> might hang until the TCP
              connection times out, trying to fetch mail from a down host, which may be very long.   This  would
              be  particularly  annoying  for a <b>fetchmail</b> running in the background.  There is a default timeout
              which fetchmail -V will report.  If a given connection receives too many timeouts  in  succession,
              fetchmail  will  consider it wedged and stop retrying.  The calling user will be notified by email
              if this happens.

              Beginning with fetchmail 6.3.10, the SMTP  client  uses  the  recommended  minimum  timeouts  from
              RFC-5321 while waiting for the SMTP/LMTP server it is talking to.  You can raise the timeouts even
              more,  but  you cannot shorten them. This is to avoid a painful situation where fetchmail has been
              configured with a short timeout (a minute or less), ships a long  message  (many  MBytes)  to  the
              local  MTA,  which  then takes longer than timeout to respond "OK", which it eventually will; that
              would mean the mail gets delivered properly, but fetchmail cannot notice it and will thus re-fetch
              this big message over and over again.

       <b>--plugin</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: plugin)
              The plugin option allows you to use an external program to establish the TCP connection.  This  is
              useful if you want to use ssh, or need some special firewall setup.  The program will be looked up
              in  $PATH  and  can  optionally  be passed the host name and port as arguments using "%h" and "%p"
              respectively (note that the interpolation logic is rather primitive,  and  these  tokens  must  be
              bounded  by  whitespace  or  beginning  of  string or end of string).  Fetchmail will write to the
              plugin's stdin and read from the plugin's stdout.

       <b>--plugout</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: plugout)
              Identical to the plugin option above, but this one is used for the SMTP connections.

       <b>-r</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--folder</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: folder[s])
              Causes a specified non-default mail folder on the mail server (or comma-separated list of folders)
              to be retrieved.  The syntax of the folder name is server-dependent.  This option is not available
              under POP3, ETRN, or ODMR.

       <b>--tracepolls</b>
              (Keyword: tracepolls)
              Tell fetchmail to poll trace information in the form 'polling account %s' and 'folder %s'  to  the
              Received  line  it  generates, where the %s parts are replaced by the user's remote name, the poll
              label, and the folder (mailbox) where available (the Received header also  normally  includes  the
              server's  true  name).   This  can be used to facilitate mail filtering based on the account it is
              being received from. The folder information is written only since version 6.3.4.

       <b>--ssl</b>  (Keyword: ssl)
              Causes the connection to the mail server to be encrypted via  SSL,  by  negotiating  SSL  directly
              after  connecting  (called  SSL-wrapped  mode,  or  Implicit  TLS  by  RFC-8314).   Please see the
              description of --sslproto below!  More information is available in the <u>README.SSL</u> file that  ships
              with fetchmail.

              Note  that  even  if this option is omitted, fetchmail may still negotiate SSL in-band for POP3 or
              IMAP, through the STLS or STARTTLS feature.  You can use the  --sslproto  option  to  modify  that
              behavior.

              If  no port is specified, the connection is attempted to the well known port of the SSL version of
              the base protocol.  This is generally a different port than the port used by  the  base  protocol.
              For  IMAP,  this is port 143 for the clear protocol and port 993 for the SSL secured protocol; for
              POP3, it is port 110 for the clear text and port 995 for the encrypted variant.

              If your system lacks the corresponding entries from <a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a>, see the  --service  option  and
              specify  the  numeric port number as given in the previous paragraph (unless your ISP had directed
              you to different ports, which is uncommon however).

       <b>--sslcert</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: sslcert)
              For certificate-based client authentication.  Some SSL encrypted servers require client side  keys
              and  certificates  for  authentication.   In  most  cases,  this  is optional.  This specifies the
              location of the public key certificate to be presented to the server at the time the  SSL  session
              is  established.   It is not required (but may be provided) if the server does not require it.  It
              may be the same file as the private key (combined key  and  certificate  file)  but  this  is  not
              recommended. Also see --sslkey below.

              <b>NOTE:</b> If you use client authentication, the user name is fetched from the certificate's CommonName
              and overrides the name set with --user.

       <b>--sslkey</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: sslkey)
              Specifies  the  file  name of the client side private SSL key.  Some SSL encrypted servers require
              client side keys and certificates for authentication.  In most  cases,  this  is  optional.   This
              specifies  the  location  of the private key used to sign transactions with the server at the time
              the SSL session is established.  It is not required (but may be provided) if the server  does  not
              require it. It may be the same file as the public key (combined key and certificate file) but this
              is not recommended.

              If  a  password  is  required to unlock the key, it will be prompted for at the time just prior to
              establishing the session to the server.  This can cause some complications in daemon mode.

              Also see --sslcert above.

       <b>--sslproto</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: sslproto, NOTE: semantic changes since v6.4.0)
              This option has a dual use, out of historic fetchmail behaviour.  It  controls  both  the  SSL/TLS
              protocol version and, if --ssl is not specified, the STARTTLS behaviour (upgrading the protocol to
              an SSL or TLS connection in-band). Some other options may however make TLS mandatory.

              Only  if  this  option  and --ssl are both missing for a poll, there will be opportunistic TLS for
              POP3 and IMAP, where fetchmail will attempt to upgrade to TLSv1 or newer.

              Recognized values for --sslproto are given below. You should normally  choose  one  of  the  auto-
              negotiating  options,  i.  e. '<b>tls1.2+</b>' or '<b>auto</b>' or one of the other options ending in a plus (<b>+</b>)
              character.  Note that depending on OpenSSL library version and configuration, some  options  cause
              run-time  errors  because  the  requested  SSL or TLS versions are not supported by the particular
              installed OpenSSL library.

              '<b>TLS1.2+</b>'
                     (recommended). Since v6.4.0. Require TLS. Auto-negotiate TLSv1.2 or newer.

              '<b>auto</b>' (default). Since  v6.4.0.  Require  TLS.  Auto-negotiate  TLSv1  or  newer,  disable  SSLv3
                     downgrade.   (fetchmail  6.3.26  and  older  have  auto-negotiated all protocols that their
                     OpenSSL library supported, including the broken SSLv3).

              <b>''</b>, the empty string
                     Disable STARTTLS. If --ssl is given for the same server, log  an  error  and  pretend  that
                     '<b>auto</b>' had been used instead.

              '<b>SSL23</b>'
                     see '<b>auto</b>'.

              '<b>SSL3</b>' Require SSLv3 exactly. SSLv3 is broken, not supported on all systems, avoid it if possible.
                     This  will make fetchmail negotiate SSLv3 only, and is the only way besides '<b>SSL3+</b>' to have
                     fetchmail 6.4.0 or newer permit SSLv3.

              '<b>SSL3+</b>'
                     same as '<b>auto</b>', but permit SSLv3 as well. This is the  only  way  besides  '<b>SSL3</b>'  to  have
                     fetchmail 6.4.0 or newer permit SSLv3.

              '<b>TLS1</b>' Require  TLSv1.  This  does  not negotiate TLSv1.1 or newer, and is discouraged. Replace by
                     TLS1+ unless the latter chokes your server.

              '<b>TLS1+</b>'
                     Since v6.4.0. See '<b>auto</b>'.

              '<b>TLS1.1</b>'
                     Since v6.4.0. Require TLS v1.1 exactly.

              '<b>TLS1.1+</b>'
                     Since v6.4.0. Require TLS. Auto-negotiate TLSv1.1 or newer.

              '<b>TLS1.2</b>'
                     Since v6.4.0. Require TLS v1.2 exactly.

              '<b>TLS1.3</b>'
                     Since v6.4.0. Require TLS v1.3 exactly.

              '<b>TLS1.3+</b>'
                     Since v6.4.0. Require TLS. Auto-negotiate TLSv1.3 or newer.

              Unrecognized parameters
                     are treated the same as '<b>auto</b>'.

              NOTE: you should hardly ever need  to  use  anything  other  than  ''  (to  force  an  unencrypted
              connection) or 'auto' (to enforce TLS).

       <b>--sslcertck</b>
              (Keyword: sslcertck, default enabled since v6.4.0)
              <b>--sslcertck</b>  <b>causes</b>  <b>fetchmail</b>  <b>to</b>  <b>require</b>  <b>that</b>  <b>SSL/TLS</b>  <b>be</b>  <b>used</b>  <b>and</b> disconnect unless it can
              successfully negotiate SSL  or  TLS,  or  if  it  cannot  successfully  verify  and  validate  the
              certificate  and  follow it to a trust anchor (or trusted root certificate). The trust anchors are
              given as a set of local trusted certificates (see the <b>sslcertfile</b> and <b>sslcertpath</b> options). If the
              server certificate cannot be obtained or is not signed by one of the  trusted  ones  (directly  or
              indirectly), fetchmail will disconnect, regardless of the <b>sslfingerprint</b> option.

       <b>--nosslcertck</b>
              (Keyword: no sslcertck, only in v6.4.X)
              The  opposite  of  --sslcertck,  this  is  a  discouraged option. It permits fetchmail to continue
              connecting even if the server certificate failed the verification checks.   Should  only  be  used
              together with --sslfingerprint.

       <b>--sslcertfile</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: sslcertfile, since v6.3.17)
              Sets  the  file  fetchmail uses to look up local certificates.  The default is empty.  This can be
              given in addition to <b>--sslcertpath</b> below, and certificates  specified  in  <b>--sslcertfile</b>  will  be
              processed before those in <b>--sslcertpath</b>.  The option can be used in addition to <b>--sslcertpath</b>.

              The file is a text file. It contains the concatenation of trusted CA certificates in PEM format.

              Note  that  using  this  option will suppress loading the default SSL trusted CA certificates file
              unless you set the environment variable  <b>FETCHMAIL_INCLUDE_DEFAULT_X509_CA_CERTS</b>  to  a  non-empty
              value.

       <b>--sslcertpath</b> <b>&lt;directory&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: sslcertpath)
              Sets  the  directory  fetchmail  uses  to  look up local certificates. The default is your OpenSSL
              default directory. The directory must be hashed the way OpenSSL expects it - every time you add or
              modify a certificate in the directory, you need to use the <b>c_rehash</b> tool (which comes with OpenSSL
              in the tools/ sub-directory). Also, after OpenSSL upgrades, you may need to run <b>c_rehash</b>.

              This can be given in addition to <b>--sslcertfile</b> above, which see for precedence rules.

              Note that using this option will suppress adding the default SSL trusted CA certificates directory
              unless you set the environment variable  <b>FETCHMAIL_INCLUDE_DEFAULT_X509_CA_CERTS</b>  to  a  non-empty
              value.

       <b>--sslcommonname</b> <b>&lt;common</b> <b>name&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: sslcommonname; since v6.3.9)
              Use  of  this  option  is discouraged. Before using it, contact the administrator of your upstream
              server and ask for a proper SSL certificate to be used. If that cannot be  attained,  this  option
              can  be used to specify the name (CommonName) that fetchmail expects on the server certificate.  A
              correctly configured server will have this set to the host name by which it  is  reached,  and  by
              default  fetchmail  will  expect as much. Use this option when the CommonName is set to some other
              value, to avoid the "Server CommonName mismatch"  warning,  and  only  if  the  upstream  server's
              operator cannot be made to use proper certificates.

       <b>--sslfingerprint</b> <b>&lt;fingerprint&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: sslfingerprint)
              Specify  the  fingerprint  of the server key (an MD5 hash of the key) in hexadecimal notation with
              colons separating groups of two digits. The letter hex digits must be in upper case. This  is  the
              format  that  fetchmail uses to report the fingerprint when an SSL connection is established. When
              this is specified, fetchmail will compare the server key fingerprint with the given one,  and  the
              connection  will  fail  if  they do not match, regardless of the <b>sslcertck</b> setting. The connection
              will also fail if fetchmail cannot obtain an SSL certificate from the server.  This can be used to
              prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, but the finger print  from  the  server  must  be  obtained  or
              verified over a secure channel, and certainly not over the same Internet connection that fetchmail
              would use.

              Using  this  option will prevent printing certificate verification errors as long as --nosslcertck
              is in effect.

              To obtain the fingerprint of a certificate stored in the file cert.pem, try:

                   openssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -md5 -fingerprint

              For details, see <b><a href="../man1ssl/x509.1ssl.html">x509</a></b>(1ssl).

   <b>Delivery</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-S</b> <b>&lt;hosts&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--smtphost</b> <b>&lt;hosts&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: smtp[host])
              Specify a hunt list of hosts to forward mail to (one or more host names,  comma-separated).  Hosts
              are  tried  in  list order; the first one that is up becomes the forwarding target for the current
              run.  If this option is not specified, 'localhost' is used as the default.   Each  host  name  may
              have  a port number following the host name.  The port number is separated from the host name by a
              slash; the default port is "smtp".  If you specify an absolute path name (beginning with a /),  it
              will  be interpreted as the name of a UNIX socket accepting LMTP connections (such as is supported
              by the Cyrus IMAP daemon) Example:

                   --smtphost server1,server2/2525,server3,/var/imap/socket/lmtp

              This option can be used with ODMR, and will make fetchmail a relay between  the  ODMR  server  and
              SMTP or LMTP receiver.

              WARNING:  if you use address numeric IP addresses here, be sure to use --smtpaddress or --smtpname
              (either of which see) with a valid SMTP address literal!

       <b>--fetchdomains</b> <b>&lt;hosts&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: fetchdomains)
              In ETRN or ODMR mode, this option specifies the list of domains the server should  ship  mail  for
              once the connection is turned around.  The default is the FQDN of the machine running <b>fetchmail</b>.

       <b>-D</b> <b>&lt;domain&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--smtpaddress</b> <b>&lt;domain&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: smtpaddress)
              Specify  the domain to be appended to addresses in RCPT TO lines shipped to SMTP. When this is not
              specified, the name of the SMTP server (as specified by --smtphost)  is  used  for  SMTP/LMTP  and
              'localhost' is used for UNIX socket/BSMTP.

              NOTE: if you intend to use numeric addresses, or so-called address literals per the SMTP standard,
              write  them  in  proper  SMTP  syntax,  for  instance --smtpaddress "[192.0.2.6]" or --smtpaddress
              "[IPv6:2001:DB8::6]".

       <b>--smtpname</b> <b>&lt;user@domain&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: smtpname)
              Specify the domain and user to be put in RCPT TO lines shipped to SMTP.  The default user  is  the
              current local user. Please also see the NOTE about --smtpaddress and address literals above.

       <b>-Z</b> <b>&lt;nnn&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--antispam</b> <b>&lt;nnn[,</b> <b>nnn]...&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: antispam)
              Specifies the list of numeric SMTP errors that are to be interpreted as a spam-block response from
              the  listener.   A value of -1 disables this option.  For the command-line option, the list values
              should be comma-separated.  Note that the antispam values only apply to "MAIL FROM"  responses  in
              the  SMTP/LMTP  dialogue, but several MTAs (Postfix in its default configuration, qmail) defer the
              anti-spam response code until after the RCPT TO. --antispam does not work in these  circumstances.
              Also see --softbounce (default) and its inverse.

       <b>-m</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--mda</b> <b>&lt;command&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: mda)
              This  option  lets  <b>fetchmail</b>  use a Message or Local Delivery Agent (MDA or LDA) directly, rather
              than forward via SMTP or LMTP.

              To avoid losing mail, use this option only with MDAs like maildrop or MTAs like sendmail that exit
              with a nonzero status on disk-full and other delivery errors; the nonzero status  tells  fetchmail
              that delivery failed and prevents the message from being deleted on the server.

              If  <b>fetchmail</b>  is  running  as  root,  it sets its user id while delivering mail through an MDA as
              follows:  First, the FETCHMAILUSER, LOGNAME, and USER environment variables are  checked  in  this
              order.  The  value  of  the first variable from his list that is defined (even if it is empty!) is
              looked up in the system user database. If none of the variables is defined, fetchmail will use the
              real user id it was started with. If one of the variables was defined, but the user  stated  there
              is  not  found,  fetchmail  continues running as root, without checking remaining variables on the
              list.  Practically, this means that if you run fetchmail as root (not  recommended),  it  is  most
              useful  to  define  the FETCHMAILUSER environment variable to set the user that the MDA should run
              as. Some MDAs (such as maildrop) are designed to be setuid root and setuid to the recipient's user
              id, so you do not lose functionality this way even when running fetchmail  as  unprivileged  user.
              Check the MDA's manual for details.

              Some  possible  MDAs  are  "/usr/sbin/sendmail -i -f %F -- %T" (<b>Note:</b> some several older or vendor
              sendmail versions mistake -- for an address, rather than an indicator  to  mark  the  end  of  the
              option  arguments),  "/usr/bin/deliver"  and  "/usr/bin/maildrop -d %T".  Local delivery addresses
              will be inserted into the MDA command wherever you place a %T; the  mail  message's  From  address
              will be inserted where you place an %F.

              <b>Do</b>  <b>NOT</b>  <b>enclose</b> <b>the</b> <b>%F</b> <b>or</b> <b>%T</b> <b>string</b> <b>in</b> <b>single</b> <b>quotes!</b>  For both %T and %F, fetchmail encloses the
              addresses in single quotes ('), after removing any single quotes they may contain, before the  MDA
              command is passed to the shell.

              <b>Do</b>  <b>NOT</b>  <b>use</b> <b>an</b> <b>MDA</b> <b>invocation</b> <b>that</b> <b>dispatches</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>To/Cc/Bcc,</b> like "sendmail -i -t"
              or "qmail-inject", it will create mail loops and bring the just wrath  of  many  postmasters  down
              upon your head.  This is one of the most frequent configuration errors!

              Also,  do  <u>not</u> try to combine multidrop mode with an MDA such as maildrop that can only accept one
              address, unless your upstream stores one copy of the message  per  recipient  and  transports  the
              envelope recipient in a header; you will lose mail.

              The  well-known  <b><a href="../man1/procmail.1.html">procmail</a></b>(1) package is very hard to configure properly, it has a very nasty "fall
              through to the next rule" behavior on delivery errors (even temporary ones, such as  out  of  disk
              space if another user's mail daemon copies the mailbox around to purge old messages), so your mail
              will end up in the wrong mailbox sooner or later. The proper procmail configuration is outside the
              scope  of  this document. Using <b><a href="../man1/maildrop.1.html">maildrop</a></b>(1) is usually much easier, and many users find the filter
              syntax used by maildrop easier to understand.

              Finally, we strongly advise that you do <b>not</b> use qmail-inject.  The command line interface is  non-
              standard  without  providing  benefits  for  typical  use,  and  fetchmail  makes  no  attempts to
              accommodate qmail-inject's deviations from the standard. Some of qmail-inject's  command-line  and
              environment  options  are  actually dangerous and can cause broken threads, non-detected duplicate
              messages and forwarding loops.

       <b>--lmtp</b> (Keyword: lmtp)
              Cause delivery via LMTP (Local  Mail  Transfer  Protocol).   A  service  host  and  port  <b>must</b>  be
              explicitly  specified  on  each  host  in  the  smtphost  hunt  list (see above) if this option is
              selected; the default port 25 will (in accordance with RFC 2033) not be accepted.

       <b>--bsmtp</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: bsmtp)
              Append fetched mail to a BSMTP file.  This simply contains the SMTP commands that  would  normally
              be generated by fetchmail when passing mail to an SMTP listener daemon.

              An  argument  of  '-'  causes the SMTP batch to be written to standard output, which is of limited
              use: this only makes sense for debugging, because fetchmail's regular output  is  interspersed  on
              the same channel, so this is not suitable for mail delivery. This special mode may be removed in a
              later release.

              Note that fetchmail's reconstruction of MAIL FROM and RCPT TO lines is not guaranteed correct; the
              caveats  discussed  under  THE  USE  AND  ABUSE OF MULTIDROP MAILBOXES below apply.  This mode has
              precedence before --mda and SMTP/LMTP.

       <b>--bad-header</b> <b>{reject|accept}</b>
              (Keyword: bad-header; since v6.3.15)
              Specify how fetchmail is supposed to treat messages with  bad  headers,  i.e.,  headers  with  bad
              syntax.  Traditionally,  fetchmail  has  rejected  such  messages,  but some distributors modified
              fetchmail to accept them. You can now configure fetchmail's behaviour per server.

   <b>Resource</b> <b>Limit</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-l</b> <b>&lt;maxbytes&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--limit</b> <b>&lt;maxbytes&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: limit)
              Takes a maximum octet size argument, where 0 is the default and also the special value designating
              "no limit".  If nonzero, messages larger than this size will not be fetched and will  be  left  on
              the  server  (in  foreground sessions, the progress messages will note that they are "oversized").
              If the fetch protocol permits (in particular, under IMAP or POP3 without the fetchall option)  the
              message will not be marked seen.

              An  explicit  --limit  of  0  overrides  any  limits  set in your run control file. This option is
              intended for those needing to strictly control fetch time due  to  expensive  and  variable  phone
              rates.

              Combined  with  --limitflush, it can be used to delete oversized messages waiting on a server.  In
              daemon mode, oversize notifications are mailed to the calling user (see  the  --warnings  option).
              This option does not work with ETRN or ODMR.

       <b>-w</b> <b>&lt;interval&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--warnings</b> <b>&lt;interval&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: warnings)
              Takes  an interval in seconds.  When you call <b>fetchmail</b> with a 'limit' option in daemon mode, this
              controls the interval at which warnings about oversized messages are mailed to  the  calling  user
              (or the user specified by the 'postmaster' option).  One such notification is always mailed at the
              end  of  the  first  poll  that the oversized message is detected.  Thereafter, re-notification is
              suppressed until after the warning interval elapses (it will take place at the end  of  the  first
              following poll).

       <b>-b</b> <b>&lt;count&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--batchlimit</b> <b>&lt;count&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: batchlimit)
              Specify  the  maximum  number  of  messages  that  will  be shipped to an SMTP listener before the
              connection is deliberately torn down and rebuilt (defaults to 0, meaning no limit).   An  explicit
              --batchlimit  of  0 overrides any limits set in your run control file.  While <b><a href="../man8/sendmail.8.html">sendmail</a></b>(8) normally
              initiates delivery of a message immediately after receiving  the  message  terminator,  some  SMTP
              listeners are not so prompt.  MTAs like <b><a href="../man8/smail.8.html">smail</a></b>(8) may wait till the delivery socket is shut down to
              deliver.   This  may  produce  annoying  delays  when  <b>fetchmail</b> is processing very large batches.
              Setting the batch limit to some nonzero size will prevent these delays.  This option does not work
              with ETRN or ODMR.

       <b>-B</b> <b>&lt;number&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--fetchlimit</b> <b>&lt;number&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: fetchlimit)
              Limit the number of messages accepted from a given server in a single poll.  By default  there  is
              no  limit.  An explicit --fetchlimit of 0 overrides any limits set in your run control file.  This
              option does not work with ETRN or ODMR.

       <b>--fetchsizelimit</b> <b>&lt;number&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: fetchsizelimit)
              Limit the number of sizes of messages accepted from a given server in a single transaction.   This
              option is useful in reducing the delay in downloading the first mail when there are too many mails
              in  the mailbox.  By default, the limit is 100.  If set to 0, sizes of all messages are downloaded
              at the start.  This option does not work with ETRN or ODMR.  For POP3,  the  only  valid  non-zero
              value is 1.

       <b>--fastuidl</b> <b>&lt;number&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: fastuidl)
              Do  a  binary  instead of linear search for the first unseen UID. Binary search avoids downloading
              the UIDs of all mails. This saves time (especially in daemon mode) where downloading the same  set
              of  UIDs in each poll is a waste of bandwidth. The number 'n' indicates how rarely a linear search
              should be done. In daemon mode, linear search is used once followed by binary  searches  in  'n-1'
              polls  if 'n' is greater than 1; binary search is always used if 'n' is 1; linear search is always
              used if 'n' is 0. In non-daemon mode, binary search is used if 'n' is 1; otherwise  linear  search
              is used. The default value of 'n' is 4.  This option works with POP3 only.

       <b>-e</b> <b>&lt;count&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--expunge</b> <b>&lt;count&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: expunge)
              Arrange  for  deletions  to  be  made final after a given number of messages.  Under POP2 or POP3,
              fetchmail cannot make deletions final without sending QUIT and ending the  session  --  with  this
              option  on, fetchmail will break a long mail retrieval session into multiple sub-sessions, sending
              QUIT after each sub-session. This is a good defense against line drops  on  POP3  servers.   Under
              IMAP,  <b>fetchmail</b>  normally  issues  an  EXPUNGE  command after each deletion in order to force the
              deletion to be done immediately.  This is safest when your connection to the server is  flaky  and
              expensive,  as  it avoids re-sending duplicate mail after a line hit.  However, on large mailboxes
              the overhead of re-indexing after every message can slam  the  server  pretty  hard,  so  if  your
              connection  is  reliable  it  is good to do expunges less frequently.  Also note that some servers
              enforce a delay of a few seconds after each quit, so fetchmail may not be  able  to  get  back  in
              immediately  after  an  expunge  -- you may see "lock busy" errors if this happens. If you specify
              this option to an integer N, it tells <b>fetchmail</b> to only issue expunges on every  Nth  delete.   An
              argument of zero suppresses expunges entirely (so no expunges at all will be done until the end of
              run).  This option does not work with ETRN or ODMR.

   <b>Authentication</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-u</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--user</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--username</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: user[name])
              Specifies  the user identification to be used when logging in to the mail server.  The appropriate
              user identification is both server and user-dependent.  The default is  your  login  name  on  the
              client  machine  that  is  running  <b>fetchmail</b>.   See  USER  AUTHENTICATION  below  for  a complete
              description.

       <b>-I</b> <b>&lt;specification&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--interface</b> <b>&lt;specification&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: interface)
              Require that a specific interface device be up and have a specific local or remote IPv4  (IPv6  is
              not supported by this option yet) address (or range) before polling.  Frequently <b>fetchmail</b> is used
              over a transient point-to-point TCP/IP link established directly to a mail server via SLIP or PPP.
              That is a relatively secure channel.  But when other TCP/IP routes to the mail server exist (e.g.,
              when  the  link is connected to an alternate ISP), your username and password may be vulnerable to
              snooping (especially when daemon mode automatically polls for mail, shipping a clear password over
              the net at predictable intervals).  The --interface option may be used to prevent this.  When  the
              specified  link  is  not up or is not connected to a matching IP address, polling will be skipped.
              The format is:

                   interface/iii.iii.iii.iii[/mmm.mmm.mmm.mmm]

              The field before the first slash is the interface name (i.e., sl0, ppp0 etc.).  The  field  before
              the  second  slash is the acceptable IP address.  The field after the second slash is a mask which
              specifies a range of IP addresses to accept.  If no mask is  present  255.255.255.255  is  assumed
              (i.e.,  an  exact match).  This option is currently only supported under Linux and FreeBSD. Please
              see the <b>monitor</b> section for below for FreeBSD specific information.

              Note that this option may be removed from a future fetchmail version.

       <b>-M</b> <b>&lt;interface&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--monitor</b> <b>&lt;interface&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: monitor)
              Daemon mode can cause transient links which  are  automatically  taken  down  after  a  period  of
              inactivity  (e.g.,  PPP  links) to remain up indefinitely.  This option identifies a system TCP/IP
              interface to be monitored for activity.  After each poll interval, if the link is up but no  other
              activity  has  occurred  on  the  link, then the poll will be skipped.  However, when fetchmail is
              woken up by a signal, the monitor check is skipped and  the  poll  goes  through  unconditionally.
              This  option  is  currently only supported under Linux and FreeBSD.  For the <b>monitor</b> and <b>interface</b>
              options to work for non root users under FreeBSD, the fetchmail binary must  be  installed  setgid
              kmem.  This would be a security hole, but fetchmail runs with the effective GID set to that of the
              kmem group <u>only</u> when interface data is being collected.

              Note that this option may be removed from a future fetchmail version.

       <b>--auth</b> <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: auth[enticate])
              This  option  permits  you  to  specify  an authentication type (see USER AUTHENTICATION below for
              details).  The possible values are <b>any</b>, <b>password</b>,  <b>kerberos_v5</b>,  <b>kerberos</b>  (or,  for  excruciating
              exactness,  <b>kerberos_v4</b>),  <b>gssapi</b>,  <b>cram-md5</b>, <b>otp</b>, <b>ntlm</b>, <b>msn</b> (only for POP3), <b>external</b> (only IMAP)
              and <b>ssh</b>.  When <b>any</b> (the default) is specified, fetchmail tries first methods that do not require a
              password (EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, KERBEROS IV, KERBEROS 5); then it looks for  methods  that  mask  your
              password  (CRAM-MD5, NTLM, X-OTP - note that MSN is only supported for POP3, but not auto-probed);
              and only if the server does not support any of those  will  it  ship  your  password  unencrypted.
              Other  values  may  be used to force various authentication methods: <b>ssh</b> suppresses authentication
              and is thus useful for IMAP PREAUTH (if you are using a secure --plugin, for instance, a  properly
              configured ssh, you may also need to set --sslproto '' or, in the rcfile, sslproto '', in order to
              avoid  fetchmail  negotiating  STARTTLS over SSH).  <b>external</b> suppresses authentication and is thus
              useful for IMAP EXTERNAL.  Any value other than <b>password</b>, <b>cram-md5</b>, <b>ntlm</b>, <b>msn</b>  or  <b>otp</b>  suppresses
              fetchmail's  normal  inquiry  for a password.  Specify <b>ssh</b> when you are using an end-to-end secure
              connection such as an ssh tunnel (in this case you may also want to specify  <b>--sslproto</b> <b>''</b>,  which
              see);  specify  <b>external</b>  when  you  use  TLS  with  client  authentication  and specify <b>gssapi</b> or
              <b>kerberos_v4</b> if you are using a protocol variant that employs GSSAPI or K4.  Choosing KPOP protocol
              automatically selects Kerberos authentication.  This option  does  not  work  with  ETRN.   GSSAPI
              service  names  are  in  line  with  RFC-2743 and IANA registrations, see Generic Security Service
              Application Program Interface (GSSAPI)/Kerberos/Simple Authentication and    Security Layer (SASL)
              Service Names.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-f</b> <b>&lt;pathname&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--fetchmailrc</b> <b>&lt;pathname&gt;</b>
              Specify a non-default name for the <u><a href="file:~/.fetchmailrc">~/.fetchmailrc</a></u> run control file.  The pathname argument must be
              either  "-"  (a single dash, meaning to read the configuration from standard input) or a filename.
              Unless the --version option is also on, a named file argument must have permissions no  more  open
              than 0700 (u=rwx,g=,o=) or else be /dev/null.

       <b>-i</b> <b>&lt;pathname&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--idfile</b> <b>&lt;pathname&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: idfile)
              Specify  an alternate name for the .fetchids file used to save message UIDs. NOTE: since fetchmail
              6.3.0, write access to the directory containing the idfile is  required,  as  fetchmail  writes  a
              temporary  file  and  renames  it into the place of the real idfile only if the temporary file has
              been written successfully. This avoids the truncation of idfiles when running out of disk space.

       <b>--pidfile</b> <b>&lt;pathname&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: pidfile; since fetchmail v6.3.4)
              Override the default location of the PID  file  that  is  used  as  a  lock  file.   Default:  see
              "ENVIRONMENT"  below. Note that many places in the code and documentation, the term "lock file" is
              used.  This file contains the  process  ID  of  the  running  fetchmail  on  the  first  line  and
              potentially the daemon interval on a second line.

       <b>-n</b> <b>|</b> <b>--norewrite</b>
              (Keyword: no rewrite)
              Normally,  <b>fetchmail</b>  edits  RFC-822  address headers (To, From, Cc, Bcc, and Reply-To) in fetched
              mail so that any mail IDs local to the server are expanded to  full  addresses  (@  and  the  mail
              server  host  name  are  appended).  This enables replies on the client to get addressed correctly
              (otherwise your mailer might think  they  should  be  addressed  to  local  users  on  the  client
              machine!).   This  option disables the rewrite.  (This option is provided to pacify people who are
              paranoid about having an MTA edit mail headers and want to know they can prevent  it,  but  it  is
              generally  not  a  good  idea to actually turn off rewrite.)  When using ETRN or ODMR, the rewrite
              option is ineffective.

       <b>-E</b> <b>&lt;line&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--envelope</b> <b>&lt;line&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: envelope; Multidrop only)
              In the configuration file, an enhanced syntax is used:
              <b>envelope</b> <b>[&lt;count&gt;]</b> <b>&lt;line&gt;</b>

              This option changes the header <b>fetchmail</b> assumes will carry a copy of the mail's envelope address.
              Normally this is 'X-Envelope-To'.  Other typically found headers to carry envelope information are
              'X-Original-To' and 'Delivered-To'.  Now, since  these  headers  are  not  standardized,  practice
              varies.  See  the  discussion  of  multidrop address handling below.  As a special case, 'envelope
              "Received"'  enables  parsing  of  sendmail-style  Received  lines.   This  is  the  default,  but
              discouraged because it is not fully reliable.

              Note that fetchmail expects the Received-line to be in a specific format: It must contain "by <u>host</u>
              for <u>address</u>", where <u>host</u> must match one of the mail server names that fetchmail recognizes for the
              account in question.

              The  optional count argument (only available in the configuration file) determines how many header
              lines of this kind are skipped. A count of 1 means: skip the first, take the second. A count of  2
              means: skip the first and second, take the third, and so on.

       <b>-Q</b> <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b> <b>|</b> <b>--qvirtual</b> <b>&lt;prefix&gt;</b>
              (Keyword: qvirtual; Multidrop only)
              The  string  prefix assigned to this option will be removed from the user name found in the header
              specified with the <u>envelope</u> option (<u>before</u> doing multidrop name mapping or  localdomain  checking,
              if either is applicable). This option is useful if you are using <b>fetchmail</b> to collect the mail for
              an  entire  domain  and  your  ISP (or your mail redirection provider) is using qmail.  One of the
              basic features of qmail is the <u>Delivered-To:</u> message header.  Whenever qmail delivers a message to
              a local mailbox it puts the username and host name of the envelope recipient on  this  line.   The
              major  reason for this is to prevent mail loops.  To set up qmail to batch mail for a disconnected
              site the ISP-mailhost will have normally put that site in its 'Virtualhosts' control  file  so  it
              will  add  a  prefix  to  all  mail  addresses  for  this  site.  This  results  in  mail  sent to
              '<a href="mailto:username@userhost.userdom.dom.com">username@userhost.userdom.dom.com</a>' having a <u>Delivered-To:</u> line of the form:

              Delivered-To: <a href="mailto:mbox-userstr-username@userhost.example.com">mbox-userstr-username@userhost.example.com</a>

              The ISP can make the 'mbox-userstr-' prefix anything they choose but a string  matching  the  user
              host name is likely.  By using the option 'envelope Delivered-To:' you can make fetchmail reliably
              identify  the  original  envelope  recipient,  but you have to strip the 'mbox-userstr-' prefix to
              deliver to the correct user.  This is what this option is for.

       <b>--configdump</b>
              Parse  the  <u><a href="file:~/.fetchmailrc">~/.fetchmailrc</a></u>  file,  interpret  any  command-line  options  specified,  and  dump  a
              configuration  report to standard output.  The configuration report is a data structure assignment
              in the language Python.  This option is meant to be used with an interactive <u><a href="file:~/.fetchmailrc">~/.fetchmailrc</a></u> editor
              like <b>fetchmailconf</b>, written in Python.

       <b>-y</b> <b>|</b> <b>--yydebug</b>

</pre><h4><b>USER</b> <b>AUTHENTICATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENCRYPTION</b></h4><pre>
       All modes except ETRN require authentication of the client to the server.  Normal user authentication  in
       <b>fetchmail</b>  is  very  much  like the authentication mechanism of <b><a href="../man1/ftp.1.html">ftp</a></b>(1).  The correct user-id and password
       depend upon the underlying security system at the mail server.

       If the mail server is a Unix machine on which you have an ordinary user account, your regular login  name
       and  password  are used with <b>fetchmail</b>.  If you use the same login name on both the server and the client
       machines, you needn't worry about specifying a user-id with the <b>-u</b> option -- the default behavior  is  to
       use  your  login name on the client machine as the user-id on the server machine.  If you use a different
       login name on the server machine, specify that login name with the <b>-u</b> option.  E.g., if your  login  name
       is 'jsmith' on a machine named 'mailgrunt', you would start <b>fetchmail</b> as follows:

              fetchmail -u jsmith mailgrunt

       The default behavior of <b>fetchmail</b> is to prompt you for your mail server password before the connection is
       established.   This  is  the  safest  way  to  use  <b>fetchmail</b>  and ensures that your password will not be
       compromised.  You may also specify your password in your <u><a href="file:~/.fetchmailrc">~/.fetchmailrc</a></u> file.  This  is  convenient  when
       using <b>fetchmail</b> in daemon mode or with scripts.

   <b>Using</b> <b>netrc</b> <b>files</b>
       If you do not specify a password, and <b>fetchmail</b> cannot extract one from your <u><a href="file:~/.fetchmailrc">~/.fetchmailrc</a></u> file, it will
       look for a <u><a href="file:~/.netrc">~/.netrc</a></u> file in your home directory before requesting one interactively; if an entry matching
       the  mail  server is found in that file, the password will be used.  Fetchmail first looks for a match on
       poll name; if it finds none, it checks for a match on via name.  See the <b><a href="../man1/ftp.1.html">ftp</a></b>(1) man page for  details  of
       the syntax of the <u><a href="file:~/.netrc">~/.netrc</a></u> file.  To show a practical example, a .netrc might look like this:

              machine hermes.example.org
              login joe
              password topsecret

       You can repeat this block with different user information if you need to provide more than one password.

       This feature may allow you to avoid duplicating password information in more than one file.

       On  mail  servers  that  do  not  provide  ordinary  user accounts, your user-id and password are usually
       assigned by the server administrator when you apply for a mailbox on the  server.   Contact  your  server
       administrator if you do not know the correct user-id and password for your mailbox account.

   <b>Secure</b> <b>Socket</b> <b>Layers</b> <b>(SSL)</b> <b>and</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>Layer</b> <b>Security</b> <b>(TLS)</b>
       All  retrieval  protocols  can  use  SSL  or  TLS wrapping for the transport. Additionally, POP3 and IMAP
       retrieval can also negotiate SSL/TLS by means of STARTTLS (or STLS).

       You can access TLS-encrypted services by specifying the options  starting  with  --ssl,  such  as  --ssl,
       --sslproto,  --sslcertck,  and  others.  You can also do this using the corresponding user options in the
       .fetchmailrc file.  Some services, such as POP3 and IMAP, have different well known ports defined for the
       SSL encrypted services.  The encrypted ports will be selected automatically when SSL is  enabled  and  no
       explicit  port  is  specified.    Also, the --sslcertck command line or sslcertck run control file option
       should be used to force strict certificate checking with older fetchmail versions - see below.

       If  TLS  or  SSL  is  not  configured,  fetchmail  will  usually  still  try  to  use  STARTTLS  somewhat
       opportunistically.  In  practice,  is  it  still  mandatory  because --sslcertck is a default setting and
       implicitly requires STARTTLS.

       STARTTLS can be enforced by using  --sslproto  auto  and  defeated  by  using  --sslproto  ''.   STARTTLS
       connections  use  the  same port as the unencrypted version of the protocol and negotiate TLS via special
       command. The --sslcertck command line or sslcertck run control file option should be used to force strict
       certificate checking - see below.

       <b>--sslcertck</b> <b>is</b> <b>recommended:</b> When connecting to an SSL or TLS encrypted  server,  the  server  presents  a
       certificate  to  the client for validation.  The certificate is checked to verify that the common name in
       the certificate matches the name of the server being contacted and  that  the  effective  and  expiration
       dates  in  the  certificate  indicate that it is currently valid.  If any of these checks fail, a warning
       message is printed, but the connection continues.  The server certificate does not need to be  signed  by
       any specific Certifying Authority and may be a "self-signed" certificate. If the --sslcertck command line
       option  or sslcertck run control file option is used, fetchmail will instead abort if any of these checks
       fail, because it must assume that there is a man-in-the-middle attack in this scenario,  hence  fetchmail
       must not expose clear-text passwords. Use of the sslcertck or --sslcertck option is therefore advised; it
       has become the default in fetchmail 6.4.0.

       Some  SSL  encrypted servers may request a client side certificate.  A client side public SSL certificate
       and private SSL key may be specified.  If requested by the server, the client certificate is sent to  the
       server for validation.  Some servers may require a valid client certificate and may refuse connections if
       a  certificate  is not provided or if the certificate is not valid.  Some servers may require client side
       certificates be signed by a recognized Certifying Authority.  The  format  for  the  key  files  and  the
       certificate files is that required by the underlying SSL libraries (OpenSSL in the general case).

       A  word  of  care  about the use of SSL: While above mentioned setup with self-signed server certificates
       retrieved over the wires can protect you from a passive eavesdropper, it does not help against an  active
       attacker.  It is clearly an improvement over sending the passwords in clear, but you should be aware that
       a man-in-the-middle attack is trivially possible (in particular with  tools  such  as  dsniff).   Use  of
       strict certificate checking with a certification authority recognized by server and client, or perhaps of
       an  SSH  tunnel  (see  below for some examples) is preferable if you care seriously about the security of
       your mailbox and passwords.

</pre><h4><b>POP3</b> <b>VARIANTS</b></h4><pre>
       Early versions of POP3 (RFC1081, RFC1225) supported a crude form of independent authentication using  the
       <u>.rhosts</u>  file  on  the  mail  server  side.  Under this RPOP variant, a fixed per-user ID equivalent to a
       password was sent in clear over a link to a reserved port, with the command  RPOP  rather  than  PASS  to
       alert  the  server  that  it should do special checking.  RPOP is supported by <b>fetchmail</b> (you can specify
       'protocol RPOP' to have the program send 'RPOP' rather than 'PASS') but its use is strongly  discouraged,
       and  support  will  be removed from a future fetchmail version.  This facility was vulnerable to spoofing
       and was withdrawn in RFC1460.

       RFC1460 introduced APOP authentication.  In this variant of POP3, you register an APOP password  on  your
       server host (on some servers, the program to do this is called <b><a href="../man8/popauth.8.html">popauth</a></b>(8)).  You put the same password in
       your  <u><a href="file:~/.fetchmailrc">~/.fetchmailrc</a></u>  file.   Each  time <b>fetchmail</b> logs in, it sends an MD5 hash of your password and the
       server greeting time to the server, which can verify it by checking its authorization database.

       <b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>APOP</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>considered</b> <b>resistant</b> <b>against</b> <b>man-in-the-middle</b> <b>attacks.</b>

   <b>RETR</b> <b>or</b> <b>TOP</b>
       <b>fetchmail</b> makes some efforts to make the server believe messages had not been retrieved, by using the TOP
       command with a large number of lines when possible.  TOP is a command that retrieves the full header  and
       a  <b>fetchmail</b>-specified amount of body lines. It is optional and therefore not implemented by all servers,
       and some are known to implement it improperly. On many servers however, the RETR command which  retrieves
       the  full  message with header and body, sets the "seen" flag (for instance, in a web interface), whereas
       the TOP command does not do that.

       <b>fetchmail</b> will always use the RETR command if "fetchall" is  set.   <b>fetchmail</b>  will  also  use  the  RETR
       command  if  "keep"  is  set  and  "uidl"  is  unset.   Finally,  <b>fetchmail</b>  will use the RETR command on
       Maillennium POP3/PROXY servers (used by Comcast) to avoid a  deliberate  TOP  misinterpretation  in  this
       server that causes message corruption.

       In  all  other cases, <b>fetchmail</b> will use the TOP command. This implies that in "keep" setups, "uidl" must
       be set if "TOP" is desired.

       <b>Note</b> that this description is true for the current version of fetchmail, but the behavior may  change  in
       future versions. In particular, fetchmail may prefer the RETR command because the TOP command causes much
       grief on some servers and is only optional.

</pre><h4><b>ALTERNATE</b> <b>AUTHENTICATION</b> <b>FORMS/METHODS</b></h4><pre>
       If  your  <b>fetchmail</b>  was built with Kerberos support and you specify Kerberos authentication (either with
       --auth or the <u>.fetchmailrc</u> option <b>authenticate</b> <b>kerberos_v4</b>) it will try to get a Kerberos ticket from the
       mail server at the start of each query.  Note: if either the pollname or via name is 'hesiod',  fetchmail
       will try to use Hesiod to look up the mail server.

       If  you use POP3 or IMAP with GSSAPI authentication, <b>fetchmail</b> will expect the server to have RFC1731- or
       RFC1734-conforming GSSAPI capability, and will  use  it.   Currently  this  has  only  been  tested  over
       Kerberos 5,  so  you  are  expected  to  already  have  a ticket-granting ticket. You may pass a username
       different from your principal name using the standard <b>--user</b> command or by the <u>.fetchmailrc</u> option <b>user</b>.

       If your IMAP daemon returns the PREAUTH response in its greeting line, fetchmail  will  notice  this  and
       skip  the normal authentication step.  This can be useful, e.g., if you start imapd explicitly using ssh.
       In this case you can declare the authentication value 'ssh' on that site entry to  stop  <u>.fetchmail</u>  from
       asking you for a password when it starts up.

       If  you  use  client  authentication  with  <u>TLS1</u> and your IMAP daemon returns the <u>AUTH=EXTERNAL</u> response,
       fetchmail will notice this and will use the authentication shortcut and will not send the passphrase.  In
       this case you can declare the authentication value 'external'
        on that site to stop <b>fetchmail</b> from asking you for a password when it starts up.

       If  you  are  using  POP3,  and  the  server  issues a one-time-password challenge conforming to RFC1938,
       <b>fetchmail</b> will use your password as a pass phrase to generate the required response. This avoids  sending
       secrets over the net unencrypted.

       Compuserve's  RPA  authentication  is  supported.  If  you  compile in the support, <b>fetchmail</b> will try to
       perform an RPA pass-phrase authentication instead of sending over the password unencrypted if it  detects
       "@compuserve.com" in the host name.

       If  you are using IMAP, Microsoft's NTLM authentication (used by Microsoft Exchange) is supported. If you
       compile in the support, <b>fetchmail</b> will try to perform an NTLM authentication (instead of sending over the
       password unencrypted) whenever the server returns AUTH=NTLM in its capability response.  Specify  a  user
       option  value that looks like 'user@domain': the part to the left of the @ will be passed as the username
       and the part to the right as the NTLM domain.

   <b>ESMTP</b> <b>AUTH</b>
       <b>fetchmail</b> also supports authentication to the ESMTP server on the client side according to RFC 2554.  You
       can specify a name/password pair to be used with the keywords 'esmtpname' and 'esmtppassword'; the former
       defaults to the username of the calling user.

</pre><h4><b>DAEMON</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Introducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>daemon</b> <b>mode</b>
       In daemon mode, <b>fetchmail</b> puts itself into the background and runs forever, querying each specified  host
       and then sleeping for a given polling interval.

   <b>Starting</b> <b>the</b> <b>daemon</b> <b>mode</b>
       There are several ways to make fetchmail work in daemon mode. On the command line, <b>--daemon</b> <b>&lt;interval&gt;</b> or
       <b>-d</b> <b>&lt;interval&gt;</b>  option  runs  <b>fetchmail</b>  in  daemon  mode.  You must specify a numeric argument which is a
       polling interval (time to wait after completing a whole poll  cycle  with  the  last  server  and  before
       starting the next poll cycle with the first server) in seconds.

       Example: simply invoking

              fetchmail -d 900

       will,  therefore,  poll  all  the  hosts  described  in your <u><a href="file:~/.fetchmailrc">~/.fetchmailrc</a></u> file (except those explicitly
       excluded with the 'skip' verb) a bit less often than once every 15 minutes (exactly: 15  minutes  +  time
       that the poll takes).

       It   is   also   possible   to   set   a   polling   interval  in  your  <u><a href="file:~/.fetchmailrc">~/.fetchmailrc</a></u>  file  by  saying
       'set daemon &lt;interval&gt;', where &lt;interval&gt; is an integer number of seconds.  If  you  do  this,  fetchmail
       will always start in daemon mode unless you override it with the command-line option --daemon 0 or -d0.

       Only  one daemon process is permitted per user; in daemon mode, <b>fetchmail</b> sets up a per-user lock file to
       guarantee this.  (You can however cheat and set the FETCHMAILHOME environment variable to  overcome  this
       setting,  but  in  that  case, it is your responsibility to make sure you are not polling the same server
       with two processes at the same time.)

   <b>Awakening</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> <b>daemon</b>
       Normally, calling fetchmail with a daemon in the background sends a wake-up  signal  to  the  daemon  and
       quits  without  output.  The  background daemon then starts its next poll cycle immediately.  The wake-up
       signal, SIGUSR1, can also be sent manually. The wake-up action also clears any 'wedged' flags  indicating
       that connections have wedged due to failed authentication or multiple timeouts.

   <b>Terminating</b> <b>the</b> <b>background</b> <b>daemon</b>
       The  option  <b>-q</b> or <b>--quit</b> will kill a running daemon process instead of waking it up (if there is no such
       process, <b>fetchmail</b> will notify you).  If the --quit option appears last on the  command  line,  <b>fetchmail</b>
       will kill the running daemon process and then quit. Otherwise, <b>fetchmail</b> will first kill a running daemon
       process and then continue running with the other options.

   <b>Useful</b> <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>daemon</b> <b>mode</b>
       The  <b>-L</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> or <b>--logfile</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> option (keyword: set logfile) is only effective when fetchmail
       is detached and in daemon mode. Note that <b>the</b> <b>logfile</b> <b>must</b> <b>exist</b> <b>before</b> fetchmail is run, you can use the
       <b><a href="../man1/touch.1.html">touch</a></b>(1) command with the filename as its sole argument to create it.
       This option allows you to redirect status messages into a specified logfile (follow the option  with  the
       logfile  name).   The  logfile  is  opened  for  append,  so  previous messages are not deleted.  This is
       primarily useful for debugging configurations. Note that fetchmail does not  detect  if  the  logfile  is
       rotated,  the  logfile  is  only  opened  once when fetchmail starts. You need to restart fetchmail after
       rotating the logfile and before compressing it (if applicable).

       The <b>--syslog</b> option (keyword: set syslog) allows you to redirect status and error messages emitted to the
       <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3) system daemon if available.  Messages  are  logged  with  an  id  of  <b>fetchmail</b>,  the  facility
       <b>LOG_MAIL</b>,  and priorities <b>LOG_ERR</b>, <b>LOG_ALERT</b> or <b>LOG_INFO</b>.  This option is intended for logging status and
       error messages which indicate the status of the daemon and the  results  while  fetching  mail  from  the
       server(s).   Error  messages for command line options and parsing the <u>.fetchmailrc</u> file are still written
       to stderr, or to the specified log file.  The <b>--nosyslog</b> option turns off use of <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3),  assuming  it
       is  turned on in the <u><a href="file:~/.fetchmailrc">~/.fetchmailrc</a></u> file.  This option is overridden, in certain situations, by <b>--logfile</b>
       (which see).

       The <b>-N</b> or <b>--nodetach</b> option suppresses backgrounding and  detachment  of  the  daemon  process  from  its
       control  terminal.   This  is  useful  for  debugging or when fetchmail runs as the child of a supervisor
       process such as <b><a href="../man8/init.8.html">init</a></b>(8) or Gerrit Pape's <b><a href="../man8/runit.8.html">runit</a></b>(8).  Note that this also causes the logfile option  to  be
       ignored.

       Note  that  while running in daemon mode polling a POP2 or IMAP2bis server, transient errors (such as DNS
       failures or sendmail delivery refusals) may force the fetchall option on for the  duration  of  the  next
       polling  cycle.   This  is  a robustness feature.  It means that if a message is fetched (and thus marked
       seen by the mail server) but not delivered locally due to some transient error,  it  will  be  re-fetched
       during  the  next poll cycle.  (The IMAP logic does not delete messages until they are delivered, so this
       problem does not arise.)

       If you touch or change the <u><a href="file:~/.fetchmailrc">~/.fetchmailrc</a></u> file while fetchmail is running in daemon mode,  this  will  be
       detected  at  the beginning of the next poll cycle.  When a changed <u><a href="file:~/.fetchmailrc">~/.fetchmailrc</a></u> is detected, fetchmail
       rereads it and restarts from scratch (using  <a href="../man2/exec.2.html">exec</a>(2);  no  state  information  is  retained  in  the  new
       instance).   Note that if fetchmail needs to query for passwords, of that if you break the <u><a href="file:~/.fetchmailrc">~/.fetchmailrc</a></u>
       file's syntax, the new instance will softly and silently vanish away on startup.

</pre><h4><b>ADMINISTRATIVE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>--postmaster</b> <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> option (keyword: set postmaster) specifies  the  last-resort  username  to  which
       multidrop  mail  is  to  be  forwarded  if  no  matching local recipient can be found. It is also used as
       destination of undeliverable mail if the 'bouncemail' global option is off  and  additionally  for  spam-
       blocked  mail  if  the  'bouncemail'  global option is off and the 'spambounce' global option is on. This
       option defaults to the user who invoked <b>fetchmail</b>.  If the invoking user is root,  then  the  default  of
       this  option  is  the  user  'postmaster'.   Setting  postmaster  to the empty string causes such mail as
       described above to be discarded - this however is usually a bad idea.  See also the  description  of  the
       'FETCHMAILUSER' environment variable in the ENVIRONMENT section below.

       The <b>--nobounce</b> behaves like the "set no bouncemail" global option, which see.

       The  <b>--invisible</b>  option (keyword: set invisible) tries to make fetchmail invisible.  Normally, fetchmail
       behaves like any other MTA would -- it generates a Received header into each message describing its place
       in the chain of transmission, and tells the MTA it forwards to  that  the  mail  came  from  the  machine
       fetchmail  itself  is  running  on.  If the invisible option is on, the Received header is suppressed and
       fetchmail tries to spoof the MTA it forwards to into thinking it came directly from the mail server host.

       The <b>--showdots</b> option (keyword: set showdots) forces fetchmail to show progress dots even if  the  output
       goes  to  a  file  or  fetchmail is not in verbose mode.  Fetchmail shows the dots by default when run in
       --verbose mode <u>and</u> output goes to console. This option is ignored in --silent mode.

       By specifying the <b>--tracepolls</b> option, you can ask fetchmail to add information to the Received header on
       the form "polling {label} account {user}", where {label} is the account label (from the specified rcfile,
       normally <a href="file:~/.fetchmailrc">~/.fetchmailrc</a>) and {user} is the username which is used to log on  to  the  mail  server.  This
       header  can  be used to make filtering email where no useful header information is available and you want
       mail from different accounts sorted into different mailboxes (this could, for example, occur if you  have
       an account on the same server running a mailing list, and are subscribed to the list using that account).
       The default is not adding any such header.  In <u>.fetchmailrc</u>, this is called 'tracepolls'.

</pre><h4><b>RETRIEVAL</b> <b>FAILURE</b> <b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
       The  protocols  <b>fetchmail</b>  uses  to  talk  to  mail servers are next to bulletproof.  In normal operation
       forwarding to port 25, no message is ever deleted (or even marked for deletion) on  the  host  until  the
       SMTP  listener on the client side has acknowledged to <b>fetchmail</b> that the message has been either accepted
       for delivery or rejected due to a spam block.

       When forwarding to an MDA, however, there is more  possibility  of  error.   Some  MDAs  are  'safe'  and
       reliably  return  a nonzero status on any delivery error, even one due to temporary resource limits.  The
       <b><a href="../man1/maildrop.1.html">maildrop</a></b>(1) program is like this; so are most  programs  designed  as  mail  transport  agents,  such  as
       <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1),  including the sendmail wrapper of Postfix and <b><a href="../man1/exim.1.html">exim</a></b>(1).  These programs give back a reliable
       positive acknowledgement and can be used with the mda option with no risk of  mail  loss.   Unsafe  MDAs,
       though, may return 0 even on delivery failure.  If this happens, you will lose mail.

       The normal mode of <b>fetchmail</b> is to try to download only 'new' messages, leaving untouched (and undeleted)
       messages you have already read directly on the server (or fetched with a previous <u>fetchmail</u> <u>--keep</u>).  But
       you  may find that messages you have already read on the server are being fetched (and deleted) even when
       you do not specify --all.  There are several reasons this can happen.

       One could be that you are using POP2.  The POP2 protocol includes no representation  of  'new'  or  'old'
       state  in  messages,  so <b>fetchmail</b> must treat all messages as new all the time.  But POP2 is obsolete, so
       this is unlikely.

       A potential POP3 problem might be servers that insert messages in  the  middle  of  mailboxes  (some  VMS
       implementations  of  mail  are  rumored  to  do  this).  The <b>fetchmail</b> code assumes that new messages are
       appended to the end of the mailbox; when this is not true it may treat some old messages as new and  vice
       versa.  Using UIDL whilst setting fastuidl 0 might fix this, otherwise, consider switching to IMAP.

       Yet  another  POP3 problem is that if they cannot make temporary files in the user's home directory, some
       POP3 servers will hand back an undocumented response that  causes  fetchmail  to  spuriously  report  "No
       mail".

       The IMAP code uses the presence or absence of the server flag \Seen to decide whether or not a message is
       new.   This is not the right thing to do, fetchmail should check the UIDVALIDITY and use UID, but it does
       not do that yet. Under Unix, it counts on your IMAP server to notice the BSD-style Status  flags  set  by
       mail  user agents and set the \Seen flag from them when appropriate.  All Unix IMAP servers we know of do
       this, though it is not specified by the IMAP RFCs.  If you ever trip over a server  that  does  not,  the
       symptom  will  be  that messages you have already read on your host will look new to the server.  In this
       (unlikely) case, only messages you fetched with <u>fetchmail</u> <u>--keep</u> will be both undeleted and marked old.

       In ETRN and ODMR modes, <b>fetchmail</b> does not actually retrieve messages; instead, it asks the server's SMTP
       listener to start a queue flush to the client via SMTP.  Therefore it sends only undelivered messages.

</pre><h4><b>SPAM</b> <b>FILTERING</b></h4><pre>
       Many SMTP listeners allow administrators to set up 'spam  filters'  that  block  unsolicited  email  from
       specified  domains.   A  MAIL  FROM  or DATA line that triggers this feature will elicit an SMTP response
       which (unfortunately) varies according to the listener.

       Newer versions of <b>sendmail</b> return an error code of 571.

       According to RFC2821, the correct thing to return in this situation is 550 "Requested action  not  taken:
       mailbox unavailable" (the draft adds "[E.g., mailbox not found, no access, or command rejected for policy
       reasons].").

       Older versions of the <b>exim</b> MTA return 501 "Syntax error in parameters or arguments".

       The <b>postfix</b> MTA runs 554 as an antispam response.

       <b>Zmailer</b>  may  reject  code  with  a  500 response (followed by an enhanced status code that contains more
       information).

       Return codes which <b>fetchmail</b> treats as antispam responses and discards the message can be  set  with  the
       'antispam'  option.   This is one of the <u>only</u> three circumstance under which fetchmail ever discards mail
       (the others are the 552 and 553 errors described below, and the  suppression  of  multi-dropped  messages
       with a message-ID already seen).

       If  <b>fetchmail</b>  is  fetching  from  an IMAP server, the antispam response will be detected and the message
       rejected immediately after the headers have been fetched, without reading the message  body.   Thus,  you
       will not pay for downloading spam message bodies.

       By default, the list of antispam responses is empty.

       If  the  <u>spambounce</u>  global  option  is  on, mail that is spam-blocked triggers an RFC1892/RFC1894 bounce
       message informing the originator that we do not accept mail from it. See also BUGS.

</pre><h4><b>SMTP/ESMTP</b> <b>ERROR</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       Besides the spam-blocking described above, fetchmail takes special actions — that may be modified by  the
       --softbounce option — on the following SMTP/ESMTP error response codes

       452 (insufficient system storage)
            Leave the message in the server mailbox for later retrieval.

       552 (message exceeds fixed maximum message size)
            Delete the message from the server.  Send bounce-mail to the originator.

       553 (invalid sending domain)
            Delete the message from the server.  Do not even try to send bounce-mail to the originator.

       Other  errors  greater  or  equal to 500 trigger bounce mail back to the originator, unless suppressed by
       --softbounce. See also BUGS.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>RUN</b> <b>CONTROL</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The preferred way to set up fetchmail is to write a <u>.fetchmailrc</u> file in your home directory (you may  do
       this  directly,  with  a text editor, or indirectly via <b>fetchmailconf</b>).  When there is a conflict between
       the command-line arguments and the arguments in this file, the command-line arguments take precedence.

       To protect the security of your passwords, your <u><a href="file:~/.fetchmailrc">~/.fetchmailrc</a></u> may  not  normally  have  more  than  0700
       (u=rwx,g=,o=)  permissions;  <b>fetchmail</b>  will  complain  and exit otherwise (this check is suppressed when
       --version is on).

       You may read the <u>.fetchmailrc</u> file as a list of commands to be executed when <b>fetchmail</b> is called with  no
       arguments.

   <b>Run</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Syntax</b>
       Comments  begin  with  a  '#'  and  extend through the end of the line.  Otherwise the file consists of a
       series of server entries or global option statements in a free-format, token-oriented syntax.

       There are four kinds of tokens: grammar keywords,  numbers  (i.e.,  decimal  digit  sequences),  unquoted
       strings, and quoted strings.  A quoted string is bounded by double quotes and may contain whitespace (and
       quoted  digits are treated as a string).  Note that quoted strings will also contain line feed characters
       if they run across two or more lines, unless you use a backslash to join lines (see below).  An  unquoted
       string  is any whitespace-delimited token that is neither numeric, string quoted nor contains the special
       characters ',', ';', ':', or '='.

       Any amount of whitespace separates tokens in server entries,  but  is  otherwise  ignored.  You  may  use
       backslash  escape  sequences  (\n  for  LF,  \t for HT, \b for BS, \r for CR, \<u>nnn</u> for decimal (where nnn
       cannot start with a 0), \0<u>ooo</u> for octal, and \x<u>hh</u> for hex) to embed non-printable  characters  or  string
       delimiters in strings.  In quoted strings, a backslash at the very end of a line will cause the backslash
       itself and the line feed (LF or NL, new line) character to be ignored, so that you can wrap long strings.
       Without the backslash at the line end, the line feed character would become part of the string.

       <b>Warning:</b>  while  these resemble C-style escape sequences, they are not the same.  fetchmail only supports
       these eight styles. C supports more  escape  sequences  that  consist  of  backslash  (\)  and  a  single
       character,  but  does  not  support  decimal  codes and does not require the leading 0 in octal notation.
       Example: fetchmail interprets \233 the same as \xE9 (Latin small letter e  with  acute),  where  C  would
       interpret \233 as octal 0233 = \x9B (CSI, control sequence introducer).

       Each  server  entry consists of one of the keywords 'poll' or 'skip', followed by a server name, followed
       by server options, followed by any number of user (or username) descriptions, followed by  user  options.
       Note: the most common cause of syntax errors is mixing up user and server options or putting user options
       before the user descriptions.

       For backward compatibility, the word 'server' is a synonym for 'poll'.

       You  can use the noise keywords 'and', 'with', 'has', 'wants', and 'options' anywhere in an entry to make
       it resemble English.  They are ignored, but can make entries much  easier  to  read  at  a  glance.   The
       punctuation characters ':', ';' and ',' are also ignored.

   <b>Poll</b> <b>versus</b> <b>Skip</b>
       The  'poll'  verb  tells  fetchmail to query this host when it is run with no arguments.  The 'skip' verb
       tells <b>fetchmail</b> not to poll this host unless it is explicitly named on the  command  line.   (The  'skip'
       verb  allows  you  to  experiment  with test entries safely, or easily disable entries for hosts that are
       temporarily down.)

</pre><h4><b>KEYWORD/OPTION</b> <b>SUMMARY</b></h4><pre>
       Here are the  legal  options.   Keyword  suffixes  enclosed  in  square  brackets  are  optional.   Those
       corresponding  to  short  command-line options are followed by '-' and the appropriate option letter.  If
       option is only relevant to a single mode of operation, it is noted as  's'  or  'm'  for  singledrop-  or
       multidrop-mode, respectively.

       All  user  options  must  begin  with  a user description (user or username option) and <u>follow</u> all server
       descriptions and options.

       In the .fetchmailrc file, the 'envelope' string  argument  may  be  preceded  by  a  whitespace-separated
       number.  This number, if specified, is the number of such headers to skip over (that is, an argument of 1
       selects  the  second  header  of  the  given type).  This is sometimes useful for ignoring bogus envelope
       headers created by an ISP's local delivery agent or internal forwards (through mail  inspection  systems,
       for instance).

   <b>Keywords</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Corresponding</b> <b>To</b> <b>Option</b> <b>Switches</b>
       The  'folder'  and 'smtphost' options (unlike their command-line equivalents) can take a space- or comma-
       separated list of names following them.

       All options correspond to the obvious command-line arguments, except the  following:  'via',  'interval',
       'aka', 'is', 'to', 'dns'/'no dns', 'checkalias'/'no checkalias', 'password', 'preconnect', 'postconnect',
       'localdomains', 'stripcr'/'no stripcr', 'forcecr'/'no forcecr', 'pass8bits'/'no pass8bits' 'dropstatus/no
       dropstatus', 'dropdelivered/no dropdelivered', 'mimedecode/no mimedecode', 'no idle', and 'no envelope'.

       The 'via' option is for if you want to have more than one configuration pointing at the same site.  If it
       is  present,  the  string argument will be taken as the actual DNS name of the mail server host to query.
       This will override the argument of poll, which can then simply be a distinct label for the  configuration
       (e.g., what you would give on the command line to explicitly query this host).

       The  'interval'  option (which takes a numeric argument) allows you to poll a server less frequently than
       the basic poll interval.  If you say 'interval N' the server this option is  attached  to  will  only  be
       queried every N poll intervals.

   <b>Singledrop</b> <b>versus</b> <b>Multidrop</b> <b>options</b>
       Please  ensure  you read the section titled <b>THE</b> <b>USE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ABUSE</b> <b>OF</b> <b>MULTIDROP</b> <b>MAILBOXES</b> if you intend to use
       multidrop mode.

       The 'is' or 'to' keywords associate the following local (client) name(s) (or server-name  to  client-name
       mappings  separated  by  =) with the mail server user name in the entry.  If an is/to list has '*' as its
       last name, unrecognized names are  simply  passed  through.  Note  that  until  <b>fetchmail</b>  version  6.3.4
       inclusively,  these  lists could only contain local parts of user names (fetchmail would only look at the
       part before the @ sign). <b>fetchmail</b> versions 6.3.5 and newer support full addresses on the left hand  side
       of these mappings, and they take precedence over any 'localdomains', 'aka', 'via' or similar mappings.

       A single local name can be used to support redirecting your mail when your username on the client machine
       is  different  from  your  name  on  the  mail  server.   When there is only a single local name, mail is
       forwarded to that local username regardless of the message's Received, To, Cc, and Bcc headers.  In  this
       case, <b>fetchmail</b> never does DNS lookups.

       When  there  is  more  than  one local name (or name mapping), <b>fetchmail</b> looks at the envelope header, if
       configured, and otherwise at the Received, To, Cc, and Bcc headers of retrieved mail (this is  'multidrop
       mode').   It  looks  for addresses with host name parts that match your poll name or your 'via', 'aka' or
       'localdomains' options, and usually also for host name parts which DNS tells it are aliases of  the  mail
       server.  See the discussion of 'dns', 'checkalias', 'localdomains', and 'aka' for details on how matching
       addresses are handled.

       If  <b>fetchmail</b>  cannot match any mail server usernames or localdomain addresses, the mail will be bounced.
       Normally it will be bounced to the sender, but if the 'bouncemail' global option is off, the mail will go
       to the local postmaster instead.  (see the 'postmaster' global option). See also BUGS.

       The 'dns' option (normally on) controls the way addresses from multidrop mailboxes are checked.   On,  it
       enables  logic  to  check each host address that does not match an 'aka' or 'localdomains' declaration by
       looking it up with DNS.  When a mail server username is recognized attached to a matching host name part,
       its local mapping is added to the list of local recipients.

       The 'checkalias' option (normally off) extends the lookups performed by the 'dns'  keyword  in  multidrop
       mode, providing a way to cope with remote MTAs that identify themselves using their canonical name, while
       they  are  polled  using  an alias.  When such a server is polled, checks to extract the envelope address
       fail, and <b>fetchmail</b> reverts to delivery using the To/Cc/Bcc headers (See below  'Header  versus  Envelope
       addresses').  Specifying this option instructs <b>fetchmail</b> to retrieve all the IP addresses associated with
       both  the poll name and the name used by the remote MTA and to do a comparison of the IP addresses.  This
       comes in handy in situations where the remote server undergoes  frequent  canonical  name  changes,  that
       would otherwise require modifications to the rcfile.  'checkalias' has no effect if 'no dns' is specified
       in the rcfile.

       The 'aka' option is for use with multidrop mailboxes.  It allows you to pre-declare a list of DNS aliases
       for  a  server.   This is an optimization hack that allows you to trade space for speed.  When <b>fetchmail</b>,
       while processing a multidrop mailbox, grovels through message headers  looking  for  names  of  the  mail
       server, pre-declaring common ones can save it from having to do DNS lookups.  Note: the names you give as
       arguments  to 'aka' are matched as suffixes -- if you specify (say) 'aka netaxs.com', this will match not
       just  a  host  name  netaxs.com,  but  any  host  name  that  ends  with  '.netaxs.com';  such  as  (say)
       pop3.netaxs.com and mail.netaxs.com.

       The  'localdomains' option allows you to declare a list of domains which fetchmail should consider local.
       When fetchmail is parsing address lines in multidrop modes, and a trailing segment of a host name matches
       a declared local domain, that address is passed through to the  listener  or  MDA  unaltered  (local-name
       mappings are <u>not</u> applied).

       If  you  are using 'localdomains', you may also need to specify 'no envelope', which disables <b>fetchmail</b>'s
       normal attempt to deduce an envelope address from the Received line or X-Envelope-To header  or  whatever
       header  has  been  previously  set  by  'envelope'.  If you set 'no envelope' in the defaults entry it is
       possible to undo that in individual entries by using 'envelope &lt;string&gt;'.  As a special  case,  'envelope
       "Received"' restores the default parsing of Received lines.

       The <b>password</b> option requires a string argument, which is the password to be used with the entry's server.

       The  'preconnect'  keyword  allows  you  to  specify a shell command to be executed just before each time
       <b>fetchmail</b> establishes a mail server connection.  This may be useful if  you  are  attempting  to  set  up
       secure POP connections with the aid of <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1).  If the command returns a nonzero status, the poll of that
       mail server will be aborted.

       Similarly,  the 'postconnect' keyword similarly allows you to specify a shell command to be executed just
       after each time a mail server connection is taken down.

       The 'forcecr' option controls whether lines terminated by LF  only  are  given  CRLF  termination  before
       forwarding.   Strictly speaking RFC821 requires this, but few MTAs enforce the requirement so this option
       is normally off (only one such MTA, qmail, is in significant use at time of writing).

       The 'stripcr' option controls whether carriage returns are stripped out of retrieved mail  before  it  is
       forwarded.   It is normally not necessary to set this, because it defaults to 'on' (CR stripping enabled)
       when there is an MDA declared but 'off'  (CR  stripping  disabled)  when  forwarding  is  via  SMTP.   If
       'stripcr' and 'forcecr' are both on, 'stripcr' will override.

       The  'pass8bits'  option  exists  to  cope  with  Microsoft  mail programs that stupidly slap a "Content-
       Transfer-Encoding: 7bit" on everything.  With this option off (the default) and such  a  header  present,
       <b>fetchmail</b>  declares  BODY=7BIT  to  an ESMTP-capable listener; this causes problems for messages actually
       using 8-bit ISO or KOI-8 character sets, which will be garbled by having the high bits of all  characters
       stripped.   If  'pass8bits'  is  on,  <b>fetchmail</b>  is  forced to declare BODY=8BITMIME to any ESMTP-capable
       listener.  If the listener is 8-bit-clean (as all the major ones now are) the right thing  will  probably
       result.

       The  'dropstatus'  option  controls  whether  nonempty  Status and X-Mozilla-Status lines are retained in
       fetched mail (the default) or discarded.  Retaining them allows your MUA to see what  messages  (if  any)
       were  marked seen on the server.  On the other hand, it can confuse some new-mail notifiers, which assume
       that anything with a Status line in it has been seen.  (Note: the empty Status  lines  inserted  by  some
       buggy POP servers are unconditionally discarded.)

       The  'dropdelivered'  option  controls  whether  Delivered-To  headers  will be kept in fetched mail (the
       default) or discarded. These headers are added by qmail and Postfix mail servers in order to  avoid  mail
       loops  but  may  get  in  your  way if you try to "mirror" a mail server within the same domain. Use with
       caution.

       The  'mimedecode'  option  controls  whether  MIME  messages  using  the  quoted-printable  encoding  are
       automatically converted into pure 8-bit data. If you are delivering mail to an ESMTP-capable, 8-bit-clean
       listener  (that  includes  all  of  the  major  MTAs like sendmail), then this will automatically convert
       quoted-printable message headers and data into 8-bit data, making it easier to  understand  when  reading
       mail.  If  your e-mail programs know how to deal with MIME messages, then this option is not needed.  The
       mimedecode option is off by default, because doing RFC2047 conversion on headers throws  away  character-
       set  information  and  can  lead  to  bad  results  if  the encoding of the headers differs from the body
       encoding.

       The 'idle' option is intended to be used with IMAP servers supporting the RFC2177 IDLE command extension,
       but does not strictly require it.  If it is enabled, and fetchmail detects that  IDLE  is  supported,  an
       IDLE  will be issued at the end of each poll.  This will tell the IMAP server to hold the connection open
       and notify the client when new mail is available.  If IDLE is not supported, fetchmail will  simulate  it
       by  periodically  issuing  NOOP.  If  you  need  to  poll  a  link frequently, IDLE can save bandwidth by
       eliminating TCP/IP connects and LOGIN/LOGOUT sequences. On the other hand, an IDLE  connection  will  eat
       almost  all  of your fetchmail's time, because it will never drop the connection and allow other polls to
       occur unless the server times out the IDLE.  It also does not work with multiple folders; only the  first
       folder will ever be polled.

       The  'properties'  option  is  an  extension  mechanism.  It takes a string argument, which is ignored by
       fetchmail itself.  The string argument may be used to store configuration information for  scripts  which
       require  it.   In  particular, the output of '--configdump' option will make properties associated with a
       user entry readily available to a Python script.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Run</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Options</b>
       The words 'here' and 'there' have useful English-like significance.  Normally 'user eric  is  esr'  would
       mean  that  mail for the remote user 'eric' is to be delivered to 'esr', but you can make this clearer by
       saying 'user eric there is esr here', or reverse it by saying 'user esr here is eric there'

       Legal protocol identifiers for use with the 'protocol' keyword are:

           auto (or AUTO) (legacy, to be removed from future release)
           pop2 (or POP2) (legacy, to be removed from future release)
           pop3 (or POP3)
           sdps (or SDPS)
           imap (or IMAP)
           apop (or APOP)
           kpop (or KPOP)

       Legal authentication types are 'any', 'password', 'kerberos', 'kerberos_v4', 'kerberos_v5' and  'gssapi',
       'cram-md5',  'otp',  'msn'  (only  for POP3), 'ntlm', 'ssh', 'external' (only IMAP).  The 'password' type
       specifies authentication by normal transmission of a password (the password may be plain text or  subject
       to  protocol-specific  encryption  as  in  CRAM-MD5); 'kerberos' tells <b>fetchmail</b> to try to get a Kerberos
       ticket at the start of each query instead, and send an arbitrary string as  the  password;  and  'gssapi'
       tells fetchmail to use GSSAPI authentication.  See the description of the 'auth' keyword for more.

       Specifying  'kpop' sets POP3 protocol over port 1109 with Kerberos V4 authentication.  These defaults may
       be overridden by later options.

       There are some global option statements: 'set  logfile'  followed  by  a  string  sets  the  same  global
       specified  by --logfile.  A command-line --logfile option will override this. Note that --logfile is only
       effective if fetchmail detaches itself from the terminal and the logfile already exists before  fetchmail
       is  run,  and  it overrides --syslog in this case.  Also, 'set daemon' sets the poll interval as --daemon
       does.  This can be overridden by a command-line --daemon option; in particular --daemon 0 can be used  to
       force  foreground  operation.  The  'set  postmaster'  statement sets the address to which multidrop mail
       defaults if there are no local matches.  Finally, 'set syslog' sends log messages to <a href="../man8/syslogd.8.html">syslogd</a>(8).

</pre><h4><b>DEBUGGING</b> <b>FETCHMAIL</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Fetchmail</b> <b>crashing</b>
       There are various ways in that fetchmail may "crash", i. e. stop operation suddenly and  unexpectedly.  A
       "crash"  usually  refers  to  an error condition that the software did not handle by itself. A well-known
       failure mode is the "segmentation fault" or "signal 11" or "SIGSEGV" or just "segfault" for short.  These
       can  be  caused by hardware or by software problems. Software-induced segfaults can usually be reproduced
       easily and in the same place, whereas hardware-induced segfaults can go away if the computer is rebooted,
       or powered off for a few hours, and can happen in random locations even if you use the software the  same
       way.

       For  solving  hardware-induced  segfaults, find the faulty component and repair or replace it.  The Sig11
       FAQ may help you with details.

       For solving software-induced segfaults, the developers may need a "stack backtrace".

   <b>Enabling</b> <b>fetchmail</b> <b>core</b> <b>dumps</b>
       By default, fetchmail suppresses core  dumps  as  these  might  contain  passwords  and  other  sensitive
       information. For debugging fetchmail crashes, obtaining a "stack backtrace" from a core dump is often the
       quickest  way  to  solve the problem, and when posting your problem on a mailing list, the developers may
       ask you for a "backtrace".

       1. To get useful backtraces, fetchmail needs to be installed without getting stripped of its  compilation
       symbols.   Unfortunately,  most  binary  packages  that  are  installed are stripped, and core files from
       symbol-stripped programs are worthless. So you may need to recompile fetchmail. On many systems, you  can
       type

               file `which fetchmail`

       to  find  out  if fetchmail was symbol-stripped or not. If yours was unstripped, fine, proceed, if it was
       stripped, you need to recompile the source code first. You do not usually need to  install  fetchmail  in
       order to debug it.

       2.  The  shell environment that starts fetchmail needs to enable core dumps. The key is the "maximum core
       (file) size" that can usually be configured with a tool named "limit" or "ulimit". See the  documentation
       for your shell for details. In the popular bash shell, "ulimit -Sc unlimited" will allow the core dump.

       3.  You  need  to  tell  fetchmail,  too,  to allow core dumps. To do this, run fetchmail with the <b>-d0</b> <b>-v</b>
       options.  It is often easier to also add <b>--nosyslog</b> <b>-N</b> as well.

       Finally, you need to reproduce the crash. You can just start  fetchmail  from  the  directory  where  you
       compiled  it  by  typing  <b>./fetchmail</b>,  so  the  complete  command line will start with <b>./fetchmail</b> <b>-Nvd0</b>
       <b>--nosyslog</b> and perhaps list your other options.

       After the crash, run your debugger to obtain the core dump.  The debugger will often be GNU GDB, you  can
       then  type  (adjust paths as necessary) <b>gdb</b> <b>./fetchmail</b> <b>fetchmail.core</b> and then, after GDB has started up
       and read all its files, type <b>backtrace</b> <b>full</b>, save the output (copy &amp; paste will do, the backtrace will be
       read by a human) and then type <b>quit</b> to leave gdb.  <b>Note:</b> on some systems, the core files  have  different
       names,  they  might contain a number instead of the program name, or number and name, but it will usually
       have "core" as part of their name.

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTION</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>RFC</b> <b>822</b></h4><pre>
       When trying to determine the originating address of a message, fetchmail looks  through  headers  in  the
       following order:

               Return-Path:
               Resent-Sender: (ignored if it does not contain an @ or !)
               Sender: (ignored if it does not contain an @ or !)
               Resent-From:
               From:
               Reply-To:
               Apparently-From:

       The  originating  address  is used for logging, and to set the MAIL FROM address when forwarding to SMTP.
       This order is intended to cope gracefully with receiving mailing list messages  in  multidrop  mode.  The
       intent  is that if a local address does not exist, the bounce message will not be returned blindly to the
       author or to the list itself, but rather to the list manager (which is less annoying).

       In multidrop mode, destination headers are processed as follows: First, fetchmail looks  for  the  header
       specified  by  the  'envelope'  option  in order to determine the local recipient address. If the mail is
       addressed to more than one recipient, the Received  line  will  not  contain  any  information  regarding
       recipient addresses.

       Then  fetchmail  looks for the Resent-To:, Resent-Cc:, and Resent-Bcc: lines.  If they exist, they should
       contain the final recipients and have precedence over their To:/Cc:/Bcc: counterparts.  If  the  Resent-*
       lines  do  not  exist,  the  To:,  Cc:,  Bcc: and Apparently-To: lines are looked for. (The presence of a
       Resent-To: is taken to imply that the person referred  by  the  To:  address  has  already  received  the
       original copy of the mail.)

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Note  that  although there are password declarations in a good many of the examples below, this is mainly
       for illustrative purposes.  We recommend stashing account/password pairs in your $HOME/.netrc file, where
       they can be used not just by fetchmail but by <a href="../man1/ftp.1.html">ftp</a>(1) and other programs.

       The basic format is:

              poll <u>SERVERNAME</u> protocol <u>PROTOCOL</u> username <u>NAME</u> password <u>PASSWORD</u>

       Example:

              poll pop.provider.net protocol pop3 username "jsmith" password "secret1"

       Or, using some abbreviations:

              poll pop.provider.net proto pop3 user "jsmith" password "secret1"

       Multiple servers may be listed:

              poll pop.provider.net proto pop3 user "jsmith" pass "secret1"
              poll other.provider.net proto pop2 user "John.Smith" pass "My^Hat"

       Here is the same version with more whitespace and some noise words:

              poll pop.provider.net proto pop3
                   user "jsmith", with password secret1, is "jsmith" here;
              poll other.provider.net proto pop2:
                   user "John.Smith", with password "My^Hat", is "John.Smith" here;

       If you need to include whitespace in a parameter string or start the latter with a  number,  enclose  the
       string in double quotes.  Thus:

              poll mail.provider.net with proto pop3:
                   user "jsmith" there has password "4u but u cannot krak this"
                   is jws here and wants mda "/bin/mail"

       You may have an initial server description headed by the keyword 'defaults' instead of 'poll' followed by
       a  name.   Such  a  record  is  interpreted  as defaults for all queries to use. It may be overwritten by
       individual server descriptions.  So, you could write:

              defaults proto pop3
                   user "jsmith"
              poll pop.provider.net
                   pass "secret1"
              poll mail.provider.net
                   user "jjsmith" there has password "secret2"

       It is possible to specify more  than  one  user  per  server.   The  'user'  keyword  leads  off  a  user
       description, and every user specification in a multi-user entry must include it.  Here is an example:

              poll pop.provider.net proto pop3 port 3111
                   user "jsmith" with pass "secret1" is "smith" here
                   user jones with pass "secret2" is "jjones" here keep

       This  associates  the  local  username  'smith' with the pop.provider.net username 'jsmith' and the local
       username 'jjones' with the pop.provider.net username 'jones'.  Mail for 'jones' is  kept  on  the  server
       after download.

       Here is what a simple retrieval configuration for a multidrop mailbox looks like:

              poll pop.provider.net:
                   user maildrop with pass secret1 to golux 'hurkle'='happy' snark here

       This  says  that the mailbox of account 'maildrop' on the server is a multidrop box, and that messages in
       it should be parsed for the server user names 'golux', 'hurkle', and 'snark'.  It further specifies  that
       'golux'  and 'snark' have the same name on the client as on the server, but mail for server user 'hurkle'
       should be delivered to client user 'happy'.

       <b>Note</b> that <b>fetchmail,</b> until version 6.3.4, did NOT allow full user@domain specifications here, these would
       never match.  <u>Fetchmail</u> 6.3.5 and newer support user@domain specifications on the  left-hand  side  of  a
       user mapping.

       Here is an example of another kind of multidrop connection:

              poll pop.provider.net localdomains loonytoons.org toons.org
                   envelope X-Envelope-To
                   user maildrop with pass secret1 to * here

       This  also  says  that  the  mailbox  of  account  'maildrop' on the server is a multidrop box.  It tells
       fetchmail that any address in the loonytoons.org or toons.org  domains  (including  sub-domain  addresses
       like   '<a href="mailto:joe@daffy.loonytoons.org">joe@daffy.loonytoons.org</a>')   should  be  passed  through  to  the  local  SMTP  listener  without
       modification.  Be careful of mail loops if you do this!

       Here is an example configuration using ssh and the plugin option.  The queries are made directly  on  the
       stdin and stdout of imapd via ssh.  Note that in this setup, IMAP authentication can be skipped.

              poll mailhost.net with proto imap:
                   plugin "ssh %h /usr/sbin/imapd" auth ssh;
                   user esr is esr here

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>USE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ABUSE</b> <b>OF</b> <b>MULTIDROP</b> <b>MAILBOXES</b></h4><pre>
       Use  the  multiple-local-recipients  feature  with  caution  --  it can bite.  All multidrop features are
       ineffective in ETRN and ODMR modes.

       Also, note that in multidrop mode duplicate mails may be suppressed.   A  piece  of  mail  is  considered
       duplicate  if  it  does  not  have  a  discernible envelope recipient address, has the same header as the
       message immediately preceding and more than one addressee.  Such runs of messages may be  generated  when
       copies  of  a  message  addressed  to  multiple  users  are delivered to a multidrop box. (To be precise,
       fetchmail 6.2.5 through 6.4.X use an MD5 hash of the raw  message  header,  and  only  fetchmail  6.4.16+
       document  this  properly.   Fetchmail  5.0.8  (1999-09-14) through 6.2.4 used only the Message-ID header.
       5.0.7 and older did not suppress duplicates.)

       Note that this duplication killer code checking the  entire  header  is  very  restrictive  and  may  not
       suppress  many  duplicates  in  practice  -  for  instance,  if some X-Original-To or Delivered-To header
       differs.  This is intentional and correct in such situations: wherever envelope information is available,
       it should be used for reliable delivery of mailing list and blind carbon copy  (Bcc)  messages.  See  the
       subsection Duplicate suppression below for suggestions.

   <b>Header</b> <b>versus</b> <b>Envelope</b> <b>addresses</b>
       The  fundamental  problem  is  that  by  having  your  mail server toss several peoples' mail in a single
       maildrop box, you may have thrown away potentially vital information about who each  piece  of  mail  was
       actually  addressed  to  (the  'envelope address', as opposed to the header addresses in the RFC822 To/Cc
       headers - the Bcc is not available at the receiving end).  This 'envelope address'  is  the  address  you
       need in order to reroute mail properly.

       Sometimes  <b>fetchmail</b> can deduce the envelope address.  If the mail server MTA is <b>sendmail</b> and the item of
       mail had just one recipient, the MTA will  have  written  a  'by/for'  clause  that  gives  the  envelope
       addressee  into its Received header. But this does not work reliably for other MTAs, nor if there is more
       than one recipient.  By default, <b>fetchmail</b> looks for envelope addresses in these lines; you  can  restore
       this default with -E "Received" or 'envelope Received'.

       <b>As</b>  <b>a</b>  <b>better</b>  <b>alternative,</b>  some  SMTP  listeners  and/or  mail  servers insert a header in each message
       containing a copy of the envelope addresses.  This header (when  it  exists)  is  often  'X-Original-To',
       'Delivered-To'  or  'X-Envelope-To'.   Fetchmail's  assumption  about  this can be changed with the -E or
       'envelope' option.  Note that writing an envelope header of this kind exposes  the  names  of  recipients
       (including  blind-copy  recipients) to all receivers of the messages, so the upstream must store one copy
       of the message per recipient to avoid becoming a privacy problem.

       Postfix, since version 2.0, writes an X-Original-To: header which contains a copy of the envelope  as  it
       was received.

       Qmail  and  Postfix generally write a 'Delivered-To' header upon delivering the message to the mail spool
       and use it to avoid mail loops.  Qmail virtual domains however will prefix the user name  with  a  string
       that normally matches the user's domain. To remove this prefix you can use the -Q or 'qvirtual' option.

       Sometimes, unfortunately, neither of these methods works.  That is the point when you should contact your
       ISP  and ask them to provide such an envelope header, and you should not use multidrop in this situation.
       When they all fail, fetchmail must fall back on the contents  of  To/Cc  headers  (Bcc  headers  are  not
       available  -  see  below)  to  try  to  determine  recipient  addressees -- and these are unreliable.  In
       particular, mailing-list software often ships mail with only  the  list  broadcast  address  in  the  To:
       header.

       <b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>future</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> <b>fetchmail</b> <b>may</b> <b>remove</b> <b>To/Cc</b> <b>parsing!</b>

       When  <b>fetchmail</b>  cannot  deduce a recipient address that is local, and the intended recipient address was
       anyone other than fetchmail's invoking user, <b>mail</b> <b>will</b> <b>get</b>  <b>lost.</b>   This  is  what  makes  the  multidrop
       feature risky without proper envelope information.

       A  related  problem  is  that  when you blind-copy a mail message, the Bcc information is carried <u>only</u> as
       envelope address (it is removed from the headers by the sending mail server, so fetchmail can see it only
       if there is an X-Envelope-To header).  Thus, blind-copying to someone who  gets  mail  over  a  fetchmail
       multidrop  link  will  fail  unless  the mail server host routinely writes X-Envelope-To or an equivalent
       header into messages in your maildrop.

       <b>In</b> <b>conclusion,</b> <b>mailing</b> <b>lists</b> <b>and</b> <b>Bcc'd</b> <b>mail</b> <b>can</b> <b>only</b> <b>work</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>server</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>fetching</b> <b>from</b>

       (1)    <b>stores</b> <b>one</b> <b>copy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> <b>per</b> <b>recipient</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>domain</b> <b>and</b>

       (2)    <b>records</b> <b>the</b> <b>envelope</b> <b>information</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>header</b> <b>(X-Original-To,</b> <b>Delivered-To,</b> <b>X-Envelope-To).</b>

   <b>Good</b> <b>Ways</b> <b>To</b> <b>Use</b> <b>Multidrop</b> <b>Mailboxes</b>
       Multiple local names can be used to administer a mailing  list  from  the  client  side  of  a  <b>fetchmail</b>
       collection.   Suppose  your  name  is  'esr',  and  you want to both pick up your own mail and maintain a
       mailing list called (say) "fetchmail-friends", and you want  to  keep  the  alias  list  on  your  client
       machine.

       On  your  server, you can alias 'fetchmail-friends' to 'esr'; then, in your <u>.fetchmailrc</u>, declare 'to esr
       fetchmail-friends here'.  Then, when mail including 'fetchmail-friends' as a local address gets  fetched,
       the  list  name  will  be  appended to the list of recipients your SMTP listener sees.  Therefore it will
       undergo  alias  expansion  locally.   Be  sure  to  include  'esr'  in  the  local  alias  expansion   of
       fetchmail-friends, or you will never see mail sent only to the list.  Also be sure that your listener has
       the  "me-too"  option  set  (sendmail's  -oXm command-line option or OXm declaration) so your name is not
       removed from alias expansions in messages you send.

       This trick is not without its problems, however.  You will begin to see this when a message comes in that
       is addressed only to a mailing list you do <u>not</u> have declared as a local name.   Each  such  message  will
       feature  an  'X-Fetchmail-Warning'  header which is generated because fetchmail cannot find a valid local
       name in the recipient addresses.  Such messages default (as was described above) to  being  sent  to  the
       local user running <b>fetchmail</b>, but the program has no way to know that this is actually the right thing.

   <b>Bad</b> <b>Ways</b> <b>To</b> <b>Abuse</b> <b>Multidrop</b> <b>Mailboxes</b>
       Multidrop  mailboxes and <b>fetchmail</b> serving multiple users in daemon mode do not mix.  The problem, again,
       is mail from mailing lists, which typically does not have an individual recipient address on it.   Unless
       <b>fetchmail</b> can deduce an envelope address, such mail  will  only  go  to  the  account  running  fetchmail
       (probably root).  Also, blind-copied users are very likely never to see their mail at all.

       If  you  are tempted to use <b>fetchmail</b> to retrieve mail for multiple users from a single mail drop via POP
       or IMAP, think again (and reread the section on header  and  envelope  addresses  above).   It  would  be
       smarter  to  just  let  the mail sit in the mail server's queue and use fetchmail's ETRN or ODMR modes to
       trigger SMTP sends periodically (of course, this means you have to poll more  frequently  than  the  mail
       server's expiry period).  If you cannot arrange this, try setting up a UUCP feed.

       If  you  absolutely  <u>must</u>  use multidrop for this purpose, make sure your mail server writes an envelope-
       address header that fetchmail can see.  Otherwise you <u>will</u> lose mail and it <u>will</u> come back to haunt you.

   <b>Speeding</b> <b>Up</b> <b>Multidrop</b> <b>Checking</b>
       Normally, when multiple users are declared <b>fetchmail</b> extracts recipient addresses as described above  and
       checks  each  host  part  with DNS to see if it is an alias of the mail server.  If so, the name mappings
       described in the "to ... here" declaration are done and the mail locally delivered.

       This is a convenient but also slow method.  To speed it up, pre-declare mail server aliases  with  'aka';
       these are checked before DNS lookups are done.  If you are certain your aka list contains <b>all</b> DNS aliases
       of  the  mail server (and all MX names pointing at it - note this may change in a future version) you can
       declare 'no dns' to suppress DNS lookups entirely and <u>only</u> match against the aka list.

   <b>Duplicate</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>on</b> <b>multidrop</b>
       If fetchmail's duplicate suppression code does not kick in for your multidrop mail account, other options
       is using sieve, or for instance Courier's maildrop package (and in particular, its reformail program with
       the -D option) as the delivery agent (either  from  fetchmail,  or  from  your  local  mail  server  that
       fetchmail injects into).

</pre><h4><b>SOCKS</b></h4><pre>
       Support  for socks4/5 is a <b>compile</b> <b>time</b> configuration option. Once compiled in, fetchmail will always use
       the socks libraries and configuration on your system, there are no run-time switches in fetchmail  -  but
       you  can  still configure SOCKS: you can specify which SOCKS configuration file is used in the <b>SOCKS_CONF</b>
       environment variable.

       For instance, if you wanted to bypass the SOCKS proxy altogether and have fetchmail connect directly, you
       could just pass SOCKS_CONF=/dev/null in the environment, for example (add your usual command line options
       - if any - to the end of this line):

       env SOCKS_CONF=/dev/null fetchmail

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       To facilitate the use of <b>fetchmail</b> in  shell  scripts,  an  exit status  code  is  returned  to  give  an
       indication of what occurred during a given connection.

       The exit codes returned by <b>fetchmail</b> are as follows:

       0      One  or  more  messages were successfully retrieved (or, if the -c option was selected, were found
              waiting but not retrieved).

       1      There was no mail awaiting retrieval.  (There may have been old mail still on the server  but  not
              selected  for retrieval.) If you do not want "no mail" to be an error condition (for instance, for
              cron jobs), use a POSIX-compliant shell and add

              || [ $? -eq 1 ]

              to the end of the fetchmail command line, note that this leaves 0 untouched, maps 1 to 0, and maps
              all other codes to 1. See also item #C8 in the FAQ.

       2      An error was encountered when attempting to open a socket to retrieve mail.  If you  do  not  know
              what  a  socket  is,  do  not worry about it -- just treat this as an 'unrecoverable error'.  This
              error can also be because a protocol fetchmail wants to use is not listed in /etc/services.

       3      The user authentication step failed.  This usually means that a bad user-id, password, or APOP  id
              was  specified.   Or  it may mean that you tried to run fetchmail under circumstances where it did
              not have standard input attached to a terminal and could not prompt for a missing password.

       4      Some sort of fatal protocol error was detected.

       5      There was a syntax error in the arguments to <b>fetchmail</b>, or a pre- or post-connect command failed.

       6      The run control file had bad permissions.

       7      There was an error condition reported by the server.  Can also fire if <b>fetchmail</b> timed  out  while
              waiting for the server.

       8      Client-side  exclusion  error.   This  means <b>fetchmail</b> either found another copy of itself already
              running, or failed in such a way that it is not sure whether another copy is running.

       9      The user authentication step failed because the server responded "lock busy".  Try again  after  a
              brief  pause!   This  error  is  not  implemented  for all protocols, nor for all servers.  If not
              implemented for your server, "3" will be returned  instead,  see  above.   May  be  returned  when
              talking  to  qpopper  or  other  servers  that  can  respond with "lock busy" or some similar text
              containing the word "lock".

       10     The <b>fetchmail</b> run failed while trying to do an SMTP port open or transaction.

       11     Fatal DNS error.  Fetchmail encountered an error while performing a  DNS  lookup  at  startup  and
              could not proceed.

       12     BSMTP batch file could not be opened.

       13     Poll terminated by a fetch limit (see the --fetchlimit option).

       14     Server busy indication.

       23     Internal error.  You should see a message on standard error with details.

       24 - 26, 28, 29
              These are internal codes and should not appear externally.

       When  <b>fetchmail</b>  queries more than one host, return status is 0 if <u>any</u> query successfully retrieved mail.
       Otherwise the returned error status is that of the last host queried.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:~/.fetchmailrc">~/.fetchmailrc</a>, $HOME/.fetchmailrc, $HOME_ETC/.fetchmailrc, $FETCHMAILHOME/fetchmailrc
            default run control file (location can be overridden with environment variables)

       <a href="file:~/.fetchids">~/.fetchids</a>, $HOME/.fetchids, $HOME_ETC/.fetchids, $FETCHMAILHOME/.fetchids
            default location of file recording last message UIDs seen per host.   (location  can  be  overridden
            with environment variables)

       <a href="file:~/.fetchmail.pid">~/.fetchmail.pid</a>, $HOME/.fetchmail.pid, $HOME_ETC/.fetchmail.pid, $FETCHMAILHOME/fetchmail.pid
            default  location  of  lock  file (sometimes called pidfile or PID file, see option pidfile) to help
            prevent concurrent runs (non-root mode).  (location can be overridden with environment variables)

       <a href="file:~/.netrc">~/.netrc</a>, $HOME/.netrc, $HOME_ETC/.netrc
            your FTP run control file, which (if present) will be searched for passwords as a last resort before
            prompting for one interactively.  (location can be overridden with environment variables)

       /var/run/fetchmail.pid
            lock file (pidfile) to help prevent concurrent runs (root mode, Linux systems).

       /etc/fetchmail.pid
            lock file (pidfile) to help prevent concurrent runs (root mode, systems without <a href="file:/var/run">/var/run</a>).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Fetchmail's behavior can be altered by providing it with  environment  variables.   Some  may  alter  the
       operation  of  libraries  that fetchmail links against, for instance, OpenSSL.  Note that in daemon mode,
       you will need to quit the background daemon process and start a  new  fetchmail  daemon  for  environment
       changes to take effect.

       <b>FETCHMAILHOME</b>
              If  this  environment  variable is set to a valid and existing directory name, fetchmail will read
              $FETCHMAILHOME/fetchmailrc (the dot is missing in this  case),  $FETCHMAILHOME/.fetchids  (keeping
              its  dot)  and  $FETCHMAILHOME/fetchmail.pid  (without  dot)  rather  than  from  the  user's home
              directory.  The .netrc file is always looked  for  in  the  invoking  user's  home  directory  (or
              $HOME_ETC) regardless of FETCHMAILHOME's setting.

       <b>FETCHMAILUSER</b>
              If  this  environment  variable  is set, it is used as the name of the calling user (default local
              name) for purposes such as mailing error notifications.  Otherwise, if either the LOGNAME or  USER
              variable is correctly set (e.g., the corresponding UID matches the session user ID) then that name
              is  used  as  the  default  local name.  Otherwise <b><a href="../man3/getpwuid.3.html">getpwuid</a></b>(3) must be able to retrieve a password
              entry for the session ID (this elaborate logic is designed to handle the case  of  multiple  names
              per user ID gracefully).

       <b>FETCHMAIL_DISABLE_CBC_IV_COUNTERMEASURE</b>
              (since  v6.3.22):  If  this  environment  variable  is set and not empty, fetchmail will disable a
              countermeasure against an SSL CBC IV attack (by setting SSL_OP_DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS).  This
              is a security risk, but may  be  necessary  for  connecting  to  certain  non-standards-conforming
              servers.   See  fetchmail's NEWS file and fetchmail-SA-2012-01.txt for details.  Earlier fetchmail
              versions (v6.3.21 and older) used to disable this countermeasure, but v6.3.22 no longer does  that
              as a safety precaution.

       <b>FETCHMAIL_POP3_FORCE_RETR</b>
              (since  v6.3.9):  If  this  environment variable is defined at all (even if empty), fetchmail will
              forgo the POP3 TOP command and always use RETR. This can be used as a workaround when TOP does not
              work properly.

       <b>FETCHMAIL_INCLUDE_DEFAULT_X509_CA_CERTS</b>
              (since v6.3.17): If this environment variable is set and not empty, fetchmail will always load the
              default X.509 trusted certificate locations for SSL/TLS CA certificates, even if <b>--sslcertfile</b> and
              <b>--sslcertpath</b> are given.  The latter locations take precedence over the system default  locations.
              This is useful in case there are broken certificates in the system directories and the user has no
              administrator privileges to remedy the problem.

       <b>FETCHMAIL_WOLFSSL_DEBUG</b>
              (since  v6.4.25):  If  fetchmail  is  compiled  and linked with wolfSSL, if wolfSSL was built with
              --enable-debug, and if this environment variable is set and not empty, then enable wolfSSL's debug
              mode. This will emit huge amounts of debug output to stderr.

       <b>HOME</b>   (documented since 6.4.1): This variable is normally set to the user's home directory. If it is set
              to a different directory than what is in the password database, HOME takes precedence.

       <b>HOME_ETC</b>
              (documentation corrected to match behaviour of code since 6.4.1): If the HOME_ETC variable is set,
              it will override fetchmail's idea of $HOME, i. e. fetchmail  will  read  .fetchmailrc,  .fetchids,
              .fetchmail.pid  and  .netrc  from  $HOME_ETC  instead of $HOME (or if HOME is also unset, from the
              passwd file's home directory location).

              If HOME_ETC and FETCHMAILHOME are both set, FETCHMAILHOME takes precedence and  HOME_ETC  will  be
              ignored.

       <b>SOCKS_CONF</b>
              (only  if  SOCKS  support  is  compiled in) this variable is used by the socks library to find out
              which configuration file it should read. Set this to /dev/null to bypass the SOCKS proxy.

       <b>SSL_CERT_DIR</b>
              (with truly OpenSSL 1.1.1 compatible library): overrides  OpenSSL's  idea  of  the  default  trust
              directory  or  path  (which  contains  individual  certificate files and hashed symlinks), see the
              <a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths.3.html">SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths</a>(3) manual page for details, it may be in the openssl  development
              package.   If  using  another library's OpenSSL compatibility interface, this may not work.  Since
              this variable only specifies a default value, the option --sslcertpath takes precedence if given.

       <b>SSL_CERT_FILE</b>
              (with truly OpenSSL 1.1.1 compatible library): overrides  OpenSSL's  idea  of  the  default  trust
              certificate  bundle  file  (which  contains  a concatenation of base64-encoded certificates in PEM
              format), see the <a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths.3.html">SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths</a>(3) manual page for details, it  may  be  in  the
              openssl development package.  If using another library's OpenSSL compatibility interface, this may
              not  work.   Since  this  variable  only specifies a default value, the option --sslcertfile takes
              precedence if given.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       If a <b>fetchmail</b> daemon is running as root, SIGUSR1 wakes it up from its sleep phase and forces a  poll  of
       all  non-skipped  servers.  For  compatibility  reasons,  SIGHUP can also be used in 6.3.X but may not be
       available in future fetchmail versions.

       If <b>fetchmail</b> is running in daemon mode as non-root, use SIGUSR1 to wake it (this  is  so  SIGHUP  due  to
       logout can retain the default action of killing it).

       Running  <b>fetchmail</b>  in  foreground  while a background fetchmail is running will do whichever of these is
       appropriate to wake it up.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS,</b> <b>LIMITATIONS,</b> <b>AND</b> <b>KNOWN</b> <b>PROBLEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Please check the <b>NEWS</b> file that shipped with fetchmail for more known bugs than those listed here.

       Fetchmail cannot handle user names that contain blanks after a "@" character, for  instance  "demonstr@ti
       on". These are rather uncommon and only hurt when using UID-based --keep setups, so the 6.X.Y versions of
       fetchmail will not be fixed.

       Fetchmail cannot handle configurations where you have multiple accounts that use the same server name and
       the same login. Any user@server combination must be unique.

       The assumptions that the DNS and in particular the checkalias options make are not often sustainable. For
       instance, it has become uncommon for an MX server to be a POP3 or IMAP server at the same time. Therefore
       the MX lookups may go away in a future release.

       The  mda and plugin options interact badly.  In order to collect error status from the MDA, fetchmail has
       to change its normal signal handling so that dead plugin processes do not get reaped until the end of the
       poll cycle.  This can cause resource starvation if too many zombies accumulate.  So either do not deliver
       to a MDA using plugins or risk being overrun by an army of undead.

       The --interface option does not support IPv6 and it is doubtful if  it  ever  will,  since  there  is  no
       portable way to query interface IPv6 addresses.

       The  RFC822  address  parser used in multidrop mode chokes on some @-addresses that are technically legal
       but bizarre.  Strange uses of quoting and embedded comments are likely to confuse it.

       In a message with multiple envelope headers, only the last one processed will be visible to fetchmail.

       Use of some of these protocols requires that the program  send  unencrypted  passwords  over  the  TCP/IP
       connection  to  the  mail  server.  This creates a risk that name/password pairs might be snaffled with a
       packet sniffer or more sophisticated monitoring software.   Under  Linux  and  FreeBSD,  the  --interface
       option  can  be  used  to restrict polling to availability of a specific interface device with a specific
       local or remote IP address, but snooping is still possible if (a) either host has a network  device  that
       can  be  opened in promiscuous mode, or (b) the intervening network link can be tapped.  We recommend the
       use of <b><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></b>(1) tunnelling to not only shroud your passwords but encrypt the entire conversation.

       Use of the %F or %T escapes in an mda  option  could  open  a  security  hole,  because  they  pass  text
       manipulable  by  an  attacker  to a shell command.  Potential shell characters are replaced by '_' before
       execution.  The hole is further reduced by the fact  that  fetchmail  temporarily  discards  any  set-uid
       privileges  it  may  have  while running the MDA.  For maximum safety, however, do not use an mda command
       containing %F or %T when fetchmail is run from the root account itself.

       Fetchmail's method of sending bounces due to errors or spam-blocking and spam bounces requires that  port
       25 of localhost be available for sending mail via SMTP.

       If  you modify <u><a href="file:~/.fetchmailrc">~/.fetchmailrc</a></u> while a background instance is running and break the syntax, the background
       instance will die silently.  Unfortunately, it cannot die noisily because we  do  not  yet  know  whether
       syslog should be enabled.  On some systems, fetchmail dies quietly even if there is no syntax error; this
       seems to have something to do with buggy terminal ioctl code in the kernel.

       The -f - option (reading a configuration from stdin) is incompatible with the plugin option.

       The 'principal' option only handles Kerberos IV, not V.

       Interactively  entered  passwords  are  truncated after 63 characters. If you really need to use a longer
       password, you will have to use a configuration file.

       A backslash as the last character of a configuration file will be flagged as a syntax error  rather  than
       ignored.

       The BSMTP error handling is virtually nonexistent and may leave broken messages behind.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       Fetchmail is currently maintained by Matthias Andree and Rob Funk with major assistance from Sunil Shetye
       (for code) and Rob MacGregor (for the mailing lists).

       Most of the code is from Eric S. Raymond.  Too many other people to name here have contributed  code  and
       patches.

       This  program  is  descended from and replaces <b>popclient</b>, by Carl Harris; the internals have become quite
       different, but some of its interface design is directly traceable to that ancestral program.

       This manual page has been improved by Matthias Andree, R. Hannes Beinert, and Héctor García.
