</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>complexity</b> - Measure complexity of C source

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>complexity</b> [<b>-flags</b>] [<b>-flag</b> [<u>value</u>]] [<b>--option-name</b>[[=| ]<u>value</u>]] [ &lt;file-name&gt; ... ]

       The  operands  that  this  program  operates  on may be specified either on the command line or read from
       standard input, one per line.  In that input, leading and trailing white space is stripped,  blank  lines
       are ignored.  Standard input may not be a terminal.

       Compute  the  complexity  of source code not just with a path-through-the-code count, but also amplifying
       line counts by logic level nesting.

       Compute the complexity of code by counting lines of non-comment source and multiplying by a nested  logic
       weight factor.  By default, 1.9.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  weight of each statement is the number of lines the statement uses.  This value is multiplied by the
       nested logic weighting (1.9 by default) for each layer of logic.  For example, this snippet:

           if (foo) {
             if (bar) {
               bumble; baz;
             }
           }

       will score 11.  This score is then scaled to approximate <b>pmccabe</b> results by dividing by 20 and  rounding.
       This scores "1" at the end.  <b>pmccabe</b> scores higher on simple procedures and <b>complexity</b> scores higher with
       more deeply nested logic.

       The  scoring  can  be  tweaked  by  adjusting the <b>--nesting-penalty</b> and <b>--scale</b>-ing factors.  The default
       values were calibrated by comparing the average results of millions of lines of code with the results  of
       <b>pmccabe</b>.

       For  the  purposes  of  this  program,  a  procedure  is identified by a name followed by a parenthesized
       expression and then an opening curly brace.  It ends with a closing curly brace in column 1.

       This program will perform its function for every file named on the command line or every file named in  a
       list  read  from  stdin.   The  arguments  or input names must be pre-existing files.  The input list may
       contain comments, which are blank lines or lines beginning with a '#' character.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-t</b> <u>minimum</u>, <b>--threshold</b>=<u>minimum</u> Reporting threshold.  This option takes an integer number as its
       argument.  The default <u>minimum</u> for this option is:
            30

       Ignore any procedures with a complexity measure below this threshold.  By default, a complexity score of
       under 30 is not printed.  However, if a histogram and statistics are to be printed, but not individual
       procedure scores, then the default is set to zero.  Procedures below this limit are not counted in the
       statistics.

       <b>--horrid-threshold</b>=<u>minimum</u> zero exit threshold.  This option takes an integer number as its argument.
       The default <u>minimum</u> for this option is:
            100

       If any procedures score higher than this threshold, then the program will exit non-zero.
       (<b>4/COMPLEX_EXIT_HORRID_FUNCTION</b>, if no other problems are encountered.)  By default, this program exits
       zero unless one function exceeds the horrid score of 100.

       <b>-n</b> <u>factor</u>, <b>--nesting-penalty</b>=<u>factor</u> score multiplier for nested code.

       Linguistic constructs weigh more heavily the more deeply nested they are.  By default, each layer
       penalizes by a factor of 1.9.  The option argument is a floating point number.  The penalty may be 1, but
       not less.

       <b>--demi-nesting-penalty</b>=<u>factor</u> score multiplier for nested expressions.

       By default, this value is halfway between 1.0 and the nesting penalty (specifically, the square root of
       the nesting penalty).  It refers to a parenthesized sub-expression. e.g.
           ((a &gt; b) &amp;&amp; (c &gt; d))
       contains two parenthesized sub-expressions.  This would count 3.5 points.  On the other hand, this:
           (a &gt; b &amp;&amp; c &gt; d)
       contains two relation operators and a logical operator at the same level.  These nested counts will be
       multiplied together and yield <b>2.5</b> <b>*</b> <b>2.5</b>, or <b>6.25</b>.  Don't do that.  It gets even worse if you have logical
       ands and ors at the same level.

       <b>-s</b> <u>factor</u>, <b>--scale</b>=<u>factor</u> complexity scaling factor.  This option takes an integer number as its
       argument.

       By default, the scaling is 20 which divides the raw score by 20.  This was normalized to roughly
       correspond to the <b>pmccabe</b> scores:

       <u>0-9</u> Easily maintained code.

       <u>10-19</u> Maintained with little trouble.

       <u>20-29</u> Maintained with some effort.

       <u>30-39</u> Difficult to maintain code.

       <u>40-49</u> Hard to maintain code.

       <u>50-99</u> Unmaintainable code.

       <u>100-199</u> Crazy making difficult code.

       <u>200+</u> I only wish I were kidding.
           Score | ln-ct | nc-lns| file-name(line): proc-name
            4707    3815    2838   lib/<a href="../man1747/vasnprintf.c.1747.html">vasnprintf.c</a>(1747): VASNPRINTF

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--histogram</b>, <b>--no-histogram</b> Display histogram of complexity numbers.  The <u>no-histogram</u> form will
       disable the option.  This option may not be preset with environment variables or in initialization (rc)
       files.

       Instead of printing out each function's score, a summary is printed at the end showing how many functions
       had particular ranges of scores.  Unless <b>--scores</b> is specifically called out, the scores will not print
       with this option specified.  The minimum scoring threshold will also be reduced to zero (0), unless
       <b>--threshold</b> is specified.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--scores</b>, <b>--no-scores</b> Display the score for each procedure.  The <u>no-scores</u> form will disable the
       option.  This option may not be preset with environment variables or in initialization (rc) files.

       If you specify <b>--histogram</b>, individual scores will not be displayed, unless this option is specified.

       <b>-I</b> <u>string</u>, <b>--ignore</b>=<u>string</u> procedure name to be ignored.  This option may appear an unlimited number of
       times.

       Some code has macros defined that confuse the lexical analysis.  This will cause them to be ignored.
       Other ways to cause functions to be ignored are:

       Use K&amp;R syntax for a procedure header.

       Use a preprocessing macro to assemble the procedure header.

       Simplify your code.
       Generally speaking, anything you do that alters normal C syntax will confuse the lexical analysis.  If a
       procedure is not seen, then it will not get counted.  If code within a procedure is incomprehensible, you
       will likely get inappropriate results.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--no-header</b> do not print scoring header.  This option may not be preset with environment variables or
       in initialization (rc) files.

       If a script is going to process the scoring output, parsing is easier without a header.  The histogram
       output will always have a header.

       <b>-u</b> <u>unifdef-opt</u>, <b>--unifdef</b>=<u>unifdef-opt</u> Run the source(s) through <a href="../man1BSD/unifdef.1BSD.html">unifdef</a>(1BSD).  This option may appear an
       unlimited number of times.

       Strip out sections of code surrounded by <b>#if/#endif</b> directives.  The option argument is passed as an
       argument to the <u><a href="../man1BSD/unifdef.1BSD.html">unifdef</a>(1BSD)</u> program.  For example:
           <u>complexity</u> -u-Dsymbol
       would cause <b>symbol</b> to be defined and remove sections of code preceded by <b>#ifndef</b> <b>symbol</b> directives.

       Please see the <u>unifdef</u> documentation for more information.

       <b>--unif-exe</b>=<u>prog</u> Specify the unifdef program.

       Alternate program to use for unifdef-ing the input.

       <b>-i</b> <u>file-name</u>, <b>--input</b>=<u>file-name</u> file of file list.

       Instead of either a command line list of input files or reading them from standard input, read the list
       of files from this file.

       <b>--trace</b>=<u>file-name</u> trace output file.

       Print intermediate scores to a trace file.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b> Display usage information and exit.

       <b>-!</b>, <b>--more-help</b> Pass the extended usage information through a pager.

       <b>-&gt;</b> [<u>cfgfile</u>], <b>--save-opts</b> [=<u>cfgfile</u>] Save the option state to <u>cfgfile</u>.  The default is the <u>last</u>
       configuration file listed in the <b>OPTION</b> <b>PRESETS</b> section, below.  The command will exit after updating the
       config file.

       <b>-&lt;</b> <u>cfgfile</u>, <b>--load-opts</b>=<u>cfgfile</u>, <b>--no-load-opts</b> Load options from <u>cfgfile</u>.  The <u>no-load-opts</u> form will
       disable the loading of earlier config/rc/ini files.  <u>--no-load-opts</u> is handled early, out of order.

       <b>-v</b> [{<u>v|c|n</u> <b>--version</b> [{<u>v|c|n</u>}]}] Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a simple
       version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information and `n' will print the full copyright notice.

       <b>OPTION</b> <b>PRESETS</b>
              Any option that  is  not  marked  as  <u>not</u>  <u>presettable</u>  may  be  preset  by  loading  values  from
              configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s) and values from environment variables named:
                <b>COMPLEXITY_&lt;option-name&gt;</b> or <b>COMPLEXITY</b>
              The environmental presets take precedence (are processed later than) the configuration files.  The
              <u>homerc</u>  files  are  "<u>$@/complex.conf</u>",  "<u>$HOME</u>", "<u>$PROJECT_ROOT/complex.conf</u>", and "<u>.</u>".  If any of
              these are directories, then the file <u>.complexityrc</u> is searched for within those directories.

       This program does not recognize K&amp;R procedure headers.

       Some  procedures  still get missed.  Usually, these are procedures that use the C pre-processor to extend
       the C language in some way.

       Initialized variable definitions  within  procedures  have  the  initializing  elements  counted  in  the
       complexity calculation.
