</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>nvidia-settings</b>  utility  is  a  tool  for  configuring  the NVIDIA graphics driver.  It operates by
       communicating with the NVIDIA X driver, querying and updating state as appropriate.   This  communication
       is done via the NV-CONTROL, GLX, XVideo, and RandR X extensions.

       Values  such  as brightness and gamma, XVideo attributes, temperature, and OpenGL settings can be queried
       and configured via <b>nvidia-settings.</b>

       When <b>nvidia-settings</b> starts, it reads the current settings from its configuration file  and  sends  those
       settings to the X server.  Then, it displays a graphical user interface (GUI) for configuring the current
       settings.   When  <b>nvidia-settings</b> exits, it queries the current settings from the X server and saves them
       to the configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Print the <b>nvidia-settings</b> version and exit.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print usage information and exit.

       <b>--config=</b><u>CONFIG</u>
              Use the configuration file <u>CONFIG</u> rather than the default <u><a href="file:~/.nvidia-settings-rc">~/.nvidia-settings-rc</a></u>

       <b>-c</b> <u>CTRL-DISPLAY</u><b>,</b> <b>--ctrl-display=</b><u>CTRL-DISPLAY</u>
              Control the specified X display.  If this option is not given, then <b>nvidia-settings</b>  will  control
              the  display  specified  by  <b>'--display'</b>  ;  if  that  is not given, then the <u>$DISPLAY</u> environment
              variable is used.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--load-config-only</b>
              Load the configuration file, send the values specified therein to the X server,  and  exit.   This
              mode of operation is useful to place in your xinitrc file, for example.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--no-config</b>
              Do  not  load  the  configuration  file.   This mode of operation is useful if <b>nvidia-settings</b> has
              difficulties starting due to problems with applying settings in the configuration file.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--rewrite-config-file</b>
              Write the X server configuration to  the  configuration  file,  and  exit,  without  starting  the
              graphical user interface.  See EXAMPLES section.

       <b>-V</b> <u>VERBOSE</u><b>,</b> <b>--verbose=</b><u>VERBOSE</u>
              Controls how much information is printed.  Valid values are <b>'none'</b> (do not print status messages),
              <b>'errors'</b> (print error messages), <b>'deprecations'</b> (print error and deprecation messages), <b>'warnings'</b>
              (print error, deprecation, and warning messages), and <b>'all'</b> (print error, deprecation, warning and
              other informational messages).  By default, <b>'deprecations'</b> is set.

       <b>-a</b> <u>ASSIGN</u><b>,</b> <b>--assign=</b><u>ASSIGN</u>
              The <u>ASSIGN</u> argument to the <b>'--assign'</b> command line option is of the form:

                {DISPLAY}/{attribute name}[{display devices}]={value}

              This  assigns  the  attribute  {attribute  name}  to the value {value} on the X Display {DISPLAY}.
              {DISPLAY} follows the usual {host}:{display}.{screen} syntax of the DISPLAY  environment  variable
              and  is  optional;  when  it  is  not specified, then it is implied following the same rule as the
              <b>--ctrl-display</b> option.  If the X screen is not specified, then the assignment is  made  to  all  X
              screens.  Note that the '/' is only required when {DISPLAY} is present.

              {DISPLAY}  can  additionally  include  a target specification to direct an assignment to something
              other than an X screen.  A target specification is contained within brackets  and  consists  of  a
              target  type  name, a colon, and the target id.  The target type name can be one of <b>screen</b> <b>,</b> <b>gpu</b> <b>,</b>
              <b>framelock</b> <b>,</b> <b>fan</b> <b>,</b> <b>thermalsensor</b> <b>,</b> <b>svp</b> <b>,</b> or <b>dpy</b> <b>;</b> the target id is  the  index  into  the  list  of
              targets  (for  that target type).  The target specification can be used in {DISPLAY} wherever an X
              screen can be used, following the  syntax  {host}:{display}[{target_type}:{target_id}].   See  the
              output of

                nvidia-settings -q all

              for information on which target types can be used with which attributes.  See the output of

                 nvidia-settings -q screens -q gpus -q framelocks -q fans -q thermalsensors -q svps -q dpys

              for lists of targets for each target type.

              The  [{display  devices}]  portion is also optional; if it is not specified, then the attribute is
              assigned to all display devices.

              Some examples:

                -a FSAA=5
                -a localhost:0.0/DigitalVibrance[CRT-0]=0
                --assign="SyncToVBlank=1"
                -a [gpu:0]/DigitalVibrance[DFP-1]=63

       <b>-q</b> <u>QUERY</u><b>,</b> <b>--query=</b><u>QUERY</u>
              The <u>QUERY</u> argument to the <b>'--query'</b> command line option is of the form:

                {DISPLAY}/{attribute name}[{display devices}]

              This queries the current value of the attribute {attribute name} on the X Display {DISPLAY}.   The
              syntax  is the same as that for the <b>'--assign'</b> option, without '= <b>{value}'</b> ; specify <b>'-q</b> <b>screens',</b>
              <b>'-q</b> <b>gpus',</b> <b>'-q</b> <b>framelocks',</b> <b>'-q</b> <b>fans'</b> , '-q thermalsensors', '-q svps', or '-q dpys'  to  query  a
              list  of  X  screens,  GPUs,  Frame Lock devices, Visual Computing Systems, Devices, Fans, Thermal
              Sensors, 3D Vision Pro Transceivers, or Display Devices, respectively, that are present on  the  X
              Display {DISPLAY}.  Specify <b>'-q</b> <b>all'</b> to query all attributes.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--terse</b>
              When  querying  attribute  values  with  the '--query' command line option, only print the current
              value, rather than the more verbose description of  the  attribute,  its  valid  values,  and  its
              current value.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--display-device-string</b>
              When  printing  attribute  values in response to the '--query' option, if the attribute value is a
              display device mask, print the value as a list of display devices (e.g., "CRT-0,  DFP-0"),  rather
              than a hexadecimal bit mask (e.g., 0x00010001).

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--glxinfo</b>
              Print GLX Information for the X display and exit.

       <b>-E,</b> <b>--eglinfo</b>
              Print EGL Information for the X display and exit.

       <b>-e</b> <u>DESCRIBE</u><b>,</b> <b>--describe=</b><u>DESCRIBE</u>
              Prints  information  about  a particular attribute.  Specify 'all' to list the descriptions of all
              attributes.  Specify 'list' to list the attribute names without a descriptions.

       <b>-p</b> <u>PAGE</u><b>,</b> <b>--page=</b><u>PAGE</u>
              The  <u>PAGE</u>  argument  to  the  <b>'--page'</b>  commandline  option  selects  a  particular  page  in  the
              nvidia-settings  user  interface  to  display upon starting nvidia-settings.  Valid values are the
              page names in the tree view on the left side of the nvidia-settings user interface; e.g.,

                --page="X Screen 0"

              Because some page names are not unique (e.g., a "PowerMizer" page is present under each GPU),  the
              page  name  can optionally be prepended with the name of the parent X Screen or GPU page, followed
              by a comma.  E.g.,

                --page="GPU 0 - (Quadro 6000), PowerMizer"

              The first page with a name matching the <u>PAGE</u> argument will  be  used.   By  default,  the  "System
              Information" page is displayed.

       <b>-L,</b> <b>--list-targets-only</b>
              When  performing  an  attribute  query  (from  the  '--query' command line option) or an attribute
              assignment (from the '--assign' command line  option  or  when  loading  an  <a href="file:~/.nvidia-settings-rc">~/.nvidia-settings-rc</a>
              file), nvidia-settings identifies one or more targets on which to query/assign the attribute.

              The  '--list-targets-only'  option  will  cause  nvidia-settings  to list the targets on which the
              query/assign operation would have been performed, without actually  performing  the  operation(s),
              and exit.

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--write-config,</b> <b>--no-write-config</b>
              Save the configuration file on exit (enabled by default).

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--use-gtk2</b>
              Force  nvidia-settings  to  use  the  GTK+  2  library  for the graphical user interface if a user
              interface is required. This option is only available on  systems  where  nvidia-settings  supports
              both the GTK+ 2 and GTK+ 3 user interfaces.

       <b>-I</b> <u>GTK-LIBRARY</u><b>,</b> <b>--gtk-library=</b><u>GTK-LIBRARY</u>
              Specify  the  graphical  user  interface  library  to  use  if a nvidia-settings user interface is
              required. This value may be the exact  location  of  the  library  or  it  may  be  the  directory
              containing  the  appropriately named library. If this is the exact location, the 'use-gtk2' option
              is ignored.

   <b>1.</b> <b>Layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nvidia-settings</b> <b>GUI</b>
       The <b>nvidia-settings</b> GUI is organized with a list of different categories on  the  left  side.   Only  one
       entry  in  the list can be selected at once, and the selected category controls which "page" is displayed
       on the right side of the <b>nvidia-settings</b> GUI.

       The category list is organized in a tree: each X screen contains the relevant subcategories  beneath  it.
       Similarly, the Display Devices category for a screen contains all the enabled display devices beneath it.
       Besides  each X screen, the other top level category is "nvidia-settings Configuration", which configures
       behavior of the <b>nvidia-settings</b> application itself.

       Along the bottom of the <b>nvidia-settings</b> GUI, from left to right, is:

       1)     a status bar which indicates the most recently altered option;

       2)     a Help button that toggles the display of a help window which provides a detailed  explanation  of
              the available options in the current page; and

       3)     a Quit button to exit <b>nvidia-settings.</b>

       Most  options  throughout <b>nvidia-settings</b> are applied immediately.  Notable exceptions are OpenGL options
       which are only read by OpenGL when an OpenGL application starts.

       Details about the options on each page of <b>nvidia-settings</b> are available in the help window.

   <b>2.</b> <b>How</b> <b>OpenGL</b> <b>Interacts</b> <b>with</b> <b>nvidia-settings</b>
       When an OpenGL application starts, it downloads the current values from the X driver, and then reads  the
       environment  (see  <u>APPENDIX</u>  <u>E:</u> <u>OPENGL</u> <u>ENVIRONMENT</u> <u>VARIABLE</u> <u>SETTINGS</u> in the README).  Settings from the X
       server override OpenGL's default values, and settings from the environment override  values  from  the  X
       server.

       For example, by default OpenGL uses the FSAA setting requested by the application (normally, applications
       do  not  request  any  FSAA).   An  FSAA  setting  specified in <b>nvidia-settings</b> would override the OpenGL
       application's  request.   Similarly,  the  <b>__GL_FSAA_MODE</b>  environment   variable   will   override   the
       application's FSAA setting, as well as any FSAA setting specified in <b>nvidia-settings.</b>

       Note  that an OpenGL application only retrieves settings from the X server when it starts, so if you make
       a change to an OpenGL value in <b>nvidia-settings,</b> it will only  apply  to  OpenGL  applications  which  are
       started after that point in time.

   <b>3.</b> <b>Loading</b> <b>Settings</b> <b>Automatically</b>
       The  NVIDIA  X  driver does not preserve values set with <b>nvidia-settings</b> between runs of the X server (or
       even between logging in and logging out of X, with <b><a href="../man1/xdm.1.html">xdm</a></b>(1), <b>gdm,</b> or <b>kdm</b> ).  This is  intentional,  because
       different  users  may have different preferences, thus these settings are stored on a per-user basis in a
       configuration file stored in the user's home directory.

       The configuration file is named <u><a href="file:~/.nvidia-settings-rc">~/.nvidia-settings-rc</a></u>.  You can specify a  different  configuration  file
       name with the <b>--config</b> command line option.

       After you have run <b>nvidia-settings</b> once and have generated a configuration file, you can then run:

            nvidia-settings --load-config-only

       at  any  time in the future to upload these settings to the X server again.  For example, you might place
       the above command in your <u><a href="file:~/.xinitrc">~/.xinitrc</a></u> file so that your settings are applied automatically when you log in
       to X.

       Your <u>.xinitrc</u> file, which controls what X applications should be started when you log into X (or startx),
       might look something like this:

            nvidia-settings --load-config-only &amp;
            xterm &amp;
            evilwm

       or:

            nvidia-settings --load-config-only &amp;
            gnome-session

       If you do not already have an <u><a href="file:~/.xinitrc">~/.xinitrc</a></u> file, then chances are that  <b><a href="../man1/xinit.1.html">xinit</a></b>(1)  is  using  a  system-wide
       xinitrc file.  This system wide file is typically here:

            /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc

       To  use  it,  but also have <b>nvidia-settings</b> upload your settings, you could create an <u><a href="file:~/.xinitrc">~/.xinitrc</a></u> with the
       contents:

            nvidia-settings --load-config-only &amp;
            . /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc

       System administrators may choose to place the <b>nvidia-settings</b> load command directly in the system xinitrc
       script.

       Please see the <b><a href="../man1/xinit.1.html">xinit</a></b>(1) man page for further details of configuring your <u><a href="file:~/.xinitrc">~/.xinitrc</a></u> file.

   <b>4.</b> <b>Command</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Interface</b>
       <b>nvidia-settings</b> has a rich command line interface: all attributes that can be manipulated  with  the  GUI
       can  also  be  queried and set from the command line.  The command line syntax for querying and assigning
       attributes matches that of the <u>.nvidia-settings-rc</u> configuration file.

       The <b>--query</b> option can be used to query the current value of attributes.  This will also report the valid
       values for the attribute.  You can run <b>nvidia-settings</b> <b>--query</b> <b>all</b>  for  a  complete  list  of  available
       attributes,  what the current value is, what values are valid for the attribute, and through which target
       types (e.g., X screens, GPUs) the attributes can be addressed.  Additionally, individual  attributes  may
       be specified like this:

               nvidia-settings --query Overlay

       An  attribute  name may be prepended with an X Display name and a forward slash to indicate a different X
       Display; e.g.:

               nvidia-settings --query localhost:0.0/Overlay

       An attribute name may also just be prepended with the screen number and a forward slash:

               nvidia-settings --query 0/Overlay

       in which case the default X Display will be used, but you can indicate to which X screen  to  direct  the
       query  (if  your X server has multiple X screens).  If no X screen is specified, then the attribute value
       will be queried for all valid targets of the attribute (eg GPUs, Displays X screens, etc).

       Attributes can be addressed through "target types".  A target type indicates the object that  is  queried
       when you query an attribute.  The default target type is an X screen, but other possible target types are
       GPUs, Frame Lock devices, Visual Computing Systems, fans, thermal sensors, 3D Vision Pro Transceivers and
       display devices.

       Target  types  give  you  different granularities with which to perform queries and assignments.  Since X
       screens can span multiple GPUs (in the case of Xinerama, or SLI), and multiple X screens can exist on the
       same GPU, it is sometimes useful to address attributes by GPU rather than X screen.

       A target specification is contained within brackets and may consist of a target type name, a  colon,  and
       the  target  id.   The target type name can be one of <b>screen,</b> <b>gpu,</b> <b>framelock,</b> <b>fan,</b> <b>thermalsensor,</b> <b>svp,</b> or
       <b>dpy;</b> the target id is the index into the list of targets (for that target type).   Target  specifications
       can  be  used wherever an X screen is used in query and assignment commands; the target specification can
       be used either by itself on the left side of the forward slash, or as part of an X Display name.

       For example, the following queries address X screen 0 on the localhost:

               nvidia-settings --query 0/VideoRam
               nvidia-settings --query localhost:0.0/VideoRam
               nvidia-settings --query [screen:0]/VideoRam
               nvidia-settings --query localhost:0[screen:0]/VideoRam

       To address GPU 0 instead, you can use either of:

               nvidia-settings --query [gpu:0]/VideoRam
               nvidia-settings --query localhost:0[gpu:0]/VideoRam

       Note that if a target specification is present, it will override any X screen specified  in  the  display
       name as the target to process.  For example, the following query would address GPU 0, and not X screen 1:

            nvidia-settings --query localhost:0.1[gpu:0]/VideoRam

       A  target  name  may  be  used  instead of a target id, in which case all targets with matching names are
       processed.

       For example, querying the DigitalVibrance of display device DVI-I-1 may be done like so:

            nvidia-settings --query [dpy:DVI-I-1]/DigitalVibrance

       When a target name is specified, the target type name may be omitted, though this  should  be  used  with
       caution since the name will be matched across all target types.  The above example could be written as:

            nvidia-settings --query [DVI-I-1]/DigitalVibrance

       The  target  name  may  also simply be a target type name, in which case all targets of that type will be
       queried.

       For example, querying the BusRate of all GPUs may be done like so:

            nvidia-settings --query [gpu]/BusRate

       The target specification may also include a target qualifier.  This is useful to limit  processing  to  a
       subset  of  targets,  based  on  an  existing  relationship(s) to other targets.  The target qualifier is
       specified by prepending a target type name, a colon,  the  target  id,  and  a  period  to  the  existing
       specification.  Only one qualitfer may be specified.

       For example, querying the RefreshRate of all DFP devices on GPU 1 may be done like so:

            nvidia-settings --query [GPU:1.DPY:DFP]/RefreshRate

       Likewise, a simple target name (or target type name) may be used as the qualifier.  For example, to query
       the BusType of all GPUs that have DFPs can be done like so:

            nvidia-settings --query [DFP.GPU]/BusType

       See the output of

               nvidia-settings --query all

       for what targets types can be used with each attribute.  See the output of

               nvidia-settings --query screens --query gpus --query framelocks --query fans --query thermalsensors --query svps --query dpys

       for lists of targets for each target type.

       To  enable  support for the "GPUGraphicsClockOffset" and "GPUMemoryTransferRateOffset" attributes, ensure
       that the "Coolbits" X configuration option includes the value "8" in  the  bitmask.   For  more  details,
       refer  to  the  documentation  of  the  "Coolbits"  option  in  the  NVIDIA  driver  README.   Query  the
       "GPUPerfModes" string attribute to see a list of the available performance modes:

            nvidia-settings --query GPUPerfModes

       Each performance mode is presented as a  comma-separated  list  of  "token=value"  pairs.   Each  set  of
       performance  mode  tokens  is separated by a ";".  The "perf" token indicates the performance level.  The
       "*editable" tokens indicate which domains within the performance level can have an offset  applied.   The
       "GPUGraphicsClockOffset"  and  "GPUMemoryTransferRateOffset" attributes map respectively to the "nvclock"
       and "memtransferrate" tokens of performance levels in the "GPUPerfModes" string.

       Note that the clock manipulation attributes  "GPUGraphicsClockOffset"  and  "GPUMemoryTransferRateOffset"
       apply  to  the  offsets  of  specific  performance  levels.  The performance level is specified in square
       brackets after the attribute name.  For example, to query the  "GPUGraphicsClockOffset"  for  performance
       level 2:

            nvidia-settings --query GPUGraphicsClockOffset[2]

       The <b>--assign</b> option can be used to assign a new value to an attribute.  The valid values for an attribute
       are  reported  when  the  attribute is queried.  The syntax for <b>--assign</b> is the same as <b>--query,</b> with the
       additional requirement that assignments also have an equal sign and the new value.  For example:

               nvidia-settings --assign FSAA=2
               nvidia-settings --assign [CRT-1]/DigitalVibrance=9
               nvidia-settings --assign [gpu:0]/DigitalVibrance=0
               nvidia-settings --assign [gpu:0]/GPUGraphicsClockOffset[2]=10

       Multiple queries and assignments may be specified  on  the  command  line  for  a  single  invocation  of
       <b>nvidia-settings.</b>   Assignments  are  processed  in  the  order  they are entered on the command line.  If
       multiple assignments are made to the same attribute or to multiple attributes with dependencies, then the
       later assignments will have priority.

       If either the <b>--query</b> or <b>--assign</b> options are passed to <b>nvidia-settings,</b> the GUI will not  be  presented,
       and  <b>nvidia-settings</b>  will  exit after processing the assignments and/or queries.  In this case, settings
       contained within the <u><a href="file:~/.nvidia-settings-rc">~/.nvidia-settings-rc</a></u> configuration file will not be automatically uploaded to the X
       server, nor will the  <u><a href="file:~/.nvidia-settings-rc">~/.nvidia-settings-rc</a></u>  configuration  file  be  automatically  updated  to  reflect
       attribute assignments made via the <b>--assign</b> option.

   <b>5.</b> <b>X</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Names</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Config</b> <b>File</b>
       In the Command Line Interface section above, it was noted that you can specify an attribute without any X
       Display qualifiers, with only an X screen qualifier, or with a full X Display name.  For example:

               nvidia-settings --query FSAA
               nvidia-settings --query 0/FSAA
               nvidia-settings --query stravinsky.nvidia.com:0/FSAA

       In  the  first  two  cases,  the  default X Display will be used, in the second case, the screen from the
       default X Display can be overridden, and in  the  third  case,  the  entire  default  X  Display  can  be
       overridden.

       The same possibilities are available in the <u><a href="file:~/.nvidia-settings-rc">~/.nvidia-settings-rc</a></u> configuration file.

       For  example,  in  a  computer lab environment, you might log into any of multiple workstations, and your
       home directory is  NFS  mounted  to  each  workstation.   In  such  a  situation,  you  might  want  your
       <u><a href="file:~/.nvidia-settings-rc">~/.nvidia-settings-rc</a></u>  file to be applicable to all the workstations.  Therefore, you would not want your
       config file to qualify each attribute with an X Display Name.  Leave the "Include X Display Names in  the
       Config File" option unchecked on the <b>nvidia-settings</b> Configuration page (this is the default).

       There  may  be  cases  when  you do want attributes in the config file to be qualified with the X Display
       name.  If you know what you are doing and want config file attributes to be qualified with an X  Display,
       check the "Include X Display Names in the Config File" option on the <b>nvidia-settings</b> Configuration page.

       In  the typical home user environment where your home directory is local to one computer and you are only
       configuring one X Display, then it does not matter whether each attribute setting is qualified with an  X
       Display Name.

   <b>6.</b> <b>Connecting</b> <b>to</b> <b>Remote</b> <b>X</b> <b>Servers</b>
       <b>nvidia-settings</b>  is an X client, but uses two separate X connections: one to display the GUI, and another
       to communicate the NV-CONTROL requests.  These two X connections do not need to be to the same X  server.
       For  example,  you might run <b>nvidia-settings</b> on the computer stravinsky.nvidia.com, export the display to
       the computer bartok.nvidia.com, but be configuring the X server on the computer schoenberg.nvidia.com:

               nvidia-settings --display=bartok.nvidia.com:0 \
                   --ctrl-display=schoenberg.nvidia.com:0

       If <b>--ctrl-display</b> is not specified, then the X Display  to  control  is  what  <b>--display</b>  indicates.   If
       <b>--display</b> is also not specified, then the <u>$DISPLAY</u> environment variable is used.

       Note,  however,  that  you  will  need  to have X permissions configured such that you can establish an X
       connection from the computer on which you are  running  <b>nvidia-settings</b>  (stravinsky.nvidia.com)  to  the
       computer  where  you  are displaying the GUI (bartok.nvidia.com) and the computer whose X Display you are
       configuring (schoenberg.nvidia.com).

       The simplest, most common, and least secure mechanism to do this is to use 'xhost' to allow  access  from
       the computer on which you are running <b>nvidia-settings.</b>

               (issued from bartok.nvidia.com)
               xhost +stravinsky.nvidia.com

               (issued from schoenberg.nvidia.com)
               xhost +stravinsky.nvidia.com

       This  will allow all X clients run on stravinsky.nvidia.com to connect and display on bartok.nvidia.com's
       X server and configure schoenberg.nvidia.com's X server.

       Please see the <b><a href="../man1/xauth.1.html">xauth</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/xhost.1.html">xhost</a></b>(1) man pages, or  refer  to  your  system  documentation  on  remote  X
       applications  and  security.   You  might  also Google for terms such as "remote X security" or "remote X
       Windows", and see documents such as the Remote X Apps mini-HOWTO:

            ⟨<a href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Remote-X-Apps.html">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Remote-X-Apps.html</a>⟩

       Please also note that the remote X server to be controlled must be using the NVIDIA X driver.

   <b>7.</b> <b>Licensing</b>
       The source code to <b>nvidia-settings</b> is released as GPL.  The most recent official version  of  the  source
       code is available here:

            ⟨https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/nvidia-settings/⟩

       Note  that  <b>nvidia-settings</b>  is  simply  an  NV-CONTROL  client.   It  uses the NV-CONTROL X extension to
       communicate with the NVIDIA X server to query current settings and make changes to settings.

       You can make  additions  directly  to  <b>nvidia-settings,</b>  or  write  your  own  NV-CONTROL  client,  using
       <b>nvidia-settings</b> as an example.

       Documentation   on  the  NV-CONTROL  extension  and  additional  sample  clients  are  available  in  the
       <b>nvidia-settings</b> source tarball.  Patches can be submitted to <a href="mailto:linux-bugs@nvidia.com">linux-bugs@nvidia.com</a>.

   <b>8.</b> <b>TODO</b>
       There are many things still to be added to <b>nvidia-settings,</b> some of which include:

       -      different toolkits?  The GUI for <b>nvidia-settings</b>  is  cleanly  abstracted  from  the  back-end  of
              <b>nvidia-settings</b>  that  parses  the  configuration  file  and command line, communicates with the X
              server, etc.  If someone were so inclined, a different front-end GUI could be implemented.

       -      write a design document explaining how <b>nvidia-settings</b> is designed; presumably this would make  it
              easier for people to become familiar with the code base.

       If there are other things you would like to see added (or better yet, would like to add yourself), please
       contact <a href="mailto:linux-bugs@nvidia.com">linux-bugs@nvidia.com</a>.
