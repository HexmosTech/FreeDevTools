</pre><h4><b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       Executes the same shell command in each project.

       The <b>-r</b> option allows running the command only on projects matching regex or wildcard expression.

       By  default,  projects  are  processed  non-interactively  in  parallel.  If  you want to run interactive
       commands, make sure to pass <b>--interactive</b> to force <b>--jobs</b> 1.  While the processing order of  projects  is
       not guaranteed, the order of project output is stable.

       Output Formatting

       The  <b>-p</b>  option causes 'repo forall' to bind pipes to the command's stdin, stdout and stderr streams, and
       pipe all output into a continuous stream that is displayed in a single pager  session.  Project  headings
       are  inserted  before  the  output  of  each command is displayed. If the command produces no output in a
       project, no heading is displayed.

       The formatting convention used by <b>-p</b> is very suitable for some types of searching, e.g. `repo  forall  <b>-p</b>
       <b>-c</b> git log <b>-SFoo</b>` will print all commits that add or remove references to Foo.

       The  <b>-v</b>  option  causes  'repo  forall'  to  display stderr messages if a command produces output only on
       stderr. Normally the <b>-p</b> option causes command output to be suppressed until the command produces at least
       one byte of output on stdout.

       Environment

       pwd is the project's working directory. If the current client is a mirror client, then  pwd  is  the  Git
       repository.

       REPO_PROJECT is set to the unique name of the project.

       REPO_PATH is the path relative the the root of the client.

       REPO_OUTERPATH is the path of the sub manifest's root relative to the root of the client.

       REPO_INNERPATH is the path relative to the root of the sub manifest.

       REPO_REMOTE is the name of the remote system from the manifest.

       REPO_LREV  is  the  name of the revision from the manifest, translated to a local tracking branch. If you
       need to pass the manifest revision to a locally executed git command, use REPO_LREV.

       REPO_RREV is the name of the revision from the manifest, exactly as written in the manifest.

       REPO_COUNT is the total number of projects being iterated.

       REPO_I is the current (1-based) iteration count. Can be used in conjunction  with  REPO_COUNT  to  add  a
       simple progress indicator to your command.

       REPO__*  are  any  extra  environment  variables, specified by the "annotation" element under any project
       element. This can be useful  for  differentiating  trees  based  on  user-specific  criteria,  or  simply
       annotating tree details.

       shell positional arguments ($1, $2, .., $#) are set to any arguments following &lt;command&gt;.

       Example: to list projects:

              repo forall <b>-c</b> 'echo $REPO_PROJECT'

       Notice  that $REPO_PROJECT is quoted to ensure it is expanded in the context of running &lt;command&gt; instead
       of in the calling shell.

       Unless <b>-p</b> is used, stdin, stdout, stderr are inherited from the terminal and are not redirected.

       If <b>-e</b> is used, when a command exits unsuccessfully, 'repo forall' will abort  without  iterating  through
       the remaining projects.
