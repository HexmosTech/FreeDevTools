</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vcsh</b> allows you to have several <b><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a></b>(1) repositories, all maintaining their working trees in $HOME without
       clobbering  each  other.  That, in turn, means you can have one repository per config set (zsh, vim, ssh,
       etc), picking and choosing which configs you want to use on which machine.

       <b>vcsh</b> is using a technique called fake bare Git repositories, keeping <u>$GIT_DIR</u> in  a  different  directory
       from <u>$GIT_WORK_TREE</u> which is pointed to <u>$HOME</u>.

       The use of symlinks is not needed in this setup, making for a cleaner setup.

       <b>vcsh</b> was designed with <b><a href="../man1/mr.1.html">mr</a></b>(1) in mind so you might want to install it alongside vcsh. That being said, you
       can easily use <b>vcsh</b> without <b>mr</b> if you prefer.

       A  sample  configuration  for  <b>vcsh</b> and <b>mr</b> can be found at <u>https://github.com/RichiH/vcsh_mr_template</u> and
       used with <b>vcsh</b> <b>clone</b> <b>https://github.com/RichiH/vcsh_mr_template</b> <b>mr</b>.

       Please note that you can always use a path instead of a name for <u>repo</u>. This is needed to support  mr  and
       other scripts properly and of no concern to an interactive user.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -c     Source <u>file</u> prior to other configuration files

       -d     Enable debug mode

       -v     Enable verbose mode

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       clone  Clone an existing repository.

              If you need to clone a bundle of repositories, look into the <b>post-clone-retired</b> hook.

              You  can  also  use  a single git repository with several branches. Use the <b>-b</b> option to specify a
              branch at clone time, the default is <b>master</b>.

       commit Commit in all repositories

       delete Delete an existing repository.

       enter  Enter repository; spawn new <u>$SHELL</u>.

       foreach
              Execute git command for every vcsh repository.

              <b>-g</b>: Execute in general context.

       help   Display help.

       init   Initialize an empty repository.

       list   List all local vcsh repositories.

       list-tracked
              List all files tracked by vcsh.

              If you want to list files tracked by a specific repository, simply append  the  repository´s  name
              last.

       list-tracked-by
              List files tracked by a repository.

              This is a legacy command; you should use <b>list-tracked</b> <b>&lt;repo&gt;</b> instead.

       list-untracked
              List all files NOT tracked by vcsh.

              <b>-a</b>: Show all files. By default, the <b>git</b> <b>ls-files</b> <b>--exclude-standard</b> is called.

              <b>-r</b>:  Recursive  mode.  By  default,  the  file list is shallow and stops at directory levels where
              possible.

              <b>$repo</b>: List files not tracked by this specific repository.

       pull   Pull from all vcsh remotes.

       push   Push to all vcsh remotes.

       rename Rename a repository.

       run    Run command with <u>$GIT_DIR</u> and <u>$GIT_WORK_TREE</u> set. Allows you to run any and all  commands  without
              any restrictions. Use with care.

              Please  note  that  there is a somewhat magic feature for run. Instead of <u>repo</u> it accepts <u>path</u>, as
              well. Anything that has a slash in it will be assumed to be a path. <b>vcsh</b> <b>run</b> will then operate  on
              this directory instead of the one normally generated from the repository´s name. This is needed to
              support mr and other scripts properly and of no concern to an interactive user.

       status Show statuses of all/one vcsh repositories.

       upgrade
              Upgrade repository to currently recommended settings.

       version
              Print version information.

       which <u>substring</u>
              Find <u>substring</u> in name of any tracked file.

       write-gitignore
              Write .gitignore.d/<u>repo</u> via <b>git</b> <b>ls-files</b>.

       <u>repo</u> <u>gitcommand</u>
              Shortcut to run <b>vcsh</b> on a repo. Will prepend <b>git</b> to <u>command</u>.

       <u>repo</u>   Shortcut to run <b>vcsh</b> <b>enter</b> <b>&lt;repo&gt;</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       As  noted  earlier, <b>vcsh</b> will set <u>$GIT_DIR</u> and <u>$GIT_WORK_TREE</u> to the appropriate values for fake bare Git
       repositories.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIG</b></h4><pre>
       There are several ways to turn the various knobs on <b>vcsh</b>. In order of ascending precedence, they are:

       •   <b>VARIABLE=foo</b> <b>vcsh</b>

       •   &lt;/etc/vcsh/config&gt;

       •   &lt;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vcsh/config&gt;

       •   <b>vcsh</b> <b>-c</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>

       Please note that those files are sourced. Any and all commands will be executed in the  context  of  your
       shell.

       Interesting knobs you can turn:

       <u>$VCSH_GITATTRIBUTES</u>
              Can be <u>none</u>, or any other value.

              <u>none</u> will not maintain Git attributes in a special location.

              If set to any other value, repo-specific gitattributes files will be maintained.

              Defaults to <u>none</u>.

       <u>$VCSH_GITIGNORE</u>
              Can be <u>exact</u>, <u>none</u>, or <u>recursive</u>.

              <u>exact</u> will seed the repo-specific ignore file with all file and directory names which <b>git</b> <b>ls-files</b>
              returns.

              <u>none</u> will not write any ignore file.

              <u>recursive</u> will descend through all directories recursively additionally to the above.

              Defaults to <u>exact</u>.

       <u>$VCSH_VCSH_WORKTREE</u>
              Can be <u>absolute</u>, or <u>relative</u>.

              <u>absolute</u> will set an absolute path; defaulting to <u>$HOME</u>.

              <u>relative</u> will set a path relative to <u>$GIT_DIR</u>.

              Defaults to <u>absolute</u>.

       Less interesting knobs you could turn:

       <u>$VCSH_DEBUG</u>
              Enter debug mode.

       <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</u>
              As      specified      in      the      ´XDG      Base      Directory      Specification´,     see
              <u><a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html">http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html</a></u>

              Defaults to &lt;$HOME/.config&gt;.

       <u>$VCSH_REPO_D</u>
              The directory where repositories are read from and stored.

              Defaults to &lt;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vcsh/repo.d&gt;.

       <u>$VCSH_HOOK_D</u>
              The directory where hooks are read from.

              Defaults to &lt;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vcsh/hooks-enabled&gt;.

       <u>$VCSH_BASE</u>
              The directory where repositories are checked out to.

              Defaults to <u>$HOME</u>.

</pre><h4><b>HOOK</b> <b>SYSTEM</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vcsh</b>  provides  a  hook  system.  Hook  scripts  must   be   executable   and   should   be   placed   in
       &lt;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vcsh/hooks-available&gt;.     From     there,     they    can    be    soft-linked    into
       &lt;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vcsh/hooks-enabled&gt;; <b>vcsh</b> will only execute hooks that are in this directory.

       Hooks follow a simple format. <u>pre-run</u> will be run before anything is run. If you want to have  more  than
       one  script  for  a  certain  hook,  just  append  any kind of string to order them. A system of <u>pre-run</u>,
       &lt;pre-run.10&gt;, &lt;pre-run.20&gt; etc is suggested; other options would be <u>pre-run-10</u>  or  &lt;pre-run.sh&gt;.  A  dot
       after the hook name is optional.

       If  you  want  to  create  hooks  for  a  specific <u>vcsh</u> repository, simply prepend the repository´s name,
       followed by a dot, i.e. &lt;zsh.pre-run&gt;. Otherwise, the same rules as above  apply.  The  dot  between  the
       repository´s name and the hook is mandatory, though.

       Available  hooks  are  <u>pre-clone</u>,  <u>post-clone</u>,  <u>post-clone-retired</u>, <u>pre-command</u>, <u>post-command</u>, <u>pre-enter</u>,
       <u>post-enter</u>,  <u>pre-init</u>,  <u>post-init</u>,  <u>pre-pull</u>,  <u>post-pull</u>,   <u>pre-push</u>,   <u>post-push</u>,   <u>pre-run</u>,   <u>post-run</u>,
       <u>pre-upgrade</u>,  and  <u>post-upgrade</u>. If you need more, vcsh is trivial to patch, but please let upstream know
       so we can ship them by default.

</pre><h4><b>OVERLAY</b> <b>SYSTEM</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vcsh</b>  also  provides  an  overlay   system.   Similar   to   hooks,   the   recommended   locations   are
       &lt;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vcsh/overlays-available&gt; and &lt;$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vcsh/overlays-enabled&gt;.

       Overlays  follow  the  same  rules  as hooks and you are free to overwrite any and all functions. Same as
       hooks, you can use global or repository-specific overlays by using either &lt;$VCSH_OVERLAY_D/$VCSH_COMMAND&gt;
       or &lt;$VCSH_OVERLAY_D/$VCSH_REPO_NAME.$VCSH_COMMAND&gt;.

       Please note that nothing stops you from, e.g. overwriting <b>status()</b> in  &lt;$VCSH_OVERLAY_D/commit&gt;.  As  the
       overlays  will  be  sourced  and  you  are  replacing  arbitrary functions, any and all features may stop
       working, or you may even lose data.

       You have been warned.

</pre><h4><b>DETAILED</b> <b>HOWTO</b> <b>AND</b> <b>FURTHER</b> <b>READING</b></h4><pre>
       Manpages are often short and sometimes useless to glean best practices from. While the  author  tried  to
       avoid this in this case, manpages can not cover detailed howtos.

       This software also comes with a file called &lt;README.md&gt;. It contains various approaches to setting up and
       using vcsh. You can view the file it as plain text or render it into various other formats via Markdown.

       On Debian-based systems, this file can be found in &lt;/usr/share/doc/vcsh&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b> <b>CONSIDERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vcsh</b>  allows  you to execute arbitrary commands via <b>vcsh</b> <b>run</b>. For example, adding a <b><a href="../man8/sudo.8.html">sudo</a></b>(8) rule for <b>vcsh</b>
       would be pretty stupid.

       Additionally, vcsh will source, i.e. execute, all files listed  in  <u>CONFIG</u>.  You  can  put  any  and  all
       commands into these config files and they will be executed.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       None are known at this time, but reports and/or patches are more than welcome.

</pre><h4><b>INTEROPERABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  rely  on <b>git</b> <b>submodule</b> use <b>git</b> 1.7.12 or later. Earlier versions do not clean internal variables
       properly before descending into submodules, resulting in unhappy end users.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       Like most people, the author initially made do with a single repository for  all  config  files,  all  of
       which were soft-linked into <u>$HOME</u>.

       Martin F. Krafft aka madduck came up with the concept of fake bare Git repositories.

       vcsh  was  initally  written by madduck. This version is a re-implementation from scratch with a lot more
       features. madduck graciously agreed to let the author take over the name.
