</pre><h4><b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       The 'repo upload' command is used to send changes to the Gerrit Code Review system. It searches for topic
       branches  in  local  projects that have not yet been published for review. If multiple topic branches are
       found, 'repo upload' opens an editor to allow the user to select which branches to upload.

       'repo upload' searches for uploadable changes in all projects listed at the command line. Projects can be
       specified either by name, or by a relative or absolute path to  the  project's  local  directory.  If  no
       projects  are  specified,  'repo upload' will search for uploadable changes in all projects listed in the
       manifest.

       If the <b>--reviewers</b> or <b>--cc</b> options are passed, those emails are added to the respective  list  of  users,
       and  emails  are  sent  to any new users. Users passed as <b>--reviewers</b> must already be registered with the
       code review system, or the upload will fail.

       While most normal Gerrit options have dedicated command line options, direct access to the Gerit  options
       is  available  via  <b>--push-options</b>.  This  is useful when Gerrit has newer functionality that repo upload
       doesn't yet support, or doesn't have plans to support.  See  the  Push  Options  documentation  for  more
       details: https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/user-upload.html#push_options

       Configuration

       review.URL.autoupload:

       To  disable the "Upload ... (y/N)?" prompt, you can set a per-project or global Git configuration option.
       If review.URL.autoupload is set to "true" then repo will assume you always answer "y" at the prompt,  and
       will  not  prompt  you  further. If it is set to "false" then repo will assume you always answer "n", and
       will abort.

       review.URL.autoreviewer:

       To automatically append a user or mailing list to reviews, you can set a per-project or global Git option
       to do so.

       review.URL.autocopy:

       To automatically copy a user or mailing list to all uploaded reviews, you can set a per-project or global
       Git option to do so. Specifically, review.URL.autocopy can be set to a comma separated list of  reviewers
       who you always want copied on all uploads with a non-empty <b>--re</b> argument.

       review.URL.username:

       Override  the  username  used  to  connect  to Gerrit Code Review. By default the local part of the email
       address is used.

       The URL must match the review URL listed in the manifest XML file,  or  in  the  .git/config  within  the
       project. For example:

              [remote "origin"]

              url = git://git.example.com/project.git review = <a href="http://review.example.com/">http://review.example.com/</a>

              [review "<a href="http://review.example.com/">http://review.example.com/</a>"]

              autoupload = true autocopy = <a href="mailto:johndoe@company.com">johndoe@company.com</a>,<a href="mailto:my-team-alias@company.com">my-team-alias@company.com</a>

       review.URL.uploadtopic:

       To  add  a topic branch whenever uploading a commit, you can set a per-project or global Git option to do
       so. If review.URL.uploadtopic is set to "true" then repo will assume you always want  the  equivalent  of
       the  <b>-t</b>  option  to  the  repo  command.   If unset or set to "false" then repo will make use of only the
       command line option.

       review.URL.uploadhashtags:

       To add hashtags whenever uploading a commit, you can set a per-project or global Git option to do so. The
       value of review.URL.uploadhashtags will be used as comma delimited hashtags like the <b>--hashtag</b> option.

       review.URL.uploadlabels:

       To add labels whenever uploading a commit, you can set a per-project or global Git option to do  so.  The
       value of review.URL.uploadlabels will be used as comma delimited labels like the <b>--label</b> option.

       review.URL.uploadnotify:

       Control                 e-mail                notifications                when                uploading.
       https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/user-upload.html#notify

       review.URL.uploadwarningthreshold:

       Repo will warn you if you are attempting to upload a large number of commits in one or more branches.  By
       default,  the  threshold  is  five commits. This option allows you to override the warning threshold to a
       different value.
