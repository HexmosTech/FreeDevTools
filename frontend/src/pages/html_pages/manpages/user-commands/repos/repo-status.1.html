</pre><h4><b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       'repo  status'  compares  the working tree to the staging area (aka index), and the most recent commit on
       this branch (HEAD), in each project specified. A summary is displayed, one line per file where there is a
       difference between these three states.

       The <b>-j</b>/--jobs option can be used to run multiple status queries in parallel.

       The <b>-o</b>/--orphans option can be used to show objects that are in the working directory, but not associated
       with a repo project. This includes unmanaged top-level files and directories, but  also  includes  deeper
       items.  For example, if dir/subdir/proj1 and dir/subdir/proj2 are repo projects, dir/subdir/proj3 will be
       shown if it is not known to repo.

       Status Display

       The  status  display  is  organized  into  three  columns  of  information,  for  example  if  the   file
       'subcmds/status.py' is modified in the project 'repo' on branch 'devwork':

       project repo/
              branch devwork

       <b>-m</b>     subcmds/status.py

       The  first  column  explains how the staging area (index) differs from the last commit (HEAD). Its values
       are always displayed in upper case and have the following meanings:

       -:     no difference

       A:     added         (not in HEAD,     in index                     )

       M:     modified      (    in HEAD,     in index, different content  )

       D:     deleted       (    in HEAD, not in index                     )

       R:     renamed       (not in HEAD,     in index, path changed       )

       C:     copied        (not in HEAD,     in index, copied from another)

       T:     mode changed  (    in HEAD,     in index, same content       )

       U:     unmerged; conflict resolution required

       The second column explains how the working directory differs  from  the  index.  Its  values  are  always
       displayed in lower case and have the following meanings:

       -:     new / unknown (not in index,     in work tree                )

       m:     modified      (    in index,     in work tree, modified      )

       d:     deleted       (    in index, not in work tree                )
