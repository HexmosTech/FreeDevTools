       flipbook - multi-frame editor and viewer derived from drawtool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>flipbook</b> <u>[-bookgeom]</u> <u>[-slideshow</u> <u>sec]</u> <u>['X-params']</u> <u>[file]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       flipbook  is a program derived from idraw/drawtool that supports multi-frame graphic display.  The zeroth
       frame is always visible as the background frame, and in front of it is displayed  the  current  frame  (1
       thru n).

       The Frame menu controls the frame display mechanism.  The operations are:

       Menu Item       Keyboard        Description
       -------------- --------  -----------
       Move Forward   ^F              move forward one frame
       Move Backward  ^B              move backward one frame
       Goto First Frame                move to the first frame
       Goto Last Frame                 move to the last frame
       New Forward      F              create new frame in front of the current
                                       frame and make it the current frame
       New Backward     B              create new frame in back of the current
                                       frame and make it the current frame
       Copy Forward     X              copy current frame in front of itself
       Copy Backward    Y              copy current frame in back of itself
       Delete           D              delete current frame (the zeroth frame
                                       can never be deleted)

       By  default  a  flipbook  document  is  positioned on the first frame when opened (if one exists).  "Move
       Backward" can be used to move to the background frame when positioned on the first frame.  "Move Forward"
       then returns to the first frame.

       The New command creates a document with only a background frame.  The "New After"  command  can  then  be
       used  to  initialize the first frame ("New Before" does not work when the current frame is the background
       frame).

       flipbook save/restores its documents with a document format specific to flipbook (and  possibly  programs
       derived  from  flipbook).   Idraw format drawings can be imported via the "Import Graphic" command (under
       the File menu).  The rest of the flexibile import mechanism of drawtool is supported  as  well.   "Export
       Graphic"  exports  currently selected graphics in idraw or drawtool format.  The Print command (under the
       File menu) generates a multi-page Postscript document, one page per frame except  for  the  zeroth  frame
       which is always the background.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       "-bookgeom"  brings  up  the  flipbook  in landscape mode, with a 906 by 700 pixel page size.  Useful for
       viewing illustrated books prepared in this mode.

       "-slideshow sec" continuously plays the contents of a flipbook  file  with  "sec"  delay  between  frames
       (currently only available when built with ACE).

       Also see "-help" for more options, and the comdraw, drawtool, and idraw man pages.
