</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       efsu - Ethernet Frame Send Utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>efsu</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>file</u> [<u>file</u>] [...]

       <b>efsu</b> [<u>options</u>] [&lt;<u>stdin</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Sends custom Ethernet frames over a specific host Ethernet interface.

       A frame is specified as a text stream of hexadecimal octets read from one or more frame description files
       or  from  stdin.   Each octet is converted to a binary byte, buffered and transmitted over the network on
       the specified host interface.  The program assumes that frames are valid and will transmit  whatever  you
       specify, right or wrong.  The program only checks minimum and maximum frame length.

       Frame  descriptions  are  stored  as  plain  text files.  Multiple frames may be specified in one file by
       separating them with a semicolon.  All descriptions in a file are read and sent immediately but  multiple
       files  may  be  specified  on  the  command  line  and  options  allow pauses between files, command line
       repetition and pauses between command line iterations.

       A frame descriptions is a continuous stream of hexadecimal digits.  Intervening text, punctuation,  white
       space  and comments are discarded.  Hex characters inside script-style, C-style or C++-style comments are
       ignored.  Script-style comments include all characters between a hash ('<b>#</b>') and the next newline or  EOF.
       C-style  and  C++-style  comments  follow  normal language rules.  Comments may be used to document frame
       descriptions or hide frame segments.  In the end, there must  be  an  even  number  of  hex  digits  that
       represent 60 to 1518 octets;

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -<b>d</b> <u>address</u>
              Replace  the destination Ethernet address of each transmitted frame with the option argument.  The
              destination address consists of 12 hex digits in upper,  lower  or  mixed  case.   Octets  may  be
              seperated with colons for clarity but colons are not required.

       -<b>e</b> <u>ethertype</u>
              Echo  received  frames  having  <u>ethertype</u>.   This effectively filters received frames but does not
              filter transmitted frames.  The ethertype is expressed in hexadecimal  without  the  "<b>0x</b>"  prefix.
              The keyword "<b>hp10</b>" can be used for <b>887B</b> and keyword "<b>hpav</b>" can be used for <b>88E1</b>.

       -<b>h</b>     Replace  the  source  address  of  each  transmitted  frame  with the Ethernet address of the host
              interface used to send the frame.   This  allows  frames  to  be  sent  correctly  from  any  host
              interface.  Use option <b>-i</b> to specify an interface.

       -<b>i</b> <u>interface</u>
              The  host  interface used to send frames.  The default is "<b>eth1</b>" because most people use "eth0" as
              their principle network connection; however, if the string "<b>PLC</b>" is  defined  in  the  environment
              then  it  will  over-ride  the  program default.  Any interface specified on the command line will
              over-ride the default.

       -<b>l</b> <u>count</u>
              Repeat command line <u>count</u> times by re-sending all files each time.  The default is <b>1</b>.

       -<b>p</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Pause between each file on the command line.  The default is <b>0</b> seconds.

       -<b>t</b> <u>timer</u>
              Read timeout in milliseconds.  Values range from 0 through UINT_MAX.  This  is  the  maximum  time
              allowed for a response.  The default is 50 milliseconds.

       -<b>v</b>     Dumps  transmitted  frames on stdout as they are sent.  If an Ethertype was specified using option
              <b>-e</b> the received frames having that Ethertype will also be dumped.

       -<b>w</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Wait between command line iterations.  The default is <b>0</b> seconds.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>file</u>   The name of a file containing one or more frame  specifications.   When  more  than  one  file  is
              specified,  <b>efsu</b>  behaves  like  the  <b>cat</b>  utility  by reading and sending each file in turn.  The
              program makes no assumptions based on filename or extension and enforces no filename  conventions;
              however,  giving  frame  description files the *.hex extension is a good convention.  Some toolkit
              distributions include example <b>.hex</b> files in the source folder.  These files  are  not  needed  for
              proper execution and may be deleted.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       One  way  to create a frame description file is to cut-and-paste output from a packet sniffer program and
       discard the line numbers and ASCII text columns.  You can then break out selected frame segments onto new
       lines and insert comments.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       For example, a simple file might look like:

          #!/usr/local/bin/efsu -ieth0
          # file: abc.hex
          # =====================================
          # this is an example frame description;
          # -------------------------------------
          00 B0 52 00 00 01
          // 00 B0 52 BE DE 73
          00 E0 45 DA DA 07
          88 E1
          /* content */
          00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
          00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
          00000000 0000 00 /* control byte */ 00
          00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
          00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
          00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

       The bang path permits direct execution of the file if 1) <b>efsu</b> is installed in the bang path directory, 2)
       the description file has execute permissions and 3) the user has execute privileges for that  file.   The
       script-style,  C++-style  and  C-style  comments  are  ignored  along  with  any  white  space.  Only the
       hexadecimal octets are read and sent.  Since the number of octets exceeds 60 and the number of digits  is
       even, <b>efsu</b> will report no errors and send the packet.  There is no guarantee that this packet is valid.

       Assuming  the above file is named <b>abc.hex</b>, we can transmit the file over the network as an Ethernet frame
       with the next command.  A hexadecimal dump of the transmitted frame appears on the console because option
       <b>-v</b> is present.

          # efsu abc.hex -v
          00000000 00 B0 52 00 00 01 00 E0 45 DA DA 07 88 E1 00 00 ..R.....E.......
          00000010 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
          00000020 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
          00000030 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
          00000040 00 00 00 00 00 00                               ......

       Since every host interface has a different hardware address,  one  can  replace  the  source  address  of
       transmitted  frames  with  the  actual  host  interface address using option <b>-h</b>.  Observe that the source
       address above has been replaced with that of the local host interface used to transmit the frame.

          # efsu abc.hex -vh
          00000000 00 B0 52 00 00 01 <b>00</b> <b>0F</b> <b>EA</b> <b>10</b> <b>D5</b> <b>1C</b> 88 E1 00 00 ..R.............
          00000010 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
          00000020 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
          00000030 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
          00000040 00 00 00 00 00 00                               ......

       You can also direct the frame to another device using option <b>-d</b>.  Observe that  the  destination  address
       above has been replaced with the one specified on the command line.

          # efsu abc.hex -vhd 00b052beef01
          00000000 <b>00</b> <b>B0</b> <b>52</b> <b>BE</b> <b>EF</b> <b>01</b> 00 0F EA 10 D5 1C 88 E1 00 00 ..R.............
          00000010 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
          00000020 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
          00000030 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
          00000040 00 00 00 00 00 00                               ......
