</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       edsu - Qualcomm Atheros Ethernet II Data Send Utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>edsu</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>file</u> [<u>file</u>] [...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Send one or more files as a series of Ethernet II (IEEE 802.2) frames.  Input files are sequentially read
       and sent over network as a continuous stream of standard Ethernet frames.  All frames (except perhaps the
       last  frame  for  each  file)  will  contain  1500  bytes  of file data.  The receiving host may elect to
       concatenate frame data as frames arrive.

       This program can be used to test remote Atheros UART-enabled powerline devices.  The remote  UART-enabled
       powerline  device  will  remove  frame  headers and forward frame data to the local host as a serial data
       stream.  No protocol is imposed on the serial data stream.  For example, there is no indication of  frame
       or  file  start  or  end within the stream.  The retmote powerline device must be in <b>Transparent</b> <b>Mode</b> and
       configured to accept frames from the sending host.  The remote host must also be ready to  handle  serial
       data as it arrives.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -<b>d</b> <u>xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx</u>
              The  Ethernet address of the destination device.  If the destination device is a Linux, Mac OSX or
              Windows host then program <b>edru</b> can be used to receive and write frame data to <b>stdout</b> as  a  serial
              stream.  If the destination device is an Atheros UART-enabled powerline device then received frame
              data  will be converted to a serial data stream and forwared to the host connected to that device.
              In that case, the UART-enabled powerline device must be programmed with the address of the sending
              host.

       -<b>e</b> <u>ethertype</u>
              The protocol (or ethertype) of interest expressed as a 16-bit hexadecimal integer.  Prefix "<b>0x</b>" is
              optional.  This filters out frames having any other ethertype.   The  default  is  <b>ETH_P_802_2</b>  as
              defined in <b>if_ether.h</b>.

       -<b>i</b> <u>interface</u>
              The  host  interface used to send frames.  The program default is "<b>eth1</b>" on Linux, "<b>en0</b>" on MacOSX
              or OpenBSD and "<b>2</b>" on Windows; however, if environment string "<b>PLC</b>" is defined, it supersedes  the
              program default.  Any  interface specified on the command line supersedes all others.

       -<b>p</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Pause  time  in  seconds between sending each frame.  Pauses may be necessary when the destination
              device is a UART-enabled powerline device because each frame must  be  converted  and  transmitted
              serially  from  the  remote  device  to  the remote host.  Permitted pause times are <b>0</b> through <b>255</b>
              seconds.  The default is <b>0</b>.

       -<b>q</b>     Quiet mode.  This option has no effect at this time.

       -<b>v</b>     Verbose mode.  This option displays outgoing frames on stdout in hexadecimal dump format  as  they
              are sent.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>file</u>   The name of a text or binary file accessible from the local host.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  example  sends  files  <b>abc.txt</b>  then <b>def.bin</b> to the remote Atheros UART-enabled powerline
       device <b>00:B0:52:BA:BE:55</b> over network interface <b>eth1</b>.  There is a constant 1 second  delay  between  each
       frame  sent  so that remote UART-enabled powerline devices have time to convert and forward each frame to
       their local host.

          # edsu -ieth1 -d 00:b0:52:BA:BE:55 abc.txt def.bin
