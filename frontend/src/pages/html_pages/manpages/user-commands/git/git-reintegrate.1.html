       git-reintegrate - Manage integration branches in Git

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git</u> <u>reintegrate</u> --create &lt;name&gt; [&lt;base&gt;]
       <u>git-reintegrate</u> --generate &lt;name&gt; [&lt;base&gt;]
       <u>git-reintegrate</u> --add=&lt;name&gt;
       <u>git-reintegrate</u> (--edit | --rebuild | --apply | --cat | --status) [&lt;name&gt;]
       <u>git</u> <u>reintegrate</u> (--continue | --abort)
       <u>git-reintegrate</u> --list

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This tool is a helper to be able to manage integration branches in Git easily. It does so by specifying a
       list of merges to be applied on top of a base branch. Each one of these merges can have a description
       that will be used as the merge commit message.

       This instruction sheet can be autogenerated and modified in various ways through the command line, or
       manually edited.

       Finally the integration branch can be rebuilt, and previous conflicts resolutions can be reused thanks to
       git rerere.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --create
           Create a new integration branch.

           If no base is specified, <u>master</u> is assumed.

       --generate
           Generates the instruction sheet based on an existing integration branch. The messages of each merge
           commit will be parsed to construct the instructions. The messages should be in the standard form
           Merge branch 'name' (or remote branch).

           If no base is specified, <u>master</u> is assumed.

       --[no-]rebuild
           Rebuild the integration branch.

       --edit
           Edit the instruction sheet.

       --cat
           Print the instruction sheet.

       --status
           Prints the status of the integration branch.

       --add=&lt;branch&gt;
           Appends a line merge &lt;branch&gt; to the instruction list, causing that branch to be included in the
           integration branch when it is next rebuilt. This option may be specified multiple times to add
           multiple branches.

       --continue
           Restart the rebuild process after having resolved a merge conflict.

       --abort
           Abort the rebuild operation.

       --[no-]autocontinue
           Continues automatically if the rerere mechanism manages to resolve all conflicts during a merge.

       --list
           List all the current integration branches.

       --delete
           Delete an integration branch. It doesn’t delete the branch itself, only the integration information.

       --apply
           Applies the instruction sheet of the integration branch on top of the current branch. If a branch to
           merge is already completely merged in the current branch, it’s skipped.

       If --continue or --abort are specified then no other options may be given.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       integration.autocontinue
           Sets the default for the --autocontinue option.

       integration.autorebuild
           Automatically rebuild the integration branch after creating/editing it if --no-rebuild is not
           specified.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b> <b>OF</b> <b>INSTRUCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The instruction sheet consists of a series of instructions which begin in column zero, each of which may
       be followed by indented comments. The following instructions are supported:

       base <u>&lt;ref&gt;</u>
           Resets the state of the integration branch to the specified revision. This should always be the first
           instruction in the instruction sheet, and should appear only at the top of the instruction sheet.

       merge <u>&lt;ref&gt;</u> <u>[&lt;options&gt;]</u>
           Merges the specified ref into the integration branch. Any comments following the instruction are
           appended to the merge commit’s commit message.

           If any options are given after the ref (and on the same line) then these are passed to <u>git</u> <u>merge</u>.
           This may be useful for specifying an alternative merge strategy for a branch.

       fixup <u>&lt;ref&gt;</u>
           Picks up an existing commit to be applied on top of a merge as a fixup.

       commit
           Adds an empty commit with the specified message mostly to be used as a comment.

       pause
           Pauses the rebuild process, so the user can do certain actions manually, for example fixing a wrong
           conflict resolution.

       . <u>&lt;args...&gt;</u>
           Ignores this command and its description. This can be used to remove a branch from the integration
           branch without needing to delete it and its description from the instruction sheet.

   <b>Example</b>
           base master

           merge my-experimental-feature

             I think this is a good idea, but want to dogfood it before I
             decide whether to submit it upstream.

           merge my-site-specific-changes

             Some changes to suit my environment.  DO NOT SUBMIT THESE.
