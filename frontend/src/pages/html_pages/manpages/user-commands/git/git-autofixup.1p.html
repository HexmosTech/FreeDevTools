</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       App::Git::Autofixup - create fixup commits for topic branches

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           git-autofixup [&lt;options&gt;] [&lt;revision&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git-autofixup</u> parses hunks of changes in the working directory out of "git diff" output and uses "git
       blame" to assign those hunks to commits in "&lt;revision&gt;..HEAD", which will typically represent a topic
       branch, and then creates fixup commits to be used with "git rebase --interactive --autosquash". It is
       assumed that hunks near changes that were previously committed to the topic branch are related.
       "&lt;revision&gt;" defaults to "git merge-base --fork-point HEAD @{upstream} || git merge-base HEAD
       @{upstream}", but this will only work if the current branch has an upstream/tracking branch. See "git
       help revisions" for info about how to specify revisions.

       If any changes have been staged to the index using "git add", then <u>git-autofixup</u> will only consider
       staged hunks when trying to create fixup commits. A temporary index is used to create any resulting
       commits.

       By default a hunk will be included in a fixup commit if all the lines in the hunk's context blamed on
       topic branch commits refer to the same commit, so there's no ambiguity about which commit the hunk
       corresponds to. If there is ambiguity the assignment behaviour used under "--strict 1" will be used to
       attempt to resolve it. If "--strict 1" is given the same topic branch commit must be blamed for every
       removed line and at least one of the lines adjacent to each added line, and added lines must not be
       adjacent to lines blamed on other topic branch commits. All the same restrictions apply when "--strict 2"
       is given, but each added line must be surrounded by lines blamed on the same topic branch commit.

       For example,  the added line in the hunk below is adjacent to lines committed by commits "99f370af" and
       "a1eadbe2". If these are both topic branch commits then it's ambiguous which commit the added line is
       fixing up and the hunk will be ignored.

           COMMIT  |LINE|HEAD                          |WORKING DIRECTORY
           99f370af|   1|first line                    | first line
                   |    |                              |+added line
           a1eadbe2|   2|second line                   | second line

       But if that second line were instead blamed on an upstream commit (denoted by "^"), the hunk would be
       added to a fixup commit for "99f370af":

           99f370af|   1|first line                    | first line
                   |    |                              |+added line
           ^       |   2|second line                   | second line

       Output similar to this example can be generated by setting verbosity to 2 or greater by using the
       verbosity option multiple times, eg. "git-autofixup -vv", and can be helpful in determining how a hunk
       will be handled.

       <u>git-autofixup</u> is not to be used mindlessly. Always inspect the created fixup commits to ensure hunks have
       been assigned correctly, especially when used on a working directory that has been changed with a mix of
       fixups and new work.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h  Show usage.

       --help
           Show manpage.

       --version
           Show version.

       -v, --verbose
           Increase verbosity. Can be used up to two times.

       -c N, --context N
           Change the number of context lines "git diff" uses around hunks. Default:  3.  This  can  change  how
           hunks are assigned to fixup commits, especially with "--strict 0".

       -s N, --strict N
           Set how strict <u>git-autofixup</u> is about assigning hunks to fixup commits. Default: 0. Strictness levels
           are described under DESCRIPTION.

       -g ARG, --gitopt ARG
           Specify  option  for  git. Can be used multiple times. Useful for testing, to override config options
           that break git-autofixup, or to override global diff options to tweak what git-autofixup considers  a
           hunk.  Deprecated  in  favor  of  "GIT_CONFIG_{COUNT,KEY,VALUE}" environment variables; see "git help
           config".

           Note ARG won't be wordsplit, so to give multiple arguments, such as for setting a config option  like
           "-c diff.algorithm", this option must be used multiple times: "-g -c -g diff.algorithm=patience".

       -e, --exit-code
           Use more detailed exit codes:

           0:  All hunks have been assigned.

           1:  Only some hunks have been assigned.

           2:  No hunks have been assigned.

           3:  There was nothing to be assigned.

           255:
               Unexpected error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       If  cpan is available, run "cpan -i App::Git::Autofixup". Otherwise, copy <u>git-autofixup</u> to a directory in
       "PATH" and ensure it has execute permissions. It can then be invoked as either  "git-autofixup"  or  "git
       autofixup", since git searches "PATH" for appropriately named binaries.

       Git  is  distributed  with Perl 5 for platforms not expected to already have it installed, but installing
       modules with cpan requires other tools that might not be available, such as  make.  This  script  has  no
       dependencies  outside of the standard library, so it is hoped that it works on any platform that Git does
       without much trouble.

       Requires a git supporting "commit --fixup": 1.7.4 or later.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS/LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       git-autofixup works on Windows, but be careful not to use a perl compiled for cygwin with a git  compiled
       for msys, such as Git for Windows &lt;https://gitforwindows.org/&gt;. It can be used from Git for Windows' "Git
       Bash"  or  "Git  CMD",  or  you can install git using Cygwin's package manager and use git-autofixup from
       Cygwin. Note that while every release gets tested on Cygwin via the CPAN Testers  network,  testing  with
       Git  for Windows requires more effort since it's a constrained environment; thus it doesn't get tested as
       often. If you run  into  any  issues,  please  report  them  on  GitHub  &lt;https://github.com/torbiak/git-
       autofixup/issues&gt;.

       If  a topic branch adds some lines in one commit and subsequently removes some of them in another, a hunk
       in the working directory that re-adds those lines will be assigned to fixup the first commit, and  during
       rebasing they'll be removed again by the later commit.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git-autofixup</u>   was   inspired   by   a  description  of  hg  absorb  &lt;https://bitbucket.org/facebook/hg-
       experimental/src/38d6e5d7f355f58330cd707059baac38d69a1210/hgext3rd/absorb/__init__.py&gt; in  the  Mercurial
       Sprint  Notes  &lt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.version-control/nh4fITFlEMk&gt;. While I
       was           working            on            it            I            found            git-superfixup
       &lt;https://gist.github.com/oktal3700/cafe086b49c89f814be4a7507a32a3f7&gt;,  by oktal3700, which was helpful to
       examine.
