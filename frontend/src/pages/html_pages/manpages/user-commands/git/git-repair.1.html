</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-repair - Fix a broken git repository

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       git-repair [--force]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This can fix a corrupt or broken git repository, which git fsck would only complain has problems.

       It  does by deleting all corrupt objects, and retrieving all missing objects that it can from the remotes
       of the repository.

       If that is not sufficient to fully recover the repository, it can also reset  branches  back  to  commits
       before  the  corruption  happened, delete branches that are no longer available due to the lost data, and
       remove any missing files from the index. It will only do this if run with the <b>--force</b> option, since  that
       rewrites  history  and throws out missing data.  Note that the <b>--force</b> option never touches tags, even if
       they are no longer usable due to missing data.

       After running this command, you will probably want to run <b>git</b> <b>fsck</b> to verify  it  fixed  the  repository.
       Note  that  fsck  may  still  complain about objects referenced by the reflog, or the stash, if they were
       unable to be recovered. This command does not try to clean up either the reflog or the stash.

       Since this command unpacks all packs in the repository, you may want to run <b>git</b> <b>gc</b> afterwards.

</pre><h4><b>TESTING</b></h4><pre>
       git-repair is able to test itself, by making a temporary copy of the git reposiory it's run in,  damaging
       it in random ways, and checking that it can repair it so that git fsck reports no problems.

       This is done using the --test parameter and associated --numtests and --retry parameters.

       Note  that  the  testing will sometimes find repositories that can only be repaired when --force is used;
       this is expected. On the other hand, if it fails to recover a repository with --force, then  the  testing
       has found a bug!
