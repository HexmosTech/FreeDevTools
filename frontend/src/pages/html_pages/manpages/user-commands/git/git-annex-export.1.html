</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-annex-export - export a tree of files to a special remote

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       git annex export <b>treeish</b> <b>--to</b> <b>remote</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Use this command to export a tree of files from a git-annex repository.

       Normally  files  are stored on a git-annex special remote named by their keys. That is great for reliable
       data storage, but your filenames are obscured. Exporting replicates the tree to the special remote as-is.

       To use this, you have to configure a special remote with <b>exporttree=yes</b> when initially setting it up with
       <a href="../man1/git-annex-initremote.1.html">git-annex-initremote</a>(1).

       The treeish to export can be the name of a git branch, or a tag, or any other treeish  accepted  by  git,
       including eg master:subdir to only export a subdirectory from a branch.

       When  the  remote  has a preferred content expression set by <a href="../man1/git-annex-wanted.1.html">git-annex-wanted</a>(1), the treeish is filtered
       through it, excluding annexed files it does not want from being exported to it. (Note that things in  the
       expression like "include=" match relative to the top of the treeish being exported.)

       Any files in the treeish that are stored on git will also be exported to the special remote.

       Repeated exports are done efficiently, by diffing the old and new tree, and transferring only the changed
       files, and renaming files as necessary.

       Exports  can  be  interrupted  and resumed. However, partially uploaded files will be re-started from the
       beginning in most cases.

       Once content has been exported to a remote, commands like <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>get</b> can download content  from  there
       the  same  as  from other remotes. However, since an export is not a key/value store, git-annex has to do
       more verification of content downloaded from an export. Some  types  of  keys,  that  are  not  based  on
       checksums,  cannot be downloaded from an export.  And, git-annex will never trust an export to retain the
       content of a key.

       However, some special remotes, notably S3, support keeping track of old versions of files stored in them.
       If a special remote is set up to do that, it can be used as a key/value store and the limitations in  the
       above  paragraph  do  not  apply.  Note  that  dropping  content from such a remote is not supported. See
       individual special remotes' documentation for details of how to enable such versioning.

       Commands like <b>git-annex</b> <b>push</b> can also be used to export a  branch  to  a  special  remote,  updating  the
       special   remote   whenever   the   branch   is   changed.    To   do   this,   you   need  to  configure
       "remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-tracking-branch" to tell it what branch to track. For example:

        git config remote.myremote.annex-tracking-branch master
        git annex push myremote

       You can combine using <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>export</b> to send changes to a special remote with <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>import</b> to fetch
       changes from a special remote.  When a file on a special remote has been modified by software other  than
       git-annex, exporting to it will not overwrite the modified file, and the export will not succeed. You can
       resolve this conflict by using <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>import</b>.

       (Some  types  of  special  remotes  such  as  S3  with versioning may instead let an export overwrite the
       modified file; then <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>import</b> will create a sequence of commits that includes the  modified  file,
       so the overwritten modification is not lost.)

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--to=remote</b>

              Specify the special remote to export to.

       <b>--from=remote</b>
              When  the  content  of  a  file  is  not available in the local repository, this option lets it be
              downloaded from another remote,  and  sent  on  to  the  destination  remote.  The  file  will  be
              temporarily stored on local disk, but will never enter the local repository.

              This option can be repeated multiple times.

              It is possible to use --from with the same remote as --to. If the tree contains several files with
              the  same content, and the remote being exported to already contains one copy of the content, this
              allows making a copy by downloading the content from it.

       <b>--tracking</b>
              This is a deprecated way to set  "remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-tracking-branch".   Instead  of  using  this
              option, you should just set the git configuration yourself.

       <b>--fast</b> This  sets  up  an  export of a tree, but avoids any expensive file uploads to the remote. You can
              later run <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>push</b> to upload the files to the export.

       <b>--jobs=N</b> <b>-JN</b>
              Exports multiple files in parallel. This may be faster.  For example: <b>-J4</b>

              Setting this to "cpus" will run one job per CPU core.

       <b>--json</b> Enable JSON output. This is intended to be parsed by programs that use  git-annex.  Each  line  of
              output is a JSON object.

       <b>--json-progress</b>
              Include progress objects in JSON output.

       <b>--json-error-messages</b>
              Messages that would normally be output to standard error are included in the JSON instead.

       Also the <a href="../man1/git-annex-common-options.1.html">git-annex-common-options</a>(1) can be used.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
        git annex initremote myremote type=directory directory=/mnt/myremote \
             exporttree=yes encryption=none
        git annex export master --to myremote

       After that, /mnt/myremote will contain the same tree of files as the master branch does.

        git mv myfile subdir/myfile
        git commit -m renamed
        git annex export master --to myremote

       That updates /mnt/myremote to reflect the renamed file.

        git annex export master:subdir --to myremote

       That updates /mnt/myremote, to contain only the files in the "subdir" directory of the master branch.

</pre><h4><b>EXPORT</b> <b>CONFLICTS</b></h4><pre>
       If  two  different  git-annex repositories are both exporting different trees to the same special remote,
       it's possible for an export conflict to occur.  This leaves the special remote with some files  from  one
       tree,  and  some files from the other. Files in the special remote may have entirely the wrong content as
       well.

       It's not possible for git-annex to detect when making an export will result in an  export  conflict.  The
       best  way  to  avoid  export  conflicts  is  to either only ever export to a special remote from a single
       repository, or to have a rule about the tree that you export to the special remote. For example,  if  you
       always export origin/master after pushing to origin, then an export conflict can't happen.

       An export conflict can only be detected after the two git repositories that produced it get back in sync.
       Then the next time you run git annex export, it will detect the export conflict, and resolve it.
