</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-annex-repair - recover broken git repository

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       git annex repair

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  can  repair  many  of the problems with git repositories that <b>git</b> <b>fsck</b> detects, but does not itself
       fix. It's useful if a repository has become badly damaged. One way this can happen  is  if  a  repository
       used by git-annex is on a removable drive that gets unplugged at the wrong time.

       This  command can actually be used inside git repositories that do not use git-annex at all; when used in
       a repository using git-annex, it does additional repairs of the git-annex branch.

       It works by deleting any corrupt objects from the git repository, and retrieving all missing  objects  it
       can from the remotes of the repository.

       If  that  is  not  sufficient to fully recover the repository, it can also reset branches back to commits
       before the corruption happened, delete branches that are no longer available due to the  lost  data,  and
       remove  any missing files from the index. It will only do this if run with the <b>--force</b> option, since that
       rewrites history and throws out missing data.  Note that the <b>--force</b> option never touches tags,  even  if
       they are no longer usable due to missing data.

       After  running  this  command,  you will probably want to run <b>git</b> <b>fsck</b> to verify it fixed the repository.
       Note that fsck may still complain about objects referenced by the reflog, or  the  stash,  if  they  were
       unable to be recovered. This command does not try to clean up either the reflog or the stash.

       It  is  also a good idea to run <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>fsck</b> <b>--fast</b> after this command, to make sure that the git-annex
       branch reflects reality.
