</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-annex - manage files with git, without checking their contents in

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       git annex command [params ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       git-annex  allows  managing  files  with git, without checking the file contents into git. While that may
       seem paradoxical, it is useful when dealing with files larger  than  git  can  currently  easily  handle,
       whether due to limitations in memory, checksumming time, or disk space.

       Even  without  file  content  tracking, being able to manage files with git, move files around and delete
       files with versioned directory trees, and use branches and distributed clones, are all very handy reasons
       to use git. And annexed files can co-exist in the same git repository  with  regularly  versioned  files,
       which  is convenient for maintaining documents, Makefiles, etc that are associated with annexed files but
       that benefit from full revision control.

       When a file is annexed, its content is moved into a key-value store, and a symlink is made that points to
       the content. These symlinks are checked into git and versioned like regular  files.  You  can  move  them
       around,  delete them, and so on. Pushing to another git repository will make git-annex there aware of the
       annexed file, and it can be used to retrieve its content from the key-value store.

       <b>metadata</b> <b>[path</b> <b>...]</b>

              The  content  of an annexed file can have any number of metadata fields attached to it to describe
              it. Each metadata field can in turn have any number of values.

              This command can be used to set metadata, or show the currently set metadata.

              See <a href="../man1/git-annex-metadata.1.html">git-annex-metadata</a>(1) for details.

       <b>resolvemerge</b>
              Resolves a conflicted merge, by adding both conflicting versions of the file to  the  tree,  using
              variants of their filename. This is done automatically when using <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>sync</b> or <b>git-annex</b> <b>pull</b>
              or <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>merge</b>.

              See <a href="../man1/git-annex-resolvemerge.1.html">git-annex-resolvemerge</a>(1) for details.

              See <a href="../man1/git-annex-diffdriver.1.html">git-annex-diffdriver</a>(1) for details.

       <b>smudge</b> This  command  lets  git-annex  be  used as a git filter driver, allowing annexed files in the git
              repository to be unlocked regular files instead of symlinks.

              See <a href="../man1/git-annex-smudge.1.html">git-annex-smudge</a>(1) for details.

       <b>filter-process</b>
              An alternative implementation of a git filter driver, that is faster in some situations and slower
              in others than <b>git-annex</b> <b>smudge</b>.

              See <a href="../man1/git-annex-filter-process.1.html">git-annex-filter-process</a>(1) for details.

       <b>restage</b>
              Restages unlocked files in the git index.

              See <a href="../man1/git-annex-restage.1.html">git-annex-restage</a>(1) for details.

</pre><h4><b>TESTING</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>test</b>

              This runs git-annex's built-in test suite.

              See <a href="../man1/git-annex-test.1.html">git-annex-test</a>(1) for details.

       <b>testremote</b> <b>remote</b>
              This tests a remote by generating some random  objects  and  sending  them  to  the  remote,  then
              redownloading them, removing them from the remote, etc.

              It's  safe to run in an existing repository (the repository contents are not altered), although it
              may perform expensive data transfers.

              See <a href="../man1/git-annex-testremote.1.html">git-annex-testremote</a>(1) for details.

       <b>sim</b>    This simulates a network of git-annex repositories. It can be used to test a configuration  before
              using it in the real world.

              See <a href="../man1/git-annex-sim.1.html">git-annex-sim</a>(1) for details.

       <b>fuzztest</b>
              Generates random changes to files in the current repository, for use in testing the assistant.

              See <a href="../man1/git-annex-fuzztest.1.html">git-annex-fuzztest</a>(1) for details.

       <b>benchmark</b>
              This runs git-annex's built-in benchmarks, if it was built with benchmarking support.

              See <a href="../man1/git-annex-benchmark.1.html">git-annex-benchmark</a>(1) for details.

</pre><h4><b>ADDON</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       In  addition  to  all  the  commands  listed  above,  more commands can be added to git-annex by dropping
       commands named like "git-annex-foo" into a directory in the PATH.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Like other git commands, git-annex is configured via <b>.git/config</b>.  These settings, as  well  as  relevant
       git config settings, are the ones git-annex uses.

       (Some of these settings can also be set, across all clones of the repository, using git-annex-config. See
       its man page for a list.)

       <b>annex.uuid</b>
              A unique UUID for this repository (automatically set).

       <b>annex.backend</b>
              Name  of  the  default  key-value backend to use when adding new files to the repository. See <a href="../man1/gitannex-backends.1.html">git-</a>
              <a href="../man1/gitannex-backends.1.html">annex-backends</a>(1) for information about available backends.

              This is overridden by annex annex.backend configuration in the .gitattributes files,  and  by  the
              --backend option.

              (This used to be named <b>annex.backends</b>, and that will still be used if set.)

       <b>annex.securehashesonly</b>
              Set to true to indicate that the repository should only use cryptographically secure hashes (SHA2,
              SHA3) and not insecure hashes (MD5, SHA1) for content.

              When  this  is  set,  the  contents  of  files using cryptographically insecure hashes will not be
              allowed to be added to the repository.

              Also, <b>git-annex</b> <b>fsck</b> will complain about any files present in the  repository  that  use  insecure
              hashes.  And, <b>git-annex</b> <b>import</b> <b>--no-content</b> will refuse to import files from special remotes using
              insecure hashes.

              To configure the behavior in new clones of the repository, this can be set using git-annex-config.

       <b>annex.maxextensionlength</b>
              Maximum length, in bytes, of what is considered a filename extension.  This is used when adding  a
              file to a backend that preserves filename extensions, and also when generating a view branch.

              The  default length is 4, which allows extensions like "jpeg". The dot before the extension is not
              counted part of its length.

       <b>annex.maxextensions</b>
              Maximum number of filename extensions to preserve when using a  backend  that  preserves  filename
              extensions, and also when generating a view branch.

              The  default  is  2,  which allows for compound extensions like ".tar.gz".  When set to 1, it will
              only preserve the last extension, eg ".gz".

       <b>annex.diskreserve</b>
              Amount of disk space to reserve. Disk space is checked when transferring annexed content to  avoid
              running  out,  and  additional free space can be reserved via this option, to make space for other
              data (such as git commit logs). Can be specified with any commonly used units, for  example,  "0.5
              gb", "500M", or "100 KiloBytes"

              The default reserve is 100 megabytes.

       <b>annex.fullybalancedthreshhold</b>
              Configures  the  percent  full  a  repository  must  be in order for the "fullybalanced" preferred
              content expression to consider it to be full. The default is 90.

       <b>annex.skipunknown</b>
              Set to true to make commands like "git-annex get" silently skip over items that are listed in  the
              command line, but are not checked into git.

              Set to false to make it an error for commands like "git-annex get" to be asked to operate on files
              that are not checked into git.  (This is the default in recent versions of git-annex.)

              Note that, when annex.skipunknown is false, a command like "git-annex get ." will fail if no files
              in the current directory are checked into git.  Commands like "git-annex get foo/" will fail if no
              files  in  the  directory  are checked into git, but if at least one file is, it will ignore other
              files that are not. This is all the same as the behavior of "git-ls files --error-unmatch".

              Also note that git-annex skips files that are checked into git, but are not  annexed  files;  this
              setting does not affect that.

       <b>annex.largefiles</b>
              Used to configure which files are large enough to be added to the annex.  It is an expression that
              matches    the    large    files,    eg    "<b>include=*.mp3</b>    <b>or</b>    <b>largerthan=500kb</b>"    See   <a href="../man1/gitannex-matching-expression.1.html">git-</a>
              <a href="../man1/gitannex-matching-expression.1.html">annex-matching-expression</a>(1) for details on the syntax.

              Overrides any annex.largefiles attributes in <b>.gitattributes</b> files.

              To configure a default annex.largefiles for all clones of the repository, this can be set in  <a href="../man1/gitannex-config.1.html">git-</a>
              <a href="../man1/gitannex-config.1.html">annex-config</a>(1).

              This  configures  the  behavior  of both git-annex and git when adding files to the repository. By
              default, <b>git-annex</b> <b>add</b> adds all files to the annex (except dotfiles and files in dotdirs), and <b>git</b>
              <b>add</b> adds files to git (unless they were added to the annex previously).  When annex.largefiles  is
              configured,  both  <b>git</b>  <b>annex</b>  <b>add</b> and <b>git</b> <b>add</b> will add matching large files to the annex, and the
              other files to git.

              Other git-annex commands also honor  annex.largefiles,  including  <b>git</b>  <b>annex</b>  <b>import</b>,  <b>git</b>  <b>annex</b>
              <b>addurl</b>, <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>importfeed</b>, <b>git-annex</b> <b>assist</b>, and the <b>git-annex</b> <b>assistant</b>.

       <b>annex.dotfiles</b>
              Normally, dotfiles and files inside dotdirs are assumed to be configuration files like .gitignore,
              whose content should always be part of the git repository, so they will not be added to the annex.
              Setting annex.dotfiles to true makes these files be added to the annex the same as any other file.

              To  annex  only some dotfiles, set this and configure annex.largefiles to match the ones you want.
              For example, to match only dotfiles ending in ".big"

               git  config  annex.largefiles  "(include=.*.big   or   include=*<a href="file:/.">/.</a>*.big)   or   (exclude=.*   and
              exclude=*<a href="file:/.">/.</a>*)"
               git config annex.dotfiles true

              To  configure  a  default annex.dotfiles for all clones of the repository, this can be set in <a href="../man1/gitannex-config.1.html">git-</a>
              <a href="../man1/gitannex-config.1.html">annex-config</a>(1).

       <b>annex.gitaddtoannex</b>
              Setting this to false  will  prevent  <b>git</b>  <b>add</b>  from  adding  files  to  the  annex,  despite  the
              annex.largefiles configuration.

       <b>annex.addsmallfiles</b>
              Controls  whether small files (files not matching annex.largefiles, or dotfiles) should be checked
              into git by <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>add</b>. Defaults to true; set to false to instead make small files be skipped.

       <b>annex.addunlocked</b>
              Commands like <b>git-annex</b> <b>add</b> default to adding files to the repository in  locked  form.  This  can
              make  them  add  the  files  in  unlocked form, the same as if <a href="../man1/git-annex-unlock.1.html">git-annex-unlock</a>(1) were run on the
              files.

              This can be set to "true" to add everything unlocked, or it can be a more  complicated  expression
              that matches files by name, size, or content. See <a href="../man1/git-annex-matching-expression.1.html">git-annex-matching-expression</a>(1) for details.

              To configure a default annex.addunlocked for all clones of the repository, this can be set in <a href="../man1/gitannex-config.1.html">git-</a>
              <a href="../man1/gitannex-config.1.html">annex-config</a>(1).

              (Using <b>git</b> <b>add</b> always adds files in unlocked form and it is not affected by this setting.)

              When  a repository has core.symlinks set to false, or has an adjusted unlocked branch checked out,
              this setting is ignored, and files are always added to the repository in unlocked form.

       <b>annex.numcopies</b>
              This is a deprecated setting. You should instead use the <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>numcopies</b> command to  configure
              how  many  copies of files are kept across all repositories, or the annex.numcopies .gitattributes
              setting.

              This config setting is only looked at when <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>numcopies</b> has never been configured, and when
              there's no annex.numcopies setting in the .gitattributes file.

       <b>annex.genmetadata</b>
              Set this to <b>true</b> to make git-annex automatically generate some metadata when adding files  to  the
              repository.

              In particular, it stores year, month, and day metadata, from the file's modification date.

              When  importfeed  is used, it stores additional metadata from the feed, such as the author, title,
              etc.

       <b>annex.used-refspec</b>
              This controls which refs <b>git-annex</b> <b>unused</b> considers to  be  used.   See  REFSPEC  FORMAT  in  <a href="../man1/gitannex-unused.1.html">git-</a>
              <a href="../man1/gitannex-unused.1.html">annex-unused</a>(1) for details.

       <b>annex.jobs</b>
              Configure the number of concurrent jobs to run. Default is 1.

              Only git-annex commands that support the --jobs option will use this.

              Setting this to "cpus" will run one job per CPU core.

              When the <b>--batch</b> option is used, this configuration is ignored.

       <b>annex.adjustedbranchrefresh</b>
              When  <a href="../man1/git-annex-adjust.1.html">git-annex-adjust</a>(1)  is  used  to set up an adjusted branch that needs to be refreshed after
              getting or dropping files, this config controls how frequently the branch is refreshed.

              Refreshing the branch takes some time, so doing it after every file can be too slow. (It also  can
              generate  a  lot  of  dangling  git  objects.)   The default value is 0 (or false), which does not
              refresh the branch. Setting 1 (or true) will refresh only once, after  git-annex  has  made  other
              changes.  Setting  2  refreshes after every file, 3 after every other file, and so on; setting 100
              refreshes after every 99 files.

              (If git-annex gets faster in the future, refresh rates will increase  proportional  to  the  speed
              improvements.)

       <b>annex.queuesize</b>
              git-annex  builds  a  queue  of  git  commands, in order to combine similar commands for speed. By
              default the size of the queue is limited to 10240 commands; this can be used to change  the  size.
              If  you  have  plenty  of  memory and are working with very large numbers of files, increasing the
              queue size can speed it up.

       <b>annex.bloomcapacity</b>
              The <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>unused</b> and <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>sync</b> <b>--content</b> commands use a bloom filter  to  determine  what
              files  are present in eg, the work tree.  The default bloom filter is sized to handle up to 500000
              files. If your repository is larger than that, you should increase this value. Larger values  will
              make  <b>git-annex</b>  <b>unused</b>  and  <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>sync</b> <b>--content</b> consume more memory; run <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>info</b> for
              memory usage numbers.

       <b>annex.bloomaccuracy</b>
              Adjusts the accuracy of the bloom filter used by <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>unused</b> and <b>git</b>  <b>annex</b>  <b>sync</b>  <b>--content</b>.
              The  default  accuracy  is  10000000  -- 1 unused file out of 10000000 will be missed by <b>git</b> <b>annex</b>
              <b>unused</b>. Increasing the accuracy will make <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>unused</b> consume more memory; run <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>info</b>
              for memory usage numbers.

       <b>annex.sshcaching</b>
              By default, git-annex caches ssh connections using ssh's ControlMaster and ControlPersist settings
              (if built using a new enough ssh). To disable this, set to <b>false</b>.

       <b>annex.adviceNoSshCaching</b>
              When git-annex is unable to use ssh connection  caching,  or  has  been  configured  not  to,  and
              concurrency  is  enabled,  it will warn that this might result in multiple ssh processes prompting
              for passwords at the same time. To disable that warning, eg if you have configured ssh  connection
              caching yourself, or have ssh agent caching passwords, set this to <b>false</b>.

       <b>annex.alwayscommit</b>
              By  default,  git-annex  automatically  commits data to the git-annex branch after each command is
              run. If you have a series of commands that you want to make a  single  commit,  you  can  run  the
              commands  with  <b>-c</b>  <b>annex.alwayscommit=false</b>.  You  can later commit the data by running <b>git</b> <b>annex</b>
              <b>merge</b> (or by automatic merges) or <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>sync</b>.

       <b>annex.commitmessage</b>
              When git-annex updates the git-annex branch, it usually  makes  up  its  own  commit  message  (eg
              "update"),  since  users  rarely look at or care about changes to that branch. If you do care, you
              can specify this setting by running commands with <b>-c</b> <b>annex.commitmessage=whatever</b>

              This works well in combination with annex.alwayscommit=false, to gather up a set  of  changes  and
              commit them with a message you specify.

       <b>annex.commitmessage-command</b>
              This command is run and its output is used as the commit message to the git-annex branch.

       <b>annex.alwayscompact</b>
              By  default,  git-annex  compacts  data it records in the git-annex branch.  Setting this to false
              avoids doing that compaction in some cases, which can speed up operations that populate  the  git-
              annex  branch  with a lot of data. However, when used with operations that overwrite old values in
              the git-annex branch, that may cause the git-annex branch to use more disk space, and so slow down
              reading data from it.

              An example of a command that can be sped up by using  <b>-c</b>  <b>annex.alwayscompact=false</b>  is  <b>git-annex</b>
              <b>registerurl</b> <b>--batch</b>, when adding a large number of urls to the same key.

              This  option was first supported by git-annex version 10.20220724.  It is not entirely safe to set
              this option in a repository that may also be used by an older version of  git-annex  at  the  same
              time as a version that supports this option.

       <b>annex.allowsign</b>
              By  default  git-annex  avoids gpg signing commits that it makes when they're not the purpose of a
              command, but only a  side  effect.   That  default  avoids  lots  of  gpg  password  prompts  when
              commit.gpgSign  is set. A command like <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>sync</b> or <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>merge</b> will gpg sign its commit,
              but a command like <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>get</b>, that updates the git-annex branch, will not. The assistant  also
              avoids signing commits.

              Setting  annex.allowsign  to  true lets all commits be signed, as controlled by commit.gpgSign and
              other git configuration.

       <b>annex.merge-annex-branches</b>
              By default, git-annex branches that have been pulled from remotes are  automatically  merged  into
              the local git-annex branch, so that git-annex has the most up-to-date possible knowledge.

              To avoid that merging, set this to "false".

              This can be useful particularly when you don't have write permission to the repository. While git-
              annex  is  mostly  able  to  work in a read-only repository with unmerged git-annex branches, some
              things do not work, and when it does work it will be slower due to needing to look at each of  the
              unmerged branches.

       <b>annex.private</b>
              When  this  is  set to true, no information about the repository will be recorded in the git-annex
              branch.

              For example, to make a repository without any mention  of  it  ever  appearing  in  the  git-annex
              branch:

               git init myprivate
               cd myprivaterepo
               git config annex.private true
               git annex init

       <b>annex.hardlink</b>
              Set  this to <b>true</b> to make file contents be hard linked between the repository and its remotes when
              possible, instead of a more expensive copy.

              Use with caution -- This can invalidate numcopies counting, since with hard links, fewer copies of
              a file can exist. So, it is a good idea to mark a repository using this setting as untrusted.

              When a repository is set up using <b>git</b>  <b>clone</b>  <b>--shared</b>,  git-annex  init  will  automatically  set
              annex.hardlink and mark the repository as untrusted.

              When <b>annex.thin</b> is also set, setting <b>annex.hardlink</b> has no effect.

       <b>annex.thin</b>
              Set  this to <b>true</b> to make unlocked files be a hard link to their content in the annex, rather than
              a second copy. This can save considerable disk space, but when a modification is made to  a  file,
              you  will  lose  the local (and possibly only) copy of the old version. Any other, locked files in
              the repository that pointed to that content will get broken as well (<b>git-annex</b>  <b>fsck</b>  will  detect
              and clean up after that).  So, enable this with care.

              After setting (or unsetting) this, you should run <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>fix</b> to fix up the annexed files in the
              work tree to be hard links (or copies).

              Note  that  this has no effect when the filesystem does not support hard links.  And when multiple
              files in the work tree have the same content, only one of them gets hard linked to the annex.

       <b>annex.supportunlocked</b>
              By default git-annex supports unlocked files as well as locked files, so this defaults to true. If
              set to false, git-annex will only support locked files. That will avoid doing the work  needed  to
              support unlocked files.

              Note  that setting this to false does not prevent a repository from having unlocked files added to
              it, and in that case the content of the files will not be accessible until they are locked.

              After changing this config, you need to re-run <b>git-annex</b> <b>init</b> for it to take effect.

       <b>annex.url</b>
              When a remote has a http url, the first time git-annex uses the remote it will  check  if  it  can
              download  its  <b>.git/config</b>  file.  If  it  is  able  to,  and  the  file has this config set to an
              "annex+http" or "annex+https" url, that url will be copied into <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annexUrl</b>.

       <b>annex.resolvemerge</b>
              Set to false to prevent merge conflicts in the checked out branch being automatically resolved  by
              the <b>git-annex</b> <b>assitant</b>, <b>git-annex</b> <b>assist</b>, <b>git-annex</b> <b>sync</b>, <b>git-annex</b> <b>pull</b>, <b>git-annex</b> <b>merge</b>, and the
              git-annex post-receive hook.

              To configure the behavior in all clones of the repository, this can be set in <a href="../man1/git-annex-config.1.html">git-annex-config</a>(1).

       <b>annex.synccontent</b>
              Set to true to make <b>git-annex</b> <b>sync</b> default to transferring annexed content.

              Set  to  false  to  prevent  <b>git-annex</b> <b>assist</b>, <b>git-annex</b> <b>pull</b> and <b>git-annex</b> <b>push</b> from transferring
              annexed content.

              To configure the behavior in all clones of the repository, this can be set in <a href="../man1/git-annex-config.1.html">git-annex-config</a>(1).

       <b>annex.synconlyannex</b>
              Set to true to make <b>git-annex</b> <b>assist</b>, <b>git-annex</b> <b>sync</b>, <b>git-annex</b> <b>pull</b>, and <b>git-annex</b>  <b>push</b>  default
              to only operating on the git-annex branch and annexed content.

              To configure the behavior in all clones of the repository, this can be set in <a href="../man1/git-annex-config.1.html">git-annex-config</a>(1).

       <b>annex.syncmigrations</b>
              Set  to  false  to  prevent  <b>git-annex</b>  <b>sync</b>  and  <b>git-annex</b> <b>pull</b> from scanning for migrations and
              updating the local repository for those migrations.

       <b>annex.viewunsetdirectory</b>
              This configures the name of a directory that is used in a view to contain files that do  not  have
              metadata set. The default name for the directory is <b>"_"</b>. See <a href="../man1/git-annex-view.1.html">git-annex-view</a>(1) for details.

       <b>annex.debug</b>
              Set to true to enable debug logging by default.

       <b>annex.debugfilter</b>
              Set  to  configure which debug messages to display (when debug message display has been enabled by
              annex.debug or --debug). The value is one or more module names, separated by commas.

       <b>annex.version</b>
              The current version of the git-annex repository. This is maintained by git-annex and should  never
              be manually changed.

       <b>annex.autoupgraderepository</b>
              When  an  old  git-annex  repository  version  is  no  longer  supported,  git-annex will normally
              automatically upgrade the repository to the new version. It may also sometimes upgrade from an old
              repository version that is still supported but that is not as good as a later version.

              If this is set to false, git-annex won't automatically upgrade the repository. If  the  repository
              version  is  not  supported,  git-annex  will  instead  exit with an error message. If it is still
              supported, git-annex will continue to work.

              You can run <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>upgrade</b> yourself when you are ready to upgrade the repository.

       <b>annex.crippledfilesystem</b>
              Set to true if the repository is on a crippled filesystem, such as FAT,  which  does  not  support
              symbolic  links,  or  hard links, or unix permissions.  This is automatically probed by "git annex
              init".

       <b>annex.pidlock</b>
              Normally, git-annex uses fine-grained lock files to allow multiple processes to  run  concurrently
              without  getting  in  each  others'  way.   That  works great, unless you are using git-annex on a
              filesystem that does not support POSIX fcntl locks. This is sometimes the case when using  NFS  or
              Lustre filesystems.

              To  support  such situations, you can set annex.pidlock to true, and it will fall back to a single
              top-level pid file lock.

              Although, often, you'd really be better off fixing  your  networked  filesystem  configuration  to
              support  POSIX  locks..  And,  some  networked filesystems are so inconsistent that one node can't
              reliably tell when the other node is holding a pid lock. Caveat emptor.

       <b>annex.pidlocktimeout</b>
              git-annex will wait up to this many seconds for the pid lock file to go away, and will then  abort
              if it cannot continue. Default: 300

              When  using pid lock files, it's possible for a stale lock file to get left behind by previous run
              of git-annex that crashed or was interrupted.  This is mostly avoided, but  can  occur  especially
              when  using  a  network  file  system.  This  timeout prevents git-annex waiting forever in such a
              situation.

       <b>annex.dbdir</b>
              The directory where git-annex should store its sqlite databases.  The default location  is  inside
              <b>.git/annex/</b>.

              Certian  filesystems,  such  as  cifs,  may  not support locking operations that sqlite needs, and
              setting this to a directory on another filesystem can work around such a problem.

              This can safely be set to the same directory in the configuration of multiple  repositories;  each
              repository will use a subdirectory for its sqlite database.

       <b>annex.cachecreds</b>
              When  "true"  (the  default),  git-annex  will cache credentials used to access special remotes in
              files in .git/annex/creds/ that only you can read. To disable that caching, set  to  "false",  and
              credentials  will  only  be  read from the environment, or if they have been embedded in encrypted
              form in the git repository, will be extracted and decrypted each time git-annex  needs  to  access
              the remote.

       <b>annex.secure-erase-command</b>
              This  can  be set to a command that should be run whenever git-annex removes the content of a file
              from the repository.

              In the command line, %file is replaced with the file that should be erased.

              For example, to use the wipe command, set it to <b>wipe</b> <b>-f</b> <b>%file</b>.

       <b>annex.freezecontent-command</b>, <b>annex.thawcontent-command</b>
              Usually the write permission bits are unset to protect annexed  objects  from  being  modified  or
              deleted. The freezecontent-command is run after git-annex has removed (or attempted to remove) the
              write  bit,  and can be used to prevent writing in some other way.  The thawcontent-command should
              undo its effect, and is run before git-annex restores the write bit.

              In the command line, %path is replaced with the file or directory to operate on.

              (When annex.crippledfilesystem is set, git-annex will not try to remove/restore the write bit, but
              it will still run these hooks.)

       <b>annex.tune.objecthash1</b>, <b>annex.tune.objecthashlower</b>, <b>annex.tune.branchhash1</b>
              These can be passed to <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>init</b> to tune the repository.  They cannot be safely changed in  a
              running  repository  and  should  never  be  set  in  global  git configuration.  For details, see
              &lt;https://git-annex.branchable.com/tuning/&gt;.

       <b>annex.cluster.&lt;name&gt;</b>
              This is set to make the repository be a gateway to a cluster.  The value is the cluster UUID. Note
              that cluster UUIDs are not the same as repository UUIDs, and a  repository  UUID  cannot  be  used
              here.

              Usually this is set up by running git-annex-initcluster or git-annex-extendcluster.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>REMOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Remotes are configured using these settings in <b>.git/config</b>.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-cost</b>
              When  determining which repository to transfer annexed files from or to, ones with lower costs are
              preferred.  The default cost is 100 for local repositories, and 200 for remote repositories.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-cost-command</b>
              If set, the command is run, and the number it outputs is used as the cost.   This  allows  varying
              the cost based on e.g., the current network.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-start-command</b>
              A  command to run when git-annex begins to use the remote. This can be used to, for example, mount
              the directory containing the remote.

              The command may be run repeatedly when multiple git-annex processes are running concurrently.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-stop-command</b>
              A command to run when git-annex is done using the remote.

              The command will only be run once *all* running git-annex processes are finished using the remote.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-shell</b>
              Specify an alternative git-annex-shell executable on the  remote  instead  of  looking  for  "git-
              annex-shell" on the PATH.

              This is useful if the git-annex-shell program is outside the PATH or has a non-standard name.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-ignore</b>
              If set to <b>true</b>, prevents git-annex from storing or retrieving annexed file contents on this remote
              by default.  (You can still request it be used with the <b>--from</b> and <b>--to</b> options.)

              This  is,  for  example,  useful  if the remote is located somewhere without git-annex-shell. (For
              example, if it's on GitHub).  Or,  it  could  be  used  if  the  network  connection  between  two
              repositories is too slow to be used normally.

              This does not prevent <b>git-annex</b> <b>sync</b>, <b>git-annex</b> <b>pull</b>, <b>git-annex</b> <b>push</b>, <b>git-annex</b> <b>assist</b> or the <b>git-</b>
              <b>annex</b> <b>assistant</b> from operating on the git repository. It only affects annexed content.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-ignore-command</b>
              If  set,  the  command is run, and if it exits nonzero, that's the same as setting annex-ignore to
              true. This allows controlling behavior based on e.g., the current network.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-sync</b>
              If set to <b>false</b>, prevents <b>git-annex</b> <b>sync</b> (and <b>git-annex</b> <b>pull</b>, <b>git-annex</b>  <b>push</b>,  <b>git-annex</b>  <b>assist</b>,
              and the <b>git-annex</b> <b>assistant</b>) from operating on this remote by default.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-sync-command</b>
              If  set,  the  command  is  run, and if it exits nonzero, that's the same as setting annex-sync to
              false. This allows controlling behavior based on e.g., the current network.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-pull</b>
              If set to <b>false</b>, prevents <b>git-annex</b> <b>pull</b>, <b>git-annex</b>  <b>sync</b>,  <b>git-annex</b>  <b>assist</b>  and  the  <b>git-annex</b>
              <b>assistant</b> from ever pulling (or fetching) from the remote.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-push</b>
              If  set  to  <b>false</b>,  prevents  <b>git-annex</b>  <b>push</b>, <b>git-annex</b> <b>sync</b>, <b>git-annex</b> <b>assist</b> and the <b>git-annex</b>
              <b>assistant</b> from ever pushing to the remote.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-readonly</b>
              If set to <b>true</b>, prevents git-annex from making changes to a remote.  This prevents <b>git-annex</b>  <b>sync</b>
              and <b>git-annex</b> <b>assist</b> from pushing changes to a git repository. And it prevents storing or removing
              files from read-only remote.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-verify</b>, <b>annex.verify</b>
              By default, git-annex will verify the checksums of objects downloaded from remotes. If you trust a
              remote and don't want the overhead of these checksums, you can set this to <b>false</b>.

              Note  that  even  when this is set to <b>false</b>, git-annex does verification in some edge cases, where
              it's likely the case than an object was downloaded incorrectly, or when needed for security.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-tracking-branch</b>
              This is for use with special remotes that support exports and imports.

              When set to eg, "master", this tells git-annex that you want the  special  remote  to  track  that
              branch.

              When set to eg, "master:subdir", the special remote tracks only the subdirectory of that branch.

              Setting  this  enables some other commands to work with these special remotes: <b>git-annex</b> <b>pull</b> will
              import changes from the remote and merge them into the annex-tracking-branch. And  <b>git-annex</b>  <b>push</b>
              will  export  changes  to the remote. Higher-level commands <b>git-annex</b> <b>sync</b> <b>--content</b> and <b>git-annex</b>
              <b>assist</b> both import and export.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-export-tracking</b>
              Deprecated name for <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-tracking-branch</b>. Will still be used if it's configured and
              <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-tracking-branch</b> is not.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annexUrl</b>
              Can be used to specify a different url than the regular <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.url</b> for git-annex to use for
              accessing the remote. Similar to the <b>pushUrl</b> used by git-push.

              When this is set to an annex+http or annex+https url, that url is used  for  git-annex  operations
              only, and the <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.url</b> is used for git operations. This allows using git-annex-p2phttp to
              serve a git-annex repository over http.

              When  this  and the <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.url</b> contain the same hostname, and this is an annex+http(s) url,
              and that is also a http(s) url, git-annex assumes that the same username and password can be  used
              for  both urls. When password cacheing is configured, this allows you to only be prompted once for
              a password when using both git and git-annex. See <a href="../man7/gitcredentials.7.html">gitcredentials</a>(7) for how  to  set  up  password
              caching.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-uuid</b>
              git-annex caches UUIDs of remote repositories here.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-config-uuid</b>
              Used for some special remotes, points to a different special remote configuration to use.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-retry</b>, <b>annex.retry</b>
              Number of times a transfer that fails can be retried. (default 0)

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-forward-retry</b>, <b>annex.forward-retry</b>
              If  a  transfer  made some forward progress before failing, this allows it to be retried even when
              <b>annex.retry</b> does not.  The value is the maximum number of times to do that. (default 5)

              When both <b>annex.retry</b> and this are set, the maximum number of retries is the larger of the two.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-retry-delay</b>, <b>annex.retry-delay</b>
              Number of seconds to delay before the first retry of a transfer.  When making multiple retries  of
              the same transfer, the delay doubles after each retry. (default 1)

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-bwlimit</b>, <b>annex.bwlimit</b>
              This can be used to limit how much bandwidth is used for a transfer from or to a remote.

              For example, to limit transfers to 1 mebibyte per second: <b>git</b> <b>config</b> <b>annex.bwlimit</b> <b>"1MiB"</b>

              This will work with many remotes, including git remotes, but not for remotes where the transfer is
              run by a separate program than git-annex.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-bwlimit-download</b>, <b>annex.bwlimit-download</b>
              Limit bandwith for downloads from a remote.

              Overrides <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-bwlimit</b> and <b>annex.bwlimit</b>

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-bwlimit-upload</b>, <b>annex.bwlimit-upload</b>
              Limit bandwith for uploads to a remote.

              Overrides <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-bwlimit</b> and <b>annex.bwlimit</b>

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-stalldetection</b>, <b>annex.stalldetection</b>
              Configuring  this  lets  stalled or too-slow transfers be detected, and dealt with, so rather than
              getting stuck, git-annex will cancel the stalled operation. The transfer  will  be  considered  to
              have failed, so settings like annex.retry will control what it does next.

              The  default  is  to  automatically  detect when transfers that have probably stalled, and suggest
              configuring this, but not cancel the stalled operations. For this  to  work,  a  remote  needs  to
              update  its  progress  consistently.  Remotes  that do not will not have automatic stall detection
              done. And it may take a while for git-annex to decide  a  remote  is  really  stalled  when  using
              automatic stall detection, since it needs to be conservative about what looks like a stall.

              Set to "false" to avoid all attempts at stall detection.

              To  detect  and  cancel  stalled  transfers, set this to a value in the form "$amount/$timeperiod"
              which specifies how much data git-annex should expect to see flowing, minimum, over a given period
              of time.

              For example, to detect outright stalls where no data has been transferred after  30  seconds:  <b>git</b>
              <b>config</b> <b>annex.stalldetection</b> <b>"1KB/30s"</b>

              Or,  if you have a remote on a USB drive that is normally capable of several megabytes per second,
              but  has  bad  sectors  where  it  gets  stuck  for  a  long  time,  you  could  use:  <b>git</b>  <b>config</b>
              <b>remote.usbdrive.annex-stalldetection</b> <b>"1MB/1m"</b>

              Some remotes don't report transfer progress, and stalls cannot be detected when using those.

              Some  remotes  only  report  transfer  progress  occasionally, eg after each chunk. To avoid false
              timeouts in such a situation, if the first  progress  update  takes  longer  to  arrive  than  the
              configured  time  period,  the  stall  detection will be automically adjusted to use a longer time
              period. For example, if the first progress update comes after 10 minutes, but annex.stalldetection
              is "1MB/1m", it will be treated as eg "30MB/30m".

              Configuring stall detection can make git-annex use more resources. To be able  to  cancel  stalls,
              git-annex  has  to run transfers in separate processes (one per concurrent job). So it may need to
              open more connections to a remote than usual, or the communication with those processes  may  make
              it a bit slower.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-stalldetection-download</b>, <b>annex.stalldetection-download</b>
              Stall detection for downloads from a remote.

              For  example,  if  a remote is often fast, but sometimes is very slow, and there is another remote
              that is consistently medium speed and that contains the same data, this could be set to treat  the
              fast  remote  as  stalled  when  it's  slow.  Then  a command like <b>git-annex</b> <b>get</b> will fall back to
              downloading from the medium speed remote.

              Overrides <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-stalldetection</b>, <b>annex.stalldetection</b>

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-stalldetection-upload</b>, <b>annex.stalldetection-upload</b>
              Stall detection for uploads to a remote.

              Overrides <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-stalldetection</b>, <b>annex.stalldetection</b>

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-checkuuid</b>
              This only affects remotes that have their url pointing to a directory on  the  same  system.  git-
              annex  normally  checks  the  uuid of such remotes each time it's run, which lets it transparently
              deal with different drives being mounted to the location at different times.

              Setting annex-checkuuid to false will prevent it from checking the uuid at startup  (although  the
              uuid  is still verified before making any changes to the remote repository). This may be useful to
              set to prevent unnecessary spin-up or automounting of a drive.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-trustlevel</b>
              Configures a local trust level for the remote. This overrides the value configured  by  the  trust
              and untrust commands. The value can be any of "trusted", "semitrusted" or "untrusted".

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-speculate-present</b>
              Set  to  "true"  to make git-annex speculate that this remote may contain the content of any file,
              even though its normal location tracking does not indicate that it does. This will cause git-annex
              to try to get all file contents from the remote. Can be useful in setting up a caching remote.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-proxy</b>

              Set to "true" to make the local repository able to act as a proxy to this remote. The  remote  can
              be a git-annex repository or a special remote.

              After configuring this, run [[git-annex-updateproxy](1) to store the new configuration in the git-
              annex branch.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-proxied-by</b>
              Usually  this  is used internally, when git-annex sets up proxied remotes, and will not need to be
              configured. The value is the UUID of the git-annex repository that proxies access to this remote.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-cluster-node</b>
              Set to the name of a cluster to make this remote  be  part  of  the  cluster.  Names  of  multiple
              clusters can be separated by whitespace to make a remote be part of more than one cluster.

              After  configuring  this,  run [[git-annex-updatecluster](1) to store the new configuration in the
              git-annex branch.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-cluster-gateway</b>
              Set to the UUID of a cluster that this remote serves as a gateway  for.   Multiple  UUIDs  can  be
              listed,  separated by whitespace. When the local repository is also a gateway for that cluster, it
              will proxy for the nodes of the remote gateway.

              Usually this is set up by running git-annex-extendcluster.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-private</b>
              When this is set to true, no information about the  remote  will  be  recorded  in  the  git-annex
              branch.  This  is mostly useful for special remotes, and is set when using <a href="../man1/git-annex-initremote.1.html">git-annex-initremote</a>(1)
              with the <b>--private</b> option.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-max-git-bundles</b>, <b>annex.max-git-bundles</b>
              When using git-remote-annex to store a git repository in a special  remote,  this  configures  how
              many  separate  git bundle objects to store in the special remote before re-uploading a single git
              bundle that contains the entire git repository.

              The default is 100, which aims to avoid often needing to often re-upload, while preventing a clone
              or fetch needing to download too many objects.  Set to 0 to disable re-uploading.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-allow-encrypted-gitrepo</b>
              Setting this to true allows using git-remote-annex to push the  git  repository  to  an  encrypted
              special remote.

              That  is  not  allowed by default, because it is impossible to git clone from an encrypted special
              remote, since it needs encryption keys stored in the remote. So take care that, if you  set  this,
              you don't rely on the encrypted special remote being the only copy of your git repository.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-bare</b>
              Can  be  used  to  tell  git-annex  if  a  remote is a bare repository or not. Normally, git-annex
              determines this automatically.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-availability</b>
              This configuration setting is no longer used.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-ssh-options</b>
              Options to use when using ssh to talk to this remote.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-rsync-options</b>
              Options to use when using rsync to or from this remote. For example, to force IPv6, and limit  the
              bandwidth to 100Kbyte/s, set it to <b>-6</b> <b>--bwlimit</b> <b>100</b>

              Note  that  git-annex-shell  has  a  whitelist of allowed rsync options, and others will not be be
              passed to the remote rsync. So using some options may break the communication  between  the  local
              and remote rsyncs.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-rsync-upload-options</b>
              Options to use when using rsync to upload a file to a remote.

              These  options  are  passed after other applicable rsync options, so can be used to override them.
              For example, to limit upload bandwidth to 10Kbyte/s, set <b>--bwlimit</b> <b>10</b>.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-rsync-download-options</b>
              Options to use when using rsync to download a file from a remote.

              These options are passed after other applicable rsync options, so can be used to override them.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-rsync-transport</b>
              The remote shell to use to connect to the rsync remote. Possible values are <b>ssh</b> (the default)  and
              <b>rsh</b>,  together  with  their  arguments, for instance <b>ssh</b> <b>-p</b> <b>2222</b> <b>-c</b> <b>blowfish</b>; Note that the remote
              hostname should not appear there, see <a href="../man1/rsync.1.html">rsync</a>(1) for details.   When  the  transport  used  is  <b>ssh</b>,
              connections are automatically cached unless <b>annex.sshcaching</b> is unset.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-bup-split-options</b>
              Options  to  pass  to  bup  split  when storing content in this remote.  For example, to limit the
              bandwidth to 100Kbyte/s, set it to <b>--bwlimit</b> <b>100k</b> (There is no corresponding option for bup join.)

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-gnupg-options</b>
              Options to pass to GnuPG when it's encrypting data. For instance, to use the AES cipher with a 256
              bits key and disable compression, set it to  <b>--cipher-algo</b>  <b>AES256</b>  <b>--compress-algo</b>  <b>none</b>.  (These
              options take precedence over the default GnuPG configuration, which is otherwise used.)

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-gnupg-decrypt-options</b>
              Options  to  pass  to  GnuPG  when  it's  decrypting data. (These options take precedence over the
              default GnuPG configuration, which is otherwise used.)

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-shared-sop-command</b>
              Use this command, which is an implementation of the  Stateless  OpenPGP  command  line  interface,
              rather  than  GnuPG for encrypting and decrypting data. This is only used when a special remote is
              configured with encryption=shared.

              For example, to use Sequoia PGP's sqop command, set this to "sqop".

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-shared-sop-profile</b>
              When encrypting with a Stateless OpenPGP command, this can be used to specify the profile to  use,
              such as "rfc4880".

              For a list of available profiles, run eg "sqop list-profiles encrypt"

              sqop list-profiles encrypt

       <b>annex.ssh-options</b>, <b>annex.rsync-options</b>,
              <b>annex.rsync-upload-options</b>,         <b>annex.rsync-download-options</b>,         <b>annex.bup-split-options</b>,
              <b>annex.gnupg-options</b>,            <b>annex.gnupg-decrypt-options</b>,             <b>annex.shared-sop-command</b>,
              <b>annex.shared-sop-profile</b>

              Default options to use if a remote does not have more specific options as described above.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-rsyncurl</b>
              Used  by  rsync  special  remotes,  this  configures  the location of the rsync repository to use.
              Normally this is automatically set up by <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>initremote</b>, but you can change it if needed.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-buprepo</b>
              Used by bup special remotes, this configures the location of the bup repository to  use.  Normally
              this is automatically set up by <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>initremote</b>, but you can change it if needed.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-borgrepo</b>
              Used by borg special remotes, this configures the location of the borg repository to use. Normally
              this is automatically set up by <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>initremote</b>, but you can change it if needed.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-ddarrepo</b>
              Used by ddar special remotes, this configures the location of the ddar repository to use. Normally
              this is automatically set up by <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>initremote</b>, but you can change it if needed.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-directory</b>
              Used  by  directory  special  remotes, this configures the location of the directory where annexed
              files are stored for this remote. Normally this is automatically set up by <b>git</b>  <b>annex</b>  <b>initremote</b>,
              but you can change it if needed.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-adb</b>
              Used  to identify remotes on Android devices accessed via adb.  Normally this is automatically set
              up by <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>initremote</b>.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-androiddirectory</b>
              Used by adb special remotes, this is the directory on the Android device where  files  are  stored
              for this remote. Normally this is automatically set up by <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>initremote</b>, but you can change
              it if needed.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-androidserial</b>
              Used  by  adb special remotes, this is the serial number of the Android device used by the remote.
              Normally this is automatically set up by <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>initremote</b>, but you can change it if needed, eg
              when upgrading to a new Android device.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-s3</b>
              Used to identify Amazon S3 special remotes.  Normally this is automatically set up  by  <b>git</b>  <b>annex</b>
              <b>initremote</b>.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-glacier</b>
              Used  to  identify  Amazon  Glacier special remotes.  Normally this is automatically set up by <b>git</b>
              <b>annex</b> <b>initremote</b>.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-rclone</b>
              Used to identify rclone special remotes.  Normally this is  automatically  set  up  by  <b>git</b>  <b>annex</b>
              <b>initremote</b>.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-web</b>
              Used  to  identify  web  special  remotes.   Normally  this  is  automatically set up by <b>git</b> <b>annex</b>
              <b>initremote</b>.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-webdav</b>
              Used to identify webdav special remotes.  Normally this is  automatically  set  up  by  <b>git</b>  <b>annex</b>
              <b>initremote</b>.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-tahoe</b>
              Used to identify tahoe special remotes.  Points to the configuration directory for tahoe.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-gcrypt</b>
              Used  to  identify  gcrypt  special  remotes.   Normally this is automatically set up by <b>git</b> <b>annex</b>
              <b>initremote</b>.

              It is set to "true" if this is a gcrypt remote.  If the gcrypt remote is accessible over  ssh  and
              has git-annex-shell available to manage it, it's set to "shell".

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-git-lfs</b>
              Used  to  identify  git-lfs  special  remotes.  Normally this is automatically set up by <b>git</b> <b>annex</b>
              <b>initremote</b>.

              It is set to "true" if this is a git-lfs remote.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-httpalso</b>
              Used to identify httpalso special remotes.  Normally this is automatically set  up  by  <b>git</b>  <b>annex</b>
              <b>initremote</b>.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-externaltype</b>
              Used by external special remotes to record the type of the remote.

              Eg,  if  this  is set to "foo", git-annex will run a "git-annex-remote-foo" program to communicate
              with the external special remote.

              If this is set to "readonly", then git-annex will not run any external special remote program, but
              will try to access things stored in the remote using http.  That  only  works  for  some  external
              special remotes, so consult the documentation of the one you are using.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-hooktype</b>
              Used by hook special remotes to record the type of the remote.

       <b>annex.web-options</b>
              Options  to pass to curl when git-annex uses it to download urls (rather than the default built-in
              url downloader).

              For example, to force IPv4 only, set it to "-4".

              Setting this option makes git-annex use curl, but only when annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses is
              configured in a specific way. See its documentation.

              Setting this option prevents git-annex from using git-credential for prompting for http passwords.
              Instead, you can include "--netrc" to make curl use your <a href="file:~/.netrc">~/.netrc</a> file and  record  the  passwords
              there.

       <b>annex.youtube-dl-options</b>
              Options to pass to yt-dlp (or deprecated youtube-dl) when using it to find the url to download for
              a video.

              Some options may break git-annex's integration with yt-dlp. For example, the --output option could
              cause  it  to store files somewhere git-annex won't find them. Avoid setting here or in the yt-dlp
              config file any options that cause it to download more  than  one  file,  or  to  store  the  file
              anywhere other than the current working directory.

       <b>annex.youtube-dl-command</b>
              Default is to use "yt-dlp" or if that is not available in the PATH, to use "youtube-dl".

       <b>annex.aria-torrent-options</b>
              Options to pass to aria2c when using it to download a torrent.

       <b>annex.http-headers</b>
              HTTP  headers to send when downloading from the web. Multiple lines of this option can be set, one
              per header.

       <b>annex.http-headers-command</b>
              If set, the command is run and each line of its output is used as a HTTP  header.  This  overrides
              annex.http-headers.

       <b>annex.security.allowed-url-schemes</b>
              List  of  URL  schemes  that  git-annex is allowed to download content from.  The default is "http
              https ftp".

              Think very carefully before changing this; there are security implications. For example,  if  it's
              changed  to  allow  "file"  URLs,  then anyone who can get a commit into your git-annex repository
              could <b>git-annex</b> <b>addurl</b> a pointer to a private  file  located  outside  that  repository,  possibly
              causing  it  to  be  copied into your repository and transferred on to other remotes, exposing its
              content.

              Any url schemes supported by curl can be  listed  here,  but  you  will  also  need  to  configure
              annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses to allow using curl.

              Some special remotes support their own domain-specific URL schemes; those are not affected by this
              configuration setting.

       <b>annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses</b>
              By  default,  git-annex  only makes connections to public IP addresses; it will refuse to use HTTP
              and other servers on localhost or on a private network.

              This setting can override that behavior, allowing access to particular  IP  addresses  that  would
              normally  be blocked. For example "127.0.0.1 ::1" allows access to localhost (both IPV4 and IPV6).
              To allow access to all IP addresses, use "all"

              Think very carefully before changing this; there are security implications. Anyone who can  get  a
              commit  into your git-annex repository could <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>addurl</b> an url on a private server, possibly
              causing it to be downloaded into your repository and transferred to other  remotes,  exposing  its
              content.

              Note  that,  since the interfaces of curl and yt-dlp do not allow these IP address restrictions to
              be enforced, curl and yt-dlp will never be used unless annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses=all.

              To allow accessing local  or  private  IP  addresses  on  only  specific  ports,  use  the  syntax
              "[addr]:port".  For  example, "[127.0.0.1]:80 [127.0.0.1]:443 [::1]:80 [::1]:443" allows localhost
              on the http ports only.

       <b>annex.security.allowed-http-addresses</b>
              Old name for annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses.  If set, this is  treated  the  same  as  having
              annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses set.

       <b>annex.security.allow-unverified-downloads</b>
              For  security  reasons,  git-annex  refuses  to download content from most special remotes when it
              cannot check a hash to verify that the correct content was downloaded. This  particularly  impacts
              downloading the content of URL or WORM keys, which lack hashes.

              The  best  way to avoid problems due to this is to migrate files away from such keys, before their
              content reaches a special remote.  See <a href="../man1/git-annex-migrate.1.html">git-annex-migrate</a>(1).

              When the content is only available from a special remote, you can use this configuration to  force
              git-annex  to  download  it.  But you do so at your own risk, and it's very important you read and
              understand the information below first!

              Downloading unverified content from encrypted special remotes is prevented,  because  the  special
              remote  could send some other encrypted content than what you expect, causing git-annex to decrypt
              data that you never checked into git-annex,  and  risking  exposing  the  decrypted  data  to  any
              non-encrypted remotes you send content to.

              Downloading unverified content from (non-encrypted) external special remotes is prevented, because
              they  could  follow http redirects to web servers on localhost or on a private network, or in some
              cases to a file:/// url.

              If you decide to bypass this security check, the best thing to do is to only  set  it  temporarily
              while  running the command that gets the file.  The value to set the config to is "ACKTHPPT".  For
              example:

               git -c annex.security.allow-unverified-downloads=ACKTHPPT annex get myfile

              It would be a good idea to check that it downloaded the file you expected, too.

       <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-security-allow-unverified-downloads</b>
              Per-remote configuration of annex.security.allow-unverified-downloads.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ASSISTANT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>annex.delayadd</b>

              Makes the watch and assistant commands delay for the specified number of seconds before  adding  a
              newly  created  file  to the annex. Normally this is not needed, because they already wait for all
              writers of the file to close it.

              Note that this only delays adding files created while the daemon is running. Changes made when  it
              is not running will be added immediately the next time it is started up.

       <b>annex.expireunused</b>
              Controls what the assistant does about unused file contents that are stored in the repository.

              The  default  is  <b>false</b>,  which causes all old and unused file contents to be retained, unless the
              assistant is able to move them to some other repository (such as a backup repository).

              Can be set to a time specification, like "7d" or "1m", and then file contents that have been known
              to be unused for a week or a month will be deleted.

       <b>annex.fscknudge</b>
              When set to false, prevents the webapp from  reminding  you  when  using  repositories  that  lack
              consistency checks.

       <b>annex.autoupgrade</b>
              When set to ask (the default), the webapp will check for new versions and prompt if they should be
              upgraded  to.  When  set  to  true,  automatically  upgrades  without prompting (on some supported
              platforms). When set to false, disables any upgrade checking.

              Note that upgrade checking is only done when git-annex is  installed  from  one  of  the  prebuilt
              images  from  its  website. This does not bypass e.g., a Linux distribution's own upgrade handling
              code.

              This setting also controls whether to restart the git-annex assistant when the git-annex binary is
              detected to have changed. That is useful no matter how you installed git-annex.

       <b>annex.autocommit</b>
              Set to false to prevent the  <b>git-annex</b>  <b>assistant</b>,  <b>git-annex</b>  <b>assist</b>,  and  <b>git-annex</b>  <b>sync</b>  from
              automatically committing changes to files in the repository.

              To configure the behavior in all clones of the repository, this can be set in <a href="../man1/git-annex-config.1.html">git-annex-config</a>(1).

       <b>annex.startupscan</b>
              Set  to  false to prevent the git-annex assistant from scanning the repository for new and changed
              files on startup. This will prevent it from noticing changes that  were  made  while  it  was  not
              running, but can be a useful performance tweak for a large repository.

       <b>annex.listen</b>
              Configures  which IP address the webapp listens on.  The default is localhost. Can be either an IP
              address, or a hostname that resolves to the desired address.

       <b>annex.port</b>
              Configures which port address the webapp listens on.  The default is to pick an unused port.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>VIA</b> <b>.gitattributes</b></h4><pre>
       The key-value backend used when adding a new file to the annex can be configured on a per-file-type basis
       via <b>.gitattributes</b> files. In the file, the <b>annex.backend</b> attribute can be set to the name of the  backend
       to  use.  (See <a href="../man1/git-annex-backends.1.html">git-annex-backends</a>(1) for information about available backends.)  For example, this here's
       how to use the WORM backend by default, but the SHA256E backend for ogg files:

        * annex.backend=WORM
        *.ogg annex.backend=SHA256E

       There is a annex.largefiles attribute, which is used to configure which files  are  large  enough  to  be
       added  to  the  annex.  Since  attributes  cannot contain spaces, it is difficult to use for more complex
       annex.largefiles settings. Setting annex.largefiles in <a href="../man1/git-annex-config.1.html">git-annex-config</a>(1) is an easier way to  configure
       it across all clones of the repository.  See <a href="../man1/git-annex-matching-expression.1.html">git-annex-matching-expression</a>(1) for details on the syntax.

       The  numcopies  and  mincopies  settings  can  also  be  configured  on  a  per-file-type  basis  via the
       <b>annex.numcopies</b> and <b>annex.mincopies</b> attributes in <b>.gitattributes</b> files. This  overrides  other  settings.
       For example, this makes two copies be needed for wav files and 3 copies for flac files:

        *.wav annex.numcopies=2
        *.flac annex.numcopies=3

       These  settings  are honored by git-annex whenever it's operating on a matching file. However, when using
       --all, --unused, or --key to specify keys to operate on, git-annex is operating on keys and not files, so
       will not honor the settings from .gitattributes. For this reason, the git annex numcopies <b>and</b>  git  annex
       mincopies commands are useful to configure a global default.

       Also note that when using views, only the toplevel .gitattributes file is preserved in the view, so other
       settings in other files won't have any effect.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       git-annex  itself will exit 0 on success and 1 on failure, unless the <b>--size-limit</b> or <b>--time-limit</b> option
       is hit, in which case it exits 101.

       A few git-annex subcommands have other exit statuses  used  to  indicate  specific  problems,  which  are
       documented on their individual man pages.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       These environment variables are used by git-annex when set:

       <b>GIT_WORK_TREE</b>, <b>GIT_DIR</b>
              Handled the same as they are by git, see <a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a>(1)

       <b>GIT_SSH</b>, <b>GIT_SSH_COMMAND</b>
              Handled  similarly  to the same as described in <a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a>(1).  The one difference is that git-annex will
              sometimes pass an additional "-n" parameter to these, as the first parameter, to prevent ssh  from
              reading  from  stdin. Since that can break existing uses of these environment variables that don't
              expect the extra parameter, you will need to set <b>GIT_ANNEX_USE_GIT_SSH=1</b> to make git-annex support
              these.

              Note that setting either of these environment  variables  prevents  git-annex  from  automatically
              enabling  ssh connection caching (see <b>annex.sshcaching</b>), so it will slow down some operations with
              remotes over ssh. It's up to you to enable ssh connection  caching  if  you  need  it;  see  ssh's
              documentation.

              Also,  <b>annex.ssh-options</b>  and  <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.annex-ssh-options</b>  won't  have  any effect when these
              envionment variables are set.

              Usually it's better to configure any desired  options  through  your  <a href="file:~/.ssh/config">~/.ssh/config</a>  file,  or  by
              setting <b>annex.ssh-options</b>.

       <b>GIT_ANNEX_VECTOR_CLOCK</b>
              Normally  git-annex  timestamps  lines in the log files committed to the git-annex branch. Setting
              this environment variable to a number will make git-annex use that (or  a  larger  number)  rather
              than the current number of seconds since the UNIX epoch.  Note that decimal seconds are supported.

              This  is  only  provided  for  advanced users who either have a better way to tell which commit is
              current than the local clock, or who need to avoid embedding timestamps for policy reasons.

       Some special remotes use additional environment variables
              for authentication etc. For example, <b>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</b> and  <b>GIT_ANNEX_P2P_AUTHTOKEN</b>.  See  special
              remote documentation.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       These files are used by git-annex:

       <b>.git/annex/objects/</b>  in  your  git  repository  contains  the  annexed  file  contents that are currently
       available. Annexed files in your git repository symlink to that content.

       <b>.git/annex/</b> in your git repository contains other run-time information used by git-annex.

       <b><a href="file:~/.config/git-annex/autostart">~/.config/git-annex/autostart</a></b> is a list of git repositories to start the git-annex assistant in.

       <b>.git/hooks/pre-commit-annex</b> in your git repository will be run whenever a commit  is  made  to  the  HEAD
       branch, either by git commit, git-annex sync, or the git-annex assistant.

       <b>.git/hooks/post-update-annex</b> in your git repository will be run whenever the git-annex branch is updated.
       You can make this hook run <b>git</b> <b>update-server-info</b> when publishing a git-annex repository by http.
