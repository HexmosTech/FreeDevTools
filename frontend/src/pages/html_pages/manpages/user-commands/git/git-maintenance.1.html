</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-maintenance - Run tasks to optimize Git repository data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git</u> <u>maintenance</u> run [&lt;options&gt;]
       <u>git</u> <u>maintenance</u> start [--scheduler=&lt;scheduler&gt;]
       <u>git</u> <u>maintenance</u> (stop|register|unregister) [&lt;options&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Run tasks to optimize Git repository data, speeding up other Git commands and reducing storage
       requirements for the repository.

       Git commands that add repository data, such as <b>git</b> <b>add</b> or <b>git</b> <b>fetch</b>, are optimized for a responsive user
       experience. These commands do not take time to optimize the Git data, since such optimizations scale with
       the full size of the repository while these user commands each perform a relatively small action.

       The <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> command provides flexibility for how to optimize the Git repository.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCOMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       run
           Run one or more maintenance tasks. If one or more <b>--task</b> options are specified, then those tasks are
           run in that order. Otherwise, the tasks are determined by which <b>maintenance.</b><u>&lt;task&gt;</u><b>.enabled</b> config
           options are true. By default, only <b>maintenance.gc.enabled</b> is true.

       start
           Start running maintenance on the current repository. This performs the same config updates as the
           <b>register</b> subcommand, then updates the background scheduler to run <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> <b>--scheduled</b> on
           an hourly basis.

       stop
           Halt the background maintenance schedule. The current repository is not removed from the list of
           maintained repositories, in case the background maintenance is restarted later.

       register
           Initialize Git config values so any scheduled maintenance will start running on this repository. This
           adds the repository to the <b>maintenance.repo</b> config variable in the current user’s global config, or
           the config specified by --config-file option, and enables some recommended configuration values for
           <b>maintenance.</b><u>&lt;task&gt;</u><b>.schedule</b>. The tasks that are enabled are safe for running in the background
           without disrupting foreground processes.

           The <b>register</b> subcommand will also set the <b>maintenance.strategy</b> config value to <b>incremental</b>, if this
           value is not previously set. The <b>incremental</b> strategy uses the following schedule for each
           maintenance task:

           •   <b>gc</b>: disabled.

           •   <b>commit-graph</b>: hourly.

           •   <b>prefetch</b>: hourly.

           •   <b>loose-objects</b>: daily.

           •   <b>incremental-repack</b>: daily.

           <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>register</b> will also disable foreground maintenance by setting <b>maintenance.auto</b> <b>=</b> <b>false</b>
           in the current repository. This config setting will remain after a <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>unregister</b>
           command.

       unregister
           Remove the current repository from background maintenance. This only removes the repository from the
           configured list. It does not stop the background maintenance processes from running.

           The <b>unregister</b> subcommand will report an error if the current repository is not already registered.
           Use the <b>--force</b> option to return success even when the current repository is not registered.

</pre><h4><b>TASKS</b></h4><pre>
       commit-graph
           The <b>commit-graph</b> job updates the <b>commit-graph</b> files incrementally, then verifies that the written
           data is correct. The incremental write is safe to run alongside concurrent Git processes since it
           will not expire <b>.graph</b> files that were in the previous <b>commit-graph-chain</b> file. They will be deleted
           by a later run based on the expiration delay.

       prefetch
           The <b>prefetch</b> task updates the object directory with the latest objects from all registered remotes.
           For each remote, a <b>git</b> <b>fetch</b> command is run. The configured refspec is modified to place all
           requested refs within <b>refs/prefetch/</b>. Also, tags are not updated.

           This is done to avoid disrupting the remote-tracking branches. The end users expect these refs to
           stay unmoved unless they initiate a fetch. However, with the prefetch task, the objects necessary to
           complete a later real fetch would already be obtained, making the real fetch faster. In the ideal
           case, it will just become an update to a bunch of remote-tracking branches without any object
           transfer.

           The <b>remote.</b><u>&lt;name&gt;</u><b>.skipFetchAll</b> configuration can be used to exclude a particular remote from getting
           prefetched.

       gc
           Clean up unnecessary files and optimize the local repository. "GC" stands for "garbage collection,"
           but this task performs many smaller tasks. This task can be expensive for large repositories, as it
           repacks all Git objects into a single pack-file. It can also be disruptive in some situations, as it
           deletes stale data. See <b><a href="../man1/git-gc.1.html">git-gc</a></b>(1) for more details on garbage collection in Git.

       loose-objects
           The <b>loose-objects</b> job cleans up loose objects and places them into pack-files. In order to prevent
           race conditions with concurrent Git commands, it follows a two-step process. First, it deletes any
           loose objects that already exist in a pack-file; concurrent Git processes will examine the pack-file
           for the object data instead of the loose object. Second, it creates a new pack-file (starting with
           "loose-") containing a batch of loose objects. The batch size is limited to 50 thousand objects to
           prevent the job from taking too long on a repository with many loose objects. The <b>gc</b> task writes
           unreachable objects as loose objects to be cleaned up by a later step only if they are not re-added
           to a pack-file; for this reason it is not advisable to enable both the <b>loose-objects</b> and <b>gc</b> tasks at
           the same time.

       incremental-repack
           The <b>incremental-repack</b> job repacks the object directory using the <b>multi-pack-index</b> feature. In order
           to prevent race conditions with concurrent Git commands, it follows a two-step process. First, it
           calls <b>git</b> <b>multi-pack-index</b> <b>expire</b> to delete pack-files unreferenced by the <b>multi-pack-index</b> file.
           Second, it calls <b>git</b> <b>multi-pack-index</b> <b>repack</b> to select several small pack-files and repack them into
           a bigger one, and then update the <b>multi-pack-index</b> entries that refer to the small pack-files to
           refer to the new pack-file. This prepares those small pack-files for deletion upon the next run of
           <b>git</b> <b>multi-pack-index</b> <b>expire</b>. The selection of the small pack-files is such that the expected size of
           the big pack-file is at least the batch size; see the <b>--batch-size</b> option for the <b>repack</b> subcommand
           in <b><a href="../man1/git-multi-pack-index.1.html">git-multi-pack-index</a></b>(1). The default batch-size is zero, which is a special case that attempts to
           repack all pack-files into a single pack-file.

       pack-refs
           The <b>pack-refs</b> task collects the loose reference files and collects them into a single file. This
           speeds up operations that need to iterate across many references. See <b><a href="../man1/git-pack-refs.1.html">git-pack-refs</a></b>(1) for more
           information.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --auto
           When combined with the <b>run</b> subcommand, run maintenance tasks only if certain thresholds are met. For
           example, the <b>gc</b> task runs when the number of loose objects exceeds the number stored in the <b>gc.auto</b>
           config setting, or when the number of pack-files exceeds the <b>gc.autoPackLimit</b> config setting. Not
           compatible with the <b>--schedule</b> option.

       --schedule
           When combined with the <b>run</b> subcommand, run maintenance tasks only if certain time conditions are met,
           as specified by the <b>maintenance.</b><u>&lt;task&gt;</u><b>.schedule</b> config value for each <u>&lt;task&gt;</u>. This config value
           specifies a number of seconds since the last time that task ran, according to the
           <b>maintenance.</b><u>&lt;task&gt;</u><b>.lastRun</b> config value. The tasks that are tested are those provided by the
           <b>--task=</b><u>&lt;task&gt;</u> option(s) or those with <b>maintenance.</b><u>&lt;task&gt;</u><b>.enabled</b> set to true.

       --quiet
           Do not report progress or other information over <b>stderr</b>.

       --task=&lt;task&gt;
           If this option is specified one or more times, then only run the specified tasks in the specified
           order. If no <b>--task=</b><u>&lt;task&gt;</u> arguments are specified, then only the tasks with
           <b>maintenance.</b><u>&lt;task&gt;</u><b>.enabled</b> configured as <b>true</b> are considered. See the <u>TASKS</u> section for the list of
           accepted <u>&lt;task&gt;</u> values.

       --scheduler=auto|crontab|systemd-timer|launchctl|schtasks
           When combined with the <b>start</b> subcommand, specify the scheduler for running the hourly, daily and
           weekly executions of <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b>. Possible values for <u>&lt;scheduler&gt;</u> are <b>auto</b>, <b>crontab</b> (POSIX),
           <b>systemd-timer</b> (Linux), <b>launchctl</b> (macOS), and <b>schtasks</b> (Windows). When <b>auto</b> is specified, the
           appropriate platform-specific scheduler is used; on Linux, <b>systemd-timer</b> is used if available,
           otherwise <b>crontab</b>. Default is <b>auto</b>.

</pre><h4><b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> command is designed to simplify the repository maintenance patterns while minimizing
       user wait time during Git commands. A variety of configuration options are available to allow customizing
       this process. The default maintenance options focus on operations that complete quickly, even on large
       repositories.

       Users may find some cases where scheduled maintenance tasks do not run as frequently as intended. Each
       <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> command takes a lock on the repository’s object database, and this prevents other
       concurrent <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> commands from running on the same repository. Without this safeguard,
       competing processes could leave the repository in an unpredictable state.

       The background maintenance schedule runs <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> processes on an hourly basis. Each run
       executes the "hourly" tasks. At midnight, that process also executes the "daily" tasks. At midnight on
       the first day of the week, that process also executes the "weekly" tasks. A single process iterates over
       each registered repository, performing the scheduled tasks for that frequency. The processes are
       scheduled to a random minute of the hour per client to spread out the load that multiple clients might
       generate (e.g. from prefetching). Depending on the number of registered repositories and their sizes,
       this process may take longer than an hour. In this case, multiple <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> commands may run on
       the same repository at the same time, colliding on the object database lock. This results in one of the
       two tasks not running.

       If you find that some maintenance windows are taking longer than one hour to complete, then consider
       reducing the complexity of your maintenance tasks. For example, the <b>gc</b> task is much slower than the
       <b>incremental-repack</b> task. However, this comes at a cost of a slightly larger object database. Consider
       moving more expensive tasks to be run less frequently.

       Expert users may consider scheduling their own maintenance tasks using a different schedule than is
       available through <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> and Git configuration options. These users should be aware of the
       object database lock and how concurrent <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> commands behave. Further, the <b>git</b> <b>gc</b> command
       should not be combined with <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> commands. <b>git</b> <b>gc</b> modifies the object database but does
       not take the lock in the same way as <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b>. If possible, use <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> <b>--task=gc</b>
       instead of <b>git</b> <b>gc</b>.

       The following sections describe the mechanisms put in place to run background maintenance by <b>git</b>
       <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> and how to customize them.

</pre><h4><b>BACKGROUND</b> <b>MAINTENANCE</b> <b>ON</b> <b>POSIX</b> <b>SYSTEMS</b></h4><pre>
       The standard mechanism for scheduling background tasks on POSIX systems is <a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron</a>(8). This tool executes
       commands based on a given schedule. The current list of user-scheduled tasks can be found by running
       <b>crontab</b> <b>-l</b>. The schedule written by <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> is similar to this:

           # BEGIN GIT MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE
           # The following schedule was created by Git
           # Any edits made in this region might be
           # replaced in the future by a Git command.

           0 1-23 * * * "/&lt;path&gt;/git" --exec-path="/&lt;path&gt;" for-each-repo --config=maintenance.repo maintenance run --schedule=hourly
           0 0 * * 1-6 "/&lt;path&gt;/git" --exec-path="/&lt;path&gt;" for-each-repo --config=maintenance.repo maintenance run --schedule=daily
           0 0 * * 0 "/&lt;path&gt;/git" --exec-path="/&lt;path&gt;" for-each-repo --config=maintenance.repo maintenance run --schedule=weekly

           # END GIT MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE

       The comments are used as a region to mark the schedule as written by Git. Any modifications within this
       region will be completely deleted by <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>stop</b> or overwritten by <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b>.

       The <b>crontab</b> entry specifies the full path of the <b>git</b> executable to ensure that the executed <b>git</b> command
       is the same one with which <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> was issued independent of <b>PATH</b>. If the same user runs
       <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> with multiple Git executables, then only the latest executable is used.

       These commands use <b>git</b> <b>for-each-repo</b> <b>--config=maintenance.repo</b> to run <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b>
       <b>--schedule=</b><u>&lt;frequency&gt;</u> on each repository listed in the multi-valued <b>maintenance.repo</b> config option.
       These are typically loaded from the user-specific global config. The <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> process then
       determines which maintenance tasks are configured to run on each repository with each <u>&lt;frequency&gt;</u> using
       the <b>maintenance.</b><u>&lt;task&gt;</u><b>.schedule</b> config options. These values are loaded from the global or repository
       config values.

       If the config values are insufficient to achieve your desired background maintenance schedule, then you
       can create your own schedule. If you run <b>crontab</b> <b>-e</b>, then an editor will load with your user-specific
       <b>cron</b> schedule. In that editor, you can add your own schedule lines. You could start by adapting the
       default schedule listed earlier, or you could read the <a href="../man5/crontab.5.html">crontab</a>(5) documentation for advanced scheduling
       techniques. Please do use the full path and <b>--exec-path</b> techniques from the default schedule to ensure
       you are executing the correct binaries in your schedule.

</pre><h4><b>BACKGROUND</b> <b>MAINTENANCE</b> <b>ON</b> <b>LINUX</b> <b>SYSTEMD</b> <b>SYSTEMS</b></h4><pre>
       While Linux supports <b>cron</b>, depending on the distribution, <b>cron</b> may be an optional package not necessarily
       installed. On modern Linux distributions, systemd timers are superseding it.

       If user systemd timers are available, they will be used as a replacement of <b>cron</b>.

       In this case, <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> will create user systemd timer units and start the timers. The
       current list of user-scheduled tasks can be found by running <b>systemctl</b> <b>--user</b> <b>list-timers</b>. The timers
       written by <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> are similar to this:

           $ systemctl --user list-timers
           NEXT                         LEFT          LAST                         PASSED     UNIT                         ACTIVATES
           Thu 2021-04-29 19:00:00 CEST 42min left    Thu 2021-04-29 18:00:11 CEST 17min ago  <a href="mailto:git-maintenance@hourly.timer">git-maintenance@hourly.timer</a> <a href="mailto:git-maintenance@hourly.service">git-maintenance@hourly.service</a>
           Fri 2021-04-30 00:00:00 CEST 5h 42min left Thu 2021-04-29 00:00:11 CEST 18h ago    <a href="mailto:git-maintenance@daily.timer">git-maintenance@daily.timer</a>  <a href="mailto:git-maintenance@daily.service">git-maintenance@daily.service</a>
           Mon 2021-05-03 00:00:00 CEST 3 days left   Mon 2021-04-26 00:00:11 CEST 3 days ago <a href="mailto:git-maintenance@weekly.timer">git-maintenance@weekly.timer</a> <a href="mailto:git-maintenance@weekly.service">git-maintenance@weekly.service</a>

       One timer is registered for each <b>--schedule=</b><u>&lt;frequency&gt;</u> option.

       The definition of the systemd units can be inspected in the following files:

           <a href="file:~/.config/systemd/user/git-maintenance">~/.config/systemd/user/git-maintenance</a>@.timer
           <a href="file:~/.config/systemd/user/git-maintenance">~/.config/systemd/user/git-maintenance</a>@.service
           <a href="file:~/.config/systemd/user/timers.target.wants/">~/.config/systemd/user/timers.target.wants/</a><a href="mailto:git-maintenance@hourly.timer">git-maintenance@hourly.timer</a>
           <a href="file:~/.config/systemd/user/timers.target.wants/">~/.config/systemd/user/timers.target.wants/</a><a href="mailto:git-maintenance@daily.timer">git-maintenance@daily.timer</a>
           <a href="file:~/.config/systemd/user/timers.target.wants/">~/.config/systemd/user/timers.target.wants/</a><a href="mailto:git-maintenance@weekly.timer">git-maintenance@weekly.timer</a>

       <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> will overwrite these files and start the timer again with <b>systemctl</b> <b>--user</b>, so any
       customization should be done by creating a drop-in file, i.e. a <b>.conf</b> suffixed file in the
       <b><a href="file:~/.config/systemd/user/git-maintenance">~/.config/systemd/user/git-maintenance</a>@.service.d</b> directory.

       <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>stop</b> will stop the user systemd timers and delete the above mentioned files.

       For more details, see <b>systemd.timer</b>(<b>5</b>).

</pre><h4><b>BACKGROUND</b> <b>MAINTENANCE</b> <b>ON</b> <b>MACOS</b> <b>SYSTEMS</b></h4><pre>
       While macOS technically supports <b>cron</b>, using <b>crontab</b> <b>-e</b> requires elevated privileges and the executed
       process does not have a full user context. Without a full user context, Git and its credential helpers
       cannot access stored credentials, so some maintenance tasks are not functional.

       Instead, <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> interacts with the <b>launchctl</b> tool, which is the recommended way to
       schedule timed jobs in macOS. Scheduling maintenance through <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> (<b>start</b>|<b>stop</b>) requires some
       <b>launchctl</b> features available only in macOS 10.11 or later.

       Your user-specific scheduled tasks are stored as XML-formatted <b>.plist</b> files in <b><a href="file:~/Library/LaunchAgents/">~/Library/LaunchAgents/</a></b>.
       You can see the currently-registered tasks using the following command:

           $ ls <a href="file:~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.git-scm.git">~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.git-scm.git</a>*
           org.git-scm.git.daily.plist
           org.git-scm.git.hourly.plist
           org.git-scm.git.weekly.plist

       One task is registered for each <b>--schedule=</b><u>&lt;frequency&gt;</u> option. To inspect how the XML format describes
       each schedule, open one of these <b>.plist</b> files in an editor and inspect the <u>&lt;array&gt;</u> element following the
       <u>&lt;key&gt;</u><b>StartCalendarInterval</b>&lt;/key&gt; element.

       <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> will overwrite these files and register the tasks again with <b>launchctl</b>, so any
       customizations should be done by creating your own <b>.plist</b> files with distinct names. Similarly, the <b>git</b>
       <b>maintenance</b> <b>stop</b> command will unregister the tasks with <b>launchctl</b> and delete the <b>.plist</b> files.

       To create more advanced customizations to your background tasks, see <a href="../man5/launchctl.plist.5.html">launchctl.plist</a>(5) for more
       information.

</pre><h4><b>BACKGROUND</b> <b>MAINTENANCE</b> <b>ON</b> <b>WINDOWS</b> <b>SYSTEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Windows does not support <b>cron</b> and instead has its own system for scheduling background tasks. The <b>git</b>
       <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> command uses the <b>schtasks</b> command to submit tasks to this system. You can inspect all
       background tasks using the Task Scheduler application. The tasks added by Git have names of the form <b>Git</b>
       <b>Maintenance</b> (<u>&lt;frequency&gt;</u>). The Task Scheduler GUI has ways to inspect these tasks, but you can also
       export the tasks to XML files and view the details there.

       Note that since Git is a console application, these background tasks create a console window visible to
       the current user. This can be changed manually by selecting the "Run whether user is logged in or not"
       option in Task Scheduler. This change requires a password input, which is why <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>start</b> does
       not select it by default.

       If you want to customize the background tasks, please rename the tasks so future calls to <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b>
       (<b>start</b>|<b>stop</b>) do not overwrite your custom tasks.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Everything below this line in this section is selectively included from the <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1) documentation.
       The content is the same as what’s found there:

       maintenance.auto
           This boolean config option controls whether some commands run <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> <b>--auto</b> after doing
           their normal work. Defaults to true.

       maintenance.autoDetach
           Many Git commands trigger automatic maintenance after they have written data into the repository.
           This boolean config option controls whether this automatic maintenance shall happen in the foreground
           or whether the maintenance process shall detach and continue to run in the background.

           If unset, the value of <b>gc.autoDetach</b> is used as a fallback. Defaults to true if both are unset,
           meaning that the maintenance process will detach.

       maintenance.strategy
           This string config option provides a way to specify one of a few recommended schedules for background
           maintenance. This only affects which tasks are run during <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> <b>--schedule=X</b> commands,
           provided no <b>--task=</b><u>&lt;task&gt;</u> arguments are provided. Further, if a <b>maintenance.</b><u>&lt;task&gt;</u><b>.schedule</b> config
           value is set, then that value is used instead of the one provided by <b>maintenance.strategy</b>. The
           possible strategy strings are:

           •   <b>none</b>: This default setting implies no tasks are run at any schedule.

           •   <b>incremental</b>: This setting optimizes for performing small maintenance activities that do not
               delete any data. This does not schedule the <b>gc</b> task, but runs the <b>prefetch</b> and <b>commit-graph</b> tasks
               hourly, the <b>loose-objects</b> and <b>incremental-repack</b> tasks daily, and the <b>pack-refs</b> task weekly.

       maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.enabled
           This boolean config option controls whether the maintenance task with name <u>&lt;task&gt;</u> is run when no
           <b>--task</b> option is specified to <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b>. These config values are ignored if a <b>--task</b> option
           exists. By default, only <b>maintenance.gc.enabled</b> is true.

       maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.schedule
           This config option controls whether or not the given <u>&lt;task&gt;</u> runs during a <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b>
           <b>--schedule=</b><u>&lt;frequency&gt;</u> command. The value must be one of "hourly", "daily", or "weekly".

       maintenance.commit-graph.auto
           This integer config option controls how often the <b>commit-graph</b> task should be run as part of <b>git</b>
           <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> <b>--auto</b>. If zero, then the <b>commit-graph</b> task will not run with the <b>--auto</b> option. A
           negative value will force the task to run every time. Otherwise, a positive value implies the command
           should run when the number of reachable commits that are not in the commit-graph file is at least the
           value of <b>maintenance.commit-graph.auto</b>. The default value is 100.

       maintenance.loose-objects.auto
           This integer config option controls how often the <b>loose-objects</b> task should be run as part of <b>git</b>
           <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> <b>--auto</b>. If zero, then the <b>loose-objects</b> task will not run with the <b>--auto</b> option. A
           negative value will force the task to run every time. Otherwise, a positive value implies the command
           should run when the number of loose objects is at least the value of <b>maintenance.loose-objects.auto</b>.
           The default value is 100.

       maintenance.incremental-repack.auto
           This integer config option controls how often the <b>incremental-repack</b> task should be run as part of
           <b>git</b> <b>maintenance</b> <b>run</b> <b>--auto</b>. If zero, then the <b>incremental-repack</b> task will not run with the <b>--auto</b>
           option. A negative value will force the task to run every time. Otherwise, a positive value implies
           the command should run when the number of pack-files not in the multi-pack-index is at least the
           value of <b>maintenance.incremental-repack.auto</b>. The default value is 10.
