</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       svn2git - migrates from svn to git

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       svn2git  -  is  a  tiny  utility  for  migrating projects from Subversion to Git while keeping the trunk,
       branches and tags where they should be. It uses git-svn to clone an svn repository and does some clean-up
       to make sure branches and tags are imported in a meaningful way, and that the code  checked  into  master
       ends  up  being  what's currently in your svn trunk rather than whichever svn branch your last commit was
       in.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       For instance this could be a situation in a svn repository:

       <b>trunk</b>  ...

       <b>branches</b>
              1.x 2.x

       <b>tags</b>   1.0.0 1.0.1 1.0.2 1.1.0 2.0.0

       git-svn will go through the commit history to build a new git repo. It will import all branches and  tags
       as remote svn branches, whereas what you really want is git-native local branches and git tag objects. So
       after importing this project you'll get:

              <b>$</b> <b>git</b> <b>branch</b>
               * master

              <b>$</b> <b>git</b> <b>branch</b> <b>-a</b>
               * master
               1.x
               2.x
               tags/1.0.0
               tags/1.0.1
               tags/1.0.2
               tags/1.1.0
               tags/2.0.0
               trunk

              <b>$</b> <b>git</b> <b>tag</b> <b>-l</b>
               [ empty ]

       After svn2git is done with your project, you'll get this instead:

              <b>$</b> <b>git</b> <b>branch</b>
               * master
               1.x
               2.x

              <b>$</b> <b>git</b> <b>tag</b> <b>-l</b>
               1.0.0
               1.0.1
               1.0.2
               1.1.0
               2.0.0

       Finally, it makes sure the HEAD of master is the same as the current trunk of the svn repo.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       Make  sure  you  have git, git-svn, and ruby installed. svn2git is a ruby wrapper around git's native SVN
       support through git-svn.  It is possible to have git installed without git-svn installed,  so  please  do
       verify  that  you  can  run  <u>$</u>  <u>git</u> <u>svn</u> successfully.  For a Debian-based system, the installation of the
       prerequisites would look like:

         $ sudo apt-get install git-core git-svn ruby rubygems

       Once you have the necessary software on your system, you can install svn2git through rubygems, which will
       add the <u>svn2git</u> command to your PATH.

         $ sudo gem install svn2git

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       There are several ways you can create a git repo from an existing svn repo. The differentiating factor is
       the svn repo layout. Below is an enumerated listing of the varying supported layouts and the  proper  way
       to create a git repo from a svn repo in the specified layout.

       1. The svn repo is in the standard layout of (trunk, branches, tags) at the root
          level of the repo.

            $ svn2git <u><a href="http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo">http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo</a></u>

       2. The svn repo is NOT in standard layout and has only a trunk and tags at the
          root level of the repo.

            $ svn2git <u><a href="http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo">http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo</a></u> --trunk dev \
              --tags rel --nobranches

       3. The svn repo is NOT in standard layout and has only a trunk at the root level
          of the repo.

            $ svn2git <u><a href="http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo">http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo</a></u> --trunk trunk \
              --nobranches --notags

       4. The svn repo is NOT in standard layout and has no trunk, branches, or tags at
          the root level of the repo. Instead the root level of the repo is equivalent to
          the trunk and there are no tags or branches.

            $ svn2git <u><a href="http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo">http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo</a></u> --rootistrunk

       5. The svn repo is in the standard layout but you want to exclude the massive doc
          directory and the backup files you once accidentally added.

            $ svn2git <u><a href="http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo">http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo</a></u> --exclude doc \
              --exclude '.*~$'

       6. The svn repo actually tracks several projects and you only want to migrate one
          of them.

            $ svn2git <u><a href="http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo/nested_project">http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo/nested_project</a></u> \
              --no-minimize-url

          If the svn repo is password protected.

            $ svn2git <u><a href="http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo">http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo</a></u> \
              --username &lt;&lt;user_with_perms&gt;&gt;

          You need to migrate starting at a specific svn revision number.

            $ svn2git <u><a href="http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo">http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo</a></u> \
              --revision &lt;&lt;starting_revision_number&gt;&gt;

          You need to migrate starting at a specific svn revision number, ending at a
          specific revision number.

            $ svn2git <u><a href="http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo">http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo</a></u> --revision \
            &lt;&lt;starting_revision_number&gt;&gt;:&lt;&lt;ending_revision_number&gt;&gt;

          Include metadata (git-svn-id) in git logs.

            $ svn2git <u><a href="http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo">http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo</a></u> --metadata

          The above will create a git repository in the current directory with the git
          version of the svn repository. Hence, you need to make a directory that you
          want your new git repo to exist in, change into it and then run one of the
          above commands. Note that in the above cases the trunk, branches, tags options
          are simply folder names relative to the provided repo path. For example if you
          specified trunk=foo branches=bar and tags=foobar it would be referencing
          <u><a href="http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo/foo">http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo/foo</a></u> as your trunk, and so on.
          However, in case 4 it references the root of the repo as trunk.

          As of svn2git 2.0 there is a new feature to pull in the latest changes from SVN
          into your git repository created with svn2git.  This is a one way sync, but
          allows you to use svn2git as a mirroring tool for your SVN repositories.

          The command to call is:

            $ cd &lt;EXISTING_REPO&gt; &amp;&amp; svn2git --rebase

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       To  convert  all  your svn authors to git format, create a file somewhere on your system with the list of
       conversions to make, one per line, for example:

         jcoglan = James Coglan &lt;<u><a href="mailto:jcoglan@never-you-mind.com">jcoglan@never-you-mind.com</a></u>&gt;
         stnick = Santa Claus &lt;<u><a href="mailto:nicholas@lapland.com">nicholas@lapland.com</a></u>&gt;

       Then pass an _authors_ option to svn2git pointing to your file:

         $ svn2git <u><a href="http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo">http://svn.example.com/path/to/repo</a></u> \
           --authors <a href="file:~/authors.txt">~/authors.txt</a>

       Alternatively, you can place the authors file into <u><a href="file:~/.svn2git/authors">~/.svn2git/authors</a></u> and svn2git will  load  it  out  of
       there.  This  allows  you  to build up one authors file for all your projects and have it loaded for each
       repository that you migrate.

       If you need a jump start on figuring out what users made changes in your svn repositories  the  following
       command  sequence might help. It grabs all the logs from the svn repository, pulls out all the names from
       the commits, sorts them, and then reduces the list to only unique names. So, in the end it outputs a list
       of usernames of the people that made commits to the svn repository which name on its own line. This would
       allow you to easily redirect the output of this command sequence to <u><a href="file:~/.svn2git/authors">~/.svn2git/authors</a></u> and  have  a  very
       good starting point for your mapping.

         $ svn log --quiet | grep -E "r[0-9]+ | .+ |" \
           | cut -d'|' -f2 | sed 's/^ //' | sort | uniq

       Or, for a remote URL:

         $ svn log --quiet <u><a href="http://path/to/root/of/project">http://path/to/root/of/project</a></u> \
           | grep -E "r[0-9]+ | .+ |" | cut -d'|' -f2 \
           | sed 's/^ //' | sort | uniq

</pre><h4><b>DEBUGGING</b></h4><pre>
       If you're having problems with converting your repository and you're not sure why, try turning on verbose
       logging.  This will print out more information from the underlying git-svn process.

       You can turn on verbose logging with the <u>-v</u> or <u>--verbose</u> flags, like so:

         $ svn2git <u><a href="http://svn.yoursite.com/path/to/repo">http://svn.yoursite.com/path/to/repo</a></u> --verbose

</pre><h4><b>FAQ</b></h4><pre>
       1. Why  don't the tags show up in the master branch?  The tags won't show up in the master branch because
          the tags are actually tied to the commits that were created in svn when the user made the tag.   Those
          commits  are the first (head) commit of branch in svn that is associated with that tag. If you want to
          see all the branches and tags and their relationships in gitk you can run the following: gitk --all

          For further details please refer to FAQ #2.

       2. Why don't you reference the parent of the tag commits instead?  In svn you are forced to  create  what
          are  known  in  git as annotated tags.  It just so happens that svn annotated tags allow you to commit
          change sets along with the tagging action. This means that the svn annotated tag is a bit more complex
          then just an annotated tag it is a commit which is treated as an annotated tag. Hence, for there to be
          a true 1-to-1 mapping between git and svn we have to transfer over the svn commit  which  acts  as  an
          annotated tag and then tag that commit in git using an annotated tag.

          If  we  were  to  reference the parent of this svn tagged commit there could potentially be situations
          where a developer would checkout a tag in git and the resulting code base would be different  than  if
          they  checked  out  that very same tag in the original svn repo. This is only due to the fact that the
          svn tags allow changesets in them, making them not just annotated tags.
