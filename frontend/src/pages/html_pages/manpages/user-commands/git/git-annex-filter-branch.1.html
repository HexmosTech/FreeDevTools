</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-annex-filter-branch - filter information from the git-annex branch

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       git annex filter-branch [...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  copies  selected  information  from  the git-annex branch into a git commit object, and outputs its
       hash. The git commit can be transported to another git repository,  and  given  a  branch  name  such  as
       "foo/git-annex", and git-annex there will automatically merge that into its git-annex branch. This allows
       publishing some information from your git-annex branch, without publishing the whole thing.

       Other ways to avoid publishing information from a git-annex branch, or remove information from it include
       <a href="../man1/git-annex-forget.1.html">git-annex-forget</a>(1),  the  <b>annex.private</b> git config, and the <b>--private</b> option to <a href="../man1/git-annex-initremote.1.html">git-annex-initremote</a>(1).
       Those are much easier to use, but this provides full control for those who need it.

       With no options, no information at all will be included from the git-annex branch. Use options to specify
       what to include. All options can be specified multiple times.

       When the repository contains information about a private repository (due to <b>annex.private</b> being  set,  or
       git-annex initremote --private being used), that private information will be included when allowed by the
       options, even though it is not recorded on the git-annex branch.

       When  a  repository  was created with <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>initremote</b> <b>--sameas=foo</b>, its information will be included
       when the information for foo is, and excluded when foo is excluded.

       When a special remote is  configured  with  importtree=yes  or  exporttree=yes,  normally  the  git  tree
       corresponding to the repository is included in the git-annex branch, to make sure it does not get garbage
       collected  by  <b>git</b>  <b>gc</b>.  Those trees are *not* included when filtering the git-annex branch. Usually this
       will not cause any problems, but if such a tree does get garbage collected,  it  will  prevent  accessing
       files on the special remote, until the next time a tree is imported or exported to it.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>path</b>

              Include information about all keys of annexed files in the path.

       file matching options
              The <a href="../man1/git-annex-matching-options.1.html">git-annex-matching-options</a>(1) can be used to specify which files in a path to include.

       <b>--branch=ref</b>
              Include information about keys referred of annexed files in the branch or treeish.

       <b>--key=key</b>
              Include information about a specific key.

       <b>--all</b>  Include information about all keys.

       <b>--include-key-information-for=repo</b>
              When  including  information  about  a  key,  include information specific to this repository. The
              repository can be specified with a uuid or  the  name  of  a  remote.  This  option  can  be  used
              repeatedly to include several repositories.

       <b>--include-all-key-information</b>
              Include    key    information    for    all   repositories,   except   any   excluded   with   the
              <b>--exclude-key-information-for</b> option.

       <b>--exclude-key-information-for=repo</b>
              When including information about a key, exclude  information  specific  to  this  repository.  The
              repository  can  be  specified  with  a  uuid  or  the  name  of a remote. This option can be used
              repeatedly to exclude several repositories.

       <b>--include-repo-config-for=repo</b>
              Include configuration specific to this repository.  The repository can be specified with a uuid or
              the name of a remote.

              This includes the configuration of special remotes, which may  include  embedded  credentials,  or
              encryption  parameters.  It  also  includes  trust  settings,  preferred content, etc. It does not
              include information about any git-annex keys. This  option  can  be  used  repeatedly  to  include
              several repositories.

       <b>--include-all-repo-config</b>
              Include   the   configuration   of   all   repositories,   except   for   any  excluded  with  the
              <b>--exclude-repo-config-for</b> option.

       <b>--exclude-repo-config-for=repo</b>
              Exclude configuration specific to this repository.  The repository can be specified with a uuid or
              the name of a remote.  This option can be used repeatedly to exclude several repositories.

       <b>--include-global-config</b>
              Include global configuration, that is not specific to any repository.

              This includes configs stored by <a href="../man1/git-annex-numcopies.1.html">git-annex-numcopies</a>(1), <a href="../man1/git-annex-config.1.html">git-annex-config</a>(1), etc.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       You have a big git-annex repository and are  splitting  the  directory  "foo"  out,  to  make  a  smaller
       repository. You want the smaller repo's git-annex branch to contain all the information about remotes and
       other configuration, but only information about keys in that directory.

        git-annex filter-branch foo --include-all-key-information \
             --include-all-repo-config --include-global-config

       That only includes information about the keys that are currently in the directory "foo", not keys used by
       old versions of files.  To also include information about the version of the subdir in tag "1.0", add the
       option <b>--branch=1.0:foo</b>

       Your  repository  has a special remote "bar", and you want to share information about which annexed files
       are stored in it, but without sharing anything about the configuration of the remote.

        git-annex filter-branch --all --include-all-key-information \
             --include-all-repo-config --exclude-repo-config-for=bar \
             --include-global-config
