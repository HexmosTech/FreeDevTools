</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-debpush - create &amp; push a git tag with metadata for an ftp-master upload

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>git</b> <b>debpush</b> [<u>option</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>git-debpush</b> is a wrapper around <b><a href="../man1/git-tag.1.html">git-tag</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/git-push.1.html">git-push</a></b>(1).  It helps you create and push a specially
       formatted signed tag which indicates that the tagged commit should be pushed (or "uploaded") to a Debian-
       style archive.

       Typically, your git server will be configured to notify an intermediary service of the new tag that you
       pushed.  That service will then fetch your tag, check your PGP signature, do any conversion that's needed
       (such as producing and signing a <b>.dsc</b> and <b>.changes</b>), and upload the result to the Debian-style archive.

       <b>git-debpush</b> is only for source-only uploads.

</pre><h4><b>TYPICAL</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>git-debpush</b> is designed such that for regular uploads of your package, you should be able to just invoke
       it without passing any command line arguments.  After you've built and tested some .debs, run <b><a href="../man1/dch.1.html">dch</a></b>(1) to
       finalise your changelog and committed the result, just type "git debpush", and the intermediary service
       and your distribution's autobuilder network will take care of the rest.

       The most common exception to this is the first time you use <b>git-debpush</b> for a non-native package.  You
       will need to pass a quilt mode option to inform the intermediary service which git branch format you are
       using, for example

           % git debpush --gbp

       if you are using the git branch format typically used with <b><a href="../man1/gbp.1.html">gbp</a></b>(1).  See "QUILT MODE OPTIONS", below, for
       the available quilt mode options.

       Aside from a few sanity checks to help avoid broken uploads, <b>git-debpush</b> does not do anything with the
       information provided by the quilt mode option.  It simply embeds the corresponding quilt mode in its
       generated tag, for use by the intermediary service.

       Future invocations of <b>git-debpush</b> will try to read the quilt mode out of the tag generated by <b>git-debpush</b>
       for your previous upload.  You can override that on the command line by passing a quilt mode option,
       which always takes precedence.

</pre><h4><b>SETUP</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>SOURCE</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>1.0</b></h4><pre>
       <b>git-debpush</b> needs to tell the intermediary git service whether this is a native or non-native package.
       Given historical Debian practices, it is not sufficient for either <b>git-debpush</b> or the intermediary
       service to rely on the version number in debian/changelog.

       If you are using one of the 3.0 source package formats, <b>git-debpush</b> will just look in
       debian/source/format to determine whether the package is native or non-native, and you can ignore this
       section of the manpage.

       If you are using the 1.0 source package format -- either debian/source/format does not exist, or contains
       the string "1.0" -- then <b>git-debpush</b> must be told whether the package is native or non-native.  We do
       this using debian/source/options.  If your package is non-native, execute

           % echo "-sk" &gt;&gt;debian/source/options

       If your package is native, execute

           % echo "-sn" &gt;&gt;debian/source/options

       (With source format 1.0, <b><a href="../man1/dpkg-source.1.html">dpkg-source</a></b>(1) decides whether the package is native or non-native based on the
       presence of absence of an orig.tar in <b>..</b>, but <b>git-debpush</b> is a pure git tool that never looks at
       tarballs.)

</pre><h4><b>QUILT</b> <b>MODE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--quilt=gbp</b>|<b>--gbp</b>
           You are using the 'unapplied' branch format, typically used with <b><a href="../man1/gbp.1.html">gbp</a></b>(1).

       <b>--quilt=dpm</b>|<b>--dpm</b>
           You are using <b><a href="../man1/git-dpm.1.html">git-dpm</a></b>(1)'s branch format.

       <b>--quilt=baredebian[+git]</b>|<b>--baredebian[+git]</b>
           You  are  using  the 'bare debian' branch format, with the upstream source in the form of an upstream
           tag.

           <b>--quilt=baredebian+git</b> is an alias for <b>--quilt=baredebian</b>.

       <b>--quilt=linear</b>
           You are using the 'manually maintained applied' branch format or similar, and  each  commit  touching
           the upstream source not already represented in debian/patches should be added as a new patch.

       <b>--quilt=smash</b>
           You are using the 'manually maintained applied' branch format or similar, and you want all changes to
           the upstream source to be squashed into a single patch in debian/patches.

       <b>--quilt=auto</b>
           Tell  the  intermediary  service  to  try  <b>--quilt=linear</b>,  and  if that cannot succeed, fall back to
           <b>--quilt=smash</b>.

       <b>--quilt=nofix</b>
           You are using the 'manually maintained  applied'  branch  format  or  similar,  and  you  don't  want
           debian/patches to be touched by the intermediary service.

           If  all  commits  touching  the  upstream  source  are not already represented in debian/patches, the
           intermediary service will fail to upload your package.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--dry-run</b>|<b>-n</b>
           Run checks and generate the tag text, but don't sign or create the tag, or push.

       <b>--tag-only</b>|<b>-t</b>
           Just tag, don't push.  A noop if passed together with <b>--dry-run</b>|<b>-n</b>.

       <b>--print-tag-text</b>
           Also print the (unsigned) tag text to standard output.

           Useful together with <b>--dry-run</b>|<b>-n</b>, for scripting.

       <b>-u</b> <u>keyid</u>
           Passed on to <b><a href="../man1/git-tag.1.html">git-tag</a></b>(1).

       <b>--branch=</b><u>BRANCH</u>
           Where to place the tag, i.e., what you want to release.  If unspecified, we put the tag  on  whatever
           HEAD points to.

           Note  that  this  need not actually be a branch, but any committish (see <b><a href="../man7/gitglossary.7.html">gitglossary</a></b>(7)).  The option
           name is chosen to fit what is by far the most common case.

       <b>--upstream=</b><u>TAG</u>
           When pushing a non-native package, <b>git-debpush</b> needs a tag for the upstream part of your package.

           By default <b>git-debpush</b> asks <b><a href="../man1/git-deborig.1.html">git-deborig</a></b>(1), which searches for a suitable tag based on  the  upstream
           version in debian/changelog.

       <b>--remote=</b><u>REMOTE</u>
           Where  to  push  tags  and branches.  If unspecified, use the remote which git would use if you typed
           "git push BRANCH".

       <b>--distro=</b><u>DISTRO</u>
           What distribution name to embed in the signed tag.  Defaults to "debian".

       <b>--force</b>|<b>-f</b>
           Ignore the results of all checks designed to prevent broken uploads.

       <b>--force</b>=<u>check</u>[,<u>check</u>] ...
           Override individual checks designed to prevent broken uploads.  May be specified more than once.

           Using <b>--force</b> or <b>--force=</b><u>check</u> might cause the upload to fail at some later point in the process.

           Valid values for <u>check</u> are:

           <b>changed-suite</b>
               Permit uploading to a different suite than the target of the most recent upload  made  with  <b>git-</b>
               <b>debpush</b> (e.g. when uploading to Debian unstable after uploading to Debian experimental).

           <b>upstream-nonancestor</b>
               Ignore  the  fact  that  the upstream tag is not an ancestor of the branch to be tagged (skipping
               this check is implied by <b>--quilt=baredebian</b>).

           <b>upstream-nonidentical</b>
               Ignore any differences between the upstream source in the upstream tag and the upstream source in
               the branch to be tagged (this check is only run when using <b>--quilt=gbp</b> or <b>--quilt=unapplied</b>).

           <b>patches-nonapplicable</b>
               Ignore any failures of the following two checks:

               •   With <b>--quilt=gbp</b>, <b>--quilt=unapplied</b>, <b>--quilt=baredebian</b>, <b>--quilt=dpm</b>, and <b>--quilt=nofix</b>,  the
                   quilt patches should apply cleanly to the upstream source with <b><a href="../man1/git-apply.1.html">git-apply</a></b>(1).

               •   With  <b>--quilt=dpm</b> and <b>--quilt=nofix</b>, applying the quilt patches to the upstream source should
                   produce exactly the source tree to be tagged.

           <b>unreleased</b>
               Permit upload to a suite called UNRELEASED.

           <b>dgit-view</b>
               Ignore apparently pushing the dgit view  of  a  package  (as  produced  by  <b>dgit</b>  <b>clone</b>)  to  the
               maintainer branch, where the dgit view and the maintainer view of the package are not identical.

           <b>unstitched</b>
               Ignore  the  fact  that  the  branch  to  be  pushed  seems to be a <b><a href="../man1/git-debrebase.1.html">git-debrebase</a></b>(1) branch in an
               unstitched state (see <b><a href="../man5/git-debrebase.5.html">git-debrebase</a></b>(5)).

       <b>detached</b>
           Ignore the fact that HEAD is to be tagged, but  HEAD  is  detached  (this  check  is  only  run  when
           <b>--branch=HEAD</b> or no <b>--branch</b> option is specified).
