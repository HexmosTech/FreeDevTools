</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-debimport - create a git repository from a set of existing Debian packages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>git-debimport</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>path-prefix</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  will  create  a  git  repository  of  all  files  that  match  ${path-prefix}_*.diff.gz or
       ${path-prefix}_*.debian.tar.{gz,bz2,xz} (with their corresponding orig.tar.{gz,bz2,xz}), or of all  files
       that match ${path-prefix}_*.tar.{gz,bz2,xz} (for Debian native packages).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are available:

       <b>--fetch</b>
              Attempt  to  download  all available versions from snapshot.debian.org rather than use an existing
              set of packages.  The <b><a href="../man1/debsnap.1.html">debsnap</a></b>(1) utility, from devscripts 2.10.63 or later, must be  available  in
              the  path to use this option (earlier <b>debsnap</b> versions only supported snapshot.debian.net which is
              no longer a functional mirror).  The packages will be downloaded into the location implied by  the
              <u>path-prefix</u>  where  they  would  normally  be  expected  to  exist  already  without  this option.
              Downloaded packages will not automatically be removed after this operation is complete.

       <b>--late-merge</b>
              Early versions of <b>git-debimport</b> would only merge the upstream and debian branches after the import
              of all packages was complete.  This avoids an import failing where the merge might have  conflicts
              that  would  need  to  be manually resolved.  We know the import of the next package in the series
              will contain a resolution to any such conflict, so delaying the merge allows the import to proceed
              without intervention or introducing changes that were not part of the original history.   It  does
              however produce a lesser quality history for the purposes of browsing the Debian changes.  All the
              original  packages  may  be retrieved from such a repo with perfect fidelity, but the diff between
              adjacent Debian versions will be mingled with upstream changes too.

              The default for current versions of <b>git-debimport</b> is to merge each new upstream release as  it  is
              imported.   This gives a much more natural and useful looking history, but may fail in some cases.
              Use this option to employ the older more reliable method  for  packages  that  generate  conflicts
              during import.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Be  more noisy about reporting operations in progress.  Mostly only useful with the <b>--fetch</b> option
              at present.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Import an archive of existing 'mypackagename' packages from mysrcdir:
       $ mkdir mydestdir &amp;&amp; cd mydestdir
       $ git-debimport ../mysrcdir/mypackagename

       Import all available versions of <b>gitpkg</b> from snapshot.debian.org:
       $ mkdir mydestdir &amp;&amp; cd mydestdir
       $ git-debimport --fetch ../my-gitpkg-sources/gitpkg

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       It is unfortunate that at the present time, many of the  tools  for  importing  source  to  git  from  an
       existing  revision  control  system  all  leave something to be desired.  This script does not solve that
       problem.  What it does do however is create a repository that makes it possible to accurately extract all
       of the earlier packages which were injected to it.  This is sadly more than can be said for the result of
       running git-cvsimport on a repo created by cvs-buildpackage, for example.

       It is currently very simple, and makes a number of hard-coded assumptions about the resulting repo.   For
       debian-versioned packages it will create a repo with two branches:

       <b>upstream</b> - for the pristine upstream source
       <b>master</b> - for the Debianised source

       Native versioned packages will have only the master branch.

       While  the  loss of fine grained history on individual commits is most regrettable, this script enables a
       maintainer to import a  usable  record  of  the  previously  released  packages  as  a  base  for  future
       development.   This  may  be  an  acceptable trade-off for people who feel the advantage of moving future
       development to git now outweighs the inconvenience of needing to refer to a legacy  repository  for  full
       details of previous commits.

       Hopefully  the  problems  of  accurately importing from other revision control systems will be solved one
       day, but in the meantime, a brief but accurate history seems more useful  than  a  detailed  but  largely
       bogus one.

       With the addition of the <b><a href="../man1/debsnap.1.html">debsnap</a></b>(1) tool, the useful life of this has been extended beyond the originally
       envisaged  need.  People who do not have access to the original revision control history at all can build
       for themselves a useful base for further development, quickly and easily,  from  the  packages  that  are
       still available on public snapshot mirrors.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>git-debimport</b> does not currently handle packages with mixed 'native' and debian-versioned releases.  This
       may be added in a later version if people have real examples of such packages they wish to import with it
       and we figure out a sensible convention for how they should be stored in the resulting repository.

       Nothing  particularly intelligent is done with format 3.0 (quilt) patches currently.  The debian/patches,
       if any, are simply imported verbatim as found in the source package.  Ideally they should be committed to
       some git branch and generated on demand at export  time,  rather  than  perpetuating  the  patch-in-patch
       nightmare.   Any  packages  so imported will be recreated accurately on export, but this isn't really the
       best form to actually work with them in git in most cases.
