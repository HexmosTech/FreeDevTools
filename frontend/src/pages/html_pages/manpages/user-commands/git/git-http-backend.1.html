</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-http-backend - Server side implementation of Git over HTTP

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git</u> <u>http-backend</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A simple CGI program to serve the contents of a Git repository to Git clients accessing the repository
       over http:// and https:// protocols. The program supports clients fetching using both the smart HTTP
       protocol and the backwards-compatible dumb HTTP protocol, as well as clients pushing using the smart HTTP
       protocol. It also supports Git’s more-efficient "v2" protocol if properly configured; see the discussion
       of <b>GIT_PROTOCOL</b> in the ENVIRONMENT section below.

       It verifies that the directory has the magic file "git-daemon-export-ok", and it will refuse to export
       any Git directory that hasn’t explicitly been marked for export this way (unless the <b>GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL</b>
       environment variable is set).

       By default, only the <b>upload-pack</b> service is enabled, which serves <u>git</u> <u>fetch-pack</u> and <u>git</u> <u>ls-remote</u>
       clients, which are invoked from <u>git</u> <u>fetch</u>, <u>git</u> <u>pull</u>, and <u>git</u> <u>clone</u>. If the client is authenticated, the
       <b>receive-pack</b> service is enabled, which serves <u>git</u> <u>send-pack</u> clients, which is invoked from <u>git</u> <u>push</u>.

</pre><h4><b>SERVICES</b></h4><pre>
       These services can be enabled/disabled using the per-repository configuration file:

       http.getanyfile
           This serves Git clients older than version 1.6.6 that are unable to use the upload pack service. When
           enabled, clients are able to read any file within the repository, including objects that are no
           longer reachable from a branch but are still present. It is enabled by default, but a repository can
           disable it by setting this configuration value to <b>false</b>.

       http.uploadpack
           This serves <u>git</u> <u>fetch-pack</u> and <u>git</u> <u>ls-remote</u> clients. It is enabled by default, but a repository can
           disable it by setting this configuration value to <b>false</b>.

       http.receivepack
           This serves <u>git</u> <u>send-pack</u> clients, allowing push. It is disabled by default for anonymous users, and
           enabled by default for users authenticated by the web server. It can be disabled by setting this item
           to <b>false</b>, or enabled for all users, including anonymous users, by setting it to <b>true</b>.

</pre><h4><b>URL</b> <b>TRANSLATION</b></h4><pre>
       To determine the location of the repository on disk, <u>git</u> <u>http-backend</u> concatenates the environment
       variables PATH_INFO, which is set automatically by the web server, and GIT_PROJECT_ROOT, which must be
       set manually in the web server configuration. If GIT_PROJECT_ROOT is not set, <u>git</u> <u>http-backend</u> reads
       PATH_TRANSLATED, which is also set automatically by the web server.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       All of the following examples map <b>http://$hostname/git/foo/bar.git</b> to <b>/var/www/git/foo/bar.git</b>.

       Apache 2.x
           Ensure mod_cgi, mod_alias, and mod_env are enabled, set GIT_PROJECT_ROOT (or DocumentRoot)
           appropriately, and create a ScriptAlias to the CGI:

               SetEnv GIT_PROJECT_ROOT /var/www/git
               SetEnv GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL
               ScriptAlias /git/ /usr/libexec/git-core/git-http-backend/

               # This is not strictly necessary using Apache and a modern version of
               # git-http-backend, as the webserver will pass along the header in the
               # environment as HTTP_GIT_PROTOCOL, and http-backend will copy that into
               # GIT_PROTOCOL. But you may need this line (or something similar if you
               # are using a different webserver), or if you want to support older Git
               # versions that did not do that copying.
               #
               # Having the webserver set up GIT_PROTOCOL is perfectly fine even with
               # modern versions (and will take precedence over HTTP_GIT_PROTOCOL,
               # which means it can be used to override the client's request).
               SetEnvIf Git-Protocol ".*" GIT_PROTOCOL=$0

           To enable anonymous read access but authenticated write access, require authorization for both the
           initial ref advertisement (which we detect as a push via the service parameter in the query string),
           and the receive-pack invocation itself:

               RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} service=git-receive-pack [OR]
               RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} /git-receive-pack$
               RewriteRule ^/git/ - [E=AUTHREQUIRED:yes]

               &lt;LocationMatch "^/git/"&gt;
                       Order Deny,Allow
                       Deny from env=AUTHREQUIRED

                       AuthType Basic
                       AuthName "Git Access"
                       Require group committers
                       Satisfy Any
                       ...
               &lt;/LocationMatch&gt;

           If you do not have <b>mod_rewrite</b> available to match against the query string, it is sufficient to just
           protect <b>git-receive-pack</b> itself, like:

               &lt;LocationMatch "^/git/.*/git-receive-pack$"&gt;
                       AuthType Basic
                       AuthName "Git Access"
                       Require group committers
                       ...
               &lt;/LocationMatch&gt;

           In this mode, the server will not request authentication until the client actually starts the object
           negotiation phase of the push, rather than during the initial contact. For this reason, you must also
           enable the <b>http.receivepack</b> config option in any repositories that should accept a push. The default
           behavior, if <b>http.receivepack</b> is not set, is to reject any pushes by unauthenticated users; the
           initial request will therefore report <b>403</b> <b>Forbidden</b> to the client, without even giving an opportunity
           for authentication.

           To require authentication for both reads and writes, use a Location directive around the repository,
           or one of its parent directories:

               &lt;Location /git/private&gt;
                       AuthType Basic
                       AuthName "Private Git Access"
                       Require group committers
                       ...
               &lt;/Location&gt;

           To serve gitweb at the same url, use a ScriptAliasMatch to only those URLs that <u>git</u> <u>http-backend</u> can
           handle, and forward the rest to gitweb:

               ScriptAliasMatch \
                       "(?x)^/git/(.*/(HEAD | \
                                       info/refs | \
                                       objects/(info/[^/]+ | \
                                                [0-9a-f]{2}/[0-9a-f]{38} | \
                                                pack/pack-[0-9a-f]{40}\.(pack|idx)) | \
                                       git-(upload|receive)-pack))$" \
                       /usr/libexec/git-core/git-http-backend/$1

               ScriptAlias /git/ /var/www/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi/

           To serve multiple repositories from different <b><a href="../man7/gitnamespaces.7.html">gitnamespaces</a></b>(7) in a single repository:

               SetEnvIf Request_URI "^/git/([^/]*)" GIT_NAMESPACE=$1
               ScriptAliasMatch ^/git/[^/]*(.*) /usr/libexec/git-core/git-http-backend/storage.git$1

       Accelerated static Apache 2.x
           Similar to the above, but Apache can be used to return static files that are stored on disk. On many
           systems this may be more efficient as Apache can ask the kernel to copy the file contents from the
           file system directly to the network:

               SetEnv GIT_PROJECT_ROOT /var/www/git

               AliasMatch ^/git/(.*/objects/[0-9a-f]{2}/[0-9a-f]{38})$          /var/www/git/$1
               AliasMatch ^/git/(.*/objects/pack/pack-[0-9a-f]{40}.(pack|idx))$ /var/www/git/$1
               ScriptAlias /git/ /usr/libexec/git-core/git-http-backend/

           This can be combined with the gitweb configuration:

               SetEnv GIT_PROJECT_ROOT /var/www/git

               AliasMatch ^/git/(.*/objects/[0-9a-f]{2}/[0-9a-f]{38})$          /var/www/git/$1
               AliasMatch ^/git/(.*/objects/pack/pack-[0-9a-f]{40}.(pack|idx))$ /var/www/git/$1
               ScriptAliasMatch \
                       "(?x)^/git/(.*/(HEAD | \
                                       info/refs | \
                                       objects/info/[^/]+ | \
                                       git-(upload|receive)-pack))$" \
                       /usr/libexec/git-core/git-http-backend/$1
               ScriptAlias /git/ /var/www/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi/

       Lighttpd
           Ensure that <b>mod_cgi</b>, <b>mod_alias</b>, <b>mod_auth</b>, <b>mod_setenv</b> are loaded, then set <b>GIT_PROJECT_ROOT</b>
           appropriately and redirect all requests to the CGI:

               alias.url += ( "/git" =&gt; "<a href="file:/usr/lib/git-core/git-http-backend">/usr/lib/git-core/git-http-backend</a>" )
               $HTTP["url"] =~ "^/git" {
                       cgi.assign = ("" =&gt; "")
                       setenv.add-environment = (
                               "GIT_PROJECT_ROOT" =&gt; "/var/www/git",
                               "GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL" =&gt; ""
                       )
               }

           To enable anonymous read access but authenticated write access:

               $HTTP["querystring"] =~ "service=git-receive-pack" {
                       include "git-auth.conf"
               }
               $HTTP["url"] =~ "^/git/.*/git-receive-pack$" {
                       include "git-auth.conf"
               }

           where <b>git-auth.conf</b> looks something like:

               auth.require = (
                       "/" =&gt; (
                               "method" =&gt; "basic",
                               "realm" =&gt; "Git Access",
                               "require" =&gt; "valid-user"
                              )
               )
               # ...and set up auth.backend here

           To require authentication for both reads and writes:

               $HTTP["url"] =~ "^/git/private" {
                       include "git-auth.conf"
               }

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git</u> <u>http-backend</u> relies upon the <b>CGI</b> environment variables set by the invoking web server, including:

       •   PATH_INFO (if GIT_PROJECT_ROOT is set, otherwise PATH_TRANSLATED)

       •   REMOTE_USER

       •   REMOTE_ADDR

       •   CONTENT_TYPE

       •   QUERY_STRING

       •   REQUEST_METHOD

       The <b>GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL</b> environment variable may be passed to <u>git-http-backend</u> to bypass the check for
       the "git-daemon-export-ok" file in each repository before allowing export of that repository.

       The <b>GIT_HTTP_MAX_REQUEST_BUFFER</b> environment variable (or the <b>http.maxRequestBuffer</b> config option) may be
       set to change the largest ref negotiation request that git will handle during a fetch; any fetch
       requiring a larger buffer will not succeed. This value should not normally need to be changed, but may be
       helpful if you are fetching from a repository with an extremely large number of refs. The value can be
       specified with a unit (e.g., <b>100M</b> for 100 megabytes). The default is 10 megabytes.

       Clients may probe for optional protocol capabilities (like the v2 protocol) using the <b>Git-Protocol</b> HTTP
       header. In order to support these, the contents of that header must appear in the <b>GIT_PROTOCOL</b>
       environment variable. Most webservers will pass this header to the CGI via the <b>HTTP_GIT_PROTOCOL</b>
       variable, and <b>git-http-backend</b> will automatically copy that to <b>GIT_PROTOCOL</b>. However, some webservers may
       be more selective about which headers they’ll pass, in which case they need to be configured explicitly
       (see the mention of <b>Git-Protocol</b> in the Apache config from the earlier EXAMPLES section).

       The backend process sets GIT_COMMITTER_NAME to <u>$REMOTE_USER</u> and GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL to
       <u>${REMOTE_USER}@http.${REMOTE_ADDR}</u>, ensuring that any reflogs created by <u>git-receive-pack</u> contain some
       identifying information of the remote user who performed the push.

       All <b>CGI</b> environment variables are available to each of the hooks invoked by the <u>git-receive-pack</u>.
