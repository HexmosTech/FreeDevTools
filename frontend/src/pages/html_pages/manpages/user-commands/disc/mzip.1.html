       mzip - change protection mode and eject disk on Zip/Jaz drive

</pre><h4><b>Note</b> <b>of</b> <b>warning</b></h4><pre>
       This  manpage  has  been  automatically  generated  from  mtools's  texinfo documentation, and may not be
       entirely accurate or complete.  See the end of this man page for details.

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       The mzip command is used to issue ZIP disk specific commands on Linux, Solaris or HP-UX. Its syntax is:

       mzip [-epqrwx]

       Mzip allows the following command line options:

       e      Ejects the disk.

       f      Force eject even if the disk is mounted (must be given in addition to -e).

       r      Write protect the disk.

       w      Remove write protection.

       p      Password write protect.

       x      Password protect

       u      Temporarily unprotect the disk until it is ejected.  The disk becomes writable, and  reverts  back
              to its old state when ejected.

       q      Queries the status

       To remove the password, set it to one of the password-less modes -r or -w: mzip will then ask you for the
       password,  and  unlock  the disk.  If you have forgotten the password, you can get rid of it by low-level
       formatting the disk (using your SCSI adapter's BIOS setup).

       The ZipTools disk shipped with the drive is also password  protected.   On  MS-DOS  or  on  a  Mac,  this
       password is automatically removed once the ZipTools have been installed.  From various articles posted to
       Usenet,  I  learned  that  the  password for the tools disk is APlaceForYourStuff.  Mzip knows about this
       password, and tries it first, before prompting you for a password.  Thus mzip -w  z:  unlocks  the  tools
       disk.   The  tools disk is formatted in a special way so as to be usable both in a PC and in a Mac.  On a
       PC, the Mac file system appears as a hidden file named `partishn.mac'.  You may erase it to  reclaim  the
       50 Megs of space taken up by the Mac file system.

</pre><h4><b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       This  command  is  a  big  kludge.   A  proper implementation would take a rework of significant parts of
       mtools, but unfortunately I don't  have  the  time  for  this  right  now.  The  main  downside  of  this
       implementation is that it is inefficient on some architectures (several successive calls to mtools, which
       defeats mtools' caching).

       Mtools' texinfo doc

</pre><h4><b>Viewing</b> <b>the</b> <b>texi</b> <b>doc</b></h4><pre>
       This  manpage has been automatically generated from mtools's texinfo documentation. However, this process
       is only approximative, and some items, such as crossreferences, footnotes and indices are  lost  in  this
       translation  process.   Indeed,  these  items  have  no appropriate representation in the manpage format.
       Moreover, not all information has been translated into the manpage version.  Thus I strongly  advise  you
       to  use  the  original texinfo doc.  See the end of this manpage for instructions how to view the texinfo
       doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the following commands:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>dvi;</b> <b>dvips</b> <b>mtools.dvi</b>

       *      To generate a html copy,  run:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>html</b>

       A premade html can be found at `<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/manual/mtools.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/mtools/manual/mtools.html</a>'

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs' info mode), run:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>info</b>

       The texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in the info version certain  examples
       are difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.
