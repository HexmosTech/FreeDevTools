       diskd - disk daemon; wait for disk to be inserted

</pre><h4><b>Note</b></h4><pre>
       This  manpage  has  been  automatically  generated  from  fdutils's texinfo documentation.  However, this
       process is only approximative, and some items, such as cross-references, footnotes and indices  are  lost
       in  this  translation  process.   Indeed,  these  items have no appropriate representation in the manpage
       format.  Moreover, only the items specific  to  each  command  have  been  translated,  and  the  general
       information about fdutils has been dropped in the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the
       original texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the following commands:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>dvi;</b> <b>dvips</b> <b>fdutils.dvi</b>

       *      To generate a HTML copy,  run:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>html</b>

              A pre-made HTML can be found at: `<a href="http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/fdutils">http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/fdutils</a>'

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs' info mode), run:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>info</b>

       The  texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as HTML.  Indeed, in the info version certain examples
       are difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       The diskd command has the following syntax:

          diskd [-d <u>drive</u>] [-i <u>interval</u>] [-e <u>command</u>]

       Diskd waits for a disk to be inserted into a given <u>drive</u>, and then either executes the <u>command</u> or  exits.
       This program can be used to automatically mount a disk as soon as it is inserted.

</pre><h4><b>Warning</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  works  by  switching the motor on for a very short interval, and then seeking to track -1.
       This might damage hardware in the long run. Amigas, which also use these techniques, are known for having
       problems with their disk drives no longer spinning up properly after a few month of usage.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       -d <u>drive</u>
              Selects the drive to observe for disk insertion. By default, drive 0 (/dev/fd0) is observed.

       -i <u>interval</u>
              Selects the polling interval. The interval is given in tenths  of  seconds.  Default  is  10  (one
              second).

       -e <u>command</u>
              Gives  the  command  to  be  executed  when a disk is inserted. If no command is given the program
              simply exits. Typically, the command mounts the disk. It can be a shell scripts which  probes  for
              several filesystems and disk geometries until it succeeds.

</pre><h4><b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       *      Automatic  unmounting  cannot  yet  be  handled. It is indeed not enough to scan for disk removal,
              because when the disk is removed, it is already too late: There  might  be  some  buffers  needing
              flushing.   However,  the  fdmountd  program  allows  automatic unmounting by using the SYNC mount
              options, which switches off write buffering (see section  fdmount).

       *      The drive motor is running all the time, and on some computers, the drive  led  flickers  at  each
              time the drive is polled.
