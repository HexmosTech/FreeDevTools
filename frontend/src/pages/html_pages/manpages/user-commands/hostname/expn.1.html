</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       expn - recursively expand mail aliases

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>expn</b> [<u>-a</u>] [<u>-v</u>] [<u>-w</u>] [<u>-d</u>] [<u>-1</u>] <u>user</u>[@<u>hostname</u>] [<u>user</u>[@<u>hostname</u>]]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>expn</b>  will  use  the  SMTP  <b>expn</b>  and  <b>vrfy</b>  commands  to expand mail aliases.  It will first look up the
       addresses you provide on the command line.  If those expand into addresses  on  other  systems,  it  will
       connect  to  the  other  systems and expand again.  It will keep doing this until no further expansion is
       possible.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The default output of <b>expn</b> can contain many lines which are not valid  email  addresses.   With  the  <u>-aa</u>
       flag,  only expansions that result in legal addresses are used.  Since many mailing lists have an illegal
       address or two, the single <u>-a</u>, address, flag specifies that a few illegal addresses can be mixed into the
       results.   More <u>-a</u> flags vary the ratio.  Read the source to track down the formula.  With the <u>-a</u> option,
       you should be able to construct a new mailing list out of an existing one.

       If you wish to limit the number of levels deep that <b>expn</b> will recurse as it traces addresses, use the  <u>-1</u>
       option.   For  each <u>-1</u> another level will be traversed.  So, <u>-111</u> will traverse no more than three levels
       deep.

       The normal mode of operation for <b>expn</b> is to do all of its work silently.  The following options  make  it
       more  verbose.   It  is  not necessary to make it verbose to see what it is doing because as it works, it
       changes its <b>argv</b>[0] variable to reflect its current activity.  To see how it is expanding things, the <u>-v</u>,
       verbose, flag will cause <b>expn</b> to show each address before and after translation as  it  works.   The  <u>-w</u>,
       watch, flag will cause <b>expn</b> to show you its conversations with the mail daemons.  Finally, the <u>-d</u>, debug,
       flag will expose many of the inner workings so that it is possible to eliminate bugs.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       No environment variables are used.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/tmp/expn$$</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>file</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>input</b> <b>to</b> <b>nslookup</b>.
</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man5/aliases.5.html">aliases</a></b>(5), <b><a href="../man8/sendmail.8.html">sendmail</a></b>(8), <b><a href="../man8/nslookup.8.html">nslookup</a></b>(8), RFC 823, and RFC 1123.
</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Not all mail daemons will implement <b>expn</b> or <b>vrfy</b>.  It is not possible to verify addresses that are served
       by such daemons.
       When  attempting  to connect to a system to verify an address, <b>expn</b> only tries one IP address.  Most mail
       daemons will try harder.
       It is assumed that you are running domain names and that the <b><a href="../man8/nslookup.8.html">nslookup</a></b>(8) program is available.   If  not,
       <b>expn</b> will not be able to verify many addresses.  It will also pause for a long time unless you change the
       code where it says <u>$have_nslookup</u> <u>=</u> <u>1</u> to read <u>$have_nslookup</u> <u>=</u> <u>0</u>.
       Lastly, <b>expn</b> does not handle every valid address.  If you have an example, please submit a bug report.
</pre><h4><b>CREDITS</b></h4><pre>
       In  1986  or so, Jon Broome wrote a program of the same name that did about the same thing.  It has since
       suffered bit rot and Jon Broome has dropped off the face of the earth!  (Jon, if you are out there,  drop
       me a line)
</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
