</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       hostnamectl - Control the system hostname

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>hostnamectl</b> [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hostnamectl</b> may be used to query and change the system hostname and related settings.

       <b><a href="../man8/systemd-hostnamed.service.8.html">systemd-hostnamed.service</a></b>(8) and this tool distinguish three different hostnames: the high-level "pretty"
       hostname which might include all kinds of special characters (e.g. "Lennart's Laptop"), the "static"
       hostname which is the user-configured hostname (e.g. "lennarts-laptop"), and the transient hostname which
       is a fallback value received from network configuration (e.g. "node12345678"). If a static hostname is
       set to a valid value, then the transient hostname is not used.

       Note that the pretty hostname has little restrictions on the characters and length used, while the static
       and transient hostnames are limited to the usually accepted characters of Internet domain names, and 64
       characters at maximum (the latter being a Linux limitation).

       Use <b><a href="../man1/systemd-firstboot.1.html">systemd-firstboot</a></b>(1) to initialize the system hostname for mounted (but not booted) system images.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following commands are understood:

       <b>status</b>
           Show system hostname and related information. If no command is specified, this is the implied
           default.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>hostname</b> [<u>NAME</u>]
           If no argument is given, print the system hostname. If an optional argument <u>NAME</u> is provided then the
           command changes the system hostname to <u>NAME</u>. By default, this will alter the pretty, the static, and
           the transient hostname alike; however, if one or more of <b>--static</b>, <b>--transient</b>, <b>--pretty</b> are used,
           only the selected hostnames are changed. If the pretty hostname is being set, and static or transient
           are being set as well, the specified hostname will be simplified in regards to the character set used
           before the latter are updated. This is done by removing special characters and spaces. This ensures
           that the pretty and the static hostname are always closely related while still following the validity
           rules of the specific name. This simplification of the hostname string is not done if only the
           transient and/or static hostnames are set, and the pretty hostname is left untouched.

           The static and transient hostnames must each be either a single DNS label (a string composed of 7-bit
           ASCII lower-case characters and no spaces or dots, limited to the format allowed for DNS domain name
           labels), or a sequence of such labels separated by single dots that forms a valid DNS FQDN. The
           hostname must be at most 64 characters, which is a Linux limitation (DNS allows longer names).

           Added in version 249.

       <b>icon-name</b> [<u>NAME</u>]
           If no argument is given, print the icon name of the system. If an optional argument <u>NAME</u> is provided
           then the command changes the icon name to <u>NAME</u>. The icon name is used by some graphical applications
           to visualize this host. The icon name should follow the <b>Icon</b> <b>Naming</b> <b>Specification</b>[1].

           Added in version 249.

       <b>chassis</b> [<u>TYPE</u>]
           If no argument is given, print the chassis type. If an optional argument <u>TYPE</u> is provided then the
           command changes the chassis type to <u>TYPE</u>. The chassis type is used by some graphical applications to
           visualize the host or alter user interaction. Currently, the following chassis types are defined:
           "desktop", "laptop", "convertible", "server", "tablet", "handset", "watch", "embedded", as well as
           the special chassis types "vm" and "container" for virtualized systems that lack an immediate
           physical chassis.

           Added in version 249.

       <b>deployment</b> [<u>ENVIRONMENT</u>]
           If no argument is given, print the deployment environment. If an optional argument <u>ENVIRONMENT</u> is
           provided then the command changes the deployment environment to <u>ENVIRONMENT</u>. Argument <u>ENVIRONMENT</u>
           must be a single word without any control characters. One of the following is suggested:
           "development", "integration", "staging", "production".

           Added in version 249.

       <b>location</b> [<u>LOCATION</u>]
           If no argument is given, print the location string for the system. If an optional argument <u>LOCATION</u>
           is provided then the command changes the location string for the system to <u>LOCATION</u>. Argument
           <u>LOCATION</u> should be a human-friendly, free-form string describing the physical location of the system,
           if it is known and applicable. This may be as generic as "Berlin, Germany" or as specific as "Left
           Rack, 2nd Shelf".

           Added in version 249.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>--static</b>, <b>--transient</b>, <b>--pretty</b>
           If <b>status</b> is invoked (or no explicit command is given) and one of these switches is specified,
           <b>hostnamectl</b> will print out just this selected hostname.

           If used with <b>hostname</b>, only the selected hostnames will be updated. When more than one of these
           switches are specified, all the specified hostnames will be updated.

           Added in version 195.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--host=</b>
           Execute the operation remotely. Specify a hostname, or a username and hostname separated by "@", to
           connect to. The hostname may optionally be suffixed by a port ssh is listening on, separated by ":",
           and then a container name, separated by "/", which connects directly to a specific container on the
           specified host. This will use SSH to talk to the remote machine manager instance. Container names may
           be enumerated with <b>machinectl</b> <b>-H</b> <u>HOST</u>. Put IPv6 addresses in brackets.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--machine=</b>
           Execute operation on a local container. Specify a container name to connect to, optionally prefixed
           by a user name to connect as and a separating "@" character. If the special string ".host" is used in
           place of the container name, a connection to the local system is made (which is useful to connect to
           a specific user's user bus: "--user --machine=lennart@.host"). If the "@" syntax is not used, the
           connection is made as root user. If the "@" syntax is used either the left hand side or the right
           hand side may be omitted (but not both) in which case the local user name and ".host" are implied.

       <b>--no-ask-password</b>
           Do not query the user for authentication for privileged operations.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

       <b>--json=</b><u>MODE</u>
           Shows output formatted as JSON. Expects one of "short" (for the shortest possible output without any
           redundant whitespace or line breaks), "pretty" (for a pretty version of the same, with indentation
           and line breaks) or "off" (to turn off JSON output, the default).

       <b>-j</b>
           Equivalent to <b>--json=pretty</b> if running on a terminal, and <b>--json=short</b> otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.
