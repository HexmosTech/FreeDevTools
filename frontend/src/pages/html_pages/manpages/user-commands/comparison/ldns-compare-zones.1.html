</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ldns-compare-zones - read and compare two zonefiles and print differences

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ldns-compare-zones</b> <u>[-c]</u> <u>[-U]</u> <u>[-u]</u> <u>[-i]</u> <u>[-d]</u> <u>[-z]</u> <u>[-s]</u> <u>ZONEFILE1</u> <u>ZONEFILE2</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ldns-compare-zones</b> reads two DNS zone files and prints number of differences.
       Output is formatted to:
               +NUM_INS        -NUM_DEL        ~NUM_CHG

       Except with the <u>-U</u> or <u>-u</u> option.  Then the output is formatted to:
               +NUM_INS        -NUM_DEL        ~NUM_CHG        =NUM_EQ

       The  major  comparison  is based on the owner name. If an owner name is present in zonefile 1, but not in
       zonefile 2, the resource records with this owner name are considered deleted, and counted as NUM_DEL.  If
       an  owner name is present in zonefile 2, but not in zonefile 1, the resource records with this owner name
       are considered inserted, and counted as NUM_INS. If an owner name is present in  both,  but  there  is  a
       difference in the amount or content of the records, these are considered changed, and counted as NUM_CHG.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>     Print  resource  records  whose  owner  names  are in both zone files, but with different resource
              records. (a.k.a. changed)

       <b>-U</b>     From resource records whose owner names are in  both  zone  files,  but  with  different  resource
              records, print the unchanged records too (a.k.a. changed++).

       <b>-u</b>     Print  resource  records  whose owner names are in both zone files, and which resource records are
              the same. (a.k.a. unchanged)

       <b>-i</b>     Print resource records whose owner names are present only in ZONEFILE2 (a.k.a. inserted)

       <b>-d</b>     Print resource records whose owner names are present only in ZONEFILE1 (a.k.a. deleted)

       <b>-a</b>     Print all changes (except unchanged). Specifying this option is the same as specifying -c  -i  and
              -d.

       <b>-z</b>     Suppress  zone  sorting;  this  option  is not recommended; it can cause records to be incorrectly
              marked as changed, depending of the nature of the changes.

       <b>-s</b>     Do not exclude the SOA record from the comparison.  The SOA record may then show up as changed due
              to a new serial number.  Off by default since you may be interested to know if  (other  zone  apex
              elements) have changed.

       <b>-e</b>     Exit with status code 2 when zones differ.

       <b>-h</b>     Show usage and exit

       <b>-v</b>     Show the version and exit
