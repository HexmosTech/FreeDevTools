</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mdetect - mouse device autodetection tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       mdetect [<u>option</u> <u>...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       mdetect may be run without arguments.

       <b>-h</b>     display a help message and exit

       <b>-n</b>     do not search for PnP (Plug 'n' Play) mice

       <b>-r</b>     [not yet implemented]

       <b>-v</b>     be verbose; this option may be specified multiple times for increasing levels of verbosity

       <b>-o</b>     produce output appropriate for XFree86 3.x configuration

       <b>-x</b>     produce output appropriate for XFree86 4.x configuration

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mdetect</b>  is  a tool for autoconfiguring mice and compatible pointing devices; it is typically used as the
       backend to some user-friendly frontend code that, for example, asks the user to  move  the  mouse  for  a
       moment.   <b>mdetect</b>  is  then  run  while  user is producing input on the mouse device.  While mouse motion
       during detection is sometimes unnecessary, it is seldom problematic.

       <b>mdetect</b> writes the autodetected mouse device and protocol to standard output.  Unless either of the <b>-o</b> or
       <b>-x</b>  options  is  given,  <b>mdetect</b>  produces  output  appropriate  for  configuring  the  <b><a href="../man1/gpm.1.html">gpm</a></b>(1)   program.
       Alternatively,  output  appropriate  for  an  XFree86 X server configuration file is produced.  If the <b>-v</b>
       option is given, some information about the program's status is also written to standard output, but this
       is largely unimplemented at this writing.

       If <b>mdetect</b> is unable to find a mouse device, it exits after a few seconds of searching.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Detection of serial and PS/2 devices is often aided by moving the mouse while <b>mdetect</b> runs.

       Terminals connected to serial ports may display a small amount of garbage to  the  screen  while  <b>mdetect</b>
       probes  them,  but  this a harmless side-effect; the terminal's line settings are restored after the port
       has been probed.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mdetect</b>'s exit status is used to communicate information.

       0      <b>mdetect</b> found a mouse and exited normally.

       1      An error occurred while attempting to read from the mouse device.

       2      <b>mdetect</b> timed out and gave up searching for a mouse device; this indicates either  that  no  mouse
              device  is  attached  to  the  computer, or that a mouse device exists which <b>mdetect</b> knows nothing
              about.  This also happens if your only mouse device(s) are already open and in use; for  instance,
              by <b>gpm</b> or an X Window System server.

       3      An error occurred while trying to set up <b>mdetect</b>'s signal handler.

       <b>mdetect</b> is copyright 1999 Caldera Systems, Inc.  The actual authors are  unknown.   Branden  Robinson  of
       Progeny   Linux  Systems,  Inc.  and  the  Debian  Project  added  several  enhancements,  including  the
       XFree86-aware code and this manual page.  Richard Hirst wrote  code  to  save  and  restore  serial  port
       settings.
