</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       imwheel - a mouse wheel and button interpreter for X Windows

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>imwheel</b> [ <u>options</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>IMWheel</u>  is  a  universal mouse wheel and button translator for the X Windows System. Utilizing the input
       from X Windows, imwheel translates mouse wheel and mouse button actions into keyboard  events  using  the
       XTest extension to X. Use <u>xdpyinfo</u> for information on the supported extensions in your X server.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Available command line options are as follows:

       <b>-4,</b> <b>--flip-buttons</b>
              Flips  the mouse buttons so that 4 is 5 and 5 is 4, reversing the Up and Down actions.  This would
              make 4 buttons somewhat useful!  This is the similar to using '-b "5 4 6 7 8"'; see the <b>-b</b> option.
              See also <a href="../man1/xmodmap.1.html">xmodmap</a>(1).

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--buttons</b> <u>button-spec</u>
              Remap buttons in <u>button-spec</u> to interpreted wheel/button input.  Also limits the  button  grab  to
              the  specified buttons.  The <u>button-spec</u> must be surrounded by quotes.  Each button number must be
              separated by a space.  The <u>button-spec</u> is decoded in the following order for wheel input:

                     Index   Interpreted As    Button Number   Name in imwheelrc
                     1       Wheel Up          4               Up
                     2       Wheel Down        5               Down
                     3       Wheel Left        6               Left
                     4       Wheel Right       7               Right
                     5       Thumb Button 1    8               Thumb1
                     6       Thumb Button 2    9               Thumb2
                     7       Extra Button 1    10              ExtBt7
                     8       Extra Button 2    11              ExtBt8
                     etc.

              A <u>button-spec</u> of "4 5" will limit the grabbed buttons to only wheel up and down.
              A <u>button-spec</u> of "0" turns off any defined mapping, thus allowing for skips in the <u>button-spec</u> for
              something that doesn't exist on your mouse.
              A <u>button-spec</u> of "4 5 0 0 8" may be for normal  wheel  up/down  and  a  thumb  button  1,  but  no
              horizontal wheel axis.
              The  default <u>button-spec</u> is "4 5 6 7 8 9", but you may want or need to customize this yourself. If
              you want to ignore the mouse wheel on regular mice, make sure to start the <u>button-spec</u> with "0 0 0
              0 ...", thereby skipping over the vertical and horizontal axes of the wheel (whether  or  not  the
              horizontal axis exists or is used).
              See also <a href="../man1/xmodmap.1.html">xmodmap</a>(1).

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--config</b>
              Popup to configuration helper window immediately.
              See also <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>HELPER</b>

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--debug</b>
              Show  all possible debug info while running.  This spits out a lot and I also suggest using the <b>-d</b>
              option to prevent imwheel from detaching from the controlling terminal.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--detach</b>
              Actually this does the opposite of its name, it prevents detachment from the controlling  terminal
              (no daemon). Control-C stops, etc...

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--focus</b>
              Forces  the  X  event  subwindow  to  be  used instead of the original hack that would replace the
              subwindow in the X event with a  probed  focus  query  (XGetInputFocus).   This  should  fix  some
              compatibility problems with some window managers, such as window maker, and perhaps enlightenment.
              If nothing seems to be working right, try toggling this on or off...

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--focus-events</b>
              Disable the use of focus events for button grabs. If your <b>@Excluded</b> windows are not regrabbing the
              mouse buttons when exited, try toggling this on or off...

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Short help on options plus version/author info.

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--kill</b>
              Attempts  to  kill  old  imwheel.  Process IDs are tested using <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>${pid}/status Name: field ?=
              imwheel.  If <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> is not mounted then this fails every time!  Otherwise, this  ensures  that  the
              wrong process is not killed.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quit</b>
              Quit imwheel before entering event loop.
              Example: `imwheel -k -q' = kill and quit (option order doesn't matter)

       <b>-X,</b> <b>--display</b> <u>display</u>
              Use  XServer  at  a specified <u>display</u> in standard X form.  Using this option is usful for multiple
              displays.

</pre><h4><b>X</b> <b>WINDOWS</b></h4><pre>
       Use multiple imwheels by either setting the DISPLAY environment variable before running each imwheel,  or
       use  the  <b>-X</b>  or  <b>--display</b>  options  to  specify a different display for each imwheel.  Running multiple
       imwheels on the same display is not recommended, but is allowed, and may cause strange things  to  happen
       while using the wheel or buttons.

       Edit  your  xorg.conf,  and  ensure  that  in  the  "InputDevice"  section, your mouse Protocol is set to
       "ExplorerPS/2" for a modern PS/2 or USB mouse, or if not  then  "IMPS/2".  For  serial  mice  set  it  to
       "IntelliMouse"  or "Auto".  This is for IntelliMouse compatible mice; other protocols may be required for
       other mice.

       <b>NOTE</b>
       The <b>@Exclude</b> command must be used for clients that either use  the  ZAxis  for  themselves  and  have  no
       keyboard  translations to cause the same desired effect.  The <b>@Exclude</b> command must also be added for any
       client requiring mouse and/or mouse button grabs and that don't specify specific buttons to grab.   These
       clients  fail when they try to grab the mouse because the buttons 4 and 5 are already grabbed by imwheel.
       XV is an example of a client that requires these types of grabs to succeed.  KDE clients  use  the  ZAxis
       for  their own purposes.  The supplied imwheelrc includes an exclusion for XV already.  See the IMWheelRC
       section for more information.

</pre><h4><b>IMWHEELRC</b></h4><pre>
       IMWheel uses, optionally,  two  configuration  files.   One,  /etc/X11/imwheel/imwheelrc,  is  usable  by
       everybody.   The  other is $HOME/.imwheelrc, used only by one user.  One is supplied and should have been
       installed automatically in /etc/X11/imwheel.  All whitespace is ignored in the files  except  for  within
       the window names' double quotes.

       The configuration file consists of window names and event translations and/or imwheel commands that begin
       with  an `@' (at) symbol.  Each window name starts a section that is its configuration.  The window names
       are priortized as first come first served, so more generic matches  should  always  occur  later  in  the
       configuration file.

       Comments are started with a pound (#) and extend to the end of the line.

</pre><h4><b>IMWHEELRC</b> <b>WINDOW</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>HEADERS</b></h4><pre>
       Window name section headers are actually one of four things:

       Window Title
       Window Class Name
       Window Resource Name
       (null) which matches "\(null\)" in the imwheelrc

       Most  of  these  are  probeable using fvwm2's FvwmIdent module or the configurator (see the <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       <b>HELPER</b> section).  Other window managers may have their own method of identifying windows' attributes.
       Each window name is matched as a regex string.  Thus any window is matched using the regex  pattern  ".*"
       as  a  window  name.   This  pattern  should  be  the last section in your configuration file, or it will
       override the other window configurations in the file for matched wheel/button actions.
       There is one special header noted as "(null)" which matches windows that have a null string in the  three
       attributes.   This  makes it possible to assign actions to even Quake3, which has no info for its window.
       Just make sure that you realize that the keys used should not be keys that may conflict  with  other  key
       actions  in  the  game  or  application  you  are aiming to make work!  The included imwheelrc file has a
       "(null)" section included to demonstrate, and it should work with Quake3.
       Each window/class/resource name <u>must</u> be enclosed in double quotes (") on a line by itself.

       Inside each window section is any number  of  translation  definitions  or  commands.   Each  translation
       definition  or command must be on a line by itself.  The window section doesn't have to be terminated, as
       it is terminated by either starting another window section or the end of the configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>IMWHEELRC</b> <b>TRANSLATION</b> <b>DEFINITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Mouse wheel/button translations each take up a line after  a  window  section  has  been  started.   Each
       argument  is  separated  by  commas(,);  whitespace is ignored.  KeySyms are used to specify the keyboard
       input and outputs.  Pipes (|) are used to join multiple keys into one input/output.   The  format  is  as
       follows...

       <b>REQUIRED</b>
       The following arguments a required to make a minimum translation definition.

       <u>Key</u> <u>Modifiers</u> <u>Input</u>
              X KeySyms joined by pipes that indicate the required keys pressed when the mouse action is made in
              order  for this translation to be used.  Alt, Meta, Control, and Shift keys are typical modifiers,
              but  are  stated  slightly  different  than  just  `Shift'  but  rather  `Shift_L'  or  `Shift_R',
              differentiating between left and right shift keys.  See the KeySyms section for more.

              `<b>None</b>' is a special KeySym used by imwheel, it is used to indicate no modifiers.  A blank entry is
              also  acceptable  in  this case, but less descriptive of what is going on!  If `<b>None</b>' is used then
              there can be no modifiers in use during the wheel action.  If the field is blank then <u>any</u> modifier
              will match, so put these last in their window section.

       <u>Mouse</u> <u>Action</u> <u>Input</u>
              This is the input from the mouse wheel or button.  It is one of the following and <u>only</u> one:

              Up
              Down
              Left
              Right
              Thumb

              These are self explanatory.  If you have trouble use the configurator!

       <u>Key</u> <u>Action</u> <u>Output</u>
              Out KeySyms are placed here.  See KeySyms section for more on all available KeySyms.  Join KeySyms
              using pipes.  Output keys are pressed in order and released, in reverse order, only after all have
              been pressed, likely making them all combined as in `Control_L|C' which would be a `^C'  (control-
              c) keypress.

       <b>OPTIONAL</b>
       The following options are optional, but to use one you must fill in all the preceding arguments.

       <u>Output</u> <u>Repetitions</u>
              How many times should the Output KeySyms be pressed in a row.

              Default is 1.

       <u>Delay</u> <u>Before</u> <u>KeyUp</u> <u>Event</u>
              How long in microseconds until we release all the Output KeySyms in one Output Repetition.

              Default is 0.

       <u>Delay</u> <u>Before</u> <u>Next</u> <u>KeyPress</u> <u>Event</u>
              How  long  in microseconds until we press the next the Output KeySyms.  Ths delay occurs after the
              Output KeySyms are released.

              Default is 0.

</pre><h4><b>IMWHEELRC</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Commands start with the `@' character.  Commands are as follows:

       <b>@Exclude</b>
              Exclude this window from imwheel grabbing mouse events.  IMWheel will ungrab the mouse when  these
              windows  are  entered  and  not  regrab the mouse until focus is changed to a non-excluded window.
              This allows the ZAxis button events to pass through normally and mouse grabs to succeed.

       <b>@Priority</b>=<u>priority</u>
              Using this is  allowed  in  each  window/class/resource  section.   Higher  <u>priority</u>  values  take
              precedence  over lower ones.  Equal priorities on sections make the imwheelrc file parsed from top
              to bottom to find the first match.  Thus <b>@Priority</b> can be used to make the file search for matches
              out of order, then you don't have to keep the entries in order if you  so  please.   The  supplied
              imwheelrc file contains extensive comments and examples of the <b>@Priority</b> function.
              The  default <u>priority</u> for any new section is 0.  The last <b>@Priority</b> command in a section overrides
              all previous priorities for that section.  Thus each section has only one <u>priority</u> setting in  the
              end.    Priorities   are   kept   as   an   int,   thus  range  from  INT_MAX  to  INT_MIN.   (See
              <a href="file:/usr/include/limits.h">/usr/include/limits.h</a> for these values on your system.)

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>HELPER</b></h4><pre>
       IMWheel contains a semi-hidden configuration helper which can be brought up by rolling up and down a  few
       times  in  the root window of the X server.  Inside this window you can find out possible window names to
       use in your imwheelrc file.  Press on the mini-screen capture to grab another window, including the  root
       window (whole screen).

       Mouse wheel and button actions can be grabbed along with active modifier keys on the keyboard.  The mouse
       wheel/button action is displayed and the X KeySyms are displayed beneath it.  All this information can be
       directly entered into an imwheelrc as desired.

       IMWheel  can be restarted to read in a changed imwheelrc file or the configurator can be canceled causing
       imwheel to resume oprations without reading the configuration file.  To restart, imwheel execs itself  as
       called  by  the  user  in  the  first place but adding the <b>-R</b> option to indicate to itself that this is a
       restarted imwheel.  The <b>-R</b> is not for use by the user, as it bypasses some configuration of imwheel.

</pre><h4><b>KEYSYMS</b></h4><pre>
       The program expects combinations of keysyms to be used  by  using  pipe(|)  characters  to  combine  them
       together.

       Example:
              Alt_R|Shift_R

              Means right alt <u>and</u> right shift together, not just either one or the other!  And not one after the
              other, they are both pressed at the same time essentially.

       Common Modifier Keysym names used in X:
       Shift_L     Shift_R
       Control_L   Control_R
       Alt_L       Alt_R

       These are probably not currently assigned any keys, unless you <u>xmodmap</u> them in:

       Meta_L      Meta_R      (Actually, Sun keyboards have this...)
       Super_L     Super_R
       Hyper_L     Hyper_R

       And  here's some that you may use, and they are <u>somewhere</u> on your keyboard.  Here's where they were on my
       keyboard, again, this is not universal.  Use the <u>xev</u> program to test your own keys on your keyboard!

       Caps_Lock   = The Caps Lock key!
                     (This still turns on and off caps lock!)
       Num_Lock    = The Num Lock key!
                     (This is not good to use...
                      for the same reasons as Caps_Lock)
       Multi_key   = The Scroll Lock key!
                     (Go figure!)
       Mode_switch = Right Alt...for me anyways.
                     (This mean I cannot use Alt_R)

       The windows keys may not be assigned any KeySyms, but they will have numbers.  <u>xmodmap</u>  can  be  used  to
       assign them to a real KeySym.

       To find keysym names for any keys available see the <b>/usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h</b> file, and for any define
       in  that  file  remove  the "XK_" for the usable KeySym name in the configuration file.  The path to this
       file may differ for you.

       Remember, there's always the configurator.  And <b>xev</b> will also help here too!

</pre><h4><b>WHEEL</b> <b>AS</b> <b>MIDDLE</b> <b>BUTTON</b> <b>IN</b> <b>X</b></h4><pre>
       Configure the XF86Config without "Emulate3Buttons" and increase "Buttons" if it is 2  in  the  Ponter  or
       InputDevice  section.   The  wheel will act as a real middle button and the outer two buttons will act as
       separate buttons (1 and 3), even when pressed together.

       Of course if your wheel keeps clicking middle button while you're trying to use the wheel you may want to
       activate the Emulate3Buttons option to disable the wheel button!  And don't forget to reduce the  Buttons
       argument to 2!

</pre><h4><b>LEFTY</b> <b>BUTTON</b> <b>MAPPING</b> <b>IN</b> <b>X</b> <b>WINDOWS</b></h4><pre>
       For  those  lefties  out  there, this command may help you get the buttons set up correctly in X for both
       left handed and imwheel use.

              xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1 4 5"
                <u>or</u>
              xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1 4 5 6 7"
                <u>etc...</u>
              xmodmap -e "pointer = 3 2 1 4 5 6 7 8 9"

              NOTE: most of these are NOT going to work, because of all the limits in X.

       Add more numbers to the end of this line if you have more buttons!

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Of course...but most of the time it's just that you haven't read everything I've written here and in  the
       files  of  the  distribution  itself.  Even then, you may be giving up too easily.  Keep trying, it's not
       that hard.  I am always working to reduce strange behavior.  This is still a beta, as  indicated  by  the
       leading 0 in the version number.

       <b>Real</b> <b>Bugs</b>

       imwheel doesn't get along with itself on the same X display. This will always be your fault :-/

       Stick mice are still a pain in the butt to use. - This is the manufacturer's fault.  Or X Windows' fault,
       for not having a method to easily use such devices in all applications.

       Keyboard  focus  isn't  changed  automatically to input keys into Window mouse is over.  This only occurs
       with Click-to-Focus type focus management in window managers.  I use sloppy focus in fvwm2, which  always
       works for me. - Whose fault <u>is</u> this?  (Switch focus modes and/or window managers, or try the <b>-f</b> option on
       imwheel)

       Configuration  file  is not validated for correctness nicely... although it does get preparsed before the
       main program starts, thus stopping you before you run with an invalid configuration file.   I  just  have
       never  made  a bad configuration file, so I guess I'll have to try and do that to see what happens.  Just
       don't make any mistakes and you'll be fine.
