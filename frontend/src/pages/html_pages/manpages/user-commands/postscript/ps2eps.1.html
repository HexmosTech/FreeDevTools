</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents <b>ps2eps</b> version 1.70.

       <b>ps2eps</b> is a tool (written in Perl) to produce Encapsulated PostScript Files (EPS/EPSF) from usual
       one-paged Postscript documents. It calculates correct Bounding Boxes for those EPS files and filters some
       special postscript command sequences that can produce erroneous results on printers. EPS files are often
       needed for including (scalable) graphics of high quality into TeX/LaTeX (or even Word) documents. It can
       also be used to calculate correct BoundingBoxes for PDF files by using the option <b>--BBonly</b>. However, it
       cannot produce a PDF file, but it can be used together with <b>pdfcrop</b>.

       Without any argument, ps2eps reads from standard input and writes to standard output. If filenames are
       given as arguments they are processed one by one and output files are written to filenames with extension
       .eps. If input filenames have the extension .ps or .prn, this extension is replaced with .eps. In all
       other cases .eps is appended to the input filename. Please note that PostScript files for input should
       contain only one single page (you can possibly use the <b>psselect</b> from the psutils package to extract a
       single page from a document that contains multiple pages).

       If BoundingBox in output seems to be wrong, please try options <b>--size</b> or <b>--ignoreBB</b>. See also section
       TROUBLESHOOTING.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ps2eps</b> follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-'). A
       summary of options is included below.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show summary of options.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Show version of program.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--force</b>
           Force overwriting existing files.  <b>ps2eps</b> will not overwrite files by default to avoid deleting
           original EPS files accidently.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           quiet operation (no output while processing files, except errors).

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--noinsert</b>
           do not insert any postscript code. Normally a few postscript instructions are added around the
           original postscript code by <b>ps2eps</b> which can be turned off by this option.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--preserveorientation</b>
           do not filter %%Orientation: header comment.

       <b>-X</b>, <b>--BBonly</b>
           Just print the resulting bounding box(es) to standard error, no output file is written.  <b>ps2eps</b> will
           perform a read-only operation. This is highly useful to calculate bounding boxes of PDF files. Can be
           used with option <b>--quiet</b> to suppress other output and also with <b>--nohires</b> to suppress output of the
           HiResBoundingBox. It can be used with <b>pdfcrop</b> as follows: <b>pdfcrop</b> <b>--gscmd</b> <b>'gswrap-ps2eps.sh'</b> <b>file.pdf</b>
           where <b>gswrap-ps2eps.sh</b> contains something like <b>ps2eps</b> <b>-l</b> <b>-X</b> <b>-q</b> <b>$BASH_ARGV</b>

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--nofix</b>
           do not try to fix postscript code by filtering some instructions.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--removepreview</b>
           remove preview image (smaller file, but no preview anymore).

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--fixps</b>
           fix postscript code unconditionally. Otherwise, filtering is usually triggered by detection of
           certain drivers only.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--comments</b>
           preserve document structure comments.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--clip</b>
           insert postscript code for clipping. Unless <b>--nohires</b> is specified, the HiResBoundingBox (enlarged by
           0.1 points) is used for clipping.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mono</b>
           use black/white bitmap as base for calculation (default: off).

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--size</b>=<u>pagedim</u>
           where <u>pagedim</u> is a pre-defined standard page size (e.g., a4,a0,b0,letter,...) or explicitly specified
           in a format <u>pagedim</u>:=<u>X</u>x<u>Y</u>[cm|in], where <u>X</u> and <u>Y</u> are numbers (floating points are accepted) followed by
           units centimeter (cm) or inch (in), (default: cm). Use <b>--size=list</b> to list pre-defined pagesizes. See
           also environment variable <u>PS2EPS_SIZE</u>.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--translate=x,y</b>
           specify an x,y offset (may be negative) in postscript points (1/72 dpi) for drawing. This option may
           be required if your drawing has negative coordinates which usually lets ghostscript cut the negative
           part of your picture, because it starts to render at positive coordinates. The resulting output will
           also be shifted.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--resolution=dpi</b>
           specify a resolution in dpi (dots per inch) for drawing under ghostscript. Default resolution is 144
           dpi which is the double of the typical 72 dpi. This option may help if there is a hardware dependent
           resolution encoded in the postscript, e.g., 600dpi. Example: <b>ps2eps</b> <b>-l</b> <b>-r</b> <b>600</b> <b>test.ps</b>

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--rotate=direction</b>
           This option rotates the resulting EPS output. The parameter <u>direction</u> determines the direction of
           rotation: + means +90 degrees (clockwise),- means -90 degrees (counter-clockwise), and ^ means 180
           degrees (up-side down).

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--loose</b>
           expand the original tight bounding box by one point in each direction.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--ignoreBB</b>
           do not use existing bounding box as page size for rendering.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--ignoreEOF</b>
           do not use %%EOF as hint for end of file. Otherwise, <b>ps2eps</b> assumes that postscript code ends after
           the last %%EOF comment, because some drivers add trailing binary “garbage” code which gets deleted by
           <b>ps2eps</b> by default.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--gsbbox</b>
           use internal bbox device of ghostscript instead of the external C program <b>bbox</b>. The internal bbox
           device of ghostscript generates different values (sometimes even incorrect), so using the provided
           <b>bbox</b> should be more robust. See also environment variable <u>PS2EPS_GSBBOX</u>.

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--nohires</b>
           do not generate a %%HiResBoundingBox comment for output.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--accuracy</b>
           increase the accuracy by turning subsample antialiasing on (may be slower)

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--license</b>
           show licensing information.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--debuggs</b>
           show ghostscript call. This may be helpful for solving problems that occur during a ghostscript call.

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--warnings</b>
           show warnings about sanity of generated EPS file. Certain postscript commands should not be contained
           in an EPS file. With this option set <b>ps2eps</b> will issue a warning if it detects at least one of them.

</pre><h4><b>TROUBLESHOOTING</b></h4><pre>
       Based on the given postscript source code (in most cases generated by some postscript printer driver)
       there are many potential obstacles or problems that may occur when trying to create proper EPS files.
       Please read this section carefully to be aware of common pitfalls.

   <b>Incomplete/Clipped</b> <b>Images</b>
       or how to determine the right size for ghostscript.

       If you have documents that are larger than your ghostscript default (usually A4 or US letter), you have
       to specify the page dimensions explicitly using the <b>-s</b> option. Otherwise your EPS might be cut off during
       rasterizing by ghostscript resulting in a wrongly calculated bounding box. You can pass all pre-defined
       page sizes to <b>-s</b> that ghostscript understands. These are currently: 11x17, ledger, legal, letter,
       lettersmall, archA, archB, archC, archD, archE a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, isob0, isob1,
       isob2, isob3, isob4, isob5, isob6, b0, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, c0, c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, jisb0, jisb1,
       jisb2, jisb3, jisb4, jisb5, jisb6, flsa, flse, halfletter. Unfortunately, all sizes are currently only
       available in portrait orientation (not landscape).

       By default, <b>ps2eps</b> uses an already given %%BoundingBox from the source file, which often corresponds to
       the size of the physical page format for which the document was printed. However, you should be aware
       that this already specified bounding box may be not correct, thus resulting in a wrongly cropped (or even
       no usable) .eps-file.  <b>ps2eps</b> can only do as good as ghostscript does in rendering the original
       postscript file (though <b>ps2eps</b> even works with negative and fractional values are contained in the
       original bounding box by using automatic translation). Therefore, if the given bounding box is to small
       or incorrect anyway, you can ignore the existing bounding box with the <b>-B</b> option, which will cause
       ghostscript to use its internal default size (or use <b>-s</b>). However, if the BoundingBox has negative
       coordinates, which is not allowed by the specification, <b>ps2eps</b> will shift the output to positive values.

       Hint: to avoid rotating the picture if you have the original drawing in landscape format, you may use the
       “Encapsulated Postscript” option in the printer driver which should generate an EPS file (but with a
       bounding box of the sheet size!). But some Windows printer drivers are drawing the image with an offset
       from the bottom of the portrait page, so that a part of it is drawn outside the landscape oriented page.
       In this case, you'll have to specify a square size of the page using the maximum length, e.g., 29.7cm x
       29.7cm for an A4 page.

   <b>Clipping</b>
       or why gets some of my text deleted above the included .eps file?

       Some postscript drivers draw a white rectangle from the top left corner of the page to the right lower
       corner of the object. This may erase some or even all text above your imported/included EPS file, which
       is very annoying. In order to prevent this, most programs have a clipping option for imported .eps files
       (within LaTeX you can use \includegraphics*{}) for this purpose. If this is unfortunately not the case,
       you can use the <b>-C</b> option of <b>ps2eps</b> which will (hopefully) do it for you. Unfortunately, PScript.dll 5.2
       (Windows XP) introduced new very badly behaving Postscript code (initclip) which will even override the
       outer clipping! Thus, a new filter had to be installed in <b>ps2eps</b> which will fix it.

       However, because most programs clip directly on the bounding box, you still may loose some pixels of your
       image, because the bounding box is described in the coarse resolution of postscript points, i.e. 72 dpi.
       In order to prevent this, you can use the <b>-l</b> option or <b>-C</b> option (for the latter, clipping by the
       importing program should be disabled then) to allow for a 1 point larger bounding box.  <b>-C</b> clips around a
       1 point enlarged bounding box and <b>-l</b> enlarges the bounding box values by 1 point (you can also combine
       both options).

   <b>Included</b> <b>Filters</b>
       Some postscript sequences, e.g., for using specific printer features (featurebegin ...), are not working
       well within an .eps file, so <b>ps2eps</b> tries to filter them out. But please note that filters for postscript
       code may not work properly for your printer driver (<b>ps2eps</b> was mainly tested with HP and Adobe printer
       drivers, although it may work for all printers using the PScript.dll). In this case you can try to turn
       of filtering by using option <b>-n</b>, or try to find the bad sequence in the postscript code and adapt the
       filter rule in the <b>ps2eps</b> script (variables $linefilter, $rangefilter_begin, $rangefilter_end; linefilter
       is an expression for filtering single lines, rangefilter_... are expressions that filter all lines
       between a pattern matching $rangefilter_begin and $rangefilter_end; drop me an e-mail with your
       modifications). However, things may change as the printer drivers (e.g., PScript.dll) or postscript
       language evolve.

       Some applications or drivers generate postscript code with leading or trailing binary code, which often
       confuses older postscript interpreters.  <b>ps2eps</b> tries to remove such code, but it may sometimes make a
       wrong guess about start and end of the real postscript code (drop me an e-mail with a zipped postscript
       source, see section BUGS).

       Comment lines or even blank lines are removed (which is the default to make .eps files smaller), which
       may corrupt your output. Please check the next section how to fix this.  <b>ps2eps</b> removes blank lines and
       also &lt;CR&gt; (carriage ceturn “\r”) at the end of lines. However, nicely formatted postscript code gives a
       hint by using “%%BeginBinary” “%%EndBinary” comments. When <b>ps2eps</b> detects these comments it will refrain
       from any filtering action within the marked binary sections.

       <b>ps2eps</b> filters also %%Orientation: comments by default (you can use option <b>-O</b> to turn off filtering),
       because ghostscript may “automagically” rotate images when generating PDF images, which is not desired in
       most cases. Hint: you can turn off that feature in ghostscript unconditionally by specifying
       -dAutoRotatePages=/None.

   <b>Corrupted</b> <b>Output</b>
       Some postscript code may get corrupted when comment lines or even blank lines are removed (which is the
       default to make .eps files smaller), because those files may contain encoded images which also have a %
       as first character in a line or use a special comment as end of image delimiter. If this is the case, use
       the <b>-c</b> option to prevent filtering comments.

   <b>Color</b> <b>and</b> <b>memory</b>
       <b>ps2eps</b> supports colored postscript, consequently letting ghostscript consume more resources for drawing
       its bitmap (roughly 6MBytes for an A4 page).  <b>bbox</b> is reading the bitmap line by line so it consumes only
       minimal memory. If you experience problems with memory consumption of ghostscript, you may use the <b>-m</b>
       option for using a monochrome image. But this will probably result in wrongly determined bounding boxes
       with colored images, because ghostscript has to do black/white dithering and may thus suppress objects
       drawn in light colors.

       Another option in case of memory problems and too long run times is to use the much more memory efficient
       internal ghostscript bbox by using the <b>-g</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Please note that a command line option always takes precedence over the related environment variable.

       The environment variable <u>PS2EPS_SIZE</u> can be used to specify a default page size and take any argument
       that <b>--size</b> accepts. Examples: <b>export</b> <b>PS2EPS_SIZE=a0</b> (bash-like syntax) or <b>setenv</b> <b>PS2EPS_SIZE</b> <b>letter</b> (csh
       syntax).

       If the environment variable <u>PS2EPS_GSBBOX</u> is set the internal bbox device of ghostscript will be used
       instead of the external command <b>bbox</b>. Examples: <b>export</b> <b>PS2EPS_GSBBOX=true</b> (bash-like syntax) or <b>setenv</b>
       <b>PS2EPS_GSBBOX</b> <b>1</b> (csh syntax).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The usual call is simply: <b>ps2eps</b> <b>-l</b> <u>file</u>

       A relatively failsafe call would be (if your postscript is smaller than iso b0 [100cm x 141.4cm] and you
       have a fast computer with enough memory): <b>ps2eps</b> <b>-l</b> <b>-B</b> <b>-s</b> <b>b0</b> <b>-c</b> <b>-n</b> <u>file</u>

       If output is not correct try: <b>ps2eps</b> <b>-l</b> <b>-B</b> <b>-s</b> <b>b0</b> <b>-F</b> <u>file</u>

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ps2eps</b> was written by Roland Bless.

   <b>WHY?</b>
       Other programs like <b>ps2epsi</b> do not calculate the bounding box always correctly (because the values are
       put on the postscript stack which may get corrupted by bad postscript code) or rounded it off so that
       clipping the EPS cut off some part of the image.  <b>ps2eps</b> uses a double precision resolution of 144 dpi
       and appropriate rounding to get a proper bounding box. The internal bbox device of ghostscript generates
       different values (sometimes even incorrect), so using the provided <b>bbox</b> should be more robust. However,
       because normal clipping has only a resolution of 1/72dpi (postscript point), the clipping process may
       still erase parts of your EPS image. In this case please use the <b>-l</b> option to add an additional point of
       white space around the tight bounding box.

   <b>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</b>
