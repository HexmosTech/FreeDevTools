       dvips - convert a TeX DVI file to PostScript

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dvips</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>file</u>[<b>.dvi</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       THIS  MAN  PAGE  IS OBSOLETE!  See the Texinfo documentation instead.  You can read it either in Emacs or
       with the standalone <b>info</b> program.

       The program <b>dvips</b> takes a DVI file <u>file</u>[<b>.dvi</b>] produced by  TeX  (or  by  some  other  processor  such  as
       GFtoDVI)  and  converts it to PostScript, sending the output to a file or directly to a printer.  The DVI
       file may be specified without the <b>.dvi</b> extension.  Fonts used may either be resident in  the  printer  or
       defined as bitmaps in PK files, or a `virtual' combination of both.  If the <b>mktexpk</b> program is installed,
       <b>dvips</b> will automatically invoke METAFONT to generate fonts that don't already exist.

       For  more  information,  see  the  Texinfo manual <u>dvips.texi</u>, which should be installed somewhere on your
       system, hopefully accessible through the standard Info tree.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>     Conserve memory by making three passes over the .dvi file instead of two and  only  loading  those
              characters actually used.  Generally only useful on machines with a very limited amount of memory,
              like some PCs.

       <b>-A</b>     Print only odd pages (TeX pages, not sequence pages).

       <b>-b</b> <b>num</b> Generate  <u>num</u>  copies of each page, but duplicating the page body rather than using the <u>#numcopies</u>
              option.  This can be useful in conjunction with a  header  file  setting  <u>\bop-hook</u>  to  do  color
              separations or other neat tricks.

       <b>-B</b>     Print only even pages (TeX pages, not sequence pages).

       <b>-c</b> <b>num</b> Generate <u>num</u> copies of every page.  Default is 1.  (For collated copies, see the <u>-C</u> option below.)

       <b>-C</b> <b>num</b> Create <u>num</u> copies, but collated (by replicating the data in the PostScript file).  Slower than the
              <u>-c</u> option, but easier on the hands, and faster than resubmitting the same PostScript file multiple
              times.

       <b>-d</b> <b>num</b> Set  the  debug  flags.   This  is  intended  only  for  emergencies  or  for unusual fact-finding
              expeditions; it will work only if <b>dvips</b> has been compiled with  the  DEBUG  option.   If  nonzero,
              prints  additional information on standard error.  For maximum information, you can use `-1'.  See
              the Dvips Texinfo manual for more details.

       <b>-D</b> <b>num</b> Set the resolution in dpi (dots per inch) to <u>num</u>.  This affects the choice of  bitmap  fonts  that
              are  loaded  and  also the positioning of letters in resident PostScript fonts. Must be between 10
              and 10000.  This affects both the horizontal  and  vertical  resolution.   If  a  high  resolution
              (something greater than 400 dpi, say) is selected, the <u>-Z</u> flag should probably also be used.

       <b>-e</b> <b>num</b> Make  sure  that  each  character  is  placed at most this many pixels from its `true' resolution-
              independent position on the page. The default value of this  parameter  is  resolution  dependent.
              Allowing  individual characters to `drift' from their correctly rounded positions by a few pixels,
              while regaining the true position at the beginning of each  new  word,  improves  the  spacing  of
              letters in words.

       <b>-E</b>     makes  <b>dvips</b>  attempt to generate an EPSF file with a tight bounding box.  This only works on one-
              page files, and it only looks at marks made by characters and rules, not by any included graphics.
              In addition, it gets the glyph metrics from the <u>tfm</u> file, so characters  that  lie  outside  their
              enclosing  <u>tfm</u>  box may confuse it.  In addition, the bounding box might be a bit too loose if the
              character glyph has significant left or right side bearings.  Nonetheless, this option works  well
              for  creating  small EPSF files for equations or tables or the like.  (Note, of course, that <b>dvips</b>
              output is resolution dependent and thus does not make very good  EPSF  files,  especially  if  the
              images are to be scaled; use these EPSF files with a great deal of care.)

       <b>-f</b>     Run  as  a  filter.   Read  the <u>.dvi</u> file from standard input and write the PostScript to standard
              output.  The standard input must be seekable, so it cannot be a pipe.  If you  must  use  a  pipe,
              write a shell script that copies the pipe output to a temporary file and then points <b>dvips</b> at this
              file.   This  option  also disables the automatic reading of the <u>PRINTER</u> environment variable, and
              turns off the automatic sending of control D if it was turned on with the  <u>-F</u>  option  or  in  the
              configuration file; use <u>-F</u> after this option if you want both.

       <b>-F</b>     Causes  Control-D (ASCII code 4) to be appended as the very last character of the PostScript file.
              This is useful when <b>dvips</b> is driving the printer directly instead of working through a spooler, as
              is common on extremely small systems.  NOTE! DO NOT USE THIS OPTION!

       <b>-G</b>     Causes <b>dvips</b> to shift non-printing characters to higher-numbered positions.  This  may  be  useful
              sometimes.

       <b>-h</b> <b>name</b>
              Prepend  file  <u>name</u> as an additional header file. (However, if the name is simply `-' suppress all
              header files from the output.)  This header file gets added to the PostScript <u>userdict</u>.

       <b>-i</b>     Make each section be a separate file.  Under certain circumstances, <b>dvips</b> will split the  document
              up  into  `sections'  to  be  processed independently; this is most often done for memory reasons.
              Using this option tells <b>dvips</b> to place each section into a separate file; the new file  names  are
              created  replacing  the  suffix of the supplied output file name by a three-digit sequence number.
              This option is most often used in conjunction with the <u>-S</u> option which sets  the  maximum  section
              length in pages.  For instance, some phototypesetters cannot print more than ten or so consecutive
              pages  before  running  out of steam; these options can be used to automatically split a book into
              ten-page sections, each to its own file.

       <b>-j</b>     Download only needed characters from Type 1 fonts. This is the default  in  the  current  release.
              Some debugging flags trace this operation.  You can also control partial downloading on a per-font
              basis, via the <b>psfonts.map</b> file.

       <b>-k</b>     Print  crop marks.  This option increases the paper size (which should be specified, either with a
              paper size special or with the <u>-T</u> option) by a half inch in each dimension.   It  translates  each
              page  by  a  quarter  inch and draws cross-style crop marks.  It is mostly useful with typesetters
              that can set the page size automatically.

       <b>-K</b>     This option causes comments in included  PostScript  graphics,  font  files,  and  headers  to  be
              removed.  This is sometimes necessary to get around bugs in spoolers or PostScript post-processing
              programs.  Specifically, the %%Page comments, when left in, often cause difficulties.  Use of this
              flag  can  cause  some  included  graphics  to  fail, since the PostScript header macros from some
              software packages read portions of the input stream line  by  line,  searching  for  a  particular
              comment.   This  option  has been turned off by default because PostScript previewers and spoolers
              have been getting better.

       <b>-l</b> <b>num</b> The last page printed will be the first one numbered <u>num</u> Default is the last page in the document.
              If the <u>num</u> is prefixed by an equals sign, then it (and any argument to the <u>-p</u> option)  is  treated
              as  a sequence number, rather than a value to compare with <u>\count0</u> values.  Thus, using <u>-l</u> <u>=9</u> will
              end with the ninth page of the document, no matter what the pages are actually numbered.   On  the
              other  hand,  if  <u>num</u>  is suffixed by `.SEQ', the SEQth occurrence of <u>num</u> is used; for example, <u>-l</u>
              <u>99.2</u> says to end processing with the second page numbered 99 in the document.

       <b>-m</b>     Specify manual feed for printer.

       <b>-mode</b> <b>mode</b>
              Use <u>mode</u> as the Metafont device name for path searching and font generation.  This  overrides  any
              value from configuration files.  With the default paths, explicitly specifying the mode also makes
              the program assume the fonts are in a subdirectory named <u>mode</u>.

       <b>-M</b>     Turns  off the automatic font generation facility.  If any fonts are missing, commands to generate
              the fonts are appended to the file <u>missfont.log</u> in the current directory; this file  can  then  be
              executed and deleted to create the missing fonts.

       <b>-n</b> <b>num</b> At most <u>num</u> pages will be printed. Default is 100000.

       <b>-N</b>     Turns  off  structured  comments;  this  might  be necessary on some systems that try to interpret
              PostScript comments in weird ways, or on some PostScript printers.  Old versions of TranScript  in
              particular cannot handle modern Encapsulated PostScript.

       <b>-noomega</b>
              This  will  disable  the  use  of  Omega  extensions when interpreting DVI files.  By default, the
              additional opcodes <u>129</u> and <u>134</u> are recognized by dvips as Omega or pTeX extensions and interpreted
              as requests to set 2-byte characters.

       <b>-noptex</b>
              This will disable the use of pTeX  extensions  when  interpreting  DVI  files.   By  default,  the
              additional  opcodes  <u>130</u>  and  <u>135</u>  are  recognized by dvips as pTeX extensions and interpreted as
              requests to set 3-byte characters, and <u>255</u> as request to change the typesetting direction.

              The only drawback is that the virtual font array will (at least temporarily) require 65536 or more
              positions instead of the default 256 positions, i.e., the memory requirements  of  dvips  will  be
              somewhat  larger.   If  you  find this unacceptable or encounter another problem with the Omega or
              pTeX extensions, you can switch off the pTeX extension by using <b>-noptex</b>, or both by using <b>-noomega</b>
              (but please do send a bug report if you find such problems - see the bug address  in  the  <b>AUTHORS</b>
              section below).

       <b>-o</b> <b>name</b>
              The  output  will  be  sent to file <u>name</u> If no file name is given (i.e., -o is last on the command
              line), the default name is <u>file.ps</u> where the .dvi file was called <u>file.dvi</u>; if this  option  isn't
              given,  any  default  in  the  configuration file is used.  If the first character of the supplied
              output file name is an exclamation mark, then the remainder will be used as an argument to  <u>popen</u>;
              thus,  specifying  <u>!lpr</u>  as  the output file will automatically queue the file for printing.  This
              option also disables the automatic reading of the <u>PRINTER</u> environment variable, and turns off  the
              automatic  sending  of  control  D  if it was turned on with the <u>-F</u> option or in the configuration
              file; use <u>-F</u> after this option if you want both.

       <b>-O</b> <b>offset</b>
              Move the origin by a certain amount.  The <u>offset</u> is a comma-separated pair of dimensions, such  as
              <u>.1in,-.3cm</u>  (in the same syntax used in the <u>papersize</u> special).  The origin of the page is shifted
              from the default position (of one inch down, one inch to the right from the upper left  corner  of
              the paper) by this amount.

       <b>-p</b> <b>num</b> Just like <u>-l</u> but for the first page in the document.

       <b>-pp</b> <b>pagelist</b>
              A  comma-separated  list  of  pages  and  ranges  (a-b) may be given, which will be interpreted as
              <u>\count0</u> values.  Pages not specified will not be printed.  Multiple <b>-pp</b> options may  be  specified
              or all pages and page ranges can be specified with one <b>-pp</b> option.

       <b>-P</b> <b>printername</b>
              Sets   up   the   output  for  the  appropriate  printer.   This  is  implemented  by  reading  in
              <u>config.printername</u> , which can then set the output pipe (as in, <u>!lpr</u> <u>-Pprintername</u> as well as  the
              font  paths  and  any other <u>config.ps</u> defaults for that printer only.  Note that <u>config.ps</u> is read
              before <u>config.printername</u> In addition, another file called <u><a href="file:~/.dvipsrc">~/.dvipsrc</a></u> is searched for  immediately
              after  <u>config.ps</u>;  this  file  is  intended  for  user  defaults.   If no <u>-P</u> command is given, the
              environment  variable  <u>PRINTER</u>  is  checked.   If  that  variable  exists,  and  a   corresponding
              configuration file exists, that configuration file is read in.

       <b>-q</b>     Run  in  quiet  mode.   Don't  chatter  about  pages converted, etc.; report nothing but errors to
              standard error.

       <b>-r</b>     Stack pages in reverse order.  Normally, page 1 will be printed first.

       <b>-R[0|1|2]</b>
              Run securely.  <b>-R2</b> disables both shell command execution in <u>\special'{}</u> (via  backticks  <b>`</b>  )  and
              config  files  (via  the  <u>E</u>  option),  and  opening of any absolute filenames.  <b>-R1</b> , the default,
              forbids shell escapes but allows absolute filenames.  <b>-R0</b> allows both.  The config file option  is
              <u>z</u>

       <b>-s</b>     Causes  the  entire  global output to be enclosed in a save/restore pair.  This causes the file to
              not be truly conformant, and is thus not recommended, but is useful if you are driving the printer
              directly and don't care too much about the portability of the output.

       <b>-S</b> <b>num</b> Set the maximum number of pages in each `section'.  This option is most commonly used with the  <u>-i</u>
              option; see that documentation above for more information.

       <b>-t</b> <b>papertype</b>
              This  sets  the  paper  type  to  <u>papertype</u>.   The  <u>papertype</u>  should  be  defined  in  one of the
              configuration files, along with the appropriate code to select it.  (Currently known types include
              <b>letter</b>, <b>legal</b>, <b>ledger</b>, <b>a4</b>, <b>a3</b>).  You can also specify <b>-t</b> <b>landscape</b>, which rotates a document by 90
              degrees.  To rotate a document whose size is not letter, you can use the <u>-t</u> option twice, once for
              the page size, and once for landscape.  You should not use any <u>-t</u> option when the DVI file already
              contains a <u>papersize</u> special, as is done by some LaTeX packages, notably hyperref.sty.

              The upper left corner of each page in the <u>.dvi</u> file is placed one inch from the left and one  inch
              from  the  top.   Use  of  this  option  is highly dependent on the configuration file.  Note that
              executing the <b>letter</b> or <b>a4</b> or other PostScript operators cause the document  to  be  nonconforming
              and  can  cause  it not to print on certain printers, so the paper size should not execute such an
              operator if at all possible.

       <b>-T</b> <b>papersize</b>
              Set the paper size to the given pair of dimensions.  This option takes its arguments in  the  same
              style as <u>-O</u>.  It overrides any paper size special in the dvi file.

       <b>-u</b> <b>psmapfile</b>
              Set <u>psmapfile</u> to be the file that dvips uses for looking up PostScript font aliases.  If <u>psmapfile</u>
              begins  with a <b>+</b> character, then the rest of the name is used as the name of the map file, and the
              map file is appended to the list of map files (instead of replacing the list).  In either case, if
              <u>psmapfile</u> has no extension, then <b>.map</b> is added at the end.

       <b>-U</b>     Disable a  PostScript  virtual  memory  saving  optimization  that  stores  the  character  metric
              information  in  the  same  string  that  is  used  to store the bitmap information.  This is only
              necessary when driving the Xerox 4045 PostScript interpreter.  It is  caused  by  a  bug  in  that
              interpreter that results in `garbage' on the bottom of each character.  Not recommended unless you
              must drive this printer.

       <b>-v</b>     Print the <b>dvips</b> version number and exit.

       <b>-V</b>     Download  non-resident PostScript fonts as bitmaps.  This requires use of `gsftopk' or `pstopk' or
              some other such program(s) in order to generate the required  bitmap  fonts;  these  programs  are
              supplied with <b>dvips</b>.

       <b>-x</b> <b>num</b> Set  the magnification ratio to <u>num</u>/1000.  Overrides the magnification specified in the .dvi file.
              Must be between 10 and 100000.  Instead of an integer, <u>num</u> may be  a  real  number  for  increased
              precision.

       <b>-X</b> <b>num</b> Set the horizontal resolution in dots per inch to <u>num</u>.

       <b>-y</b> <b>num</b> Set  the  magnification ratio to <u>num</u>/1000 times the magnification specified in the .dvi file.  See
              <b>-x</b> above.

       <b>-Y</b> <b>num</b> Set the vertical resolution in dots per inch to <u>num</u>.

       <b>-z</b>     Pass <b>html</b> hyperdvi specials through to the output for eventual distillation into PDF.  This is not
              enabled by default to avoid including the header files unnecessarily, and use of  temporary  files
              in creating the output.

       <b>-Z</b>     Causes  bitmapped  fonts to be compressed before they are downloaded, thereby reducing the size of
              the PostScript font-downloading information.  Especially useful at high resolutions or  when  very
              large  fonts  are  used.   Will  slow  down  printing  somewhat,  especially  on early 68000-based
              PostScript printers.
