</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rem2ps - draw a PostScript calendar from Remind output

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rem2ps</b> <b>[</b><u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rem2ps</b> reads the standard input, which should be the results of running <b>Remind</b> with the <b>-p</b> or <b>-pp</b> option.
       It emits PostScript code (which draws a calendar) to the standard output.

       Although  <b>rem2ps</b>  will  be maintained, no new features will be added to it.  Instead, all new development
       will continue on <b>rem2pdf</b>.

       See the section "REM2PS INPUT FORMAT" for details about the <b>-p</b> data.  This may be useful if you  wish  to
       create other <b>Remind</b> back-ends.

       Note  that  <b>rem2ps</b>  does  not  handle  UTF-8  input.   If you need to render characters outside the ASCII
       character set, see <b>rem2pdf</b> instead.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v</b>     Be more verbose.  This causes <b>rem2ps</b> to print progress messages  to  the  standard  error  stream.
              Normally, it is silent.

       <b>-p</b> <b>file</b>
              Include  the  contents  of <u>file</u> in the PostScript prologue.  This allows you to define procedures,
              variables etc. which can be used by the <b>PS</b> and <b>PSFILE</b>  reminders.   You  should  not  include  any
              document structuring comments in your prologue.

       <b>-l</b>     Produce the calendar in landscape mode rather than the default portrait mode.

       <b>-x</b>     When  printing  the  calendar,  place  the day numbers in the top-left of each day's box.  If this
              option is omitted, the day numbers appear in the top-right.

       <b>-c</b>[<u>n</u>]  If <u>n</u> is omitted, disables the small calendars for next and  previous  months  which  are  normally
              generated.  If <u>n</u> is supplied, it can range from 0 to 3, with the following meanings:

              <b>0</b>      Disable small calendars

              <b>1</b>      Place  the  small  calendars at the bottom-right if there is room; otherwise, place them at
                     the top-left.

              <b>2</b>      Place the small calendars at the top-left if there is room; otherwise, place  them  at  the
                     bottom-right.

              <b>3</b>      Place  the  previous  month's  small  calendar  at the top-left and the next month's at the
                     bottom-right if there is room; otherwise, follow <u>n</u>=1.  A moment's thought reveals  that  an
                     option  which  splits  the  calendars if there is room and otherwise follows <u>n</u>=2 yields the
                     same results as <u>n</u>=3.

       <b>-i</b>     Use ISO 8859-1 standard encoding for the PostScript fonts.  If you do not  use  this  option,  the
              default  encoding  is  used.   If  you use this option, you probably also need to convert Remind's
              output (typically UTF-8) to ISO-8859-1 using <b><a href="../man1/iconv.1.html">iconv</a></b>(1).

       <b>-e</b>     Make the calendar fill the entire page.  By default, the calendar is  slightly  smaller  than  the
              page.   This  allows  days  with many reminders to "expand" as needed.  However, if you don't have
              days which expand, you can use this option to make all of the boxes slightly bigger.  One  caveat:
              If  you do use the <b>-e</b> option and one day has many reminders, the calendar may expand off the page,
              losing some information.  Experiment!

       <b>-m</b> <b>media</b>
              Set the page size.  If you use the -m option, you must specify the media type, which can be one of
              the following.  (Sizes are approximate.)

              Letter 8.5 x 11 in.

              Legal  8.5 x 14 in.

              Ledger 11 x 17 in.

              Statement
                     5.5 x 8.5 in.

              Executive
                     7.5 x 10 in.

              A3     29.7 x 42 cm.

              A4     21 x 29.7 cm.

              A5     14.8 x 21 cm.

              B4     25.7 x 36.4 cm.

              B5     18.3 x 25.7 cm.

              Folio  8.5 x 13 in.

              Quarto 8.5 x 10.8 in.

              10x14  10 x 14 in.

              <u>X</u>x<u>Y</u>in  <u>X</u> by <u>Y</u> inches, where <u>X</u> and <u>Y</u> can be floating-point numbers.

              <u>X</u>x<u>Y</u>cm  <u>X</u> by <u>Y</u> centimetres, where <u>X</u> and <u>Y</u> can be floating-point numbers.

              Type "rem2ps -m help" for a list of available media.  Note that the media  type  (and  all  <b>rem2ps</b>
              options)  are case-sensitive.  If you don't use the <b>-m</b> option, the media defaults to a compiled-in
              default - this is usually Letter for North America and A4 for Europe.  The "-m help"  option  will
              display the compiled-in default.

       <b>-f</b>[<b>tshed</b>] <u>font</u>
              Set  the  font for the calendar title, the small calendars, the day-of-week headings, the calendar
              entries, and the day numbers, respectively.  <u>Font</u> must be the name of  a  valid  PostScript  font.
              The default fonts are equivalent to specifying:

                   -ftshe Helvetica -fd Helvetica-BoldOblique

              In other words, the heading, entry and small-calendar fonts are set to Helvetica, and the font for
              the day numbers is set to Helvetica-BoldOblique.

       <b>-s</b>[<b>thed</b>] <u>size</u>
              Set  the  size  (in  points)  of  the  text  for the the calendar title, day-of-week headings, the
              calendar entries, and the day numbers, respectively.  <u>Size</u> must be a decimal number.  The  default
              sizes are equivalent to specifying:

                   -sthd 14 -se 8

              In  other  words,  the  heading  and  day numbers are 14-point fonts, and the calendar entries are
              printed in 8-point text.

       <b>-b</b> <u>size</u>
              Set the size of the blank white border in each calendar box to <u>size</u> points.   The  default  border
              size is 6 points, or 1/12 in.

       <b>-t</b> <u>size</u>
              Set the thickness of the black calendar grid lines.  The default is 1, for a line thickness of one
              point (1/72 in.)

       <b>-o</b>[<b>lrtb</b>] <u>size</u>
              Set  the  left, right, top, and/or bottom margins to <u>size</u> points.  For this option only, <u>size</u> must
              be an integer.  It represents the margin size in units of 1/72 in.  The default margin  sizes  are
              36,  for  half-inch  margins.  If you wish to punch holes in the calendar page to insert it into a
              binder, you may wish to increase the left margin to one inch.   In  that  case,  you  should  also
              decrease the heading font size to 12 points for good output:

            # This gives good results for putting into a binder
            rem2ps -ol 72 -sh 12

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       To  use  <b>rem2ps</b>,  you  should  pipe  the output of <b>Remind</b> with the <b>-p</b> option to <b>rem2ps</b>, and then send the
       result to a printer.  This is most easily illustrated with examples:

            remind -p12 /dev/null 1 jan 1994 | rem2ps | lpr -Plaser

       That example creates a blank calendar for the entire year of 1994, and sends it  the  the  printer  named
       "laser."

            remind -p <a href="file:~/.reminders">~/.reminders</a> | rem2ps -l -sd 18 &gt; cal.ps

       This  reminder  creates  a  calendar  for  the  current  month, filling in entries from the reminder file
       "<a href="file:~/.reminders.">~/.reminders.</a>"  The calendar is produced in landscape mode, with a font size of 18 for the day  numbers.
       The result is put in the PostScript file "cal.ps."

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b> <b>AVAILABLE</b> <b>TO</b> <b>USER-SUPPLIED</b> <b>POSTSCRIPT</b> <b>CODE</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  variables are available to <b>PS</b> and <b>PSFILE</b>-type reminders.  (This material is duplicated in
       the <b>Remind</b> manual page.)

       LineWidth
              The width of the black grid lines making up the calendar.

       Border The border between the center of the grid lines and the space  used  to  print  calendar  entries.
              This border is normally blank space.

       BoxWidth and BoxHeight
              The width and height of the calendar box, from center-to-center of the black grid lines.

       InBoxHeight
              The  height from the center of the bottom black grid line to the top of the regular calendar entry
              area.  The space from here to the top of the box is used only to draw the day number.

       /DayFont, /TitleFont, /EntryFont, /SmallFont and /HeadFont
              The fonts used to draw the day numbers, the month and year title, the calendar entries, the  small
              calendars, and the day-of-week headings, respectively.

       DaySize, TitleSize, EntrySize and HeadSize
              The  sizes  of  the  above fonts.  (The size of the small calendar font is <u>not</u> defined here.)  For
              example, if you wanted to print the Hebrew date next to the regular day number  in  the  calendar,
              use:

            REM PS Border BoxHeight Border sub DaySize sub moveto \
               /DayFont findfont DaySize scalefont setfont \
               ([hebday(today())] [hebmon(today())]) show

              Note how /DayFont and DaySize are used.

       Note that if you supply PostScript code, it is possible to produce invalid PostScript files.  Always test
       your PostScript thoroughly with a PostScript viewer before sending it to the printer.  You should not use
       any document structuring comments in your PostScript code.

       In addition, prior to drawing a calendar page, <b>rem2ps</b> emits the following PostScript code:

            save (mon) (yr) PreCal restore

       where  <u>mon</u>  and <u>yr</u> are the month and year of the calendar page.  The default <b>PreCal</b> procedure simply pops
       the arguments and does nothing.  However, you can define a <b>PreCal</b> function in your prologue  file  to  do
       whatever you want - it can draw a background for the entire calendar, for instance.

       In the context of the <b>PreCal</b> procedure, the following conditions hold:

       o      The  PostScript origin is at the bottom left-hand corner of the page, and PostScript units of 1/72
              inch are in effect.

       o      The variables MinX, MinY, MaxX and MaxY define the bounding box within which the calendar will  be
              drawn.

       o      The font and font-size variables, as well as Border and LineWidth described previously, are valid.

       For an example, create a file called "myprolog" whose contents are:

                 /PreCal {
                  /yr exch def
                  /mon exch def
                  /xsiz1 MaxX MinX sub def
                  /ysiz1 MaxY MinY sub def
                  /xsiz xsiz1 MinX sub MinX sub def
                  /ysiz ysiz1 MinY sub MinY sub def
                  xsiz
                  ysiz
                  lt
                  {/len xsiz 1.41 mul def
                   MinX MinX add ysiz1 xsiz1 sub 2 div MinY add MinY add moveto}
                  {/len ysiz 1.41 mul def
                   xsiz1 ysiz1 sub 2 div MinX add MinX add MinY MinY add moveto}
                  ifelse
                  /Helvetica-Bold findfont 1 scalefont setfont
                  mon stringwidth pop
                  ( ) stringwidth pop add
                  yr stringwidth pop add
                  len exch div /len exch def
                  /Helvetica-Bold findfont len scalefont setfont
                  0.95 setgray
                  45 rotate
                  mon show
                  ( ) show
                  yr show
                 } bind def

       Use that file with the <b>rem2ps</b> <b>-p</b> option to create calendars with the year and month in large gray letters
       in the background of the calendar.

</pre><h4><b>REM2PS</b> <b>INPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>(-P</b> <b>OPTION)</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>-p</b> option is an older, simpler interchange format used by <b>Remind</b> to communicate with back-ends.  New
       back-ends are encouraged to support the new <b>-pp</b> format preferably, though they are encouraged to  support
       the older <b>-p</b> format as well if the older format contains enough information for them to work properly.

       <b>Remind</b>  <b>-p</b> sends the following lines to standard output.  The information is designed to be easily parsed
       by back-end programs:

       <b>#</b> <b>translations</b>
              This line signifies that the next line will be  the  translation  table.   The  line  following  <b>#</b>
              <b>translations</b>  is a JSON object (on a single line) containing all of the entries of the translation
              table.  Back-ends that are not interested in the translation table can simply read and discard the
              next line.
              If <b>Remind</b> sends data for multiple months, then only the first month will include  the  translation
              table.

       <b>#</b> <b>rem2ps</b> <b>begin</b>
              This  line  signifies  the start of calendar data.  Back-ends can search for it to verify they are
              being fed correct information.

       <u>month_name</u> <u>year</u> <u>num_days</u> <u>first_day</u> <u>monday_first</u>
              On this line, <u>month_name</u> is the name of the month whose calendar information is about  to  follow.
              <u>num_days</u>  is  the  number of days in this month.  <u>first_day</u> is the weekday of the first day of the
              month (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, 6 = Saturday.)  And <u>monday_first</u> is 1 if the <b>-m</b> flag  was  supplied
              to  <b>Remind</b>, or 0 if it was not.  All this information is supplied so back-ends don't need any date
              calculation facilities.

              Note that all spaces in <u>month_name</u> will be replaced with underscores.  Back-ends should undo  this
              replacement.

       <u>sun</u> <u>mon</u> <u>tue</u> <u>wed</u> <u>thu</u> <u>fri</u> <u>sat</u>
              This  line consists of space-separated names of days in whatever language <b>Remind</b> was compiled for.
              This information can be used by back-ends to annotate calendars, and means they don't have  to  be
              created for a specific language.

              Note  that  all spaces in day names will be replaced with underscores.  Back-ends should undo this
              replacement.

       <u>next_mon</u> <u>next_days</u>
              The name of the next month and the number of days in it.

       <u>prev_mon</u> <u>prev_days</u>
              The name of the previous month and the number of days in it.   The  <u>next_mon</u>  and  <u>prev_mon</u>  lines
              could be used to generate small inset calendars for the next and previous months.

       The remaining data consists of calendar entries, in the following format:

       <u>yyyy/mm/dd</u> <u>special</u> <u>tag</u> <u>dur</u> <u>time</u> <u>body</u>

       Here,  <u>yyyy</u>  is  the  year,  <u>mm</u>  is the month (01-12) and <u>dd</u> is the day of the month.  Note that the date
       components are always separated by "/" even if the date separator in <b>Remind</b> has been  set  to  "-".   The
       consistent use of "/" is designed to ease parsing.

       <u>special</u>  is  a  string  used for "out-of-band" communication with back-ends.  If the reminder is a normal
       reminder, <u>special</u> is "*".  The <b>rem2ps</b> back-end understands the specials  <b>PostScript</b>  and  <b>PSFile</b>.   Other
       back-ends  may understand other specials.  A back end should <u>silently</u> <u>ignore</u> a reminder with a special it
       doesn't understand.

       <u>tag</u> is whatever tag the user provided with the <b>TAG</b> clause, or "*" if no tag was provided.   If  there  is
       more  than  one  <b>TAG</b> clause, the tags appear in a comma-separated list.  For example, the command <b>REM</b> <b>TAG</b>
       <b>foo</b> <b>TAG</b> <b>bar</b> <b>TAG</b> <b>quux</b> would result in <b>foo,bar,quux</b> in the <u>tag</u> field.

       <u>dur</u> is the <b>DURATION</b> value in minutes, or "*" if no duration was provided.

       <u>time</u> is the time of the reminder in minutes past midnight, or  "*"  if  the  reminder  was  not  a  timed
       reminder.

       <u>body</u> is the body of the reminder.

       Future  versions  of  <b>Remind</b> may add additional keys to the JSON object.  Back-ends <u>must</u> ignore keys they
       don't recognize.

       After a month's worth of reminders have been emitted, <b>Remind</b> emits the line:

       <b>#</b> <b>rem2ps</b> <b>end</b>

       However, back-ends should keep reading until EOF in case more data for subsequent months is forthcoming.

       If you supply the <b>-l</b> option to <b>remind</b>, then reminders may be preceded by a line that looks like this:

       <b>#</b> <b>fileinfo</b> <u>lineno</u> <u>filename</u>

       The word <b>fileinfo</b> is literal; <u>lineno</u> and <u>filename</u> specify the line number  and  file  name  of  the  file
       containing  the  reminder.  Back-ends that don't care about this information should ignore lines starting
       with "#" (except, of course, for the # rem2ps lines.)

</pre><h4><b>REM2PS</b> <b>PARTIAL</b> <b>JSON</b> <b>INPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>(-PP</b> <b>OPTION)</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Remind</b> <b>-pp</b> sends the following lines to standard output.  They are designed  to  be  easily  parsed,  but
       contain  much  more  information  than  the old-style <b>remind</b> <b>-p</b> output.  The extra information contains a
       representation of the parsed "REM" statement, which could allow converters to better  preserve  semantics
       of a reminder.  For example, this format passes enough information to allow a back-end to (in many cases)
       determine a reminder's recurrence rather than just treating each reminder as a one-off event.

       The lines emitted by <b>remind</b> <b>-pp</b> are as follows:

       <b>#</b> <b>translations</b>
              This  line  signifies  that  the  next  line  will be the translation table.  The line following <b>#</b>
              <b>translations</b> is a JSON object (on a single line) containing all of the entries of the  translation
              table.  Back-ends that are not interested in the translation table can simply read and discard
              If  <b>Remind</b>  sends data for multiple months, then only the first month will include the translation
              table.

       <b>#</b> <b>rem2ps2</b> <b>begin</b>
              This line signifies the start of calendar data.  Back-ends can search for it to  verify  they  are
              being  fed correct information.  Note the "2" after "rem2ps", which distinguishes this format from
              the older <b>-p</b> format.

       <u>month_name</u> <u>year</u> <u>num_days</u> <u>first_day</u> <u>monday_first</u>
              Same as the <b>-p</b> format

       <b>CALENDAR</b> <b>ENTRIES</b>

       The remaining data consists of calendar entries expressed as a JSON object on a single line.   Each  such
       line will begin with "{" and will be a well-formed JSON object.  The keys that may be present in the JSON
       object are as follows:

       <b>date</b> <u>YYYY-MM-DD</u>
              The  <b>date</b> key will <u>always</u> be present; it is the trigger date of the reminder expressed as a string
              in the format <u>YYYY-MM-DD</u>

       <b>filename</b> <u>f</u>
              The filename in which the reminder was found.

       <b>lineno</b> <u>n</u>
              The line number within the file on which the reminder was found.

       <b>nonconst_expr</b> <b>1</b>
              If the reminder contained a non-constant expression that had to  be  evaluated  to  determine  the
              trigger  date,  this  key  will  be  present with the value 1.  If this key is present, then it is
              unsafe for a back-end to rely on recurrence semantics or even the semantics of  any  part  of  the
              parsed reminder, as they may have been computed in a way that cannot be expressed in JSON.

       <b>if_depth</b> <u>n</u>
              If  the  reminder  is  inside  one or more IF or ELSE statements, this key will be present and the
              value will be the number of nested IFs from the top-level to the reminder.   Back-ends  should  be
              wary of interpreting recurrence semantics of reminders within an IF or ELSE block.

       <b>passthru</b> <u>special</u>
              If the reminder was a SPECIAL reminder, the <b>passthru</b> key will be present and the value will be the
              type of SPECIAL (such as SHADE, COLOR, MOON, etc.)

       <b>tags</b> <u>data</u>
              If any TAG clauses are present, the <b>tags</b> key will be present and consist of a comma-separated list
              of tags.

       <b>info</b> { <u>hash</u> }
              If  any  INFO clauses are present, the <b>info</b> key will be present.  Its value will be a hash of info
              key-value pairs.  Each key is the header from an INFO string, <u>converted</u> <u>to</u>  <u>all</u>  <u>lower-case</u>.   The
              value is the value from the INFO string.

              For example, the following REM command:

                      REM INFO "Location: Boardroom" INFO "Summary: None" MSG whatever

              will produce the following <b>info</b> hash:

                      "info" : {
                          "location" : "Boardroom",
                          "summary" : "None"
                      },

       <b>time</b> <u>t</u> If  an  AT  clause  was  present, this key will contain the time of the AT clause in minutes after
              midnight.

       <b>tdelta</b> <u>n</u>
              If a time delta (+n after an AT clause) was present, this key contains the delta value in minutes.

       <b>trep</b> <u>n</u> If a time repeat (*n after an AT clause) was present,  this  key  contains  the  repeat  value  in
              minutes.

       <b>eventduration</b> <u>n</u>
              If a DURATION clause was present, this key contains the event duration in minutes.

       <b>duration</b> <u>n</u>
              If  a  DURATION  clause  was  present,  this  key  contains  today's duration in minutes.  See the
              <b><a href="../man1/remind.1.html">remind</a>(1)</b> man page, "MULTI-DAY EVENTS", for a discussion of duration vs. event duration.

       <b>eventstart</b> <u>dt</u>
              If an AT clause was present, this key contains  the  event  start  time  in  the  format  <u>YYYY-MM-</u>
              <u>DDTHH:MM</u>.

       <b>back</b> <u>n</u> If  the  reminder contained a "back" clause (-n or --n), this key contains the back value.  If the
              "back" value was -n, the value will be positive; if it was --n, the value will be negative.

       <b>delta</b> <u>n</u>
              If the reminder contained a "delta" clause (+n or ++n), this key contains the delta value.  If the
              "delta" value was +n, the value will be positive; if it was ++n, the value will be negative.

       <b>rep</b> <u>n</u>  If the reminder contained a "repeat" clause (*n), this key contains the repeat value.

       <b>skip</b> <u>type</u>
              If the reminder contained a SKIP, BEFORE or  AFTER  keyword,  then  this  key  will  contain  that
              keyword.

       <b>localomit</b> <u>array</u>
              If  the  reminder  contains  a local OMIT keyword, this key will be present.  Its value will be an
              array of English day names that are OMITted.

       <b>wd</b> <u>array</u>
              If the reminder contains one or more weekdays, this key will be present.  Its  value  will  be  an
              array of English day names that are present.

       <b>d</b> <u>n</u>    If a day-of-month is present in the reminder specification, this key will be present and its value
              will be the day number.

       <b>m</b> <u>n</u>    If  a  month is present in the reminder specification, this key will be present and its value will
              be the month number.

       <b>y</b> <u>n</u>    If a year is present in the reminder specification, this key will be present and its value will be
              the year.

       <b>until</b> <u>YYYY-MM-DD</u>
              If the reminder contains an UNTIL or THROUGH clause, this key will be present.  Its value will  be
              a string of the form YYYY-MM-DD.

       <b>once</b> <b>1</b> If the reminder contains a ONCE keyword, this key will be present with a value of 1.

       <b>scanfrom</b> <u>YYYY-MM-DD</u>
              If  the  reminder  contains  a  SCANFROM keyword, this key will be present and its value will be a
              string of the form YYYY-MM-DD.

       <b>from</b> <u>YYYY-MM-DD</u>
              If the reminder contains a FROM keyword, this key will be present and its value will be  a  string
              of the form YYYY-MM-DD.

       <b>priority</b> <u>n</u>
              The  priority  of  the  reminder.   Always  present;  if  no PRIORITY keyword is specified, then a
              reminder has a default priority of 5000.

       <b>r</b> <u>n</u>    For a SHADE or COLOR special, the red color component.

       <b>g</b> <u>n</u>    For a SHADE or COLOR special, the green color component.

       <b>b</b> <u>n</u>    For a SHADE or COLOR special, the blue color component.

       <b>body</b> <u>body</u>
              The body of the reminder to issue.  Always present.

       <b>calendar_body</b> <u>body</u>
              The text appropriate to include in a calendar.  Only present if the original body contains %"...%"
              sequences and the "q" modifier was used with Remind's "-pp..." flag.

       <b>plain_body</b> <u>body</u>
              The "plain" body of the reminder with any %"...%" sequences removed.  If your back-end is designed
              to draw a calendar, then it should use the <b>calendar_body</b> if present.  If not, then it  should  use
              the <b>plain_body</b> if present, and if not, then it should fall back on the <b>body</b>.

       <b>rawbody</b> <u>raw</u>
              The "raw" body of the reminder, before any expression-pasting or substitution-sequence processing.
              If the raw body would be the same as the processed body, then this key is not present.

       After a month's worth of reminders have been emitted, <b>Remind</b> emits the line:

       <b>#</b> <b>rem2ps2</b> <b>end</b>

       However, back-ends should keep reading until EOF in case more data for subsequent months is forthcoming.

</pre><h4><b>REM2PS</b> <b>PURE</b> <b>JSON</b> <b>INPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b> <b>(-PPP</b> <b>OR</b> <b>-P+</b> <b>OPTION)</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Remind</b> <b>-ppp</b> and <b>remind</b> <b>-p+</b> emit <u>pure</u> <u>JSON</u> output.  The format is as follows:

       <b>Remind</b> outputs a JSON array.  Each element of the array is a <u>month</u> <u>descriptor</u> or a <u>week</u> <u>descriptor</u> in the
       case of <b>remind</b> <b>-p+</b>.

       Each descriptor is a JSON object with the following elements:

       <b>caltype</b> <u>type</u>
              The  calendar  type, either <b>monthly</b> or <b>weekly</b>.  Older versions of <b>Remind</b> did not include a <b>caltype</b>
              element, so a missing <b>caltype</b> should be treated as <b>monthly</b>.

       <b>monthname</b> <u>name</u>
              The name of the month.  Present in monthly calendar types only.

       <b>year</b> <u>yyyy</u>
              The year.  Present in monthly calendar types only.

       <b>daysinmonnth</b> <u>n</u>
              The number of days in the current month.  Present in monthly calendar types only.

       <b>firstwkday</b> <u>n</u>
              The weekday of the first day of the month (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday,  6  =  Saturday).   Present  in
              monthly calendar types only.

       <b>mondayfirst</b> <u>n</u>
              An  indicator  of whether or not the calendar week should start with Sunday (n=0) or Monday (n=1).
              Present in monthly calendar types only.

       <b>daynames</b> [<u>days</u>]
              A seven-element array of day names; each element is a string representing the names  of  the  days
              from Sunday through Saturday.  Present in monthly calendar types only.

       <b>prevmonthname</b> <u>name</u>
              The name of the previous month.  Present in monthly calendar types only.

       <b>prevmonthyear</b> <u>yyyy</u>
              The  year of the previous month.  (The same as <b>year</b> unless the current month is January.)  Present
              in monthly calendar types only.

       <b>nextmonthname</b> <u>name</u>
              The name of the following month.  Present in monthly calendar types only.

       <b>daysinnextmonth</b> <u>n</u>

              Present in monthly calendar types only.

       <b>translations</b> {<u>object</u>}
              A  complete  dump  of  the  Remind translation table.  In output for multiple months or weeks, the
              translation table is included only with the first month or  week.   Present  in  both  weekly  and
              monthly calendar types.

       <b>entries</b> [<u>array</u>]
              The  <b>entries</b>  key,  present  in  both  weekly  and monthly calendar types, consists of an array of
              calendar entries; each entry is a JSON object that  has  the  same  format  as  described  in  the
              <b>CALENDAR</b> <b>ENTRIES</b> section in the <b>-PP</b> <b>FORMAT</b> section, <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>following</u> <u>difference</u>: In <b>-PP</b> mode, if
              a  reminder has <b>%"</b> markers, only the text between the markers is included in the <b>body</b> element.  In
              <b>-PPP</b> mode, the entire text <u>including</u> the <b>%"</b> markers is included and it's up  to  the  back-end  to
              extract the portion between the markers if that is desired.

       <b>dates</b> [<u>array</u>]
              The  <b>dates</b> key, present in weekly calendar types only, contains seven entries; one for each column
              in the weekly calendar.  Each entry is a JSON object containing the following key/value pairs:

              <b>date</b> <u>YYYY-MM-DD</u>
                     The date of the column.

              <b>day</b> <u>DD</u> The day number of the column.

              <b>dayname</b> <u>weekday_name</u>
                     The name of the weekday (possibly localized).

              <b>month</b> <u>month_name</u>
                     The name of the month (possibly localized).

              <b>year</b> <u>YYYY</u>

       rem2ps was written by Dianne Skoll &lt;<a href="mailto:dianne@skoll.ca">dianne@skoll.ca</a>&gt;

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       All <b>rem2ps</b> options are case-sensitive, unlike <b>Remind</b>.  Any time you supply a  font  name  or  size,  line
       thickness,  or  border  width, it is treated as a string and sent straight to the PostScript interpreter.
       Thus, if you supply invalid fonts or sizes, <b>rem2ps</b> will not complain, but the resulting PostScript output
       will probably not work.

       You should ensure that the values you supply for margin widths are sensible.  If they are too big for the
       media size, <b>rem2ps</b> will not complain, but again, the PostScript output will probably not work.
