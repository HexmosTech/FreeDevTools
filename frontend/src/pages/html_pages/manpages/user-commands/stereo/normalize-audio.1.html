</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       normalize-audio - adjusts volume levels of WAV or MP3 audio files.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>normalize-audio</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <b>--</b> ] <u>file</u> <u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>normalize-audio</b>  is used to adjust the volume of WAV or MP3 audio files to a standard volume level.  This
       is useful for things like creating mp3 mixes, where different recording levels on  different  albums  can
       cause the volume to vary greatly from song to song.

       <b>normalize-audio</b> operates in two phases.  In the first phase, it analyzes the specified files as WAV audio
       files, and computes the volume of each file.  In the second phase, it applies a volume adjustment to each
       file to set each file's volume to a standard level.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a,</b> <b>--amplitude=</b><u>AMPLITUDE</u>
              Adjust the RMS volume to the target amplitude AMPLITUDE; must be between 0.0 and 1.0.  If a number
              suffixed  by  "dB"  or  "dBFS"  is specified, the amplitude is assumed to be in decibels from full
              scale.  The default is -12dBFS.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--batch</b>
              Enable batch mode: see BATCH MODE, below.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--compression</b>
              <b>Deprecated</b>.  In previous versions, this enabled the limiter, but now the  limiter  is  enabled  by
              default.

       <b>--clipping</b>
              Disable the limiter, and just clip any samples that are too large.  Same effect as -l 0dBFS.

       <b>--fractions</b>
              Display  all  values  as decimal fractions instead of in decibels.  By default, volume adjustments
              are shown in decibels, and volume levels in dBFS, where 0 dBFS is the level of a  square  wave  of
              maximum amplitude.

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--gain=</b><u>GAIN</u>
              Skip the volume computation phase: don't compute the volume adjustment from the current volumes of
              the  files.   Instead,  just apply the given gain as a volume adjustment to all files.  As a plain
              number this is just a multiplier applied  to  all  samples,  If  a  number  suffixed  by  "dB"  is
              specified, all volumes are adjusted by that many decibels.

       <b>--id3-compat</b>
              Use  this  option  when  adjusting  MPEG audio files if your MP3 player does not recognize ID3v2.4
              tags.  See MPEG AUDIO ADJUSTMENT, below, for details.

       <b>--id3-unsync</b>
              Use this option when adjusting MPEG audio files if your MP3 player does not recognize  ID3v2  tags
              and  has  trouble  playing  some  ID3v2  tagged  MP3 files.  See MPEG AUDIO ADJUSTMENT, below, for
              details.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--limiter=</b><u>LEVEL</u>
              This controls the behavior of the limiter.   By  default,  all  samples  above  -6dBFS  (0.5)  are
              limited,  but  this option sets the limiting level to <u>LEVEL</u>. Setting <u>LEVEL</u> to 1 (or 0dBFS) does no
              limiting (clipping is done instead); setting <u>LEVEL</u> to 0 does limiting on all samples.  The default
              value is recommended unless you know what you're doing.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--mix</b>
              Enable mix mode: see MIX MODE, below.  Batch mode and mix mode are mutually exclusive.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--no-adjust</b>
              Compute and output the volume adjustment that would set the volume to the target, but don't  apply
              it  to any of the files (i.e. skip the second phase).  If you use this option, your files will not
              be altered in any way.

       <b>--no-progress</b>
              Don't print any progress information.  All other messages are printed as normal according  to  the
              verbosity level.

       <b>--peak</b> Adjust  using  peak  levels instead of RMS levels.  Each file will be adjusted so that its maximum
              sample is at full scale.  This just gives a file the maximum volume possible without clipping;  no
              normalization is done.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Don't output progress information.  Only error messages are printed.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--average-threshold=</b><u>THRESHOLD</u>
              When  averaging volume levels for batch mode or mix mode, throw out any volumes that are more than
              <u>THRESHOLD</u> decibels from the average.  A high value here (say, 50) will make sure that the  volumes
              of all files are considered in the average.

       <b>-T,</b> <b>--adjust-threshold=</b><u>THRESHOLD</u>
              If  an  adjustment  to  be  made  to  a file is smaller than <u>THRESHOLD</u> decibels, consider the file
              already normalized and don't do the adjustment.  This is 0.125 by default, or 0 if the  <b>-g</b>  option
              is given.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Increase verbosity.  This option can be repeated for more messages.

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--output-bitwidth</b>
              Force  output  files  to have samples that are W bits wide.  This option is ignored when adjusting
              MP3 files.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display usage information and exit.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Print version information and exit.

       <b>--</b>     Terminate option list.

</pre><h4><b>MIX</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       This mode is made especially for making mixed CD's and the like.  You want every song on the  mix  to  be
       the  same  volume,  but  it doesn't matter if they are the same volume as the songs on some other mix you
       made last week.  In mix mode, average level of all the files is computed, and  each  file  is  separately
       normalized to this average volume.

</pre><h4><b>BATCH</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       When operating on a group of unrelated files, you usually want all of them at the same level, and this is
       the  default  behavior.  However, a group of music files all from the same album is generally meant to be
       listened to at the relative volumes they were recorded at.  In batch mode, all the  specified  files  are
       considered  to  be  part  of  a  single  album and their relative volumes are preserved.  This is done by
       averaging the volumes of all the files, computing a single adjustment from that, and  applying  the  same
       adjustment  to  all  the  files.  Some analysis is also done so that files with volumes that appear to be
       statistical aberrations are not considered in the average.  This is useful if you have albums (like  many
       of the author's) in which there is one "quiet song" that throws off the average.

</pre><h4><b>MPEG</b> <b>AUDIO</b> <b>ADJUSTMENT</b></h4><pre>
       MP3  files  are  "adjusted"  by setting a <b>relative</b> <b>volume</b> <b>adjustment</b> frame in their ID3 tags.  There is a
       frame for this, called "RVA2", that does exactly what  we  want,  and  is  a  native  frame  in  ID3v2.4.
       Unfortunately,  many MP3 players do not support v2.4 tags, and the RVA2 tag is not native in previous ID3
       versions.  In fact, adding an RVA2 frame to a v2.3 tag confuses some MP3 players.  Therefore, we are left
       with two choices when trying to add volume adjustment information to an ID3 tag:

       1. Go ahead and upgrade the tag to version 2.4, and use RVA2 tags.  This is the default behavior, in  the
          hope that eventually MP3 players will support v2.4 tags and this won't be a problem anymore.

       2. Upgrade  the  tag  to only version 2.3.  Instead of RVA2, use an "XRVA" tag with the same format as an
          RVA2 tag.  This isn't a native frame, but since it starts with an "X",  it's  considered  experimental
          and  therefore legal, according to the ID3 spec.  The <b>--id3-compat</b> option turns on this behavior.  The
          disadvantage of the first method is that your MP3 player may no longer  read  the  ID3  tags  on  your
          files.  Bug the author of your favorite MP3 player to support ID3v2.4 tags!

       The  disadvantage  of  the second method is that the XRVA frame is only recognized by the xmms-rva plugin
       that is packaged with normalize.  On the other hand, I don't know of any MP3 players that  recognize  the
       RVA2 frame, either, so it may not make any difference.

       The  other  option  related  to  ID3 tags, <b>--id3-unsync</b>, is only necessary for compatibility with old MP3
       players that don't recognize ID3v2 tags at all.  If your MP3 player complains of garbage at the start  of
       tagged files, or is unable to play the files at all, turn this option on.  This option should never hurt,
       but if your MP3 player knows about ID3v2 tags, you don't need it.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Note  that  your version of <b>normalize-audio</b> must be compiled with MAD library support to analyze MP3 file
       volume levels.
