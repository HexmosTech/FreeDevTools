</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       fadecut is a script to rip audio files from a livestream (using stream- ripper) and to process them auto‐
       matically.  Beginning and ending fo the audio files will be cut and faded in/out.  So logos and advertis‐
       ing of radio stations will be automatically removed.

       In streaming mode fadecut is ripping audio files using streamripper.  The downloaded audio files are cut‐
       ted using silence detection and then faded in and out.  Subsequently, the files are encoded to either ogg
       or mp3 and tagged with tags (title, artist, genre and comment provided).

       In file mode fadecut is just processing already ripped audio files.

       An  audio file which has already been processed is detected and will not be processed again.  Not desired
       songs can be stored in a separate directory.  This files are not processed anymore too.

</pre><h4><b>FOLDERS</b></h4><pre>
       fadecut is working with some standard folders.  You may change them in your profile or fadecutrc

       <b>done/</b> here you put all your songs which were already processed by fadecut and which  you  want  to  keep.
       See also new/ folder.

       <b>dontlike/</b>  in this folder you may put songs which you don’t like.  Fadecut is checking this folder before
       it is processing new files in the working folder.  Null size files are ok.

       <b>error/</b> whenever an error occurs while fadecut is processing a file, that file is moved to the error fold‐
       er for later examining.

       <b>incomplete/</b> this folder is created by streamripper.  All not fully ripped songs are saved here.

       <b>new/</b> processed songs are going here.  Usually you may rip and process files with fadecut, they are  going
       in to new/ folder, you listen to them and put good songs to the done/ folder.

       <b>orig/</b>  if  you  want to keep the original file (which is ripped by stream-ripper), you may use the -k op‐
       tion.  fadecut is putting the ripped files untouched into that folder.
