</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       jack_mixer - A graphical multi-channel audio mixer for JACK

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       jack_mixer.py [-h] [-c FILE] [-d] [NAME]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents the <b>jack_mixer</b> command.

       <b>jack_mixer</b>  is a multi-channel audio mixer application for the JACK Audio Connection Kit with a graphical
       user interface and has a look &amp; handling similar to hardware mixing desks.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Positional arguments:
          NAME                  set JACK client name

       Optional arguments:

          <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
                 show this help message and exit

          <b>-c</b> <u>FILE</u>, <b>--config</b> <u>FILE</u>
                 load mixer project configuration from FILE

          <b>-d</b>, <b>--debug</b>
                 enable debug logging messages

</pre><h4><b>GUI</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       After starting <b>jack_mixer</b>, you need to create  at  least  one  input  and  one  output  channel  via  the
       respective entries in the "Mixer" menu (see section <b>MAIN</b> <b>MENU</b>).

       Then  connect  your  audio sources to the <b>jack_mixer's</b> JACK audio input ports (see section <b>JACK</b> <b>AUDIO</b> <b>AND</b>
       <b>MIDI</b> <b>PORTS</b>) using <b>jack_connect</b> or GUI tools like the QJackCtl's connections window,  Catia,  Carla,  etc.
       Connect  the monitor channel output port(s) or the output ports of the output channels to the input ports
       of your audio interface or any other JACK audio input ports.

       Then adjust input and output channel volume levels and balance as required using the  fader  controls  in
       each channel strip (see section <b>MOUSE</b> <b>BINDINGS</b> for ways to to control the faders and routing).

   <b>JACK</b> <b>AUDIO</b> <b>AND</b> <b>MIDI</b> <b>PORTS</b>
       • For each input channel, <b>jack_mixer</b> will create one (if it is a mono channel) or two (stereo) JACK audio
         input  ports. The input port(s) will be named like the input channel strip, if it is a mono channel, or
         with an " L" resp. " R" suffix, it it is a stereo channel.

       • Optionally, for each input channel, it creates a direct, post-fader audio output port (mono) or pair of
         output ports (stereo). These are named the same as their input port(s) with " Out" resp.  "  Out  L"  /
         "Out R" appended.

       • For each output channel it will create one (mono) or two (stereo) audio output ports.

       • Additionally it will create one pair of audio monitor ports named "Monitor L" and "Monitor R".

       • If  <b>jack_mixer</b>  was compiled with JACK MIDI support, it will also create one MIDI input ("midi in") and
         one MIDI output ("midi out") port.

   <b>MAIN</b> <b>MENU</b>
       Main Menu:

       Use the <b>Mixer</b> menu to:

       • Add an input or output channel.

       • Add an output channel.

       • Open a file with a preset mixer layout.

       • Save the current mixer layout to an XML file.

       • Exit <b>jack_mixer</b>.

       Use the <b>Edit</b> menu to:

       • Change the properties of an input or output channel.

       • Remove an input or output channel.

       • Toggle all channel strips between wide and narrow view.

       • Clear the current mixer layout, i.e. remove all input and output channels.

       • Open the setting preferences dialog.

       Use the <b>Help</b> menu to show <b>jack_mixer's</b> about dialog.

   <b>MOUSE</b> <b>BINDINGS</b>
       Main window:

       • Left-click and drag the vertical divider line horizontally to set the size distribution of the left and
         right panels for the input and output channel strips. If a panel contains more channel strips than  can
         be fit into its horizontal size, horizontal scrollbars will be available at the bottom of the panel.

       Channel strip header:

       • Double click the channel strip header to open the channel properties dialog.

       • Ctrl+left-click the channel strip header to toggle the channel strip between wide and narrow view.

       • Left-click  and  drag  the  channel  strip header horizontally to re-order channel strips. This doesn't
         effect the order of the JACK output ports and input channels are always arranged on the  left  side  of
         the main <b>jack_mixer</b> window and output chanels on the right side.

       Control groups (input channels):

       Each  input  channel  header  has  a control group for each output channel, which has the same background
       color and label as the corresponding output channel header.

       Each output channel control group shows a pre/post-fader ("P") and a mute ("M") button and, optionally, a
       solo ("S") button.

       • Left-click the pre/post-fader ("P") button to toggle  the  signal  sent  to  the  corresponding  output
         channel between the post-fader (off) and pre-fader (on) signal of the input channel.

       • Left-click  the  mono ("M") button to mute the signal from the input channel going to the corresponding
         output channel.

       • Left-click the solo ("S") button to solo the input channel for the corresponding output  channel.  i.e.
         only  the  signal  from  this  input  channel  (plus any other soloed channels) is going to this output
         channel.

       Volume read-out and peak-indicator:

       • Left-click the volume level read-out to enter a value manually and press Enter to set it.

       • Left/right-click the peak volume level read-out to reset the over-zero indication.

       • Middle-click the peak volume level read-out to set the volume level to peak at  0  dB  at  the  current
         signal input level.

       Volume meter:

       • Left-click  the pre-fader ("PRE") button below the volume meter to switch the signal, which is metered,
         from post-fader (off) to pre-fader (on).

         <u>(not</u> <u>yet</u> <u>implemented)</u>

       Volume slider:

       • Left-click and drag vertically anywhere in the slider area to set the channel output volume level.

       • Scroll the mouse wheel up or down over the slider area to increase or decrease the volume level.

       • Right-click anywhere in the slider area to move the volume level slowly towards the click position.

       • Double click to set the volume level to -inf.

       • Ctrl+left-click to set the volume level to 0 dBFS.

       Balance slider:

       • Left-click and drag horizontally anywhere in the slider area to set the balance between  the  left  and
         right channel of the output signal.

       • Scroll the mouse wheel up or down over the slider area to move the balance to right or left.

       • Right-click anywhere in the slider area to move the balance slowly towards the click position.

       • Double click to set the left/right balance to center.

       Channel buttons:

       • Left-click  the   mono ("M") button to mute signal from channel going to all output channels (including
         direct channel outs).

       • Ctrl+left-click the  mono ("M") button for "exclusive" mute, i.e. the mute function will  be  activated
         on this input or output channel only and deactivated on all other input resp. output channels.

       • Left-click  the  solo  ("S") button to solo an input channel, i.e. only the signal from this channel is
         going to all output channels (including the direct outputs of the channel).

         The solo function is cumulative, i.e. you can activate solo on more than  one  input  channel  and  the
         signals from all soloed channels will be going to each output channel.

         Output channels have no solo button.

       • Ctrl+left-click  the  solo ("SM") button for "exclusive" solo, i.e. the solo function will be activated
         on this channel only and deactivated on all other input channels.

       • Right-clicking the mute ("M") button acts like left-clicking but also synchronizes the muted  state  on
         all output channel control groups of the channel with the main channel mute button.

         Output channel control groups, where the mute function was already active before righ-clicking the mute
         button are unaffected, i.e. it will stay activated.

       • Right-clicking  the solo ("S") button acts like left-clicking but also synchronizes the soloed state on
         all output channel control groups of the channel with the main channel solo button.

         Output channel control groups, where the solo function was already active before righ-clicking the solo
         button are unaffected, i.e. it will stay activated.

       • Left-click the monitor ("MON") button, to toggle monitoring. If  monitoring  is  on,  the  (post-fader)
         signal  from  the channel is sent to the "Monitor L/R" outputs. The monitor function is exclusive, i.e.
         activating monitoring on a channel, will turn off monitoring on any other channel.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jack_mixer</b> is fully compatible with the New Session Manager (NSM) protocol  and  provides  Level  1  (L1)
       support  for  the LADISH protocol. When running as an NSM client, the mixer layout and current state will
       be saved in the NSM session.  When started as an L1 client by LADISH, the mixer layout and current  state
       will  be saved in the LADISH studio session or project (the first time LADISH requests <b>jack_mixer</b> to save
       a project, it will open a "Save as" dialog).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>&lt;XDG_CONFIG_HOME&gt;/jack_mixer/preferences.ini</b>
              This file stores global settings for <b>jack_mixer</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>LANGUAGE,</b> <b>LC_ALL,</b> <b>LC_MESSAGES,</b> <b>and</b> <b>LANG</b>
              The first of these environment variables set to  a  non-empty  value  is  used  to  determine  the
              language(s)  for  loading  gettext  translation  files  if  the  language is not set in the global
              settings. The value should be a colon separated list of language codes.

       <b>LOCALEDIR</b>
              With this environment variable, the base directory  for  the  gettext  translation  files  can  be
              changed from the default set at compile time, which is usually <b>&lt;prefix&gt;/share/locale</b>.

       <b>JACK_MIXER_DEBUG</b>
              When  this  environment  variable  is  set,  the logging level in the Python layer is set to <b>DEBUG</b>
              unless it is overwritten by the <b>-d|--debug</b> command line switch.

       <b>NSM_URL</b>
              When this environment variable is set, <b>jack_mixer</b> will act as a New Session Manager (NSM)  session
              client.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SIGUSR1</b>
              In  accordance with Level 1 support of LADISH, <b>jack_mixer</b> saves the current mixer layout and state
              on receiving a <b>USR1</b> signal.

       <b>SIGINT</b> <b>|</b> <b>SIGTERM</b>
              When receiving an <b>INT</b> or <b>TERM</b> signal, <b>jack_mixer</b> will either exit the application immediately  or,
              if  enabled  in the preferences, will show a confirmation dialog, allowing the user to either quit
              or cancel the action.
