</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       abcde  -  Grab  an  entire CD and compress it to Ogg/Vorbis, MP3, FLAC, Ogg/Speex, AAC, WavPack, Monkey's
       Audio (ape), MPP/MP+(Musepack), True Audio (tta), MP2 format and/or AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format).

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>abcde</b> <u>[options]</u> <u>[tracks]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Ordinarily, the process of grabbing the data off a CD and encoding it, then tagging or commenting it,  is
       very  involved.   <b>abcde</b>  is  designed  to  automate this. It will take an entire CD and convert it into a
       compressed audio format - Ogg/Vorbis, MPEG Audio Layer III  (MP3),  Free  Lossless  Audio  Codec  (FLAC),
       Ogg/Speex,  MPP/MP+(Musepack), M4A (AAC) wv (WavPack), Monkey's Audio (ape), Opus, True Audio (tta), MPEG
       Audio Layer II (MP2) or AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format) format(s).  With one command, it will:

       <b>*</b>      Do a CDDB or Musicbrainz query over the Internet to look up your CD or use a locally  stored  CDDB
              entry, or read CD-TEXT from your CD if it's available

       <b>*</b>      Download  the  album art appropriate for your music tracks with many user configurable options for
              download and post download alterations including automated embedding of the  album  art  for  some
              containers

       <b>*</b>      Grab an audio track (or all the audio CD tracks) from your CD

       <b>*</b>      Normalize the volume of the individual file (or the album as a single unit)

       <b>*</b>      Compress to Ogg/Vorbis, MP3, FLAC, Ogg/Speex, MPP/MP+(Musepack), M4A, wv (WavPack), Monkey's Audio
              (ape), Opus format(s), True Audio (tta), MP2 or AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format) all in one CD
              read

       <b>*</b>      Comment or ID3/ID3v2 tag

       <b>*</b>      Give an intelligible filename

       <b>*</b>      Calculate replaygain values for the individual file (or the album as a single unit)

       <b>*</b>      Delete the intermediate WAV file (or save it for later use)

       <b>*</b>      Repeat until finished

       Alternatively,  <b>abcde</b>  can  also  grab a CD and turn it into a single FLAC file with an embedded cuesheet
       which can be user later on as a source for other formats, and will be treated as if it was  the  original
       CD. In a way, <b>abcde</b> can take a compressed backup of your CD collection.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-1</b>     Encode  the  whole  CD  in a single file. The resulting file uses the CD title for tagging. If the
              resulting format is a flac file with an embedded cuesheet, the file can be used as  a  source  for
              creating other formats. Use "-1 -o flac -a default,cue" for obtaining such a file.

       <b>-a</b> <b>[actions]</b>
              Comma-delimited  list  of actions to perform. Can be one or more of: cddb, cue, read, getalbumart,
              embedalbumart, normalize, encode, tag, move, replaygain, playlist,  clean.  Normalize  and  encode
              imply  read.  Tag  implies  cddb,  read,  encode. Move implies cddb, read, encode, tag. Replaygain
              implies  cddb,  read,  encode,  tag  and  move.  Playlist  implies  cddb.  embedalbumart   implies
              getalbumart.   The  default  is  to do all actions except cue, normalize, replaygain, getalbumart,
              embedalbumart and playlist.

       <b>-b</b>     Enable batch mode normalization. See the BATCHNORM configuration variable.

       <b>-B</b>     Enable automatic embedding of album art with certain  containers.  As  of  abcde  2.8.2  supported
              containers are mp3 (using eyeD3), flac (using metaflac), m4a (using AtomicParsley), WavPack aka wv
              (using  wvtag)  and  experimental  support for ogg (using vorbiscomment). This command line option
              also  calls  the  getalbumart  function.  Further  details  of  album  art  embedding  using   the
              embedalbumart function can be found in the abcde FAQ document packaged with abcde.

       <b>-c</b> <b>[filename]</b>
              Specifies  an  additional configuration file to parse. Configuration options in this file override
              those in <u>/etc/abcde.conf</u> or <u>$HOME/.abcde.conf</u>.

       <b>-C</b> <b>[discid]</b>
              Allows you to resume a session for <u>discid</u> when you no longer have the  CD  available  (<b>abcde</b>  will
              automatically  resume  if  you  still have the CD in the drive). You must have already finished at
              least the "read" action during the previous session.

       <b>-d</b> <b>[devicename</b> <b>|</b> <b>filename]</b>
              CD-ROM block device that contains audio tracks to be read. Alternatively, a single-track flac file
              with embedded cuesheet.

       <b>-D</b>     Capture debugging information (you'll want to redirect this - try 'abcde -D 2&gt;logfile')

       <b>-e</b>     Erase information about encoded tracks from the internal status file, to enable other encodings if
              the wav files have been kept.

       <b>-f</b>     Force the removal of the temporary ABCDETEMPDIR directory, even when we  have  not  finished.  For
              example,  one can read and encode several formats, including ´.ogg´, and later on execute a ´move´
              action with only one of the given formats. On a normal situation it would erase the rest of  those
              encoded formats. In this case, <b>abcde</b> will refuse to execute such command, except if -f is used.

       <b>-g</b>     Enable  lame's  --nogap option.  See the NOGAP variable. WARNING: lame's --nogap disables the Xing
              mp3 tag.  This tag is required for mp3 players to correctly display  track  lengths  when  playing
              variable-bit-rate mp3 files.

       <b>-G</b>     Download  album  art  using  the getalbumart function. This is best done with CDDBMETHOD including
              musicbrainz and requires the installation  of  glyrc.   ImageMagick  is  an  optional  but  highly
              recommended  package.  Further  details  of  getalbumart  can  be  found in the abcde FAQ document
              packaged with abcde.

       <b>-h</b>     Get help information.

       <b>-j</b> <b>[number]</b>
              Start [number] encoder  processes  at  once.  Useful  for  SMP  systems.  Overrides  the  MAXPROCS
              configuration variable. Set it to "0" when using <b>distmp3</b> to avoid local encoding processes.

       <b>-k</b>     Keep the wav files after encoding.

       <b>-l</b>     Use the low-diskspace algorithm. See the LOWDISK configuration variable.

       <b>-L</b>     Use a local CDDB repository. See CDDBLOCALDIR variable.

       <b>-m</b>     Create DOS-style playlists, modifying the resulting one by adding CRLF line endings. Some hardware
              players insist on having those to work.

       <b>-n</b>     Do  not  query  CDDB database. Create and use a template. Edit the template to provide song names,
              artist(s), ...

       <b>-N</b>     Non interactive mode. Do not ask anything from the user. Just go ahead.

       <b>-o</b> <b>[filetype][:filetypeoptions]</b>
              Select output type. Can be "vorbis" (or "ogg"), "mp3", "flac", "spx", "mpc", "m4a",  "wav",  "wv",
              "ape",  "opus",  "mka"  or  "aiff".   Specify a comma-delimited list of output types to obtain all
              specified types.  See the OUTPUTTYPE configuration variable. One can pass options to  the  encoder
              for  a  specific  filetype  on  the command line separating them with a colon. The options must be
              escaped with double-quotes.

       <b>-p</b>     Pads track numbers with 0´s.

       <b>-P</b>     Use Unix PIPES to read and encode in one step (USEPIPES). This disables multiple encodings,  since
              the  WAV  audio  file  is  never  stored  in  the disc. For more detail on this option see the FAQ
              document in the source tarball.

       <b>-r</b> <b>[hosts...]</b>
              Remote encode on this  comma-delimited  list  of  machines  using  <b>distmp3</b>.  See  the  REMOTEHOSTS
              configuration variable.

       <b>-s</b> <b>[fields...]</b>
              List,  separated  by commas, the fields to be shown in the CDDB parsed entries.  Right now it only
              uses "year" and "genre".

       <b>-S</b> <b>[speed]</b>
              Set the speed of the CD drive. Needs CDSPEED and CDSPEEDOPTS set properly and both the program and
              device must support the capability.

       <b>-t</b> <b>[number]</b>
              Start the numbering of the tracks at a given  number.  It  only  affects  the  filenames  and  the
              playlist. Internal (tag) numbering remains the same.

       <b>-T</b> <b>[number]</b>
              Same  as -t but changes also the internal (tag) numbering. Keep in mind that the default TRACK tag
              for MP3 is $T/$TRACKS so it is changed to simply $T.

       <b>-U</b>     Set CDDBPROTO to version 5, so that we retrieve ISO-8859-15 encoded CDDB information, and  we  tag
              and add comments with Latin1 encoding.

       <b>-v</b>     Show the version and exit

       <b>-V</b>     Be more verbose. On slow networks the CDDB requests might give the sensation nothing is happening.
              Add this more than once to make things even more verbose.

       <b>-x</b>     Eject the CD when all tracks have been read. See the EJECTCD configuration variable.

       <b>-X</b> <b>[cue2discid]</b>
              Use an alternative "cue2discid" implementation. The name of the binary must be exactly that. <b>abcde</b>
              comes with an implementation in python under the examples directory. The special keyword "builtin"
              forces the usage of the internal (default) implementation in shell script.

       <b>-w</b> <b>[comment]</b>
              Add a comment to the tracks ripped from the CD. If you wish to use parentheses, these will need to
              be escaped. i.e. you have to write "\(" instead of "(".

       <b>-W</b> <b>[number]</b>
              Concatenate  CD´s.  It  uses  the  number  provided  to  define a comment "CD #" and to modify the
              numbering of the tracks, starting with "#01". For Ogg/Vorbis and FLAC files,  it  also  defines  a
              DISCNUMBER tag.

       <b>-z</b>     DEBUG  mode:  it  will rip, using <b>cdparanoia</b>, the very first second of each track and proceed with
              the actions requested very quickly, also providing some "hidden" information about what happens on
              the background. CAUTION: IT WILL ERASE ANY EXISTING RIPS WITHOUT WARNING!

       <b>[tracks]</b>
              A list of tracks you want <b>abcde</b> to process. If this isn't specified, <b>abcde</b> will process the entire
              CD. Accepts ranges of track numbers - "abcde 1-5 7 9" will process tracks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       Each track is, by default, placed in a separate file named after the track in a subdirectory named  after
       the  artist  under  the current directory. This can be modified using the OUTPUTFORMAT and VAOUTPUTFORMAT
       variables in your <u>abcde.conf</u>. Each file is  given  an  extension  identifying   its  compression  format,
       'vorbis' for '.ogg', '.mp3', '.flac', '.spx', '.mpc', '.wav', '.wv', '.ape', '.opus', '.mka' or 'aiff'.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>abcde</b> sources two configuration files on startup - <u>/etc/abcde.conf</u> and <u>$HOME/.abcde.conf</u>, in that order.

       The  configuration  options stated in those files can be overridden by providing the appropriate flags at
       runtime.

       The configuration variables have to be set as follows:

       <b>VARIABLE=value</b>
              Except when "value" needs to be quoted or otherwise interpreted. If other variables within "value"
              are to be expanded upon reading the configuration file, then double quotes should be used. If they
              are only supposed to be expanded upon use (for example OUTPUTFORMAT) then single  quotes  must  be
              used.

       All shell escaping/quoting rules apply.

       Here is a list of options <b>abcde</b> recognizes:

       <b>CDDBMETHOD</b>
              Specifies  the  methods  we  want  to  use  to  retrieve  the  track information. Three values are
              recognized: "cddb", "musicbrainz" and "cdtext". List all the methods desired in a comma  delimited
              list  and  <b>abcde</b>  will  attempt them all, returning a list of all search results. The "cddb" value
              needs the CDDBURL and HELLOINFO variables described below. The "musicbrainz" value uses  the  Perl
              helper  script  <b>abcde-musicbrainz-tool</b> to establish a conversation with the Musicbrainz server for
              information retrieval. "cdtext" needs "icedax" or "cdda2wav" to be installed.

       <b>CDDBURL</b>
              Specifies a server to use for CDDB lookups.

       <b>CDDBPROTO</b>
              Specifies the protocol version used for the CDDB retrieval of results. Version  6  retrieves  CDDB
              entries in UTF-8 format.

       <b>HELLOINFO</b>
              Specifies the Hello information to send to the CDDB server. The CDDB protocol requires you to send
              a valid username and hostname each time you connect. The format of this is username@hostname.

       <b>CDDBLOCALDIR</b>
              Specifies  a  directory  where we store a local CDDB repository. The entries must be standard CDDB
              entries, with the filename being the DISCID value. Other CD playing  and  ripping  programs  (like
              Grip) store the entries under <u><a href="file:~/.cddb">~/.cddb</a></u> and we can make use of those entries.

       <b>CDDBLOCALRECURSIVE</b>
              Specifies  if  the CDDBLOCALDIR has to be searched recursively trying to find a match for the CDDB
              entry. If a match is found and selected, and CDDBCOPYLOCAL is selected, it will be copied  to  the
              root  of the CDDBLOCALDIR if CDDBLOCALPOLICY is "modified" or "new". The default "y" is needed for
              the local CDDB search to work.

       <b>CDDBLOCALPOLICY</b>
              Defines when a CDDB entry should be stored in the defined CDDBLOCALDIR. The possible policies are:
              "net" for a CDDB entry which has been received from the net (overwriting any possible  local  CDDB
              entry);  "new"  for a CDDB entry which was received from the net, but will request confirmation to
              overwrite a local CDDB entry found in the root of the CDDBLOCALDIR  directory;  "modified"  for  a
              CDDB  entry  found  in  the local repository but which has been modified by the user; and "always"
              which forces the CDDB entry to be stored back in the root of the CDDBLOCALDIR no matter  where  it
              was  found, and no matter it was not edited.  This last option will always overwrite the one found
              in the root of the local repository (if any). STILL NOT WORKING!!

       <b>CDDBCOPYLOCAL</b>
              Store local copies of the CDDB entries under the $CDDBLOCALDIR directory.

       <b>CDDBUSELOCAL</b>
              Actually use the stored copies of the CDDB entries. Can be overridden using the "-L" flag  (if  is
              CDDBUSELOCAL  in  "n"). If an entry is found, we always give the choice of retrieving a CDDB entry
              from the internet.

       <b>SHOWCDDBFIELDS</b>
              Coma-separated list of fields we want to parse during the CDDB parsing.  Defaults to "year,genre".

       <b>OGGENCODERSYNTAX</b>
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for the  Ogg/Vorbis  encoder.  Valid  options  are  ´oggenc´
              (default  for  Ogg/Vorbis)  and  ´vorbize´.   This affects the default location of the binary, the
              variable to pick encoder command-line options from, and where the options are given.

       <b>MP3ENCODERSYNTAX</b>
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for the MP3 encoder. Valid options are ´lame´  (default  for
              MP3),  ´gogo´,  ´bladeenc´,  ´l3enc´  and  ´mp3enc´.   Affects the same way as explained above for
              Ogg/Vorbis.

       <b>FLACENCODERSYNTAX</b>
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for the FLAC encoder. At this point only ´flac´ is available
              for FLAC encoding.

       <b>MP2ENCODERSYNTAX</b>
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for the MPEG-1 Audio Layer II (MP2) encoder.  At this  point
              both ´twolame´ and ´ffmpeg´ are available for MP2 encoding.

       <b>SPEEXENCODERSYNTAX</b>
              Specifies  the  style  of  encoder  to  use  for  Speex  encoder. At this point only ´speexenc´ is
              available for Ogg/Speex encoding.

       <b>MPCENCODERSYNTAX</b>
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for MPP/MP+ (Musepack) encoder. At this point we  only  have
              ´mpcenc´ available, from musepack.net.

       <b>AACENCODERSYNTAX</b>
              Specifies  the  style of encoder to use for M4A (AAC) encoder. We support ´fdkaac´ as ´default´ as
              well as FFmpeg or avconv, neroAacEnc, qaac and fhgaacenc. If qaac, refalac or FFmpeg / avconv  are
              used  it  is  also  possible  to generate Apple Lossless Audio Codec (alac) files. Note that qaac,
              refalac and fhgaacenc are Windows applications which require Wine to be installed.

       <b>TTAENCODERSYNTAX</b>
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for True Audio (tts) encoding. We support ´tta´  as  default
              but the older ´ttaenc´ can be used as well.

       <b>WVENCODERSYNTAX</b>
              Specifies  the  style  of  encoder  to  use  for  WavPack.  We  support ´wavpack´ as ´default´ but
              ´ffmpeg' is the other option (Note that this is for FFmpeg only as avconv does not have  a  native
              WavPack encoder).

       <b>APENCODERSYNTAX</b>
              Specifies  the  style of encoder to use for Monkey's Audio (ape). We support ´mac´, Monkey's Audio
              Console, as ´default´.

       <b>OPUSENCODERSYNTAX</b>
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for the Opus  encoder.  At  this  point  only  ´opusenc´  is
              available for Opus encoding.

       <b>MKAENCODERSYNTAX</b>
              Specifies  the  style  of  encoder  to  use  for the Matroska or mka container. At this point only
              ´ffmpeg´ is available to utilise the mka container. Safe audio codecs for mka include Vorbis, MP2,
              MP3, LC-AAC, HE-AAC, WMAv1, WMAv2, AC3, eAC3 and Opus.  See the FAQ document for more information.

       <b>AIFFENCODERSYNTAX</b>
              Specifies the style of encoder to use for Audio Interchange File Format  (AIFF).   At  this  point
              only ´ffmpeg´ is available to utilise the AIFF container.

       <b>NORMALIZERSYNTAX</b>
              Specifies  the  style of normalizer to use.  Valid options are ´default´ and ´normalize' (and both
              run ´normalize-audio´), since we only support it, ATM.

       <b>CDROMREADERSYNTAX</b>
              Specifies the style of cdrom reader to use. Valid options are ´cdparanoia´, ´libcdio' ´debug´  and
              ´flac´.  It  is used for querying the CDROM and obtain a list of valid tracks and DATA tracks. The
              special ´flac´ case is u sed to "rip" CD tracks from a single-track flac file.

       <b>CUEREADERSYNTAX</b>
              Specifies the syntax of the program we use to read the CD CUE sheet. Right  now  we  only  support
              ´mkcue´, but in the future other readers might be used.

       <b>KEEPWAVS</b>
              It  defaults  to no, so if you want to keep those wavs ripped from your CD, set it to "y". You can
              use the "-k" switch in the command line. The default behaviour with KEEPWAVS set is  to  keep  the
              temporary directory and the wav files even you have requested the "clean" action.

       <b>PADTRACKS</b>
              If  set  to  "y",  it  adds  0's  to the file numbers to complete a two-number holder. Useful when
              encoding tracks 1-9.

       <b>INTERACTIVE</b>
              Set to "n" if you want to perform automatic rips, without user intervention.

       <b>NICE</b> <b>VALUES</b>
              Define the values for priorities (nice values) for the different  CPU-hungry  processes:  encoding
              (ENCNICE), CDROM read (READNICE) and distributed encoder with <b>distmp3</b> (DISTMP3NICE).

       <b>PATHNAMES</b>
              The  following  configuration  file  options  specify the pathnames of their respective utilities:
              LAME, GOGO,  BLADEENC,  L3ENC,  XINGMP3ENC,  MP3ENC,  VORBIZE,  OGGENC,  FLAC,  SPEEXENC,  MPCENC,

       <b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
              If  you  wish to specify command-line options to any of the programs <b>abcde</b> uses, set the following
              configuration  file   options:   LAMEOPTS,   GOGOOPTS,   AIFFENCOPTS,   BLADEENCOPTS,   L3ENCOPTS,
              XINGMP3ENCOPTS,   MP3ENCOPTS,   VORBIZEOPTS,  WAVEPACKENCOPTS,  APENCOPTS,  OGGENCOPTS,  FLACOPTS,

              TWOLAMENCOPTS and TTAENCOPTS.

       <b>CDSPEEDVALUE</b>
              Set  the  value of the CDROM speed. The default is to read the disc as fast as the reading program
              and the system permits. The steps are defined as 150kB/s (1x).

       <b>ACTIONS</b>
              The default actions to be performed when reading a disc.

       <b>CDROM</b>  If set, it points to the CD-Rom device which has to be used for audio extraction. Abcde  tries  to
              guess  the  right  device, but it may fail. The special ´flac´ option is defined to extract tracks
              from a single-track flac file.

       <b>CDPARANOIACDROMBUS</b>
              Defined as "d" when using <b>cdparanoia</b> with an IDE bus and as "g" when  using  <b>cdparanoia</b>  with  the
              ide-scsi emulation layer.

       <b>OUTPUTDIR</b>
              Specifies the directory to place completed tracks/playlists in.

       <b>WAVOUTPUTDIR</b>
              Specifies  the  temporary directory to store .wav files in. Abcde may use up to 700MB of temporary
              space for each session (although it is rare to use over 100MB for a machine that can encode  music
              as fast as it can read it).

       <b>OUTPUTTYPE</b>
              Specifies the encoding format to output, as well as the default extension and encoder. Defaults to
              "vorbis".  Valid  settings  are  "vorbis" (or "ogg") (Ogg/Vorbis), "mp3" (MPEG-1 Audio Layer III),
              "flac" (Free Lossless Audio Codec), "mp2" (MPEG-1  Audio  Layer  III),  "spx"  (Ogg/Speex),  "mpc"
              (MPP/MP+ (Musepack), "m4a" (AAC or ALAC),"wv" (WavPack"), "wav" (Microsoft Waveform), "opus" (Opus
              Interactive  Audio  Codec), "tta" (True Audio), "mka" (Matroska) or "aiff" (Audio Interchange File
              Format). Values like "vorbis,mp3" encode the tracks  in  both  Ogg/Vorbis  and  MP3  formats.  For
              example:
              OUTPUTTYPE=vorbis,flac
              For  each value in OUTPUTTYPE, <b>abcde</b> expands a different process for encoding, tagging and moving,
              so you can use the format placeholder, OUTPUT, to create  different  subdirectories  to  hold  the
              different  types.  The  variable OUTPUT will be 'vorbis', 'mp3', 'flac', 'spx', 'mpc', 'm4a', mp2,
              'wv', 'ape', 'tta', 'wav',
              OUTPUTFORMAT='${OUTPUT}/${ARTISTFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}/${TRACKNUM}._${TRACKFILE}'

       <b>OUTPUTFORMAT</b>
              Specifies the format for completed Ogg/Vorbis, MP3, FLAC, Ogg/Speex,  MPP/MP+  (Musepack)  or  M4A
              filenames.  Variables  are  included  using  standard  shell  syntax. Allowed variables are GENRE,
              ALBUMFILE,     ARTISTFILE,      TRACKFILE,      TRACKNUM,      and      YEAR.      Default      is
              ´${ARTISTFILE}-${ALBUMFILE}/${TRACKNUM}-${TRACKFILE}´.  Make sure to use single quotes around this
              variable.  TRACKNUM is automatically zero-padded, when the number of encoded tracks is higher than
              9. When lower, you can force with '-p' in the command line.

       <b>VAOUTPUTFORMAT</b>
              Just    like    OUTPUTFORMAT    but    for    Various    Artists    discs.    The    default    is
              'Various-${ALBUMFILE}/${TRACKNUM}.${ARTISTFILE}-${TRACKFILE}'

       <b>ONETRACKOUTPUTFORMAT</b>
              Just   like   OUTPUTFORMAT   but   for  single-track  rips  (see  option  "-1").  The  default  is
              '${ARTISTFILE}-${ALBUMFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}'

       <b>VAONETRACKOUTPUTFORMAT</b>
              Just   like   ONETRACKOUTPUTFORMAT   but   for   Various   Artists   discs.   The    default    is
              'Various-${ALBUMFILE}/${ALBUMFILE}'

       <b>MAXPROCS</b>
              Defines  how many encoders to run at once. This makes for huge speedups on SMP systems. You should
              run one encoder per CPU at once for maximum efficiency, although more doesn't hurt very much.  Set
              it "0" when using mp3dist to avoid getting encoding processes in the local host.

       <b>LOWDISK</b>
              If  set  to  y,  conserves  disk  space by encoding tracks immediately after reading them. This is
              substantially slower than normal operation but requires several hundred MB less space to  complete
              the encoding of an entire CD. Use only if your system is low on space and cannot encode as quickly
              as it can read.

              Note  that  this option may also help when reading a CD with errors. This is because on a scratchy
              disk reading is quite timing sensitive and this option reduces the background load on  the  system
              which allows the ripping program more precise control.

       <b>BATCHNORM</b>
              If set to y, enables batch mode normalization, which preserves relative volume differences between
              tracks of an album. Also enables nogap encoding when using the ´lame´ encoder.

       <b>NOGAP</b>  Activate  the  lame's --nogap option, that allows files found in CDs with no silence between songs
              (such as live concerts) to be encoded without noticeable gaps. WARNING:  lame's  --nogap  disables
              the  Xing  mp3  tag.  This tag is required for mp3 players to correctly display track lengths when
              playing variable-bit-rate mp3 files.

       <b>PLAYLISTFORMAT</b>
              Specifies the format for completed playlist filenames. Works like the  OUTPUTFORMAT  configuration
              variable.  Default  is  ´${ARTISTFILE}_-_${ALBUMFILE}.m3u´.  Make sure to use single quotes around
              this variable.

       <b>PLAYLISTDATAPREFIX</b>
              Specifies a prefix for filenames within a playlist. Useful for http playlists, etc.

       <b>DOSPLAYLIST</b>
              If set, the resulting playlist will  have  CR-LF  line  endings,  needed  by  some  hardware-based
              players.

       <b>COMMENT</b>
              Specifies  a comment to embed in the ID3 or Ogg comment field of each finished track. Can be up to
              28 characters long. Supports the same syntax as OUTPUTFORMAT. Does not currently support ID3v2.

       <b>REMOTEHOSTS</b>
              Specifies a comma-delimited list of systems to use for remote encoding using  <b>distmp3</b>.  Equivalent
              to -r.

       <b>mungefilename</b>
              mungefilename()  is  an  <b>abcde</b> shell function that can be overridden via <u>abcde.conf</u>. It takes CDDB
              data as $1 and outputs the resulting filename on stdout. It defaults  to  deleting  any  preceding
              dots  to  filename,  replacing  spaces  with  an  underscore and eating characters which variously
              Windows and Linux do not permit.
              If you modify this function, it is probably a good idea to keep the forward  slash  munging  (UNIX
              cannot store a file with a '/' char in it) as well as the control character munging (NULs can't be
              in a filename either, and newlines and such in filenames are typically not desirable).
              New  to  abcde  2.7.3  are  the  user  definable  functions  mungetrackname,  mungeartistname  and
              mungealbumname which default to mungefilename. These permit finer-grained control of  track  name,
              artist name and album name for the ultra-fastidious.

       <b>mungegenre</b>
              mungegenre  ()  is  a  shell  function used to modify the $GENRE variable. As a default action, it
              takes $GENRE as $1 and outputs the resulting value to stdout converting all  UPPERCASE  characters
              to lowercase.

       <b>pre_read</b>
              pre_read  ()  is  a  shell function which is executed before the CDROM is read for the first time,
              during <b>abcde</b> execution. It can be used to close the CDROM tray, to set its speed (via  "setcd"  or
              via "eject", if available) and other preparation actions. The default function is empty.

       <b>post_read</b>
              post_read  ()  is  a  shell  function  which is executed after the CDROM is read (and, if applies,
              before the CDROM is ejected). It can be used to read a TOC from the CDROM, or to try to  read  the
              DATA areas from the CD (if any exist).  The default function is empty.

       <b>post_encode</b>
              post_encode  ()  is a shell function which is executed after the encoding process.  It can be used
              to move completed files to another location, run any sort of testing on  the  completed  files  or
              embed  album  art  if  the built in embedding provided by abcde's embedalbumart function is not to
              your taste.  The default function is empty.

       <b>EJECTCD</b>
              If set to "y", <b>abcde</b> will call <b><a href="../man1/eject.1.html">eject</a></b>(1) to eject the cdrom from the drive after  all  tracks  have
              been read. It has no effect when CDROM is set to a flac file.

       <b>EXTRAVERBOSE</b>
              If  set  to  "1", some operations which are usually now shown to the end user are visible, such as
              CDDB queries. Useful for initial debug and if your network/CDDB server is slow. Set to "2" or more
              for even more verbose output.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Possible ways one can call <b>abcde</b>:

       <b>abcde</b>  Will work in most systems

       <b>abcde</b> <b>-d</b> <b>/dev/cdrom2</b>
              If the CDROM you are reading from is not the standard <u>/dev/cdrom</u> (in GNU/Linux systems)

       <b>abcde</b> <b>-o</b> <b>vorbis,flac</b>
              Will create both Ogg/Vorbis and Ogg/FLAC files.

       <b>abcde</b> <b>-o</b> <b>vorbis:"-b</b> <b>192"</b>
              Will pass "-b 192" to the Ogg/Vorbis encoder, without having to modify the config file

       <b>abcde</b> <b>-o</b> <b>mp3,flac,m4a,wv,ogg</b> <b>-B</b>
              abcde will create mp3, flac, m4a, wv and ogg files and also select suitable  album  art,  download
              and embed the album art into all 5 sets of tracks.

       <b>abcde</b> <b>-W</b> <b>1</b>
              For double+ CD settings: will create the 1st CD starting with the track number 101, and will add a
              comment "CD 1" to the tracks, the second starting with 201 and so on.

       <b>abcde</b> <b>-d</b> <b>singletrack.flac</b> <b>-o</b> <b>vorbis:"-q</b> <b>6"</b>
              Will  extract  the  files  contained in singletrack FLAC file using the embedded cuesheet and then
              encode the output files to Ogg/Vorbis with a quality setting of 6.

</pre><h4><b>BACKEND</b> <b>TOOLS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>abcde</b> requires the following backend tools to work:

       <b>*</b>      An Ogg/Vorbis, MP3, FLAC, Ogg/Speex, MPP/MP+(Musepack),  M4A  encoder  or  Opus  encoder  (oggenc,
              vorbize,  lame,  gogo,  bladeenc, l3enc, mp3enc, flac, speexenc, mpcenc, fdkaac, neroAacEnc, faac,
              wavpack, opusenc).

       <b>*</b>      An audio CD reading utility (cdparanoia, icedax, cdda2wav, libcdio (cd-paranoia),  pird,  dagrab).
              To read CD-TEXT information, icedax or cdda2wav will be needed.

       <b>*</b>      cd-discid, a CDDB DiscID reading program.

       <b>*</b>      An  HTTP retrieval program: wget, fetch (FreeBSD) or curl (Mac OS X, among others). Alternatively,
              abcde-musicbrainz-tool (which depends on Perl and some  Musicbrainz  libraries)  can  be  used  to
              retrieve CDDB information about the CD.

       <b>*</b>      (for MP3s) id3 or eyeD3, id3 v1 and v2 tagging programs.

       <b>*</b>      For Monkey's Audio (ape) tagging Robert Muth's 'apetag' is required.

       <b>*</b>      To retrieve album art a glyrc package is required and optionally the ImageMagick package should be
              installed.

       <b>*</b>      (optional) distmp3, a client/server for distributed mp3 encoding.

       <b>*</b>      (optional) normalize-audio, a WAV file volume normalizer.

       <b>*</b>      (optional) a replaygain file volume modifier (vorbisgain, metaflac, mp3gain, mpcgain, wvgain),

       <b>*</b>      (optional) mkcue, a CD cuesheet extractor.
