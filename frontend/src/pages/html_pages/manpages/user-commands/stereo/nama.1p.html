</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Nama - multitrack recorder and digital audio workstation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nama</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>project-name</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A multitrack audio application for recording, effects processing, editing, mixing, mastering and live
       performance. It can also perform general-purpose audio processing, such as 5.1 to stereo conversion. Nama
       uses Ecasound as the audio processing engine.

   <b>Audio</b> <b>projects</b>
       Projects in Nama are audio networks of tracks and buses.  Tracks may contain one or more RIFF (.wav)
       files, as well as effects, sends, inserts, marks, regions, fades, edits and sequences.  Tracks can host
       LADSPA, LV2 and Ecasound plugins.  Audio regions may be altered, duplicated, time-shifted or replaced.

       Audio processing is performed in realtime when a track is played and may be cached (frozen) to a new
       audio file.

       Project data is serialized as JSON. The complete history is tracked by the git version control system.
       As a result, projects can be managed using branches and tags, and provide undo/redo.

       Nama supports some MIDI functionality via midish.

   <b>Presets</b> <b>and</b> <b>templates</b>
       To facilitate reuse, a track's plugins and inserts can be stored as an <u>effect</u> <u>chain</u>. <u>Effect</u> <u>profiles</u>
       apply effect chains to groups of tracks.  <u>Project</u> <u>templates</u> are for duplicating an entire project sans
       audio files.

   <b>Audio</b> <b>device</b>
       Nama performs Audio IO via JACK or ALSA. Soundcard IO goes via JACK, if running, with transparent
       fallback to ALSA.

       Nama supports Ladish Level 1 session handling.

   <b>User</b> <b>interfaces</b>
       Nama has fully featured terminal command prompt, a Tk GUI, and experimental OSC and remote-command modes.

       The command prompt can run Nama commands, Ecasound interactive-mode commands, commands for the midish
       MIDI recorder/player, shell commands and perl code.  Commands and filenames can be autocompleted using
       the TAB key. Command history is available to browse with up and down arrows.

       The help system provides documentation and keyword search covering Nama commands and effects-processing
       plugins.

       The hotkey mode provides a convenient way to select, view, and modify effect parameters.

</pre><h4><b>CONTROLLING</b> <b>NAMA/ECASOUND</b></h4><pre>
       The  Ecasound  audio  engine  is configured through use of <u>chain</u> <u>setups</u> that define the signal processing
       network.

       Nama serves as an intermediary, taking high-level user commands, generating chain setups for  user  tasks
       such as recording, playback, mixing, etc., and running the audio engine.

   <b>Configuration</b> <b>Commands</b>
       Configuration  commands  affect  <u>future</u>  runs  of  the audio engine.  For example, <b>rec,</b> <b>play,</b> <b>mon</b> and <b>off</b>
       determine whether the current track will get its audio  stream  from  an  external  (e.g.  live)  source,
       whether  an  existing audio file will be played back, and whether a new audio file will be recorded. Nama
       responds to these commands by reconfiguring the engine and displaying the updated track status. See  'man
       ::ChainSetup' for details on how the chain setup created.

   <b>Realtime</b> <b>Commands</b>
       Once  a  chain setup is loaded and the engine is launched, commands can be issued to control the realtime
       behavior of the audio processing engine. These commands include transport "start"  and  "stop",  playback
       head  repositioning  commands  such  "forward",  "rewind" and "setpos". Effects may be added, modified or
       removed while the engine is running.

   <b>Configuration</b>
       General configuration of sound devices and program options is performed  by  editing  the  <u>.namarc</u>  file,
       which  is  formatted  as  YAML. On Nama's first run, a default version of <u>.namarc</u> is placed in the user's
       home directory.

</pre><h4><b>Tk</b> <b>GRAPHICAL</b> <b>UI</b></h4><pre>
       Invoked by default if Tk is installed, this interface provides a subset of Nama's  functionality  on  two
       windows:

   <b>Main</b> <b>Window</b>
       The  top  section has buttons for creating, loading and saving projects, adding tracks, adding effects to
       tracks. In short, for setup.

       Below are buttons for controlling the transport (start, stop and friends) and for setting marks.

       The GUI project name bar and time display change color to indicate whether the  upcoming  operation  will
       include live recording (red), mixdown (yellow) or playback (green).

   <b>Effects</b> <b>Window</b>
       The  <b>effects</b>  <b>window</b> provides sliders for each effect parameter of each track. Parameter range, defaults,
       and log/linear scaling hints are automatically detected. Text-entry widgets are used to enter  parameters
       values  for  plugins  without  hinted  ranges.  Any  parameter  label  can  be clicked to add a parameter
       controller.

   <b>Waveform</b> <b>Window</b>
       Provides a conventional view with waveform and playback head.

   <b>Terminal</b> <b>Window</b>
       The command prompt is available the terminal window and provides access to all of Nama's functions.

</pre><h4><b>TEXT</b> <b>USER</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       Press the <u>Enter</u> key if necessary to get the command prompt, which will look something like this:

                   "nama untitled sax ('h' for help)&gt;"

       In this instance, 'sax' is the current track in the 'untitled' default project.

       When using buses, the bus is indicated before the track:

                   "nama untitled Strings/violin ('h' for help)&gt;"

       At the prompt, you can enter Nama and Ecasound commands, Perl code  preceded  by  "eval"  or  shell  code
       preceded by "!".

       Multiple commands on a single line are allowed if delimited by semicolons. Usually the lines are split on
       semicolons  and  the  parts  are executed sequentially, however if the line begins with "eval" or "!" the
       entire line (up to double semicolons ';;' if present) will be given to the corresponding interpreter.

       You can access command history using up-arrow/down-arrow.

       Type "help" for general help, "help command" for help with "command", "help foo" for help  with  commands
       containing  the  string "foo". "help-effect foo bar" lists all plugins/presets/controller containing both
       <u>foo</u>   and   <u>bar</u>.   Tab-completion   is   provided   for    Nama    commands,    Ecasound-iam    commands,
       plugin/preset/controller names, and project names.

       Most commands have abbreviations, such as 'afx' for 'add-effect'. These are shown in the help listings.

</pre><h4><b>TRACKS</b></h4><pre>
       Each  track  has  a  descriptive name (i.e. vocal) and an integer track-number assigned when the track is
       created.  New user tracks initially belong to the Main bus.

       Track output signals are usually mixed and pass through the Main  track  on  the  way  to  soundcard  for
       monitoring.

       The following sections describes track attributes and their effects.

   <b>Width</b>
       Specifying  'mono' means the track has one input channel, which will be recorded as a mono WAV file. Mono
       track signals are automatically duplicated to stereo and a pan effect is provided.

       Specifying 'stereo' for a track means that two channels of audio input will be recorded as an interleaved
       stereo WAV file.  You can also use a 'stereo' declaration to avoid the  automatic  channel  copy  usually
       applied to single-channel sources.

       Specifying  N  channels for a track ('set width N') means N successive input channels will be recorded as
       an N-channel interleaved WAV file.

   <b>REC/PLAY/MON/OFF</b>
       Basic signal routing for each track is controlled by its setting to REC, MON, PLAY or OFF.

       The <u>MON</u> setting prepares to connect the live track source.

       The <u>REC</u> setting prepares to connect the live track source and record it to an audio file.

       The <u>PLAY</u> setting enqueues an audio file for playback from disk as the track source.

       The <u>OFF</u> setting tells Nama to remove the track from the audio network. <u>OFF</u> status may result for a  track
       when no audio source is available. For example, a track with no recorded audio files will show OFF status
       when set to PLAY.

   <b>Track</b> <b>output</b>
       By  default  a track belongs to the Main bus and is routed to the Main track. This track provides a final
       fader before the signal goes via ALSA or JACK to the audio device.

   <b>Bus</b> <b>setting</b>
       Buses can force the status of their member tracks to OFF.  Nama provides MON and OFF settings for  buses.
       OFF  (set  by  "bus-off")  removes all member tracks from the chain setup, MON (set by "bus-mon" restores
       them.

       The <b>mixplay</b> command sets the Mixdown track to PLAY and the Main bus to OFF.

   <b>Version</b> <b>Numbers</b>
       Multiple audio files ("takes") can be recorded for each track.  These  are  distinguished  by  a  version
       number that increments with each recording run, i.e. <u>sax_1.wav</u>, <u>sax_2.wav</u>, etc.  All audio files recorded
       in the same run have the same version number.

       The  version  numbers  for  track  playback can be selected at the bus or track level. By setting the bus
       version to 5, you can play back version 5 of several tracks at once. Version 5 could  signify  the  fifth
       take of a song, or the fifth song of a live recording session.

       The  track  version  setting, if present, overrides the bus version setting. Setting the track version to
       zero restores control of the version number to the bus.

       The Main bus version setting does <u>not</u> propagate to other buses.

   <b>Marks</b>
       Marks in Nama are similar to those in other audio editing software. One limitation is that mark positions
       are relative to the beginning of an Ecasound chain setup. If your project involves a  single  track,  and
       you  will be shortening the stream by setting a region to play, set any marks you need <u>after</u> defining the
       region.

   <b>Regions</b>
       The "region" command allows you to define endpoints for a portion of an audio file.  You can then use the
       "shift" command to move the region to the desired time position.

       If you use named marks as endpoints, the region will change if the mark's position is adjusted.

       Each track can have one region definition. To create multiple regions, the "new-region" command  takes  a
       pair of marks to create a read-only copy of the current track with the specified region definition.

       You  can  control  this  region  as  you  would  any other other track, shifting the start time, applying
       effects, adjusting volume, etc.

       <u>Using</u> <u>Tracks</u> <u>from</u> <u>Other</u> <u>Projects</u>

       The "link-track" clones a read-only track from another track, which may belong to a different project.

   <b>Effects</b>
       Each track gets volume and pan effects by default.  New effects  added  using  "add-effect"  are  applied
       before  pan  volume  controls.   You  can  position  effects anywhere you choose using "insert_effect" or
       "position-effect".

       <u>Fades</u>

       Fades can be placed on any track. They defined by  mark  position  and  duration.  An  additional  volume
       operator, -eadb, is applied to each track to host the envelope controller that implements fades.

       <u>Sends</u> <u>and</u> <u>Inserts</u>

       The  "send"  command  can  route  a  track's  post-fader  output to a soundcard channel or JACK client in
       addition to the normal mixer input. Nama currently allows one aux send per track.

       The "add-insert" command configures a pre- or post-fader send-and-return to soundcard  channels  or  JACK
       clients.  Wet and dry signal paths are provided, with a default setting of 100% wet.

       Each track can have one pre-fader and one post-fader insert.

   <b>Bunches</b>
       A  bunch  is  just a list of track names. Using the "for" keyword with the name of a bunch will apply the
       commands that follow to all of the tracks in the bunch. A bunch  can  be  created  with  the  "new-bunch"
       command. A bus name can also be treated as a bunch.

   <b>Buses</b>
       <b>Buses</b>  enable  multiple  tracks to be routed through a single mix track before feeding the Main mixer bus
       (or possibly, another bus.)

       The following commands create a bus and assign three tracks to it. The mix track takes the  name  of  the
       bus and is stereo by default.

               # create a bus named Strings with a same-named mix track
               add-bus Strings

               # create tracks for the bus
               add-tracks violin cello bass

               # move the tracks from the Main bus (default) to the Strings bus
               for violin cello bass; move-to-bus Strings

               # use the mix track to control bus output volume
               Strings vol - 10

       <u>Submixes</u>

       <b>Submixes</b> are a type of bus used to provide instrument monitors, or to send the outputs from multiple user
       tracks to an external program such as jconverter.

</pre><h4><b>ROUTING</b></h4><pre>
   <b>General</b> <b>Notes</b>
       While Nama can address tracks by either name and track number, Ecasound chain setups use the track number
       exclusively.

       The Main track (mixer output) is always chain 1, the Mixdown track is always chain 2.

       Nama  uses  Ecasound  loop  devices  where necessary to connect two tracks, or to allow one track to have
       multiple inputs or outputs. Each loop device adds one buffer, which increases latency.

   <b>Flow</b> <b>Diagrams</b>
       Let's examine the signal flow from track 3, the first available user  track.  Assume  track  3  is  named
       "sax".

       We will divide the signal flow into track and mixer sections.  Parentheses show the chain id.

       The stereo outputs of each user track terminate at Main_in, a loop device at the mixer input.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>REC</u> <u>status</u>

           Sound device   --+---(3)----&gt; Main_in
             /JACK client   |
                            +---(R3)---&gt; sax_1.wav

       REC status indicates that the source of the signal is the soundcard or JACK client. The input signal will
       be written directly to a file except in the special preview and doodle modes.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>PLAY</u> <u>status</u>

           sax_1.wav ------(3)----&gt; Main_in

       <u>Mixer,</u> <u>with</u> <u>mixdown</u> <u>enabled</u>

       In  the second part of the flow graph, the mixed signal is delivered to an output device through the Main
       chain, which can host effects. Usually the Main track provides  final  control  before  audio  output  or
       mixdown.

           Main_in --(1)--&gt; Main_out --+--------&gt; Sound device
                                       |
                                       +--&gt;(2)--&gt; Mixdown_1.wav

       <u>Mastering</u> <u>Mode</u>

       In  mastering  mode (invoked by "master-on" and released "master-off") the following network receives the
       Main track signal as input and provides an output to the soundcard or WAV file.

                            +- Low -+
                            |       |
           Main_in --- Eq --+- Mid -+--- Boost -&gt; soundcard/wav_out
                            |       |
                            +- High +

       The <b>Eq</b> track hosts an equalizer.

       The <b>Low</b>, <b>Mid</b> and <b>High</b> tracks each apply a bandpass filter, a compressor and a spatialiser.

       The <b>Boost</b> track applies gain and a limiter.

       These effects and their default parameters are defined in the configuration file <u>.namarc</u>.

   <b>Mixdown</b>
       The "mixdown" command configures Nama for mixdown. The  Mixdown  track  is  set  to  REC  (equivalent  to
       "Mixdown rec") and the audio monitoring output is turned off (equivalent to "Main off").

       Mixdown proceeds after you start the transport.

       As  a  convenience,  Mixdown_nn.wav will be symlinked to <u>&lt;project-name</u>_nn.wav&gt; or <u>&lt;branch_name</u>_nn.wav&gt; in
       the project directory. The latter format  is  used  branches  other  than  the  default  <u>master</u>  branch.)
       Corresponding  encoded  files  are created if the <u>mixdown_encodings</u> option is set in <u>.namarc</u>.  Acceptable
       values are a space-separated list. The default is "mixdown_encodings: ogg mp3".

   <b>Preview,</b> <b>Doodle</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eager</b> <b>Modes</b>
       These non-recording modes, invoked by "preview" and "doodle" commands tweak the routing rules for special
       purposes. <b>Preview</b> <b>mode</b> disables recording of WAV files to disk. <b>Doodle</b> <b>mode</b> disables  PLAY  inputs  while
       excluding  any  tracks  with the same source as a currently routed track. The "arm" command releases both
       preview and doodle modes.

       The eager setting causes the engine to start immediately following a reconfiguration.

   <b>Saving</b> <b>Projects</b>
       If git is available, projects are saved automatically after each command  and  it  is  not  necessary  to
       explicitly save your work.

       When  you  type  "save", Settings related to the state of the project are saved in the file <u>State.json</u> in
       the project directory. <u>State.json</u> is tracked by git.

       "save" updates several other data files as well:

       <u>Aux.json</u>, also in the project directory, contains data that is part  of  the  project  (such  as  command
       history, track comments, and current operating modes) but with no direct effect on the project audio.

       <u>global_effect_chains.json</u>,  in  the  project  root  directory  (usually  <u><a href="file:~/nama">~/nama</a></u>) contains system and user
       defined effect chains.

       <u>Save</u> <u>without</u> <u>Git</u>

       "save somename.json" will save project state to a file of that name.  Similarly "get somename.json"  will
       load the corresponding file. The <u>.json</u> suffix may be omitted if "use_git: 0" is set in <u>.namarc</u>.

       <u>Save</u> <u>with</u> <u>Git</u>

       If git is available, Nama uses it to store snapshots of every step in the history of your project.

       When  you  type  "save initial-mix", the latest snapshot is tagged with the name "initial-mix", which you
       can recall later with the command "get initial-mix".

       You can include a comment with the snapshot:

       "save initial-mix "sounds good enough to send to the front office""

       Nama lets you create new branches, starting at any snapshot.

       To start a new branch called <u>compressed-mix</u> starting at a snapshot called <u>initial-mix</u> you would say:

       "new-branch compressed-mix initial-mix"

       If you want to go back to working on the master branch, use "branch master".

       You can also issue native git commands at the Nama prompt.

       <u>Git</u> <u>history</u> <u>example</u>

       All projects begin on the "master" branch. Because this is the default branch, it is not displayed in the
       prompt.  Otherwise "master" is not special in any way.

       In the graphs below, the letters indicate named snapshots.

           create test-project
           ...
           save a
           ...
           save b
           ...
           save c

           ---a---b---c (master)

           get a
           ...
           save d
           ...
           save e
           ...
           save f

                  d---e---f (a-branch)
                 /
           -----a----b---c (master)

       Now, you want to go back to try something different at "c":

           get c
           ...
           save g

                 d---e---f (a-branch)

           ----a----b---c (master)
                         \
                          g (c-branch CURRENT HEAD)

       You could also go back to master, and restart from there:

           get master
           ...
           save h
           ...
           save i

           ----a----b---c---h---i (master CURRENT HEAD)
                         \
                          g (c-branch)

       Merging of branches is not supported.

   <b>Exiting</b>
       When you type "quit" Nama will automatically save your  work  to  <u>State.json</u>.  If  you  <u>don't</u>  want  this
       behavior, use Ctrl-C to exit Nama.

   <b>Jack</b> <b>ports</b> <b>list</b> <b>file</b>
       Use  <u>source</u>  <u>filename.ports</u> to ask Nama to connect multiple JACK ports listed in a file <u>filename.ports</u> to
       the input port(s) of that track.

       If the track is stereo, ports from the list are alternately connected to left and right channels.

   <b>Track</b> <b>edits</b>
       An edit consists of audio clips and data structures associated with a particular track and  version.  The
       edit  replaces part of the original audio file, allowing you to fix wrong notes, or substitute one phrase
       for another.  Behind the scenes, the host track becomes the mix track to a bus. Sources for the  bus  are
       the original audio track, and zero or more edits, each represented by a hidden track.

       Each  track  can  host  multiple  edits. Edits are non-destructive; they are achieved by using Ecasound's
       ability to crossfade and sequence.

       Before creating the edit, select the track and version to be edited.  You will now need to  create  three
       marks:

       •   play start point =item * rec start point =item * rec end point

       The edit will replace the audio between the rec start and rec end points.

       There are two ways to set these points.

       <u>set-edit-points</u> <u>command</u>

       Position  the  playback head a few seconds before the edit.  Enter the <u>set-edit-points</u> command. This will
       start the engine. Hit the <b>P</b> key three times to designate  the  playback  start,  punch-in  and  punch-out
       positions.

       <u>Specify</u> <u>points</u> <u>individually</u>

       Position  the  playback head at the position you want playback for the edit to start. Enter the <u>set-play-</u>
       <u>start-mark</u> command.

       Use the same procedure to set the rec start and rec end positions using the <u>set-rec-start-mark</u>  and  <u>set-</u>
       <u>rec-end-mark</u> commands.

       <u>Create</u> <u>the</u> <u>edit</u>

       Enter the <u>new-edit</u> command to create the necessary tracks and data structures.

       Use  <u>preview-edit</u>  to  confirm  the edit positions.  The engine will run and you will hear the host track
       with the target region removed. Playback will be restricted to the edit region. You may  use  <u>preview_out</u>
       to hear the clip to be removed.

       Use <u>list-marks</u> to see the edit marks and <u>modify-mark</u> to nudge them into perfect position.

       Once you are satisfied with the mark positions, you are ready to record your edit.

       Enter  <u>start-edit</u>.  Playback  will  begin  at  first mark. The replacement clip will be recorded from the
       source specified in the original track.

       Each <u>start-edit</u> command will record an additional version  on  the  edit  track.  <u>redo-edit</u>  will  delete
       (destructively) the most recent audio clip and begin recording anew.

       <u>destroy-edit</u> deletes (destructively) the current edit.

       You  may specify another range for editing and use the editing procedure again as many times as you like.
       Edits on one track may not overlap.

       <u>Merging</u> <u>edits</u>

       <u>merge-edits</u> will recursively merge all edits applied to the current track and  version,  creating  a  new
       version  for  the  track.   This  will  freeze your edits against an accidental change in mark, region or
       version settings.

       <u>list-edits</u> will label the edits by index and time.

       <u>end-edit-mode</u> will restore normal playback mode

</pre><h4><b>REMOTE</b> <b>CONTROL</b></h4><pre>
       You can send commands to Nama from a remote process, and retrieve the result. Understand that  this  code
       opens a remote execution hole.

       In <u>.namarc</u> you need something like:

             remote_control_port: 57000

       Then Nama will set up a listener for remote commands.

       The usual return value will be a single newline.

       However,  if you send an 'eval' command followed by perl code, the return value will be the result of the
       perl code executed with a newline appended. If the result is a list, the items will be joined  by  spaces
       into a single string.

       For example, if you send this string:

             eval $this_track-&gt;name

       The return value will be the name of the current track.

       If the result is an object or data structure, it will be returned in a serialized form.

       <b>compose</b> (compose-sequence compose-into-sequence) - Compose a new sequence  using  the  region(s)  of  the
       named  track  defined  by  mark  pair(s). If the sequence of that name exists, append the regions to that
       sequence (compose-into-sequence).

</pre><h4><b>REALTIME</b> <b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       Nama selects realtime or nonrealtime parameters based on the  <b>realtime_profile</b>,  <b>ecasound_buffersize</b>  and
       <b>ecasound_globals</b>  fields in <u>.namarc</u>. You can optionally specify the buffersizes as a multiple of the JACK
       period size. Note that for  best  realtime  operation  under  JACK  you  will  have  to  configure  jackd
       appropriately as well.

       The  <b>realtime</b>  and  <b>auto</b>  profiles  are  useful  when  using Nama/Ecasound for live fx processing or live
       monitoring.

       The <b>realtime</b> profile sets a small buffersize and other low latency settings whenever a soundcard or  JACK
       client is connected.

       The  <b>nonrealtime</b>  profile  uses  a  bigger buffer, providing extended margins for stable operation. It is
       suitable for post-processing, or for recording without live monitoring responsibilities.

       The <b>auto</b> profile defaults to nonrealtime settings. It switches to realtime, low-latency settings  when  a
       track has a live input.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       On  any  change  in  setup,  the  GUI display updates and "show-tracks" command is executed automatically
       showing what to expect the next time the engine is started.

       You can use the "chains" command to verify the Ecasound chain setup. (The  Ecasound  command  "cs-save-as
       mysetup.ecs" will additionally store all engine data, effects as well as routing.)

       The "dump" command displays data for the current track.  The "dumpall" command shows all state that would
       be saved.

       This is the same output that is written to the <u>State.yml</u> file when you issue the "save" command.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       No latency compensation across signal paths is provided at present. This feature is under development.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b> <b>CONCERNS</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  are  using  Nama with the NetECI interface (i.e. if Audio::Ecasound is <u>not</u> installed) you should
       block TCP port 2868 if your computer is exposed to the Internet.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       The following commands, available on Unixlike systems with Perl installed, will pull in  Nama  and  other
       Perl libraries required for text mode operation:

       "cpanm Audio::Nama" -or- "PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 cpan Audio::Nama"

       To use the GUI, you will need to install Tk:

       "cpanm Tk"

       You may want to install Audio::Ecasound if you prefer not to run Ecasound in server mode:

       "cpanm Audio::Ecasound"

       You can pull the source code as follows:

       "git clone git://github.com/bolangi/nama.git"

       Consult the <u>BUILD</u> file for build instructions.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       The Nama mailing list is a suitable forum for questions regarding Nama installation, usage, bugs, feature
       requests, etc.
