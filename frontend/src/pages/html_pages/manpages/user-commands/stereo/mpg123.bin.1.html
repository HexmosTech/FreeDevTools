</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mpg123 - play audio MPEG 1.0/2.0/2.5 stream (layers 1, 2 and 3)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mpg123</b> [ <u>options</u> ] <u>file-or-URL</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mpg123</b>  reads  one  or more <u>file</u>s (or standard input if ``-'' is specified) or <u>URL</u>s and plays them on the
       audio device (default) or outputs them to stdout.  <u>file</u>/<u>URL</u> is assumed to be an MPEG audio bit stream.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands are supported:

       <u>file</u>(s) The path name(s) of one or more input files.  They must be valid MPEG-1.0/2.0/2.5 audio layer  1,
               2  or  3  bit  streams.   If  a dash ``-'' is specified, MPEG data will be read from the standard
               input.  Furthermore, any name starting with ``http://'' or ``https://'' is recognized as <u>URL</u> (see
               next section), while a leading ``file://'' is being stripped for normal local  file  access,  for
               consistency (since mpg123 1.30.1).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mpg123</b>  options  may  be  either the traditional POSIX one letter options, or the GNU style long options.
       POSIX style options start with a single  ``-'',  while  GNU  long  options  start  with  ``--''.   Option
       arguments  (if  needed) follow separated by whitespace (not ``='').  Note that some options can be absent
       from your installation when disabled in the build process.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-k</b> <u>num</u>, <b>--skip</b> <u>num</u>
              Skip first <u>num</u> frames.  By default the decoding starts at the first frame.

       <b>-n</b> <u>num</u>, <b>--frames</b> <u>num</u>
              Decode only <u>num</u> frames.  By default the complete stream is decoded.

       <b>--fuzzy</b>
              Enable fuzzy seeks (guessing byte offsets  or  using  approximate  seek  points  from  Xing  TOC).
              Without that, seeks need a first scan through the file before they can jump at positions.  You can
              decide here: sample-accurate operation with gapless features or faster (fuzzy) seeking.

       <b>-y</b>, <b>--no-resync</b>
              Do  NOT try to resync and continue decoding if an error occurs in the input file. Normally, <b>mpg123</b>
              tries to keep the playback alive at all costs, including skipping invalid material  and  searching
              new  header  when  something goes wrong.  With this switch you can make it bail out on data errors
              (and perhaps spare your ears a bad time). Note that this switch has been  renamed  from  --resync.
              The  old  name  still  works,  but  is not advertised or recommended to use (subject to removal in
              future).

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--no-frankenstein</b>
              Disable support for Frankenstein streams. Normally, mpg123 stays true to the concept of MPEG audio
              being just a concatenation of MPEG frames. It will continue decoding even  if  the  type  of  MPEG
              frames  varies  wildly.  With  this  switch,  it will only decode the input as long as it does not
              change its character (from layer I to layer III, changing sampling rate,  from  mono  to  stereo),
              silently  assuming  end  of  stream on such occasion. The switch also stops decoding of compatible
              MPEG frames if there was an Info frame (Xing header, Lame tag) that  contained  a  length  of  the
              track in MPEG frames.  This comes a bit closer to the notion of a MP3 file as a defined collection
              of  MPEG frames that belong together, but gets rid of the flexibility that can be fun at times but
              mostly is hell for the programmer of the parser and decoder ...

       <b>--network</b>  <u>backend</u>
              Select network  backend (helper program), choices are usually auto, wget, and curl.  Auto means to
              try the first available backend.

       <b>--resync-limit</b> <u>bytes</u>
              Set number of bytes to search for valid MPEG data once lost  in  stream;  &lt;0  means  search  whole
              stream.   If  you know there are huge chunks of invalid data in your files... here is your hammer.
              Note: Only since version 1.14 this also increases the amount of junk skipped on beginning.

       <b>-u</b> <u>auth</u>, <b>--auth</b> <u>auth</u>
              HTTP authentication to use when receiving files via  HTTP.   The  format  used  is  user:password.
              Mpg123  will  clear  this quickly, but it may still appear in sight of other users or even just in
              your shell history. You may seek alternative ways to specify that to your network backend.

       <b>--auth-file</b> <u>authfile</u>
              Provide the authentication info via given file instead of command line directly.

       <b>--ignore-mime</b>
              Ignore MIME types given by HTTP server. If you know better and want mpg123 to decode something the
              server thinks is image/png, then just do it.

       <b>--no-icy-meta</b>
              Do not accept ICY meta data.

       <b>--streamdump</b> <u>filename</u>
              Dump a copy of the input data (as read by libmpg123) to the given file.  This enables you to store
              a web stream to disk while playing, or just create a concatenation of the local files you play for
              ... why not?

       <b>--icy-interval</b> <u>bytes</u>
              This setting enables you to play a stream dump containing ICY metadata at the  given  interval  in
              bytes  (the  value  of the icy-metaint HTTP response header). Without it, such a stream will play,
              but will cause regular decoding glitches with resync.

       <b>--no-seekbuffer</b>
              Disable the default micro-buffering of non-seekable streams that gives the parser a safer footing.

       <b>-@</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--list</b> <u>file</u>
              Read filenames and/or URLs of MPEG audio streams from the specified <u>file</u> in addition to  the  ones
              specified  on  the  command  line (if any).  Note that <u>file</u> can be either an ordinary file, a dash
              ``-'' to indicate that a list of filenames/URLs is to be read from the standard input, or  an  URL
              pointing to a an appropriate list file.  Note: only one <b>-@</b> option can be used (if more than one is
              specified,  only  the last one will be recognized). Furthermore, for HTTP resources, the MIME type
              information will be used to re-open an actual MPEG stream  as  such  instead  of  treating  it  as
              playlist  file.  So  you  could  just always use <b>-@</b> for web resources without bothering if it is a
              playlist or already the resolved stream address.

       <b>-l</b> <u>n</u>, <b>--listentry</b> <u>n</u>
              Of the playlist, play specified entry only.  <u>n</u> is the number of entry starting at 1. A value of  0
              is  the  default  and means playing the whole list,  a negative value means showing of the list of
              titles with their numbers...

       <b>--continue</b>
              Enable playlist continuation mode. This changes frame skipping to apply only to  the  first  track
              and  also  continues to play following tracks in playlist after the selected one. Also, the option
              to play a number of frames only applies to the whole playlist. Basically, this tries to treat  the
              playlist  more  like  one  big  stream  (like,  an  audio book).  The current track number in list
              (1-based) and frame number (0-based) are printed at exit (useful if you interrupted  playback  and
              want to continue later).  Note that the continuation info is printed to standard output unless the
              switch  for  piping  audio  data to standard out is used. Also, it really makes sense to work with
              actual playlist files instead of lists of  file  names  as  arguments,  to  keep  track  positions
              consistent.

       <b>--loop</b> <u>times</u>
              for looping track(s) a certain number of times, &lt; 0 means infinite loop (not with --random!).

       <b>--keep-open</b>
              For remote control mode: Keep loaded file open after reaching end.

       <b>--timeout</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Timeout in (integer) seconds before declaring a stream dead (if &lt;= 0, wait forever).

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--shuffle</b>
              Shuffle  play.  Randomly shuffles the order of files specified on the command line, or in the list
              file.

       <b>-Z</b>, <b>--random</b>
              Continuous random play.  Keeps picking a random file from the  command  line  or  the  play  list.
              Unlike shuffle play above, random play never ends, and plays individual songs more than once.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--index</b>
              Index  /  scan  through  the  track  before  playback.  This fills the index table for seeking (if
              enabled in libmpg123) and may make the operating system  cache  the  file  contents  for  smoother
              operating on playback.

       <b>--index-size</b> <u>size</u>
              Set the number of entries in the seek frame index table.

       <b>--preframes</b> <u>num</u>
              Set  the  number of frames to be read as lead-in before a seeked-to position.  This serves to fill
              the layer 3 bit reservoir, which is needed to faithfully reproduce a certain sample at  a  certain
              position.   Note  that for layer 3, a minimum of 1 is enforced (because of frame overlap), and for
              layer 1 and 2, this is limited to 2 (no bit reservoir in that case, but engine spin-up anyway).

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>and</b> <b>PROCESSING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-o</b> <u>module</u>, <b>--output</b> <u>module</u>
              Select audio output module. You can provide a comma-separated list  to  use  the  first  one  that
              works.  Also see <b>-a</b>.

       <b>--list-modules</b>
              List the available modules.

       <b>--list-devices</b>
              List  the  available  output devices for given output module. If there is no functionality to list
              devices in the chosen module, an error will be printed and mpg123 will exit with a non-zero code.

       <b>-a</b> <u>dev</u>, <b>--audiodevice</b> <u>dev</u>
              Specify the audio device to use.  The default as well as the possible values depend on the  active
              output.  For the JACK output, a comma-separated list of ports to connect to (for each channel) can
              be specified.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--stdout</b>
              The decoded audio samples are written to standard output, instead  of  playing  them  through  the
              audio  device.   This  option must be used if your audio hardware is not supported by <b>mpg123</b>.  The
              output format per default is raw (headerless) linear PCM audio data, 16  bit,  stereo,  host  byte
              order (you can force mono or 8bit).

       <b>-O</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--outfile</b>
              Write  raw  output  into  a file (instead of simply redirecting standard output to a file with the
              shell).

       <b>-w</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--wav</b>
              Write output as WAV file. This will cause the MPEG stream to be decoded and saved as file  <u>file</u>  ,
              or  standard  output  if  <u>-</u>  is  used as file name. You can also use <u>--au</u> and <u>--cdr</u> for AU and CDR
              format, respectively. Note that WAV/AU writing to non-seekable files, or redirected stdout,  needs
              some  thought.  Since  1.16.0, the logic changed to writing the header with the first actual data.
              This avoids spurious WAV headers in a pipe, for example. The result of decoding nothing to  WAV/AU
              is  a file consisting just of the header when it is seekable and really nothing when not (not even
              a header). Correctly writing data with prophetic headers to stdout is no easy business.

       <b>--au</b> <u>file</u>
              Does not play the MPEG file but writes it to <u>file</u> in SUN audio  format.   If  -  is  used  as  the
              filename,  the  AU  file is written to stdout. See paragraph about WAV writing for header fun with
              non-seekable streams.

       <b>--cdr</b> <u>file</u>
              Does not play the MPEG file but writes it to <u>file</u> as a CDR file.  If - is used  as  the  filename,
              the CDR file is written to stdout.

       <b>--reopen</b>
              Forces reopen of the audiodevice after ever song

       <b>--cpu</b> <u>decoder-type</u>
              Selects  a  certain  decoder  (optimized  for specific CPU), for example i586 or MMX.  The list of
              available decoders can vary; depending on the build and what your CPU supports.   This  option  is
              only available when the build actually includes several optimized decoders.

       <b>--test-cpu</b>
              Tests your CPU and prints a list of possible choices for --cpu.

       <b>--list-cpu</b>
              Lists all available decoder choices, regardless of support by your CPU.

       <b>-g</b> <u>gain</u>, <b>--gain</b> <u>gain</u>
              [DEPRECATED] Set audio hardware output gain (default: don't change). The unit of the gain value is
              hardware   and   output  module  dependent.   (This  parameter  is  only  provided  for  backwards
              compatibility and may be removed in the future without prior notice.  Use  the  audio  player  for
              playing and a mixer app for mixing, UNIX style!)

       <b>-f</b> <u>factor</u>, <b>--scale</b> <u>factor</u>
              Change scale factor (default: 32768).

       <b>--rva-mix,</b> <b>--rva-radio</b>
              Enable  RVA  (relative  volume adjustment) using the values stored for ReplayGain radio mode / mix
              mode with all tracks roughly equal loudness.  The first valid  information  found  in  ID3V2  Tags
              (Comment named RVA or the RVA2 frame) or ReplayGain header in Lame/Info Tag is used.

       <b>--rva-album,</b> <b>--rva-audiophile</b>
              Enable  RVA  (relative volume adjustment) using the values stored for ReplayGain audiophile mode /
              album mode with usually the effect of adjusting  album  loudness  but  keeping  relative  loudness
              inside  album.   The  first  valid information found in ID3V2 Tags (Comment named RVA_ALBUM or the
              RVA2 frame) or ReplayGain header in Lame/Info Tag is used.

       <b>-0</b>, <b>--single0</b>; <b>-1</b>, <b>--single1</b>
              Decode only channel 0 (left) or channel 1 (right), respectively.  These options are available  for
              stereo MPEG streams only.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--mono</b>, <b>--mix</b>, <b>--singlemix</b>
              Mix both channels / decode mono. It takes less CPU time than full stereo decoding.

       <b>--stereo</b>
              Force stereo output

       <b>-r</b> <u>rate</u>, <b>--rate</b> <u>rate</u>
              Set  sample rate (default: automatic).  You may want to change this if you need a constant bitrate
              independent of the mpeg stream rate. mpg123 automagically  converts  the  rate.  You  should  then
              combine this with --stereo or --mono.

       <b>--resample</b> <u>method</u>
              Set  resampling  method  to employ if forcing an output rate. Choices (case-insensitive) are NtoM,
              dirty, and fine. The fine resampler is the default.  It  employs  libsyn123's  low-latency  fairly
              efficient  resampler  to  postprocess the output from libmpg123 instead of the fast but very crude
              NtoM decoder (drop sample method) that mpg123 offers since decades. If you are really low  on  CPU
              time,  choose  NtoM,  as  the resampler usually needs more time than the MPEG decoder itself.  The
              mpg123 program is  smart  enough  to  combine  the  2to1  or  4to1  downsampling  modes  with  the
              postprocessing for extreme downsampling.

       <b>-2</b>, <b>--2to1</b>; <b>-4</b>, <b>--4to1</b>
              Performs  a downsampling of ratio 2:1 (22 kHz from 44.1 kHz) or 4:1 (11 kHz) on the output stream,
              respectively. Saves some CPU cycles, but of course  throws  away  the  high  frequencies,  as  the
              decoder does not bother producing them.

       <b>--pitch</b> <u>value</u>
              Set a pitch change (speedup/down, 0 is neutral; 0.05 is 5% speedup).  When not enforcing an output
              rate,  this  changes  the  output  sampling  rate,  so  it  only  works  in  the  range your audio
              system/hardware supports. When you combine this with a fixed output rate, it modifies  a  software
              resampling ratio instead.

       <b>--8bit</b> Forces 8bit output

       <b>--float</b>
              Forces f32 encoding

       <b>-e</b> <u>enc</u>, <b>--encoding</b> <u>enc</u>
              Choose  output sample encoding. Possible values look like f32 (32-bit floating point), s32 (32-bit
              signed integer), u32 (32-bit unsigned integer) and the variants with  different  numbers  of  bits
              (s24,  u24,  s16, u16, s8, u8) and also special variants like ulaw and alaw 8-bit.  See the output
              of mpg123's longhelp for actually available encodings.

       <b>-d</b> <u>n</u>, <b>--doublespeed</b> <u>n</u>
              Only play every <u>n</u>'th frame.  This will cause the MPEG stream to be played <u>n</u>  times  faster,  which
              can  be  used for special effects.  Can also be combined with the <b>--halfspeed</b> option to play 3 out
              of 4 frames etc.  Don't expect great sound quality when using this option.

       <b>-h</b> <u>n</u>, <b>--halfspeed</b> <u>n</u>
              Play each frame <u>n</u> times.  This will cause the MPEG stream to be played at <u>1</u>/<u>n</u>'th  speed  (n  times
              slower), which can be used for special effects. Can also be combined with the <b>--doublespeed</b> option
              to double every third frame or things like that.  Don't expect great sound quality when using this
              option.

       <b>-E</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--equalizer</b>
              Enables  equalization,  taken  from  <u>file</u>.  The file needs to contain 32 lines of data, additional
              comment lines may be prefixed with <u>#</u>.  Each data line  consists  of  two  floating-point  entries,
              separated  by  whitespace.   They  specify the multipliers for left and right channel of a certain
              frequency band, respectively.  The first line corresponds to the lowest, the 32nd to  the  highest
              frequency  band.   Note  that you can control the equalizer interactively with the generic control
              interface.  Also note that these are the 32 bands of the MPEG codec, not spaced like you would see
              for a usual graphic equalizer. The upside is that there is zero computational cost in addition  to
              decoding.  The downside is that you roughly have bass in band 0, (upper) mids in band 1, treble in
              all others.

       <b>--gapless</b>
              Enable code that cuts (junk) samples at beginning and end of tracks, enabling gapless  transitions
              between  MPEG  files  when encoder padding and codec delays would prevent it.  This is enabled per
              default beginning with mpg123 version 1.0.0 .

       <b>--no-gapless</b>
              Disable the gapless code. That gives you MP3 decodings that include encoder delay and padding plus
              mpg123's decoder delay.

       <b>--no-infoframe</b>
              Do not parse the Xing/Lame/VBR/Info frame, decode it instead just like a stupid old  MP3  hardware
              player.   This  implies  disabling  of  gapless  playback  as the necessary information is in said
              metadata frame.

       <b>-D</b> <u>n</u>, <b>--delay</b> <u>n</u>
              Insert a delay of <u>n</u> seconds before each track.

       <b>-o</b> <b>h</b>, <b>--headphones</b>
              Direct audio output to the headphone connector (some hardware only; AIX, HP, SUN).

       <b>-o</b> <b>s</b>, <b>--speaker</b>
              Direct audio output to the speaker  (some hardware only; AIX, HP, SUN).

       <b>-o</b> <b>l</b>, <b>--lineout</b>
              Direct audio output to the line-out connector (some hardware only; AIX, HP, SUN).

       <b>-b</b> <u>size</u>, <b>--buffer</b> <u>size</u>
              Use an audio output buffer of <u>size</u> Kbytes.  This is useful to bypass short periods of heavy system
              activity, which would normally cause the audio output to be interrupted.   You  should  specify  a
              buffer size of at least 1024 (i.e. 1 Mb, which equals about 6 seconds of audio data) or more; less
              than about 300 does not make much sense.  The default is 0, which turns buffering off.

       <b>--preload</b> <u>fraction</u>
              Wait  for the buffer to be filled to <u>fraction</u> before starting playback (fraction between 0 and 1).
              You can tune this prebuffering to either get faster sound to your ears or safer uninterrupted  web
              radio.  Default is 0.2 (wait for 20 % of buffer to be full, changed from 1 in version 1.23).

       <b>--devbuffer</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Set  device  buffer  in  seconds;  &lt;=  0 means default value. This is the small buffer between the
              application and the audio backend, possibly directly related to hardware buffers.

       <b>--smooth</b>
              Keep buffer over track boundaries -- meaning, do not empty the buffer between tracks for  possibly
              some added smoothness.

</pre><h4><b>MISC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-t</b>, <b>--test</b>
              Test mode.  The audio stream is decoded, but no output occurs.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--check</b>
              Check for filter range violations (clipping), and report them for each frame if any occur.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Increase the verbosity level.  For example, displays the frame numbers during decoding.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              Quiet.  Suppress diagnostic messages.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--control</b>
              Enable terminal control keys. This is enabled automatically if a terminal is detected.  By default
              use  's'  or  the  space bar to stop/restart (pause, unpause) playback, 'f' to jump forward to the
              next song, 'b' to jump back to the beginning of the song, ',' to rewind, '.' to fast forward,  and
              'q'  to  quit.   Type 'h' for a full list of available controls. The A-B loop feature with key 'o'
              changes the preset loop interval to the interval between two presses of 'o', the third  press  (or
              'p') ending the looped playback. The key 'p' will use the updated loop interval after that.

       <b>--no-control</b>
              Disable terminal control even if terminal is detected.

       <b>--title</b>
              In  an  xterm, rxvt, screen, iris-ansi (compatible, TERM environment variable is examined), change
              the window's title to the name of song currently playing.

       <b>--pauseloop</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Set the length of the loop interval in terminal control fixed looping mode, away from the  default
              of 0.5 seconds, as a floating point number. This value can be overwritten at runtime using the A-B
              loop feature.

       <b>--name</b> <u>name</u>
              Set the name of this instance, possibly used in various places. This sets the client name for JACK
              output.

       <b>--long-tag</b>
              Display ID3 tag info always in long format with one line per item (artist, title, ...)

       <b>--utf8</b> Regardless of environment, print metadata in UTF-8 (otherwise, when not using UTF-8 locale, you'll
              get ASCII stripdown).

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--remote</b>
              Activate  generic control interface.  <b>mpg123</b> will then read and execute commands from stdin. Basic
              usage is ``load &lt;filename&gt; '' to play some file and  the  obvious  ``pause'',  ``command.   ``jump
              &lt;frame&gt;''  will jump/seek to a given point (MPEG frame number).  Issue ``help'' to get a full list
              of commands and syntax.

       <b>--remote-err</b>
              Print responses  for  generic  control  mode  to  standard  error,  not  standard  out.   This  is
              automatically triggered when using <b>-s</b>.

       <b>--fifo</b> <u>path</u>
              Create a fifo / named pipe on the given path and use that for reading commands instead of standard
              input.

       <b>--aggressive</b>
              Tries to get higher priority

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--realtime</b>
              Tries to gain realtime priority.  This option usually requires root privileges to have any effect.

       <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Shows short usage instructions.

       <b>--longhelp</b>
              Shows long usage instructions.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print the version string.

       <b>--libversion</b>
              Print version information on the mpg123 libraries being used (libmpg123, libout123, libsyn123).

</pre><h4><b>HTTP</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       In  addition  to  reading  MPEG  audio  streams  from  ordinary files and from the standard input, <b>mpg123</b>
       supports retrieval of MPEG audio streams or playlists via the HTTP  protocol, which is used in the  World
       Wide  Web  (WWW).  Such files are specified using a so-called URL, which starts with http:// or https:/<a href="file:/.">/.</a>
       When a file with that prefix is encountered, <b>mpg123</b> since 1.30.0 will by default call an external  helper
       program (either <b><a href="../man1/wget.1.html">wget</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/curl.1.html">curl</a></b>(1), see the <b>--network</b> option) to retrieve the resource. You can configure
       access  via  a  proxy server using the standard environment variables those programs support. The <b>--proxy</b>
       option that <b>mpg123</b> before 1.30.0 used for its internal network code is gone in the default build now  and
       will probably disappear for good with 1.31.1.

       Note  that,  in  order to play MPEG audio files from a WWW server, it is necessary that the connection to
       that server is fast enough.  For example, a 128 kbit/s MPEG file requires the network connection to be at
       least 128 kbit/s (16 kbyte/s) plus protocol overhead.  If you suffer  from  short  network  outages,  you
       should  try  the  <b>-b</b> option (buffer) to bypass such outages.  If your network connection is generally not
       fast enough to retrieve MPEG audio files in realtime, you can first download  the  files  to  your  local
       harddisk (e.g. using <b><a href="../man1/wget.1.html">wget</a></b>(1)) and then play them from there.

       Streams  with  embedded  ICY  metadata are supported, the interval being communicated via HTTP headers or
       <b>--icy-interval</b>.

</pre><h4><b>INTERRUPT</b></h4><pre>
       When in terminal control mode, you can quit via pressing the q key, while any time you can  abort  <b>mpg123</b>
       by  pressing  Ctrl-C.  If  not in terminal control mode, this will skip to the next file (if any). If you
       want to abort playing immediately in that case, press Ctrl-C twice in short succession (within about  one
       second).

       Note  that  the  result of quitting <b>mpg123</b> pressing Ctrl-C might not be audible immediately, due to audio
       data buffering in the audio device.  This delay is system dependent, but it is usually not more than  one
       or two seconds.

</pre><h4><b>PLAYBACK</b> <b>STATUS</b> <b>LINE</b></h4><pre>
       In  verbose  mode,  mpg123  updates a line with various information centering around the current playback
       position. On any decent terminal, the line also works as a progress bar in the current file by  reversing
       video for a fraction of the line according to the current position. An example for a full line is this:

            &gt; 0291+0955  00:01.68+00:28.22 [00:05.30] mix 100=085 192 kb/s  576 B acc   18 clip p+0.014

       The information consists of, in order:

       <b>&gt;</b>      single-character playback state (``&gt;'' for playing, ``='' for pausing/looping, ``_'' for stopped)

       <b>0291+0955</b>
              current frame offset and number of remaining frames after the plus sign

       <b>00:01.68+00:28.22</b>
              current position from and remaining time in human terms (hours, minutes, seconds)

       <b>[00:05.30]</b>
              fill of the output buffer in terms of playback time, if the buffer is enabled

       <b>mix</b>    selected RVA mode (possible values: mix, alb (album), and --- (neutral, off))

       <b>100=085</b>
              set volume and the RVA-modified effective volume after the equal sign

       <b>192</b> <b>kb/s</b>
              current bitrate

       <b>576</b> <b>B</b>  size of current frame in bytes

       <b>acc</b>    if positions are accurate, possible values are ``acc'' for accurate positions or ``fuz'' for fuzzy
              (with guessed byte offsets using mean frame size)

       <b>18</b> <b>clip</b>
              amount  of  clipped  samples,  non-zero only if decoder reports that (generic does, some optimized
              ones not)

       <b>p+0.014</b>
              pitch change (increased/decreased playback sampling rate on user request)

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       MPEG audio decoding requires a good deal of  CPU  performance,  especially  layer-3.   To  decode  it  in
       realtime,  you  should have at least an i486DX4, Pentium, Alpha, SuperSparc or equivalent processor.  You
       can also use the <b>-m</b> option to decode mono only, which reduces the CPU load somewhat for layer-3  streams.
       See also the <b>-2</b> and <b>-4</b> options.

       If  everything  else fails, have mpg123 decode to a file and then use an appropriate utility to play that
       file with less CPU load.  Most probably you can configure mpg123 to produce a format  suitable  for  your
       audio device (see above about encodings and sampling rates).

       If  your  system is generally fast enough to decode in realtime, but there are sometimes periods of heavy
       system load (such as cronjobs, users logging in remotely, starting of ``big'' programs etc.) causing  the
       audio  output to be interrupted, then you should use the <b>-b</b> option to use a buffer of reasonable size (at
       least 1000 Kbytes).

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODE</b></h4><pre>
       Up to version 1.25.x, mpg123 always returned exit code 0 also for complete junk on the input side.  Fatal
       errors  were  only  considered  for  output. With version 1.26.0, this changed to the behaviour described
       below.

       When not using the remote control interface (which returns input errors as text  messages),  the  process
       exit  code  is  zero (success) only if all tracks in a playlist had at least one frame parsed, even if it
       did not decode cleanly, or are empty, MPEG-wise (perhaps only metadata, or really an empty  file).   When
       you  decode  nothing, nothing is the result and that is fine. When a track later aborts because of parser
       errors or breakdown of the network communication, this is treated as end of a track, but  does  not  make
       the  process  as such fail. One really bad (or non-existing) stream in the playlist results in a non-zero
       error code, consistent with other UNIX tools.

       An error in audio output results in the process ending with a non-zero exit code immediately,  regardless
       of how much data has been successfully played before. The forgiveness is only on the input side.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Mostly  MPEG-1 layer 2 and 3 are tested in real life.  Please report any issues and provide test files to
       help fixing them.

       No CRC error checking is performed. But the decoder is built and tested to  behave  nicely  with  damaged
       streams. Mostly, damaged frames will just be silent.

       Some platforms lack audio hardware support; you may be able to use the <b>-s</b> switch to feed the decoded data
       to a program that can play it on your audio device.
