</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Ruby is an interpreted scripting language for quick and easy object-oriented programming.   It  has  many
       features to process text files and to do system management tasks (like in Perl).  It is simple, straight-
       forward, and extensible.

       If  you want a language for easy object-oriented programming, or you don't like the Perl ugliness, or you
       do like the concept of LISP, but don't like too many parentheses, Ruby might be your language of choice.

</pre><h4><b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       Ruby's features are as follows:

       <b>Interpretive</b>
               Ruby is an interpreted language, so you don't have to  recompile  programs  written  in  Ruby  to
               execute them.

       <b>Variables</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>type</b> <b>(dynamic</b> <b>typing)</b>
               Variables  in  Ruby can contain data of any type.  You don't have to worry about variable typing.
               Consequently, it has a weaker compile time check.

       <b>No</b> <b>declaration</b> <b>needed</b>
               You can use variables in your Ruby programs without  any  declarations.   Variable  names  denote
               their scope - global, class, instance, or local.

       <b>Simple</b> <b>syntax</b>
               Ruby has a simple syntax influenced slightly from Eiffel.

       <b>No</b> <b>user-level</b> <b>memory</b> <b>management</b>
               Ruby   has  automatic  memory  management.   Objects  no  longer  referenced  from  anywhere  are
               automatically collected by the garbage collector built into the interpreter.

       <b>Everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>object</b>
               Ruby is a purely object-oriented language, and was so since its creation.  Even such  basic  data
               as integers are seen as objects.

       <b>Class,</b> <b>inheritance,</b> <b>and</b> <b>methods</b>
               Being  an  object-oriented language, Ruby naturally has basic features like classes, inheritance,
               and methods.

       <b>Singleton</b> <b>methods</b>
               Ruby has the ability to define methods for certain objects.  For example, you can define a press-
               button action for certain widget by defining a singleton method for the button.  Or, you can make
               up your own prototype based object system using singleton methods, if you want to.

       <b>Mix-in</b> <b>by</b> <b>modules</b>
               Ruby intentionally does not have the multiple  inheritance  as  it  is  a  source  of  confusion.
               Instead,  Ruby  has  the  ability  to share implementations across the inheritance tree.  This is
               often called a ‘Mix-in’.

       <b>Iterators</b>
               Ruby has iterators for loop abstraction.

       <b>Closures</b>
               In Ruby, you can objectify the procedure.

       <b>Text</b> <b>processing</b> <b>and</b> <b>regular</b> <b>expressions</b>
               Ruby has a bunch of text processing features like in Perl.

       <b>M17N,</b> <b>character</b> <b>set</b> <b>independent</b>
               Ruby supports multilingualized programming. Easy to  process  texts  written  in  many  different
               natural  languages  and  encoded  in  many  different  character encodings, without dependence on
               Unicode.

       <b>Bignums</b>
               With built-in bignums, you can for example calculate <a href="../man400/factorial.400.html">factorial</a>(400).

       <b>Reflection</b> <b>and</b> <b>domain</b> <b>specific</b> <b>languages</b>
               Class is also an instance of the Class class. Definition of classes and methods is an  expression
               just  as  1+1  is.  So your programs can even write and modify programs.  Thus you can write your
               application in your own programming language on top of Ruby.

       <b>Exception</b> <b>handling</b>
               As in Java(tm).

       <b>Direct</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>OS</b>
               Ruby can use most Unix system calls, often used in system programming.

       <b>Dynamic</b> <b>loading</b>
               On most Unix systems, you can load object files into the Ruby interpreter on-the-fly.

       <b>Rich</b> <b>libraries</b>
               In addition to the “builtin libraries” and “standard libraries” that are  bundled  with  Ruby,  a
               vast  amount  of  third-party  libraries (“gems”) are available via the package management system
               called ‘RubyGems’, namely the <u><a href="../man1/gem.1.html">gem</a></u>(1) command.  Visit RubyGems.org (https://rubygems.org/) to find
               the gems you need, and explore GitHub (https://github.com/) to see how they are  being  developed
               and used.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  Ruby  interpreter  accepts the following command-line options (switches).  They are quite similar to
       those of <u><a href="../man1/perl.1.html">perl</a></u>(1).

       <b>--copyright</b>    Prints the copyright notice, and quits immediately without running any script.

       <b>--version</b>      Prints the version of the Ruby interpreter, and  quits  immediately  without  running  any
                      script.

       <b>-0</b>[<u>octal</u>]      (The  digit  “zero”.)  Specifies the input record separator (<b>$/</b>) as an octal number. If no
                      digit is given, the null character is taken as the separator.  Other switches  may  follow
                      the digits.  <b>-00</b> turns Ruby into paragraph mode.  <b>-0777</b> makes Ruby read whole file at once
                      as a single string since there is no legal character with that value.

       <b>-C</b> <u>directory</u>
       <b>-X</b> <u>directory</u>   Causes Ruby to switch to the directory.

       <b>-E</b> <u>external</u>[:<u>internal</u>]
       <b>--encoding</b> <u>external</u>[:<u>internal</u>]
                      Specifies the default value(s) for external encodings and internal encoding. Values should
                      be separated with colon (:).

                      You  can  omit  the one for internal encodings, then the value (<b>Encoding.default_internal</b>)
                      <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>nil.</b>

       <b>--external-encoding</b>=<u>encoding</u>
       <b>--internal-encoding</b>=<u>encoding</u>
                      Specify the default external or internal character encoding

       <b>-F</b> <u>pattern</u>     Specifies input field separator (<b>$;</b>).

       <b>-I</b> <u>directory</u>   Used to tell Ruby where to load the library scripts.  Directory path will be added to  the
                      load-path variable (<b>$:</b>).

       <b>-K</b> <u>kcode</u>       Specifies KANJI (Japanese) encoding. The default value for script encodings (<b>__ENCODING__</b>)
                      <b>and</b> <b>external</b> <b>encodings</b> (<b>Encoding.default_external</b>) <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>specified</b> <b>one.</b> <u>kcode</u> can be
                      one of

                            <b>e</b>       EUC-JP

                            <b>s</b>       Windows-31J (CP932)

                            <b>u</b>       UTF-8

                            <b>n</b>       ASCII-8BIT (BINARY)

       <b>-S</b>             Makes  Ruby use the PATH environment variable to search for script, unless its name begins
                      with a slash.  This is used to emulate <b>#!</b> on  machines  that  don't  support  it,  in  the
                      following manner:

                            #! /usr/local/bin/ruby
                            # This line makes the next one a comment in Ruby \
                              exec /usr/local/bin/ruby -S $0 $*

                      On some systems <b>$0</b> does not always contain the full pathname, so you need the <b>-S</b> switch to
                      tell  Ruby  to search for the script if necessary (to handle embedded spaces and such).  A
                      better construct than <b>$*</b> would be <b>${1+"$@"}</b>, but it does not work if the script  is  being
                      interpreted by <u><a href="../man1/csh.1.html">csh</a></u>(1).

       <b>-T</b>[<u>level=1</u>]    Turns on taint checks at the specified level (default 1).

       <b>-U</b>             Sets the default value for internal encodings (<b>Encoding.default_internal</b>) <b>to</b> <b>UTF-8.</b>

       <b>-W</b>[<u>level=2</u>]    Turns  on  verbose mode at the specified level without printing the version message at the
                      beginning. The level can be;

                            <b>0</b>       Verbose mode is "silence". It sets the <b>$VERBOSE</b> to nil.

                            <b>1</b>       Verbose mode is "medium". It sets the <b>$VERBOSE</b> to false.

                            <b>2</b> <b>(default)</b> Verbose mode is "verbose". It sets the <b>$VERBOSE</b> to  true.   <b>-W</b>2  is  the
                                    same as <b>-w</b>

       <b>-a</b>             Turns on auto-split mode when used with <b>-n</b> or <b>-p</b>.  In auto-split mode, Ruby executes
                            <b>$F</b> <b>=</b> <b>$_.split</b>
                      at beginning of each loop.

       <b>--backtrace-limit</b>=<u>num</u>
                      Limits the maximum length of backtraces to <u>num</u> lines (default -1, meaning no limit).

       <b>-c</b>             Causes  Ruby to check the syntax of the script and exit without executing. If there are no
                      syntax errors, Ruby will print “Syntax OK” to the standard output.

       <b>-d</b>
       <b>--debug</b>        Turns on debug mode.  <b>$DEBUG</b> will be set to true.

       <b>-e</b> <u>command</u>     Specifies script from command-line while telling Ruby  not  to  search  the  rest  of  the
                      arguments for a script file name.

       <b>-h</b>
       <b>--help</b>         Prints a summary of the options.

       <b>-i</b> <u>extension</u>   Specifies  in-place-edit  mode.  The extension, if specified, is added to old file name to
                      make a backup copy.  For example:

                            % echo matz &gt; /tmp/junk
                            % cat /tmp/junk
                            matz
                            % ruby -p -i.bak -e '$_.upcase!' /tmp/junk
                            % cat /tmp/junk
                            MATZ
                            % cat /tmp/junk.bak
                            matz

       <b>-l</b>             (The lowercase letter “ell”.)  Enables automatic line-ending processing,  which  means  to
                      firstly set <b>$\</b> to the value of <b>$/</b>, and secondly chops every line read using <b>chomp!</b>.

       <b>-n</b>             Causes  Ruby  to assume the following loop around your script, which makes it iterate over
                      file name arguments somewhat like <b>sed</b> <b>-n</b> or <b>awk</b>.

                            while gets
                              ...
                            end

       <b>-p</b>             Acts mostly same as -n switch, but print the value of variable <b>$_</b> at the each end  of  the
                      loop.  For example:

                            % echo matz | ruby -p -e '$_.tr! "a-z", "A-Z"'
                            MATZ

       <b>-r</b> <u>library</u>     Causes Ruby to load the library using require.  It is useful when using <b>-n</b> or <b>-p</b>.

       <b>-s</b>             Enables  some  switch  parsing  for  switches  after  script name but before any file name
                      arguments (or before a <b>--</b>).  Any switches found there are removed from <b>ARGV</b>  and  set  the
                      corresponding variable in the script.  For example:

                            #! /usr/local/bin/ruby -s
                            # prints "true" if invoked with `-xyz' switch.
                            print "true\n" if $xyz

       <b>-v</b>             Enables  verbose  mode.  Ruby will print its version at the beginning and set the variable
                      <b>$VERBOSE</b> to true.  Some methods print extra messages if this variable is  true.   If  this
                      switch is given, and no other switches are present, Ruby quits after printing its version.

       <b>-w</b>             Enables  verbose  mode  without  printing  version  message at the beginning.  It sets the
                      <b>$VERBOSE</b> variable to true.

       <b>-x</b>[<u>directory</u>]  Tells Ruby that the script is embedded in a message.  Leading garbage  will  be  discarded
                      until  the  first  line  that  starts  with  “#!”  and  contains  the string, “ruby”.  Any
                      meaningful switches on that line will be applied.  The end of the script must be specified
                      with either <b>EOF</b>, <b>^D</b> (<b>control-D</b>), <b>^Z</b> (<b>control-Z</b>), or the reserved  word  <b>__END__</b>.   If  the
                      directory name is specified, Ruby will switch to that directory before executing script.

       <b>-y</b>
       <b>--yydebug</b>      This option is not guaranteed to be compatible.

                      Turns  on  compiler debug mode.  Ruby will print a bunch of internal state messages during
                      compilation.  Only specify this switch you are going to debug the Ruby interpreter.

       <b>--disable-</b><u>FEATURE</u>
       <b>--enable-</b><u>FEATURE</u>
                      Disables (or enables) the specified <u>FEATURE</u>.
                      <b>--disable-gems</b>
                      <b>--enable-gems</b>      Disables (or enables) RubyGems libraries.  By default, Ruby  will  load
                                         the  latest  version of each installed gem. The <b>Gem</b> constant is true if
                                         RubyGems is enabled, false if otherwise.

                      <b>--disable-rubyopt</b>
                      <b>--enable-rubyopt</b>   Ignores (or considers) the RUBYOPT environment  variable.  By  default,
                                         Ruby considers the variable.

                      <b>--disable-all</b>
                      <b>--enable-all</b>       Disables (or enables) all features.

       <b>--dump</b>=<u>target</u>  Dump some information.

                      Prints the specified target.  <u>target</u> can be one of:

                            <b>version</b> Print version description (same as <b>--version).</b>

                            <b>usage</b>   Print a brief usage message (same as <b>-h).</b>

                            <b>help</b>    Show long help message (same as <b>--help).</b>

                            <b>syntax</b>  Check syntax (same as <b>-c</b> <b>--yydebug).</b>

                      Or one of the following, which are intended for debugging the interpreter:

                            <b>yydebug</b>                 Enable compiler debug mode (same as <b>--yydebug).</b>

                            <b>parsetree</b>               Print  a  textual  representation  of  the  Ruby AST for the
                                                    program.

                            <b>parsetree_with_comment</b>  Print a textual representation  of  the  Ruby  AST  for  the
                                                    program, but with each node annoted with the associated Ruby
                                                    source code.

                            <b>insns</b>                   Print a list of disassembled bytecode instructions.

                            <b>insns_without_opt</b>       Print  the list of disassembled bytecode instructions before
                                                    various optimizations have been applied.

       <b>--verbose</b>      Enables verbose mode without printing version message  at  the  beginning.   It  sets  the
                      <b>$VERBOSE</b>  variable to true.  If this switch is given, and no script arguments (script file
                      or <b>-e</b> options) are present, Ruby quits immediately.

       <b>--crash-report</b>=<u>template</u>
                      Sets the template of path name to save crash report.   See  RUBY_CRASH_REPORT  environment
                      variable for details.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       RUBYLIB    A  colon-separated  list  of  directories  that  are  added  to Ruby's library load path (<b>$:</b>).
                  <b>Directories</b> <b>from</b> <b>this</b> <b>environment</b> <b>variable</b> <b>are</b> <b>searched</b>  before  the  standard  load  path  is
                  searched.

                  e.g.:
                        <b>RUBYLIB="$HOME/lib/ruby:$HOME/lib/rubyext"</b>

       RUBYOPT    Additional Ruby options.

                  e.g.
                        <b>RUBYOPT="-w</b> <b>-Ke"</b>

                  Note  that  RUBYOPT  can  contain  only  <b>-d</b>,  <b>-E</b>,  <b>-I</b>,  <b>-K</b>,  <b>-r</b>,  <b>-T</b>, <b>-U</b>, <b>-v</b>, <b>-w</b>, <b>-W,</b> <b>--debug</b>,
                  <b>--disable-</b><u>FEATURE</u> and <b>--enable-</b><u>FEATURE</u>.

       RUBYPATH   A colon-separated list of directories that Ruby searches for Ruby programs when the <b>-S</b> flag is
                  specified.  This variable precedes the PATH environment variable.

       RUBYSHELL  The path to the system shell command.  This environment variable is enabled for only  mswin32,
                  mingw32, and OS/2 platforms.  If this variable is not defined, Ruby refers to COMSPEC.

       PATH       Ruby refers to the PATH environment variable on calling Kernel#system.

       And  Ruby  depends  on  some RubyGems related environment variables unless RubyGems is disabled.  See the

</pre><h4><b>GC</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The Ruby garbage collector (GC) tracks objects in fixed-sized slots, but each object may  have  auxiliary
       memory  allocations  handled by the malloc family of C standard library calls ( <u><a href="../man3/malloc.3.html">malloc</a></u>(3), <u><a href="../man3/calloc.3.html">calloc</a></u>(3), and
       <u><a href="../man3/realloc.3.html">realloc</a></u>(3)).  In this documentatation, the "heap" refers to the Ruby object heap  of  fixed-sized  slots,
       while  "malloc"  refers  to auxiliary allocations commonly referred to as the "process heap".  Thus there
       are at least two possible ways to trigger GC:

             <b>1</b>       Reaching the object limit.

             <b>2</b>       Reaching the malloc limit.

       In Ruby 2.1, the generational  GC  was  introduced  and  the  limits  are  divided  into  young  and  old
       generations, providing two additional ways to trigger a GC:

             <b>3</b>       Reaching the old object limit.

             <b>4</b>       Reaching the old malloc limit.

       There are currently 4 possible areas where the GC may be tuned by the following 11 environment variables:
       RUBY_GC_HEAP_INIT_SLOTS                Initial  allocation  slots. Applies to all slot sizes.  Introduced
                                              in Ruby 2.1, default: 10000.

       RUBY_GC_HEAP_%d_INIT_SLOTS             Initial allocation of slots in a  specific  heap.   The  available
                                              heaps  can  be found in the keys of `GC.stat_heap`.  Introduced in
                                              Ruby 3.3.

       RUBY_GC_HEAP_FREE_SLOTS                Prepare at least this amount of slots  after  GC.   Allocate  this
                                              number  slots  if  there are not enough slots.  Introduced in Ruby
                                              2.1, default: 4096

       RUBY_GC_HEAP_GROWTH_FACTOR             Increase allocation rate of heap slots by this factor.  Introduced
                                              in Ruby 2.1, default: 1.8, minimum: 1.0 (no growth)

       RUBY_GC_HEAP_GROWTH_MAX_SLOTS          Allocation rate is limited to this  number  of  slots,  preventing
                                              excessive    allocation    due    to   RUBY_GC_HEAP_GROWTH_FACTOR.
                                              Introduced in Ruby 2.1, default: 0 (no limit)

       RUBY_GC_HEAP_OLDOBJECT_LIMIT_FACTOR    Perform a full GC when the number of old objects is more than R  *
                                              N, where R is this factor and N is the number of old objects after
                                              the last full GC.  Introduced in Ruby 2.1.1, default: 2.0

       RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT                   The  initial limit of young generation allocation from the malloc-
                                              family.  GC will start when this limit is reached.  Default: 16MB

       RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT_MAX               The maximum limit  of  young  generation  allocation  from  malloc
                                              before  GC  starts.   Prevents  excessive  malloc  growth  due  to
                                              RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT_GROWTH_FACTOR.   Introduced  in   Ruby   2.1,
                                              default: 32MB.

       RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT_GROWTH_FACTOR     Increases  the limit of young generation malloc calls, reducing GC
                                              frequency     but     increasing     malloc      growth      until
                                              RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT_MAX  is  reached.   Introduced  in  Ruby 2.1,
                                              default: 1.4, minimum: 1.0 (no growth)

       RUBY_GC_OLDMALLOC_LIMIT                The initial limit of old generation allocation from malloc, a full
                                              GC will start when this limit is reached.  Introduced in Ruby 2.1,
                                              default: 16MB

       RUBY_GC_OLDMALLOC_LIMIT_MAX            The maximum limit of old generation allocation from malloc  before
                                              a  full  GC  starts.   Prevents  excessive  malloc  growth  due to
                                              RUBY_GC_OLDMALLOC_LIMIT_GROWTH_FACTOR.  Introduced  in  Ruby  2.1,
                                              default: 128MB

       RUBY_GC_OLDMALLOC_LIMIT_GROWTH_FACTOR  Increases  the limit of old generation malloc allocation, reducing
                                              full   GC   frequency   but   increasing   malloc   growth   until
                                              RUBY_GC_OLDMALLOC_LIMIT_MAX  is  reached.  Introduced in Ruby 2.1,
                                              default: 1.2, minimum: 1.0 (no growth)

</pre><h4><b>STACK</b> <b>SIZE</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Stack size environment variables are  implementation-dependent  and  subject  to  change  with  different
       versions  of  Ruby.  The VM stack is used for pure-Ruby code and managed by the virtual machine.  Machine
       stack is used by the operating system and its usage is dependent on C extensions as well  as  C  compiler
       options.  Using lower values for these may allow applications to keep more Fibers or Threads running; but
       increases the chance of SystemStackError exceptions and segmentation faults (SIGSEGV).  These environment
       variables are available since Ruby 2.0.0.  All values are specified in bytes.

       RUBY_THREAD_VM_STACK_SIZE       VM  stack  size used at thread creation.  default: 524288 (32-bit CPU) or
                                       1048575 (64-bit)

       RUBY_THREAD_MACHINE_STACK_SIZE  Machine stack size used at thread creation.  default: 524288 or 1048575

       RUBY_FIBER_VM_STACK_SIZE        VM stack size used at fiber creation.  default: 65536 or 131072

       RUBY_FIBER_MACHINE_STACK_SIZE   Machine stack size used at fiber creation.  default: 262144 or 524288

</pre><h4><b>CRASH</b> <b>REPORT</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       RUBY_CRASH_REPORT  The template of path name to save crash report.  default: none

   <b>Naming</b> <b>crash</b> <b>report</b> <b>files</b>
       The template can contain <b>%</b> specifiers which are substituted by the following values when a  crash  report
       file is created:

       <b>%%</b>    A single <b>%</b> character.
       <b>%e</b>    Basename of executable.
       <b>%E</b>    Pathname of executable, with slashes (<b>/</b>) replaced by exclamation marks (<b>!</b>).
       <b>%f</b>    Basename of the program name, <b>$0</b>.
       <b>%F</b>    Pathname of the program name, <b>$0</b>, with slashes (<b>/</b>) replaced by exclamation marks (<b>!</b>).
       <b>%p</b>    PID of dumped process.
       <b>%t</b>    Time of dump, expressed as seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).
       <b>%NNN</b>  A character code in octal.

       A  single  <b>%</b>  at  the end of the template is dropped from the core filename, as is the combination of a <b>%</b>
       followed by any character other than those listed above.  All other characters in the template  become  a
       literal  part  of  the  core filename.  The template may include '/' characters, which are interpreted as
       delimiters for directory names.

   <b>Piping</b> <b>crash</b> <b>reports</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>program</b>
       If the first character of this file is a pipe symbol (<b>|</b>), then the remainder of the line  is  interpreted
       as the command-line for a program (or script) that is to be executed.

       The pipe template is split on spaces into an argument list before the template parameters are expanded.
