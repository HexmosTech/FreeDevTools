</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ruby-standalone</b> - use (only) the Ruby interpreter from Debian

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ruby-standalone</b>
       <b>ruby-standalone</b> [<u>PROGRAM</u>] [<u>ARGS</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       ruby-standlone  allows  one to use the Ruby interpreter provided by Debian (and thus get security support
       for stable releases), without having to also use Ruby libraries and applications from Debian.

       When called with no arguments, <b>ruby-standalone</b> will spawn a new shell, where all  of  the  standard  Ruby
       programs  (ruby,  erb,  gem,  irb,  rdoc,  ri,  testrb) in <b>$PATH</b> will never use code from Debian-provided
       packages.

       Otherwise, <u>PROGRAM</u> will be called with <u>ARGS</u> as arguments, in that same context.

       <b>Caveat:</b> if <u>PROGRAM</u> is not installed as a Rubygem and is installed by a Debian package, the Debian package
       version <u>will</u> be used.

</pre><h4><b>USE</b> <b>CASES</b></h4><pre>
       ruby-standalone makes it possible to:

       •   install <b>vagrant</b> from the Debian repository and at the sime time develop a Ruby web  application  that
           needs  gem  versions  different  than  the  ones  that were pulled in from the Debian repository when
           <b>vagrant</b> was installed.

       •   install <b>chef</b> from the Debian repository on a node that will host an application that needs  different
           gem versions than the ones <b>chef</b> needs.

       •   on  the same server, host <b>redmine</b> installed from the Debian repository and in-house Rails application
           that needs a different version of Rails than the one Debian provides.
