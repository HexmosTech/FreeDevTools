</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       reportbug - reports a bug to a debbugs server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>reportbug</b> <u>[options]</u> <u>&lt;package</u> <u>|</u> <u>pseudo-package</u> <u>|</u> <u>absolute-pathname&gt;</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>reportbug</b>  is  primarily  designed  to  report bugs in the Debian distribution; by default, it creates an
       email to the Debian bug tracking system at <u><a href="mailto:submit@bugs.debian.org">submit@bugs.debian.org</a></u> with information about the  bug  you've
       found, and makes a carbon copy of the report for you as well.

       Using  the  <b>--bts</b>  option,  you  can  also  report bugs to other servers that use the Debian bug tracking
       system, <b>debbugs</b>.

       You may specify either a package name or a filename; if you use a filename, it must either be an absolute
       filename (so beginning with a <b>/</b>) or if you want <b>reportbug</b> to search the system for a  filename,  see  the
       <b>--filename</b> and <b>--path</b> options below. If installed, also <b>dlocate</b> is used to identify the filename location
       and thus the package containing it.

       You  can  also specify a <b>pseudo-package</b>; these are used in the Debian bug tracking system to track issues
       that are not related to one specific package.  Run <b>reportbug</b> without any arguments, then enter  <b>other</b>  at
       the package prompt, to see a list of the most commonly-used <b>pseudo-packages</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`<b>--</b>').
       A summary of options are included below.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Show summary of options.

       <b>--version</b>
              Show the version of <b>reportbug</b> and exit.

       <b>-A</b> <b>FILENAME,</b> <b>--attach=FILENAME</b>
              Attach  a  file  to  the bug report; both text and binary files are acceptable; this option can be
              specified multiple times to attach several files.  This routine will create a MIME attachment with
              the file included; in some cases (usually text files), it is probably better to  use  <b>-i/--include</b>
              option.  (Please note that Debian's bug tracking system has limited support for MIME attachments.)

              This  option  supports  also  globbing  (i.e.  names  with wildcards, like file.*) but remember to
              include them between single quotes (the previous example becomes: 'file.*') else the  shell  would
              expand it before calling reportbug leading to an error.

              Be  aware  that  when  using  an  external  MUA to send the message (such as mutt), the attachment
              feature is not reliable and no file might be attached at all: the  MUA  feature  to  attach  files
              should be used instead (so from within the MUA).

       <b>--archive</b>
              Also show archived bugs when browsing bugs.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--no-query-bts</b>
              Don't  check  the  Debian  bug  tracking  system to see if this problem has already been reported;
              useful for offline use or if you're <b>really</b> sure it's a bug.

       <b>--query-bts</b>
              Check the Debian bug tracking system to see if this problem has already been reported (default).

       <b>-B</b> <b>SYSTEM,</b> <b>--bts=SYSTEM</b>
              Instead of the Debian bug server (or the bug server specified  in  <b>/etc/reportbug.conf</b>),  use  the
              server specified by <b>SYSTEM</b>.  Use --bts=help to obtain the list of valid values.  Note that if your
              <b>$HOME/.reportbugrc</b>  or  <b>/etc/reportbug.conf</b>  include  an smtphost setting that is specific to your
              default  bug  server  and  not  a  generic  smarthost,  you  may  need  to  override  this   using
              --smtphost=&lt;host&gt; to be able to report a bug directly to <b>SYSTEM</b>.

       <b>--body=BODY</b>
              Use  the  specified  <u>BODY</u>  string as the body of the message.  The body text will be wrapped at 70
              columns, and the normal <b>reportbug</b> headers and footers will be added as  appropriate.   The  editor
              prompt and any "special" prompting will be bypassed.

       <b>--body-file=BODYFILE,</b> <b>--bodyfile=BODYFILE</b>
              The  contents  of  the  (assumed to be) text file <u>BODYFILE</u> will be used as the message body.  This
              file is assumed to be properly formatted (i.e. reasonable line lengths, etc.).  The usual  headers
              and  footers  will be added, and the editor step and "special" prompts will be skipped.  (<u>BODYFILE</u>
              may also be a named pipe; using a device special file may lead to unusual results.)

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--no-config-files</b>
              Omit configuration files from the bug report without asking.  By default, you  are  asked  if  you
              want  to  include  them;  in  some  cases, doing so may cause sensitive information to be sent via
              email.

       <b>-C</b> <b>CLASS,</b> <b>--class=CLASS</b>
              Specify report class for GNATS BTSes.

       <b>--configure</b>
              Rerun the <b>reportbug</b> first time configuration routine, and write  a  new  <b>$HOME/.reportbugrc</b>  file.
              This  will  erase  any  pre-existing  settings  in  the file; however, a backup will be written as
              <b>$HOME/.reportbugrc~</b>.  Reportbug will exit after  rewriting  its  configuration  file,  hence  this
              option cannot usefully be combined with many other options.

       <b>--check-available</b>
              Check for newer releases of the package in Debian package lists (default).  In <b>advanced</b> and <b>expert</b>
              mode, check <b>https://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html</b> too.

       <b>--no-check-available</b>
              Do not check for newer releases of the package at <b>packages.debian.org</b>.

       <b>--debconf</b>
              Include debconf settings in your report.

       <b>--no-debconf</b>
              Do not include debconf settings from your report.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--debug</b>
              Don't  send  a real bug report to Debian; send it to yourself instead.  This is primarily used for
              testing by the maintainer.

       <b>--test</b> Operate in test mode (maintainer use only).

       <b>--draftpath=DRAFTPATH</b>
              Save the draft (for example, when exiting  and  saving  the  report  without  reporting  it)  into
              <u>DRAFTPATH</u> directory (default <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>).

       <b>-e</b> <b>EDITOR,</b> <b>--editor=EDITOR</b>
              Specify the editor to use, overriding any <b>EDITOR</b> or <b>VISUAL</b> environment variable setting.

       <b>--email=ADDRESS</b>
              Set  the email address your report should appear to be sent from (i.e. the address that appears in
              the <b>From</b> header).  This should be the actual Internet email address on its  own  (i.e.  without  a
              real  name  or  comment  part,  like  <b><a href="mailto:foo@example.com">foo@example.com</a></b>).   This setting will override the <b>EMAIL</b> and
              <b>DEBEMAIL</b> environment variables, but not <b>REPORTBUGEMAIL</b>.

       <b>--envelope-from</b>
              Specify the Envelope From mail header (also known  as  Return-path);  by  default  it's  the  From
              address but it can be selected a different one in case the MTA doesn't canonicalize local users to
              public  addresses.  This  can  be  set  to  the empty string if the MTA does not allow setting the
              Envelope From.

       <b>--mbox-reader-cmd=MBOX_READER_CMD</b>
              Specify a command to open the bug reports mbox file. You can use <b>%s</b> to substitute the mbox file to
              be used, and <b>%%</b> to insert a literal percent sign. If no <b>%s</b> is specified, the  mbox  file  name  is
              supplied at the end of the argument list.

       <b>-f</b> <b>FILENAME,</b> <b>--filename=FILENAME</b>
              Report  a  bug in the package containing <u>FILENAME</u> so you don't have to figure out what package the
              file belongs to.  The path will be searched for an exact path for <u>FILENAME</u>  before  attempting  to
              broaden  the  search  to  all  files.  If  <b>dlocate</b>  is  installed,  <u>FILENAME</u> is actually a regular
              expression.

       <b>--from-buildd=BUILDD_FORMAT</b>
              This options is a shortcut for buildd admins to report bugs from buildd log; the option expects  a
              value  in  the  format  of  <u>$source_$version</u>  where  <u>$source</u> is the source package the bug will be
              reported against and <u>$version</u> is its version.

       <b>--path</b> If the <b>-f/--filename</b> option is also specified, only search the path for  the  specified  <u>FILENAME</u>.
              Specifying  an absolute path with the <b>-f/--filename</b> option (i.e. one beginning with a <b>/</b>) overrides
              this behavior.

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--gnupg,</b> <b>--gpg</b>
              Attach a digital signature to the bug report using <b>GnuPG</b> (the GNU Privacy Guard).  (This  argument
              will be ignored if you are using an MUA to edit and send your report.)

       <b>-G,</b> <b>--gnus</b>
              Use the Gnus mail and news reader to send your report, rather than using the editor.

       <b>-H</b> <b>HEADER,</b> <b>--header=HEADER</b>
              Add a custom RFC2822 header to your email. Do not use this option if you want to submit the report
              using  your  MUA,  because  custom headers cannot be passed from reportbug to the MUA reliably. To
              send a carbon copy of the report to another recipient using <u>X-Debbugs-CC</u>, please see the <b>--list-cc</b>
              option.

       <b>-i</b> <b>FILE,</b> <b>--include=FILE</b>
              Include the specified <u>FILE</u> as part of the body of the message to be edited.  Can be used  multiple
              times  to  add  multiple files; text-only please!  From a suggestion by Michael Alan Dorman in the
              <b>bug</b> mailing list.  (See also the <b>-A/--attach</b> option.)

       <b>-I,</b> <b>--no-check-installed</b>
              Do not check whether the package is installed before filing a  report.   This  is  generally  only
              useful when filing a report on a package you know is not installed on your system.

       <b>--check-installed</b>
              Check if the specified package is installed when filing reports.  (This is the default behavior of
              <b>reportbug</b>.)

       <b>-j</b> <b>JUSTIFICATION,</b> <b>--justification=JUSTIFICATION</b>
              Bugs  in  Debian that have <b>serious</b>, <b>grave</b>, or <b>critical</b> severities must meet certain criteria to be
              classified as such.  This option allows you to specify the justification  for  a  release-critical
              bug, instead of being prompted for it.

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--kudos</b>
              Send appreciative email to the recorded maintainer address, rather than filing a bug report.  (You
              can  also  send  kudos  to  <u><a href="mailto:packagename@packages.debian.org">packagename@packages.debian.org</a></u>,  for  packages in the Debian archive;
              however, this option uses the Maintainer address from the control file, so  it  works  with  other
              package sources too.)

       <b>-K</b> <b>KEYID,</b> <b>--keyid=KEYID</b>
              Private  key  to  use  for  PGP/GnuPG  signatures.   If not specified, the first key in the secret
              keyring that matches your email address will be used.

       <b>--latest-first</b>
              Display the bug reports list sorted and with the latest reports at the top.

       <b>--license</b>
              Show <b>reportbug</b>'s copyright and license information on standard output.

       <b>--list-cc=ADDRESS</b>
              Send a carbon copy of the report to the specified list after a report number is assigned; this  is
              the  equivalent  to the option <u>-P</u> <u>'X-Debbugs-CC:</u> <u>ADDRESS'</u>.  This option will only work as intended
              with <b>debbugs</b> systems.

       <b>--list-cc-me</b>
              Send a carbon copy of the report to your automatically  detected  email  address  after  a  report
              number  is  assigned. This sets an <u>X-Debbugs-CC</u> pseudo-header specifying that address. This option
              will only work as intended with <b>debbugs</b> systems. See the documentation for the <u>--email</u> option  and
              the <u>ENVIRONMENT</u> section for information on how reportbug detects your email address.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--maintonly</b>
              Only  send  the bug to the package maintainer; the bug tracking system will not send a copy to the
              bug report distribution lists.

       <b>--max-attachment-size=MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE</b>
              Specify the maximum size any attachment file can have (this also include the file for  --body-file
              option).  If  an  attachment file is too big, there could be problems in delivering the email (and
              also to compose it), so we set a limit to attachment size. By default this is 10 megabytes.

       <b>--mirror=MIRRORS</b>
              Add a BTS mirror.

       <b>--mode=MODE</b>
              Set the operating mode for <b>reportbug</b>.  <b>reportbug</b> currently has four operating modes:  <b>novice</b>  (the
              default), <b>standard</b>, <b>advanced</b>, and <b>expert</b>.

              <b>novice</b> mode is designed to minimize prompting about things that "ordinary users" would be unlikely
              to  know or care about, shifting the triage burden onto the maintainer.  Checking for new versions
              is only done for the stable distribution in this mode.  It is currently the default mode.

              <b>standard</b> mode includes a relatively large number of prompts and tries to encourage  users  to  not
              file frivolous or duplicate bug reports.

              <b>advanced</b> mode is like <b>standard</b> mode, but may include shortcuts suitable for more advanced users of
              Debian,  without  being as close to the metal (and potential flamage) as <b>expert</b> mode.  (Currently,
              the only differences from <b>standard</b> mode are that it assumes familiarity with the "new"  queue;  it
              allows  the reporting of bugs on "dependency" packages; and it does not prompt where to insert the
              report text in the editor.)

              <b>expert</b> mode is designed  to  minimize  prompts  that  are  designed  to  discourage  frivolous  or
              unnecessary  bug  reports,  "severity inflation," and the like.  In <b>expert</b> mode, <b>reportbug</b> assumes
              the user is thoroughly familiar with Debian policies.  In practice, this means that reporters  are
              no  longer  required  to  justify  setting  a high severity on a bug report, and certain automated
              cleanups of the message are bypassed.  Individuals who do not regularly contribute to  the  Debian
              project  are <u>highly</u> discouraged from using expert mode, as it can lead to flamage from maintainers
              when used improperly.

       <b>-M,</b> <b>--mutt</b>
              Instead of spawning an editor to revise the bug report, use the <b>mutt</b> mail reader to edit and  send
              it.

       <b>--mta=MTA</b>
              Specify  an alternate <u>MTA</u>, instead of <b>/usr/sbin/sendmail</b> (the default).  Any <b>smtphost</b> setting will
              override this one.

       <b>--mua=MUA</b>
              Instead of spawning an editor to revise the bug report, use the specified <u>MUA</u> (mail user agent) to
              edit and send it. <b>--mutt</b> and <b>--nmh</b> options are processed.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--mh,</b> <b>--nmh</b>
              Instead of spawning an editor to revise the bug report, use the <b>comp</b> command (part of the <b>nmh</b>  and
              <b>mh</b> mail systems) to edit and send it.

       <b>-N</b> <b>BUGNUMBER,</b> <b>--bugnumber</b> <b>BUGNUMBER</b>
              Run  <b>reportbug</b>  against the specified bug report, useful when following-up a bug and its number is
              already known.

       <b>--no-bug-script</b>
              Do not execute the bug script (if present); this option can be useful together with --template  to
              suppress every interactive action, since some bug scripts can ask questions.

       <b>--no-cc-menu</b>
              Don't display the menu to enter additional addresses (CC).

       <b>--no-tags-menu</b>
              Don't display the menu to enter additional tags.

       <b>-o</b> <b>FILE,</b> <b>--output=FILE</b>
              Instead of sending an email, redirect it to the specified filename.

              The output file is a full dump of the email message, so it contains both headers and mail body. If
              you want to use it as a template to create a new bug report, see the --resume-saved option.

       <b>-O,</b> <b>--offline</b>
              Disable   all   external   queries.    Currently  has  the  same  effect  as  <b>--no-check-available</b>
              <b>--no-query-bts</b>.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--print</b>
              Instead of sending an email, print the bug report to standard output, so you can redirect it to  a
              file or pipe it to another program.

              This  option  only outputs a template for a bug report (but, differently from <b>--template</b> it's more
              interactive); you will need to fill in the long description.

       <b>--paranoid</b>
              Show the contents of the message before it is sent, including all headers.  Automatically disabled
              if in template mode.

       <b>--no-paranoid</b>
              Don't show the full contents of the message before it is sent (default).

       <b>--pgp</b>  Attach a digital signature to the bug report  using  <b>PGP</b>  (Pretty  Good  Privacy).   Please  note,
              however,  that the Debian project is phasing out the use of <b>PGP</b> in favor of <b>GnuPG</b>.  (This argument
              will be ignored if using an MUA to edit and send your report.)

       <b>--proxy=PROXY,</b> <b>--http_proxy=PROXY</b>
              Specify the WWW proxy server to use to handle the query of the bug tracking  system.   You  should
              only  need this parameter if you are behind a firewall.  The <u>PROXY</u> argument should be formatted as
              a valid HTTP URL, including (if necessary) a port number; for example, <b><a href="http://192.168.1.1">http://192.168.1.1</a>:3128/</b>.

       <b>-P</b> <b>PSEUDO-HEADER,</b> <b>--pseudo-header=PSEUDO-HEADER</b>
              Add a custom pseudo-header to your report; for example, to add the  <u>mytag</u>  usertag  for  the  user
              <u><a href="mailto:humberto@example.com">humberto@example.com</a></u>  to  the  bug,  you  could  use <u>-P</u> <u>'User:</u> <u><a href="mailto:humberto@example.com">humberto@example.com</a>'</u> <u>-P</u> <u>'Usertags:</u>
              <u>mytag'</u>.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Suppress diagnostic messages to standard error.

       <b>-Q,</b> <b>--query-only</b>
              Do not submit a bug report; just query the BTS.  Option ignored if you specify <b>--no-bts-query</b>.

       <b>--query-source</b>
              Query on all binary packages built by the same source, not just the binary package specified.

       <b>--no-query-source</b>
              Only query on the binary package specified on the command line.

       <b>--realname=NAME</b>
              Set the real name (human-readable name) to use for your report.

       <b>--report-quiet</b>
              Register the bug in the bug tracking system, but don't send a report to the package maintainer  or
              anyone else.  Don't do this unless you're the maintainer of the package in question, or you really
              know what you are doing.

       <b>--reply-to=ADDRESS,</b> <b>--replyto=ADDRESS</b>
              Set the <b>Reply-To</b> address header in your report.

       <b>-r</b> <b>TEMPFILE,</b> <b>--resume-saved=TEMPFILE</b>
              Use this to resume an unsent report previously saved by reportbug. Note that attachments stored in
              <u>TEMPFILE</u> are ignored; if you want to attach any files you need to do that again.

       <b>-s</b> <b>SUBJECT,</b> <b>--subject=SUBJECT</b>
              Set  the  subject  of  the  bug  report  (i.e.  a  brief  explanation of the problem, less than 60
              characters).  If you do not specify this switch, you will be prompted for a subject.

       <b>--security-team</b>
              If the 'security' tag is set, this option will explicitly specify to send the report only  to  the
              Debian Security Team, as this is an undisclosed vulnerability.

       <b>--no-security-team</b>
              If  the  'security' tag is set, this option will explicitly specify to not send the report only to
              the Debian Security Team, as this is not an undisclosed vulnerability.

       <b>-S</b> <b>SEVERITY,</b> <b>--severity=SEVERITY</b>
              Specify a severity level, from <b>critical</b>, <b>grave</b>, <b>serious</b>, <b>important</b>, <b>normal</b>, <b>minor</b>, and <b>wishlist</b>.

       <b>--smtphost=HOST[:PORT]</b>
              Use the mail  transport  agent  (MTA)  at  <b>HOST</b>  to  send  your  report,  instead  of  your  local
              <b>/usr/sbin/sendmail</b>  program.   This  should  generally be your ISP's outgoing mail server; you can
              also use 'localhost' if you have a working mail server running on your machine.  If  the  <b>PORT</b>  is
              omitted, the standard port for SMTP, port 25, is used.

       <b>--timeout=SECONDS</b>
              Specify  the  network timeout, the number of seconds to wait for a resource to respond. If nothing
              is specified, a default timeout of 1 minute is selected.

              In case of a network error, there are chances it's due to a  too  low  timeout:  try  passing  the
              --timeout option with a higher value than default.

       <b>--tls</b>  If  using SMTP, use Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption to secure the connection to the mail
              server.  Some SMTP servers may require this option. Note  that  this  option  is  ignored  if  you
              connect to your SMTP server via port 465, which already implies using SSL/TLS.

       <b>--smtpuser=USERNAME</b>
              If using SMTP, use the specified <u>USERNAME</u> for authentication.

       <b>--smtppasswd=PASSWORD</b>
              If  using SMTP, use the specified <u>PASSWORD</u> for authentication.  If the password isn't specified on
              the command line or in the configuration file, a prompt will be displayed asking for it.

              Use of this option is insecure on multiuser systems.  Instead,  you  should  set  this  option  in
              <b>$HOME/.reportbugrc</b>   and   ensure  it  is  only  readable  by  your  user  (e.g.  with  <b>chmod</b>  <b>600</b>
              <b>$HOME/.reportbugrc</b>).

       <b>--src,</b> <b>--source</b>
              Specify to report the bug against  the  source  package,  and  not  the  binary  package  (default
              behaviour).   In  order for this option to work, you have to populate the relevant 'deb-src' lines
              in <a href="file:/etc/apt/sources.list">/etc/apt/sources.list</a> so that apt cache will know about source packages too.

              You can also specify the package name with a 'src:' prefix instead of using  this  option  if  you
              already know the name of the source package.

       <b>-t</b> <b>TYPE,</b> <b>--type=TYPE</b>
              Specify the type of report to be submitted; currently accepts either <b>gnats</b> or <b>debbugs</b>.

       <b>-T</b> <b>TAG,</b> <b>--tag=TAG</b>
              Specify a tag to be filed on this report, for example <b>--tag=patch</b>.  Multiple tags can be specified
              using multiple <b>-T/--tag</b> arguments.

              Alternatively,  you  can  specify  the 'tag' <b>none</b> to bypass the tags prompt without specifying any
              tags; this will also ignore any tags specified on the command line.

       <b>--template</b>
              Output a template report to standard output. Differently from  <b>-p/--print</b>,  it  tries  to  be  not
              interactive,  and  presents  a  template  without  user's  input.  You may need to combine it with
              --no-bug-script if you want to avoid all user interaction.

       <b>-u</b> <b>INTERFACE,</b> <b>--interface=INTERFACE,</b> <b>--ui=INTERFACE</b>
              Specify the user interface to use.  Valid options are <b>text</b>, <b>urwid</b>, and <b>gtk</b>; default is taken  from
              the <b>reportbug</b> configuration files.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verify</b>
              Verify the integrity of the package (if installed) using <b>debsums</b> before reporting.

       <b>--no-verify</b>
              Do not verify the integrity of the package with <b>debsums</b>.

       <b>-V</b> <b>VERSION,</b> <b>--package-version=VERSION</b>
              Specify  the version of the package the problem was found in.  This is probably most useful if you
              are reporting a bug in a package that is not installable or installed on a different system.

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--no-cc</b>
              Don't send a blind carbon copy (BCC) of the bug report to the submitter (i.e. yourself).

       <b>-z,</b> <b>--no-compress</b>
              Don't compress configuration files by removing comments and blank lines.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>reportbug</b> <b>lynx-ssl</b>
              Report a bug in the lynx-ssl package.

       <b>reportbug</b> <b>--path</b> <b>--filename=ls</b>
              Report a bug in the installed package that includes a program in your path called <b>ls</b>.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       From version 0.22 on, <b>reportbug</b> has supported a simple run control file syntax.  Commands are  read  from
       <b>/etc/reportbug.conf</b> and <b>$HOME/.reportbugrc</b> with commands in the latter overriding those in the former.

       Commands are not case sensitive, and currently take 0 or 1 argument; arguments containing whitespace must
       be enclosed in quotes.

       Any line starting with <b>#</b> is taken to be a comment and will be ignored.

       Generally,  options  corresponding  to  the  long options for <b>reportbug</b> are supported, without leading <b>--</b>
       sequences.  See <b><a href="../man5/reportbug.conf.5.html">reportbug.conf</a>(5)</b> for all acceptable options and detailed information.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>VISUAL</b> Editor to use for editing your bug report.

       <b>EDITOR</b> Editor to use for editing the bug report (overridden by <b>VISUAL</b>).

       <b>REPORTBUGEMAIL,</b> <b>DEBEMAIL,</b> <b>EMAIL</b>
              Email address to use as your from address (in this order). If no environment variable exists,  the
              default is taken from your user name and <b>/etc/mailname</b>.

       <b>DEBFULLNAME,</b> <b>DEBNAME,</b> <b>NAME</b>
              Real name to use; default is taken from <b><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></b>.

       <b>REPLYTO</b>
              Address for <b>Reply-To</b> header in outgoing mail.

       <b>MAILCC</b> Use the specified CC address on your email.  Note you can also use the <b>-H</b> option for this (and for
              Bcc's too).

       <b>MAILBCC</b>
              Use  the  specified  BCC address, instead of your email address.  (CC and BCC based on suggestions
              from Herbert Thielen in the <b>bug</b> wishlist).

       <b>http_proxy</b>
              Provides the address of a proxy server to handle the BTS query.  This should be a valid  <b>http</b>  URL
              for  a proxy server, including any required port number (simply specifying a hostname, or omitting
              a port other than 80, WILL NOT WORK).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>reportbug</b> should probably be compatible with other bug tracking systems, like <b>bugzilla</b> (used by the GNOME
       and Mozilla projects) and <b>jitterbug</b> (used by Samba, AbiSource and FreeCiv) but it isn't.
