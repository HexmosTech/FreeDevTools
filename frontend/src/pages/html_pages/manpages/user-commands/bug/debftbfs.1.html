       debftbfs - list packages that have FTBFS bugs filed

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       usage: debftbfs [-h] [-d] [-v]

              [--distribution                  {stable,testing,unstable,experimental}]                 [--source
              {auto,udd-mirror.d.n,udd.d.o,bugs.d.o}]

       Query udd or bugs.debian.org for all source packages which currently have FTBFS bugs filed  against  them
       for  a given distribution (default: unstable) in "main".  If the psql utility is installed, the data will
       be queried from udd-mirror.debian.net. Otherwise it will come from udd.debian.org. Querying the former is
       a bit faster but the data might be not 100% up to date. The result is a line-based list of source package
       names, their FTBFS bug and the bug title, separated by a space.  Only bugs  tagged  'ftbfs'  and  with  a
       severity  greater  or  equal  to  'serious'  are  selected.  The result is sorted by source package name,
       alphabetically ascending.

       The three available data sources differ in how fast it is to retrieve the data, how up-to-date  the  data
       is  and  in  the  chosen  heuristic  to  decide  which  ftbfs bugs affect which source package in a given
       distribution. The fastest two data sources are udd-mirror.debian.net and udd.debian.org with  the  former
       being  around  20%  faster  than  the latter but either finish in under a second. The former will be more
       outdated than the latter though at is is  only  a  mirror.   The  slowest  method  is  directly  querying
       bugs.debian.org via its SOAP interface.  While querying bugs.debian.org will retrieve the most up-to-date
       information,  the  heuristics  chosen  to  decide  whether  a  source package is affected by an ftbfs bug
       slightly differs to the heuristic used by udd. Differences mostly occur for bugs that were re-assigned to
       different source packages or have otherwise missing or incorrect metadata stored.
