</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is designed to help you generate bug reports (and thank-you notes) about perl5 and the
       modules which ship with it.

       In most cases, you can just run it interactively from a command line without any special arguments and
       follow the prompts.

       If you have found a bug with a non-standard port (one that was not part of the <u>standard</u> <u>distribution</u>), a
       binary distribution, or a non-core module (such as Tk, DBI, etc), then please see the documentation that
       came with that distribution to determine the correct place to report bugs.

       Bug reports should be submitted to the GitHub issue tracker at &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;.
       The <b><a href="mailto:perlbug@perl.org">perlbug@perl.org</a></b> address no longer automatically opens tickets. You can use this tool to compose your
       report and save it to a file which you can then submit to the issue tracker.

       In extreme cases, <b>perlbug</b> may not work well enough on your system to guide you through composing a bug
       report. In those cases, you may be able to use <b>perlbug</b> <b>-d</b> or <b>perl</b> <b>-V</b> to get system configuration
       information to include in your issue report.

       When reporting a bug, please run through this checklist:

       What version of Perl you are running?
           Type "perl -v" at the command line to find out.

       Are you running the latest released version of perl?
           Look at &lt;<a href="http://www.perl.org/">http://www.perl.org/</a>&gt; to find out.  If you are not using the latest released version, please
           try to replicate your bug on the latest stable release.

           Note  that  reports  about  bugs in old versions of Perl, especially those which indicate you haven't
           also tested the current stable release of Perl,  are  likely  to  receive  less  attention  from  the
           volunteers who build and maintain Perl than reports about bugs in the current release.

       Are you sure what you have is a bug?
           A significant number of the bug reports we get turn out to be documented features in Perl.  Make sure
           the issue you've run into isn't intentional by glancing through the documentation that comes with the
           Perl distribution.

           Given  the sheer volume of Perl documentation, this isn't a trivial undertaking, but if you can point
           to documentation that suggests the behaviour you're seeing is <u>wrong</u>, your issue is likely to  receive
           more  attention.  You  may  want to start with <b>perldoc</b> perltrap for pointers to common traps that new
           (and experienced) Perl programmers run into.

           If you're unsure of the meaning of an error message  you've  run  across,  <b>perldoc</b>  perldiag  for  an
           explanation.   If  the  message isn't in perldiag, it probably isn't generated by Perl.  You may have
           luck consulting your operating system documentation instead.

           If you are on a non-UNIX platform <b>perldoc</b> perlport, as some features may  be  unimplemented  or  work
           differently.

           You  may be able to figure out what's going wrong using the Perl debugger.  For information about how
           to use the debugger <b>perldoc</b> perldebug.

       Do you have a proper test case?
           The easier it is to reproduce your bug, the more likely it will be fixed -- if nobody  can  duplicate
           your problem, it probably won't be addressed.

           A  good  test  case  has  most  of these attributes: short, simple code; few dependencies on external
           commands, modules, or libraries; no platform-dependent code (unless it's  a  platform-specific  bug);
           clear, simple documentation.

           A  good test case is almost always a good candidate to be included in Perl's test suite.  If you have
           the time, consider writing your test case so that it can be easily included into  the  standard  test
           suite.

       Have you included all relevant information?
           Be  sure  to  include  the  <b>exact</b> error messages, if any.  "Perl gave an error" is not an exact error
           message.

           If you get a core dump (or equivalent), you may use a debugger (<b>dbx</b>, <b>gdb</b>, etc)  to  produce  a  stack
           trace to include in the bug report.

           NOTE:  unless your Perl has been compiled with debug info (often <b>-g</b>), the stack trace is likely to be
           somewhat hard to use because it will most probably contain only the  function  names  and  not  their
           arguments.   If  possible,  recompile your Perl with debug info and reproduce the crash and the stack
           trace.

       Can you describe the bug in plain English?
           The easier it is to understand a reproducible bug, the more likely it will be fixed.  Any insight you
           can provide into the problem will help a great deal.  In other words, try to analyze the problem  (to
           the extent you can) and report your discoveries.

       Can you fix the bug yourself?
           If so, that's great news; bug reports with patches are likely to receive significantly more attention
           and  interest  than  those  without  patches.   Please  submit your patch via the GitHub Pull Request
           workflow as described in <b>perldoc</b> perlhack.  You may  also  send  patches  to  <b><a href="mailto:perl5-porters@perl.org">perl5-porters@perl.org</a></b>.
           When  sending  a patch, create it using "git format-patch" if possible, though a unified diff created
           with "diff -pu" will do nearly as well.

           Your patch may be returned with requests for changes, or  requests  for  more  detailed  explanations
           about your fix.

           Here are a few hints for creating high-quality patches:

           Make  sure  the patch is not reversed (the first argument to diff is typically the original file, the
           second argument your changed file).  Make sure you test your patch by applying it with  "git  am"  or
           the  "patch" program before you send it on its way.  Try to follow the same style as the code you are
           trying to patch.  Make sure your patch really does work ("make test", if the thing you're patching is
           covered by Perl's test suite).

       Can you use "perlbug" to submit a thank-you note?
           Yes, you can do this by either using the "-T" option, or by invoking  the  program  as  "perlthanks".
           Thank-you notes are good. It makes people smile.

       Please  make your issue title informative.  "a bug" is not informative.  Neither is "perl crashes" nor is
       "HELP!!!".  These don't help.  A compact description of what's wrong is fine.

       Having done your bit, please be prepared to wait, to be told the bug is in your code, or possibly to  get
       no  reply  at all.  The volunteers who maintain Perl are busy folks, so if your problem is an obvious bug
       in your own code, is difficult to understand or is a duplicate of an existing report, you may not receive
       a personal reply.

       If it is important to you that your bug be fixed, do monitor the issue tracker (you will be subscribed to
       notifications for issues you submit or comment on) and the commit logs to development versions  of  Perl,
       and  encourage  the maintainers with kind words or offers of frosty beverages.  (Please do be kind to the
       maintainers.  Harassing or flaming them is likely to have the opposite effect of the one you want.)

       Feel free to update the ticket about your bug on &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt; if a new  version
       of Perl is released and your bug is still present.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>      Address to send the report to instead of saving to a file.

       <b>-b</b>      Body  of  the  report.  If not included on the command line, or in a file with <b>-f</b>, you will get a
               chance to edit the report.

       <b>-C</b>      Don't send copy to administrator when sending report by mail.

       <b>-c</b>      Address to send copy of report to when sending report by mail.  Defaults to the  address  of  the
               local perl administrator (recorded when perl was built).

       <b>-d</b>      Data mode (the default if you redirect or pipe output).  This prints out your configuration data,
               without saving or mailing anything.  You can use this with <b>-v</b> to get more complete data.

       <b>-e</b>      Editor to use.

       <b>-f</b>      File containing the body of the report.  Use this to quickly send a prepared report.

       <b>-F</b>      File to output the results to.  Defaults to <b>perlbug.rep</b>.

       <b>-h</b>      Prints a brief summary of the options.

       <b>-ok</b>     Report  successful  build  on  this system to perl porters. Forces <b>-S</b> and <b>-C</b>. Forces and supplies
               values for <b>-s</b> and <b>-b</b>. Only prompts for a return address if it  cannot  guess  it  (for  use  with
               <b>make</b>).  Honors  return  address specified with <b>-r</b>.  You can use this with <b>-v</b> to get more complete
               data.   Only makes a report if this system is less than 60 days old.

       <b>-okay</b>   As <b>-ok</b> except it will report on older systems.

       <b>-nok</b>    Report unsuccessful build on this system.  Forces <b>-C</b>.  Forces and supplies a value for  <b>-s</b>,  then
               requires you to edit the report and say what went wrong.  Alternatively, a prepared report may be
               supplied  using <b>-f</b>.  Only prompts for a return address if it cannot guess it (for use with <b>make</b>).
               Honors return address specified with <b>-r</b>.  You can use this with <b>-v</b> to  get  more  complete  data.
               Only makes a report if this system is less than 60 days old.

       <b>-nokay</b>  As <b>-nok</b> except it will report on older systems.

       <b>-p</b>      The  names  of  one or more patch files or other text attachments to be included with the report.
               Multiple files must be separated with commas.

       <b>-r</b>      Your return address.  The program will ask you to confirm its  default  if  you  don't  use  this
               option.

       <b>-S</b>      Save or send the report without asking for confirmation.

       <b>-s</b>      Subject  to include with the report.  You will be prompted if you don't supply one on the command
               line.

       <b>-t</b>      Test mode.  Makes it possible to command perlbug from a pipe or file, for testing purposes.

       <b>-T</b>      Send a thank-you note instead of a bug report.

       <b>-v</b>      Include verbose configuration data in the report.
