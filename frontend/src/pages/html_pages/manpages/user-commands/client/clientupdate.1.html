</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       clientupdate - Xymon client update utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>clientupdate</b> <b>[options]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>clientupdate</b>  is part of the Xymon client. It is responsible for updating an existing client installation
       from a central repository of client packages stored on the Xymon server.

       When the Xymon client sends a normal client report to the Xymon server,  the  server  responds  with  the
       section  of  the  <u><a href="../man5/client-local.cfg.5.html">client-local.cfg</a>(5)</u>  file  that  is  relevant to this client. Included in this may be a
       "clientversion" value. The clientversion received  from  the  server  is  compared  against  the  current
       clientversion    installed    on    the    client,    as    determined    by    the   contents   of   the
       $XYMONHOME/etc/clientversion.cfg file. If the two versions are not identical, clientupdate is launched to
       update the client installation.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --level
              Report the current clientversion.

       --update=NEWVERSION
              Attempt to update the client to NEWVERSION by fetching this version of the  client  software  from
              the Xymon server.

       --reexec
              Used internally during the update process, see <b>OPERATION</b> below.

       --remove-self
              Used  internally during the update process. This option causes the running clientupdate utility to
              delete itself - it is used during the update to purge a temporary copy of the clientupdate utility
              that is installed in $XYMONTMP.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>CLIENTUPDATE</b> <b>IN</b> <b>XYMON</b></h4><pre>
       To manage updating clients without having to logon to each server, you can use the clientupdate  utility.
       This is how you setup the release of a new client version.

       Create the new client
              Setup  the  new client $XYMONHOME directory, e.g. by copying an existing client installation to an
              empty directory and modifying it for your needs. It is a good idea to delete all files in the tmp/
              and logs/ directories, since there is no need to copy these  over  to  all  of  the  clients.  Pay
              attention  to  the etc/ files, and make sure that they are suitable for the systems where you want
              to deploy this new client.  You can add files - e.g. extension scripts in the ext/ directory - but
              the clientupdate utility cannot delete or rename files.

       Package the client
              When your new client software is ready, create a tar-file of the new client. All files in the  tar
              archive  must have file names relative to the clients' $XYMONHOME (usually, ~xymon/client/).  Save
              the tar file on the Xymon server in ~xymon/server/download/somefile.tar.  Don't compress  it.   It
              is  recommended  that  you  use some sort of operating-system and version-numbering scheme for the
              filename, but you can choose whatever filename suits you - the only requirement is  that  it  must
              end  with  ".tar".  The  part  of  the  filename  preceding  ".tar"  is what Xymon will use as the
              "clientversion" ID.

       Configure which hosts receive the new client
              In the <u><a href="../man5/client-local.cfg.5.html">client-local.cfg</a>(5)</u> file, you must now setup a <b>clientversion:ID</b> line where the  <b>ID</b>  matches
              the  filename  you  used  for  the  tar-file. So if you have packaged the new client into the file
              <b>linux.v2.tar</b>, then the corresponding entry in client-local.cfg would be <b>clientversion:linux.v2</b>.

       Wait for xymond to reload client-local.cfg
              xymond will automatically reload the client-local.cfg file after at most 10 minutes. If  you  want
              to force an immediate reload, send a SIGHUP signal to the xymond process.

       Wait for the client to update
              The next time the client contacts the Xymon server to send the client data, it will notice the new
              clientversion  setting  in  client-local.cfg,  and will run <b>clientupdate</b> to install the new client
              software. So when the client runs the next time, it will use the new client software.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>clientupdate</b> runs in two steps:

       Re-exec step
              The first step is when clientupdate is first invoked  from  the  xymonclient.sh  script  with  the
              "--re-exec"  option. This step copies the clientupdate program from $XYMONHOME/bin/ to a temporary
              file in the $XYMONTMP directory.  This is to avoid conflicts when the update procedure installs  a
              new  version  of  the  clientupdate utility itself. Upon completion of this step, the clientupdate
              utility automatically launches the next step by running the program from the file in $XYMONTMP.

       Update step
              The second step downloads the new client software from the Xymon server.  The new software must be
              packed into a tar file, which clientupdate then unpacks into the $XYMONHOME directory.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       clientupdate uses several of the standard Xymon environment variables, including <b>XYMONHOME</b> and <b>XYMONTMP</b>.
