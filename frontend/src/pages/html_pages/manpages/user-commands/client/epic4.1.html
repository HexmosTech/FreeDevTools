       epic4 — Internet Relay Chat client for UNIX like systems

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>epic4</b>  [<u>-a</u>]  [<u>-b</u>]  [<u>-B</u>]  [<u>-c</u>  <u>chan</u>]  [<u>-d</u>]  [<u>-f</u>]  [<u>-F</u>]  [<u>-h</u>]  [<u>-H</u>  <u>hostname</u>]  [<u>-l</u>  <u>filename</u>] [<u>-L</u> <u>filename</u>]
             [<u>-n</u> <u>nickname</u>] [<u>-o</u>] [<u>-O</u>] [<u>-p</u> <u>port</u>] [<u>-q</u>] [<u>-v</u>] [<u>-x</u>] [<u>-z</u> <u>username</u>] [<u>nickname</u>] [<u>server</u> <u>description</u> <u>list</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>ircII/EPIC</b> program is a unix-based character oriented user agent ('client') to Internet  Relay  Chat.
       It  is  a  fully functional ircII client with many useful extensions.  This version works with all modern
       irc server classes as of early 1999.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>    Append the server description list to the default server list.  The default  behavior  is  for  the
             server description list to replace the default server list.

       <b>-b</b>    Operate  in  so called “bot mode.” This implies the [<u>-d</u>] option.  EPIC will <u><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a></u>(2) immediately and
             the parent process will exit, returning you to your shell.  Some system administrators do not  look
             kindly to their users running bots, and they have disabled this option.  Even if your administrator
             has  not  disabled  it, you should not assume this gives you automatic permission to run a bot.  If
             you do run a bot without permission, your administrator may get very angry with you,  and  possibly
             revoke  your  account.   In  addition,  most  IRC operators on public irc networks have very little
             tolerance for people who run bots.  So  just  a  word  of  caution,  make  sure  that  your  system
             administrator and your irc administrator have given you permission before you run a bot.

       <b>-B</b>    Force  the startup file to be loaded immediately rather than waiting until a connection to a server
             is established.

       <b>-c</b> <u>chan</u>
             Join the specified channel the first time you successfully connect to a server.

       <b>-d</b>    Operate in “dumb mode.” The client will not put up a  full  screen  display,  and  will  read  from
             standard  input  and  write  to standard output.  This is useful if the output normally looks awful
             (because you are using an incorrect TERM setting, or your  terminal  description  is  spectacularly
             broken),  or  you  just  don't  want  to  use  the pretty interface.  This option will be turned on
             automatically if your current TERM setting is not capable of a full screen display.

       <b>-f</b>    Force use of hardware flow control.  With  this  option,  the  control-S  and  control-Q  keys  are
             probably not available to be bound to something else.

       <b>-F</b>    Disable  use  of  hardware  flow  control.   With this option, the control-S and control-Q keys are
             available to be bound to something else.  However, you will not have hardware flow control.

       <b>-h</b>    Display a moderately concise help message and exit immediately.

       <b>-H</b> <u>hostname</u>
             Use the IP address of the specified hostname as your default IP address.  This can be used  if  you
             have  multiple  IP  addresses  on  the  same  machine and you want to use an address other than the
             default address.  You might need to use this option when <u><a href="../man3/gethostname.3.html">gethostname</a></u>(3) does not return a  hostname
             (in some poorly configured NIS environments).  The use of multiple IP addresses on a single machine
             is  commonly  referred  to  as  "virtual hosting", and each IP address is a "virtual host".  Please
             understand that an irc client may not tell the irc server what your hostname should be:  the server
             alone determines that.  Servers typically use the canonical hostname for  an  IP  address  as  your
             hostname.   Because of this, this option will not permit you to use a CNAME (secondary hostname for
             an IP address), because the server will use the canonical hostname instead.  This option  overrides
             the IRCHOST environment variable.

       <b>-l</b> <u>filename,[filename]</u>
             Use  the  specified filename(s) as the startup file.  The startup file is loaded the first time you
             successfully connect to a server, unless you specify the [<u>-B</u>] option.   This  overrides  the  IRCRC
             environment  variable.   If this option is not specified, and the IRCRC environment variable is not
             set, then <u><a href="file:~/.ircrc">~/.ircrc</a></u> is the default startup file.

       <b>-n</b> <u>nickname</u>
             Use the specified nickname as the default nickname whenever you connect to  an  irc  server.   This
             option  overrides  the  IRCNICK environment variable.  This option can be overridden if you specify
             nickname argument in the command line (see below).

       <b>-o</b>    Force use of IEXTEN termios characters.  POSIX systems are allowed to  reserve  additional  control
             characters  to  perform  special  actions  when  IEXTEN is turned on.  On 4.4BSD, the control-V and
             control-O keys are used by IEXTEN and thus cannot be used in key bindings  within  EPIC  since  the
             terminal never sends them to EPIC.

       <b>-O</b>    Disable  use  of  IEXTEN  termios characters.  This makes all of the keys reserved by your system's
             IEXTEN termios option available to be used in key bindings.  On 4.4BSD, this flag is  necessary  if
             you want to use control-V and control-O in your key bindings.

       <b>-p</b> <u>port</u>
             Use the specified port as the default port for new server connections.  The default port is usually
             6667.   Make sure that the servers you want to connect to are listening on this port before you try
             to connect there.

       <b>-q</b>    Suppress the loading of any file when you first establish a connection to an irc server.

       <b>-v</b>    Output version identification (VID) information and exit.

       <b>-x</b>    This undocumented feature turns on all of the XDEBUG flags.  Refer to the help files for XDEBUG  if
             you want to know what happens if you use this.

       <b>-z</b> <u>username</u>
             Use  the  specified username when negotiating a connection to a new irc server.  This overrides the
             IRCUSER environment variable.  If this option is not specified, then the  user  name  specified  in
             <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u>  for  your user is used.  This feature was formerly undocumented, but with the rise and
             popularity and use of <u><a href="../man8/identd.8.html">identd</a></u>(8) this option is much less useful than it once was.  Requests to have
             this option removed will probably be ignored.   If  you  don't  want  your  users  to  spoof  their
             usernames, install identd, and do everyone on IRC a favor.

       nickname
             The  first  bare  word  found  is  taken  as the default nickname to use.  This overrides all other
             options, including the -n option and the IRCNICK environment variable.  If all else fails, then the
             client uses your login name as the default nickname.

       server,[server]
             After the nickname, a list of one or more server specifications can be listed.  Unless you  specify
             the -a option, this will replace your default server list!  The -a option forces any servers listed
             here to be appended to the default server list.  The format for server specifications is:

                   <b>hostname:port:password:nick</b>

             Any item can be omitted by leaving the field blank, and any trailing colons can also be omitted.

</pre><h4><b>DETAILED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>The</b> <b>Screen:</b>
       The  screen is split into two parts, separated by an inverse-video status line (if supported).  The upper
       (larger) part of the screen displays responses from the <u><a href="../man8/ircd.8.html">ircd</a></u>(8) server.  The lower part of the screen  (a
       single line) accepts keyboard input.

       Some  terminals  do  not support certain features required by <b>epic4</b> , in which case you receive a message
       stating this.  If this occurs, try changing the terminal type or run <b>epic4</b> with the -d option.

   <b>Irc</b> <b>Commands:</b>
       Any line beginning with the slash character “/” is regarded as an <b>epic4</b> command  (the  command  character
       may  be  changed).   Any line not beginning with this character is treated as a message to be sent to the
       current channel.  The client has a built in  help  system.   Install  the  help  files  (they  should  be
       available at the same place you got the client) and then type “/help” to open up the help system.

   <b>The</b> <b>.ircrc</b> <b>File:</b>
       When  <b>epic4</b>  is executed, it checks the user's home directory for a <u><a href="file:~/.ircrc">~/.ircrc</a></u> file, executing the commands
       in the file.  Commands in this file do not need to  have  a  leading  slash  character  “/”  This  allows
       predefinition of aliases and other features.

</pre><h4><b>PRACTICAL</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Certainly  any  description  of  <b>epic4</b>  in  this  man  page will be sorely inadequate because most of the
       confusion doesn't even start until after you get the client to connect to a server.  But  if  you  really
       have problems getting the client to connect to a server, try some of these:

       <b>epic4</b>  Try  this  first.   This  will assume all the defaults.  If the person who is maintaining epic4 at
              your site has done a halfway decent job, this will put you on a server that is somewhat  local  to
              you.

       <b>epic4</b> <b>nickname</b> <b>irc.domain.com</b>
              or   something   similar  will  attempt  to  connect  to  the  irc  server  running  on  the  host
              "irc.domain.com" (fill in a real irc server here) with the nickname of well, "nickname".  This  is
              the most common way to specify an alternate server to use.

       <b>epic4</b> <b>nickname</b> <b>irc.domain.com:6664</b>
              Sometimes,  some  servers  are  really  busy,  and  it  can  take  them a long time to establish a
              connection with you on the default port (6667).  Most major servers on big public networks  accept
              connections  on  many different ports, with the most common being most or all of the ports between
              6660 and 6675.  You can usually connect much faster if you use a port  other  than  6667,  if  the
              server you're connecting to supports an alternate port.

       <b>epic4</b> <b>nickname</b> <b>irc.efnet.net</b>
              If you're totally stumped and trying to get on efnet, try this.

       <b>epic4</b> <b>nickname</b> <b>irc.undernet.org</b>
              If you're totally stumped and trying to get on undernet, try this.

       <b>epic4</b> <b>nickname</b> <b>irc.dal.net</b>
              If you're totally stumped and trying to get on dalnet, try this.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/usr/bin/epic4</b>    the default location of the binary

       <b><a href="file:~/.ircrc">~/.ircrc</a></b>          default initialization file

       <b><a href="file:~/.irc/">~/.irc/</a></b>           directory you can put your own <b>epic4</b> scripts into, that can then be loaded with /load

       <b>/usr/share/epic4</b>  default  directory containing message-of-the-day, master initialization, help files and
                         <b>epic4</b> scripts

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>HELP</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Starting up the client is the easy part.  Once you get connected, you'll probably find you have  no  idea
       what  you're  doing.   That's where the help files come in.  If the person who maintains irc at your site
       didn't install the help files, pester them until they do.  Once the help files  are  available,  use  the
       “/help” command to get started.  There are a bazillion commands and a multitude of nuances that will take
       a few months to get down pat.  But once you do, you will be so firmly addicted to irc that your wife will
       divorce  you, your kids will leave you, your dog will run away, and you'll flunk all your classes, and be
       left to sing the blues.

</pre><h4><b>USEFUL</b> <b>WEB</b> <b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>&lt;<a href="http://www.epicsol.org/">http://www.epicsol.org/</a>&gt;</u> The EPIC home page

       <u>&lt;<a href="http://help.epicsol.org/">http://help.epicsol.org/</a>&gt;</u> The Online EPIC Help Pages

       <u>&lt;<a href="http://www.irchelp.org/">http://www.irchelp.org/</a>&gt;</u> Lots of great help for new irc users.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>epic4</b> handles the following signals gracefully

       SIGUSR1    Closes all DCC connections and EXEC'd processes.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       It can be helpful to predefine certain variables in in the <u><a href="file:~/.cshrc">~/.cshrc</a></u> , <u><a href="file:~/.profile">~/.profile</a></u> , or <u><a href="file:~/.login">~/.login</a></u> file:

       IRCNICK    The user's default IRC nickname

       IRCNAME    The user's default IRC realname (otherwise retrieved from <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u> )

       IRCSERVER  The user's default IRC server list (see server option for details)

       HOME       Overrides the default home page in <u>/etc/password</u>

       TERM       The type of terminal emulation to use

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man8/ircd.8.html">ircd</a></u>(8)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Any non-trivial piece of software has bugs.  ircII/EPIC is no exception.  You can refer to the  <u>KNOWNBUGS</u>
       file  that  is distributed with the client source code for a list of problems that are known to exist and
       may or may not be fixed some day.  If you find a bug that is not listed  there,  you  can  refer  to  the
       <u>BUG_FORM</u>  file  that  is  also distributed with the source code.  It will give you instructions on how to
       fill out the report and where to send it.

</pre><h4><b>ERRATA</b></h4><pre>
       The online documentation probably should be in docbook form rather than in the current help format.   The
       entire help system is a hack.  This manual page only describes the options to epic4, but doesn't tell you
       what to do once you get connected.
