</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Finch - A Pimpin' Penguin console frontend to libpurple. Instant Messaging client.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>finch</b> <u>[options]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>finch</b>  is  a  console-based modular messaging client based on libpurple which is capable of connecting to
       XMPP, IRC, SILC, Novell GroupWise, Lotus Sametime, Zephyr, Gadu-Gadu, and QQ all at  once.  It  has  many
       common features found in other clients, as well as many unique features.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are provided by <b>finch</b> using the standard GNU command line syntax:

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--config=</b><u>DIR</u>
              Use <u>DIR</u> as the directory for config files instead of <u><a href="file:~/.purple">~/.purple</a></u>.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--debug</b>
              Print  debugging  messages  to  stderr  and start with the <b>Debug</b> window. The messages shown in the
              <b>Debug</b> window are the same as the ones printed in stderr.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print this help and exit.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--nologin</b>
              Don't automatically login when <b>finch</b> starts.  Sets all accounts to Offline.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Display the version information window.

              # window-titles specifies that windows with these semi-colon separated titles are placed into this

</pre><h4><b>Widget</b> <b>Actions</b></h4><pre>
       You can specify key-bindings for specific widgets. The following entries in <u><a href="file:~/.gntrc">~/.gntrc</a></u>  correspond  to  the
       default keybindings for the actions:

       [GntBox::binding]
       tab = focus-next
       right = focus-next
       left = focus-prev

       [GntComboBox::binding]
       down = dropdown
       up = dropdown

       [GntEntry::binding]
       c-a = cursor-home
       home = cursor-home
       c-e = cursor-end
       end = cursor-end
       backspace = delete-prev
       del = delete-next
       c-d = delete-next
       c-u = delete-start
       c-k = delete-end
       c-b = cursor-prev
       left = cursor-prev
       c-f = cursor-next
       right = cursor-next
       tab = suggest-show
       down = suggest-next
       up = suggest-prev
       page-down = suggest-next-page
       page-up = suggest-prev-page
       c-w = delete-prev-word
       a-b = cursor-prev-word
       a-f = cursor-next-word
       a-d = delete-next-word
       c-v = clipboard-paste
       c-p = history-prev
       c-n = history-next
       c-r = history-search
       c-up = history-prev
       c-down = history-next

       [GntTree::binding]
       up = move-up
       down = move-down
       c-n = move-down
       c-p = move-up
       pageup = page-up
       pagedown = page-down
       backspace = move-parent
       home = move-first
       end = move-last
       # Following is the default binding for the context-menu
       menu = context-menu
       # The following will let you open the context-menu in the buddylist with c-b
       # c-b = context-menu

       [GntWidget::binding]
       f11 = context-menu
       c-x = context-menu

       [GntWindow::binding]
       c-o = show-menu
       f10 = show-menu

       The  <b>c-</b> corresponds to the <b>Control</b> key. You can also use <b>ctrl-</b> or <b>ctr-</b> or <b>ctl-</b> to indicate a combination.
       For alt-keys, you can use one of <b>a-</b>, <b>alt-</b>, <b>m-</b> or <b>meta-</b>. You can also use  <b>home</b>,  <b>end</b>,  <b>left</b>,  <b>right</b>  etc.
       keys.

       To  unbind  a  key  which has a default binding, you simply bind it to the empty string.  For example, to
       unbind <b>Alt</b> <b>+</b> <b>q</b> from the Quit function, you would use:

       [GntWM::binding]
       a-q =

</pre><h4><b>Menus</b></h4><pre>
       You can also specify key-bindings to trigger specific menuitems in windows. For  example,  the  following
       entry in <u><a href="file:~/.gntrc">~/.gntrc</a></u> will bind <b>Ctrl</b> <b>+</b> <b>t</b> to the 'Send IM...' item in the buddylist:

       [buddylist::menu]
       c-t = send-im

       The following is the list of IDs of the current menuitems in the buddylist:

       send-im
       join-chat
       show-empty-groups
       show-offline-buddies
       sort-status
       sort-alpha
       sort-log
       add-buddy
       add-chat
       add-group

</pre><h4><b>Mouse</b> <b>Support</b></h4><pre>
       There  is  experimental  mouse  support.  You can focus windows, activate buttons, select rows in a list,
       scroll using the wheel-scroll etc. Selecting text in a text-view copies it to the  gnt  clipboard.  Mouse
       support is disabled by default, so you need to enable it in <u><a href="file:~/.gntrc">~/.gntrc</a></u> (see the sample above).

</pre><h4><b>Window</b> <b>Management</b></h4><pre>
       The default window management is very limited. But it is possible to write custom window managers to suit
       your needs. There is a sample window-manager included (named <u>s.so</u>) which adds a little 'close-button' for
       the  windows, removes the borders from the buddylist and pops up new windows in the middle of the screen,
       instead of at the upper-left corder. It is provided as a sample simple manager, but it should be possible
       to write more complex managers, and it's very possible that  the  window-manager  API  will  need  to  be
       enhanced. Look at the sample <u><a href="file:~/.gntrc">~/.gntrc</a></u> file above to see how to select a window-manager.

       It is also possible to rebind the window-manager actions in <u><a href="file:~/.gntrc">~/.gntrc</a></u>, eg:

       [GntWM::binding]
       a-n = window-next
       a-p = window-prev
       a-c = window-close
       a-w = window-list
       a-d = dump-screen
       a-, = shift-left
       a-. = shift-right
       a-a = action-list
       a-m = start-move
       a-r = start-resize
       a-q = wm-quit
       a-l = refresh-screen
       a-s = workspace-list
       a-t = window-tag
       a-T = place-tagged
       a-C = toggle-clipboard
       a-/ = help-for-widget
       a-c-j = window-scroll-down
       a-c-k = window-scroll-up
       # The following action is still incomplete, and doesn't have a default binding
       # switch-window-n
       # Other actions: window-next-urgent, window-prev-urgent

       # For the sample custom window manager
       [GntS::binding]
       a-b = toggle-buddylist

       # For the irssi window manager
       [Irssi::binding]
       a-L = move-right
       a-H = move-left
       a-J = move-down
       a-K = move-up

</pre><h4><b>Conversation</b> <b>Commands</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  a  few  helpful  commands  in  addition  to  the regular commands. You can use these from any
       conversation to access other windows.

       <b>accounts</b>
              for the accounts window.

       <b>buddylist</b>
              for the buddylist.

       <b>debugwin</b>
              for the debug window.

       <b>plugins</b>
              for the plugins window.

       <b>prefs</b>  for the preferences window.

       <b>status</b> for the status window.
