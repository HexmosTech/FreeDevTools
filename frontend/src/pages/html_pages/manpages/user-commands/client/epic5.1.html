       epic5 — Internet Relay Chat client for UNIX like systems

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>epic5</b>  [<u>-a</u>]  [<u>-b</u>]  [<u>-B</u>]  [<u>-c</u>  <u>chan</u>]  [<u>-d</u>]  [<u>-f</u>]  [<u>-F</u>]  [<u>-h</u>]  [<u>-H</u>  <u>hostname</u>]  [<u>-l</u>  <u>filename</u>] [<u>-L</u> <u>filename</u>]
             [<u>-n</u>  <u>nickname</u>]  [<u>-o</u>]  [<u>-O</u>]  [<u>-p</u>  <u>port</u>]  [<u>-q</u>]  [<u>-s</u>]  [<u>-S</u>]  [<u>-v</u>]  [<u>-x</u>]   [<u>-z</u>   <u>username</u>]   [<u>nickname</u>]
             [<u>server</u> <u>description</u> <u>list</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>EPIC5</b> program is a unix-based character oriented user agent ('client') to Internet Relay Chat.  It is
       a  fully functional ircII client with many useful extensions.  This version works with modern irc2 server
       networks as of early 2006.  Support for non-irc2 networks (such as OPN or MS Comic Chat) is hit-and-miss.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>    Append the [<u>server</u> <u>description</u> <u>list</u>] to the end of the hardcoded default server list,  rather  than
             replacing it.

       <b>-b</b>    Operate  in  so  called  “bot  mode.”  This  also  turns  on  the  [<u>-d</u>] option.  <b>EPIC5</b> will <u><a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a></u>(2)
             immediately and the parent process will exit, returning you to your shell.  This  was  more  useful
             before GNU <b>screen</b> and <b>tmux,</b> when logging out killed your processes.  It's a better idea to just run
             your  bot  as  a  foreground  client  in  another  window.   Some  IRC networks limit the number of
             connections from an IP address to discourage bots.

       <b>-c</b> <u>chan</u>
             Join <u>chan</u> the first time you successfully connect to a server.

       <b>-d</b>    Operate in “dumb mode.” This is an alternate interface that is not full-screen.  Input is read from
             stdin, and output is written to stdout.  This interface is useful for screen readers and bots.

       <b>-h</b>    Display a moderately concise help message and exit immediately.

       <b>-H</b> <u>hostname</u>
             Use the IP address for <u>hostname</u> as your “local” IP  address.   This  is  for  people  with  vhosts.
             Please  note, the client doesn't tell the irc server what hostname to appear as, the server decides
             that.  Usually it is the official hostname of your IP address.  This option overrides  the  IRCHOST
             environment variable.

       <b>-l</b> <u>filename,[filename]</u>
             Use  the  specified filename(s) as the startup file.  The startup file is loaded the first time you
             successfully connect to a server, unless you specify the [<u>-B</u>] option.  This  overrides  the  EPICRC
             environment  variable.  If this option is not specified, and the EPICRC environment variable is not
             set, then <u><a href="file:~/.epicrc">~/.epicrc</a></u> is the default startup file.

       <b>-n</b> <u>nickname</u>
             Use the specified nickname as the default nickname whenever you connect to  an  irc  server.   This
             option  overrides  the  IRCNICK environment variable.  This option can be overridden if you specify
             nickname argument in the command line (see below).

       <b>-p</b> <u>port</u>
             Use the specified port as the default port for new server connections.  The default port is usually
             6667.  Make sure that the servers you want to connect to are listening on this port before you  try
             to connect there.

       <b>-q</b>    Suppress the loading of any file when you first establish a connection to an irc server.

       <b>-s</b>    Do  not connect to a server after reading the startup script.  Instead, present the server list and
             advise the user to connect to a server manually.

       <b>-S</b>    The <b>EPIC5</b> program is being run as a shell script.  You must make this look like  #/path/to/epic  -S
             other args.

       <b>-v</b>    Output version identification (VID) information and exit.

       <b>-x</b>    This  undocumented feature turns on all of the XDEBUG flags.  Refer to the help files for XDEBUG if
             you want to know what happens if you use this.

       <b>-z</b> <u>username</u>
             Use the specified username when negotiating a connection to a new irc server.  This  overrides  the
             IRCUSER  environment  variable.   If  this option is not specified, then the user name specified in
             <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u> for your user is  used.   This  feature  was  formerly  undocumented,  but  because  of
             <u><a href="../man8/identd.8.html">identd</a></u>(8)  this  option  isn't  as  useful  as  it once was.  If you are a sysadmin, please install
             identd, and then this flag will provide no value to your users.

       nickname
             The first bare word found is taken as the default  nickname  to  use.   This  overrides  all  other
             options, including the -n option and the IRCNICK environment variable.  If all else fails, then the
             client uses your login name as the default nickname.

       server,[server]
             After  the nickname, a list of one or more server specifications can be listed.  Unless you specify
             the -a option, this will replace your default server list!  The -a option forces any servers listed
             here to be appended to the default server list.  The format for server specifications is:

                   <b>hostname:port:password:nick</b>

             Any item can be omitted by leaving the field blank, and any trailing colons can also be omitted.

</pre><h4><b>DETAILED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>The</b> <b>Screen:</b>
       The screen is split into two parts, separated by an inverse-video status line (if supported).  The  upper
       (larger)  part of the screen displays responses from the <u><a href="../man8/ircd.8.html">ircd</a></u>(8) server.  The lower part of the screen (a
       single line) accepts keyboard input.

       Some terminals do not support certain features required by <b>epic5</b> , in which case you  receive  a  message
       stating this.  If this occurs, try changing the terminal type or run <b>epic5</b> with the -d option.

   <b>Irc</b> <b>Commands:</b>
       Any  line  beginning  with the slash character “/” is regarded as an <b>epic5</b> command (the command character
       may be changed).  Any line not beginning with this character is treated as a message to be  sent  to  the
       current  channel.   The  client  has  a  built  in  help  system.  Install the help files (they should be
       available at the same place you got the client) and then type “/help” to open up the help system.

   <b>The</b> <b>.epicrc</b> <b>File:</b>
       When <b>epic5</b> is executed, it checks the user's home directory for a <u><a href="file:~/.epicrc">~/.epicrc</a></u> file, executing the  commands
       in  the  file.   Commands  in  this  file  do  not need to have a leading slash character “/” This allows
       predefinition of aliases and other features.

</pre><h4><b>PRACTICAL</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Certainly any description of <b>epic5</b> in this man page  will  be  sorely  inadequate  because  most  of  the
       confusion  doesn't  even  start until after you get the client to connect to a server.  But if you really
       have problems getting the client to connect to a server, try some of these:

       <b>epic5</b>
             Try this first.  This will assume all the defaults.  If the person who is maintaining epic at  your
             site has done a halfway decent job, this will put you on a server that is somewhat local to you.

       <b>epic5</b> <b>nickname</b> <b>irc.domain.com</b>
             or something similar will attempt to connect to the irc server running on the host "irc.domain.com"
             (fill  in  a  real irc server here) with the nickname of well, "nickname".  This is the most common
             way to specify an alternate server to use.

       <b>epic5</b> <b>nickname</b> <b>irc.domain.com:6664</b>
             Sometimes, some servers are really busy, and it can take them a long time to establish a connection
             with you on the default port (6667).  Most major servers on big public networks accept  connections
             on many different ports, with the most common being most or all of the ports between 6660 and 6675.
             You  can  usually  connect  much  faster  if  you  use a port other than 6667, if the server you're
             connecting to supports an alternate port.

       <b>epic5</b> <b>nickname</b> <b>irc.efnet.net</b>
             If you're totally stumped and trying to get on efnet, try this.

       <b>epic5</b> <b>nickname</b> <b>irc.undernet.org</b>
             If you're totally stumped and trying to get on undernet, try this.

       <b>epic5</b> <b>nickname</b> <b>irc.dal.net</b>
             If you're totally stumped and trying to get on dalnet, try this.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/usr/local/bin/epic5</b>    the default location of the binary

       <b><a href="file:~/.epicrc">~/.epicrc</a></b>               default initialization file

       <b><a href="file:~/.epic/">~/.epic/</a></b>                directory you can put your own <b>epic5</b> scripts into, that can then be  loaded  with
                               /load

       <b>/usr/local/share/epic5</b>  default  directory  containing  message-of-the-day,  master  initialization, help
                               files and <b>epic5</b> scripts

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>HELP</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Starting up the client is the easy part.  Once you get connected, you'll probably find you have  no  idea
       what  you're  doing.   That's where the help files come in.  If the person who maintains irc at your site
       didn't install the help files, pester them until they do.  Once the help files  are  available,  use  the
       “/help” command to get started.  There are a bazillion commands and a multitude of nuances that will take
       a few months to get down pat.  But once you do, you will be so firmly addicted to irc that your wife will
       divorce  you, your kids will leave you, your dog will run away, and you'll flunk all your classes, and be
       left to sing the blues.

       <u>&lt;<a href="http://help.epicsol.org/">http://help.epicsol.org/</a>&gt;</u> The Online EPIC Help Pages

       <u>&lt;<a href="http://www.irchelp.org/">http://www.irchelp.org/</a>&gt;</u> Lots of great help for new irc users.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>epic5</b> handles the following signals gracefully

       SIGUSR1    Closes all DCC connections and EXEC'd processes.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       It can be helpful to predefine certain variables in in the <u><a href="file:~/.cshrc">~/.cshrc</a></u> , <u><a href="file:~/.profile">~/.profile</a></u> , or <u><a href="file:~/.login">~/.login</a></u> file:

       IRCNICK    The user's default IRC nickname

       IRCNAME    The user's default IRC realname (otherwise retrieved from <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u> )

       IRCSERVER  The user's default IRC server list (see server option for details)

       HOME       Overrides the default home page in <u>/etc/password</u>

       TERM       The type of terminal emulation to use

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Any non-trivial piece of software has bugs.  <b>EPIC5</b> is no exception.  You can refer to the <u>KNOWNBUGS</u>  file
       that is distributed with the client source code for a list of problems that are known to exist and may or
       may  not  be  fixed  some day.  If you find a bug that is not listed there, you can refer to the <u>BUG_FORM</u>
       file that is also distributed with the source code.  It will give you instructions on how to fill out the
       report and where to send it.

</pre><h4><b>ERRATA</b></h4><pre>
       The online documentation probably should be in docbook form rather than in the current help format.   The
       entire  help system is a hack.  This manual page only describes the options to epic, but doesn't tell you
       what to do once you get connected.
