</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
     transqt  −  transforms  one  and two electron integrals over
     symmetry orbitals into integrals over molecular orbitals.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
     The program <b>transqt</b>  reads  molecular  orbital  coefficients
     from FILE30 and uses them to transform the one and two elec‐
     tron  integrals  contained in FILE33 , FILE35 , FILE36 , and
     FILE37 to integrals over molecular orbitals.   No  integrals
     involving frozen occupied and unoccupied orbitals (as deter‐
     mined  from  user input) are transformed.  As a consequence,
     the program must be re‐run whenever  the  user‐input  frozen
     orbital arrays are changed.  The program uses a straightfor‐
     ward four single‐index transformation algorithm, modified to
     use   matrix  multiplications  for  each  quarter‐transform.
     Additionally, restricted transformations  have  been  imple‐
     mented when an MP2 or MP2‐R12/A energy is desired.  Further,
     the  program  is  capable of backtransforming the Lagrangian
     and one‐ and two‐particle density matrices  from  correlated
     calculations.   This  assumes  that the terms involving core
     orbitals are present, but  those  involving  frozen  virtual
     orbitals are not.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
     The following command‐line options are available:

     <u>‐quiet</u>
          This gives the same result as <b>PRINT=0</b>.

     <u>‐backtr</u>
          This runs a back‐transformation and has the same effect
          as <b>BACKTRANS=TRUE</b>.

     <u>‐mp2r12a</u> <u>type</u>
          This tells TRANSQT to transform non‐standard  two‐elec‐
          tron  integrals  required  in  MP2‐R12/A  calculations.
          Program CR12INTS must be run prior to  the  transforma‐
          tion.   <u>type</u>  should  take  values from 0 to 2, where 0
          refers to regular ERIs and one‐electron integrals, 1  ‐
          to  two‐electron integrals over the r12 operator, and 2
          to two‐electron integrals over the  [r12,T1]  operator.
          Thus,  to  obtain  a  complete set of integrals TRANSQT
          needs to be run three times.

     Additional input is read from the file input.dat.  The  fol‐
     lowing keywords are valid:

     <b>BACKTRANS</b> = <u>boolean</u>
          This  is  set  to TRUE for a back‐transformation of the
          Lagrangian and the one‐ and two‐particle density matri‐
          ces from the MO basis to the AO basis.  It  is  assumed
          that  these quantities are given in terms of the corre‐
          lated orbital order.  TRANSQT will rearrange them  into
          the  Pitzer  order  but with frozen virtuals at the top
          (this occurs during the pre‐sort for the two‐pdm).

     <b>CHECK_C_ORTHONORM</b> = <u>boolean</u>
          If TRUE, then check the orthonormality of the SCF coef‐
          ficient matrix.

     <b>MEMORY</b> = (<u>real</u> MB)
          Gives  the  amount  of  core  memory  to  be  used,  in
          megabytes.

     <b>WFN</b> = <u>string</u>
          This  is  the  type of wavefunction ultimately desired.
          If the value is set to  MP2,  then  only  a  restricted
          transformation  which  produces integrals necessary for
          the evaluation of the MP2 energy is performed.   Other‐
          wise,  a  full  transformation  is  carried  out.   The
          default is CCSD.

     <b>PRINT</b> = <u>integer</u>
          Determines the verbosity of the  printing  information.
          A  print  value of 0 gives minimal information, while 5
          gives debugging information (do NOT  use  print  levels
          above 3 for more than 20 basis functions).  The default
          is 0.

     <b>FROZEN_DOCC</b> = <u>integer_vector</u>
          Array  giving the number of doubly occupied orbitals to
          be frozen per irreducible representation, using  Cotton
          ordering.  The default is a zero array.

     <b>FROZEN_UOCC</b> = <u>integer_vector</u>
          Array  giving  the number of virtual molecular orbitals
          per irrep to be deleted from the transformed integrals.
          The default is a zero array.

     <b>DELETE_AO</b> = <u>boolean</u>
          If TRUE, then the AO integrals will  be  deleted  after
          the transformation.  The default is TRUE.

     <b>DELETE_TPDM</b> = <u>boolean</u>
          If  TRUE, then the MO‐basis two‐particle density matrix
          will  be  deleted  after  a  back‐transformation.   The
          default is TRUE.

     <b>FREEZE_CORE</b> = <u>boolean</u>
          If this is true then the transformed one‐ and two‐elec‐
          tron  integrals involving frozen core orbitals will not
          be obtained or written out.  The transformed  one‐elec‐
          tron  integrals  will  incorporate  the  effects of the
          frozen electrons (i.e. the one‐electron  operator  h(i)
          will  become  the  frozen core operator h’(i)), and the
          frozen core energy will be obtained (it is written  out
          as  the  first word of the one‐electron integral output
          file).  If <b>FREEZE_CORE</b> is false, then the  frozen  core
          orbitals  will  be  included in the transformation, and
          the frozen core energy will be set to zero.
     <b>MAX_BUCKETS</b> = <u>integer</u>
          Maximum number of buckets to use during  the  Yoshimine
          sort.  The default is 199.

     <b>MOORDER</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer_vector</u>
          This  specifies  a molecular orbital reordering vector.
          It will only be used if <b>REORDER</b>  <b>=</b>  <b>YES</b>.   This  vector
          contains  first  the  ordering  for the orbitals in the
          first irreducible representation and  then  the  second
          and  so on.  The first orbital of each irreducible rep‐
          resentation is numbered 1.  There is no default.   This
          reordering  affects  the  SCF coefficient matrix BEFORE
          the transformation; the post‐transform order  is  given
          by a different array.

     <b>REORDER</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
          The  molecular  orbitals  will  be reordered if this is
          true, in which case,  the  MOORDER  parameter  must  be
          present.  The default is false.  This has nothing to do
          with the reordering done AFTER the transformation (to a
          more convenient order for correlated procedures).

     <b>PRINT_MOS</b> = <u>boolean</u>
          If  TRUE, the SCF coefficient matrix is written to out‐
          put.  The default is FALSE.

     <b>PRINT_REORDER</b> = <u>boolean</u>
          If true prints  reordering  array  which  maps  Pitzer‐
          ordered  orbitals to correlated order.  This is not the
          same as  the  <u>MOORDER</u>  array,  which  has  to  do  with
          reordering BEFORE the transformation.

     <b>S_FILE</b> = <u>integer</u>
          If  USE_IWL=TRUE,  this  gives  the file number for the
          overlap integrals.  The default is 35.

     <b>T_FILE</b> = <u>integer</u>
          If USE_IWL=TRUE, this gives the  file  number  for  the
          kinetic energy integrals.  The default is 36.

     <b>V_FILE</b> = <u>integer</u>
          If  USE_IWL=TRUE,  this  gives  the file number for the
          nuclear attraction integrals. The default is 37.
     <b>AO_TEI_FILE</b> = <u>integer</u>
          This gives the file  number  for  the  SO  two‐electron
          integrals  to be read in for transforming.  The default
          is 33.

     <b>J_FILE</b> = <u>integer</u>
          This gives the file number for  the  intermediate  file
          containing the half‐transformed two‐electron integrals.
          The default value is 91.

     <b>KEEP_J</b> = <u>boolean</u>
          If  this  is  true  then the half‐transformed integrals
          will not be deleted when  the  transformation  is  com‐
          plete.  The default is FALSE.

     <b>M_FILE</b> = <u>integer</u>
          This  gives  the  file number for the intermediate file
          containing the  fully  transformed  two‐electron  inte‐
          grals.  The default value is 72.

     <b>FIRST_TMP_FILE</b> = <u>integer</u>
          Gives the number of the first temp file to be used dur‐
          ing the Yoshimine sorts.  Default is 100.

     <b>LAG_IN_FILE</b> = <u>integer</u>
          This  is the unit number for the MO Lagrangian which is
          to  be  read  in  during  backtransformations.   It  is
          expected  that  the  Lagrangian  is  stored  on disk in
          binary  format  in  a  matrix  of  dimensions  (nmo   ‐
          nfzv)*(nmo‐nfzv).   The  Lagrangian  is symmetrized and
          then backtransformed and written after the AO  one‐par‐
          ticle density matrix in OPDM_OUT_FILE.

     <b>OPDM_IN_FILE</b> = <u>integer</u>
          This is the unit number for the MO one‐particle density
          matrix  to  be read in during backtransformations.  The
          one‐pdm is in binary format and has dimensions  nmo  by
          nmo.

     <b>OPDM_OUT_FILE</b> = <u>integer</u>
          This  is  the  unit number to which the AO one‐particle
          density matrix will be written  out.   Only  the  lower
          triangle is written.  The AO Lagrangian will be written
          just after the AO one‐pdm, again in lower‐triangle for‐
          mat.
     <b>PRESORT_FILE</b> = <u>integer</u>
          This  gives  the  file number for the intermediate file
          containing the presorted  SO‐basis  two‐electron  inte‐
          grals.  The default is 41.

     <b>KEEP_PRESORT</b> = <u>boolean</u>
          If  this  is true then the presorted SO‐basis two‐elec‐
          tron integrals will not be deleted when the transforma‐
          tion is complete.  The default is FALSE.

     <b>SORTED_OEI_FILE</b> = <u>integer</u>
          This gives the file number for the  final,  sorted  one
          electron integrals.  The default is 71.

     <b>SORTED_TEI_FILE</b> = <u>integer</u>
          This  gives  the  file number for the final, sorted two
          electron integrals.  The default is 72.

     <b>TPDM_ADD_REF</b> = <u>boolean</u>
          If TRUE, then the program will  automatically  add  the
          contributions  of  the  single determinant reference to
          the two‐particle density matrix.  The default  is  TRUE
          for <u>wfn</u> = QVCCD and FALSE otherwise.

     <b>TPDM_FILE</b> = <u>integer</u>
          This gives the file number for the two‐particle density
          matrix   which  is  to  be  back‐transformed  if  BACK‐
          TRANS=TRUE.  The default is 77.

     <b>TOLERANCE</b> = <u>integer</u>
          This gives the exponent of the  cutoff  value  for  the
          elimination  of two‐electron integrals from the list of
          those written to disk.  The default  is  14,  giving  a
          cutoff of 1e‐14.

     <b>PRINT_TE_INTEGRALS</b> = <u>boolean</u>
          If this is true then the fully‐transformed two‐electron
          integrals  will be written to output.dat The default is
          FALSE, and this should <u>not</u> be set to TRUE for  any  but
          the smallest basis sets (e.g. fewer than 10 functions).

     <b>PRINT_OE_INTEGRALS</b> = <u>boolean</u>
          If this is true then the fully‐transformed one‐electron
          integrals  will be written to output.dat The default is
          FALSE, and this should not be set to true for  any  but
          very small basis sets (e.g. fewer than 20 functions).
