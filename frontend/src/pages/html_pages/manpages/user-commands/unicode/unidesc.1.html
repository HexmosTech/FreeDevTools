       unidesc - Describe the contents of a Unicode text file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>unidesc</b> <b>([option</b> <b>flags])</b> <b>(&lt;file</b> <b>name&gt;)</b>

       If no input file name is supplied, <u>unidesc</u> reads from the standard input.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>unidesc</u> describes the content of a Unicode text file by reporting the character ranges to which different
       portions  of  the  text  belong.   The  ranges  reported  include  both  official  Unicode ranges and the
       constructed language ranges within the Private Use Areas registered with the Conscript  Unicode  Registry
       (<a href="http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/">http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/</a>).  For each range of characters, <u>unidesc</u> prints the character or
       byte  offset of the beginning of the range, the character or byte offset of the end of the range, and the
       name of the range. Offsets start from 0.

       Since the ASCII digits, punctuation, and whitespace characters  are  frequently  used  by  other  writing
       systems, by default these characters are treated as neutral, that is, as not belonging exclusively to any
       particular  character  range.   These  characters  are  treated  as  belonging  to  the range of whatever
       characters precede them.

       If the input begins with neutral characters, they are treated as  belonging  to  the  range  of  whatever
       characters  follow  them. If the file consists entirely of neutral characters, the range is identified as
       <u>Neutral</u> followed by <u>Basic</u> <u>Latin</u> in square brackets.

       A magic number identifying the Unicode encoding is not part of the  Unicode  standard,  so  pure  Unicode
       files do not contain a magic number.  However, informal conventions have arisen for this purpose.  If the
       command  line  flag  <u>-m</u>  is  given, <u>unidesc</u> will attempt to identify the Unicode subtype by examining the
       first few bytes of the input. If the input is identified as one of the two  acceptable  types,  UTF-8  or
       native  order  UTF-32,  it  will  then  proceed to describe the contents of the input. Otherwise, it will
       report what it has learned and exit. Note that if the file does contain a magic number, you must use  the
       <u>-m</u>  flag.  Without  this  flag <u>unidesc</u> assumes that the input consists of pure Unicode with the character
       data beginning immediately.  It will therefore be thrown off by the magic number.

       By default, input is expected to be UTF-8. Native  order  UTF-32  is  also  acceptable.   UTF-32  may  be
       specified via the command line flag <u>-u</u> or, if the command line flag <u>-m</u> is given, via the magic number.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       -b     Give file offsets in bytes rather than characters.

       -d     Treat the ASCII digits as belonging exclusively to the Basic Latin range.

       -h     Print usage information.

       -L     List the Unicode ranges alphabetically.

       -l     List the Unicode ranges by codepoint.

       -m     Check the file's magic number to determine the Unicode subtype.

       -p     Treat ASCII punctuation as belonging exclusively to the Basic Latin range.

       -r     Instead  of  listing ranges as they are encountered, just list the ranges detected after all input
              has been read.

       -u     Input is native order UTF-32.

       -v     Print version information.

       -w     Treat ASCII whitespace as belonging exclusively to the Basic Latin range.
