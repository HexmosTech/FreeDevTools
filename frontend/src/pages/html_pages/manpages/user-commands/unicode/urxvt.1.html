</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rxvt-unicode - (ouR XVT, unicode), a VT102 emulator for the X window system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>urxvt</b> [options] [-e command [ args ]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rxvt-unicode</b>, version <b>9.31</b>, is a colour vt102 terminal emulator intended as an <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) replacement for
       users who do not require features such as Tektronix 4014 emulation and toolkit-style configurability. As
       a result, <b>rxvt-unicode</b> uses much less swap space -- a significant advantage on a machine serving many X
       sessions.

       common problems. That document is also accessible on the World-Wide-Web at

</pre><h4><b>RXVT-UNICODE</b> <b>VS.</b> <b>RXVT</b></h4><pre>
       Unlike the original rxvt, <b>rxvt-unicode</b> stores all text in Unicode internally. That means it can store and
       display most scripts in the world. Being a terminal emulator, however, some things are very difficult,
       especially cursive scripts such as arabic, vertically written scripts like mongolian or scripts requiring
       extremely complex combining rules, like tibetan or devanagari. Don't expect pretty output when using
       these scripts. Most other scripts, latin, cyrillic, kanji, thai etc. should work fine, though. A somewhat
       difficult case are right-to-left scripts, such as hebrew: <b>rxvt-unicode</b> adopts the view that bidirectional
       algorithms belong in the application, not the terminal emulator (too many things -- such as cursor-
       movement while editing -- break otherwise), but that might change.

       If you are looking for a terminal that supports more exotic scripts, let me recommend "mlterm", which is
       a very user friendly, lean and clean terminal emulator. In fact, the reason rxvt-unicode was born was
       solely because the author couldn't get "mlterm" to use one font for latin1 and another for japanese.

       Therefore another design rationale was the use of multiple fonts to display characters: The idea of a
       single unicode font which many other programs force onto its users never made sense to me: You should be
       able to choose any font for any script freely.

       Apart from that, rxvt-unicode is also much better internationalised than its predecessor, supports things
       such as XFT and ISO 14755 that are handy in i18n-environments, is faster, and has a lot bugs less than
       the original rxvt. This all in addition to dozens of other small improvements.

       It is still faithfully following the original rxvt idea of being lean and nice on resources: for example,
       you can still configure rxvt-unicode without most of its features to get a lean binary. It also comes
       with a client/daemon pair that lets you open any number of terminal windows from within a single process,
       which makes startup time very fast and drastically reduces memory usage. See <a href="../man1/urxvtd.1.html">urxvtd</a>(1) (daemon) and
       <a href="../man1/urxvtc.1.html">urxvtc</a>(1) (client).

       It also makes technical information about escape sequences (which have been extended) more accessible:
       see <a href="../man7/urxvt.7.html">urxvt</a>(7) for technical reference documentation (escape sequences etc.).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>urxvt</b> options (mostly a subset of <u>xterm</u>'s) are listed below. In keeping with the smaller-is-better
       philosophy, options may be eliminated or default values chosen at compile-time, so options and defaults
       listed may not accurately reflect the version installed on your system. `urxvt -h' gives a list of major
       compile-time options on the <u>Options</u> line. Option descriptions may be prefixed with which compile option
       each is dependent upon. e.g. `Compile <u>XIM</u>:' requires <u>XIM</u> on the <u>Options</u> line. Note: `urxvt -help' gives a
       list of all command-line options compiled into your version.

       Note that <b>urxvt</b> permits the resource name to be used as a long-option (--/++ option) so the potential
       command-line options are far greater than those listed. For example: `urxvt --loginShell --color1
       Orange'.

       The following options are available:

       <b>-help</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print out a message describing available options.

       <b>-display</b> <u>displayname</u>
           Attempt  to  open  a  window  on  the  named  X  display  (the  older form <b>-d</b> is still respected. but
           deprecated). In the absence of this option, the display specified by the <b>DISPLAY</b> environment variable
           is used.

       <b>-depth</b> <u>bitdepth</u>
           Compile <u>frills</u>: Attempt to find a visual with the given bit depth; resource <b>depth</b>.

           [Please note that many X servers (and libXft) are buggy with respect  to  "-depth  32"  and/or  alpha
           channels,  and  will  cause  all  sorts  of  graphical  corruption. This is harmless, but we can't do
           anything about this, so watch out]

       <b>-visual</b> <u>visualID</u>
           Compile <u>frills</u>: Use the given visual (see e.g. "xdpyinfo" for possible visual  ids)  instead  of  the
           default, and also allocate a private colormap. All visual types except for DirectColor are supported.

       <b>-geometry</b> <u>geom</u>
           Window geometry (<b>-g</b> still respected); resource <b>geometry</b>.

       <b>-rv</b>|<b>+rv</b>
           Turn on/off simulated reverse video; resource <b>reverseVideo</b>.

       <b>-j</b>|<b>+j</b>
           Turn on/off jump scrolling (allow multiple lines per refresh); resource <b>jumpScroll</b>.

       <b>-ss</b>|<b>+ss</b>
           Turn on/off skip scrolling (allow multiple screens per refresh); resource <b>skipScroll</b>.

       <b>-fps</b> <u>number</u>
           Compile  <u>frills</u>:  Set  the  refresh  interval  (in  frames  per second or negative seconds); resource
           <b>refreshRate</b>.

       <b>-fade</b> <u>number</u>
           Fade the text by the given percentage when focus is lost.  Small  values  fade  a  little  only,  100
           completely replaces all colours by the fade colour; resource <b>fading</b>.

       <b>-fadecolor</b> <u>colour</u>
           Fade  to  this  colour  when fading is used (see <b>-fade</b>). The default colour is opaque black. resource
           <b>fadeColor</b>.

       <b>-icon</b> <u>file</u>
           Compile <u>pixbuf</u>: Use the specified image as application icon. This is used by  many  window  managers,
           taskbars and pagers to represent the application window; resource <u>iconFile</u>.

       <b>-bg</b> <u>colour</u>
           Window background colour; resource <b>background</b>.

       <b>-fg</b> <u>colour</u>
           Window foreground colour; resource <b>foreground</b>.

       <b>-cr</b> <u>colour</u>
           The cursor colour; resource <b>cursorColor</b>.

       <b>-pr</b> <u>colour</u>
           The mouse pointer foreground colour; resource <b>pointerColor</b>.

       <b>-pr2</b> <u>colour</u>
           The mouse pointer background colour; resource <b>pointerColor2</b>.

       <b>-bd</b> <u>colour</u>
           The  colour  of  the  border  around  the  text area and between the scrollbar and the text; resource
           <b>borderColor</b>.

       <b>-fn</b> <u>fontlist</u>
           Select the fonts to be used. This is a comma separated list of font names that are checked  in  order
           when trying to find glyphs for characters. The first font defines the cell size for characters; other
           fonts  might  be  smaller, but not (in general) larger. A (hopefully) reasonable default font list is
           always appended to it. See resource <b>font</b> for more details.

           In short, to specify an X11 core font, just specify its name or prefix it with "x:".  To  specify  an
           XFT-font, you need to prefix it with "xft:", e.g.:

              urxvt -fn "xft:Bitstream Vera Sans Mono:pixelsize=15"
              urxvt -fn "9x15bold,xft:Bitstream Vera Sans Mono"

           See also the question "How does rxvt-unicode choose fonts?" in the FAQ section of <a href="../man7/urxvt.7.html">urxvt</a>(7).

       <b>-fb</b> <u>fontlist</u>
           Compile  <u>font-styles</u>:  The bold font list to use when <b>bold</b> characters are to be printed. See resource
           <b>boldFont</b> for details.

       <b>-fi</b> <u>fontlist</u>
           Compile <u>font-styles</u>: The italic font list to use when  <u>italic</u>  characters  are  to  be  printed.  See
           resource <b>italicFont</b> for details.

       <b>-fbi</b> <u>fontlist</u>
           Compile  <u>font-styles</u>: The bold italic font list to use when <u><b>bold</b></u> <u><b>italic</b></u> characters are to be printed.
           See resource <b>boldItalicFont</b> for details.

       <b>-is</b>|<b>+is</b>
           Compile <u>font-styles</u>: Bold/Blink font styles imply high intensity foreground/background (default). See
           resource <b>intensityStyles</b> for details.

       <b>-name</b> <u>name</u>
           Specify the application name under which resources are  to  be  obtained,  rather  than  the  default
           executable  file  name.  Name  should not contain `.' or `*' characters. Also sets the icon and title
           name.

       <b>-ls</b>|<b>+ls</b>
           Start as a login-shell/sub-shell; resource <b>loginShell</b>.

       <b>-mc</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
           Specify the maximum time between multi-click selections.

       <b>-ut</b>|<b>+ut</b>
           Compile <u>utmp</u>: Inhibit/enable writing a utmp entry; resource <b>utmpInhibit</b>.

       <b>-vb</b>|<b>+vb</b>
           Turn on/off visual bell on receipt of a bell character; resource <b>visualBell</b>.

       <b>-sb</b>|<b>+sb</b>
           Turn on/off scrollbar; resource <b>scrollBar</b>.

       <b>-sr</b>|<b>+sr</b>
           Put scrollbar on right/left; resource <b>scrollBar_right</b>.

       <b>-st</b>|<b>+st</b>
           Display rxvt (non XTerm/NeXT) scrollbar without/with a trough; resource <b>scrollBar_floating</b>.

       <b>-si</b>|<b>+si</b>
           Turn on/off scroll-to-bottom on TTY output inhibit; resource <b>scrollTtyOutput</b> has opposite effect.

       <b>-sk</b>|<b>+sk</b>
           Turn on/off scroll-to-bottom on keypress; resource <b>scrollTtyKeypress</b>.

       <b>-sw</b>|<b>+sw</b>
           Turn on/off scrolling with the scrollback buffer as new lines appear.  This only takes effect if  <b>-si</b>
           is also given; resource <b>scrollWithBuffer</b>.

       <b>-ptab</b>|<b>+ptab</b>
           If  enabled  (default), "Horizontal Tab" characters are being stored as actual wide characters in the
           screen buffer, which makes it possible to select and paste them. Since a horizontal tab is  a  cursor
           movement  and  not  an  actual  glyph, this can sometimes be visually annoying as the cursor on a tab
           character is displayed as a wide cursor; resource <b>pastableTabs</b>.

       <b>-bc</b>|<b>+bc</b>
           Blink the cursor; resource <b>cursorBlink</b>.

       <b>-uc</b>|<b>+uc</b>
           Make the cursor underlined; resource <b>cursorUnderline</b>.

       <b>-iconic</b>
           Start iconified, if the window manager supports that option.  Alternative form is <b>-ic</b>.

       <b>-sl</b> <u>number</u>
           Save <u>number</u> lines in the scrollback buffer. See resource entry for limits; resource <b>saveLines</b>.

       <b>-b</b> <u>number</u>
           Compile  <u>frills</u>:  Internal  border  of  <u>number</u>  pixels.  See  resource  entry  for  limits;  resource
           <b>internalBorder</b>.

       <b>-w</b> <u>number</u>
           Compile  <u>frills</u>: External border of <u>number</u> pixels. Also, <b>-bw</b> and <b>-borderwidth</b>. See resource entry for
           limits; resource <b>externalBorder</b>.

       <b>-bl</b> Compile <u>frills</u>: Set MWM hints to request a borderless window, i.e.  if honoured by the WM, the  rxvt-
           unicode  window will not have window decorations; resource <b>borderLess</b>. If the window manager does not
           support MWM hints (e.g. kwin), enables override-redirect mode.

       <b>-override-redirect</b>
           Compile <u>frills</u>: Sets override-redirect on the window; resource <b>override-redirect</b>.

       <b>-dockapp</b>
           Sets the initial state of the window to WithdrawnState, which makes window managers that support this
           extension treat it as a dockapp.

       <b>-sbg</b>
           Compile <u>frills</u>: Disable the usage of the built-in block graphics/line  drawing  characters  and  just
           rely  on what the specified fonts provide. Use this if you have a good font and want to use its block
           graphic glyphs; resource <b>skipBuiltinGlyphs</b>.

       <b>-lsp</b> <u>number</u>
           Compile <u>frills</u>: Lines (pixel height) to insert between each row of the display. Useful to work around
           font rendering problems; resource <b>lineSpace</b>.

       <b>-letsp</b> <u>number</u>
           Compile <u>frills</u>: Amount to adjust the computed character width by to control overall  letter  spacing.
           Negative  values  will  tighten  up  the letter spacing, positive values will space letters out more.
           Useful to work around odd font metrics; resource <b>letterSpace</b>.

       <b>-tn</b> <u>termname</u>
           This option specifies the name of the terminal type to be set in the <b>TERM</b> environment variable.  This
           terminal  type  must  exist  in the <u><b><a href="../man5/termcap.5.html">termcap</a></b>(5)</u> database and should have <u>li#</u> and <u>co#</u> entries; resource
           <b>termName</b>.

       <b>-e</b> <u>command</u> <u>[arguments]</u>
           Run the command with its command-line arguments in the <b>urxvt</b> window; also sets the window  title  and
           icon name to be the basename of the program being executed if neither <u>-title</u> (<u>-T</u>) nor <u>-n</u> are given on
           the  command line. If this option is used, it must be the last on the command-line. If there is no <b>-e</b>
           option then the default is to run the program specified by the <b>SHELL</b> environment variable or, failing
           that, <u><b><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></b>(1)</u>.

           Please note that you must specify a program with arguments. If you want to run  shell  commands,  you
           have to specify the shell, like this:

             urxvt -e sh -c "shell commands"

       <b>-title</b> <u>text</u>
           Window  title  (<b>-T</b> still respected); the default title is the basename of the program specified after
           the <b>-e</b> option, if any, otherwise the application name; resource <b>title</b>.

       <b>-n</b> <u>text</u>
           Icon name; the default name is the basename of the program specified after the  <b>-e</b>  option,  if  any,
           otherwise the application name; resource <b>iconName</b>.

       <b>-C</b>  Capture system console messages.

       <b>-pt</b> <u>style</u>
           Compile <u>XIM</u>: input style for input method; <b>OverTheSpot</b>, <b>OffTheSpot</b>, <b>Root</b>; resource <b>preeditType</b>.

           If  the  perl  extension  "xim-onthespot"  is  used  (which  is  the  default), then additionally the
           "OnTheSpot" preedit type is available.

       <b>-im</b> <u>text</u>
           Compile <u>XIM</u>: input method name. resource <b>inputMethod</b>.

       <b>-imlocale</b> <u>string</u>
           The locale to use for opening the IM. You can use an "LC_CTYPE" of  e.g.   "de_DE.UTF-8"  for  normal
           text  processing  but  "ja_JP.EUC-JP" for the input extension to be able to input japanese characters
           while staying in another locale. resource <b>imLocale</b>.

       <b>-imfont</b> <u>fontset</u>
           Set the font set to use for the X Input Method, see resource <b>imFont</b> for more info.

       <b>-tcw</b>
           Change the meaning of triple-click selection with the left mouse  button.  Only  effective  when  the
           original  (non-perl)  selection  code  is in-use. Instead of selecting a full line it will extend the
           selection to the end of the logical line only. resource <b>tripleclickwords</b>.

       <b>-dpb</b>|<b>+dpb</b>
           Compile frills: Disable (or enable)  emitting  bracketed  paste  mode  sequences  (default  enabled).
           Bracketed paste mode allows programs to detect when something is pasted. Since more and more programs
           abuse  this,  these  sequences  can be disabled. The command sequences to enable and query paste mode
           will still work, but the actual bracket sequences will no longer be emitted. You can also toggle this
           from the ctrl-middle-mouse-button menu; resource <b>disablePasteBrackets</b>.

       <b>-insecure</b>
           Enable "insecure" mode, which currently enables most of the escape sequences that echo  strings.  See
           the resource <b>insecure</b> for more info.

       <b>-mod</b> <u>modifier</u>
           Override  detection  of  Meta modifier with specified key: <b>alt</b>, <b>meta</b>, <b>hyper</b>, <b>super</b>, <b>mod1</b>, <b>mod2</b>, <b>mod3</b>,
           <b>mod4</b>, <b>mod5</b>; resource <u>modifier</u>.

       <b>-ssc</b>|<b>+ssc</b>
           Turn on/off secondary screen (default enabled); resource <b>secondaryScreen</b>.

       <b>-ssr</b>|<b>+ssr</b>
           Turn on/off secondary screen scroll (default enabled); resource <b>secondaryScroll</b>.

       <b>-rm</b> <u>mode</u>
           Compile <u>frills</u>: Sets long line rewrapping behaviour on window resizes to one of <b>auto</b>  (the  default),
           <b>always</b>  or  <b>never</b>. The latter two modes do the obvious, <b>auto</b> rewraps (acts like <b>always</b>) if scrollback
           is non-empty, and wings lines (acts like <b>never</b>) otherwise; resource <b>rewrapMode</b>.

       <b>-hold</b>|<b>+hold</b>
           Turn on/off hold window after exit support. If enabled, urxvt will not immediately destroy its window
           when the program executed within it exits. Instead, it will wait till it is being killed or closed by
           the user; resource <b>hold</b>.

       <b>-cd</b> <u>path</u>
           Sets the working directory for the shell (or the command specified via  <b>-e</b>).  The  <u>path</u>  must  be  an
           absolute path and it must exist for urxvt to start; resource <b>chdir</b>.

       <b>-xrm</b> <u>string</u>
           Works  like  the X Toolkit option of the same name, by adding the <u>string</u> as if it were specified in a
           resource  file.  Resource  values  specified  this  way  take  precedence  over  all  other  resource
           specifications.

           Note that you need to use the <u>same</u> syntax as in the .Xdefaults file, e.g. "*.background: black". Also
           note  that  all urxvt-specific options can be specified as long-options on the commandline, so use of
           <b>-xrm</b> is mostly limited to cases where you want to specify other resources (e.g. for input methods) or
           for compatibility with other programs.

       <b>-keysym.</b><u>sym</u> <u>string</u>
           Remap a key symbol. See resource <b>keysym</b>.

       <b>-embed</b> <u>windowid</u>
           Tells urxvt to embed its windows into an  already-existing  window,  which  enables  applications  to
           easily embed a terminal.

           Right  now,  urxvt  will first unmap/map the specified window, so it shouldn't be a top-level window.
           urxvt will also reconfigure it quite a bit, so don't expect it to keep some specific state. It's best
           to create an extra subwindow for urxvt and leave it alone.

           The window will not be destroyed when urxvt exits.

           It might be useful to know that urxvt will not close  file  descriptors  passed  to  it  (except  for
           stdin/out/err,  of  course),  so you can use file descriptors to communicate with the programs within
           the terminal. This works regardless of whether the "-embed" option was used or not.

           Here is a short Gtk2-perl snippet that illustrates how this option can be used (a longer  example  is
           in <u>doc/embed</u>):

              my $rxvt = new Gtk2::Socket;
              $rxvt-&gt;signal_connect_after (realize =&gt; sub {
                 my $xid = $_[0]-&gt;window-&gt;get_xid;
                 system "urxvt -embed $xid &amp;";
              });

       <b>-pty-fd</b> <u>file</u> <u>descriptor</u>
           Tells  urxvt  NOT to execute any commands or create a new pty/tty pair but instead use the given file
           descriptor as the tty master. This is useful if you  want  to  drive  urxvt  as  a  generic  terminal
           emulator without having to run a program within it.

           If this switch is given, urxvt will not create any utmp/wtmp entries and will not tinker with pty/tty
           permissions - you have to do that yourself if you want that.

           As  an  extremely  special  case, specifying -1 will completely suppress pty/tty operations, which is
           probably only useful in conjunction with some perl extension that manages the terminal.

           Here is a example in perl that illustrates how this option can  be  used  (a  longer  example  is  in
           <u>doc/pty-fd</u>):

              use IO::Pty;
              use Fcntl;

              my $pty = new IO::Pty;
              fcntl $pty, F_SETFD, 0; # clear close-on-exec
              system "urxvt -pty-fd " . (fileno $pty) . "&amp;";
              close $pty;

              # now communicate with rxvt
              my $slave = $pty-&gt;slave;
              while (&lt;$slave&gt;) { print $slave "got &lt;$_&gt;\n" }

           Note  that,  despite what the name might imply, the file descriptor does not need to be a pty, it can
           be a bi-directional pipe as well (e.g. a unix domain or tcp socket). While tty operations  cannot  be
           done in this case, <b>urxvt</b> can still be remote controlled with it:

              use Socket;
              use Fcntl;

              socketpair my $URXVT, my $slave, Socket::AF_UNIX, Socket::SOCK_STREAM, Socket::PF_UNSPEC;
              fcntl $slave, Fcntl::F_SETFD, 0;
              system "exec urxvt -pty-fd " . (fileno $slave) . " &amp;";
              close $slave;

              syswrite $URXVT, "Type a secret password: ";
              my $secret = do { local $/ = "\r"; &lt;$URXVT&gt; };
              print "Not so secret anymore: $secret\n";

       <b>-pe</b> <u>string</u>
           Comma-separated  list of perl extension scripts to use (or not to use) in this terminal instance. See
           resource <b>perl-ext</b> for details.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       Note: `urxvt --help' gives a list of all  resources  (long  options)  compiled  into  your  version.  All
       resources are also available as long-options.

       You  can  set and change the resources using X11 tools like <b>xrdb</b>. Many distribution do also load settings
       from the <b><a href="file:~/.Xresources">~/.Xresources</a></b> file when X starts. urxvt will consult the  following  files/resources  in  order,
       with later settings overwriting earlier ones:

         1. app-defaults file in $XAPPLRESDIR
         2. $HOME/.Xdefaults
         3. RESOURCE_MANAGER property on root-window of screen 0
         4. SCREEN_RESOURCES property on root-window of the current screen
         5. $XENVIRONMENT file OR $HOME/.Xdefaults-&lt;nodename&gt;
         6. resources specified via -xrm on the commandline

       Note that when reading X resources, <b>urxvt</b> recognizes two class names: <b>Rxvt</b> and <b>URxvt</b>. The class name <b>Rxvt</b>
       allows resources common to both <b>urxvt</b> and the original <u>rxvt</u> to be easily configured, while the class name
       <b>URxvt</b>  allows  resources  unique  to  <b>urxvt</b>,  to  be shared between different <b>urxvt</b> configurations. If no
       resources are specified, suitable defaults will be used. Command-line arguments can be used  to  override
       resource  settings.  The  following  resources  are  supported  (you might want to check the urxvt<b><a href="../man3/perl.3.html">perl</a></b>(3)
       manpage for additional settings by perl extensions not documented here):

       <b>depth:</b> <u>bitdepth</u>
           Compile <u>xft</u>: Attempt to find a visual with the given bit depth; option <b>-depth</b>.

       <b>buffered:</b> <u>boolean</u>
           Compile <u>xft</u>: Turn on/off double-buffering for xft (default enabled).  On some card/driver combination
           enabling it slightly decreases performance, on most it greatly helps it. The slowdown is small, so it
           should normally be enabled.

       <b>geometry:</b> <u>geom</u>
           Create the window with the specified X window geometry [default 80x24]; option <b>-geometry</b>.

       <b>background:</b> <u>colour</u>
           Use the specified colour as the window's background colour [default White]; option <b>-bg</b>.

       <b>foreground:</b> <u>colour</u>
           Use the specified colour as the window's foreground colour [default Black]; option <b>-fg</b>.

       <b>color</b><u>n</u><b>:</b> <u>colour</u>
           Use the specified colour for the colour value <u>n</u>, where  0-7  corresponds  to  low-intensity  (normal)
           colours  and 8-15 corresponds to high-intensity (bold = bright foreground, blink = bright background)
           colours. The canonical names are as follows: 0=black, 1=red, 2=green,  3=yellow,  4=blue,  5=magenta,
           6=cyan, 7=white, but the actual colour names used are listed in the <b>COLOURS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>GRAPHICS</b> section.

           Colours  higher  than  15  cannot  be  set  using resources (yet), but can be changed using an escape
           command (see <a href="../man7/urxvt.7.html">urxvt</a>(7)).

           Colours 16-79 form a standard 4x4x4 colour cube (the same as xterm with 88 colour  support).  Colours
           80-87 are evenly spaces grey steps.

       <b>colorBD:</b> <u>colour</u>
       <b>colorIT:</b> <u>colour</u>
           Use  the  specified  colour  to  display  bold or italic characters when the foreground colour is the
           default. If font styles are not available (Compile <u>styles</u>) and this option is unset, reverse video is
           used instead.

       <b>colorUL:</b> <u>colour</u>
           Use the specified colour to display underlined characters when the foreground colour is the default.

       <b>underlineColor:</b> <u>colour</u>
           If set, use the specified colour as the colour for the underline itself. If unset, use the foreground
           colour.

       <b>highlightColor:</b> <u>colour</u>
           If set, use the specified colour as the background for highlighted characters. If unset, use  reverse
           video.

       <b>highlightTextColor:</b> <u>colour</u>
           If  set  and  highlightColor  is  set,  use  the  specified  colour as the foreground for highlighted
           characters.

       <b>cursorColor:</b> <u>colour</u>
           Use the specified colour for the cursor. The default is to use the foreground colour; option <b>-cr</b>.

       <b>cursorColor2:</b> <u>colour</u>
           Use the specified colour for the colour of the cursor text. For this to take effect, <b>cursorColor</b> must
           also be specified. The default is to use the background colour.

       <b>reverseVideo:</b> <u>boolean</u>
           <b>True</b>: simulate reverse video by foreground and background colours; option <b>-rv</b>. <b>False</b>: regular  screen
           colours [default]; option <b>+rv</b>. See note in <b>COLOURS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>GRAPHICS</b> section.

       <b>jumpScroll:</b> <u>boolean</u>
           <b>True</b>:  specify  that  jump  scrolling  should  be used. When receiving lots of lines, urxvt will only
           scroll once a whole screen height of lines has been read, resulting  in  fewer  updates  while  still
           displaying every received line; option <b>-j</b>.

           <b>False</b>:  specify  that  smooth scrolling should be used. urxvt will force a screen refresh on each new
           line it received; option <b>+j</b>.

       <b>skipScroll:</b> <u>boolean</u>
           <b>True</b>: (the default) specify that skip scrolling should be used. When receiving lots of  lines,  urxvt
           will  only  scroll once in a while (around 60 times per second), resulting in far fewer updates. This
           can result in urxvt not ever displaying some of the lines it receives; option <b>-ss</b>.

           <b>False</b>: specify that everything is to be displayed, even if the refresh is too fast for the human  eye
           to read anything (or the monitor to display anything); option <b>+ss</b>.

       <b>refreshRate:</b> <u>number</u>
           Compile  <u>frills</u>:  When positive, sets the maximum refreshes per second (the default is 60). When zero
           or negative, sets the minimum interval between refreshes, negated. That is,  positive  numbers  limit
           the  number  of  refreshes  per  second to that number, similar to a fps limiter in games. A negative
           number gets negated and directly sets the minimum interval between refreshes, that is,  10  and  -0.1
           both  specify  the same refresh interval (likewise 50 and 0.02). Finally, zero makes urxvt refresh as
           fast as possible. Fractional values are supported; option <b>-fps</b>.

       <b>fading:</b> <u>number</u>
           Fade the text by the given percentage when focus is lost; option <b>-fade</b>.

       <b>fadeColor:</b> <u>colour</u>
           Fade to this colour, when fading  is  used  (see  <b>fading:</b>).  The  default  colour  is  black;  option
           <b>-fadecolor</b>.

       <b>iconFile:</b> <u>file</u>
           Set the application icon pixmap; option <b>-icon</b>.

       <b>scrollColor:</b> <u>colour</u>
           Use the specified colour for the scrollbar [default #B2B2B2].

       <b>troughColor:</b> <u>colour</u>
           Use  the  specified  colour for the scrollbar's trough area [default #969696]. Only relevant for rxvt
           (non XTerm/NeXT) scrollbar.

       <b>borderColor:</b> <u>colour</u>
           The colour of the border around the text area and between the scrollbar and the text.

       <b>font:</b> <u>fontlist</u>
           Select the fonts to be used. This is a comma separated list of font names that are checked  in  order
           when trying to find glyphs for characters. The first font defines the cell size for characters; other
           fonts  might  be  smaller, but not (in general) larger. A (hopefully) reasonable default font list is
           always appended to it; option <b>-fn</b>.

           Each font can either be a standard X11 core font (XLFD) name, with optional prefix "x:" or a Xft font
           (Compile <u>xft</u>), prefixed with "xft:".

           In addition, each font can be prefixed with additional hints and specifications  enclosed  in  square
           brackets  ("[]").  The only available hint currently is "codeset=codeset-name", and this is only used
           for Xft fonts.

           For example, this font resource

              URxvt.font: 9x15bold,\
                          -misc-fixed-bold-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1,\
                          -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--15-140-75-75-c-90-iso10646-1, \
                          [codeset=JISX0208]xft:Kochi Gothic:antialias=false, \
                          xft:Code2000:antialias=false

           specifies five fonts to be used. The first one is "9x15bold" (actually the iso8859-1 version  of  the
           second  font), which is the base font (because it is named first) and thus defines the character cell
           grid to be 9 pixels wide and 15 pixels high.

           The second font is just used to add additional unicode characters not in the base font, likewise  the
           third,  which  is  unfortunately  non-bold,  but  the  bold  version  of  the font does contain fewer
           characters, so this is a useful supplement.

           The third font is an Xft font with aliasing turned off, and the characters are  limited  to  the  <b>JIS</b>
           <b>0208</b>  codeset (i.e. japanese kanji). The font contains other characters, but we are not interested in
           them.

           The last font is a useful catch-all font that supplies most of the remaining unicode characters.

       <b>boldFont:</b> <u>fontlist</u>
       <b>italicFont:</b> <u>fontlist</u>
       <b>boldItalicFont:</b> <u>fontlist</u>
           The font list to use for displaying <b>bold</b>, <u>italic</u> or <u><b>bold</b></u> <u><b>italic</b></u> characters, respectively.

           If specified and non-empty, then the syntax is the same as for the <b>font</b>-resource, and the given  font
           list  will  be used as is, which makes it possible to substitute completely different font styles for
           bold and italic.

           If unset (the default), a suitable font list will be synthesized by "morphing" the normal  text  font
           list  into the desired shape. If that is not possible, replacement fonts of the desired shape will be
           tried.

           If set, but empty, then this specific style is disabled and the normal text font will being used  for
           the given style.

       <b>intensityStyles:</b> <u>boolean</u>
           When  font  styles  are  not  enabled,  or  this  option  is enabled (<b>True</b>, option <b>-is</b>, the default),
           bold/blink font styles imply high intensity  foreground/background  colours.  Disabling  this  option
           (<b>False</b>, option <b>+is</b>) disables this behaviour, the high intensity colours are not reachable.

       <b>title:</b> <u>string</u>
           Set window title string, the default title is the command-line specified after the <b>-e</b> option, if any,
           otherwise the application name; option <b>-title</b>.

       <b>iconName:</b> <u>string</u>
           Set the name used to label the window's icon or displayed in an icon manager window, it also sets the
           window's title unless it is explicitly set; option <b>-n</b>.

       <b>mapAlert:</b> <u>boolean</u>
           <b>True</b>:  de-iconify  (map)  on  receipt of a bell character. <b>False</b>: no de-iconify (map) on receipt of a
           bell character [default].

       <b>urgentOnBell:</b> <u>boolean</u>
           <b>True</b>: set the urgency hint for the wm on receipt of a bell character.  <b>False</b>: do not set the  urgency
           hint [default].

           urxvt resets the urgency hint on every focus change.

       <b>visualBell:</b> <u>boolean</u>
           <b>True</b>:  use  visual bell on receipt of a bell character; option <b>-vb</b>.  <b>False</b>: no visual bell [default];
           option <b>+vb</b>.

       <b>loginShell:</b> <u>boolean</u>
           <b>True</b>: start as a login shell by prepending a `-' to <b>argv[0]</b> of the shell; option <b>-ls</b>. <b>False</b>: start as
           a normal sub-shell [default]; option <b>+ls</b>.

       <b>multiClickTime:</b> <u>number</u>
           Specify the maximum time in milliseconds between  multi-click  select  events.  The  default  is  500
           milliseconds; option <b>-mc</b>.

       <b>utmpInhibit:</b> <u>boolean</u>
           <b>True</b>:  inhibit writing record into the system log file <b>utmp</b>; option <b>-ut</b>. <b>False</b>: write record into the
           system log file <b>utmp</b> [default]; option <b>+ut</b>.

       <b>print-pipe:</b> <u>string</u>
           Specify a command pipe for vt100 printer [default <u><b><a href="../man1/lpr.1.html">lpr</a></b>(1)</u>]. Use <b>Print</b> to initiate a screen dump to the
           printer and <b>Ctrl-Print</b> or <b>Shift-Print</b> to include the scrollback as well.

           The string will be interpreted as if typed into the shell as-is.

           Example:

              URxvt.print-pipe: cat &gt; $(TMPDIR=$HOME mktemp urxvt.XXXXXX)

           This creates a new file in your home directory with the screen contents every time you hit "Print".

       <b>scrollstyle:</b> <u>mode</u>
           Set scrollbar style to <b>rxvt</b>, <b>plain</b>, <b>next</b> or <b>xterm</b>. <b>plain</b> is the author's favourite.

       <b>scrollBar_floating:</b> <u>boolean</u>
           <b>True</b>:  display an rxvt scrollbar without a trough; option <b>-st</b>.  <b>False</b>: display an rxvt scrollbar with
           a trough; option <b>+st</b>.

       <b>scrollBar_align:</b> <u>mode</u>
           Align the <b>top</b>, <b>bottom</b> or <b>centre</b> [default] of the scrollbar thumb with the pointer  on  middle  button
           press/drag.

       <b>scrollTtyOutput:</b> <u>boolean</u>
           <b>True</b>: scroll to bottom when tty receives output; option <b>-si</b>.  <b>False</b>: do not scroll to bottom when tty
           receives output; option <b>+si</b>.

       <b>scrollWithBuffer:</b> <u>boolean</u>

           intercepted by rxvt-unicode for special handling and are not  passed  onto  the  shell;  option  <b>-sk</b>.
           <b>False</b>: do not scroll to bottom when a non-special key is pressed; option <b>+sk</b>.

       <b>saveLines:</b> <u>number</u>
           Save <u>number</u> lines in the scrollback buffer [default 1000]; option <b>-sl</b>.

       <b>internalBorder:</b> <u>number</u>

       <b>backspacekey:</b> <u>string</u>
           The  string  to  send  when  the backspace key is pressed. If set to <b>DEC</b> or unset it will send <b>Delete</b>
           (code 127) or, with control, <b>Backspace</b> (code 8) - which can be  reversed  with  the  appropriate  DEC
           private mode escape sequence.

       <b>deletekey:</b> <u>string</u>
           The  string to send when the delete key (not the keypad delete key) is pressed. If unset it will send
           the sequence traditionally associated with the <b>Execute</b> key.

       <b>cutchars:</b> <u>string</u>
           The characters used as delimiters for double-click word selection  (whitespace  delimiting  is  added
           automatically if resource is given).

           When  the  perl  selection  extension  is  in  use  (the default if compiled in, see the urxvt<b><a href="../man3/perl.3.html">perl</a></b>(3)
           manpage), a suitable regex using these characters will be created (if the resource exists, otherwise,
           no regex will be created). In this mode, characters outside ISO-8859-1 can be used.

           When the selection extension is not used, only ISO-8859-1 characters can be used. If  not  specified,
           the built-in default is used:

           <b>BACKSLASH</b> <b>`"'&amp;()*,;&lt;=&gt;?@[]^{|}</b>

       <b>preeditType:</b> <u>style</u>
           <b>OnTheSpot</b>, <b>OverTheSpot</b>, <b>OffTheSpot</b>, <b>Root</b>; option <b>-pt</b>.

       <b>inputMethod:</b> <u>name</u>
           <u>name</u> of inputMethod to use; option <b>-im</b>.

       <b>imLocale:</b> <u>name</u>
           The  locale  to  use  for opening the IM. You can use an "LC_CTYPE" of e.g.  "de_DE.UTF-8" for normal
           text processing but "ja_JP.EUC-JP" for the input extension to be able to  input  japanese  characters
           while staying in another locale; option <b>-imlocale</b>.

       <b>imFont:</b> <u>fontset</u>
           Specify  the font-set used for XIM styles "OverTheSpot" or "OffTheSpot". It must be a standard X font
           set (XLFD patterns separated by commas), i.e. it's not in the same format as  the  other  font  lists
           used  in urxvt. The default will be set-up to chose *any* suitable found found, preferably one or two
           pixels differing in size to the base font.  option <b>-imfont</b>.

       <b>tripleclickwords:</b> <u>boolean</u>
           Change the meaning of triple-click selection with the left mouse button. Instead of selecting a  full
           line it will extend the selection to the end of the logical line only; option <b>-tcw</b>.

       <b>disablePasteBrackets:</b> <u>boolean</u>
           Prevent emission of paste bracket sequences; option <b>-dpb</b>.

       <b>insecure:</b> <u>boolean</u>
           Enable  "insecure"  mode.  Rxvt-unicode offers some escape sequences that echo arbitrary strings like
           the icon name or the locale. This could be  abused  if  somebody  gets  8-bit-clean  access  to  your
           display,  whether  through a mail client displaying mail bodies unfiltered or through <b><a href="../man1/write.1.html">write</a></b>(1) or any
           other means. Therefore, these sequences are disabled by default. (Note  that  many  other  terminals,
           including xterm, have these sequences enabled by default, which doesn't make it safer, though).

           You  can  enable  them  by setting this boolean resource or specifying <b>-insecure</b> as an option. At the
           moment, this enables display-answer, locale, findfont, icon label and window title requests.

       <b>modifier:</b> <u>modifier</u>
           Set the key to be interpreted as the Meta key to: <b>alt</b>, <b>meta</b>, <b>hyper</b>, <b>super</b>, <b>mod1</b>,  <b>mod2</b>,  <b>mod3</b>,  <b>mod4</b>,
           <b>mod5</b>; option <b>-mod</b>.

       <b>answerbackString:</b> <u>string</u>
           Specify  the  reply  rxvt-unicode  sends  to  the  shell  when an ENQ (control-E) character is passed
           through. It may contain escape values as described in the entry on <b>keysym</b> following.

       <b>secondaryScreen:</b> <u>boolean</u>
           Turn on/off secondary screen (default enabled).

       <b>rewrapMode:</b> <u>mode</u>
           Sets long line rewrap behaviour on window resize to one of <b>auto</b> (default), <b>always</b> or <b>never</b>.

       <b>secondaryScroll:</b> <u>boolean</u>
           Turn on/off secondary screen scroll (default enabled). If this option  is  enabled,  scrolls  on  the
           secondary  screen  will  change  the  scrollback  buffer  and, when secondaryScreen is off, switching
           to/from the secondary screen will instead scroll the screen up.

       <b>hold</b>: <u>boolean</u>
           Turn on/off hold window after exit support. If enabled, urxvt will not immediately destroy its window
           when the program executed within it exits. Instead, it will wait till it is being killed or closed by
           the user.

       <b>chdir</b>: <u>path</u>
           Sets the working directory for the shell (or the command specified via  <b>-e</b>).  The  <u>path</u>  must  be  an
           absolute  path  and  it must exist for urxvt to start. If it isn't specified then the current working
           directory will be used; option <b>-cd</b>.

       <b>keysym.</b><u>sym</u>: <u>action</u>
           Compile <u>frills</u>: Associate <u>action</u> with keysym <u>sym</u>. The intervening resource  name  <b>keysym.</b>  cannot  be
           omitted.

           Using  this resource, you can map key combinations such as "Ctrl-Shift-BackSpace" to various actions,
           such as outputting a different string than would normally result from that  combination,  making  the
           terminal scroll up or down the way you want it, or any other thing an extension might provide.

           The key combination that triggers the action, <u>sym</u>, has the following format:

              (modifiers-)key

           Where <u>modifiers</u> can be any combination of the following full or abbreviated modifier names:
           ISOLevel3   I
           AppKeypad   K
           Control     C
           NumLock     N
           Shift       S
           Meta        M or A
           Lock        L
           Mod1        1
           Mod2        2
           Mod3        3
           Mod4        4
           Mod5        5

           The  <b>NumLock</b>,  <b>Meta</b> and <b>ISOLevel3</b> modifiers are usually aliased to whatever modifier the NumLock key,
           Meta/Alt keys or ISO Level3 Shift/AltGr keys are being mapped.  <b>AppKeypad</b>  is  a  synthetic  modifier
           mapped to the current application keymap mode state.

           Due the the large number of modifier combinations, a key mapping will match if <u>at</u> <u>least</u> the specified
           identifiers are being set, and no other key mappings with those and more bits are being defined. That
           means  that defining a mapping for "a" will automatically provide definitions for "Meta-a", "Shift-a"
           and so on, unless some of those are defined mappings themselves. See the  "builtin:"  action,  below,
           for a way to work around this when this is a problem.

           The spelling of <u>key</u> depends on your implementation of X. An easy way to find a key name is to use the
           <b><a href="../man1/xev.1.html">xev</a></b>(1)  command.  You  can find a list by looking for the "XK_" macros in the <b>X11/keysymdef.h</b> include
           file (omit the "XK_" prefix). Alternatively you can specify <u>key</u> by its hex  keysym  value  (<b>0x0000</b>  <b>-</b>
           <b>0xFFFF</b>).

           As  with any resource value, the <u>action</u> string may contain backslash escape sequences ("\n": newline,
           "\\": backslash, "\000": octal number), see RESOURCES in "man 7 X" for further details.

           An action starts with an action prefix that selects a certain type of action, followed by a colon. An
           action string without colons is interpreted as a literal string to pass to the  tty  (as  if  it  was
           prefixed with "string:").

           The following action prefixes are known - extensions can provide additional prefixes:

           string:STRING
               If  the  <u>action</u>  starts  with  "string:"  (or  otherwise  contains no colons), then the remaining
               "STRING" will be passed to the program running in the terminal. For example,  you  could  replace
               whatever Shift-Tab outputs by the string "echo rm -rf /" followed by a newline:

                  URxvt.keysym.Shift-Tab: string:echo rm -rf /\n

               This could in theory be used to completely redefine your keymap.

               In  addition,  for actions of this type, you can define a range of keysyms in one shot by loading
               the "keysym-list" perl extension and providing an <u>action</u> with pattern  <b>list/PREFIX/MIDDLE/SUFFIX</b>,
               where the delimiter `/' should be a character not used by the strings.

               Its usage can be demonstrated by an example:

                 URxvt.keysym.M-C-0x61:    list|\033&lt;|abc|&gt;

               The above line is equivalent to the following three lines:

                 URxvt.keysym.Meta-Control-0x61:    string:\033&lt;a&gt;
                 URxvt.keysym.Meta-Control-0x62:    string:\033&lt;b&gt;
                 URxvt.keysym.Meta-Control-0x63:    string:\033&lt;c&gt;

           command:STRING
               If <u>action</u> takes the form of "command:STRING", the specified <b>STRING</b> is interpreted and executed as
               urxvt's  control  sequence  (basically  the  opposite of "string:" - instead of sending it to the
               program running in the terminal, it will be treated as if it were program output). This  is  most
               useful to feed command sequences into urxvt.

               For  example the following means "change the current locale to "zh_CN.GBK" when Control-Meta-c is
               being pressed":

                 URxvt.keysym.M-C-c: command:\033]701;zh_CN.GBK\007

               The following example will map Control-Meta-1 and Control-Meta-2 to  the  fonts  "suxuseuro"  and
               "9x15bold", so you can have some limited font-switching at runtime:

                 URxvt.keysym.M-C-1: command:\033]50;suxuseuro\007
                 URxvt.keysym.M-C-2: command:\033]50;9x15bold\007

               Other things are possible, e.g. resizing (see <a href="../man7/urxvt.7.html">urxvt</a>(7) for more info):

                 URxvt.keysym.M-C-3: command:\033[8;25;80t
                 URxvt.keysym.M-C-4: command:\033[8;48;110t

           builtin:
               The  builtin  action is the action that urxvt would execute if no key binding existed for the key
               combination. The obvious use is to undo the effect of existing bindings. The not so  obvious  use
               is to reinstate bindings when another binding overrides too many modifiers.

               For example if you overwrite the "Insert" key you will disable urxvt's "Shift-Insert" mapping. To
               re-enable  that,  you  can  poke  "holes"  into  the  user-defined  keymap  using  the "builtin:"
               replacement:

                 URxvt.keysym.Insert: &lt;my insert key sequence&gt;
                 URxvt.keysym.S-Insert: builtin:

               The first line defines a mapping for "Insert" and <u>any</u> combination of modifiers. The  second  line
               re-establishes the default mapping for "Shift-Insert".

           builtin-string:
               This  action is mainly useful to restore string mappings for keys that have predefined actions in
               urxvt. The exact semantics are a bit difficult to explain - basically, this action will send  the
               string to the application that would be sent if urxvt wouldn't have a built-in action for it.

               An  example  might  make  it  clearer:  urxvt  normally  pastes  the  selection  when  you  press
               "Shift-Insert". With the following bindings, it would instead emit the  (undocumented,  but  what
               applications running in the terminal might expect) sequence "ESC [ 2 $" instead:

                  URxvt.keysym.S-Insert: builtin-string:
                  URxvt.keysym.C-S-Insert: builtin:

               The  first  line  disables  the  paste  functionality  for  that  key combination, and the second
               reinstates the default behaviour for "Control-Shift-Insert", which would otherwise be overridden.

               Similarly, to let applications gain access to the "C-M-c" (copy to clipboard) and "C-M-v"  (paste
               clipboard) key combination, you can do this:

                  URxvt.keysym.C-M-c: builtin-string:
                  URxvt.keysym.C-M-v: builtin-string:

           EXTENSION:STRING
               An  action of this form invokes the action <b>STRING</b>, if any, provided by the urxvt<b><a href="../man3/perl.3.html">perl</a></b>(3) extension
               <b>EXTENSION</b>. The extension will be loaded automatically if necessary.

               Not all extensions define actions, but popular extensions  that  do  include  the  <u>selection</u>  and
               <u>matcher</u>  extensions  (documented  in their own manpages, urxvt-<b><a href="../man1/selection.1.html">selection</a></b>(1) and urxvt-<b><a href="../man1/matcher.1.html">matcher</a></b>(1),
               respectively).

               From the silly examples department, this will rot13-"encrypt" urxvt's selection when Alt-Control-
               c is pressed on typical PC keyboards:

                 URxvt.keysym.M-C-c: selection:rot13

           perl:STRING *DEPRECATED*
               This is a deprecated way of invoking commands provided by perl extensions. It is still supported,
               but should not be used anymore.

       <b>perl-ext-common</b>: <u>string</u>
       <b>perl-ext</b>: <u>string</u>
           Comma-separated list(s) of perl extension scripts  (default:  "default")  to  use  in  this  terminal
           instance; option <b>-pe</b>.

           Extension names can be prefixed with a "-" sign to remove them again, in case they had been specified
           earlier.  This  can  be useful to selectively disable some extensions loaded by default, or specified
           via the "perl-ext-common" resource. For  example,  "default,-selection"  will  use  all  the  default
           extensions except "selection".

           To  prohibit autoloading of extensions, you can prefix them with "/", which will make urxvt refuse to
           automatically load them (this can be overridden, however, by  specifying  the  extension  name  again
           without a prefix, though). This does not prohibit extensions themselves loading other extensions. For
           example,  "default,/background"  will  keep  the  "background"  extension  from  being  loaded when a
           background OSC sequence is received.

           The  default  set  includes   the   "selection",   "option-popup",   "selection-popup",   "readline",
           "searchable-scrollback" and "confirm-paste" extensions, as well as any extensions which are mentioned
           in <b>keysym</b> resources.

           Any  extension  such  that  a  corresponding  resource  is given on the command line is automatically
           appended to <b>perl-ext</b>.

           Each extension is looked up in the library directories, loaded if necessary, and bound to the current
           terminal instance. When the library search path contains multiple extension files of the  same  name,
           then the first one found will be used.

           If  both  of these resources are the empty string, then the perl interpreter will not be initialized.
           The rationale for having two options is that <b>perl-ext-common</b> will be used for extensions that  should
           be available to all instances, while <b>perl-ext</b> is used for specific instances.

       <b>perl-eval</b>: <u>string</u>
           Perl code to be evaluated when all extensions have been registered. See the urxvt<b><a href="../man3/perl.3.html">perl</a></b>(3) manpage.

       <b>perl-lib</b>: <u>path</u>
           Colon-separated  list  of  additional  directories that hold extension scripts. When looking for perl
           extensions, urxvt will first look in these directories, then in $URXVT_PERL_LIB, <u>$HOME/.urxvt/ext</u> and
           lastly in <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/urxvt/perl/</u>.

           See the urxvt<b><a href="../man3/perl.3.html">perl</a></b>(3) manpage.

       <b>selection.pattern-</b><u><b>idx</b></u>: <u>perl-regex</u>
           Additional selection patterns, see the urxvt<b><a href="../man3/perl.3.html">perl</a></b>(3) manpage for details.

       <b>selection-autotransform.</b><u><b>idx</b></u>: <u>perl-transform</u>
           Selection auto-transform patterns, see the urxvt<b><a href="../man3/perl.3.html">perl</a></b>(3) manpage for details.

       <b>searchable-scrollback:</b> <u>keysym</u> *DEPRECATED*
           This resource is deprecated and will be removed. Use a <b>keysym</b> resource instead, e.g.:

              URxvt.keysym.M-s: searchable-scrollback:start

       <b>url-launcher</b>: <u>string</u>
           Specifies the program to be started with a URL argument. Used by the "selection-popup" and  "matcher"
           perl extensions.

       <b>transient-for</b>: <u>windowid</u>
           Compile <u>frills</u>: Sets the WM_TRANSIENT_FOR property to the given window id.

       <b>override-redirect</b>: <u>boolean</u>
           Compile  <u>frills</u>: Sets override-redirect for the terminal window, making it almost invisible to window
           managers; option <b>-override-redirect</b>.

       <b>iso14755:</b> <u>boolean</u>
           Turn on/off ISO 14755 (default enabled).

       <b>iso14755_52:</b> <u>boolean</u>
           Turn on/off ISO 14755 5.2 mode (default enabled).

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>SCROLLBAR</b></h4><pre>
       Lines of text that scroll off the top of the <b>urxvt</b> window (resource: <b>saveLines</b>) and can be scrolled  back
       using  the  scrollbar or by keystrokes. The normal <b>urxvt</b> scrollbar has arrows and its behaviour is fairly
       intuitive. The <b>xterm-scrollbar</b> is without arrows and its behaviour mimics that of <u>xterm</u>

       Scroll down with <b>Button1</b> (<b>xterm-scrollbar</b>) or <b>Shift-Next</b>.  Scroll up with  <b>Button3</b>  (<b>xterm-scrollbar</b>)  or
       <b>Shift-Prior</b>.  Continuous scroll with <b>Button2</b>.

</pre><h4><b>MOUSE</b> <b>REPORTING</b></h4><pre>
       To temporarily override mouse reporting, for either the scrollbar or the normal text selection/insertion,
       hold either the Shift or the Meta (Alt) key while performing the desired mouse action.

       If mouse reporting mode is active, the normal scrollbar actions are disabled -- on the assumption that we
       are  using a fullscreen application. Instead, pressing Button1 and Button3 sends <b>ESC</b> <b>[</b> <b>6</b> <b>~</b> (Next) and <b>ESC</b>
       <b>[</b> <b>5</b> <b>~</b> (Prior), respectively. Similarly, clicking on the up and down arrows sends <b>ESC</b> <b>[</b> <b>A</b> (Up) and <b>ESC</b> <b>[</b> <b>B</b>
       (Down), respectively.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>SELECTION:</b> <b>SELECTING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PASTING</b> <b>TEXT</b></h4><pre>
       The behaviour of text selection and insertion/pasting mechanism is similar to <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1).

       <b>Selecting</b>:
           Left click at the beginning of the region, drag to the end of the region and release; Right click  to
           extend  the marked region; Left double-click to select a word; Left triple-click to select the entire
           logical line (which can span multiple screen lines), unless modified by resource <b>tripleclickwords</b>.

           Starting a selection while pressing the <b>Meta</b> key (or <b>Meta+Ctrl</b> keys) (Compile: <u>frills</u>) will create  a
           rectangular  selection instead of a normal one. In this mode, every selected row becomes its own line
           in the selection, and trailing whitespace is visually underlined and removed from the selection.

       <b>Pasting</b>:
           Pressing and releasing the Middle mouse button in an <b>urxvt</b> window causes the  value  of  the  PRIMARY
           selection  (or  CLIPBOARD  with  the  <b>Meta</b>  modifier)  to  be inserted as if it had been typed on the
           keyboard.

           Pressing <b>Shift-Insert</b> causes the value of the PRIMARY selection to be inserted too.

           rxvt-unicode also provides the bindings <b>Ctrl-Meta-c</b> and &lt;Ctrl-Meta-v&gt; to interact with the  CLIPBOARD
           selection. The first binding causes the value of the internal selection to be copied to the CLIPBOARD
           selection, while the second binding causes the value of the CLIPBOARD selection to be inserted.

</pre><h4><b>CHANGING</b> <b>FONTS</b></h4><pre>
       Changing  fonts (or font sizes, respectively) via the keypad is not yet supported in rxvt-unicode. Bug me
       if you need this.

       You can, however, switch fonts at runtime using escape sequences, e.g.:

          printf '\e]710;%s\007' "9x15bold,xft:Kochi Gothic"

       You can use keyboard shortcuts, too:

          URxvt.keysym.M-C-1: command:\033]710;suxuseuro\007\033]711;suxuseuro\007
          URxvt.keysym.M-C-2: command:\033]710;9x15bold\007\033]711;9x15bold\007

       rxvt-unicode will automatically re-apply these fonts to the output so far.

</pre><h4><b>ISO</b> <b>14755</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       ISO 14755 is a standard for entering and  viewing  unicode  characters  and  character  codes  using  the
       keyboard.  It  consists  of  4  parts. The first part is available if rxvt-unicode has been compiled with
       "--enable-frills", the rest is available when rxvt-unicode was compiled with "--enable-iso14755".

       •   5.1: Basic method

           This allows you to enter unicode characters using their hexcode.

           Start by pressing and holding both "Control" and "Shift", then  enter  hex-digits  (between  one  and
           six).  Releasing  "Control" and "Shift" will commit the character as if it were typed directly. While
           holding down "Control" and "Shift" you can also enter multiple characters by pressing "Space",  which
           will commit the current character and lets you start a new one.

           As  an example of use, imagine a business card with a japanese e-mail address, which you cannot type.
           Fortunately, the card has the e-mail address printed as hexcodes, e.g. "671d  65e5".  You  can  enter
           this  easily  by  pressing  "Control"  and  "Shift", followed by "6-7-1-D-SPACE-6-5-E-5", followed by
           releasing the modifier keys.

       •   5.2: Keyboard symbols entry method

           This  mode  lets  you  input  characters  representing  the  keycap  symbols  of  your  keyboard,  if
           representable in the current locale encoding.

           Start  by  pressing "Control" and "Shift" together, then releasing them. The next special key (cursor
           keys, home etc.) you  enter  will  not  invoke  its  usual  function  but  instead  will  insert  the
           corresponding  keycap  symbol.  The  symbol  will  only  be  entered  when the key has been released,
           otherwise pressing e.g. "Shift" would enter the symbol  for  "ISO  Level  2  Switch",  although  your
           intention might have been to enter a reverse tab (Shift-Tab).

       •   5.3: Screen-selection entry method

           While  this  is implemented already (it's basically the selection mechanism), it could be extended by
           displaying a unicode character map.

       •   5.4: Feedback method for identifying displayed characters for later input

           This method lets you display the unicode character code associated with characters already displayed.

           You enter this mode by holding down "Control" and "Shift" together, then  pressing  and  holding  the
           left  mouse  button and moving around. The unicode hex code(s) (it might be a combining character) of
           the character under the pointer is displayed until you release "Control" and "Shift".

           In addition to the hex codes it will  display  the  font  used  to  draw  this  character  -  due  to
           implementation  reasons,  characters  combined with combining characters, line drawing characters and
           unknown characters will always be drawn using the built-in support font.

       With respect to conformance, rxvt-unicode is supposed to be compliant to both scenario A  and  B  of  ISO
       14755, including part 5.2.

</pre><h4><b>LOGIN</b> <b>STAMP</b></h4><pre>
       <b>urxvt</b>  tries  to  write an entry into the <u><a href="../man5/utmp.5.html">utmp</a></u>(5) file so that it can be seen via the <u><b><a href="../man1/who.1.html">who</a></b>(1)</u> command, and
       can accept messages.  To allow this feature, <b>urxvt</b> may need to be installed setuid root on  some  systems
       or setgid to root or to some other group on others.

</pre><h4><b>COLOURS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>GRAPHICS</b></h4><pre>
       In  addition  to the default foreground and background colours, <b>urxvt</b> can display up to 88/256 colours: 8
       ANSI colours plus high-intensity (potentially bold/blink) versions of the same, and 72  (or  240  in  256
       colour mode) colours arranged in an 4x4x4 (or 6x6x6) colour RGB cube plus a 8 (24) colour greyscale ramp.

       <b>urxvt</b> supports direct 24-bit fg/bg RGB colour escapes " ESC [ 38 ; 2 ; R ; G ; Bm " / " ESC [ 48 ; 2; R ;
       G ; Bm ". However the number of 24-bit colours that can be used is limited: an internal 7x7x5 (256 colour
       mode)  or 6x6x4 (88 colour mode) colour cube is used to index into the 24-bit colour space. When indexing
       collisions happen, the nearest old colour in the cube will be adapted to the new 24-bit RGB colour.  That
       means one cannot use many similar 24-bit colours. It's typically not a problem in common scenarios.

       Here is a list of the ANSI colours with their names.
       color0       (black)            = Black
       color1       (red)              = Red3
       color2       (green)            = Green3
       color3       (yellow)           = Yellow3
       color4       (blue)             = Blue3
       color5       (magenta)          = Magenta3
       color6       (cyan)             = Cyan3
       color7       (white)            = AntiqueWhite
       color8       (bright black)     = Grey25
       color9       (bright red)       = Red
       color10      (bright green)     = Green
       color11      (bright yellow)    = Yellow
       color12      (bright blue)      = Blue
       color13      (bright magenta)   = Magenta
       color14      (bright cyan)      = Cyan
       color15      (bright white)     = White
       foreground                      = Black
       background                      = White

       It  is  also  possible to specify the colour values of <b>foreground</b>, <b>background</b>, <b>cursorColor</b>, <b>cursorColor2</b>,
       <b>colorBD</b>, <b>colorUL</b> as  a  number  0-15,  as  a  convenient  shorthand  to  reference  the  colour  name  of
       color0-color15.

       The  following  text  gives values for the standard 88 colour mode (and values for the 256 colour mode in
       parentheses).

       The RGB cube uses indices 16..79 (16..231) using the following formulas:

          index_88  = (r * 4 + g) * 4 + b + 16   # r, g, b = 0..3
          index_256 = (r * 6 + g) * 6 + b + 16   # r, g, b = 0..5

       The grayscale ramp uses indices 80..87 (232..239), from 10% to 90% in 10% steps (1/26 to  25/26  in  1/26
       steps) - black and white are already part of the RGB cube.

       Together, all those colours implement the 88 (256) colour xterm colours. Only the first 16 can be changed
       using resources currently, the rest can only be changed via command sequences ("escape codes").

       Applications  are  advised  to use terminfo or command sequences to discover number and RGB values of all
       colours (yes, you can query this...).

       Note that <b>-rv</b> (<b>"reverseVideo:</b> <b>True"</b>) simulates reverse video by always swapping the foreground/background
       colours. This is in contrast to <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) where the colours are only swapped if they  have  not  otherwise
       been specified. For example,

          urxvt -fg Black -bg White -rv

       would yield White on Black, while on <u><a href="../man1/xterm.1.html">xterm</a></u>(1) it would yield Black on White.

   <b>ALPHA</b> <b>CHANNEL</b> <b>SUPPORT</b>
       If  Xft  support  has  been  compiled in and as long as Xft/Xrender/X don't get their act together, rxvt-
       unicode will do its own alpha channel management:

       You can prefix any colour with an opaqueness percentage enclosed in  brackets,  i.e.  "[percent]",  where
       "percent" is a decimal percentage (0-100) that specifies the opacity of the colour, where 0 is completely
       transparent  and  100  is  completely  opaque.  For  example,  "[50]red" is a half-transparent red, while
       "[95]#00ff00" is an almost opaque green. This is the recommended format to specify  transparency  values,
       and works with all ways to specify a colour.

       For   complete   control,   rxvt-unicode  also  supports  "rgba:rrrr/gggg/bbbb/aaaa"  (exactly  four  hex
       digits/component) colour specifications, where the additional "aaaa" component specifies opacity  (alpha)
       values.  The minimum value of 0000 is completely transparent, while "ffff" is completely opaque). The two
       example  colours   from   earlier   could   also   be   specified   as   "rgba:ff00/0000/0000/8000"   and
       "rgba:0000/ff00/0000/f332".

       You  probably  need to specify <b>"-depth</b> <b>32"</b>, too, to force a visual with alpha channels, and have the luck
       that your X-server uses ARGB pixel layout, as X is far from just supporting ARGB visuals out of the  box,
       and rxvt-unicode just fudges around.

       For  example,  the  following  selects  an  almost completely transparent black background, and an almost
       opaque pink foreground:

          urxvt -depth 32 -bg rgba:0000/0000/0000/4444 -fg "[80]pink"

       When not using a background image, then the interpretation of the alpha channel is up to your compositing
       manager (most interpret it as transparency of course).

       When using a background pixmap or pseudo-transparency, then the background colour will always  behave  as
       if  it  were  completely  transparent  (so  the background image shows instead), regardless of how it was
       specified, while other colours will either be transparent as specified (the background  image  will  show
       through) on servers supporting the RENDER extension, or fully opaque on servers not supporting the RENDER
       EXTENSION.

       Please note that due to bugs in Xft, specifying alpha values might result in garbage being displayed when
       the X-server does not support the RENDER extension.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>urxvt</b> sets and/or uses the following environment variables:

       <b>TERM</b>
           Normally set to "rxvt-unicode", unless overwritten at configure time, via resources or on the command
           line.

       <b>COLORTERM</b>
           Either "rxvt", "rxvt-xpm", depending on whether urxvt was compiled with background image support, and
           optionally  with  the  added  extension  "-mono"  to  indicate that rxvt-unicode runs on a monochrome
           screen.

       <b>COLORFGBG</b>
           Set to a string of the form "fg;bg" or "fg;xpm;bg", where "fg" is the colour  code  used  as  default
           foreground/text  colour  (or the string "default" to indicate that the default-colour escape sequence
           is to be used), "bg" is the colour code used as default background colour (or the string  "default"),
           and "xpm" is the string "default" if urxvt was compiled with background image support. Libraries like
           "ncurses" and "slang" can (and do) use this information to optimize screen output.

       <b>WINDOWID</b>
           Set  to  the  (decimal)  X  Window  ID  of  the  urxvt window (the toplevel window, which usually has
           subwindows for the scrollbar, the terminal window and so on).

       <b>TERMINFO</b>
           Set to the terminfo directory iff urxvt was configured with "--with-terminfo=PATH".

       <b>DISPLAY</b>
           Used by urxvt to connect to the display and set to the correct display  in  its  child  processes  if
           "-display" isn't used to override. It defaults to ":0" if it doesn't exist.

       <b>SHELL</b>
           The shell to be used for command execution, defaults to "<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>".

       <b>RXVT_SOCKET</b> [<u>sic</u>]
           The unix domain socket path used by <a href="../man1/urxvtc.1.html">urxvtc</a>(1) and <a href="../man1/urxvtd.1.html">urxvtd</a>(1).

           Default <u>$HOME/.urxvt/urxvtd-&lt;nodename&gt;</u>.

       <b>URXVT_PERL_LIB</b>
           Additional  <u>:</u>-separated library search path for perl extensions. Will be searched after <b>-perl-lib</b> but
           before <u><a href="file:~/.urxvt/ext">~/.urxvt/ext</a></u> and the system library directory.

       <b>URXVT_PERL_VERBOSITY</b>
           See <a href="../man3/urxvtperl.3.html">urxvtperl</a>(3).

       <b>HOME</b>
           Used to locate the default directory for the unix domain socket  for  daemon  communications  and  to
           locate various resource files (such as ".Xdefaults")

       <b>XAPPLRESDIR</b>
           Directory where application-specific X resource files are located.

       <b>XENVIRONMENT</b>
           If set and accessible, gives the name of a X resource file to be loaded by urxvt.
