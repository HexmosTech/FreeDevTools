       This documentation is displayed if exiftool is run without an input <u>FILE</u> when one is expected.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A command-line interface to Image::ExifTool, used for reading and writing meta information in a variety
       of file types.  <u>FILE</u> is one or more source file names, directory names, or "-" for the standard input.
       Metadata is read from source files and printed in readable form to the console (or written to output text
       files with <b>-w</b>).

       To write or delete metadata, tag values are assigned using -<u>TAG</u>=[<u>VALUE</u>], and/or the <b>-geotag</b>, <b>-csv=</b> or
       <b>-json=</b> options.  To copy or move metadata, the <b>-tagsFromFile</b> feature is used.  By default the original
       files are preserved with "_original" appended to their names -- be sure to verify that the new files are
       OK before erasing the originals.  Once in write mode, exiftool will ignore any read-specific options.

       Note:  If <u>FILE</u> is a directory name then only supported file types in the directory are processed (in
       write mode only writable types are processed).  However, files may be specified by name, or the <b>-ext</b>
       option may be used to force processing of files with any extension.  Hidden files in the directory are
       also processed.  Adding the <b>-r</b> option causes subdirectories to be processed recursively, but
       subdirectories with names beginning with "." are skipped unless <b>-r.</b> is used.

       Below is a list of file types and meta information formats currently supported by ExifTool (r = read, w =
       write, c = create):

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Case is not significant for any command-line option (including tag and group names), except for single-
       character options when the corresponding upper-case option exists.  Many single-character options have
       equivalent long-name versions (shown in brackets), and some options have inverses which are invoked with
       a leading double-dash.  Unrecognized options are interpreted as tag names (for this reason, multiple
       single-character options may NOT be combined into one argument).  Contrary to standard practice, options
       may appear after source file names on the exiftool command line.

   <b>Option</b> <b>Details</b>
       <u>Tag</u> <u>operations</u>

       <b>-</b><u>TAG</u> Extract  information for the specified tag (eg. "-CreateDate").  Multiple tags may be specified in a
            single command.  A tag name is the handle by which  a  piece  of  information  is  referenced.   See
            Image::ExifTool::TagNames  for documentation on available tag names.  A tag name may include leading
            group names separated by colons (eg. "-EXIF:CreateDate", or  "-Doc1:XMP:Creator"),  and  each  group
            name  may  be prefixed by a digit to specify family number (eg.  "-1IPTC:City").  (Note that the API
            SavePath and SaveFormat options must be used for the family  5  and  6  groups  respectively  to  be
            available.)  Use the <b>-listg</b> option to list available group names by family.

            A  special  tag  name  of  "All"  may  be used to indicate all meta information (ie. <b>-All</b>).  This is
            particularly useful when a group name is specified to extract all information in a group (but beware
            that unless the <b>-a</b> option is also used, some tags in the group may be suppressed by same-named  tags
            in other groups).  The wildcard characters "?" and "*" may be used in a tag name to match any single
            character and zero or more characters respectively.  These may not be used in a group name, with the
            exception  that  a group name of "*" (or "All") may be used to extract all instances of a tag (as if
            <b>-a</b> was used).  Note that arguments containing wildcards must be quoted on the command line  of  most
            systems to prevent shell globbing.

            A "#" may be appended to the tag name to disable the print conversion on a per-tag basis (see the <b>-n</b>
            option).  This may also be used when writing or copying tags.

            If no tags are specified, all available information is extracted (as if "-All" had been specified).

            Note:   Descriptions,  not  tag names, are shown by default when extracting information.  Use the <b>-s</b>
            option to see the tag names instead.

       <b>--</b><u>TAG</u>
            Exclude specified tag from extracted information.  Same as the <b>-x</b> option.  Group names and wildcards
            are permitted as described above for <b>-</b><u>TAG</u>.  Once excluded from the output, a  tag  may  not  be  re-
            included  by a subsequent option.  May also be used following a <b>-tagsFromFile</b> option to exclude tags
            from being copied (when redirecting to another tag, it is the source tag that should  be  excluded),
            or  to  exclude  groups  from  being  deleted  when deleting all information (eg. "-all= --exif:all"
            deletes all but EXIF information).  But note that this will not exclude individual tags from a group
            delete (unless a family 2 group is specified, see note 4 below).  Instead, individual  tags  may  be
            recovered using the <b>-tagsFromFile</b> option (eg. "-all= -tagsfromfile @ -artist").

            To  speed  processing  when  reading  XMP,  exclusions  in  XMP groups also bypass processing of the
            corresponding XMP property and any contained properties.  For  example,  "--xmp-crs:all"  may  speed
            processing  significantly  in cases where a large number of XMP-crs tags exist.  To use this feature
            to bypass processing of a specific XMP property, the property name  must  be  used  instead  of  the
            ExifTool  tag  name  (eg.  "--xmp-crs:dabs").   Also,  "XMP-all"  may be used to to indicate any XMP
            namespace (eg. "--xmp-all:dabs").

       <b>-</b><u>TAG</u>[+-^]<b>=</b>[<u>VALUE</u>]
            Write a new value for the specified tag (eg. "-comment=wow"), or delete the tag if no <u>VALUE</u> is given
            (eg. "-comment=").  "+=" and "-=" are used to add or remove existing entries  from  a  list,  or  to
            shift  date/time  values  (see  Image::ExifTool::Shift.pl and notes 6 and 7 below for more details).
            "+=" may also be used to increment numerical values (or decrement if <u>VALUE</u> is  negative),  and  "-="
            may be used to conditionally delete or replace a tag (see "WRITING EXAMPLES" for examples).  "^=" is
            used  to  write an empty string instead of deleting the tag when no <u>VALUE</u> is given, but otherwise it
            is equivalent to "=".  (Note that the caret must be quoted on the Windows command line.)

            <u>TAG</u> may contain one or more leading family 0, 1, 2 or 7 group names,  prefixed  by  optional  family
            numbers,  and  separated colons.  If no group name is specified, the tag is created in the preferred
            group, and updated in any other location where a same-named tag already exists.  The preferred group
            in JPEG and TIFF-format images is the first group in the following list where <u>TAG</u> is valid: 1) EXIF,
            2) IPTC, 3) XMP.

            The wildcards "*" and "?" may be used in tag names to assign the same value to multiple tags.   When
            specified  with  wildcards, "Unsafe" tags are not written.  A tag name of "All" is equivalent to "*"
            (except that it doesn't require quoting, while arguments with wildcards do  on  systems  with  shell
            globbing),  and  is  often  used  when  deleting  all metadata (ie. "-All=") or an entire group (eg.
            "-XMP-dc:All=", see note 4 below).  Note that not all groups are deletable, and that the JPEG  APP14
            "Adobe"  group  is  not  removed by default with "-All=" because it may affect the appearance of the
            image.  However, color space information is removed, so the colors may be affected (but this may  be
            avoided by copying back the tags defined by the ColorSpaceTags shortcut).  Use the <b>-listd</b> option for
            a  complete list of deletable groups, and see note 5 below regarding the "APP" groups.  Also, within
            an image some groups may be contained within others, and these groups are removed if the  containing
            group is deleted:

              JPEG Image:
              - Deleting EXIF or IFD0 also deletes ExifIFD, GlobParamIFD,
                GPS, IFD1, InteropIFD, MakerNotes, PrintIM and SubIFD.
              - Deleting ExifIFD also deletes InteropIFD and MakerNotes.
              - Deleting Photoshop also deletes IPTC.

              TIFF Image:
              - Deleting EXIF only removes ExifIFD which also deletes
                InteropIFD and MakerNotes.

              MOV/MP4 Video:
              - Deleting ItemList also deletes Keys tags.

            Notes:

            1) <b>Many</b> <b>tag</b> <b>values</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>command</b>.  If two assignments affect the same tag, the
            latter takes precedence (except for list-type tags, for which both values are written).

            2)  In  general,  MakerNotes  tags  are considered "Permanent", and may be edited but not created or
            deleted individually.  This avoids many potential problems, including the  inevitable  compatibility
            problems  with OEM software which may be very inflexible about the information it expects to find in
            the maker notes.

            3) Changes to PDF files by ExifTool are reversible (by deleting the update with  "-PDF-update:all=")
            because the original information is never actually deleted from the file.  So ExifTool alone may not
            be used to securely edit metadata in PDF files.

            4) Specifying "-GROUP:all=" deletes the entire group as a block only if a single family 0 or 1 group
            is  specified.  Otherwise all deletable tags in the specified group(s) are removed individually, and
            in this case is it possible to exclude individual tags from a mass delete.  For example,  "-time:all
            --Exif:Time:All"  removes  all  deletable  Time tags except those in the EXIF.  This difference also
            applies if family 2 is specified when deleting all groups.  For example, "-2all:all="  deletes  tags
            individually, while "-all:all=" deletes entire blocks.

            5) The "APP" group names ("APP0" through "APP15") are used to delete JPEG application segments which
            are  not  associated  with  another deletable group.  For example, specifying "-APP14:All=" will NOT
            delete the APP14 "Adobe" segment because this is accomplished  with  "-Adobe:All".   But  note  that
            these unnamed APP segments may not be excluded with "--APPxx:all" when deleting all information.

            6)  When  shifting  a  value,  the shift is applied to the original value of the tag, overriding any
            other values previously assigned to the tag on the same command line.  To shift  a  date/time  value
            and copy it to another tag in the same operation, use the <b>-globalTimeShift</b> option.

            7)  The  "+="  operator may not be used to shift a List-type date/time tag (eg. XMP-dc:Date) because
            "+=" is used to add elements to the list.  Instead, the <b>-globalTimeShift</b> option should be used.

            Special feature:  Integer values may be specified in hexadecimal with a  leading  "0x",  and  simple
            rational values may be specified as fractions.

       <b>-</b><u>TAG</u>&lt;=<u>DATFILE</u> or <b>-</b><u>TAG</u>&lt;=<u>FMT</u>
            Set  the value of a tag from the contents of file <u>DATFILE</u>.  The file name may also be given by a <u>FMT</u>
            string where %d, %f and %e represent the directory, file name and extension  of  the  original  <u>FILE</u>
            (see the <b>-w</b> option for more details).  Note that quotes are required around this argument to prevent
            shell redirection since it contains a "&lt;" symbol.  If <u>DATFILE</u>/<u>FMT</u> is not provided, the effect is the
            same  as  "-TAG=",  and the tag is simply deleted.  "+&lt;=" or "-&lt;=" may also be used to add or delete
            specific list entries, or to shift date/time values.

       <b>-tagsFromFile</b> <u>SRCFILE</u> or <u>FMT</u>
            Copy tag values from <u>SRCFILE</u> to <u>FILE</u>.  Tag names on the command line after this option  specify  the
            tags  to  be  copied, or excluded from the copy.  Wildcards are permitted in these tag names.  If no
            tags are specified, then all possible tags (see note 1 below) from the source  file  are  copied  to
            same-named  tags in the preferred location of the output file (the same as specifying "-all").  More
            than one <b>-tagsFromFile</b> option may be used to copy tags from multiple files.

            By default, this option will update any existing and writable same-named tags in  the  output  <u>FILE</u>,
            but  will  create  new  tags  only  in  their  preferred groups.  This allows some information to be
            automatically transferred to the appropriate group when copying between images of different formats.
            However, if a group name is specified for a tag then the information is written only to  this  group
            (unless  redirected  to  another  group,  see  below).   If  "All" is used as a group name, then the
            specified tag(s) are written to the same family 1 group they had in the source file  (ie.  the  same
            specific  location,  like  ExifIFD  or  XMP-dc).   For  example, the common operation of copying all
            writable tags to the same specific locations in the output <u>FILE</u> is achieved by adding "-all:all".  A
            different family may be specified by  adding  a  leading  family  number  to  the  group  name  (eg.
            "-0all:all" preserves the same general location, like EXIF or XMP).

            <u>SRCFILE</u>  may be the same as <u>FILE</u> to move information around within a single file.  In this case, "@"
            may be used to represent the source file (ie. "-tagsFromFile @"), permitting this feature to be used
            for batch processing multiple files.  Specified tags are then copied from each file in turn as it is
            rewritten.  For advanced batch use, the source file name may also be specified using a <u>FMT</u> string in
            which %d, %f and %e represent the directory, file name and extension of <u>FILE</u>.  (eg. the current <u>FILE</u>
            would be represented by "%d%f.%e", with the same effect as "@").  See the <b>-w</b> option for  <u>FMT</u>  string
            examples.

            A  powerful  redirection feature allows a destination tag to be specified for each copied tag.  With
            this feature, information may be written to a tag with a different name  or  group.   This  is  done
            using  "'-<u>DSTTAG</u>&lt;<u>SRCTAG</u>'"  or "'-<u>SRCTAG</u>&gt;<u>DSTTAG</u>'" on the command line after <b>-tagsFromFile</b>, and causes
            the value of <u>SRCTAG</u> to be copied from <u>SRCFILE</u> and written to <u>DSTTAG</u> in <u>FILE</u>.  Has no  effect  unless
            <u>SRCTAG</u>  exists in <u>SRCFILE</u>.  Note that this argument must be quoted to prevent shell redirection, and
            there is no "=" sign as when assigning new values.  Source and/or destination tags may  be  prefixed
            by  a  group  name and/or suffixed by "#".  Wildcards are allowed in both the source and destination
            tag names.  A destination group and/or tag name of "All" or "*" writes to the same  family  1  group
            and/or  tag  name  as  the source (but the family may be specified by adding a leading number to the
            group name, eg. "0All" writes to the same family 0 group as the source).  If no destination group is
            specified, the information is written to the preferred group.  Whitespace around the "&gt;" or  "&lt;"  is
            ignored.  As a convenience, "-tagsFromFile @" is assumed for any redirected tags which are specified
            without a prior <b>-tagsFromFile</b> option.  Copied tags may also be added or deleted  from  a  list  with
            arguments of the form "'-<u>SRCTAG</u>+&lt;<u>DSTTAG</u>'" or "'-<u>SRCTAG</u>-&lt;<u>DSTTAG</u>'" (but see Note 5 below).

            An  extension  of the redirection feature allows strings involving tag names to be used on the right
            hand side of the "&lt;" symbol with the syntax "'-<u>DSTTAG</u>&lt;<u>STR</u>'", where tag names  in  <u>STR</u>  are  prefixed
            with a "$" symbol.  See the <b>-p</b> option and the "Advanced formatting feature" section for more details
            about  this  syntax.   Strings  starting with a "=" sign must insert a single space after the "&lt;" to
            avoid confusion with the "&lt;=" operator which sets the tag value from the  contents  of  a  file.   A
            single  space  at  the  start of the string is removed if it exists, but all other whitespace in the
            string is preserved.  See note 8 below about using the redirection  feature  with  list-type  stags,
            shortcuts or when using wildcards in tag names.

            See "COPYING EXAMPLES" for examples using <b>-tagsFromFile</b>.

            Notes:

            1)  Some  tags (generally tags which may affect the appearance of the image) are considered "Unsafe"
            to write, and are only copied if  specified  explicitly  (ie.  no  wildcards).   See  the  tag  name
            documentation for more details about "Unsafe" tags.

            2)  Be aware of the difference between excluding a tag from being copied (--<u>TAG</u>), and deleting a tag
            (-<u>TAG</u>=).  Excluding a tag prevents it from being copied to the destination image, but deleting  will
            remove a pre-existing tag from the image.

            3)  The  maker note information is copied as a block, so it isn't affected like other information by
            subsequent tag assignments on the command line, and individual makernote tags may  not  be  excluded
            from  a  block  copy.   Also,  since  the PreviewImage referenced from the maker notes may be rather
            large, it is not copied, and must be transferred separately if desired.

            4) The order of operations is to copy all specified tags at the point of the <b>-tagsFromFile</b> option in
            the command line.  Any tag assignment to the right of the <b>-tagsFromFile</b> option  is  made  after  all
            tags  are  copied.   For example, new tag values are set in the order One, Two, Three then Four with
            this command:

                exiftool -One=1 -tagsFromFile s.jpg -Two -Four=4 -Three d.jpg

            This is significant in the case where an overlap exists between the copied and assigned tags because
            later operations may override earlier ones.

            5) The normal behaviour of copied tags differs from that of assigned tags  for  list-type  tags  and
            conditional  replacements  because  each  copy operation on a tag overrides any previous operations.
            While this avoids duplicate list items when copying groups of tags from a file containing  redundant
            information,  it  also  prevents  values of different tags from being copied into the same list when
            this is the intent.  To accumulate values from different operations into the same list,  add  a  "+"
            after the initial "-" of the argument.  For example:

                exiftool -tagsfromfile @ '-subject&lt;make' '-+subject&lt;model' ...

            Similarly,  "-+DSTTAG" must be used when conditionally replacing a tag to prevent overriding earlier
            conditions.

            6) The <b>-a</b> option (allow duplicate tags) is always in effect when copying tags from <u>SRCFILE</u>, but  the
            highest priority tag is always copied last so it takes precedence.

            7) Structured tags are copied by default when copying tags.  See the <b>-struct</b> option for details.

            8) With the redirection feature, copying a tag directly (ie.  "'-<u>DSTTAG</u>&lt;<u>SRCTAG</u>'") is not the same as
            interpolating  its  value  inside a string (ie. "'-<u>DSTTAG</u>&lt;$<u>SRCTAG</u>'") for source tags which are list-
            type tags, shortcut tags, or tag names containing wildcards.  When copying directly, the  values  of
            each  matching  source  tag are copied individually to the destination tag (as if they were separate
            assignments).  However, when interpolated inside a string, list items and  the  values  of  shortcut
            tags  are  concatenated  (with  a  separator  set  by  the  <b>-sep</b>  option),  and  wildcards  are  not
            allowed.Another difference is that a minor  warning  is  generated  if  a  tag  doesn't  exist  when
            interpolating its value in a string (with "$"), but isn't when copying the tag directly.

            Finally,  the behaviour is different when a destination tag or group of "All" is used.  When copying
            directly, a destination group and/or tag name of "All" writes to the same family 1 group and/or  tag
            name as the source.  But when interpolated in a string, the identity of the source tags are lost and
            the  value is written to all possible groups/tags.  For example, the string form must be used in the
            following command since the intent is  to  set  the  value  of  all  existing  date/time  tags  from
            "CreateDate":

                exiftool '-time:all&lt;$createdate' -wm w FILE

       <b>-x</b> <u>TAG</u> (<b>-exclude</b>)
            Exclude  the specified tag.  There may be multiple <b>-x</b> options.  This has the same effect as --<u>TAG</u> on
            the command line.  See the --<u>TAG</u> documentation above for a complete description.

       <u>Input-output</u> <u>text</u> <u>formatting</u>

       Note that trailing spaces are removed from extracted values for most output text formats.  The exceptions
       are <b>-b</b>, <b>-csv</b>, <b>-j</b> and <b>-X</b>.

       <b>-args</b> (<b>-argFormat</b>)
            Output information in the form of exiftool arguments, suitable for  use  with  the  <b>-@</b>  option  when
            writing.   May  be  combined with the <b>-G</b> option to include group names.  This feature may be used to
            effectively copy tags between images,  but  allows  the  metadata  to  be  altered  by  editing  the
            intermediate file ("out.args" in this example):

                exiftool -args -G1 --filename --directory src.jpg &gt; out.args
                exiftool -@ out.args -sep ', ' dst.jpg

            Note:   Be careful when copying information with this technique since it is easy to write tags which
            are normally considered "Unsafe".  For instance, the FileName and Directory tags are excluded in the
            example above to avoid renaming and moving the destination file.  Also note that the second  command
            above will produce warning messages for any tags which are not writable.

            As  well,  the  <b>-sep</b>  option should be used as in the second command above to maintain separate list
            items when writing metadata back to image files, and the <b>-struct</b> option may be used when  extracting
            to preserve structured XMP information.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--b</b> (<b>-binary</b>, <b>--binary</b>)
            Output  requested metadata in binary format without tag names or descriptions (<b>-b</b> or <b>-binary</b>).  This
            option is mainly used for extracting embedded images or other binary data, but it may also be useful
            for some text strings since control characters (such as newlines) are not replaced by  '.'  as  they
            are  in  the  default output.  By default, list items are separated by a newline when extracted with
            the <b>-b</b> option, but this may be changed (see the <b>-sep</b> option for details).  May be combined with  <b>-j</b>,
            <b>-php</b>  or  <b>-X</b>  to extract binary data in JSON, PHP or XML format, but note that "Unsafe" tags are not
            extracted as binary unless they are specified explicitly or the API RequestAll option is set to 3 or
            higher.

            With a leading double dash (<b>--b</b> or <b>--binary</b>), tags which contain binary data are suppressed  in  the
            output when reading.

       <b>-c</b> <u>FMT</u> (<b>-coordFormat</b>)
            Set  the  print  format  for GPS coordinates.  <u>FMT</u> uses the same syntax as a "printf" format string.
            The specifiers correspond to degrees, minutes and seconds in that order, but minutes and seconds are
            optional.  For example, the following table gives the output for the same coordinate  using  various
            formats:

                        FMT                  Output
                -------------------    ------------------
                "%d deg %d' %.2f"\"    54 deg 59' 22.80"  (default for reading)
                "%d %d %.8f"           54 59 22.80000000  (default for copying)
                "%d deg %.4f min"      54 deg 59.3800 min
                "%.6f degrees"         54.989667 degrees

            Notes:

            1)  To  avoid  loss of precision, the default coordinate format is different when copying tags using
            the <b>-tagsFromFile</b> option.

            2) If the hemisphere is known, a reference direction (N, S, E or W)  is  appended  to  each  printed
            coordinate, but adding a "+" or "-" to the format specifier (eg. "%+.6f" or "%-.6f") prints a signed
            coordinate instead.  ("+" adds a leading "+" for positive coordinates, but "-" does not.)

            3) This print formatting may be disabled with the <b>-n</b> option to extract coordinates as signed decimal
            degrees.

       <b>-charset</b> [[<u>TYPE</u>=]<u>CHARSET</u>]
            If  <u>TYPE</u> is "ExifTool" or not specified, this option sets the ExifTool character encoding for output
            tag values when reading and input values when writing, with a default of "UTF8".  If no  <u>CHARSET</u>  is
            given, a list of available character sets is returned.  Valid <u>CHARSET</u> values are:

       <b>-csv</b>[[+]=<u>CSVFILE</u>]
            Export  information  in  CSV format, or import information if <u>CSVFILE</u> is specified.  When importing,
            the CSV file must be in exactly the same format as the exported file.  The first row of the  <u>CSVFILE</u>
            must  be  the ExifTool tag names (with optional group names) for each column of the file, and values
            must be separated by commas.  A special "SourceFile" column specifies the files associated with each
            row of information (and a SourceFile of "*" may be used to define default tags to  be  imported  for
            all  files  which  are  combined with any tags specified for the specific SourceFile processed). The
            <b>-csvDelim</b> option may be used to change the input/output field delimiter if something  other  than  a
            comma is required.

            The following examples demonstrate basic use of the <b>-csv</b> option:

                # generate CSV file with common tags from all images in a directory
                exiftool -common -csv dir &gt; out.csv

                # update metadata for all images in a directory from CSV file
                exiftool -csv=a.csv dir

            When importing, empty values are ignored unless the <b>-f</b> option is used and the API MissingTagValue is
            set to an empty string (in which case the tag is deleted).  Also, FileName and Directory columns are
            ignored if they exist (ie. ExifTool will not attempt to write these tags with a CSV import), but all
            other  columns  are  imported.  To force a tag to be deleted, use the <b>-f</b> option and set the value to
            "-" in the CSV file (or to the MissingTagValue if this API option was used).  Multiple databases may
            be imported in a single command.  Specific tags may be imported from the  database  by  adding  <b>-</b><u>TAG</u>
            options  to  the command, or excluded with <b>--</b><u>TAG</u> options.  If no tags are specified, then all except
            FileName and Directory are used.

            When exporting a CSV file, the <b>-g</b> or <b>-G</b> option adds group names to the  tag  headings.   If  the  <b>-a</b>
            option  is used to allow duplicate tag names, the duplicate tags are only included in the CSV output
            if the column headings are unique.  Adding the <b>-G4</b> option ensures a unique column heading  for  each
            tag.  The <b>-b</b> option may be added to output binary data, encoded in base64 if necessary (indicated by
            ASCII  "base64:"  as  the  first 7 bytes of the value).  Values may also be encoded in base64 if the
            <b>-charset</b> option is used and the value contains invalid characters.

            When exporting specific tags, the CSV columns are arranged in the same order as the  specified  tags
            provided the column headings exactly match the specified tag names, otherwise the columns are sorted
            in alphabetical order.

            When  importing  from a CSV file, only files specified on the command line are processed.  Any extra
            entries in the CSV file are ignored.

            List-type tags are stored as simple strings in a CSV file, but the <b>-sep</b> option may be used to  split
            them back into separate items when importing.

            Special feature:  <b>-csv</b>+=<u>CSVFILE</u> may be used to add items to existing lists.  This affects only list-
            type tags.  Also applies to the <b>-j</b> option.

            Note  that  this  option  is fundamentally different than all other output format options because it
            requires information from all input files to be buffered in memory before  the  output  is  written.
            This may result in excessive memory usage when processing a very large number of files with a single
            command.   Also,  it  makes  this option incompatible with the <b>-w</b> and <b>-W</b> options.  When processing a
            large number of files, it is recommended to either use the JSON (<b>-j</b>) or XML (<b>-X</b>) output  format,  or
            use <b>-p</b> to generate a fixed-column CSV file instead of using the <b>-csv</b> option.

       <b>-csvDelim</b> <u>STR</u>
            Set the delimiter for separating CSV entries for CSV file input/output via the <b>-csv</b> option.  <u>STR</u> may
            contain  "\t", "\n", "\r" and "\\" to represent TAB, LF, CR and '\' respectively.  A double quote is
            not allowed in the delimiter.  Default is ','.

       <b>-d</b> <u>FMT</u> (<b>-dateFormat</b>)
            Set the format for date/time tag values.  The <u>FMT</u> string may contain formatting codes beginning with
            a percent character ("%") to represent the  various  components  of  a  date/time  value.   ExifTool
            implements  3  format  codes  internally (see below), but other format codes are system dependent --
            consult the "strftime" man page on your system for details.  The default  format  is  equivalent  to
            "%Y:%m:%d  %H:%M:%S".   This  option  has  no  effect  on  date-only  or  time-only  tags.  Requires
            POSIX::strptime or Time::Piece for the inversion conversion when writing.  Only one <b>-d</b> option may be
            used per command.

            Additional format codes implemented internally by ExifTool:

            1) %z represents the time zone in "+/-HHMM"  format.   Adding  a  colon  (ie.   %:z)  adds  a  colon
            separator  (eg.  "-05:00").   If  the  date/time value doesn't contain a time zone then %z gives the
            system time zone for the specified date/time value.

            2) %f represents fractional seconds, and supports an optional width to specify the number of  digits
            after  the  decimal point (eg. %3f would give something like ".437").  Adding a minus sign drops the
            decimal point (eg.  "%-3f" would give "437").

            3) %s represents the number of seconds since  00:00  UTC  Jan  1,  1970,  taking  into  account  the
            specified time zone (or system time zone if not specified).

       <b>-D</b> (<b>-decimal</b>)
            Show tag ID number in decimal when extracting information.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>-ex</b>, <b>-ec</b> (<b>-escapeHTML</b>, <b>-escapeXML</b>, <b>-escapeC</b>)
            Escape  characters  in  output  tag  values  for  HTML  (<b>-E</b>),  XML  (<b>-ex</b>) or C (<b>-ec</b>).  For HTML, all
            characters with Unicode code points above U+007F are escaped as well as the following 5  characters:
            &amp; (&amp;amp;) ' (&amp;#39;) " (&amp;quot;) &gt; (&amp;gt;) and &lt; (&amp;lt;).  For XML, only these 5 characters are escaped.
            The <b>-E</b> option is implied with <b>-h</b>, and <b>-ex</b> is implied with <b>-X</b>.  For C, all control characters and the
            backslash are escaped.  The inverse conversion is applied when writing tags.

       <b>-f</b> (<b>-forcePrint</b>)
            Force  printing  of  tags  even  if  they don't exist.  This option applies to tags specified on the
            command line, or with the <b>-p</b>, <b>-if</b> or <b>-tagsFromFile</b> options.  When <b>-f</b>  is  used,  the  value  of  any
            missing  tag  is  set  to  a  dash  ("-")  by  default,  but  this  may  be  configured  via the API
            MissingTagValue option.  <b>-f</b> is also used to add a 'flags' attribute to  the  <b>-listx</b>  output,  or  to
            allow tags to be deleted when writing with the <b>-csv</b>=<u>CSVFILE</u> feature.

       <b>-g</b>[<u>NUM</u>][:<u>NUM</u>...] (<b>-groupHeadings</b>)
            Organize output by tag group.  <u>NUM</u> specifies a group family number, and may be 0 (general location),
            1  (specific location), 2 (category), 3 (document number), 4 (instance number), 5 (metadata path), 6
            (EXIF/TIFF format), 7 (tag ID) or 8 (file number).  <b>-g0</b>  is  assumed  if  a  family  number  is  not
            specified.   May be combined with other options to add group names to the output.  Multiple families
            may be specified by separating them with colons.  By default the resulting group name is  simplified
            by  removing  any  leading  "Main:"  and  collapsing adjacent identical group names, but this can be
            avoided by placing a colon before the first family number (eg.  <b>-g:3:1</b>).  Use the <b>-listg</b>  option  to
            list  group names for a specified family.  The API SavePath and SaveFormat options are automatically
            enabled if the respective  family  5  or  6  group  names  are  requested.   See  the  API  GetGroup
            documentation for more information.

       <b>-G</b>[<u>NUM</u>][:<u>NUM</u>...] (<b>-groupNames</b>)
            Same  as  <b>-g</b>  but  print  group  name for each tag.  <b>-G0</b> is assumed if <u>NUM</u> is not specified.  May be
            combined with a number of other options to add group names to the output.   Note  that  <u>NUM</u>  may  be
            added wherever <b>-G</b> is mentioned in the documentation.  See the <b>-g</b> option above for details.

       <b>-h</b> (<b>-htmlFormat</b>)
            Use  HTML  table  formatting for output.  Implies the <b>-E</b> option.  The formatting options <b>-D</b>, <b>-H</b>, <b>-g</b>,
            <b>-G</b>, <b>-l</b> and <b>-s</b> may be used in combination with <b>-h</b> to influence the HTML format.

       <b>-H</b> (<b>-hex</b>)
            Show tag ID number in hexadecimal when extracting information.

       <b>-htmlDump</b>[<u>OFFSET</u>]
            Generate a dynamic web page containing a hex dump of the EXIF  information.   This  can  be  a  very
            powerful  tool  for low-level analysis of EXIF information.  The <b>-htmlDump</b> option is also invoked if
            the <b>-v</b> and <b>-h</b> options are used together.  The verbose level  controls  the  maximum  length  of  the
            blocks  dumped.  An <u>OFFSET</u> may be given to specify the base for displayed offsets.  If not provided,
            the EXIF/TIFF base offset is used.  Use <b>-htmlDump0</b> for absolute offsets.  Currently  only  EXIF/TIFF
            and  JPEG  information is dumped, but the -u option can be used to give a raw hex dump of other file
            formats.

       <b>-j</b>[[+]=<u>JSONFILE</u>] (<b>-json</b>)
            Use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) formatting for console output, or import JSON file if <u>JSONFILE</u>
            is specified.  This option may be combined with <b>-g</b> to organize the output into objects by group,  or
            <b>-G</b>  to  add  group  names to each tag.  List-type tags with multiple items are output as JSON arrays
            unless <b>-sep</b> is used.  By default XMP structures are flattened  into  individual  tags  in  the  JSON
            output,  but  the  original structure may be preserved with the <b>-struct</b> option (this also causes all
            list-type XMP tags to be output as JSON arrays, otherwise  single-item  lists  would  be  output  as
            simple strings).  The <b>-a</b> option is implied when <b>-json</b> is used, but entries with identical JSON names
            are suppressed in the output.  (<b>-G4</b> may be used to ensure that all tags have unique JSON names.)

            Adding the <b>-D</b> or <b>-H</b> option changes tag values to JSON objects with "val" and "id" fields.  Adding <b>-l</b>
            adds a "desc" field, and a "num" field if the numerical value is different from the converted "val",
            and  "fmt"  and  "hex"  fields  for  EXIF metadata if the API SaveFormat and SaveBin options are set
            respectively, and the length of the "hex" output is limited by the API LimitLongValues setting.  The
            <b>-b</b> option may be added to output binary data, encoded in base64 if  necessary  (indicated  by  ASCII
            "base64:"  as  the first 7 bytes of the value), and <b>-t</b> may be added to include tag table information
            (see <b>-t</b> for details).  The JSON output is UTF-8 regardless of any <b>-L</b> or <b>-charset</b> option setting, but
            the UTF-8 validation is disabled if a character set other than UTF-8 is specified.

            Note that ExifTool quotes JSON values only if they  don't  look  like  numbers  (regardless  of  the
            original storage format or the relevant metadata specification).  This may be a problem when reading
            the  JSON via a strongly typed language.  However, the API StructFormat option may be set to "JSONQ"
            to force quoting of numbers.  As well, the <b>-sep</b> option may be used to convert arrays  into  strings.
            For example:

                exiftool -j -api structformat=jsonq -sep ", " ...

            If <u>JSONFILE</u> is specified, the file is imported and the tag definitions from the file are used to set
            tag  values  on a per-file basis.  The special "SourceFile" entry in each JSON object associates the
            information with a specific target file.  An object with a missing SourceFile or a SourceFile of "*"
            defines default tags for all target files which  are  combined  with  any  tags  specified  for  the
            specific  SourceFile  processed.   The  imported JSON file must have the same format as the exported
            JSON files with the exception that options exporting JSON objects instead of simple values  are  not
            compatible with the import file format (ie. export with <b>-D</b>, <b>-H</b>, <b>-l</b>, or <b>-T</b> is not compatible, and use
            <b>-G</b>  instead  of  <b>-g</b>).   Additionally, tag names in the input JSON file may be suffixed with a "#" to
            disable print conversion.  Specific tags may be imported from the database by adding <b>-</b><u>TAG</u> options to
            the command, or excluded with <b>--</b><u>TAG</u> options.  If no tags are specified, then all except FileName and
            Directory are used.

            Unlike CSV import, empty values are not ignored, and will cause an empty  value  to  be  written  if
            supported  by  the  specific metadata type.  Tags are deleted by using the <b>-f</b> option and setting the
            tag value to "-" (or to the MissingTagValue setting if this API option was  used).   Importing  with
            <b>-j</b>+=<u>JSONFILE</u> causes new values to be added to existing lists.

       <b>-l</b> (<b>-long</b>)
            Use  long  2-line  Canon-style  output  format.   Adds a description and unconverted value (if it is
            different from the converted value) to the XML, JSON or PHP output when <b>-X</b>, <b>-j</b> or <b>-php</b> is used.  May
            also be combined with <b>-listf</b>, <b>-listr</b> or <b>-listwf</b> to add descriptions of the file types.

       <b>-L</b> (<b>-latin</b>)
            Use Windows Latin1 encoding (cp1252) for output tag values  instead  of  the  default  UTF-8.   When
            writing,  <b>-L</b>  specifies that input text values are Latin1 instead of UTF-8.  Equivalent to "-charset
            latin".

       <b>-lang</b> [<u>LANG</u>]
            Set current language for tag descriptions and converted values.  <u>LANG</u> is "de", "fr", "ja", etc.  Use
            <b>-lang</b> with no other arguments to get a list of available languages.  The default language is "en" if
            <b>-lang</b> is not specified.  Note that tag/group names are always  English,  independent  of  the  <b>-lang</b>
            setting,  and  translation  of  warning/error  messages  has  not yet been implemented.  May also be
            combined with <b>-listx</b> to output descriptions in one language only.

            By default, ExifTool uses UTF-8 encoding for special characters, but the <b>-L</b> or <b>-charset</b>  option  may
            be  used to invoke other encodings.  Note that ExifTool uses Unicode::LineBreak if available to help
            preserve the column alignment of the plain text output for languages with a variable-width character
            set.

            Currently, the language support is not complete, but users are  welcome  to  help  improve  this  by
            submitting  their own translations.  To submit a translation, follow these steps (you must have Perl
            installed for this):

            1. Download and unpack the latest Image-ExifTool full distribution.

            2. 'cd' into the Image-ExifTool directory.

            3. Run this command to make an XML file of the desired tags (eg. EXIF):

               ./exiftool -listx -exif:all &gt; out.xml

            4. Copy this text into a file called 'import.pl' in the exiftool directory:

                push @INC, 'lib';
                require Image::ExifTool::TagInfoXML;
                my $file = shift or die "Expected XML file name\n";
                $Image::ExifTool::TagInfoXML::makeMissing = shift;
                Image::ExifTool::TagInfoXML::BuildLangModules($file,8);

            5. Run the 'import.pl' script to Import the XML file, generating  the  'MISSING'  entries  for  your
            language (eg. Russian):

               perl import.pl out.xml ru

            6.  Edit  the  generated  language  module lib/Image/ExifTool/Lang/ru.pm, and search and replace all
            'MISSING' strings in the file with your translations.

            7. Email the module ('ru.pm' in this example) to philharvey66 at gmail.com

            8. Thank you!!

       <b>-listItem</b> <u>INDEX</u>
            For list-type tags, this causes only the item with the specified index to be extracted.  <u>INDEX</u> is  0
            for  the  first item in the list.  Negative indices may also be used to reference items from the end
            of the list.  Has no effect on single-valued tags.  Also applies to tag values when copying  from  a
            tag, and in <b>-if</b> conditions.

       <b>-n</b> (<b>--printConv</b>)
            Disable  print conversion for all tags.  By default, extracted values are converted to a more human-
            readable format, but the <b>-n</b> option disables this conversion, revealing the machine-readable  values.
            For example:

                &gt; exiftool -Orientation -S a.jpg
                Orientation: Rotate 90 CW
                &gt; exiftool -Orientation -S -n a.jpg
                Orientation: 6

            The  print  conversion  may also be disabled on a per-tag basis by suffixing the tag name with a "#"
            character:

                &gt; exiftool -Orientation# -Orientation -S a.jpg
                Orientation: 6
                Orientation: Rotate 90 CW

            These techniques may also be used to  disable  the  inverse  print  conversion  when  writing.   For
            example, the following commands all have the same effect:

                &gt; exiftool -Orientation='Rotate 90 CW' a.jpg
                &gt; exiftool -Orientation=6 -n a.jpg
                &gt; exiftool -Orientation#=6 a.jpg

       <b>-p</b>[-] <u>STR</u> or <u>FMTFILE</u> (<b>-printFormat</b>)
            Print  output in the format specified by the given string or file.  The argument is interpreted as a
            string unless a file of that name exists, in which case the string is loaded from  the  contents  of
            the  file.   Tag  names in the format string or file begin with a "$" symbol and may contain leading
            group names and/or a trailing "#" (to disable print conversion).  Case is not  significant.   Braces
            "{}"  may  be  used  around  the  tag  name to separate it from subsequent text (and must be used if
            subsequent text begins with an alphanumeric character, hyphen, underline,  colon  or  number  sign).
            Use $$ to represent a "$" symbol, and $/ for a newline.  When the string argument is used (ie. <u>STR</u>),
            a newline is added to the end of the string unless <b>-p-</b> is specified or the <b>-b</b> option is used.

            Multiple <b>-p</b> options may be used.  Lines beginning with "#[HEAD]" and "#[TAIL]" are output before the
            first processed file and after the last processed file respectively.  Lines beginning with "#[SECT]"
            and "#[ENDS]" are output before and after each section of files.  A section is defined as a group of
            consecutive  files  with  the  same  section header (eg. files are grouped by directory if "#[SECT]"
            contains $directory).  Lines beginning with "#[BODY]" and lines not beginning with  "#"  are  output
            for  each  processed  file.   Lines  beginning  with  "#[IF]" are not output, but all BODY lines are
            skipped if any tag on an IF line doesn't exist.  Other lines beginning with "#"  are  ignored.   (To
            output a line beginning with "#", use "#[BODY]#".) For example, this format file:

                # this is a comment line
                #[HEAD]-- Generated by ExifTool $exifToolVersion --
                File: $FileName - $DateTimeOriginal
                (f/$Aperture, ${ShutterSpeed}s, ISO $EXIF:ISO)
                #[TAIL]-- end --

            with this command:

                exiftool -p test.fmt a.jpg b.jpg

            produces output like this:

                -- Generated by ExifTool 13.10 --
                File: a.jpg - 2003:10:31 15:44:19
                (f/5.6, 1/60s, ISO 100)
                File: b.jpg - 2006:05:23 11:57:38
                (f/8.0, 1/13s, ISO 100)
                -- end --

            The  values  of  List-type  tags  with multiple items, Shortcut tags representing multiple tags, and
            matching tags when the "All" group is specified are joined according the <b>-sep</b>  option  setting  when
            interpolated  in  the  string.   (Note  that  when  "All" is used as a group name, dupicate tags are
            included regardless of the Duplicates option setting.)  When "All" is used as a tag name, a value of
            1 is returned if any tag exists in the specified group, or 0 otherwise (unless the  "All"  group  is
            also specified, in which case the values of all matching tags are joined).

            The <b>-p</b> output iterates through the family 3 group names, with each sub-document producing additional
            output.   This  feature  is  most  useful  when  used  in combination with the <b>-ee</b> option to extract
            embedded documents.

            If a specified tag does not exist, a minor warning is issued and the line with the  missing  tag  is
            not  printed.   However, the <b>-f</b> option may be used to set the value of missing tags to '-' (but this
            may be configured via the API MissingTagValue option), or the <b>-m</b> option may be used to ignore  minor
            warnings  and  leave  the missing values empty.  Alternatively, <b>-q</b> <b>-q</b> may be used to simply suppress
            the warning messages.

            The "Advanced formatting feature" may be used to modify the values of individual tags within the  <b>-p</b>
            option string.

            Note  that  the API RequestTags option is automatically set for all tags used in the <u>FMTFILE</u> or <u>STR</u>.
            This allows all other tags to be ignored using <b>-API</b>  <b>IgnoreTags=all</b>,  resulting  in  reduced  memory
            usage and increased speed.

       <b>-php</b> Format  output  as a PHP Array.  The <b>-g</b>, <b>-G</b>, <b>-D</b>, <b>-H</b>, <b>-l</b>, <b>-sep</b> and <b>-struct</b> options combine with <b>-php</b>,
            and duplicate tags are handled in the same way as with the <b>-json</b> option.  As well, the <b>-b</b> option may
            be added to output binary data, and <b>-t</b> may be added to include tag table  information  (see  <b>-t</b>  for
            details).  Here is a simple example showing how this could be used in a PHP script:

                &lt;?php
                eval('$array=' . `exiftool -php -q image.jpg`);
                print_r($array);
                ?&gt;

       <b>-s</b>[<u>NUM</u>] (<b>-short</b>)
            Short  output  format.  Prints tag names instead of descriptions.  Add <u>NUM</u> or up to 3 <b>-s</b> options for
            even shorter formats:

                -s1 or -s        - print tag names instead of descriptions
                -s2 or -s -s     - no extra spaces to column-align values
                -s3 or -s -s -s  - print values only (no tag names)

            Also effective when combined with <b>-t</b>, <b>-h</b>, <b>-X</b> or <b>-listx</b> options.

       <b>-S</b> (<b>-veryShort</b>)
            Very short format.  The same  as  <b>-s2</b>  or  two  <b>-s</b>  options.   Tag  names  are  printed  instead  of
            descriptions, and no extra spaces are added to column-align values.

       <b>-sep</b> <u>STR</u> (<b>-separator</b>)
            Specify  separator  string  for  items in list-type tags.  When reading, the default is to join list
            items with ", ".  When writing, this option causes values assigned to list-type  tags  to  be  split
            into  individual  items  at  each  substring matching <u>STR</u> (otherwise they are not split by default).
            Space characters in <u>STR</u> match zero or more whitespace characters in the value.

            Note that an empty separator ("") is allowed, and will join items with no separator when reading, or
            split the value into individual characters when writing.

            For pure binary output (<b>-b</b> used without <b>-j</b>, <b>-php</b> or <b>-X</b>), the first <b>-sep</b> option specifies a list-item
            separator, and a second <b>-sep</b> option specifies a terminator for the end of the list  (or  after  each
            value  if  not  a  list).  In these strings, "\n", "\r" and "\t" may be used to represent a newline,
            carriage return and tab respectively.  By default, binary list items are separated by a newline, and
            no terminator is added.

       <b>-sort</b>, <b>--sort</b>
            Sort output by tag description, or by  tag  name  if  the  <b>-s</b>  option  is  used.   When  sorting  by
            description, the sort order will depend on the <b>-lang</b> option setting.  Without the <b>-sort</b> option, tags
            appear  in  the  order  they were specified on the command line, or if not specified, the order they
            were extracted from the file.  By default, tags are organized by groups when combined with the <b>-g</b> or
            <b>-G</b> option, but this grouping may be disabled with <b>--sort</b>.

       <b>-struct</b>, <b>--struct</b>
            Output structured XMP information instead of flattening to individual tags.  This option works  well
            when  combined  with  the  XML  (<b>-X</b>)  and  JSON  (<b>-j</b>) output formats.  For other output formats, XMP
            structures and lists are serialized into the same format as when writing structured information (see
            &lt;https://exiftool.org/struct.html&gt; for details).   When  copying,  structured  tags  are  copied  by
            default unless <b>--struct</b> is used to disable this feature (although flattened tags may still be copied
            by  specifying  them  individually  unless  <b>-struct</b>  is  used).   These  options have no effect when
            assigning new values since both flattened and structured tags may always be used when writing.

       <b>-t</b> (<b>-tab</b>)
            Output a tab-delimited list of description/values (useful for database  import).   May  be  combined
            with <b>-s</b> to print tag names instead of descriptions, or <b>-S</b> to print tag values only, tab-delimited on
            a  single  line.   The  <b>-t</b>  option  may be combined with <b>-j</b>, <b>-php</b> or <b>-X</b> to add tag table information
            ("table", tag "id", and "index" for cases where multiple conditional tags exist with the  same  ID),
            which allows the corresponding tag to be located in the <b>-listx</b> output.

       <b>-T</b> (<b>-table</b>)
            Output tag values in table form.  Equivalent to <b>-t</b> <b>-S</b> <b>-q</b> <b>-f</b>.

       <b>-v</b>[<u>NUM</u>] (<b>-verbose</b>)
            Print  verbose messages.  <u>NUM</u> specifies the level of verbosity in the range 0-5, with higher numbers
            being more verbose.  If <u>NUM</u> is not given, then each <b>-v</b> option increases the level of verbosity by 1.
            With any level greater than 0,  most  other  options  are  ignored  and  normal  console  output  is
            suppressed  unless  specific  tags  are extracted.  Using <b>-v0</b> causes the console output buffer to be
            flushed after each line (which may be useful to avoid  delays  when  piping  exiftool  output),  and
            prints  the  name of each processed file when writing and the new file name when renaming, moving or
            copying.  Verbose levels above <b>-v0</b> do not flush after each line.  Also see the <b>-progress</b> option.

       <b>-w</b>[+|!] <u>EXT</u> or <u>FMT</u> (<b>-textOut</b>)
            Write console output to files with names ending in <u>EXT</u>, one for each source file.  The  output  file
            name  is  obtained  by  replacing  the  source file extension (including the '.') with the specified
            extension (and  a  '.'  is  added  to  the  start  of  <u>EXT</u>  if  it  doesn't  already  contain  one).
            Alternatively,  a  <u>FMT</u>  string  may  be  used  to  give  more  control over the output file name and
            directory.  In the format string, %d, %f and %e represent the directory, filename and  extension  of
            the  source  file,  and  %c  represents a copy number which is automatically incremented if the file
            already exists.  %d includes the trailing '/' if necessary, but %e does not include the leading '.'.
            For example:

                -w %d%f.txt       # same effect as "-w txt"
                -w dir/%f_%e.out  # write files to "dir" as "FILE_EXT.out"
                -w dir2/%d%f.txt  # write to "dir2", keeping dir structure
                -w a%c.txt        # write to "a.txt" or "a1.txt" or "a2.txt"...

            Existing files will not be changed unless an exclamation point is added to the option name (ie.  <b>-w!</b>
            or <b>-textOut!</b>) to overwrite the file, or a plus sign (ie. <b>-w+</b> or <b>-textOut+</b>) to append to the existing
            file.   Both may be used (ie. <b>-w+!</b> or <b>-textOut+!</b>) to overwrite output files that didn't exist before
            the command was run, and append the output from multiple source files.  For example,  to  write  one
            output file for all source files in each directory:

                exiftool -filename -createdate -T -w+! %d/out.txt -r DIR

            Capitalized format codes %D, %F, %E and %C provide slightly different alternatives to the lower case
            versions.   %D  does  not  include the trailing '/', %F is the full filename including extension, %E
            includes the leading '.', and %C increments the count for each processed file (see below).

            Notes:

            1) In a Windows BAT file the "%" character is represented by "%%", so an argument like "%d%f.txt" is
            written as "%%d%%f.txt".

            2) If the argument for <b>-w</b> does not contain a valid format code (eg. %f), then it is interpreted as a
            file extension, but there are three different ways to create a  single  output  file  from  multiple
            source files:

                # 1. Shell redirection
                exiftool FILE1 FILE2 ... &gt; out.txt

                # 2. With the -w option and a zero-width format code
                exiftool -w+! %0fout.txt FILE1 FILE2 ...

                # 3. With the -W option (see the -W option below)
                exiftool -W+! out.txt FILE1 FILE2 ...

            Advanced features:

            A  substring  of  the  original file name, directory or extension may be taken by specifying a field
            width immediately following the '%' character.  If the width is negative,  the  substring  is  taken
            from  the  end.  The substring position (characters to ignore at the start or end of the string) may
            be given by a second optional value after a decimal point.  For example:

                Input File Name     Format Specifier    Output File Name
                ----------------    ----------------    ----------------
                Picture-123.jpg     %7f.txt             Picture.txt
                Picture-123.jpg     %-.4f.out           Picture.out
                Picture-123.jpg     %7f.%-3f            Picture.123
                Picture-123a.jpg    Meta%-3.1f.txt      Meta123.txt

            (Note that special characters may have a width of greater than one.)

            For %d and %D, the field width/position specifiers may be applied to the directory levels instead of
            substring position by using a colon instead of  a  decimal  point  in  the  format  specifier.   For
            example:

                Source Dir     Format   Result       Notes
                ------------   ------   ----------   ------------------
                pics/2012/02   %2:d     pics/2012/   take top 2 levels
                pics/2012/02   %-:1d    pics/2012/   up one directory level
                pics/2012/02   %:1d     2012/02/     ignore top level
                pics/2012/02   %1:1d    2012/        take 1 level after top
                pics/2012/02   %-1:D    02           bottom level folder name
                /Users/phil    %:2d     phil/        ignore top 2 levels

            (Note  that  the  root  directory  counts  as one level when an absolute path is used as in the last
            example above.)

            For %c, these modifiers have a different effects.  If a field width is given,  the  copy  number  is
            padded  with  zeros to the specified width.  A leading '-' adds a dash before the copy number, and a
            '+' adds an underline.  By default, the copy number is omitted from the first file of a given  name,
            but this can be changed by adding a decimal point to the modifier.  For example:

                -w A%-cZ.txt      # AZ.txt, A-1Z.txt, A-2Z.txt ...
                -w B%5c.txt       # B.txt, B00001.txt, B00002.txt ...
                -w C%.c.txt       # C0.txt, C1.txt, C2.txt ...
                -w D%-.c.txt      # D-0.txt, D-1.txt, D-2.txt ...
                -w E%-.4c.txt     # E-0000.txt, E-0001.txt, E-0002.txt ...
                -w F%-.4nc.txt    # F-0001.txt, F-0002.txt, F-0003.txt ...
                -w G%+c.txt       # G.txt, G_1.txt G_2.txt ...
                -w H%-lc.txt      # H.txt, H-b.txt, H-c.txt ...
                -w I.%.3uc.txt    # I.AAA.txt, I.AAB.txt, I.AAC.txt ...

            A  special  feature  allows  the  copy  number to be incremented for each processed file by using %C
            (upper case) instead of %c.  This allows a sequential number to be added to output file names,  even
            if  the  names  are  different.   For  %C, a copy number of zero is not omitted as it is with %c.  A
            leading '-' causes the number to be reset at the start  of  each  new  directory  (in  the  original
            directory  structure  if  the  files are being moved), and '+' has no effect.  The number before the
            decimal place gives the starting index, the number after the decimal place gives  the  field  width.
            To  preserve  synchronization  with  the  processed  file  number, by default the copy number is not
            incremented to avoid file name collisions, so any existing same-named  file  will  cause  an  error.
            However  using  a  colon  instead  of  a  decimal point causes the number to be incremented to avoid
            collisions with existing files.

            The following examples show the output filenames when  used  with  the  command  "exiftool  rose.jpg
            star.jpg jet.jpg ...":

                -w %C%f.txt       # 0rose.txt, 1star.txt, 2jet.txt
                -w %f-%10C.txt    # rose-10.txt, star-11.txt, jet-12.txt

            All  format codes may be modified by 'l' or 'u' to specify lower or upper case respectively (ie. %le
            for a lower case file extension).  When used to modify %c or %C,  the  numbers  are  changed  to  an
            alphabetical  base  (see  example  H  above).  Also, %c and %C may be modified by 'n' to count using
            natural numbers starting from 1, instead of 0 (see example F above).

            This same <u>FMT</u> syntax is used with the <b>-o</b> and <b>-tagsFromFile</b> options, although  %c  and  %C  are  only
            valid for output file names.

       <b>-W</b>[+|!] <u>FMT</u> (<b>-tagOut</b>)
            This  enhanced  version  of  the  <b>-w</b>  option  allows  a  separate output file to be created for each
            extracted tag.  See the <b>-w</b> option documentation  above  for  details  of  the  basic  functionality.
            Listed here are the differences between <b>-W</b> and <b>-w</b>:

            1) With <b>-W</b>, a new output file is created for each extracted tag.

            2)  <b>-W</b> supports four additional format codes:  %t, %g and %s represent the tag name, group name, and
            suggested extension for the output file (based on the format of the data),  and  %o  represents  the
            value  of the OriginalRawFileName or OriginalFileName tag from the input file (including extension).
            The %g code may be followed by a single  digit  to  specify  the  group  family  number  (eg.  %g1),
            otherwise  family 0 is assumed.  The substring width/position/case specifiers may be used with these
            format codes in exactly the same way as with %f and %e.

            3) The argument for <b>-W</b> is interpreted as a file name if it contains no format codes.  (For <b>-w</b>,  this
            would  be  a  file  extension.)   This change allows a simple file name to be specified, which, when
            combined with the append feature, provides a method to write metadata from multiple source files  to
            a  single  output  file without the need for shell redirection.  For example, the following pairs of
            commands give the same result:

                # overwriting existing text file
                exiftool test.jpg &gt; out.txt     # shell redirection
                exiftool test.jpg -W+! out.txt  # equivalent -W option

                # append to existing text file
                exiftool test.jpg &gt;&gt; out.txt    # shell redirection
                exiftool test.jpg -W+ out.txt   # equivalent -W option

            4) Adding the <b>-v</b> option to <b>-W</b> sends a list of the tags and output file names to the console  instead
            of  giving  a  verbose  dump  of the entire file.  (Unless appending all output to one file for each
            source file by using <b>-W+</b> with an output file <u>FMT</u> that does not contain %t, %g, %s or %o.)

            5) Individual list items are stored in separate files when <b>-W</b> is combined with <b>-b</b>, but note that for
            separate files to be created %c or %C must be used in <u>FMT</u> to give the files unique names.

       <b>-Wext</b> <u>EXT</u>, <b>--Wext</b> <u>EXT</u> (<b>-tagOutExt</b>)
            This option is used to specify the type of output file(s) written by the <b>-W</b> option.  An output  file
            is written only if the suggested extension matches <u>EXT</u>.  Multiple <b>-Wext</b> options may be used to write
            more than one type of file.  Use <b>--Wext</b> to write all but the specified type(s).

       <b>-X</b> (<b>-xmlFormat</b>)
            Use  ExifTool-specific  RDF/XML  formatting for console output.  Implies the <b>-a</b> option, so duplicate
            tags are extracted.  The formatting options <b>-b</b>, <b>-D</b>, <b>-H</b>, <b>-l</b>, <b>-s</b>, <b>-sep</b>, <b>-struct</b> and <b>-t</b> may be used  in
            combination with <b>-X</b> to affect the output, but note that the tag ID (<b>-D</b>, <b>-H</b> and <b>-t</b>), binary data (<b>-b</b>)
            and  structured  output  (<b>-struct</b>)  options  are  not  effective  for the short output (<b>-s</b>). Another
            restriction of <b>-s</b> is that only one tag with a given group and name may appear in the  output.   Note
            that  the  tag  ID options (<b>-D</b>, <b>-H</b> and <b>-t</b>) will produce non-standard RDF/XML unless the <b>-l</b> option is
            also used.

            By default, <b>-X</b> outputs flattened tags, so <b>-struct</b> should  be  added  if  required  to  preserve  XMP
            structures.   List-type tags with multiple values are formatted as an RDF Bag, but they are combined
            into a single string when <b>-s</b> or <b>-sep</b> is used.  Using <b>-L</b> changes the XML  encoding  from  "UTF-8"  to
            "windows-1252".   Other  <b>-charset</b>  settings  change  the  encoding  only if there is a corresponding
            standard XML character set.  The <b>-b</b> option causes binary data  values  to  be  written,  encoded  in
            base64 if necessary.  The <b>-t</b> option adds tag table information to the output (see <b>-t</b> for details).

            Note:   This  output  is  NOT  the  same as XMP because it uses dynamically-generated property names
            corresponding to the ExifTool tag names with ExifTool family 1 group names as  namespaces,  and  not
            the  standard  XMP  properties  and namespaces.  To write XMP instead, use the <b>-o</b> option with an XMP
            extension for the output file.

       <u>Processing</u> <u>control</u>

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--a</b> (<b>-duplicates</b>, <b>--duplicates</b>)
            Allow (<b>-a</b>) or suppress (<b>--a</b>) duplicate tag names to be extracted.  By default,  duplicate  tags  are
            suppressed when reading unless the <b>-ee</b> or <b>-X</b> options are used or the Duplicates option is enabled in
            the  configuration  file.   When  writing, this option allows multiple Warning messages to be shown.
            Duplicate tags are always extracted when copying.

       <b>-e</b> (<b>--composite</b>)
            Extract existing tags only -- don't generate composite tags.

       <b>-ee</b>[<u>NUM</u>] (<b>-extractEmbedded</b>)
            Extract information from embedded documents in EPS files, embedded  EPS  information  and  JPEG  and
            Jpeg2000 images in PDF files, embedded MPF images in JPEG and MPO files, streaming metadata in AVCHD
            videos,  and  the resource fork of Mac OS files.  Implies the <b>-a</b> option.  Use <b>-g3</b> or <b>-G3</b> to identify
            the originating document for extracted information.  Embedded documents containing sub-documents are
            indicated with dashes in the family 3 group name.  (eg. "Doc2-3" is the 3rd sub-document of the  2nd
            embedded document.) Note that this option may increase processing time substantially, especially for
            PDF files with many embedded images or videos with streaming metadata.

            When  used  with <b>-ee</b>, the <b>-p</b> option is evaluated for each embedded document as if it were a separate
            input file.  This allows, for example, generation of GPS track logs from timed metadata  in  videos.
            See &lt;https://exiftool.org/geotag.html#Inverse&gt; for examples.

            Setting  <u>NUM</u>  to  2  causes  the  H264  video  stream  in  MP4  videos  to be parsed until the first
            Supplemental Enhancement Information (SEI) message is decoded, or 3 to parse the entire H624  stream
            and decode all SEI information.  For M2TS videos, a setting of 3 causes the entire file to be parsed
            in search of unlisted programs which may contain timed GPS.

       <b>-ext</b>[+] <u>EXT</u>, <b>--ext</b> <u>EXT</u> (<b>-extension</b>)
            Process only files with (<b>-ext</b>) or without (<b>--ext</b>) a specified extension.  There may be multiple <b>-ext</b>
            and  <b>--ext</b>  options.   A  plus  sign  may be added (ie. <b>-ext+</b>) to add the specified extension to the
            normally processed files.  EXT may begin with  a  leading  '.',  which  is  ignored.   Case  is  not
            significant.   "*"  may be used to process files with any extension (or none at all), as in the last
            three examples:

                exiftool -ext JPG DIR             # process only JPG files
                exiftool --ext cr2 --ext dng DIR  # supported files but CR2/DNG
                exiftool -ext+ txt DIR            # supported files plus TXT
                exiftool -ext "*" DIR             # process all files
                exiftool -ext "*" --ext xml DIR   # process all but XML files
                exiftool -ext "*" --ext . DIR     # all but those with no ext

            Using this option has two main advantages over specifying  "*.<u>EXT</u>"  on  the  command  line:   1)  It
            applies  to  files  in subdirectories when combined with the <b>-r</b> option.  2) The <b>-ext</b> option is case-
            insensitive, which is useful when processing files on case-sensitive filesystems.

            Note that all files specified on the command line will be processed regardless of  extension  unless
            the <b>-ext</b> option is used.

       <b>-F</b>[<u>OFFSET</u>] (<b>-fixBase</b>)
            Fix  the  base for maker notes offsets.  A common problem with some image editors is that offsets in
            the maker notes are not adjusted properly when the file is  modified.   This  may  cause  the  wrong
            values to be extracted for some maker note entries when reading the edited file.  This option allows
            an integer <u>OFFSET</u> to be specified for adjusting the maker notes base offset.  If no <u>OFFSET</u> is given,
            ExifTool  takes  its  best guess at the correct base.  Note that exiftool will automatically fix the
            offsets for images which store original offset information (eg. newer Canon  models).   Offsets  are
            fixed permanently if <b>-F</b> is used when writing EXIF to an image. eg)

                exiftool -F -exif:resolutionunit=inches image.jpg

       <b>-fast</b>[<u>NUM</u>]
            Increase speed of extracting information.  With <b>-fast</b> (or <b>-fast1</b>), ExifTool will not scan to the end
            of  a  JPEG  image  to  check  for an AFCP or PreviewImage trailer, or past the first comment in GIF
            images or the audio/video data in WAV/AVI files to search  for  additional  metadata.   These  speed
            benefits  are  small when reading images directly from disk, but can be substantial if piping images
            through a network connection.  Also bypasses CRC validation when writing PNG  images  which  can  be
            very slow.  For more substantial speed benefits, <b>-fast2</b> also causes exiftool to avoid extracting any
            EXIF MakerNote information, and to stop processing at the IDAT chunk of PNG images and the mdat atom
            of  QuickTime-format  files (but note that some files may store metadata after this).  <b>-fast3</b> avoids
            extracting metadata from the file, and returns only pseudo System tags, but  still  reads  the  file
            header  to  obtain  an  educated  guess  at FileType.  <b>-fast4</b> doesn't even read the file header, and
            returns only System tags and  a  FileType  based  on  the  file  extension.   <b>-fast5</b>  also  disables
            generation of the Composite tags (like <b>-e</b>).  Has no effect when writing.

            Note  that  a separate <b>-fast</b> setting may be used for evaluation of a <b>-if</b> condition, or when ordering
            files with the <b>-fileOrder</b> option.  See the <b>-if</b> and <b>-fileOrder</b> options for details.

       <b>-fileOrder</b>[<u>NUM</u>] [-]<u>TAG</u>
            Set file processing order according to the sorted value of the specified <u>TAG</u>.  Without this  option,
            files are processed in the order returned by the system, which is commonly by file name, but this is
            filesystem dependent.  For example, to process files in order of date:

                exiftool -fileOrder DateTimeOriginal DIR

            Additional <b>-fileOrder</b> options may be added for secondary sort keys.  Numbers are sorted numerically,
            and  all  other  values are sorted alphabetically.  Files missing the specified tag are sorted last.
            The sort order may be reversed by prefixing the tag name with a "-" (eg.  "-fileOrder -createdate").
            Print conversion of the sorted values is disabled with the <b>-n</b> option, or a "#" appended to  the  tag
            name.   Other  formatting  options  (eg.  <b>-d</b>)  have  no  effect on the sorted values.  Note that the
            <b>-fileOrder</b> option can incur large performance  penalty  since  it  involves  an  additional  initial
            processing  pass of all files, but this impact may be reduced by specifying a <u>NUM</u> to effectively set
            the <b>-fast</b> level for the initial pass.  For example, <b>-fileOrder4</b> may be  used  if  <u>TAG</u>  is  a  pseudo
            System  tag.   If  multiple  <b>-fileOrder</b> options are used, the extraction is done at the lowest <b>-fast</b>
            level.  Note that files are sorted across directory boundaries if  multiple  input  directories  are
            specified.

       <b>-i</b> <u>DIR</u> (<b>-ignore</b>)
            Ignore specified directory name.  <u>DIR</u> may be either an individual folder name, or a full path.  If a
            full  path  is  specified,  it  must match the Directory tag exactly to be ignored.  Use multiple <b>-i</b>
            options to ignore more than one directory name.  A special <u>DIR</u> value of "SYMLINKS" (case  sensitive)
            may  be specified to avoid recursing into directories which are symbolic links when the <b>-r</b> option is
            used.  As well, a value of "HIDDEN" (case sensitive) may be used to ignore  files  with  names  that
            start with a "." (ie. hidden files on Unix systems) when scanning a directory.

       <b>-if</b>[<u>NUM</u>] <u>EXPR</u>
            Specify  a  condition  to  be  evaluated  before  processing  each  <u>FILE</u>.  <u>EXPR</u> is a Perl-like logic
            expression containing tag names prefixed by "$" symbols.  It is evaluated with the  tags  from  each
            <u>FILE</u>  in  turn, and the file is processed only if the expression returns true.  Unlike Perl variable
            names, tag names are not case sensitive and may contain a hyphen.  As well, tag  names  may  have  a
            leading  group  names  separated  by  colons,  and/or  a  trailing  "#"  character  to disable print
            conversion.  The expression $GROUP:all evaluates to 1 if any tag exists in the specified "GROUP", or
            0 otherwise (see note 2 below).  When  multiple  <b>-if</b>  options  are  used,  all  conditions  must  be
            satisfied  to process the file.  Returns an exit status of 2 if all files fail the condition.  Below
            are a few examples:

                # extract shutterspeed from all Canon images in a directory
                exiftool -shutterspeed -if '$make eq "Canon"' dir

                # add one hour to all images created on or after Apr. 2, 2006
                exiftool -alldates+=1 -if '$CreateDate ge "2006:04:02"' dir

                # set EXIF ISO value if possible, unless it is set already
                exiftool '-exif:iso&lt;iso' -if 'not $exif:iso' dir

                # find images containing a specific keyword (case insensitive)
                exiftool -if '$keywords =~ /harvey/i' -filename dir

            Adding <u>NUM</u> to the <b>-if</b> option causes a separate processing pass to be executed for evaluating <u>EXPR</u> at
            a <b>-fast</b> level given by <u>NUM</u> (see the <b>-fast</b> option documentation for details).  Without <u>NUM</u>, only  one
            processing  pass  is  done  at  the level specified by the <b>-fast</b> option.  For example, using <b>-if5</b> is
            possible if <u>EXPR</u> uses only pseudo System tags, and may  significantly  speed  processing  if  enough
            files fail the condition.

            The  expression  has  access to the current ExifTool object through $self, and the following special
            functions are available to allow short-circuiting of the file processing.   Both  functions  have  a
            return value of 1.  Case is significant for function names.

                End()    - end processing after this file
                EndDir() - end processing of files in the current directory
                           after this file (not compatible with -fileOrder)

            Notes:

            1) The <b>-n</b> and <b>-b</b> options also apply to tags used in <u>EXPR</u>.

            2)  Some  binary  data  blocks  are  not  extracted unless specified explicitly.  These tags are not
            available for use in the <b>-if</b> condition unless they are also specified  on  the  command  line.   The
            alternative is to use the $GROUP:all syntax. (eg. Use $exif:all instead of $exif in <u>EXPR</u> to test for
            the existence of EXIF tags.)

            3)  Tags  in  the string are interpolated in a similar way to <b>-p</b> before the expression is evaluated.
            In this interpolation, $/ is converted to a newline and $$ represents a single "$" symbol.  So  Perl
            variables, if used, require a double "$", and regular expressions ending in $/ must use $$/ instead.

            4) The condition accesses only tags from the file being processed unless the <b>-fileNUM</b> option is used
            to  read  an alternate file and the corresponding family 8 group name is specified for the tag.  See
            the <b>-fileNUM</b> option details for more information.

            5) The <b>-a</b> (Duplicates) option is implied when <b>-if</b> is used without a fast  <u>NUM</u>,  and  the  values  of
            duplicate  tags  are  accessible  by  specifying  a group name in the expression (such as a family 4
            instance number, eg.  $Copy1:TAG, $Copy2:TAG, etc).

            6) A special "OK" UserParam is available to test the success of the previous command  when  <b>-execute</b>
            was used, and may be used like any other tag in the condition (ie. "$OK").

            7) The API RequestTags option is automatically set for all tags used in the <b>-if</b> condition.

       <b>-m</b> (<b>-ignoreMinorErrors</b>)
            Ignore minor errors and warnings.  This enables writing to files with minor errors and disables some
            validation checks which could result in minor warnings.  Generally, minor errors/warnings indicate a
            problem  which  usually won't result in loss of metadata if ignored.  However, there are exceptions,
            so ExifTool leaves it up to you to make the final decision.  Minor errors and warnings are indicated
            by "[minor]" at the start of the  message.   Warnings  which  affect  processing  when  ignored  are
            indicated by "[Minor]" (with a capital "M").  Note that this causes missing values in <b>-tagsFromFile</b>,
            <b>-p</b> and <b>-if</b> strings to be set to an empty string rather than an undefined value.

       <b>-o</b> <u>OUTFILE</u> or <u>FMT</u> (<b>-out</b>)
            Set  the  output  file  or  directory  name when writing information.  Without this option, when any
            "real" tags are written the original file is renamed to "FILE_original" and  output  is  written  to
            <u>FILE</u>.   When  writing  only FileName and/or Directory "pseudo" tags, <b>-o</b> causes the file to be copied
            instead of moved, but directories specified for either of  these  tags  take  precedence  over  that
            specified by the <b>-o</b> option.

            <u>OUTFILE</u>  may  be  "-"  to  write  to stdout.  The output file name may also be specified using a <u>FMT</u>
            string in which %d, %f and %e represent the directory, file name and extension of  <u>FILE</u>.   Also,  %c
            may be used to add a copy number. See the <b>-w</b> option for <u>FMT</u> string examples.

            The  output  file is taken to be a directory name if it already exists as a directory or if the name
            ends with  '/'.   Output  directories  are  created  if  necessary.   Existing  files  will  not  be
            overwritten.  Combining the <b>-overwrite_original</b> option with <b>-o</b> causes the original source file to be
            erased after the output file is successfully written.

            A special feature of this option allows the creation of certain types of files from scratch, or with
            the  metadata  from  another  type  of  file.   The  following  file types may be created using this
            technique:

                XMP, EXIF, EXV, MIE, ICC/ICM, VRD, DR4

            The output file type is determined by the extension of <u>OUTFILE</u> (specified as "-.EXT" when writing to
            stdout).  The output file is then created from a combination of  information  in  <u>FILE</u>  (as  if  the
            <b>-tagsFromFile</b>  option  was  used),  and  tag  values  assigned  on  the command line.  If no <u>FILE</u> is
            specified, the output file may be created from scratch using only tags assigned on the command line.

       <b>-overwrite_original</b>
            Overwrite the original <u>FILE</u> (instead of preserving it by adding "_original" to the file  name)  when
            writing  information  to  an  image.   Caution:  This option should only be used if you already have
            separate backup copies of your image files.  The overwrite is implemented by  renaming  a  temporary
            file  to  replace  the  original.   This  deletes  the original file and replaces it with the edited
            version in a single operation.  When combined with <b>-o</b>, this option causes the original  file  to  be
            deleted if the output file was successfully written (ie. the file is moved instead of copied).

       <b>-overwrite_original_in_place</b>
            Similar  to  <b>-overwrite_original</b>  except  that  an  extra  step  is added to allow the original file
            attributes to be preserved.  For example, on a Mac this causes  the  original  file  creation  date,
            type,  creator, label color, icon, Finder tags, other extended attributes and hard links to the file
            to be preserved (but note that the Mac OS resource fork  is  always  preserved  unless  specifically
            deleted  with  "-rsrc:all=").   This  is implemented by opening the original file in update mode and
            replacing its data with a copy of a temporary file before deleting the temporary.   The  extra  step
            results  in  slower  performance,  so  the  <b>-overwrite_original</b> option should be used instead unless
            necessary.

            Note that this option reverts to the behaviour of the <b>-overwrite_original</b> option when  also  writing
            the FileName and/or Directory tags.

       <b>-P</b> (<b>-preserve</b>)
            Preserve the filesystem modification date/time ("FileModifyDate") of the original file when writing.
            Note  that  some filesystems store a creation date (ie. "FileCreateDate" on Windows and Mac systems)
            which is not affected by this option.  This creation date is  preserved  on  Windows  systems  where
            Win32API::File  and  Win32::API  are  available  regardless of this setting.  For other systems, the
            <b>-overwrite_original_in_place</b> option may be used if necessary to preserve the creation date.  The  <b>-P</b>
            option is superseded by any value written to the FileModifyDate tag.

       <b>-password</b> <u>PASSWD</u>
            Specify password to allow processing of password-protected PDF documents.  If a password is required
            but  not  given, a warning is issued and the document is not processed.  This option is ignored if a
            password is not required.

       <b>-progress</b>[NUM][:[<u>TITLE</u>]]
            Show the progress when processing files.  Without a colon, the  <b>-progress</b>  option  adds  a  progress
            count  in  brackets  after  the  name of each processed file, giving the current file number and the
            total number of files to be processed.  Implies the <b>-v0</b> option, causing the names of processed files
            to also be printed when writing.  When combined with the <b>-if</b> option, the total  count  includes  all
            files  before  the condition is applied, but files that fail the condition will not have their names
            printed.  If NUM is specified, the progress is shown every NUM input files.

            If followed by a colon (ie. <b>-progress:</b>), the console window title is set according to the  specified
            <u>TITLE</u>  string.   If no <u>TITLE</u> is given, a default <u>TITLE</u> string of "ExifTool %p%%" is assumed.  In the
            string, %f represents the file name, %p is the progress as a percent, %r is the progress as a ratio,
            %##b is a progress bar of width "##"  (where  "##"  is  an  integer  specifying  the  bar  width  in
            characters,  or  20  characters  by  default  if  "##" is omitted), and %% is a % character.  May be
            combined with the normal <b>-progress</b> option to also show  the  progress  count  in  console  messages.
            (Note: For this feature to function correctly on Mac/Linux, stderr must go to the console.)

       <b>-q</b> (<b>-quiet</b>)
            Quiet  processing.   One  <b>-q</b>  suppresses  normal  informational messages, and a second <b>-q</b> suppresses
            warnings as well.  Error messages can not be suppressed, although minor errors may be downgraded  to
            warnings with the <b>-m</b> option, which may then be suppressed with "-q -q".

       <b>-r</b>[.] (<b>-recurse</b>)
            Recursively  process  files  in  subdirectories.   Only  meaningful  if  <u>FILE</u>  is  a directory name.
            Subdirectories with names beginning with "." are not processed unless "." is  added  to  the  option
            name (ie. <b>-r.</b> or <b>-recurse.</b>).  By default, exiftool will also follow symbolic links to directories if
            supported  by  the  system,  but  this  may  be  disabled  with "-i SYMLINKS" (see the <b>-i</b> option for
            details).  Combine this with <b>-ext</b> options to control the types of files processed.

       <b>-scanForXMP</b>
            Scan all files (even unsupported formats) for XMP information unless found already.   When  combined
            with  the  <b>-fast</b> option, only unsupported file types are scanned.  Warning: It can be time consuming
            to scan large files.

       <b>-u</b> (<b>-unknown</b>)
            Extract values of unknown tags.  Add another <b>-u</b> to also extract unknown information from binary data
            blocks.  This  option  applies  to  tags  with  numerical  tag  ID's,  and  causes  tag  names  like
            "Exif_0xc5d9"  to be generated for unknown information.  It has no effect on information types which
            have human-readable tag ID's (such as XMP), since unknown  tags  are  extracted  automatically  from
            these formats.

       <b>-U</b> (<b>-unknown2</b>)
            Extract values of unknown tags as well as unknown information from some binary data blocks.  This is
            the same as two <b>-u</b> options.

       <b>-wm</b> <u>MODE</u> (<b>-writeMode</b>)
            Set mode for writing/creating tags.  <u>MODE</u> is a string of one or more characters from the list below.
            The default write mode is "wcg".

                w - Write existing tags
                c - Create new tags
                g - create new Groups as necessary

            For example, use "-wm cg" to only create new tags (and avoid editing existing ones).

            The level of the group is the SubDirectory level in the metadata structure.  For XMP or IPTC this is
            the  full XMP/IPTC block (the family 0 group), but for EXIF this is the individual IFD (the family 1
            group).

       <b>-z</b> (<b>-zip</b>)
            When reading, causes information to be extracted from .gz and .bz2 compressed images (only one image
            per archive; requires gzip and bzip2 to be available).  When writing, causes compressed  information
            to be written if supported by the metadata format (eg. PNG supports compressed textual metadata, JXL
            supports  compressed  EXIF  and  XML,  and  MIE  supports  any  compressed  metadata),  disables the
            recommended padding in embedded XMP (saving 2424 bytes when writing XMP in a file), and  writes  XMP
            in    shorthand    format    --    the    equivalent    of    setting   the   API   Compress=1   and
            Compact="NoPadding,Shorthand".

       <u>Other</u> <u>options</u>

       <b>-@</b> <u>ARGFILE</u>
            Read command-line arguments from the specified file.  The file contains one argument per  line  (NOT
            one  option  per line -- some options require additional arguments, and all arguments must be placed
            on separate lines).  Blank lines and lines beginning with "#" are ignored (unless  they  start  with
            "#[CSTR]",  in  which case the rest of the line is treated as a C string, allowing standard C escape
            sequences such as "\n" for a newline).  White space at the start of a line is removed.  Normal shell
            processing of arguments is not performed, which among other things means that arguments  should  not
            be  quoted  and spaces are treated as any other character.  <u>ARGFILE</u> may exist relative to either the
            current directory or the exiftool directory unless an absolute pathname is given.

            For example, the following <u>ARGFILE</u> will set the value of Copyright to "Copyright YYYY, Phil Harvey",
            where "YYYY" is the year of CreateDate:

                -d
                %Y
                -copyright&lt;Copyright $createdate, Phil Harvey

            Arguments in <u>ARGFILE</u> behave exactly the same as if they were entered  at  the  location  of  the  <b>-@</b>
            option  on the command line, with the exception that the <b>-config</b> and <b>-common_args</b> options may not be
            used in an <u>ARGFILE</u>.

       <b>-k</b> (<b>-pause</b>)
            Pause with the message "-- press any key --" or "-- press RETURN  --"  (depending  on  your  system)
            before  terminating.   This  option is used to prevent the command window from closing when run as a
            Windows drag and drop application.

       <b>-list</b>, <b>-listw</b>, <b>-listf</b>, <b>-listr</b>, <b>-listwf</b>, <b>-listg</b>[<u>NUM</u>], <b>-listd</b>, <b>-listx</b>, <b>-listgeo</b>
            Print a list of all valid tag names (<b>-list</b>), all writable tag names  (<b>-listw</b>),  all  supported  file
            extensions  (<b>-listf</b>),  all  recognized  file  extensions  (<b>-listr</b>),  all  writable  file  extensions
            (<b>-listwf</b>), all tag groups [in a specified family] (<b>-listg</b>[<u>NUM</u>]), all deletable tag groups  (<b>-listd</b>),
            an XML database of tag details including language translations (<b>-listx</b>), or the Geolocation database
            (<b>-listgeo</b>).   The  <b>-list</b>, <b>-listw</b> and <b>-listx</b> options may be followed by an additional argument of the
            form "-GROUP:All" to list only tags in a specific group, where "GROUP" is one  or  more  family  0-2
            group  names  (excepting  EXIF  IFD  groups)  separated by colons.  With <b>-listg</b>, <u>NUM</u> may be given to
            specify the group family, otherwise family 0 is assumed.  The <b>-l</b> option may be combined with <b>-listf</b>,
            <b>-listr</b> or <b>-listwf</b> to add file descriptions to the list.  The  <b>-lang</b>  option  may  be  combined  with
            <b>-listx</b>  to  output  descriptions  in  a  single  language, and the <b>-sort</b> and/or <b>-lang</b> options may be
            combined with <b>-listgeo</b>.  Also, the API GeolocMinPop, GeolocFeature and GeolocAltNames options  apply
            to the <b>-listgeo</b> output.  Here are some examples:

                -list               # list all tag names
                -list -EXIF:All     # list all EXIF tags
                -list -xmp:time:all # list all XMP tags relating to time
                -listw -XMP-dc:All  # list all writable XMP-dc tags
                -listf              # list all supported file extensions
                -listr              # list all recognized file extensions
                -listwf             # list all writable file extensions
                -listg1             # list all groups in family 1
                -listd              # list all deletable groups
                -listx -EXIF:All    # list database of EXIF tags in XML format
                -listx -XMP:All -s  # list short XML database of XMP tags
                -listgeo -lang de   # list geolocation database in German

            When combined with <b>-listx</b>, the <b>-s</b> option shortens the output by omitting the descriptions and values
            (as  in  the  last  example  above), and <b>-f</b> adds 'flags' and 'struct' attributes if applicable.  The
            flags are formatted as a comma-separated list of the following possible values: Avoid, Binary, List,
            Mandatory, Permanent, Protected, Unknown and Unsafe (see the Tag Name documentation).  For XMP  List
            tags, the list type (Alt, Bag or Seq) is also given, and flattened structure tags are indicated by a
            Flattened flag with 'struct' giving the ID of the parent structure.

            Note that none of the <b>-list</b> options require an input <u>FILE</u>.

       <b>-ver</b> Print exiftool version number.  The <b>-v</b> option may be added to print addition system information (see
            the  README file of the full distribution for more details about optional libraries), or <b>-v2</b> to also
            list the Perl include directories.

       <b>--</b>   Indicates the end of options.  Any remaining arguments are treated as file names, even if they begin
            with a dash ("-").

       <u>Special</u> <u>features</u>

       <b>-diff</b> <u>FILE2</u>
            Compare metadata in <u>FILE</u> with <u>FILE2</u>.  The <u>FILE2</u> name may include filename formatting codes (see  the
            <b>-w</b>  option).   All  extracted  tags  from  the  files  are  compared,  but the extracted tags may be
            controlled by adding <b>-</b><u>TAG</u> or <b>--</b><u>TAG</u> options.  For example, below is a  command  to  compare  all  the
            same-named files in two different directories, ignoring the System tags:

                exiftool DIR1 -diff DIR2/%f.%e --system:all

            The <b>-g</b> and <b>-G</b> options may be used to organize the output by the specified family of groups, with <b>-G1</b>
            being the default.  The <b>-a</b> option is implied.  Adding <b>-v</b> includes a count of the number of tags that
            are the same in each group.  The following text formatting options are valid when <b>-diff</b> is used: <b>-c</b>,
            <b>-charset</b>, <b>-d</b>, <b>-E</b>, <b>-ec</b>, <b>-ex</b>, <b>-L</b>, <b>-lang</b>, <b>-n</b>, <b>-s</b>, <b>-sep</b>, <b>-struct</b> and <b>-w</b>.

       <b>-geotag</b> <u>TRKFILE</u>
            Geotag  images  from  the  specified  GPS track log file.  Using the <b>-geotag</b> option is equivalent to
            writing a value to the "Geotag" tag.  The GPS position is interpolated from  the  track  at  a  time
            specified  by  the  value written to the "Geotime" tag.  If "Geotime" is not specified, the value is
            copied from "DateTimeOriginal#" (the "#" is added to copy the unformatted value, avoiding  potential
            conflicts with the <b>-d</b> option).  For example, the following two commands are equivalent:

                exiftool -geotag trk.log image.jpg
                exiftool -geotag trk.log "-Geotime&lt;DateTimeOriginal#" image.jpg

            If  the  "Geotime"  value  does  not  contain a time zone then the local system timezone is assumed.
            Writing "Geotime" causes the following tags to be written (provided they can be calculated from  the
            track log, and they are supported by the destination metadata format):  GPSLatitude, GPSLatitudeRef,
            GPSLongitude, GPSLongitudeRef, GPSAltitude, GPSAltitudeRef, GPSDateStamp, GPSTimeStamp, GPSDateTime,
            GPSTrack,  GPSTrackRef,  GPSSpeed, GPSSpeedRef, GPSImgDirection, GPSImgDirectionRef, GPSMeasureMode,
            GPSDOP, GPSPitch, GPSRoll, GPSCoordinates, AmbientTemperature and CameraElevationAngle.  By default,
            in image files tags are created in EXIF, and  updated  in  XMP  only  if  they  already  exist.   In
            QuickTime-format  files GPSCoordinates is created in the preferred location (ItemList by default) as
            well as in XMP.  However, "EXIF:Geotime", "XMP:Geotime" or "QuickTime:Geotime" may be  specified  to
            write to write only to one group. Also, "ItemList:Geotime", "Keys:Geotime" or "UserData:Geotime" may
            be  used  to write to a specific location in QuickTime-format files.  Note that GPSPitch and GPSRoll
            are non-standard, and require user-defined tags in order to be written.

            The "Geosync" tag may be used to specify a time correction which is applied to each "Geotime"  value
            for  synchronization  with GPS time.  For example, the following command compensates for image times
            which are 1 minute and 20 seconds behind GPS:

                exiftool -geosync=+1:20 -geotag a.log DIR

            Advanced "Geosync" features allow a piecewise linear time drift correction and synchronization  from
            previously  geotagged  images.   See  "geotag.html"  in  the  full  ExifTool  distribution  for more
            information.

            Multiple <b>-geotag</b> options may be used to concatenate GPS track log  data.   Also,  a  single  <b>-geotag</b>
            option may be used to load multiple track log files by using wildcards in the <u>TRKFILE</u> name, but note
            that  in this case <u>TRKFILE</u> must be quoted on most systems (with the notable exception of Windows) to
            prevent filename expansion.  For example:

                exiftool -geotag "TRACKDIR/*.log" IMAGEDIR

            Currently supported track file formats are GPX, NMEA RMC/GGA/GLL, KML,  IGC,  Garmin  XML  and  TCX,
            Magellan  PMGNTRK,  Honeywell  PTNTHPR,  Bramor gEO, Winplus Beacon TXT, and GPS/IMU CSV files.  See
            "GEOTAGGING EXAMPLES" for examples. Also see "geotag.html" in the full ExifTool distribution and the
            Image::ExifTool Options for more details and for information about geotag configuration options.

            The API Geolocation option may be set to the value "geotag" to also write the  name,  province/state
            and  country  of the nearest city while geotagging.  See &lt;https://exiftool.org/geolocation.html&gt; for
            details.

       <b>-globalTimeShift</b> <u>SHIFT</u>
            Shift all formatted date/time values by the specified  amount  when  reading.   Does  not  apply  to
            unformatted  (<b>-n</b>)  output.   <u>SHIFT</u>  takes  the  same  form  as the date/time shift when writing (see
            Image::ExifTool::Shift.pl for details), with a negative shift being  indicated  with  a  minus  sign
            ("-") at the start of the <u>SHIFT</u> string.  For example:

                # return all date/times, shifted back by 1 hour
                exiftool -globalTimeShift -1 -time:all a.jpg

                # set the file name from the shifted CreateDate (-1 day) for
                # all images in a directory
                exiftool "-filename&lt;createdate" -globaltimeshift "-0:0:1 0:0:0" \
                    -d %Y%m%d-%H%M%S.%%e dir

       <b>-use</b> <u>MODULE</u>
            Add  features  from  specified plug-in <u>MODULE</u>.  Currently, the MWG module is the only plug-in module
            distributed with exiftool.  This module adds read/write support  for  tags  as  recommended  by  the
            Metadata Working Group. As a convenience, "-use MWG" is assumed if the group name prefix starts with
            "MWG:"  exactly  for any requested tag.  See the MWG Tags documentation for more details.  Note that
            this option is not reversible, and remains in effect until the application terminates,  even  across
            the <b>-execute</b> option.

       <u>Utilities</u>

       <b>-restore_original</b>
       <b>-delete_original</b>[!]
            These  utility  options automate the maintenance of the "_original" files created by exiftool.  They
            have no effect on files without an "_original" copy.   The  <b>-restore_original</b>  option  restores  the
            specified  files  from their original copies by renaming the "_original" files to replace the edited
            versions.  For example, the following command restores the originals of all JPG images in  directory
            "DIR":

                exiftool -restore_original -ext jpg DIR

            The  <b>-delete_original</b>  option  deletes  the "_original" copies of all files specified on the command
            line.  Without a trailing "!" this option prompts for confirmation before continuing.  For  example,
            the following command deletes "a.jpg_original" if it exists, after asking "Are you sure?":

                exiftool -delete_original a.jpg

            These  options  may  not be used with other options to read or write tag values in the same command,
            but may be combined with options such <b>-ext</b>, <b>-if</b>, <b>-r</b>, <b>-q</b> and <b>-v</b>.

       <u>Advanced</u> <u>options</u>

       Among other things, the advanced options allow complex processing to be performed from a  single  command
       without  the  need for additional scripting.  This may be particularly useful for implementations such as
       Windows drag-and-drop applications.  These options may also be used to improve performance in  multi-pass
       processing by reducing the overhead required to load exiftool for each invocation.

       <b>-api</b> [<u>OPT[[^]=[VAL]]</u>]
            Set  ExifTool  API  option.   <u>OPT</u>  is  an  API option name.  The option value is set to 1 if <u>=VAL</u> is
            omitted.  If <u>VAL</u> is omitted, the option value is set to undef if "=" is used,  or  an  empty  string
            with "^=".  If <u>OPT</u> is not specified a list of available options is returned.  The option name is not
            case  senstive,  but  the  option values are.  See Image::ExifTool Options for option details.  This
            overrides API options set via the config file.  Note that the exiftool app  sets  some  API  options
            internally, and attempts to change these via the command line will have no effect.

       <b>-common_args</b>
            Specifies that all arguments following this option are common to all executed commands when <b>-execute</b>
            is used.  This and the <b>-config</b> option are the only options that may not be used inside a <b>-@</b> <u>ARGFILE</u>.
            Note  that  by  definition  this  option  and its arguments MUST come after all other options on the
            command line.

       <b>-config</b> <u>CFGFILE</u>
            Load specified configuration file instead of the default ".ExifTool_config".  If used,  this  option
            must  come  before  all  other arguments on the command line and applies to all <b>-execute</b>'d commands.
            This file is used to create user-defined tags as well as set default ExifTool options.  The  <u>CFGFILE</u>
            must exist relative to the current working directory or the exiftool application directory unless an
            absolute  path  is specified.  Loading of the default config file may be disabled by setting <u>CFGFILE</u>
            to an empty string (ie. "").  See &lt;https://exiftool.org/config.html&gt; and config_files/example.config
            in the full ExifTool distribution for details about the configuration file syntax.

       <b>-echo</b>[<u>NUM</u>] <u>TEXT</u>
            Echo <u>TEXT</u> to stdout (<b>-echo</b> or <b>-echo1</b>) or stderr (<b>-echo2</b>).  Text is output as  the  command  line  is
            parsed,  before the processing of any input files.  <u>NUM</u> may also be 3 or 4 to output text (to stdout
            or stderr respectively) after processing is complete.  For <b>-echo3</b> and  <b>-echo4</b>,  "${status}"  may  be
            used in the <u>TEXT</u> string to represent the numerical exit status of the command (see "EXIT STATUS").

       <b>-efile</b>[<u>NUM</u>][!] <u>TXTFILE</u>
            Save  the  names  of  files  giving errors (<u>NUM</u> missing or 1), files that were unchanged (<u>NUM</u> is 2),
            files that fail the <b>-if</b> condition (<u>NUM</u> is 4), files that were updated (<u>NUM</u> is 8),  files  that  were
            created  (<u>NUM</u>  is 16), or any combination thereof by summing <u>NUM</u> (eg. <b>-efile3</b> is the same has having
            both <b>-efile</b> and <b>-efile2</b> options with the same <u>TXTFILE</u>). By default, file names are appended  to  any
            existing  <u>TXTFILE</u>,  but  <u>TXTFILE</u>  is overwritten if an exclamation point is added to the option (eg.
            <b>-efile!</b>).  Saves the name of the file specified by the <b>-srcfile</b> option if applicable.

       <b>-execute</b>[<u>NUM</u>]
            Execute command for all arguments up to this point on the command line (plus any arguments specified
            by <b>-common_args</b>).  The result is as if the commands were executed as separate  command  lines  (with
            the  exception  of  the  <b>-config</b>  and  <b>-use</b> options which remain in effect for subsequent commands).
            Allows multiple commands to be executed from a single command line.  <u>NUM</u> is an optional number  that
            is echoed in the "{ready}" message when using the <b>-stay_open</b> feature.  If a <u>NUM</u> is specified, the <b>-q</b>
            option no longer suppresses the output "{readyNUM}" message.

       <b>-file</b><u>NUM</u> <u>ALTFILE</u>
            Read  tags from an alternate source file.  Among other things, this allows tags from different files
            to be compared and combined using the <b>-if</b> and <b>-p</b> options.  <u>NUM</u> is any string of digits.   Tags  from
            alternate  files  are  accessed  via  the corresponding family 8 group name (eg. "File1:TAG" for the
            <b>-file1</b> option, "File2:TAG" for <b>-file2</b>, etc).  <u>ALTFILE</u> may contain filename formatting codes like the
            <b>-w</b> option (%d, %f, etc), and/or tag names with a leading "$" symbol to access tags from  the  source
            file  in the same way as the <b>-p</b> option (so any other dollar symbol in the file name must be doubled,
            eg. "money$$.jpg").  For example, assuming that the OriginalFileName tag has been set in the  edited
            file, a command to copy Rights from the original file could look like this:

                exiftool -file1 '$originalfilename' '-rights&lt;file1:rights' edited.jpg

            Subtle  note:  If a <b>-tagsFromFile</b> option is used, tags in the <u>ALTFILE</u> argument come from the <u>SRCFILE</u>
            that applies to the first argument accessing tags from the corresponding "FileNUM" group.

            User-defined Composite tags may access tags  from  alternate  files  using  the  appropriate  (case-
            sensitive) family 8 group name.

       <b>-list_dir</b>
            List  directories  themselves instead of their contents.  This option effectively causes directories
            to be treated as normal files when reading and writing.  For example, with this option the output of
            the "ls -la" command on Mac/Linux may be approximated by this exiftool command:

                exiftool -list_dir -T -ls-l -api systemtags -fast5 .* *

            (The <b>-T</b> option formats the output in tab-separated  columns,  <b>-ls-l</b>  is  a  shortcut  tag,  the  API
            SystemTags  option  is  required  to extract some necessary tags, and the <b>-fast5</b> option is added for
            speed since only system tags are being extracted.)

       <b>-srcfile</b> <u>FMT</u>
            Specify a different source file to be processed based on the name of the original <u>FILE</u>.  This may be
            useful in some special situations for processing related preview images or sidecar files.   See  the
            <b>-w</b>  option for a description of the <u>FMT</u> syntax.  Note that file name <u>FMT</u> strings for all options are
            based on the original <u>FILE</u> specified from the  command  line,  not  the  name  of  the  source  file
            specified by <b>-srcfile</b>.

            For  example, to copy metadata from NEF files to the corresponding JPG previews in a directory where
            other JPG images may exist:

                exiftool -ext nef -tagsfromfile @ -srcfile %d%f.jpg dir

            If more than one <b>-srcfile</b> option is specified, the files are tested in order and the first  existing
            source  file  is processed.  If none of the source files already exist, then exiftool uses the first
            <b>-srcfile</b> specified.

            A <u>FMT</u> of "@" may be used to represent the  original  <u>FILE</u>,  which  may  be  useful  when  specifying
            multiple <b>-srcfile</b> options (eg. to fall back to processing the original <u>FILE</u> if no sidecar exists).

            When  this  option  is used, two special UserParam tags (OriginalFileName and OriginalDirectory) are
            generated to allow access to the original <u>FILE</u> name and directory.

       <b>-stay_open</b> <u>FLAG</u>
            If <u>FLAG</u> is 1 or "True" (case insensitive), causes exiftool keep reading from  the  <b>-@</b>  <u>ARGFILE</u>  even
            after reaching the end of file.  This feature allows calling applications to pre-load exiftool, thus
            avoiding the overhead of loading exiftool for each command.  The procedure is as follows:

            1) Execute "exiftool -stay_open True -@ <u>ARGFILE</u>", where <u>ARGFILE</u> is the name of an existing (possibly
            empty) argument file or "-" to pipe arguments from the standard input.

            2)  Write  exiftool  command-line arguments to <u>ARGFILE</u>, one argument per line (see the <b>-@</b> option for
            details).

            3) Write "-execute\n" to <u>ARGFILE</u>, where "\n" represents a newline sequence.  (Note: You may need  to
            flush  your  write  buffers  here if using buffered output.)  ExifTool will then execute the command
            with the arguments received up to this point, send a "{ready}" message to stdout when  done  (unless
            the  <b>-q</b>  or  <b>-T</b>  option  is  used),  and continue trying to read arguments for the next command from
            <u>ARGFILE</u>.  To aid in command/response synchronization, any number appended to the <b>-execute</b> option  is
            echoed  in  the  "{ready}"  message.  For example, "-execute613" results in "{ready613}".  When this
            number is added, <b>-q</b> no longer suppresses the "{ready}" message.  (Also, see the  <b>-echo3</b>  and  <b>-echo4</b>
            options for additional ways to pass signals back to your application.)

            4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each command.

            5)  Write  "-stay_open\nFalse\n"  (or  "-stay_open\n0\n")  to  <u>ARGFILE</u>  when  done.  This will cause
            exiftool to process any remaining command-line arguments then exit normally.

            The input <u>ARGFILE</u> may be changed at any time before step 5 above by writing the following  lines  to
            the currently open <u>ARGFILE</u>:

                -stay_open
                True
                -@
                NEWARGFILE

            This  causes  <u>ARGFILE</u>  to  be closed, and <u>NEWARGFILE</u> to be kept open.  (Without the <b>-stay_open</b> here,
            exiftool would  have  returned  to  reading  arguments  from  <u>ARGFILE</u>  after  reaching  the  end  of
            <u>NEWARGFILE</u>.)

            Note:   When  writing  arguments to a disk file there is a delay of up to 0.01 seconds after writing
            "-execute\n" before exiftool starts processing the command.  This delay may be avoided by sending  a
            CONT signal to the exiftool process immediately after writing "-execute\n".  (There is no associated
            delay  when writing arguments via a pipe with "-@ -", so the signal is not necessary when using this
            technique.)

       <b>-userParam</b> <u>PARAM[[^]=[VAL]]</u>
            Set user parameter.  <u>PARAM</u> is an arbitrary user parameter name.  This is an  interface  to  the  API
            UserParam  option  (see  the Image::ExifTool Options documentation), and provides a method to access
            user-defined parameters in arguments to the <b>-if</b> and <b>-p</b> options  as  if  they  were  any  other  tag.
            Appending  a  hash  tag ("#") to <u>PARAM</u> (eg. "-userParam MyTag#=yes") also causes the parameter to be
            extracted as a normal tag in the UserParam group.  Similar to the <b>-api</b> option, the  parameter  value
            is  set to 1 if <u>=VAL</u> is omitted, undef if just <u>VAL</u> is omitted with "=", or an empty string if <u>VAL</u> is
            omitted with "^=".

                exiftool -p '$test from $filename' -userparam test=Hello FILE

       <u>Advanced</u> <u>formatting</u> <u>feature</u>

       An advanced formatting feature allows modification of the value of any tag interpolated within a  <b>-if</b>  or
       <b>-p</b>  option  argument, or a <b>-tagsFromFile</b> redirection string.  Tag names within these strings are prefixed
       by a "$" symbol, and an arbitrary Perl expression may be applied to  the  tag  value  by  placing  braces
       around  the  tag  name  and  inserting  the  expression  after  the  name,  separated by a semicolon (ie.
       "${TAG;EXPR}").  The expression acts on the value of the tag through the default input variable ($_), and
       has access to the full ExifTool API through the current ExifTool object ($self) and the tag  key  ($tag).
       It may contain any valid Perl code, including translation ("tr///") and substitution ("s///") operations,
       but  note  that  braces within the expression must be balanced.  The example below prints the camera Make
       with spaces translated to underlines, and multiple consecutive underlines replaced by a single underline:

           exiftool -p '${make;tr/ /_/;s/__+/_/g}' image.jpg

       An "@" may be added after the tag name to make the expression act on individual list items for  list-type
       tags,  simplifying list processing.  Set $_ to undef to remove an item from the list.  As an example, the
       following command returns all subjects not containing the string "xxx":

           exiftool -p '${subject@;$_=undef if /xxx/}' image.jpg

       A default expression of "tr(/\\?*:|"&lt;&gt;\0)()d" is assumed if the  expression  is  empty  (ie.  "${TAG;}").
       This  removes  the  characters  /  \  ? * : | &lt; &gt; and null from the printed value.  (These characters are
       illegal in Windows file names, so this feature is useful if tag values are used in file names.)

       Helper functions

       "DateFmt"

       Simplifies reformatting of individual date/time values.  This function acts on a standard  EXIF-formatted
       date/time  value  in  $_ and formats it according to the specified format string (see the <b>-d</b> option).  To
       avoid trying to reformat an already-formatted date/time value, a "#" must be added to the tag name (as in
       the example below) if the <b>-d</b> option is also used.  For example:

           exiftool -p '${createdate#;DateFmt("%Y-%m-%d_%H%M%S")}' a.jpg

       "ShiftTime"

       Shifts EXIF-formatted date/time string by a specified amount.  Start with a leading minus sign  to  shift
       backwards  in time.  See Image::ExifTool::Shift.pl for details about shift syntax.  For example, to shift
       a date/time value back by one year:

           exiftool -p '${createdate;ShiftTime("-1:0:0 0")}' a.jpg

       "NoDups"

       Removes duplicate items from a list with a separator specified by the <b>-sep</b> option.  This function is most
       useful when copying list-type tags.  For example, the following command may be used to  remove  duplicate
       Keywords:

           exiftool -sep '##' '-keywords&lt;${keywords;NoDups}' a.jpg

       The  <b>-sep</b> option is necessary to split the string back into individual list items when writing to a list-
       type tag.

       An optional flag argument may be set to 1 to cause "NoDups" to set $_ to undef if no duplicates  existed,
       thus preventing the file from being rewritten unnecessarily:

           exiftool -sep '##' '-keywords&lt;${keywords;<a href="../man1/NoDups.1.html">NoDups</a>(1)}' a.jpg

       Note that function names are case sensitive.

       ExifTool  12.64  adds an API NoDups option which makes the NoDups helper function largely redundant, with
       all the functionality except the ability to avoid rewriting the file if there are no duplicates, but with
       the advantage the duplicates may be removed when accumulating  list  items  from  multiple  sources.   An
       equivalent to the above commands using this feature would be:

           exiftool -tagsfromfile @ -keywords -api nodups a.jpg

       "SetTags"

       Used  to  set  tags  in extracted images.  With no arguments, copies all tags from the source file to the
       embedded image:

           exiftool -p '${previewimage;SetTags}' -b a.arw &gt; preview.jpg

       Arguments may be added to copy or set specific tags.  Arguments take exactly the same form  as  those  on
       the command line when copying or writing tags, but without the leading dash.  For example:

           exiftool -p '${previewimage;SetTags("comment=test","title&lt;filename")}' ...

</pre><h4><b>WINDOWS</b> <b>UNICODE</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       In  Windows,  command-line  arguments  are  specified  using  the  current  code  page  and  are  recoded
       automatically to the system code page.  This recoding is not done for arguments in ExifTool arg files, so
       by default filenames in arg files use the system code page.  Unfortunately,  these  code  pages  are  not
       complete character sets, so not all file names may be represented.

       ExifTool  9.79  and  later allow the file name encoding to be specified with "-charset filename=CHARSET",
       where "CHARSET" is the name of a valid ExifTool character set, preferably "UTF8" (see the <b>-charset</b> option
       for a complete list).  Setting this triggers  the  use  of  Windows  wide-character  i/o  routines,  thus
       providing  support  for  most  Unicode  file names (see note 4).  But note that it is not trivial to pass
       properly encoded file names on the Windows  command  line  (see  &lt;https://exiftool.org/faq.html#Q18&gt;  for
       details), so placing them in a UTF-8 encoded <b>-@</b> argfile and using "-charset filename=utf8" is recommended
       if possible.

       A  warning  is  issued if a specified filename contains special characters and the filename character set
       was not provided.  However, the warning may be disabled by setting "-charset filename=""",  and  ExifTool
       may still function correctly if the system code page matches the character set used for the file names.

       When  a  directory  name  is provided, the file name encoding need not be specified (unless the directory
       name contains special characters), and ExifTool will automatically use wide-character  routines  to  scan
       the directory.

       The  filename  character  set applies to the <u>FILE</u> arguments as well as filename arguments of <b>-@</b>, <b>-geotag</b>,
       <b>-o</b>, <b>-p</b>, <b>-srcfile</b>, <b>-tagsFromFile</b>, <b>-csv</b>=, <b>-j</b>= and <b>-</b><u>TAG</u>&lt;=.  However,  it  does  not  apply  to  the  <b>-config</b>
       filename,  which  always uses the system character set.  The "-charset filename=" option must come before
       the <b>-@</b> option to be effective, but the order doesn't matter with respect to other options.

       Notes:

       1) FileName and Directory tag values still use the same encoding as other tag values, and  are  converted
       to/from the filename character set when writing/reading if specified.

       2) Unicode support is not yet implemented for other Windows-based systems like Cygwin.

       3) See "WRITING READ-ONLY FILES" below for a note about editing read-only files with Unicode names.

       4) Unicode file names with surrogate pairs (code points over U+FFFF) still cause problems.

</pre><h4><b>WRITING</b> <b>READ-ONLY</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       In  general,  ExifTool  may be used to write metadata to read-only files provided that the user has write
       permission in the directory.  However, there  are  three  cases  where  file  write  permission  is  also
       required:

       1) When using the <b>-overwrite_original_in_place</b> option.

       2) When writing only pseudo System tags (eg. FileModifyDate).

       3)  On  Windows  if the file has Unicode characters in its name, and a) the <b>-overwrite_original</b> option is
       used, or b) the "_original" backup already exists.

       Hidden files in Windows behave as read-only files when attempting to write any real tags to the  file  --
       an error is generated when using the <b>-overwrite_original_in_place</b>, otherwise writing should be successful
       and  the  hidden  attribute  will  be removed.  But the <b>-if</b> option may be used to avoid processing hidden
       files (provided Win32API::File is available):

           exiftool -if "$fileattributes !~ /Hidden/" ...

</pre><h4><b>READING</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Note</b>: Beware when cutting and pasting these examples into your terminal!  Some characters such as  single
       and  double  quotes  and  hyphens  may  have been changed into similar-looking yet functionally-different
       characters by the text formatter used to display this documentation.  Also note that Windows  users  must
       use double quotes instead of single quotes as below around arguments containing special characters.

       exiftool -a -u -g1 a.jpg
            Print  all  meta information in an image, including duplicate and unknown tags, sorted by group (for
            family 1).  For performance reasons, this command may not extract all available metadata.  (Metadata
            in embedded documents, metadata extracted by external utilities, and  metadata  requiring  excessive
            processing time may not be extracted).  Add "-ee3" and "-api RequestAll=3" to the command to extract
            absolutely everything available.

       exiftool -common dir
            Print  common  meta  information  for all images in "dir".  "-common" is a shortcut tag representing
            common EXIF meta information.

       exiftool -T -createdate -aperture -shutterspeed -iso dir &gt; out.txt
            List specified meta information in tab-delimited column form for all images in "dir"  to  an  output
            text file named "out.txt".

       exiftool -s -ImageSize -ExposureTime b.jpg
            Print ImageSize and ExposureTime tag names and values.

       exiftool -l -canon c.jpg d.jpg
            Print standard Canon information from two image files.

       exiftool -r -w .txt -common pictures
            Recursively  extract common meta information from files in "pictures" directory, writing text output
            to ".txt" files with the same names.

       exiftool -b -ThumbnailImage image.jpg &gt; thumbnail.jpg
            Save thumbnail image from "image.jpg" to a file called "thumbnail.jpg".

       exiftool -b -JpgFromRaw -w _JFR.JPG -ext NEF -r .
            Recursively extract JPG image from all Nikon NEF files in the current directory,  adding  "_JFR.JPG"
            for the name of the output JPG files.

       exiftool -a -b -W %d%f_%t%-c.%s -preview:all dir
            Extract  all  types of preview images (ThumbnailImage, PreviewImage, JpgFromRaw, etc.) from files in
            directory "dir", adding the tag name to the output preview image file names.

       exiftool -d '%r %a, %B %e, %Y' -DateTimeOriginal -S -s -ext jpg .
            Print formatted date/time for all JPG files in the current directory.

       exiftool -IFD1:XResolution -IFD1:YResolution image.jpg
            Extract image resolution from EXIF IFD1 information (thumbnail image IFD).

       exiftool '-*resolution*' image.jpg
            Extract all tags with names containing the word "Resolution" from an image.

       exiftool -xmp:author:all -a image.jpg
            Extract all author-related XMP information from an image.

       exiftool -xmp -b a.jpg &gt; out.xmp
            Extract complete XMP data record intact from "a.jpg" and write it to  "out.xmp"  using  the  special
            "XMP" tag (see the Extra tags in Image::ExifTool::TagNames).

       exiftool -p '$filename has date $dateTimeOriginal' -q -f dir
            Print  one  line of output containing the file name and DateTimeOriginal for each image in directory
            "dir".

       exiftool -ee3 -p '$gpslatitude, $gpslongitude, $gpstimestamp' a.m2ts
            Extract all GPS positions from an AVCHD video.

       exiftool -icc_profile -b -w icc image.jpg
            Save complete ICC_Profile from an image to an output file with the same name  and  an  extension  of
            ".icc".

       exiftool -htmldump -w tmp/%f_%e.html t/images
            Generate HTML pages from a hex dump of EXIF information in all images from the "t/images" directory.
            The output HTML files are written to the "tmp" directory (which is created if it didn't exist), with
            names of the form 'FILENAME_EXT.html'.

       exiftool -a -b -ee -embeddedimage -W Image_%.3g3.%s file.pdf
            Extract  embedded  JPG  and JP2 images from a PDF file.  The output images will have file names like
            "Image_#.jpg" or "Image_#.jp2", where "#" is the ExifTool family 3 embedded document number for  the
            image.

</pre><h4><b>WRITING</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Note that quotes are necessary around arguments which contain certain special characters such as "&gt;", "&lt;"
       or  any  white space.  These quoting techniques are shell dependent, but the examples below will work for
       most Unix shells.  With the Windows cmd shell however, double quotes should be used  (eg.  -Comment="This
       is a new comment").

       exiftool -Comment='This is a new comment' dst.jpg
            Write new comment to a JPG image (replaces any existing comment).

       exiftool -comment= -o newdir -ext jpg .
            Remove  comment  from  all JPG images in the current directory, writing the modified images to a new
            directory.

       exiftool -keywords=EXIF -keywords=editor dst.jpg
            Replace existing keyword list with two new keywords ("EXIF" and "editor").

       exiftool -Keywords+=word -o newfile.jpg src.jpg
            Copy a source image to a new file, and add a keyword ("word") to the current list of keywords.

       exiftool -exposurecompensation+=-0.5 a.jpg
            Decrement the value of ExposureCompensation by 0.5 EV.  Note that += with a negative value  is  used
            for decrementing because the -= operator is used for conditional deletion (see next example).

       exiftool -credit-=xxx dir
            Delete Credit information from all files in a directory where the Credit value was "xxx".

       exiftool -xmp:description-de='k&amp;uuml;hl' -E dst.jpg
            Write  alternate  language  for  XMP:Description,  using  HTML  character  escaping to input special
            characters.

       exiftool -all= dst.jpg
            Delete all meta information from an image.  Note: You should NOT do this to RAW images (except  DNG)
            since  proprietary  RAW  image formats often contain information in the makernotes that is necessary
            for converting the image.

       exiftool -all= -comment='lonely' dst.jpg
            Delete all meta information from an image and add a comment  back  in.   (Note  that  the  order  is
            important: "-comment='lonely' -all=" would also delete the new comment.)

       exiftool -all= --jfif:all dst.jpg
            Delete all meta information except JFIF group from an image.

       exiftool -Photoshop:All= dst.jpg
            Delete  Photoshop  meta information from an image (note that the Photoshop information also includes
            IPTC).

       exiftool -r -XMP-crss:all= DIR
            Recursively delete all XMP-crss information from images in a directory.

       exiftool '-ThumbnailImage&lt;=thumb.jpg' dst.jpg
            Set the thumbnail image from specified file  (Note:  The  quotes  are  necessary  to  prevent  shell
            redirection).

       exiftool '-JpgFromRaw&lt;=%d%f_JFR.JPG' -ext NEF -r .
            Recursively  write  JPEG  images  with filenames ending in "_JFR.JPG" to the JpgFromRaw tag of like-
            named files with  extension  ".NEF"  in  the  current  directory.   (This  is  the  inverse  of  the
            "-JpgFromRaw" command of the "READING EXAMPLES" section above.)

       exiftool -DateTimeOriginal-='0:0:0 1:30:0' dir
            Adjust  original  date/time of all images in directory "dir" by subtracting one hour and 30 minutes.
            (This is equivalent to "-DateTimeOriginal-=1.5".  See Image::ExifTool::Shift.pl for details.)

       exiftool -createdate+=3 -modifydate+=3 a.jpg b.jpg
            Add 3 hours to the CreateDate and ModifyDate timestamps of two images.

       exiftool -AllDates+=1:30 -if '$make eq "Canon"' dir
            Shift the values of DateTimeOriginal, CreateDate and ModifyDate forward by 1 hour and 30 minutes for
            all Canon images in a directory.  (The AllDates tag is provided as a shortcut for these three  tags,
            allowing them to be accessed via a single tag.)

       exiftool -xmp:city=Kingston image1.jpg image2.nef
            Write  a  tag to the XMP group of two images.  (Without the "xmp:" this tag would get written to the
            IPTC group since "City" exists in both, and IPTC is preferred by default.)

       exiftool -LightSource-='Unknown (0)' dst.tiff
            Delete "LightSource" tag only if it is unknown with a value of 0.

       exiftool -whitebalance-=auto -WhiteBalance=tung dst.jpg
            Set "WhiteBalance" to "Tungsten" only if it was previously "Auto".

       exiftool -comment-= -comment='new comment' a.jpg
            Write a new comment only if the image doesn't have one already.

       exiftool -o %d%f.xmp dir
            Create XMP meta information data files for all images in "dir".

       exiftool -o test.xmp -owner=Phil -title='XMP File'
            Create an XMP data file only from tags defined on the command line.

       exiftool '-ICC_Profile&lt;=%d%f.icc' image.jpg
            Write ICC_Profile to an image from a ".icc" file of the same name.

       exiftool -hierarchicalkeywords='{keyword=one,children={keyword=B}}'
            Write structured XMP information.  See &lt;https://exiftool.org/struct.html&gt; for more details.

       exiftool -trailer:all= image.jpg
            Delete any trailer found after the end of image (EOI) in a JPEG file.  A number of  digital  cameras
            store  a  large  PreviewImage  after the JPEG EOI, and the file size may be reduced significantly by
            deleting this trailer.  See the JPEG Tags documentation for a list of recognized JPEG trailers.

</pre><h4><b>COPYING</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       These examples demonstrate the ability to copy tag values between files.

       exiftool -tagsFromFile src.cr2 dst.jpg
            Copy the values of all writable tags from "src.cr2" to "dst.jpg", writing the information  to  same-
            named tags in the preferred groups.

       exiftool -TagsFromFile src.jpg -all:all dst.jpg
            Copy  the  values  of  all  writable  tags  from "src.jpg" to "dst.jpg", preserving the original tag
            groups.

       exiftool -all= -tagsfromfile src.jpg -exif:all dst.jpg
            Erase all meta information from "dst.jpg" image, then copy EXIF tags from "src.jpg".

       exiftool -exif:all= -tagsfromfile @ -all:all -unsafe bad.jpg
            Rebuild all EXIF meta information from scratch in an image.  This technique  can  be  used  in  JPEG
            images to repair corrupted EXIF information which otherwise could not be written due to errors.  The
            "Unsafe"  tag  is a shortcut for unsafe EXIF tags in JPEG images which are not normally copied.  See
            the tag name documentation for more details about unsafe tags.

       exiftool -Tagsfromfile a.jpg out.xmp
            Copy meta information from "a.jpg" to an XMP data file.  If the  XMP  data  file  "out.xmp"  already
            exists,  it  will be updated with the new information.  Otherwise the XMP data file will be created.
            Only metadata-only files may be created like this (files containing images may  be  edited  but  not
            created).  See "WRITING EXAMPLES" above for another technique to generate XMP files.

       exiftool -tagsFromFile a.jpg -XMP:All= -ThumbnailImage= -m b.jpg
            Copy  all  meta  information from "a.jpg" to "b.jpg", deleting all XMP information and the thumbnail
            image from the destination.

       exiftool -TagsFromFile src.jpg -title -author=Phil dst.jpg
            Copy title from one image to another and set a new author name.

       exiftool -TagsFromFile a.jpg -ISO -TagsFromFile b.jpg -comment dst.jpg
            Copy ISO from one image and Comment from another image to a destination image.

       exiftool -tagsfromfile src.jpg -exif:all --subifd:all dst.jpg
            Copy only the EXIF information from one image to another, excluding SubIFD tags.

       exiftool '-FileModifyDate&lt;DateTimeOriginal' dir
            Use the original date from the meta information to set the same file's filesystem modification  date
            for all images in a directory.  (Note that "-TagsFromFile @" is assumed if no other <b>-TagsFromFile</b> is
            specified when redirecting information as in this example.)

       exiftool -TagsFromFile src.jpg '-xmp:all&lt;all' dst.jpg
            Copy all possible information from "src.jpg" and write in XMP format to "dst.jpg".

       exiftool '-Description&lt;${FileName;s/\.[^.]*$//}' dir
            Set  the  image  Description from the file name after removing the extension.  This example uses the
            "Advanced formatting feature" to perform a  substitution  operation  to  remove  the  last  dot  and
            subsequent characters from the file name.

       exiftool -@ iptc2xmp.args -iptc:all= a.jpg
            Translate  IPTC  information  to  XMP with appropriate tag name conversions, and delete the original
            IPTC information from an image.  This example uses iptc2xmp.args, which is a file included with  the
            ExifTool  distribution  that  contains  the  required  arguments  to convert IPTC information to XMP
            format.  Also  included  with  the  distribution  are  xmp2iptc.args  (which  performs  the  inverse
            conversion) and a few more .args files for other conversions between EXIF, IPTC and XMP.

       exiftool -tagsfromfile %d%f.CR2 -r -ext JPG dir
            Recursively  rewrite  all "JPG" images in "dir" with information copied from the corresponding "CR2"
            images in the same directories.

       exiftool '-keywords+&lt;make' image.jpg
            Add camera make to list of keywords.

       exiftool '-comment&lt;ISO=$exif:iso Exposure=${shutterspeed}' dir
            Set the Comment tag of all images in "dir" from the values of the EXIF:ISO  and  ShutterSpeed  tags.
            The resulting comment will be in the form "ISO=100 Exposure=1/60".

       exiftool -TagsFromFile src.jpg -icc_profile dst.jpg
            Copy ICC_Profile from one image to another.

       exiftool -TagsFromFile src.jpg -all:all dst.mie
            Copy  all  meta information in its original form from a JPEG image to a MIE file.  The MIE file will
            be created if it doesn't exist.  This technique can be used to store the metadata of an image so  it
            can be inserted back into the image (with the inverse command) later in a workflow.

       exiftool -o dst.mie -all:all src.jpg
            This command performs exactly the same task as the command above, except that the <b>-o</b> option will not
            write to an output file that already exists.

       exiftool -b -jpgfromraw -w %d%f_%ue.jpg -execute -b -previewimage -w %d%f_%ue.jpg -execute -tagsfromfile
       @ -srcfile %d%f_%ue.jpg -overwrite_original -common_args --ext jpg DIR
            [Advanced]  Extract  JpgFromRaw or PreviewImage from all but JPG files in DIR, saving them with file
            names like "image_EXT.jpg", then add all meta information from the original files to  the  extracted
            images.   Here,  the command line is broken into three sections (separated by <b>-execute</b> options), and
            each is executed as if it were a separate command.  The <b>-common_args</b> option causes  the  "--ext  jpg
            DIR" arguments to be applied to all three commands, and the <b>-srcfile</b> option allows the extracted JPG
            image  to  be  the source file for the third command (whereas the RAW files are the source files for
            the other two commands).

</pre><h4><b>RENAMING</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       By writing the "FileName" and "Directory" tags, files are renamed and/or moved to new directories.   This
       can  be  particularly  useful and powerful for organizing files by date when combined with the <b>-d</b> option.
       New directories are created as necessary, but existing files will not be overwritten.  The  format  codes
       %d,  %f  and  %e  may  be used in the new file name to represent the directory, name and extension of the
       original file, and %c may be used to add a copy number if the file already exists (see the <b>-w</b> option  for
       details).   Note that if used within a date format string, an extra '%' must be added to pass these codes
       through the date/time parser.  (And further note that in a Windows batch file, all  '%'  characters  must
       also  be  escaped,  so  in  this  extreme case '%%%%f' is necessary to pass a simple '%f' through the two
       levels of parsing.)  See &lt;https://exiftool.org/filename.html&gt; for additional documentation and examples.

       exiftool -filename=new.jpg dir/old.jpg
            Rename "old.jpg" to "new.jpg" in directory "dir".

       exiftool -directory=%e dir
            Move all files from directory "dir" into directories named by the original file extensions.

       exiftool '-Directory&lt;DateTimeOriginal' -d %Y/%m/%d dir
            Move  all  files  in  "dir"  into  a  directory  hierarchy  based  on  year,  month   and   day   of
            "DateTimeOriginal".   eg) This command would move the file "dir/image.jpg" with a "DateTimeOriginal"
            of "2005:10:12 16:05:56" to "2005/10/12/image.jpg".

       exiftool -o . '-Directory&lt;DateTimeOriginal' -d %Y/%m/%d dir
            Same effect as above except files are copied instead of moved.

       exiftool '-filename&lt;%f_${model;}.%e' dir
            Rename all files in "dir" by adding the camera model name to the file name.  The semicolon after the
            tag name inside the braces causes characters which are invalid in Windows file names to  be  deleted
            from the tag value (see the "Advanced formatting feature" for an explanation).

       exiftool '-FileName&lt;CreateDate' -d %Y%m%d_%H%M%S%%-c.%%e dir
            Rename  all  images  in "dir" according to the "CreateDate" date and time, adding a copy number with
            leading '-' if the file already exists ("%-c"), and preserving the  original  file  extension  (%e).
            Note the extra '%' necessary to escape the filename codes (%c and %e) in the date format string.

       exiftool -r '-FileName&lt;CreateDate' -d %Y-%m-%d/%H%M_%%f.%%e dir
            Both  the  directory  and  the  filename  may  be changed together via the "FileName" tag if the new
            "FileName" contains a '/'.  The example above recursively renames  all  images  in  a  directory  by
            adding  a  "CreateDate" timestamp to the start of the filename, then moves them into new directories
            named by date.

       exiftool '-FileName&lt;${CreateDate}_$filenumber.jpg' -d %Y%m%d -ext jpg .
            Set the filename of all JPG images in the current directory from the CreateDate and FileNumber tags,
            in the form "20060507_118-1861.jpg".

</pre><h4><b>GEOTAGGING</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       ExifTool implements geotagging from GPS log files via 3 special tags: Geotag (which  for  convenience  is
       also  implemented  as  an  exiftool  option),  Geosync  and  Geotime.  The  examples below highlight some
       geotagging features.  See &lt;https://exiftool.org/geotag.html&gt; for additional  documentation.   (Note  that
       geotagging  from  known  GPS  coordinates  is done by writing the GPS tags directly rather than using the
       <b>-geotag</b> option.)

       exiftool -geotag track.log a.jpg
            Geotag an image ("a.jpg") from position information in a GPS track  log  ("track.log").   Since  the
            "Geotime"  tag is not specified, the value of DateTimeOriginal is used for geotagging.  Local system
            time is assumed unless DateTimeOriginal contains a timezone.

       exiftool -geotag track.log -geolocate=geotag a.jpg
            Geotag  an  image  and  also  write  geolocation  information  of  the  nearest  city  (city   name,
            state/province   and   country).   Read  here  for  more  details  about  the  Geolocation  feature:
            &lt;https://exiftool.org/geolocation.html#Write&gt;

       exiftool -geotag t.log -geotime='2009:04:02 13:41:12-05:00' a.jpg
            Geotag an image with the GPS position for a specific time.

       exiftool -geotag log.gpx '-xmp:geotime&lt;createdate' dir
            Geotag all images in directory "dir" with XMP  tags  instead  of  EXIF  tags,  based  on  the  image
            CreateDate.

       exiftool -geotag a.log -geosync=-20 dir
            Geotag  images  in  directory  "dir", accounting for image timestamps which were 20 seconds ahead of
            GPS.

       exiftool -geotag a.log -geosync=1.jpg -geosync=2.jpg dir
            Geotag images using time synchronization from two previously geotagged  images  (1.jpg  and  2.jpg),
            synchronizing the image and GPS times using a linear time drift correction.

       exiftool -geotag a.log '-geotime&lt;${createdate}+01:00' dir
            Geotag  images  in  "dir"  using  CreateDate  with  the  specified  timezone.  If CreateDate already
            contained a timezone, then the timezone specified on the command line is ignored.

       exiftool -geotag= a.jpg
            Delete GPS tags which may have been added by the geotag feature.  Note that this does not remove all
            GPS tags -- to do this instead use "-gps:all=".

       exiftool -xmp:geotag= a.jpg
            Delete XMP GPS tags which were added by the geotag feature.

       exiftool -xmp:geotag=track.log a.jpg
            Geotag an image with XMP tags, using the time from DateTimeOriginal.

       exiftool -geotag a.log -geotag b.log -r dir
            Combine multiple track logs and geotag an entire directory tree of images.

       exiftool -geotag 'tracks/*.log' -r dir
            Read all track logs from the "tracks" directory.

       exiftool -p gpx.fmt dir &gt; out.gpx
            Generate a GPX track log from all images in directory "dir".  This example uses the  "gpx.fmt"  file
            included  in  the  full  ExifTool distribution package and assumes that the images in "dir" have all
            been previously geotagged.

</pre><h4><b>PIPING</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       cat a.jpg | exiftool -
            Extract information from stdin.

       exiftool image.jpg -thumbnailimage -b | exiftool -
            Extract information from an embedded thumbnail image.

       cat a.jpg | exiftool -iptc:keywords+=fantastic - &gt; b.jpg
            Add an IPTC keyword in a pipeline, saving output to a new file.

       curl -s <a href="http://a.domain.com/bigfile.jpg">http://a.domain.com/bigfile.jpg</a> | exiftool -fast -
            Extract information from an image over the internet  using  the  cURL  utility.   The  <b>-fast</b>  option
            prevents  exiftool  from  scanning  for  trailer information, so only the meta information header is
            transferred.

       exiftool a.jpg -thumbnailimage -b | exiftool -comment=wow - | exiftool a.jpg -thumbnailimage'&lt;=-'
            Add a comment to an embedded thumbnail image.  (Why anyone would want to do this I don't  know,  but
            I've included this as an example to illustrate the flexibility of ExifTool.)

</pre><h4><b>INTERRUPTING</b> <b>EXIFTOOL</b></h4><pre>
       Interrupting  exiftool  with  a  CTRL-C or SIGINT will not result in partially written files or temporary
       files remaining on the hard disk.  The exiftool application traps SIGINT and defers it until the  end  of
       critical processes if necessary, then does a proper cleanup before exiting.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The  exiftool  application  exits  with  a status of 0 on success, or 1 if an error occurred, or 2 if all
       files failed the <b>-if</b> condition (for any of the commands if <b>-execute</b> was used).
