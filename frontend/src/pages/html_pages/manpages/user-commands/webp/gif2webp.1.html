       gif2webp - Convert a GIF image to WebP

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gif2webp</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>input_file.gif</u> <u>-o</u> <u>output_file.webp</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents the <b>gif2webp</b> command.

       <b>gif2webp</b> converts a GIF image to a WebP image.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The basic options are:

       <b>-o</b> <u>string</u>
              Specify  the  name  of the output WebP file. If omitted, <b>gif2webp</b> will perform conversion but only
              report statistics.  Using "-" as output name will direct output to 'stdout'.

       <b>--</b> <u>string</u>
              Explicitly specify the input file. This option is useful if the input file starts with an '-'  for
              instance. This option must appear <b>last</b>.  Any other options afterward will be ignored. If the input
              file is "-", the data will be read from <u>stdin</u> instead of a file.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>-help</b>
              Usage information.

       <b>-version</b>
              Print the version number (as major.minor.revision) and exit.

       <b>-lossy</b> Encode the image using lossy compression.

       <b>-mixed</b> Mixed  compression  mode:  optimize  compression  of the image by picking either lossy or lossless
              compression for each frame heuristically.

       <b>-near_lossless</b> <u>int</u>
              Specify the level of near-lossless image preprocessing. This option adjusts pixel values  to  help
              compressibility,  but  has  minimal impact on the visual quality. It triggers lossless compression
              mode automatically. The range is 0 (maximum preprocessing) to 100 (no preprocessing, the default).
              The typical value is around 60. Note that lossy with <b>-q</b> <b>100</b> can at times yield better results.

       <b>-sharp_yuv</b>
              Use more accurate and sharper RGB-&gt;YUV conversion. Note that  this  process  is  slower  than  the
              default 'fast' RGB-&gt;YUV conversion.

       <b>-q</b> <u>float</u>
              Specify the compression factor for RGB channels between 0 and 100. The default is 75.
              In  case  of  lossless compression (default), a small factor enables faster compression speed, but
              produces a larger file. Maximum compression is achieved by using a value of 100.
              In case of lossy compression (specified by the -lossy option), a small factor produces  a  smaller
              file with lower quality. Best quality is achieved by using a value of 100.

       <b>-m</b> <u>int</u> Specify  the  compression  method  to  use. This parameter controls the trade off between encoding
              speed and the compressed file size and quality.  Possible values range from 0 to 6. Default  value
              is  4.   When  higher  values  are  used,  the  encoder will spend more time inspecting additional
              encoding possibilities and decide  on  the  quality  gain.   Lower  value  can  result  is  faster
              processing time at the expense of larger file size and lower compression quality.

       <b>-min_size</b>
              Encode  image  to  achieve  smallest size. This disables key frame insertion and picks the dispose
              method resulting in the smallest output for each frame. It uses lossless compression  by  default,
              but can be combined with -q, -m, -lossy or -mixed options.

       <b>-kmin</b> <u>int</u>

       <b>-kmax</b> <u>int</u>
              Specify  the  minimum and maximum distance between consecutive key frames (independently decodable
              frames) in the output animation. The tool will insert some key frames into the output animation as
              needed so that this criteria is satisfied.
              A 'kmax' value of 0 will turn off insertion of key frames. A 'kmax' value of 1 will result in  all
              frames  being  key  frames.  'kmin'  value  is not taken into account in both these special cases.
              Typical values are in the range 3 to 30. Default values are kmin =  9,  kmax  =  17  for  lossless
              compression and kmin = 3, kmax = 5 for lossy compression.
              These two options are relevant only for animated images with large number of frames (&gt;50).
              When  lower values are used, more frames will be converted to key frames. This may lead to smaller
              number of  frames  required  to  decode  a  frame  on  average,  thereby  improving  the  decoding
              performance.  But  this  may  lead to slightly bigger file sizes.  Higher values may lead to worse
              decoding performance, but smaller file sizes.
              Some restrictions:
              (i) kmin &lt; kmax,
              (ii) kmin &gt;= kmax / 2 + 1 and
              (iii) kmax - kmin &lt;= 30.
              If any of these restrictions are not met, they will be enforced automatically.

       <b>-metadata</b> <u>string</u>
              A comma separated list of metadata to copy from the input to the output if present.  Valid values:
              <b>all</b>, <b>none</b>, <b>icc</b>, <b>xmp</b>.  The default is <b>xmp</b>.

       <b>-f</b> <u>int</u> For lossy encoding only (specified by the -lossy option). Specify the strength of  the  deblocking
              filter,  between  0  (no  filtering)  and 100 (maximum filtering).  A value of 0 will turn off any
              filtering. Higher value will increase the strength of the filtering process applied after decoding
              the picture. The higher the value the smoother the picture will appear. Typical values are usually
              in the range of 20 to 50.

       <b>-mt</b>    Use multi-threading for encoding, if possible.

       <b>-loop_compatibility</b>
              If enabled, handle the loop information in a compatible fashion for Chrome version  prior  to  M62
              (inclusive) and Firefox.

       <b>-v</b>     Print extra information.

       <b>-quiet</b> Do not print anything.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       If there were no problems during execution, <b>gif2webp</b> exits with the value of the C constant <b>EXIT_SUCCESS</b>.
       This is usually zero.

       If an error occurs, <b>gif2webp</b> exits with the value of the C constant <b>EXIT_FAILURE</b>. This is usually one.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       gif2webp picture.gif -o picture.webp
       gif2webp -q 70 picture.gif -o picture.webp
       gif2webp -lossy -m 3 picture.gif -o picture_lossy.webp
