</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ttcn3_profmerge - TTCN-3 profiler and code coverage merge tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ttcn3_profmerge</b> [ <b>-pc</b> ] [ <b>-o</b> <u>file</u> ] [ <b>-s</b> <u>file</u> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>filter</u> ] <u>db_file1</u> [ <u>db_file2</u> ... ]
       or
       <b>ttcn3_profmerge</b> <b>-v</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page is a quick reference for the TTCN-3 profmerge utility of the TTCN-3 Test Executor. The
       <b>ttcn3_profmerge</b> utility, which  can  be  found  in  <u>$TTCN3_DIR/bin,</u>  merges  all  input  files  (profiler
       databases)  given  in  the  command  argument  into  a  single output file. It can also generate profiler
       statistics from the merged database.
       Since there are two possible outputs, neither of them are written to the standard output.
       It is useful for test suites that are run on multiple Host Controllers (in parallel mode).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Available command line switches are:

       <b>-p</b>        Discards profiler data from the merged database. All execution times will be set to zero in the
                 output database file, and statistics related to execution times will  not  be  generated  (both
                 profiler and code coverage data cannot be discarded, since there would be no data left).

       <b>-c</b>        Discards  code coverage data from the merged database. All execution counts will be set to zero
                 in the output database file, and statistics related to execution counts will not  be  generated
                 (both profiler and code coverage data cannot be discarded, since there would be no data left).

       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>   Prints  the  output (merged) database to the specified <u>file</u>.  At least one output file (this or
                 the statistics file) must be set.

       <b>-s</b> <u>file</u>   Prints statistics for the merged database into the specified <u>file</u>.  At least  one  output  file
                 (this or the output database file) must be set.

       <b>-f</b> <u>filter</u> Specifies  which statistics entries are generated. The <u>filter</u> is a hexadecimal number, the last
                 25 bits each correspond to the 25 entries in the statistics file  (the  least  significant  bit
                 corresponds to the first entry, and so on). The filter is ignored if the statistics file is not
                 set.

       <b>-v</b>        Prints <u>version</u> and license key information and exits.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       TTCN3_DIR
              The  installation  directory where the uncompressed binary package of the TTCN-3 Test Executor can
              be found.

       TTCN3_LICENSE_FILE
              Points to the <u>file</u> (<b>NB:</b> <u>not</u> the directory) that contains the  personalized  license  key  for  the
              current user or host.
