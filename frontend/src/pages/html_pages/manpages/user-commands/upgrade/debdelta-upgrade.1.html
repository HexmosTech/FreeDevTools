</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       debdelta-upgrade - Downloads all deltas that may be used to 'apt-get upgrade', and apply them.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>debdelta-upgrade</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>PACKAGE</u>] ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  is  designed  to  download changes (deltas) that may be used to <b>apt-get</b> <b>upgrade</b> all listed
       packages, and apply them.  If no package is listed in the  command  line,  then  it  will  apply  to  all
       upgradable packages. See <b><a href="../man1/debdelta.1.html">debdelta</a></b>(1) for more details on the delta files.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--dir</b> <u>DIR</u>
              directory  where  to  save  results.  (default: <a href="file:/var/cache/apt/archives">/var/cache/apt/archives</a> for root, /tmp/archive for
              non-root users)

       <b>--format</b> <u>FORMAT</u>
              format of recreated debs. FORMAT=deb is the usual, FORMAT=unzipped means that the data.tar part is
              not compressed, (and this may save some time)

       <b>--deb-policy</b> <u>POLICY</u>
              policy to decide which debs to download, it is a comma separated list of (abbreviations of)
                  source =  there is no /etc/debdelta/sources.conf line
                  big =  the delta is too big
                  error =  the delta fails to apply in the client
                  tiny = the new package is small (the server ignores such packages)
                  fail = the server failed to create the delta
                  queued = the delta is queued to be made in the server
                  unavailable = all other cases
                  after = continue downloading debs after patching has ended
                default is s,b,e,t,f

       <b>-v</b>     verbose (can be added multiple times).

       <b>-d</b>     print full traceback on Python errors; save useful info in temporary files in case  that  a  delta
              fails.

       <b>-k</b>     keep temporary files (use for debugging).

        <b>-A</b> <b>--accept-unsigned</b>
              accept unsigned deltas.

        <b>--gpg-home</b>
              specify  a different home for GnuPG, default for root is <u>/etc/debdelta/gnupg</u> while for other users
              is unset. See <u>--homedir</u> in <b><a href="../man1/gpg.1.html">gpg</a>(1)</b> for details.

        <b>--forensic</b> <u>METHOD</u>
              if a delta fails, report logs so that the problem may be addressed.  Method may be
                do
                    just prepare logs and say where they are (default)
                mutt
                    send logs by email using mutt
                icedove
                    send logs by email using icedove (as root!)
                http
                    send by http (currently not working)

       <b>--timeout</b> <u>SECONDS</u>
                 adjust timeout for connections, default is 15 seconds

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       When invoked as root, <u>apt-get</u> <u>update</u> <u>&amp;&amp;</u> <u>debdelta-upgrade</u> <u>&amp;&amp;</u> <u>apt-get</u> <u>upgrade</u> will  download  delta  files,
       recreate  the  needed  Debian  packages,  and  then  upgrade  your  Debian  host. When only slow Internet
       connection is available, the above procedure may be significantly faster than "apt-get update &amp;&amp;  apt-get
       upgrade".  (Use -v to see how much faster.)

       The package manager <u>cupt</u> uses deltas as well when upgrading.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       A  Debian package that is recreated using <u>debdelta-upgrade</u> is byte-by-byte identical to the original one;
       when  "apt-get upgrade" is subsequently invoked, the cryptographic archive  authentication  support  (see
       <u>apt-secure</u>  <u>(8)</u>  )  will  guarantee  that  it  can be trusted to be installed.  Moreover, the delta files
       themselves are cryptographically protected using GnuPG, MD5 and SHA1 (using  the  same  method  as  <b><a href="../man1/dpkgsig.1.html">dpkg-</a></b>
       <b><a href="../man1/dpkgsig.1.html">sig</a></b>(1) ), and <u>debdelta-upgrade</u> will refuse to apply corrupted or unsigned deltas (but, see option <b>-A</b> ).

</pre><h4><b>DOWNLOAD</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PROXIES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>debdelta-upgrade</u>  downloads  deltas  in  two passes: in the first pass, it downloads the first kB of each
       delta, to extract the delta parameters and to examine them. If  the  delta  does  not  exist,  it  checks
       existence  of  flag  timestamps  in the remote server (such as <u>debdelta-too-big</u> <u>debdelta-queued</u> <u>debdelta-</u>
       <u>failed</u> ), and then it examines the <u>--deb-policy</u> to decide if to download the deb instead.  In the  second
       pass, it downloads (the rest of) the deltas and queues them in a patching queue.

       For  plain  direct  http  downloads,  <u>debdelta-upgrade</u>  uses  the  Python  library 'httplib' directly; in
       particular, it uses keep-alive features, and this speeds up a lot the first pass.

       If  variables such as <u>http_proxy</u> are set in the environment,  then instead <u>debdelta-upgrade</u> will use  the
       'urllib2' module: this though slows down sensibly the first pass above (since 'urllib2' opens a different
       connection  for  each  download);  moreover  'urllib2'  seems to be buggy in some places (for example, it
       transforms http response "401"  into "404" , and "302" into "200") so the output explanation  printed  by
       <u>debdelta-upgrade</u>  in  case  of download error may be wrong; and most of the opetions for <u>--deb-policy</u> are
       currently disabled (until the author understands 'urllib2' better).
