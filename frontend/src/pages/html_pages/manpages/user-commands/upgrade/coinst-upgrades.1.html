</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       coinst-upgrades - finding upgrade issues between to versions of a Debian distribution

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>coinst-upgrades</b> [<u>options</u>] <b>-o</b> <u>file</u> <u>control-file1</u> <u>control-file2</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>coinst-upgrades</b>  takes  as  input  two  Debian  control  files  corresponding to two versions of a Debian
       repository and output a report listing all packages that coult  be  installed  together  in  the  initial
       version  of  the  repository (specified by <u>control-file1</u>) and that can no longer be installed together in
       the final version of the repository (specified by <u>control-file2</u>), and explaining why they can  no  longer
       be installed together.

       If the control files are compressed, they will be automatically uncompressed by the tool.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--break</b> <u>sets</u>
              Specify  that  some  packages does not have to be compatible any longer and that the corresponding
              issue should be omitted from the report.  The argument <u>sets</u> is a comma-separated list of  sets  of
              packages.  Each set is either a list of binary package names separated by a vertical bar symbol |,
              or a wildcard _ standing for any package.  We explain this option through examples.  You can write
              <b>--break</b> <u>libjpeg62-dev</u> to state that package <u>libjpeg62-dev</u> does not  have  to  remain  installable.
              But  it  is  usually  better to indicate that the package should remain installable but that it is
              fine if it is no longer installable with some other packages: <b>--break</b> <u>libjpeg62-dev,</u><b>_</b>.  You can be
              even more precise and specify that two given packages can become incompatible, but that any  other
              incompatibility should be reported: <b>--break</b> <u>parallel,moreutils</u>.  Finally, you can use the vertical
              bar symbol to factorize several sets of packages: <b>--break</b> <u>'unoconv,python-uno|docvert-libreoffice'</u>
              means  that  package  <u>unoconv</u>  does  not  have  to remain installable together with <u>python-uno</u> nor
              <u>docvert-libreoffice</u>.

       <b>--debug</b> <u>name</u>
              Activate debug option <u>name</u>.  Use <b>--debug</b> <b>help</b> to list available debug options.

       <b>-help</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print a usage message  briefly  summarizing  the command-line options.

       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>
              Write the report to this file.

       <b>--popcon</b> <u>file</u>
              Use popcon data from this file to order issues.
