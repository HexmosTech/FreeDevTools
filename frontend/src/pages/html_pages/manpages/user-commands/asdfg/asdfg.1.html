</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       asdfg - a lightweight visual editor optimized for the QWERTY keyboard

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>asdfg</b> [ <b>-k</b> ] [ <b>-o</b> ] [ <b>-r</b> ] [ <b>-s</b> | <b>-S</b> ] [ <b>-t</b> <u>tab</u> <u>stop</u> ] [ <b>-u</b> | <b>-U</b> ] [ <b>-w</b> <u>command</u> ] [<u>file...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>asdfg</b> is an interactive display text editor optimized for users of the QWERTY keyboard layout.

       When run with no file name arguments, <b>asdfg</b> displays a short command introduction and summary.

       <b>asdfg</b>  can  browse  very  large  read-only  files  with quick start-up time, since the original texts are
       memory-mapped from files and not duplicated in memory unless they are about to be modified.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-k</b>     Disable keyword highlighting.

       <b>-o</b>     Do not save the original contents of a modified file in <u>file</u>~.

       <b>-r</b>     Read-only mode: do not modify the file on disk.

       <b>-s</b>     Use spaces, not tabs, for automatic indentation, even if the file seems to currently use tabs.

       <b>-S</b>     Use tabs, not spaces, for automatic indentation, even if the file seems to currently use spaces.

       <b>-t</b> <u>8</u>   Set the tab stop to 8 or to some unreasonable value.  This setting can be overridden on a per-text
              basis later.

       <b>-u</b>     Treat files as UTF-8 even if they contain invalid UTF-8 encodings.

       <b>-U</b>     Don't treat files as UTF-8 even if they look like it.

       <b>-w</b> <u>writability</u> <u>command</u>
              When an attempt is made to modify a read-only file, use this command (within which the  string  <b>%s</b>
              will be replaced with the path name of the file) to attempt to put the file into a writable state.
              This is useful for interacting with source code control systems (e.g., <b>p4</b> <b>edit</b> <b>%s</b>).

</pre><h4><b>INTENTIONALLY</b> <b>MISSING</b> <b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>asdfg</b>  has no embedded extension language, since it is trivial to pass regions of text from the editor to
       any program or script that can read standard input and write standard output.  The shell, <b>sed</b><u>(1),</u> <b>awk</b><u>(1),</u>
       <b>python</b><u>(1),</u> and <b>perl</b><u>(1)</u> are all usable for such scripting.  Further, since <b>asdfg</b> ships will  full  sources
       and the rights to modify it, users can customize it directly.

       The  editor  has  only  basic  syntax highlighting of C and C++ keywords with subtle color cues that help
       match up parentheses, brackets, and braces.

       <b>asdfg</b> has no mail or news reader, IRC client, or artificial intelligence psychologist mode.

       There is no X window system interface; that's what <b>xterm</b><u>(1)</u> and <b>gnome-terminal</b><u>(1)</u> are used for.

</pre><h4><b>BASICS</b></h4><pre>
       A <u>text</u> is a sequence of characters to be viewed or edited, such as a file.   If  it  is  not  ASCII,  the
       editor  will  automatically  determine  whether it is encoded in legal UTF-8 and do the right thing.  The
       editor can also automatically detect DOS-style line endings.

       A <u>view</u> comprises all or part of a text.  A text in the editor has at least one view, and possibly more.

       A <u>window</u> is a rectangular portion of the display,  and  is  always  associated  with  a  single  view,  a
       contiguous portion of whose text is rendered in the window.  Not every view has a window.

       Each  view  has  a  <u>cursor</u>  and possibly a <u>selection</u>, which has the cursor at one end and the <u>mark</u> at the
       other.  The view's window, if any, always renders part of the text containing the view's cursor.

       The selection plays a critical role in <b>asdfg</b>.  Besides highlighting regions to be cut or copied, it  also
       serves to supply arguments to some commands, such as the path name of a file to open.

       The  <u>clip</u> <u>buffer</u> is not visible in any window.  It receives snippets of data that have been cut or copied
       out of texts, so that they may be moved or copied elsewhere.  It also supplies the standard  input  to  a
       background command launched with <b>^R</b> (below).  There is one clip buffer shared by all views.

</pre><h4><b>COLOR</b> <b>CUES</b></h4><pre>
       asdfg  uses  colors  to  convey  information  without cluttering the display with status lines or borders
       between windows.

       asdfg uses distinct background colors  to  distinguish  tiled  windows.   The  active  window  is  always
       presented  in the terminal's default color scheme.  Color is also used to highlight the current selection
       (in cyan) and folded regions (in red).

       Needless tabs and spaces are marked in violet.  These include any tabs or spaces  before  the  end  of  a
       line, as well as any spaces followed by a tab or multiple spaces that could be replaced by a tab.

       Bracketing  characters  are  presented  in alternating colors so that matching parentheses, brackets, and
       braces are colored identically.

       A red cursor signifies a read-only text, whereas a green cursor indicates a dirty text (meaning one  that
       needs saving, not one unfit for young persons).

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>asdfg</b> understands the arrow, page up and down, and Delete keys on your keyboard, so you can actually just
       use  it  like  a  dumb notepad with no mouse if you don't want to read any further than the next section,
       which tells you how to leave the editor.

       In the following sections of the manual, commands are denoted by <b>^key</b> to signify the use of Control, Alt,
       or a preceding Escape key.  They all mean the same thing.

       <b>Variant</b> commands always begin with <b>^Space</b>, or its synonym, <b>^@</b>.  A few commands take a  numeric  argument,
       which  is  specified  by  <b>^Space</b> followed by a decimal or hexadecimal number, the latter using C language
       syntax (0xdeadbeef).

       Many commands are sensitive to the presence or absence of a <b>selection</b>.

</pre><h4><b>LEAVING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>^Space^\</b>
              aborts the editor, leaving no original file modified since the last time <b>^W</b> was used.

       <b>^Q</b>     suspends the editor and returns the terminal to the  shell  that  invoked  it.   Use  the  shell's
              foreground command, probably <b>fg</b>, to resume editing.

       <b>^Space^Q</b>
              saves all modified texts and terminates the editor.

</pre><h4><b>NAVIGATION</b></h4><pre>
       The "backward and forward by unit" commands treat a numeric argument, if any, as a repeat count.

       <b>^G</b>     moves the cursor backward by characters.

       <b>^H</b>     moves the cursor forward by characters.

       <b>^Space^G</b>
              moves the cursor up a line on the screen.

       <b>^Space^H</b>
              moves the cursor down a line on the screen.

       <b>^K</b>     moves the cursor backward by words.

       <b>^L</b>     moves the cursor forward by words.

       <b>^Space^K</b>
              moves the cursor backward one sentence.

       <b>^Space^L</b>
              moves the cursor forward one sentence.

       <b>^T</b>     moves  the  cursor  back  to  the  beginning  of the line.  If already there, it moves back to the
              beginning of the previous line.

       <b>^Y</b>     moves the cursor forward to the end of the line.  If already there, it moves forward to the end of
              the next line.

       <b>^Space^T</b>
              moves the cursor back to the beginning of the paragraph.  If already there, it moves back  to  the
              beginning of the previous paragraph.

       <b>^Space^Y</b>
              moves  the  cursor forward to the end of the paragraph.  If already there, it moves forward to the
              end of the next paragraph.

       <b>^O</b>     moves the window backward by screenfulls.

       <b>^P</b>     moves the window forward by screenfulls.

       <b>^Space^O</b>
              moves to the very beginning of the view.

       <b>^Space^P</b>
              moves to the very end of the view.

       <b>^]</b>     moves to the corresponding parenthesis, bracket, or brace, respecting nesting, if the cursor  sits
              atop such a character.  Otherwise, it moves to the nearest enclosing bracketing character.

       <b>^N</b>     recenters  the  window so that the line containing the cursor lies in the middle of its portion of
              the display.

       <b>^Space^N</b>
              causes the current window to occupy the entire display and recenters the window.  With  a  numeric
              argument,  however, it simply moves the cursor to the indicated line in the view, with 1 being the
              number of the first line.

       <b>^Space=</b>
              (note that <b>=</b> is not a control character) sets a  bookmark  on  the  current  selection  or  cursor
              position.  A numeric argument may be used to manage multiple bookmarks.

       <b>^Space-</b>
              (note that <b>-</b> is not a control character) returns to a previously set bookmark, possibly identified
              with a numeric argument.

       <b>^Space'</b>
              (note that the single quote <b>'</b> is not a control character) looks an identifier up the identifier in
              the  <b>TAGS</b>  files,  which  are sought in the same directory as the current view and then all of its
              parents, until one is found that contains the identifier.  A new little window is opened for  each
              of the identifier's entries in the TAGS file.

       The  <b>TAGS</b>  files  should  be  generated  with  the <b>ctags</b> or <b>exuberant-ctags</b> utilities and their <b>-x</b> output
       format.  If there is a selection, it is deleted from the view and its entire contents will constitute the
       identifier to be looked up; otherwise, the identifier that is immediately before or around the cursor  is
       sought.

</pre><h4><b>SELECTION</b></h4><pre>
       These commands are sensitive to the presence or absence of a current selection.

       <b>^U</b>     begins  a  new  selection  if  non  exists,  setting its mark at the current cursor, which is then
              typically navigated to its intended other end.  <b>^U</b> in the presence of selection simply removes the
              mark.

       <b>^Space^U</b>
              without a selection causes the entire current line to be selected by placing the mark at  the  end
              of  the  line and the cursor at its beginning.  It is the same as the command sequence <b>^Y^U^T</b> with
              no selection.  With a selection present, <b>^Space^U</b> exchanges its cursor with its mark.

       Note that <b>^Space^U</b> with a numeric argument unconditionally unsets the mark,  which  can  be  handy  in  a
       macro.

       <b>^Space^X</b>
              with no selection causes all of the contiguous white space characters surrounding the cursor to be
              selected, with the cursor at the beginning so that they can be easily replaced by retyping.

</pre><h4><b>UNDO</b></h4><pre>
       <b>asdfg</b> has infinite undo capabilities.

       <b>^Z</b>     reverses  the effects of the last command, apart from <b>^Z</b> itself, that modified the current text in
              any of its views.

       <b>^Space^Z</b>
              reverses the effects of the most recent undo.  After <b>^Z</b>, any <u>other</u> command that modifies the  text
              will permanently commit the undo(s).

</pre><h4><b>MODIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       In  the  default  mode,  characters  typed without a command indicator are inserted at the current cursor
       position.  Further, if the cursor is at the beginning of a selection, the selection is first cut  to  the
       clip buffer, so that the new text replaces it.

       <b>^^</b>     (that's  Control-Shift-6,  the caret character, on most keyboards, and ^6 will probably also work)
              inserts an otherwise untypeable control character into the text.  The very next key to be  pressed
              is either taken literally, if it is a control character, or converted to a control character if it
              is  not,  and  inserted.   (For  example, you can press <b>^^</b> and then hit either Control-A or just a
              plain A, to get the character code 0x01 inserted.)

       <b>^Space^^</b>
              with a numeric argument, probably in hexadecimal, inserts the specified Unicode character into the
              text in UTF-8 format.  If the text is not UTF-8, the character code is inserted directly as a big-
              endian literal.

       <b>Tab</b>    (or <b>^I</b>) attempts to perform tab completion; if that fails, a TAB character is inserted.  If  there
              is  a  selection  with the cursor at its end, the editor tries to find an unambiguous continuation
              based on path names and words in all the views.  A continuation, if  found,  is  appended  to  the
              selection,  to  facilitate  opening a file with <b>^E</b>.  With no selection, but the cursor immediately
              after one or more identifier characters, the editor searches for an unambiguous continuation using
              the words in the views.  A continuation, if found, is inserted  as  the  new  selection  with  the
              cursor  at  its end.  No tab completion occurs when the cursor is at the beginning of a selection;
              in that case, the selection is cut and replaced with a single TAB character.

       <b>^SpaceTab</b>
              (or <b>^Space^I</b>) will align the current line to the indentation of the previous one.  With a  numeric
              argument  of  1,  it  toggles  the  text's  use of tab characters for indentation.  With a numeric
              argument between 2 and 20, it will set the tab stop pitch.

       <b>Enter</b>  (or <b>^M</b>) inserts a new line into the text without automatic indentation.

       <b>^J</b>     (or <b>^Enter</b> under some good terminal emulators) inserts a new line into  the  text  with  automatic
              indentation.   If  <b>^J</b> is executed immediately after a <b>{</b> character that does not yet have a closing
              <b>}</b>, <b>^J</b> will also add a properly-indented closing brace.

       <b>Backspace</b>
              (or more properly, its synonym <b>^?</b>  and sometimes, as in Mac  OS  X's  Terminal  application,  <b>^/</b>),
              deletes the character immediately before the cursor.

       <b>^X</b>     with  no selection deletes the character "under" the cursor.  When a selection exists, <b>^X</b> moves it
              into the clip buffer, discarding any previously clipped text.

       <b>^Space^X</b>
              with no selection will select surrounding white space, as described  earlier.   When  a  selection
              exists,  <b>^Space^X</b>  moves it into the clip buffer, putting it before any old text if the cursor was
              at its beginning and appending it to the clip buffer if the cursor was at its end.  The intent  is
              for  multiple  <b>^Space^X</b> commands to collect data together in the same order in which they are most
              likely to have been visited.

       A numeric argument to <b>^Space^X</b> places the indicated number of copies  of  the  selection  into  the  clip
       buffer.

       <b>^C</b>     requires a selection, which is copied into the clip buffer and then unmarked.

       <b>^Space^C</b>
              is  to  <b>^C</b>  what <b>^Space^X</b> is to <b>^X</b>.  It copies the selection to the clip buffer, putting it at the
              beginning or the end in the same way as <b>^Space^X</b> (above).  A numeric argument to  <b>^Space^C</b>  places
              the indicated number of copies of the selection into the clip buffer.

       <b>^V</b>     with  no  selection  will  paste  the  current  clip  buffer's contents.  But in the presence of a
              selection it performs a more general function: the contents of the selection and the  clip  buffer
              are exchanged.  With a numeric argument, <b>^V</b> pastes or exchanges with a numbered <u>register</u>, which is
              an  alternate  clip  buffer.   (The  main clip buffer is the same as register 0.)  Besides being a
              means for preserving some text for longer periods of editing, the registers also serve as a  means
              for extracting the text that matches a parenthesized subpattern in a regular expression search.

</pre><h4><b>SEARCHING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>^_</b>     and  its synonyms <b>^/</b>, <b>^-</b>, and <b>^A</b> enter search mode.  The many synonyms are defined because they're
              often synonymous or reserved key sequences in  the  various  window  managers  and  the  <b><a href="../man1/screen.1.html">screen</a></b>(1)
              utility.

       (Specifically,  <b>^/</b>  gets mapped to <b>^_</b> by many X terminal emulators, while <b>^-</b> gets mapped to <b>^_</b> by the Mac
       OS X Terminal application.  <b>^A</b> is the default escape sequence in <b><a href="../man1/screen.1.html">screen</a></b>(1).)

       The variant version of this command (<b>^Space^_</b> and its synonyms) searches for occurrences of POSIX regular
       expressions.  Each non-command character that is typed thereafter will be appended to the current  search
       target string and the selection is moved to the next occurrence thereof.

       The case of alphabetic characters is <u>not</u> significant to the search.

       Most  command  characters will automatically take the editor out of search mode before executing, and the
       most recently discovered occurrence of the search target string will be its selection.

       A few commands have different meanings in search mode:

       <b>Backspace</b>
              will remove the last character from the search target and move the selection back to its  previous
              position.

       <b>^U</b>     is  typically  used  to  leave  search  mode  with  the currently highlighted search target as the
              selection.

       <b>^_</b>     (or its synonyms) with no characters in the search target string will cause  the  last  successful
              search's target string to be reused.

       <b>^G</b>     and  <b>^H</b> cause motion to the previous and next occurrences of the search target string, not single-
              character motion.

       <b>Enter</b>  (and <b>^_</b> and its synonyms) simply leaves search mode with the cursor at the latest  hit,  with  the
              mark returned to where it was before the search (if anywhere).  This is useful for using search to
              place the bounds of a selection.

</pre><h4><b>TEXTS,</b> <b>VIEWS,</b> <b>and</b> <b>WINDOWS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>^W</b>     saves <u>all</u> modified texts back to their files.

       <b>^Space^W</b>
              saves just the current text.

       <b>^E</b>     with  no  selection  inserts,  as  the  new  selection, the path name of the current text.  With a
              selection containing a path name, possibly constructed  with  the  assistance  of  tab  completion
              (above),  <b>^E</b> will raise up a window containing a view into the indicated file, creating a new text
              to hold it if one does not already exist.

       <b>^Space^E</b>
              with a selection will rename the current text, so that it will be saved in another file.

       <b>^F</b>     finds an invisible view and associates it  with  the  current  window,  making  its  current  view
              invisible.   Hitting <b>^F</b> repeatedly will cycle through all of the views.  If there was no invisible
              view, <b>^F</b> creates a new scratch text, as does <b>^Space;</b> below.

       <b>^Space^F</b>
              does the same thing. but will close the window's current view, and also its text  if  it  was  the
              last view thereof.

       <b>^D</b>     splits  the  current window horizontally, raising up an invisible or new view in the lower half of
              the original window.

       <b>^Space^D</b>
              splits the current window vertically, raising up an invisible or new view in the right half of the
              original window.

       <b>^S</b>     moves to another window.

       <b>^S</b>     with a numeric argument moves to a specific window; number 1 is in the upper left-hand  corner  of
              the display.

       <b>^Space^S</b>
              moves to another window, closing the old one.

       <b>^Space;</b>
              (note that <b>;</b> is not a control character) creates a new anonymous text.

       <b>^Space#</b>
              (note  that  the  number sign <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>character)</b> displays the current positions path name
              and line number.

       <b>^Space?</b>
              (note that the question mark <b>?</b>  is not a control character) displays a new window with the  built-
              in help summary of commands.

</pre><h4><b>MACROS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>^Space^B</b>
              commences  the  recording  of  your  keystrokes as the macro, which continues until the next <b>^B</b> or
              another macro recording.

       <b>^SpaceF1-F12</b>
              commences the recording of your keystrokes as a new macro for a function key.  Note  that  <b>F1</b>  and
              <b>F11</b>  are  typically  hijacked  by  window managers for their own purposes and probably will not be
              usable.

       <b>^B</b>     ends the recording of a macro, if one is in progress.  Afterwards, <b>^B</b> replays the macro,  possibly
              with  a  repeat  count  as  the argument.  Note that a failed search in a macro will terminate its
              execution.

</pre><h4><b>FOLDING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>asdfg</b> supports the "folding" of portions of text into what  appear  to  be  single  characters,  and  the
       reverse  "unfolding"  operation.  Further, to provide outline views of texts such as source code that are
       heavily indented, <b>asdfg</b> has an automatic nested folding capability.

       <b>^Space,</b>
              with a selection will fold the selection.  Otherwise, it will repeatedly fold indented regions  of
              the  text  to  provide  an outline view.  A numeric value, if any, specifies the number of leading
              spaces or equivalent tabs at which code lines will be folded.   The  default  is  1,  causing  the
              folding of any line that isn't left-justified.

       <b>^Space.</b>
              with  a  selection,  or immediately atop a folded section, will unfold the topmost foldings within
              it.  Otherwise, and if there is a numeric value, it will completely unfold the entire view.

</pre><h4><b>SHELLS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>^R</b>     with no selection will launch an interactive shell in a  new  scratch  text.   With  a  selection,
              however,  <b>^R</b> will execute the shell command in the selection with the contents of the clip buffer,
              if any, as its standard input, and collect its output asynchronously in the background to  replace
              the  selection.  This allows many helpful UNIX text processing commands to be used directly.  Some
              handy commands to know:

       <b><a href="../man1/cat.1.html">cat</a></b>(1) to include another entire file, or to receive writes to a named pipe

       <b><a href="../man1/mkfifo.1.html">mkfifo</a></b>(1)
              to create a named pipe so that commands in other windows may  direct  their  output  into  a  text
              running <b>cat</b> in the background.

       <b>cd</b> <u>path</u>
              to  change  the  editor's  current  working directory (a special case command that is not actually
              passed to a shell)

       <b><a href="../man1/grep.1.html">grep</a></b>(1)
              to search for lines containing a pattern

       <b><a href="../man1/sort.1.html">sort</a></b>(1)
              to rearrange lines alphabetically or numerically, possibly reversed

       <b><a href="../man1/uniq.1.html">uniq</a></b>(1)
              to discard duplicated lines

       <b><a href="../man1/sed.1.html">sed</a></b>(1) as in <b>sed</b> <b>'s/FROM/TO/g'</b> to perform unconditional search-and-replace with regular expressions

       <b><a href="../man1/tr.1.html">tr</a></b>(1)  to convert lower to upper case with <b>a-z</b> <b>A-Z</b> and to remove DOS carriage returns with <b>-d</b> <b>'[\r]'</b>

       <b><a href="../man1/fmt.1.html">fmt</a></b>(1) to reformat paragraphs of natural language text

       <b>indent</b> <b>-st</b> <b>-kr</b> <b>-i8</b> <b>-nbbo</b>
              to reformat C language source code sensibly

       <b>column</b> <b>-t</b>
              to realign data nicely into columns

       <b>man</b> <b>|</b> <b>colcrt</b>
              to read a man page

       <b><a href="../man1/tail.1.html">tail</a></b>(1)
              to monitor additions to a file such as a log

       <b><a href="../man1/make.1.html">make</a></b>(1)
              to compile your code

       <b>aspell</b> <b>list</b> <b>|</b> <b>sort</b> <b>|</b> <b>uniq</b> <b>|</b> <b>column</b>
              to get a list of words that may be misspelled

       <b>^Space^R</b> with no selection will terminate the output of  any  asynchronous  child  process  that's  still
       running.

</pre><h4><b>TIPS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>*</b>      To select the rest of the line after the cursor, use <b>^U^Y</b>

       <b>*</b>      It is often faster to retype a bungled word than to fix it, using <b>^U^K</b> and then retyping.

       <b>*</b>      Transposing  multiple  blocks of text is easy with <b>^V</b>, which generalized the usual paste operation
              into an exchange of the clip buffer with the selection.

       <b>*</b>      Incremental search and replacement can be done with a macro or by clipping the  replacement  text,
              and  on  search  hits  that  are  to  be  replaced,  using <b>^U^V^C^/^/</b> to exchange the hit with the
              replacement text, copy it back to the clip buffer, and proceed  to  the  next  occurrence  of  the
              search  pattern.  But when the replacement text is short, it's sometimes easiest to just overwrite
              the selection by hitting <b>^U^X</b> and immediately retyping the new text.

       <b>*</b>      Reconfigure your keyboards so that the key to the left of A, which is probably labeled <b>Caps</b>  <b>Lock</b>,
              is interpreted as a Control modifier instead.

       <b>*</b>      The  <b><a href="../man1/gnome-terminal.1.html">gnome-terminal</a></b>(1)  terminal  emulator  works  well with <b>asdfg</b> if you configure the terminal's
              scrollback limit to a relatively small value.

       <b>*</b>      To move backward or forward by half a screenfull,  use  <b>^O</b>  or  <b>^P</b>  and  then  <b>^N</b>.   (Or  set  the
              environment variable <b>AOEUI_OVERLAP</b> to 50.)

       <b>*</b>      To  insert  characters with a repeat count, type the characters into a new selection, cut into the
              clip buffer with a repeat count with <b>^Space^X</b>, and then paste with <b>^V</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Inevitable; please tell me about any that you find.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SHELL</b>  is used to name the program run by the <b>^R</b> command.

       <b>ROWS</b>   and

       <b>COLUMNS</b>
              may be set to override <b>asdfg</b>'s automatic mechanisms  for  determining  the  size  of  the  display
              surface.

       <b>TERM</b>   will,  when  set  to  a string beginning with <b>xterm</b>, cause <b>asdfg</b> use the title bar of the terminal
              emulator as a status indicator that displays the path name of the active view and whether  or  not
              it has been saved since last modified.  Unless the file is large, it also displays the line number
              of the cursor.

       <b>TERM_PROGRAM</b>
              will,  if  set  to  Apple_Terminal,  make <b>asdfg</b> work around Apple's Terminal emulator's behavioral
              differences from standard Xterm.

       <b>AOEUI_WRITABLE</b>
              Default command used in the absence of the <b>-w</b> option.

       <b>AOEUI_OVERLAP</b>
              The percentage of overlap when scrolling a window up with <b>^O</b> or down with <b>^P</b>.  The default  is  1,
              for minimal overlap.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>file</u><b>~</b>  is overwritten with the original contents of <u>file</u> unless the <b>-o</b> option is used.

       <u>file</u><b>#</b>  contains  the  temporary  image  of  the  edited file while <b>asdfg</b> is running, and may be useful in
              recovery if the editor is killed.

       <b>TAGS</b>   is found and read in by the <b>^Space'</b> command to supply the tags that are scanned.  The  search  for
              <b>TAGS</b> begins in the same directory as the current view's text and proceeds up through its parents.

       <b>$HOME/.aoeui</b>
              holds any new "anonymous" texts created during editing sessions.
