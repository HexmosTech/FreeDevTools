</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dnsviz-print - print the assessment of diagnostic DNS queries

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dnsviz</b> <b>print</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>domain_name...</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Process  the  results  of  diagnostic  DNS  queries previously performed, e.g., using <b><a href="../man1/dnsviz-probe.1.html">dnsviz-probe</a>(1)</b>, to
       assess the health of the associated DNS deployments for one or more domain names specified.  The  results
       of this processing are presented in textual output.

       The source of the diagnostic query input is either a file specified with <b>-r</b> or standard input.

       Domain  names  to  be  processed  may be passed either as command-line arguments, in a file (using the <b>-f</b>
       option), or simply implied using the diagnostic query input.  The latter  is  the  preferred  methodology
       (and  the  simplest)  and  is  useful,  except  in  cases where the input contains diagnostic queries for
       multiple domain names, only a subset of which are to be processed.

       If <b>-f</b> is not used and no domain names are supplied on the command line,  then  the  domain  names  to  be
       processed are extracted from the diagnostic query input.  If the <b>-f</b> option is used, then names may not be
       specified on the command line.

       The  domain names passed as input are fully-qualified domain names, such as example.com, www.example.com,
       _443._tcp.example.com, 1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa, or 8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa.  Because it is  implied  that
       specified domain names are fully qualified, no trailing dot is necessary.

       The  output  is  appropriate  for  terminal  or  text  file  output, using colors (where supported by the
       terminal) and symbols to designate status and errors in a loosely-defined textual format.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f,</b> <b>--names-file</b> <u>filename</u>
              Read names from a file (one name per line), instead of from command line.

              If this option is used, then names may not be specified on the command line.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--input-file</b> <u>filename</u>
              Read diagnostic query input from the specified file, instead of from standard input.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--trusted-keys-file</b> <u>filename</u>
              Use trusted keys from the specified file when processing diagnostic queries.  This  overrides  the
              default behavior of using the installed keys for the root zone.

              The  format  of  this  file  is  master  zone  file  format and should contain DNSKEY records that
              correspond to one more trusted keys for one or more DNS zones.

              This option may be used multiple times on the command line.

       <b>-S,</b> <b>--show-colors</b>
              Use terminal colors even if output is not a TTY or colors are  not  supported.   Normally  <b><a href="../man1/dnsvizprint.1.html">dnsviz-</a></b>
              <b><a href="../man1/dnsvizprint.1.html">print</a>(1)</b>  detects  terminal  capabilities  and  uses  colors  only  where  supported.  This option
              overrides this detection and always includes terminal colors in the output.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--algorithms</b> <u>alg</u>[,<u>alg...]</u>
              Support only the DNSSEC algorithms  specified.   If  this  option  is  used,  any  algorithms  not
              specified  will  appear  as  "unsupported."   The  status  of  any  RRSIG records corresponding to
              unsupported algorithms will be unknown.  Additionally, when  a  zone  has  only  DS  records  with
              unsupported  algorithms,  the  zone is treated as "insecure", assuming the DS records are properly
              authenticated.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--digest-algorithms</b> <u>digest_alg</u>[,<u>digest_alg...]</u>
              Support only the DNSSEC  digest  algorithms  specified.   If  this  option  is  used,  any  digest
              algorithms not specified will appear as "unsupported."  The status of any DS records corresponding
              to  unsupported  digest algorithms will be unknown.  Additionally, when a zone has only DS records
              with unsupported digest algorithms, the zone is treated as "insecure", assuming the DS records are
              properly authenticated.

       <b>--ignore-rfc8624</b>
              Ignore errors associated with RFC 8624, DNSSEC algorithm implementation  requirements.   RFC  8624
              designates some DNSSEC signing algorithms and some DS digest algorithms as prohibited ("MUST NOT")
              or  not  recommended for validation and/or signing.  If this option is used, then no warnings will
              be issued, and the code will still assess their cryptographic status, rather than ignoring them.

       <b>--ignore-rfc9276</b>
              Ignore errors associated with RFC 9276, NSEC3 parameter settings.   RFC  9276  specifies  that  if
              NSEC3  is  used,  the iterations count must be 0 and the salt length must be 0.  If this option is
              used, then no warnings will be issued for NSEC3 records that violate this specification.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>--enforce-cookies</b>
              Enforce DNS cookies strictly. Require a server to return  a  "BADCOOKIE"  response  when  a  query
              contains a COOKIE option with no server cookie or with an invalid server cookie.

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--allow-private</b>
              Allow  private  IP  addresses  for  authoritative  DNS  servers.   By  default,  if the IP address
              corresponding to an authoritative server is in IP address space designated  as  "private",  it  is
              flagged  as  an  error.  However, there are some cases where this is allowed.  For example, if the
              diagnostic  queries  are  issued  to  servers  in  an  experimental  environment,  this  might  be
              permissible.

       <b>--trust-cdnskey-cds</b>
              Trust  all CDNSKEY and CDS records, even if they are not "signed with a key that is represented in
              both the current DNSKEY and DS RRsets" (RFC 7344).  This is allowed if "the Parent uses the CDS or
              CDNSKEY RRset for initial enrollment; in that case, the Parent validates the  CDS/CDNSKEY  through
              some  other  means"  (RFC  7344).   Because there is no way for DNSViz to discover the out-of-band
              means with which the parent might have validated the CDNSKEY and/or CDS  records,  this  trust  is
              signaled with the use of the <b>--trust-cdnskey-cds</b> command-line option.

       <b>--multi-signer</b>
              Don't  issue  errors for missing KSKs with DS RRs.  Typically an error is issued if a given DNSKEY
              is not found in the DNSKEY RRset returned by one or more servers.  If <b>--multi-signer</b> is specified,
              then no error is issued, in the case that 1) the DNSKEY  is  not  signing  any  non-DNSKEY  RRsets
              (i.e.,  is  a zone-signing key or ZSK) and 2) the DNSKEY corresponds to a DS record in the parent.
              This corresponds to the Model 2 use case in RFC 8901.

       <b>-R,</b> <b>--rr-types</b> <u>type</u>[,<u>type...</u>]
              Process queries of only the specified type(s) (e.g., A, AAAA).  The  default  is  to  process  all
              types queried as part of the diagnostic input.

       <b>-O,</b> <b>--derive-filename</b>
              Save the output to a file, whose name is derived from the domain name.

              If this option is used when the diagnostic queries of multiple domain names are being processed, a
              file will be created for each domain name processed.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--output-file</b> <u>filename</u>
              Write the output to the specified file instead of to standard output, which is the default.

              If  this option is used when the diagnostic queries of multiple domain name are being processed, a
              single file (the one specified) will be created, which will contain the collective output for  all
              domain names processed.

       <b>-h</b>     Display the usage and exit.

   <b>Domain</b> <b>Names</b>
       The  output above is divided into several sections, each corresponding to the domain name that starts the
       section (e.g., example.com).  Following the headers of names that correspond to zones  are  two  sets  of
       characters,  each  within brackets.  The characters within the first set of brackets represent the status
       of the zone.  The characters within the second set of brackets represent the  status  of  the  delegation
       (note that this second set of bracketed characters will not be present for the root zone).

       The first character within each set of brackets is one of the following:

       .      secure zone or delegation

       -      insecure zone or delegation

       !      bogus zone or delegation

       ?      lame or incomplete delegation

       If there is a second character within the brackets, it represents the following:

       !      errors are present

       ?      warnings are present

       For  example,  an insecure delegation with warnings is represented as: [-?]  And a secure delegation with
       no errors is shown as: [.]

   <b>Query</b> <b>Responses</b>
       The lines in each section, below the header, represent responses to queries for that  name  from  one  or
       more servers.  The bracketed characters at the far left of each line represent the status of the response
       or  response  component  on  the  rest  of  the line.  The first character in the brackets represents the
       authentication status:

       .      secure

       -      insecure

       !      bogus

       If there is a second character within the brackets, it represents the following:

       !      errors are present

       ?      warnings are present

       For example, an insecure status with warnings is represented as: [-?]  And a secure status with no errors
       is shown as: [.]

       The status of the response is followed by the type corresponding to the query or response.  For  example,
       "A"  means  that  data  following  is in response to a query of type A (IPv4 address) for the name of the
       corresponding section.  When the response is positive (i.e., there is data in the  answer  section),  the
       corresponding  data  is  shown  on  the  right (with some exceptions) as a comma-separated set of records
       within the RRset.  DNSKEY, DS, and RRSIG records show an abbreviated format of their records, as follows:

       DNSKEY:
              &lt;algorithm number&gt;/&lt;key tag&gt;/&lt;flags&gt;

              Example: 8/35864/256

       DS:    &lt;algorithm number&gt;/&lt;key tag&gt;/&lt;digest type&gt;

              Example: 8/30909/2

       RRSIG: &lt;signer&gt;/&lt;algorithm number&gt;/&lt;key tag&gt; (&lt;inception&gt; - &lt;expiration&gt;)

              Example: com/8/35864 (2015-08-24 - 2015-08-31)

       Following each record within a DNSKEY, DS, or RRSIG response is a bracketed set of characters, the  first
       of which represents validity:

       .      valid

       -      indeterminate

       !      invalid/expired/premature

       ?      indeterminate due to unknown algorithm

       If there is a second character within the brackets, it represents the following:

       !      errors are present

       ?      warnings are present

       For  example,  a  DNSKEY  with warnings is shown as: [.?]  A DS corresponding to a non-existent DNSKEY is
       represented as: [-].

       RRSIGs are shown below the RRset they cover, indented from the RRset.

   <b>Negative</b> <b>Responses</b>
       If a response is negative, then the appropriate "NODATA" or "NXDOMAIN" text is shown  adjacent  the  type
       queried,  e.g.,  "A:  NXDOMAIN".   If  there was an SOA record and/or <a href="../man3/NSEC.3.html">NSEC</a>(3) proof, then they are listed
       below, indented from the query type.

       The NSEC or NSEC3 records (and their RRSIGs) comprising a proof are  grouped  by  indentation  under  the
       title  "PROOF"  which  is  itself  indented  under  the  negative  response line.  Following "PROOF" is a
       bracketed set of characters with the same meaning as those used for DS, DNSKEY, and RRSIG.

   <b>Errors</b> <b>and</b> <b>Warnings</b>
       Textual errors and warnings  are  listed  below  the  response  components  with  which  the  issues  are
       associated.   Each  error or warning is listed on its own line and prefaced with "E:" or "W:", signifying
       whether it is an error or warning, respectively.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       The exit codes are:

       0      Program terminated normally.

       1      Incorrect usage.

       2      Required package dependencies were not found.

       3      There was an error processing the input or saving the output.

       4      Program execution was interrupted, or an unknown error occurred.
