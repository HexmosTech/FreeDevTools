       git-merge - Join two or more development histories together

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git</u> <u>merge</u> [-n] [--stat] [--no-commit] [--squash] [--[no-]edit]
               [--no-verify] [-s &lt;strategy&gt;] [-X &lt;strategy-option&gt;] [-S[&lt;keyid&gt;]]
               [--[no-]allow-unrelated-histories]
               [--[no-]rerere-autoupdate] [-m &lt;msg&gt;] [-F &lt;file&gt;]
               [--into-name &lt;branch&gt;] [&lt;commit&gt;...]
       <u>git</u> <u>merge</u> (--continue | --abort | --quit)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their histories diverged from the current
       branch) into the current branch. This command is used by <b>git</b> <b>pull</b> to incorporate changes from another
       repository and can be used by hand to merge changes from one branch into another.

       Assume the following history exists and the current branch is <b>master</b>:

                     A---B---C topic
                    /
               D---E---F---G master

       Then <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> <b>topic</b> will replay the changes made on the <b>topic</b> branch since it diverged from <b>master</b>
       (i.e., <b>E</b>) until its current commit (<b>C</b>) on top of <b>master</b>, and record the result in a new commit along with
       the names of the two parent commits and a log message from the user describing the changes. Before the
       operation, <b>ORIG_HEAD</b> is set to the tip of the current branch (<b>C</b>).

                     A---B---C topic
                    /         \
               D---E---F---G---H master

       A merge stops if there’s a conflict that cannot be resolved automatically or if <b>--no-commit</b> was provided
       when initiating the merge. At that point you can run <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> <b>--abort</b> or <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> <b>--continue</b>.

       <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> <b>--abort</b> will abort the merge process and try to reconstruct the pre-merge state. However, if
       there were uncommitted changes when the merge started (and especially if those changes were further
       modified after the merge was started), <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> <b>--abort</b> will in some cases be unable to reconstruct the
       original (pre-merge) changes. Therefore:

       <b>Warning</b>: Running <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> with non-trivial uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it may
       leave you in a state that is hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --commit, --no-commit
           Perform the merge and commit the result. This option can be used to override --no-commit.

           With --no-commit perform the merge and stop just before creating a merge commit, to give the user a
           chance to inspect and further tweak the merge result before committing.

           Note that fast-forward updates do not create a merge commit and therefore there is no way to stop
           those merges with --no-commit. Thus, if you want to ensure your branch is not changed or updated by
           the merge command, use --no-ff with --no-commit.

       --edit, -e, --no-edit
           Invoke an editor before committing successful mechanical merge to further edit the auto-generated
           merge message, so that the user can explain and justify the merge. The <b>--no-edit</b> option can be used
           to accept the auto-generated message (this is generally discouraged). The <b>--edit</b> (or <b>-e</b>) option is
           still useful if you are giving a draft message with the <b>-m</b> option from the command line and want to
           edit it in the editor.

           Older scripts may depend on the historical behaviour of not allowing the user to edit the merge log
           message. They will see an editor opened when they run <b>git</b> <b>merge</b>. To make it easier to adjust such
           scripts to the updated behaviour, the environment variable <b>GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT</b> can be set to <b>no</b> at the
           beginning of them.

       --cleanup=&lt;mode&gt;
           This option determines how the merge message will be cleaned up before committing. See <b><a href="../man1/git-commit.1.html">git-commit</a></b>(1)
           for more details. In addition, if the <u>&lt;mode&gt;</u> is given a value of <b>scissors</b>, scissors will be appended
           to <b>MERGE_MSG</b> before being passed on to the commit machinery in the case of a merge conflict.

       --ff, --no-ff, --ff-only
           Specifies how a merge is handled when the merged-in history is already a descendant of the current
           history.  <b>--ff</b> is the default unless merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag that is not
           stored in its natural place in the <b>refs/tags/</b> hierarchy, in which case <b>--no-ff</b> is assumed.

           With <b>--ff</b>, when possible resolve the merge as a fast-forward (only update the branch pointer to match
           the merged branch; do not create a merge commit). When not possible (when the merged-in history is
           not a descendant of the current history), create a merge commit.

           With <b>--no-ff</b>, create a merge commit in all cases, even when the merge could instead be resolved as a
           fast-forward.

           With <b>--ff-only</b>, resolve the merge as a fast-forward when possible. When not possible, refuse to merge
           and exit with a non-zero status.

       -S[&lt;keyid&gt;], --gpg-sign[=&lt;keyid&gt;], --no-gpg-sign
           GPG-sign the resulting merge commit. The <b>keyid</b> argument is optional and defaults to the committer
           identity; if specified, it must be stuck to the option without a space.  <b>--no-gpg-sign</b> is useful to
           countermand both <b>commit.gpgSign</b> configuration variable, and earlier <b>--gpg-sign</b>.

       --log[=&lt;n&gt;], --no-log
           In addition to branch names, populate the log message with one-line descriptions from at most &lt;n&gt;
           actual commits that are being merged. See also <b><a href="../man1/git-fmt-merge-msg.1.html">git-fmt-merge-msg</a></b>(1).

           With --no-log do not list one-line descriptions from the actual commits being merged.

       --signoff, --no-signoff
           Add a <b>Signed-off-by</b> trailer by the committer at the end of the commit log message. The meaning of a
           signoff depends on the project to which you’re committing. For example, it may certify that the
           committer has the rights to submit the work under the project’s license or agrees to some contributor
           representation, such as a Developer Certificate of Origin. (See <b>https://developercertificate.org</b> for
           the one used by the Linux kernel and Git projects.) Consult the documentation or leadership of the
           project to which you’re contributing to understand how the signoffs are used in that project.

           The --no-signoff option can be used to countermand an earlier --signoff option on the command line.

       --stat, -n, --no-stat
           Show a diffstat at the end of the merge. The diffstat is also controlled by the configuration option
           merge.stat.

           With -n or --no-stat do not show a diffstat at the end of the merge.

       --squash, --no-squash
           Produce the working tree and index state as if a real merge happened (except for the merge
           information), but do not actually make a commit, move the <b>HEAD</b>, or record <b>$GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD</b> (to
           cause the next <b>git</b> <b>commit</b> command to create a merge commit). This allows you to create a single
           commit on top of the current branch whose effect is the same as merging another branch (or more in
           case of an octopus).

           With --no-squash perform the merge and commit the result. This option can be used to override
           --squash.

           With --squash, --commit is not allowed, and will fail.

       --[no-]verify
           By default, the pre-merge and commit-msg hooks are run. When <b>--no-verify</b> is given, these are
           bypassed. See also <b><a href="../man5/githooks.5.html">githooks</a></b>(5).

       -s &lt;strategy&gt;, --strategy=&lt;strategy&gt;
           Use the given merge strategy; can be supplied more than once to specify them in the order they should
           be tried. If there is no <b>-s</b> option, a built-in list of strategies is used instead (<b>ort</b> when merging a
           single head, <b>octopus</b> otherwise).

       -X &lt;option&gt;, --strategy-option=&lt;option&gt;
           Pass merge strategy specific option through to the merge strategy.

       --verify-signatures, --no-verify-signatures
           Verify that the tip commit of the side branch being merged is signed with a valid key, i.e. a key
           that has a valid uid: in the default trust model, this means the signing key has been signed by a
           trusted key. If the tip commit of the side branch is not signed with a valid key, the merge is
           aborted.

       --summary, --no-summary
           Synonyms to --stat and --no-stat; these are deprecated and will be removed in the future.

       -q, --quiet
           Operate quietly. Implies --no-progress.

       -v, --verbose
           Be verbose.

       --progress, --no-progress
           Turn progress on/off explicitly. If neither is specified, progress is shown if standard error is
           connected to a terminal. Note that not all merge strategies may support progress reporting.

       --autostash, --no-autostash
           Automatically create a temporary stash entry before the operation begins, record it in the ref
           <b>MERGE_AUTOSTASH</b> and apply it after the operation ends. This means that you can run the operation on a
           dirty worktree. However, use with care: the final stash application after a successful merge might
           result in non-trivial conflicts.

       --allow-unrelated-histories
           By default, <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> command refuses to merge histories that do not share a common ancestor. This
           option can be used to override this safety when merging histories of two projects that started their
           lives independently. As that is a very rare occasion, no configuration variable to enable this by
           default exists and will not be added.

       -m &lt;msg&gt;
           Set the commit message to be used for the merge commit (in case one is created).

           If <b>--log</b> is specified, a shortlog of the commits being merged will be appended to the specified
           message.

           The <b>git</b> <b>fmt-merge-msg</b> command can be used to give a good default for automated <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> invocations.
           The automated message can include the branch description.

       --into-name &lt;branch&gt;
           Prepare the default merge message as if merging to the branch <u>&lt;branch&gt;</u>, instead of the name of the
           real branch to which the merge is made.

       -F &lt;file&gt;, --file=&lt;file&gt;
           Read the commit message to be used for the merge commit (in case one is created).

           If <b>--log</b> is specified, a shortlog of the commits being merged will be appended to the specified
           message.

       --rerere-autoupdate, --no-rerere-autoupdate
           After the rerere mechanism reuses a recorded resolution on the current conflict to update the files
           in the working tree, allow it to also update the index with the result of resolution.
           <b>--no-rerere-autoupdate</b> is a good way to double-check what <b>rerere</b> did and catch potential mismerges,
           before committing the result to the index with a separate <b>git</b> <b>add</b>.

       --overwrite-ignore, --no-overwrite-ignore
           Silently overwrite ignored files from the merge result. This is the default behavior. Use
           <b>--no-overwrite-ignore</b> to abort.

       --abort
           Abort the current conflict resolution process, and try to reconstruct the pre-merge state. If an
           autostash entry is present, apply it to the worktree.

           If there were uncommitted worktree changes present when the merge started, <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> <b>--abort</b> will in
           some cases be unable to reconstruct these changes. It is therefore recommended to always commit or
           stash your changes before running <b>git</b> <b>merge</b>.

           <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> <b>--abort</b> is equivalent to <b>git</b> <b>reset</b> <b>--merge</b> when <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> is present unless
           <b>MERGE_AUTOSTASH</b> is also present in which case <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> <b>--abort</b> applies the stash entry to the
           worktree whereas <b>git</b> <b>reset</b> <b>--merge</b> will save the stashed changes in the stash list.

       --quit
           Forget about the current merge in progress. Leave the index and the working tree as-is. If
           <b>MERGE_AUTOSTASH</b> is present, the stash entry will be saved to the stash list.

       --continue
           After a <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> stops due to conflicts you can conclude the merge by running <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> <b>--continue</b>
           (see "HOW TO RESOLVE CONFLICTS" section below).

       &lt;commit&gt;...
           Commits, usually other branch heads, to merge into our branch. Specifying more than one commit will
           create a merge with more than two parents (affectionately called an Octopus merge).

           If no commit is given from the command line, merge the remote-tracking branches that the current
           branch is configured to use as its upstream. See also the configuration section of this manual page.

           When <b>FETCH_HEAD</b> (and no other commit) is specified, the branches recorded in the <b>.git/FETCH_HEAD</b> file
           by the previous invocation of <b>git</b> <b>fetch</b> for merging are merged to the current branch.

</pre><h4><b>PRE-MERGE</b> <b>CHECKS</b></h4><pre>
       Before applying outside changes, you should get your own work in good shape and committed locally, so it
       will not be clobbered if there are conflicts. See also <b><a href="../man1/git-stash.1.html">git-stash</a></b>(1). <b>git</b> <b>pull</b> and <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> will stop
       without doing anything when local uncommitted changes overlap with files that <b>git</b> <b>pull</b>/<b>git</b> <b>merge</b> may need
       to update.

       To avoid recording unrelated changes in the merge commit, <b>git</b> <b>pull</b> and <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> will also abort if there
       are any changes registered in the index relative to the <b>HEAD</b> commit. (Special narrow exceptions to this
       rule may exist depending on which merge strategy is in use, but generally, the index must match HEAD.)

       If all named commits are already ancestors of <b>HEAD</b>, <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> will exit early with the message "Already
       up to date."

</pre><h4><b>FAST-FORWARD</b> <b>MERGE</b></h4><pre>
       Often the current branch head is an ancestor of the named commit. This is the most common case especially
       when invoked from <b>git</b> <b>pull</b>: you are tracking an upstream repository, you have committed no local changes,
       and now you want to update to a newer upstream revision. In this case, a new commit is not needed to
       store the combined history; instead, the <b>HEAD</b> (along with the index) is updated to point at the named
       commit, without creating an extra merge commit.

       This behavior can be suppressed with the <b>--no-ff</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>TRUE</b> <b>MERGE</b></h4><pre>
       Except in a fast-forward merge (see above), the branches to be merged must be tied together by a merge
       commit that has both of them as its parents.

       A merged version reconciling the changes from all branches to be merged is committed, and your <b>HEAD</b>,
       index, and working tree are updated to it. It is possible to have modifications in the working tree as
       long as they do not overlap; the update will preserve them.

       When it is not obvious how to reconcile the changes, the following happens:

        1. The <b>HEAD</b> pointer stays the same.

        2. The <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> ref is set to point to the other branch head.

        3. Paths that merged cleanly are updated both in the index file and in your working tree.

        4. For conflicting paths, the index file records up to three versions: stage 1 stores the version from
           the common ancestor, stage 2 from <b>HEAD</b>, and stage 3 from <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> (you can inspect the stages with
           <b>git</b> <b>ls-files</b> <b>-u</b>). The working tree files contain the result of the merge operation; i.e. 3-way merge
           results with familiar conflict markers &lt;&lt;&lt; <b>===</b> &gt;&gt;&gt;.

        5. A ref named <b>AUTO_MERGE</b> is written, pointing to a tree corresponding to the current content of the
           working tree (including conflict markers for textual conflicts). Note that this ref is only written
           when the <u>ort</u> merge strategy is used (the default).

        6. No other changes are made. In particular, the local modifications you had before you started merge
           will stay the same and the index entries for them stay as they were, i.e. matching <b>HEAD</b>.

       If you tried a merge which resulted in complex conflicts and want to start over, you can recover with <b>git</b>
       <b>merge</b> <b>--abort</b>.

</pre><h4><b>MERGING</b> <b>TAG</b></h4><pre>
       When merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag, Git always creates a merge commit even if a
       fast-forward merge is possible, and the commit message template is prepared with the tag message.
       Additionally, if the tag is signed, the signature check is reported as a comment in the message template.
       See also <b><a href="../man1/git-tag.1.html">git-tag</a></b>(1).

       When you want to just integrate with the work leading to the commit that happens to be tagged, e.g.
       synchronizing with an upstream release point, you may not want to make an unnecessary merge commit.

       In such a case, you can "unwrap" the tag yourself before feeding it to <b>git</b> <b>merge</b>, or pass <b>--ff-only</b> when
       you do not have any work on your own. e.g.

           git fetch origin
           git merge v1.2.3^0
           git merge --ff-only v1.2.3

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>CONFLICTS</b> <b>ARE</b> <b>PRESENTED</b></h4><pre>
       During a merge, the working tree files are updated to reflect the result of the merge. Among the changes
       made to the common ancestor’s version, non-overlapping ones (that is, you changed an area of the file
       while the other side left that area intact, or vice versa) are incorporated in the final result verbatim.
       When both sides made changes to the same area, however, Git cannot randomly pick one side over the other,
       and asks you to resolve it by leaving what both sides did to that area.

       By default, Git uses the same style as the one used by the "merge" program from the RCS suite to present
       such a conflicted hunk, like this:

           Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
           ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed,
           or cleanly resolved because both sides changed the same way.
           &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; yours:sample.txt
           Conflict resolution is hard;
           let's go shopping.
           =======
           Git makes conflict resolution easy.
           &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs:sample.txt
           And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified.

       The area where a pair of conflicting changes happened is marked with markers &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, <b>=======</b>, and
       &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;. The part before the <b>=======</b> is typically your side, and the part afterwards is typically their
       side.

       The default format does not show what the original said in the conflicting area. You cannot tell how many
       lines are deleted and replaced with Barbie’s remark on your side. The only thing you can tell is that
       your side wants to say it is hard and you’d prefer to go shopping, while the other side wants to claim it
       is easy.

       An alternative style can be used by setting the <b>merge.conflictStyle</b> configuration variable to either
       "diff3" or "zdiff3". In "diff3" style, the above conflict may look like this:

           Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
           ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed,
           &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; yours:sample.txt
           or cleanly resolved because both sides changed the same way.
           Conflict resolution is hard;
           let's go shopping.
           ||||||| base:sample.txt
           or cleanly resolved because both sides changed identically.
           Conflict resolution is hard.
           =======
           or cleanly resolved because both sides changed the same way.
           Git makes conflict resolution easy.
           &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs:sample.txt
           And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified.

       while in "zdiff3" style, it may look like this:

           Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
           ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed,
           or cleanly resolved because both sides changed the same way.
           &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; yours:sample.txt
           Conflict resolution is hard;
           let's go shopping.
           ||||||| base:sample.txt
           or cleanly resolved because both sides changed identically.
           Conflict resolution is hard.
           =======
           Git makes conflict resolution easy.
           &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs:sample.txt
           And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified.

       In addition to the &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, <b>=======</b>, and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; markers, it uses another ||||||| marker that is followed
       by the original text. You can tell that the original just stated a fact, and your side simply gave in to
       that statement and gave up, while the other side tried to have a more positive attitude. You can
       sometimes come up with a better resolution by viewing the original.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>TO</b> <b>RESOLVE</b> <b>CONFLICTS</b></h4><pre>
       After seeing a conflict, you can do two things:

       •   Decide not to merge. The only clean-ups you need are to reset the index file to the <b>HEAD</b> commit to
           reverse 2. and to clean up working tree changes made by 2. and 3.; <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> <b>--abort</b> can be used for
           this.

       •   Resolve the conflicts. Git will mark the conflicts in the working tree. Edit the files into shape and
           <b>git</b> <b>add</b> them to the index. Use <b>git</b> <b>commit</b> or <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> <b>--continue</b> to seal the deal. The latter
           command checks whether there is a (interrupted) merge in progress before calling <b>git</b> <b>commit</b>.

       You can work through the conflict with a number of tools:

       •   Use a mergetool.  <b>git</b> <b>mergetool</b> to launch a graphical mergetool which will work through the merge
           with you.

       •   Look at the diffs.  <b>git</b> <b>diff</b> will show a three-way diff, highlighting changes from both the <b>HEAD</b> and
           <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> versions.  <b>git</b> <b>diff</b> <b>AUTO_MERGE</b> will show what changes you’ve made so far to resolve
           textual conflicts.

       •   Look at the diffs from each branch.  <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>--merge</b> <b>-p</b> <u>&lt;path&gt;</u> will show diffs first for the <b>HEAD</b>
           version and then the <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> version.

       •   Look at the originals.  <b>git</b> <b>show</b> <b>:1:filename</b> shows the common ancestor, <b>git</b> <b>show</b> <b>:2:filename</b> shows
           the <b>HEAD</b> version, and <b>git</b> <b>show</b> <b>:3:filename</b> shows the <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> version.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       •   Merge branches <b>fixes</b> and <b>enhancements</b> on top of the current branch, making an octopus merge:

               $ git merge fixes enhancements

       •   Merge branch <b>obsolete</b> into the current branch, using <b>ours</b> merge strategy:

               $ git merge -s ours obsolete

       •   Merge branch <b>maint</b> into the current branch, but do not make a new commit automatically:

               $ git merge --no-commit maint

           This can be used when you want to include further changes to the merge, or want to write your own
           merge commit message.

           You should refrain from abusing this option to sneak substantial changes into a merge commit. Small
           fixups like bumping release/version name would be acceptable.

</pre><h4><b>MERGE</b> <b>STRATEGIES</b></h4><pre>
       The merge mechanism (<b>git</b> <b>merge</b> and <b>git</b> <b>pull</b> commands) allows the backend <u>merge</u> <u>strategies</u> to be chosen
       with <b>-s</b> option. Some strategies can also take their own options, which can be passed by giving <b>-X</b><u>&lt;option&gt;</u>
       arguments to <b>git</b> <b>merge</b> and/or <b>git</b> <b>pull</b>.

       ort
           This is the default merge strategy when pulling or merging one branch. This strategy can only resolve
           two heads using a 3-way merge algorithm. When there is more than one common ancestor that can be used
           for 3-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree
           for the 3-way merge. This has been reported to result in fewer merge conflicts without causing
           mismerges by tests done on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history.
           Additionally this strategy can detect and handle merges involving renames. It does not make use of
           detected copies. The name for this algorithm is an acronym ("Ostensibly Recursive’s Twin") and came
           from the fact that it was written as a replacement for the previous default algorithm, <b>recursive</b>.

           The <u>ort</u> strategy can take the following options:

           ours
               This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved cleanly by favoring <u>our</u> version. Changes
               from the other tree that do not conflict with our side are reflected in the merge result. For a
               binary file, the entire contents are taken from our side.

               This should not be confused with the <u>ours</u> merge strategy, which does not even look at what the
               other tree contains at all. It discards everything the other tree did, declaring <u>our</u> history
               contains all that happened in it.

           theirs
               This is the opposite of <u>ours</u>; note that, unlike <u>ours</u>, there is no <u>theirs</u> merge strategy to
               confuse this merge option with.

           ignore-space-change, ignore-all-space, ignore-space-at-eol, ignore-cr-at-eol
               Treats lines with the indicated type of whitespace change as unchanged for the sake of a
               three-way merge. Whitespace changes mixed with other changes to a line are not ignored. See also
               <b><a href="../man1/git-diff.1.html">git-diff</a></b>(1) <b>-b</b>, <b>-w</b>, <b>--ignore-space-at-eol</b>, and <b>--ignore-cr-at-eol</b>.

               •   If <u>their</u> version only introduces whitespace changes to a line, <u>our</u> version is used;

               •   If <u>our</u> version introduces whitespace changes but <u>their</u> version includes a substantial change,
                   <u>their</u> version is used;

               •   Otherwise, the merge proceeds in the usual way.

           renormalize
               This runs a virtual check-out and check-in of all three stages of a file when resolving a
               three-way merge. This option is meant to be used when merging branches with different clean
               filters or end-of-line normalization rules. See "Merging branches with differing checkin/checkout
               attributes" in <b><a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes</a></b>(5) for details.

           no-renormalize
               Disables the <b>renormalize</b> option. This overrides the <b>merge.renormalize</b> configuration variable.

           find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]
               Turn on rename detection, optionally setting the similarity threshold. This is the default. This
               overrides the <u>merge.renames</u> configuration variable. See also <b><a href="../man1/git-diff.1.html">git-diff</a></b>(1) <b>--find-renames</b>.

           rename-threshold=&lt;n&gt;
               Deprecated synonym for <b>find-renames=</b><u>&lt;n&gt;</u>.

           subtree[=&lt;path&gt;]
               This option is a more advanced form of <u>subtree</u> strategy, where the strategy makes a guess on how
               two trees must be shifted to match with each other when merging. Instead, the specified path is
               prefixed (or stripped from the beginning) to make the shape of two trees to match.

       recursive
           This can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge algorithm. When there is more than one common
           ancestor that can be used for 3-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses
           that as the reference tree for the 3-way merge. This has been reported to result in fewer merge
           conflicts without causing mismerges by tests done on actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel
           development history. Additionally this can detect and handle merges involving renames. It does not
           make use of detected copies. This was the default strategy for resolving two heads from Git v0.99.9k
           until v2.33.0.

           The <u>recursive</u> strategy takes the same options as <u>ort</u>. However, there are three additional options
           that <u>ort</u> ignores (not documented above) that are potentially useful with the <u>recursive</u> strategy:

           patience
               Deprecated synonym for <b>diff-algorithm=patience</b>.

           diff-algorithm=[patience|minimal|histogram|myers]
               Use a different diff algorithm while merging, which can help avoid mismerges that occur due to
               unimportant matching lines (such as braces from distinct functions). See also <b><a href="../man1/git-diff.1.html">git-diff</a></b>(1)
               <b>--diff-algorithm</b>. Note that <b>ort</b> specifically uses <b>diff-algorithm=histogram</b>, while <b>recursive</b>
               defaults to the <b>diff.algorithm</b> config setting.

           no-renames
               Turn off rename detection. This overrides the <b>merge.renames</b> configuration variable. See also <b><a href="../man1/gitdiff.1.html">git-</a></b>
               <b><a href="../man1/gitdiff.1.html">diff</a></b>(1) <b>--no-renames</b>.

       resolve
           This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch and another branch you pulled from) using a
           3-way merge algorithm. It tries to carefully detect criss-cross merge ambiguities. It does not handle
           renames.

       octopus
           This resolves cases with more than two heads, but refuses to do a complex merge that needs manual
           resolution. It is primarily meant to be used for bundling topic branch heads together. This is the
           default merge strategy when pulling or merging more than one branch.

       ours
           This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree of the merge is always that of the current
           branch head, effectively ignoring all changes from all other branches. It is meant to be used to
           supersede old development history of side branches. Note that this is different from the -Xours
           option to the <u>recursive</u> merge strategy.

       subtree
           This is a modified <b>ort</b> strategy. When merging trees A and B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is
           first adjusted to match the tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same level. This
           adjustment is also done to the common ancestor tree.

       With the strategies that use 3-way merge (including the default, <u>ort</u>), if a change is made on both
       branches, but later reverted on one of the branches, that change will be present in the merged result;
       some people find this behavior confusing. It occurs because only the heads and the merge base are
       considered when performing a merge, not the individual commits. The merge algorithm therefore considers
       the reverted change as no change at all, and substitutes the changed version instead.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       branch.&lt;name&gt;.mergeOptions
           Sets default options for merging into branch &lt;name&gt;. The syntax and supported options are the same as
           those of <b>git</b> <b>merge</b>, but option values containing whitespace characters are currently not supported.

       Everything above this line in this section isn’t included from the <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1) documentation. The
       content that follows is the same as what’s found there:

       merge.conflictStyle
           Specify the style in which conflicted hunks are written out to working tree files upon merge. The
           default is "merge", which shows a &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; conflict marker, changes made by one side, a <b>=======</b>
           marker, changes made by the other side, and then a &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; marker. An alternate style, "diff3", adds
           a ||||||| marker and the original text before the <b>=======</b> marker. The "merge" style tends to produce
           smaller conflict regions than diff3, both because of the exclusion of the original text, and because
           when a subset of lines match on the two sides, they are just pulled out of the conflict region.
           Another alternate style, "zdiff3", is similar to diff3 but removes matching lines on the two sides
           from the conflict region when those matching lines appear near either the beginning or end of a
           conflict region.

       merge.defaultToUpstream
           If merge is called without any commit argument, merge the upstream branches configured for the
           current branch by using their last observed values stored in their remote-tracking branches. The
           values of the <b>branch.</b>&lt;current <b>branch</b>&gt;<b>.merge</b> that name the branches at the remote named by
           <b>branch.</b>&lt;current <b>branch</b>&gt;<b>.remote</b> are consulted, and then they are mapped via <b>remote.</b><u>&lt;remote&gt;</u><b>.fetch</b> to
           their corresponding remote-tracking branches, and the tips of these tracking branches are merged.
           Defaults to true.

       merge.ff
           By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit when merging a commit that is a descendant of
           the current commit. Instead, the tip of the current branch is fast-forwarded. When set to <b>false</b>, this
           variable tells Git to create an extra merge commit in such a case (equivalent to giving the <b>--no-ff</b>
           option from the command line). When set to <b>only</b>, only such fast-forward merges are allowed
           (equivalent to giving the <b>--ff-only</b> option from the command line).

       merge.verifySignatures
           If true, this is equivalent to the --verify-signatures command line option. See <b><a href="../man1/git-merge.1.html">git-merge</a></b>(1) for
           details.

       merge.branchdesc
           In addition to branch names, populate the log message with the branch description text associated
           with them. Defaults to false.

       merge.log
           In addition to branch names, populate the log message with at most the specified number of one-line
           descriptions from the actual commits that are being merged. Defaults to false, and true is a synonym
           for 20.

       merge.suppressDest
           By adding a glob that matches the names of integration branches to this multi-valued configuration
           variable, the default merge message computed for merges into these integration branches will omit
           "into &lt;branch name&gt;" from its title.

           An element with an empty value can be used to clear the list of globs accumulated from previous
           configuration entries. When there is no <b>merge.suppressDest</b> variable defined, the default value of
           <b>master</b> is used for backward compatibility.

       merge.renameLimit
           The number of files to consider in the exhaustive portion of rename detection during a merge. If not
           specified, defaults to the value of diff.renameLimit. If neither merge.renameLimit nor
           diff.renameLimit are specified, currently defaults to 7000. This setting has no effect if rename
           detection is turned off.

       merge.renames
           Whether Git detects renames. If set to "false", rename detection is disabled. If set to "true", basic
           rename detection is enabled. Defaults to the value of diff.renames.

       merge.directoryRenames
           Whether Git detects directory renames, affecting what happens at merge time to new files added to a
           directory on one side of history when that directory was renamed on the other side of history. If
           merge.directoryRenames is set to "false", directory rename detection is disabled, meaning that such
           new files will be left behind in the old directory. If set to "true", directory rename detection is
           enabled, meaning that such new files will be moved into the new directory. If set to "conflict", a
           conflict will be reported for such paths. If merge.renames is false, merge.directoryRenames is
           ignored and treated as false. Defaults to "conflict".

       merge.renormalize
           Tell Git that canonical representation of files in the repository has changed over time (e.g. earlier
           commits record text files with CRLF line endings, but recent ones use LF line endings). In such a
           repository, Git can convert the data recorded in commits to a canonical form before performing a
           merge to reduce unnecessary conflicts. For more information, see section "Merging branches with
           differing checkin/checkout attributes" in <b><a href="../man5/gitattributes.5.html">gitattributes</a></b>(5).

       merge.stat
           Whether to print the diffstat between ORIG_HEAD and the merge result at the end of the merge. True by
           default.

       merge.autoStash
           When set to true, automatically create a temporary stash entry before the operation begins, and apply
           it after the operation ends. This means that you can run merge on a dirty worktree. However, use with
           care: the final stash application after a successful merge might result in non-trivial conflicts.
           This option can be overridden by the <b>--no-autostash</b> and <b>--autostash</b> options of <b><a href="../man1/git-merge.1.html">git-merge</a></b>(1). Defaults
           to false.

       merge.tool
           Controls which merge tool is used by <b><a href="../man1/git-mergetool.1.html">git-mergetool</a></b>(1). The list below shows the valid built-in
           values. Any other value is treated as a custom merge tool and requires that a corresponding
           mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd variable is defined.

       merge.guitool
           Controls which merge tool is used by <b><a href="../man1/git-mergetool.1.html">git-mergetool</a></b>(1) when the -g/--gui flag is specified. The list
           below shows the valid built-in values. Any other value is treated as a custom merge tool and requires
           that a corresponding mergetool.&lt;guitool&gt;.cmd variable is defined.
