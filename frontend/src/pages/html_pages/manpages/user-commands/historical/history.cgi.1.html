</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       history.cgi - CGI program to display service history

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>history.cgi</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>history.cgi</b>  is  invoked  as  a  CGI  script via the history.sh CGI wrapper.  It is passed a QUERY_STRING
       environment variable with the following parameters:

          HISTFILE (a Xymon service history file)
          ENTRIES (the number of entries to show)

       The following non-standard parameters are handled by the Xymon version of history.cgi:

          IP (IP address of host - for display purposes only)
          PIXELS (width of colorbar when in pixel-mode)
          ENDTIME (when the colorbar begins, a time_t value)
          BARSUMS (which colorbars and summaries to show)

       history.cgi analyses the service history file for changes that have occurred within the  past  24  hours,
       and build a colorbar showing the status of the service over this period of time.  A statistics summary is
       also produced, listing the amount of time for each status (green, yellow, red, purple, blue, clear).

       Finally, a summary of the last N events is given, with links to the actual event logs.

       Unlike  the  standard  history.sh  script,  history.cgi provides a colorbar and statistics summaries also
       covering the past 1 week, 4 weeks and 1 year of data. Via links it  is  possible  to  browse  the  entire
       history of the service at the requested interval.

       Note  that  since  the  resolution  of  the  display  is limited, events may be too short to show up on a
       colorbar; also, the exact placement of an event may not fully match up with the time-markers.

       The graphs should correctly handle the display of months with different number of days, as  well  as  the
       display  of  periods  that  involve  beginning  and  end of Daylight Savings Time, if this occurs in your
       timezone.

       All dates and times shown are in local time for the timezone defined on the Xymon server.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       HISTFILE
              Defines the host and service whose history is presented.

       ENTRIES
              The number of log-entries to show in the event log table.  Default is 50; to view all log  entries
              set this to "ALL".

       IP     The IP-address of the host. This is only used for the title of the document.

       PIXELS The  width  of the colorbar graph in pixels. If this is set to 0, a percentage-based graph will be
              shown, similar to the one provided by the standard history.sh script.  Pixel-based graphs can have
              a higher resolution, but do not resize automatically to suit the size of  a  browser  window.  The
              default value for this parameter is defined at compile-time; 960 is a good value for displays with
              a 1024x768 resolution.

       BARSUMS
              Defines  which colorbars and summaries to show. This is a number made up from a bitmask. The 1-day
              graph uses the value "1"; the 1-week graph uses the value "2"; the 4-week graph uses the value "4"
              and the 1-year graph the value "8".  To show multiple graph, add the values - e.g. "6"  will  show
              the  1-week  and  4-weeks graphs, whereas "15" will show all the graphs. The default is defined at
              compile-time.

       ENDTIME
              The history display by default ends with the current time.  Setting the ENDTIME  parameter  causes
              it  to  end at the time specified - this is given as a Unix "time_t" value, i.e.  as the number of
              seconds elapsed since Jan 1 1970 00:00 UTC.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --env=FILENAME
              Load the environment from FILENAME before executing the CGI.
