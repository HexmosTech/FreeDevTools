       stilts-tmultin - Writes multiple processed tables to single container file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>stilts</b> <b>tmultin</b> [nin=<u>&lt;count&gt;</u>] [ifmtN=<u>&lt;in-format&gt;</u>] [inN=<u>&lt;tableN&gt;</u>] [icmdN=<u>&lt;cmds&gt;</u>] [out=<u>&lt;out-file&gt;</u>]
                      [ofmt=<u>&lt;out-format&gt;</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>tmultin</u> takes multiple input tables and writes them to a single output container file. The container file
       must be of some format which can contain more than one table, for instance a FITS file (which can contain
       multiple  extensions)  or a VOTable document (which can contain multiple TABLE elements). Individual fil‐
       tering may be performed on the tables prior to writing them, and their formats may be specified individu‐
       ally. If you want to apply the same pre-processing to all the input tables, you may find the <u>tmulti</u>  com‐
       mand more convenient.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nin=</b><u>&lt;count&gt;</u>
              The  number of input tables for this task. For each of the input tables N there will be associated
              parameters <u>ifmtN</u>, <u>inN</u> and <u>icmdN</u>.

       <b>ifmtN=</b><u>&lt;in-format&gt;</u>
              Specifies the format of input table #N as specified by parameter <u>inN</u>. The known formats are listed
              in SUN/256. This flag can be used if you know what format your table is in. If it has the  special
              value  <u>(auto)</u>  (the default), then an attempt will be made to detect the format of the table auto‐
              matically. This cannot always be done correctly however, in which case the program will exit  with
              an  error  explaining which formats were attempted. This parameter is ignored for scheme-specified
              tables.

       <b>inN=</b><u>&lt;tableN&gt;</u>
              The location of input table #N. This may take one of the following forms:

                * A filename.

                * A URL.

                * The special value "<u>-</u>", meaning standard input. In this case the input format must be given ex‐
                  plicitly using the <u>ifmtN</u> parameter. Note that not all formats can be streamed in this way.

                * A scheme specification of the form <u>:&lt;scheme-name&gt;:&lt;scheme-args&gt;</u>.

                * A system command line with either a "<u>&lt;</u>" character at the start, or a "<u>|</u>" character at the  end
                  ("<u>&lt;syscmd</u>" or "<u>syscmd|</u>"). This executes the given pipeline and reads from its standard output.
                  This will probably only work on unix-like systems.
               In  any case, compressed data in one of the supported compression formats (gzip, Unix compress or
              bzip2) will be decompressed transparently.

       <b>icmdN=</b><u>&lt;cmds&gt;</u>
              Specifies processing to be performed on input table #N as specified by parameter <u>inN</u>,  before  any
              other  processing  has  taken place. The value of this parameter is one or more of the filter com‐
              mands described in SUN/256. If more than one is given, they must be separated by semicolon charac‐
              ters (";"). This parameter can be repeated multiple times on the same command line to build  up  a
              list  of  processing  steps.  The  sequence  of  commands given in this way defines the processing
              pipeline which is performed on the table.

              Commands may alternatively be supplied in an external file, by  using  the  indirection  character
              '<u>@</u>'. Thus a value of "<u>@filename</u>" causes the file <u>filename</u> to be read for a list of filter commands
              to execute. The commands in the file may be separated by newline characters and/or semicolons, and
              lines which are blank or which start with a '<u>#</u>' character are ignored. A backslash character '<u>\fR'</u>
              <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>end</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>line</u> <u>joins</u> <u>it</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>following</u> <u>line.</u>

       <b>out=</b><u>&lt;out-file&gt;</u>
              The  location  of  the  output file. This is usually a filename to write to. If it is equal to the
              special value "-" the output will be written to standard output.

       <b>ofmt=</b><u>&lt;out-format&gt;</u>
              Specifies the format in which the output tables will be written (one of  the  ones  in  SUN/256  -
              matching  is  case-insensitive  and you can use just the first few letters). If it has the special
              value "<u>(auto)</u>" (the default), then the output filename will be examined to try to guess what  sort
              of  file  is  required  usually by looking at the extension. If it's not obvious from the filename
              what output format is intended, an error will result.

              Not all output formats are capable of writing multiple tables; if you choose one that is  not,  an
              error will result.
