</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       flit - Flit Documentation

       <b>Flit</b>  is a simple way to put Python packages and modules on PyPI.  It tries to require less thought about
       packaging     and     help     you     avoid     common     mistakes.      See     <u>Why</u>     <u>use</u>      <u>Flit?</u>
       &lt;<b>https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rationale.html</b>&gt;  for  more  about  how it compares to other Python
       packaging tools.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALL</b></h4><pre>
          $ python3 -m pip install flit

       Flit requires Python 3 and therefore needs to be installed using the Python 3 version of pip.

       Python 2 modules can be distributed using Flit, but need to be importable on Python 3 without errors.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Say you're writing a module <b>foobar</b> — either as a single file <b>foobar.py</b>, or as a directory — and you  want
       to distribute it.

       1. Make  sure  that  foobar's docstring starts with a one-line summary of what the module is, and that it
          has a <b>__version__</b>:

             """An amazing sample package!"""

             __version__ = "0.1"

       2. Install flit if you don't already have it:

             python3 -m pip install flit

       3. Run <b>flit</b> <b>init</b> in the directory containing the module to create a <b>pyproject.toml</b>  file.  It  will  look
          something like this:

             [build-system]
             requires = ["flit_core &gt;=3.2,&lt;4"]
             build-backend = "flit_core.buildapi"

             [project]
             name = "foobar"
             authors = [{name = "Sir Robin", email = "<a href="mailto:robin@camelot.uk">robin@camelot.uk</a>"}]
             dynamic = ["version", "description"]

             [project.urls]
             Home = "https://github.com/sirrobin/foobar"

          You  can  edit  this  file  to add other metadata, for example to set up command line scripts. See the
          <u>pyproject.toml</u> <u>page</u> &lt;<b>https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyproject_toml.html#scripts-section</b>&gt; of the
          documentation.

          If you have already got  a  <b>flit.ini</b>  file  to  use  with  older  versions  of  Flit,  convert  it  to
          <b>pyproject.toml</b> by running <b>python3</b> <b>-m</b> <b>flit.tomlify</b>.

       4. Run this command to upload your code to PyPI:

             flit publish

       Once  your  package  is  published,  people can install it using <u>pip</u> just like any other package. In most
       cases, pip will download a  'wheel'  package,  a  standard  format  it  knows  how  to  install.  If  you
       specifically  ask  pip  to  install  an  'sdist'  package,  it  will  install and use Flit in a temporary
       environment.

       To install a package locally for development, run:

          flit install [--symlink] [--python path/to/python]

       Flit packages a single importable module or package at a time, using the import name as the name on PyPI.
       All subpackages and data files within a package are included automatically.

</pre><h4><b>DOCUMENTATION</b> <b>CONTENTS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>The</b> <b>pyproject.toml</b> <b>config</b> <b>file</b>
       This file lives next to the module or package.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Older version of Flit (up to 0.11) used a <u>flit.ini</u> <u>file</u> for similar information. These files no longer
          work with Flit 3 and above.

          Run <b>python3</b> <b>-m</b> <b>flit.tomlify</b> to convert a <b>flit.ini</b> file to <b>pyproject.toml</b>.

   <b>Build</b> <b>system</b> <b>section</b>
       This tells tools like pip to build your project with flit. It's a standard defined by PEP  517.  For  any
       new project using Flit, it will look like this:

          [build-system]
          requires = ["flit_core &gt;=3.2,&lt;4"]
          build-backend = "flit_core.buildapi"

       Version constraints:

       • For  now,  all  packages  should  specify  <b>&lt;4</b>,  so  they won't be impacted by changes in the next major
         version.

       • <u>New</u> <u>style</u> <u>metadata</u> requires <b>flit_core</b> <b>&gt;=3.2</b>

       • <u>Old</u> <u>style</u> <u>metadata</u> requires <b>flit_core</b> <b>&gt;=2,&lt;4</b>

       • The older <u>flit.ini</u> <u>file</u> requires <b>flit_core</b> <b>&lt;3</b>.

       • TOML features new in version 1.0 require <b>flit_core</b> <b>&gt;=3.4</b>.

       • <b>flit_core</b> 3.3 is the last version supporting  Python  3.4  &amp;  3.5.  Packages  supporting  these  Python
         versions can only use <u>TOML</u> <u>v0.5</u> &lt;<b>https://toml.io/en/v0.5.0</b>&gt;.

       • Only  <b>flit_core</b>  2.x  can  build packages on Python 2, so packages still supporting Python 2 cannot use
         new-style metadata (the <b>[project]</b> table).

   <b>New</b> <b>style</b> <b>metadata</b>
       New in version 3.2.

       The new standard way to specify project metadata  is  in  a  <b>[project]</b>  table,  as  defined  by  <u>PEP</u>  <u>621</u>
       &lt;<b>https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/</b>&gt;.   Flit   works   for   now   with   either   this   or   the   older
       <b>[tool.flit.metadata]</b> table (<u>described</u> <u>below</u>), but it won't allow you to mix them.

       A simple <b>[project]</b> table might look like this:

          [project]
          name = "astcheck"
          authors = [
              {name = "Thomas Kluyver", email = "<a href="mailto:thomas@kluyver.me.uk">thomas@kluyver.me.uk</a>"},
          ]
          readme = "README.rst"
          classifiers = [
              "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
          ]
          requires-python = "&gt;=3.5"
          dynamic = ["version", "description"]

       The allowed fields are:

       <b>name</b>   The name your package will have on PyPI. This field is required. For Flit,  this  name,  with  any
              hyphens  replaced by underscores, is also the default value of the import name (see <u>Module</u> <u>section</u>
              if that needs to be different).

              Changed in version 3.8: Hyphens in the project name are now  translated  to  underscores  for  the
              import name.

       <b>version</b>
              Version  number  as  a string. If you want Flit to get this from a <b>__version__</b> attribute, leave it
              out of the TOML config and include "version" in the <b>dynamic</b> field.

       <b>description</b>
              A one-line description of your project. If you want Flit to get this from  the  module  docstring,
              leave it out of the TOML config and include "description" in the <b>dynamic</b> field.

       <b>readme</b> A  path  (relative to the .toml file) to a file containing a longer description of your package to
              show      on      PyPI.      This      should      be      written       in       <u>reStructuredText</u>
              &lt;<b><a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html">http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html</a></b>&gt;,  Markdown  or  plain  text, and the
              filename should have the appropriate extension (<b>.rst</b>, <b>.md</b> or <b>.txt</b>). Alternatively, <b>readme</b> can be a
              table with either a <b>file</b> key (a relative path) or a <b>text</b>  key  (literal  text),  and  an  optional
              <b>content-type</b> key (e.g. <b>text/x-rst</b>).

       <b>requires-python</b>
              A  version  specifier  for the versions of Python this requires, e.g. <b>~=3.3</b> or <b>&gt;=3.3,&lt;4</b>, which are
              equivalents.

       <b>license</b>
              A table with either a <b>file</b> key (a relative path to a license file) or  a  <b>text</b>  key  (the  license
              text).

       <b>authors</b>
              A list of tables with <b>name</b> and <b>email</b> keys (both optional) describing the authors of the project.

       <b>maintainers</b>
              Same format as authors.

       <b>keywords</b>
              A list of words to help with searching for your package.

       <b>classifiers</b>
              A   list  of  <u>Trove</u>  <u>classifiers</u>  &lt;<b>https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers</b>&gt;.   Add
              <b>Private</b> <b>::</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Upload</b> into the list to prevent a private package from being uploaded to PyPI by
              accident.

       <b>dependencies</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>optional-dependencies</b>
              See <u>Dependencies</u>.

       <b>urls</b>   See <u>URLs</u> <u>table</u>.

       <b>scripts</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>gui-scripts</b>
              See <u>Scripts</u> <u>section</u>.

       <b>entry-points</b>
              See <u>Entry</u> <u>points</u> <u>sections</u>.

       <b>dynamic</b>
              A list of field names which aren't specified here, for which Flit should find  a  value  at  build
              time. Only "version" and "description" are accepted.

   <b>Dependencies</b>
       The <b>dependencies</b> field is a list of other packages from PyPI that this package needs. Each package may be
       followed     by     a     version    specifier    like    <b>&gt;=4.1</b>,    and/or    an    <u>environment</u>    <u>marker</u>
       &lt;<b>https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0508/#environment-markers</b>&gt; after a semicolon. For example:

              dependencies = [
                  "requests &gt;=2.6",
                  "configparser; python_version == '2.7'",
              ]

       The <b>[project.optional-dependencies]</b> table contains lists of packages needed for every  optional  feature.
       The requirements are specified in the same format as for <b>dependencies</b>. For example:

              [project.optional-dependencies]
              test = [
                  "pytest &gt;=2.7.3",
                  "pytest-cov",
              ]
              doc = ["sphinx"]

       You  can  call  these  optional  features  anything  you want, although <b>test</b> and <b>doc</b> are common ones. You
       specify them for installation in square brackets after the package name or directory,  e.g.  <b>pip</b>  <b>install</b>
       <b>'.[test]'</b>.

   <b>URLs</b> <b>table</b>
       Your  project's  page on <u>pypi.org</u> &lt;<b>https://pypi.org/</b>&gt; can show a number of links. You can point people to
       documentation or a bug tracker, for example.

       This section is called <b>[project.urls]</b> in the file. You can use any names inside it. Here it is for flit:

          [project.urls]
          Documentation = "https://flit.pypa.io"
          Source = "https://github.com/pypa/flit"

   <b>Scripts</b> <b>section</b>
       This section is called <b>[project.scripts]</b> in the file.  Each key and value describes a shell command to be
       installed along with your package. These work like setuptools 'entry  points'.  Here's  the  section  for
       flit:

          [project.scripts]
          flit = "flit:main"

       This will create a <b>flit</b> command, which will call the function <b>main()</b> imported from <b>flit</b>.

       A  similar  table  called  <b>[project.gui-scripts]</b>  defines  commands which launch a GUI. This only makes a
       difference on Windows, where GUI scripts are run without a console.

   <b>Entry</b> <b>points</b> <b>sections</b>
       You  can  declare  <u>entry</u>  <u>points</u>  &lt;<b><a href="http://entrypoints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">http://entrypoints.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a></b>&gt;  using  sections   named
       <b>[project.entry-points.</b><u>groupname</u><b>]</b>. E.g. to provide a pygments lexer from your package:

          [project.entry-points."pygments.lexers"]
          dogelang = "dogelang.lexer:DogeLexer"

       In each <b>package:name</b> value, the part before the colon should be an importable module name, and the latter
       part  should be the name of an object accessible within that module. The details of what object to expose
       depend on the application you're extending.

       If the group name contains a dot, it must be quoted (<b>"pygments.lexers"</b> above). Script  entry  points  are
       defined in <u>scripts</u> <u>tables</u>, so you can't use the group names <b>console_scripts</b> or <b>gui_scripts</b> here.

   <b>Module</b> <b>section</b>
       If  your  package  will  have different names for installation and import, you should specify the install
       (PyPI) name in the <b>[project]</b> table (<u>see</u> <u>above</u>), and the import name in a <b>[tool.flit.module]</b> table:

          [project]
          name = "pynsist"
          # ...

          [tool.flit.module]
          name = "nsist"

       Flit looks for the source of the package by its import name. The source may  be  located  either  in  the
       directory that holds the <b>pyproject.toml</b> file, or in a <b>src/</b> subdirectory.

   <b>Old</b> <b>style</b> <b>metadata</b>
       Flit's  older  way to specify metadata is in a <b>[tool.flit.metadata]</b> table, along with <b>[tool.flit.scripts]</b>
       and <b>[tool.flit.entrypoints]</b>, described below. This is still recognised for now, but you can't mix it with
       <u>New</u> <u>style</u> <u>metadata</u>.

       There are three required fields:

       <b>module</b> The name of the module/package, as you'd use in an import statement.

       <b>author</b> Your name

       <b>author-email</b>
              Your email address

       e.g. for flit itself

          [tool.flit.metadata]
          module = "flit"
          author = "Thomas Kluyver"
          author-email = "<a href="mailto:thomas@kluyver.me.uk">thomas@kluyver.me.uk</a>"

       Changed in version 1.1: <b>home-page</b> was previously required.

       The remaining fields are optional:

       <b>home-page</b>
              A URL for the project, such as its Github repository.

       <b>requires</b>
              A list of other packages from PyPI that this package needs. Each package  may  be  followed  by  a
              version     specifier     like    <b>(&gt;=4.1)</b>    or    <b>&gt;=4.1</b>,    and/or    an    <u>environment</u>    <u>marker</u>
              &lt;<b>https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0508/#environment-markers</b>&gt; after a semicolon. For example:

                 requires = [
                     "requests &gt;=2.6",
                     "configparser; python_version == '2.7'",
                 ]

       <b>requires-extra</b>
              Lists of packages needed for every optional feature. The requirements are specified  in  the  same
              format  as  for  <b>requires</b>. The requirements of the two reserved extras <b>test</b> and <b>doc</b> as well as the
              extra <b>dev</b> are installed by <b>flit</b> <b>install</b>. For example:

                 [tool.flit.metadata.requires-extra]
                 test = [
                     "pytest &gt;=2.7.3",
                     "pytest-cov",
                 ]
                 doc = ["sphinx"]

              New in version 1.1.

       <b>description-file</b>
              A path (relative to the .toml file) to a file containing a longer description of your  package  to
              show       on       PyPI.      This      should      be      written      in      <u>reStructuredText</u>
              &lt;<b><a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html">http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html</a></b>&gt;, Markdown or  plain  text,  and  the
              filename should have the appropriate extension (<b>.rst</b>, <b>.md</b> or <b>.txt</b>).

       <b>classifiers</b>
              A   list  of  <u>Trove</u>  <u>classifiers</u>  &lt;<b>https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers</b>&gt;.   Add
              <b>Private</b> <b>::</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Upload</b> into the list to prevent a private package  from  uploading  on  PyPI  by
              accident.

       <b>requires-python</b>
              A  version  specifier  for  the versions of Python this requires, e.g. <b>~=3.3</b> or <b>&gt;=3.3,&lt;4</b> which are
              equivalents.

       <b>dist-name</b>
              If you want your package's name on PyPI to be different from the importable module name, set  this
              to the PyPI name.

       <b>keywords</b>
              Comma separated list of words to help with searching for your package.

       <b>license</b>
              The  name  of  a  license,  if  you're  using  one  for which there isn't a Trove classifier. It's
              recommended to use Trove classifiers instead of this in most cases.

       <b>maintainer,</b> <b>maintainer-email</b>
              Like author, for if you've taken over a project from someone else.

       Here was the metadata section from flit using the older style:

       With no configuration, Flit can make an sdist with everything it needs to build and install your  module:
       the  package contents (including non-Python data files, but not <b>.pyc</b> bytecode files), your <b>pyproject.toml</b>
       file, the readme &amp; license files given in the metadata, and the <u>external</u> <u>data</u>  <u>folder</u>  if  you  specified
       that.

       If  you  want  more  control, you can give lists of paths or glob patterns as <b>include</b> and <b>exclude</b> in this
       section. For example:

          [tool.flit.sdist]
          include = ["doc/"]
          exclude = ["doc/*.html"]

       These paths:

       • Always use <b>/</b> as a separator (POSIX style)

       • Must be relative paths from the directory containing <b>pyproject.toml</b>

       • Cannot go outside that directory (no <b>../</b> paths)

       • Cannot contain control characters or <b>&lt;&gt;:"\\</b>

       • Can refer to directories, in  which  case  they  include  everything  under  the  directory,  including
         subdirectories

       • Should match the case of the files they refer to, as case-insensitive matching is platform dependent

       Changed in version 3.8: Include and exclude patterns can now use recursive glob patterns (<b>**</b>).

       Exclusions have priority over inclusions. Bytecode is excluded by default and cannot be included.

   <b>Including</b> <b>files</b> <b>committed</b> <b>in</b> <b>git/hg</b>
       If  you  use  <u>flit</u>  <u>build</u> or <u>flit</u> <u>publish</u>, you can also make sdists with the files which are committed in
       version control (git or hg). This is a shortcut to e.g. include documentation source files, but not built
       HTML or PDF documentation. The include and exclude patterns are then applied on top of this list.

       For now, including files from version control is the default for <u>flit</u> <u>build</u> and <u>flit</u> <u>publish</u>, and can  be
       disabled with <b>--no-use-vcs</b>. The default will switch in a future version.

       Using  <b>flit_core</b> as a backend to other tools such as <u>build</u> &lt;<b>https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</b>&gt;
       never gets the list of files for the sdist from version control.

   <b>External</b> <b>data</b> <b>section</b>
       New in version 3.7.

       Data files which your code will use should go inside the Python package folder.  Flit will package  these
       with no special configuration.

       However,  sometimes  it's  useful  to package external files for system integration, such as man pages or
       files defining a Jupyter extension. To do this, arrange the files within a directory such as  <b>data</b>,  next
       to your <b>pyproject.toml</b> file, and add a section like this:

          [tool.flit.external-data]
          directory = "data"

       Paths  within  this  directory  are  typically installed to corresponding paths under a prefix (such as a
       virtualenv directory). E.g. you might save a man page for a script as <b>(data)/share/man/man1/foo.1</b>.

       Whether these files are detected by the systems they're meant to  integrate  with  depends  on  how  your
       package  is  installed  and  how  those systems are configured.  For instance, installing in a virtualenv
       usually doesn't affect anything outside that environment. Don't rely  on  these  files  being  picked  up
       unless you have close control of how the package will be installed.

       If  you  install  a  package with <b>flit</b> <b>install</b> <b>--symlink</b>, a symlink is made for each file in the external
       data directory. Otherwise (including development installs with <b>pip</b> <b>install</b> <b>-e</b>), these files are copied to
       their destination, so changes here won't take effect until you reinstall the package.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          For users coming from setuptools: external  data  corresponds  to  setuptools'  <b>data_files</b>  parameter,
          although setuptools offers more flexibility.

   <b>Flit</b> <b>command</b> <b>line</b> <b>interface</b>
       All operations use the <b>flit</b> command, followed by one of a number of subcommands.

   <b>Common</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-f</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;,</b> <b>--ini-file</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Path to a config file specifying the module to build. The default is <b>pyproject.toml</b>.

       <b>--version</b>
              Show the version of Flit in use.

       <b>--help</b> Show help on the command-line interface.

       <b>--debug</b>
              Show more detailed logs about what flit is doing.

   <b>flit</b> <b>build</b>
       Build a wheel and an sdist (tarball) from the package.

       <b>--format</b> <b>&lt;format&gt;</b>
              Limit to building either <b>wheel</b> or <b>sdist</b>.

       <b>--setup-py</b>
              Generate a <b>setup.py</b> file in the sdist, so it can be installed by older versions of pip.

       <b>--no-setup-py</b>
              Don't  generate  a  setup.py  file in the sdist. This is the default.  An sdist built without this
              will only work with tools that support PEP 517,  but  the  wheel  will  still  be  usable  by  any
              compatible tool.

              Changed in version 3.5: Generating <b>setup.py</b> disabled by default.

       <b>--use-vcs</b>
              Use the files checked in to git or mercurial as the starting list to include in an sdist, and then
              apply inclusions and exclusions <u>from</u> <u>pyproject.toml</u>.

              This  is  the  default  for  now, but we're planning to switch to <b>--no-use-vcs</b> as the default in a
              future version.

       <b>--no-use-vcs</b>
              Create the sdist starting with only the files inside the installed module or package,  along  with
              any inclusions and exclusions defined in pyproject.toml.

              With  this option, sdists from <b>flit</b> <b>build</b> are equivalent to those built by tools calling Flit as a
              backend, such as <u>build</u> &lt;<b>https://pypa-build.readthedocs.io/en/stable/</b>&gt;.

   <b>flit</b> <b>publish</b>
       Build a wheel and an sdist (tarball) from the package, and upload them to PyPI or another repository.

       <b>--format</b> <b>&lt;format&gt;</b>
              Limit to publishing either <b>wheel</b> or <b>sdist</b>.  You should normally publish the two formats together.

       <b>--setup-py</b>

       <b>--no-setup-py</b>

       <b>--use-vcs</b>

       <b>--no-use-vcs</b>
              These options affecting what goes in the sdist are described for <u>flit</u> <u>build</u> above.

       <b>--repository</b> <b>&lt;repository&gt;</b>
              Name of a repository to upload packages to. Should match a section in <b><a href="file:~/.pypirc">~/.pypirc</a></b>.  The  default  is
              <b>pypi</b>.

       <b>--pypirc</b> <b>&lt;pypirc&gt;</b>
              The .pypirc config file to be used. The default is <b><a href="file:~/.pypirc">~/.pypirc</a></b>.

       <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO:</b>
          <u>Controlling</u> <u>package</u> <u>uploads</u>

   <b>flit</b> <b>install</b>
       Install the package on your system.

       By default, the package is installed to the same Python environment that Flit itself is installed in; use
       <u>--python</u> or <u>FLIT_INSTALL_PYTHON</u> to override this.

       If  you  don't have permission to modify the environment (e.g. the system Python on Linux), Flit may do a
       user install instead. Use the <u>--user</u> or <u>--env</u> flags to force this one  way  or  the  other,  rather  than
       letting Flit guess.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--symlink</b>
              Symlink the module into site-packages rather than copying it, so that you can test changes without
              reinstalling the module.

       <b>--pth-file</b>
              Create  a  <b>.pth</b>  file  in  site-packages  rather  than copying the module, so you can test changes
              without reinstalling. This is a less elegant alternative to <b>--symlink</b>, but it  works  on  Windows,
              which typically doesn't allow symlinks.

       <b>--deps</b> <b>&lt;dependency</b> <b>option&gt;</b>
              Which  dependencies  to install. One of <b>all</b>, <b>production</b>, <b>develop</b>, or <b>none</b>. <b>all</b> and <b>develop</b> install
              the extras <b>test</b>, <b>doc</b>, and <b>dev</b>. Default <b>all</b>.

       <b>--extras</b> <b>&lt;extra[,extra,...]&gt;</b>
              Which named extra features to install dependencies  for.  Specify  <b>all</b>  to  install  all  optional
              dependencies, or a comma-separated list of extras.  Default depends on <b>--deps</b>.

       <b>--only-deps</b>
              Install the dependencies of this package, but not the package itself.

              This  can  be useful for e.g. building a container image, where your own code is copied or mounted
              into the container at a later stage.

              New in version 3.8.

       <b>--user</b> Do a user-local installation. This is the default if flit is not in a virtualenv or conda env  (if
              the environment's library directory is read-only and <b>site.ENABLE_USER_SITE</b> is true).

       <b>--env</b>  Install  into  the  environment  - the opposite of <u>--user</u>.  This is the default in a virtualenv or
              conda env (if the environment's library directory is writable or <b>site.ENABLE_USER_SITE</b> is false).

       <b>--python</b> <b>&lt;path</b> <b>to</b> <b>python&gt;</b>
              Install for another Python, identified by the path of the python executable.  Using  this  option,
              you can install a module for Python 2, for instance. See <u>FLIT_INSTALL_PYTHON</u> if this option is not
              given.

              Changed  in  version 2.1: Added <u>FLIT_INSTALL_PYTHON</u> and use its value over the Python running Flit
              when an explicit <u>--python</u> option is not given.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Flit calls pip to do the installation. You  can  set  any  of  pip's  options  <u>using</u>  <u>its</u>  <u>environment</u>
          <u>variables</u> &lt;<b>https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/configuration/#environment-variables</b>&gt;.

          When you use the <u>--symlink</u> or <u>--pth-file</u> options, pip is used to install dependencies. Otherwise, Flit
          builds a wheel and then calls pip to install that.

   <b>flit</b> <b>init</b>
       Create  a  new  <b>pyproject.toml</b>   config file by prompting for information about the module in the current
       directory.

   <b>Environment</b> <b>variables</b>
       <b>FLIT_NO_NETWORK</b>
              New in version 0.10.

              Setting this to any non-empty value will stop flit from making  network  connections  (unless  you
              explicitly  ask  to  upload  a  package). This is intended for downstream packagers, so if you use
              this, it's up to you to ensure any necessary dependencies are installed.

       <b>FLIT_ROOT_INSTALL</b>
              By default, <b>flit</b> <b>install</b> will fail when run as root on POSIX systems,  because  installing  Python
              modules  systemwide is not recommended. Setting this to any non-empty value allows installation as
              root. It has no effect on Windows.

       <b>FLIT_USERNAME</b>

       <b>FLIT_PASSWORD</b>

       <b>FLIT_INDEX_URL</b>
              New in version 0.11.

              Set a username, password, and index URL for  uploading  packages.   See  <u>uploading</u>  <u>packages</u>  <u>with</u>
              <u>environment</u> <u>variables</u> for more information.

              Token-based  upload  to  PyPI  is  supported.  To  upload using a PyPI token, set <b>FLIT_USERNAME</b> to
              <b>__token__</b>, and <b>FLIT_PASSWORD</b> to the token value.

       <b>FLIT_ALLOW_INVALID</b>
              New in version 0.13.

              Setting this to any non-empty value tells Flit to continue if it detects invalid metadata, instead
              of failing with an error. Problems will still be reported in the logs, but  won't  cause  Flit  to
              stop.

              If  the  metadata  is  invalid,  uploading the package to PyPI may fail. This environment variable
              provides an escape hatch in case Flit incorrectly rejects your valid metadata. If you need to  use
              it     and     you    believe    your    metadata    is    valid,    please    <u>open</u>    <u>an</u>    <u>issue</u>
              &lt;<b>https://github.com/pypa/flit/issues</b>&gt;.

       <b>FLIT_INSTALL_PYTHON</b>
              New in version 2.1.

              Set a default Python interpreter for <u>flit</u> <u>install</u> to use when <u>--python</u> is not specified. The value
              can be either an absolute path, or a command name (which will be found in <b>PATH</b>). If this is  unset
              or empty, the module is installed for the copy of Python that is running Flit.

       <b>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</b>
              To make reproducible builds, set this to a timestamp as a number of seconds since the start of the
              year  1970  in UTC, and document the value you used.  On Unix systems, you can get a value for the
              current time by running:

                 date +%s

              <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO:</b>
                 <u>The</u> <u>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</u> <u>specification</u> &lt;<b>https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/</b>&gt;

   <b>Controlling</b> <b>package</b> <b>uploads</b>
       The command <b>flit</b> <b>publish</b> will upload your package to a package index server.  The  default  settings  let
       you upload to <u>PyPI</u> &lt;<b>https://pypi.org/</b>&gt;, the default Python Package Index, with a single user account.

       If  you  want  to  upload to other servers, or with more than one user account, or upload packages from a
       continuous integration job, you can configure Flit in two main ways:

   <b>Using</b> <b>.pypirc</b>
       You can create or edit a config file in your home directory, <b><a href="file:~/.pypirc">~/.pypirc</a></b> that will be used  by  default  or
       you  can  specify  a  custom  location.   This  is  also  used  by  other  Python  tools  such  as  <u>twine</u>
       &lt;<b>https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine</b>&gt;.

       For instance, to upload a package to the <u>Test</u> <u>PyPI</u> <u>server</u> &lt;<b>https://test.pypi.org/</b>&gt; instead of the  normal
       PyPI, use a config file looking like this:

          [distutils]
          index-servers =
             pypi
             testpypi

          [pypi]
          repository = https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
          username = sirrobin  # Replace with your PyPI username

          [testpypi]
          repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
          username = sirrobin  # Replace with your TestPyPI username

       You can select an index server from this config file with the <u>--repository</u> option:

          flit publish --repository testpypi

       If  you  don't  use this option, Flit will use the server called <b>pypi</b> in the config file. If that doesn't
       exist, it uploads to PyPI at <b>https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/</b> by default.

       If you publish a package and you don't have a <b>.pypirc</b> file, Flit will create it to store your username.

       Flit tries to store your  password  securely  using  the  <u>keyring</u>  &lt;<b>https://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring</b>&gt;
       library.   If  keyring is not installed, Flit will ask for your password for each upload.  Alternatively,
       you can also manually add your password to the <b>.pypirc</b> file (<b>password</b> <b>=</b> <b>...</b>)

   <b>Using</b> <b>environment</b> <b>variables</b>
       You can specify a server to upload to with <u>FLIT_INDEX_URL</u>, and pass credentials  with  <u>FLIT_USERNAME</u>  and
       <u>FLIT_PASSWORD</u>.   Environment  variables  take  precedence  over  the  config  file, except if you use the
       <u>--repository</u> option to explicitly pick a server from the config file.

       This can make it easier  to  automate  uploads,  for  example  to  release  packages  from  a  continuous
       integration job.

       <b>WARNING:</b>
          Storing  a  password  in  an environment variable is convenient, but it's <u>easy</u> <u>to</u> <u>accidentally</u> <u>leak</u> <u>it</u>
          &lt;<b>https://www.diogomonica.com/2017/03/27/why-you-shouldnt-use-env-variables-for-secret-data/</b>&gt;.     Look
          out  for scripts that helpfully print all environment variables for debugging, and remember that other
          scripts and libraries you run in that environment have access to your password.

   <b>Reproducible</b> <b>builds</b>
       New in version 0.8.

       Wheels built by flit are reproducible: if you build from the same source code, you should be able to make
       wheels that are exactly identical, byte for byte.  This  is  useful  for  verifying  software.  For  more
       details, see <u>reproducible-builds.org</u> &lt;<b>https://reproducible-builds.org/</b>&gt;.

       There  is  a  caveat,  however: wheels (which are zip files) include the modification timestamp from each
       file. This will probably be different on each computer, because it indicates when your local copy of  the
       file  was written, not when it was changed in version control.  These timestamps can be overridden by the
       environment variable <u>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</u>.

          SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$(date +%s)
          flit publish
          # Record the value of SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH in release notes for reproduction

       Changed in version 0.12: Normalising permission bits

       Flit normalises the permission bits of files copied into a wheel to either 755 (executable) or 644.  This
       means that a file is readable by all users and writable only by the user who owns it.

       The  most  popular  version  control  systems  only  track  the  executable bit, so checking out the same
       repository on systems with different umasks (e.g.  Debian  and  Fedora)  produces  files  with  different
       permissions. With Flit 0.11 and earlier, this difference would produce non-identical wheels.

   <b>Why</b> <b>use</b> <b>Flit?</b>
       <u>Make</u>  <u>the</u>  <u>easy</u> <u>things</u> <u>easy</u> <u>and</u> <u>the</u> <u>hard</u> <u>things</u> <u>possible</u> is an old motto from the Perl community. Flit is
       entirely focused on the <u>easy</u> <u>things</u> part of that, and leaves the hard things up to other tools.

       Specifically, the easy things are pure Python packages with no build steps (neither compiling C code, nor
       bundling Javascript, etc.). The vast majority of packages on PyPI are like this: plain Python code,  with
       maybe some static data files like icons included.

       It's  easy to underestimate the challenges involved in distributing and installing code, because it seems
       like you just need to copy some files into the right place. There's a whole lot of metadata  and  tooling
       that has to work together around that fundamental step. But with the right tooling, a developer who wants
       to release their code doesn't need to know about most of that.

       What, specifically, does Flit make easy?

       • <b>flit</b> <b>init</b> helps you set up the information Flit needs about your package.

       • Subpackages are automatically included: you only need to specify the top-level package.

       • Data files within a package directory are automatically included.  Missing data files has been a common
         packaging mistake with other tools.

       • The  version  number  is  taken  from  your package's <b>__version__</b> attribute, so that always matches the
         version that tools like pip see.

       • <b>flit</b> <b>publish</b> uploads a package to PyPI, so you don't need a separate tool to do this.

       Setuptools, the most common tool for Python packaging, now has shortcuts for many of the same things. But
       it has to stay compatible with projects published many years ago, which limits what it can do by default.

       Flit also has some support for <u>reproducible</u> <u>builds</u>, a feature which some people care about.

       There have been many other efforts to improve the user  experience  of  Python  packaging,  such  as  <u>pbr</u>
       &lt;<b>https://pypi.org/project/pbr/</b>&gt;, but before Flit, these tended to build on setuptools and distutils. That
       was a pragmatic decision, but it's hard to build something radically different on top of those libraries.
       The    existence    of    Flit    spurred    the   development   of   new   standards,   like   <u>PEP</u>   <u>518</u>
       &lt;<b>https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/</b>&gt; and <u>PEP</u> <u>517</u> &lt;<b>https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/</b>&gt;, which are  now  used
       by    other    packaging    tools    such    as    <u>Poetry</u>    &lt;<b>https://python-poetry.org/</b>&gt;   and   <u>Enscons</u>
       &lt;<b>https://pypi.org/project/enscons/</b>&gt;.

   <b>Other</b> <b>options</b>
       If  your   package   needs   a   build   step,   you   won't   be   able   to   use   Flit.    <u>Setuptools</u>
       &lt;<b>https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</b>&gt;  is the de-facto standard, but newer tools such as <u>Enscons</u>
       &lt;<b>https://pypi.org/project/enscons/</b>&gt; also cover this case.

       Flit also doesn't help you manage dependencies: you have to add them to  <b>pyproject.toml</b>  by  hand.  Tools
       like  <u>Poetry</u>  &lt;<b>https://python-poetry.org/</b>&gt;  and  <u>Pipenv</u>  &lt;<b>https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/</b>&gt; have features
       which help add and update dependencies on other packages.

   <b>Bootstrapping</b>
       Flit is itself packaged using Flit, as are some foundational packaging tools such as <b>pep517</b>. So where can
       you start if you need to install everything from source?

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          For most users, <b>pip</b> handles all this automatically. You should only need to deal with this  if  you're
          building things entirely from scratch, such as putting Python packages into another package format.

       The  key piece is <b>flit_core</b>. This is a package which can build itself using nothing except Python and the
       standard library. From an unpacked source archive, you can make a wheel by running:

          python -m flit_core.wheel

       And then you can install this wheel with the <b>bootstrap_install.py</b> script included in  the  sdist  (or  by
       unzipping it to the correct directory):

          # Install to site-packages for this Python:
          python bootstrap_install.py dist/flit_core-*.whl

          # Install somewhere else:
          python bootstrap_install.py --installdir /path/to/site-packages dist/flit_core-*.whl

       As  of  version 3.6, flit_core bundles the <b>tomli</b> TOML parser, to avoid a dependency cycle. If you need to
       unbundle it, you will need to special-case installing flit_core and/or tomli to get around that cycle.

       After <b>flit_core</b>, I recommend that you get <u>installer</u> &lt;<b>https://pypi.org/project/installer/</b>&gt; set up. You can
       use <b>python</b> <b>-m</b> <b>flit_core.wheel</b> again to make a wheel, and then  use  installer  itself  (from  the  source
       directory) to install it.

       After  that,  you  probably  want  to  get  <u>build</u>  &lt;<b>https://pypi.org/project/build/</b>&gt; and its dependencies
       installed as the goal of the bootstrapping phase. You can then use <b>build</b> to create wheels  of  any  other
       Python packages, and <b>installer</b> to install them.

   <b>Developing</b> <b>Flit</b>
       To get a development installation of Flit itself:

          git clone https://github.com/pypa/flit.git
          cd flit
          python3 -m pip install docutils requests
          python3 bootstrap_dev.py

       This  links Flit into the current Python environment, so you can make changes and try them without having
       to reinstall each time.

   <b>Testing</b>
       To run the tests in separate environments for each available Python version:

          tox

       <u>tox</u> &lt;<b>https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</b>&gt; has many options.

       To run the tests in your current environment, run:

          pytest

   <b>Release</b> <b>history</b>
   <b>Version</b> <b>3.9</b>
       • New options <u>flit</u> <u>build</u> <u>--use-vcs</u> and  <u>flit</u>  <u>build</u>  <u>--no-use-vcs</u>  to  enable  &amp;  disable  including  all
         committed  files  in  the  sdist.  For  now <b>--use-vcs</b> is the default, but this is likely to change in a
         future version, to bring <b>flit</b> <b>build</b> in line with standard build frontends like <b>python</b> <b>-m</b> <b>build</b> (
         :ghpull:`625`
         ).

       • Sdist file names, and the name of the top-level folder in an sdist, are now normalised,  in  accordance
         with <u>PEP</u> <u>625</u> &lt;<b>https://peps.python.org/pep-0625/</b>&gt; (
         :ghpull:`628`
         ).

       • A  statically  defined  version  number  can now be parsed from files called <b>version.py</b>, <b>_version.py</b> or
         <b>__version__.py</b> inside a packge, as well as from <b>__init__.py</b>, so executing code  is  required  in  fewer
         cases (
         :ghpull:`630`
         ).

       • Fix setting the flag for regular files in zip metadata (
         :ghpull:`639`
         ).

       • The  timestamp  embedded  in  the  gzip wrapper for sdists now defaults to a fixed date, so building an
         sdist twice on the same machine should produce identical results, even without any special steps (
         :ghpull:`635`
         ). Setting <u>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</u> is still recommended for properly <u>reproducible</u> <u>builds</u>.

   <b>Version</b> <b>3.8</b>
       • A project name containing hyphens is now automatically translated to use  underscores  for  the  import
         name (
         :ghpull:`566`
         ).

       • New  option  <u>flit</u>  <u>install</u>  <u>--only-deps</u> to install the dependencies of the package, but not the package
         itself.

       • Add support for recursive globbing (<b>**</b>) in sdist includes and excludes (
         :ghpull:`550`
         ).

       • Python's bytecode cache files (<b>__pycache__</b> folders and <b>.pyc</b> files) are now always excluded from  sdists
         (
         :ghpull:`581`
         ).

       • Use tomllib in Python 3.11, rather than tomli (
         :ghpull:`573`
         ,
         :ghpull:`604`
         ).

       • Fix crash when unable to get a password from <b>keyring</b> (
         :ghpull:`567`
         ).

       • Fix including modified files in sdist when using Mercurial (
         :ghpull:`541`
         ).

       • Fix for some cases of determining whether a package supports Python 2 or not (
         :ghpull:`593`
         ).

       • Fix parsing version number from code using multiple assignments (
         :ghpull:`474`
         ).

       • Document how to use a PyPI token with <u>FLIT_PASSWORD</u> (
         :ghpull:`602`
         ).

       • Fix link to information about environment variables for pip (
         :ghpull:`576`
         ).

       • Link to the docs for the latest stable version in package metadata (
         :ghpull:`589`
         ).

       • Remove a mention of the <b>toml</b> package, which is no longer needed, from the <u>Developing</u> <u>Flit</u> page (
         :ghpull:`601`
         ).

       • The <u>bootstrap</u> install script for <b>flit_core</b> accepts a new <b>--install-root</b> option.

       • Ensure the license file is included in packages on PyPI (
         :ghpull:`603`
         ).

   <b>Version</b> <b>3.7.1</b>
       • Fix  building  packages  which  need execution to get the version number, and have a relative import in
         <b>__init__.py</b> (
         :ghpull:`531`
         ).

   <b>Version</b> <b>3.7</b>
       • Support for <u>external</u> <u>data</u> <u>files</u> such as man pages or Jupyter extension support files (
         :ghpull:`510`
         ).

       • Project names are now lowercase in wheel filenames and  <b>.dist-info</b>  folder  names,  in  line  with  the
         specifications (
         :ghpull:`498`
         ).

       • Improved support for <u>bootstrapping</u> a Python environment, e.g. for downstream packagers (
         :ghpull:`511`
         ).    <b>flit_core.wheel</b>    is   usable   with   <b>python</b>   <b>-m</b>   to   create   wheels   before   the   <u>build</u>
         &lt;<b>https://pypi.org/project/build/</b>&gt; tool is available, and <b>flit_core</b> sdists  also  include  a  script  to
         install itself from a wheel before <u>installer</u> &lt;<b>https://pypi.org/project/installer/</b>&gt; is available.

       • Use newer importlib APIs, fixing some deprecation warnings (
         :ghpull:`499`
         ).

   <b>Version</b> <b>3.6</b>
       • <b>flit_core</b>  now  bundles the <u>tomli</u> &lt;<b>https://pypi.org/project/tomli/</b>&gt; TOML parser library (version 1.2.3)
         to avoid a circular dependency between <b>flit_core</b> and <b>tomli</b> (
         :ghpull:`492`
         ). This means <b>flit_core</b> now has no dependencies except  Python  itself,  both  at  build  time  and  at
         runtime, simplifying <u>bootstrapping</u>.

   <b>Version</b> <b>3.5.1</b>
       • Fix  development  installs  with  <b>flit</b>  <b>install</b>  <b>--symlink</b>  and <b>--pth-file</b>, which were broken in 3.5.0,
         especially for packages using a <b>src</b> folder (
         :ghpull:`472`
         ).

   <b>Version</b> <b>3.5</b>
       • You can now use Flit to distribute a module or package inside a namespace package (as  defined  by  <u>PEP</u>
         <u>420</u>  &lt;<b>https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/</b>&gt;).  To  do this, specify the import name of the concrete, inner
         module you are packaging - e.g. <b>name</b> <b>=</b> <b>"sphinxcontrib.foo"</b> - either in the <b>[project]</b>  table,  or  under
         <b>[tool.flit.module]</b> if you want to use a different name on PyPI (
         :ghpull:`468`
         ).

       • Flit no longer generates a <b>setup.py</b> file in sdists (<b>.tar.gz</b> packages) by default (
         :ghpull:`462`
         ).  Modern  packaging tools don't need this. You can use the <b>--setup-py</b> flag to keep adding it for now,
         but this will probably be removed at some point in the future.

       • Fixed how <b>flit</b> <b>init</b> handles authors' names with non-ASCII characters (
         :ghpull:`460`
         ).

       • When <b>flit</b> <b>init</b> generates a LICENSE file, the new <b>pyproject.toml</b> now references it (
         :ghpull:`467`
         ).

   <b>Version</b> <b>3.4</b>
       • Python 3.6 or above is now required, both for <b>flit</b> and <b>flit_core</b>.

       • Add a <b>--setup-py</b> option to  <b>flit</b>  <b>build</b>  and  <b>flit</b>  <b>publish</b>,  and  a  warning  when  neither  this  nor
         <b>--no-setup-py</b> are specified (
         :ghpull:`431`
         ).  A future version will stop generating <b>setup.py</b> files in sdists by default.

       • Add   support   for   standardised  editable  installs  -  <b>pip</b>  <b>install</b>  <b>-e</b>  -  according  to  <u>PEP</u>  <u>660</u>
         &lt;<b>https://peps.python.org/pep-0660/</b>&gt; (
         :ghpull:`400`
         ).

       • Add a <b>--pypirc</b> option for <b>flit</b> <b>publish</b> to  specify  an  alternative  path  to  a  <b>.pypirc</b>  config  file
         describing package indexes (
         :ghpull:`434`
         ).

       • Fix installing dependencies specified in a <b>[project]</b> table (
         :ghpull:`433`
         ).

       • Fix building wheels when <b>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</b> (see <u>Reproducible</u> <u>builds</u>) is set to a date before 1980 (
         :ghpull:`448`
         ).

       • Switch to using the <u>tomli</u> &lt;<b>https://pypi.org/project/tomli/</b>&gt; TOML parser, in common with other packaging
         projects (
         :ghpull:`438`
         ).  This supports TOML version 1.0.

       • Add a document on <u>Bootstrapping</u> (
         :ghpull:`441`
         ).

   <b>Version</b> <b>3.3</b>
       • <b>PKG-INFO</b>  files in sdists are now generated the same way as <b>METADATA</b> in wheels, fixing some issues with
         sdists (
         :ghpull:`410`
         ).

       • <b>flit</b> <b>publish</b> now sends SHA-256 hashes, fixing uploads to GitLab package repositories (
         :ghpull:`416`
         ).

       • The <b>[project]</b> metadata table from <u>PEP</u> <u>621</u> &lt;<b>https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/</b>&gt; is  now  fully  supported
         and  <u>documented</u>.  Projects  using  this  can  now  specify  <b>requires</b>  <b>=</b>  <b>["flit_core</b>  <b>&gt;=3.2,&lt;4"]</b> in the
         <b>[build-system]</b> table.

   <b>Version</b> <b>3.2</b>
       • Experimental support for specifying metadata in a <b>[project]</b> table in <b>pyproject.toml</b> as specified by <u>PEP</u>
         <u>621</u> &lt;<b>https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/</b>&gt; (
         :ghpull:`393`
         ). If you try using this, please specify <b>requires</b> <b>=</b> <b>["flit_core</b> <b>&gt;=3.2.0,&lt;3.3"]</b>  in  the  <b>[build-system]</b>
         table for now, in case it needs to change for the next release.

       • Fix writing METADATA file with multi-line information in certain fields such as <b>Author</b> (
         :ghpull:`402`
         ).

       • Fix building wheel when a directory such as LICENSES appears in the project root directory (
         :ghpull:`401`
         ).

   <b>Version</b> <b>3.1</b>
       • Update  handling  of  names  &amp;  version  numbers in wheel filenames and <b>.dist-info</b> folders in line with
         changes in the specs (
         :ghpull:`395`
         ).

       • Switch from the deprecated <b>pytoml</b> package to <b>toml</b> (
         :ghpull:`378`
         ).

       • Fix specifying backend-path in <b>pyproject.toml</b> for flit-core (as a list instead of a string).

   <b>Version</b> <b>3.0</b>
       Breaking changes:

       • Projects must now provide Flit with information in <b>pyproject.toml</b> files, not the older <b>flit.ini</b>  format
         (
         :ghpull:`338`
         ).

       • <b>flit_core</b>  once  again  requires Python 3 (&gt;=3.4). Packages that support Python 2 can still be built by
         <b>flit_core</b> 2.x, but can't rely on new features (
         :ghpull:`342`
         ).

       • The deprecated <b>flit</b> <b>installfrom</b> command was removed (
         :ghpull:`334`
         ).  You can use <b>pip</b> <b>install</b> <b>git+https://github.com/...</b> instead.

       Features and fixes:

       • Fix building sdists from a git repository with non-ASCII characters in filenames (
         :ghpull:`346`
         ).

       • Fix identifying the version number when the code contains a subscript assignment before <b>__version__</b> <b>=</b> (
         :ghpull:`348`
         ).

       • Script entry points can now use a class method (
         :ghpull:`359`
         ).

       • Set suitable permission bits on metadata files in wheels (
         :ghpull:`256`
         ).

       • Fixed line endings in the <b>RECORD</b> file when installing on Windows (
         :ghpull:`368`
         ).

       • Support    for    recording    the    source    of    local    installations,    as    in    <u>PEP</u>    <u>610</u>
         &lt;<b>https://peps.python.org/pep-0610/</b>&gt; (
         :ghpull:`335`
         ).

       • <b>flit</b>  <b>init</b>  will  check  for  a  README  in  the  root  of  the  project  and  automatically  set it as
         <b>description-file</b> (
         :ghpull:`337`
         ).

       • Pygments is not required for checking reStructuredText READMEs (
         :ghpull:`357`
         ).

       • Packages where the version number can be recognised without  executing  their  code  don't  need  their
         dependencies installed to build, which should make them build faster (
         :ghpull:`361`
         ).

       • Ensure the installed <b>RECORD</b> file is predictably ordered (
         :ghpull:`366`
         ).

   <b>Version</b> <b>2.3</b>
       • New projects created with <u>flit</u> <u>init</u> now declare that they require <b>flit_core</b> <b>&gt;=2,&lt;4</b> (
         :ghpull:`328`
         ). Any projects using <b>pyproject.toml</b> (not <b>flit.ini</b>) should be compatible with flit 3.x.

       • Fix selecting files from a git submodule to include in an sdist (
         :ghpull:`324`
         ).

       • Fix checking classifiers when no writeable cache directory is available (
         :ghpull:`319`
         ).

       • Better errors when trying to install to a mis-spelled or missing Python interpreter (
         :ghpull:`331`
         ).

       • Fix specifying <b>--repository</b> before <b>upload</b> (
         :ghpull:`322`
         ). Passing the option like this is deprecated, and you should now pass it after <b>upload</b>.

       • Documentation improvements (
         :ghpull:`327`
         ,
         :ghpull:`318`
         ,
         :ghpull:`314`
         )

   <b>Version</b> <b>2.2</b>
       • Allow underscores in package names with Python 2 (
         :ghpull:`305`
         ).

       • Add a <b>--no-setup-py</b> option to build sdists without a backwards-compatible <b>setup.py</b> file (
         :ghpull:`311`
         ).

       • Fix the generated <b>setup.py</b> file for packages using a <b>src/</b> layout (
         :ghpull:`303`
         ).

       • Fix detecting when more than one file matches the module name specified (
         :ghpull:`307`
         ).

       • Fix installing to a venv on Windows with the <b>--python</b> option (
         :ghpull:`300`
         ).

       • Don't echo the command in scripts installed with <b>--symlink</b> or <b>--pth-file</b> on Windows (
         :ghpull:`310`
         ).

       • New <b>bootstrap_dev.py</b> script to set up a development installation of Flit from the repository (
         :ghpull:`301`
         ,
         :ghpull:`306`
         ).

   <b>Version</b> <b>2.1</b>
       • Use compression when adding files to wheels.

       • Added the <u>FLIT_INSTALL_PYTHON</u> environment variable (
         :ghpull:`295`
         ), to configure flit to always install into a Python other than the one it's running on.

       • <b>flit_core</b> uses the <b>intreehooks</b> shim package to load its bootstrapping backend, until a released version
         of pip supports the standard <b>backend-path</b> mechanism.

   <b>Version</b> <b>2.0</b>
       Flit   2   is   a   major   architecture   change.   The   <b>flit_core</b>  package  now  provides  a  <u>PEP</u>  <u>517</u>
       &lt;<b>https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/</b>&gt; backend for building packages, while <b>flit</b> is a <u>command</u> <u>line</u> <u>interface</u>
       extending that.

       The build backend works on Python 2, so tools like pip should be able to install packages built with flit
       from source on Python 2.  The <b>flit</b> command requires Python 3.5 or above.  You will  need  to  change  the
       build-system table in your <b>pyproject.toml</b> file to look like this:

          [build-system]
          requires = ["flit_core &gt;=2,&lt;4"]
          build-backend = "flit_core.buildapi"

       Other changes include:

       • Support for storing your code under a <b>src/</b> folder (
         :ghpull:`260`
         ).  You don't need to change any configuration if you do this.

       • Options to control what files are included in an sdist - see <u>Sdist</u> <u>section</u> for the details.

       • Requirements  can  specify  a  URL  'direct reference', as an alternative to a version number, with the
         syntax     defined     in     <u>PEP</u>     <u>440</u>     &lt;<b>https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/</b>&gt;:      <b>requests</b>      <b>@</b>
         <b>https://example.com/requests-2.22.0.tar.gz</b>.

       • Fix the shebang of scripts installed with the <b>--python</b> option and the <b>--symlink</b> flag (
         :ghpull:`286`
         ).

       • Installing with <b>--deps</b> <b>develop</b> now installs normal dependencies as well as development dependencies.

       • Author email is no longer required in the metadata table (
         :ghpull:`289`
         ).

       • More error messages are now shown without a traceback (
         :ghpull:`254`
         )

   <b>Version</b> <b>1.3</b>
       • Fix for building sdists from a subdirectory in a Mercurial repository (
         :ghpull:`233`
         ).

       • Fix for getting the docstring and version from modules defining their encoding (
         :ghpull:`239`
         ).

       • Fix for installing packages with <b>flit</b> <b>installfrom</b> (
         :ghpull:`221`
         ).

       • Packages with requirements no longer get a spurious <b>Provides-Extra:</b> <b>.none</b> metadata entry (
         :ghissue:`228`
         ).

       • Better check of whether <b>python-requires</b> includes any Python 2 version (
         :ghpull:`232`
         ).

       • Better check of home page URLs in <b>flit</b> <b>init</b> (
         :ghpull:`230`
         ).

       • Better error message when the description file is not found (
         :ghpull:`234`
         ).

       • Updated a help message to refer to <b>pyproject.toml</b> (
         :ghpull:`240`
         ).

       • Improve tests of <b>flit</b> <b>init</b> (
         :ghpull:`229`
         ).

   <b>Version</b> <b>1.2.1</b>
       • Fix for installing packages with <b>flit</b> <b>install</b>.

       • Make  <b>requests_download</b>  an  extra  dependency,  to  avoid  a  circular  build  dependency. To use <b>flit</b>
         <b>installfrom</b>, you can install with <b>pip</b> <b>install</b> <b>flit[installfrom]</b>. Note that the  <b>installfrom</b>  subcommand
         is deprecated, as it will soon be possible to use pip to install Flit projects directly from a VCS URL.

   <b>Version</b> <b>1.2</b>
       • Fixes  for  packages  specifying <b>requires-extra</b>: sdists should now work, and environment markers can be
         used together with <b>requires-extra</b>.

       • Fix running <b>flit</b> <b>installfrom</b> without a config file present in the working directory.

       • The error message for a missing or empty docstring tells you what file the docstring should be in.

       • Improvements to documentation on version selectors for requirements.

   <b>Version</b> <b>1.1</b>
       • Packages can now have 'extras', specified as <b>requires-extra</b>  in  the  <u>pyproject.toml</u>  <u>file</u>.  These  are
         additional dependencies for optional features.

       • The <b>home-page</b> metadata field is no longer required.

       • Additional project URLs are now validated.

       • <b>flit</b> <b>-V</b> is now equivalent to <b>flit</b> <b>--version</b>.

       • Various improvements to documentation.

   <b>Version</b> <b>1.0</b>
       • The description file may now be written in reStructuredText, Markdown or plain text. The file extension
         should indicate which of these formats it is (<b>.rst</b>, <b>.md</b> or <b>.txt</b>). Previously, only reStructuredText was
         officially supported.

       • Multiple    links   (e.g.   documentation,   bug   tracker)   can   now   be   specified   in   a   new
         <u>[tool.flit.metadata.urls]</u> <u>section</u> of <b>pyproject.toml</b>.

       • Dependencies are now correctly installed to the target Python when you use the <b>--symlink</b> or  <b>--pth-file</b>
         options.

       • Dependencies  are  only  installed to the Python where Flit is running if it fails to get the docstring
         and version number without them.

       • The commands deprecated in 0.13—<b>flit</b> <b>wheel</b>, <b>flit</b> <b>sdist</b> and <b>flit</b> <b>register</b>—have been removed.

       Although version 1.0 sounds like  a  milestone,  there's  nothing  that  makes  this  release  especially
       significant.  It  doesn't  represent  a step change in stability or completeness. Flit has been gradually
       maturing for some time, and I chose this point to end the series of 0.x version numbers.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.13</b>
       • Better validation of several metadata fields (<b>dist-name</b>, <b>requires</b>, <b>requires-python</b>, <b>home-page</b>), and  of
         the version number.

       • New <u>FLIT_ALLOW_INVALID</u> environment variable to ignore validation failures in case they go wrong.

       • The  list  of valid classifiers is now fetched from Warehouse (<u>https://pypi.org</u>), rather than the older
         <u>https://pypi.python.org</u> site.

       • Deprecated <b>flit</b> <b>wheel</b> and <b>flit</b> <b>sdist</b> subcommands: use <u>flit</u> <u>build</u>.

       • Deprecated <b>flit</b> <b>register</b>: you can no longer register a package separately from uploading it.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.12.3</b>
       • Fix building and installing packages with a <b>-</b> in the distribution name.

       • Fix numbering in README.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.12.2</b>
       • New tool to convert <b>flit.ini</b> to <b>pyproject.toml</b>:

            python3 -m flit.tomlify

       • Use the PAX tar format for sdists, as specified by PEP 517.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.12.1</b>
       • Restore dependency on <b>zipfile36</b> backport package.

       • Add some missing options to documentation of <b>flit</b> <b>install</b> subcommand.

       • Rearrange environment variables in the docs.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.12</b>
       • Switch the config to <b>pyproject.toml</b> by default instead of <b>flit.ini</b>, and implement the PEP 517 API.

       • A new option <b>--pth-file</b> allows for development installation on Windows (where <b>--symlink</b>  usually  won't
         work).

       • Normalise file permissions in the zip file, making builds more reproducible across different systems.

       • Sdists (.tar.gz packages) can now also be reproducibly built by setting <u>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</u>.

       • For  most  modules, Flit can now extract the version number and docstring without importing it. It will
         still fall back to importing where getting these from the AST fails.

       • <b>flit</b> <b>build</b> will build the wheel from the sdist, helping to ensure that files aren't  left  out  of  the
         sdist.

       • All list fields in the INI file now ignore blank lines (<b>requires</b>, <b>dev-requires</b>, <b>classifiers</b>).

       • Fix the path separator in the <b>RECORD</b> file of a wheel built on Windows.

       • Some minor fixes to building reproducible wheels.

       • If building a wheel fails, the temporary file created will be cleaned up.

       • Various improvements to docs and README.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.11.4</b>
       • Explicitly open various files as UTF-8, rather than relying on locale encoding.

       • Link to docs from README.

       • Better test coverage, and a few minor fixes for problems revealed by tests.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.11.3</b>
       • Fixed a bug causing failed uploads when the password is entered in the terminal.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.11.2</b>
       • A couple of behaviour changes when uploading to warehouse.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.11.1</b>
       • Fixed  a  bug when you use flit to build an sdist from a subdirectory inside a VCS checkout. The VCS is
         now correctly detected.

       • Fix the rst checker for newer versions of docutils, by upgrading the bundled copy of readme_renderer.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.11</b>
       • Flit can now build sdists (tarballs) and upload them to PyPI, if your code is in  a  git  or  mercurial
         repository. There are new commands:

         • <b>flit</b> <b>build</b> builds both a wheel and an sdist.

         • <b>flit</b> <b>publish</b> builds and uploads a wheel and an sdist.

       • Smarter ways of getting the information needed for upload:

         • If  you  have  the  <u>keyring</u> &lt;<b>https://github.com/jaraco/keyring</b>&gt; package installed, flit can use it to
           store your password, rather than keeping it in plain text in <b><a href="file:~/.pypirc">~/.pypirc</a></b>.

         • If <b><a href="file:~/.pypirc">~/.pypirc</a></b> does not already exist, and you are prompted for your username, flit will write it  into
           that file.

         • You   can  provide  the  information  as  environment  variables:  <u>FLIT_USERNAME</u>,  <u>FLIT_PASSWORD</u>  and
           <u>FLIT_INDEX_URL</u>.  Use this to upload packages from a CI service, for instance.

       • Include 'LICENSE' or 'COPYING' files in wheels.

       • Fix for <b>flit</b> <b>install</b> <b>--symlink</b> inside a virtualenv.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.10</b>
       • Downstream packagers can use the <u>FLIT_NO_NETWORK</u> environment variable to  stop  flit  downloading  data
         from the network.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.9</b>
       • <b>flit</b>  <b>install</b>  and <b>flit</b> <b>installfrom</b> now take an optional <b>--python</b> argument, with the path to the Python
         executable you want to install it for.  Using this, you can install modules to Python 2.

       • Installing a module normally (without <b>--symlink</b>) builds a wheel and  uses  pip  to  install  it,  which
         should work better in some corner cases.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.8</b>
       • A new <b>flit</b> <b>installfrom</b> subcommand to install a project from a source archive, such as from Github.

       • <u>Reproducible</u> <u>builds</u> - you can produce byte-for-byte identical wheels.

       • A      warning      for      non-canonical     version     numbers     according     to     <u>PEP</u>     <u>440</u>
         &lt;<b>https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/</b>&gt;.

       • Fix for installing projects on Windows.

       • Better error message when module docstring is only whitespace.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.7</b>
       • A new <b>dev-requires</b> field in the config file for development requirements, used when doing <b>flit</b> <b>install</b>.

       • Added a <b>--deps</b> option for <b>flit</b> <b>install</b> to control which dependencies are installed.

       • Flit can now be invoked with <b>python</b> <b>-m</b> <b>flit</b>.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.6</b>
       • <b>flit</b> <b>install</b> now ensures requirements specified in <b>flit.ini</b> are installed, using pip.

       • If you specify a description file, flit now warns you if it's not valid reStructuredText (since invalid
         reStructuredText is treated as plain text on PyPI).

       • Improved the error message for mis-spelled keys in <b>flit.ini</b>.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.5</b>
       • A new <b>flit</b> <b>init</b> command to quickly define the essential basic metadata for a package.

       • Support for entry points.

       • A new <b>flit</b> <b>register</b> command to register a package without uploading it, for when you want  to  claim  a
         name before you're ready to release.

       • Added a <b>--repository</b> option for specifying an alternative PyPI instance.

       • Added a <b>--debug</b> flag to show debug-level log messages.

       • Better error messages when the module docstring or <b>__version__</b> is missing.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.4</b>
       • Users  can now specify <b>dist-name</b> in the config file if they need to use different names on PyPI and for
         imports.

       • Classifiers are now checked against a locally cached list of valid classifiers.

       • Packages can be locally installed into environments for development.

       • Local installation now creates a PEP 376 <b>.dist-info</b> folder instead of <b>.egg-info</b>.
