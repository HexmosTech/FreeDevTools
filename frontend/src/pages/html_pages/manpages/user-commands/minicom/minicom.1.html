</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       minicom - friendly serial communication program

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>minicom</b> [options] [<u>configuration</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>minicom</b>  is a communication program which somewhat resembles the shareware program TELIX but is free with
       source code and runs under most Unices.  Features include dialing directory with auto-redial, support for
       UUCP-style lock files on serial devices,  a  separate  script  language  interpreter,  capture  to  file,
       multiple users with individual configurations, and more.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND-LINE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-s,</b> <b>--setup</b>
            <b>S</b>etup.  Root edits the system-wide defaults in /etc/minicom/minirc.dfl with this option.  When it is
            used,  minicom  does <u>not</u> initialize, but puts you directly into the configuration menu. This is very
            handy if minicom refuses to start up because your system has changed, or for the first time you  run
            minicom. For most systems, reasonable defaults are already compiled in.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--noinit</b>
            Do not initialize. Minicom will skip the initialization code.  This option is handy if you quit from
            minicom  without  resetting, and then want to restart a session. It is potentially dangerous though:
            no check for lock files etc. is made, so a normal user could  interfere  with  things  like  UUCP...
            maybe  this  will  be  taken  out later. For now it is assumed, that users who are given access to a
            modem are responsible enough for their actions.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--metakey</b>
            Override command-key with the Meta or ALT key. This is the default  in  1.80  and  it  can  also  be
            configured in one of minicom's menus, but if you use different terminals all the time, of which some
            don't  have  a  Meta  or  ALT  key, it's handy to set the default command key to Ctrl-A and use this
            option when you have a keyboard supporting Meta or ALT keys. Minicom  assumes  that  your  Meta  key
            sends the ESC prefix, not the other variant that sets the highest bit of the character.

       <b>-M,</b> <b>--metakey8</b>
            Same  as  -m,  but  assumes  that  your Meta key sets the 8th bit of the character high (sends 128 +
            character code).

       <b>-z,</b> <b>--statline</b>
            Use terminal status line. This only works on terminals that support it and that  have  the  relevant
            information in their <u>termcap</u> or <u>terminfo</u> database entry.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--ansi</b>
            <b>L</b>iteral  translation  of  characters  with  the high bit set. With this flag on, minicom will try to
            translate the IBM line characters to ASCII. Many PC-unix clones  will  display  character  correctly
            without translation (Linux in a special mode, Coherent and SCO).

       <b>-L,</b> <b>--iso</b>
            Ditto but assume screen uses an ISO8859 character set.

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--wrap</b>
            Turns line-wrap on at startup by default.

       <b>-H,</b> <b>--displayhex</b>
            Turn on output in hex mode.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--attrib=on/off</b>
            <b>A</b>ttribute usage. Some terminals, notably Televideo's, have rotten attribute handling (serial instead
            of parallel). By default, minicom uses '-a on', but if you are using such a terminal you can (must!)
            supply the option '-a off'. The trailing 'on' or 'off' is needed.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--term=TERM</b>
            <b>T</b>erminal  type.  With  this flag, you can override the environment TERM variable.  This is handy for
            use in the MINICOM environment variable; one can create a special termcap entry for use with minicom
            on the console, that initializes the screen to raw mode so that in conjunction with the -l flag, the
            IBM line characters are displayed untranslated.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--color=on/off</b>
            <b>C</b>olor usage. Terminals (such as the Linux console) support  color  with  the  standard  ANSI  escape
            sequences.  In  case  there is no such support, color usage can be disabled with '-c off'. This, and
            the '-m' option, are good candidates to put into the MINICOM environment variable.

       <b>-S,</b> <b>--script=SCRIPT</b>
            <b>script</b>.  Run the named script at startup. So far, passing username and password to a startup  script
            is  not  supported. If you also use the -d option to start dialing at startup, the -S script will be
            run BEFORE dialing the entries specified with -d.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--dial=ENTRY</b>
            <b>D</b>ial an entry from the dialing directory on startup. You can specify an index  number,  but  also  a
            substring  of  the  name  of  the  entry.  If  you  specify  a name that has multiple entries in the
            directory, they are all tagged for dialing. You can also specify multiple names or index numbers  by
            separating  them  with commas. The dialing will start from the first entry specified after all other
            program initialization procedures are completed.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--ptty=TTYP</b>
            <b>P</b>seudo terminal to use. This overrides the terminal port defined in  the  configuration  files,  but
            only  if  it  is  a  pseudo  TTY.  The  filename supplied must be of the form (<a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>)tty[p-z/][0-f],
            (<a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>)pts[p-z/][0-f] or (<a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>)pty[p-z/][0-f]. For example, /dev/ttyp1, pts/0 or /dev/ptyp2.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>--capturefile=FILE</b>
            <b>filename</b>.  Open capture file at startup.

       <b>--capturefile-buffer-mode=MODE</b>
            Buffering mode of capture file. MODE can be one of:
               N  Unbuffered (the default).
               L  Line buffered.
               F  Fully buffered.

       <b>-F,</b> <b>--statlinefmt</b>
            Format for the status line. The following format specifier are available:
               %H  Escape key for help screen.
               %V  Version string of minicom.
               %b  Information on connection, such as baud rate.
               %T  Terminal type.
               %C  Cursor mode.
               %D  Device path, possibly shorted to remaining available space.
               %t  Online time.
               %%  % character.

            Example: "%H for help | %b | Minicom %V | %T | %C | %t"

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--baudrate</b>
            Specify the baud rate, overriding the value given in the configuration file.

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--device</b>
            Specify the device, overriding the value given in the configuration file.

       <b>-O,</b> <b>--option</b>
            Set an option. The argument can be a single word, or a key=value pair.  Recognized options:

            <b>timestamp</b> with values simple, delta, persecond, and extended. If no  value  is  given,  'simple'  is
            selected.

       <b>-R,</b> <b>--remotecharset</b>
            Specify  the  character set of the remote system is using and convert it to the character set of the
            local side. Example might be 'latin1'.

       <b>-7,</b> <b>--7bit</b>
            7bit mode for terminals which aren't 8bit capable. 8bit is default if the environment is  configured
            for this via LANG or LC_ALL, 7bit otherwise.

       <b>-8,</b> <b>--8bit</b>
            8bit  characters  pass  through  without  any  modification.  'Continuous' means no locate/attribute
            control sequences are inserted without real change of locate/attribute. This mode is to display 8bit
            multi-byte characters such as Japanese. Not needed in every  language  with  8bit  characters.  (For
            example displaying Finnish text doesn't need this.)

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
            Display help and exit.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
            Print the minicom version.

            When  <b>minicom</b> starts, it first searches the MINICOM environment variable for command-line arguments,
            which can be over-ridden on the command line.  Thus, if you have done

                 MINICOM='-m -c on'
                 export MINICOM
            or the equivalent, and start minicom, minicom will assume that your terminal <u>has</u> a Meta or &lt;ALT&gt; key
            and that color is supported.  If you then log in from a terminal without color support, and you have
            set MINICOM in your startup (.profile or equivalent) file, and don't want to re-set your environment
            variable, you can type 'minicom -c off' and run without color support for that session.

       <b>configuration</b>
            The <u>configuration</u> argument is more interesting. Normally, minicom gets  its  defaults  from  a  file
            called  "minirc.dfl".  If  you  however give an argument to minicom, it will try to get its defaults
            from a file called "minirc.<u>configuration</u>".  So it  is  possible  to  create  multiple  configuration
            files, for different ports, different users etc. Most sensible is to use device names, such as tty1,
            tty64,  sio2  etc.  If  a  user  creates their own configuration file, it will show up in their home
            directory as ".minirc.dfl" or ".minirc.<u>configuration</u>".

</pre><h4><b>USE</b></h4><pre>
       Minicom is window based. To pop-up a window with the function you want, press Control-A (from now on,  we
       will  use  C-A to mean Control-A), and then the function key (a-z or A-Z). By pressing C-A first and then
       'z', a help screen comes up with a short summary of all commands. This escape key  can  be  altered  when
       minicom is configured (-s option or C-A O), but we'll stick to Control-A for now.

       For every menu the next keys can be used:
       <b>UP</b>     arrow-up or 'k'
       <b>DOWN</b>   arrow-down or 'j'
       <b>LEFT</b>   arrow-left or 'h'
       <b>RIGHT</b>  arrow-right or 'l'
       <b>CHOOSE</b> Enter
       <b>CANCEL</b> ESCape.

       The  screen  is  divided  into two portions: the upper 24 lines are the terminal-emulator screen. In this
       window, ANSI or VT100 escape sequences are interpreted.  If there is a line left at the bottom, a  status
       line  is  placed there.  If this is not possible the status line will be showed every time you press C-A.
       On terminals that have a special status line that will be used if the termcap information is complete <u>and</u>
       the <b>-k</b> flag has been given.

       Possible commands are listed next, in alphabetical order.
       <b>C-A</b>  Pressing C-A a second time will just send a C-A to the remote system.   If  you  have  changed  your
            "escape character" to something other than C-A, this works analogously for that character.
       <b>A</b>    Toggle  'Add  Linefeed'  on/off.  If  it  is  on,  a  linefeed is added before every carriage return
            displayed on the screen.
       <b>B</b>    Gives you a scroll back buffer. You can scroll up with <b>u</b>, down with <b>d</b>, a page up with <b>b</b>, a page down
            with <b>f</b>, and if you have them the <b>arrow</b> and <b>page</b> <b>up/page</b> <b>down</b> keys can also be used. You  can  search
            for  text  in  the  buffer  with  <b>s</b>  (case-sensitive)  or <b>S</b> (case-insensitive). <b>N</b> will find the next
            occurrence of the string.  <b>c</b> will enter citation mode. A text cursor appears  and  you  specify  the
            start  line by hitting Enter key. Then scroll back mode will finish and the contents with prefix '&gt;'
            will be sent.
       <b>C</b>    Clears the screen.
       <b>D</b>    Dial a number, or go to the dialing directory.
       <b>E</b>    Toggle local echo on and off (if your version of minicom supports it).
       <b>F</b>    A break signal is sent to the modem.
       <b>G</b>    Run script (Go). Runs a login script.
       <b>H</b>    Hangup.
       <b>I</b>    Toggle the type of escape sequence that the cursor keys send between normal and  applications  mode.
            (See also the comment about the status line below).
       <b>J</b>    Jump to a shell. On return, the whole screen will be redrawn.
       <b>K</b>    Clears the screen, runs kermit and redraws the screen upon return.
       <b>L</b>    Turn  Capture  file on off. If turned on, all output sent to the screen will be captured in the file
            too.
       <b>M</b>    Sends the modem initialization string. If you are online and the DCD line setting  is  on,  you  are
            asked for confirmation before the modem is initialized.
       <b>N</b>    Toggle  between  timestamp  modes to be added to the output.  Available are simple and extended time
            formats for each line, a delta to the previous line, a time display each second  and  no  timestamps
            (the default).
       <b>O</b>    Configure minicom. Puts you in the configuration menu.
       <b>P</b>    Communication Parameters. Allows you to change the bps rate, parity and number of bits.
       <b>Q</b>    Exit  minicom  without  resetting  the  modem. If macros changed and were not saved, you will have a
            chance to do so.
       <b>R</b>    Receive files. Choose from various protocols (external). If you have the filename  selection  window
            and  the  prompt  for  download  directory  enabled,  you'll get a selection window for choosing the
            directory for downloading. Otherwise the download directory defined in the Filenames and paths  menu
            will be used.
       <b>S</b>    Send files. Choose the protocol like you do with the receive command. If you don't have the filename
            selection  window  enabled  (in  the  File  transfer  protocols menu), you'll just have to write the
            filename(s) in a dialog window. If you have the selection window  enabled,  a  window  will  pop  up
            showing  the  filenames  in  your  upload  directory.  You  can  tag and untag filenames by pressing
            spacebar, and move the cursor up and down with the cursor keys or j/k. The  selected  filenames  are
            shown  highlighted.  Directory  names are shown [within brackets] and you can move up or down in the
            directory tree by pressing the spacebar twice. Finally, send the files by pressing ENTER or quit  by
            pressing ESC.
       <b>T</b>    Choose  Terminal  emulation: Ansi(color) or vt100.  You can also change the backspace key here, turn
            the status line on or off, and define delay (in milliseconds) after each newline if you need that.
       <b>U</b>    Add carriage return to each received line.
       <b>W</b>    Toggle line-wrap on/off.
       <b>X</b>    Exit minicom, reset modem. If macros changed and were not saved, you will have a chance to do so.
       <b>Y</b>    Paste a file. Reads a file and sends its contests just as if it would be typed in.
       <b>Z</b>    Pop up the help screen.

</pre><h4><b>DIALING</b> <b>DIRECTORY</b></h4><pre>
       By pressing C-A D the program puts you in the  dialing  directory.  Select  a  command  by  pressing  the
       capitalized  letter  or  moving cursor right/left with the arrow keys or the h/l keys and pressing Enter.
       You can add, delete or edit entries and move them up and down in the directory list. By  choosing  "dial"
       the  phone  numbers  of  the tagged entries, or if nothing is tagged, the number of the highlighted entry
       will be dialed. While the modem is dialing, you can press escape to cancel dialing. Any  other  key  will
       close the dial window, but won't cancel the dialing itself. Your dialing directory will be saved into the
       file ".dialdir" in your home directory.  You can scroll up and down with the arrow keys, but you can also
       scroll  complete  pages  by  pressing the PageUp or PageDown key.  If you don't have those, use Control-B
       (Backward) and Control-F (Forward). You can use the space bar to <b>tag</b> a number of entries and minicom will
       rotate trough this list if a connection can't be made. A '&gt;' symbol is drawn in the directory before  the
       names of the tagged entries.

       The "edit" menu speaks for itself, but I will discuss it briefly here.
       <b>A</b> <b>-</b> <b>Name</b>  The name for this entry
       <b>B</b> <b>-</b> <b>Number</b>
                 and its telephone number.
       <b>C</b> <b>-</b> <b>Dial</b> <b>string</b> <b>#</b>
                 Which  specific  dial string you want to use to connect. There are three different dial strings
                 (prefixes and suffixes) that can be configured in the <b>Modem</b> <b>and</b> <b>dialing</b> menu.
       <b>D</b> <b>-</b> <b>Local</b> <b>echo</b>
                 can be on or off for this system (if your version of minicom supports it).
       <b>E</b> <b>-</b> <b>Script</b>
                 The script that must be executed after a successful connection is  made  (see  the  manual  for
                 runscript)
       <b>F</b> <b>-</b> <b>Username</b>
                 The  username  that is passed to the runscript program.  It is passed in the environment string
                 "$LOGIN".
       <b>G</b> <b>-</b> <b>Password</b>
                 The password is passed as "$PASS".
       <b>H</b> <b>-</b> <b>Terminal</b> <b>Emulation</b>
                 Use ANSI or VT100 emulation.
       <b>I</b> <b>-</b> <b>Backspace</b> <b>key</b> <b>sends</b>
                 What code (Backspace or Delete) the backspace key sends.
       <b>J</b> <b>-</b> <b>Linewrap</b>
                 Can be on or off.
       <b>K</b> <b>-</b> <b>Line</b> <b>settings</b>
                 Bps rate, bits, parity and number of stop bits to use for  this  connection.   You  can  choose
                 <b>current</b>  for the speed, so that it will use whatever speed is being used at that moment (useful
                 if you have multiple modems).
       <b>L</b> <b>-</b> <b>Conversion</b> <b>table</b>
                 You may specify a character conversion table to be loaded whenever this entry  answers,  before
                 running the login script. If this field is blank, the conversion table stays unchanged.
       The  edit  menu  also  shows  the latest date and time when you called this entry and the total number of
       calls there, but doesn't let you change them.  They are updated automatically when you connect.

       The moVe command lets you move the highlighted entry up or down in the dialing directory with the up/down
       arrow keys or the k and j keys. Press Enter or ESC to end moving the entry.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       By pressing C-A O you will be thrown into the setup menu.

       <b>Filenames</b> <b>and</b> <b>paths</b>
         This menu defines your default directories.
         <b>A</b> <b>-</b> <b>Download</b> <b>directory</b>
              where the downloaded files go to.
         <b>B</b> <b>-</b> <b>Upload</b> <b>directory</b>
              where the uploaded files are read from.
         <b>C</b> <b>-</b> <b>Script</b> <b>directory</b>
              Where you keep your login scripts.
         <b>D</b> <b>-</b> <b>Script</b> <b>program</b>
              Which program to use as the script interpreter. Defaults to the program "runscript",  but  if  you
              want  to  use  something  else  (eg,  <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>  or  "expect") it is possible.  Stdin and stdout are
              connected to the modem, stderr to the screen.
              If the path is relative (ie, does not start  with  a  slash)  then  it's  relative  to  your  home
              directory, except for the script interpreter.
         <b>E</b> <b>-</b> <b>Kermit</b> <b>program</b>
              Where  to find the executable for kermit, and it's options. Some simple macro's can be used on the
              command line: '%l' is expanded to the complete filename of the dial out-device, '%f'  is  expanded
              to the serial port file descriptor and '%b' is expanded to the current serial port speed.
         <b>F</b> <b>-</b> <b>Logging</b> <b>options</b>
              Options to configure the logfile writing.

              <b>A</b> <b>-</b> <b>File</b> <b>name</b>
                   Here  you can enter the name of the logfile. The file will be written in your home directory,
                   and the default value is "minicom.log".  If you blank the name, all logging is turned off.

              <b>B</b> <b>-</b> <b>Log</b> <b>connects</b> <b>and</b> <b>hangups</b>
                   This option defines whether or not the logfile is written when the  remote  end  answers  the
                   call  or  hangs  up.  Or  when  you give the hangup command yourself or leave minicom without
                   hangup while online.

              <b>C</b> <b>-</b> <b>Log</b> <b>file</b> <b>transfers</b>
                   Do you want log entries of receiving and sending files.
         The 'log' command in the scripts is not affected by logging options B and C.  It is always executed, if
         you just have the name of the log file defined.

       <b>File</b> <b>Transfer</b> <b>Protocols</b>
         Protocols defined here will show up when C-A s/r is pressed.  "Name" in the beginning of  the  line  is
         the  name  that  will  show  up  in  the menu. "Program" is the path to the protocol. "Name" after that
         defines if the program needs an argument, e.g. a file to be transmitted.  U/D  defines  if  this  entry
         should  show  up  in  the  upload or the download menu.  Fullscr defines if the program should run full
         screen, or that minicom will only show it's stderr in a window. IO-Red defines if minicom should attach
         the program's standard in and output to the modem port or not. "Multi"  tells  the  filename  selection
         window  whether  or  not  the  protocol  can  send multiple files with one command. It has no effect on
         download protocols, and it is also ignored  with  upload  protocols  if  you  don't  use  the  filename
         selection window. The old sz and rz are not full screen, and have IO-Red set. However, there are curses
         based  versions of at least rz that do not want their stdin and stdout redirected, and run full screen.
         All file transfer protocols are run with the UID of the user, and not with  UID=root.  '%l',  '%f'  and
         '%b'  can be used on the command line as with kermit.  Within this menu you can also define if you want
         to use the filename selection window when prompted for files to upload, and if you like to be  prompted
         for  the  download  directory  every  time the automatic download is started. If you leave the download
         directory prompt disabled, the download directory defined in the file and directory menu is used.

       <b>Serial</b> <b>port</b> <b>setup</b>
         <b>A</b> <b>-</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>device</b>
              /dev/tty1 or /dev/ttyS1 for most people.  /dev/cua&lt;n&gt; is still possible under  GNU/Linux,  but  no
              longer recommended as these devices are obsolete and many systems with kernel 2.2.x or newer don't
              have  them.   Use  /dev/ttyS&lt;n&gt;  instead.   You  may also have /dev/modem as a symlink to the real
              device.
              If you have modems connected to two or more serial ports, you may specify all of them  here  in  a
              list  separated  by  space,  comma  or semicolon. When Minicom starts, it checks the list until it
              finds an available modem and uses that one. (However, you can't specify different init strings  to
              them... at least not yet.)
              To  use a UNIX socket for communication the device name must be prefixed with "unix#" following by
              the full path and the filename of the socket.  Minicom will then try to connect to this socket  as
              a client. As long as it cannot connect to the socket it stays 'offline'. As soon as the connection
              establishes, minicom goes 'online'. If the server closes the socket, minicom switches to 'offline'
              again.
         <b>B</b> <b>-</b> <b>Lock</b> <b>file</b> <b>location</b>
              On most systems This should be /usr/spool/uucp. GNU/Linux systems use /var/lock. If this directory
              does not exist, minicom will not attempt to use lockfiles.
         <b>C</b> <b>-</b> <b>Callin</b> <b>program</b>
              If  you have a uugetty or something on your serial port, it could be that you want a program to be
              run to switch the modem cq. port into dialin/dialout mode. This is the program to get into  dialin
              mode.
         <b>D</b> <b>-</b> <b>Callout</b> <b>program</b>
              And this to get into dialout mode.
         <b>E</b> <b>-</b> <b>Bps/Par/Bits</b>
              Default parameters at startup.

         If one of the entries is left blank, it will not be used. So if you don't care about locking, and don't
         have a getty running on your modemline, entries B - D should be left blank.

       <b>Modem</b> <b>and</b> <b>Dialing</b>
         Here,  the  parameters for your modem are defined. I will not explain this further because the defaults
         are for generic Hayes modems, and should work always. This file is not a Hayes tutorial  :-)  The  only
         things  worth  noticing  are that control characters can be sent by prefixing them with a '^', in which
         '^^' means '^' itself, and the '\' character must also be doubled as '\\', because  backslash  is  used
         specially  in  the  macro  definitions.  Some options however, don't have much to do with the modem but
         more with the behaviour of minicom itself:
         <b>M</b> <b>-</b> <b>Dial</b> <b>time</b>
              The number of seconds before minicom times out if no connection is established.
         <b>N</b> <b>-</b> <b>Delay</b> <b>before</b> <b>redial</b>
              Minicom will redial if no connection was made, but it first waits some time.
         <b>O</b> <b>-</b> <b>Number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tries</b>
              Maximum number of times that minicom attempts to dial.
         <b>P</b> <b>-</b> <b>Drop</b> <b>DTR</b> <b>time</b>
              If you set this to 0, minicom hangs up by sending a Hayes-type hangup sequence. If you  specify  a
              non-zero  value,  the hangup will be done by dropping the DTR line. The value tells in seconds how
              long DTR will be kept down.
         <b>Q</b> <b>-</b> <b>Auto</b> <b>bps</b> <b>detect</b>
              If this is on, minicom tries to match the dialed party's speed.  With most modern modems  this  is
              NOT desirable, since the modem buffers the data and converts the speed.
         <b>R</b> <b>-</b> <b>Modem</b> <b>has</b> <b>DCD</b> <b>line</b>
              If your modem, and your O/S both support the DCD line (that goes 'high' when a connection is made)
              minicom  will  use it. When you have this option on, minicom will also NOT start dialing while you
              are already online.
         <b>S</b> <b>-</b> <b>Status</b> <b>line</b> <b>shows</b> <b>DTE</b> <b>speed</b> <b>/</b> <b>line</b> <b>speed</b>
              You can toggle the status line to show either the DTE speed  (the  speed  which  minicom  uses  to
              communicate  with  your  modem)  or  the line speed (the speed that your modem uses on the line to
              communicate with the other modem). Notice that the line speed may change  during  the  connection,
              but you will still only see the initial speed that the modems started the connection with. This is
              because  the  modem doesn't tell the program if the speed is changed. Also, to see the line speed,
              you need to have the modem set to show it in the connect string.  Otherwise you will only see 0 as
              the line speed.
         <b>T</b> <b>-</b> <b>Multi-line</b> <b>untag</b>
              You can toggle the feature to untag entries from  the  dialing  directory  when  a  connection  is
              established to a multi-line BBS. All the tagged entries that have the same name are untagged.

            <b>Note</b>  <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>special</b> <b>exception</b> <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>menu:</b> <b>every</b> <b>user</b> <b>can</b> <b>change</b> <b>all</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>here,</b> <b>but</b>
            <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>saved.</b>

       <b>Screen</b> <b>and</b> <b>keyboard</b>
         <b>A</b> <b>-</b> <b>Command</b> <b>key</b> <b>is</b>
              the 'Hot Key' that brings you into command mode. If this is set to 'ALT' or 'meta  key',  you  can
              directly call commands by alt-key instead of HotKey-key.
         <b>B</b> <b>-</b> <b>Backspace</b> <b>key</b> <b>sends</b>
              There still are some systems that want a VT100 to send DEL instead of BS. With this option you can
              enable that stupidity.  (Eh, it's even on by default...)
         <b>C</b> <b>-</b> <b>Status</b> <b>line</b> <b>is</b>
              Enabled  or disabled. Some slow terminals (for example, X-terminals) cause the status line to jump
              "up and down" when scrolling, so you can turn it off  if  desired.  It  will  still  be  shown  in
              command-mode.
         <b>D</b> <b>-</b> <b>Alarm</b> <b>sound</b>
              If  turned on, minicom will sound an alarm (on the console only) after a successful connection and
              when up/downloading is complete.
         <b>E</b> <b>-</b> <b>Foreground</b> <b>Color</b> <b>(menu)</b>
              indicates the foreground color to use for all the configuration windows in minicom.
         <b>F</b> <b>-</b> <b>Background</b> <b>Color</b> <b>(menu)</b>
              indicates the background color to use for all the configuration  windows  in  minicom.  Note  that
              minicom will not allow you to set foreground and background colors to the same value.
         <b>G</b> <b>-</b> <b>Foreground</b> <b>Color</b> <b>(term)</b>
              indicates the foreground color to use in the terminal window.
         <b>H</b> <b>-</b> <b>Background</b> <b>Color</b> <b>(term)</b>
              indicates the background color to use in the terminal window. Note that minicom will not allow you
              to set foreground and background colors to the same value.
         <b>I</b> <b>-</b> <b>Foreground</b> <b>Color</b> <b>(stat)</b>
              indicates the foreground color to use in for the status bar.
         <b>J</b> <b>-</b> <b>Background</b> <b>Color</b> <b>(stat)</b>
              indicates  the  color  to  use  in for the status bar. Note that minicom will allow you to set the
              status bar's foreground and background colors to the same value. This will  effectively  make  the
              status bar invisible but if these are your intentions, please see the option
         <b>K</b> <b>-</b> <b>History</b> <b>buffer</b> <b>size</b>
              The number of lines to keep in the history buffer (for backscrolling).
         <b>L</b> <b>-</b> <b>Macros</b> <b>file</b>
              is  the  full  path  to the file that holds macros. Macros allow you to define a string to be sent
              when you press a certain key. In minicom, you may  define  F1  through  F12  to  send  up  to  256
              characters  [this is set at compile time]. The filename you specify is verified as soon as you hit
              ENTER. If you do not have permissions to create the specified  file,  an  error  message  will  so
              indicate  and you will be forced to re-edit the filename. If you are permitted to create the file,
              minicom checks to see if it already exists. If so, it assumes it's a macro file and reads  it  in.
              If it isn't, well, it's your problem :-) If the file does not exist, the filename is accepted.
         <b>M</b> <b>-</b> <b>Edit</b> <b>Macros</b>
              opens up a new window which allows you to edit the F1 through F12 macros.
         <b>N</b> <b>-</b> <b>Macros</b> <b>enabled</b>
              -  Yes  or No. If macros are disabled, the F1-F12 keys will just send the VT100/VT220 function key
              escape sequences.
         <b>O</b> <b>-</b> <b>Character</b> <b>conversion</b>
              The active conversion table filename is shown here. If you can  see  no  name,  no  conversion  is
              active. Pressing O, you will see the conversion table edit menu.

              <b>Edit</b> <b>Macros</b>
                 Here,  the  macros  for  F1 through F12 are defined. The bottom of the window shows a legend of
                 character combinations that have special meaning.  They allow  you  to  enter  special  control
                 characters  with  plain  text by prefixing them with a '^', in which '^^' means '^' itself. You
                 can send a 1 second delay with the '^~' code. This is useful when you are trying to login after
                 ftp'ing or telnet'ing somewhere.  You can also include your current username and password  from
                 the  phone  directory in the macros with '\u' and '\p', respectively. If you need the backslash
                 character in the macro, write it doubled as '\\'.  To edit a macro, press the shown  number  or
                 letter  and  you  will be moved to the end of the macro. When editing the line, you may use the
                 left &amp; right arrows, Home &amp; End keys, Delete &amp; BackSpace, and ESC and RETURN.  ESC cancels  any
                 changes made while ENTER accepts the changes.

              <b>Character</b> <b>conversion</b>
                 Here  you can edit the character conversion table. If you are not an American, you know that in
                 many languages there are characters that are not included in the ASCII character  set,  and  in
                 the  old  times they may have replaced some less important characters in ASCII and now they are
                 often represented with character codes above 127. AND  there  are  various  different  ways  to
                 represent  them.  This is where you may edit conversion tables for systems that use a character
                 set different from the one on your computer.

              <b>A</b> <b>-</b> <b>Load</b> <b>table</b>
                   You probably guessed it. This command loads a table from the disk.  You are asked a file name
                   for the table.  Predefined tables .mciso, .mcpc8 and  .mcsf7  should  be  included  with  the
                   program.  Table  .mciso does no conversion, .mcpc8 is to be used for connections with systems
                   that use the 8-bit pc character set, and .mcsf7 is for compatibility with  the  systems  that
                   uses  the  good  old  7-bit  coding  to  replace  the  characters {|}[]\ with the diacritical
                   characters used in Finnish and Swedish.

              <b>B</b> <b>-</b> <b>Save</b> <b>table</b>
                   This one saves the active table on the filename you specify.

              <b>C</b> <b>-</b> <b>edit</b> <b>char</b>
                   This is where you can make your own modifications to the existing table.  First you are asked
                   the character value (in decimal) whose conversion you want to change. Next you'll  say  which
                   character  you  want  to see on your screen when that character comes from the outside world.
                   And then you'll be asked what you want to be sent out when you enter that character from your
                   keyboard.

              <b>D</b> <b>-</b> <b>next</b> <b>screen</b>

              <b>E</b> <b>-</b> <b>prev</b> <b>screen</b>
                   Yeah, you probably noticed that this screen shows you what kind of  conversions  are  active.
                   The  screen  just  is  (usually)  too  small  to  show the whole table at once in an easy-to-
                   understand format. This is how you can scroll the table left and right.

              <b>F</b> <b>-</b> <b>convert</b> <b>capture</b>
                   Toggles whether or not the character conversion table is used when writing the capture file.

       <b>Save</b> <b>setup</b> <b>as</b> <b>dfl</b>
         Save the parameters as the default for the next time the program is started. Instead of dfl, any  other
         parameter name may appear, depending on which one was used when the program was started.

       <b>Save</b> <b>setup</b> <b>as..</b>
         Save the parameters under a special name. Whenever Minicom is started with this name as an argument, it
         will use these parameters. This option is of course privileged to root.

       <b>Exit</b>
         Escape from this menu without saving.  This can also be done with ESC.

       <b>Exit</b> <b>from</b> <b>minicom</b>
         Only  root  will  see  this menu entry, if he/she started minicom with the '-s' option. This way, it is
         possible to change the configuration without actually running minicom.

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b> <b>LINE</b></h4><pre>
       The status line has several indicators, that speak for themselves.  The mysterious APP or  NOR  indicator
       probably needs explanation. The VT100 cursor keys can be in two modes: applications mode and cursor mode.
       This  is  controlled by an escape sequence. If you find that the cursor keys do not work in, say, vi when
       you're logged in using minicom then you can see with this  indicator  whether  the  cursor  keys  are  in
       applications  or  cursor  mode.  You can toggle the two with the C-A I key. If the cursor keys then work,
       it's probably an error in the remote system's termcap initialization strings (is).

</pre><h4><b>LOCALES</b></h4><pre>
       Minicom has support for local languages. This means you can change most of the English messages and other
       strings to another language by setting the environment variable LANG.

</pre><h4><b>MISC</b></h4><pre>
       If minicom is hung, kill it with SIGTERM . (This means kill -15, or since sigterm is default, just  plain
       "kill  &lt;minicompid&gt;".  This  will cause a graceful exit of minicom, doing resets and everything.  You may
       kill minicom from a script with the command "! killall -9 minicom" without hanging up the  line.  Without
       the -9 parameter, minicom first hangs up before exiting.

       Since a lot of escape sequences begin with ESC (Arrow up is ESC [ A), Minicom does not know if the escape
       character it gets is you pressing the escape key, or part of a sequence.

       An  old  version  of  Minicom, V1.2, solved this in a rather crude way: to get the escape key, you had to
       press it <u>twice</u>.

       As of release 1.3 this has bettered a little: now a 1-second timeout is builtin, like in vi. For  systems
       that have the select() system call the timeout is 0.5 seconds. And... surprise: a special Linux-dependent
       <b>hack</b>  :-) was added. Now, minicom can separate the escape key and escape-sequences. To see how dirty this
       was done, look into wkeys.c.  But it works like a charm!

</pre><h4><b>DEBIAN</b> <b>SPECIFIC</b></h4><pre>
       In Debian GNU/Linux systems, minicom is not setuid root. Users that need to use it have to get  added  to
       the <u>dialout</u> group in order to use serial port devices.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Minicom  keeps  it's  configuration  files in the directory /etc/minicom.  You'll find the demo files for
       <b><a href="../man1/runscript.1.html">runscript</a></b>(1), and the examples of character conversion tables in /usr/share/doc/minicom.  The  conversion
       tables  are  named something like mc.* in the tables subdirectory, but you probably want to copy the ones
       you need in your home directory as something beginning with a dot.

       minirc.*
