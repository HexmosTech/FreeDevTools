</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mpiexec.slurm - Run an MPI program under Slurm

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       mpiexec.slurm args executable pgmargs

       where args are command line arguments for mpiexec (see below), executable is the name of the executable
       and pgmargs are command line arguments for the executable. For example the following command will run the
       MPI program a.out on 4 processes:

               mpiexec.slurm -n 4 a.out

       mpiexec.slurm supports the following options:

                [-n nprocs]
                [-host hostname]
                [-verbose]
                [-nostdin]
                [-allstdin]
                [-nostdout]
                [-pernode]
                [-config config_file]
                [-help|-?]
                [-man]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>mpiexec.slurm</b>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-n</b> <b>&lt;np</b>&gt;
           Specify the number of processes to use

       <b>-host</b> <b>hostname</b>
           Name of host on which to run processes

       <b>-verbose</b>
           Increase  the  verbosity  of  mpiexec.slurm informational messages. Multiple -verbose's  will further
           increase mpiexec.slurm's verbosity. By default only errors will be displayed.

       <b>-nostdin</b>
           Do not connect the standard input stream of process  0  to  the  mpiexec  process.   If  the  process
           attempts to read from stdin, it will see an end-of-file.

       <b>-allstdin</b>
           Send the standard input stream of mpiexec.slurm to all processes. Each character typed to mpiexec (or
           read  from  a file) is duplicated numproc times, and sent to each process. This permits every process
           to read, for example, configuration information from the input stream.

       <b>-nostdout</b>
           Do not connect the standard output and error streams  of  each  process  back  to  the  mpiexec.slurm
           process.  Standard  output  and error will be respectively writte in files of the form job.ojobid and
           job.ejobid for batch jobs, and directly to the controlling terminal for interactive jobs.

       <b>-pernode</b>
           Allocate only one process per compute node. For SMP nodes, only one processor  will  be  allocated  a
           job.  This  flag  is used to implement multiple level parallelism with MPI between nodes, and threads
           within a node, assmuming the code is set up to do that.

       <b>-config</b> <b>&lt;config_file</b>&gt;
           Process executable and arguments are specified in the given configuration file.   This  flag  permits
           the  use of heterogeneous jobs using multiple executables. No executable is given on the command line
           when using the -config flag. If config_file is "-", then the  configuration  is  read  from  standard
           input. In this case the flag -nostdin is mandatory, as it is not possible to separate the contents of
           the configuration file from process input. The config_file can contain lines beginning with "#", that
           are considered comments and ignored and and one or more lines with the following format:

                   -n XX : executable [args]

           where XX is the number of processes to be used, executable is the name of the program to run and args
           are its arguments. For example:

                   # Sample mpiexec config file
                   # Launch two instance of foo
                   -n 2 : foo
                   # and three instances of bar
                   -n 3 bar

           There is no support for hostname task layout in a config file at the moment.
