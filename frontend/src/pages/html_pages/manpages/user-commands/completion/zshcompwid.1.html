</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       zshcompwid - zsh completion widgets

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The shell's programmable completion mechanism can be manipulated in two ways; here the low-level features
       supporting  the  newer, function-based mechanism are defined.  A complete set of shell functions based on
       these features is described in <u><a href="../man1/zshcompsys.1.html">zshcompsys</a></u>(1), and users with no interest in adding to  that  system  (or,
       potentially,  writing  their  own  -- see dictionary entry for `hubris') should skip the current section.
       The older system based on the <b>compctl</b> builtin command is described in <u><a href="../man1/zshcompctl.1.html">zshcompctl</a></u>(1).

       Completion widgets are defined by the <b>-C</b> option to the <b>zle</b> builtin command provided by the <b>zsh/zle</b> module
       (see <u><a href="../man1/zshzle.1.html">zshzle</a></u>(1)). For example,

              <b>zle</b> <b>-C</b> <b>complete</b> <b>expand-or-complete</b> <b>completer</b>

       defines a widget named `<b>complete</b>'.  The second argument is the name of any of the  builtin  widgets  that
       handle   completions:   <b>complete-word</b>,   <b>expand-or-complete</b>,   <b>expand-or-complete-prefix</b>,  <b>menu-complete</b>,
       <b>menu-expand-or-complete</b>, <b>reverse-menu-complete</b>, <b>list-choices</b>, or  <b>delete-char-or-list</b>.   Note  that  this
       will still work even if the widget in question has been re-bound.

       When this newly defined widget is bound to a key using the <b>bindkey</b> builtin command defined in the <b>zsh/zle</b>
       module  (see  <u><a href="../man1/zshzle.1.html">zshzle</a></u>(1)),  typing  that  key  will  call the shell function `<b>completer</b>'. This function is
       responsible for generating completion matches using the builtins described  below.   As  with  other  ZLE
       widgets, the function is called with its standard input closed.

       Once  the  function  returns,  the completion code takes over control again and treats the matches in the
       same manner as the specified builtin widget, in this case <b>expand-or-complete</b>.

</pre><h4><b>COMPLETION</b> <b>SPECIAL</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       The parameters <b>ZLE_REMOVE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b> and <b>ZLE_SPACE_SUFFIX_CHARS</b> are used by the  completion  mechanism,
       but are not special. See <u>Parameters</u> <u>Used</u> <u>By</u> <u>The</u> <u>Shell</u> in <u><a href="../man1/zshparam.1.html">zshparam</a></u>(1).

       Inside  completion  widgets,  and  any  functions called from them, some parameters have special meaning;
       outside these functions they are not special to the shell in any way.  These parameters are used to  pass
       information  between  the completion code and the completion widget. Some of the builtin commands and the
       condition codes use or change the current values of these parameters.  Any existing values will be hidden
       during execution of completion widgets; except for <b>compstate</b>, the parameters are reset on  each  function
       exit  (including nested function calls from within the completion widget) to the values they had when the
       function was entered.

       <b>CURRENT</b>
              This is the number of the current word, i.e. the word the cursor is  currently  on  in  the  <b>words</b>
              array.  Note that this value is only correct if the <b>ksharrays</b> option is not set.

       <b>IPREFIX</b>
              Initially this will be set to the empty string.  This parameter functions like <b>PREFIX</b>; it contains
              a  string  which  precedes  the  one  in <b>PREFIX</b> and is not considered part of the list of matches.
              Typically, a string is transferred from the beginning  of  <b>PREFIX</b>  to  the  end  of  <b>IPREFIX</b>,  for
              example:

                     <b>IPREFIX=${PREFIX%%\=*}=</b>
                     <b>PREFIX=${PREFIX#*=}</b>

              causes  the  part of the prefix up to and including the first equal sign not to be treated as part
              of a matched string.  This can be done automatically by the <b>compset</b> builtin, see below.

       <b>ISUFFIX</b>
              As <b>IPREFIX</b>, but for a suffix that should not be considered part of  the  matches;  note  that  the
              <b>ISUFFIX</b> string follows the <b>SUFFIX</b> string.

       <b>PREFIX</b> Initially  this  will  be set to the part of the current word from the beginning of the word up to
              the position of the cursor; it may be altered to give a common prefix for all matches.

       <b>QIPREFIX</b>
              This parameter is read-only and contains the quoted string up to the word  being  completed.  E.g.
              when  completing  `<b>"foo</b>', this parameter contains the double quote. If the <b>-q</b> option of <b>compset</b> is
              used (see below), and the original string was `<b>"foo</b> <b>bar</b>'  with  the  cursor  on  the  `<b>bar</b>',  this
              parameter contains `<b>"foo</b> '.

       <b>QISUFFIX</b>
              Like <b>QIPREFIX</b>, but containing the suffix.

       <b>SUFFIX</b> Initially this will be set to the part of the current word from the cursor position to the end; it
              may  be  altered  to  give  a  common  suffix  for all matches.  It is most useful when the option
              <b>COMPLETE_IN_WORD</b> is set, as otherwise the whole word on the command line is treated as a prefix.

       <b>compstate</b>
              This is an associative array with various keys  and  values  that  the  completion  code  uses  to
              exchange information with the completion widget.  The keys are:

              <b>all_quotes</b>
                     The  <b>-q</b>  option  of  the  <b>compset</b>  builtin command (see below) allows a quoted string to be
                     broken into separate words; if the cursor is on one of  those  words,  that  word  will  be
                     completed,  possibly  invoking  `<b>compset</b>  <b>-q</b>' recursively.  With this key it is possible to
                     test the types of quoted strings which are currently broken into  parts  in  this  fashion.
                     Its value contains one character for each quoting level.  The characters are a single quote
                     or  a  double  quote  for  strings quoted with these characters, a dollars sign for strings
                     quoted with <b>$'</b><u>...</u><b>'</b> and a backslash for strings not starting with a  quote  character.   The
                     first character in the value always corresponds to the innermost quoting level.

              <b>context</b>
                     This  will  be  set  by  the  completion code to the overall context in which completion is
                     attempted. Possible values are:

                     <b>array_value</b>
                            when completing inside the value of an array parameter assignment; in this case  the
                            <b>words</b> array contains the words inside the parentheses.

                     <b>brace_parameter</b>
                            when  completing the name of a parameter in a parameter expansion beginning with <b>${</b>.
                            This context will also be set when completing parameter  flags  following  <b>${(</b>;  the
                            full  command  line  argument is presented and the handler must test the value to be
                            completed to ascertain that this is the case.

                     <b>assign_parameter</b>
                            when completing the name of a parameter in a parameter assignment.

                     <b>command</b>
                            when completing for a normal command (either in command position or for an  argument
                            of the command).

                     <b>condition</b>
                            when  completing  inside  a `<b>[[</b>...<b>]]</b>' conditional expression; in this case the <b>words</b>
                            array contains only the words inside the conditional expression.

                     <b>math</b>   when completing in a mathematical environment such as a `<b>((</b>...<b>))</b>' construct.

                     <b>parameter</b>
                            when completing the name of a parameter in a parameter expansion  beginning  with  <b>$</b>
                            but not <b>${</b>.

                     <b>redirect</b>
                            when completing after a redirection operator.

                     <b>subscript</b>
                            when completing inside a parameter subscript.

                     <b>value</b>  when completing the value of a parameter assignment.

              <b>exact</b>  Controls  the  behaviour  when the <b>REC_EXACT</b> option is set.  It will be set to <b>accept</b> if an
                     exact match would be accepted, and will be unset otherwise.

                     If it was set when at least one match equal to the string on the line  was  generated,  the
                     match is accepted.

              <b>exact_string</b>
                     The string of an exact match if one was found, otherwise unset.

              <b>ignored</b>
                     The  number of completions that were ignored because they matched one of the patterns given
                     with the <b>-F</b> option to the <b>compadd</b> builtin command.

              <b>insert</b> This controls the manner in which a match is inserted into the command line.  On  entry  to
                     the  widget  function,  if  it  is  unset  the command line is not to be changed; if set to
                     <b>unambiguous</b>,  any  prefix  common  to  all  matches  is  to  be   inserted;   if   set   to
                     <b>automenu-unambiguous</b>,  the  common  prefix is to be inserted and the next invocation of the
                     completion code may start menu completion (due to the <b>AUTO_MENU</b> option being set);  if  set
                     to <b>menu</b> or <b>automenu</b> menu completion will be started for the matches currently generated (in
                     the  latter case this will happen because the <b>AUTO_MENU</b> is set). The value may also contain
                     the string `<b>tab</b>' when the completion code would normally not really do completion, but only
                     insert the TAB character.

                     On exit it may be set to any of the values above (where setting it to the empty  string  is
                     the  same  as  unsetting it), or to a number, in which case the match whose number is given
                     will be inserted into the command line.  Negative numbers  count  backward  from  the  last
                     match  (with  `<b>-1</b>' selecting the last match) and out-of-range values are wrapped around, so
                     that a value of zero selects the last match and a value one more than the  maximum  selects
                     the first. Unless the value of this key ends in a space, the match is inserted as in a menu
                     completion, i.e. without automatically appending a space.

                     Both  <b>menu</b>  and  <b>automenu</b> may also specify the number of the match to insert, given after a
                     colon.  For example, `<b>menu:2</b>' says to start menu  completion,  beginning  with  the  second
                     match.

                     Note that a value containing the substring `<b>tab</b>' makes the matches generated be ignored and
                     only the TAB be inserted.

                     Finally,  it may also be set to <b>all</b>, which makes all matches generated be inserted into the
                     line.

              <b>insert_positions</b>
                     When the completion system inserts an unambiguous  string  into  the  line,  there  may  be
                     multiple  places  where characters are missing or where the character inserted differs from
                     at least one match.  The value of this key contains a colon separated  list  of  all  these
                     positions, as indexes into the command line.

              <b>last_prompt</b>
                     If  this  is set to a non-empty string for every match added, the completion code will move
                     the cursor back to the previous prompt after the list of completions  has  been  displayed.
                     Initially this is set or unset according to the <b>ALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT</b> option.

              <b>list</b>   This  controls  whether  or  how  the list of matches will be displayed.  If it is unset or
                     empty they will never be listed; if its value begins with <b>list</b>, they will always be listed;
                     if it begins with <b>autolist</b> or  <b>ambiguous</b>,  they  will  be  listed  when  the  <b>AUTO_LIST</b>  or
                     <b>LIST_AMBIGUOUS</b> options respectively would normally cause them to be.

                     If  the substring <b>force</b> appears in the value, this makes the list be shown even if there is
                     only one match. Normally, the list would be shown only if there are at least two matches.

                     The value contains the substring <b>packed</b> if the <b>LIST_PACKED</b> option is set. If this substring
                     is given for all matches added to a group, this group will show the  <b>LIST_PACKED</b>  behavior.
                     The same is done for the <b>LIST_ROWS_FIRST</b> option with the substring <b>rows</b>.

                     Finally,  if  the  value contains the string <b>explanations</b>, only the explanation strings, if
                     any, will be listed and if it contains <b>messages</b>, only  the  messages  (added  with  the  <b>-x</b>
                     option  of  <b>compadd</b>)  will  be  listed.  If it contains both <b>explanations</b> and <b>messages</b> both
                     kinds of explanation strings will be listed.  It will be set appropriately on  entry  to  a
                     completion widget and may be changed there.

              <b>list_lines</b>
                     This  gives  the  number  of lines that are needed to display the full list of completions.
                     Note that to calculate the total number of lines to display you need to add the  number  of
                     lines  needed  for  the  command  line to this value, this is available as the value of the
                     <b>BUFFERLINES</b> special parameter.

              <b>list_max</b>
                     Initially this is set to the value of the <b>LISTMAX</b> parameter.  It may be set  to  any  other
                     value;  when  the  widget  exits  this  value  will be used in the same way as the value of
                     <b>LISTMAX</b>.

              <b>nmatches</b>
                     The number of matches added by the completion code so far.

              <b>old_insert</b>
                     On entry to the widget this will be set to the number of  the  match  of  an  old  list  of
                     completions  that  is  currently  inserted  into  the  command  line.  If no match has been
                     inserted, this is unset.

                     As with <b>old_list</b>, the value of this key will only be used if it is the string <b>keep</b>.  If  it
                     was  set  to  this value by the widget and there was an old match inserted into the command
                     line, this match will be kept and if the value of the <b>insert</b>  key  specifies  that  another
                     match should be inserted, this will be inserted after the old one.

              <b>old_list</b>
                     This is set to <b>yes</b> if there is still a valid list of completions from a previous completion
                     at  the  time  the  widget  is  invoked.   This will usually be the case if and only if the
                     previous editing operation was a  completion  widget  or  one  of  the  builtin  completion
                     functions.   If  there  is  a  valid list and it is also currently shown on the screen, the
                     value of this key is <b>shown</b>.

                     After the widget has exited the value of this key is only used if it was set to  <b>keep</b>.   In
                     this  case the completion code will continue to use this old list.  If the widget generated
                     new matches, they will not be used.

              <b>parameter</b>
                     The name of the parameter when completing in a subscript or in the  value  of  a  parameter
                     assignment.

              <b>pattern_insert</b>
                     Normally  this is set to <b>menu</b>, which specifies that menu completion will be used whenever a
                     set of matches was generated using <b>pattern_match</b> (see below).  If it is set  to  any  other
                     non-empty  string by the user and menu completion is not selected by other option settings,
                     the code will instead insert any common prefix for the generated  matches  as  with  normal
                     completion.

              <b>pattern_match</b>
                     Locally  controls  the behaviour given by the <b>GLOB_COMPLETE</b> option.  Initially it is set to
                     `<b>*</b>' if and only if the option is set.  The completion widget may set it to this  value,  to
                     an  empty  string  (which  has  the same effect as unsetting it), or to any other non-empty
                     string.  If it is non-empty, unquoted metacharacters on the command line will be treated as
                     patterns; if it is `<b>*</b>', then additionally a wildcard `<b>*</b>' is assumed at the cursor position;
                     if it is empty or unset, metacharacters will be treated literally.

                     Note that the match specifications given to the <b>compadd</b> builtin command  are  not  used  if
                     this is set to a non-empty string.

              <b>quote</b>  When  completing inside quotes, this contains the quotation character (i.e. either a single
                     quote, a double quote, or a backtick).  Otherwise it is unset.

              <b>quoting</b>
                     When completing inside single quotes, this is set  to  the  string  <b>single</b>;  inside  double
                     quotes, the string <b>double</b>; inside backticks, the string <b>backtick</b>.  Otherwise it is unset.

              <b>redirect</b>
                     The redirection operator when completing in a redirection position, i.e. one of <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, etc.

              <b>restore</b>
                     This  is  set  to  <b>auto</b>  before  a function is entered, which forces the special parameters
                     mentioned above (<b>words</b>, <b>CURRENT</b>, <b>PREFIX</b>, <b>IPREFIX</b>, <b>SUFFIX</b>, and <b>ISUFFIX</b>) to  be  restored  to
                     their  previous values when the function exits.   If a function unsets it or sets it to any
                     other string, they will not be restored.

              <b>to_end</b> Specifies the occasions on which the cursor is moved to the end of a string when a match is
                     inserted.  On entry to a widget function, it may be <b>single</b>  if  this  will  happen  when  a
                     single  unambiguous  match  was  inserted  or  <b>match</b>  if it will happen any time a match is
                     inserted (for example, by menu  completion;  this  is  likely  to  be  the  effect  of  the
                     <b>ALWAYS_TO_END</b> option).

                     On  exit,  it may be set to <b>single</b> as above.  It may also be set to <b>always</b>, or to the empty
                     string or unset; in those cases the cursor will be moved to the end of the string always or
                     never respectively.  Any other string is treated as <b>match</b>.

              <b>unambiguous</b>
                     This key is read-only and will always  be  set  to  the  common  (unambiguous)  prefix  the
                     completion code has generated for all matches added so far.

              <b>unambiguous_cursor</b>
                     This  gives  the  position  the  cursor  would  be  placed  at  if the common prefix in the
                     <b>unambiguous</b> key were inserted, relative to the value of  that  key.  The  cursor  would  be
                     placed before the character whose index is given by this key.

              <b>unambiguous_positions</b>
                     This contains all positions where characters in the unambiguous string are missing or where
                     the  character  inserted differs from at least one of the matches.  The positions are given
                     as indexes into the string given by the value of the <b>unambiguous</b> key.

              <b>vared</b>  If completion is called while editing a line using the <b>vared</b> builtin, the value of this key
                     is set to the name of the parameter given as an argument to <b>vared</b>.  This key  is  only  set
                     while a <b>vared</b> command is active.

       <b>words</b>  This array contains the words present on the command line currently being edited.

               [<b>-M</b> <u>match-spec</u> ] [ <b>--</b> ] [ <u>completions</u> ... ]

              This  builtin  command  can  be  used  to add matches directly and control all the information the
              completion code stores with each possible completion. The return status is zero if  at  least  one
              match was added and non-zero if no matches were added.

              The completion code breaks each match into seven fields in the order:

                     <u>&lt;ipre&gt;&lt;apre&gt;&lt;hpre&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;hsuf&gt;&lt;asuf&gt;&lt;isuf&gt;</u>

              The  first  field  is  an  ignored prefix taken from the command line, the contents of the <b>IPREFIX</b>
              parameter plus the string given with the <b>-i</b> option. With the <b>-U</b> option, only the string  from  the
              <b>-i</b>  option  is  used. The field <u>&lt;apre&gt;</u> is an optional prefix string given with the <b>-P</b> option.  The
              <u>&lt;hpre&gt;</u> field is a string that is considered part of the match but that should not  be  shown  when
              listing  completions, given with the <b>-p</b> option; for example, functions that do filename generation
              might specify a common path prefix this way.  <u>&lt;body&gt;</u> is the part of the match that  should  appear
              in  the  list  of matches shown to the user.  The suffixes <u>&lt;hsuf&gt;</u>, <u>&lt;asuf&gt;</u> and <u>&lt;isuf&gt;</u> correspond to
              the prefixes <u>&lt;hpre&gt;</u>, <u>&lt;apre&gt;</u> and <u>&lt;ipre&gt;</u> and are given by the options <b>-s</b>, <b>-S</b> and <b>-I</b>, respectively.

              The supported flags are:

              <b>-P</b> <u>prefix</u>
                     This gives a string to be inserted before each match.  The string given is  not  considered
                     as  part of the match and any shell metacharacters in it will not be quoted when the string
                     is inserted.

              <b>-S</b> <u>suffix</u>
                     Like <b>-P</b>, but gives a string to be inserted after each match.

              <b>-p</b> <u>hidden-prefix</u>
                     This gives a string that should be inserted before each match but that should not appear in
                     the list of matches. Unless the <b>-U</b> option is given, this string must be matched as part  of
                     the string on the command line.

              <b>-s</b> <u>hidden-suffix</u>
                     Like `<b>-p</b>', but gives a string to insert after each match.

              <b>-i</b> <u>ignored-prefix</u>
                     This  gives  a string to insert just before any string given with the `<b>-P</b>' option.  Without
                     `<b>-P</b>' the string is inserted before the string given  with  `<b>-p</b>'  or  directly  before  each
                     match.

              <b>-I</b> <u>ignored-suffix</u>
                     Like <b>-i</b>, but gives an ignored suffix.

              <b>-a</b>     With  this flag the <u>completions</u> are taken as names of arrays and the actual completions are
                     their values.  If only some elements of the arrays are needed,  the  <u>completions</u>  may  also
                     contain subscripts, as in `<b>foo[2,-1]</b>'.

              <b>-k</b>     With  this  flag  the  <u>completions</u>  are taken as names of associative arrays and the actual
                     completions are their keys.  As for <b>-a</b>, the  <u>words</u>  may  also  contain  subscripts,  as  in
                     `<b>foo[(R)*bar*]</b>'.

              <b>-d</b> <u>array</u>
                     This  adds  per-completion  display  strings.  The  <u>array</u>  should  contain  one element per
                     <u>completion</u> given. The completion code will then display the first element  instead  of  the
                     first  <u>completion</u>,  and  so on. The <u>array</u> may be given as the name of an array parameter or
                     directly as a space-separated list of words in parentheses.

                     If there are fewer display strings than  <u>completions</u>,  the  leftover  <u>completions</u>  will  be
                     displayed  unchanged  and  if there are more display strings than <u>completions</u>, the leftover
                     display strings will be silently ignored.

              <b>-l</b>     This option only has an effect if used together with the <b>-d</b> option. If  it  is  given,  the
                     display strings are listed one per line, not arrayed in columns.

              <b>-o</b> [ <u>order</u> ]
                     This  controls  the  order  in  which  matches  are sorted. <u>order</u> is a comma-separated list
                     comprising the following possible values.  These values can be abbreviated to their initial
                     two or three characters.  Note that the order forms part of the group name space so matches
                     with different orderings will not be in the same group.

                     <b>match</b>  If given, the order of the output is determined by the match strings;  otherwise  it
                            is determined by the display strings (i.e. the strings given by the <b>-d</b> option). This
                            is the default if `<b>-o</b>' is specified but the <u>order</u> argument is omitted.

                     <b>nosort</b> This  specifies  that  the  <u>completions</u>  are  pre-sorted  and  their order should be
                            preserved.  This value only makes sense  alone  and  cannot  be  combined  with  any
                            others.

                     <b>numeric</b>
                            If the matches include numbers, sort them numerically rather than lexicographically.

                     <b>reverse</b>
                            Arrange the matches backwards by reversing the sort ordering.

              <b>-J</b> <u>group-name</u>
                     Gives the name of the group that the matches should be stored in.

              <b>-V</b> <u>group-name</u>
                     Like <b>-J</b> but naming an unsorted group. This option is identical to the combination of <b>-J</b> and
                     <b>-o</b> <b>nosort</b>.

              <b>-1</b>     If  given  together  with  the <b>-V</b> option, makes only consecutive duplicates in the group be
                     removed. If combined with the <b>-J</b> option, this has no visible effect. Note that groups  with
                     and without this flag are in different name spaces.

              <b>-2</b>     If  given  together  with  the <b>-J</b> or <b>-V</b> option, makes all duplicates be kept. Again, groups
                     with and without this flag are in different name spaces.

              <b>-X</b> <u>explanation</u>
                     The <u>explanation</u> string will be printed with the list of matches, above the group  currently
                     selected.

                     Within the <u>explanation</u>, the following sequences may be used to specify output attributes as
                     described  in  the  section  EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in <u><a href="../man1/zshmisc.1.html">zshmisc</a></u>(1): `<b>%B</b>', `<b>%S</b>', `<b>%U</b>',
                     `<b>%F</b>', `<b>%K</b>' and their lower case  counterparts,  as  well  as  `<b>%{</b>...<b>%}</b>'.   `<b>%F</b>',  `<b>%K</b>'  and
                     `<b>%{</b>...<b>%}</b>'  take  arguments  in  the same form as prompt expansion.  (Note that the sequence
                     `<b>%G</b>' is not available; an argument to `<b>%{</b>' should be  used  instead.)   The  sequence  `<b>%%</b>'
                     produces a literal `<b>%</b>'.

                     These  sequences  are  most  often employed by users when customising the <b>format</b> style (see
                     <u><a href="../man1/zshcompsys.1.html">zshcompsys</a></u>(1)), but they must also be taken into account when writing completion functions,
                     as passing descriptions  with  unescaped  `<b>%</b>'  characters  to  utility  functions  such  as
                     <b>_arguments</b>  and  <b>_message</b> may produce unexpected results. If arbitrary text is to be passed
                     in a description, it can be escaped using e.g. <b>${my_str//\%/%%}</b>.

              <b>-x</b> <u>message</u>
                     Like <b>-X</b>, but the <u>message</u> will be printed even if there are no matches in the group.

              <b>-q</b>     The suffix given with <b>-S</b> will be automatically removed if the next  character  typed  is  a
                     blank  or does not insert anything, or if the suffix consists of only one character and the
                     next character typed is the same character.

              <b>-r</b> <u>remove-chars</u>
                     This is a more versatile form of the <b>-q</b> option.  The suffix given  with  <b>-S</b>  or  the  slash
                     automatically  added after completing directories will be automatically removed if the next
                     character typed inserts one of the characters given in the <u>remove-chars</u>.   This  string  is
                     parsed  as  a  characters  class  and understands the backslash sequences used by the <b>print</b>
                     command.  For example, `<b>-r</b> <b>"a-z\t"</b>' removes the suffix if the next character typed  inserts
                     a  lower  case character or a TAB, and `<b>-r</b> <b>"^0-9"</b>' removes the suffix if the next character
                     typed inserts anything but a digit. One extra backslash  sequence  is  understood  in  this
                     string: `<b>\-</b>' stands for all characters that insert nothing. Thus `<b>-S</b> <b>"="</b> <b>-q</b>' is the same as
                     `<b>-S</b> <b>"="</b> <b>-r</b> <b>"=</b> <b>\t\n\-"</b>'.

                     This option may also be used without the <b>-S</b> option; then any automatically added space will
                     be removed when one of the characters in the list is typed.

              <b>-R</b> <u>remove-func</u>
                     This is another form of the <b>-r</b> option. When a match has been accepted and a suffix has been
                     inserted,  the  function  <u>remove-func</u> will be called after the next character typed.  It is
                     passed the length of the suffix as an argument and can use the special parameters available
                     in ordinary (non-completion) zle widgets (see <u><a href="../man1/zshzle.1.html">zshzle</a></u>(1)) to analyse and modify the  command
                     line.

              <b>-f</b>     If  this  flag  is given, all of the matches built from the <u>completions</u> are marked as being
                     the names of files.  They are not required to be actual filenames, but if they are, and the
                     option <b>LIST_TYPES</b> is set,  the  characters  describing  the  types  of  the  files  in  the
                     completion  lists  will  be  shown. This also forces a slash to be added when the name of a
                     directory is completed.

              <b>-e</b>     This flag can be used to tell the completion code that  the  matches  added  are  parameter
                     names  for  a  parameter expansion. This will make the <b>AUTO_PARAM_SLASH</b> and <b>AUTO_PARAM_KEYS</b>
                     options be used for the matches.

              <b>-W</b> <u>file-prefix</u>
                     This string is a pathname that will be prepended to each match  together  with  any  prefix
                     specified  by  the  <b>-p</b>  option  to  form a complete filename for testing.  Hence it is only
                     useful if combined with the <b>-f</b> flag, as the tests will not otherwise be performed.

              <b>-F</b> <u>array</u>
                     Specifies an array containing patterns.  <u>completions</u> that match one of these  patterns  are
                     ignored, that is, not considered to be matches.

                     The  <u>array</u>  may be the name of an array parameter or a list of literal patterns enclosed in
                     parentheses and quoted, as in `<b>-F</b> <b>"(*?.o</b> <b>*?.h)"</b>'. If the name of an  array  is  given,  the
                     elements of the array are taken as the patterns.

              <b>-Q</b>     This flag instructs the completion code not to quote any metacharacters in the matches when
                     inserting them into the command line.

              <b>-M</b> <u>match-spec</u>
                     This  gives  local  match  specifications  as  described  below  in the section `Completion
                     Matching Control'. This option may be given more than once.  In this case  all  <u>match-spec</u>s
                     given  are  concatenated  with spaces between them to form the specification string to use.
                     Note that they will only be used if the <b>-U</b> option is not given.

              <b>-n</b>     Specifies that matching <u>completions</u> are to be added to the set of matches, but are  not  to
                     be listed to the user.

              <b>-U</b>     If this flag is given, all <u>completions</u> are added to the set of matches and no matching will
                     be  done  by  the  completion code. Normally this is used in functions that do the matching
                     themselves.

              <b>-O</b> <u>array</u>
                     If this option is given, the <u>completions</u> are <u>not</u> added to the  set  of  matches.   Instead,
                     matching is done as usual and all of the <u>completions</u> that match will be stored in the array
                     parameter whose name is given as <u>array</u>.

              <b>-A</b> <u>array</u>
                     As  the <b>-O</b> option, except that instead of those of the <u>completions</u> which match being stored
                     in <u>array</u>, the strings generated internally by the completion code are stored.  For example,
                     with a match specification of `<b>-M</b> <b>"L:|no="</b>', a current word of  `<b>nof</b>'  and  <u>completions</u>  of
                     `<b>foo</b>', this option stores the string `<b>nofoo</b>' in the array, whereas the <b>-O</b> option stores the
                     `<b>foo</b>' originally given.

              <b>-D</b> <u>array</u>
                     As with <b>-O</b>, the <u>completions</u> are not added to the set of matches.  Instead, whenever the <u>n</u>th
                     <u>completion</u> does not match, the <u>n</u>th element of the <u>array</u> is removed.  Elements for which the
                     corresponding  <u>completion</u>  matches are retained.  This option can be used more than once to
                     remove elements from multiple arrays.

              <b>-C</b>     This option adds a special match which expands to all other matches when inserted into  the
                     line,  even those that are added after this option is used.  Together with the <b>-d</b> option it
                     is possible to specify a string that should be displayed  in  the  list  for  this  special
                     match.   If  no  string  is given, it will be shown as a string containing the strings that
                     would be inserted for the other matches, truncated to the width of the screen.

              <b>-E</b> <u>number</u>
                     This option adds <u>number</u> empty matches after matching <u>completions</u> have been added.  An empty
                     match takes up space in completion listings but will never be  inserted  in  the  line  and
                     can't  be  selected  with menu completion or menu selection.  This makes empty matches only
                     useful to format completion lists and to make explanatory string  be  shown  in  completion
                     lists  (since  empty matches can be given display strings with the <b>-d</b> option).  And because
                     all but one empty string would otherwise be removed, this option  implies  the  <b>-V</b>  and  <b>-2</b>
                     options  (even  if  an  explicit  <b>-J</b> option is given).  This can be important to note as it
                     affects the name space into which matches are added.

              <b>-</b>
              <b>--</b>     This flag ends the list of flags and options. All arguments after it will be taken  as  the
                     <u>completions</u> even if they begin with hyphens.

              Except  for  the  <b>-M</b>  flag,  if any of these flags is given more than once, the first one (and its
              argument) will be used.

       <b>compset</b> <b>-p</b> <u>number</u>
       <b>compset</b> <b>-P</b> [ <u>number</u> ] <u>pattern</u>
       <b>compset</b> <b>-s</b> <u>number</u>
       <b>compset</b> <b>-S</b> [ <u>number</u> ] <u>pattern</u>
       <b>compset</b> <b>-n</b> <u>begin</u> [ <u>end</u> ]
       <b>compset</b> <b>-N</b> <u>beg-pat</u> [ <u>end-pat</u> ]
       <b>compset</b> <b>-q</b>
              This command simplifies modification of the special parameters, while  its  return  status  allows
              tests on them to be carried out.

              The options are:

              <b>-p</b> <u>number</u>
                     If  the  value of the <b>PREFIX</b> parameter is at least <u>number</u> characters long, the first <u>number</u>
                     characters are removed from it and appended to the contents of the <b>IPREFIX</b> parameter.

              <b>-P</b> [ <u>number</u> ] <u>pattern</u>
                     If the value of the <b>PREFIX</b> parameter begins with anything that  matches  the  <u>pattern</u>,  the
                     matched portion is removed from <b>PREFIX</b> and appended to <b>IPREFIX</b>.

                     Without  the  optional <u>number</u>, the longest match is taken, but if <u>number</u> is given, anything
                     up to the <u>number</u>th match is moved.  If the <u>number</u> is negative, the <u>number</u>th  longest  match
                     is  moved.  For  example, if <b>PREFIX</b> contains the string `<b>a=b=c</b>', then <b>compset</b> <b>-P</b> <b>'*\='</b> will
                     move the string `<b>a=b=</b>' into the <b>IPREFIX</b> parameter, but <b>compset</b> <b>-P</b> <b>1</b> <b>'*\='</b>  will  move  only
                     the string `<b>a=</b>'.

              <b>-s</b> <u>number</u>
                     As <b>-p</b>, but transfer the last <u>number</u> characters from the value of <b>SUFFIX</b> to the front of the
                     value of <b>ISUFFIX</b>.

              <b>-S</b> [ <u>number</u> ] <u>pattern</u>
                     As  <b>-P</b>,  but match the last portion of <b>SUFFIX</b> and transfer the matched portion to the front
                     of the value of <b>ISUFFIX</b>.

              <b>-n</b> <u>begin</u> [ <u>end</u> ]
                     If the current word position as specified by the parameter <b>CURRENT</b> is greater than or equal
                     to <u>begin</u>, anything up to the <u>begin</u>th word is removed from the <b>words</b> array and the value  of
                     the parameter <b>CURRENT</b> is decremented by <u>begin</u>.

                     If the optional <u>end</u> is given, the modification is done only if the current word position is
                     also  less than or equal to <u>end</u>. In this case, the words from position <u>end</u> onwards are also
                     removed from the <b>words</b> array.

                     Both <u>begin</u> and <u>end</u> may be negative to count backwards from the last element  of  the  <b>words</b>
                     array.

              <b>-N</b> <u>beg-pat</u> [ <u>end-pat</u> ]
                     If one of the elements of the <b>words</b> array before the one at the index given by the value of
                     the  parameter  <b>CURRENT</b>  matches  the pattern <u>beg-pat</u>, all elements up to and including the
                     matching one are removed from the <b>words</b> array and the value of <b>CURRENT</b> is changed to  point
                     to the same word in the changed array.

                     If  the  optional pattern <u>end-pat</u> is also given, and there is an element in the <b>words</b> array
                     matching this pattern, the parameters are modified only if the index of this word is higher
                     than the one given by the <b>CURRENT</b> parameter (so that the matching word has to be after  the
                     cursor).  In  this  case, the words starting with the one matching <b>end-pat</b> are also removed
                     from the <b>words</b> array.  If  <b>words</b>  contains  no  word  matching  <u>end-pat</u>,  the  testing  and
                     modification is performed as if it were not given.

              <b>-q</b>     The  word  currently being completed is split on spaces into separate words, respecting the
                     usual shell quoting conventions.  The resulting words are stored in the  <b>words</b>  array,  and
                     <b>CURRENT</b>,  <b>PREFIX</b>, <b>SUFFIX</b>, <b>QIPREFIX</b>, and <b>QISUFFIX</b> are modified to reflect the word part that
                     is completed.

              In all the above cases the return status is zero if the test succeeded  and  the  parameters  were
              modified and non-zero otherwise. This allows one to use this builtin in tests such as:

                     <b>if</b> <b>compset</b> <b>-P</b> <b>'*\=';</b> <b>then</b> <b>...</b>

              This forces anything up to and including the last equal sign to be ignored by the completion code.

       <b>compcall</b> [ <b>-TD</b> ]
              This  allows  the  use  of  completions  defined  with  the <b>compctl</b> builtin from within completion
              widgets.  The list of matches will be generated as if one of the non-widget  completion  functions
              (<b>complete-word</b>,  etc.)  had been called, except that only <b>compctl</b>s given for specific commands are
              used. To force the code to try completions defined with  the  <b>-T</b>  option  of  <b>compctl</b>  and/or  the
              default  completion  (whether  defined  by  <b>compctl</b>  <b>-D</b> or the builtin default) in the appropriate
              places, the <b>-T</b> and/or <b>-D</b> flags can be passed to <b>compcall</b>.

              The return status can be used to test if a matching <b>compctl</b> definition was found. It  is  non-zero
              if a <b>compctl</b> was found and zero otherwise.

              Note that this builtin is defined by the <b>zsh/compctl</b> module.

</pre><h4><b>COMPLETION</b> <b>CONDITION</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  additional  condition  codes  for  use  within  the  <b>[[</b> <u>...</u> <b>]]</b> construct are available in
       completion widgets.  These work on the special parameters.  All of these tests can also be  performed  by
       the  <b>compset</b>  builtin,  but in the case of the condition codes the contents of the special parameters are
       not modified.

       <b>-prefix</b> [ <u>number</u> ] <u>pattern</u>
              true if the test for the <b>-P</b> option of <b>compset</b> would succeed.

       <b>-suffix</b> [ <u>number</u> ] <u>pattern</u>
              true if the test for the <b>-S</b> option of <b>compset</b> would succeed.

       <b>-after</b> <u>beg-pat</u>
              true if the test of the <b>-N</b> option with only the <u>beg-pat</u> given would succeed.

       <b>-between</b> <u>beg-pat</u> <u>end-pat</u>
              true if the test for the <b>-N</b> option with both patterns would succeed.

</pre><h4><b>COMPLETION</b> <b>MATCHING</b> <b>CONTROL</b></h4><pre>
       When the user invokes completion, the current <u>word</u> on the command line (that is, the word the  cursor  is
       currently  on)  is  used  to generate a <u>match</u> <u>pattern</u>.  Only those <u>completions</u> that match the pattern are
       offered to the user as <u>matches</u>.

       The default match pattern is generated from the current word by either

       •      appending a `<b>*</b>' (matching any number of characters in a completion) <u>or,</u>

       •      if the shell option <b>COMPLETE_IN_WORD</b> is set, inserting a `<b>*</b>' at the cursor position.

       This narrow pattern can be broadened selectively by passing a <u>match</u> <u>specification</u> to the <b>compadd</b>  builtin
       command  through its <b>-M</b> option (see `Completion Builtin Commands' above).  A match specification consists
       of one or more <u>matchers</u> separated by whitespace.  Matchers in a match specification are applied one at  a
       time,  from  left  to  right.  Once all matchers have been applied, completions are compared to the final
       match pattern and non-matching ones are discarded.

       •      Note that the <b>-M</b> option is ignored if the current word contains  a  glob  pattern  and  the  shell
              option <b>GLOB_COMPLETE</b> is set or if the <b>pattern_match</b> key of the special associative array <b>compstate</b>
              is set to a non-empty value (see `Completion Special Parameters' above).

       •      Users  of  the  completion  system  (see  <u><a href="../man1/zshcompsys.1.html">zshcompsys</a></u>(1))   should  generally not use the <b>-M</b> option
              directly, but rather use the <b>matcher-list</b> and <b>matcher</b> styles (see the subsection  <u>Standard</u>  <u>Styles</u>
              in the documentation for COMPLETION SYSTEM CONFIGURATION in <u><a href="../man1/zshcompsys.1.html">zshcompsys</a></u>(1)).

       Each matcher consists of

       •      a case-sensitive letter

       •      a `<b>:</b>',

       •      one or more patterns separated by pipes (`<b>|</b>'),

       •      an equals sign (`<b>=</b>'), and

       •      another pattern.

       The  patterns  before  the  `<b>=</b>'  are  used  to  match  substrings  of the current word.  For each matched
       substring, the corresponding part of the match pattern is broadened with the pattern after  the  `<b>=</b>',  by
       means of a logical <b>OR</b>.

       Each pattern in a matcher cosists of either

       •      the empty string or

       •      a sequence of

              •      literal characters (which may be quoted with a `<b>\</b>'),

              •      question marks (`<b>?</b>'),

              •      bracket  expressions  (`<b>[...]</b>';  see the subsection <u>Glob</u> <u>Operators</u> in the documentation for
                     GLOB OPERATORS in <u><a href="../man1/zshexpn.1.html">zshexpn</a></u>(1)), and/or

              •      brace expressions (see below).

       Other shell patterns are not allowed.

       A brace expression, like a bracket expression, consists of a list of

       •      literal characters,

       •      ranges (`<b>0-9</b>'), and/or

       •      character classes (`<b>[:</b><u>name</u><b>:]</b>').

       However, they differ from each other as follows:

       •      A brace expression is delimited by a pair of braces (`<b>{...}</b>').

       •      Brace expressions do not support negations.  That is, an initial `<b>!</b>' or `<b>^</b>' has no special meaning
              and will be interpreted as a literal character.

       •      When a character in the  current  word  matches  the  <u>n</u>th  pattern  in  a  brace  expression,  the
              corresponding  part  of  the  match  pattern  is  broadened only with the <u>n</u>th pattern of the brace
              expression on the other side of the `<b>=</b>', if there is one; if there is no brace expression  on  the
              other  side,  then this pattern is the empty string.  However, if either brace expression has more
              elements than the other, then the excess entries are simply ignored.  When comparing indexes, each
              literal character or character class counts as one element, but each range is instead expanded  to
              the full list of literal characters it represents.  Additionally, if on <u>both</u> sides of the `<b>=</b>', the
              <u>n</u>th pattern is `<b>[:upper:]</b>' or `<b>[:lower:]</b>', then these are expanded as ranges, too.

       Note  that, although the matching system does not yet handle multibyte characters, this is likely to be a
       future extension.  Hence, using `<b>[:upper:]</b>' and `<b>[:lower:]</b>' is recommended over `<b>A-Z</b>' and `<b>a-z</b>'.

       Below are the different forms of matchers supported.   Each  <u>uppercase</u>  form  behaves  exactly  like  its
       lowercase  counterpart, but adds an additional step <u>after</u> the match pattern has filtered out non-matching
       completions:  Each of a match's substrings that was matched by a subpattern from an uppercase matcher  is
       replaced with the corresponding substring of the current word.  However, patterns from <u>lowercase</u> matchers
       have higher weight:  If a substring of the current word was matched by patterns from both a lowercase and
       an  uppercase  matcher, then the lowercase matcher's pattern wins and the corresponding part of the match
       is not modified.

       Unless indicated otherwise, each example listed assumes  <b>COMPLETE_IN_WORD</b>  to  be  unset  (as  it  is  by
       default).

       <b>m:</b><u>word-pat</u><b>=</b><u>match-pat</u>
       <b>M:</b><u>word-pat</u><b>=</b><u>match-pat</u>

              For  each  substring  of the current word that matches <u>word-pat</u>, broaden the corresponding part of
              the match pattern to additionally match <u>match-pat</u>.

              Examples:

                     <b>m:{[:lower:]}={[:upper:]}</b> lets any lower case character in the current word be completed to
                     itself or its uppercase counterpart.  So, the completions `<b>foo</b>', `<b>FOO</b>' and `<b>Foo</b>'  will  are
                     be considered matches for the word `<b>fo</b>'.

                     <b>M:_=</b>  inserts  every underscore from the current word into each match, in the same relative
                     position, determined by matching the substrings around it.  So, given a  completion  `<b>foo</b>',
                     the  word  `<b>f_o</b>'  will  be  completed  to  the match `<b>f_oo</b>', even though the latter was not
                     present as a completion.

       <b>b:</b><u>word-pat</u><b>=</b><u>match-pat</u>
       <b>B:</b><u>word-pat</u><b>=</b><u>match-pat</u>
       <b>e:</b><u>word-pat</u><b>=</b><u>match-pat</u>
       <b>E:</b><u>word-pat</u><b>=</b><u>match-pat</u>

              For each consecutive substring at the  <b>b:</b>eginning  or  <b>e:</b>nd  of  the  current  word  that  matches
              <u>word-pat</u>, broaden the corresponding part of the match pattern to additionally match <u>match-pat</u>.

              Examples:

                     `<b>b:-=+</b>' lets any number of minuses at the start of the current word be completed to a minus
                     or a plus.

                     `<b>B:0=</b>' adds all zeroes at the beginning of the current word to the beginning of each match.

       <b>l:|</b><u>word-pat</u><b>=</b><u>match-pat</u>
       <b>L:|</b><u>word-pat</u><b>=</b><u>match-pat</u>
       <b>R:</b><u>word-pat</u><b>|=</b><u>match-pat</u>
       <b>r:</b><u>word-pat</u><b>|=</b><u>match-pat</u>

              If  there  is  a  substring at the <b>l:</b>eft or <b>r:</b>ight edge of the current word that matches <u>word-pat</u>,
              then broaden the corresponding part of the match pattern to additionally match <u>match-pat</u>.

              For each <b>l:</b>, <b>L:</b>, <b>r:</b> and <b>R:</b> matcher (including the ones below), the pattern <u>match-pat</u> may also be a
              `<b>*</b>'.  This matches any number of characters in a completion.

              Examples:

                     `<b>r:|=*</b>' appends a `<b>*</b>' to the match pattern, even  when  <b>COMPLETE_IN_WORD</b>  is  set  and  the
                     cursor is not at the end of the current word.

                     If the current word starts with a minus, then `<b>L:|-=</b>' will prepend it to each match.

       <b>l:</b><u>anchor</u><b>|</b><u>word-pat</u><b>=</b><u>match-pat</u>
       <b>L:</b><u>anchor</u><b>|</b><u>word-pat</u><b>=</b><u>match-pat</u>
       <b>r:</b><u>word-pat</u><b>|</b><u>anchor</u><b>=</b><u>match-pat</u>
       <b>R:</b><u>word-pat</u><b>|</b><u>anchor</u><b>=</b><u>match-pat</u>

              For  each  substring  of  the  current  word  that matches <u>word-pat</u> and has on its <b>l:</b>eft or <b>r:</b>ight
              another substring matching <u>anchor</u>,  broaden  the  corresponding  part  of  the  match  pattern  to
              additionally match <u>match-pat</u>.

              Note that these matchers (and the ones below) modify only what is matched by <u>word-pat</u>; they do not
              change  the  matching behavior of what is matched by <u>anchor</u> (or <u>coanchor</u>; see the matchers below).
              Thus, unless its corresponding part of the match pattern has been  modified,  the  anchor  in  the
              current  word  has  to  match  literally  in each completion, just like any other substring of the
              current word.

              If a matcher includes at least one anchor (which includes the matchers with two  anchors,  below),
              then  <u>match-pat</u>  may  also  be  `<b>*</b>' or `<b>**</b>'.  `<b>*</b>' can match any part of a completion that does not
              contain any substrings matching <u>anchor</u>, whereas a `<b>**</b>' can match any part of a completion, period.
              (Note that this is different from the behavior of `<b>*</b>' in the anchorless forms of `<b>l:</b>' and `<b>r:</b>' and
              and also different from `<b>*</b>' and `<b>**</b>' in glob expressions.)

              Examples:

                     `<b>r:|.=*</b>' makes the completion `<b>comp.sources.unix</b>' a match for the word `<b>..u</b>' -- but <u>not</u> for
                     the word `<b>.u</b>'.

                     Given a completion `<b>--foo</b>', the matcher `<b>L:--|no-=</b>' will complete the word `<b>--no-</b>'  to  the
                     match `<b>--no-foo</b>'.

       <b>l:</b><u>anchor</u><b>||</b><u>coanchor</u><b>=</b><u>match-pat</u>
       <b>L:</b><u>anchor</u><b>||</b><u>coanchor</u><b>=</b><u>match-pat</u>
       <b>r:</b><u>coanchor</u><b>||</b><u>anchor</u><b>=</b><u>match-pat</u>
       <b>R:</b><u>coanchor</u><b>||</b><u>anchor</u><b>=</b><u>match-pat</u>

              For  any  two  consecutive  substrings  of the current word that match <u>anchor</u> and <u>coanchor</u>, in the
              order given, insert the pattern <u>match-pat</u> between their corresponding parts in the match pattern.

              Note that, unlike <u>anchor</u>, the pattern <u>coanchor</u> does not change what `<b>*</b>' can match.

              Examples:

                     `<b>r:?||[[:upper:]]=*</b>' will complete the current word `<b>fB</b>'  to  `<b>fooBar</b>',  but  it  will  not
                     complete  it  to  `<b>fooHooBar</b>' (because `<b>*</b>' here cannot match anything that includes a match
                     for `<b>[[:upper:]]</b>), nor will it complete `<b>B</b>' to `<b>fooBar</b>' (because there is no  character  in
                     the current word to match <u>coanchor</u>).

                     Given   the   current   word   `<b>pass.n</b>'   and   a  completion  `<b>pass.byname</b>',  the  matcher
                     `<b>L:.||[[:alpha:]]=by</b>' will produce the match `<b>pass.name</b>'.

       <b>x:</b>

              Ignore this matcher and all matchers to its right.

              This matcher is used to mark the end of a match specification.  In a  single  standalone  list  of
              matchers,  this  has no use, but where match specifications are concatenated, as is often the case
              when using the completion system (see <u><a href="../man1/zshcompsys.1.html">zshcompsys</a></u>(1)), it can  allow  one  match  specification  to
              override another.

</pre><h4><b>COMPLETION</b> <b>WIDGET</b> <b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       The first step is to define the widget:

              <b>zle</b> <b>-C</b> <b>complete</b> <b>complete-word</b> <b>complete-files</b>

       Then the widget can be bound to a key using the <b>bindkey</b> builtin command:

              <b>bindkey</b> <b>'^X\t'</b> <b>complete</b>

       After that the shell function <b>complete-files</b> will be invoked after typing control-X and TAB. The function
       should then generate the matches, e.g.:

              <b>complete-files</b> <b>()</b> <b>{</b> <b>compadd</b> <b>-</b> <b>*</b> <b>}</b>

       This function will complete files in the current directory matching the current word.
