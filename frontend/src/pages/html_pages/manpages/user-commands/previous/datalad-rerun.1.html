</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>datalad</b> <b>rerun</b> - re-execute previous `datalad run` commands.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>datalad</b>  <b>rerun</b>  [-h]  [--since  SINCE]  [-d DATASET] [-b NAME] [-m MESSAGE] [--onto base] [--script FILE]
              [--report] [--assume-ready {inputs|outputs|both}] [--explicit] [-J NJOBS] [--version] [REVISION]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This will unlock any dataset content that is on record to have been modified by the command in the speci‐
       fied revision.  It will then re-execute the command in the recorded path (if it was inside the  dataset).
       Afterwards, all modifications will be saved.

   <b>Report</b> <b>mode</b>
       When  called  with --report, this command reports information about what would be re-executed as a series
       of records. There will be a record for each revision in the specified revision range. Each of these  will
       have one of the following "rerun_action" values:

       -  run:  the  revision has a recorded command that would be re-executed - skip-or-pick: the revision does
       not have a recorded command and would
         be either skipped or cherry picked - merge: the revision is a merge commit and  a  corresponding  merge
       would
         be made

       The  decision to skip rather than cherry pick a revision is based on whether the revision would be reach‐
       able from HEAD at the time of execution.

       In addition, when a starting point other than HEAD is specified, there is a  rerun_action  value  "check‐
       out",  in  which  case the record includes information about the revision the would be checked out before
       rerunning any commands.

       NOTE   Currently the "onto" feature only sets the working tree of  the  current  dataset  to  a  previous
              state. The working trees of any subdatasets remain unchanged.

   <b>Examples</b>
       Re-execute the command from the previous commit::

        % datalad rerun

       Re-execute any commands in the last five commits::

        % datalad rerun --since=HEAD~5

       Do the same as above, but re-execute the commands on top of HEAD~5 in a detached state::

        % datalad rerun --onto= --since=HEAD~5

       Re-execute all previous commands and compare the old and new results::

        % # on master branch
        % datalad rerun --branch=verify --since=
        % # now on verify branch
        % datalad diff --revision=master..
        % git log --oneline --left-right --cherry-pick master...

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       REVISION
              rerun  command(s)  in  REVISION.  By  default,  the command from this commit will be executed, but
              --since can be used to construct a revision range. The default value is like "HEAD"  but  resolves
              to  the  main branch when on an adjusted branch. Constraints: value must be a string or value must
              be NONE

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>, <b>--help-np</b>
              show this help message. --help-np forcefully disables the use of a pager for displaying  the  help
              message

       <b>--since</b> <u>SINCE</u>
              If SINCE is a commit-ish, the commands from all commits that are reachable from `revision` but not
              SINCE  will  be re-executed (in other words, the commands in git log SINCE..REVISION). If SINCE is
              an empty string, it is set to the parent of the first commit  that  contains  a  recorded  command
              (i.e.,  all commands in git log REVISION will be re-executed). Constraints: value must be a string
              or value must be NONE

       <b>-d</b> <u>DATASET</u>, <b>--dataset</b> <u>DATASET</u>
              specify the dataset from which to rerun a recorded command. If no dataset is given, an attempt  is
              made  to  identify  the dataset based on the current working directory. If a dataset is given, the
              command will be executed in the root directory of this  dataset.  Constraints:  Value  must  be  a
              Dataset or a valid identifier of a Dataset (e.g. a path) or value must be NONE

       <b>-b</b> NAME, <b>--branch</b> NAME
              create and checkout this branch before rerunning the commands. Constraints: value must be a string
              or value must be NONE

       <b>-m</b> MESSAGE, <b>--message</b> MESSAGE
              use  MESSAGE for the reran commit rather than the recorded commit message. In the case of a multi-
              commit rerun, all the reran commits will have this message. Constraints: value must be a string or
              value must be NONE

       <b>--onto</b> base
              start point for rerunning the commands. If not specified, commands are executed at HEAD. This  op‐
              tion  can be used to specify an alternative start point, which will be checked out with the branch
              name specified by --branch or in a detached state otherwise. As a special case, an empty value for
              this option means the parent of the first run commit in the specified revision list.  Constraints:
              value must be a string or value must be NONE

       <b>--script</b> FILE
              extract  the  commands into FILE rather than rerunning. Use - to write to stdout instead. This op‐
              tion implies --report. Constraints: value must be a string or value must be NONE

       <b>--report</b>
              Don't actually re-execute anything, just display what would be done. Note: If you  give  this  op‐
              tion, you most likely want to set --output-format to 'json' or 'json_pp'.

       <b>--assume-ready</b> {inputs|outputs|both}
              Assume  that  inputs do not need to be retrieved and/or outputs do not need to unlocked or removed
              before running the command. This option allows you to avoid the expense of these preparation steps
              if you know that they are unnecessary. Note that this option also affects any  additional  outputs
              that  are automatically inferred based on inspecting changed files in the run commit. Constraints:
              value must be one of ('inputs', 'outputs', 'both')

       <b>--explicit</b>
              Consider the specification of inputs and outputs in the run record to be explicit. Don't  warn  if
              the repository is dirty, and only save modifications to the outputs from the original record. Note
              that  when several run commits are specified, this applies to every one. Care should also be taken
              when using --onto because checking out a new HEAD can easily fail when the working tree has  modi‐
              fications.

       <b>-J</b> NJOBS, <b>--jobs</b> NJOBS
              how many parallel jobs (where possible) to use. "auto" corresponds to the number defined by 'data‐
              lad.runtime.max-annex-jobs'  configuration  item  NOTE: This option can only parallelize input re‐
              trieval (get) and output recording (save). DataLad does NOT parallelize your scripts for you. Con‐
              straints: value must be convertible to type 'int' or value must be NONE or value must  be  one  of
              ('auto',)

       <b>--version</b>
              show the module and its version which provides the command
