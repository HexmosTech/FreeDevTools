</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       erl - Start the Erlang runtime system

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>erl</u> program starts an Erlang runtime system. The exact details (for example, whether <u>erl</u> is a script
       or a program and which other programs it calls) are system-dependent.

       <b>NOTE:</b> If you are using Erlang/OTP 25 or earlier on Windows and want to start an Erlang system  with  full
       shell  support,  you  should  use <u>werl.exe</u>.  See the Erlang/OTP 25 documentation for details on how to do
       that.

   <b>erl</b> <b>&lt;arguments&gt;</b>
       Starts an Erlang runtime system.

       The arguments can be divided into <u>emulator</u> <u>flags</u>, <u>flags</u>, and <u>plain</u> <u>arguments</u>:

       •   Any argument starting with character <u>+</u> is interpreted as an emulator flag.

           As indicated by the name, emulator flags control the behavior of the emulator.

       •   Any argument starting with character <u>-</u> (hyphen) is interpreted as a flag, which is to  be  passed  to
           the Erlang part of the runtime system, more specifically to the <u>init</u> system process, see <u>init</u>.

           The  <u>init</u> process itself interprets some of these flags, the <u>init</u> <u>flags</u>. It also stores any remaining
           flags, the <u>user</u> <u>flags</u>. The latter can be retrieved by calling <u>init:get_argument/1</u>.

           A small number of "-" flags exist, which now actually are emulator flags, see the description below.

       •   Plain arguments are not interpreted in any way. They are also stored by the <u>init</u> process and  can  be
           retrieved  by calling <u>init:get_plain_arguments/0</u>. Plain arguments can occur before the first flag, or
           after a <u>--</u> flag. Also, the <u>-extra</u> flag causes everything that follows to become plain arguments.

       <u>Examples:</u>

              % erl +W w -sname arnie +R 9 -s my_init -extra +bertie
              (arnie@host)1&gt; init:get_argument(sname).
              {ok,[["arnie"]]}
              (arnie@host)2&gt; init:get_plain_arguments().
              ["+bertie"]

       Here <u>+W</u> <u>w</u> and <u>+R</u> <u>9</u> are emulator flags. <u>-s</u> <u>my_init</u> is an init flag, interpreted by <u>init</u>. <u>-sname</u> <u>arnie</u> is a
       user flag, stored by <u>init</u>. It is  read  by  Kernel  and  causes  the  Erlang  runtime  system  to  become
       distributed. Finally, everything after <u>-extra</u> (that is, <u>+bertie</u>) is considered as plain arguments.

              % erl -myflag 1
              1&gt; init:<a href="../manmyflag/get_argument.myflag.html">get_argument</a>(myflag).
              {ok,[["1"]]}
              2&gt; init:get_plain_arguments().
              []

       Here  the  user  flag  <u>-myflag</u>  <u>1</u> is passed to and stored by the <u>init</u> process. It is a user-defined flag,
       presumably used by some user-defined application.

   <b>Flags</b>
       In the following list, init flags are marked "(init flag)". Unless otherwise specified, all  other  flags
       are  user  flags,  for  which the values can be retrieved by calling <u>init:get_argument/1</u>. Notice that the
       list of user flags is not exhaustive, there can be  more  application-specific  flags  that  instead  are
       described in the corresponding application documentation.

       -- (init flag)
         Everything  following  <u>--</u> up to the next flag (<u>-flag</u> or <u>+flag</u>) is considered plain arguments and can be
         retrieved using <u>init:get_plain_arguments/0</u>.

       -Application Par Val
         Sets the application configuration parameter <u>Par</u> to the value <u>Val</u> for the application <u>Application</u>;  see
         <u><a href="../man4/app.4.html">app</a>(4)</u> and <u>application</u>.

       -args_file FileName
         Command-line  arguments  are read from the file <u>FileName</u>. The arguments read from the file replace flag
         '<u>-args_file</u> <u>FileName</u>' on the resulting command line.

         The file <u>FileName</u> is to be a plain text file and can contain comments  and  command-line  arguments.  A
         comment  begins with a <u>#</u> character and continues until the next end of line character. Backslash (\) is
         used as quoting character. All command-line arguments accepted by <u>erl</u> are allowed, also flag <u>-args_file</u>
         <u>FileName</u>. Be careful not to cause circular  dependencies  between  files  containing  flag  <u>-args_file</u>,
         though.

         The  flag  <u>-extra</u> is treated in special way. Its scope ends at the end of the file. Arguments following
         an <u>-extra</u> flag are moved on the command line into the <u>-extra</u> section, that is, the end of  the  command
         line following after an <u>-extra</u> flag.

       -async_shell_start
         The  initial  Erlang  shell does not read user input until the system boot procedure has been completed
         (Erlang/OTP 5.4 and later). This flag disables the start synchronization feature  and  lets  the  shell
         start in parallel with the rest of the system.

       -boot File
         Specifies  the  name  of  the boot file, <u>File.boot</u>, which is used to start the system; see <u>init</u>. Unless
         <u>File</u> contains an absolute path, the  system  searches  for  <u>File.boot</u>  in  the  current  and  <u>$ROOT/bin</u>
         directories.

         Defaults to <u>$ROOT/bin/start.boot</u>.

       -boot_var Var Dir
         If  the  boot  script  contains a path variable <u>Var</u> other than <u>$ROOT</u>, this variable is expanded to <u>Dir</u>.
         Used when applications are installed in another directory than <u>$ROOT/lib</u>; see  <u>systools:make_script/1,2</u>
         in SASL.

       -code_path_cache
         Enables the code path cache of the code server; see <u>code</u>.

       -compile Mod1 Mod2 ...
         Compiles  the specified modules and then terminates (with non-zero exit code if the compilation of some
         file did not succeed). Implies <u>-noinput</u>.

         Not recommended; use <u>erlc</u> instead.

       -config Config [Config ...]
         Specifies the name of one or more configuration  files,  <u>Config.config</u>,  which  is  used  to  configure
         applications; see <u><a href="../man4/app.4.html">app</a>(4)</u> and <u>application</u>. See the documentation for the configuration file format for a
         description of the configuration format and the order in which configuration parameters are read.

       -configfd FD [FD ...]
         Specifies the name of one or more file descriptors (called configuration file descriptors from here on)
         with  configuration  data  for  applications; see <u><a href="../man4/app.4.html">app</a>(4)</u> and <u>application</u>. See the documentation for the
         configuration file format for a description  of  the  configuration  format  and  the  order  in  which
         configuration parameters are read.

         A configuration file descriptor will be read until its end and will then be closed.

         The  content  of a configuration file descriptor is stored so that it can be reused when <u>init:restart/0</u>
         or <u>init:restart/1</u> is called.

         The parameter <u>-configfd</u> <u>0</u> implies <u>-noinput</u>.

         <b>NOTE:</b> It is not recommended to use file  descriptors  1  (standard  output),  and  2  (standard  error)
         together  with  <u>-configfd</u>  as  these  file  descriptors  are typically used to print information to the
         console the program is running in.

         Examples (Unix shell):

                $ erl \
                -noshell \
                -configfd 3 \
                -eval \
                &lt;(echo '[{kernel, [{logger_level, warning}]}].')
                {ok,warning}

                $ echo '[{kernel, [{logger_level, warning}]}].' &gt; test1.config
                $ echo '[{kernel, [{logger_level, error}]}].' &gt; test2.config
                $ erl \
                -noshell \
                -configfd 3 \
                -configfd 4 \
                -eval \
                3&lt; test1.config 4&lt; test2.config
                {ok,error}

       -connect_all false
         This flag is deprecated and has been replaced by the <u>kernel</u> application parameter <u>connect_all</u>.

       -cookie Cookie
         Obsolete flag without any effect and common misspelling for <u>-setcookie</u>. Use <u>-setcookie</u> instead.

       -detached
         Starts the Erlang runtime system detached from the system  console.  Useful  for  running  daemons  and
         backgrounds processes. Implies <u>-noinput</u>.

       -disable-feature feature
         Disables  the feature <u>feature</u> in the runtime system. The special feature <u>all</u> can be used to disable all
         non permanent features.

       -dist_listen true|false
         Specifies whether this node should be listening  for  incoming  distribution  connections  or  not.  By
         default a node will listen for incoming connections. Setting this option to <u>false</u> implies <u>-hidden</u>.

       -emu_args
         Useful for debugging. Prints the arguments sent to the emulator.

       -emu_flavor emu|jit|smp
         Start  an  emulator  of a different flavor. Normally only one flavor is available, more can be added by
         building specific flavors. The currently available flavors are: <u>emu</u> and <u>jit</u>. The <u>smp</u> flavor is an alias
         for the current default flavor. You can combine this flag with <u>--emu_type</u>.  You  can  get  the  current
         flavor  at run-time using <u>erlang:system_info(emu_flavor)</u>. (The emulator with this flavor must be built.
         You can build a specific flavor by doing <u>make</u> <u>FLAVOR=$FLAVOR</u> in the Erlang/OTP source repository.)

       -emu_type Type
         Start an emulator of a different type. For example, to start the lock-counter emulator,  use  <u>-emu_type</u>
         <u>lcnt</u>.  You  can get the current type at run-time using <u>erlang:system_info(build_type)</u>. (The emulator of
         this type must already be built. Use the <u>configure</u> option  <u>--enable-lock-counter</u>  to  build  the  lock-
         counter emulator.)

       -enable-feature feature
         Enables  the  feature  <u>feature</u> in the runtime system. The special feature <u>all</u> can be used to enable all
         features.

       -env Variable Value
         Sets the host OS environment variable <u>Variable</u> to the  value  <u>Value</u>  for  the  Erlang  runtime  system.
         Example:

                % erl -env DISPLAY gin:0

         In this example, an Erlang runtime system is started with environment variable <u>DISPLAY</u> set to <u>gin:0</u>.

       -epmd_module Module
         This flag is deprecated and has been replaced by the <u>kernel</u> application parameter <u>epmd_module</u>.

       -erl_epmd_port Port
         This   flag   is   deprecated   and   has   been   replaced   by   the   <u>kernel</u>  application  parameter
         <u>erl_epmd_node_listen_port</u>.

       -eval Expr (init flag)
         Makes <u>init</u> evaluate the expression <u>Expr</u>; see <u>init</u>.

       -extra (init flag)
         Everything  following  <u>-extra</u>  is   considered   plain   arguments   and   can   be   retrieved   using
         <u>init:get_plain_arguments/0</u>.

       -heart
         Starts heartbeat monitoring of the Erlang runtime system; see <u>heart</u>.

       -hidden
         Starts  the  Erlang  runtime  system as a hidden node, if it is run as a distributed node. Hidden nodes
         always establish hidden connections to all other nodes except for  nodes  in  the  same  global  group.
         Hidden  connections  are  not  published  on any of the connected nodes, that is, none of the connected
         nodes are part of the  result  from  <u>nodes/0</u>  on  the  other  node.  See  also  hidden  global  groups;
         <u>global_group</u>.

       -hosts Hosts
         Specifies the IP addresses for the hosts on which Erlang boot servers are running, see <u>erl_boot_server</u>.
         This flag is mandatory if flag <u>-loader</u> <u>inet</u> is present.

         The IP addresses must be specified in the standard form (four decimal numbers separated by periods, for
         example,  <u>"150.236.20.74"</u>). Hosts names are not acceptable, but a broadcast address (preferably limited
         to the local network) is.

       -id Id
         Specifies the identity of the Erlang runtime system. If it is run as a distributed  node,  <u>Id</u>  must  be
         identical to the name supplied together with flag <u>-sname</u> or <u>-name</u>.

       -init_debug
         Makes <u>init</u> write some debug information while interpreting the boot script.

       -instr (emulator flag)
         Selects  an  instrumented  Erlang runtime system (virtual machine) to run, instead of the ordinary one.
         When running an instrumented runtime system, some resource usage data  can  be  obtained  and  analyzed
         using the <u>instrument</u> module. Functionally, it behaves exactly like an ordinary Erlang runtime system.

       -loader Loader
         Specifies   the   method  used  by  <u>erl_prim_loader</u>  to  load  Erlang  modules  into  the  system;  see
         <u>erl_prim_loader</u>. Two <u>Loader</u> methods are supported:

         •   <u>efile</u>, which means use the local file system, this is the default.

         •   <u>inet</u>, which means use a boot server on another machine. The flags <u>-id</u>, <u>-hosts</u> and  <u>-setcookie</u>  must
             also be specified.

         If <u>Loader</u> is something else, the user-supplied <u>Loader</u> port program is started.

       -make
         Makes  the Erlang runtime system invoke <u>make:all()</u> in the current working directory and then terminate;
         see <u>make</u>. Implies <u>-noinput</u>.

       -man Module
         Displays the manual page for the Erlang module <u>Module</u>. Only supported on Unix.

       -mode interactive | embedded
         Modules are auto loaded when they are first referenced if the runtime system runs in <u>interactive</u>  mode,
         which  is the default. In <u>embedded</u> mode modules are not auto loaded. The latter is recommended when the
         boot script preloads all modules, as conventionally happens in OTP releases. See <u>code</u>.

       -name Name
         Makes the Erlang runtime system into  a  distributed  node.  This  flag  invokes  all  network  servers
         necessary  for  a  node  to  become  distributed; see <u>net_kernel</u>. It also ensures that <u>epmd</u> runs on the
         current host before Erlang is started (see <u><a href="../man1/epmd.1.html">epmd</a>(1)</u> and the <u>-start_epmd</u> option) and that a magic  cookie
         has been set (see -setcookie).

         The  node  name will be <u>Name@Host</u>, where <u>Host</u> is the fully qualified host name of the current host. For
         short names, use flag <u>-sname</u> instead.

         If <u>Name</u> is set to <u>undefined</u> the node will be started in a special mode optimized to  be  the  temporary
         client  of another node. The node will then request a dynamic node name from the first node it connects
         to. Read more in Dynamic Node Name.

         <b>WARNING:</b> Starting a distributed node without also specifying <u>-proto_dist</u> <u>inet_tls</u> will expose the  node
         to  attacks  that  may give the attacker complete access to the node and in extension the cluster. When
         using un-secure distributed nodes, make sure that the network is configured to keep potential attackers
         out.

       -no_epmd
         Specifies that the distributed node does not need epmd at all.

         This option ensures that the Erlang runtime system does not start epmd and does not start the  <u>erl_epmd</u>
         process for distribution either.

         This  option only works if Erlang is started as a distributed node with the -proto_dist option using an
         alternative protocol for Erlang distribution which does not rely on  epmd  for  node  registration  and
         discovery.  For  more  information,  see  How  to  implement  an  Alternative  Carrier  for  the Erlang
         Distribution.

       -noinput
         Ensures that the Erlang runtime system never tries to read any input. Implies <u>-noshell</u>.

       -noshell
         Starts an Erlang runtime system with no shell. This flag makes it possible to have the  Erlang  runtime
         system as a component in a series of Unix pipes.

       -nostick
         Disables the sticky directory facility of the Erlang code server; see <u>code</u>.

       -oldshell
         Invokes the old Erlang shell from Erlang/OTP 3.3. The old shell can still be used.

       -pa Dir1 Dir2 ...
         Adds  the  specified  directories to the beginning of the code path, similar to <u>code:add_pathsa/1</u>. Note
         that the order of the given directories will be reversed in the resulting path.

         As an alternative to <u>-pa</u>, if several directories  are  to  be  prepended  to  the  code  path  and  the
         directories  have  a  common  parent  directory,  that parent directory can be specified in environment
         variable <u>ERL_LIBS</u>; see <u>code</u>.

       -pz Dir1 Dir2 ...
         Adds the specified directories to the end of the code path, similar to <u>code:add_pathsz/1</u>; see <u>code</u>.

       -path Dir1 Dir2 ...
         Replaces the path specified in the boot script; see <u><a href="../man4/script.4.html">script</a>(4)</u>.

       -proto_dist Proto
         Specifies a protocol for Erlang distribution:

         inet_tcp
           TCP over IPv4 (the default)

         inet_tls
           Distribution over TLS/SSL, See the Using SSL for Erlang Distribution User's Guide for details on  how
           to setup a secure distributed node.

         inet6_tcp
           TCP over IPv6

         For example, to start up IPv6 distributed nodes:

                % erl -name <a href="mailto:test@ipv6node.example.com">test@ipv6node.example.com</a> -proto_dist inet6_tcp

       -remsh Node
         Starts Erlang with a remote shell connected to <u>Node</u>.

         If  no  <u>-name</u>  or  <u>-sname</u>  is  given  the node will be started using <u>-sname</u> <u>undefined</u>. If <u>Node</u> does not
         contain a hostname, one is automatically taken from <u>-name</u> or <u>-sname</u>

         <b>NOTE:</b> Before OTP-23 the user <u>needed</u> to supply a valid <u>-sname</u> or <u>-name</u> for <u>-remsh</u> to work. This is still
         the case if the target node is not running OTP-23 or later.

         <b>NOTE:</b> The connecting node needs to have a proper shell with terminal emulation. This  means  that  UNIX
         users  must  use  an  Erlang compiled with terminal capabilities and before Erlang/OTP 25 Windows users
         must use <u>werl</u>.

       -rsh Program
         Specifies an alternative to <u>ssh</u> for starting a slave node on a remote host; see <u>slave</u>.

       -S Mod [Func [Arg1, Arg2, ...]] (init flag)
         Makes <u>init</u> call the specified function. <u>Func</u> defaults to <u>start</u>. The function is assumed to be of  arity
         1,  taking  the  list  <u>[Arg1,Arg2,...]</u>  as  argument,  or an empty list if no arguments are passed. All
         further arguments occurring after this option are passed to the specified function as strings.  Implies
         <u>-noshell</u>. See <u>init</u>.

       -run Mod [Func [Arg1, Arg2, ...]] (init flag)
         Makes  <u>init</u>  call  the  specified  function.  <u>Func</u> defaults to <u>start</u>. If no arguments are provided, the
         function is assumed to be of arity 0. Otherwise it is assumed  to  be  of  arity  1,  taking  the  list
         <u>[Arg1,Arg2,...]</u> as argument. All arguments are passed as strings. See <u>init</u>.

       -s Mod [Func [Arg1, Arg2, ...]] (init flag)
         Makes  <u>init</u>  call  the  specified  function.  <u>Func</u> defaults to <u>start</u>. If no arguments are provided, the
         function is assumed to be of arity 0. Otherwise it is assumed  to  be  of  arity  1,  taking  the  list
         <u>[Arg1,Arg2,...]</u> as argument. All arguments are passed as atoms. See <u>init</u>.

       -setcookie Cookie
         Sets  the  magic  cookie  of  the  node to <u>Cookie</u>; see <u>erlang:set_cookie/1</u>. See see section Distributed
         Erlang in the Erlang Reference Manual for more details.

       -setcookie Node Cookie
         Sets the magic cookie for <u>Node</u> to <u>Cookie</u>; see <u>erlang:set_cookie/2</u>.

       -shutdown_time Time
         Specifies how long time (in milliseconds) the <u>init</u> process is allowed to  spend  shutting  down  Erlang
         applications in the system. If <u>Time</u> milliseconds have elapsed, all processes still existing are killed.
         Defaults to <u>infinity</u>.

       -sname Name
         Makes the Erlang runtime system into a distributed node, similar to <u>-name</u>, but the host name portion of
         the node name <u>Name@Host</u> will be the short name, not fully qualified.

         This  is  sometimes  the  only  way  to  run  distributed Erlang if the Domain Name System (DNS) is not
         running. No communication can exist between nodes running with flag <u>-sname</u> and those running with  flag
         <u>-name</u>, as node names must be unique in distributed Erlang systems.

         If  <u>Name</u>  is  set to <u>undefined</u> the node will be started in a special mode optimized to be the temporary
         client of another node. The node will then request a dynamic node name from the first node it  connects
         to. Read more in Dynamic Node Name.

         <b>WARNING:</b>  Starting a distributed node without also specifying <u>-proto_dist</u> <u>inet_tls</u> will expose the node
         to attacks that may give the attacker complete access to the node and in extension  the  cluster.  When
         using un-secure distributed nodes, make sure that the network is configured to keep potential attackers
         out.

       -start_epmd true | false
         Specifies  whether  Erlang  should start epmd on startup. By default this is <u>true</u>, but if you prefer to
         start epmd manually, set this to <u>false</u>.

         This only applies if Erlang is started as a distributed node, i.e. if <u>-name</u>  or  <u>-sname</u>  is  specified.
         Otherwise, epmd is not started even if <u>-start_epmd</u> <u>true</u> is given.

         Note that a distributed node will fail to start if epmd is not running.

       -version (emulator flag)
         Makes the emulator print its version number. The same as <u>erl</u> <u>+V</u>.

   <b>Emulator</b> <b>Flags</b>
       <u>erl</u>  invokes  the code for the Erlang emulator (virtual machine), which supports the following flags. The
       flags are read from left to right and later flags override the behavior of earlier flags.

       +a size
         Suggested stack size, in kilowords, for threads in the  async  thread  pool.  Valid  range  is  16-8192
         kilowords.  The  default  suggested  stack  size  is  16  kilowords,  that  is,  64  kilobyte on 32-bit
         architectures. This small default size has been chosen because the  number  of  async  threads  can  be
         large.  The default size is enough for drivers delivered with Erlang/OTP, but might not be large enough
         for other dynamically linked-in drivers that use the  <u>driver_async()</u>  functionality.  Notice  that  the
         value passed is only a suggestion, and it can even be ignored on some platforms.

       +A size
         Sets  the  number of threads in async thread pool. Valid range is 1-1024. The async thread pool is used
         by linked-in drivers to handle work that may  take  a  very  long  time.  Since  OTP  21,  the  default
         Erlang/OTP  distribution  includes  few  linked-in drivers that use the async thread pool. Most of them
         have been migrated to dirty IO schedulers. Defaults to 1.

       +B [c | d | i]
         Option <u>c</u> makes <u>Ctrl-C</u> interrupt the current shell instead  of  invoking  the  emulator  break  handler.
         Option <u>d</u> (same as specifying <u>+B</u> without an extra option) disables the break handler. Option <u>i</u> makes the
         emulator ignore any break signal.

         If  option <u>c</u> is used with <u>oldshell</u> on Unix, <u>Ctrl-C</u> will restart the shell process rather than interrupt
         it.

       +c true | false
         Enables or disables time correction:

         true
           Enables time correction. This is the  default  if  time  correction  is  supported  on  the  specific
           platform.

         false
           Disables time correction.

         For backward compatibility, the boolean value can be omitted. This is interpreted as <u>+c</u> <u>false</u>.

       +C no_time_warp | single_time_warp | multi_time_warp
         Sets time warp mode:

         no_time_warp
           No time warp mode (the default)

         single_time_warp
           Single time warp mode

         multi_time_warp
           Multi-time warp mode

       +d
         If  the  emulator  detects  an internal error (or runs out of memory), it, by default, generates both a
         crash dump and a core dump. The core dump is, however, not very useful as the content of process  heaps
         is destroyed by the crash dump generation.

         Option  <u>+d</u> instructs the emulator to produce only a core dump and no crash dump if an internal error is
         detected.

         Calling <u>erlang:halt/1</u> with a string argument still produces a crash dump. On Unix systems,  sending  an
         emulator process a <u>SIGUSR1</u> signal also forces a crash dump.

       +dcg DecentralizedCounterGroupsLimit
         Limits  the  number of decentralized counter groups used by decentralized counters optimized for update
         operations in the Erlang runtime system. By default, the limit is 256.

         When the number of schedulers is less than or equal to the limit, each scheduler  has  its  own  group.
         When  the  number of schedulers is larger than the groups limit, schedulers share groups. Shared groups
         degrade the performance for updating counters while many reader  groups  degrade  the  performance  for
         reading counters. So, the limit is a tradeoff between performance for update operations and performance
         for read operations. Each group consumes 64 bytes in each counter.

         Note  that  a  runtime  system  using  decentralized counter groups benefits from binding schedulers to
         logical processors, as the groups are distributed better between schedulers with this option.

         This option only affects decentralized counters used for the counters that are  keeping  track  of  the
         memory consumption and the number of terms in ETS tables of type ordered_set with the write_concurrency
         option activated.

       +e Number
         Sets the maximum number of ETS tables. This limit is partially obsolete.

       +ec
         Forces option <u>compressed</u> on all ETS tables. Only intended for test and evaluation.

       +fnl
         The  virtual  machine  works  with  filenames  as  if  they are encoded using the ISO Latin-1 encoding,
         disallowing Unicode characters with code points &gt; 255.

         For more information about Unicode filenames, see section Unicode Filenames in the STDLIB User's Guide.
         Notice that this value also applies to command-line parameters and environment variables  (see  section
         Unicode in Environment and Parameters in the STDLIB User's Guide).

       +fnu[{w|i|e}]
         The  virtual  machine  works  with  filenames as if they are encoded using UTF-8 (or some other system-
         specific Unicode encoding). This is the default on operating systems  that  enforce  Unicode  encoding,
         that is, Windows MacOS X and Android.

         The  <u>+fnu</u>  switch  can  be  followed  by  <u>w</u>, <u>i</u>, or <u>e</u> to control how wrongly encoded filenames are to be
         reported:

         •   <u>w</u> means that a warning is sent to the <u>error_logger</u> whenever a wrongly encoded filename is "skipped"
             in directory listings. This is the default.

         •   <u>i</u> means that those wrongly encoded filenames are silently ignored.

         •   <u>e</u> means that the API function returns an error whenever a wrongly encoded  filename  (or  directory
             name) is encountered.

         Notice that <u>file:read_link/1</u> always returns an error if the link points to an invalid filename.

         For more information about Unicode filenames, see section Unicode Filenames in the STDLIB User's Guide.
         Notice  that  this value also applies to command-line parameters and environment variables (see section
         Unicode in Environment and Parameters in the STDLIB User's Guide).

       +fna[{w|i|e}]
         Selection between <u>+fnl</u> and <u>+fnu</u> is done based on the current locale settings in the OS. This means that
         if you have set your terminal for UTF-8 encoding, the filesystem is expected to use the  same  encoding
         for filenames. This is the default on all operating systems, except Android, MacOS X and Windows.

         The  <u>+fna</u>  switch  can  be  followed  by  <u>w</u>,  <u>i</u>, or <u>e</u>. This has effect if the locale settings cause the
         behavior of <u>+fnu</u> to be selected; see the description of <u>+fnu</u> above. If the locale  settings  cause  the
         behavior of <u>+fnl</u> to be selected, then <u>w</u>, <u>i</u>, or <u>e</u> have no effect.

         For more information about Unicode filenames, see section Unicode Filenames in the STDLIB User's Guide.
         Notice  that  this value also applies to command-line parameters and environment variables (see section
         Unicode in Environment and Parameters in the STDLIB User's Guide).

       +hms Size
         Sets the default heap size of processes to the size <u>Size</u> words.

       +hmbs Size
         Sets the default binary virtual heap size of processes to the size <u>Size</u> words.

       +hmax Size
         Sets the default maximum heap size of processes to the size <u>Size</u> words. Defaults to <u>0</u>, which means that
         no maximum heap size is used. For more information, see <u>process_flag(max_heap_size,</u> <u>MaxHeapSize)</u>.

       +hmaxel true|false
         Sets whether to send an error logger message or not for  processes  reaching  the  maximum  heap  size.
         Defaults to <u>true</u>. For more information, see <u>process_flag(max_heap_size,</u> <u>MaxHeapSize)</u>.

       +hmaxib true|false
         Sets  whether  to  include the size of shared off-heap binaries in the sum compared against the maximum
         heap size. Defaults to <u>false</u>. For more information, see <u>process_flag(max_heap_size,</u> <u>MaxHeapSize)</u>.

       +hmaxk true|false
         Sets whether to kill processes reaching the maximum heap  size  or  not.  Default  to  <u>true</u>.  For  more
         information, see <u>process_flag(max_heap_size,</u> <u>MaxHeapSize)</u>.

       +hpds Size
         Sets the initial process dictionary size of processes to the size <u>Size</u>.

       +hmqd off_heap|on_heap
         Sets  the  default  value  of the <u>message_queue_data</u> process flag. Defaults to <u>on_heap</u>. If <u>+hmqd</u> is not
         passed, <u>on_heap</u> will be the default. For more information, see <u>process_flag(message_queue_data,</u> <u>MQD)</u>.

       +IOp PollSets
         Sets the number of IO pollsets to use when polling for I/O. This option is only used on platforms  that
         support  concurrent  updates  of  a  pollset, otherwise the same number of pollsets are used as IO poll
         threads. The default is 1.

       +IOt PollThreads
         Sets the number of IO poll threads to use when polling for I/O. The  maximum  number  of  poll  threads
         allowed is 1024. The default is 1.

         A good way to check if more IO poll threads are needed is to use microstate accounting and see what the
         load of the IO poll thread is. If it is high it could be a good idea to add more threads.

       +IOPp PollSetsPercentage
         Similar to <u>+IOp</u> but uses percentages to set the number of IO pollsets to create, based on the number of
         poll threads configured. If both <u>+IOPp</u> and <u>+IOp</u> are used, <u>+IOPp</u> is ignored.

       +IOPt PollThreadsPercentage
         Similar  to  <u>+IOt</u>  but  uses  percentages  to set the number of IO poll threads to create, based on the
         number of schedulers configured. If both <u>+IOPt</u> and <u>+IOt</u> are used, <u>+IOPt</u> is ignored.

       +IOs true|false
         Enable or disable scheduler thread poll optimization. Default is <u>true</u>.

         If enabled, file descriptors that are frequently read may  be  moved  to  a  special  pollset  used  by
         scheduler  threads.  The objective is to reduce the number of system calls and thereby CPU load, but it
         can in some cases increase scheduling latency for individual file descriptor input events.

       +JPcover true|false|function|function_counters|line|line_counters
         Since: OTP 27.0

         Enables or disables support for coverage when running with the JIT. Defaults to false.

         function
           All modules that are loaded will be instrumented to keep  track  of  which  functions  are  executed.
           Information   about   which   functions   that  have  been  executed  can  be  retrieved  by  calling
           <u>code:get_coverage(function,</u> <u>Module)</u>.

         function_counters
           All modules that are loaded will be instrumented to count how many times each function  is  executed.
           Information  about  how  many  times  each  function  has  been  executed can be retrieved by calling
           <u>code:get_coverage(function,</u> <u>Module)</u>.

         line
           When modules that have been  compiled  with  the  <u>line_coverage</u>  option  are  loaded,  they  will  be
           instrumented to keep track of which lines have been executed. Information about which lines have been
           executed  can  be  retrieved  by calling <u>code:get_coverage(line,</u> <u>Module)</u>, and information about which
           functions that have been executed can be retrieved by calling <u>code:get_coverage(function,</u> <u>Module)</u>.

         line_counters
           When modules that have been  compiled  with  the  <u>line_coverage</u>  option  are  loaded,  they  will  be
           instrumented  to  count  the  number of times each line is executed. Information about how many times
           each line has been  executed  can  be  retrieved  by  calling  <u>code:get_coverage(line,</u>  <u>Module)</u>,  and
           information   about   which   functions   that  have  been  executed  can  be  retrieved  by  calling
           <u>code:get_coverage(function,</u> <u>Module)</u> (note that in this mode, counters for the number  of  times  each
           function has been executed <b>cannot</b> be retrieved).

         true
           Same as <u>line_counters</u>.

         false
           Disables coverage.

       +JPperf true|false|dump|map|fp|no_fp
         Enables  or  disables  support  for  the  <u>perf</u> profiler when running with the JIT on Linux. Defaults to
         false.

         This option can be combined multiple times to enable several options:

         dump
           Gives <u>perf</u> detailed line information, so that the <u>perf</u> <u>annotate</u> feature works.

         map
           Gives <u>perf</u> a map over all module code, letting it translate machine code addresses to  Erlang  source
           code  locations.  This  also  enables  frame  pointers for Erlang code so that <u>perf</u> can walk the call
           stacks of Erlang processes, which costs one extra word per stack frame.

         fp
           Enables frame pointers independently of the <u>map</u> option.

         no_fp
           Disables the frame pointers added by the <u>map</u> option.

         true
           Enables <u>map</u> and <u>dump</u>.

         false
           Disables all other options.

         For more details about how  to  run  perf  see  the  perf  support  section  in  the  BeamAsm  internal
         documentation.

       +JMsingle true|false
         Since: OTP-26.0

         Enables  or  disables  the  use  of single-mapped RWX memory for JIT code. The default is to map JIT:ed
         machine code into two regions sharing the same physical pages, where one region is executable  but  not
         writable,  and  the other writable but not executable. As some tools, such as QEMU user mode emulation,
         cannot deal with the dual mapping, this flags allows it to be  disabled.  This  flag  is  automatically
         enabled by the <u>+JPperf</u> flag.

       +L
         Prevents  loading  information  about  source  filenames  and line numbers. This saves some memory, but
         exceptions do not contain information about the filenames and line numbers.

       +MFlag Value
         Memory allocator-specific flags. For more information, see <u><a href="../man3/erts_alloc.3.html">erts_alloc</a>(3)</u>.

       +pad true|false
         Since: OTP 25.3

         The boolean value used with the <u>+pad</u> parameter determines the default value of the  <u>async_dist</u>  process
         flag  of  newly spawned processes. By default, if no <u>+pad</u> command line option is passed, the <u>async_dist</u>
         flag will be set to <u>false</u>.

         The value used in runtime can be inspected by calling <u>erlang:system_info(async_dist)</u>.

        +pc Range
         Sets the range of characters that the system considers printable in  heuristic  detection  of  strings.
         This  typically  affects  the  shell, debugger, and <u>io:format</u> functions (when <u>~tp</u> is used in the format
         string).

         Two values are supported for <u>Range</u>:

         latin1
           The default. Only characters in the ISO Latin-1 range can be considered printable. This means that  a
           character  with  a  code  point  &gt;  255  is never considered printable and that lists containing such
           characters are displayed as lists of integers rather than text strings by tools.

         unicode
           All printable Unicode characters are considered when determining if a  list  of  integers  is  to  be
           displayed  in  string  syntax.  This  can give unexpected results if, for example, your font does not
           cover all Unicode characters.

         See also <u>io:printable_range/0</u> in STDLIB.

        +P Number
         Sets the maximum number of simultaneously existing processes for this system if a <u>Number</u> is  passed  as
         value. Valid range for <u>Number</u> is <u>[1024-134217727]</u>.

         <b>NOTE:</b> The actual maximum chosen may be much larger than the <u>Number</u> passed. Currently the runtime system
         often,  but  not  always,  chooses a value that is a power of 2. This might, however, be changed in the
         future. The actual value chosen can be checked by calling erlang:system_info(process_limit).

         The default value is <u>1048576</u>

        +Q Number
         Sets the maximum number of simultaneously existing ports for this system  if  a  Number  is  passed  as
         value. Valid range for <u>Number</u> is <u>[1024-134217727]</u>.

         <b>NOTE:</b> The actual maximum chosen may be much larger than the actual <u>Number</u> passed. Currently the runtime
         system  often, but not always, chooses a value that is a power of 2. This might, however, be changed in
         the future. The actual value chosen can be checked by calling <u>erlang:system_info(port_limit)</u>.

         The default value used is normally <u>65536</u>. However, if the runtime system is able to  determine  maximum
         amount  of  file descriptors that it is allowed to open and this value is larger than <u>65536</u>, the chosen
         value will increased to a value larger or equal to the maximum amount of file descriptors that  can  be
         opened.

         On  Windows the default value is set to <u>8196</u> because the normal OS limitations are set higher than most
         machines can handle.

       +R ReleaseNumber
         Sets the compatibility mode.

         The distribution mechanism is not backward compatible by  default.  This  flag  sets  the  emulator  in
         compatibility  mode with an earlier Erlang/OTP release <u>ReleaseNumber</u>. The release number must be in the
         range <u>&lt;current</u> <u>release&gt;-2</u> through <u>&lt;current</u> <u>release&gt;</u>. This limits the emulator, making it  possible  for
         it to communicate with Erlang nodes (as well as C and Java nodes) running that earlier release.

         <b>NOTE:</b> Ensure that all nodes (Erlang-, C-, and Java nodes) of a distributed Erlang system is of the same
         Erlang/OTP  release,  or  from  two  different  Erlang/OTP  releases  X  and  Y, where <u>all</u> Y nodes have
         compatibility mode X.

       +r
         Forces ETS memory blocks to be moved on reallocation.

       +rg ReaderGroupsLimit
         Limits the number of reader groups used by read/write locks optimized for read operations in the Erlang
         runtime system. By default the reader groups limit is 64.

         When the number of schedulers is less than or equal to the reader groups limit, each scheduler has  its
         own  reader  group.  When  the  number of schedulers is larger than the reader groups limit, schedulers
         share reader groups. Shared reader groups degrade read lock and  read  unlock  performance  while  many
         reader  groups degrade write lock performance. So, the limit is a tradeoff between performance for read
         operations and performance for write operations. Each reader group consumes 64 byte in each  read/write
         lock.

         Notice  that  a  runtime  system using shared reader groups benefits from binding schedulers to logical
         processors, as the reader groups are distributed better between schedulers.

       +S Schedulers:SchedulerOnline
         Sets the number of scheduler threads to create and scheduler threads to set  online.  The  maximum  for
         both values is 1024. If the Erlang runtime system is able to determine the number of logical processors
         configured  and logical processors available, <u>Schedulers</u> defaults to logical processors configured, and
         <u>SchedulersOnline</u> defaults to logical processors available; otherwise the default values are 1.  If  the
         emulator  detects  that  it  is  subject to a CPU quota, the default value for <u>SchedulersOnline</u> will be
         limited accordingly.

         <u>Schedulers</u> can be omitted if <u>:SchedulerOnline</u> is not and conversely. The number  of  schedulers  online
         can be changed at runtime through <u>erlang:system_flag(schedulers_online,</u> <u>SchedulersOnline)</u>.

         If  <u>Schedulers</u>  or <u>SchedulersOnline</u> is specified as a negative number, the value is subtracted from the
         default number of logical processors configured or logical processors available, respectively.

         Specifying value <u>0</u> for <u>Schedulers</u> or  <u>SchedulersOnline</u>  resets  the  number  of  scheduler  threads  or
         scheduler threads online, respectively, to its default value.

       +SP SchedulersPercentage:SchedulersOnlinePercentage
         Similar  to  <u>+S</u> but uses percentages to set the number of scheduler threads to create, based on logical
         processors configured, and scheduler threads to set online,  based  on  logical  processors  available.
         Specified values must be &gt; 0. For example, <u>+SP</u> <u>50:25</u> sets the number of scheduler threads to 50% of the
         logical  processors  configured,  and  the  number  of  scheduler  threads online to 25% of the logical
         processors available. <u>SchedulersPercentage</u> can be omitted if  <u>:SchedulersOnlinePercentage</u>  is  not  and
         conversely.    The    number    of    schedulers   online   can   be   changed   at   runtime   through
         <u>erlang:system_flag(schedulers_online,</u> <u>SchedulersOnline)</u>.

         This option interacts with <u>+S</u> settings. For example, on a system with 8 logical cores configured and  8
         logical cores available, the combination of the options <u>+S</u> <u>4:4</u> <u>+SP</u> <u>50:25</u> (in either order) results in 2
         scheduler threads (50% of 4) and 1 scheduler thread online (25% of 4).

       +SDcpu DirtyCPUSchedulers:DirtyCPUSchedulersOnline
         Sets the number of dirty CPU scheduler threads to create and dirty CPU scheduler threads to set online.
         The  maximum  for  both  values  is  1024, and each value is further limited by the settings for normal
         schedulers:

         •   The number of dirty CPU scheduler threads created cannot exceed  the  number  of  normal  scheduler
             threads created.

         •   The  number  of  dirty  CPU  scheduler  threads online cannot exceed the number of normal scheduler
             threads online.

         For details, see <u>+S</u> and <u>+SP</u>. By default, the number of dirty CPU scheduler threads created  equals  the
         number of normal scheduler threads created, and the number of dirty CPU scheduler threads online equals
         the   number   of   normal   scheduler   threads   online.   <u>DirtyCPUSchedulers</u>   can   be  omitted  if
         <u>:DirtyCPUSchedulersOnline</u> is not and conversely. The number of  dirty  CPU  schedulers  online  can  be
         changed at runtime through <u>erlang:system_flag(dirty_cpu_schedulers_online,</u> <u>DirtyCPUSchedulersOnline)</u>.

         The  amount of dirty CPU schedulers is limited by the amount of normal schedulers in order to limit the
         effect on processes executing on ordinary schedulers. If the amount of dirty CPU schedulers was allowed
         to be unlimited, dirty CPU bound jobs would potentially starve normal jobs.

         Typical users of the dirty CPU schedulers are large garbage collections, json protocol  encode/decoders
         written as nifs and matrix manipulation libraries.

         You  can  use <u>msacc</u> in order to see the current load of the dirty CPU schedulers threads and adjust the
         number used accordingly.

       +SDPcpu DirtyCPUSchedulersPercentage:DirtyCPUSchedulersOnlinePercentage
         Similar to <u>+SDcpu</u> but uses percentages to set the number of dirty CPU scheduler threads to  create  and
         the  number  of  dirty  CPU scheduler threads to set online. Specified values must be &gt; 0. For example,
         <u>+SDPcpu</u> <u>50:25</u> sets the number of  dirty  CPU  scheduler  threads  to  50%  of  the  logical  processors
         configured  and  the  number  of  dirty  CPU  scheduler threads online to 25% of the logical processors
         available. <u>DirtyCPUSchedulersPercentage</u> can be omitted if  <u>:DirtyCPUSchedulersOnlinePercentage</u>  is  not
         and  conversely.  The  number  of  dirty  CPU  schedulers  online  can  be  changed  at runtime through
         <u>erlang:system_flag(dirty_cpu_schedulers_online,</u> <u>DirtyCPUSchedulersOnline)</u>.

         This option interacts with <u>+SDcpu</u> settings. For example, on a system with 8  logical  cores  configured
         and  8  logical  cores  available,  the  combination of the options <u>+SDcpu</u> <u>4:4</u> <u>+SDPcpu</u> <u>50:25</u> (in either
         order) results in 2 dirty CPU scheduler threads (50% of 4) and 1 dirty CPU scheduler thread online (25%
         of 4).

       +SDio DirtyIOSchedulers
         Sets the number of dirty I/O scheduler threads to create. Valid range is 1-1024. By default, the number
         of dirty I/O scheduler threads created is 10.

         The amount of dirty IO schedulers is not limited by the amount of normal schedulers like the amount  of
         dirty CPU schedulers. This since only I/O bound work is expected to execute on dirty I/O schedulers. If
         the  user should schedule CPU bound jobs on dirty I/O schedulers, these jobs might starve ordinary jobs
         executing on ordinary schedulers.

         Typical users of the dirty IO schedulers are reading and writing to files.

         You can use <u>msacc</u> in order to see the current load of the dirty IO schedulers threads  and  adjust  the
         number used accordingly.

       +sFlag Value
         Scheduling specific flags.

         +sbt BindType
           Sets scheduler bind type.

           Schedulers can also be bound using flag <u>+stbt</u>. The only difference between these two flags is how the
           following errors are handled:

           •   Binding of schedulers is not supported on the specific platform.

           •   No  available  CPU  topology. That is, the runtime system was not able to detect the CPU topology
               automatically, and no user-defined CPU topology was set.

           If any of these errors occur when <u>+sbt</u> has been passed, the runtime system prints an  error  message,
           and  refuses  to  start.  If any of these errors occur when <u>+stbt</u> has been passed, the runtime system
           silently ignores the error, and start up using unbound schedulers.

           Valid <u>BindType</u>s:

           u

             <u>unbound</u> - Schedulers are not bound to logical processors, that is,  the  operating  system  decides
             where the scheduler threads execute, and when to migrate them. This is the default.

           ns

             <u>no_spread</u> - Schedulers with close scheduler identifiers are bound as close as possible in hardware.

           ts

             <u>thread_spread</u>  - Thread refers to hardware threads (such as Intel's hyper-threads). Schedulers with
             low scheduler identifiers, are bound to the first hardware thread of  each  core,  then  schedulers
             with higher scheduler identifiers are bound to the second hardware thread of each core,and so on.

           ps

             <u>processor_spread</u>  -  Schedulers  are  spread  like  <u>thread_spread</u>, but also over physical processor
             chips.

           s

             <u>spread</u> - Schedulers are spread as much as possible.

           nnts

             <u>no_node_thread_spread</u> - Like <u>thread_spread</u>, but if multiple Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)  nodes
             exist,  schedulers  are spread over one NUMA node at a time, that is, all logical processors of one
             NUMA node are bound to schedulers in sequence.

           nnps

             <u>no_node_processor_spread</u> - Like <u>processor_spread</u>, but if multiple NUMA nodes exist, schedulers  are
             spread  over one NUMA node at a time, that is, all logical processors of one NUMA node are bound to
             schedulers in sequence.

           tnnps

             <u>thread_no_node_processor_spread</u> - A combination  of  <u>thread_spread</u>,  and  <u>no_node_processor_spread</u>.
             Schedulers  are spread over hardware threads across NUMA nodes, but schedulers are only spread over
             processors internally in one NUMA node at a time.

           db

             <u>default_bind</u> - Binds schedulers the default way. Defaults to <u>thread_no_node_processor_spread</u> (which
             can change in the future).

           Binding of schedulers is only supported on newer Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, and Windows systems.

           If no CPU topology is available when flag <u>+sbt</u> is processed and <u>BindType</u> is any other  type  than  <u>u</u>,
           the runtime system fails to start. CPU topology can be defined using flag <u>+sct</u>. Notice that flag <u>+sct</u>
           can have to be passed before flag <u>+sbt</u> on the command line (if no CPU topology has been automatically
           detected).

           The runtime system does by default <u>not</u> bind schedulers to logical processors.

           <b>NOTE:</b> If the Erlang runtime system is the only operating system process that binds threads to logical
           processors,  this  improves the performance of the runtime system. However, if other operating system
           processes (for example another Erlang runtime system) also bind threads to logical processors,  there
           can  be  a  performance penalty instead. This performance penalty can sometimes be severe. If so, you
           are advised not to bind the schedulers.

           How schedulers are bound matters. For example, in situations when there are fewer  running  processes
           than  schedulers  online,  the  runtime  system  tries  to  migrate  processes to schedulers with low
           scheduler identifiers. The more the schedulers are spread over the hardware, the more  resources  are
           available to the runtime system in such situations.

           <b>NOTE:</b>  If  a scheduler fails to bind, this is often silently ignored, as it is not always possible to
           verify valid logical processor  identifiers.  If  an  error  is  reported,  it  is  reported  to  the
           <u>error_logger</u>.   If   you   want  to  verify  that  the  schedulers  have  bound  as  requested,  call
           <u>erlang:system_info(scheduler_bindings)</u>.

         +sbwt none|very_short|short|medium|long|very_long
           Sets scheduler busy wait threshold. Defaults to <u>medium</u>. The threshold determines how long  schedulers
           are to busy wait when running out of work before going to sleep.

           <b>NOTE:</b> This flag can be removed or changed at any time without prior notice.

         +sbwtdcpu none|very_short|short|medium|long|very_long
           As <u>+sbwt</u> but affects dirty CPU schedulers. Defaults to <u>short</u>.

           <b>NOTE:</b> This flag can be removed or changed at any time without prior notice.

         +sbwtdio none|very_short|short|medium|long|very_long
           As <u>+sbwt</u> but affects dirty IO schedulers. Defaults to <u>short</u>.

           <b>NOTE:</b> This flag can be removed or changed at any time without prior notice.

         +scl true|false
           Enables or disables scheduler compaction of load. By default scheduler compaction of load is enabled.
           When  enabled, load balancing strives for a load distribution, which causes as many scheduler threads
           as possible to be fully loaded (that is, not run out of work). This is accomplished by migrating load
           (for example, runnable processes) into a smaller set of schedulers when schedulers frequently run out
           of work. When disabled, the frequency with which schedulers run out of work is not taken into account
           by the load balancing logic.

           <u>+scl</u> <u>false</u> is similar to <u>+sub</u> <u>true</u>,  but  <u>+sub</u>  <u>true</u>  also  balances  scheduler  utilization  between
           schedulers.

         +sct CpuTopology
           Sets  a user-defined CPU topology. The user-defined CPU topology overrides any automatically detected
           CPU topology. The CPU topology is used when binding schedulers to  logical  processors.  This  option
           must be before <u>+sbt</u> on the command-line.

                  &lt;Id&gt; = integer(); when 0 =&lt; &lt;Id&gt; =&lt; 65535
                  &lt;IdRange&gt; = &lt;Id&gt;-&lt;Id&gt;
                  &lt;IdOrIdRange&gt; = &lt;Id&gt; | &lt;IdRange&gt;
                  &lt;IdList&gt; = &lt;IdOrIdRange&gt;,&lt;IdOrIdRange&gt; | &lt;IdOrIdRange&gt;
                  &lt;LogicalIds&gt; = L&lt;IdList&gt;
                  &lt;ThreadIds&gt; = T&lt;IdList&gt; | t&lt;IdList&gt;
                  &lt;CoreIds&gt; = C&lt;IdList&gt; | c&lt;IdList&gt;
                  &lt;ProcessorIds&gt; = P&lt;IdList&gt; | p&lt;IdList&gt;
                  &lt;NodeIds&gt; = N&lt;IdList&gt; | n&lt;IdList&gt;
                  &lt;IdDefs&gt; = &lt;LogicalIds&gt;&lt;ThreadIds&gt;&lt;CoreIds&gt;&lt;ProcessorIds&gt;&lt;NodeIds&gt; |
                             &lt;LogicalIds&gt;&lt;ThreadIds&gt;&lt;CoreIds&gt;&lt;NodeIds&gt;&lt;ProcessorIds&gt;
                  CpuTopology = &lt;IdDefs&gt;:&lt;IdDefs&gt; | &lt;IdDefs&gt;

           Uppercase  letters  signify real identifiers and lowercase letters signify fake identifiers only used
           for description of the topology. Identifiers passed as real identifiers can be used  by  the  runtime
           system  when  trying  to  access  specific hardware; if they are incorrect the behavior is undefined.
           Faked logical CPU identifiers are not accepted, as there is no point in  defining  the  CPU  topology
           without  real  logical CPU identifiers. Thread, core, processor, and node identifiers can be omitted.
           If omitted, the thread ID defaults to <u>t0</u>, the core ID defaults to <u>c0</u>, the processor  ID  defaults  to
           <u>p0</u>,  and  the  node  ID is left undefined. Either each logical processor must belong to only one NUMA
           node, or no logical processors must belong to any NUMA nodes.

           Both increasing and decreasing <u>&lt;IdRange&gt;</u>s are allowed.

           NUMA node identifiers are system wide. That is, each NUMA node on  the  system  must  have  a  unique
           identifier.  Processor  identifiers are also system wide. Core identifiers are processor wide. Thread
           identifiers are core wide.

           The order of the identifier types implies the hierarchy of the CPU topology. The valid orders are  as
           follows:

           •   <u>&lt;LogicalIds&gt;&lt;ThreadIds&gt;&lt;CoreIds&gt;&lt;ProcessorIds&gt;&lt;NodeIds&gt;</u>,  that  is, thread is part of a core that
               is part of a processor, which is part of a NUMA node.

           •   <u>&lt;LogicalIds&gt;&lt;ThreadIds&gt;&lt;CoreIds&gt;&lt;NodeIds&gt;&lt;ProcessorIds&gt;</u>, that is, thread is part of a  core  that
               is part of a NUMA node, which is part of a processor.

           A  CPU  topology can consist of both processor external, and processor internal NUMA nodes as long as
           each logical processor belongs to only one NUMA node.  If  <u>&lt;ProcessorIds&gt;</u>  is  omitted,  its  default
           position is before <u>&lt;NodeIds&gt;</u>. That is, the default is processor external NUMA nodes.

           If a list of identifiers is used in an <u>&lt;IdDefs&gt;</u>:

           •   <u>&lt;LogicalIds&gt;</u> must be a list of identifiers.

           •   At least one other identifier type besides <u>&lt;LogicalIds&gt;</u> must also have a list of identifiers.

           •   All lists of identifiers must produce the same number of identifiers.

           A simple example. A single quad core processor can be described as follows:

                  % erl +sct L0-3c0-3
                  1&gt; erlang:system_info(cpu_topology).
                  [{processor,[{core,{logical,0}},
                               {core,{logical,1}},
                               {core,{logical,2}},
                               {core,{logical,3}}]}]

           A  more  complicated  example with two quad core processors, each processor in its own NUMA node. The
           ordering of logical processors is a bit weird. This to give a better example of identifier lists:

                  % erl +sct L0-1,3-2c0-3p0N0:L7,4,6-5c0-3p1N1
                  1&gt; erlang:system_info(cpu_topology).
                  [{node,[{processor,[{core,{logical,0}},
                                      {core,{logical,1}},
                                      {core,{logical,3}},
                                      {core,{logical,2}}]}]},
                   {node,[{processor,[{core,{logical,7}},
                                      {core,{logical,4}},
                                      {core,{logical,6}},
                                      {core,{logical,5}}]}]}]

           As long as real identifiers are correct, it is OK to pass a  CPU  topology  that  is  not  a  correct
           description  of  the  CPU  topology.  When  used with care this can be very useful. This to trick the
           emulator to bind its schedulers as you want. For example, if you want to run multiple Erlang  runtime
           systems  on the same machine, you want to reduce the number of schedulers used and manipulate the CPU
           topology so that they bind to different logical CPUs. An example, with two Erlang runtime systems  on
           a quad core machine:

                  % erl +sct L0-3c0-3 +sbt db +S3:2 -detached -noinput -noshell -sname one
                  % erl +sct L3-0c0-3 +sbt db +S3:2 -detached -noinput -noshell -sname two

           In  this example, each runtime system have two schedulers each online, and all schedulers online will
           run on different cores. If we change to one  scheduler  online  on  one  runtime  system,  and  three
           schedulers online on the other, all schedulers online will still run on different cores.

           Notice that a faked CPU topology that does not reflect how the real CPU topology looks like is likely
           to decrease the performance of the runtime system.

           For more information, see <u>erlang:system_info(cpu_topology)</u>.

         +ssrct
           Skips reading CPU topology.

           <b>NOTE:</b>  Reading  CPU  topology  slows  down  startup  when starting many parallel instances of ERTS on
           systems with large amount of cores; using this flag might speed up execution in such scenarios.

         +sfwi Interval
           Sets scheduler-forced wakeup interval. All run queues are scanned each <u>Interval</u>  milliseconds.  While
           there  are  sleeping  schedulers  in  the system, one scheduler is woken for each non-empty run queue
           found. <u>Interval</u> default to <u>0</u>, meaning this feature is disabled.

           <b>NOTE:</b> This feature has been introduced as a temporary workaround for long-executing native code,  and
           native code that does not bump reductions properly in OTP. When these bugs have been fixed, this flag
           will be removed.

         +spp Bool
           Sets  default scheduler hint for port parallelism. If set to <u>true</u>, the virtual machine schedules port
           tasks when it improves parallelism in the system. If set to  <u>false</u>,  the  virtual  machine  tries  to
           perform  port  tasks  immediately, improving latency at the expense of parallelism. Default to <u>false</u>.
           The default used can be inspected in runtime  by  calling  <u>erlang:system_info(port_parallelism)</u>.  The
           default can be overridden on port creation by passing option <u>parallelism</u> to <u>erlang:open_port/2</u>.

         +sss size
           Suggested  stack  size,  in  kilowords,  for scheduler threads. Valid range is 20-8192 kilowords. The
           default suggested stack size is 128 kilowords.

         +sssdcpu size
           Suggested stack size, in  kilowords,  for  dirty  CPU  scheduler  threads.  Valid  range  is  20-8192
           kilowords. The default suggested stack size is 40 kilowords.

         +sssdio size
           Suggested stack size, in kilowords, for dirty IO scheduler threads. Valid range is 20-8192 kilowords.
           The default suggested stack size is 40 kilowords.

         +stbt BindType
           Tries  to  set the scheduler bind type. The same as flag <u>+sbt</u> except how some errors are handled. For
           more information, see <u>+sbt</u>.

         +sub true|false
           Enables or disables scheduler  utilization  balancing  of  load.  By  default  scheduler  utilization
           balancing  is  disabled and instead scheduler compaction of load is enabled, which strives for a load
           distribution that causes as many scheduler threads as possible to be fully loaded (that is,  not  run
           out  of  work).  When scheduler utilization balancing is enabled, the system instead tries to balance
           scheduler utilization between schedulers. That is, strive for  equal  scheduler  utilization  on  all
           schedulers.

           <u>+sub</u>  <u>true</u>  is  only  supported  on systems where the runtime system detects and uses a monotonically
           increasing high-resolution clock. On other systems, the runtime system fails to start.

           <u>+sub</u> <u>true</u> implies <u>+scl</u> <u>false</u>. The difference between <u>+sub</u> <u>true</u> and <u>+scl</u> <u>false</u> is that <u>+scl</u> <u>false</u> does
           not try to balance the scheduler utilization.

         +swct very_eager|eager|medium|lazy|very_lazy
           Sets scheduler wake cleanup threshold. Defaults to <u>medium</u>. Controls how eager schedulers  are  to  be
           requesting  wakeup  because  of  certain  cleanup  operations.  When  a  lazy  setting  is used, more
           outstanding cleanup operations can be left undone while a scheduler is idling. When an eager  setting
           is used, schedulers are more frequently woken, potentially increasing CPU-utilization.

           <b>NOTE:</b> This flag can be removed or changed at any time without prior notice.

         +sws default|legacy
           Sets  scheduler  wakeup  strategy.  Default  strategy  changed  in  ERTS 5.10 (Erlang/OTP R16A). This
           strategy was known as <u>proposal</u> in Erlang/OTP R15. The <u>legacy</u> strategy was used as default from R13 up
           to and including R15.

           <b>NOTE:</b> This flag can be removed or changed at any time without prior notice.

         +swt very_low|low|medium|high|very_high
           Sets scheduler wakeup threshold. Defaults to  <u>medium</u>.  The  threshold  determines  when  to  wake  up
           sleeping  schedulers  when  more work than can be handled by currently awake schedulers exists. A low
           threshold causes earlier wakeups, and a high threshold causes later wakeups. Early wakeups distribute
           work over multiple schedulers faster, but work does more easily bounce between schedulers.

           <b>NOTE:</b> This flag can be removed or changed at any time without prior notice.

         +swtdcpu very_low|low|medium|high|very_high
           As <u>+swt</u> but affects dirty CPU schedulers. Defaults to <u>medium</u>.

           <b>NOTE:</b> This flag can be removed or changed at any time without prior notice.

         +swtdio very_low|low|medium|high|very_high
           As <u>+swt</u> but affects dirty IO schedulers. Defaults to <u>medium</u>.

           <b>NOTE:</b> This flag can be removed or changed at any time without prior notice.

       +t size
         Sets the maximum number of atoms the virtual machine can handle. Defaults to 1,048,576.

       +T Level
         Enables modified timing and sets the modified timing level. Valid range  is  0-9.  The  timing  of  the
         runtime  system  is changed. A high level usually means a greater change than a low level. Changing the
         timing can be very useful for finding timing-related bugs.

         Modified timing affects the following:

         Process spawning
           A process calling <u>spawn</u>, <u>spawn_link</u>, <u>spawn_monitor</u>, or <u>spawn_opt</u> is scheduled out  immediately  after
           completing  the call. When higher modified timing levels are used, the caller also sleeps for a while
           after it is scheduled out.

         Context reductions
           The number of reductions a process is allowed to use before it  is  scheduled  out  is  increased  or
           reduced.

         Input reductions
           The number of reductions performed before checking I/O is increased or reduced.

         <b>NOTE:</b>  Performance  suffers when modified timing is enabled. This flag is <u>only</u> intended for testing and
         debugging. <u>return_to</u> and <u>return_from</u> trace messages are lost when tracing on the spawn BIFs. This  flag
         can be removed or changed at any time without prior notice.

       +v
         Verbose.

       +V
         Makes the emulator print its version number.

       +W w | i | e
         Sets  the  mapping of warning messages for <u>error_logger</u>. Messages sent to the error logger using one of
         the warning routines can be mapped to errors (<u>+W</u> <u>e</u>), warnings (<u>+W</u> <u>w</u>), or information  reports  (<u>+W</u>  <u>i</u>).
         Defaults  to  warnings. The current mapping can be retrieved using <u>error_logger:warning_map/0</u>. For more
         information, see <u>error_logger:warning_map/0</u> in Kernel.

       +zFlag Value
         Miscellaneous flags:

         +zdbbl size
           Sets the distribution  buffer  busy  limit  (  <u>dist_buf_busy_limit</u>)  in  kilobytes.  Valid  range  is
           1-2097151. Defaults to 1024.

           A  larger  buffer limit allows processes to buffer more outgoing messages over the distribution. When
           the buffer limit has been reached, sending processes will be suspended  until  the  buffer  size  has
           shrunk.  The  buffer limit is per distribution channel. A higher limit gives lower latency and higher
           throughput at the expense of higher memory use.

           This limit only affects processes that have disabled <u>fully</u> <u>asynchronous</u> <u>distributed</u> <u>signaling</u>.

         +zdntgc time
           Sets the delayed node table garbage collection time ( <u>delayed_node_table_gc</u>) in seconds. Valid values
           are either <u>infinity</u> or an integer in the range 0-100000000. Defaults to 60.

           Node table entries that are not referred linger in the table for at least the  amount  of  time  that
           this  parameter  determines.  The  lingering prevents repeated deletions and insertions in the tables
           from occurring.

         +zosrl limit
           Sets a limit on the amount of outstanding requests made by a system process orchestrating system wide
           changes.     Valid      range      of      this      limit      is      <u>[1,</u>      <u>134217727]</u>.      See
           <u>erlang:system_flag(outstanding_system_requests_limit,</u> <u>Limit)</u> for more information.

         +zhft limit
           Sets  a  limit  on  how long the runtime system is allowed to perform flush operations while halting.
           Valid <u>&lt;timeout&gt;</u> values are integers in the range <u>0..2147483647</u> or the word <u>infinity</u>. <u>&lt;timeout&gt;</u> is  in
           milliseconds and is by default <u>infinity</u>.

           If flushing during a halt operation has been ongoing for <u>&lt;timeout&gt;</u> milliseconds, the flushing will be
           interrupted  and  the  runtime  system  will be immediately terminated with exit code <u>255</u>. If halting
           without flushing, the <u>&lt;timeout&gt;</u> will have no effect on the system.

           The   value   set    by    this    flag    can    be    read    by    Erlang    code    by    calling
           <u>erlang:system_info(halt_flush_timeout)</u>.

           See  also  the  <u>flush_timeout</u> option of the <u>erlang:halt/2</u> BIF. Note that the shortest timeout of this
           command line argument and the <u>flush_timeout</u> option will be the actual timeout value in effect.

           Since: OTP 27.0

   <b>Environment</b> <b>Variables</b>
       ERL_CRASH_DUMP
         If the emulator needs to write a crash dump, the value of this variable is the filename  of  the  crash
         dump file. If the variable is not set, the name of the crash dump file is <u>erl_crash.dump</u> in the current
         directory.

       ERL_CRASH_DUMP_NICE

         <u>Unix</u>  <u>systems</u>:  If  the emulator needs to write a crash dump, it uses the value of this variable to set
         the nice value for the process, thus lowering its priority. Valid range  is  1-39  (higher  values  are
         replaced with 39). The highest value, 39, gives the process the lowest priority.

       ERL_CRASH_DUMP_SECONDS

         <u>Unix</u> <u>systems</u>: This variable gives the number of seconds that the emulator is allowed to spend writing a
         crash   dump.   When   the   given  number  of  seconds  have  elapsed,  the  emulator  is  terminated.
         ERL_CRASH_DUMP_SECONDS=0
           If the variable is set to <u>0</u> seconds, the runtime system does not even attempt to write the crash dump
           file.  It  only  terminates.  This  is  the  default  if  option  <u>-heart</u>  is  passed   to   <u>erl</u>   and
           <u>ERL_CRASH_DUMP_SECONDS</u> is not set.

         ERL_CRASH_DUMP_SECONDS=S
           If  the variable is set to a positive value <u>S</u>, wait for <u>S</u> seconds to complete the crash dump file and
           then terminates the runtime system with a <u>SIGALRM</u> signal.

         ERL_CRASH_DUMP_SECONDS=-1
           A negative value causes the termination of the runtime system to wait indefinitely  until  the  crash
           dump  file has been completely written. This is the default if option <u>-heart</u> is <u>not</u> passed to <u>erl</u> and
           <u>ERL_CRASH_DUMP_SECONDS</u> is not set.

         See also <u>heart</u>.

       ERL_CRASH_DUMP_BYTES
         This variable sets the maximum size of a crash dump file in bytes. The crash dump will be truncated  if
         this  limit  is  exceeded.  If  the  variable  is not set, no size limit is enforced by default. If the
         variable is set to <u>0</u>, the runtime system does not even attempt to write a crash dump file.

         Introduced in ERTS 8.1.2 (Erlang/OTP 19.2).

       ERL_AFLAGS
         The content of this variable is added to the beginning of the command line for <u>erl</u>.

         Flag <u>-extra</u> is treated in a special way. Its scope ends at the end of the environment variable content.
         Arguments following an <u>-extra</u> flag are moved on the command line into section <u>-extra</u>, that is, the  end
         of the command line following an <u>-extra</u> flag.

       ERL_ZFLAGS and ERL_FLAGS
         The content of these variables are added to the end of the command line for <u>erl</u>.

         Flag <u>-extra</u> is treated in a special way. Its scope ends at the end of the environment variable content.
         Arguments  following an <u>-extra</u> flag are moved on the command line into section <u>-extra</u>, that is, the end
         of the command line following an <u>-extra</u> flag.

       ERL_LIBS
         Contains a list of additional library directories that the code server searches  for  applications  and
         adds to the code path; see <u>code</u>.

       ERL_EPMD_ADDRESS
         Can be set to a comma-separated list of IP addresses, in which case the <u>epmd</u> daemon listens only on the
         specified  address(es) and on the loopback address (which is implicitly added to the list if it has not
         been specified).

       ERL_EPMD_PORT
         Can contain the port number to use when communicating with <u>epmd</u>. The default port works  fine  in  most
         cases. A different port can be specified to allow nodes of independent clusters to co-exist on the same
         host. All nodes in a cluster must use the same <u>epmd</u> port number.

   <b>Signals</b>
       On Unix systems, the Erlang runtime will interpret two types of signals.

       SIGUSR1
         A <u>SIGUSR1</u> signal forces a crash dump.

       SIGTERM
         A <u>SIGTERM</u> will produce a <u>stop</u> message to the <u>init</u> process. This is equivalent to a <u>init:stop/0</u> call.

         Introduced in ERTS 8.3 (Erlang/OTP 19.3)

       The signal <u>SIGUSR2</u> is reserved for internal usage. No other signals are handled.

   <b>Configuration</b>
       The standard Erlang/OTP system can be reconfigured to change the default behavior on startup.

       The .erlang startup file
         When  Erlang/OTP  is started, the system searches for a file named <u>.erlang</u> in the user's home directory
         and then <u>filename:basedir(user_config,</u> <u>"erlang")</u>.

         If an <u>.erlang</u> file is found, it is assumed to contain valid Erlang expressions. These  expressions  are
         evaluated as if they were input to the shell.

         A typical <u>.erlang</u> file contains a set of search paths, for example:

                io:format("executing user profile in $HOME/.erlang\n",[]).
                code:add_path("/home/calvin/test/ebin").
                code:add_path("/home/hobbes/bigappl-1.2/ebin").
                io:format(".erlang rc finished\n",[]).

       •   <b>user_default</b>  and  <b>shell_default</b>  - Functions in the shell that are not prefixed by a module name are
           assumed to be functional  objects  (funs),  built-in  functions  (BIFs),  or  belong  to  the  module
           <u>user_default</u> or <u>shell_default</u>.

           To  include  private  shell  commands,  define  them  in  a module <u>user_default</u> and add the following
           argument as the first line in the <u>.erlang</u> file:

                  code:load_abs("..../user_default").

       erl
         If the contents of <u>.erlang</u> are changed and a private version of <u>user_default</u> is defined, the Erlang/OTP
         environment can be customized. More powerful changes can be made by supplying command-line arguments in
         the startup script <u>erl</u>. For more information, see <u>init</u>.
