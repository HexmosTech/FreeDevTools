</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       erlang-depends - calculates Erlang dependencies

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>erlang-depends</b> [<u>debhelper</u> <u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       erlang-depends is a debhelper-like program that is responsible for generating the substitution variables
       for Erlang-dependent packages.

       The most useful variable is ${erlang:Depends}. It expands into the list of Erlang packages which modules
       are used in the building package. It was introduced in version 1:13.b.1-dfsg-3 of erlang-dev package.

       Also, ${erlang-abi:Depends} substitution adds current erlang ABI virtual package to substvar files. It is
       useful if your package uses C-based extensions which may break in case of ABI changes. It was introduced
       in version 1:11.b.4-4 of erlang-dev package.

       If your package stores precompiled PCRE regexps then it likely requires rebuild when the PCRE library in
       Erlang updates. For those packages ${erlang-pcre:Depends} substitution adds current erlang PCRE virtual
       package to subsstvar files.  It was introduced in version 1:22.1.1+dfsg-2 of erlang-dev.

       If you want to fine tune your package dependencies then you may want to use substvars for all Erlang
       packages you need. Currently they are: ${erlang-base:Depends}, ${erlang-dev:Depends},
       ${erlang-asn1:Depends}, ${erlang-common-test:Depends}, ${erlang-crypto:Depends},
       ${erlang-debugger:Depends}, ${erlang-dialyzer:Depends}, ${erlang-edoc:Depends}, ${erlang-eldap:Depends},
       ${erlang-et:Depends}, ${erlang-eunit:Depends}, ${erlang-ftp:Depends}, ${erlang-inets:Depends},
       ${erlang-megaco:Depends}, ${erlang-mnesia:Depends}, ${erlang-observer:Depends}, ${erlang-odbc:Depends},
       ${erlang-os-mon:Depends}, ${erlang-parsetools:Depends}, ${erlang-public-key:Depends},
       ${erlang-reltool:Depends}, ${erlang-runtime-tools:Depends}, ${erlang-snmp:Depends},
       ${erlang-ssh:Depends}, ${erlang-ssl:Depends}, ${erlang-syntax-tools:Depends}, ${erlang-tftp:Depends},
       ${erlang-tools:Depends}, ${erlang-wx:Depends}, ${erlang-xmerl:Depends}.

       All variables except ${erlang-eldap:Depends}, ${erlang-base:Depends} and ${erlang-dev:Depends} were
       introduced in version 1:13.b-dfsg-2 of erlang-dev package.

       Variable ${erlang-eldap:Depends} was added in version 1:15.b.1-dfsg-1 of erlang-dev package because the
       new eldap application was included to the Erlang distribution.

       Variable ${erlang-docbuilder:Depends} was dropped in version 1:15.b-dfsg-1 of erlang-dev package because
       the docbuilder application was removed from the Erlang distribution.

       Variable ${erlang-inviso:Depends} was dropped in version 1:16.b.1-dfsg-4 of erlang-dev package because
       the inviso application was removed from the Erlang distribution.

       Variable ${erlang-appmon:Depends} was dropped in version 1:17.0-dfsg-3 of erlang-dev package because the
       appmon application was removed from the Erlang distribution.

       Variables ${erlang-pman:Depends}, ${erlang-toolbar:Depends}, ${erlang-tv:Depends} were dropped in version
       1:17.3-dfsg-2 of erlang-dev package because the pman, toolbar and tv applications were removed from the
       Erlang distribution.

       Variable ${erlang-webtool:Depends} was dropped in version 1:19.0.4+dfsg-1 of erlang-dev package because
       the webtool application was removed from the Erlang distribution.

       Variable ${erlang-test-server:Depends} was dropped in version 1:19.0.5+dfsg-2 of erlang-dev package
       because the test_server application was removed from the Erlang distribution.

       Variables ${erlang-gs:Depends}, ${erlang-percept:Depends}, ${erlang-typer:Depends} were dropped in
       version 1:20.0+dfsg-1 of erlang-dev package because the gs, percept and type applications were removed
       from the Erlang distribution.

       Variables ${erlang-ftp:Depends} and ${erlang-tftp:Depends} were added in version 1:21.0~rc1+dfsg-1 of
       erlang-dev package because the ftp and tftp applications were split out from inets and included to the
       Erlang distribution separately.

       Variables ${erlang-corba:Depends}, ${erlang-ic:Depends} were dropped in version 1:21.0~rc1+dfsg-1 of
       erlang-dev package because the corba and ic applications were removed from the Erlang distribution.

       For compatibility with older versions the variables ${erlang-nox:Depends} and ${erlang-x11:Depends} also
       work (even since the corresponding packages turned into dummy packages).

       If you use this program, your package must build-depend on erlang-dev (&gt;= 1:13.b-dfsg-2). If you want
       your package to use automatic calculation of dependencies then it must build-depend on erlang-dev (&gt;=
       1:13.b.1-dfsg-3).
