</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       backstep - Backstep is a program that draws icons for minimized windows on your desktop.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>backstep</b> [<u>options</u>]<u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Backstep  is  a  program that draws icons for minimized windows on your desktop. It doesn't depend on the
       window manager or on a desktop-drawing program (for example, I use it with Nautilus). It is meant to work
       with window managers that are EWHM compliant. However, I only know for sure that it works  with  Metacity
       and  Xfwm4.  And  I  know  that  it  doesn't work with Fluxbox and that it only partially works with Kwin
       (hopefully this will be corrected soon). I haven't yet tested it with other window managers.

       Drawing icons for minimized windows on the desktop might be considered a step backwards  by  many  people
       (hence the name), but I find it useful to identify minimized windows by position rather than by name.

</pre><h4><b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
       1)  Simple to use. You do not have to configure anything - just run 'backstep'.

       2)   Session management support - at least to the extent that backstep adds itself to the session so that
       it will be started automatically the next time you log in to your desktop environment.

       3)  Grouping. Windows can be grouped together (by right clicking on their icons and selecting a group) so
       that when one window from the group is shown or hidden, all windows in the group are shown or hidden.

       4)  Configurable. You can make some adjustments to the way the icons look. This is done through a  simple
       configuration dialog launched by right-clicking on an icon.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
