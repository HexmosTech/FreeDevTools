</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       viewmol - a graphical front end for computational chemistry programs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>viewmol</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>viewmol</b>  is a graphical front end for computational chemistry programs.  It is able to graphically aid in
       the generation of molecular structures for computations and to visualize  their  results.  The  program's
       capabilities include:

       • Building and editing of molecules

       • Visualization of the geometry of a molecule

       • Tracing of a geometry optimization or a MD trajectory

       • Animation of normal vibrations or to show them as arrows

       • Drawing of IR, Raman, and inelastic neutron scattering spectra

       • Drawing of an MO energy level or density of states diagram

       • Drawing of basis functions, molecular orbitals, and electron densities

       • Display of forces acting on each atom in a certain configuration

       • Display of Miller planes in crystals

       • Calculation of thermodynamic properties for molecules andreactions

       • Drawings generated by <b>viewmol</b> can be saved as TIFF, HPGL, or PostScript files

       • Animations of normal modes can be converted to a video file (MPEG), e. g. for inclusion into World Wide
         Web documents (requires additional programs available on the Internet)

       • Interface  to the freeware ray tracing program <b>RAYSHADE</b> (input file generation and use of <b>RAYSHADE</b> from
         within <b>viewmol</b>)

       • Input and output in a variety of formats, new formats can be added easily by the user <b>viewmol</b>  includes
         a Python interpreter for automation.

       At  present  <b>viewmol</b>  includes  input  filters  for <b>DISCOVER</b>, <b>DMOL</b>, <b>GAMESS</b>, <b>GAUSSIAN</b> <b>9X</b>, <b>GULP</b>, <b>MOPAC</b>, and
       <b>TURBOMOLE</b> outputs as well as for PDB files (<b>viewmol</b> is therefore suited as a viewer for  structural  data
       on  the  World  Wide  Web). Structures can be saved as MSI car-files, MDL files, and <b>TURBOMOLE</b> coordinate
       files. <b>viewmol</b>'s file format has been added to <b>BABEL</b> so that <b>BABEL</b> can serve as an input as  well  as  an
       output filter for coordinates.

       <b>viewmol</b> supports a space ball as input device.

       The  support  programs  for  converting  to and from the various coordinate file types may potentially be
       useful as stand alone utilities. They are split between /usr/share/viewmol (scripts) and /usr/lib/viewmol
       (C binaries), but individual documentation for them is not available.
