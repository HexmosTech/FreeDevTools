</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       acknowledge.cgi - Xymon CGI script to acknowledge alerts

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>acknowledge.cgi?ACTION=action&amp;NUMBER=acknum&amp;DELAY=validity&amp;MESSAGE=text</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>acknowledge.cgi</b> is invoked as a CGI script via the acknowledge.sh CGI wrapper.

       acknowledge.cgi  is passed a QUERY_STRING environment variable with the ACTION, NUMBER, DELAY and MESSAGE
       parameters.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       ACTION is the action to perform. The only supported action is "Ack" to acknowledge an alert.

       NUMBER is the number identifying the host/service to be acknowledged.   It  is  included  in  all  alert-
       messages sent out by Xymon.

       DELAY is the time (in minutes) that the acknowledge is valid.

       MESSAGE  is  an  optional text which will be shown on the status page while the acknowledgment is active.
       You can use it to e.g. tell users not to contact you about the problem, or inform them when  the  problem
       is expected to be resolved.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --no-pin
              acknowledge.cgi  normally  requires the user to enter the acknowledgment code received in an alert
              message. If you run it with this option, the user will instead get a list of the current non-green
              statuses, and he may send an acknowledge without knowing the code.

       --no-cookies
              Normally, acknowledge.cgi uses a cookie sent by the browser to initially filter the list of  hosts
              presented. If this is not desired, you can turn off this behaviour by calling acknowledge.cgi with
              the   --no-cookies  option.  This  would  normally  be  placed  in  the  CGI_ACK_OPTS  setting  in
              <u><a href="../man5/cgioptions.cfg.5.html">cgioptions.cfg</a>(5)</u>

       --env=FILENAME
              Loads the environment defined in FILENAME before executing the CGI script.

       --debug
              Enables debugging output.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       $XYMONHOME/web/acknowledge_header
              HTML header file for the generated web page

       $XYMONHOME/web/acknowledge_footer
              HTML footer file for the generated web page

       $XYMONHOME/web/acknowledge_form
              Query form displayed when acknowledge.cgi is called with no parameters.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       XYMONHOME
              Used to locate the template files for the generated web pages.

       QUERY_STRING
              Contains the parameters for the CGI script.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       When using alternate pagesets, hosts will only show up on the acknowledgment page  if  this  is  accessed
       from  the  primary page in which they are defined. So if you have hosts on multiple pages, they will only
       be visible for acknowledging from their main page which is not what you would expect.
