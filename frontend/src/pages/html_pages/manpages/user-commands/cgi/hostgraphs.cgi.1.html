       hostgraphs.cgi - CGI program to show multiple graphs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hostgraph.cgi</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hostgraph.cgi</b> is invoked as a CGI script via the hostgraph.sh CGI wrapper.

       If  no  parameters  are  provided  when  invoked, it will present a form where the user can select a time
       period, one or more hosts, and a set of graphs.

       The parameters selected by the user are passed to a second invocation of hostgraph.cgi, and result  in  a
       webpage showing a list of graph images based on the trend data stored about the hosts.

       If  multiple  graph-types  are  selected, hostgraph.cgi will display a list of graphs, with one graph per
       type.

       If multiple hosts are selected, hostgraph.cgi will attempt to display a multi-host graph  for  each  type
       where  the  graphs  for  all  hosts  are overlayed in a single image, allowing for easy comparison of the
       hosts.

       The hostlist uses the PAGEPATH cookie provided by Xymon webpages to select the list of hosts to  present.
       Only the hosts visible on the page where hostgraph.cgi is invoked from will be visible.

       The resulting graph page can be bookmarked, but the bookmark also fixates the time period shown.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --env=FILENAME
              Loads the environment defined in FILENAME before executing the CGI script.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This utility is experimental. It may change in a future release of Xymon.

       It is possible for the user to select graphs which do not exist. This results in broken image links.

       The  set  of graph-types is fixed in the server/web/hostgraphs_form template and does not adjust to which
       graphs are available.

       If the tool is invoked directly, all hosts defined in Xymon will be listed.
