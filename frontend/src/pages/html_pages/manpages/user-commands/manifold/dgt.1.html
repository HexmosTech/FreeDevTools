       dgt - Triangulate a 3-manifold or 4-manifold from a framed link

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dgt</b> { <b>-3,</b> <b>--dim3</b> | <b>-4,</b> <b>--dim4</b> } [ <b>-g,</b> <b>--graph</b> ] [ <b>-r,</b> <b>--real</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This utility builds a triangulation or coloured graph of a 3-manifold or 4-manifold from a framed link.

       For  3-manifolds,  the manifold constructed is the one obtained by performing integer Dehn surgery on the
       given link.

       For 4-manifolds, the manifold constructed is the one obtained by attaching 4-dimensional 2-handles to the
       4-ball along the framed link components.

       When you run <b>DGT</b>, it will ask you to input the underlying (unframed) link  at  the  console.   This  link
       should  be given in the format of a Planar Diagram (PD) code, specifically, in the same format as used by
       <b>SnapPy</b>. The simplest way to achieve this is to draw the link in <b>SnapPy</b>'s <b>PLink</b> editor, and  copy  the  PD
       code generated by <b>SnapPy</b> via the InfoPD Code menu option in the editor.

              <b>Warning:</b> Do not include the PD: text preceding the code generated by the <b>PLink</b> editor in the input
              to  <b>DGT</b>.   Only  copy  and  input  the  code  itself,  which starts at the left square bracket and
              terminates with the right square bracket.

       For more information, see the full <b>DGT</b> manual, available from
        &lt;URL:https://raburke.github.io/&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-3,</b> <b>--dim3</b>
              Build the 3-manifold obtained from integer Dehn surgery on the input link.

              One of <b>--dim3</b> or <b>--dim4</b> must be given as a command-line argument.

       <b>-4,</b> <b>--dim4</b>
              Build the 4-manifold obtained by attaching 2-handles along the components of the  framed  link  to
              the 4-ball.

              One of <b>--dim3</b> or <b>--dim4</b> must be given as a command-line argument.

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--graph</b>
              Output  an edge list of the edge-coloured graph associated to the manifold. Each node of the graph
              corresponds to a tetrahedron in the case of 3-manifolds  or  to  a  pentachoron  in  the  case  of
              4-manifolds.   Two  nodes  are  connected  by  a  <u>c</u>-coloured  edge  if  the two corresponding top-
              dimensional simplices of the triangulation have the facets  opposite  to  the  vertex  labelled  <u>c</u>
              identified.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--real</b>
              For 4-manifolds, this option will build the triangulation with real boundary.

              By  default,  if  the manifold does not have boundary S3, it will be built with ideal boundary. If
              the manifold has boundary S3, then the resulting triangulation will be capped  off  to  produce  a
              closed manifold.

              This  option  will be ignored for 3-manifolds, as all 3-manifolds built from this construction are
              closed.

       The following builds the Poincare homology 3-sphere obtained by +1 surgery along the right handed trefoil
       knot.

           If manifold has (non-spherical) boundary, resulting triangulation will have ideal boundary.
           If manifold has spherical boundary, manifold will be capped off to produce a closed manifold.
