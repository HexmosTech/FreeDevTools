</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       geekcode - generate geek code block

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>geekcode</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       So  you  think  you are a geek, eh? The first step is to admit to yourself your geekiness. No matter what
       anyone says, geeks are people too; geeks have rights. So take a deep breath and  announce  to  the  world
       that you are a geek.  Your courage will give you strength that will last you forever.

       How to tell the world you are a geek, you ask? Use the universal Geek code!  Using this special code will
       allow you to let other un-closeted geeks know who you are in a simple, codified statement.

       The single best way to announce your geekhood is to add your geek code to your signature file or plan and
       announce it far and wide. But be careful, you may give other geeks the courage to come out of the closet.
       You might want to hang on to your copy of the code in order to help them along.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The geek code consists of several categories. Each category is labeled with a letter and some qualifiers.
       Go  through  each category and determine which set of qualifiers best describes you in that category.  By
       stringing all of these 'codes' together, you are able to construct your overall geek  code.  It  is  this
       single line of code that will inform other geeks the world over of what a great geek you actually are.

       Some  of  the  qualifiers  will  very probably not match with you exactly.  It is impossible to cover all
       possibilities in each category. Simply choose that qualifier that most closely matches  you.  Also,  some
       activities  described  in a specific qualifier you may not engage in, while you do engage in others. Each
       description of each qualifier describes the wide range of activities that apply, so as long as you  match
       with one, you can probably use that qualifier.

       After  you  have  determined  each  of  your  qualifiers, you need to the construct your GEEK CODE BLOCK.
       Instructions are provided on how to do this towards the end of this file.

       Also, pay particular attention to case-sensitivity, there can be a big difference between a <u>w</u> and a W.

</pre><h4><b>Variables</b></h4><pre>
       Geeks can seldom be strictly quantified. To facilitate the fact that within any one category the geek may
       not be able to determine a specific rating, variables have been  designed  to  allow  this  range  to  be
       included.

       <b>@</b>      for  this  variable,  said  trait  is  not  very  rigid,  may  change with time or with individual
              interaction. For example, Geeks who happen to very much enjoy Star Trek: The Next Generation,  but
              dislike the old 60's series might list themselves as <u>t++@</u>.

       <b>()</b>     for  indicating  "cross-overs"  or ranges. Geeks who go from <u>C+</u> to <u>C---</u> depending on the situation
              (i.e. mostly <u>C+</u>) could use <u>C+(---)</u>. <u>@</u> is different from <u>()</u> in that <u>()</u> has finite limits within the
              category, while <u>@</u> ranges all over.

       <b>&gt;</b>      for 'wannabe' ratings. Indicating that while the  geek  is  currently  at  one  rating,  they  are
              striving to reach another.  For example, <u>C++&gt;$</u> indicating a geek that is currently computer savvy,
              but wants to someday make money at it.

       <b>$</b>      Indicates  that this particular category is done for a living.  For example, <u>UL+++$</u> indicates that
              the person utilizes Unix and gets paid for it. Quite a lucky geek, for sure.

       <b>?</b>      Unless stated otherwise within  the  specific  category,  the  <u>?</u>  is  placed  after  the  category
              identifier and indicates that the geek has no knowledge about that specific category. For example,
              a person that has never even heard of Babylon 5, would list their Babylon 5 category as <u>5?</u>

       <b>!</b>      Placed  BEFORE  the  category.  Unless  stated  otherwise,  indicates  that  the person refuses to
              participate in this category. This is unlike the <u>?</u> variable as the <u>?</u> indicates lack of  knowledge,
              while the <u>!</u> indicates stubborn refusal to participate. For example, <u>!E</u> would be a person that just
              plain refuses to have anything to do with Emacs, while <u>E?</u> would be a person that doesn't even know
              what Emacs is.

</pre><h4><b>Types</b> <b>of</b> <b>Geeks</b></h4><pre>
       Geeks  come in many flavors. The flavors relate to the vocation (or, if a student, what they are training
       in) of the particular geek. To start a code, a geek must declare himself or herself to be a geek.  To  do
       this,  we start the code with a "G" to denote "GEEK", followed by one or two letters to denote the geek's
       occupation or field of study.  Multi-talented geeks with more than one vocational training should  denote
       their myriad of talents with a slash between each vocation (example: GCS/MU/TW).

       <b>GB</b>     Geek of Business

       <b>GC</b>     Geek of Classics

       <b>GP</b>     Geek of Philosophy

       <b>GS</b>     Geek of Science (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, etc.)

       <b>GSS</b>    Geek of Social Science (Psychology, Sociology, etc.)

       <b>GTW</b>    Geek of Technical Writing

       <b>GO</b>     Geek  of Other. Some types of geeks deviate from the normal geek activities. This is encouraged as
              true geeks come from all walks of life.

       <b>GU</b>     Geek of 'Undecided'. This is a popular vocation with incoming freshmen.

       <b>G!</b>     Geek of no qualifications. A rather miserable existence, you would think.

       <b>GAT</b>    Geek of All Trades. For those geeks that can do anything and everything. GAT usually precludes the
              use of other vocational descriptors.

</pre><h4><b>Appearance</b></h4><pre>
       They say you never get a second chance to make a first impression.  That seems to be ample  justification
       to  invent  a  time  machine; just to play with the minds of the people that make up these silly sayings.
       Nevertheless, until we completely understand temporal mechanics and can get both a DeLorean  and  a  Flux
       Capacitor  in the same place at the same time at 88 miles an hour, we need to understand that how we look
       is a mark that will effect us for the rest of our lives, or at least until we change clothes.

       The Geek, of course, doesn't believe any of that crap. How we look has little to  do  with  what  we  are
       inside,  and  who  we are as people. Yet, people still want to know what we look like. Thus, this section
       allows you to list out all the relevant traits about what you look like on a normal geeky day.

   <b>Dress</b>
       It is said that "clothes make the man". Well, I understood that I was made by a mommy and  a  daddy  (and
       there's  even a category to describe the process below!). Maybe the people who made up that saying aren't
       being quite that literal...

       <b>d++</b>    I tend to wear conservative dress such as a business suit or worse, a tie.

       <b>d+</b>     Good leisure-wear. Slacks, button-shirt, etc. No jeans, tennis shoes, or t-shirts.

       <b>d</b>      I dress a lot like those found in catalog ads. Bland, boring, without life or meaning.

       <b>d-</b>     I'm usually in jeans and a t-shirt.

       <b>d--</b>    My t-shirts go a step further and have a trendy political message on them.

       <b>d---</b>   Punk dresser, including, but not limited to, torn jeans and shirts, body piercings, and  prominent
              tattoos.

       <b>dx</b>     Cross Dresser

       <b>d?</b>     I have no idea what I am wearing right now, let alone what I wore yesterday.

       <b>!d</b>     No clothing. Quite a fashion statement, don't you think?

       <b>dpu</b>    I  wear  the  same  clothes all the time, no matter the occasion, forgetting to do laundry between
              wearings.

   <b>Shape</b>
       Geeks come in many shapes and sizes. Shape code is divided into two parts. The  first  indicates  height,
       while  the  second  indicates  roundness. Mix each section to fit yourself. Examples include: <u>s:++</u>, <u>s++:</u>,
       <u>s++:--</u>.

       <b>s+++:+++</b>
              I usually have to duck through doors/I take up three movie seats.

       <b>s++:++</b> I'm a basketball/linebacker candidate.

       <b>s+:+</b>   I'm a little taller/rounder than most.

       <b>s:</b>     I'm an average geek

       <b>s-:-</b>   I look up to most people. Everyone tells me to gain a few pounds.

       <b>s--:--</b> I look up to damn near everybody. I tend to have to fight against a strong breeze.

       <b>s---:---</b>
              I take a phone book with me when I go out so I can see to eat dinner. My bones are poking  through
              my skin.

   <b>Age</b>
       The  only way to become a true geek is through practice and experience.  To this end, your age becomes an
       important part of your geekiness. Use the qualifiers below to show your  age  (in  Terran  years).  Also,
       please use BASE 10 numbers.

       In  addition,  if you wish to give your exact age, you can place the number after the 'a' identifier. For
       example: a42

       <b>a+++</b>   60 and up

       <b>a++</b>    50-59

       <b>a+</b>     40-49

       <b>a</b>      30-39

       <b>a-</b>     25-29

       <b>a--</b>    20-24

       <b>a---</b>   15-19

       <b>a----</b>  10-14

       <b>a-----</b> 9 and under (Geek in training?)

       <b>a?</b>     immortal

       <b>!a</b>     it's none of your business how old I am

</pre><h4><b>COMPUTERS</b></h4><pre>
       There is a record of geeks that don't use computers. Unfortunately, they are all dead, having lived in an
       era of no computers. All modern geeks have some exposure to computers. If you don't know what a  computer
       is, you need to go back into your shell.

   <b>Computers</b>
       Most geeks identify themselves by their use of computers and computer networks. In order to quantify your
       geekiness  level  on  computers,  consult  the  following  (consider the term 'computers' synonymous with
       'computer network'). This category represents "general" computer aptitude. Categories below will get into
       specifics.

       <b>C++++</b>  I'll be first in line to get the new cybernetic interface installed into my skull.

       <b>C+++</b>   You mean there is life outside of Internet? You're shittin' me!  I haven't dragged myself to class
              in weeks.

       <b>C++</b>    Computers are a large part of my existence. When I get up in the morning, the first thing I do  is
              log  myself  in.  I  play  games  or  mud  on  weekends,  but still manage to stay off of academic
              probation.

       <b>C+</b>     Computers are fun and I enjoy using them. I play a  mean  game  of  DOOM!   and  can  use  a  word
              processor without resorting to the manual too often. I know that a 3.5" disk is not a hard disk. I
              also  know  that  when it says 'press any key to continue', I don't have to look for a key labeled
              'ANY'.

       <b>C</b>      Computers are a tool, nothing more. I use it when it serves my purpose.

       <b>C-</b>     Anything more complicated than my calculator and I'm screwed.

       <b>C--</b>    Where's the on switch?

       <b>C---</b>   If you even mention computers, I will rip your head off!

</pre><h4><b>UNIX</b></h4><pre>
       It seems that a Unix-based operating system is the OS of choice among most geeks. In addition to  telling
       us about your Unix abilities, you can also show which specific Unix OS you are using. To accomplish this,
       you  include  a  letter showing the brand with your rating. For example: UL++++ would indicate a sysadmin
       running Linux.

       <b>B</b>      BSD (use this unless your BSDish system is mentioned below)

       <b>L</b>      Linux

       <b>U</b>      Ultrix

       <b>A</b>      AIX

       <b>V</b>      SysV

       <b>H</b>      HPUX

       <b>I</b>      IRIX

       <b>O</b>      OSF/1 (aka Digital Unix)

       <b>S</b>      Sun OS/Solaris

       <b>C</b>      SCO Unix

       <b>X</b>      NeXT

       <b>*</b>      Some other one not listed

       <b>U++++</b>  I am the sysadmin. If you try and crack my machine don't  be  surprised  if  the  municipal  works
              department gets an "accidental" computer-generated order to put start a new landfill on your front
              lawn or your quota is reduced to 4K.

       <b>U+++</b>   I  don't  need  to  crack <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> because I just modified su so that it doesn't prompt me. The
              admin staff doesn't even know I'm here. If you don't understand what I just  said,  this  category
              does NOT apply to you!

       <b>U++</b>    I've  get  the  entire  admin  ticked  off at me because I am always using all of the CPU time and
              trying to run programs that I don't have access to. I'm going to  try  cracking  <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>  next
              week, just don't tell anyone.

       <b>U+</b>     I not only have a Unix account, but I slam VMS any chance get.

       <b>U</b>      I have a Unix account to do my stuff in

       <b>U-</b>     I have a VMS account.

       <b>U--</b>    I've seen Unix and didn't like it. DEC rules!

       <b>U---</b>   Unix geeks are actually nerds in disguise.

   <b>Perl</b>
       If  you enjoy at least <u>U++</u> status you have to know about Perl, so you might as well rate yourself in this
       sub-category. Non-Unix geeks don't know what they're missing.

       <b>P+++++</b> I am Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen, or Randal Schwartz.

       <b>P++++</b>  I don't write Perl, I speak it. Perl has superseded all  other  programming  languages.  I  firmly
              believe that all programs can be reduced to a Perl one-liner. I use Perl to achieve <u>U+++</u> status.

       <b>P+++</b>   Perl  is  a very powerful programming tool. Not only do I no longer write shell scripts, I also no
              longer use awk or sed. I use Perl for all programs of less than a thousand lines.

       <b>P++</b>    Perl is a powerful programming tool. I don't write shell scripts anymore because I write  them  in
              Perl.

       <b>P+</b>     I know of Perl. I like Perl. I just haven't learned much Perl, but it is on my agenda.

       <b>P</b>      I know Perl exists, but that's all.

       <b>P-</b>     What's Perl got that awk and sed don't have?

       <b>P--</b>    Perl users are sick, twisted programmers who are just showing off.

       <b>P---</b>   Perl  combines the power of sh, the clarity of sed, and the performance of awk with the simplicity
              of C. It should be banned.

       <b>P!</b>     Our paranoid admin won't let us install Perl! Says it's a "hacking tool".

   <b>Linux</b>
       Linux is a hacker-written operating system virtually identical to Unix. It was written for and  continues
       to  run  on  your  standard  386/486/Pentium PC, but has also been ported to other systems. Because it is
       still a young OS, and because it is continually evolving from hacker changes and support, it is important
       that the geek list his Linux ability.

       <b>L+++++</b> I am Linus, grovel before me.

       <b>L++++</b>  I am a Linux wizard. I munch C code for breakfast and have enough room  left  over  for  a  kernel
              debugging.  I  have  so  many  patches  installed that I lost track about ten versions ago.  Linux
              newbies consider me a net.god.

       <b>L+++</b>   I use Linux exclusively on  my  system.  I  monitor  comp.os.linux.*  and  even  answer  questions
              sometimes.

       <b>L++</b>    I use Linux ALMOST exclusively on my system. I've given up trying to achieve Linux.God status, but
              welcome the OS as a replacement for DOS. I only boot to DOS to play games.

       <b>L+</b>     I've managed to get Linux installed and even used it a few times. It seems like it is just another
              OS.

       <b>L</b>      I know what Linux is, but that's about all

       <b>L-</b>     I  have  no  desire to use Linux and frankly don't give a rats patootie about it. There are other,
              better, operating systems out there. Like Mac, DOS, or Amiga-OS. Or, better  yet  even,  would  be
              another free Unix OS like FreeBSD.

       <b>L--</b>    Unix sucks. Because Linux = Unix. Linux Sucks. I worship Bill Gates.

       <b>L---</b>   I am Bill Gates.

   <b>Emacs</b>
       GNU  Emacs  is  the  do-all be-everything editor/operating system available for just about every computer
       architecture out there.

       <b>E+++</b>   Emacs is my login shell!! M-x doctor is my psychologist! I use emacs to control my TV and  toaster
              oven!  All you vi people don't know what you're missing! I read alt.religion.emacs, alt.sex.emacs,
              and comp.os.emacs.

       <b>E++</b>    I know and use elisp regularly!

       <b>E+</b>     Emacs is great! I read my mail and news with it!

       <b>E</b>      Yeah, I know what emacs is, and use it as my regular editor.

       <b>E-</b>     Emacs is too big and bloated for my tastes

       <b>E--</b>    Emacs is just a fancy word processor

       <b>E---</b>   Emacs sucks! vi forever!!!

       <b>E----</b>  Emacs sucks! pico forever!!!

   <b>World</b> <b>Wide</b> <b>Web</b>
       It's relatively new. It's little understood. Everybody's doing it. How much of a web-surfer are you?

       <b>W+++</b>   I am a WebMaster . Don't even think about trying to view my homepage without the latest version of
              Netscape. When I'm not on my normal net connection, I surf the web using my Newton and a  cellular
              modem.

       <b>W++</b>    I have a homepage. I surf daily. My homepage is advertised in my .signature.

       <b>W+</b>     I have the latest version of Netscape, and wander the web only when there's something specific I'm
              looking for.

       <b>W</b>      I have a browser and a connection. Occasionally I'll use them.

       <b>W-</b>     The  web  is  really a pain. Life was so much easier when you could transfer information by simple
              ASCII. Now everyone won't even consider your ideas  unless  you  spiff  them  up  with  bandwidth-
              consuming pictures and pointless information links.

       <b>W--</b>    A  pox  on  the Web! It wastes time and bandwidth and just gives the uneducated morons a reason to
              clutter the Internet.

   <b>USENET</b> <b>News</b>
       Usenet, a global collection of flaming opinions and senseless babble, was designed as a  way  to  eat  up
       precious spool space on a system's hard drive. It also is a way for people to distribute pornography.

       <b>N++++</b>  I am Tim Pierce

       <b>N+++</b>   I  read  so  many newsgroups that the next batch of news comes in before I finish reading the last
              batch, and I have to read for about 2 hours straight before I'm caught up on the  morning's  news.
              Then there's the afternoon...

       <b>N++</b>    I read all the news in a select handful of groups.

       <b>N+</b>     I read news recreationally when I have some time to kill.

       <b>N</b>      Usenet News? Sure, I read that once

       <b>N-</b>     News is a waste of my time and I avoid it completely

       <b>N--</b>    News sucks! 'Nuff said.

       <b>N---</b>   I work for Time Magazine.

       <b>N----</b>  I am a Scientologist.

       <b>N*</b>     All I do is read news

   <b>USENET</b> <b>Oracle</b>
       (Info  taken  from  the  Usenet Oracle Help File) Throughout the history of mankind, there have been many
       Oracles who have been consulted by many mortals, and some immortals. The great Hercules was told  by  the
       Gelphic  Oracle to serve Eurystheus, king of Mycenae, for twelve years to atone for the murder of his own
       children.  It was the Oracle of Ammon who told King Cepheus to chain his daughter Andromeda to the  rocks
       of  jappa  to  appease  the  terrible  sea  monster that was ravaging the coasts. That solution was never
       tested, though, as Perseus saved the girl in the nick of time.

       With the advent of the electronic age, and especially high-speed e-mail communication, the spirit of  the
       Oracles found a new outlet, and we now recognize another great Oracle, the Usenet Oracle.

       <b>o+++</b>   I was a Priest, but have retired.

       <b>o++</b>    I have made the Best Of Oracularities.

       <b>o+</b>     I have been incarnated at least once.

       <b>o</b>      I've submitted a question, but it has never been incarnated.

   <b>Microsoft</b> <b>Windows</b>
       A good many geeks suffer through the use of various versions of Microsoft's Windows running on  or  as  a
       replacement for DOS. Rate your Windows Geekiness.

       <b>w+++++</b> I am Bill Gates

       <b>w++++</b>  I  have Windows, Windows 95, Windows NT, and Windows NT Advanced Server all running on my SMP RISC
              machine. I haven't seen daylight in six months.

       <b>w+++</b>   I am a MS Windows programming god. I wrote a VxD driver to allow MS Windows and DOS to  share  the
              use of my waffle iron.  P.S. Unix sux.

       <b>w++</b>    I write MS Windows programs in C and think about using C++ someday. I've written at least one DLL.

       <b>w+</b>     I  have installed my own custom sounds, wallpaper, and screen savers so my PC walks and talks like
              a fun house. Oh yeah, I have a hundred TrueType(tm) fonts that I've installed but  never  used.  I
              never lose Minesweeper and Solitaire

       <b>w</b>      Ok, so I use MS Windows, I don't have to like it.

       <b>w-</b>     I'm still trying to install MS Windows and have at least one peripheral that never works right

       <b>w--</b>    MS  Windows  is  a joke operating system. Hell, it's not even an operating system. NT is Not Tough
              enough for me either. 95 is how may times it will crash an hour.

       <b>w---</b>   Windows has set back the computing industry by at least 10 years.  Bill  Gates  should  be  drawn,
              quartered, hung, shot, poisoned, disembowelled, and then REALLY hurt.

   <b>OS/2</b>
       The  operating  system  that  looks  a lot like Windows, acts a lot like Windows, but is much better than
       Windows.

       <b>O+++</b>   I live, eat and breathe OS/2. All of my hard drives are HPFS. I am the Anti-Gates.

       <b>O++</b>    I use OS/2 for all my computing needs. I use some DOS and Windows programs,  but  run  them  under
              OS/2. If the program won't run under OS/2, then obviously I don't need it.

       <b>O+</b>     I keep a DOS partition on my hard drive "just in case". I'm afraid to try HPFS.

       <b>O</b>      I finally managed to get OS/2 installed but wasn't too terribly impressed.

       <b>O-</b>     Tried it, didn't like it.

       <b>O--</b>    I can't even get the thing to install!

       <b>O---</b>   Windows RULES!!! Long live Bill Gates. (See w++++)

       <b>O----</b>  I am Bill Gates of Borg. OS/2 is irrelevant.

   <b>Macintosh</b>
       Many  geeks have abandoned the character-based computer altogether and moved over to the Macintosh. It in
       important to give notification of your Mac rating.

       <b>M++</b>    I am a Mac guru. Anything those DOS putzes and Unix nerds can do, I can do  better,  and  if  not,
              I'll write the damn software to do it.

       <b>M+</b>     A Mac has it's uses and I use it quite often.

       <b>M</b>      I use a Mac, but I'm pretty indifferent about it.

       <b>M-</b>     Macs suck. All real geeks have a character prompt.

       <b>M--</b>    Macs do more than suck. They make a user stupid by allowing them to use the system without knowing
              what they are doing. Mac weenies have lower IQs than the fuzz in my navel.

   <b>VMS</b>
       Many geeks use the VMS operating system by DEC for all of their mainframe and network activity.

       <b>V+++</b>   I  am  a VMS sysadmin. I wield far more power than those UNIX admins, because UNIX can be found on
              any dweeb's desktop. Power through obscurity is my motto.

       <b>V++</b>    Unix is a passing fad compared to the real power in the universe, my VMS system.

       <b>V+</b>     I tend to like VMS better than Unix

       <b>V</b>      I've used VMS.

       <b>V-</b>     Unix is much better than VMS for my computing needs.

       <b>V--</b>    I would rather smash my head repeatedly into a brick wall than suffer the agony  of  working  with
              VMS. It's reminiscent of a dead and decaying pile of moose droppings. Unix rules the universe.

</pre><h4><b>POLITICS</b></h4><pre>
       The last few years has seen the rise of the political geek. This phenomena is little understood, but some
       theorize  that  it  has  come  about because of the popular media's attempts to demonize the Internet and
       computer use in general, and the government's willingness to go along with it. Others  propose  that  the
       aging  geek  population  has simply started taking an interest in the world around them. Some support the
       "Sun Spot" theory.

   <b>Political</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Issues</b>
       We live is a society where everyone not only has a right to, but is expected to, whine and complain about
       everyone else. Rate where, in general, your political views on different social issues fall.

       <b>PS+++</b>  Legalize drugs! Abolish the government. "Fuck the draft!"

       <b>PS++</b>   I give to liberal causes. I march for gay rights. I'm a card carrying member  of  the  ACLU.  Keep
              abortion safe and legal.

       <b>PS+</b>    My  whole  concept  of liberalism is that nobody has the right to tell anybody else what to do, on
              either side of the political fence. If you don't like it, turn the bloody channel.

       <b>PS</b>     I really don't have an opinion; nobody's messing with my freedoms right now.

       <b>PS-</b>    Label records! Keep dirty stuff off the TV and the Internet.

       <b>PS--</b>   Oppose sex education, abortion rights, gay rights. Rush Limbaugh is my spokesman.

       <b>PS---</b>  Repent left-wing sinners and change your wicked evil ways.  Buchanan/Robertson in '96.

   <b>Politics</b> <b>and</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Issues</b>
       Social and economic attitudes are seldom on the same side of the political fence. Of course,  most  geeks
       don't really care much about economics; having no money left after buying new computer toys.

       <b>PE+++</b>  Abolish antitrust legislation. Raise taxes on everyone but the rich so that the money can trickle-
              down to the masses.

       <b>PE++</b>   Keep the government off the backs of businesses. Deregulate as much as possible.

       <b>PE+</b>    Balance the budget with spending cuts and an amendment.

       <b>PE</b>     Distrust both government and business.

       <b>PE-</b>    It's  ok  to  increase government spending, so we can help more poor people. Tax the rich! Cut the
              defense budget!

       <b>PE--</b>   Capitalism is evil! Government should provide the services we really need. Nobody should be rich.

   <b>Cypherpunks</b>
       With the birth of the overused buzzword "The Information Superhighway", concerns over privacy  from  evil
       governmental  bad-guys{tm}  has led to the formation of of an unofficial, loosely organized band of civil
       libertarians who spend much of their time discussing how to ensure privacy  in  the  information  future.
       This  group  is known by some as "cypherpunks" (by others, as anarchistic subversives). To this end, tell
       us how punkish you are.

       <b>Y+++</b>   I am T.C. May

       <b>Y++</b>    I am on the cypherpunks mailing list and active around Usenet.  I never  miss  an  opportunity  to
              talk  about the evils of Clipper and ITAR and the NSA. Orwell's 1984 is more than a story, it is a
              warning to our's and future generations. I'm a member of the EFF.

       <b>Y+</b>     I have an interest and concern in privacy issues, but in reality I am not really all  that  active
              or vocal.

       <b>Y</b>      I'm pretty indifferent on the whole issue.

       <b>Y-</b>     It  seems  to  me that all of these concerns are a little extreme.  I mean, the government must be
              able to protect itself from criminals and the populace from indecent speech.

       <b>Y--</b>    Get a life. The only people that need this kind of protection are people with something to hide. I
              think cypherpunks are just a little paranoid.

       <b>Y---</b>   I am L. Detweiler.

   <b>PGP</b>
       Pretty Good Privacy (aka PGP) is a program available on many platforms that will encrypt  files  so  that
       prying eyes (particularly governmental) can't look at them.

       <b>PGP++++</b>
              I am Philip Zimmerman

       <b>PGP+++</b> I don't send or answer mail that is not encrypted, or at the very least signed. If you are reading
              this without decrypting it first, something is wrong. IT DIDN'T COME FROM ME!

       <b>PGP++</b>  I have the most recent version and use it regularly

       <b>PGP+</b>   "Finger me for my public key"

       <b>PGP</b>    I've used it, but stopped long ago.

       <b>PGP-</b>   I don't have anything to hide.

       <b>PGP--</b>  I  feel  that  the glory of the Internet is in the anarchic, trusting environment that so nurtures
              the exchange of information. Encryption just bogs that down.

       <b>PGP---</b> If you support encryption on the Internet, you must be a drug dealer  or  terrorist  or  something
              like that.

       <b>PGP----</b>
              Oh, here is something you all can use that is better (insert Clipper here).

</pre><h4><b>ENTERTAINMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Geeks  love  to  play.  No  matter  their  age,  all  geeks  enjoy playing. Of course, the object of this
       entertainment takes a myriad of different forms. What is it that pushes a geek to play? Is  it  simply  a
       desire  to  relive  their  childhood?  Or  perhaps  there  is a piece of geeky genetic code that requires
       intellectual stimulation. Who knows, maybe it's a Freudian thing...

   <b>Star</b> <b>Trek</b>
       Most geeks have an undeniable  love  for  the  Star  Trek  television  show  (in  any  of  its  different
       incarnations).  Because  GEEK  is  often  synonymous  with TREKKIE (real geeks aren't so anal as to label
       themselves TREKKER), it is important that all geeks list their Trek rating.

       <b>t+++</b>   It's not just a TV show, it's a religion. I know all about warp field dynamics and the  principles
              behind  the  transporter.  I  have  memorized  the TECH manual. I speak Klingon. I go to cons with
              Vulcan ears on. I have no life.

       <b>t++</b>    It's the best show around. I have all the episodes and the movies on tape  and  can  quote  entire
              scenes verbatim. I've built a few of the model kits too. But you'll never catch me at one of those
              conventions. Those people are kooks.

       <b>t+</b>     It's a damn fine TV show and is one of the only things good on television any more.

       <b>t</b>      It's just another TV show

       <b>t-</b>     Maybe  it  is just me, but I have no idea what the big deal with Star Trek is. Perhaps I'm missing
              something but I just think it is bad drama.

       <b>t--</b>    Star Trek is just another Space Opera. William Shatner isn't an actor, he's a  poser!  And  what's
              with this Jean-Luc Picard? A Frenchman with a British accent? Come on. Isn't Voyager just a rehash
              of  Lost  in Space?  Has Sisko even breathed in the last two seasons? Come on. I'd only watch this
              show if my remote control broke.

       <b>t---</b>   Star Trek SUCKS! It is the worst crap I have ever seen! Hey, all you trekkies  out  there,  GET  A
              LIFE! (William Shatner is a t---)

       <b>t*</b>     I identify with Barclay, the greatest of the Trek Geeks.

   <b>Babylon</b> <b>5</b>
       For  many  years,  Sci-Fi  geeks have wished for a television show that would overcome the limitations of
       Star Trek. For many, a show called Babylon 5 has  met  that  demand,  with  a  deep  storyline,  exciting
       characters and state-of-the-art computer generated effects.

       <b>5++++</b>  I am J. Michael Straczynski

       <b>5+++</b>   I  am a True Worshipper of the Church of Joe who lives eats breathes and thinks Babylon 5, and has
              Evil thoughts about stealing Joe's videotape archives just to see episodes earlier.  I am planning
              to break into the bank and steal the triple-encoded synopsis of the 5-year arc.

       <b>5++</b>    Finally a show that shows what a real future would look like.  None of this Picardian "Let's  talk
              about  it  and  be  friends" crap. And what's this? We finally get to see a bathroom! Over on that
              Enterprise, they've been holding it for over seven years!

       <b>5+</b>     Babylon 5 certainly presents a fresh perspective in the Sci-Fi universe. I watch it weekly.

       <b>5</b>      I've seen it, I am pretty indifferent to it.

       <b>5-</b>     This show is sub-par. The acting is wooden, the special effects are  obviously  poor  quality.  In
              general, it seems like a very cheap Star Trek ripoff.

       <b>5--</b>    You call this Sci-Fi? That is such a load of crap! This show is just a soap with bad actors, piss-
              poor effects, and lame storylines. Puh-leese.

   <b>X-Files</b>
       The Fox Network's Friday evening show The X-Files has become the staple of Friday geekhood. Any show that
       has  aliens,  governmental  conspiracies,  aliens,  psychic  powers, aliens, and other weird stuff is, by
       definition, a geeky show.

       <b>X++++</b>  I am Chris Carter

       <b>X+++</b>   This is the BEST show on TV, and it's about time. I've seen everything David Duchovny and  Gillian
              Anderson  have  ever  done that been recorded and I'm a loyal Duchovny/ Gillian Anderson fan. I've
              Converted at least 10 people. I have every episode at SP, debate the  fine  details  on-line,  and
              have a credit for at least 2 YAXAs.

       <b>X++</b>    This  is  one  of  the  better  shows I've seen. I wish I'd taped everything from the start at SP,
              because I'm wearing out my EP tapes. I'll periodically debate online. I've Converted  at  least  5
              people. I've gotten a YAXA.

       <b>X+</b>     I've Converted my family and watch the show when I remember.  It's really kinda fun.

       <b>X</b>      Ho hum. Just another Fox show.

       <b>X-</b>     It's ok if you like paranoia and conspiracy stories, but, let's face it, it's crap.

       <b>X--</b>    If I wanted to watch this kind of stuff, I'd talk to Oliver Stone

   <b>Role</b> <b>Playing</b>
       Role-playing games such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons have long been a part of the traditional geek life. Because
       geeks  often  become  so involved in their role-playing that they lose touch with reality, include one of
       the following role-playing codes.

       <b>R+++</b>   I've written and published my own gaming materials.

       <b>R++</b>    There is no life outside the role of the die. I know all of piddly rules of  (chosen  game).  _MY_
              own warped rules scare the rest of the players.

       <b>R+</b>     I've got my weekly sessions set up and a character that I know better than I know myself.

       <b>R</b>      Role-Playing? That's just something to do to kill a Saturday afternoon

       <b>R-</b>     Gosh, what an utter waste of time!

       <b>R--</b>    Role-Players are instruments of pure evil.

       <b>R---</b>   I work for T$R.

       <b>R*</b>     I thought life WAS role-playing?

   <b>Television</b>
       Many geeks have lives that revolve around television.

       <b>tv+++</b>  There's  nothing  I  can  experience "out there" that I can't see coming over my satellite dish. I
              wish there were MORE channels.  I live for the O.J. Trial.

       <b>tv++</b>   I just leave the tv on, to make sure I don't miss anything.

       <b>tv+</b>    I watch some tv every day.

       <b>tv</b>     I watch only the shows that are actually worthwhile, such as those found on PBS.

       <b>tv-</b>    I watch tv for the news and 'special programming.'

       <b>tv--</b>   I turn my tv on during natural disasters.

       <b>!tv</b>    I do not own a television.

   <b>Books</b>
       In addition (or maybe on the other hand), many geeks have lives that revolve around books.

       <b>b++++</b>  I read a book a day. I have library cards in three states. I have discount cards from every  major
              bookstore. I've ordered books from another country to get my Favorite Author Fix.

       <b>b+++</b>   I consume a few books a week as part of a staple diet.

       <b>b++</b>    I find the time to get through at least one new book a month.

       <b>b+</b>     I enjoy reading, but don't get the time very often.

       <b>b</b>      I read the newspaper and the occasional book.

       <b>b-</b>     I read when there is no other way to get the information.

       <b>b--</b>    I did not actually READ the geek code, I just had someone tell me.

   <b>Dilbert</b>
       Simply  the  geekiest  comic  strip  in  existence.   <u><a href="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/">http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/</a></u> for more
       information.

       <b>DI+++++</b>
              I am Scott Adams.

       <b>DI++++</b> I've received mail from Scott Adams. I'm in the DNRC (Dogbert's New Ruling Class).

       <b>DI+++</b>  I am a Dilbert prototype

       <b>DI++</b>   I work with people that act a lot like Dilbert and his boss.

       <b>DI+</b>    I read Dilbert daily, often understanding it

       <b>DI</b>     I read Dilbert infrequently, rarely understanding it

       <b>DI-</b>    Is that the comic about the engineers?

       <b>DI--</b>   Don't read it, but I think the dog is kinda cute.

       <b>DI---</b>  I don't think it's funny to make fun of managers trying their best  to  run  their  organizational
              units.

   <b>DOOM!</b>
       There  is  a  game  out for the PCs and other computers called DOOM. It's a 3D virtual reality simulation
       where you race around and blow things away with large-caliber weaponry. This  has  led  to  a  series  of
       similar games such as the Star Wars themed Dark Forces. Tell us about your abilities with these 3D games.
       (yes, some of them aren't actually Doom. Cope!)

       <b>D++++</b>  I work for iD Software.

       <b>D+++</b>   I  crank  out  PWAD files daily, complete with new monsters, weaponry, sounds and maps. I'm a DOOM
              God. I can solve the original maps in nightmare mode with my eyes closed.

       <b>D++</b>    I've played the shareware version and bought the real one and I'm  actually  pretty  good  at  the
              game. I occasionally download PWAD files and play them too.

       <b>D+</b>     It's a fun, action game that is a nice diversion on a lazy afternoon.

       <b>D</b>      I've played the game and I'm pretty indifferent.

       <b>D-</b>     I've played the game and really didn't think it was all that impressive.

       <b>D--</b>    It's an overly-violent game and pure crap

       <b>D---</b>   To hell with Doom, I miss Zork.

       <b>D----</b>  I've seen better on my Atari 2600

   <b>The</b> <b>Geek</b> <b>Code</b>
       <b>G+++++</b> I am Robert Hayden

       <b>G++++</b>  I  have  made  a suggestion for future versions of the code (note that making a suggestion just to
              get a G++++ rating doesn't count, you also have to at least qualify for a G+++ rating :-)

       <b>G+++</b>   I have memorized the entire geek code, and can decode others' codes in my head. I  know  by  heart
              where to find the current version of the code on the net.

       <b>G++</b>    I know what each letter means, but sometimes have to look up the specifics.

       <b>G+</b>     I was once G++ (or higher), but the new versions are getting too long and too complicated.

       <b>G</b>      I know what the geek code is and even did up this code.

       <b>G-</b>     What a tremendous waste of time this Geek Code is.

       <b>G--</b>    Not only a waste of time, but it obviously shows that this Hayden guy needs a life.

       Geeks,  unlike  the  lower  lifeforms  known as nerds, have lives. They have things to do that are in the
       outside world. Of course, this is usually done with other geeks, but that's not the point. The point is,,
       that geeks are not necessarily the outcasts society often believes they are. The  fact  is  that  society
       isn't kool enough to be included in our activities.

   <b>Education</b>
       All geeks have a varying amount of education.

       <b>e+++++</b> I am Stephen Hawking

       <b>e++++</b>  Managed to get my Ph.D.

       <b>e+++</b>   Got a Masters degree

       <b>e++</b>    Got a Bachelors degree

       <b>e+</b>     Got an Associates degree

       <b>e</b>      Finished High School

       <b>e-</b>     Haven't finished High School

       <b>e--</b>    Haven't even entered High School

       <b>e*</b>     I learned everything there is to know about life from the "Hitchhiker's Trilogy".

   <b>Housing</b>
       Tell us about your geeky home.

       <b>h++</b>    Living in a cave with 47 computers and an Internet feed, located near a Dominoes pizza. See !d.

       <b>h+</b>     Living  alone,  get  out  once  a  week  to buy food, no more than once a month to do laundry. All
              surfaces covered.

       <b>h</b>      Friends come over to visit every once in a while to talk about Geek things. There is a  place  for
              them to sit.

       <b>h-</b>     Living with one or more registered Geeks.

       <b>h--</b>    Living with one or more people who know nothing about being a Geek and refuse to watch Babylon 5.

       <b>h---</b>   Married,  (persons living romantically with someone might as well label themselves h---, you're as
              good as there already.)

       <b>h----</b>  Married with children - Al Bundy can sympathize

       <b>h!</b>     I am stuck living with my parents!

       <b>h*</b>     I'm not sure where I live anymore. This lab/workplace seems like home to me.

   <b>Relationships</b>
       While many geeks are highly successful at having relationships, a good many more are  not.  Give  us  the
       gritty details.

       <b>r+++</b>   Found someone, dated, and am now married.

       <b>r++</b>    I've dated my current S.O. for a long time.

       <b>r+</b>     I date frequently, bouncing from one relationship to another.

       <b>r</b>      I date periodically.

       <b>r-</b>     I have difficulty maintaining a relationship.

       <b>r--</b>    People just aren't interested in dating me.

       <b>r---</b>   I'm beginning to think that I'm a leper or something, the way people avoid me like the plague.

       <b>!r</b>     I've never had a relationship.

       <b>r*</b>     signifying  membership  in the SBCA (Sour Bachelor(ette)'s Club of America). The motto is 'Bitter,
              but not Desperate'. First founded at Caltech.

       <b>r%</b>     I was going out with someone, but the asshole dumped me.

   <b>Sex</b>
       Geeks have traditionally had problems with sex (ie, they never have any). Because geeks are so wrapped up
       in their sexuality (or lack of sexuality for that matter), it is important that the geek  be  willing  to
       quantify their sexual experiences.

       This  code also is used to denote the gender of the geek. Females use <u>x</u> in this category, while males use
       <u>y</u>. Those that do not wish to disclose their gender can use <u>z</u>. For example:

       <b>x+</b>     A female who has had sex

       <b>y+</b>     A male who has had sex.

       <b>z+</b>     A person (gender undisclosed) who has had sex.

       For those persons who do not wish to give out any details of their sex life, the use of <u>z?</u>  (where  <u>z</u>  is
       the gender code) will allow you to do so.

       <b>z+++++</b> I am Madonna

       <b>z++++</b>  I have a few little rug rats to prove I've been there. Besides, with kids around, who has time for
              sex?

       <b>z+++</b>   I'm married, so I can get it (theoretically) whenever I want.

       <b>z++</b>    I was once referred to as 'easy'. I have no idea where that might have come from though.

       <b>z+</b>     I've had real, live sex.

       <b>z</b>      I've had sex. Oh! You mean with someone else? Then no.

       <b>z-</b>     Not having sex by choice.

       <b>z--</b>    Not having sex because I just can't get any...

       <b>z---</b>   Not having sex because I'm a nun or a priest.

       <b>z*</b>     I'm a pervert.

       <b>z**</b>    I've been known to make perverts look like angels.

       <b>!z</b>     Sex? What's that? I've had no sexual experiences.

       <b>z?</b>     It's none of your business what my sex life is like (this is used to denote your gender only).

       <b>!z+</b>    Sex? What's that? No experience, willing to learn!

</pre><h4><b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Display</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Code</b></h4><pre>
       Now  that  you  have  your  ratings for each of the above categories, it's time to assemble your code for
       displaying to the world. Take each category you determined and list them  all  together  with  one  space
       between each one. If you run out space on one line, continue it on the next. When completed, it will look
       something like the following:

       <u>GED/J</u>  <u>d--</u>  <u>s:++&gt;:</u>  <u>a--</u>  <u>C++(++++)</u> <u>ULU++</u> <u>P+</u> <u>L++</u> <u>E----</u> <u>W+(-)</u> <u>N+++</u> <u>o+</u> <u>K+++</u> <u>w---</u> <u>O-</u> <u>M+</u> <u>V--</u> <u>PS++&gt;$</u> <u>PE++&gt;$</u> <u>Y++</u>
       <u>PGP++</u> <u>t-</u> <u>5+++</u> <u>X++</u> <u>R+++&gt;$</u> <u>tv+</u> <u>b+</u> <u>DI+++</u> <u>D+++</u> <u>G+++++</u> <u>e++</u> <u>h</u> <u>r--</u> <u>y++**</u>

       If you are going to place your Geek Code into your .signature or .plan  file  (highly  recommended),  you
       should create your GEEK CODE BLOCK.  This parody of the output created by the PGP program will attempt to
       universalize  how  you  will  see  the  Geek Code around the net. Your GEEK CODE BLOCK will look like the
       following:

       <b>-----BEGIN</b> <b>GEEK</b> <b>CODE</b> <b>BLOCK-----</b>
       Version: 3.1
       <u>GED/J</u> <u>d--</u> <u>s:++&gt;:</u> <u>a--</u> <u>C++(++++)</u> <u>ULU++</u> <u>P+</u> <u>L++</u> <u>E----</u> <u>W+(-)</u> <u>N+++</u> <u>o+</u> <u>K+++</u> <u>w---</u> <u>O-</u> <u>M+</u>  <u>V--</u>  <u>PS++&gt;$</u>  <u>PE++&gt;$</u>  <u>Y++</u>
       <u>PGP++</u> <u>t-</u> <u>5+++</u> <u>X++</u> <u>R+++&gt;$</u> <u>tv+</u> <u>b+</u> <u>DI+++</u> <u>D+++</u> <u>G+++++</u> <u>e++</u> <u>h</u> <u>r--</u> <u>y++**</u>

       <b>------END</b> <b>GEEK</b> <b>CODE</b> <b>BLOCK------</b>
       As  you can see, the actual code hasn't changed. However, the version number of the code you are using is
       displayed along with lines starting and ending the code. Make sure to duplicate the start and  end  lines
       exactly  as  the example in order to maintain a net-wide standard (ie. five dashes front and back for the
       BEGIN line and six for the END line, and all capital letters.)

       "HELP!" you scream as your mailer or news reader  won't  let  you  post  more  than  four  lines  in  the
       .signature. That is because some anal programs limit the size of your signature. Your next best bet, then
       is  to  put your GEEK CODE BLOCK into your .plan file and put something to the effect of "Finger for Geek
       Code" into your .signature. That, or get a better mailer.
