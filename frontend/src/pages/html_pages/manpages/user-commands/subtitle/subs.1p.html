</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       subs - convert, join, split, and re-time subtitles

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
               subs [options] subfile [ subfile ... ]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -a coeff, -b time
           a  and  b  coefficients  in  linear  transformation  u=at+b,  where  t and u are src and dest times (
           default(identity transform) is [a=1,b=0] ).  -a can be set as ratio, f.ex. 23.9/25

       -c codec
           Use codec to write file. Run 'subs -h' for list of installed codecs.

       -d  Try to prolong duration of quickly disappearing text.  'Quickly' is less than 0.8 second per line  of
           text.

       -e command
           Run  perl  code  for  each  line  of  text  in  file.  On  each  run, the text and time variables are
           initialized, and new values, if any, written to the file. The variables are used for:

           $_  subtitle text line

           $b  cue beginning

           $e  cue end

           $i  line number

           $n  number of lines

           %p  persistent data between runs

           The -e option can be specified several times

       -h  Display help

       -i  Edit files in place ( makes backup in .bak files )

       -j sec
           Time interval between joins, seconds (default 2)

       -o file
           File to save processed subtitles (default out.sub)

       -O  Separate overlapped lines

       -p t1 t2 or -P t2 t1
           Set a control point, where t1 is time of a phrase spoken in the film and t2 is  time  when  the  same
           phrase  as  appears  in the subtitle. Two points are required for deducing -a and -b coefficients; if
           only one point is specified, it is assumed that the other one is [0,0].

           Times can be relative, f.ex. -p 01:00 +3.5 -p -20 1:00:00

           Options -P and -p are the same except the argument sequence is reversed.   -P  is  to  be  used  when
           arguments to -p were typed manually and in wrong order.

       -q t1 t2
           Restrict  changes,  if  any, in time span t1-t2. Word 'end' can be used as an alias to the end of the
           file. Default values are '0' and 'end'.

       -r rate
           Force frame-per-second rate for frame-based subs

       -s time
           Split in two parts by time

       -v  Be verbose

       -z file.sub
           Zip subtitle files so time information is read from file.sub, while text information is read from the
           input file(s).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The time format is either [[HH:]MM:]SS[.MSEC] or subtitle format-specific

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Warning: -i is a great feature, but use it with certain caution.

       If subtitles are shown too early ( 5 seconds):

         subs -i -b 5 file.sub

       If subtitles are for a movie in 25 fps, need to be for 24 ( actual for frame-based formats only ).

         subs -i -a 24/25 file.sub

       If subtitles start ok, but in 1 hour are late in 7 seconds:

         subs -i -p 0 0 -p 1:00:00 +7 file.sub

       Join two parts with 15-second gap

         subs -o joined.sub -j 15 part1.sub part2.sub

       Split in two after 50 minutes and half a second ( makes basename.1.sub and basename.2.sub ).

         subs -o basename.sub -s 50:00.5 toobig.sub

       Remove closed caption-specific comments such as '[Sneezing]' or '[Music playing]'

         subs -e 's/[\s-]*\[.*\]\s*\n*//gs' sub.sub
