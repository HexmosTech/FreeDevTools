       stilts-votlint - Validates VOTable documents

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>stilts</b> <b>votlint</b> [votable=<u>&lt;location&gt;</u>] [ucd=<u>true|false</u>] [unit=<u>true|false</u>] [maxrepeat=<u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>]
                      [validate=<u>true|false</u>] [version=<u>1.0|1.1|1.2|1.3|1.4|1.5</u>] [out=<u>&lt;location&gt;</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  VOTable standard, while not hugely complicated, has a number of subtleties and it's not difficult to
       produce VOTable documents which violate it in various ways. In some cases the  errors  are  small  and  a
       parser  is likely to process the document without noticing the trouble. In other cases, the errors are so
       serious that it's hard for any software to make sense of it. In many cases in between, different software
       will react in different ways, in the worst case appearing to parse a VOTable but  in  fact  understanding
       the wrong data.

       <u>votlint</u>  is a program which can check a VOTable document and spot places where it does not conform to the
       VOTable standard, or places which look like they may not mean what the author intended. It is  meant  for
       use in two main scenarios:

       * For  authors  of  VOTables and VOTable-producing software, to check that the documents they produce are
         legal and problem-free.

       * For users of VOTables (including authors of VOTable-processing software) who are having  problems  with
         one and want to know whether it is the data or the software at fault.

       Validating  a VOTable document against the VOTable schema or DTD of course goes a long way towards check‐
       ing a VOTable document for errors, but it by no means does the whole job, simply because  the  schema/DTD
       specification languages don't have the facilities to understand the data structure of a VOTable document.
       For instance the VOTable schema will allow any plain text content in a <u>TD</u> element, but whether this makes
       sense  in  a VOTable depends on the <u>datatype</u> attribute of the corresponding <u>FIELD</u> element. There are many
       other examples. <u>votlint</u> tackles this by parsing the VOTable document  in  a  way  which  understands  its
       structure and assessing the content as critically as it can. For any incorrect or questionable content it
       finds,  it  will  output  a short message describing the problem and giving its location in the document.
       What you do with this information is then up to you.

       Using <u>votlint</u> is very straightforward. The <u>votable</u> argument gives the location (filename  or  URL)  of  a
       VOTable  document.  Otherwise,  the document will be read from standard input. Error and warning messages
       will be written on standard output. Each message is prefixed with the location at  which  the  error  was
       found  (if  possible  the  line  and column are shown, though this is dependent on your JVM's default XML
       parser). If multiple instances of the same problem are found, by default only a few repeats of  the  mes‐
       sage  are  reported; this can be controlled with the <u>maxrepeat</u> parameter. The processing is SAX-based, so
       arbitrarily long tables can be processed without heavy memory use.

       <u>votlint</u> can't guarantee to pick up every possible error in a VOTable document, but it ought  to  pick  up
       many of the most serious errors that are commonly made in authoring VOTables.

       <b>Note:</b>  <u>votlint</u>'s  handling  of XML namespaces seems to be somewhat dependent on the XML parser in use. As
       far as I can see, Crimson (the default in many JREs) works for any  namespace  arrangements,  but  Xerces
       seems  to  have  problems  when  validating  documents which use namespace prefixes. Not sure about other
       parsers. This probably won't cause you trouble, but if it does you may need to set <u>validate=false</u> to work
       around it. Contact the author if this seems to be a serious issue for you.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>votable=</b><u>&lt;location&gt;</u>
              Location of the VOTable to be checked. This may be a filename, URL or "-" (the default), to  indi‐
              cate  standard input. The input may be compressed using one of the known compression formats (Unix
              compress, gzip or bzip2).

       <b>ucd=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If true, the <u>ucd</u> attributes on FIELD and PARAM elements etc are checked  for  conformance  against
              the UCD1+ standard or a list of known UCD1 terms.

       <b>unit=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If  true,  the <u>unit</u> attributes on FIELD and PARAM elements are checked for conformance against the
              VOUnits standard; if false, no such checks are made.

              The VOTable standard version 1.4 and later recommends use of VOUnits (there are some  inconsisten‐
              cies  in the text on this topic in VOTable 1.4, but these are cleared up in V1.5). Earlier VOTable
              versions refer to a different (CDS) unit syntax, which is not checked by <u>votlint</u>.  So  by  default
              unit  syntax is checked when the VOTable is 1.4 or greater, and not for earlier versions, but that
              can be overridden by giving a <u>true</u> or <u>false</u> value for this parameter.

              The wording of the VOTable and VOUnit standards do not strictly require use of VOUnit syntax  even
              at VOTable 1.4, so failed checks result in Warning rather than Error reports.

       <b>maxrepeat=</b><u>&lt;int-value&gt;</u>
              Puts a limit on the number of times that the same issue will be reported. With this set to a rela‐
              tively small number, the output is not cluttered with many repetitions of the same problem.

       <b>validate=</b><u>true|false</u>
              Whether  to  validate  the  input document aganist the VOTable DTD. If true (the default), then as
              well as <u>votlint</u>'s own checks, it is validated against an appropriate version of  the  VOTable  DTD
              which  picks  up  such  things as the presence of unknown elements and attributes, elements in the
              wrong place, and so on. Sometimes however, particularly when XML namespaces are involved, the val‐
              idator can get confused and may produce a lot of spurious errors. Setting this flag false prevents
              this validation step so that only <u>votlint</u>'s own checks are performed. In this case many violations
              of the VOTable standard concerning document structure will go unnoticed.

       <b>version=</b><u>1.0|1.1|1.2|1.3|1.4|1.5</u>
              Selects the version of the VOTable standard which the input table is supposed  to  exemplify.  The
              version  may also be specified within the document using the "version" attribute of the document's
              VOTABLE element; if it is and it conflicts with the value specified by this flag, a warning is is‐
              sued.

              If no value is provided for this parameter (the default), the version will be determined from  the
              VOTable itself.

       <b>out=</b><u>&lt;location&gt;</u>
              Destination file for output messages. May be a filename or "-" to indicate standard output.
