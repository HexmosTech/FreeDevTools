</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       letterize - phone-number to letter-mnemonic generator&lt;/refpurpose&gt;

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>letterize</b> [word...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program tries to help you find a letter mnemonic matching a given phone number.

       It emits to standard output each possible pronounceable mnemonic, one per line, using the American
       standard mapping of dial letters to numbers (2 goes to ABC, 3 to DEF, 4 to GHI, 5 to JKL, 6 to MNO, 7 to
       PRS, 8 to TUV, 9 to XYZ).

       The program uses a table of pronounceable letter-triples derived from a dictionary scan. Each potential
       mnemonic must be such that all of its letter-triples are in the table to be emitted. About 30% of
       possible triples are considered pronounceable.

       A typical 7-digit phone number has 19,683 possible mnemonics, but this test usually cuts the list down to
       a few hundred or so, a reasonable number to eyeball-check. For some numbers, the list will, sadly, be
       empty.

       It’s best to leave out punctuation such as dashes and parens.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The filtering method doesn’t know what plausible medial triples are not reasonable at the beginnings and
       ends of words.

       I’m not sure what table position 0 (which is what 0 and 1 are mapped to) means. If you figure it out, you
       tell me. I really should have generated my own table, but that would have been more work than this seemed
       worth — if your number contains either, you probably need to generate your mnemonic in disjoint pieces
       around the digits anyway.
