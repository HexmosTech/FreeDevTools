</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ra-retrieve - retrieve files that match a query for use with remembrance agent software

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ra-retrieve</b> [--version] [-v] [-d] &lt;base-dir&gt; [--docnum &lt;docnum&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ra-index</b>  and <b>ra-retrieve</b> make up the Savant search engine, an information retrieval engine designed as a
       back-end for the Remembrance Agent (RA).  Given a collection of the user's accumulated email, usenet news
       articles, papers, saved HTML files and other text notes, the RA attempts to find  those  documents  which
       are  most  relevant  to the user's current context.  That is, it searches this collection of text for the
       documents which bear the highest word-for-word similarity to the text the user is currently  editing,  in
       the  hope  that  they  will also bear high conceptual similarity and thus be useful to the user's current
       work.  With the Emacs front-end, these suggestions are continuously displayed in a small  buffer  at  the
       bottom  of the user's window.  If a suggestion looks useful, the full text can be retrieved with a single
       command.

       The Remembrance Agent works in two stages.  First, the user's collection of  text  documents  is  indexed
       into  a  database  saved  in  a  vector  format.   After  the database is created, the other stage of the
       Remembrance Agent is run from emacs, where it periodically takes a sample of text from the working buffer
       and finds those documents from the collection that are most similar.  It summarizes the top documents  in
       a  small  emacs  window  and allows you to retrieve the entire text of any one with a keystroke.  See the
       README file for information on using the Emacs front-end.

       The RA is primarily designed as a proactive information provider that continually gives  you  information
       that  might be relevant to your current environment.  In this mode, <b>ra-retrieve</b> is run by a front end and
       its output is parsed into a more human-readable format.  However, Savant can also be used as  a  standard
       text and information retrieval search engine.

   <b>USAGE</b>
       The  one argument to <b>ra-retrieve</b> is &lt;base-dir&gt;, which is the directory containing the index files created
       by <b>ra-index.</b>  This starts an interactive process that handles queries and  returns  documents  that  most
       match  that  query.  When running with the -v argument, a menu and other information is printed.  Without
       the -v option it is assumed that <b>ra-retrieve</b> has been run from a front-end, and only minimal  information
       is printed.  The following commands are available:

       <u>query</u> <u>&lt;num-lines&gt;</u>
              Find  the  &lt;num-lines&gt;  most  relevant documents to a query.  Default is 5.  Enter the text of the
              query, followed by a ^D (ASCII 04).  If the query matches a predefined template  then  fields  are
              parsed  and  separately.   For example, in emacs mail mode the from, subject, date and body of the
              message are all individually parsed.  If no template matches, the query is  assumed  to  be  plain
              text.

              A  query will output up to n summary lines followed by a period on a line by itself.  Each summary
              line will contain a line number, relevance  number,  document  number,  and  a  series  of  fields
              describing  the  document.  The final field is a comma-separated list of words from the query that
              most contributed to this document being chosen.

       <u>retrieve</u> <u>&lt;document</u> <u>number&gt;</u>
              Retrieve and print the document with the given document number.   Document  number  is  the  third
              field  outputed  by  the query.  The full text of the document is displayed.  If the document is a
              part of a larger file, such as in an email in an archive file, only that one document is shown.

       <u>loc-retrieve</u> <u>&lt;document</u> <u>number&gt;</u>
              Retrieve and print the location of the document with the given document number.  Three values  are
              displayed,  each  on  their  own  separate  line.   The first is the character offset to where the
              beginning of the document is found.  The second is  the  character  offset  for  the  end  of  the
              document.   The  third line contains the fully expanded filename for the document itself.  This is
              primarily so front-ends can load the document and display them with their own formatting.

       <u>info</u>   Display version and database info.

       <u>quit</u>   Quit.

       <u>?</u>      Display menu.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <u>-v</u>     Verbose mode.  Print a menu and other info for running without a front-end.

       <u>-d</u>     Debug mode.  Print not-so-useful information.

       <u>[--docnum</u> <u>&lt;docnum&gt;]</u>
              Print the contents of the specified document number and exit. This  option  doesn't  use  as  much
              memory as interactive mode, and is useful for scripts that call this program.
