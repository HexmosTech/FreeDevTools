</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       scons - a software construction tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>scons</b> [<u>options</u>...] [<u>name</u>=<u>val</u>...] [<u>targets</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scons</b> orchestrates the construction of software (and other tangible products such as documentation files)
       by determining which component pieces must be built or rebuilt and invoking the necessary commands to
       build them.  SCons offers many features to improve developer productivity such as parallel builds,
       caching of build artifacts, automatic dependency scanning, and a database of information about previous
       builds so details do not have to be recalculated each run.

       <b>scons</b> requires Python 3.6 or later to run; there should be no other dependencies or requirements, unless
       the experimental Ninja tool is used.

       <u>Changed</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.3.0:</u> support for Python 3.5 is removed; the CPython project has retired 3.5:
       <b>https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0478</b>.

       You set up an SCons build system by writing a script that describes things to build (targets), and, if
       necessary, the rules to build those files (actions).  SCons comes with a collection of Builder methods
       which apply premade actions for building many common software components such as executable programs,
       object files and libraries, so that for many software projects, only the targets and input files
       (sources) need be specified in a call to a builder.  SCons thus can operate at a level of abstraction
       above that of pure filenames. For example if you specify a library target named "foo", SCons keeps track
       of the actual operating system dependent filename (such as libfoo.so on a GNU/Linux system), and how to
       refer to that library in later construction steps that want to use it, so you don't have to specify that
       precise information yourself.  SCons can also scan automatically for dependency information, such as
       header files included by source code files (for example, #include preprocessor directives in C or C++
       files), so these implicit dependencies do not have to be specified manually.  SCons supports the ability
       to define new scanners to support additional input file types.

       Information about files involved in the build, including a cryptographic hash of the contents of source
       files, is cached for later reuse. By default this hash (the content signature) is used to determine if a
       file has changed since the last build, although this can be controlled by selecting an appropriate
       <b>Decider</b> function. Implicit dependency files are also part of out-of-date computation. The scanned
       implicit dependency information can optionally be cached and used to speed up future builds. A hash of
       each executed build action (the build signature) is cached, so that changes to build instructions
       (changing flags, etc.) or to the build tools themselves (new version) can also trigger a rebuild.

       SCons supports the concept of separated source and build directories through the definition of variant
       directories (see the <b>VariantDir</b> function).

       When invoked, <b>scons</b> looks for a file named SConstruct in the current directory and reads the build
       configuration from that file (other names are allowed, see the section called “SConscript Files” and the
       <b>-f</b> option for more information). The build may be structured in a hierarchical manner: the SConstruct
       file may specify subsidiary configuration files by calling the <b>SConscript</b> function, and these may, in
       turn, do the same. By convention, these subsidiary files are named SConscript, although any name may be
       used. As a result of this naming convention, the term SConscript files is used to refer generically to
       the complete set of configuration files for a project (including the SConstruct file), regardless of the
       actual file names or number of such files. A hierarchical build is not recursive - all of the SConscript
       files are processed in a single pass, although each is processed in a separate context so as not to
       interfere with one another.  SCons provides mechanisms for information to be shared between SConscript
       files when needed.

       Before reading the SConscript files, <b>scons</b> looks for a directory named site_scons in various system
       directories and in the directory containing the SConstruct file or, if specified, the directory from the
       <b>--site-dir</b> option instead, and prepends the ones it finds to the Python module search path (<u>sys.path</u>),
       thus allowing modules in such directories to be imported in the normal Python way in SConscript files.
       For each found site directory, (1) if it contains a file site_init.py that file is evaluated, and (2) if
       it contains a directory site_tools the path to that directory is prepended to the default toolpath. See
       the <b>--site-dir</b> and <b>--no-site-dir</b> options for details on default paths and controlling the site
       directories.

       SConscript files are written in the Python programming language, although it is normally not necessary to
       be a Python programmer to use <b>scons</b> effectively.  SConscript files are invoked in a context that makes
       the facilities described in this manual page available in their local namespace without any special
       steps. Standard Python scripting capabilities such as flow control, data manipulation, and imported
       Python libraries are available to use to handle complicated build situations. Other Python files can be
       made a part of the build system, but they do not automatically have the SCons context and need to import
       it if they need access (described later).

       <b>scons</b> reads and executes all of the included SConscript files <u>before</u> it begins building any targets. To
       make this clear, <b>scons</b> prints the following messages about what it is doing:

           $ <b>scons</b> <b>foo.out</b>
           scons: Reading SConscript files ...
           scons: done reading SConscript files.
           scons: Building targets  ...
           cp foo.in foo.out
           scons: done building targets.
           $

       The status messages (lines beginning with the scons: tag) may be suppressed using the <b>-Q</b> option.

       To assure reproducible builds, SCons uses a restricted execution environment for running external
       commands used to build targets, rather then propagating the full environment in effect at the time <b>scons</b>
       was called. This helps avoid problems like picking up accidental settings, temporary debug values that
       are no longer needed, or one developer having different settings than another (or than the CI/CD
       pipeline). Environment variables that are needed for proper operation of such commands need to be set
       explicitly, which can be done either by assigning the desired values, or by picking values individually
       out of environment variables using the Python os.environ dictionary. The execution environment for a
       given construction environment is contained in its <b>$ENV</b> construction variable. A few environment
       variables are picked up automatically - see the section called “ENVIRONMENT”).

       In particular, if the compiler or other commands that you want to use to build your target files are not
       in standard system locations, <b>scons</b> will not find them unless you explicitly include the locations into
       the <u>PATH</u> element of the execution environment. One example approach is to extract the entire <b>PATH</b>
       environment variable and set that into the execution environment:

           import os
           env = Environment(ENV={'PATH': os.environ['PATH']})

       Similarly, if the commands use specific external environment variables that <b>scons</b> does not recognize,
       they can be propagated into the execution environment:

           import os

           env = Environment(
               ENV={
                   'PATH': os.environ['PATH'],
                   'ANDROID_HOME': os.environ['ANDROID_HOME'],
                   'ANDROID_NDK_HOME': os.environ['ANDROID_NDK_HOME'],
               }
           )

       Or you may explicitly propagate the invoking user's complete external environment:

           import os
           env = Environment(ENV=os.environ.copy())

       This comes at the expense of making your build dependent on the user's environment being set correctly,
       but it may be more convenient for many configurations. It should not cause problems if done in a build
       setup which tightly controls how the environment is set up before invoking <b>scons</b>, as in many continuous
       integration setups.

       <b>scons</b> is normally executed in a top-level directory containing an SConstruct file. When <b>scons</b> is invoked,
       the command line (including the contents of the <b>SCONSFLAGS</b> environment variable, if set) is processed.
       Command-line options (see the section called “OPTIONS”) are consumed. Any variable argument assignments
       are collected, and remaining arguments are taken as targets to build.

       Values of variables to be passed to the SConscript files may be specified on the command line:

           <b>scons</b> <b>debug=1</b>

       These variables are available through the <u>ARGUMENTS</u> dictionary, and can be used in the SConscript files
       to modify the build in any way:

           if ARGUMENTS.get('debug', 0):
               env = Environment(CCFLAGS='-g')
           else:
               env = Environment()

       The command-line variable arguments are also available in the <u>ARGLIST</u> list, indexed by their order on the
       command line. This allows you to process them in order rather than by name, if necessary. Each <u>ARGLIST</u>
       entry is a tuple containing (<u>argname</u>, <u>argvalue</u>).

       See the section called “Command-Line Construction Variables” for more information.

       <b>scons</b> can maintain a cache of target (derived) files that can be shared between multiple builds. When
       derived-file caching is enabled in an SConscript file, any target files built by <b>scons</b> will be copied to
       the cache. If an up-to-date target file is found in the cache, it will be retrieved from the cache
       instead of being rebuilt locally. Caching behavior may be disabled and controlled in other ways by the
       <b>--cache-force</b>, <b>--cache-disable</b>, <b>--cache-readonly</b>, and <b>--cache-show</b> command-line options. The <b>--random</b>
       option is useful to prevent multiple builds from trying to update the cache simultaneously.

       By default, <b>scons</b> searches for known programming tools on various systems and initializes itself based on
       what is found. On Windows systems which identify as <u>win32</u>, <b>scons</b> searches in order for the Microsoft
       Visual C++ tools, the MinGW tool chain, the Intel compiler tools, and the PharLap ETS compiler. On
       Windows system which identify as <u>cygwin</u> (that is, if <b>scons</b> is invoked from a cygwin shell), the order
       changes to prefer the GCC toolchain over the MSVC tools. On OS/2 systems, <b>scons</b> searches in order for the
       OS/2 compiler, the GCC tool chain, and the Microsoft Visual C++ tools, On SGI IRIX, IBM AIX, Hewlett
       Packard HP-UX, and Oracle Solaris systems, <b>scons</b> searches for the native compiler tools (MIPSpro, Visual
       Age, aCC, and Forte tools respectively) and the GCC tool chain. On all other platforms, including POSIX
       (Linux and UNIX) platforms, <b>scons</b> searches in order for the GCC tool chain, and the Intel compiler tools.
       These default values may be overridden by appropriate setting of construction variables.

   <b>Target</b> <b>Selection</b>
       SCons acts on the selected targets, whether the requested operation is build, no-exec or clean. Targets
       are selected as follows:

        1. Targets specified on the command line. These may be files, directories, or phony targets defined
           using the <b>Alias</b> function. Directory targets are scanned by <b>scons</b> for any targets that may be found
           with a destination in or under that directory. The targets listed on the command line are made
           available in the <u>COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS</u> list.

        2. If no targets are specified on the command line, <b>scons</b> will select those targets specified in the
           SConscript files via calls to the <b>Default</b> function. These are known as the default targets, and are
           made available in the <u>DEFAULT_TARGETS</u> list.

        3. If no targets are selected by the previous steps, <b>scons</b> selects the current directory for scanning,
           unless command-line options which affect the directory for target scanning are present (<b>-C</b>, <b>-D</b>, <b>-u</b>,
           <b>-U</b>). Since targets thus selected were not the result of user instructions, this target list is not
           made available for direct inspection; use the <b>--debug=explain</b> option if they need to be examined.

        4.  <b>scons</b> always adds to the selected targets any intermediate targets which are necessary to build the
           specified ones. For example, if constructing a shared library or dll from C source files, <b>scons</b> will
           also build the object files which will make up the library.

       To ignore the default targets specified through calls to <b>Default</b> and instead build all target files in or
       below the current directory specify the current directory (.) as a command-line target:

           <b>scons</b> <b>.</b>

       To build all target files, including any files outside of the current directory, supply a command-line
       target of the root directory (on POSIX systems):

           <b>scons</b> <b>/</b>

       or the path name(s) of the volume(s) in which all the targets should be built (on Windows systems):

           <b>scons</b> <b>C:\</b> <b>D:\</b>

       A subset of a hierarchical tree may be built by remaining at the top-level directory (where the
       SConstruct file lives) and specifying the subdirectory as the target to build:

           <b>scons</b> <b>src/subdir</b>

       or by changing directory and invoking scons with the <b>-u</b> option, which traverses up the directory
       hierarchy until it finds the SConstruct file, and then builds targets relatively to the current
       subdirectory (see also the related <b>-D</b> and <b>-U</b> options):

           <b>cd</b> <b>src/subdir</b>
           <b>scons</b> <b>-u</b> <b>.</b>

       In all cases, more files may be built than are requested, as <b>scons</b> needs to make sure any dependent files
       are built.

       Specifying "cleanup" targets in SConscript files is usually not necessary. The <b>-c</b> flag removes all
       selected targets:

           <b>scons</b> <b>-c</b> <b>.</b>

       to remove all target files in or under the current directory, or:

           <b>scons</b> <b>-c</b> <b>build</b> <b>export</b>

       to remove target files under build and export.

       Additional files or directories to remove can be specified using the <b>Clean</b> function in the SConscript
       files. Conversely, targets that would normally be removed by the <b>-c</b> invocation can be retained by calling
       the <b>NoClean</b> function with those targets.

       <b>scons</b> supports building multiple targets in parallel via a <b>-j</b> option that takes, as its argument, the
       number of simultaneous tasks that may be spawned:

           <b>scons</b> <b>-j</b> <b>4</b>

       builds four targets in parallel, for example.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In general, <b>scons</b> supports the same command-line options as GNU Make and many of those supported by cons.

       <b>-b</b>
           Ignored for compatibility with non-GNU versions of Make

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--clean</b>, <b>--remove</b>
           Set clean mode. Clean up by removing the selected targets, well as any files or directories
           associated with a selected target through calls to the <b>Clean</b> function. Will not remove any targets
           which are marked for preservation through calls to the <b>NoClean</b> function.

           While clean mode removes targets rather than building them, work which is done directly in Python
           code in SConscript files will still be carried out. If it is important to avoid some such work from
           taking place in clean mode, it should be protected. An SConscript file can determine which mode is
           active by querying <b>GetOption</b>, as in the call if GetOption("clean"):

       <b>--cache-debug=</b><u>file</u>
           Write debug information about derived-file caching to the specified <u>file</u>. If <u>file</u> is a hyphen (-),
           the debug information is printed to the standard output. The printed messages describe what
           signature-file names are being looked for in, retrieved from, or written to the derived-file cache
           specified by <b>CacheDir</b>.

       <b>--cache-disable</b>, <b>--no-cache</b>
           Disable derived-file caching.  <b>scons</b> will neither retrieve files from the cache nor copy files to the
           cache. This option can be used to temporarily disable the cache without modifying the build scripts.

       <b>--cache-force</b>, <b>--cache-populate</b>
           When using <b>CacheDir</b>, populate a derived-file cache by copying any already-existing, up-to-date
           derived files to the cache, in addition to files built by this invocation. This is useful to populate
           a new cache with all the current derived files, or to add to the cache any derived files recently
           built with caching disabled via the <b>--cache-disable</b> option.

       <b>--cache-readonly</b>
           Use the derived-file cache, if enabled, to retrieve files, but do not not update the cache with any
           files actually built during this invocation.

       <b>--cache-show</b>
           When using a derived-file cache show the command that would have been executed to build the file (or
           the corresponding *COMSTR contents if set) even if the file is retrieved from cache. Without this
           option, <b>scons</b> shows a cache retrieval message if the file is fetched from cache. This allows
           producing consistent output for build logs, regardless of whether a target file was rebuilt or
           retrieved from the cache.

       <b>--config=</b><u>mode</u>
           Control how the <b>Configure</b> call should use or generate the results of configuration tests.  <u>mode</u>
           should be one of the following choices:

           <b>auto</b>
               SCons will use its normal dependency mechanisms to decide if a test must be rebuilt or not. This
               saves time by not running the same configuration tests every time you invoke scons, but will
               overlook changes in system header files or external commands (such as compilers) if you don't
               specify those dependecies explicitly. This is the default behavior.

           <b>force</b>
               If this mode is specified, all configuration tests will be re-run regardless of whether the
               cached results are out of date. This can be used to explicitly force the configuration tests to
               be updated in response to an otherwise unconfigured change in a system header file or compiler.

           <b>cache</b>
               If this mode is specified, no configuration tests will be rerun and all results will be taken
               from cache.  <b>scons</b> will report an error if <b>--config=cache</b> is specified and a necessary test does
               not have any results in the cache.

       <b>-C</b> <u>directory</u>, <b>--directory=</b><u>directory</u>
           Run as if <b>scons</b> was started in <u>directory</u> instead of the current working directory. That is, change
           directory before searching for the SConstruct, Sconstruct, sconstruct, SConstruct.py, Sconstruct.py
           or sconstruct.py file or doing anything else. When multiple <b>-C</b> options are given, each subsequent
           non-absolute <b>-C</b> <u>directory</u> is interpreted relative to the preceding one. This option is similar to
           using <b>-f</b> <u>directory</u><b>/SConstruct</b>, but <b>-f</b> does not search for any of the predefined SConstruct names in
           the specified directory. See also options <b>-u</b>, <b>-U</b> and <b>-D</b> to change the SConstruct search behavior when
           this option is used.

       <b>-D</b>
           Works exactly the same way as the <b>-u</b> option except for the way default targets are handled. When this
           option is used and no targets are specified on the command line, all default targets are built,
           whether or not they are below the current directory.

       <b>--debug=</b><u>type</u><b>[</b><u>,type</u><b>...]</b>
           Debug the build process.  <u>type</u> specifies the kind of debugging info to emit. Multiple types may be
           specified, separated by commas. The following types are recognized:

           <b>action-timestamps</b>
               Prints additional time profiling information. For each command, shows the absolute start and end
               times. This may be useful in debugging parallel builds. Implies the <b>--debug=time</b> option.

               <u>New</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>3.1.</u>

           <b>count</b>
               Print how many objects are created of the various classes used internally by SCons before and
               after reading the SConscript files and before and after building targets. This is not supported
               when SCons is executed with the Python <b>-O</b> (optimized) option or when the SCons modules have been
               compiled with optimization (that is, when executing from *.pyo files).

           <b>duplicate</b>
               Print a line for each unlink/relink (or copy) of a file in a variant directory from its source
               file. Includes debugging info for unlinking stale variant directory files, as well as unlinking
               old targets before building them.

           <b>explain</b>
               Print an explanation of why <b>scons</b> is deciding to (re-)build the targets it selects for building.

           <b>findlibs</b>
               Instruct the scanner that searches for libraries to print a message about each potential library
               name it is searching for, and about the actual libraries it finds.

           <b>includes</b>
               Print the include tree after each top-level target is built. This is generally used to find out
               what files are included by the sources of a given derived file:

                   $ <b>scons</b> <b>--debug=includes</b> <b>foo.o</b>

           <b>memoizer</b>
               Prints a summary of hits and misses using the Memoizer, an internal subsystem that counts how
               often SCons uses cached values in memory instead of recomputing them each time they're needed.

           <b>memory</b>
               Prints how much memory SCons uses before and after reading the SConscript files and before and
               after building targets.

           <b>objects</b>
               Prints a list of the various objects of the various classes used internally by SCons.

           <b>pdb</b>
               Re-run <b>scons</b> under the control of the pdb Python debugger.

           <b>prepare</b>
               Print a line each time any target (internal or external) is prepared for building.  <b>scons</b> prints
               this for each target it considers, even if that target is up to date (see also <b>--debug=explain</b>).
               This can help debug problems with targets that aren't being built; it shows whether <b>scons</b> is at
               least considering them or not.

           <b>presub</b>
               Print the raw command line used to build each target before the construction environment
               variables are substituted. Also shows which targets are being built by this command. Output looks
               something like this:

                   $ <b>scons</b> <b>--debug=presub</b>
                   Building myprog.o with action(s):
                     $SHCC $SHCFLAGS $SHCCFLAGS $CPPFLAGS $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES
                   ...

           <b>stacktrace</b>
               Prints an internal Python stack trace when encountering an otherwise unexplained error.

           <b>time</b>
               Prints various time profiling information:

               •   The time spent executing each individual build command

               •   The total build time (time SCons ran from beginning to end)

               •   The total time spent reading and executing SConscript files

               •   The total time SCons itself spent running (that is, not counting reading and executing
                   SConscript files)

               •   The total time spent executing all build commands

               •   The elapsed wall-clock time spent executing those build commands

               •   The time spent processing each file passed to the <b>SConscript</b> function

               (When <b>scons</b> is executed without the <b>-j</b> option, the elapsed wall-clock time will typically be
               slightly longer than the total time spent executing all the build commands, due to the SCons
               processing that takes place in between executing each command. When <b>scons</b> is executed <u>with</u> the <b>-j</b>
               option, and your build configuration allows good parallelization, the elapsed wall-clock time
               should be significantly smaller than the total time spent executing all the build commands, since
               multiple build commands and intervening SCons processing should take place in parallel.)

       <b>--diskcheck=</b><u>type</u>
           Enable specific checks for whether or not there is a file on disk where the SCons configuration
           expects a directory (or vice versa) when searching for source and include files.  <u>type</u> can be an
           available diskcheck type or the special tokens all or none. A comma-separated string can be used to
           select multiple checks. The default setting is all.

           Current available checks are:

           <b>match</b>
               to check that files and directories on disk match SCons' expected configuration.

           Disabling some or all of these checks can provide a performance boost for large configurations, or
           when the configuration will check for files and/or directories across networked or shared file
           systems, at the slight increased risk of an incorrect build or of not handling errors gracefully.

       <b>--duplicate=</b><u>ORDER</u>
           There are three ways to duplicate files in a build tree: hard links, soft (symbolic) links and
           copies. The default policy is to prefer hard links to soft links to copies. You can specify a
           different policy with this option.  <u>ORDER</u> must be one of <u>hard-soft-copy</u> (the default),
           <u>soft-hard-copy</u>, <u>hard-copy</u>, <u>soft-copy</u> or <u>copy</u>.  SCons will attempt to duplicate files using the
           mechanisms in the specified order.

       <b>--enable-virtualenv</b>
           Import virtualenv-related variables to SCons.

       <b>--experimental=</b><u>feature</u>
           Enable experimental features and/or tools.  <u>feature</u> can be an available feature name or the special
           tokens all or none. A comma-separated string can be used to select multiple features. The default
           setting is none.

           Current available features are: ninja (<u>added</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.2</u>), tm_v2 (<u>added</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.4.1</u>).

               <b>Caution</b>
               No Support offered for any features or tools enabled by this flag.
           <u>New</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.2</u> <u>(experimental).</u>

       <b>-f</b> <u>file</u>, <b>--file=</b><u>file</u>, <b>--makefile=</b><u>file</u>, <b>--sconstruct=</b><u>file</u>
           Use <u>file</u> as the initial SConscript file. Multiple <b>-f</b> options may be specified, in which case <b>scons</b>
           will read all of the specified files.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a local help message for this project, if one is defined in the SConscript files (see the <b>Help</b>
           function), plus a line that refers to the standard SCons help message. If no local help message is
           defined, prints the standard SCons help message (as for the <b>-H</b> option) plus help for any local
           options defined through <b>AddOption</b>. Exits after displaying the appropriate message.

           Note that use of this option requires SCons to process the SConscript files, so syntax errors may
           cause the help message not to be displayed.

       <b>--hash-chunksize=</b><u>KILOBYTES</u>
           Set the block size used when computing content signatures to <u>KILOBYTES</u>. This value determines the
           size of the chunks which are read in at once when computing signature hashes. Files below that size
           are fully stored in memory before performing the signature computation while bigger files are read in
           block-by-block. A huge block-size leads to high memory consumption while a very small block-size
           slows down the build considerably.

           The default value is to use a chunk size of 64 kilobytes, which should be appropriate for most uses.

           <u>New</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.2.</u>

       <b>--hash-format=</b><u>ALGORITHM</u>
           Set the hashing algorithm used by SCons to <u>ALGORITHM</u>. This value determines the hashing algorithm
           used in generating content signatures, build signatures and <b>CacheDir</b> keys.

           The supported list of values are: <u>md5</u>, <u>sha1</u> and <u>sha256</u>. However, the Python interpreter used to run
           <b>scons</b> must have the corresponding support available in the hashlib module to use the specified
           algorithm.

           If this option is omitted, the first supported hash format found is selected. Typically this is MD5,
           however, on a FIPS-compliant system using a version of Python older than 3.9, SHA1 or SHA256 is
           chosen as the default.  Python 3.9 and onwards clients always default to MD5, even in FIPS mode.

           Specifying this option changes the name of the SConsign database. The default database is
           .sconsign.dblite. In the presence of this option, <u>ALGORITHM</u> is included in the name to indicate the
           difference, even if the argument is <u>md5</u>. For example, <b>--hash-format=sha256</b> uses a SConsign database
           named .sconsign_sha256.dblite.

           <u>New</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.2.</u>

       <b>-H</b>, <b>--help-options</b>
           Print the standard help message about SCons command-line options and exit.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--ignore-errors</b>
           Ignore all errors from commands executed to rebuild files.

       <b>-I</b> <u>directory</u>, <b>--include-dir=</b><u>directory</u>
           Specifies a <u>directory</u> to search for imported Python modules. If several <b>-I</b> options are used, the
           directories are searched in the order specified.

       <b>--ignore-virtualenv</b>
           Suppress importing virtualenv-related variables to SCons.

       <b>--implicit-cache</b>
           Cache implicit dependencies. This causes <b>scons</b> to use the implicit (scanned) dependencies from the
           last time it was run instead of scanning the files for implicit dependencies. This can significantly
           speed up SCons, but with the following limitations:

           <b>scons</b> will not detect changes to implicit dependency search paths (e.g.  <b>$CPPPATH</b>, <b>$LIBPATH</b>) that
           would ordinarily cause different versions of same-named files to be used.

           <b>scons</b> will miss changes in the implicit dependencies in cases where a new implicit dependency is
           added earlier in the implicit dependency search path (e.g.  <b>$CPPPATH</b>, <b>$LIBPATH</b>) than a current
           implicit dependency with the same name.

       <b>--implicit-deps-changed</b>
           Forces SCons to ignore the cached implicit dependencies. This causes the implicit dependencies to be
           rescanned and recached. This implies <b>--implicit-cache</b>.

       <b>--implicit-deps-unchanged</b>
           Force SCons to ignore changes in the implicit dependencies. This causes cached implicit dependencies
           to always be used. This implies <b>--implicit-cache</b>.

       <b>--install-sandbox=</b><u>sandbox_path</u>
           When using the <b>Install</b> builders, prepend <u>sandbox_path</u> to the installation paths such that all
           installed files will be placed under that directory. This option is unavailable if one of <b>Install</b>,
           <b>InstallAs</b> or <b>InstallVersionedLib</b> is not used in the SConscript files.

       <b>--interactive</b>
           Starts SCons in interactive mode. The SConscript files are read once and a scons&gt;&gt;&gt; prompt is
           printed. Targets may now be rebuilt by typing commands at interactive prompt without having to
           re-read the SConscript files and re-initialize the dependency graph from scratch.

           SCons interactive mode supports the following commands:

           <b>build</b> <u>[OPTIONS]</u> <u>[TARGETS]</u> <u>...</u>
               Builds the specified <u>TARGETS</u> (and their dependencies) with the specified SCons command-line
               <u>OPTIONS</u>.  <b>b</b> and <b>scons</b> are synonyms for <b>build</b>.

               The following SCons command-line options affect the <b>build</b> command:

                   --cache-debug=FILE
                   --cache-disable, --no-cache
                   --cache-force, --cache-populate
                   --cache-readonly
                   --cache-show
                   --debug=TYPE
                   -i, --ignore-errors
                   -j N, --jobs=N
                   -k, --keep-going
                   -n, --no-exec, --just-print, --dry-run, --recon
                   -Q
                   -s, --silent, --quiet
                   --taskmastertrace=FILE
                   --tree=OPTIONS

               Any other SCons command-line options that are specified do not cause errors but have no effect on
               the <b>build</b> command (mainly because they affect how the SConscript files are read, which only
               happens once at the beginning of interactive mode).

           <b>clean</b> <u>[OPTIONS]</u> <u>[TARGETS]</u> <u>...</u>
               Cleans the specified <u>TARGETS</u> (and their dependencies) with the specified <u>OPTIONS</u>.  <b>c</b> is a
               synonym. This command is itself a synonym for <b>build</b> <b>--clean</b>

           <b>exit</b>
               Exits SCons interactive mode. You can also exit by terminating input (Ctrl+D UNIX or Linux
               systems, (Ctrl+Z on Windows systems).

           <b>help</b> <u>[COMMAND]</u>
               Provides a help message about the commands available in SCons interactive mode. If <u>COMMAND</u> is
               specified, <b>h</b> and <b>?</b>  are synonyms.

           <b>shell</b> <u>[COMMANDLINE]</u>
               Executes the specified <u>COMMANDLINE</u> in a subshell. If no <u>COMMANDLINE</u> is specified, executes the
               interactive command interpreter specified in the <b>SHELL</b> environment variable (on UNIX and Linux
               systems) or the <b>COMSPEC</b> environment variable (on Windows systems).  <b>sh</b> and <b>!</b>  are synonyms.

           <b>version</b>
               Prints SCons version information.

           An empty line repeats the last typed command. Command-line editing can be used if the <b>readline</b> module
           is available.

               $ <b>scons</b> <b>--interactive</b>
               scons: Reading SConscript files ...
               scons: done reading SConscript files.
               scons&gt;&gt;&gt; build -n prog
               scons&gt;&gt;&gt; exit

       <b>-j</b> <u>N</u>, <b>--jobs=</b><u>N</u>
           Specifies the maximum number of comcurrent jobs (commands) to run. If there is more than one <b>-j</b>
           option, the last one is effective.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keep-going</b>
           Continue as much as possible after an error. The target that failed and those that depend on it will
           not be remade, but other targets specified on the command line will still be processed.

       <b>-m</b>
           Ignored for compatibility with non-GNU versions of Make.

       <b>--max-drift=</b><u>SECONDS</u>
           Set the maximum expected drift in the modification time of files to <u>SECONDS</u>. This value determines
           how long a file must be unmodified before its cached content signature will be used instead of
           calculating a new content signature (hash) of the file's contents. The default value is 2 days, which
           means a file must have a modification time of at least two days ago in order to have its cached
           content signature used. A negative value means to never cache the content signature and to ignore the
           cached value if there already is one. A value of 0 means to always use the cached signature, no
           matter how old the file is.

       <b>--md5-chunksize=</b><u>KILOBYTES</u>
           A deprecated synonym for <b>--hash-chunksize</b>.

           <u>Changed</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.2:</u> deprecated.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-exec</b>, <b>--just-print</b>, <b>--dry-run</b>, <b>--recon</b>
           Set no-exec mode. Print the commands that would be executed to build any out-of-date targets, but do
           not execute those commands.

           Only target building is suppressed - any work in the build system that is done directly (in regular
           Python code) will still be carried out. You can add guards around code which should not be executed
           in no-exec mode by checking the value of the option at run time with <b>GetOption</b>:

               if not GetOption("no_exec"):
                   # run regular instructions

           The output is a best effort, as SCons cannot always precisely determine what would be built. For
           example, if a file generated by a builder action is also used as a source in the build, that file is
           not available to scan for dependencies at all in an unbuilt tree, and may contain out of date
           information in a previously built tree.

       <b>--no-site-dir</b>
           Prevents the automatic addition of the standard site_scons directories to <u>sys.path</u>. Also prevents
           loading the site_scons/site_init.py modules if they exist, and prevents adding their
           site_scons/site_tools directories to the toolpath.

       <b>--package-type=</b><u>type</u>
           The type of package to create when using the <b>Package</b> builder. Multiple types can be specified by
           using a comma-separated string, in which case SCons will try to build for all of those package types.
           Note this option is only available if the packaging tool has been enabled.

       <b>--profile=</b><u>file</u>
           Run SCons under the Python profiler and save the results to <u>file</u>. The results may be analyzed using
           the Python pstats module.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--question</b>
           Do not run any commands, or print anything. Just return an exit status that is zero if the specified
           targets are already up to date, non-zero otherwise.

       <b>-Q</b>
           Suppress status messages about reading SConscript files, building targets and entering directories.
           Commands that are executed to rebuild target files are still printed.

       <b>--random</b>
           Build dependencies in a random order. This is useful when building multiple trees simultaneously with
           caching enabled, to prevent multiple builds from simultaneously trying to build or retrieve the same
           target files.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--silent</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
           Silent. Do not print commands that are executed to rebuild target files. Also suppresses SCons status
           messages.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--no-keep-going</b>, <b>--stop</b>
           Ignored for compatibility with GNU Make

       <b>--site-dir=</b><u>path</u>
           Use a specific <u>path</u> as the site directory rather than searching the list of default site directories.
           This directory will be prepended to <u>sys.path</u>, the module <u>path</u>/site_init.py will be loaded if it
           exists, and <u>path</u>/site_tools will be added to the default toolpath.

           The default set of site directories searched when <b>--site-dir</b> is not specified depends on the system
           platform, as follows. Users or system administrators can tune site-specific or project-specific SCons
           behavior by setting up a site directory in one or more of these locations. Directories are examined
           in the order given, from most generic ("system" directories) to most specific (in the current
           project), so the last-executed site_init.py file is the most specific one, giving it the chance to
           override everything else), and the directories are prepended to the paths, again so the last
           directory examined comes first in the resulting path.

           Windows:

                   %ALLUSERSPROFILE%/scons/site_scons

               Note earlier versions of the documentation listed a different path for the "system" site
               directory, this path is still checked but its use is discouraged:

       <b>--stack-size=</b><u>KILOBYTES</u>
           Set the size stack used to run threads to <u>KILOBYTES</u>. This value determines the stack size of the
           threads used to run jobs. These threads execute the actions of the builders for the nodes that are
           out-of-date. This option has no effect unless the number of concurrent build jobs is larger than one
           (as set by <b>-j</b> <b>N</b> or <b>--jobs=N</b> on the command line or <b>SetOption</b> in a script).

           Using a stack size that is too small may cause stack overflow errors. This usually shows up as
           segmentation faults that cause scons to abort before building anything. Using a stack size that is
           too large will cause scons to use more memory than required and may slow down the entire build
           process. The default value is to use a stack size of 256 kilobytes, which should be appropriate for
           most uses. You should not need to increase this value unless you encounter stack overflow errors.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--touch</b>
           Ignored for compatibility with GNU Make. (Touching a file to make it appear up-to-date is unnecessary
           when using <b>scons</b>.)

       <b>--taskmastertrace=</b><u>file</u>
           Prints trace information to the specified <u>file</u> about how the internal Taskmaster object evaluates and
           controls the order in which Nodes are built. A file name of <b>-</b> may be used to specify the standard
           output.

       <b>--tree=</b><u>type</u><b>[</b><u>,type</u><b>...]</b>
           Prints a tree of the dependencies after each top-level target is built. This prints out some or all
           of the tree, in various formats, depending on the <u>type</u> specified:

           <b>all</b>
               Print the entire dependency tree after each top-level target is built. This prints out the
               complete dependency tree, including implicit dependencies and ignored dependencies.

           <b>derived</b>
               Restricts the tree output to only derived (target) files, not source files.

           <b>linedraw</b>
               Draw the tree output using Unicode line-drawing characters instead of plain ASCII text. This
               option acts as a modifier to the selected <u>type</u>(s). If specified alone, without any <u>type</u>, it
               behaves as if <b>all</b> had been specified.

               <u>New</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.0.</u>

           <b>status</b>
               Prints status information for each displayed node.

           <b>prune</b>
               Prunes the tree to avoid repeating dependency information for nodes that have already been
               displayed. Any node that has already been displayed will have its name printed in <b>[square</b>
               <b>brackets]</b>, as an indication that the dependencies for that node can be found by searching for the
               relevant output higher up in the tree.

           Multiple <u>type</u> choices may be specified, separated by commas:

               # Prints only derived files, with status information:
               <b>scons</b> <b>--tree=derived,status</b>

               # Prints all dependencies of target, with status information
               # and pruning dependencies of already-visited Nodes:
               <b>scons</b> <b>--tree=all,prune,status</b> <b>target</b>

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--up</b>, <b>--search-up</b>
           Walks up the directory structure until an SConstruct, Sconstruct, sconstruct, SConstruct.py,
           Sconstruct.py or sconstruct.py file is found, and uses that as the top of the directory tree. If no
           targets are specified on the command line, only targets at or below the current directory will be
           built.

       <b>-U</b>
           Works exactly the same way as the <b>-u</b> option except for the way default targets are handled. When this
           option is used and no targets are specified on the command line, all default targets that are defined
           in the SConscript file(s) in the current directory are built, regardless of what directory the
           resultant targets end up in.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Print the <b>scons</b> version, copyright information, list of authors, and any other relevant information.
           Then exit.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--print-directory</b>
           Print a message containing the working directory before and after other processing.

       <b>--no-print-directory</b>
           Turn off -w, even if it was turned on implicitly.

       <b>--warn=</b><u>type</u>, <b>--warn=no-</b><u>type</u>
           Enable or disable (with the prefix "no-") warnings (<b>--warning</b> is a synonym).  <u>type</u> specifies the type
           of warnings to be enabled or disabled:

           <b>all</b>
               All warnings.

           <b>cache-version</b>
               Warnings about the derived-file cache directory specified by <b>CacheDir</b> not using the latest
               configuration information. These warnings are enabled by default.

           <b>cache-write-error</b>
               Warnings about errors trying to write a copy of a built file to a specified derived-file cache
               specified by <b>CacheDir</b>. These warnings are disabled by default.

           <b>corrupt-sconsign</b>
               Warnings about unfamiliar signature data in .sconsign files. These warnings are enabled by
               default.

           <b>dependency</b>
               Warnings about dependencies. These warnings are disabled by default.

           <b>deprecated</b>
               Warnings about use of currently deprecated features. These warnings are enabled by default. Not
               all deprecation warnings can be disabled with the <b>--warn=no-deprecated</b> option as some deprecated
               features which are late in the deprecation cycle may have been designated as mandatory warnings,
               and these will still display. Warnings for certain deprecated features may also be enabled or
               disabled individually; see below.

           <b>duplicate-environment</b>
               Warnings about attempts to specify a build of a target with two different construction
               environments that use the same action. These warnings are enabled by default.

           <b>fortran-cxx-mix</b>
               Warnings about linking Fortran and C++ object files in a single executable, which can yield
               unpredictable behavior with some compilers.

           <b>future-deprecated</b>
               Warnings about features that will be deprecated in the future. Such warnings are disabled by
               default. Enabling future deprecation warnings is recommended for projects that redistribute SCons
               configurations for other users to build, so that the project can be warned as soon as possible
               about to-be-deprecated features that may require changes to the configuration.

           <b>link</b>
               Warnings about link steps.

           <b>misleading-keywords</b>
               Warnings about the use of two commonly misspelled keywords <u>targets</u> and <u>sources</u> to <b>Builder</b> calls.
               The correct spelling is the singular form, even though <u>target</u> and <u>source</u> can themselves refer to
               lists of names or nodes.

           <b>tool-qt-deprecated</b>
               Warnings about the qt tool being deprecated. These warnings are disabled by default for the first
               phase of deprecation. Enable to be reminded about use of this tool module.  <u>New</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.3.</u>

           <b>missing-sconscript</b>
               Warnings about missing SConscript files. These warnings are enabled by default.

           <b>no-object-count</b>
               Warnings about the <b>--debug=object</b> feature not working when <b>scons</b> is run with the Python <b>-O</b> option
               or from optimized Python (.pyo) modules.

           <b>no-parallel-support</b>
               Warnings about the version of Python not being able to support parallel builds when the <b>-j</b> option
               is used. These warnings are enabled by default.

           <b>python-version</b>
               Warnings about running SCons using a version of Python that has been deprecated. These warnings
               are enabled by default.

           <b>reserved-variable</b>
               Warnings about attempts to set the reserved construction variable names <b>$CHANGED_SOURCES</b>,
               <b>$CHANGED_TARGETS</b>, <b>$TARGET</b>, <b>$TARGETS</b>, <b>$SOURCE</b>, <b>$SOURCES</b>, <b>$UNCHANGED_SOURCES</b> or <b>$UNCHANGED_TARGETS</b>.
               These warnings are disabled by default.

           <b>stack-size</b>
               Warnings about requests to set the stack size that could not be honored. These warnings are
               enabled by default.

           <b>target_not_build</b>
               Warnings about a build rule not building the expected targets. These warnings are disabled by
               default.

       <b>-Y</b> <u>repository</u>, <b>--repository=</b><u>repository</u>, <b>--srcdir=</b><u>repository</u>
           Search the specified <u>repository</u> for any input and target files not found in the local directory
           hierarchy. Multiple <b>-Y</b> options may be specified, in which case the repositories are searched in the
           order specified.

</pre><h4><b>SCONSCRIPT</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>REFERENCE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>SConscript</b> <b>Files</b>
       The build configuration is described by one or more files, known as SConscript files. There must be at
       least one file for a valid build (<b>scons</b> will quit if it does not find one).  <b>scons</b> by default looks for
       this file by the name SConstruct in the directory from which you run <b>scons</b>, though if necessary, also
       looks for alternative file names Sconstruct, sconstruct, SConstruct.py, Sconstruct.py and sconstruct.py
       in that order. A different file name (which can include a pathname part) may be specified via the <b>-f</b>
       option. Except for the SConstruct file, these files are not searched for automatically; you add
       additional configuration files to the build by calling the <b>SConscript</b> function. This allows parts of the
       build to be conditionally included or excluded at run-time depending on how <b>scons</b> is invoked.

       Each SConscript file in a build configuration is invoked independently in a separate context. This
       provides necessary isolation so that different parts of the build don't accidentally step on each other.
       You have to be explicit about sharing information, by using the <b>Export</b> function or the <u>exports</u> argument
       to the <b>SConscript</b> function, as well as the <b>Return</b> function in a called SConscript file, and comsume
       shared information by using the <b>Import</b> function.

       The following sections describe the various SCons facilities that can be used in SConscript files. Quick
       links:
           Construction Environments
           Tools
           Builder Methods
           Methods and Functions to do Things
           SConscript Variables
           Construction Variables
           Configure Contexts
           Command-Line Construction Variables
           Node Objects

   <b>Construction</b> <b>Environments</b>
       A Construction Environment is the basic means by which you communicate build information to SCons. A new
       construction environment is created using the <b>Environment</b> function:

           env = Environment()

       Construction environment attributes called Construction Variables may be set either by specifying them as
       keyword arguments when the object is created or by assigning them a value after the object is created.
       These two are nominally equivalent:

           env = Environment(FOO='foo')
           env['FOO'] = 'foo'

       Note that certain settings which affect tool detection are referenced only when the tools are
       initializided, so you either need either to supply them as part of the call to <b>Environment</b>, or defer tool
       initialization. For example, initializing the Microsoft Visual C++ version you wish to use:

           # initializes msvc to v14.1
           env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION="14.1")

           env = Environment()
           # msvc tool was initialized to default, does not reinitialize
           env['MSVC_VERSION'] = "14.1"

           env = Environment(tools=[])
           env['MSVC_VERSION'] = "14.1"
           # msvc tool initialization was deferred, so will pick up new value
           env.Tool('default')

       As a convenience, construction variables may also be set or modified by the <u>parse_flags</u> keyword argument
       during object creation, which has the effect of the <b>env.MergeFlags</b> method being applied to the argument
       value after all other processing is completed. This is useful either if the exact content of the flags is
       unknown (for example, read from a control file) or if the flags need to be distributed to a number of
       construction variables.  <b>env.ParseFlags</b> describes how these arguments are distributed to construction
       variables.

           env = Environment(parse_flags='-Iinclude -DEBUG -lm')

       This example adds 'include' to the <b>$CPPPATH</b> construction variable, 'EBUG' to <b>$CPPDEFINES</b>, and 'm' to
       <b>$LIBS</b>.

       An existing construction environment can be duplicated by calling the <b>env.Clone</b> method. Without
       arguments, it will be a copy with the same settings. Otherwise, <b>env.Clone</b> takes the same arguments as
       <b>Environment</b>, and uses the arguments to create a modified copy.

       SCons provides a special construction environment called the Default Environment. The default environment
       is used only for global functions, that is, construction activities called without the context of a
       regular construction environment. See <b>DefaultEnvironment</b> for more information.

       By default, a new construction environment is initialized with a set of builder methods and construction
       variables that are appropriate for the current platform. The optional <u>platform</u> keyword argument may be
       used to specify that the construction environment should be initialized for a different platform:

           env = Environment(platform='cygwin')

       Specifying a platform initializes the appropriate construction variables in the environment to use and
       generate file names with prefixes and suffixes appropriate for that platform.

       Note that the win32 platform adds the <u>SystemDrive</u> and <u>SystemRoot</u> variables from the user's external
       environment to the construction environment's <u>ENV</u> dictionary. This is so that any executed commands that
       use sockets to connect with other systems will work on Windows systems.

       The <u>platform</u> argument may be a string value representing one of the pre-defined platforms (aix, cygwin,
       darwin, hpux, irix, os2, posix, sunos or win32), or it may be be a callable platform object returned by a
       call to <b>Platform</b> selecting a pre-defined platform, or it may be a user-supplied callable, in which case
       the <b>Environment</b> method will call it to update the new construction environment:

           def my_platform(env):
               env['VAR'] = 'xyzzy'

           env = Environment(platform=my_platform)

       Note that supplying a non-default platform or custom fuction for initialization may bypass settings that
       should happen for the host system and should be used with care. It is most useful in the case where the
       platform is an alternative for the one that would be auto-detected, such as platform="cygwin" on a system
       which would otherwise identify as win32.

       The optional <u>tools</u> and <u>toolpath</u> keyword arguments affect the way tools available to the environment are
       initialized. See the section called “Tools” for details.

       The optional <u>variables</u> keyword argument allows passing a Variables object which will be used in the
       initialization of the construction environment See the section called “Command-Line Construction
       Variables” for details.

   <b>Tools</b>
       SCons has a large number of predefined tool modules (more properly, tool specification modules) which are
       used to help initialize the construction environment. An SCons tool is only responsible for setup. For
       example, if an SConscript file declares the need to construct an object file from a C-language source
       file by calling the <b>Object</b> builder, then a tool representing an available C compiler needs to have run
       first, to set up that builder and all the construction variables it needs in the associated construction
       environment; the tool itself is not called in the process of the build. Normally this happens invisibly
       as <b>scons</b> has per-platform lists of default tools, and it steps through those tools, calling the ones
       which are actually applicable, skipping those where necessary programs are not installed on the build
       system, or other preconditions are not met.

       A specific set of tools with which to initialize an environment when creating it may be specified using
       the optional keyword argument <u>tools</u>, which takes a list of tool names. This is useful to override the
       defaults, to specify non-default built-in tools, and to supply added tools:

           env = Environment(tools=['msvc', 'lex'])

       Tools can also be directly called by using the <b>Tool</b> method (see below).

       The <u>tools</u> argument overrides the default tool list, it does not add to it, so be sure to include all the
       tools you need. For example if you are building a c/c++ program you must specify a tool for at least a
       compiler and a linker, as in tools=['clang', 'link']. The tool name 'default' can be used to retain the
       default list.

       If no <u>tools</u> argument is specified, or if <u>tools</u> includes 'default', then <b>scons</b> will auto-detect usable
       tools, using the execution environment value of <u>PATH</u> (that is, <u>env['ENV']['PATH']</u> - the external
       evironment <b>PATH</b> from <u>os.environ</u> is <u>not</u> used) for looking up any backing programs, and the platform name
       in effect to determine the default tools for that platform. Changing the <u>PATH</u> variable after the
       construction environment is constructed will not cause the tools to be re-detected.

       Additional tools can be added, see the Extending SCons section and specifically Tool Modules.

       default
           Sets construction variables for a default list of Tool modules. Use <b>default</b> in the tools list to
           retain the original defaults, since the <u>tools</u> parameter is treated as a literal statement of the
           tools to be made available in that construction environment, not an addition.

           The list of tools selected by default is not static, but is dependent both on the platform and on the
           software installed on the platform. Some tools will not initialize if an underlying command is not
           found, and some tools are selected from a list of choices on a first-found basis. The finished tool
           list can be examined by inspecting the <b>$TOOLS</b> construction variable in the construction environment.

           On all platforms, the tools from the following list are selected if their respective conditions are
           met: filesystem;, wix, lex, yacc, rpcgen, swig, jar, javac, javah, rmic, dvipdf, dvips, gs, tex,
           latex, pdflatex, pdftex, tar, zip, textfile.

           On Linux systems, the default tools list selects (first-found): a C compiler from gcc, intelc, icc,
           cc; a C++ compiler from g++, intelc, icc, cXX; an assembler from gas, nasm, masm; a linker from

       dmd
           Sets construction variables for D language compiler DMD.

       docbook
           This tool tries to make working with Docbook in SCons a little easier. It provides several toolchains
           for creating different output formats, like HTML or PDF. Contained in the package is a distribution
           of the Docbook XSL stylesheets as of version 1.76.1. As long as you don't specify your own
           stylesheets for customization, these official versions are picked as default...which should reduce
           the inevitable setup hassles for you.

           Implicit dependencies to images and XIncludes are detected automatically if you meet the HTML
           requirements. The additional stylesheet utils/xmldepend.xsl by Paul DuBois is used for this purpose.

           Note, that there is no support for XML catalog resolving offered! This tool calls the XSLT processors
           and PDF renderers with the stylesheets you specified, that's it. The rest lies in your hands and you
           still have to know what you're doing when resolving names via a catalog.

           For activating the tool "docbook", you have to add its name to the Environment constructor, like this

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])

           On its startup, the docbook tool tries to find a required xsltproc processor, and a PDF renderer,
           e.g.  fop. So make sure that these are added to your system's environment <b>PATH</b> and can be called
           directly without specifying their full path.

           For the most basic processing of Docbook to HTML, you need to have installed

           •   the Python lxml binding to libxml2, or

           •   a standalone XSLT processor, currently detected are xsltproc, saxon, saxon-xslt and xalan.

           Rendering to PDF requires you to have one of the applications fop or xep installed.

           Creating a HTML or PDF document is very simple and straightforward. Say

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookHtml('manual.html', 'manual.xml')
               env.DocbookPdf('manual.pdf', 'manual.xml')

           to get both outputs from your XML source manual.xml. As a shortcut, you can give the stem of the
           filenames alone, like this:

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookHtml('manual')
               env.DocbookPdf('manual')

           and get the same result. Target and source lists are also supported:

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookHtml(['manual.html','reference.html'], ['manual.xml','reference.xml'])

           or even

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookHtml(['manual','reference'])

               <b>Important</b>
               Whenever you leave out the list of sources, you may not specify a file extension! The Tool uses
               the given names as file stems, and adds the suffixes for target and source files accordingly.
           The rules given above are valid for the Builders <b>DocbookHtml</b>, <b>DocbookPdf</b>, <b>DocbookEpub</b>,
           <b>DocbookSlidesPdf</b> and <b>DocbookXInclude</b>. For the <b>DocbookMan</b> transformation you can specify a target
           name, but the actual output names are automatically set from the refname entries in your XML source.

           The Builders <b>DocbookHtmlChunked</b>, <b>DocbookHtmlhelp</b> and <b>DocbookSlidesHtml</b> are special, in that:

            1. they create a large set of files, where the exact names and their number depend on the content of
               the source file, and

            2. the main target is always named index.html, i.e. the output name for the XSL transformation is
               not picked up by the stylesheets.

           As a result, there is simply no use in specifying a target HTML name. So the basic syntax for these
           builders is always:

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookHtmlhelp('manual')

           If you want to use a specific XSL file, you can set the additional <u>xsl</u> parameter to your Builder call
           as follows:

               env.DocbookHtml('other.html', 'manual.xml', xsl='html.xsl')

           Since this may get tedious if you always use the same local naming for your customized XSL files,
           e.g.  html.xsl for HTML and pdf.xsl for PDF output, a set of variables for setting the default XSL
           name is provided. These are:

               DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTML
               DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTMLCHUNKED
               DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTMLHELP
               DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_PDF
               DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_EPUB
               DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_MAN
               DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_SLIDESPDF
               DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_SLIDESHTML

           and you can set them when constructing your environment:

               env = Environment(
                   tools=['docbook'],
                   DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTML='html.xsl',
                   DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_PDF='pdf.xsl',
               )
               env.DocbookHtml('manual')  # now uses html.xsl

       gettext
           This is actually a toolset, which supports internationalization and localization of software being
           constructed with SCons. The toolset loads following tools:

           •    xgettext - to extract internationalized messages from source code to POT file(s),

           •    msginit - may be optionally used to initialize PO files,

           •    msgmerge - to update PO files, that already contain translated messages,

           •    msgfmt - to compile textual PO file to binary installable MO file.

           When you enable gettext, it internally loads all abovementioned tools, so you're encouraged to see
           their individual documentation.

           Each of the above tools provides its own builder(s) which may be used to perform particular
           activities related to software internationalization. You may be however interested in <u>top-level</u>
           <b>Translate</b> builder.

       qt
           Placeholder tool to alert anyone still using qt tools to switch to qt3 or newer tool.

       qt3
           Sets construction variables for building Qt3 applications.

               <b>Note</b>
               This tool is only suitable for building targeted to Qt3, which is obsolete (<u>the</u> <u>tool</u> <u>is</u>
               <u>deprecated</u> <u>since</u> <u>4.3,</u> <u>and</u> <u>was</u> <u>renamed</u> <u>to</u> <u>qt3</u> <u>in</u> <u>4.5.0.</u> ). There are contributed tools for Qt4 and
               Qt5, see <b>https://github.com/SCons/scons-contrib</b>[1]. Qt4 has also passed end of life for standard
               support (in Dec 2015).
           Note paths for these construction variables are assembled using the <b>os.path.join</b> method so they will
           have the appropriate separator at runtime, but are listed here in the various entries only with the
           '/' separator for simplicity.

           In addition, the construction variables <b>$CPPPATH</b>, <b>$LIBPATH</b> and <b>$LIBS</b> may be modified and the
           variables <b>$PROGEMITTER</b>, <b>$SHLIBEMITTER</b> and <b>$LIBEMITTER</b> are modified. Because the build-performance is
           affected when using this tool, you have to explicitly specify it at Environment creation:

               Environment(tools=['default','qt3'])

           The qt3 tool supports the following operations:

           <b>Automatic</b> <b>moc</b> <b>file</b> <b>generation</b> <b>from</b> <b>header</b> <b>files.</b>  You do not have to specify moc files explicitly,
           the tool does it for you. However, there are a few preconditions to do so: Your header file must have
           the same filebase as your implementation file and must stay in the same directory. It must have one
           of the suffixes .h, .hpp, .H, .hxx, .hh. You can turn off automatic moc file generation by setting
           <b>$QT3_AUTOSCAN</b> to <b>False</b>. See also the corresponding <b>Moc</b> Builder.

           <b>Automatic</b> <b>moc</b> <b>file</b> <b>generation</b> <b>from</b> <b>C++</b> <b>files.</b>  As described in the Qt documentation, include the moc
           file at the end of the C++ file. Note that you have to include the file, which is generated by the
           transformation ${QT3_MOCCXXPREFIX}&lt;basename&gt;${QT3_MOCCXXSUFFIX}, by default &lt;basename&gt;.mo. A warning
           is generated after building the moc file if you do not include the correct file. If you are using
           <b>VariantDir</b>, you may need to specify <u>duplicate=True</u>. You can turn off automatic moc file generation by
           setting <b>$QT3_AUTOSCAN</b> to False. See also the corresponding <b>Moc</b> Builder.

           <b>Automatic</b> <b>handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>.ui</b> <b>files.</b>  The implementation files generated from .ui files are handled much
           the same as yacc or lex files. Each <b>.ui</b> file given as a source of <b>Program</b>, <b>Library</b> or <b>SharedLibrary</b>
           will generate three files: the declaration file, the implementation file and a moc file. Because
           there are also generated headers, you may need to specify <u>duplicate=True</u> in calls to <b>VariantDir</b>. See
           also the corresponding <b>Uic</b> Builder.

   <b>Builder</b> <b>Methods</b>
       You tell SCons what to build by calling Builders, functions which take particular action(s) to produce
       target(s) of a particular type (conventionally hinted at by the builder name, e.g.  <b>Program</b>) from the
       specified source files. A builder call is a declaration: SCons enters the specified relationship into its
       internal dependency node graph, and only later makes the decision on whether anything is actually built,
       since this depends on command-line options, target selection rules, and whether the target(s) are out of
       date with respect to the sources.

       SCons provides a number of builders, and you can also write your own (see Builder Objects). Builders are
       created dynamically at run-time, often (though not always) by tools which determine whether the external
       dependencies for the builder are satisfied, and which perform the necessary setup (see Tools). Builders
       are attached to a construction environment as methods. The available builder methods are registered as
       key-value pairs in the <b>$BUILDERS</b> attribute of the construction environment, so the available builders can
       be examined. This example displays them for debugging purposes:

           env = Environment()
           print("Builders:", list(env['BUILDERS']))

       Builder methods take two required arguments: <u>target</u> and <u>source</u>. The <u>target</u> and <u>source</u> arguments can be
       specified either as positional arguments, in which case <u>target</u> comes first, or as keyword arguments,
       using <u>target=</u> and <u>source=</u>. Although both arguments are nominally required, if there is a single source
       and the target can be inferred the <u>target</u> argument can be omitted (see below). Builder methods also take
       a variety of keyword arguments, described below.

       Because long lists of file names can lead to a lot of quoting in a builder call, SCons supplies a <b>Split</b>
       global function and a same-named environment method that splits a single string into a list, using
       strings of white-space characters as the delimiter (similar to the Python string <b>split</b> method, but
       succeeds even if the input isn't a string).

       The following are equivalent examples of calling the <b>Program</b> builder method:

           env.Program('bar', ['bar.c', 'foo.c'])
           env.Program('bar', Split('bar.c foo.c'))
           env.Program('bar', env.Split('bar.c foo.c'))
           env.Program(source=['bar.c', 'foo.c'], target='bar')
           env.Program(target='bar', source=Split('bar.c foo.c'))
           env.Program(target='bar', source=env.Split('bar.c foo.c'))
           env.Program('bar', source='bar.c foo.c'.split())

       Sources and targets can be specified as a scalar or as a list, composed of either strings or nodes (more
       on nodes below). When specifying path strings, Python follows the POSIX pathname convention: if a string
       begins with the operating system pathname separator (on Windows both the slash and backslash separator
       are accepted, and any leading drive specifier is ignored for the determination) it is considered an
       absolute path, otherwise it is a relative path. If the path string contains no separator characters, it
       is searched for as a file in the current directory. If it contains separator characters, the search
       follows down from the starting point, which is the top of the directory tree for an absolute path and the
       current directory for a relative path. The "current directory" in this context is the directory of the
       SConscript file currently being processed.

       SCons also recognizes a third way to specify path strings: if the string begins with the <b>#</b> character it
       is top-relative - it works like a relative path but the search follows down from the directory containing
       the top-level SConstruct rather than from the current directory. The <b>#</b> can optionally be followed by a
       pathname separator, which is ignored if found in that position. Top-relative paths only work in places
       where <b>scons</b> will interpret the path (see some examples below). To be used in other contexts the string
       will need to be converted to a relative or absolute path first.

       Examples:

           # The comments describing the targets that will be built
           # assume these calls are in a SConscript file in the
           # a subdirectory named "subdir".

           # Builds the program "subdir/foo" from "subdir/foo.c":
           env.Program('foo', 'foo.c')

           # Builds the program "/tmp/bar" from "subdir/bar.c":
           env.Program('/tmp/bar', 'bar.c')

           # An initial '#' or '#/' are equivalent; the following
           # calls build the programs "foo" and "bar" (in the
           # top-level SConstruct directory) from "subdir/foo.c" and
           # "subdir/bar.c", respectively:
           env.Program('#foo', 'foo.c')
           env.Program('#/bar', 'bar.c')

           # Builds the program "other/foo" (relative to the top-level
           # SConstruct directory) from "subdir/foo.c":
           env.Program('#other/foo', 'foo.c')

           # This will not work, only SCons interfaces understand '#',
           # os.path.exists is pure Python:
           if os.path.exists('#inc/foo.h'):
               env.Append(CPPPATH='#inc')

       When the target shares the same base name as the source and only the suffix varies, and if the builder
       method has a suffix defined for the target file type, then the target argument may be omitted completely,
       and <b>scons</b> will deduce the target file name from the source file name. The following examples all build
       the executable program <b>bar</b> (on POSIX systems) or <b>bar.exe</b> (on Windows systems) from the bar.c source file:

           env.Program(target='bar', source='bar.c')
           env.Program('bar', source='bar.c')
           env.Program(source='bar.c')
           env.Program('bar.c')

       The optional <u>srcdir</u> keyword argument specifies that all source file strings that are not absolute paths
       or top-relative paths shall be interpreted relative to the specified <u>srcdir</u>. The following example will
       build the build/prog (or build/prog.exe on Windows) program from the files src/f1.c and src/f2.c:

           env.Program('build/prog', ['f1.c', 'f2.c'], srcdir='src')

       The optional <u>parse_flags</u> keyword argument causes behavior similar to the <b>env.MergeFlags</b> method, where the
       argument value is broken into individual settings and merged into the appropriate construction variables.

           env.Program('hello', 'hello.c', parse_flags='-Iinclude -DEBUG -lm')

       This example adds 'include' to the <b>$CPPPATH</b> construction variable, 'EBUG' to <b>$CPPDEFINES</b>, and 'm' to
       <b>$LIBS</b>.

       The optional <u>chdir</u> keyword argument specifies that the Builder's action(s) should be executed after
       changing directory. If the <u>chdir</u> argument is a path string or a directory Node, scons will change to the
       specified directory. If the <u>chdir</u> is not a string or Node and evaluates true, then <b>scons</b> will change to
       the target file's directory.

           <b>Warning</b>

           Python only keeps one current directory location even if there are multiple threads. This means that
           use of the <u>chdir</u> argument will <u>not</u> work with the SCons <b>-j</b> option, because individual worker threads
           spawned by SCons interfere with each other when they start changing directory.

           # scons will change to the "sub" subdirectory
           # before executing the "cp" command.
           env.Command(
               target='sub/dir/foo.out',
               source='sub/dir/foo.in',
               action="cp dir/foo.in dir/foo.out",
               chdir='sub',
           )

           # Because chdir is not a string, scons will change to the
           # target's directory ("sub/dir") before executing the
           # "cp" command.
           env.Command('sub/dir/foo.out', 'sub/dir/foo.in', "cp foo.in foo.out", chdir=True)

       Note that SCons will <u>not</u> automatically modify its expansion of construction variables like <b>$TARGET</b> and
       <b>$SOURCE</b> when using the <u>chdir</u> keyword argument--that is, the expanded file names will still be relative to
       the top-level directory where the SConstruct was found, and consequently incorrect relative to the chdir
       directory. If you use the <u>chdir</u> keyword argument, you will typically need to supply a different command
       line using expansions like ${TARGET.file} and ${SOURCE.file} to use just the filename portion of the
       target and source.

       Keyword arguments that are not specifically recognized are treated as construction variable overrides,
       which replace or add those variables on a limited basis. These overrides will only be in effect when
       building the target of the builder call, and will not affect other parts of the build. For example, if
       you want to specify some libraries needed by just one program:

           env.Program('hello', 'hello.c', LIBS=['gl', 'glut'])

       or generate a shared library with a non-standard suffix:

           env.SharedLibrary(
               target='word',
               source='word.cpp',
               SHLIBSUFFIX='.ocx',
               LIBSUFFIXES=['.ocx'],
           )

       Note that both the <b>$SHLIBSUFFIX</b> and <b>$LIBSUFFIXES</b> construction variables must be set if you want <b>scons</b> to
       search automatically for dependencies on the non-standard library names; see the descriptions of these
       variables for more information.

       Although the builder methods defined by <b>scons</b> are, in fact, methods of a construction environment object,
       many may also be called without an explicit environment:

           Program('hello', 'hello.c')
           SharedLibrary('word', 'word.cpp')

       If called this way, the builder will internally use the Default Environment that consists of the tools
       and values that <b>scons</b> has determined are appropriate for the local system.

       Builder methods that can be called without an explicit environment (indicated in the listing of builders
       below without a leading <u>env.</u>) may be called from custom Python modules that you import into an SConscript
       file by adding the following to the Python module:

           from SCons.Script import *

       A builder <u>may</u> add additional targets beyond those requested if an attached Emitter chooses to do so (see
       the section called “Builder Objects” for more information.  <b>$PROGEMITTER</b> is an example). For example, the
       GNU linker takes a command-line argument <b>-Map=</b><u>mapfile</u>, which causes it to produce a linker map file in
       addition to the executable file actually being linked. If the <b>Program</b> builder's emitter is configured to
       add this mapfile if the option is set, then two targets will be returned when you only provided for one.

       For this reason, builder methods always return a NodeList, a list-like object whose elements are Nodes.
       Nodes are the internal representation of build targets or sources (see the section called “Node Objects”
       for more information). The returned NodeList object can be passed to other builder methods as source(s)
       or to other SCons functions or methods where a path string would normally be accepted.

       For example, to add a specific preprocessor define when compiling one specific object file but not the
       others:

           bar_obj_list = env.StaticObject('bar.c', CPPDEFINES='-DBAR')
           env.Program("prog", ['foo.c', bar_obj_list, 'main.c'])

       Using a Node as in this example makes for a more portable build by avoiding having to specify a
       platform-specific object suffix when calling the <b>Program</b> builder method.

       The NodeList object is also convenient to pass to the <b>Default</b> function, for the same reason of avoiding a
       platform-specific name:

           tgt = env.Program("prog", ["foo.c", "bar.c", "main.c"])
           Default(tgt)

       Builder calls will automatically "flatten" lists passed as source and target, so they are free to contain
       elements which are themselves lists, such as <u>bar_obj_list</u> returned by the <b>StaticObject</b> call. If you need
       to manipulate a list of lists returned by builders directly in Python code, you can either build a new
       list by hand:

           foo = Object('foo.c')
           bar = Object('bar.c')
           objects = ['begin.o'] + foo + ['middle.o'] + bar + ['end.o']
           for obj in objects:
               print(str(obj))

       Or you can use the <b>Flatten</b> function supplied by SCons to create a list containing just the Nodes, which
       may be more convenient:

           foo = Object('foo.c')
           bar = Object('bar.c')
           objects = Flatten(['begin.o', foo, 'middle.o', bar, 'end.o'])
           for obj in objects:
               print(str(obj))

       Since builder calls return a list-like object, not an actual Python list, it is not appropriate to use
       the Python add operator (+ or +=) to append builder results to a Python list. Because the list and the
       object are different types, Python will not update the original list in place, but will instead create a
       new NodeList object containing the concatenation of the list elements and the builder results. This will
       cause problems for any other Python variables in your SCons configuration that still hold on to a
       reference to the original list. Instead, use the Python list <b>extend</b> method to make sure the list is
       updated in-place. Example:

           object_files = []

           # Do NOT use += here:
           #    object_files += Object('bar.c')
           #
           # It will not update the object_files list in place.
           #
           # Instead, use the list extend method:
           object_files.extend(Object('bar.c'))

       The path name for a Node's file may be used by passing the Node to Python's builtin <b>str</b> function:

           bar_obj_list = env.StaticObject('bar.c', CPPDEFINES='-DBAR')
           print("The path to bar_obj is:", str(bar_obj_list[0]))

       Note that because the Builder call returns a NodeList, you have to access the first element in the list
       (bar_obj_list[0] in the example) to get at the Node that actually represents the object file.

       When trying to handle errors that may occur in a builder method, consider that the corresponding Action
       is executed at a different time than the SConscript file statement calling the builder. It is not useful
       to wrap a builder call in a try block, since success in the builder call is not the same as the builder
       itself succeeding. If necessary, a Builder's Action should be coded to exit with a useful exception
       message indicating the problem in the SConscript files - programmatically recovering from build errors is
       rarely useful.

       The following builder methods are predefined in the SCons core software distribution. Depending on the
       setup of a particular construction environment and on the type and software installation status of the
       underlying system, not all builders may be available in that construction environment. Since the function
       calling signature is the same for all builders:

           <b>Buildername</b>(<u>target,</u> <u>source,</u> <u>[key=val,</u> <u>...]</u>)

       it is omitted in this listing for brevity.

       <b>CFile</b>(), <u>env</u>.CFile()
           Builds a C source file given a lex (.l) or yacc (.y) input file. The suffix specified by the
           <b>$CFILESUFFIX</b> construction variable (.c by default) is automatically added to the target if it is not
           already present. Example:

               # builds foo.c
               env.CFile(target = 'foo.c', source = 'foo.l')
               # builds bar.c
               env.CFile(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.y')

       <b>Command</b>(), <u>env</u>.Command()
           The <b>Command</b> "Builder" is actually a function that looks like a Builder, but takes a required third
           argument, which is the action to take to construct the target from the source, used for "one-off"
           builds where a full builder is not needed. Thus it does not follow the builder calling rules
           described at the start of this section. See instead the <b>Command</b> function description for the calling
           syntax and details.

       <b>CompilationDatabase</b>(), <u>env</u>.CompilationDatabase()

           <b>CompilationDatabase</b> is a special builder which adds a target to create a JSON formatted compilation
           database compatible with clang tooling (see the <b>LLVM</b> <b>specification</b>[2]). This database is suitable for
           consumption by various tools and editors who can use it to obtain build and dependency information
           which otherwise would be internal to SCons. The builder does not require any source files to be
           specified, rather it arranges to emit information about all of the C, C++ and assembler source/output
           pairs identified in the build that are not excluded by the optional filter
           <b>$COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER</b>. The target is subject to the usual SCons target selection rules.

           If called with no arguments, the builder will default to a target name of compile_commands.json.

           If called with a single positional argument, <b>scons</b> will "deduce" the target name from that source
           argument, giving it the same name, and then ignore the source. This is the usual way to call the
           builder if a non-default target name is wanted.

           If called with either the <u>target=</u> or <u>source=</u> keyword arguments, the value of the argument is taken as
           the target name. If called with both, the <u>target=</u> value is used and <u>source=</u> is ignored. If called
           with multiple sources, the source list will be ignored, since there is no way to deduce what the
           intent was; in this case the default target name will be used.

               <b>Note</b>
               You must load the compilation_db tool prior to specifying any part of your build or some
               source/output files will not show up in the compilation database.
           <u>Available</u> <u>since</u> <b>scons</b> <u>4.0.</u>

       <b>CXXFile</b>(), <u>env</u>.CXXFile()
           Builds a C++ source file given a lex (.ll) or yacc (.yy) input file. The suffix specified by the
           <b>$CXXFILESUFFIX</b> construction variable (.cc by default) is automatically added to the target if it is
           not already present. Example:

               # builds foo.cc
               env.CXXFile(target = 'foo.cc', source = 'foo.ll')
               # builds bar.cc
               env.CXXFile(target = 'bar', source = 'bar.yy')

       <b>DocbookEpub</b>(), <u>env</u>.DocbookEpub()
           A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for EPUB output.

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookEpub('manual.epub', 'manual.xml')

           or simply

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookEpub('manual')

       <b>DocbookHtml</b>(), <u>env</u>.DocbookHtml()
           A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for HTML output.

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookHtml('manual.html', 'manual.xml')

           or simply

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookHtml('manual')

       <b>DocbookHtmlChunked</b>(), <u>env</u>.DocbookHtmlChunked()
           A pseudo-Builder providing a Docbook toolchain for chunked HTML output. It supports the <u>base.dir</u>
           parameter. The chunkfast.xsl file (requires "EXSLT") is used as the default stylesheet. Basic syntax:

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookHtmlChunked('manual')

           where manual.xml is the input file.

           If you use the <u>root.filename</u> parameter in your own stylesheets you have to specify the new target
           name. This ensures that the dependencies get correct, especially for the cleanup via “scons -c”:

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookHtmlChunked('mymanual.html', 'manual', xsl='htmlchunk.xsl')

           Some basic support for the <u>base.dir</u> parameter is provided. You can add the <u>base_dir</u> keyword to your
           Builder call, and the given prefix gets prepended to all the created filenames:

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookHtmlChunked('manual', xsl='htmlchunk.xsl', base_dir='output/')

           Make sure that you don't forget the trailing slash for the base folder, else your files get renamed
           only!

       <b>DocbookHtmlhelp</b>(), <u>env</u>.DocbookHtmlhelp()
           A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for HTMLHELP output. Its basic syntax is:

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookHtmlhelp('manual')

           where manual.xml is the input file.

           If you use the <u>root.filename</u> parameter in your own stylesheets you have to specify the new target
           name. This ensures that the dependencies get correct, especially for the cleanup via “<b>scons</b> <b>-c</b>”:

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookHtmlhelp('mymanual.html', 'manual', xsl='htmlhelp.xsl')

           Some basic support for the <u>base.dir</u> parameter is provided. You can add the <u>base_dir</u> keyword to your
           Builder call, and the given prefix gets prepended to all the created filenames:

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookHtmlhelp('manual', xsl='htmlhelp.xsl', base_dir='output/')

           Make sure that you don't forget the trailing slash for the base folder, else your files get renamed
           only!

       <b>DocbookMan</b>(), <u>env</u>.DocbookMan()
           A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for Man page output. Its basic syntax is:

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookMan('manual')

           where manual.xml is the input file. Note, that you can specify a target name, but the actual output
           names are automatically set from the refname entries in your XML source.

       <b>DocbookPdf</b>(), <u>env</u>.DocbookPdf()
           A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for PDF output.

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookPdf('manual.pdf', 'manual.xml')

           or simply

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookPdf('manual')

       <b>DocbookSlidesHtml</b>(), <u>env</u>.DocbookSlidesHtml()
           A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for HTML slides output.

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookSlidesHtml('manual')

           If you use the <u>titlefoil.html</u> parameter in your own stylesheets you have to give the new target name.
           This ensures that the dependencies get correct, especially for the cleanup via “<b>scons</b> <b>-c</b>”:

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookSlidesHtml('mymanual.html','manual', xsl='slideshtml.xsl')

           Some basic support for the <u>base.dir</u> parameter is provided. You can add the <u>base_dir</u> keyword to your
           Builder call, and the given prefix gets prepended to all the created filenames:

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookSlidesHtml('manual', xsl='slideshtml.xsl', base_dir='output/')

           Make sure that you don't forget the trailing slash for the base folder, else your files get renamed
           only!

       <b>DocbookSlidesPdf</b>(), <u>env</u>.DocbookSlidesPdf()
           A pseudo-Builder, providing a Docbook toolchain for PDF slides output.

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookSlidesPdf('manual.pdf', 'manual.xml')

           or simply

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookSlidesPdf('manual')

       <b>DocbookXInclude</b>(), <u>env</u>.DocbookXInclude()
           A pseudo-Builder, for resolving XIncludes in a separate processing step.

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookXInclude('manual_xincluded.xml', 'manual.xml')

       <b>DocbookXslt</b>(), <u>env</u>.DocbookXslt()
           A pseudo-Builder, applying a given XSL transformation to the input file.

               env = Environment(tools=['docbook'])
               env.DocbookXslt('manual_transformed.xml', 'manual.xml', xsl='transform.xslt')

           Note, that this builder requires the <u>xsl</u> parameter to be set.

       <b>DVI</b>(), <u>env</u>.DVI()
           Builds a .dvi file from a .tex, .ltx or .latex input file. If the source file suffix is .tex, <b>scons</b>
           will examine the contents of the file; if the string \documentclass or \documentstyle is found, the
           file is assumed to be a LaTeX file and the target is built by invoking the <b>$LATEXCOM</b> command line;
           otherwise, the <b>$TEXCOM</b> command line is used. If the file is a LaTeX file, the <b>DVI</b> builder method will
           also examine the contents of the .aux file and invoke the <b>$BIBTEX</b> command line if the string bibdata
           is found, start <b>$MAKEINDEX</b> to generate an index if a .ind file is found and will examine the contents
           .log file and re-run the <b>$LATEXCOM</b> command if the log file says it is necessary.

           The suffix .dvi (hard-coded within TeX itself) is automatically added to the target if it is not
           already present. Examples:

               # builds from aaa.tex
               env.DVI(target = 'aaa.dvi', source = 'aaa.tex')
               # builds bbb.dvi
               env.DVI(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.ltx')
               # builds from ccc.latex
               env.DVI(target = 'ccc.dvi', source = 'ccc.latex')

       <b>Gs</b>(), <u>env</u>.Gs()
           A Builder for explicitly calling the gs executable. Depending on the underlying OS, the different
           names gs, gsos2 and gswin32c are tried.

               env = Environment(tools=['gs'])
               env.Gs(
                   'cover.jpg',
                   'scons-scons.pdf',
                   GSFLAGS='-dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=jpeg -dFirstPage=1 -dLastPage=1 -q',
               )

       <b>Install</b>(), <u>env</u>.Install()
           Installs one or more source files or directories in the specified target, which must be a directory.
           The names of the specified source files or directories remain the same within the destination
           directory. The sources may be given as a string or as a node returned by a builder.

               env.Install(target='<a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>', source=['foo', 'bar'])

           Note that if target paths chosen for the <b>Install</b> builder (and the related <b>InstallAs</b> and
           <b>InstallVersionedLib</b> builders) are outside the project tree, such as in the example above, they may
           not be selected for "building" by default, since in the absence of other instructions <b>scons</b> builds
           targets that are underneath the top directory (the directory that contains the SConstruct file,
           usually the current directory). Use command line targets or the <b>Default</b> function in this case.

           If the <b>--install-sandbox</b> command line option is given, the target directory will be prefixed by the
           directory path specified. This is useful to test installs without installing to a "live" location in
           the system.

           See also <b>FindInstalledFiles</b>. For more thoughts on installation, see the User Guide (particularly the
           section on Command-Line Targets and the chapters on Installing Files and on Alias Targets).

       <b>InstallAs</b>(), <u>env</u>.InstallAs()
           Installs one or more source files or directories to specific names, allowing changing a file or
           directory name as part of the installation. It is an error if the target and source arguments list
           different numbers of files or directories.

               env.InstallAs(target='/usr/local/bin/foo',
                             source='foo_debug')
               env.InstallAs(target=['../lib/libfoo.a', '../lib/libbar.a'],
                             source=['libFOO.a', 'libBAR.a'])

           See the note under <b>Install</b>.

       <b>InstallVersionedLib</b>(), <u>env</u>.InstallVersionedLib()
           Installs a versioned shared library. The symlinks appropriate to the architecture will be generated
           based on symlinks of the source library.

               env.InstallVersionedLib(target='/usr/local/bin/foo',
                                       source='libxyz.1.5.2.so')

           See the note under <b>Install</b>.

       <b>Jar</b>(), <u>env</u>.Jar()
           Builds a Java archive (.jar) file from the specified list of sources. Any directories in the source
           list will be searched for .class files). Any .java files in the source list will be compiled to
           .class files by calling the <b>Java</b> Builder.

           If the <b>$JARCHDIR</b> value is set, the jar command will change to the specified directory using the <b>-C</b>
           option. If <b>$JARCHDIR</b> is not set explicitly, SCons will use the top of any subdirectory tree in which
           Java .class were built by the <b>Java</b> Builder.

           If the contents any of the source files begin with the string Manifest-Version, the file is assumed
           to be a manifest and is passed to the jar command with the <b>m</b> option set.

               env.Jar(target = 'foo.jar', source = 'classes')

               env.Jar(target = 'bar.jar',
                       source = ['bar1.java', 'bar2.java'])

       <b>Java</b>(), <u>env</u>.Java()
           Builds one or more Java class files. The sources may be any combination of explicit .java files, or
           directory trees which will be scanned for .java files.

           SCons will parse each source .java file to find the classes (including inner classes) defined within
           that file, and from that figure out the target .class files that will be created. The class files
           will be placed underneath the specified target directory.

           SCons will also search each Java file for the Java package name, which it assumes can be found on a
           line beginning with the string package in the first column; the resulting .class files will be placed
           in a directory reflecting the specified package name. For example, the file Foo.java defining a
           single public Foo class and containing a package name of sub.dir will generate a corresponding
           sub/dir/Foo.class class file.

           Examples:

               env.Java(target='classes', source='src')
               env.Java(target='classes', source=['src1', 'src2'])
               env.Java(target='classes', source=['File1.java', 'File2.java'])

           Java source files can use the native encoding for the underlying OS. Since SCons compiles in simple
           ASCII mode by default, the compiler will generate warnings about unmappable characters, which may
           lead to errors as the file is processed further. In this case, the user must specify the LANG
           environment variable to tell the compiler what encoding is used. For portibility, it's best if the
           encoding is hard-coded so that the compile will work if it is done on a system with a different
           encoding.

               env = Environment()
               env['ENV']['LANG'] = 'en_GB.UTF-8'

       <b>JavaH</b>(), <u>env</u>.JavaH()
           Builds C header and source files for implementing Java native methods. The target can be either a
           directory in which the header files will be written, or a header file name which will contain all of
           the definitions. The source can be the names of .class files, the names of .java files to be compiled
           into .class files by calling the <b>Java</b> builder method, or the objects returned from the <b>Java</b> builder
           method.

           If the construction variable <b>$JAVACLASSDIR</b> is set, either in the environment or in the call to the
           <b>JavaH</b> builder method itself, then the value of the variable will be stripped from the beginning of
           any .class file names.

           Examples:

               # builds java_native.h
               classes = env.Java(target="classdir", source="src")
               env.JavaH(target="java_native.h", source=classes)

               # builds include/package_foo.h and include/package_bar.h
               env.JavaH(target="include", source=["package/foo.class", "package/bar.class"])

               # builds export/foo.h and export/bar.h
               env.JavaH(
                   target="export",
                   source=["classes/foo.class", "classes/bar.class"],
                   JAVACLASSDIR="classes",
               )

               <b>Note</b>
               Java versions starting with 10.0 no longer use the <b>javah</b> command for generating JNI
               headers/sources, and indeed have removed the command entirely (see Java Enhancement Proposal <b>JEP</b>
               <b>313</b>[3]), making this tool harder to use for that purpose.  SCons may autodiscover a <b>javah</b>
               belonging to an older release if there are multiple Java versions on the system, which will lead
               to incorrect results. To use with a newer Java, override the default values of <b>$JAVAH</b> (to contain
               the path to the <b>javac</b>) and <b>$JAVAHFLAGS</b> (to contain at least a <b>-h</b> flag) and note that generating
               headers with <b>javac</b> requires supplying source .java files only, not .class files.

       <b>Library</b>(), <u>env</u>.Library()
           A synonym for the <b>StaticLibrary</b> builder method.

       <b>LoadableModule</b>(), <u>env</u>.LoadableModule()
           On most systems, this is the same as <b>SharedLibrary</b>. On Mac OS X (Darwin) platforms, this creates a
           loadable module bundle.

       <b>M4</b>(), <u>env</u>.M4()
           Builds an output file from an M4 input file. This uses a default <b>$M4FLAGS</b> value of <b>-E</b>, which
           considers all warnings to be fatal and stops on the first warning when using the GNU version of m4.
           Example:

               env.M4(target = 'foo.c', source = 'foo.c.m4')

       <b>Moc</b>(), <u>env</u>.Moc()
           Builds an output file from a <b>moc</b> input file.  <b>moc</b> input files are either header files or C++ files.
           This builder is only available after using the tool qt3. See the <b>$QT3DIR</b> variable for more
           information. Example:

               env.Moc('foo.h')  # generates moc_foo.cc
               env.Moc('foo.cpp')  # generates foo.moc

       <b>MOFiles</b>(), <u>env</u>.MOFiles()
           This builder belongs to msgfmt tool. The builder compiles PO files to MO files.

           <u>Example</u> <u>1</u>. Create pl.mo and en.mo by compiling pl.po and en.po:

                 # ...
                 env.MOFiles(['pl', 'en'])

           <u>Example</u> <u>2</u>. Compile files for languages defined in LINGUAS file:

                 # ...
                 env.MOFiles(LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

           <u>Example</u> <u>3</u>. Create pl.mo and en.mo by compiling pl.po and en.po plus files for languages defined in
           LINGUAS file:

                 # ...
                 env.MOFiles(['pl', 'en'], LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

           <u>Example</u> <u>4</u>. Compile files for languages defined in LINGUAS file (another version):

                 # ...
                 env['LINGUAS_FILE'] = 1
                 env.MOFiles()

       <b>MSVSProject</b>(), <u>env</u>.MSVSProject()
           Build a Microsoft Visual C++ project file and solution file.

           Builds a C++ project file based on the version of Visual Studio (or to be more precise, of MSBuild)
           that is configured: either the latest installed version, or the version specified by <b>$MSVC_VERSION</b> in
           the current construction environment. For Visual Studio 6.0 a .dsp file is generated. For Visual
           Studio versions 2002-2008, a .vcproj file is generated. For Visual Studio 2010 and later a .vcxproj
           file is generated. Note there are multiple versioning schemes involved in the Microsoft compilation
           environment - see the description of <b>$MSVC_VERSION</b> for equivalences.  SCons does not know how to
           construct project files for other languages (such as .csproj for C#, .vbproj for Visual Basic or
           .pyproject for Python)).

           For the .vcxproj file, the underlying format is the MSBuild XML Schema, and the details conform to:
           <b>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/vcxproj-file-structure</b>[4]. The generated
           solution file enables Visual Studio to understand the project structure, and allows building it using
           MSBuild to call back to SCons. The project file encodes a toolset version that has been selected by
           SCons as described above. Since recent Visual Studio versions support multiple concurrent toolsets,
           use <b>$MSVC_VERSION</b> to select the desired one if it does not match the SCons default. The project file
           also includes entries which describe how to call SCons to build the project from within Visual Studio
           (or from an MSBuild command line). In some situations SCons may generate this incorrectly - notably
           when using the <u>scons-local</u> distribution, which is not installed in a way that that matches the
           default invocation line. If so, the <b>$SCONS_HOME</b> construction variable can be used to describe the
           right way to locate the SCons code so that it can be imported.

           By default, a matching solution file for the project is also generated. This behavior may be disabled
           by specifying <u>auto_build_solution=0</u> to the <b>MSVSProject</b> builder. The solution file can also be
           independently generated by calling the <b>MSVSSolution</b> builder, such as in the case where a solution
           should describe multiple projects. See the <b>MSVSSolution</b> description for further information.

           The <b>MSVSProject</b> builder accepts several keyword arguments describing lists of filenames to be placed
           into the project file. Currently, <u>srcs</u>, <u>incs</u>, <u>localincs</u>, <u>resources</u>, and <u>misc</u> are recognized. The
           names are intended to be self-explanatory, but note that the filenames need to be specified as
           strings, <u>not</u> as SCons File Nodes (for example if you generate files for inclusion by using the <b>Glob</b>
           function, the results should be converted to a list of strings before passing them to <b>MSVSProject</b>).
           This is because Visual Studio and MSBuild know nothing about SCons Node types. Each of the filename
           lists are individually optional, but at least one list must be specified for the resulting project
           file to be non-empty.

           In addition to the above lists of values, the following values may be specified as keyword arguments:

           <u>target</u>
               The name of the target .dsp or .vcproj file. The correct suffix for the version of Visual Studio
               must be used, but the <b>$MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX</b> construction variable will be defined to the correct
               value (see example below).

           <u>variant</u>
               The name of this particular variant. Except for Visual Studio 6 projects, this can also be a list
               of variant names. These are typically things like "Debug" or "Release", but really can be
               anything you want. For Visual Studio 7 projects, they may also specify a target platform
               separated from the variant name by a | (vertical pipe) character: Debug|Xbox. The default target
               platform is Win32. Multiple calls to <b>MSVSProject</b> with different variants are allowed; all
               variants will be added to the project file with their appropriate build targets and sources.

           <u>cmdargs</u>
               Additional command line arguments for the different variants. The number of <u>cmdargs</u> entries must
               match the number of <u>variant</u> entries, or be empty (not specified). If you give only one, it will
               automatically be propagated to all variants.

           <u>cppdefines</u>
               Preprocessor definitions for the different variants. The number of <u>cppdefines</u> entries must match
               the number of <u>variant</u> entries, or be empty (not specified). If you give only one, it will
               automatically be propagated to all variants. If you don't give this parameter, SCons will use the
               invoking environment's <b>$CPPDEFINES</b> entry for all variants.

           <u>cppflags</u>
               Compiler flags for the different variants. If a <b>/std:c++</b> flag is found then <b>/Zc:__cplusplus</b> is
               appended to the flags if not already found, this ensures that Intellisense uses the <b>/std:c++</b>
               switch. The number of <u>cppflags</u> entries must match the number of <u>variant</u> entries, or be empty (not
               specified). If you give only one, it will automatically be propagated to all variants. If you
               don't give this parameter, SCons will combine the invoking environment's <b>$CCFLAGS</b>, <b>$CXXFLAGS</b>,
               <b>$CPPFLAGS</b> entries for all variants.

           <u>cpppaths</u>
               Compiler include paths for the different variants. The number of <u>cpppaths</u> entries must match the
               number of <u>variant</u> entries, or be empty (not specified). If you give only one, it will
               automatically be propagated to all variants. If you don't give this parameter, SCons will use the
               invoking environment's <b>$CPPPATH</b> entry for all variants.

           <u>buildtarget</u>
               An optional string, node, or list of strings or nodes (one per build variant), to tell the Visual
               Studio debugger what output target to use in what build variant. The number of <u>buildtarget</u>
               entries must match the number of <u>variant</u> entries.

           <u>runfile</u>
               The name of the file that Visual Studio 7 and later will run and debug. This appears as the value
               of the <u>Output</u> field in the resulting Visual C++ project file. If this is not specified, the
               default is the same as the specified <u>buildtarget</u> value.

               <b>Note</b>

               SCons and Microsoft Visual Studio understand projects in different ways, and the mapping is
               sometimes imperfect:

               Because SCons always executes its build commands from the directory in which the SConstruct file
               is located, if you generate a project file in a different directory than the directory of the
               SConstruct file, users will not be able to double-click on the file name in compilation error
               messages displayed in the Visual Studio console output window. This can be remedied by adding the
               Visual C/C++ <b>/FC</b> compiler option to the <b>$CCFLAGS</b> variable so that the compiler will print the
               full path name of any files that cause compilation errors.

               If the project file is only used to teach the Visual Studio project browser about the file layout
               there should be no issues, However, Visual Studio should not be used to make changes to the
               project structure, build options, etc. as these will (a) not feed back to the SCons description
               of the project and (b) be lost if SCons regenerates the project file. The SConscript files should
               remain the definitive description of the build.

               If the project file is used to drive MSBuild (such as selecting "build" from the Visual Studio
               interface) you lose the direct control of target selection and command-line options you would
               have if launching the build directly from SCons, because these will be hardcoded in the project
               file to the values specified in the <b>MSVSProject</b> call. You can regain some of this control by
               defining multiple variants, using multiple <b>MSVSProject</b> calls to arrange different build targets,
               arguments, defines, flags and paths for different variants.

               If the build is divided into a solution with multiple MSBuild projects the mapping is further
               strained. In this case, it is important not to set Visual Studio to do parallel builds, as it
               will then launch the separate project builds in parallel, and SCons does not work well if called
               that way. Instead you can set up the SCons build for parallel building - see the <b>SetOption</b>
               function for how to do this with <u>num_jobs</u>.
           Example usage:

               barsrcs = ['bar.cpp']
               barincs = ['bar.h']
               barlocalincs = ['StdAfx.h']
               barresources = ['bar.rc', 'resource.h']
               barmisc = ['bar_readme.txt']

               dll = env.SharedLibrary(target='bar.dll', source=barsrcs)
               buildtarget = [s for s in dll if str(s).endswith('dll')]
               env.MSVSProject(
                   target='Bar' + env['MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX'],
                   srcs=barsrcs,
                   incs=barincs,
                   localincs=barlocalincs,
                   resources=barresources,
                   misc=barmisc,
                   buildtarget=buildtarget,
                   variant='Release',
               )

           <u>DebugSettings</u>
               A dictionary of debug settings that get written to the .vcproj.user or the .vcxproj.user file,
               depending on the version installed. As for <u>cmdargs</u>, you can specify a <u>DebugSettings</u> dictionary
               per variant. If you give only one, it will be propagated to all variants.

               <u>Changed</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>2.4:</u> Added the optional <u>DebugSettings</u> parameter.

           Currently, only Visual Studio v9.0 and Visual Studio version v11 are implemented, for other versions
           no file is generated. To generate the user file, you just need to add a <u>DebugSettings</u> dictionary to
           the environment with the right parameters for your MSVS version. If the dictionary is empty, or does
           not contain any good value, no file will be generated.

           Following is a more contrived example, involving the setup of a project for variants and
           DebugSettings:

               # Assuming you store your defaults in a file
               vars = Variables('variables.py')
               msvcver = vars.args.get('vc', '9')

               # Check command args to force one Microsoft Visual Studio version
               if msvcver == '9' or msvcver == '11':
                   env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION=msvcver + '.0', MSVC_BATCH=False)
               else:
                   env = Environment()

               AddOption(
                   '--userfile',
                   action='store_true',
                   dest='userfile',
                   default=False,
                   help="Create Visual C++ project file",
               )

       <b>MSVSSolution</b>(), <u>env</u>.MSVSSolution()
           Build a Microsoft Visual Studio Solution file.

           Builds a Visual Studio solution file based on the version of Visual Studio that is configured: either
           the latest installed version, or the version specified by <b>$MSVC_VERSION</b> in the construction
           environment. For Visual Studio 6, a .dsw file is generated. For Visual Studio .NET 2002 and later, it
           will generate a .sln file. Note there are multiple versioning schemes involved in the Microsoft
           compilation environment - see the description of <b>$MSVC_VERSION</b> for equivalences.

           The solution file is a container for one or more projects, and follows the format described at
           <b>https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/internals/solution-dot-sln-file</b>[5].

           The following values must be specified:

           <u>target</u>
               The name of the target .dsw or .sln file. The correct suffix for the version of Visual Studio
               must be used, but the value <b>$MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX</b> will be defined to the correct value (see example
               below).

           <u>variant</u>
               The name of this particular variant, or a list of variant names (the latter is only supported for
               MSVS 7 solutions). These are typically things like "Debug" or "Release", but really can be
               anything you want. For MSVS 7 they may also specify target platform, like this "Debug|Xbox".
               Default platform is Win32.

           <u>projects</u>
               A list of project file names, or Project nodes returned by calls to the <b>MSVSProject</b> Builder, to
               be placed into the solution file. Note that these filenames need to be specified as strings, NOT
               as SCons File Nodes. This is because the solution file will be interpreted by MSBuild and by
               Visual Studio, which know nothing about SCons Node types.

           Example Usage:

               env.MSVSSolution(
                   target="Bar" + env["MSVSSOLUTIONSUFFIX"],
                   projects=["bar" + env["MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX"]],
                   variant="Release",
               )

       <b>Ninja</b>(), <u>env</u>.Ninja()
           A special builder which adds a target to create a Ninja build file. The builder does not require any
           source files to be specified.

               <b>Note</b>
               This is an experimental feature. To enable it you must use one of the following methods

                   # On the command line
                   --experimental=ninja

                   # Or in your SConstruct
                   SetOption('experimental', 'ninja')

               This functionality is subject to change and/or removal without deprecation cycle.

               To use this tool you need to install the Python ninja package, as the tool by default depends on
               being able to do an import of the package This can be done via:

                   python -m pip install ninja

           If called with no arguments, the builder will default to a target name of ninja.build.

           If called with a single positional argument, <b>scons</b> will "deduce" the target name from that source
           argument, giving it the same name, and then ignore the source. This is the usual way to call the
           builder if a non-default target name is wanted.

           If called with either the <u>target=</u> or <u>source=</u> keyword arguments, the value of the argument is taken as
           the target name. If called with both, the <u>target=</u> value is used and <u>source=</u> is ignored. If called
           with multiple sources, the source list will be ignored, since there is no way to deduce what the
           intent was; in this case the default target name will be used.

           <u>Available</u> <u>since</u> <b>scons</b> <u>4.2.</u>

       <b>Object</b>(), <u>env</u>.Object()
           A synonym for the <b>StaticObject</b> builder method.

       <b>Package</b>(), <u>env</u>.Package()
           Builds software distribution packages. A package is a container format which includes files to
           install along with metadata. Packaging is optional, and must be enabled by specifying the packaging
           tool. For example:

               env = Environment(tools=['default', 'packaging'])

           SCons can build packages in a number of well known packaging formats. The target package type may be
           selected with the the <b>$PACKAGETYPE</b> construction variable or the <b>--package-type</b> command line option.
           The package type may be a list, in which case SCons will attempt to build packages for each type in
           the list. Example:

               env.Package(PACKAGETYPE=['src_zip', 'src_targz'], <u>...other</u> <u>args...</u>)

           The file list to include in the package may be specified with the <u>source</u> keyword argument. If
           omitted, the <b>FindInstalledFiles</b> function is called behind the scenes to select all files that have an
           <b>Install</b>, <b>InstallAs</b> or <b>InstallVersionedLib</b> Builder attached. If the <u>target</u> keyword argument is
           omitted, the target name(s) will be deduced from the package type(s).

           The metadata comes partly from attributes of the files to be packaged, and partly from packaging
           tags. Tags can be passed as keyword arguments to the <b>Package</b> builder call, and may also be attached
           to files (or more accurately, Nodes representing files) with the <b>Tag</b> function. Some package-level
           tags are mandatory, and will lead to errors if omitted. The mandatory tags vary depending on the
           package type.

           While packaging, the builder uses a temporary location named by the value of the <b>$PACKAGEROOT</b>
           variable - the package sources are copied there before packaging.

           Packaging example:

               env = Environment(tools=["default", "packaging"])
               env.Install("<a href="file:/bin/">/bin/</a>", "my_program")
               env.Package(
                   NAME="foo",
                   VERSION="1.2.3",
                   PACKAGEVERSION=0,
                   PACKAGETYPE="rpm",
                   LICENSE="gpl",
                   SUMMARY="balalalalal",
                   DESCRIPTION="this should be really really long",
                   X_RPM_GROUP="Application/fu",
                   SOURCE_URL="https://foo.org/foo-1.2.3.tar.gz",
               )

           In this example, the target /bin/my_program created by the <b>Install</b> call would not be built by default
           since it is not under the project top directory. However, since no <u>source</u> is specified to the <b>Package</b>
           builder, it is selected for packaging by the default sources rule. Since packaging is done using
           <b>$PACKAGEROOT</b>, no write is actually done to the system's <a href="file:/bin">/bin</a> directory, and the target <u>will</u> be
           selected since after rebasing to underneath <b>$PACKAGEROOT</b> it is now under the top directory of the
           project.

       <b>PCH</b>(), <u>env</u>.PCH()
           Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header. Calling this builder returns a list of two targets:
           the PCH as the first element, and the object file as the second element. Normally the object file is
           ignored. This builder is only provided when Microsoft Visual C++ is being used as the compiler. The
           <b>PCH</b> builder is generally used in conjunction with the <b>$PCH</b> construction variable to force object
           files to use the precompiled header:

               env['PCH'] = env.PCH('StdAfx.cpp')[0]

       <b>PDF</b>(), <u>env</u>.PDF()
           Builds a .pdf file from a .dvi input file (or, by extension, a .tex, .ltx, or .latex input file). The
           suffix specified by the <b>$PDFSUFFIX</b> construction variable (.pdf by default) is added automatically to
           the target if it is not already present. Example:

               # builds from aaa.tex
               env.PDF(target = 'aaa.pdf', source = 'aaa.tex')
               # builds bbb.pdf from bbb.dvi
               env.PDF(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.dvi')

       <b>POInit</b>(), <u>env</u>.POInit()
           This builder belongs to msginit tool. The builder initializes missing PO file(s) if <b>$POAUTOINIT</b> is
           set. If <b>$POAUTOINIT</b> is not set (default), <b>POInit</b> prints instruction for user (that is supposed to be
           a translator), telling how the PO file should be initialized. In normal projects <u>you</u> <u>should</u> <u>not</u> <u>use</u>
           <b>POInit</b> <u>and</u> <u>use</u> <b>POUpdate</b> <u>instead</u>.  <b>POUpdate</b> chooses intelligently between <b><a href="../man1/msgmerge.1.html">msgmerge</a>(1)</b> and <b><a href="../man1/msginit.1.html">msginit</a>(1)</b>.
           <b>POInit</b> always uses <b><a href="../man1/msginit.1.html">msginit</a>(1)</b> and should be regarded as builder for special purposes or for temporary
           use (e.g. for quick, one time initialization of a bunch of PO files) or for tests.

           Target nodes defined through <b>POInit</b> are not built by default (they're Ignored from '.' node) but are
           added to special Alias ('po-create' by default). The alias name may be changed through the
           <b>$POCREATE_ALIAS</b> construction variable. All PO files defined through <b>POInit</b> may be easily initialized
           by <b>scons</b> <b>po-create</b>.

           <u>Example</u> <u>1</u>. Initialize en.po and pl.po from messages.pot:

                 # ...
                 env.POInit(['en', 'pl']) # messages.pot --&gt; [en.po, pl.po]

           <u>Example</u> <u>2</u>. Initialize en.po and pl.po from foo.pot:

                 # ...
                 env.POInit(['en', 'pl'], ['foo']) # foo.pot --&gt; [en.po, pl.po]

           <u>Example</u> <u>3</u>. Initialize en.po and pl.po from foo.pot but using <b>$POTDOMAIN</b> construction variable:

                 # ...
                 env.POInit(['en', 'pl'], POTDOMAIN='foo') # foo.pot --&gt; [en.po, pl.po]

           <u>Example</u> <u>4</u>. Initialize PO files for languages defined in LINGUAS file. The files will be initialized
           from template messages.pot:

                 # ...
                 env.POInit(LINGUAS_FILE = 1) # needs 'LINGUAS' file

           <u>Example</u> <u>5</u>. Initialize en.po and pl.pl PO files plus files for languages defined in LINGUAS file. The
           files will be initialized from template messages.pot:

                 # ...
                 env.POInit(['en', 'pl'], LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

           <u>Example</u> <u>6</u>. You may preconfigure your environment first, and then initialize PO files:

                 # ...
                 env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
                 env['LINGUAS_FILE'] = 1
                 env['POTDOMAIN'] = 'foo'
                 env.POInit()

           which has same efect as:

                 # ...
                 env.POInit(POAUTOINIT = 1, LINGUAS_FILE = 1, POTDOMAIN = 'foo')

       <b>PostScript</b>(), <u>env</u>.PostScript()
           Builds a .ps file from a .dvi input file (or, by extension, a .tex, .ltx, or .latex input file). The
           suffix specified by the <b>$PSSUFFIX</b> construction variable (.ps by default) is added automatically to
           the target if it is not already present. Example:

               # builds from aaa.tex
               env.PostScript(target = 'aaa.ps', source = 'aaa.tex')
               # builds bbb.ps from bbb.dvi
               env.PostScript(target = 'bbb', source = 'bbb.dvi')

       <b>POTUpdate</b>(), <u>env</u>.POTUpdate()
           The builder belongs to xgettext tool. The builder updates target POT file if exists or creates one if
           it doesn't. The node is not built by default (i.e. it is Ignored from '.'), but only on demand (i.e.
           when given POT file is required or when special alias is invoked). This builder adds its targe node
           (messages.pot, say) to a special alias (pot-update by default, see <b>$POTUPDATE_ALIAS</b>) so you can
           update/create them easily with <b>scons</b> <b>pot-update</b>. The file is not written until there is no real
           change in internationalized messages (or in comments that enter POT file).

               <b>Note</b>
               You may see <b><a href="../man1/xgettext.1.html">xgettext</a>(1)</b> being invoked by the xgettext tool even if there is no real change in
               internationalized messages (so the POT file is not being updated). This happens every time a
               source file has changed. In such case we invoke <b><a href="../man1/xgettext.1.html">xgettext</a>(1)</b> and compare its output with the
               content of POT file to decide whether the file should be updated or not.

           <u>Example</u> <u>1.</u>  Let's create po/ directory and place following SConstruct script there:

                 # SConstruct in 'po/' subdir
                 env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
                 env.POTUpdate(['foo'], ['../a.cpp', '../b.cpp'])
                 env.POTUpdate(['bar'], ['../c.cpp', '../d.cpp'])

           Then invoke scons few times:

                 user@host:$ scons             # Does not create foo.pot nor bar.pot
                 user@host:$ scons foo.pot     # Updates or creates foo.pot
                 user@host:$ scons pot-update  # Updates or creates foo.pot and bar.pot
                 user@host:$ scons -c          # Does not clean foo.pot nor bar.pot.

           the results shall be as the comments above say.

           <u>Example</u> <u>2.</u>  The <b>POTUpdate</b> builder may be used with no target specified, in which case default target
           messages.pot will be used. The default target may also be overridden by setting <b>$POTDOMAIN</b>
           construction variable or providing it as an override to <b>POTUpdate</b> builder:

                 # SConstruct script
                 env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
                 env['POTDOMAIN'] = "foo"
                 env.POTUpdate(source = ["a.cpp", "b.cpp"]) # Creates foo.pot ...
                 env.POTUpdate(POTDOMAIN = "bar", source = ["c.cpp", "d.cpp"]) # and bar.pot

           <u>Example</u> <u>3.</u>  The sources may be specified within separate file, for example POTFILES.in:

                 # POTFILES.in in 'po/' subdirectory
                 ../a.cpp
                 ../b.cpp
                 # end of file

           The name of the file (POTFILES.in) containing the list of sources is provided via <b>$XGETTEXTFROM</b>:

                 # SConstruct file in 'po/' subdirectory
                 env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
                 env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in')

           <u>Example</u> <u>4.</u>  You may use <b>$XGETTEXTPATH</b> to define source search path. Assume, for example, that you
           have files a.cpp, b.cpp, po/SConstruct, po/POTFILES.in. Then your POT-related files could look as
           below:

                 # POTFILES.in in 'po/' subdirectory
                 a.cpp
                 b.cpp
                 # end of file

                 # SConstruct file in 'po/' subdirectory
                 env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
                 env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH='../')

           <u>Example</u> <u>5.</u>  Multiple search directories may be defined within a list, i.e.  XGETTEXTPATH = ['dir1',
           'dir2', ...]. The order in the list determines the search order of source files. The path to the
           first file found is used.

           Let's create 0/1/po/SConstruct script:

                 # SConstruct file in '0/1/po/' subdirectory
                 env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
                 env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH=['../', '..<a href="file:/../">/../</a>'])

           and 0/1/po/POTFILES.in:

                 # POTFILES.in in '0/1/po/' subdirectory
                 a.cpp
                 # end of file

           Write two *.cpp files, the first one is 0/a.cpp:

                 /* 0/a.cpp */
                 gettext("Hello from ../../a.cpp")

           and the second is 0/1/a.cpp:

                 /* 0/1/a.cpp */
                 gettext("Hello from ../a.cpp")

           then run scons. You'll obtain 0/1/po/messages.pot with the message "Hello from ../a.cpp". When you
           reverse order in <u>$XGETTEXTFOM</u>, i.e. when you write SConscript as

                 # SConstruct file in '0/1/po/' subdirectory
                 env = Environment( tools = ['default', 'xgettext'] )
                 env.POTUpdate(XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH=['..<a href="file:/../">/../</a>', '../'])

           then the messages.pot will contain msgid "Hello from ../../a.cpp" line and not msgid "Hello from
           ../a.cpp".

       <b>POUpdate</b>(), <u>env</u>.POUpdate()
           The builder belongs to msgmerge tool. The builder updates PO files with <b><a href="../man1/msgmerge.1.html">msgmerge</a>(1)</b>, or initializes
           missing PO files as described in documentation of msginit tool and <b>POInit</b> builder (see also
           <b>$POAUTOINIT</b>). Note, that <b>POUpdate</b> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>add</u> <u>its</u> <u>targets</u> <u>to</u> <u>po-create</u> <u>alias</u> as <b>POInit</b> does.

           Target nodes defined through <b>POUpdate</b> are not built by default (they're Ignored from '.' node).
           Instead, they are added automatically to special Alias ('po-update' by default). The alias name may
           be changed through the <b>$POUPDATE_ALIAS</b> construction variable. You can easily update PO files in your
           project by <b>scons</b> <b>po-update</b>.

           <u>Example</u> <u>1.</u>  Update en.po and pl.po from messages.pot template (see also <b>$POTDOMAIN</b>), assuming that
           the later one exists or there is rule to build it (see <b>POTUpdate</b>):

                 # ...
                 env.POUpdate(['en','pl']) # messages.pot --&gt; [en.po, pl.po]

           <u>Example</u> <u>2.</u>  Update en.po and pl.po from foo.pot template:

                 # ...
                 env.POUpdate(['en', 'pl'], ['foo']) # foo.pot --&gt;  [en.po, pl.pl]

           <u>Example</u> <u>3.</u>  Update en.po and pl.po from foo.pot (another version):

                 # ...
                 env.POUpdate(['en', 'pl'], POTDOMAIN='foo') # foo.pot -- &gt; [en.po, pl.pl]

           <u>Example</u> <u>4.</u>  Update files for languages defined in LINGUAS file. The files are updated from
           messages.pot template:

                 # ...
                 env.POUpdate(LINGUAS_FILE = 1) # needs 'LINGUAS' file

           <u>Example</u> <u>5.</u>  Same as above, but update from foo.pot template:

                 # ...
                 env.POUpdate(LINGUAS_FILE = 1, source = ['foo'])

           <u>Example</u> <u>6.</u>  Update en.po and pl.po plus files for languages defined in LINGUAS file. The files are
           updated from messages.pot template:

                 # produce 'en.po', 'pl.po' + files defined in 'LINGUAS':
                 env.POUpdate(['en', 'pl' ], LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

           <u>Example</u> <u>7.</u>  Use <b>$POAUTOINIT</b> to automatically initialize PO file if it doesn't exist:

                 # ...
                 env.POUpdate(LINGUAS_FILE = 1, POAUTOINIT = 1)

           <u>Example</u> <u>8.</u>  Update PO files for languages defined in LINGUAS file. The files are updated from foo.pot
           template. All necessary settings are pre-configured via environment.

                 # ...
                 env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
                 env['LINGUAS_FILE'] = 1
                 env['POTDOMAIN'] = 'foo'
                 env.POUpdate()

       <b>Program</b>(), <u>env</u>.Program()
           Builds an executable given one or more object files or C, C++, D, or Fortran source files. If any C,
           C++, D or Fortran source files are specified, then they will be automatically compiled to object
           files using the <b>Object</b> builder method; see that builder method's description for a list of legal
           source file suffixes and how they are interpreted. The target executable file prefix, specified by
           the <b>$PROGPREFIX</b> construction variable (nothing by default), and suffix, specified by the <b>$PROGSUFFIX</b>
           construction variable (by default, .exe on Windows systems, nothing on POSIX systems), are
           automatically added to the target if not already present. Example:

               env.Program(target='foo', source=['foo.o', 'bar.c', 'baz.f'])

       <b>ProgramAllAtOnce</b>(), <u>env</u>.ProgramAllAtOnce()
           Builds an executable from D sources without first creating individual objects for each file.

           D sources can be compiled file-by-file as C and C++ source are, and D is integrated into the <b>scons</b>
           Object and Program builders for this model of build. D codes can though do whole source
           meta-programming (some of the testing frameworks do this). For this it is imperative that all sources
           are compiled and linked in a single call to the D compiler. This builder serves that purpose.

                   env.ProgramAllAtOnce('executable', ['mod_a.d, mod_b.d', 'mod_c.d'])

           This command will compile the modules mod_a, mod_b, and mod_c in a single compilation process without
           first creating object files for the modules. Some of the D compilers will create executable.o others
           will not.

       <b>RES</b>(), <u>env</u>.RES()
           Builds a Microsoft Visual C++ resource file. This builder method is only provided when Microsoft
           Visual C++ or MinGW is being used as the compiler. The .res (or .o for MinGW) suffix is added to the
           target name if no other suffix is given. The source file is scanned for implicit dependencies as
           though it were a C file. Example:

               env.RES('resource.rc')

       <b>RMIC</b>(), <u>env</u>.RMIC()
           Builds stub and skeleton class files for remote objects from Java .class files. The target is a
           directory relative to which the stub and skeleton class files will be written. The source can be the
           names of .class files, or the objects return from the <b>Java</b> builder method.

           If the construction variable <b>$JAVACLASSDIR</b> is set, either in the environment or in the call to the
           <b>RMIC</b> builder method itself, then the value of the variable will be stripped from the beginning of any
           .class file names.

               classes = env.Java(target='classdir', source='src')
               env.RMIC(target='outdir1', source=classes)
               env.RMIC(
                   target='outdir2',
                   source=['package/foo.class', 'package/bar.class'],
               )
               env.RMIC(
                   target='outdir3',
                   source=['classes/foo.class', 'classes/bar.class'],
                   JAVACLASSDIR='classes',
               )

       <b>RPCGenClient</b>(), <u>env</u>.RPCGenClient()
           Generates an RPC client stub (_clnt.c) file from a specified RPC (.x) source file. Because rpcgen
           only builds output files in the local directory, the command will be executed in the source file's
           directory by default.

               # Builds src/rpcif_clnt.c

       <b>RPCGenHeader</b>(), <u>env</u>.RPCGenHeader()
           Generates an RPC header (.h) file from a specified RPC (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only builds
           output files in the local directory, the command will be executed in the source file's directory by
           default.

               env.RPCGenHeader('src/rpcif.x')

       <b>RPCGenService</b>(), <u>env</u>.RPCGenService()
           Generates an RPC server-skeleton (_svc.c) file from a specified RPC (.x) source file. Because rpcgen
           only builds output files in the local directory, the command will be executed in the source file's
           directory by default.

       <b>RPCGenXDR</b>(), <u>env</u>.RPCGenXDR()
           Generates an RPC XDR routine (_xdr.c) file from a specified RPC (.x) source file. Because rpcgen only
           builds output files in the local directory, the command will be executed in the source file's
           directory by default.

               # Builds src/rpcif_xdr.c
               env.RPCGenClient('src/rpcif.x')

       <b>SharedLibrary</b>(), <u>env</u>.SharedLibrary()
           Builds a shared library (.so on a POSIX system, .dll on Windows) given one or more object files or C,
           C++, D or Fortran source files. If any source files are given, then they will be automatically
           compiled to object files. The target library file prefix, specified by the <b>$SHLIBPREFIX</b> construction
           variable (by default, lib on POSIX systems, nothing on Windows systems), and suffix, specified by the
           <b>$SHLIBSUFFIX</b> construction variable (by default, .dll on Windows systems, .so on POSIX systems), are
           automatically added to the target if not already present. Example:

               env.SharedLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.c', 'foo.o'])

           On Windows systems, the <b>SharedLibrary</b> builder method will always build an import library (.lib) in
           addition to the shared library (.dll), adding a .lib library with the same basename if there is not
           already a .lib file explicitly listed in the targets.

           On Cygwin systems, the <b>SharedLibrary</b> builder method will always build an import library (.dll.a) in
           addition to the shared library (.dll), adding a .dll.a library with the same basename if there is not
           already a .dll.a file explicitly listed in the targets.

           Any object files listed in the <u>source</u> must have been built for a shared library (that is, using the
           <b>SharedObject</b> builder method).  <b>scons</b> will raise an error if there is any mismatch.

           On some platforms, there is a distinction between a shared library (loaded automatically by the
           system to resolve external references) and a loadable module (explicitly loaded by user action). For
           maximum portability, use the <b>LoadableModule</b> builder for the latter.

           When the <b>$SHLIBVERSION</b> construction variable is defined, a versioned shared library is created. This
           modifies <b>$SHLINKFLAGS</b> as required, adds the version number to the library name, and creates any
           symbolic links that are needed.

               env.SharedLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.c', 'foo.o'], SHLIBVERSION='1.5.2')

           On a POSIX system, versions with a single token create exactly one symlink: libbar.so.6 would have
           symlink libbar.so only. On a POSIX system, versions with two or more tokens create exactly two
           symlinks: libbar.so.2.3.1 would have symlinks libbar.so and libbar.so.2; on a Darwin (OSX) system the
           library would be libbar.2.3.1.dylib and the link would be libbar.dylib.

           On Windows systems, specifying <u>register=1</u> will cause the .dll to be registered after it is built. The
           command that is run is determined by the <b>$REGSVR</b> construction variable (<b>regsvr32</b> by default), and the
           flags passed are determined by <b>$REGSVRFLAGS</b>. By default, <b>$REGSVRFLAGS</b> includes the <b>/s</b> option, to
           prevent dialogs from popping up and requiring user attention when it is run. If you change
           <b>$REGSVRFLAGS</b>, be sure to include the <b>/s</b> option. For example,

               env.SharedLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.cxx', 'foo.obj'], register=1)

           will register bar.dll as a COM object when it is done linking it.

       <b>SharedObject</b>(), <u>env</u>.SharedObject()
           Builds an object file intended for inclusion in a shared library. Source files must have one of the
           same set of extensions specified above for the <b>StaticObject</b> builder method. On some platforms
           building a shared object requires additional compiler option (e.g.  <b>-fPIC</b> for <b>gcc</b>) in addition to
           those needed to build a normal (static) object, but on some platforms there is no difference between
           a shared object and a normal (static) one. When there is a difference, SCons will only allow shared
           objects to be linked into a shared library, and will use a different suffix for shared objects. On
           platforms where there is no difference, SCons will allow both normal (static) and shared objects to
           be linked into a shared library, and will use the same suffix for shared and normal (static) objects.
           The target object file prefix, specified by the <b>$SHOBJPREFIX</b> construction variable (by default, the
           same as <b>$OBJPREFIX</b>), and suffix, specified by the <b>$SHOBJSUFFIX</b> construction variable, are
           automatically added to the target if not already present. Examples:

               env.SharedObject(target='ddd', source='ddd.c')
               env.SharedObject(target='eee.o', source='eee.cpp')
               env.SharedObject(target='fff.obj', source='fff.for')

           Note that the source files will be scanned according to the suffix mappings in the SourceFileScanner
           object. See the manpage section "Scanner Objects" for more information.

       <b>StaticLibrary</b>(), <u>env</u>.StaticLibrary()
           Builds a static library given one or more object files or C, C++, D or Fortran source files. If any
           source files are given, then they will be automatically compiled to object files. The static library
           file prefix, specified by the <b>$LIBPREFIX</b> construction variable (by default, lib on POSIX systems,
           nothing on Windows systems), and suffix, specified by the <b>$LIBSUFFIX</b> construction variable (by
           default, .lib on Windows systems, .a on POSIX systems), are automatically added to the target if not
           already present. Example:

               env.StaticLibrary(target='bar', source=['bar.c', 'foo.o'])

           Any object files listed in the <u>source</u> must have been built for a static library (that is, using the

           Note that the source files will be scanned according to the suffix mappings in the SourceFileScanner
           object. See the manpage section "Scanner Objects" for more information.

       <b>Substfile</b>(), <u>env</u>.Substfile()
           The <b>Substfile</b> builder creates a single text file from a template consisting of a file or set of files
           (or nodes), replacing text using the <b>$SUBST_DICT</b> construction variable (if set). If a set, they are
           concatenated into the target file using the value of the <b>$LINESEPARATOR</b> construction variable as a
           separator between contents; the separator is not emitted after the contents of the last file. Nested
           lists of source files are flattened. See also <b>Textfile</b>.

           By default the target file encoding is "utf-8" and can be changed by <b>$FILE_ENCODING</b> Examples:

           If a single source file name is specified and has a .in suffix, the suffix is stripped and the
           remainder of the name is used as the default target name.

           The prefix and suffix specified by the <b>$SUBSTFILEPREFIX</b> and <b>$SUBSTFILESUFFIX</b> construction variables
           (an empty string by default in both cases) are automatically added to the target if they are not
           already present.

           If a construction variable named <b>$SUBST_DICT</b> is present, it may be either a Python dictionary or a
           sequence of (<u>key</u>, <u>value</u>) tuples. If it is a dictionary it is converted into a list of tuples with
           unspecified order, so if one key is a prefix of another key or if one substitution could be further
           expanded by another subsitition, it is unpredictable whether the expansion will occur.

           Any occurrences of a key in the source are replaced by the corresponding value, which may be a Python
           callable function or a string. If the value is a callable, it is called with no arguments to get a
           string. Strings are <u>subst</u>-expanded and the result replaces the key.

               env = Environment(tools=['default'])

               env['prefix'] = '<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>'

       <b>Tar</b>(), <u>env</u>.Tar()
           Builds a tar archive of the specified files and/or directories. Unlike most builder methods, the <b>Tar</b>
           builder method may be called multiple times for a given target; each additional call adds to the list
           of entries that will be built into the archive. Any source directories will be scanned for changes to
           any on-disk files, regardless of whether or not <b>scons</b> knows about them from other Builder or function
           calls.

               env.Tar('src.tar', 'src')

               # Create the stuff.tar file.
               env.Tar('stuff', ['subdir1', 'subdir2'])
               # Also add "another" to the stuff.tar file.
               env.Tar('stuff', 'another')

               # Set TARFLAGS to create a gzip-filtered archive.
               env = Environment(TARFLAGS = '-c -z')
               env.Tar('foo.tar.gz', 'foo')

               # Also set the suffix to .tgz.
               env = Environment(TARFLAGS = '-c -z',
                                 TARSUFFIX = '.tgz')
               env.Tar('foo')

       <b>Textfile</b>(), <u>env</u>.Textfile()
           The <b>Textfile</b> builder generates a single text file from a template consisting of a list of strings,
           replacing text using the <b>$SUBST_DICT</b> construction variable (if set) - see <b>Substfile</b> for a description
           of replacement. The strings will be separated in the target file using the value of the
           <b>$LINESEPARATOR</b> construction variable; the line separator is not emitted after the last string. Nested
           lists of source strings are flattened. Source strings need not literally be Python strings: they can
           be Nodes or Python objects that convert cleanly to <b>Value</b> nodes.

           The prefix and suffix specified by the <b>$TEXTFILEPREFIX</b> and <b>$TEXTFILESUFFIX</b> construction variables (by
           default an empty string and .txt, respectively) are automatically added to the target if they are not
           already present.

           By default the target file encoding is "utf-8" and can be changed by <b>$FILE_ENCODING</b> Examples:

               # builds/writes foo.txt
               env.Textfile(target='foo.txt', source=['Goethe', 42, 'Schiller'])

               # builds/writes bar.txt
               env.Textfile(target='bar', source=['lalala', 'tanteratei'], LINESEPARATOR='|*')

               # nested lists are flattened automatically
               env.Textfile(target='blob', source=['lalala', ['Goethe', 42, 'Schiller'], 'tanteratei'])

               # files may be used as input by wraping them in File()

       <b>Translate</b>(), <u>env</u>.Translate()
           This pseudo-builder belongs to gettext toolset. The builder extracts internationalized messages from
           source files, updates POT template (if necessary) and then updates PO translations (if necessary). If
           <b>$POAUTOINIT</b> is set, missing PO files will be automatically created (i.e. without translator person
           intervention). The variables <b>$LINGUAS_FILE</b> and <b>$POTDOMAIN</b> are taken into acount too. All other
           construction variables used by <b>POTUpdate</b>, and <b>POUpdate</b> work here too.

           <u>Example</u> <u>1</u>. The simplest way is to specify input files and output languages inline in a SCons script
           when invoking <b>Translate</b>

               # SConscript in 'po/' directory
               env = Environment( tools = ["default", "gettext"] )
               env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
               env.Translate(['en','pl'], ['../a.cpp','../b.cpp'])

           <u>Example</u> <u>2</u>. If you wish, you may also stick to conventional style known from autotools, i.e. using
           POTFILES.in and LINGUAS files

               # LINGUAS
               en pl
               #end

               # POTFILES.in
               a.cpp
               b.cpp
               # end

               # SConscript
               env = Environment( tools = ["default", "gettext"] )
               env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
               env['XGETTEXTPATH'] = ['../']
               env.Translate(LINGUAS_FILE = 1, XGETTEXTFROM = 'POTFILES.in')

           The last approach is perhaps the recommended one. It allows easily split
           internationalization/localization onto separate SCons scripts, where a script in source tree is
           responsible for translations (from sources to PO files) and script(s) under variant directories are
           responsible for compilation of PO to MO files to and for installation of MO files. The "gluing
           factor" synchronizing these two scripts is then the content of LINGUAS file. Note, that the updated
           POT and PO files are usually going to be committed back to the repository, so they must be updated
           within the source directory (and not in variant directories). Additionaly, the file listing of po/
           directory contains LINGUAS file, so the source tree looks familiar to translators, and they may work
           with the project in their usual way.

           <u>Example</u> <u>3</u>. Let's prepare a development tree as below

                project/
                 + SConstruct
                 + build/
                 + src/
                     + po/
                         + SConscript
                         + SConscript.i18n
                         + POTFILES.in
                         + LINGUAS

           with build being variant directory. Write the top-level SConstruct script as follows

                 # SConstruct
                 env = Environment( tools = ["default", "gettext"] )
                 VariantDir('build', 'src', duplicate = 0)
                 env['POAUTOINIT'] = 1
                 SConscript('src/po/SConscript.i18n', exports = 'env')
                 SConscript('build/po/SConscript', exports = 'env')

           the src/po/SConscript.i18n as

                 # src/po/SConscript.i18n
                 Import('env')
                 env.Translate(LINGUAS_FILE=1, XGETTEXTFROM='POTFILES.in', XGETTEXTPATH=['../'])

           and the src/po/SConscript

                 # src/po/SConscript
                 Import('env')
                 env.MOFiles(LINGUAS_FILE = 1)

           Such setup produces POT and PO files under source tree in src/po/ and binary MO files under variant
           tree in build/po/. This way the POT and PO files are separated from other output files, which must
           not be committed back to source repositories (e.g.  MO files).

               <b>Note</b>
               In above example, the PO files are not updated, nor created automatically when you issue <b>scons</b>
               <b>'.'</b> command. The files must be updated (created) by hand via <b>scons</b> <b>po-update</b> and then MO files
               can be compiled by running <b>scons</b> <b>'.'</b>.

       <b>TypeLibrary</b>(), <u>env</u>.TypeLibrary()
           Builds a Windows type library (.tlb) file from an input IDL file (.idl). In addition, it will build
           the associated interface stub and proxy source files, naming them according to the base name of the
           .idl file. For example,

               env.TypeLibrary(source="foo.idl")

           Will create foo.tlb, foo.h, foo_i.c, foo_p.c and foo_data.c files.

       <b>Uic</b>(), <u>env</u>.Uic()
           Builds a header file, an implementation file and a moc file from an ui file. and returns the
           corresponding nodes in the that order. This builder is only available after using the tool qt3. Note:
           you can specify .ui files directly as source files to the <b>Program</b>, <b>Library</b> and <b>SharedLibrary</b> builders
           without using this builder. Using this builder lets you override the standard naming conventions (be
           careful: prefixes are always prepended to names of built files; if you don't want prefixes, you may
           set them to ``). See the <b>$QT3DIR</b> variable for more information. Example:

               env.Uic('foo.ui')  # -&gt; ['foo.h', 'uic_foo.cc', 'moc_foo.cc']
               env.Uic(
                   target=Split('include/foo.h gen/uicfoo.cc gen/mocfoo.cc'),
                   source='foo.ui'
               )  # -&gt; ['include/foo.h', 'gen/uicfoo.cc', 'gen/mocfoo.cc']

       <b>Zip</b>(), <u>env</u>.Zip()
           Builds a zip archive of the specified files and/or directories. Unlike most builder methods, the <b>Zip</b>
           builder method may be called multiple times for a given target; each additional call adds to the list
           of entries that will be built into the archive. Any source directories will be scanned for changes to
           any on-disk files, regardless of whether or not <b>scons</b> knows about them from other Builder or function
           calls.

               env.Zip('src.zip', 'src')

               # Create the stuff.zip file.
               env.Zip('stuff', ['subdir1', 'subdir2'])
               # Also add "another" to the stuff.tar file.
               env.Zip('stuff', 'another')

       All targets of builder methods automatically depend on their sources. An explicit dependency can be
       specified using the <b>env.Depends</b> method of a construction environment (see below).

       In addition, <b>scons</b> automatically scans source files for various programming languages, so the
       dependencies do not need to be specified explicitly. By default, SCons can C source files, C++ source
       files, Fortran source files with .F (POSIX systems only), .fpp, or .FPP file extensions, and assembly
       language files with .S (POSIX systems only), .spp, or .SPP files extensions for C preprocessor
       dependencies. SCons also has default support for scanning D source files, You can also write your own
       Scanners to add support for additional source file types. These can be added to the default Scanner
       object used by the <b>Object</b>, <b>StaticObject</b> and <b>SharedObject</b> Builders by adding them to the SourceFileScanner
       object. See the section called “Scanner Objects” for more information about defining your own Scanner
       objects and using the SourceFileScanner object.

   <b>Methods</b> <b>and</b> <b>Functions</b> <b>To</b> <b>Do</b> <b>Things</b>
       In addition to Builder methods, <b>scons</b> provides a number of other construction environment methods and
       global functions to manipulate the build configuration.

       Usually, a construction environment method and global function with the same name both exist for
       convenience. In the following list, the global function is documented in this style:

           <b>Function</b>(<u>arguments,</u> <u>[optional</u> <u>arguments]</u>)

       and the construction environment method looks like:

           <u>env</u>.Function(<u>arguments,</u> <u>[optional</u> <u>arguments]</u>)

       If the function can be called both ways, then both forms are listed.

       The global function and same-named construction environment method provide almost identical
       functionality, with a couple of exceptions. First, many of the construction environment methods affect
       only that construction environment, while the global function has a global effect. Second, where
       appropriate, calling the functionality through a construction environment will substitute construction
       variables into any supplied string arguments, while the global function doesn't have the context of a
       construction environment to pick variables from, so it cannot perform the substitution. For example:

           Default('$FOO')

           env = Environment(FOO='foo')
           env.Default('$FOO')

       In the above example, the call to the global <b>Default</b> function will add a target named <b>$FOO</b> to the list of
       default targets, while the call to the <b>env.Default</b> construction environment method will expand the value
       and add a target named <b>foo</b> to the list of default targets. For more on construction variable expansion,
       see the next section on construction variables.

       Global functions may be called from custom Python modules that you import into an SConscript file by
       adding the following import to the Python module:

           from SCons.Script import *

       Construction environment methods and global functions provided by <b>scons</b> include:

       <b>Action</b>(<u>action,</u> <u>[output,</u> <u>[var,</u> <u>...]]</u> <u>[key=value,</u> <u>...]</u>), <u>env</u>.Action(<u>action,</u> <u>[output,</u> <u>[var,</u> <u>...]]</u>
       <u>[key=value,</u> <u>...]</u>)
           A factory function to create an Action object for the specified <u>action</u>. See the manpage section
           "Action Objects" for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior.

           Note that the <b>env.Action</b> form of the invocation will expand construction variables in any argument
           strings, including the <u>action</u> argument, at the time it is called using the construction variables in
           the <u>env</u> construction environment through which <b>env.Action</b> was called. The <b>Action</b> global function form
           delays all variable expansion until the Action object is actually used.

       <b>AddMethod</b>(<u>object,</u> <u>function,</u> <u>[name]</u>), <u>env</u>.AddMethod(<u>function,</u> <u>[name]</u>)
           Adds <u>function</u> to an object as a method.  <u>function</u> will be called with an instance object as the first
           argument as for other methods. If <u>name</u> is given, it is used as the name of the new method, else the
           name of <u>function</u> is used.

           When the global function <b>AddMethod</b> is called, the object to add the method to must be passed as the
           first argument; typically this will be <b>Environment</b>, in order to create a method which applies to all
           construction environments subsequently constructed. When called using the <b>env.AddMethod</b> form, the
           method is added to the specified construction environment only. Added methods propagate through
           <b>env.Clone</b> calls.

           More examples:

               # Function to add must accept an instance argument.
               # The Python convention is to call this 'self'.
               def my_method(self, arg):
                   print("my_method() got", arg)

               # Use the global function to add a method to the Environment class:
               AddMethod(Environment, my_method)
               env = Environment()
               env.my_method('arg')

               # Use the optional name argument to set the name of the method:
               env.AddMethod(my_method, 'other_method_name')
               env.other_method_name('another arg')

       <b>AddOption</b>(<u>arguments</u>)
           Adds a local (project-specific) command-line option.  <u>arguments</u> are the same as those supported by
           the <b>add_option</b> method in the standard Python library module optparse, with a few additional
           capabilities noted below. See the documentation for optparse for a thorough discussion of its
           option-processing capabities.

           In addition to the arguments and values supported by the optparse <b>add_option</b> method, <b>AddOption</b> allows
           setting the <u>nargs</u> keyword value to a string consisting of a question mark ('?') to indicate that the
           option argument for that option string is optional. If the option string is present on the command
           line but has no matching option argument, the value of the <u>const</u> keyword argument is produced as the
           value of the option. If the option string is omitted from the command line, the value of the <u>default</u>
           keyword argument is produced, as usual; if there is no <u>default</u> keyword argument in the <b>AddOption</b>
           call, <b>None</b> is produced.

           optparse recognizes abbreviations of long option names, as long as they can be unambiguously
           resolved. For example, if <b>add_option</b> is called to define a <b>--devicename</b> option, it will recognize
           <b>--device</b>, <b>--dev</b> and so forth as long as there is no other option which could also match to the same
           abbreviation. Options added via <b>AddOption</b> do not support the automatic recognition of abbreviations.
           Instead, to allow specific abbreviations, include them as synonyms in the <b>AddOption</b> call itself.

           Once a new command-line option has been added with <b>AddOption</b>, the option value may be accessed using
           <b>GetOption</b> or <b>env.GetOption</b>.  <b>SetOption</b> is not currently supported for options added with <b>AddOption</b>.

           Help text for an option is a combination of the string supplied in the <u>help</u> keyword argument to
           <b>AddOption</b> and information collected from the other keyword arguments. Such help is displayed if the
           <b>-h</b> command line option is used (but not with <b>-H</b>). Help for all local options is displayed under the
           separate heading <b>Local</b> <b>Options</b>. The options are unsorted - they will appear in the help text in the
           order in which the <b>AddOption</b> calls occur.

           Example:

               AddOption(
                   '--prefix',
                   dest='prefix',
                   nargs=1,
                   type='string',
                   action='store',
                   metavar='DIR',
                   help='installation prefix',
               )
               env = Environment(PREFIX=GetOption('prefix'))

           For that example, the following help text would be produced:

               Local Options:
                 --prefix=DIR                installation prefix

           Help text for local options may be unavailable if the <b>Help</b> function has been called, see the <b>Help</b>
           documentation for details.

               <b>Note</b>
               As an artifact of the internal implementation, the behavior of options added by <b>AddOption</b> which
               take option arguments is undefined <u>if</u> whitespace (rather than an = sign) is used as the separator
               on the command line. Users should avoid such usage; it is recommended to add a note to this
               effect to project documentation if the situation is likely to arise. In addition, if the <u>nargs</u>
               keyword is used to specify more than one following option argument (that is, with a value of <b>2</b> or
               greater), such arguments would necessarily be whitespace separated, triggering the issue.
               Developers should not use <b>AddOption</b> this way. Future versions of SCons will likely forbid such
               usage.

       <b>AddPostAction</b>(<u>target,</u> <u>action</u>), <u>env</u>.AddPostAction(<u>target,</u> <u>action</u>)
           Arranges for the specified <u>action</u> to be performed after the specified <u>target</u> has been built. The
           specified action(s) may be an Action object, or anything that can be converted into an Action object
           See the manpage section "Action Objects" for a complete explanation.

           When multiple targets are supplied, the action may be called multiple times, once after each action
           that generates one or more targets in the list.

       <b>AddPreAction</b>(<u>target,</u> <u>action</u>), <u>env</u>.AddPreAction(<u>target,</u> <u>action</u>)
           Arranges for the specified <u>action</u> to be performed before the specified <u>target</u> is built. The specified
           action(s) may be an Action object, or anything that can be converted into an Action object See the
           manpage section "Action Objects" for a complete explanation.

           When multiple targets are specified, the action(s) may be called multiple times, once before each
           action that generates one or more targets in the list.

           Note that if any of the targets are built in multiple steps, the action will be invoked just before
           the "final" action that specifically generates the specified target(s). For example, when building an
           executable program from a specified source .c file via an intermediate object file:

               foo = Program('foo.c')
               AddPreAction(foo, 'pre_action')

           The specified pre_action would be executed before <b>scons</b> calls the link command that actually
           generates the executable program binary foo, not before compiling the foo.c file into an object file.

       <b>Alias</b>(<u>alias,</u> <u>[targets,</u> <u>[action]]</u>), <u>env</u>.Alias(<u>alias,</u> <u>[targets,</u> <u>[action]]</u>)
           Creates one or more phony targets that expand to one or more other targets. An optional <u>action</u>
           (command) or list of actions can be specified that will be executed whenever the any of the alias
           targets are out-of-date. Returns the Node object representing the alias, which exists outside of any
           file system. This Node object, or the alias name, may be used as a dependency of any other target,
           including another alias.  <b>Alias</b> can be called multiple times for the same alias to add additional
           targets to the alias, or additional actions to the list for this alias. Aliases are global even if
           set through the construction environment method.

           Examples:

               Alias('install')
               Alias('install', '<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>')
               Alias(['install', 'install-lib'], '<a href="file:/usr/local/lib">/usr/local/lib</a>')

               env.Alias('install', ['<a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>', '<a href="file:/usr/local/lib">/usr/local/lib</a>'])
               env.Alias('install', ['<a href="file:/usr/local/man">/usr/local/man</a>'])

               env.Alias('update', ['file1', 'file2'], "update_database $SOURCES")

       <b>AllowSubstExceptions</b>(<u>[exception,</u> <u>...]</u>)
           Specifies the exceptions that will be allowed when expanding construction variables. By default, any
           construction variable expansions that generate a NameError or IndexError exception will expand to a
           '' (an empty string) and not cause scons to fail. All exceptions not in the specified list will
           generate an error message and terminate processing.

           If <b>AllowSubstExceptions</b> is called multiple times, each call completely overwrites the previous list
           of allowed exceptions.

           Example:

               # Requires that all construction variable names exist.
               # (You may wish to do this if you want to enforce strictly
               # that all construction variables must be defined before use.)
               AllowSubstExceptions()

               # Also allow a string containing a zero-division expansion
               # like '${1 / 0}' to evalute to ''.
               AllowSubstExceptions(IndexError, NameError, ZeroDivisionError)

       <b>AlwaysBuild</b>(<u>target,</u> <u>...</u>), <u>env</u>.AlwaysBuild(<u>target,</u> <u>...</u>)
           Marks each given <u>target</u> so that it is always assumed to be out of date, and will always be rebuilt if
           needed. Note, however, that <b>AlwaysBuild</b> does not add its target(s) to the default target list, so the
           targets will only be built if they are specified on the command line, or are a dependent of a target
           specified on the command line--but they will <u>always</u> be built if so specified. Multiple targets can be
           passed in to a single call to <b>AlwaysBuild</b>.

       <u>env</u>.Append(<u>key=val,</u> <u>[...]</u>)
           Appends value(s) intelligently to construction variables in <u>env</u>. The construction variables and
           values to add to them are passed as <u>key=val</u> pairs (Python keyword arguments).  <b>env.Append</b> is designed
           to allow adding values without having to think about the data type of an existing construction
           variable. Regular Python syntax can also be used to manipulate the construction variable, but for
           that you may need to know the types involved, for example pure Python lets you directly "add" two
           lists of strings, but adding a string to a list or a list to a string requires different syntax -
           things <b>Append</b> takes care of. Some pre-defined construction variables do have type expectations based
           on how SCons will use them: for example <b>$CPPDEFINES</b> is often a string or a list of strings, but can
           also be a list of tuples or a dictionary; while <b>$LIBEMITTER</b> is expected to be a callable or list of
           callables, and <b>$BUILDERS</b> is expected to be a dictionary. Consult the documentation for the various
           construction variables for more details.

           The following descriptions apply to both the <b>Append</b> and <b>Prepend</b> methods, as well as their <b>Unique</b>
           variants, with the differences being the insertion point of the added values and whether duplication
           is allowed.

           <u>val</u> can be almost any type. If <u>env</u> does not have a construction variable named <u>key</u>, then <u>key</u> is
           simply stored with a value of <u>val</u>. Otherwise, <u>val</u> is combinined with the existing value, possibly
           converting into an appropriate type which can hold the expanded contents. There are a few special
           cases to be aware of. Normally, when two strings are combined, the result is a new string containing
           their concatenation (and you are responsible for supplying any needed separation); however, the
           contents of <b>$CPPDEFINES</b> will will be postprocessed by adding a prefix and/or suffix to each entry
           when the command line is produced, so SCons keeps them separate - appending a string will result in a
           separate string entry, not a combined string. For <b>$CPPDEFINES</b>. as well as <b>$LIBS</b>, and the various
           *PATH variables, SCons will amend the variable by supplying the compiler-specific syntax (e.g.
           prepending a -D or /D prefix for <b>$CPPDEFINES</b>), so you should omit this syntax when adding values to
           these variables. Examples (gcc syntax shown in the expansion of <u>CPPDEFINES</u>):

               env = Environment(CXXFLAGS="-std=c11", CPPDEFINES="RELEASE")
               print(f"CXXFLAGS = {env['CXXFLAGS']}, CPPDEFINES = {env['CPPDEFINES']}")
               # notice including a leading space in CXXFLAGS addition
               env.Append(CXXFLAGS=" -O", CPPDEFINES="EXTRA")
               print(f"CXXFLAGS = {env['CXXFLAGS']}, CPPDEFINES = {env['CPPDEFINES']}")
               print("CPPDEFINES will expand to", env.subst('$_CPPDEFFLAGS'))

               $ scons -Q
               CXXFLAGS = -std=c11, CPPDEFINES = RELEASE
               CXXFLAGS = -std=c11 -O, CPPDEFINES = deque(['RELEASE', 'EXTRA'])
               CPPDEFINES will expand to -DRELEASE -DEXTRA
               scons: `.' is up to date.

           Because <b>$CPPDEFINES</b> is intended for command-line specification of C/C++ preprocessor macros,
           additional syntax is accepted when adding to it. The preprocessor accepts arguments to predefine a
           macro name by itself (-DFOO for most compilers, /DFOO for Microsoft C++), which gives it an implicit
           value of <b>1</b>, or can be given with a replacement value (-DBAR=TEXT).  SCons follows these rules when
           adding to <b>$CPPDEFINES</b>:

           •   A string is split on spaces, giving an easy way to enter multiple macros in one addition. Use an
               = to specify a valued macro.

           •   A tuple is treated as a valued macro. Use the value <b>None</b> if the macro should not have a value. It
               is an error to supply more than two elements in such a tuple.

           •   A list is processed in order, adding each item without further interpretation. In this case,
               space-separated strings are not split.

           •   A dictionary is processed in order, adding each key:value pair as a valued macro. Use the value
               <b>None</b> if the macro should not have a value.

           Examples:

               env = Environment(CPPDEFINES="FOO")
               print("CPPDEFINES =", env['CPPDEFINES'])
               env.Append(CPPDEFINES="BAR=1")

           <u>Changed</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.5</u>: clarifined the use of tuples vs. other types, handling is now consistent
           across the four functions.

               env = Environment()
               env.Append(CPPDEFINES=("MACRO1", "MACRO2"))
               print("CPPDEFINES =", env['CPPDEFINES'])
               env.Append(CPPDEFINES=[("MACRO3", "MACRO4")])
               print("CPPDEFINES =", env['CPPDEFINES'])
               print("CPPDEFINES will expand to", env.subst('$_CPPDEFFLAGS'))

               scons: `.' is up to date.

           See <b>$CPPDEFINES</b> for more details.

           Appending a string <u>val</u> to a dictonary-typed construction variable enters <u>val</u> as the key in the
           dictionary, and None as its value. Using a tuple type to supply a key, value only works for the
           special case of <b>$CPPDEFINES</b> described above.

           Although most combinations of types work without needing to know the details, some combinations do
           not make sense and Python raises an exception.

           When using <b>env.Append</b> to modify construction variables which are path specifications (conventionally,
           the names of such end in PATH), it is recommended to add the values as a list of strings, even if you
           are only adding a single string. The same goes for adding library names to <b>$LIBS</b>.

               env.Append(CPPPATH=["#/include"])

           See also <b>env.AppendUnique</b>, <b>env.Prepend</b> and <b>env.PrependUnique</b>.

       <u>env</u>.AppendENVPath(<u>name,</u> <u>newpath,</u> <u>[envname,</u> <u>sep,</u> <u>delete_existing=False]</u>)
           Append path elements specified by <u>newpath</u> to the given search path string or list <u>name</u> in mapping
           <u>envname</u> in the construction environment. Supplying <u>envname</u> is optional: the default is the execution
           environment <b>$ENV</b>. Optional <u>sep</u> is used as the search path separator, the default is the platform's
           separator (os.pathsep). A path element will only appear once. Any duplicates in <u>newpath</u> are dropped,
           keeping the last appearing (to preserve path order). If <u>delete_existing</u> is <b>False</b> (the default) any
           addition duplicating an existing path element is ignored; if <u>delete_existing</u> is <b>True</b> the existing
           value will be dropped and the path element will be added at the end. To help maintain uniqueness all
           paths are normalized (using os.path.normpath and os.path.normcase).

           Example:

               print('before:', env['ENV']['INCLUDE'])
               include_path = '/foo/bar:/foo'
               env.AppendENVPath('INCLUDE', include_path)
               print('after:', env['ENV']['INCLUDE'])

           Yields:

               before: /foo:/biz
               after: /biz:/foo/bar:/foo

           See also <b>env.PrependENVPath</b>.

       <u>env</u>.AppendUnique(<u>key=val,</u> <u>[...],</u> <u>[delete_existing=False]</u>)
           Append values to construction variables in the current construction environment, maintaining
           uniqueness. Works like <b>env.Append</b>, except that values that would become duplicates are not added. If
           <u>delete_existing</u> is set to a true value, then for any duplicate, the existing instance of <u>val</u> is first
           removed, then <u>val</u> is appended, having the effect of moving it to the end.

           Example:

               env.AppendUnique(CCFLAGS='-g', FOO=['foo.yyy'])

           See also <b>env.Append</b>, <b>env.Prepend</b> and <b>env.PrependUnique</b>.

       <b>Builder</b>(<u>action,</u> <u>[arguments]</u>), <u>env</u>.Builder(<u>action,</u> <u>[arguments]</u>)
           Creates a Builder object for the specified <u>action</u>. See the manpage section "Builder Objects" for a
           complete explanation of the arguments and behavior.

           Note that the <b>env.Builder</b>() form of the invocation will expand construction variables in any
           arguments strings, including the <u>action</u> argument, at the time it is called using the construction
           variables in the <u>env</u> construction environment through which <b>env.Builder</b> was called. The <b>Builder</b> form
           delays all variable expansion until after the Builder object is actually called.

       <b>CacheDir</b>(<u>cache_dir,</u> <u>custom_class=None</u>), <u>env</u>.CacheDir(<u>cache_dir,</u> <u>custom_class=None</u>)
           Direct <b>scons</b> to maintain a derived-file cache in <u>cache_dir</u>. The derived files in the cache will be
           shared among all the builds specifying the same <u>cache_dir</u>. Specifying a <u>cache_dir</u> of <b>None</b> disables
           derived file caching.

           When specifying a <u>custom_class</u> which should be a class type which is a subclass of
           SCons.CacheDir.CacheDir, SCons will internally invoke this class to use for performing caching
           operations. This argument is optional and if left to default <b>None</b>, will use the default
           SCons.CacheDir.CacheDir class.

           Calling the environment method <b>env.CacheDir</b> limits the effect to targets built through the specified
           construction environment. Calling the global function <b>CacheDir</b> sets a global default that will be
           used by all targets built through construction environments that do not set up environment-specific
           caching by calling <b>env.CacheDir</b>.

           When derived-file caching is being used and <b>scons</b> finds a derived file that needs to be rebuilt, it
           will first look in the cache to see if a file with matching build signature exists (indicating the
           input file(s) and build action(s) were identical to those for the current target), and if so, will
           retrieve the file from the cache.  <b>scons</b> will report Retrieved `file' from cache instead of the
           normal build message. If the derived file is not present in the cache, <b>scons</b> will build it and then
           place a copy of the built file in the cache, identified by its build signature, for future use.

           The Retrieved `file' from cache messages are useful for human consumption, but less so when comparing
           log files between <b>scons</b> runs which will show differences that are noisy and not actually significant.
           To disable, use the <b>--cache-show</b> option. With this option, <b>scons</b> will print the action that would
           have been used to build the file without considering cache retrieval.

           Derived-file caching may be disabled for any invocation of <b>scons</b> by giving the <b>--cache-disable</b>
           command line option. Cache updating may be disabled, leaving cache fetching enabled, by giving the
           <b>--cache-readonly</b>.

           If the <b>--cache-force</b> option is used, <b>scons</b> will place a copy of <u>all</u> derived files in the cache, even
           if they already existed and were not built by this invocation. This is useful to populate a cache the
           first time a <u>cache_dir</u> is used for a build, or to bring a cache up to date after a build with cache
           updating disabled (<b>--cache-disable</b> or <b>--cache-readonly</b>) has been done.

           The <b>NoCache</b> method can be used to disable caching of specific files. This can be useful if inputs
           and/or outputs of some tool are impossible to predict or prohibitively large.

           Note that (at this time) SCons provides no facilities for managing the derived-file cache. It is up
           to the developer to arrange for cache pruning, expiry, etc. if needed.

       <b>Clean</b>(<u>targets,</u> <u>files_or_dirs</u>), <u>env</u>.Clean(<u>targets,</u> <u>files_or_dirs</u>)
           This specifies a list of files or directories which should be removed whenever the targets are
           specified with the <b>-c</b> command line option. The specified targets may be a list or an individual
           target. Multiple calls to <b>Clean</b> are legal, and create new targets or add files and directories to the
           clean list for the specified targets.

           Multiple files or directories should be specified either as separate arguments to the <b>Clean</b> method,
           or as a list.  <b>Clean</b> will also accept the return value of any of the construction environment Builder
           methods. Examples:

           The related <b>NoClean</b> function overrides calling <b>Clean</b> for the same target, and any targets passed to
           both functions will <u>not</u> be removed by the <b>-c</b> option.

           Examples:

               Clean('foo', ['bar', 'baz'])
               Clean('dist', env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))
               Clean(['foo', 'bar'], 'something_else_to_clean')

           In this example, installing the project creates a subdirectory for the documentation. This statement
           causes the subdirectory to be removed if the project is deinstalled.

               Clean(docdir, os.path.join(docdir, projectname))

       <u>env</u>.Clone(<u>[key=val,</u> <u>...]</u>)
           Returns a separate copy of a construction environment. If there are any keyword arguments specified,
           they are added to the returned copy, overwriting any existing values for the keywords.

           Example:

               env2 = env.Clone()
               env3 = env.Clone(CCFLAGS='-g')

           Additionally, a list of tools and a toolpath may be specified, as in the <b>Environment</b> constructor:

               def MyTool(env):
                   env['FOO'] = 'bar'

               env4 = env.Clone(tools=['msvc', MyTool])

           The <u>parse_flags</u> keyword argument is also recognized to allow merging command-line style arguments
           into the appropriate construction variables (see <b>env.MergeFlags</b>).

               # create an environment for compiling programs that use wxWidgets
               wx_env = env.Clone(parse_flags='!wx-config --cflags --cxxflags')

       <b>Command</b>(<u>target,</u> <u>source,</u> <u>action,</u> <u>[key=val,</u> <u>...]</u>), <u>env</u>.Command(<u>target,</u> <u>source,</u> <u>action,</u> <u>[key=val,</u> <u>...]</u>)
           Executes a specific <u>action</u> (or list of actions) to build a <u>target</u> file or files from a <u>source</u> file or
           files. This is more convenient than defining a separate Builder object for a single special-case
           build.

           The <b>Command</b> function accepts <u>source_scanner</u>, <u>target_scanner</u>, <u>source_factory</u>, and <u>target_factory</u>
           keyword arguments. These arguments can be used to specify a Scanner object that will be used to apply
           a custom scanner for a source or target. For example, the global DirScanner object can be used if any
           of the sources will be directories that must be scanned on-disk for changes to files that aren't
           already specified in other Builder of function calls. The <u>*_factory</u> arguments take a factory function
           that <b>Command</b> will use to turn any sources or targets specified as strings into SCons Nodes. See the
           manpage section "Builder Objects" for more information about how these arguments work in a Builder.

           Any other keyword arguments specified override any same-named existing construction variables.

           An action can be an external command, specified as a string, or a callable Python object; see the
           manpage section "Action Objects" for more complete information. Also note that a string specifying an
           external command may be preceded by an at-sign (@) to suppress printing the command in question, or
           by a hyphen (-) to ignore the exit status of the external command.

           Examples:

               env.Command(
                   target='foo.out',
                   source='foo.in',
                   action="$FOO_BUILD &lt; $SOURCES &gt; $TARGET"
               )

               env.Command(
                   target='bar.out',
                   source='bar.in',
                   action=["rm -f $TARGET", "$BAR_BUILD &lt; $SOURCES &gt; $TARGET"],
                   ENV={'PATH': '<a href="file:/usr/local/bin/">/usr/local/bin/</a>'},
               )

               import os
               def rename(env, target, source):
                   os.rename('.tmp', str(target[0]))

               env.Command(
                   target='baz.out',
                   source='baz.in',
                   action=["$BAZ_BUILD &lt; $SOURCES &gt; .tmp", rename],
               )

           Note that the <b>Command</b> function will usually assume, by default, that the specified targets and/or
           sources are Files, if no other part of the configuration identifies what type of entries they are. If
           necessary, you can explicitly specify that targets or source nodes should be treated as directories
           by using the <b>Dir</b> or <b>env.Dir</b> functions.

           Examples:

               env.Command('ddd.list', Dir('ddd'), 'ls -l $SOURCE &gt; $TARGET')

               env['DISTDIR'] = 'destination/directory'
               env.Command(env.Dir('$DISTDIR')), None, make_distdir)

           Also note that SCons will usually automatically create any directory necessary to hold a target file,
           so you normally don't need to create directories by hand.

       <b>Configure</b>(<u>env,</u> <u>[custom_tests,</u> <u>conf_dir,</u> <u>log_file,</u> <u>config_h]</u>), <u>env</u>.Configure(<u>[custom_tests,</u> <u>conf_dir,</u>
       <u>log_file,</u> <u>config_h]</u>)
           Creates a Configure object for integrated functionality similar to GNU autoconf. See the manpage
           section "Configure Contexts" for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior.

       <b>Decider</b>(<u>function</u>), <u>env</u>.Decider(<u>function</u>)
           Specifies that all up-to-date decisions for targets built through this construction environment will
           be handled by the specified <u>function</u>.  <u>function</u> can be the name of a function or one of the following
           strings that specify the predefined decision function that will be applied:

           "timestamp-newer"
               Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date and rebuilt if the dependency's timestamp
               is newer than the target file's timestamp. This is the behavior of the classic Make utility, and
               make can be used a synonym for timestamp-newer.

           "timestamp-match"
               Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date and rebuilt if the dependency's timestamp
               is different than the timestamp recorded the last time the target was built. This provides
               behavior very similar to the classic Make utility (in particular, files are not opened up so that
               their contents can be checksummed) except that the target will also be rebuilt if a dependency
               file has been restored to a version with an <u>earlier</u> timestamp, such as can happen when restoring
               files from backup archives.

           "content"
               Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date and rebuilt if the dependency's content
               has changed since the last time the target was built, as determined be performing an checksum on
               the dependency's contents and comparing it to the checksum recorded the last time the target was
               built.  MD5 can be used as a synonym for content, but it is deprecated.

           "content-timestamp"
               Specifies that a target shall be considered out of date and rebuilt if the dependency's content
               has changed since the last time the target was built, except that dependencies with a timestamp
               that matches the last time the target was rebuilt will be assumed to be up-to-date and <u>not</u>
               rebuilt. This provides behavior very similar to the content behavior of always checksumming file
               contents, with an optimization of not checking the contents of files whose timestamps haven't
               changed. The drawback is that SCons will <u>not</u> detect if a file's content has changed but its
               timestamp is the same, as might happen in an automated script that runs a build, updates a file,
               and runs the build again, all within a single second.  MD5-timestamp can be used as a synonym for
               content-timestamp, but it is deprecated.

           Examples:

               # Use exact timestamp matches by default.
               Decider('timestamp-match')

               # Use hash content signatures for any targets built
               # with the attached construction environment.
               env.Decider('content')

           In addition to the above already-available functions, the <u>function</u> argument may be a Python function
           you supply. Such a function must accept the following four arguments:

           <u>dependency</u>
               The Node (file) which should cause the <u>target</u> to be rebuilt if it has "changed" since the last
               tme <u>target</u> was built.

           <u>target</u>
               The Node (file) being built. In the normal case, this is what should get rebuilt if the
               <u>dependency</u> has "changed."

           <u>prev_ni</u>
               Stored information about the state of the <u>dependency</u> the last time the <u>target</u> was built. This can
               be consulted to match various file characteristics such as the timestamp, size, or content
               signature.

           <u>repo_node</u>
               If set, use this Node instead of the one specified by <u>dependency</u> to determine if the dependency
               has changed. This argument is optional so should be written as a default argument (typically it
               would be written as <u>repo_node=None</u>). A caller will normally only set this if the target only
               exists in a Repository.

           The <u>function</u> should return a value which evaluates <b>True</b> if the <u>dependency</u> has "changed" since the
           last time the <u>target</u> was built (indicating that the target <u>should</u> be rebuilt), and a value which
           evaluates <b>False</b> otherwise (indicating that the target should <u>not</u> be rebuilt). Note that the decision
           can be made using whatever criteria are appopriate. Ignoring some or all of the function arguments is
           perfectly normal.

           Example:

               def my_decider(dependency, target, prev_ni, repo_node=None):
                   return not os.path.exists(str(target))

               <a href="../manmy_decider/env.Decider.my_decider.html">env.Decider</a>(my_decider)

       <b>Default</b>(<u>target[,</u> <u>...]</u>), <u>env</u>.Default(<u>target[,</u> <u>...]</u>)
           Specify default targets to the SCons target selection mechanism. Any call to <b>Default</b> will cause SCons
           to use the defined default target list instead of its built-in algorithm for determining default
           targets (see the manpage section "Target Selection").

           <u>target</u> may be one or more strings, a list of strings, a NodeList as returned by a Builder, or <b>None</b>. A
           string <u>target</u> may be the name of a file or directory, or a target previously defined by a call to
           <b>Alias</b> (defining the alias later will still create the alias, but it will not be recognized as a
           default). Calls to <b>Default</b> are additive. A <u>target</u> of None will clear any existing default target
           list; subsequent calls to <b>Default</b> will add to the (now empty) default target list like normal.

           Both forms of this call affect the same global list of default targets; the construction environment
           method applies construction variable expansion to the targets.

           The current list of targets added using <b>Default</b> is available in the <u>DEFAULT_TARGETS</u> list (see below).

           Examples:

               Default('foo', 'bar', 'baz')
               env.Default(['a', 'b', 'c'])
               hello = env.Program('hello', 'hello.c')
               env.Default(hello)

       <b>DefaultEnvironment</b>(<u>[**kwargs]</u>)
           Instantiates and returns the default construction environment object. The default environment is used
           internally by SCons in order to execute many of the global functions in this list (that is, those not
           called as methods of a specific construction environment). It is not mandatory to call
           <b>DefaultEnvironment</b>: the default environment will be instantiated automatically when the build phase
           begins if the function has not been called, however calling it explicitly gives the opportunity to
           affect and examine the contents of the default environment.

           The default environment is a singleton, so the keyword arguments affect it only on the first call, on
           subsequent calls the already-constructed object is returned and any keyword arguments are silently
           ignored. The default environment can be modified after instantiation in the same way as any
           construction environment. Modifying the default environment has no effect on the construction
           environment constructed by an <b>Environment</b> or <b>Clone</b> call.

       <b>Depends</b>(<u>target,</u> <u>dependency</u>), <u>env</u>.Depends(<u>target,</u> <u>dependency</u>)
           Specifies an explicit dependency; the <u>target</u> will be rebuilt whenever the <u>dependency</u> has changed.
           Both the specified <u>target</u> and <u>dependency</u> can be a string (usually the path name of a file or
           directory) or Node objects, or a list of strings or Node objects (such as returned by a Builder
           call). This should only be necessary for cases where the dependency is not caught by a Scanner for
           the file.

           Example:

               env.Depends('foo', 'other-input-file-for-foo')

               mylib = env.Library('mylib.c')
               installed_lib = env.Install('lib', mylib)
               bar = env.Program('bar.c')

               # Arrange for the library to be copied into the installation
               # directory before trying to build the "bar" program.
               # (Note that this is for example only.  A "real" library
               # dependency would normally be configured through the $LIBS
               # and $LIBPATH variables, not using an env.Depends() call.)

               env.Depends(bar, installed_lib)

       <u>env</u>.Detect(<u>progs</u>)
           Find an executable from one or more choices: <u>progs</u> may be a string or a list of strings. Returns the
           first value from <u>progs</u> that was found, or <b>None</b>. Executable is searched by checking the paths in the
           execution environment (<u>env</u>['ENV']['PATH']). On Windows systems, additionally applies the filename
           suffixes found in the execution environment (<u>env</u>['ENV']['PATHEXT']) but will not include any such
           extension in the return value.  <b>env.Detect</b> is a wrapper around <b>env.WhereIs</b>.

       <u>env</u>.Dictionary(<u>[vars]</u>)
           Returns a dictionary object containing the construction variables in the construction environment. If
           there are any arguments specified, the values of the specified construction variables are returned as
           a string (if one argument) or as a list of strings.

           Example:

               cvars = env.Dictionary()
               cc_values = env.Dictionary('CC', 'CCFLAGS', 'CCCOM')

       <b>Dir</b>(<u>name,</u> <u>[directory]</u>), <u>env</u>.Dir(<u>name,</u> <u>[directory]</u>)
           Returns Directory Node(s). A Directory Node is an object that represents a directory.  <u>name</u> can be a
           relative or absolute path or a list of such paths.  <u>directory</u> is an optional directory that will be
           used as the parent directory. If no <u>directory</u> is specified, the current script's directory is used as
           the parent.

           If <u>name</u> is a single pathname, the corresponding node is returned. If <u>name</u> is a list, SCons returns a
           list of nodes. Construction variables are expanded in <u>name</u>.

           Directory Nodes can be used anywhere you would supply a string as a directory name to a Builder
           method or function. Directory Nodes have attributes and methods that are useful in many situations;
           see manpage section "File and Directory Nodes" for more information.

       <u>env</u>.Dump(<u>[key],</u> <u>[format]</u>)
           Serializes construction variables to a string. The method supports the following formats specified by
           <u>format</u>:

           pretty
               Returns a pretty printed representation of the environment (if <u>format</u> is not specified, this is
               the default).

           json
               Returns a JSON-formatted string representation of the environment.

           If <u>key</u> is <b>None</b> (the default) the entire dictionary of construction variables is serialized. If
           supplied, it is taken as the name of a construction variable whose value is serialized.

           This SConstruct:

               env=Environment()
               print(env.Dump('CCCOM'))

           will print:

               '$CC -c -o $TARGET $CCFLAGS $CPPFLAGS $_CPPDEFFLAGS $_CPPINCFLAGS $SOURCES'

           While this SConstruct:

               env = Environment()
               print(env.Dump())

           will print:

               { 'AR': 'ar',
                 'ARCOM': '$AR $ARFLAGS $TARGET $SOURCES\n$RANLIB $RANLIBFLAGS $TARGET',
                 'ARFLAGS': ['r'],
                 'AS': 'as',
                 'ASCOM': '$AS $ASFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCES',
                 'ASFLAGS': [],
                 ...

       <b>EnsurePythonVersion</b>(<u>major,</u> <u>minor</u>)
           Ensure that the Python version is at least <u>major</u>.<u>minor</u>. This function will print out an error message
           and exit SCons with a non-zero exit code if the actual Python version is not late enough.

           Example:

               EnsurePythonVersion(2,2)

       <b>EnsureSConsVersion</b>(<u>major,</u> <u>minor,</u> <u>[revision]</u>)
           Ensure that the SCons version is at least <u>major.minor</u>, or <u>major.minor.revision</u>. if <u>revision</u> is
           specified. This function will print out an error message and exit SCons with a non-zero exit code if
           the actual SCons version is not late enough.

           Examples:

               EnsureSConsVersion(0,14)

               EnsureSConsVersion(0,96,90)

       <b>Environment</b>(<u>[key=value,</u> <u>...]</u>), <u>env</u>.Environment(<u>[key=value,</u> <u>...]</u>)
           Return a new construction environment initialized with the specified <u>key</u>=<u>value</u> pairs. The keyword
           arguments <u>parse_flags</u>, <u>platform</u>, <u>toolpath</u>, <u>tools</u> and <u>variables</u> are also specially recognized. See the
           manpage section "Construction Environments" for more details.

       <b>Execute</b>(<u>action,</u> <u>[actionargs</u> <u>...]</u>), <u>env</u>.Execute(<u>action,</u> <u>[actionargs</u> <u>...]</u>)
           Executes an Action.  <u>action</u> may be an Action object or it may be a command-line string, list of
           commands, or executable Python function, each of which will first be converted into an Action object
           and then executed. Any additional arguments to <b>Execute</b> are passed on to the <b>Action</b> factory function
           which actually creates the Action object (see the manpage section Action Objects for a description).
           Example:

               Execute(Copy('file.out', 'file.in'))

           <b>Execute</b> performs its action immediately, as part of the SConscript-reading phase. There are no
           sources or targets declared in an <b>Execute</b> call, so any objects it manipulates will not be tracked as
           part of the SCons dependency graph. In the example above, neither file.out nor file.in will be
           tracked objects.

           <b>Execute</b> returns the exit value of the command or return value of the Python function.  <b>scons</b> prints
           an error message if the executed <u>action</u> fails (exits with or returns a non-zero value), however it
           does <u>not</u>, automatically terminate the build for such a failure. If you want the build to stop in
           response to a failed <b>Execute</b> call, you must explicitly check for a non-zero return value:

               if Execute("mkdir sub/dir/ectory"):
                   # The mkdir failed, don't try to build.
                   <a href="../man1/Exit.1.html">Exit</a>(1)

       <b>Exit</b>(<u>[value]</u>)
           This tells <b>scons</b> to exit immediately with the specified <u>value</u>. A default exit value of 0 (zero) is
           used if no value is specified.

       <b>Export</b>(<u>[vars...],</u> <u>[key=value...]</u>), <u>env</u>.Export(<u>[vars...],</u> <u>[key=value...]</u>)
           Exports variables from the current SConscript file to a global collection where they can be imported
           by other SConscript files.  <u>vars</u> may be one or more strings representing variable names to be
           exported. If a string contains whitespace, it is split into separate strings, as if multiple string
           arguments had been given. A <u>vars</u> argument may also be a dictionary, which can be used to map
           variables to different names when exported. Keyword arguments can be used to provide names and their
           values.

           <b>Export</b> calls are cumulative. Specifying a previously exported variable will overwrite the earlier
           value. Both local variables and global variables can be exported.

           Examples:

               env = Environment()
               # Make env available for all SConscript files to Import().
               Export("env")

               package = 'my_name'
               # Make env and package available for all SConscript files:.
               Export("env", "package")

               # Make env and package available for all SConscript files:
               Export(["env", "package"])

               # Make env available using the name debug:
               Export(debug=env)

               # Make env available using the name debug:
               Export({"debug": env})

           Note that the <b>SConscript</b> function supports an <u>exports</u> argument that allows exporting a variable or
           set of variables to a specific SConscript file or files. See the description below.

       <b>File</b>(<u>name,</u> <u>[directory]</u>), <u>env</u>.File(<u>name,</u> <u>[directory]</u>)
           Returns File Node(s). A File Node is an object that represents a file.  <u>name</u> can be a relative or
           absolute path or a list of such paths.  <u>directory</u> is an optional directory that will be used as the
           parent directory. If no <u>directory</u> is specified, the current script's directory is used as the parent.

           If <u>name</u> is a single pathname, the corresponding node is returned. If <u>name</u> is a list, SCons returns a
           list of nodes. Construction variables are expanded in <u>name</u>.

           File Nodes can be used anywhere you would supply a string as a file name to a Builder method or
           function. File Nodes have attributes and methods that are useful in many situations; see manpage
           section "File and Directory Nodes" for more information.

       <b>FindFile</b>(<u>file,</u> <u>dirs</u>), <u>env</u>.FindFile(<u>file,</u> <u>dirs</u>)
           Search for <u>file</u> in the path specified by <u>dirs</u>.  <u>dirs</u> may be a list of directory names or a single
           directory name. In addition to searching for files that exist in the filesystem, this function also
           searches for derived files that have not yet been built.

           Example:

               foo = env.FindFile('foo', ['dir1', 'dir2'])

       <b>FindInstalledFiles</b>(), <u>env</u>.FindInstalledFiles()
           Returns the list of targets set up by the <b>Install</b> or <b>InstallAs</b> builders.

           This function serves as a convenient method to select the contents of a binary package.

           Example:

               Install('<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>', ['executable_a', 'executable_b'])

               # will return the file node list
               # ['/bin/executable_a', '/bin/executable_b']
               FindInstalledFiles()

               Install('<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a>', ['some_library'])

               # will return the file node list
               # ['/bin/executable_a', '/bin/executable_b', '/lib/some_library']
               FindInstalledFiles()

       <b>FindPathDirs</b>(<u>variable</u>)
           Returns a function (actually a callable Python object) intended to be used as the <u>path_function</u> of a
           Scanner object. The returned object will look up the specified <u>variable</u> in a construction environment
           and treat the construction variable's value as a list of directory paths that should be searched
           (like <b>$CPPPATH</b>, <b>$LIBPATH</b>, etc.).

           Note that use of <b>FindPathDirs</b> is generally preferable to writing your own <u>path_function</u> for the
           following reasons: 1) The returned list will contain all appropriate directories found in source
           trees (when <b>VariantDir</b> is used) or in code repositories (when <b>Repository</b> or the <b>-Y</b> option are used).
           2) scons will identify expansions of <u>variable</u> that evaluate to the same list of directories as, in
           fact, the same list, and avoid re-scanning the directories for files, when possible.

           Example:

               def my_scan(node, env, path, arg):
                   # Code to scan file contents goes here...
                   return include_files

               scanner = Scanner(name = 'myscanner',
                                 function = my_scan,
                                 path_function = FindPathDirs('MYPATH'))

       <b>FindSourceFiles</b>(<u>node='"."'</u>), <u>env</u>.FindSourceFiles(<u>node='"."'</u>)
           Returns the list of nodes which serve as the source of the built files. It does so by inspecting the
           dependency tree starting at the optional argument <u>node</u> which defaults to the '"."'-node. It will then
           return all leaves of <u>node</u>. These are all children which have no further children.

           This function is a convenient method to select the contents of a Source Package.

           Example:

               Program('src/main_a.c')
               Program('src/main_b.c')
               Program('main_c.c')

               # returns ['main_c.c', 'src/main_a.c', 'SConstruct', 'src/main_b.c']
               FindSourceFiles()

               # returns ['src/main_b.c', 'src/main_a.c' ]
               FindSourceFiles('src')

           As you can see build support files (SConstruct in the above example) will also be returned by this
           function.

       <b>Flatten</b>(<u>sequence</u>), <u>env</u>.Flatten(<u>sequence</u>)
           Takes a sequence (that is, a Python list or tuple) that may contain nested sequences and returns a
           flattened list containing all of the individual elements in any sequence. This can be helpful for
           collecting the lists returned by calls to Builders; other Builders will automatically flatten lists
           specified as input, but direct Python manipulation of these lists does not.

           Examples:

               foo = Object('foo.c')
               bar = Object('bar.c')

               # Because `foo' and `bar' are lists returned by the Object() Builder,
               # `objects' will be a list containing nested lists:
               objects = ['f1.o', foo, 'f2.o', bar, 'f3.o']

               # Passing such a list to another Builder is all right because
               # the Builder will flatten the list automatically:
               Program(source = objects)

               # If you need to manipulate the list directly using Python, you need to
               # call Flatten() yourself, or otherwise handle nested lists:
               for object in Flatten(objects):
                   print(str(object))

       <b>GetBuildFailures</b>()
           Returns a list of exceptions for the actions that failed while attempting to build targets. Each
           element in the returned list is a BuildError object with the following attributes that record various
           aspects of the build failure:

           .node The node that was being built when the build failure occurred.

           .status The numeric exit status returned by the command or Python function that failed when trying to
           build the specified Node.

           .errstr The SCons error string describing the build failure. (This is often a generic message like
           "Error 2" to indicate that an executed command exited with a status of 2.)

           .filename The name of the file or directory that actually caused the failure. This may be different
           from the .node attribute. For example, if an attempt to build a target named sub/dir/target fails
           because the sub/dir directory could not be created, then the .node attribute will be sub/dir/target
           but the .filename attribute will be sub/dir.

           .executor The SCons Executor object for the target Node being built. This can be used to retrieve the
           construction environment used for the failed action.

           .action The actual SCons Action object that failed. This will be one specific action out of the
           possible list of actions that would have been executed to build the target.

           .command The actual expanded command that was executed and failed, after expansion of <b>$TARGET</b>,
           <b>$SOURCE</b>, and other construction variables.

           Note that the <b>GetBuildFailures</b> function will always return an empty list until any build failure has
           occurred, which means that <b>GetBuildFailures</b> will always return an empty list while the SConscript
           files are being read. Its primary intended use is for functions that will be executed before SCons
           exits by passing them to the standard Python <b>atexit.register</b>() function. Example:

               import atexit

               def print_build_failures():
                   from SCons.Script import GetBuildFailures
                   for bf in GetBuildFailures():
                       print("%s failed: %s" % (bf.node, bf.errstr))

               atexit.register(print_build_failures)

       <b>GetBuildPath</b>(<u>file,</u> <u>[...]</u>), <u>env</u>.GetBuildPath(<u>file,</u> <u>[...]</u>)
           Returns the <b>scons</b> path name (or names) for the specified <u>file</u> (or files). The specified <u>file</u> or files
           may be <b>scons</b> Nodes or strings representing path names.

       <b>GetLaunchDir</b>()
           Returns the absolute path name of the directory from which <b>scons</b> was initially invoked. This can be
           useful when using the <b>-u</b>, <b>-U</b> or <b>-D</b> options, which internally change to the directory in which the
           SConstruct file is found.

       <b>GetOption</b>(<u>name</u>), <u>env</u>.GetOption(<u>name</u>)
           Query the value of settable options which may have been set on the command line, or by using the
           <b>SetOption</b> function. The value of the option is returned in a type matching how the option was
           declared - see the documentation for the corresponding command line option for information about each
           specific option.

           <u>name</u> can be an entry from the following table, which shows the corresponding command line arguments
           that could affect the value.  <u>name</u> can be also be the destination variable name from a
           project-specific option added using the <b>AddOption</b> function, as long as that addition has been
           processed prior to the <b>GetOption</b> call in the SConscript files.

       <b>Glob</b>(<u>pattern,</u> <u>[ondisk=True,</u> <u>source=False,</u> <u>strings=False,</u> <u>exclude=None]</u>), <u>env</u>.Glob(<u>pattern,</u> <u>[ondisk=True,</u>
       <u>source=False,</u> <u>strings=False,</u> <u>exclude=None]</u>)
           Returns a possibly empty list of Nodes (or strings) that match pathname specification <u>pattern</u>.
           <u>pattern</u> can be absolute, top-relative, or (most commonly) relative to the directory of the current
           SConscript file.  <b>Glob</b> matches both files stored on disk and Nodes which SCons already knows about,
           even if any corresponding file is not currently stored on disk. The evironment method form (<b>env.Glob</b>)
           performs string substition on <u>pattern</u> and returns whatever matches the resulting expanded pattern.
           The results are sorted, unlike for the similar Python glob.glob function, to ensure build order will
           be stable.

           <u>pattern</u> can contain POSIX-style shell metacharacters for matching:
           ┌─────────┬───────────────────────────────────┐
           │ <b>Pattern</b> │ <b>Meaning</b>                           │
           ├─────────┼───────────────────────────────────┤
           │ *       │ matches everything                │
           ├─────────┼───────────────────────────────────┤
           │ ?       │ matches any single character      │
           ├─────────┼───────────────────────────────────┤
           │ [seq]   │ matches any character in <u>seq</u>      │
           │         │       (can be a list or a range). │
           ├─────────┼───────────────────────────────────┤
           │ [!seq]  │ matches any character not in <u>seq</u>  │
           └─────────┴───────────────────────────────────┘

           For a literal match, wrap the metacharacter in brackets to escape the normal behavior. For example,
           '[?]' matches the character '?'.

           Filenames starting with a dot are specially handled - they can only be matched by patterns that start
           with a dot (or have a dot immediately following a pathname separator character, or slash), they are
           not not matched by the metacharacters. Metacharacter matches also do not span directory separators.

           <b>Glob</b> understands repositories (see the <b>Repository</b> function) and source directories (see the
           <b>VariantDir</b> function) and returns a Node (or string, if so configured) match in the local (SConscript)
           directory if a matching Node is found anywhere in a corresponding repository or source directory.

           If the optional <u>ondisk</u> argument evaluates false, the search for matches on disk is disabled, and only
           matches from already-configured File or Dir Nodes are returned. The default is to return Nodes for
           matches on disk as well.

           If the optional <u>source</u> argument evaluates true, and the local directory is a variant directory, then
           <b>Glob</b> returnes Nodes from the corresponding source directory, rather than the local directory.

           If the optional <u>strings</u> argument evaluates true, <b>Glob</b> returns matches as strings, rather than Nodes.
           The returned strings will be relative to the local (SConscript) directory. (Note that while this may
           make it easier to perform arbitrary manipulation of file names, it loses the context SCons would have
           in the Node, so if the returned strings are passed to a different SConscript file, any Node
           translation there will be relative to that SConscript directory, not to the original SConscript
           directory.)

           The optional <u>exclude</u> argument may be set to a pattern or a list of patterns descibing files or
           directories to filter out of the match list. Elements matching a least one specified pattern will be
           excluded. These patterns use the same syntax as for <u>pattern</u>.

           Examples:

               Program("foo", Glob("*.c"))
               Zip("/tmp/everything", Glob(".??*") + Glob("*"))
               sources = Glob("*.cpp", exclude=["os_*_specific_*.cpp"]) \
                   + Glob("os_%s_specific_*.cpp" % currentOS)

       <b>Help</b>(<u>text,</u> <u>append=False</u>), <u>env</u>.Help(<u>text,</u> <u>append=False</u>)
           Specifies a local help message to be printed if the <b>-h</b> argument is given to <b>scons</b>. Subsequent calls
           to <b>Help</b> append <u>text</u> to the previously defined local help text.

           For the first call to <b>Help</b> only, if <u>append</u> is <b>False</b> (the default) any local help message generated
           through <b>AddOption</b> calls is replaced. If <u>append</u> is <b>True</b>, <u>text</u> is appended to the existing help text.

       <b>Ignore</b>(<u>target,</u> <u>dependency</u>), <u>env</u>.Ignore(<u>target,</u> <u>dependency</u>)
           Ignores <u>dependency</u> when deciding if <u>target</u> needs to be rebuilt.  <u>target</u> and <u>dependency</u> can each be a
           single filename or Node or a list of filenames or Nodes.

           <b>Ignore</b> can also be used to remove a target from the default build by specifying the directory the
           target will be built in as <u>target</u> and the file you want to skip selecting for building as <u>dependency</u>.
           Note that this only removes the target from the default target selection algorithm: if it is a
           dependency of another object being built SCons still builds it normally. See the third and forth
           examples below.

           Examples:

               env.Ignore('foo', 'foo.c')
               env.Ignore('bar', ['bar1.h', 'bar2.h'])
               env.Ignore('.', 'foobar.obj')
               env.Ignore('bar', 'bar/foobar.obj')

       <b>Import</b>(<u>vars...</u>), <u>env</u>.Import(<u>vars...</u>)
           Imports variables into the current SConscript file.  <u>vars</u> must be strings representing names of
           variables which have been previously exported either by the <b>Export</b> function or by the <u>exports</u>
           argument to <b>SConscript</b>. Variables exported by <b>SConscript</b> take precedence. Multiple variable names can
           be passed to <b>Import</b> as separate arguments or as words in a space-separated string. The wildcard "*"
           can be used to import all available variables.

           Examples:

               Import("env")
               Import("env", "variable")
               Import(["env", "variable"])
               Import("*")

       <b>Literal</b>(<u>string</u>), <u>env</u>.Literal(<u>string</u>)
           The specified <u>string</u> will be preserved as-is and not have construction variables expanded.

       <b>Local</b>(<u>targets</u>), <u>env</u>.Local(<u>targets</u>)
           The specified <u>targets</u> will have copies made in the local tree, even if an already up-to-date copy
           exists in a repository. Returns a list of the target Node or Nodes.

       <u>env</u>.MergeFlags(<u>arg,</u> <u>[unique]</u>)
           Merges values from <u>arg</u> into construction variables in the current construction environment. If <u>arg</u> is
           not a dictionary, it is converted to one by calling <b>env.ParseFlags</b> on the argument before the values
           are merged. Note that <u>arg</u> must be a single value, so multiple strings must be passed in as a list,
           not as separate arguments to <b>env.MergeFlags</b>.

           If unique is true (the default), duplicate values are not stored. When eliminating duplicate values,
           any construction variables that end with the string PATH keep the left-most unique value. All other
           construction variables keep the right-most unique value. If unique is false, values are added even if
           they are duplicates.

           Examples:

               # Add an optimization flag to $CCFLAGS.
               env.MergeFlags('-O3')

               # Combine the flags returned from running pkg-config with an optimization
               # flag and merge the result into the construction variables.
               env.MergeFlags(['!pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags', '-O3'])

               # Combine an optimization flag with the flags returned from running pkg-config
               # twice and merge the result into the construction variables.
               env.MergeFlags(
                   [
                       '-O3',
                       '!pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --cflags --libs',
                       '!pkg-config libpng12 --cflags --libs',
                   ]
               )

       <b>NoCache</b>(<u>target,</u> <u>...</u>), <u>env</u>.NoCache(<u>target,</u> <u>...</u>)
           Specifies a list of files which should <u>not</u> be cached whenever the <b>CacheDir</b> method has been activated.
           The specified targets may be a list or an individual target.

           Multiple files should be specified either as separate arguments to the <b>NoCache</b> method, or as a list.
           <b>NoCache</b> will also accept the return value of any of the construction environment Builder methods.

           Calling <b>NoCache</b> on directories and other non-File Node types has no effect because only File Nodes
           are cached.

           Examples:

               NoCache('foo.elf')
               NoCache(env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))

       <b>NoClean</b>(<u>target,</u> <u>...</u>), <u>env</u>.NoClean(<u>target,</u> <u>...</u>)
           Specifies a list of files or directories which should <u>not</u> be removed whenever the targets (or their
           dependencies) are specified with the <b>-c</b> command line option. The specified targets may be a list or
           an individual target. Multiple calls to <b>NoClean</b> are legal, and prevent each specified target from
           being removed by calls to the <b>-c</b> option.

           Multiple files or directories should be specified either as separate arguments to the <b>NoClean</b> method,
           or as a list.  <b>NoClean</b> will also accept the return value of any of the construction environment
           Builder methods.

           Calling <b>NoClean</b> for a target overrides calling <b>Clean</b> for the same target, and any targets passed to
           both functions will <u>not</u> be removed by the <b>-c</b> option.

           Examples:

               NoClean('foo.elf')
               NoClean(env.Program('hello', 'hello.c'))

       <u>env</u>.ParseConfig(<u>command,</u> <u>[function,</u> <u>unique]</u>)
           Updates the current construction environment with the values extracted from the output of running
           external <u>command</u>, by passing it to a helper <u>function</u>.  <u>command</u> may be a string or a list of strings
           representing the command and its arguments. If <u>function</u> is omitted or <b>None</b>, <b>env.MergeFlags</b> is used.
           By default, duplicate values are not added to any construction variables; you can specify
           <u>unique=False</u> to allow duplicate values to be added.

           <u>command</u> is executed using the SCons execution environment (that is, the construction variable <b>$ENV</b> in
           the current construction environment). If <u>command</u> needs additional information to operate properly,
           that needs to be set in the execution environment. For example, <b>pkg-config</b> may need a custom value
           set in the <b>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</b> environment variable.

           <b>env.MergeFlags</b> needs to understand the output produced by <u>command</u> in order to distribute it to
           appropriate construction variables.  <b>env.MergeFlags</b> uses a separate function to do that processing -
           see <b>env.ParseFlags</b> for the details, including a a table of options and corresponding construction
           variables. To provide alternative processing of the output of <u>command</u>, you can suppply a custom
           <u>function</u>, which must accept three arguments: the construction environment to modify, a string
           argument containing the output from running <u>command</u>, and the optional <u>unique</u> flag.

       <b>ParseDepends</b>(<u>filename,</u> <u>[must_exist,</u> <u>only_one]</u>), <u>env</u>.ParseDepends(<u>filename,</u> <u>[must_exist,</u> <u>only_one]</u>)
           Parses the contents of <u>filename</u> as a list of dependencies in the style of Make or mkdep, and
           explicitly establishes all of the listed dependencies.

           By default, it is not an error if <u>filename</u> does not exist. The optional <u>must_exist</u> argument may be
           set to <b>True</b> to have SCons raise an exception if the file does not exist, or is otherwise
           inaccessible.

           The optional <u>only_one</u> argument may be set to <b>True</b> to have SCons raise an exception if the file
           contains dependency information for more than one target. This can provide a small sanity check for
           files intended to be generated by, for example, the gcc -M flag, which should typically only write
           dependency information for one output file into a corresponding .d file.

           <u>filename</u> and all of the files listed therein will be interpreted relative to the directory of the
           SConscript file which calls the <b>ParseDepends</b> function.

       <u>env</u>.ParseFlags(<u>flags,</u> <u>...</u>)
           Parses one or more strings containing typical command-line flags for GCC-style tool chains and
           returns a dictionary with the flag values separated into the appropriate SCons construction
           variables. Intended as a companion to the <b>env.MergeFlags</b> method, but allows for the values in the
           returned dictionary to be modified, if necessary, before merging them into the construction
           environment. (Note that <b>env.MergeFlags</b> will call this method if its argument is not a dictionary, so
           it is usually not necessary to call <b>env.ParseFlags</b> directly unless you want to manipulate the
           values.)

           If the first character in any string is an exclamation mark (!), the rest of the string is executed
           as a command, and the output from the command is parsed as GCC tool chain command-line flags and
           added to the resulting dictionary. This can be used to call a *-config command typical of the POSIX
           programming environment (for example, <b>pkg-config</b>). Note that such a command is executed using the
           SCons execution environment; if the command needs additional information, that information needs to
           be explicitly provided. See <b>ParseConfig</b> for more details.

           Flag values are translated according to the prefix found, and added to the following construction
           variables:

               -arch                   CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
               -D                      CPPDEFINES
               -framework              FRAMEWORKS
               -frameworkdir=          FRAMEWORKPATH
               -fmerge-all-constants   CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
               -fopenmp                CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
               -fsanitize              CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
               -include                CCFLAGS
               -imacros                CCFLAGS
               -isysroot               CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
               -isystem                CCFLAGS
               -iquote                 CCFLAGS
               -idirafter              CCFLAGS
               -I                      CPPPATH
               -l                      LIBS
               -L                      LIBPATH
               -mno-cygwin             CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
               -mwindows               LINKFLAGS
               -openmp                 CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
               -pthread                CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS
               -std=                   CFLAGS
               -Wa,                    ASFLAGS, CCFLAGS
               -Wl,-rpath=             RPATH
               -Wl,-R,                 RPATH
               -Wl,-R                  RPATH
               -Wl,                    LINKFLAGS
               -Wp,                    CPPFLAGS
               -                       CCFLAGS
               +                       CCFLAGS, LINKFLAGS

           Any other strings not associated with options are assumed to be the names of libraries and added to
           the <b>$LIBS</b> construction variable.

           Examples (all of which produce the same result):

               dict = env.ParseFlags('-O2 -Dfoo -Dbar=1')
               dict = env.ParseFlags('-O2', '-Dfoo', '-Dbar=1')
               dict = env.ParseFlags(['-O2', '-Dfoo -Dbar=1'])
               dict = env.ParseFlags('-O2', '!echo -Dfoo -Dbar=1')

       <b>Platform</b>(<u>plat</u>), <u>env</u>.Platform(<u>plat</u>)
           When called as a global function, returns a callable platform object selected by <u>plat</u> (defaults to
           the detected platform for the current system) that can be used to initialize a construction
           environment by passing it as the <u>platform</u> keyword argument to the <b>Environment</b> function.

           Example:

               env = Environment(platform=Platform('win32'))

           When called as a method of an environment, calls the platform object indicated by <u>plat</u> to update that
           environment.

               env.Platform('posix')

           See the manpage section "Construction Environments" for more details.

       <b>Precious</b>(<u>target,</u> <u>...</u>), <u>env</u>.Precious(<u>target,</u> <u>...</u>)
           Marks each given <u>target</u> as precious so it is not deleted before it is rebuilt. Normally <b>scons</b> deletes
           a target before building it. Multiple targets can be passed in to a single call to <b>Precious</b>.

       <u>env</u>.Prepend(<u>key=val,</u> <u>[...]</u>)
           Prepend values to construction variables in the current construction environment, Works like
           <b>env.Append</b> (see for details), except that values are added to the front, rather than the end, of any
           existing value of the construction variable

           Example:

               env.Prepend(CCFLAGS='-g ', FOO=['foo.yyy'])

           See also <b>env.Append</b>, <b>env.AppendUnique</b> and <b>env.PrependUnique</b>.

       <u>env</u>.PrependENVPath(<u>name,</u> <u>newpath,</u> <u>[envname,</u> <u>sep,</u> <u>delete_existing=True]</u>)
           Prepend path elements specified by <u>newpath</u> to the given search path string or list <u>name</u> in mapping
           <u>envname</u> in the construction environment. Supplying <u>envname</u> is optional: the default is the execution
           environment <b>$ENV</b>. Optional <u>sep</u> is used as the search path separator, the default is the platform's
           separator (os.pathsep). A path element will only appear once. Any duplicates in <u>newpath</u> are dropped,
           keeping the first appearing (to preserve path order). If <u>delete_existing</u> is <b>False</b> any addition
           duplicating an existing path element is ignored; if <u>delete_existing</u> is <b>True</b> (the default) the
           existing value will be dropped and the path element will be inserted at the beginning. To help
           maintain uniqueness all paths are normalized (using os.path.normpath and os.path.normcase).

           Example:

               print('before:', env['ENV']['INCLUDE'])
               include_path = '/foo/bar:/foo'
               env.PrependENVPath('INCLUDE', include_path)
               print('after:', env['ENV']['INCLUDE'])

           Yields:

               before: /biz:/foo
               after: /foo/bar:/foo:/biz

           See also <b>env.AppendENVPath</b>.

       <u>env</u>.PrependUnique(<u>key=val,</u> <u>[...],</u> <u>[delete_existing=False]</u>)
           Prepend values to construction variables in the current construction environment, maintaining
           uniqueness. Works like <b>env.Append</b>, except that values are added to the front, rather than the end, of
           the construction variable, and values that would become duplicates are not added. If <u>delete_existing</u>
           is set to a true value, then for any duplicate, the existing instance of <u>val</u> is first removed, then
           <u>val</u> is inserted, having the effect of moving it to the front.

           Example:

               env.PrependUnique(CCFLAGS='-g', FOO=['foo.yyy'])

           See also <b>env.Append</b>, <b>env.AppendUnique</b> and <b>env.Prepend</b>.

       <b>Progress</b>(<u>callable,</u> <u>[interval]</u>), <b>Progress</b>(<u>string,</u> <u>[interval,</u> <u>file,</u> <u>overwrite]</u>), <b>Progress</b>(<u>list_of_strings,</u>
       <u>[interval,</u> <u>file,</u> <u>overwrite]</u>)
           Allows SCons to show progress made during the build by displaying a string or calling a function
           while evaluating Nodes (e.g. files).

           If the first specified argument is a Python callable (a function or an object that has a __call__
           method), the function will be called once every <u>interval</u> times a Node is evaluated (default <b>1</b>). The
           callable will be passed the evaluated Node as its only argument. (For future compatibility, it's a
           good idea to also add <u>*args</u> and <u>**kwargs</u> as arguments to your function or method signatures. This
           will prevent the code from breaking if SCons ever changes the interface to call the function with
           additional arguments in the future.)

           An example of a simple custom progress function that prints a string containing the Node name every
           10 Nodes:

               def my_progress_function(node, *args, **kwargs):
                   print('Evaluating node %s!' % node)
               Progress(my_progress_function, interval=10)

           A more complicated example of a custom progress display object that prints a string containing a
           count every 100 evaluated Nodes. Note the use of \r (a carriage return) at the end so that the string
           will overwrite itself on a display:

               import sys
               class ProgressCounter(object):
                   count = 0
                   def __call__(self, node, *args, **kw):
                       self.count += 100
                       sys.stderr.write('Evaluated %s nodes\r' % self.count)

               Progress(ProgressCounter(), interval=100)

           If the first argument to <b>Progress</b> is a string or list of strings, it is taken as text to be displayed
           every <u>interval</u> evaluated Nodes. If the first argument is a list of strings, then each string in the
           list will be displayed in rotating fashion every <u>interval</u> evaluated Nodes.

           The default is to print the string on standard output. An alternate output stream may be specified
           with the <u>file</u> keyword argument, which the caller must pass already opened.

           The following will print a series of dots on the error output, one dot for every 100 evaluated Nodes:

               import sys
               Progress('.', interval=100, file=sys.stderr)

           If the string contains the verbatim substring $TARGET;, it will be replaced with the Node. Note that,
           for performance reasons, this is <u>not</u> a regular SCons variable substition, so you can not use other
           variables or use curly braces. The following example will print the name of every evaluated Node,
           using a carriage return) (\r) to cause each line to overwritten by the next line, and the <u>overwrite</u>
           keyword argument (default False) to make sure the previously-printed file name is overwritten with
           blank spaces:

               import sys
               Progress('$TARGET\r', overwrite=True)

           A list of strings can be used to implement a "spinner" on the user's screen as follows, changing
           every five evaluated Nodes:

               Progress(['-\r', '\\\r', '|\r', '/\r'], interval=5)

       <b>Pseudo</b>(<u>target,</u> <u>...</u>), <u>env</u>.Pseudo(<u>target,</u> <u>...</u>)
           This indicates that each given <u>target</u> should not be created by the build rule, and if the target is
           created, an error will be generated. This is similar to the gnu make .PHONY target. However, in the
           vast majority of cases, an <b>Alias</b> is more appropriate. Multiple targets can be passed in to a single
           call to <b>Pseudo</b>.

       <b>PyPackageDir</b>(<u>modulename</u>), <u>env</u>.PyPackageDir(<u>modulename</u>)
           This returns a Directory Node similar to Dir. The python module / package is looked up and if located
           the directory is returned for the location.  <u>modulename</u> Is a named python package / module to lookup
           the directory for it's location.

           If <u>modulename</u> is a list, SCons returns a list of Dir nodes. Construction variables are expanded in
           <u>modulename</u>.

       <u>env</u>.Replace(<u>key=val,</u> <u>[...]</u>)
           Replaces construction variables in the Environment with the specified keyword arguments.

           Example:

               env.Replace(CCFLAGS='-g', FOO='foo.xxx')

       <b>Repository</b>(<u>directory</u>), <u>env</u>.Repository(<u>directory</u>)
           Specifies that <u>directory</u> is a repository to be searched for files. Multiple calls to <b>Repository</b> are
           legal, and each one adds to the list of repositories that will be searched.

           To <b>scons</b>, a repository is a copy of the source tree, from the top-level directory on down, which may
           contain both source files and derived files that can be used to build targets in the local source
           tree. The canonical example would be an official source tree maintained by an integrator. If the
           repository contains derived files, then the derived files should have been built using <b>scons</b>, so that
           the repository contains the necessary signature information to allow <b>scons</b> to figure out when it is
           appropriate to use the repository copy of a derived file, instead of building one locally.

           Note that if an up-to-date derived file already exists in a repository, <b>scons</b> will <u>not</u> make a copy in
           the local directory tree. In order to guarantee that a local copy will be made, use the <b>Local</b> method.

       <b>Requires</b>(<u>target,</u> <u>prerequisite</u>), <u>env</u>.Requires(<u>target,</u> <u>prerequisite</u>)
           Specifies an order-only relationship between the specified target file(s) and the specified
           prerequisite file(s). The prerequisite file(s) will be (re)built, if necessary, <u>before</u> the target
           file(s), but the target file(s) do not actually depend on the prerequisites and will not be rebuilt
           simply because the prerequisite file(s) change.

           Example:

               env.Requires('foo', 'file-that-must-be-built-before-foo')

       <b>Return</b>(<u>[vars...,</u> <u>stop=True]</u>)
           Return to the calling SConscript, optionally returning the values of variables named in <u>vars</u>.
           Multiple strings contaning variable names may be passed to <b>Return</b>. A string containing white space is
           split into individual variable names. Returns the value if one variable is specified, else returns a
           tuple of values. Returns an empty tuple if <u>vars</u> is omitted.

           By default <b>Return</b> stops processing the current SConscript and returns immediately. The optional stop
           keyword argument may be set to a false value to continue processing the rest of the SConscript file
           after the <b>Return</b> call (this was the default behavior prior to SCons 0.98.) However, the values
           returned are still the values of the variables in the named <u>vars</u> at the point <b>Return</b> was called.

           Examples:

               # Returns no values (evaluates False)
               Return()

               # Returns the value of the 'foo' Python variable.
               Return("foo")

               # Returns the values of the Python variables 'foo' and 'bar'.
               Return("foo", "bar")

               # Returns the values of Python variables 'val1' and 'val2'.
               Return('val1 val2')

       <b>Scanner</b>(<u>function,</u> <u>[name,</u> <u>argument,</u> <u>skeys,</u> <u>path_function,</u> <u>node_class,</u> <u>node_factory,</u> <u>scan_check,</u>
       <u>recursive]</u>), <u>env</u>.Scanner(<u>function,</u> <u>[name,</u> <u>argument,</u> <u>skeys,</u> <u>path_function,</u> <u>node_class,</u> <u>node_factory,</u>
       <u>scan_check,</u> <u>recursive]</u>)
           Creates a Scanner object for the specified <u>function</u>. See manpage section "Scanner Objects" for a
           complete explanation of the arguments and behavior.

       <b>SConscript</b>(<u>scripts,</u> <u>[exports,</u> <u>variant_dir,</u> <u>duplicate,</u> <u>must_exist]</u>), <u>env</u>.SConscript(<u>scripts,</u> <u>[exports,</u>
       <u>variant_dir,</u> <u>duplicate,</u> <u>must_exist]</u>), <b>SConscript</b>(<u>dirs=subdirs,</u> <u>[name=scriptname,</u> <u>exports,</u> <u>variant_dir,</u>
       <u>duplicate,</u> <u>must_exist]</u>), <u>env</u>.SConscript(<u>dirs=subdirs,</u> <u>[name=scriptname,</u> <u>exports,</u> <u>variant_dir,</u> <u>duplicate,</u>
       <u>must_exist]</u>)
           Executes one or more subsidiary SConscript (configuration) files. There are two ways to call the
           <b>SConscript</b> function.

           The first calling style is to supply one or more SConscript file names as the first (positional)
           argument. A single script may be specified as a string; multiple scripts must be specified as a list
           of strings (either explicitly or as created by a function like <b>Split</b>). Examples:

               SConscript('SConscript')  # run SConscript in the current directory
               SConscript('src/SConscript')  # run SConscript in the src directory
               SConscript(['src/SConscript', 'doc/SConscript'])
               config = SConscript('MyConfig.py')

           The other calling style is to omit the positional argument naming scripts and instead specify a list
           of directory names using the <u>dirs</u> keyword argument. In this case, <b>scons</b> will execute a subsidiary
           configuration file named SConscript in each of the specified directories. You may specify a name
           other than SConscript by supplying an optional <u>name</u>=<u>scriptname</u> keyword argument. The first three
           examples below have the same effect as the first three examples above:

               SConscript(dirs='.')  # run SConscript in the current directory
               SConscript(dirs='src')  # run SConscript in the src directory
               SConscript(dirs=['src', 'doc'])
               SConscript(dirs=['sub1', 'sub2'], name='MySConscript')

           The optional <u>exports</u> keyword argument provides a string or list of strings representing variable
           names, or a dictionary of named values, to export. For the first calling style only, a second
           positional argument will be interpreted as <u>exports</u>; the second calling style must use the keyword
           argument form for <u>exports</u>. These variables are locally exported only to the called SConscript file(s)
           and do not affect the global pool of variables managed by the <b>Export</b> function.  The subsidiary
           SConscript files must use the <b>Import</b> function to import the variables. Examples:

               foo = SConscript('sub/SConscript', exports='env')
               SConscript('dir/SConscript', exports=['env', 'variable'])
               SConscript(dirs='subdir', exports='env variable')
               SConscript(dirs=['one', 'two', 'three'], exports='shared_info')

           If the optional <u>variant_dir</u> argument is present, it causes an effect equivalent to the <b>VariantDir</b>
           function, but in effect only within the scope of the <b>SConscript</b> call. The <u>variant_dir</u> argument is
           interpreted relative to the directory of the <u>calling</u> SConscript file. The source directory is the
           directory in which the <u>called</u> SConscript file resides and the SConscript file is evaluated as if it
           were in the <u>variant_dir</u> directory. Thus:

               SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build')

           is equivalent to:

               VariantDir('build', 'src')
               SConscript('build/SConscript')

           If the sources are in the same directory as the SConstruct,

               SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='build')

           is equivalent to:

               VariantDir('build', '.')
               SConscript('build/SConscript')

           The optional <u>duplicate</u> argument is interpreted as for <b>VariantDir</b>. If the <u>variant_dir</u> argument is
           omitted, the <u>duplicate</u> argument is ignored. See the description of <b>VariantDir</b> for additional details
           and restrictions.

           If the optional <u>must_exist</u> is <b>True</b>, causes an exception to be raised if a requested SConscript file
           is not found. The current default is <b>False</b>, causing only a warning to be emitted, but this default is
           deprecated (<u>since</u> <u>3.1</u>). For scripts which truly intend to be optional, transition to explicitly
           supplying must_exist=False to the <b>SConscript</b> call.

           Here are some composite examples:

               # collect the configuration information and use it to build src and doc
               shared_info = SConscript('MyConfig.py')
               SConscript('src/SConscript', exports='shared_info')
               SConscript('doc/SConscript', exports='shared_info')

               # build debugging and production versions.  SConscript
               # can use Dir('.').path to determine variant.
               SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='debug', duplicate=0)
               SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='prod', duplicate=0)

               # build debugging and production versions.  SConscript
               # is passed flags to use.
               opts = { 'CPPDEFINES' : ['DEBUG'], 'CCFLAGS' : '-pgdb' }
               SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='debug', duplicate=0, exports=opts)
               opts = { 'CPPDEFINES' : ['NODEBUG'], 'CCFLAGS' : '-O' }
               SConscript('SConscript', variant_dir='prod', duplicate=0, exports=opts)

               # build common documentation and compile for different architectures
               SConscript('doc/SConscript', variant_dir='build/doc', duplicate=0)
               SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build/x86', duplicate=0)
               SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='build/ppc', duplicate=0)

           <b>SConscript</b> returns the values of any variables named by the executed SConscript file(s) in arguments
           to the <b>Return</b> function. If a single <b>SConscript</b> call causes multiple scripts to be executed, the
           return value is a tuple containing the returns of each of the scripts. If an executed script does not
           explicitly call <b>Return</b>, it returns <b>None</b>.

       <b>SConscriptChdir</b>(<u>value</u>)
           By default, <b>scons</b> changes its working directory to the directory in which each subsidiary SConscript
           file lives while reading and processing that script. This behavior may be disabled by specifying an
           argument which evaluates false, in which case <b>scons</b> will stay in the top-level directory while
           reading all SConscript files. (This may be necessary when building from repositories, when all the
           directories in which SConscript files may be found don't necessarily exist locally.) You may enable
           and disable this ability by calling <b>SConscriptChdir</b> multiple times.

           Example:

               SConscriptChdir(False)
               SConscript('foo/SConscript')  # will not chdir to foo
               SConscriptChdir(True)
               SConscript('bar/SConscript')  # will chdir to bar

       <b>SConsignFile</b>(<u>[name,</u> <u>dbm_module]</u>), <u>env</u>.SConsignFile(<u>[name,</u> <u>dbm_module]</u>)
           Specify where to store the SCons file signature database, and which database format to use. This may
           be useful to specify alternate database files and/or file locations for different types of builds.

           The optional <u>name</u> argument is the base name of the database file(s). If not an absolute path name,
           these are placed relative to the directory containing the top-level SConstruct file. The default is
           .sconsign. The actual database file(s) stored on disk may have an appropriate suffix appended by the
           chosen <u>dbm_module</u>

           The optional <u>dbm_module</u> argument specifies which Python database module to use for reading/writing
           the file. The module must be imported first; then the imported module name is passed as the argument.
           The default is a custom SCons.dblite module that uses pickled Python data structures, which works on
           all Python versions. See documentation of the Python dbm module for other available types.

           If called with no arguments, the database will default to .sconsign.dblite in the top directory of
           the project, which is also the default if if <b>SConsignFile</b> is not called.

           The setting is global, so the only difference between the global function and the environment method
           form is variable expansion on <u>name</u>. There should only be one active call to this function/method in a
           given build setup.

           If <u>name</u> is set to <b>None</b>, <b>scons</b> will store file signatures in a separate .sconsign file in each
           directory, not in a single combined database file. This is a backwards-compatibility meaure to
           support what was the default behavior prior to SCons 0.97 (i.e. before 2008). Use of this mode is
           discouraged and may be deprecated in a future SCons release.

           Examples:

               # Explicitly stores signatures in ".sconsign.dblite"
               # in the top-level SConstruct directory (the default behavior).
               SConsignFile()

               # Stores signatures in the file "etc/scons-signatures"
               # relative to the top-level SConstruct directory.
               # SCons will add a database suffix to this name.
               SConsignFile("etc/scons-signatures")

               # Stores signatures in the specified absolute file name.
               # SCons will add a database suffix to this name.
               SConsignFile("/home/me/SCons/signatures")

               # Stores signatures in a separate .sconsign file
               # in each directory.
               SConsignFile(None)

               # Stores signatures in a GNU dbm format .sconsign file
               import dbm.gnu
               SConsignFile(dbm_module=dbm.gnu)

       <u>env</u>.SetDefault(<u>key=val,</u> <u>[...]</u>)
           Sets construction variables to default values specified with the keyword arguments if (and only if)
           the variables are not already set. The following statements are equivalent:

               env.SetDefault(FOO='foo')
               if 'FOO' not in env:
                   env['FOO'] = 'foo'

       <b>SetOption</b>(<u>name,</u> <u>value</u>), <u>env</u>.SetOption(<u>name,</u> <u>value</u>)
           Sets <b>scons</b> option variable <u>name</u> to <u>value</u>. These options are all also settable via command-line
           options but the variable name may differ from the command-line option name - see the table for
           correspondences. A value set via command-line option will take precedence over one set with
           <b>SetOption</b>, which allows setting a project default in the scripts and temporarily overriding it via
           command line.  <b>SetOption</b> calls can also be placed in the site_init.py file.

           See the documentation in the manpage for the corresponding command line option for information about
           each specific option. The <u>value</u> parameter is mandatory, for option values which are boolean in nature
           (that is, the command line option does not take an argument) use a <u>value</u> which evaluates to true
           (e.g.  <b>True</b>, <b>1</b>) or false (e.g.  <b>False</b>, <b>0</b>).

           Options which affect the reading and processing of SConscript files are not settable using <b>SetOption</b>
           since those files must be read in order to find the <b>SetOption</b> call in the first place.

           The settable variables with their associated command-line options are:

       <b>SideEffect</b>(<u>side_effect,</u> <u>target</u>), <u>env</u>.SideEffect(<u>side_effect,</u> <u>target</u>)
           Declares <u>side_effect</u> as a side effect of building <u>target</u>. Both <u>side_effect</u> and <u>target</u> can be a list,
           a file name, or a node. A side effect is a target file that is created or updated as a side effect of
           building other targets. For example, a Windows PDB file is created as a side effect of building the
           .obj files for a static library, and various log files are created updated as side effects of various
           TeX commands. If a target is a side effect of multiple build commands, <b>scons</b> will ensure that only
           one set of commands is executed at a time. Consequently, you only need to use this method for
           side-effect targets that are built as a result of multiple build commands.

           Because multiple build commands may update the same side effect file, by default the <u>side_effect</u>
           target is <u>not</u> automatically removed when the <u>target</u> is removed by the <b>-c</b> option. (Note, however, that
           the <u>side_effect</u> might be removed as part of cleaning the directory in which it lives.) If you want to
           make sure the <u>side_effect</u> is cleaned whenever a specific <u>target</u> is cleaned, you must specify this
           explicitly with the <b>Clean</b> or <b>env.Clean</b> function.

           This function returns the list of side effect Node objects that were successfully added. If the list
           of side effects contained any side effects that had already been added, they are not added and
           included in the returned list.

       <b>Split</b>(<u>arg</u>), <u>env</u>.Split(<u>arg</u>)
           If <u>arg</u> is a string, splits on whitespace and returns a list of strings without whitespace. This mode
           is the most common case, and can be used to split a list of filenames (for example) rather than
           having to type them as a list of individually quoted words. If <u>arg</u> is a list or tuple returns the
           list or tuple unchanged. If <u>arg</u> is any other type of object, returns a list containing just the
           object. These non-string cases do not actually do any spliting, but allow an argument variable to be
           passed to <b>Split</b> without having to first check its type.

           Example:

               files = Split("f1.c f2.c f3.c")
               files = env.Split("f4.c f5.c f6.c")
               files = Split("""
                   f7.c
                   f8.c
                   f9.c
               """)

       <u>env</u>.subst(<u>input,</u> <u>[raw,</u> <u>target,</u> <u>source,</u> <u>conv]</u>)
           Performs construction variable interpolation (substitution) on <u>input</u>, which can be a string or a
           sequence. Substitutable elements take the form ${<u>expression</u>}, although if there is no ambiguity in
           recognizing the element, the braces can be omitted. A literal <b>$</b> can be entered by using <b>$$</b>.

           By default, leading or trailing white space will be removed from the result, and all sequences of
           white space will be compressed to a single space character. Additionally, any $( and $) character
           sequences will be stripped from the returned string, The optional <u>raw</u> argument may be set to 1 if you
           want to preserve white space and $(-$) sequences. The <u>raw</u> argument may be set to 2 if you want to
           additionally discard all characters between any $( and $) pairs (as is done for signature
           calculation).

           If <u>input</u> is a sequence (list or tuple), the individual elements of the sequence will be expanded, and
           the results will be returned as a list.

           The optional <u>target</u> and <u>source</u> keyword arguments must be set to lists of target and source nodes,
           respectively, if you want the <b>$TARGET</b>, <b>$TARGETS</b>, <b>$SOURCE</b> and <b>$SOURCES</b> to be available for expansion.
           This is usually necessary if you are calling <b>env.subst</b> from within a Python function used as an SCons
           action.

           Returned string values or sequence elements are converted to their string representation by default.
           The optional <u>conv</u> argument may specify a conversion function that will be used in place of the
           default. For example, if you want Python objects (including SCons Nodes) to be returned as Python
           objects, you can use a Python lambda expression to pass in an unnamed function that simply returns
           its unconverted argument.

           Example:

               print(env.subst("The C compiler is: $CC"))

               def compile(target, source, env):
                   sourceDir = env.subst(
                       "${SOURCE.srcdir}",
                       target=target,
                       source=source
                   )

               source_nodes = env.subst('$EXPAND_TO_NODELIST', conv=lambda x: x)

       <b>Tag</b>(<u>node,</u> <u>tags</u>)
           Annotates file or directory Nodes with information about how the <b>Package</b> Builder should package those
           files or directories. All Node-level tags are optional.

           Examples:

               # makes sure the built library will be installed with 644 file access mode
               Tag(Library('lib.c'), UNIX_ATTR="0o644")

               # marks file2.txt to be a documentation file
               Tag('file2.txt', DOC)

       <b>Tool</b>(<u>name,</u> <u>[toolpath,</u> <u>**kwargs]</u>), <u>env</u>.Tool(<u>name,</u> <u>[toolpath,</u> <u>**kwargs]</u>)
           Locates the tool specification module <u>name</u> and returns a callable tool object for that tool. The tool
           module is searched for in standard locations and in any paths specified by the optional <u>toolpath</u>
           parameter. The standard locations are SCons' own internal path for tools plus the toolpath, if any
           (see the <b>Tools</b> section in the manual page for more details). Any additional keyword arguments <u>kwargs</u>
           are passed to the tool module's <b>generate</b> function during tool object construction.

           When called, the tool object updates a construction environment with construction variables and
           arranges any other initialization needed to use the mechanisms that tool describes.

           When the <b>env.Tool</b> form is used, the tool object is automatically called to update <u>env</u> and the value
           of <u>tool</u> is appended to the <b>$TOOLS</b> construction variable in that environment.

           <u>Changed</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.2:</u> <b>env.Tool</b> now returns the tool object, previously it did not return (i.e.
           returned <b>None</b>).

           Examples:

               env.Tool('gcc')
               env.Tool('opengl', toolpath=['build/tools'])

           When the global function <b>Tool</b> form is used, the tool object is constructed but not called, as it
           lacks the context of an environment to update. The tool object can be passed to an <b>Environment</b> or
           <b>Clone</b> call as part of the <u>tools</u> keyword argument, in which case the tool is applied to the
           environment being constructed, or it can be called directly, in which case a construction environment
           to update must be passed as the argument. Either approach will also update the <b>$TOOLS</b> construction
           variable.

           Examples:

               env = Environment(tools=[Tool('msvc')])

               env = Environment()
               msvctool = Tool('msvc')
               msvctool(env)  # adds 'msvc' to the TOOLS variable
               gltool = Tool('opengl', toolpath = ['tools'])
               gltool(env)  # adds 'opengl' to the TOOLS variable

       <b>ValidateOptions</b>(<u>[throw_exception=False]</u>)
           Check that all the options specified on the command line are either defined by SCons itself or
           defined by calls to <b>AddOption</b>.

           This function should only be called after the last <b>AddOption</b> call in your SConscript logic.

           Be aware that some tools call <b>AddOption</b>, if you are getting error messages for arguments that they
           add, you will need to ensure that you load those tools before you call <b>ValidateOptions</b>.

           If there are any command line options not defined, calling this function will cause SCons to issue an
           error message and then exit with an error exit status.

           If the optional <u>throw_exception</u> is True, <b>ValidateOptions</b> will raise a SConsBadOptionError exception.
           This would allow the calling SConscript logic can catch that exception and handle invalid options
           itself.

           Example:

               try:
                   ValidateOptions(throw_exception=True)
               except SConsBadOptionError as e:
                   print("Parser is SConsOptionParser:%s" % (isinstance(e.parser, SConsOptionParser)))
                   print("Message is :%s" % e.opt_str)
                   <a href="../man3/Exit.3.html">Exit</a>(3)

           This function is useful to force SCons to fail fast before you execute any expensive logic later in
           your build logic. For example if you specify build options via any flags, a simple typo could yield
           the incorrect build option throughout your entire build.

               scons --compilers=mingw (the correct flag is --compiler)

           Could cause SCons to run configure steps with the incorrect compiler. Costing developer time trying
           to track down why the configure logic failed with a compiler which should work.

           <u>New</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.5.0</u>

       <b>Value</b>(<u>value,</u> <u>[built_value],</u> <u>[name]</u>), <u>env</u>.Value(<u>value,</u> <u>[built_value],</u> <u>[name]</u>)
           Returns a Node object representing the specified Python value. Value Nodes can be used as
           dependencies of targets. If the result of calling <b>str</b>(<u>value</u>) changes between SCons runs, any targets
           depending on <b>Value</b>(<u>value</u>) will be rebuilt. (This is true even when using timestamps to decide if
           files are up-to-date.) When using timestamp source signatures, Value Nodes' timestamps are equal to
           the system time when the Node is created.

           The returned Value Node object has a <b>write</b>() method that can be used to "build" a Value Node by
           setting a new value. The optional <u>built_value</u> argument can be specified when the Value Node is
           created to indicate the Node should already be considered "built." There is a corresponding <b>read</b>()
           method that will return the built value of the Node.

           The optional <u>name</u> parameter can be provided as an alternative name for the resulting Value node; this
           is advised if the <u>value</u> parameter cannot be converted to a string.

           <u>Changed</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.0:</u> the <u>name</u> parameter was added.

           Examples:

               env = Environment()

               def create(target, source, env):
                   # A function that will write a 'prefix=$SOURCE'
                   # string into the file name specified as the
                   # $TARGET.
                   with open(str(target[0]), 'wb') as f:
                       f.write('prefix=' + source[0].get_contents())

               # Fetch the prefix= argument, if any, from the command
               # line, and use <a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a> as the default.
               prefix = ARGUMENTS.get('prefix', '<a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>')

               # Attach a .Config() builder for the above function action
               # to the construction environment.
               env['BUILDERS']['Config'] = Builder(action=create)
               env.Config(target='package-config', source=Value(prefix))

               def build_value(target, source, env):
                   # A function that "builds" a Python Value by updating
                   # the Python value with the contents of the file
                   # specified as the source of the Builder call ($SOURCE).
                   target[0].write(source[0].get_contents())

               output = env.Value('before')
               input = env.Value('after')

               # Attach a .UpdateValue() builder for the above function
               # action to the construction environment.
               env['BUILDERS']['UpdateValue'] = Builder(action=build_value)
               env.UpdateValue(target=Value(output), source=Value(input))

       <b>VariantDir</b>(<u>variant_dir,</u> <u>src_dir,</u> <u>[duplicate]</u>), <u>env</u>.VariantDir(<u>variant_dir,</u> <u>src_dir,</u> <u>[duplicate]</u>)
           Sets up a mapping to define a variant build directory in <u>variant_dir</u>.  <u>src_dir</u> may not be underneath
           <u>variant_dir</u>. A <b>VariantDir</b> mapping is global, even if called using the <b>env.VariantDir</b> form.
           <b>VariantDir</b> can be called multiple times with the same <u>src_dir</u> to set up multiple variant builds with
           different options.

           Note if <u>variant_dir</u> is not under the project top directory, target selection rules will not pick
           targets in the variant directory unless they are explicitly specified.

           When files in <u>variant_dir</u> are referenced, SCons backfills as needed with files from <u>src_dir</u> to create
           a complete build directory. By default, SCons physically duplicates the source files, SConscript
           files, and directory structure as needed into the variant directory. Thus, a build performed in the
           variant directory is guaranteed to be identical to a build performed in the source directory even if
           intermediate source files are generated during the build, or if preprocessors or other scanners
           search for included files using paths relative to the source file, or if individual compilers or
           other invoked tools are hard-coded to put derived files in the same directory as source files. Only
           the files SCons calculates are needed for the build are duplicated into <u>variant_dir</u>. If possible on
           the platform, the duplication is performed by linking rather than copying. This behavior is affected
           by the <b>--duplicate</b> command-line option.

           Duplicating the source files may be disabled by setting the <u>duplicate</u> argument to <b>False</b>. This will
           cause SCons to invoke Builders using the path names of source files in <u>src_dir</u> and the path names of
           derived files within <u>variant_dir</u>. This is more efficient than duplicating, and is safe for most
           builds; revert to duplicate=True if it causes problems.

           <b>VariantDir</b> works most naturally when used with a subsidiary SConscript file. The subsidiary
           SConscript file must be called as if it were in <u>variant_dir</u>, regardless of the value of <u>duplicate</u>.
           When calling an SConscript file, you can use the <u>exports</u> keyword argument to pass parameters
           (individually or as an appropriately set up environment) so the SConscript can pick up the right
           settings for that variant build. The SConscript must <b>Import</b> these to use them. Example:

               env1 = Environment(...settings for variant1...)
               env2 = Environment(...settings for variant2...)

               # run src/SConscript in two variant directories
               VariantDir('build/variant1', 'src')
               SConscript('build/variant1/SConscript', exports={"env": env1})
               VariantDir('build/variant2', 'src')
               SConscript('build/variant2/SConscript', exports={"env": env2})

           See also the <b>SConscript</b> function for another way to specify a variant directory in conjunction with
           calling a subsidiary SConscript file.

           More examples:

               # use names in the build directory, not the source directory
               VariantDir('build', 'src', duplicate=0)
               Program('build/prog', 'build/source.c')

               # this builds both the source and docs in a separate subtree
               VariantDir('build', '.', duplicate=0)
               SConscript(dirs=['build/src','build/doc'])

               # same as previous example, but only uses SConscript
               SConscript(dirs='src', variant_dir='build/src', duplicate=0)
               SConscript(dirs='doc', variant_dir='build/doc', duplicate=0)

       <b>WhereIs</b>(<u>program,</u> <u>[path,</u> <u>pathext,</u> <u>reject]</u>), <u>env</u>.WhereIs(<u>program,</u> <u>[path,</u> <u>pathext,</u> <u>reject]</u>)
           Searches for the specified executable <u>program</u>, returning the full path to the program or <b>None</b>.

           When called as a construction environment method, searches the paths in the <u>path</u> keyword argument, or
           if <b>None</b> (the default) the paths listed in the construction environment (<u>env</u>['ENV']['PATH']). The
           external environment's path list (os.environ['PATH']) is used as a fallback if the key
           <u>env</u>['ENV']['PATH'] does not exist.

           On Windows systems, searches for executable programs with any of the file extensions listed in the
           <u>pathext</u> keyword argument, or if <b>None</b> (the default) the pathname extensions listed in the construction
           environment (<u>env</u>['ENV']['PATHEXT']). The external environment's pathname extensions list
           (os.environ['PATHEXT']) is used as a fallback if the key <u>env</u>['ENV']['PATHEXT'] does not exist.

           When called as a global function, uses the external environment's path os.environ['PATH'] and path
           extensions os.environ['PATHEXT'], respectively, if <u>path</u> and <u>pathext</u> are <b>None</b>.

           Will not select any path name or names in the optional <u>reject</u> list.

   <b>SConscript</b> <b>Variables</b>
       In addition to the global functions and methods, <b>scons</b> supports a number of variables that can be used in
       SConscript files to affect how you want the build to be performed.

       <u>ARGLIST</u>
           A list of the <u>keyword</u>=<u>value</u> arguments specified on the command line. Each element in the list is a
           tuple containing the argument. The separate <u>keyword</u> and <u>value</u> elements of the tuple can be accessed
           by subscripting for elements <b>[0]</b> and <b>[1]</b> of the tuple, or, more readably, by using tuple unpacking.
           Example:

               print("first keyword, value =", ARGLIST[0][0], ARGLIST[0][1])
               print("second keyword, value =", ARGLIST[1][0], ARGLIST[1][1])
               key, value = ARGLIST[2]
               print("third keyword, value =", key, value)
               for key, value in ARGLIST:
                   # process key and value

       <u>ARGUMENTS</u>
           A dictionary of all the <u>keyword</u>=<u>value</u> arguments specified on the command line. The dictionary is not
           in order, and if a given keyword has more than one value assigned to it on the command line, the last
           (right-most) value is the one in the <u>ARGUMENTS</u> dictionary.

           Example:

               if ARGUMENTS.get('debug', 0):
                   env = Environment(CCFLAGS='-g')
               else:
                   env = Environment()

       <u>BUILD_TARGETS</u>
           A list of the targets which <b>scons</b> has been asked to build. The contents will be either those targets
           listed on the command line, or, if none, those targets set via calls to the <b>Default</b> function. It does
           <u>not</u> contain any dependent targets that <b>scons</b> selects for building as a result of making the sure the
           specified targets are up to date, if those targets did not appear on the command line. The list is
           empty if neither command line targets or <b>Default</b> calls are present.

           The elements of this list may be strings <u>or</u> nodes, so you should run the list through the Python <b>str</b>
           function to make sure any Node path names are converted to strings.

           Because this list may be taken from the list of targets specified using the <b>Default</b> function, the
           contents of the list may change on each successive call to <b>Default</b>. See the <u>DEFAULT_TARGETS</u> list,
           below, for additional information.

           Example:

               if 'foo' in BUILD_TARGETS:
                   print("Don't forget to test the `foo' program!")
               if 'special/program' in BUILD_TARGETS:
                   SConscript('special')

       <u>COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS</u>
           A list of the targets explicitly specified on the command line. If there are command line targets,
           this list will have the same contents as <u>BUILD_TARGETS</u>. If there are no targets specified on the
           command line, the list is empty. The elements of this list are strings. This can be used, for
           example, to take specific actions only when certain targets are explicitly being built.

           Example:

               if 'foo' in COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
                   print("Don't forget to test the `foo' program!")
               if 'special/program' in COMMAND_LINE_TARGETS:
                   SConscript('special')

       <u>DEFAULT_TARGETS</u>
           A list of the target <u>nodes</u> that have been specified using the <b>Default</b> function. If there are no
           command line targets, this list will have the same contents as <u>BUILD_TARGETS</u>. Since the elements of
           the list are nodes, you need to call the Python <b>str</b> function on them to get the path name for each
           Node.

           Example:

               print(str(DEFAULT_TARGETS[0]))
               if 'foo' in [str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS]:
                   print("Don't forget to test the `foo' program!")

           The contents of the <u>DEFAULT_TARGETS</u> list change on on each successive call to the <b>Default</b> function:

               print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # originally []
               Default('foo')
               print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # now a node ['foo']
               Default('bar')
               print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # now a node ['foo', 'bar']
               Default(None)
               print([str(t) for t in DEFAULT_TARGETS])   # back to []

           Consequently, be sure to use <u>DEFAULT_TARGETS</u> only after you've made all of your <b>Default</b>() calls, or
           else simply be careful of the order of these statements in your SConscript files so that you don't
           look for a specific default target before it's actually been added to the list.

       These variables may be accessed from custom Python modules that you import into an SConscript file by
       adding the following to the Python module:

           from SCons.Script import *

   <b>Construction</b> <b>Variables</b>
       A construction environment has an associated dictionary of construction variables that are used by
       built-in or user-supplied build rules.  Construction variable naming must follow the same rules as Python
       identifier naming: the initial character must be an underscore or letter, followed by any number of
       underscores, letters, or digits. A construction environment is not a Python dictionary itself, but it can
       be indexed like one to access a construction variable:

           env["CC"] = "cc"
           flags = env.get("CPPDEFINES", [])

       Construction variables can also be retrieved and set by using the <b>Dictionary</b> method of the construction
       environment to create an actual dictionary:

           cvars = env.Dictionary()
           cvars["CC"] = "cc"

       Construction variables can also be passed to the construction environment constructor:

           env = Environment(CC="cc")

       or when copying a construction environment using the <b>Clone</b> method:

           env2 = env.Clone(CC="cl.exe")

       Construction variables can also be supplied as keyword arguments to a builder, in which case those
       settings affect only the work done by that builder call, and not the construction environment as a whole.
       This concept is called an override:

           env.Program('hello', 'hello.c', LIBS=['gl', 'glut'])

       A number of useful construction variables are automatically defined by scons for each supported platform,
       and you can modify these or define any additional construction variables for your own use, taking care
       not to overwrite ones which SCons is using. The following is a list of the possible automatically defined
       construction variables.

       Note the actual list available at execution time will never include all of these, as the ones detected as
       not being useful (wrong platform, necessary external command or files not installed, etc.) will not be
       set up. Correct build setups should be resilient to the possible absence of certain construction
       variables before using them, for example by using a Python dictionary <b>get</b> method to retrieve the value
       and taking alternative action if the return indicates the variable is unset. The <b>env.Dump</b> method can be
       called to examine the construction variables set in a particular environment.

       <b>__LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS</b>
           This construction variable automatically introduces <b>$_LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS</b> if <b>$LDMODULEVERSION</b> is
           set. Othervise it evaluates to an empty string.

       <b>__SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS</b>
           This construction variable automatically introduces <b>$_SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS</b> if <b>$SHLIBVERSION</b> is set.
           Othervise it evaluates to an empty string.

       <b>APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION</b>
           On Mac OS X this is used to set the linker flag: -compatibility_version

           The value is specified as X[.Y[.Z]] where X is between 1 and 65535, Y can be omitted or between 1 and
           255, Z can be omitted or between 1 and 255. This value will be derived from <b>$SHLIBVERSION</b> if not
           specified. The lowest digit will be dropped and replaced by a 0.

           If the <b>$APPLELINK_NO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION</b> is set then no -compatibility_version will be output.

           See MacOS's ld manpage for more details

       <b>_APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION</b>
           A macro (by default a generator function) used to create the linker flags to specify apple's linker's
           -compatibility_version flag. The default generator uses <b>$APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION</b> and
           <b>$APPLELINK_NO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION</b> and <b>$SHLIBVERSION</b> to determine the correct flag.

       <b>APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION</b>
           On Mac OS X this is used to set the linker flag: -current_version

           The value is specified as X[.Y[.Z]] where X is between 1 and 65535, Y can be omitted or between 1 and
           255, Z can be omitted or between 1 and 255. This value will be set to <b>$SHLIBVERSION</b> if not specified.

           If the <b>$APPLELINK_NO_CURRENT_VERSION</b> is set then no -current_version will be output.

           See MacOS's ld manpage for more details

       <b>_APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION</b>
           A macro (by default a generator function) used to create the linker flags to specify apple's linker's
           -current_version flag. The default generator uses <b>$APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION</b> and
           <b>$APPLELINK_NO_CURRENT_VERSION</b> and <b>$SHLIBVERSION</b> to determine the correct flag.

       <b>APPLELINK_NO_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION</b>
           Set this to any True (1|True|non-empty string) value to disable adding -compatibility_version flag
           when generating versioned shared libraries.

           This overrides <b>$APPLELINK_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION</b>.

       <b>APPLELINK_NO_CURRENT_VERSION</b>
           Set this to any True (1|True|non-empty string) value to disable adding -current_version flag when
           generating versioned shared libraries.

           This overrides <b>$APPLELINK_CURRENT_VERSION</b>.

       <b>AR</b>
           The static library archiver.

       <b>ARCHITECTURE</b>
           Specifies the system architecture for which the package is being built. The default is the system
           architecture of the machine on which SCons is running. This is used to fill in the Architecture:
           field in an Ipkg control file, and the BuildArch: field in the RPM .spec file, as well as forming
           part of the name of a generated RPM package file.

           See the <b>Package</b> builder.

       <b>ARCOM</b>
           The command line used to generate a static library from object files.

       <b>ARCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when a static library is generated from object files. If this is not set, then
           <b>$ARCOM</b> (the command line) is displayed.

               env = Environment(ARCOMSTR = "Archiving $TARGET")

       <b>ARFLAGS</b>
           General options passed to the static library archiver.

       <b>AS</b>
           The assembler.

       <b>ASCOM</b>
           The command line used to generate an object file from an assembly-language source file.

       <b>ASCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when an object file is generated from an assembly-language source file. If this
           is not set, then <b>$ASCOM</b> (the command line) is displayed.

               env = Environment(ASCOMSTR = "Assembling $TARGET")

       <b>ASFLAGS</b>
           General options passed to the assembler.

       <b>ASPPCOM</b>
           The command line used to assemble an assembly-language source file into an object file after first
           running the file through the C preprocessor. Any options specified in the <b>$ASFLAGS</b> and <b>$CPPFLAGS</b>
           construction variables are included on this command line.

       <b>ASPPCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when an object file is generated from an assembly-language source file after
           first running the file through the C preprocessor. If this is not set, then <b>$ASPPCOM</b> (the command
           line) is displayed.

               env = Environment(ASPPCOMSTR = "Assembling $TARGET")

       <b>ASPPFLAGS</b>
           General options when an assembling an assembly-language source file into an object file after first
           running the file through the C preprocessor. The default is to use the value of <b>$ASFLAGS</b>.

       <b>BIBTEX</b>
           The bibliography generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter
           and typesetter.

       <b>BIBTEXCOM</b>
           The command line used to call the bibliography generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter and the
           LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

       <b>BIBTEXCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when generating a bibliography for TeX or LaTeX. If this is not set, then
           <b>$BIBTEXCOM</b> (the command line) is displayed.

               env = Environment(BIBTEXCOMSTR = "Generating bibliography $TARGET")

       <b>BIBTEXFLAGS</b>
           General options passed to the bibliography generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter and the
           LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

       <b>BUILDERS</b>
           A dictionary mapping the names of the builders available through the construction environment to
           underlying Builder objects. Custom builders need to be added to this to make them available.

           A platform-dependent default list of builders such as <b>Program</b>, <b>Library</b> etc. is used to populate this
           construction variable when the construction environment is initialized via the presence/absence of
           the tools those builders depend on.  <b>$BUILDERS</b> can be examined to learn which builders will actually
           be available at run-time.

           Note that if you initialize this construction variable through assignment when the construction
           environment is created, that value for <b>$BUILDERS</b> will override any defaults:

               bld = Builder(action='foobuild &lt; $SOURCE &gt; $TARGET')
               env = Environment(BUILDERS={'NewBuilder': bld})

           To instead use a new Builder object in addition to the default Builders, add your new Builder object
           like this:

               env = Environment()
               env.Append(BUILDERS={'NewBuilder': bld})

           or this:

               env = Environment()
               env['BUILDERS']['NewBuilder'] = bld

       <b>CACHEDIR_CLASS</b>
           The class type that SCons should use when instantiating a new <b>CacheDir</b> for the given environment. It
           must be a subclass of the SCons.CacheDir.CacheDir class.

       <b>CC</b>
           The C compiler.

       <b>CCCOM</b>
           The command line used to compile a C source file to a (static) object file. Any options specified in
           the <b>$CFLAGS</b>, <b>$CCFLAGS</b> and <b>$CPPFLAGS</b> construction variables are included on this command line. See
           also <b>$SHCCCOM</b> for compiling to shared objects.

       <b>CCCOMSTR</b>
           If set, the string displayed when a C source file is compiled to a (static) object file. If not set,
           then <b>$CCCOM</b> (the command line) is displayed. See also <b>$SHCCCOMSTR</b> for compiling to shared objects.

               env = Environment(CCCOMSTR = "Compiling static object $TARGET")

       <b>CCDEPFLAGS</b>
           Options to pass to C or C++ compiler to generate list of dependency files.

           This is set only by compilers which support this functionality. (gcc, clang, and msvc currently)

       <b>CCFLAGS</b>
           General options that are passed to the C and C++ compilers. See also <b>$SHCCFLAGS</b> for compiling to
           shared objects.

       <b>CCPCHFLAGS</b>
           Options added to the compiler command line to support building with precompiled headers. The default
           value expands expands to the appropriate Microsoft Visual C++ command-line options when the <b>$PCH</b>
           construction variable is set.

       <b>CCPDBFLAGS</b>
           Options added to the compiler command line to support storing debugging information in a Microsoft
           Visual C++ PDB file. The default value expands expands to appropriate Microsoft Visual C++
           command-line options when the <b>$PDB</b> construction variable is set.

           The Visual C++ compiler option that SCons uses by default to generate PDB information is <b>/Z7</b>. This
           works correctly with parallel (<b>-j</b>) builds because it embeds the debug information in the intermediate
           object files, as opposed to sharing a single PDB file between multiple object files. This is also the
           only way to get debug information embedded into a static library. Using the <b>/Zi</b> instead may yield
           improved link-time performance, although parallel builds will no longer work.

           You can generate PDB files with the <b>/Zi</b> switch by overriding the default <b>$CCPDBFLAGS</b> variable as
           follows:

               env['CCPDBFLAGS'] = ['${(PDB and "/Zi /Fd%s" % File(PDB)) or ""}']

           An alternative would be to use the <b>/Zi</b> to put the debugging information in a separate .pdb file for
           each object file by overriding the <b>$CCPDBFLAGS</b> variable as follows:

               env['CCPDBFLAGS'] = '/Zi /Fd${TARGET}.pdb'

       <b>CCVERSION</b>
           The version number of the C compiler. This may or may not be set, depending on the specific C
           compiler being used.

       <b>CFILESUFFIX</b>
           The suffix for C source files. This is used by the internal CFile builder when generating C files
           from Lex (.l) or YACC (.y) input files. The default suffix, of course, is .c (lower case). On
           case-insensitive systems (like Windows), SCons also treats .C (upper case) files as C files.

       <b>CFLAGS</b>
           General options that are passed to the C compiler (C only; not C++). See also <b>$SHCFLAGS</b> for compiling
           to shared objects.

       <b>CHANGE_SPECFILE</b>
           A hook for modifying the file that controls the packaging build (the .spec for RPM, the control for
           Ipkg, the .wxs for MSI). If set, the function will be called after the SCons template for the file
           has been written.

           See the <b>Package</b> builder.

       <b>CHANGED_SOURCES</b>
           A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a construction environment. (See the manpage
           section "Variable Substitution" for more information).

       <b>CHANGED_TARGETS</b>
           A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a construction environment. (See the manpage
           section "Variable Substitution" for more information).

       <b>CHANGELOG</b>
           The name of a file containing the change log text to be included in the package. This is included as
           the %changelog section of the RPM .spec file.

           See the <b>Package</b> builder.

       <b>COMPILATIONDB_COMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when the <b>CompilationDatabase</b> builder's action is run.

       <b>COMPILATIONDB_PATH_FILTER</b>
           A string which instructs <b>CompilationDatabase</b> to only include entries where the output member matches
           the pattern in the filter string using fnmatch, which uses glob style wildcards.

           The default value is an empty string '', which disables filtering.

       <b>COMPILATIONDB_USE_ABSPATH</b>
           A boolean flag to instruct <b>CompilationDatabase</b> whether to write the file and output members in the
           compilation database using absolute or relative paths.

           The default value is False (use relative paths)

       <b>_concat</b>
           A function used to produce variables like <b>$_CPPINCFLAGS</b>. It takes four mandatory arguments, and up to
           4 additional optional arguments: 1) a prefix to concatenate onto each element, 2) a list of elements,
           3) a suffix to concatenate onto each element, 4) an environment for variable interpolation, 5) an
           optional function that will be called to transform the list before concatenation, 6) an optionally
           specified target (Can use TARGET), 7) an optionally specified source (Can use SOURCE), 8) optional
           <u>affect_signature</u> flag which will wrap non-empty returned value with $( and $) to indicate the
           contents should not affect the signature of the generated command line.

                       env['_CPPINCFLAGS'] = '${_concat(INCPREFIX, CPPPATH, INCSUFFIX, __env__, RDirs, TARGET, SOURCE, affect_signature=False)}'

       <b>CONFIGUREDIR</b>
           The name of the directory in which Configure context test files are written. The default is
           .sconf_temp in the top-level directory containing the SConstruct file.

       <b>CONFIGURELOG</b>
           The name of the <b>Configure</b> context log file. The default is config.log in the top-level directory
           containing the SConstruct file.

       <b>_CPPDEFFLAGS</b>
           An automatically-generated construction variable containing the C preprocessor command-line options
           to define values. The value of <b>$_CPPDEFFLAGS</b> is created by respectively prepending and appending
           <b>$CPPDEFPREFIX</b> and <b>$CPPDEFSUFFIX</b> to each definition in <b>$CPPDEFINES</b>.

       <b>CPPDEFINES</b>
           A platform independent specification of C preprocessor macro definitions. The definitions are added
           to command lines through the automatically-generated <b>$_CPPDEFFLAGS</b> construction variable, which is
           constructed according to the contents of <b>$CPPDEFINES</b>:

           •   If <b>$CPPDEFINES</b> is a string, the values of the <b>$CPPDEFPREFIX</b> and <b>$CPPDEFSUFFIX</b> construction
               variables are respectively prepended and appended to each definition in <b>$CPPDEFINES</b>, split on
               whitespace.

                   # Adds -Dxyz to POSIX compiler command lines,
                   # and /Dxyz to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
                   env = Environment(CPPDEFINES='xyz')

           •   If <b>$CPPDEFINES</b> is a list, the values of the <b>$CPPDEFPREFIX</b> and <b>$CPPDEFSUFFIX</b> construction
               variables are respectively prepended and appended to each element in the list. If any element is
               a tuple (or list) then the first item of the tuple is the macro name and the second is the macro
               definition. If the definition is not omitted or None, the name and definition are combined into a
               single name=definition item before the preending/appending.

                   # Adds -DB=2 -DA to POSIX compiler command lines,
                   # and /DB=2 /DA to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
                   env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=[('B', 2), 'A'])

           •   If <b>$CPPDEFINES</b> is a dictionary, the values of the <b>$CPPDEFPREFIX</b> and <b>$CPPDEFSUFFIX</b> construction
               variables are respectively prepended and appended to each key from the dictionary. If the value
               for a key is not None, then the key (macro name) and the value (macros definition) are combined
               into a single name=definition item before the prepending/appending.

                   # Adds -DA -DB=2 to POSIX compiler command lines,
                   # or /DA /DB=2 to Microsoft Visual C++ command lines.
                   env = Environment(CPPDEFINES={'B':2, 'A':None})

           Depending on how contents are added to <b>$CPPDEFINES</b>, it may be transformed into a compound type, for
           example a list containing strings, tuples and/or dictionaries.  SCons can correctly expand such a
           compound type.

           Note that SCons may call the compiler via a shell. If a macro definition contains characters such as
           spaces that have meaning to the shell, or is intended to be a string value, you may need to use the
           shell's quoting syntax to avoid interpretation by the shell before the preprocessor sees it.
           Function-like macros are not supported via this mechanism (and some compilers do not even implement
           that functionality via the command lines). When quoting, note that one set of quote characters are
           used to define a Python string, then quotes embedded inside that would be consumed by the shell
           unless escaped. These examples may help illustrate:

               env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=['USE_ALT_HEADER=\\"foo_alt.h\\"'])
               env = Environment(CPPDEFINES=[('USE_ALT_HEADER', '\\"foo_alt.h\\"')])

           :<u>Changed</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.5</u>: SCons no longer sorts <b>$CPPDEFINES</b> values entered in dictionary form.  Python
           now preserves dictionary keys in the order they are entered, so it is no longer necessary to sort
           them to ensure a stable command line.

       <b>CPPDEFPREFIX</b>
           The prefix used to specify preprocessor macro definitions on the C compiler command line. This will
           be prepended to each definition in the <b>$CPPDEFINES</b> construction variable when the <b>$_CPPDEFFLAGS</b>
           variable is automatically generated.

       <b>CPPDEFSUFFIX</b>
           The suffix used to specify preprocessor macro definitions on the C compiler command line. This will
           be appended to each definition in the <b>$CPPDEFINES</b> construction variable when the <b>$_CPPDEFFLAGS</b>
           variable is automatically generated.

       <b>CPPFLAGS</b>
           User-specified C preprocessor options. These will be included in any command that uses the C
           preprocessor, including not just compilation of C and C++ source files via the <b>$CCCOM</b>, <b>$SHCCCOM</b>,
           <b>$CXXCOM</b> and <b>$SHCXXCOM</b> command lines, but also the <b>$FORTRANPPCOM</b>, <b>$SHFORTRANPPCOM</b>, <b>$F77PPCOM</b> and
           <b>$SHF77PPCOM</b> command lines used to compile a Fortran source file, and the <b>$ASPPCOM</b> command line used
           to assemble an assembly language source file, after first running each file through the C
           preprocessor. Note that this variable does <u>not</u> contain <b>-I</b> (or similar) include search path options
           that scons generates automatically from <b>$CPPPATH</b>. See <b>$_CPPINCFLAGS</b>, below, for the variable that
           expands to those options.

       <b>_CPPINCFLAGS</b>
           An automatically-generated construction variable containing the C preprocessor command-line options
           for specifying directories to be searched for include files. The value of <b>$_CPPINCFLAGS</b> is created by
           respectively prepending and appending <b>$INCPREFIX</b> and <b>$INCSUFFIX</b> to each directory in <b>$CPPPATH</b>.

       <b>CPPPATH</b>
           The list of directories that the C preprocessor will search for include directories. The C/C++
           implicit dependency scanner will search these directories for include files. In general it's not
           advised to put include directory directives directly into <b>$CCFLAGS</b> or <b>$CXXFLAGS</b> as the result will be
           non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the dependency scanner.  <b>$CPPPATH</b> should be
           a list of path strings, or a single string, not a pathname list joined by Python's os.sep.

           Note: directory names in <b>$CPPPATH</b> will be looked-up relative to the directory of the SConscript file
           when they are used in a command. To force <b>scons</b> to look-up a directory relative to the root of the
           source tree use the # prefix:

               env = Environment(CPPPATH='#/include')

           The directory look-up can also be forced using the <b>Dir</b> function:

               include = Dir('include')
               env = Environment(CPPPATH=include)

           The directory list will be added to command lines through the automatically-generated <b>$_CPPINCFLAGS</b>
           construction variable, which is constructed by respectively prepending and appending the values of
           the <b>$INCPREFIX</b> and <b>$INCSUFFIX</b> construction variables to each directory in <b>$CPPPATH</b>. Any command lines
           you define that need the <b>$CPPPATH</b> directory list should include <b>$_CPPINCFLAGS</b>:

               env = Environment(CCCOM="my_compiler $_CPPINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

       <b>CPPSUFFIXES</b>
           The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for C preprocessor implicit dependencies (#include
           lines). The default list is:

               [".c", ".C", ".cxx", ".cpp", ".c++", ".cc",
                ".h", ".H", ".hxx", ".hpp", ".hh",
                ".F", ".fpp", ".FPP",
                ".m", ".mm",
                ".S", ".spp", ".SPP"]

       <b>CXX</b>
           The C++ compiler. See also <b>$SHCXX</b> for compiling to shared objects..

       <b>CXXCOM</b>
           The command line used to compile a C++ source file to an object file. Any options specified in the
           <b>$CXXFLAGS</b> and <b>$CPPFLAGS</b> construction variables are included on this command line. See also <b>$SHCXXCOM</b>
           for compiling to shared objects..

       <b>CXXCOMSTR</b>
           If set, the string displayed when a C++ source file is compiled to a (static) object file. If not
           set, then <b>$CXXCOM</b> (the command line) is displayed. See also <b>$SHCXXCOMSTR</b> for compiling to shared
           objects..

               env = Environment(CXXCOMSTR = "Compiling static object $TARGET")

       <b>CXXFILESUFFIX</b>
           The suffix for C++ source files. This is used by the internal CXXFile builder when generating C++
           files from Lex (.ll) or YACC (.yy) input files. The default suffix is .cc. SCons also treats files
           with the suffixes .cpp, .cxx, .c++, and .C++ as C++ files, and files with .mm suffixes as Objective
           C++ files. On case-sensitive systems (Linux, UNIX, and other POSIX-alikes), SCons also treats .C
           (upper case) files as C++ files.

       <b>CXXFLAGS</b>
           General options that are passed to the C++ compiler. By default, this includes the value of <b>$CCFLAGS</b>,
           so that setting <b>$CCFLAGS</b> affects both C and C++ compilation. If you want to add C++-specific flags,
           you must set or override the value of <b>$CXXFLAGS</b>. See also <b>$SHCXXFLAGS</b> for compiling to shared
           objects..

       <b>CXXVERSION</b>
           The version number of the C++ compiler. This may or may not be set, depending on the specific C++
           compiler being used.

       <b>DC</b>
           The D compiler to use. See also <b>$SHDC</b> for compiling to shared objects.

       <b>DCOM</b>
           The command line used to compile a D file to an object file. Any options specified in the <b>$DFLAGS</b>
           construction variable is included on this command line. See also <b>$SHDCOM</b> for compiling to shared
           objects.

       <b>DCOMSTR</b>
           If set, the string displayed when a D source file is compiled to a (static) object file. If not set,
           then <b>$DCOM</b> (the command line) is displayed. See also <b>$SHDCOMSTR</b> for compiling to shared objects.

           The TeX DVI file to PDF file converter.

       <b>DVIPDFCOM</b>
           The command line used to convert TeX DVI files into a PDF file.

       <b>DVIPDFCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when a TeX DVI file is converted into a PDF file. If this is not set, then
           <b>$DVIPDFCOM</b> (the command line) is displayed.

       <b>DVIPDFFLAGS</b>
           General options passed to the TeX DVI file to PDF file converter.

       <b>DVIPS</b>
           The TeX DVI file to PostScript converter.

       <b>DVIPSFLAGS</b>
           General options passed to the TeX DVI file to PostScript converter.

       <b>ENV</b>
           The execution environment - a dictionary of environment variables used when SCons invokes external
           commands to build targets defined in this construction environment. When <b>$ENV</b> is passed to a command,
           all list values are assumed to be path lists and are joined using the search path separator. Any
           other non-string values are coerced to a string.

           Note that by default SCons does <u>not</u> propagate the environment in effect when you execute <b>scons</b> (the
           "shell environment") to the execution environment. This is so that builds will be guaranteed
           repeatable regardless of the environment variables set at the time <b>scons</b> is invoked. If you want to
           propagate a shell environment variable to the commands executed to build target files, you must do so
           explicitly. A common example is the system <b>PATH</b> environment variable, so that <b>scons</b> will find
           utilities the same way as the invoking shell (or other process):

               import os
               env = Environment(ENV={'PATH': os.environ['PATH']})

           Although it is usually not recommended, you can propagate the entire shell environment in one go:

               import os
               env = Environment(ENV=os.environ.copy())

       <b>ESCAPE</b>
           A function that will be called to escape shell special characters in command lines. The function
           should take one argument: the command line string to escape; and should return the escaped command
           line.

       <b>F03</b>
           The Fortran 03 compiler. You should normally set the <b>$FORTRAN</b> variable, which specifies the default
           Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions. You only need to set <b>$F03</b> if you need to use a specific
           compiler or compiler version for Fortran 03 files.

       <b>F03COM</b>
           The command line used to compile a Fortran 03 source file to an object file. You only need to set
           <b>$F03COM</b> if you need to use a specific command line for Fortran 03 files. You should normally set the
           <b>$FORTRANCOM</b> variable, which specifies the default command line for all Fortran versions.

       <b>F03COMSTR</b>
           If set, the string displayed when a Fortran 03 source file is compiled to an object file. If not set,
           then <b>$F03COM</b> or <b>$FORTRANCOM</b> (the command line) is displayed.

       <b>F03FILESUFFIXES</b>
           The list of file extensions for which the F03 dialect will be used. By default, this is ['.f03']

       <b>F03FLAGS</b>
           General user-specified options that are passed to the Fortran 03 compiler. Note that this variable
           does <u>not</u> contain <b>-I</b> (or similar) include search path options that scons generates automatically from
           <b>$F03PATH</b>. See <b>$_F03INCFLAGS</b> below, for the variable that expands to those options. You only need to
           set <b>$F03FLAGS</b> if you need to define specific user options for Fortran 03 files. You should normally
           set the <b>$FORTRANFLAGS</b> variable, which specifies the user-specified options passed to the default
           Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

       <b>_F03INCFLAGS</b>
           An automatically-generated construction variable containing the Fortran 03 compiler command-line
           options for specifying directories to be searched for include files. The value of <b>$_F03INCFLAGS</b> is
           created by appending <b>$INCPREFIX</b> and <b>$INCSUFFIX</b> to the beginning and end of each directory in
           <b>$F03PATH</b>.

       <b>F03PATH</b>
           The list of directories that the Fortran 03 compiler will search for include directories. The
           implicit dependency scanner will search these directories for include files. Don't explicitly put
           include directory arguments in <b>$F03FLAGS</b> because the result will be non-portable and the directories
           will not be searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in <b>$F03PATH</b> will be looked-up
           relative to the SConscript directory when they are used in a command. To force <b>scons</b> to look-up a
           directory relative to the root of the source tree use #: You only need to set <b>$F03PATH</b> if you need to
           define a specific include path for Fortran 03 files. You should normally set the <b>$FORTRANPATH</b>
           variable, which specifies the include path for the default Fortran compiler for all Fortran versions.

               env = Environment(F03PATH='#/include')

           The directory look-up can also be forced using the <b>Dir</b>() function:

               include = Dir('include')

           for specifying directories to be searched for include files and module files. The value of
           <b>$_FORTRANINCFLAGS</b> is created by respectively prepending and appending <b>$INCPREFIX</b> and <b>$INCSUFFIX</b> to
           the beginning and end of each directory in <b>$FORTRANPATH</b>.

       <b>FORTRANMODDIR</b>
           Directory location where the Fortran compiler should place any module files it generates. This
           variable is empty, by default. Some Fortran compilers will internally append this directory in the
           search path for module files, as well.

       <b>FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX</b>
           The prefix used to specify a module directory on the Fortran compiler command line. This will be
           prepended to the beginning of the directory in the <b>$FORTRANMODDIR</b> construction variables when the
           <b>$_FORTRANMODFLAG</b> variables is automatically generated.

       <b>FORTRANMODDIRSUFFIX</b>
           The suffix used to specify a module directory on the Fortran compiler command line. This will be
           appended to the end of the directory in the <b>$FORTRANMODDIR</b> construction variables when the
           <b>$_FORTRANMODFLAG</b> variables is automatically generated.

       <b>_FORTRANMODFLAG</b>
           An automatically-generated construction variable containing the Fortran compiler command-line option
           for specifying the directory location where the Fortran compiler should place any module files that
           happen to get generated during compilation. The value of <b>$_FORTRANMODFLAG</b> is created by respectively
           prepending and appending <b>$FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX</b> and <b>$FORTRANMODDIRSUFFIX</b> to the beginning and end of
           the directory in <b>$FORTRANMODDIR</b>.

       <b>FORTRANMODPREFIX</b>
           The module file prefix used by the Fortran compiler. SCons assumes that the Fortran compiler follows
           the quasi-standard naming convention for module files of module_name.mod. As a result, this variable
           is left empty, by default. For situations in which the compiler does not necessarily follow the
           normal convention, the user may use this variable. Its value will be appended to every module file
           name as scons attempts to resolve dependencies.

       <b>FORTRANMODSUFFIX</b>
           The module file suffix used by the Fortran compiler. SCons assumes that the Fortran compiler follows
           the quasi-standard naming convention for module files of module_name.mod. As a result, this variable
           is set to ".mod", by default. For situations in which the compiler does not necessarily follow the
           normal convention, the user may use this variable. Its value will be appended to every module file
           name as scons attempts to resolve dependencies.

       <b>FORTRANPATH</b>
           The list of directories that the Fortran compiler will search for include files and (for some
           compilers) module files. The Fortran implicit dependency scanner will search these directories for
           include files (but not module files since they are autogenerated and, as such, may not actually exist
           at the time the scan takes place). Don't explicitly put include directory arguments in FORTRANFLAGS
           because the result will be non-portable and the directories will not be searched by the dependency
           scanner. Note: directory names in FORTRANPATH will be looked-up relative to the SConscript directory
           when they are used in a command. To force <b>scons</b> to look-up a directory relative to the root of the
           source tree use #:

               env = Environment(FORTRANPATH='#/include')

           The directory look-up can also be forced using the <b>Dir</b>() function:

               include = Dir('include')
               env = Environment(FORTRANPATH=include)

           The directory list will be added to command lines through the automatically-generated
           <b>$_FORTRANINCFLAGS</b> construction variable, which is constructed by respectively prepending and
           appending the values of the <b>$INCPREFIX</b> and <b>$INCSUFFIX</b> construction variables to the beginning and end
           of each directory in <b>$FORTRANPATH</b>. Any command lines you define that need the FORTRANPATH directory
           list should include <b>$_FORTRANINCFLAGS</b>:

               env = Environment(FORTRANCOM="my_compiler $_FORTRANINCFLAGS -c -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

       <b>FORTRANPPCOM</b>
           The command line used to compile a Fortran source file to an object file after first running the file
           through the C preprocessor. By default, any options specified in the <b>$FORTRANFLAGS</b>, <b>$CPPFLAGS</b>,
           <b>$_CPPDEFFLAGS</b>, <b>$_FORTRANMODFLAG</b>, and <b>$_FORTRANINCFLAGS</b> construction variables are included on this
           command line.

       <b>FORTRANPPCOMSTR</b>
           If set, the string displayed when a Fortran source file is compiled to an object file after first
           running the file through the C preprocessor. If not set, then <b>$FORTRANPPCOM</b> (the command line) is
           displayed.

       <b>FORTRANPPFILESUFFIXES</b>
           The list of file extensions for which the compilation + preprocessor pass for FORTRAN dialect will be
           used. By default, this is ['.fpp', '.FPP']

       <b>FORTRANSUFFIXES</b>
           The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for Fortran implicit dependencies (INCLUDE lines
           and USE statements). The default list is:

               [".f", ".F", ".for", ".FOR", ".ftn", ".FTN", ".fpp", ".FPP",
               ".f77", ".F77", ".f90", ".F90", ".f95", ".F95"]

       <b>FRAMEWORKPATH</b>
           On Mac OS X with gcc, a list containing the paths to search for frameworks. Used by the compiler to
           find framework-style includes like #include &lt;Fmwk/Header.h&gt;. Used by the linker to find
           user-specified frameworks when linking (see <b>$FRAMEWORKS</b>). For example:

               env.AppendUnique(FRAMEWORKPATH='#myframeworkdir')

           will add

               ... -Fmyframeworkdir

           to the compiler and linker command lines.

       <b>_FRAMEWORKPATH</b>
           On Mac OS X with gcc, an automatically-generated construction variable containing the linker
           command-line options corresponding to <b>$FRAMEWORKPATH</b>.

       <b>FRAMEWORKPATHPREFIX</b>
           On Mac OS X with gcc, the prefix to be used for the FRAMEWORKPATH entries. (see <b>$FRAMEWORKPATH</b>). The
           default value is <b>-F</b>.

       <b>FRAMEWORKPREFIX</b>
           On Mac OS X with gcc, the prefix to be used for linking in frameworks (see <b>$FRAMEWORKS</b>). The default
           value is <b>-framework</b>.

       <b>FRAMEWORKS</b>
           On Mac OS X with gcc, a list of the framework names to be linked into a program or shared library or
           bundle. The default value is the empty list. For example:

               env.AppendUnique(FRAMEWORKS=Split('System Cocoa SystemConfiguration'))

       <b>_FRAMEWORKS</b>
           On Mac OS X with gcc, an automatically-generated construction variable containing the linker
           command-line options for linking with FRAMEWORKS.

       <b>FRAMEWORKSFLAGS</b>
           On Mac OS X with gcc, general user-supplied frameworks options to be added at the end of a command
           line building a loadable module. (This has been largely superseded by the <b>$FRAMEWORKPATH</b>,
           <b>$FRAMEWORKPATHPREFIX</b>, <b>$FRAMEWORKPREFIX</b> and <b>$FRAMEWORKS</b> variables described above.)

       <b>GS</b>
           The Ghostscript program used to, for example, convert PostScript to PDF files.

       <b>GSCOM</b>
           The full Ghostscript command line used for the conversion process. Its default value is “$GS $GSFLAGS
           -sOutputFile=$TARGET $SOURCES”.

       <b>GSCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when Ghostscript is called for the conversion process. If this is not set (the
           default), then <b>$GSCOM</b> (the command line) is displayed.

       <b>GSFLAGS</b>
           General options passed to the Ghostscript program, when converting PostScript to PDF files for
           example. Its default value is “-dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite”

       <b>HOST_ARCH</b>
           The name of the host hardware architecture used to create this construction environment. The platform
           code sets this when initializing (see <b>$PLATFORM</b> and the <u>platform</u> argument to <b>Environment</b>). Note the
           detected name of the architecture may not be identical to that returned by the Python
           platform.machine method.

           On the win32 platform, if the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler is available, msvc tool setup is done
           using <b>$HOST_ARCH</b> and <b>$TARGET_ARCH</b>. Changing the values at any later time will not cause the tool to
           be reinitialized. Valid host arch values are x86 and arm for 32-bit hosts and amd64 and x86_64 for
           64-bit hosts.

           Should be considered immutable.  <b>$HOST_ARCH</b> is not currently used by other platforms, but the option
           is reserved to do so in future

       <b>HOST_OS</b>
           The name of the host operating system for the platform used to create this construction environment.
           The platform code sets this when initializing (see <b>$PLATFORM</b> and the <u>platform</u> argument to
           <b>Environment</b>).

           Should be considered immutable.  <b>$HOST_OS</b> is not currently used by SCons, but the option is reserved
           to do so in future

       <b>IDLSUFFIXES</b>
           The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for IDL implicit dependencies (#include or import
           lines). The default list is:

               [".idl", ".IDL"]

       <b>IMPLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS</b>
           Used to override <b>$SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS</b>/<b>$LDMODULENOVERSIONSYMLINKS</b> when creating versioned import
           library for a shared library/loadable module. If not defined, then
           <b>$SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS</b>/<b>$LDMODULENOVERSIONSYMLINKS</b> is used to determine whether to disable symlink
           generation or not.

       <b>IMPLIBPREFIX</b>
           The prefix used for import library names. For example, cygwin uses import libraries (libfoo.dll.a) in
           pair with dynamic libraries (cygfoo.dll). The cyglink linker sets <b>$IMPLIBPREFIX</b> to 'lib' and
           <b>$SHLIBPREFIX</b> to 'cyg'.

       <b>IMPLIBSUFFIX</b>
           The suffix used for import library names. For example, cygwin uses import libraries (libfoo.dll.a) in
           pair with dynamic libraries (cygfoo.dll). The cyglink linker sets <b>$IMPLIBSUFFIX</b> to '.dll.a' and
           <b>$SHLIBSUFFIX</b> to '.dll'.

       <b>IMPLIBVERSION</b>
           Used to override <b>$SHLIBVERSION</b>/<b>$LDMODULEVERSION</b> when generating versioned import library for a shared
           library/loadable module. If undefined, the <b>$SHLIBVERSION</b>/<b>$LDMODULEVERSION</b> is used to determine the
           version of versioned import library.

       <b>IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES</b>
           Controls whether or not SCons will add implicit dependencies for the commands executed to build
           targets.

           By default, SCons will add to each target an implicit dependency on the command represented by the
           first argument of any command line it executes (which is typically the command itself). By setting
           such a dependency, SCons can determine that a target should be rebuilt if the command changes, such
           as when a compiler is upgraded to a new version. The specific file for the dependency is found by
           searching the <u>PATH</u> variable in the <u>ENV</u> dictionary in the construction environment used to execute the
           command. The default is the same as setting the construction variable <b>$IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES</b>
           to a True-like value (“true”, “yes”, or “1” - but not a number greater than one, as that has a
           different meaning).

           Action strings can be segmented by the use of an AND operator, &amp;&amp;. In a segemented string, each
           segment is a separate “command line”, these are run sequentially until one fails or the entire
           sequence has been executed. If an action string is segmented, then the selected behavior of
           <b>$IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES</b> is applied to each segment.

           If <b>$IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES</b> is set to a False-like value (“none”, “false”, “no”, “0”, etc.),
           then the implicit dependency will not be added to the targets built with that construction
           environment.

           If <b>$IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES</b> is set to “2” or higher, then that number of arguments in the
           command line will be scanned for relative or absolute paths. If any are present, they will be added
           as implicit dependencies to the targets built with that construction environment. The first argument
           in the command line will be searched for using the <u>PATH</u> variable in the <u>ENV</u> dictionary in the
           construction environment used to execute the command. The other arguments will only be found if they
           are absolute paths or valid paths relative to the working directory.

           If <b>$IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES</b> is set to “all”, then all arguments in the command line will be
           scanned for relative or absolute paths. If any are present, they will be added as implicit
           dependencies to the targets built with that construction environment. The first argument in the
           command line will be searched for using the <u>PATH</u> variable in the <u>ENV</u> dictionary in the construction
           environment used to execute the command. The other arguments will only be found if they are absolute
           paths or valid paths relative to the working directory.

               env = Environment(IMPLICIT_COMMAND_DEPENDENCIES=False)

       <b>INCPREFIX</b>
           The prefix used to specify an include directory on the C compiler command line. This will be
           prepended to each directory in the <b>$CPPPATH</b> and <b>$FORTRANPATH</b> construction variables when the
           <b>$_CPPINCFLAGS</b> and <b>$_FORTRANINCFLAGS</b> variables are automatically generated.

       <b>INCSUFFIX</b>
           The suffix used to specify an include directory on the C compiler command line. This will be appended
           to each directory in the <b>$CPPPATH</b> and <b>$FORTRANPATH</b> construction variables when the <b>$_CPPINCFLAGS</b> and
           <b>$_FORTRANINCFLAGS</b> variables are automatically generated.

       <b>INSTALL</b>
           A function to be called to install a file into a destination file name. The default function copies
           the file into the destination (and sets the destination file's mode and permission bits to match the
           source file's). The function takes the following arguments:

               def install(dest, source, env):

           <u>dest</u> is the path name of the destination file.  <u>source</u> is the path name of the source file.  <u>env</u> is
           the construction environment (a dictionary of construction values) in force for this file
           installation.

       <b>INSTALLSTR</b>
           The string displayed when a file is installed into a destination file name. The default is:

               Install file: "$SOURCE" as "$TARGET"

       <b>INTEL_C_COMPILER_VERSION</b>
           Set by the intelc Tool to the major version number of the Intel C compiler selected for use.

       <b>JAR</b>
           The Java archive tool.

       <b>JARCHDIR</b>
           The directory to which the Java archive tool should change (using the <b>-C</b> option).

       <b>JARCOM</b>
           The command line used to call the Java archive tool.

       <b>JARCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when the Java archive tool is called If this is not set, then <b>$JARCOM</b> (the
           command line) is displayed.

               env = Environment(JARCOMSTR="JARchiving $SOURCES into $TARGET")

       <b>JARFLAGS</b>
           General options passed to the Java archive tool. By default this is set to <b>cf</b> to create the necessary
           <b>jar</b> file.

       <b>JARSUFFIX</b>
           The suffix for Java archives: .jar by default.

       <b>JAVABOOTCLASSPATH</b>
           Specifies the location of the bootstrap class files. Can be specified as a string or Node object, or
           as a list of strings or Node objects.

           The value will be added to the JDK command lines via the <b>-bootclasspath</b> option, which requires a
           system-specific search path separator. This will be supplied by SCons as needed when it constructs
           the command line if <b>$JAVABOOTCLASSPATH</b> is provided in list form. If <b>$JAVABOOTCLASSPATH</b> is a single
           string containing search path separator characters (: for POSIX systems or ; for Windows), it will
           not be modified; and so is inherently system-specific; to supply the path in a system-independent
           manner, give <b>$JAVABOOTCLASSPATH</b> as a list of paths instead.

               <b>Note</b>
               Can only be used when compiling for releases prior to JDK 9.

       <b>JAVAC</b>
           The Java compiler.

       <b>JAVACCOM</b>
           The command line used to compile a directory tree containing Java source files to corresponding Java
           class files. Any options specified in the <b>$JAVACFLAGS</b> construction variable are included on this
           command line.

       <b>JAVACCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when compiling a directory tree of Java source files to corresponding Java class
           files. If this is not set, then <b>$JAVACCOM</b> (the command line) is displayed.

               env = Environment(JAVACCOMSTR="Compiling class files $TARGETS from $SOURCES")

       <b>JAVACFLAGS</b>
           General options that are passed to the Java compiler.

       <b>JAVACLASSDIR</b>
           The directory in which Java class files may be found. This is stripped from the beginning of any Java
           .class file names supplied to the <b>JavaH</b> builder.

       <b>JAVACLASSPATH</b>
           Specifies the class search path for the JDK tools. Can be specified as a string or Node object, or as
           a list of strings or Node objects. Class path entries may be directory names to search for class
           files or packages, pathnames to archives (.jar or .zip) containing classes, or paths ending in a
           "base name wildcard" character (*), which matches files in that directory with a .jar suffix. See the
           Java documentation for more details.

           The value will be added to the JDK command lines via the <b>-classpath</b> option, which requires a
           system-specific search path separator. This will be supplied by SCons as needed when it constructs
           the command line if <b>$JAVACLASSPATH</b> is provided in list form. If <b>$JAVACLASSPATH</b> is a single string
           containing search path separator characters (: for POSIX systems or ; for Windows), it will be split
           on the separator into a list of individual paths for dependency scanning purposes. It will not be
           modified for JDK command-line usage, so such a string is inherently system-specific; to supply the
           path in a system-independent manner, give <b>$JAVACLASSPATH</b> as a list of paths instead.

               <b>Note</b>

               SCons <b>always</b> supplies a <b>-sourcepath</b> when invoking the Java compiler javac, regardless of the
               setting of <b>$JAVASOURCEPATH</b>, as it passes the path(s) to the source(s) supplied in the call to the
               <b>Java</b> builder via <b>-sourcepath</b> . From the documentation of the standard Java toolkit for javac: “If
               not compiling code for modules, if the <b>--source-path</b> or <b>-sourcepath</b> option is not specified, then
               the user class path is also searched for source files.”  Since <b>-sourcepath</b> is always supplied,
               javac will not use the contents of the value of <b>$JAVACLASSPATH</b> when searching for sources.

       <b>JAVACLASSSUFFIX</b>
           The suffix for Java class files; .class by default.

       <b>JAVAH</b>
           The Java generator for C header and stub files.

       <b>JAVAHCOM</b>
           The command line used to generate C header and stub files from Java classes. Any options specified in
           the <b>$JAVAHFLAGS</b> construction variable are included on this command line.

       <b>JAVAHCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when C header and stub files are generated from Java classes. If this is not
           set, then <b>$JAVAHCOM</b> (the command line) is displayed.

               env = Environment(JAVAHCOMSTR="Generating header/stub file(s) $TARGETS from $SOURCES")

       <b>JAVAHFLAGS</b>
           General options passed to the C header and stub file generator for Java classes.

       <b>JAVAINCLUDES</b>
           Include path for Java header files (such as jni.h).

       <b>JAVAPROCESSORPATH</b>
           Specifies the location of the annotation processor class files. Can be specified as a string or Node
           object, or as a list of strings or Node objects.

           The value will be added to the JDK command lines via the <b>-processorpath</b> option, which requires a
           system-specific search path separator. This will be supplied by SCons as needed when it constructs
           the command line if <b>$JAVAPROCESSORPATH</b> is provided in list form. If <b>$JAVAPROCESSORPATH</b> is a single
           string containing search path separator characters (: for POSIX systems or ; for Windows), it will
           not be modified; and so is inherently system-specific; to supply the path in a system-independent
           manner, give <b>$JAVAPROCESSORPATH</b> as a list of paths instead.

           <u>New</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.5.0</u>

       <b>JAVASOURCEPATH</b>
           Specifies the list of directories that will be searched for input (source) .java files. Can be
           specified as a string or Node object, or as a list of strings or Node objects.

           The value will be added to the JDK command lines via the <b>-sourcepath</b> option, which requires a
           system-specific search path separator, This will be supplied by SCons as needed when it constructs
           the command line if <b>$JAVASOURCEPATH</b> is provided in list form. If <b>$JAVASOURCEPATH</b> is a single string
           containing search path separator characters (: for POSIX systems or ; for Windows), it will not be
           modified, and so is inherently system-specific; to supply the path in a system-independent manner,
           give <b>$JAVASOURCEPATH</b> as a list of paths instead.

           Note that the specified directories are only added to the command line via the <b>-sourcepath</b> option.
           SCons does not currently search the <b>$JAVASOURCEPATH</b> directories for dependent .java files.

       <b>JAVASUFFIX</b>
           The suffix for Java files; .java by default.

       <b>JAVAVERSION</b>
           Specifies the Java version being used by the <b>Java</b> builder. Set this to specify the version of Java
           targeted by the javac compiler. This is sometimes necessary because Java 1.5 changed the file names
           that are created for nested anonymous inner classes, which can cause a mismatch with the files that
           SCons expects will be generated by the javac compiler. Setting <b>$JAVAVERSION</b> to a version greater than
           1.4 makes SCons realize that a build with such a compiler is actually up to date. The default is 1.4.

           While this is <u>not</u> primarily intended for selecting one version of the Java compiler vs. another, it
           does have that effect on the Windows platform. A more precise approach is to set <b>$JAVAC</b> (and related
           construction variables for related utilities) to the path to the specific Java compiler you want, if
           that is not the default compiler. On non-Windows platforms, the alternatives system may provide a way
           to adjust the default Java compiler without having to specify explicit paths.

       <b>LATEX</b>
           The LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

       <b>LATEXCOM</b>
           The command line used to call the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

       <b>LATEXCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when calling the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter. If this is not set,
           then <b>$LATEXCOM</b> (the command line) is displayed.

               env = Environment(LATEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from LaTeX input $SOURCES")

       <b>LATEXFLAGS</b>
           General options passed to the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

       <b>LATEXRETRIES</b>
           The maximum number of times that LaTeX will be re-run if the .log generated by the <b>$LATEXCOM</b> command
           indicates that there are undefined references. The default is to try to resolve undefined references
           by re-running LaTeX up to three times.

       <b>LATEXSUFFIXES</b>
           The list of suffixes of files that will be scanned for LaTeX implicit dependencies (\include or
           \import files). The default list is:

               [".tex", ".ltx", ".latex"]

       <b>LDMODULE</b>
           The linker for building loadable modules. By default, this is the same as <b>$SHLINK</b>.

       <b>LDMODULECOM</b>
           The command line for building loadable modules. On Mac OS X, this uses the <b>$LDMODULE</b>, <b>$LDMODULEFLAGS</b>
           and <b>$FRAMEWORKSFLAGS</b> variables. On other systems, this is the same as <b>$SHLINK</b>.

       <b>LDMODULECOMSTR</b>
           If set, the string displayed when building loadable modules. If not set, then <b>$LDMODULECOM</b> (the
           command line) is displayed.

       <b>LDMODULEEMITTER</b>
           Contains the emitter specification for the <b>LoadableModule</b> builder. The manpage section "Builder
           Objects" contains general information on specifying emitters.

       <b>LDMODULEFLAGS</b>
           General user options passed to the linker for building loadable modules.

       <b>LDMODULENOVERSIONSYMLINKS</b>
           Instructs the <b>LoadableModule</b> builder to not automatically create symlinks for versioned modules.
           Defaults to $SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS

       <b>LDMODULEPREFIX</b>
           The prefix used for loadable module file names. On Mac OS X, this is null; on other systems, this is
           the same as <b>$SHLIBPREFIX</b>.

       <b>_LDMODULESONAME</b>
           A macro that automatically generates loadable module's SONAME based on $TARGET, $LDMODULEVERSION and
           $LDMODULESUFFIX. Used by <b>LoadableModule</b> builder when the linker tool supports SONAME (e.g.  gnulink).

       <b>LDMODULESUFFIX</b>
           The suffix used for loadable module file names. On Mac OS X, this is null; on other systems, this is
           the same as $SHLIBSUFFIX.

       <b>LDMODULEVERSION</b>
           When this construction variable is defined, a versioned loadable module is created by <b>LoadableModule</b>
           builder. This activates the <b>$_LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS</b> and thus modifies the <b>$LDMODULECOM</b> as required,
           adds the version number to the library name, and creates the symlinks that are needed.
           <b>$LDMODULEVERSION</b> versions should exist in the same format as <b>$SHLIBVERSION</b>.

       <b>_LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS</b>
           This macro automatically introduces extra flags to <b>$LDMODULECOM</b> when building versioned
           <b>LoadableModule</b> (that is when <b>$LDMODULEVERSION</b> is set).  _LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS usually adds
           <b>$SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS</b> and some extra dynamically generated options (such as
           -Wl,-soname=$_LDMODULESONAME). It is unused by plain (unversioned) loadable modules.

       <b>LDMODULEVERSIONFLAGS</b>
           Extra flags added to <b>$LDMODULECOM</b> when building versioned <b>LoadableModule</b>. These flags are only used
           when <b>$LDMODULEVERSION</b> is set.

       <b>LEX</b>
           The lexical analyzer generator.

       <b>LEX_HEADER_FILE</b>
           If supplied, generate a C header file with the name taken from this variable. Will be emitted as a
           <b>--header-file=</b> command-line option. Use this in preference to including <b>--header-file=</b> in <b>$LEXFLAGS</b>
           directly.

       <b>LEX_TABLES_FILE</b>
           If supplied, write the lex tables to a file with the name taken from this variable. Will be emitted
           as a <b>--tables-file=</b> command-line option. Use this in preference to including <b>--tables-file=</b> in
           <b>$LEXFLAGS</b> directly.

       <b>LEXCOM</b>
           The command line used to call the lexical analyzer generator to generate a source file.

       <b>LEXCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when generating a source file using the lexical analyzer generator. If this is
           not set, then <b>$LEXCOM</b> (the command line) is displayed.

               env = Environment(LEXCOMSTR="Lex'ing $TARGET from $SOURCES")

       <b>LEXFLAGS</b>
           General options passed to the lexical analyzer generator. In addition to passing the value on during
           invocation, the lex tool also examines this construction variable for options which cause additional
           output files to be generated, and adds those to the target list. Recognized for this purpose are GNU
           flex options <b>--header-file=</b> and <b>--tables-file=</b>; the output file is named by the option argument.

           Note that files specified by <b>--header-file=</b> and <b>--tables-file=</b> may not be properly handled by SCons
           in all situations. Consider using <b>$LEX_HEADER_FILE</b> and <b>$LEX_TABLES_FILE</b> instead.

       <b>LEXUNISTD</b>
           Used only on windows environments to set a lex flag to prevent 'unistd.h' from being included. The
           default value is '--nounistd'.

       <b>_LIBDIRFLAGS</b>
           An automatically-generated construction variable containing the linker command-line options for
           specifying directories to be searched for library. The value of <b>$_LIBDIRFLAGS</b> is created by
           respectively prepending and appending <b>$LIBDIRPREFIX</b> and <b>$LIBDIRSUFFIX</b> to each directory in <b>$LIBPATH</b>.

       <b>LIBDIRPREFIX</b>
           The prefix used to specify a library directory on the linker command line. This will be prepended to
           each directory in the <b>$LIBPATH</b> construction variable when the <b>$_LIBDIRFLAGS</b> variable is automatically
           generated.

       <b>LIBDIRSUFFIX</b>
           The suffix used to specify a library directory on the linker command line. This will be appended to
           each directory in the <b>$LIBPATH</b> construction variable when the <b>$_LIBDIRFLAGS</b> variable is automatically
           generated.

       <b>LIBEMITTER</b>
           Contains the emitter specification for the <b>StaticLibrary</b> builder. The manpage section "Builder
           Objects" contains general information on specifying emitters.

       <b>_LIBFLAGS</b>
           An automatically-generated construction variable containing the linker command-line options for
           specifying libraries to be linked with the resulting target. The value of <b>$_LIBFLAGS</b> is created by
           respectively prepending and appending <b>$LIBLINKPREFIX</b> and <b>$LIBLINKSUFFIX</b> to each filename in <b>$LIBS</b>.

       <b>LIBLINKPREFIX</b>
           The prefix used to specify a library to link on the linker command line. This will be prepended to
           each library in the <b>$LIBS</b> construction variable when the <b>$_LIBFLAGS</b> variable is automatically
           generated.

       <b>LIBLINKSUFFIX</b>
           The suffix used to specify a library to link on the linker command line. This will be appended to
           each library in the <b>$LIBS</b> construction variable when the <b>$_LIBFLAGS</b> variable is automatically
           generated.

       <b>LIBPATH</b>
           The list of directories that will be searched for libraries specified by the <b>$LIBS</b> construction
           variable.  <b>$LIBPATH</b> should be a list of path strings, or a single string, not a pathname list joined
           by Python's os.sep.

           Do not put library search directives directly into <b>$LINKFLAGS</b> or <b>$SHLINKFLAGS</b> as the result will be
           non-portable.

           Note: directory names in <b>$LIBPATH</b> will be looked-up relative to the directory of the SConscript file
           when they are used in a command. To force <b>scons</b> to look-up a directory relative to the root of the
           source tree use the # prefix:

               env = Environment(LIBPATH='#/libs')

           The directory look-up can also be forced using the <b>Dir</b> function:

               libs = Dir('libs')
               env = Environment(LIBPATH=libs)

           The directory list will be added to command lines through the automatically-generated <b>$_LIBDIRFLAGS</b>
           construction variable, which is constructed by respectively prepending and appending the values of
           the <b>$LIBDIRPREFIX</b> and <b>$LIBDIRSUFFIX</b> construction variables to each directory in <b>$LIBPATH</b>. Any command
           lines you define that need the <b>$LIBPATH</b> directory list should include <b>$_LIBDIRFLAGS</b>:

               env = Environment(LINKCOM="my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

       <b>LIBPREFIX</b>
           The prefix used for (static) library file names. A default value is set for each platform (posix,
           win32, os2, etc.), but the value is overridden by individual tools (ar, mslib, sgiar, sunar, tlib,
           etc.) to reflect the names of the libraries they create.

       <b>LIBPREFIXES</b>
           A list of all legal prefixes for library file names. When searching for library dependencies, SCons
           will look for files with these prefixes, the base library name, and suffixes from the <b>$LIBSUFFIXES</b>
           list.

       <b>LIBS</b>
           A list of one or more libraries that will be added to the link line for linking with any executable
           program, shared library, or loadable module created by the construction environment or override.

           String-valued library names should include only the library base names, without prefixes such as lib
           or suffixes such as .so or .dll. The library list will be added to command lines through the
           automatically-generated <b>$_LIBFLAGS</b> construction variable which is constructed by respectively
           prepending and appending the values of the <b>$LIBLINKPREFIX</b> and <b>$LIBLINKSUFFIX</b> construction variables
           to each library name in <b>$LIBS</b>. Library name strings should not include a path component, instead the
           compiler will be directed to look for libraries in the paths specified by <b>$LIBPATH</b>.

           Any command lines you define that need the <b>$LIBS</b> library list should include <b>$_LIBFLAGS</b>:

               env = Environment(LINKCOM="my_linker $_LIBDIRFLAGS $_LIBFLAGS -o $TARGET $SOURCE")

           If you add a File object to the <b>$LIBS</b> list, the name of that file will be added to <b>$_LIBFLAGS</b>, and
           thus to the link line, as-is, without <b>$LIBLINKPREFIX</b> or <b>$LIBLINKSUFFIX</b>. For example:

               env.Append(LIBS=File('/tmp/mylib.so'))

           In all cases, scons will add dependencies from the executable program to all the libraries in this
           list.

       <b>LIBSUFFIX</b>
           The suffix used for (static) library file names. A default value is set for each platform (posix,
           win32, os2, etc.), but the value is overridden by individual tools (ar, mslib, sgiar, sunar, tlib,
           etc.) to reflect the names of the libraries they create.

       <b>LIBSUFFIXES</b>
           A list of all legal suffixes for library file names. When searching for library dependencies, SCons
           will look for files with prefixes from the <b>$LIBPREFIXES</b> list, the base library name, and these
           suffixes.

       <b>LICENSE</b>
           The abbreviated name, preferably the SPDX code, of the license under which this project is released
           (GPL-3.0, LGPL-2.1, BSD-2-Clause etc.). See <b><a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical</a></b>[7] for a
           list of license names and SPDX codes.

           See the <b>Package</b> builder.

       <b>LINESEPARATOR</b>
           The separator used by the <b>Substfile</b> and <b>Textfile</b> builders. This value is used between sources when
           constructing the target. It defaults to the current system line separator.

       <b>LINGUAS_FILE</b>
           The <b>$LINGUAS_FILE</b> defines file(s) containing list of additional linguas to be processed by <b>POInit</b>,
           <b>POUpdate</b> or <b>MOFiles</b> builders. It also affects <b>Translate</b> builder. If the variable contains a string,
           it defines name of the list file. The <b>$LINGUAS_FILE</b> may be a list of file names as well. If
           <b>$LINGUAS_FILE</b> is set to True (or non-zero numeric value), the list will be read from default file
           named LINGUAS.

       <b>LINK</b>
           The linker. See also <b>$SHLINK</b> for linking shared objects.

           On POSIX systems (those using the link tool), you should normally not change this value as it
           defaults to a "smart" linker tool which selects a compiler driver matching the type of source files
           in use. So for example, if you set <b>$CXX</b> to a specific compiler name, and are compiling C++ sources,
           the smartlink function will automatically select the same compiler for linking.

       <b>LINKCOM</b>
           The command line used to link object files into an executable. See also <b>$SHLINKCOM</b> for linking shared
           objects.

       <b>LINKCOMSTR</b>
           If set, the string displayed when object files are linked into an executable. If not set, then
           <b>$LINKCOM</b> (the command line) is displayed. See also <b>$SHLINKCOMSTR</b>. for linking shared objects.

               env = Environment(LINKCOMSTR = "Linking $TARGET")

       <b>LINKFLAGS</b>
           General user options passed to the linker. Note that this variable should <u>not</u> contain <b>-l</b> (or similar)
           options for linking with the libraries listed in <b>$LIBS</b>, nor <b>-L</b> (or similar) library search path
           options that scons generates automatically from <b>$LIBPATH</b>. See <b>$_LIBFLAGS</b> above, for the variable that
           expands to library-link options, and <b>$_LIBDIRFLAGS</b> above, for the variable that expands to library
           search path options. See also <b>$SHLINKFLAGS</b>. for linking shared objects.

       <b>M4</b>
           The M4 macro preprocessor.

       <b>M4COM</b>
           The command line used to pass files through the M4 macro preprocessor.

       <b>M4COMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when a file is passed through the M4 macro preprocessor. If this is not set,
           then <b>$M4COM</b> (the command line) is displayed.

       <b>M4FLAGS</b>
           General options passed to the M4 macro preprocessor.

       <b>MAKEINDEX</b>
           The makeindex generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX structured formatter and
           typesetter.

       <b>MAKEINDEXCOM</b>
           The command line used to call the makeindex generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter and the
           LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter.

       <b>MAKEINDEXCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when calling the makeindex generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter and
           the LaTeX structured formatter and typesetter. If this is not set, then <b>$MAKEINDEXCOM</b> (the command
           line) is displayed.

       <b>MAKEINDEXFLAGS</b>
           General options passed to the makeindex generator for the TeX formatter and typesetter and the LaTeX
           structured formatter and typesetter.

       <b>MAXLINELENGTH</b>
           The maximum number of characters allowed on an external command line. On Win32 systems, link lines
           longer than this many characters are linked via a temporary file name.

       <b>MIDL</b>
           The Microsoft IDL compiler.

       <b>MIDLCOM</b>
           The command line used to pass files to the Microsoft IDL compiler.

       <b>MSSDK_DIR</b>
           The directory containing the Microsoft SDK (either Platform SDK or Windows SDK) to be used for
           compilation.

       <b>MSSDK_VERSION</b>
           The version string of the Microsoft SDK (either Platform SDK or Windows SDK) to be used for
           compilation. Supported versions include 6.1, 6.0A, 6.0, 2003R2 and 2003R1.

       <b>MSVC_BATCH</b>
           When set to any true value, specifies that SCons should batch compilation of object files when
           calling the Microsoft Visual C/C++ compiler. All compilations of source files from the same source
           directory that generate target files in a same output directory and were configured in SCons using
           the same construction environment will be built in a single call to the compiler. Only source files
           that have changed since their object files were built will be passed to each compiler invocation (via
           the <b>$CHANGED_SOURCES</b> construction variable). Any compilations where the object (target) file base
           name (minus the .obj) does not match the source file base name will be compiled separately.

       <b>MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY</b>
           Specify the <b>scons</b> behavior when the Microsoft Visual C/C++ compiler is not detected.

           The <b>$MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY</b> specifies the <b>scons</b> behavior when no msvc versions are detected or when the
           requested msvc version is not detected.

           The valid values for <b>$MSVC_NOTFOUND_POLICY</b> and the corresponding <b>scons</b> behavior are:

           <u>'Error'</u> <u>or</u> <u>'Exception'</u>
               Raise an exception when no msvc versions are detected or when the requested msvc version is not
               detected.

           <u>'Warning'</u> <u>or</u> <u>'Warn'</u>
               Issue a warning and continue when no msvc versions are detected or when the requested msvc

           •   When <b>$MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION</b> is specified using the major msvc version prefix (i.e., 'XX.Y') and
               the major msvc version is that of the latest release of Visual Studio, the selected toolset
               version may not be the same as the default Visual C++ toolset version.

               In the latest release of Visual Studio, the default Visual C++ toolset version is not necessarily
               the toolset with the largest version number.

           Example 1 - A default Visual Studio build with a partial toolset version specified:

               env = Environment(MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION='14.2')

           Example 2 - A default Visual Studio build with a partial toolset version specified:

               env = Environment(MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION='14.29')

           Example 3 - A Visual Studio 2022 build with a full toolset version specified:

               env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION='14.29.30133')

           Example 4 - A Visual Studio 2022 build with an SxS toolset version specified:

               env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION='14.29.16.11')

           Important usage details:

           •    <b>$MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION</b> must be passed as an argument to the <b>Environment</b> constructor when an msvc
               tool (e.g., msvc, msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools list or via a tools list passed to
               the <b>Environment</b> constructor. Otherwise, <b>$MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION</b> must be set before the first msvc
               tool is loaded into the environment.

                <u>The</u> <u>existence</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>toolset</u> <u>host</u> <u>architecture</u> <u>and</u> <u>target</u> <u>architecture</u> <u>folders</u> <u>are</u> <u>not</u> <u>verified</u>
               <u>when</u> <b>$MSVC_TOOLSET_VERSION</b> <u>is</u> <u>specified</u> <u>which</u> <u>could</u> <u>result</u> <u>in</u> <u>build</u> <u>failures.</u>  The burden is on
               the user to ensure the requisite toolset target architecture build tools are installed.

           <u>New</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.4</u>

       <b>MSVC_USE_SCRIPT</b>
           Use a batch script to set up the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

           If set to the name of a Visual Studio .bat file (e.g.  vcvars.bat), SCons will run that batch file
           instead of the auto-detected one, and extract the relevant variables from the result (typically
           <b>%INCLUDE%</b>, <b>%LIB%</b>, and <b>%PATH%</b>) for supplying to the build. This can be useful to force the use of a
           compiler version that SCons does not detect.  <b>$MSVC_USE_SCRIPT_ARGS</b> provides arguments passed to this
           script.

           Setting <b>$MSVC_USE_SCRIPT</b> to <b>None</b> bypasses the Visual Studio autodetection entirely; use this if you
           are running SCons in a Visual Studio <b>cmd</b> window and importing the shell's environment variables -
           that is, if you are sure everything is set correctly already and you don't want SCons to change
           anything.

           <b>$MSVC_USE_SCRIPT</b> ignores <b>$MSVC_VERSION</b> and <b>$TARGET_ARCH</b>.

           <u>Changed</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.4:</u> new <b>$MSVC_USE_SCRIPT_ARGS</b> provides a way to pass arguments.

       <b>MSVC_USE_SCRIPT_ARGS</b>
           Provides arguments passed to the script <b>$MSVC_USE_SCRIPT</b>.

           <u>New</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.4</u>

       <b>MSVC_USE_SETTINGS</b>
           Use a dictionary to set up the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

           <b>$MSVC_USE_SETTINGS</b> is ignored when <b>$MSVC_USE_SCRIPT</b> is defined and/or when <b>$MSVC_USE_SETTINGS</b> is set
           to <b>None</b>.

           The dictionary is used to populate the environment with the relevant variables (typically <b>%INCLUDE%</b>,
           <b>%LIB%</b>, and <b>%PATH%</b>) for supplying to the build. This can be useful to force the use of a compiler
           environment that SCons does not configure correctly. This is an alternative to manually configuring
           the environment when bypassing Visual Studio autodetection entirely by setting <b>$MSVC_USE_SCRIPT</b> to
           <b>None</b>.

           Here is an example of configuring a build environment using the Microsoft Visual C/C++ compiler
           included in the Microsoft SDK on a 64-bit host and building for a 64-bit architecture:

               # Microsoft SDK 6.0 (MSVC 8.0): 64-bit host and 64-bit target
               msvc_use_settings = {

       <b>MSVC_UWP_APP</b>
           Build with the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) application Visual C++ libraries.

           The valid values for <b>$MSVC_UWP_APP</b> are: True, '1', False, '0', or None.

           When <b>$MSVC_UWP_APP</b> is enabled (i.e., True or '1'), the Visual C++ environment will be set up to point
           to the Windows Store compatible libraries and Visual C++ runtimes. In doing so, any libraries that
           are built will be able to be used in a UWP App and published to the Windows Store.

           An exception is raised when any of the following conditions are satisfied:

           •    <b>$MSVC_UWP_APP</b> is enabled for Visual Studio 2013 and earlier.

           •    <b>$MSVC_UWP_APP</b> is enabled and a UWP argument is specified in <b>$MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS</b>. Multiple UWP
               declarations via <b>$MSVC_UWP_APP</b> and <b>$MSVC_SCRIPT_ARGS</b> are not allowed.

           Example - A Visual Studio 2022 build for the Universal Windows Platform:

               env = Environment(MSVC_VERSION='14.3', MSVC_UWP_APP=True)

           Important usage details:

           •    <b>$MSVC_UWP_APP</b> must be passed as an argument to the <b>Environment</b> constructor when an msvc tool
               (e.g., msvc, msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools list or via a tools list passed to the
               <b>Environment</b> constructor. Otherwise, <b>$MSVC_UWP_APP</b> must be set before the first msvc tool is
               loaded into the environment.

           •
                <u>The</u> <u>existence</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>UWP</u> <u>libraries</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>verified</u> <u>when</u> <b>$MSVC_UWP_APP</b> <u>is</u> <u>enabled</u> <u>which</u> <u>could</u>
               <u>result</u> <u>in</u> <u>build</u> <u>failures.</u>  The burden is on the user to ensure the requisite UWP libraries are
               installed.

       <b>MSVC_VERSION</b>
           Sets the preferred version of Microsoft Visual C/C++ to use. If the specified version is unavailable
           (not installed, or not discoverable), tool initialization will fail. If <b>$MSVC_VERSION</b> is not set,
           SCons will (by default) select the latest version of Visual C/C++ installed on your system.

           <b>$MSVC_VERSION</b> must be passed as an argument to the <b>Environment</b> constructor when an msvc tool (e.g.,
           msvc, msvs, etc.) is loaded via the default tools list or via a tools list passed to the <b>Environment</b>
           constructor. Otherwise, <b>$MSVC_VERSION</b> must be set before the first msvc tool is loaded into the
           environment.

           The valid values for <b>$MSVC_VERSION</b> represent major versions of the compiler, except that versions
           ending in Exp refer to "Express" or "Express for Desktop" Visual Studio editions, which require
           distict entries because they use a different filesystem layout and have some feature limitations
           compared to the full version. The following table shows correspondence of the selector string to
           various version indicators ('x' is used as a placeholder for a single digit that can vary). Note that
           it is not necessary to install Visual Studio to build with SCons (for example, you can install only
           Build Tools), but if Visual Studio is installed, additional builders such as <b>MSVSSolution</b> and
           <b>MSVSProject</b> become avaialable and will correspond to the indicated versions.

           VERSION
               the version of MSVS being used (can be set via <b>$MSVC_VERSION</b>)

           VERSIONS
               the available versions of MSVS installed

           VCINSTALLDIR
               installed directory of Visual C++

           VSINSTALLDIR
               installed directory of Visual Studio

           FRAMEWORKDIR
               installed directory of the .NET framework

           FRAMEWORKVERSIONS
               list of installed versions of the .NET framework, sorted latest to oldest.

           FRAMEWORKVERSION
               latest installed version of the .NET framework

           FRAMEWORKSDKDIR
               installed location of the .NET SDK.

           PLATFORMSDKDIR
               installed location of the Platform SDK.

           PLATFORMSDK_MODULES
               dictionary of installed Platform SDK modules, where the dictionary keys are keywords for the
               various modules, and the values are 2-tuples where the first is the release date, and the second
               is the version number.

           If a value is not set, it was not available in the registry. Visual Studio 2017 and later do not use
           the registry for primary storage of this information, so typically for these versions only
           PROJECTSUFFIX and SOLUTIONSUFFIX will be set.

       <b>MSVS_ARCH</b>
           Sets the architecture for which the generated project(s) should build.

           The default value is x86.  amd64 is also supported by SCons for most Visual Studio versions. Since
           Visual Studio 2015 arm is supported, and since Visual Studio 2017 arm64 is supported. Trying to set
           <b>$MSVS_ARCH</b> to an architecture that's not supported for a given Visual Studio version will generate an
           error.

       <b>MSVS_PROJECT_GUID</b>
           The string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++ project file as the value of the ProjectGUID
           attribute. There is no default value. If not defined, a new GUID is generated.

       <b>MSVS_SCC_AUX_PATH</b>
           The path name placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++ project file as the value of the SccAuxPath
           attribute if the <b>MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER</b> construction variable is also set. There is no default value.

       <b>MSVS_SCC_CONNECTION_ROOT</b>
           The root path of projects in your SCC workspace, i.e the path under which all project and solution
           files will be generated. It is used as a reference path from which the relative paths of the
           generated Microsoft Visual C++ project and solution files are computed. The relative project file
           path is placed as the value of the SccLocalPath attribute of the project file and as the values of
           the SccProjectFilePathRelativizedFromConnection[i] (where [i] ranges from 0 to the number of projects
           in the solution) attributes of the GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft Visual
           Studio solution file. Similarly the relative solution file path is placed as the values of the
           SccLocalPath[i] (where [i] ranges from 0 to the number of projects in the solution) attributes of the
           GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft Visual Studio solution file. This is used
           only if the <b>MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER</b> construction variable is also set. The default value is the current
           working directory.

       <b>MSVS_SCC_PROJECT_NAME</b>
           The project name placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++ project file as the value of the
           SccProjectName attribute if the <b>MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER</b> construction variable is also set. In this case the
           string is also placed in the SccProjectName0 attribute of the GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl)
           section of the Microsoft Visual Studio solution file. There is no default value.

       <b>MSVS_SCC_PROVIDER</b>
           The string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++ project file as the value of the SccProvider
           attribute. The string is also placed in the SccProvider0 attribute of the
           GlobalSection(SourceCodeControl) section of the Microsoft Visual Studio solution file. There is no
           default value.

       <b>MSVS_VERSION</b>
           Set the preferred version of Microsoft Visual Studio to use.

           If <b>$MSVS_VERSION</b> is not set, SCons will (by default) select the latest version of Visual Studio
           installed on your system. So, if you have version 6 and version 7 (MSVS .NET) installed, it will
           prefer version 7. You can override this by specifying the <b>$MSVS_VERSION</b> variable when initializing
           the Environment, setting it to the appropriate version ('6.0' or '7.0', for example). If the
           specified version isn't installed, tool initialization will fail.

           <u>Deprecated</u> <u>since</u> <u>1.3.0:</u> <b>$MSVS_VERSION</b> is deprecated in favor of <b>$MSVC_VERSION</b>. As a transitional aid,
           if <b>$MSVS_VERSION</b> is set and <b>$MSVC_VERSION</b> is not, <b>$MSVC_VERSION</b> will be initialized to the value of
           <b>$MSVS_VERSION</b>. An error is raised if If both are set and have different values,

       <b>MSVSBUILDCOM</b>
           The build command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++ project file. The default is to
           have Visual Studio invoke SCons with any specified build targets.

       <b>MSVSCLEANCOM</b>
           The clean command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++ project file. The default is to
           have Visual Studio invoke SCons with the <b>-c</b> option to remove any specified targets.

       <b>MSVSENCODING</b>
           The encoding string placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++ project file. The default is encoding
           Windows-1252.

       <b>MSVSPROJECTCOM</b>
           The action used to generate Microsoft Visual C++ project files.

       <b>MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX</b>
           The suffix used for Microsoft Visual C++ project (DSP) files. The default value is .vcxproj when
           using Visual Studio 2010 and later, .vcproj when using Visual Studio versions between 2002 and 2008,
           and .dsp when using Visual Studio 6.0.

       <b>MSVSREBUILDCOM</b>
           The rebuild command line placed in a generated Microsoft Visual C++ project file. The default is to
           have Visual Studio invoke SCons with any specified rebuild targets.

       <b>MSVSSCONS</b>
           The SCons used in generated Microsoft Visual C++ project files. The default is the version of SCons
           being used to generate the project file.

           The default SCons command used in generated Microsoft Visual C++ project files.

       <b>MSVSSCONSCRIPT</b>
           The sconscript file (that is, SConstruct or SConscript file) that will be invoked by Visual C++
           project files (through the <b>$MSVSSCONSCOM</b> variable). The default is the same sconscript file that
           contains the call to <b>MSVSProject</b> to build the project file.

       <b>MSVSSCONSFLAGS</b>
           The SCons flags used in generated Microsoft Visual C++ project files.

       <b>MSVSSOLUTIONCOM</b>

       <b>MWCW_VERSIONS</b>
           A list of installed versions of the MetroWerks CodeWarrior C compiler on this system.

       <b>NAME</b>
           Specfies the name of the project to package.

           See the <b>Package</b> builder.

       <b>NINJA_ALIAS_NAME</b>
           The name of the alias target which will cause SCons to create the ninja build file, and then
           (optionally) run ninja. The default value is generate-ninja.

       <b>NINJA_CMD_ARGS</b>
           A string which will pass arguments through SCons to the ninja command when scons executes ninja. Has
           no effect if <b>$NINJA_DISABLE_AUTO_RUN</b> is set.

           This value can also be passed on the command line:

               scons NINJA_CMD_ARGS=-v
               or
               scons NINJA_CMD_ARGS="-v -j 3"

       <b>NINJA_COMPDB_EXPAND</b>
           Boolean value to instruct ninja to expand the command line arguments normally put into response
           files. If true, prevents unexpanded lines in the compilation database like “gcc @rsp_file” and
           instead yields expanded lines like “gcc -c -o myfile.o myfile.c -Ia -DXYZ”.

           Ninja's compdb tool added the <b>-x</b> flag in Ninja V1.9.0

       <b>NINJA_DEPFILE_PARSE_FORMAT</b>
           Determines the type of format ninja should expect when parsing header include depfiles. Can be <b>msvc</b>,
           <b>gcc</b>, or <b>clang</b>. The <b>msvc</b> option corresponds to <b>/showIncludes</b> format, and <b>gcc</b> or <b>clang</b> correspond to
           <b>-MMD</b> <b>-MF</b>.

       <b>NINJA_DIR</b>
           The <u>builddir</u> value. Propagates directly into the generated ninja build file. From Ninja's docs: “ A
           directory for some Ninja output files. ... (You can also store other build output in this directory.)
           ” The default value is .ninja.

       <b>NINJA_DISABLE_AUTO_RUN</b>
           Boolean. Default: <b>False</b>. If true, SCons will not run ninja automatically after creating the ninja
           build file.

           If not explicitly set, this will be set to <b>True</b> if <b>--disable_execute_ninja</b> or
           SetOption('disable_execute_ninja', True) is seen.

       <b>NINJA_ENV_VAR_CACHE</b>
           A string that sets the environment for any environment variables that differ between the OS
           environment and the SCons execution environment.

           It will be compatible with the default shell of the operating system.

           If not explicitly set, SCons will generate this dynamically from the execution environment stored in
           the current construction environment (e.g.  env['ENV']) where those values differ from the existing
           shell..

       <b>NINJA_FILE_NAME</b>
           The filename for the generated Ninja build file. The default is ninja.build.

       <b>NINJA_FORCE_SCONS_BUILD</b>
           If true, causes the build nodes to callback to scons instead of using ninja to build them. This is
           intended to be passed to the environment on the builder invocation. It is useful if you have a build
           node which does something which is not easily translated into ninja.

       <b>NINJA_GENERATED_SOURCE_ALIAS_NAME</b>
           A string matching the name of a user defined alias which represents a list of all generated sources.
           This will prevent the auto-detection of generated sources from <b>$NINJA_GENERATED_SOURCE_SUFFIXES</b>. Then
           all other source files will be made to depend on this in the ninja build file, forcing the generated
           sources to be built first.

       <b>NINJA_GENERATED_SOURCE_SUFFIXES</b>
           The list of source file suffixes which are generated by SCons build steps. All source files which
           match these suffixes will be added to the _generated_sources alias in the output ninja build file.
           Then all other source files will be made to depend on this in the ninja build file, forcing the
           generated sources to be built first.

       <b>NINJA_MSVC_DEPS_PREFIX</b>
           The <u>msvc_deps_prefix</u> string. Propagates directly into the generated ninja build file. From Ninja's
           docs: “defines the string which should be stripped from msvc's <b>/showIncludes</b> output”

       <b>NINJA_POOL</b>
           Set the <u>ninja_pool</u> for this or all targets in scope for this env var.

       <b>NINJA_REGENERATE_DEPS</b>
           A generator function used to create a ninja depfile which includes all the files which would require
           SCons to be invoked if they change. Or a list of said files.

       <b>_NINJA_REGENERATE_DEPS_FUNC</b>
           Internal value used to specify the function to call with argument env to generate the list of files
           which if changed would require the ninja build file to be regenerated.

       <b>NINJA_SCONS_DAEMON_KEEP_ALIVE</b>
           The number of seconds for the SCons deamon launched by ninja to stay alive. (Default: 180000)

       <b>NINJA_SCONS_DAEMON_PORT</b>
           The TCP/IP port for the SCons daemon to listen on.  <u>NOTE:</u> <u>You</u> <u>cannot</u> <u>use</u> <u>a</u> <u>port</u> <u>already</u> <u>being</u>
           <u>listened</u> <u>to</u> <u>on</u> <u>your</u> <u>build</u> <u>machine.</u>  (Default: random number between 10000,60000)

       <b>NINJA_SYNTAX</b>
           The path to a custom ninja_syntax.py file which is used in generation. The tool currently assumes you
           have ninja installed as a Python module and grabs the syntax file from that installation if
           <b>$NINJA_SYNTAX</b> is not explicitly set.

       <b>no_import_lib</b>
           When set to non-zero, suppresses creation of a corresponding Windows static import lib by the
           <b>SharedLibrary</b> builder when used with MinGW, Microsoft Visual Studio or Metrowerks. This also
           suppresses creation of an export (.exp) file when using Microsoft Visual Studio.

       <b>OBJPREFIX</b>
           The prefix used for (static) object file names.

       <b>OBJSUFFIX</b>
           The suffix used for (static) object file names.

       <b>PACKAGEROOT</b>
           Specifies the directory where all files in resulting archive will be placed if applicable. The
           default value is “<b>$NAME</b>-<b>$VERSION</b>”.

           See the <b>Package</b> builder.

       <b>PACKAGETYPE</b>
           Selects the package type to build when using the <b>Package</b> builder. May be a string or list of strings.
           See the docuentation for the builder for the currently supported types.

           <b>$PACKAGETYPE</b> may be overridden with the <b>--package-type</b> command line option.

           See the <b>Package</b> builder.

       <b>PACKAGEVERSION</b>
           The version of the package (not the underlying project). This is currently only used by the rpm
           packager and should reflect changes in the packaging, not the underlying project code itself.

           See the <b>Package</b> builder.

       <b>PCH</b>
           The Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled header that will be used when compiling object files. This
           variable is ignored by tools other than Microsoft Visual C++. When this variable is defined SCons
           will add options to the compiler command line to cause it to use the precompiled header, and will
           also set up the dependencies for the PCH file. Example:

               env['PCH'] = File('StdAfx.pch')

       <b>PCHCOM</b>
           The command line used by the <b>PCH</b> builder to generated a precompiled header.

       <b>PCHCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when generating a precompiled header. If this is not set, then <b>$PCHCOM</b> (the
           command line) is displayed.

       <b>PCHPDBFLAGS</b>
           A construction variable that, when expanded, adds the <b>/yD</b> flag to the command line only if the <b>$PDB</b>
           construction variable is set.

       <b>PCHSTOP</b>
           This variable specifies how much of a source file is precompiled. This variable is ignored by tools
           other than Microsoft Visual C++, or when the PCH variable is not being used. When this variable is
           define it must be a string that is the name of the header that is included at the end of the
           precompiled portion of the source files, or the empty string if the "#pragma hrdstop" construct is
           being used:

               env['PCHSTOP'] = 'StdAfx.h'

       <b>PDB</b>
           The Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file that will store debugging information for object files, shared
           libraries, and programs. This variable is ignored by tools other than Microsoft Visual C++. When this
           variable is defined SCons will add options to the compiler and linker command line to cause them to
           generate external debugging information, and will also set up the dependencies for the PDB file.
           Example:

               env['PDB'] = 'hello.pdb'

           The Visual C++ compiler switch that SCons uses by default to generate PDB information is <b>/Z7</b>. This
           works correctly with parallel (<b>-j</b>) builds because it embeds the debug information in the intermediate
           object files, as opposed to sharing a single PDB file between multiple object files. This is also the
           only way to get debug information embedded into a static library. Using the <b>/Zi</b> instead may yield
           improved link-time performance, although parallel builds will no longer work. You can generate PDB
           files with the <b>/Zi</b> switch by overriding the default <b>$CCPDBFLAGS</b> variable; see the entry for that
           variable for specific examples.

       <b>PDFLATEX</b>
           The pdflatex utility.

       <b>PDFLATEXCOM</b>
           The command line used to call the pdflatex utility.

       <b>PDFLATEXCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when calling the pdflatex utility. If this is not set, then <b>$PDFLATEXCOM</b> (the
           command line) is displayed.

               env = Environment(PDFLATEX;COMSTR = "Building $TARGET from LaTeX input $SOURCES")

       <b>PDFLATEXFLAGS</b>
           General options passed to the pdflatex utility.

           The pdftex utility.

       <b>PDFTEXCOM</b>
           The command line used to call the pdftex utility.

       <b>PDFTEXCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when calling the pdftex utility. If this is not set, then <b>$PDFTEXCOM</b> (the
           command line) is displayed.

               env = Environment(PDFTEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from TeX input $SOURCES")

       <b>PDFTEXFLAGS</b>
           General options passed to the pdftex utility.

       <b>PKGCHK</b>
           On Solaris systems, the package-checking program that will be used (along with <b>$PKGINFO</b>) to look for
           installed versions of the Sun PRO C++ compiler. The default is /usr/sbin/pgkchk.

       <b>PKGINFO</b>
           On Solaris systems, the package information program that will be used (along with <b>$PKGCHK</b>) to look
           for installed versions of the Sun PRO C++ compiler. The default is pkginfo.

       <b>PLATFORM</b>
           The name of the platform used to create this construction environment.  SCons sets this when
           initializing the platform, which by default is auto-detected (see the <u>platform</u> argument to
           <b>Environment</b>).

               env = Environment(tools=[])
               if env['PLATFORM'] == 'cygwin':
                   Tool('mingw')(env)
               else:
                   Tool('msvc')(env)

       <b>POAUTOINIT</b>
           The <b>$POAUTOINIT</b> variable, if set to True (on non-zero numeric value), let the msginit tool to
           automatically initialize <u>missing</u> PO files with <b><a href="../man1/msginit.1.html">msginit</a>(1)</b>. This applies to both, <b>POInit</b> and <b>POUpdate</b>
           builders (and others that use any of them).

       <b>POCREATE_ALIAS</b>
           Common alias for all PO files created with <b>POInit</b> builder (default: 'po-create'). See msginit tool
           and <b>POInit</b> builder.

       <b>POSUFFIX</b>
           Suffix used for PO files (default: '.po') See msginit tool and <b>POInit</b> builder.

       <b>POTDOMAIN</b>
           The <b>$POTDOMAIN</b> defines default domain, used to generate POT filename as <b>$POTDOMAIN</b>.pot when no POT
           file name is provided by the user. This applies to <b>POTUpdate</b>, <b>POInit</b> and <b>POUpdate</b> builders (and
           builders, that use them, e.g.  <b>Translate</b>). Normally (if <b>$POTDOMAIN</b> is not defined), the builders use
           messages.pot as default POT file name.

       <b>POTSUFFIX</b>
           Suffix used for PO Template files (default: '.pot'). See xgettext tool and <b>POTUpdate</b> builder.

       <b>POTUPDATE_ALIAS</b>
           Name of the common phony target for all PO Templates created with <b>POUpdate</b> (default: 'pot-update').
           See xgettext tool and <b>POTUpdate</b> builder.

       <b>POUPDATE_ALIAS</b>
           Common alias for all PO files being defined with <b>POUpdate</b> builder (default: 'po-update'). See
           msgmerge tool and <b>POUpdate</b> builder.

       <b>PRINT_CMD_LINE_FUNC</b>
           A Python function used to print the command lines as they are executed (assuming command printing is
           not disabled by the <b>-q</b> or <b>-s</b> options or their equivalents). The function must accept four arguments:
           <u>s</u>, <u>target</u>, <u>source</u> and <u>env</u>.  <u>s</u> is a string showing the command being executed, <u>target</u>, is the target
           being built (file node, list, or string name(s)), <u>source</u>, is the source(s) used (file node, list, or
           string name(s)), and <u>env</u> is the environment being used.

           The function must do the printing itself. The default implementation, used if this variable is not
           set or is <b>None</b>, is to just print the string, as in:

               def print_cmd_line(s, target, source, env):
                   sys.stdout.write(s + "\n")

           Here is an example of a more interesting function:

               def print_cmd_line(s, target, source, env):
                   sys.stdout.write(
                       "Building %s -&gt; %s...\n"
                       % (
                           ' and '.join([str(x) for x in source]),
                           ' and '.join([str(x) for x in target]),
                       )
                   )

               env = Environment(PRINT_CMD_LINE_FUNC=print_cmd_line)
               env.Program('foo', ['foo.c', 'bar.c'])

           This prints:

               ...

       <b>SHELL_ENV_GENERATORS</b>
           A hook allowing the execution environment to be modified prior to the actual execution of a command
           line from an action via the spawner function defined by <b>$SPAWN</b>. Allows substitution based on targets
           and sources, as well as values from the construction environment, adding extra environment variables,
           etc.

           The value must be a list (or other iterable) of functions which each generate or alter the execution
           environment dictionary. The first function will be passed a copy of the initial execution environment
           (<b>$ENV</b> in the current construction environment); the dictionary returned by that function is passed to
           the next, until the iterable is exhausted and the result returned for use by the command spawner. The
           original execution environment is not modified.

           Each function provided in <b>$SHELL_ENV_GENERATORS</b> must accept four arguments and return a dictionary:
           <u>env</u> is the construction environment for this action; <u>target</u> is the list of targets associated with
           this action; <u>source</u> is the list of sources associated with this action; and <u>shell_env</u> is the current
           dictionary after iterating any previous <b>$SHELL_ENV_GENERATORS</b> functions (this can be compared to the
           original execution environment, which is available as env['ENV'], to detect any changes).

           Example:

               def custom_shell_env(env, target, source, shell_env):
                   """customize shell_env if desired"""
                   if str(target[0]) == 'special_target':
                       shell_env['SPECIAL_VAR'] = env.subst('SOME_VAR', target=target, source=source)
                   return shell_env

               env["SHELL_ENV_GENERATORS"] = [custom_shell_env]

       <b>SHLIBNOVERSIONSYMLINKS</b>
           Instructs the <b>SharedLibrary</b> builder to not create symlinks for versioned shared libraries.

       <b>SHLIBPREFIX</b>
           The prefix used for shared library file names.

       <b>_SHLIBSONAME</b>
           A macro that automatically generates shared library's SONAME based on $TARGET, $SHLIBVERSION and
           $SHLIBSUFFIX. Used by <b>SharedLibrary</b> builder when the linker tool supports SONAME (e.g.  gnulink).

       <b>SHLIBSUFFIX</b>
           The suffix used for shared library file names.

       <b>SHLIBVERSION</b>
           When this construction variable is defined, a versioned shared library is created by the
           <b>SharedLibrary</b> builder. This activates the <b>$_SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS</b> and thus modifies the <b>$SHLINKCOM</b> as
           required, adds the version number to the library name, and creates the symlinks that are needed.
           <b>$SHLIBVERSION</b> versions should exist as alpha-numeric, decimal-delimited values as defined by the
           regular expression "\w+[\.\w+]*". Example <b>$SHLIBVERSION</b> values include '1', '1.2.3', and
           '1.2.gitaa412c8b'.

       <b>_SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS</b>
           This macro automatically introduces extra flags to <b>$SHLINKCOM</b> when building versioned <b>SharedLibrary</b>
           (that is when <b>$SHLIBVERSION</b> is set).  _SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS usually adds <b>$SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS</b> and some
           extra dynamically generated options (such as -Wl,-soname=$_SHLIBSONAME. It is unused by "plain"
           (unversioned) shared libraries.

       <b>SHLIBVERSIONFLAGS</b>
           Extra flags added to <b>$SHLINKCOM</b> when building versioned <b>SharedLibrary</b>. These flags are only used when
           <b>$SHLIBVERSION</b> is set.

       <b>SHLINK</b>
           The linker for programs that use shared libraries. See also <b>$LINK</b> for linking static objects.

           On POSIX systems (those using the link tool), you should normally not change this value as it
           defaults to a "smart" linker tool which selects a compiler driver matching the type of source files
           in use. So for example, if you set <b>$SHCXX</b> to a specific compiler name, and are compiling C++ sources,
           the smartlink function will automatically select the same compiler for linking.

       <b>SHLINKCOM</b>
           The command line used to link programs using shared libraries. See also <b>$LINKCOM</b> for linking static
           objects.

       <b>SHLINKCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when programs using shared libraries are linked. If this is not set, then
           <b>$SHLINKCOM</b> (the command line) is displayed. See also <b>$LINKCOMSTR</b> for linking static objects.

               env = Environment(SHLINKCOMSTR = "Linking shared $TARGET")

       <b>SHLINKFLAGS</b>
           General user options passed to the linker for programs using shared libraries. Note that this
           variable should <u>not</u> contain <b>-l</b> (or similar) options for linking with the libraries listed in <b>$LIBS</b>,
           nor <b>-L</b> (or similar) include search path options that scons generates automatically from <b>$LIBPATH</b>. See
           <b>$_LIBFLAGS</b> above, for the variable that expands to library-link options, and <b>$_LIBDIRFLAGS</b> above, for
           the variable that expands to library search path options. See also <b>$LINKFLAGS</b> for linking static
           objects.

       <b>SHOBJPREFIX</b>
           The prefix used for shared object file names.

       <b>SHOBJSUFFIX</b>
           The suffix used for shared object file names.

       <b>SONAME</b>
           Variable used to hard-code SONAME for versioned shared library/loadable module.

               env.SharedLibrary('test', 'test.c', SHLIBVERSION='0.1.2', SONAME='libtest.so.2')

           The variable is used, for example, by gnulink linker tool.

       <b>SOURCE</b>
           A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a construction environment. (See the manpage
           section "Variable Substitution" for more information).

       <b>SOURCE_URL</b>
           The URL (web address) of the location from which the project was retrieved. This is used to fill in
           the Source: field in the controlling information for Ipkg and RPM packages.

           See the <b>Package</b> builder.

       <b>SOURCES</b>
           A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a construction environment. (See the manpage
           section "Variable Substitution" for more information).

       <b>SOVERSION</b>
           This will construct the <u>SONAME</u> using on the base library name (<u>test</u> in the example below) and use
           specified <u>SOVERSION</u> to create <u>SONAME</u>.

               env.SharedLibrary('test', 'test.c', SHLIBVERSION='0.1.2', SOVERSION='2')

           The variable is used, for example, by gnulink linker tool.

           In the example above <u>SONAME</u> would be libtest.so.2 which would be a symlink and point to
           libtest.so.0.1.2

       <b>SPAWN</b>
           A command interpreter function that will be called to execute command line strings. The function must
           accept five arguments:

               def spawn(shell, escape, cmd, args, env):

           <u>shell</u> is a string naming the shell program to use, <u>escape</u> is a function that can be called to escape
           shell special characters in the command line, <u>cmd</u> is the path to the command to be executed, <u>args</u>
           holds the arguments to the command and <u>env</u> is a dictionary of environment variables defining the
           execution environment in which the command should be executed.

       <b>STATIC_AND_SHARED_OBJECTS_ARE_THE_SAME</b>
           When this variable is true, static objects and shared objects are assumed to be the same; that is,
           SCons does not check for linking static objects into a shared library.

       <b>SUBST_DICT</b>
           The dictionary used by the <b>Substfile</b> or <b>Textfile</b> builders for substitution values. It can be anything
           acceptable to the <b>dict()</b> constructor, so in addition to a dictionary, lists of tuples are also
           acceptable.

       <b>SUBSTFILEPREFIX</b>
           The prefix used for <b>Substfile</b> file names, an empty string by default.

       <b>SUBSTFILESUFFIX</b>
           The suffix used for <b>Substfile</b> file names, an empty string by default.

       <b>SUMMARY</b>

       <b>SWIG</b>
           The name of the SWIG compiler to use.

       <b>SWIGCFILESUFFIX</b>
           The suffix that will be used for intermediate C source files generated by SWIG. The default value is
           '_wrap$CFILESUFFIX' - that is, the concatenation of the string _wrap and the current C suffix
           <b>$CFILESUFFIX</b>. By default, this value is used whenever the <b>-c++</b> option is <u>not</u> specified as part of the
           <b>$SWIGFLAGS</b> construction variable.

       <b>SWIGCOM</b>
           The command line used to call SWIG.

       <b>SWIGCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when calling SWIG. If this is not set, then <b>$SWIGCOM</b> (the command line) is
           displayed.

       <b>SWIGCXXFILESUFFIX</b>
           The suffix that will be used for intermediate C++ source files generated by SWIG. The default value
           is '_wrap$CXXFILESUFFIX' - that is, the concatenation of the string _wrap and the current C++ suffix
           <b>$CXXFILESUFFIX</b>. By default, this value is used whenever the <b>-c++</b> option is specified as part of the
           <b>$SWIGFLAGS</b> construction variable.

       <b>SWIGDIRECTORSUFFIX</b>
           The suffix that will be used for intermediate C++ header files generated by SWIG. These are only
           generated for C++ code when the SWIG 'directors' feature is turned on. The default value is _wrap.h.

       <b>SWIGFLAGS</b>
           General options passed to SWIG. This is where you should set the target language (<b>-python</b>, <b>-perl5</b>,
           <b>-tcl</b>, etc.) and whatever other options you want to specify to SWIG, such as the <b>-c++</b> to generate C++
           code instead of C Code.

       <b>_SWIGINCFLAGS</b>
           An automatically-generated construction variable containing the SWIG command-line options for
           specifying directories to be searched for included files. The value of <b>$_SWIGINCFLAGS</b> is created by
           respectively prepending and appending <b>$SWIGINCPREFIX</b> and <b>$SWIGINCSUFFIX</b> to the beginning and end of
           each directory in <b>$SWIGPATH</b>.

       <b>SWIGINCPREFIX</b>
           The prefix used to specify an include directory on the SWIG command line. This will be prepended to
           the beginning of each directory in the <b>$SWIGPATH</b> construction variable when the <b>$_SWIGINCFLAGS</b>
           variable is automatically generated.

       <b>SWIGINCSUFFIX</b>
           The suffix used to specify an include directory on the SWIG command line. This will be appended to
           the end of each directory in the <b>$SWIGPATH</b> construction variable when the <b>$_SWIGINCFLAGS</b> variable is
           automatically generated.

       <b>SWIGOUTDIR</b>
           Specifies the output directory in which SWIG should place generated language-specific files. This
           will be used by SCons to identify the files that will be generated by the SWIG call, and translated
           into the swig -outdir option on the command line.

       <b>SWIGPATH</b>
           The list of directories that SWIG will search for included files.  SCons' SWIG implicit dependency
           scanner will search these directories for include files. The default value is an empty list.

           Don't explicitly put include directory arguments in <b>$SWIGFLAGS</b> the result will be non-portable and
           the directories will not be searched by the dependency scanner. Note: directory names in <b>$SWIGPATH</b>
           will be looked-up relative to the SConscript directory when they are used in a command. To force
           <b>scons</b> to look-up a directory relative to the root of the source tree use a top-relative path (#):

               env = Environment(SWIGPATH='#/include')

           The directory look-up can also be forced using the <b>Dir</b>() function:

               include = Dir('include')
               env = Environment(SWIGPATH=include)

           The directory list will be added to command lines through the automatically-generated <b>$_SWIGINCFLAGS</b>
           construction variable, which is constructed by respectively prepending and appending the values of
           the <b>$SWIGINCPREFIX</b> and <b>$SWIGINCSUFFIX</b> construction variables to the beginning and end of each
           directory in <b>$SWIGPATH</b>. Any command lines you define that need the SWIGPATH directory list should
           include <b>$_SWIGINCFLAGS</b>:

               env = Environment(SWIGCOM="my_swig -o $TARGET $_SWIGINCFLAGS $SOURCES")

       <b>SWIGVERSION</b>
           The detected version string of the SWIG tool.

       <b>TAR</b>
           The tar archiver.

       <b>TARCOM</b>
           The command line used to call the tar archiver.

       <b>TARCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when archiving files using the tar archiver. If this is not set, then <b>$TARCOM</b>
           (the command line) is displayed.

               env = Environment(TARCOMSTR = "Archiving $TARGET")

       <b>TARFLAGS</b>
           General options passed to the tar archiver.

       <b>TARGET</b>
           A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a construction environment. (See the manpage
           section "Variable Substitution" for more information).

       <b>TARGET_ARCH</b>
           The name of the hardware architecture that objects created using this construction environment should
           target. Can be set when creating a construction environment by passing as a keyword argument in the
           <b>Environment</b> call.

           On the win32 platform, if the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler is available, msvc tool setup is done
           using <b>$HOST_ARCH</b> and <b>$TARGET_ARCH</b>. If a value is not specified, will be set to the same value as
           <b>$HOST_ARCH</b>. Changing the value after the environment is initialized will not cause the tool to be
           reinitialized. Compiled objects will be in the target architecture if the compilation system supports
           generating for that target. The latest compiler which can fulfill the requirement will be selected,
           unless a different version is directed by the value of the <b>$MSVC_VERSION</b> construction variable.

           On the win32/msvc combination, valid target arch values are x86, arm, i386 for 32-bit targets and
           amd64, arm64, x86_64 and ia64 (Itanium) for 64-bit targets. For example, if you want to compile
           64-bit binaries, you would set TARGET_ARCH='x86_64' when creating the construction environment. Note
           that not all target architectures are supported for all Visual Studio / MSVC versions. Check the
           relevant Microsoft documentation.

           <b>$TARGET_ARCH</b> is not currently used by other compilation tools, but the option is reserved to do so in
           future

       <b>TARGET_OS</b>
           The name of the operating system that objects created using this construction environment should
           target. Can be set when creating a construction environment by passing as a keyword argument in the
           <b>Environment</b> call;.

           <b>$TARGET_OS</b> is not currently used by SCons but the option is reserved to do so in future

       <b>TARGETS</b>
           A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a construction environment. (See the manpage
           section "Variable Substitution" for more information).

       <b>TARSUFFIX</b>
           The suffix used for tar file names.

       <b>TEMPFILE</b>
           A callable object used to handle overly long command line strings, since operations which call out to
           a shell will fail if the line is longer than the shell can accept. This tends to particularly impact
           linking. The tempfile object stores the command line in a temporary file in the appropriate format,
           and returns an alternate command line so the invoked tool will make use of the contents of the
           temporary file. If you need to replace the default tempfile object, the callable should take into
           account the settings of <b>$MAXLINELENGTH</b>, <b>$TEMPFILEPREFIX</b>, <b>$TEMPFILESUFFIX</b>, <b>$TEMPFILEARGJOIN</b>,
           <b>$TEMPFILEDIR</b> and <b>$TEMPFILEARGESCFUNC</b>.

       <b>TEMPFILEARGESCFUNC</b>
           The default argument escape function is <b>SCons.Subst.quote_spaces</b>. If you need to apply extra
           operations on a command argument (to fix Windows slashes, normalize paths, etc.) before writing to
           the temporary file, you can set the <b>$TEMPFILEARGESCFUNC</b> variable to a custom function. Such a
           function takes a single string argument and returns a new string with any modifications applied.
           Example:

               import sys
               import re
               from SCons.Subst import quote_spaces

               WINPATHSEP_RE = re.compile(r"\\([^\"'\\]|$)")

               def tempfile_arg_esc_func(arg):
                   arg = quote_spaces(arg)
                   if sys.platform != "win32":
                       return arg
                   # GCC requires double Windows slashes, let's use UNIX separator
                   return WINPATHSEP_RE.sub(r"/\1", arg)

               env["TEMPFILEARGESCFUNC"] = tempfile_arg_esc_func

       <b>TEMPFILEARGJOIN</b>
           The string to use to join the arguments passed to <b>$TEMPFILE</b> when the command line exceeds the limit
           set by <b>$MAXLINELENGTH</b>. The default value is a space. However for MSVC, MSLINK the default is a line
           separator as defined by os.linesep. Note this value is used literally and not expanded by the subst
           logic.

       <b>TEMPFILEDIR</b>
           The directory to create the long-lines temporary file in.

       <b>TEMPFILEPREFIX</b>
           The prefix for the name of the temporary file used to store command lines exceeding <b>$MAXLINELENGTH</b>.
           The default prefix is '@', which works for the Microsoft and GNU toolchains on Windows. Set this
           appropriately for other toolchains, for example '-@' for the diab compiler or '-via' for ARM
           toolchain.

       <b>TEMPFILESUFFIX</b>
           The suffix for the name of the temporary file used to store command lines exceeding <b>$MAXLINELENGTH</b>.
           The suffix should include the dot ('.') if one is wanted as it will not be added automatically. The
           default is .lnk.

       <b>TEX</b>
           The TeX formatter and typesetter.

       <b>TEXCOM</b>
           The command line used to call the TeX formatter and typesetter.

       <b>TEXCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when calling the TeX formatter and typesetter. If this is not set, then <b>$TEXCOM</b>
           (the command line) is displayed.

               env = Environment(TEXCOMSTR = "Building $TARGET from TeX input $SOURCES")

       <b>TEXFLAGS</b>
           General options passed to the TeX formatter and typesetter.

       <b>TEXINPUTS</b>
           List of directories that the LaTeX program will search for include directories. The LaTeX implicit
           dependency scanner will search these directories for \include and \import files.

       <b>TEXTFILEPREFIX</b>
           The prefix used for <b>Textfile</b> file names, an empty string by default.

       <b>TEXTFILESUFFIX</b>
           The suffix used for <b>Textfile</b> file names; .txt by default.

       <b>TOOLS</b>
           A list of the names of the Tool specifications that are part of this construction environment.

       <b>UNCHANGED_SOURCES</b>
           A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a construction environment. (See the manpage
           section "Variable Substitution" for more information).

       <b>UNCHANGED_TARGETS</b>
           A reserved variable name that may not be set or used in a construction environment. (See the manpage
           section "Variable Substitution" for more information).

       <b>VENDOR</b>
           The person or organization who supply the packaged software. This is used to fill in the Vendor:
           field in the controlling information for RPM packages, and the Manufacturer: field in the controlling

       <b>VSWHERE</b>
           Specify the location of vswhere.exe.

           The vswhere.exe executable is distributed with Microsoft Visual Studio and Build Tools since the 2017
           edition, but is also available standalone. It provides full information about installations of 2017
           and later editions. With the <b>-legacy</b> argument, vswhere.exe can detect installations of the 2010
           through 2015 editions with limited data returned. If <b>VSWHERE</b> is set, SCons will use that location.

           Otherwise SCons will look in the following locations and set <b>VSWHERE</b> to the path of the first
           vswhere.exe located.

           •   %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer

           •   %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer

           •   %ChocolateyInstall%\bin

           Note that <b>VSWHERE</b> must be set at the same time or prior to any of msvc, msvs , and/or mslink <b>Tool</b>
           being initialized. Either set it as follows

               env = Environment(VSWHERE='c:/my/path/to/vswhere')

           or if your construction environment is created specifying an empty tools list (or a list of tools
           which omits all of default, msvs, msvc, and mslink), and also before <b>env.Tool</b> is called to
           ininitialize any of those tools:

                   env = Environment(tools=[])
                   env['VSWHERE'] = r'c:/my/vswhere/install/location/vswhere.exe'
                   env.Tool('msvc')
                   env.Tool('mslink')
                   env.Tool('msvs')

       <b>WINDOWS_EMBED_MANIFEST</b>

           executables and DLLs built with this environment, as a resource during their link step. This is done
           using <b>$MT</b> and <b>$MTEXECOM</b> and <b>$MTSHLIBCOM</b>. See also <b>$WINDOWS_INSERT_MANIFEST</b>.

       <b>WINDOWS_INSERT_DEF</b>
           If set to true, a library build of a Windows shared library (.dll file) will include a reference to
           the corresponding module-definition file at the same time, if a module-definition file is not already
           listed as a build target. The name of the module-definition file will be constructed from the base
           name of the library and the construction variables <b>$WINDOWSDEFSUFFIX</b> and <b>$WINDOWSDEFPREFIX</b>. The
           default is to not add a module-definition file. The module-definition file is not created by this
           directive, and must be supplied by the developer.

       <b>WINDOWS_INSERT_MANIFEST</b>
           If set to true, <b>scons</b> will add the manifest file generated by Microsoft Visual C++ 8.0 and later to
           the target list so SCons will be aware they were generated. In the case of an executable, the
           manifest file name is constructed using <b>$WINDOWSPROGMANIFESTSUFFIX</b> and <b>$WINDOWSPROGMANIFESTPREFIX</b>. In
           the case of a shared library, the manifest file name is constructed using <b>$WINDOWSSHLIBMANIFESTSUFFIX</b>
           and <b>$WINDOWSSHLIBMANIFESTPREFIX</b>. See also <b>$WINDOWS_EMBED_MANIFEST</b>.

           The string displayed when generating a source file using the parser generator. If this is not set,
           then <b>$YACCCOM</b> (the command line) is displayed.

               env = Environment(YACCCOMSTR="Yacc'ing $TARGET from $SOURCES")

       <b>YACCFLAGS</b>
           General options passed to the parser generator. In addition to passing the value on during
           invocation, the yacc tool also examines this construction variable for options which cause additional
           output files to be generated, and adds those to the target list.

           If a <b>-d</b> option is present, <b>scons</b> assumes that the call will also create a header file with the suffix
           defined by <b>$YACCHFILESUFFIX</b> if the yacc source file ends in a .y suffix, or a file with the suffix
           defined by <b>$YACCHXXFILESUFFIX</b> if the yacc source file ends in a .yy suffix.

           If a <b>-g</b> option is present, <b>scons</b> assumes that the call will also create a graph file with the suffix
           defined by <b>$YACCVCGFILESUFFIX</b>.

           If a <b>-v</b> option is present, <b>scons</b> assumes that the call will also create an output debug file with the
           suffix .output.

           Also recognized are GNU bison options <b>--header=</b> and its deprecated synonym <b>--defines=</b>, which is
           similar to <b>-d</b> but the output filename is named by the option argument; and <b>--graph=</b>, which is similar
           to <b>-g</b> but the output filename is named by the option argument.

           Note that files specified by <b>--header=</b> and <b>--graph=</b> may not be properly handled by SCons in all
           situations. Consider using <b>$YACC_HEADER_FILE</b> and <b>$YACC_GRAPH_FILE</b> instead.

       <b>YACCHFILESUFFIX</b>
           The suffix of the C header file generated by the parser generator when the <b>-d</b> option is used. Note
           that setting this variable does not cause the parser generator to generate a header file with the
           specified suffix, it exists to allow you to specify what suffix the parser generator will use of its
           own accord. The default value is .h.

       <b>YACCHXXFILESUFFIX</b>
           The suffix of the C++ header file generated by the parser generator when the <b>-d</b> option is used. Note
           that setting this variable does not cause the parser generator to generate a header file with the
           specified suffix, it exists to allow you to specify what suffix the parser generator will use of its
           own accord. The default value is .hpp, except on Mac OS X, where the default is ${TARGET.suffix}.h.
           because the default bison parser generator just appends .h to the name of the generated C++ file.

       <b>YACCVCGFILESUFFIX</b>
           The suffix of the file containing the VCG grammar automaton definition when the <b>--graph=</b> option is
           used. Note that setting this variable does not cause the parser generator to generate a VCG file with
           the specified suffix, it exists to allow you to specify what suffix the parser generator will use of
           its own accord. The default value is .vcg.

       <b>ZIP</b>
           The zip compression and file packaging utility.

       <b>ZIP_OVERRIDE_TIMESTAMP</b>
           An optional timestamp which overrides the last modification time of the file when stored inside the
           Zip archive. This is a tuple of six values: Year (&gt;= 1980) Month (one-based) Day of month (one-based)
           Hours (zero-based) Minutes (zero-based) Seconds (zero-based)

       <b>ZIPCOM</b>
           The command line used to call the zip utility, or the internal Python function used to create a zip
           archive.

       <b>ZIPCOMPRESSION</b>
           The <u>compression</u> flag from the Python zipfile module used by the internal Python function to control
           whether the zip archive is compressed or not. The default value is zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED, which
           creates a compressed zip archive. This value has no effect if the zipfile module is unavailable.

       <b>ZIPCOMSTR</b>
           The string displayed when archiving files using the zip utility. If this is not set, then <b>$ZIPCOM</b>
           (the command line or internal Python function) is displayed.

               env = Environment(ZIPCOMSTR = "Zipping $TARGET")

       <b>ZIPFLAGS</b>
           General options passed to the zip utility.

       <b>ZIPROOT</b>
           An optional zip root directory (default empty). The filenames stored in the zip file will be relative
           to this directory, if given. Otherwise the filenames are relative to the current directory of the
           command. For instance:

               env = Environment()
               env.Zip('foo.zip', 'subdir1/subdir2/file1', ZIPROOT='subdir1')

           will produce a zip file foo.zip containing a file with the name subdir2/file1 rather than
           subdir1/subdir2/file1.

       <b>ZIPSUFFIX</b>
           The suffix used for zip file names.

   <b>Configure</b> <b>Contexts</b>
       SCons supports a configure context, an integrated mechanism similar to the various <b>AC_CHECK</b> macros in GNU
       Autoconf for testing the existence of external items needed for the build, such as C header files,
       libraries, etc. The mechanism is portable across platforms.

       <b>scons</b> does not maintain an explicit cache of the tested values (this is different than Autoconf), but
       uses its normal dependency tracking to keep the checked values up to date. However, users may override
       this behaviour with the <b>--config</b> command line option.

       <b>Configure</b>(<u>env,</u> <u>[custom_tests,</u> <u>conf_dir,</u> <u>log_file,</u> <u>config_h,</u> <u>clean,</u> <u>help]</u>), <u>env</u>.Configure(<u>[custom_tests,</u>
       <u>conf_dir,</u> <u>log_file,</u> <u>config_h,</u> <u>clean,</u> <u>help]</u>)
           Create a configure context, which tracks information discovered while running tests. The context
           includes a local construction environment (available as <u>context</u>.<u>env</u>) which is used when running the
           tests and which can be updated with the check results. Only one context may be active at a time, but
           a new context can be created after the active one is completed. For the global function form, the
           required <u>env</u> describes the initial values for the context's local construction environment; for the
           construction environment method form the instance provides the values.

           <u>Changed</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.0</u>: raises an exception on an attempt to create a new context when there is an
           active context.

           <u>custom_tests</u> specifies a dictionary containing custom tests (see the section on custom tests below).
           The default value is <b>None</b>, meaning no custom tests are added to the configure context.

           <u>conf_dir</u> specifies a directory where the test cases are built. This directory is not used for
           building normal targets. The default value is “#/.sconf_temp”.

           <u>log_file</u> specifies a file which collects the output from commands that are executed to check for the
           existence of header files, libraries, etc. The default is “#/config.log”. If you are using variant
           directories, you may want to place the log file for a given build under that build's variant
           directory.

           <u>config_h</u> specifies a C header file where the results of tests will be written. The results will
           consist of lines like #define HAVE_STDIO_H, #define HAVE_LIBM, etc. Customarily, the name chosen is
           “config.h”. The default is to not write a <u>config_h</u> file. You can specify the same <u>config_h</u> file in
           multiple calls to <b>Configure</b>, in which case SCons will concatenate all results in the specified file.
           Note that SCons uses its normal dependency checking to decide if it's necessary to rebuild the
           specified <u>config_h</u> file. This means that the file is not necessarily re-built each time scons is run,
           but is only rebuilt if its contents will have changed and some target that depends on the <u>config_h</u>
           file is being built.

           The <u>clean</u> and <u>help</u> arguments can be used to suppress execution of the configuration tests when the
           <b>-c</b>/<b>--clean</b> or <b>-H</b>/<b>-h</b>/<b>--help</b> options are used, respectively. The default behavior is always to execute
           configure context tests, since the results of the tests may affect the list of targets to be cleaned
           or the help text. If the configure tests do not affect these, then you may add the <b>clean=False</b> or
           <b>help=False</b> arguments (or both) to avoid unnecessary test execution.

       <u>context</u>.Finish()
           This method must be called after configuration is done. Though required, this is not enforced except
           if <b>Configure</b> is called again while there is still an active context, in which case an exception is
           raised.  <b>Finish</b> returns the environment as modified during the course of running the configuration
           checks. After this method is called, no further checks can be performed with this configuration
           context. However, you can create a new configure context to perform additional checks.

       Example of a typical Configure usage:

           env = Environment()
           conf = Configure(env)
           if not conf.CheckCHeader("math.h"):
               print("We really need math.h!")
               <a href="../man1/Exit.1.html">Exit</a>(1)
           if conf.CheckLibWithHeader("qt", "qapp.h", "c++", "QApplication qapp(0,0);"):
               # do stuff for qt - usage, e.g.
               conf.env.Append(CPPDEFINES="WITH_QT")
           env = conf.Finish()

       A configure context has the following predefined methods which can be used to perform checks. Where
       <u>language</u> is an optional parameter, it specifies the compiler to use for the check, currently a choice of
       C or C++. The spellings accepted for C are “C” or “c”; for C++ the value can be “CXX”, “cxx”, “C++” or
       “c++”. If <u>language</u> is omitted, “C” is assumed.

       <u>context</u>.CheckHeader(<u>header,</u> <u>[include_quotes,</u> <u>language]</u>)
           Checks if <u>header</u> is usable in the specified <u>language</u>.  <u>header</u> may be a list, in which case the last
           item in the list is the header file to be checked, and the previous list items are header files whose
           #include lines should precede the header line being checked for. The optional argument <u>include_quotes</u>
           must be a two character string, where the first character denotes the opening quote and the second
           character denotes the closing quote. By default, both characters are <b>"</b> (double quote).

           Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

       <u>context</u>.CheckCHeader(<u>header,</u> <u>[include_quotes]</u>)
           Checks if <u>header</u> is usable when compiling a C language program.  <u>header</u> may be a list, in which case
           the last item in the list is the header file to be checked, and the previous list items are header
           files whose #include lines should precede the header line being checked for. The optional argument
           <u>include_quotes</u> must be a two character string, where the first character denotes the opening quote
           and the second character denotes the closing quote. By default, both characters are <b>"</b> (double quote).
           Note this is a wrapper around <b>CheckHeader</b>. Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

       <u>context</u>.CheckCXXHeader(<u>header,</u> <u>[include_quotes]</u>)
           Checks if <u>header</u> is usable when compiling a C++ language program.  <u>header</u> may be a list, in which
           case the last item in the list is the header file to be checked, and the previous list items are
           header files whose #include lines should precede the header line being checked for. The optional
           argument <u>include_quotes</u> must be a two character string, where the first character denotes the opening
           quote and the second character denotes the closing quote. By default, both characters are <b>"</b> (double
           quote). Note this is a wrapper around <b>CheckHeader</b>. Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

       <u>context</u>.CheckFunc(<u>function_name,</u> <u>[header,</u> <u>language]</u>)
           Checks if <u>function_name</u> is usable in the context's local environment, using the compiler specified by
           <u>language</u> - that is, can a check referencing it be compiled using the current values of <b>$CFLAGS</b>,
           <b>$CPPFLAGS</b>, <b>$LIBS</b> or other relevant construction variables.

           The optional <u>header</u> argument is a string representing a code fragment to place at the top of the test
           program that will be compiled to check if the function exists. If omitted, the default stanza will be
           (with <u>function_name</u> appropriately substituted):

               #ifdef __cplusplus
               extern "C"
               #endif
               char function_name(void);

           Note: if <u>header</u> is supplied, it should <u>not</u> include the standard header file that declares
           <u>function_name</u>, and it <u>should</u> include a dummy prototype similar to the default case. Compilers reject
           builds where a function call does not match the declared prototype as happens if the "real" header is
           included, and modern compilers are now rejecting implicit function declarations.

           Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

       <u>context</u>.CheckLib(<u>[library,</u> <u>symbol,</u> <u>header,</u> <u>language,</u> <u>autoadd=True,</u> <u>append=True,</u> <u>unique=False]</u>)
           Checks if <u>library</u> provides <u>symbol</u> by compiling a simple stub program with the compiler selected by
           <u>language</u>, and optionally adds that library to the context. If supplied, the text of <u>header</u> is
           included at the top of the stub. If <u>autoadd</u> is true (the default), and the library provides the
           specified <u>symbol</u> (as defined by successfully linking the stub program), it is added to the <b>$LIBS</b>
           construction variable in the context. if <u>append</u> is true (the default), the library is appended,
           otherwise it is prepended. If <u>unique</u> is true, and the library would otherwise be added but is already
           present in <b>$LIBS</b> in the configure context, it will not be added again. The default is False.

           <u>library</u> can be a list of library names, or <b>None</b> (the default if the argument is omitted). If the
           former, <u>symbol</u> is checked against each library name in order, returning (and reporting success) on
           the first successful test; if the latter, it is checked with the current value of <b>$LIBS</b> (in this case
           no library name would be added). If <u>symbol</u> is omitted or <b>None</b>, then <b>CheckLib</b> just checks if you can
           link against the specified <u>library</u>, Note though it is legal syntax, it would not be very useful to
           call this method with <u>library</u> and <u>symbol</u> both omitted or <b>None</b> - at least one should be supplied.

           Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

           <u>Changed</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.5.0:</u> <u>added</u> <u>the</u> <u>append</u> <u>and</u> <u>unique</u> <u>parameters.</u>

       <u>context</u>.CheckLibWithHeader(<u>library,</u> <u>header,</u> <u>[language,</u> <u>call,</u> <u>autoadd=True,</u> <u>append=True,</u> <u>unique=False]</u>)
           Provides an alternative to the CheckLib method for checking for libraries usable in a build.  <u>library</u>
           specifies a library or list of libraries to check.  <u>header</u> specifies a header to include in the test
           program, and <u>language</u> indicates the compiler to use.  <u>header</u> may be a list, in which case the last
           item in the list is the header file to be checked, and the previous list items are header files whose
           #include lines should precede the header line being checked for. A code fragment (must be a a valid
           expression, including a trailing semicolon) to serve as the test can be supplied in <u>call</u>; if not
           supplied, the default checks the ability to link against the specified <u>library</u>. If <u>autoadd</u> is true
           (the default), the first library that passes the check is added to the <b>$LIBS</b> construction variable in
           the context and the method returns. If <u>append</u> is true (the default), the library is appended,
           otherwise prepended. If <u>unique</u> is true, and the library would otherwise be added but is already
           present in <b>$LIBS</b> in the configure context, it will not be added again. The default is False.

           Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

           <u>Changed</u> <u>in</u> <u>version</u> <u>4.5.0:</u> <u>added</u> <u>the</u> <u>append</u> <u>and</u> <u>unique</u> <u>parameters.</u>

       <u>context</u>.CheckType(<u>type_name,</u> <u>[includes,</u> <u>language]</u>)
           Checks for the existence of a type defined by typedef.  <u>type_name</u> specifies the typedef name to check
           for.  <u>includes</u> is a string containing one or more #include lines that will be inserted into the
           program that will be run to test for the existence of the type. Example:

               sconf.CheckType('foo_type', '#include "my_types.h"', 'C++')

           Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

       <u>context</u>.CheckTypeSize(<u>type_name,</u> <u>[header,</u> <u>language,</u> <u>expect]</u>)
           Checks for the size of a type defined by typedef.  <u>type_name</u> specifies the typedef name to check for.
           The optional <u>header</u> argument is a string that will be placed at the top of the test file that will be
           compiled to check if the type exists; the default is empty. If the optional <u>expect</u>, is supplied, it
           should be an integer size; <b>CheckTypeSize</b> will fail unless <u>type_name</u> is actually that size. Returns
           the size in bytes, or zero if the type was not found (or if the size did not match optional <u>expect</u>).

           For example,

               CheckTypeSize('short', expect=2)

           will return the size 2 only if short is actually two bytes.

       <u>context</u>.CheckCC()
           Checks whether the C compiler (as defined by the <b>$CC</b> construction variable) works, by trying to
           compile a small source file. This provides a more rigorous check: by default, SCons itself only
           detects if there is a program with the correct name, not if it is a functioning compiler. Returns a
           boolean indicating success or failure.

           The test program will be built with the same command line as the one used by the <b>Object</b> builder for C
           source files, so by setting relevant construction variables it can be used to detect if particular
           compiler flags will be accepted or rejected by the compiler.

           Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

       <u>context</u>.CheckCXX()
           Checks whether the C++ compiler (as defined by the <b>$CXX</b> construction variable) works, by trying to
           compile a small source file. This provides a more rigorous check: by default, SCons itself only
           detects if there is a program with the correct name, not if it is a functioning compiler. Returns a
           boolean indicating success or failure.

           The test program will be built with the same command line as the one used by the <b>Object</b> builder for
           C++ source files, so by setting relevant construction variables it can be used to detect if
           particular compiler flags will be accepted or rejected by the compiler.

           Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

       <u>context</u>.CheckSHCC()
           Checks whether the shared-object C compiler (as defined by the <b>$SHCC</b> construction variable) works by
           trying to compile a small source file. This provides a more rigorous check: by default, SCons itself
           only detects if there is a program with the correct name, not if it is a functioning compiler.
           Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

           The test program will be built with the same command line as the one used by the <b>SharedObject</b> builder
           for C source files, so by setting relevant construction variables it can be used to detect if
           particular compiler flags will be accepted or rejected by the compiler. Note this does not check
           whether a shared library/dll can be created.

           Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

       <u>context</u>.CheckSHCXX()
           Checks whether the shared-object C++ compiler (as defined by the <b>$SHCXX</b> construction variable) works
           by trying to compile a small source file. This provides a more rigorous check: by default, SCons
           itself only detects if there is a program with the correct name, not if it is a functioning compiler.
           Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

           The test program will be built with the same command line as the one used by the <b>SharedObject</b> builder
           for C++ source files, so by setting relevant construction variables it can be used to detect if
           particular compiler flags will be accepted or rejected by the compiler. Note this does not check
           whether a shared library/dll can be created.

           Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

       <u>context</u>.CheckProg(<u>prog_name</u>)
           Checks if <u>prog_name</u> exists in the path SCons will use at build time. (<u>context</u>.<u>env['ENV']['PATH']</u>).
           Returns a string containing the path to the program, or <b>None</b> on failure.

       <u>context</u>.CheckDeclaration(<u>symbol,</u> <u>[includes,</u> <u>language]</u>)
           Checks if the specified <u>symbol</u> is declared.  <u>includes</u> is a string containing one or more #include
           lines that will be inserted into the program that will be run to test for the existence of the
           symbol.

           Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

       <u>context</u>.CheckMember(<u>aggregate_member,</u> <u>[header,</u> <u>language]</u>)
           Checks for the existence of a member of the C/C++ struct or class.  <u>aggregate_member</u> specifies the
           struct/class and member to check for.  <u>header</u> is a string containing one or more #include lines that
           will be inserted into the program that will be run to test for the existence of the member. Example:

               sconf.CheckMember('struct tm.tm_sec', '#include &lt;<a href="file:/usr/include/time.h">time.h</a>&gt;')

           Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

       <u>context</u>.Define(<u>symbol,</u> <u>[value,</u> <u>comment]</u>)
           This method does not check for anything, but rather forces the definition of a preprocessor macro
           that will be added to the configuration header file.  <u>name</u> is the macro's identifier. If <u>value</u> is
           given, it will be be used as the macro replacement value. If <u>value</u> is a string and needs to display
           with quotes, the quotes need to be included, as in '"string"' If the optional <u>comment</u> is given, it is
           inserted as a comment above the macro definition (suitable comment marks will be added
           automatically). This is analogous to using <b>AC_DEFINE</b> in Autoconf.

           Examples:

               env = Environment()
               conf = Configure(env)

               # Puts the following line in the config header file:
               #    #define A_SYMBOL
               conf.Define("A_SYMBOL")

               # Puts the following line in the config header file:
               #    #define A_SYMBOL 1
               conf.Define("A_SYMBOL", 1)

           Examples of quoting string values:

               env = Environment()
               conf = Configure(env)

               # Puts the following line in the config header file:
               #    #define A_SYMBOL YA
               conf.Define("A_SYMBOL", "YA")

               # Puts the following line in the config header file:
               #    #define A_SYMBOL "YA"
               conf.Define("A_SYMBOL", '"YA"')

           Example including comment:

               env = Environment()
               conf = Configure(env)

               # Puts the following lines in the config header file:
               #    /* Set to 1 if you have a symbol */
               #    #define A_SYMBOL 1
               conf.Define("A_SYMBOL", 1, "Set to 1 if you have a symbol")

       You can define your own custom checks in addition to using the predefined checks. To enable custom
       checks, pass a dictionary to the <b>Configure</b> function as the <u>custom_tests</u> parameter. The dictionary maps
       the names of the checks to the custom check callables (either a Python function or an instance of a class
       implementing a __call__ method). Each custom check will be called with a a CheckContext instance as the
       first parameter followed by the remaining arguments, which must be supplied by the user of the check. A
       CheckContext is not the same as a configure context; rather it is an instance of a class which contains a
       configure context (available as <u>chk_ctx</u>.<u>sconf</u>). A CheckContext provides the following methods which
       custom checks can make use of::

       <u>chk_ctx</u>.Message(<u>text</u>)
           Displays <u>text</u> as an indicator of progess. For example: Checking for library X.... Usually called
           before the check is started.

       <u>chk_ctx</u>.Result(<u>res</u>)
           Displays a result message as an indicator of progress. If <u>res</u> is an integer, displays yes if <u>res</u>
           evaluates true or no if false. If <u>res</u> is a string, it is displayed as-is. Usually called after the
           check has completed.

       <u>chk_ctx</u>.TryCompile(<u>text,</u> <u>extension=''</u>)
           Checks if a file containing <u>text</u> and given the specified <u>extension</u> (e.g.  '.c') can be compiled to an
           object file using the environment's <b>Object</b> builder. Returns a boolean indicating success or failure.

       <u>chk_ctx</u>.TryLink(<u>text,</u> <u>extension=''</u>)
           Checks if a file containing <u>text</u> and given the specified <u>extension</u> (e.g.  '.c') can be compiled to an
           executable program using the environment's <b>Program</b> builder. Returns a boolean indicating success or
           failure.

       <u>chk_ctx</u>.TryRun(<u>text,</u> <u>extension=''</u>)
           Checks if a file containing <u>text</u> and given the specified <u>extension</u> (e.g.  '.c') can be compiled to an
           excutable program using the environment's <b>Program</b> builder and subsequently executed. Execution is
           only attempted if the build succeeds. If the program executes successfully (that is, its return
           status is 0), a tuple (True, outputStr) is returned, where <u>outputStr</u> is the standard output of the
           program. If the program fails execution (its return status is non-zero), then (False, '') is
           returned.

       <u>chk_ctx</u>.TryAction(<u>action,</u> <u>[text,</u> <u>extension='']</u>)
           Checks if the specified <u>action</u> with an optional source file (contents <u>text</u>, given extension
           <u>extension</u>) can be executed.  <u>action</u> may be anything which can be converted to an Action Object. On
           success, a tuple (True, outputStr) is returned, where <u>outputStr</u> is the content of the target file. On
           failure (False, '') is returned.

       <u>chk_ctx</u>.TryBuild(<u>builder,</u> <u>[text,</u> <u>extension='']</u>)
           Low level implementation for testing specific builds; the methods above are based on this method.
           Given the Builder instance <u>builder</u> and the optional <u>text</u> of a source file with optional <u>extension</u>,
           returns a boolean indicating success or failure. In addition, <u>chk_ctx</u>.<u>lastTarget</u> is set to the build
           target node if the build was successful.

       Example of implementing and using custom tests:

           def CheckQt(chk_ctx, qtdir):
               chk_ctx.Message('Checking for qt ...')
               lastLIBS = chk_ctx.env['LIBS']
               lastLIBPATH = chk_ctx.env['LIBPATH']
               lastCPPPATH = chk_ctx.env['CPPPATH']
               chk_ctx.env.Append(LIBS='qt', LIBPATH=qtdir + '<a href="file:/lib">/lib</a>', CPPPATH=qtdir + '/include')
               ret = chk_ctx.TryLink(
                   """\
           #include &lt;qapp.h&gt;
           int main(int argc, char **argv) {
             QApplication qapp(argc, argv);
             return 0;
           }
           """
               )
               if not ret:
                   chkctx.env.Replace(LIBS=lastLIBS, LIBPATH=lastLIBPATH, CPPPATH=lastCPPPATH)
               chkctx.Result(ret)
               return ret

           env = Environment()
           conf = Configure(env, custom_tests={'CheckQt': CheckQt})
           if not conf.CheckQt('/usr/lib/qt'):
               print('We really need qt!')
               <a href="../man1/Exit.1.html">Exit</a>(1)
           env = conf.Finish()

   <b>Command-Line</b> <b>Construction</b> <b>Variables</b>
       Often when building software, some variables need to be specified at build time. For example, libraries
       needed for the build may be in non-standard locations, or site-specific compiler options may need to be
       passed to the compiler.  SCons provides a <b>Variables</b> object to support overriding construction variables
       with values obtained from various sources, often from the command line:

           <b>scons</b> <b>VARIABLE=foo</b>

       The variable values can also be specified in a configuration file or an SConscript file.

       To obtain the object for manipulating values, call the <b>Variables</b> function:

       <b>Variables</b>([<u>files,</u> <u>[args]]</u>)
           If <u>files</u> is a file or list of files, they are executed as Python scripts, and the values of (global)
           Python variables set in those files are added as construction variables in the Default Environment.
           If no files are specified, or the <u>files</u> argument is <b>None</b>, then no files will be read (supplying <b>None</b>
           is necessary if there are no files but you want to specify <u>args</u> as a positional argument).

           The following example file contents could be used to set an alternative C compiler:

               CC = 'my_cc'

           If <u>args</u> is specified, it is a dictionary of values that will override anything read from <u>files</u>. The
           primary use is to pass the <u>ARGUMENTS</u> dictionary that holds variables specified on the command line,
           allowing you to indicate that if a setting appears on both the command line and in the file(s), the
           command line setting takes precedence. However, any dictionary can be passed. Examples:

               vars = Variables('custom.py')
               vars = Variables('overrides.py', ARGUMENTS)
               vars = Variables(None, {FOO:'expansion', BAR:7})

           Calling <b>Variables</b> with no arguments is equivalent to:

               vars = Variables(files=None, args=ARGUMENTS)

           Note that since the variables are eventually added as construction variables, you should choose
           variable names which do not unintentionally change pre-defined construction variables that your
           project will make use of (see the section called “Construction Variables”).

       Variables objects have the following methods:

       <u>vars</u>.<b>Add</b>(<u>key,</u> <u>[help,</u> <u>default,</u> <u>validator,</u> <u>converter]</u>)
           Add a customizable construction variable to the Variables object.  <u>key</u> is either the name of the
           variable, or a tuple (or list), in which case the first item in the tuple is taken as the variable
           name, and any remaining values are considered aliases for the variable.  <u>help</u> is the help text for
           the variable (default empty string).  <u>default</u> is the default value of the variable (default <b>None</b>). If
           <u>default</u> is <b>None</b> and a value is not specified, the construction variable will not be added to the
           construction environment.

           As a special case, if <u>key</u> is a tuple (or list) and is the <u>only</u> argument, the tuple is unpacked into
           the five parameters listed above left to right, with any missing members filled with the respecitive
           default values. This form allows <b>Add</b> to consume a tuple emitted by the convenience functions
           <b>BoolVariable</b>, <b>EnumVariable</b>, <b>ListVariable</b>, <b>PackageVariable</b> and <b>PathVariable</b>.

           If the optional <u>validator</u> is supplied, it is called to validate the value of the variable. A function
           supplied as a validator must accept three arguments: <u>key</u>, <u>value</u> and <u>env</u>, and should raise an
           exception with a helpful error message if <u>value</u> is invalid. No return value is expected from the
           validator.

           If the optional <u>converter</u> is supplied, it is called to convert the value before putting it in the
           environment, and should take either a value or a value and environment as parameters. The converter
           function must return a value, which will be converted into a string and be passed to the <u>validator</u>
           (if any) and then added to the construction environment.

           Examples:

               vars.Add('CC', help='The C compiler')

               def valid_color(key, val, env):
                   if not val in ['red', 'blue', 'yellow']:
                       raise Exception("Invalid color value '%s'" % val)

               vars.Add('COLOR', validator=valid_color)

       <u>vars</u>.<b>AddVariables</b>(<u>args</u>)
           A convenience method that adds one or more customizable construction variables to a Variables object
           in one call; equivalent to calling <b>Add</b> multiple times. The <u>args</u> are tuples (or lists) that contain
           the arguments for an individual call to the <b>Add</b> method. Since tuples are not Python mappings, the
           arguments cannot use the keyword form, but rather are positional arguments as documented for <b>Add</b>: a
           required name, the other four optional, but must be in the specified order if used.

               opt.AddVariables(
                   ("debug", "", 0),
                   ("CC", "The C compiler"),
                   ("VALIDATE", "An option for testing validation", "notset", validator, None),
               )

       <u>vars</u>.<b>Update</b>(<u>env,</u> <u>[args]</u>)
           Update a construction environment <u>env</u> with the customized construction variables. Any specified
           variables that are not configured for the Variables object will be saved and may be retrieved using
           the <b>UnknownVariables</b> method.

           Normally this method is not called directly, but rather invoked indirectly by passing the Variables
           object to the <b>Environment</b> function:

               env = Environment(variables=vars)

       <u>vars</u>.<b>UnknownVariables</b>()
           Returns a dictionary containing any variables that were specified either in the files or the
           dictionary with which the Variables object was initialized, but for which the Variables object was
           not configured.

               env = Environment(variables=vars)
               for key, value in vars.UnknownVariables():
                   print("unknown variable:  %s=%s" % (key, value))

       <u>vars</u>.<b>Save</b>(<u>filename,</u> <u>env</u>)
           Save the currently set variables into a script file named by <u>filename</u>. Only variables that are set to
           non-default values are saved. You can load these saved settings on a subsequent run by passing
           <u>filename</u> to the <b>Variables</b> function, providing a way to cache particular settings for reuse.

               env = Environment()
               vars = Variables(['variables.cache', 'custom.py'])
               vars.Add(...)
               vars.Update(env)
               vars.Save('variables.cache', env)

       <u>vars</u>.<b>GenerateHelpText</b>(<u>env,</u> <u>[sort]</u>)
           Generate help text documenting the customizable construction variables, suitable for passing in to
           the <b>Help</b> function.  <u>env</u> is the construction environment that will be used to get the actual values of
           the customizable variables. If the (optional) value of <u>sort</u> is callable, it is used as a comparison
           function to determine how to sort the added variables. This function must accept two arguments,
           compare them, and return a negative integer if the first is less-than the second, zero for equality,
           or a positive integer for greater-than. Optionally a Boolean value of <b>True</b> for <u>sort</u> will cause a
           standard alphabetical sort to be performed.

               Help(vars.GenerateHelpText(env))

               def cmp(a, b):
                   return (a &gt; b) - (a &lt; b)

               Help(vars.GenerateHelpText(env, sort=cmp))

       <u>vars</u>.<b>FormatVariableHelpText</b>(<u>env,</u> <u>opt,</u> <u>help,</u> <u>default,</u> <u>actual</u>)
           Returns a formatted string containing the printable help text for one option. It is normally not
           called directly, but is called by the <b>GenerateHelpText</b> method to create the returned help text. It
           may be overridden with your own function that takes the arguments specified above and returns a
           string of help text formatted to your liking. Note that <b>GenerateHelpText</b> will not put any blank lines
           or extra characters in between the entries, so you must add those characters to the returned string
           if you want the entries separated.

               def my_format(env, opt, help, default, actual):
                   fmt = "\n%s: default=%s actual=%s (%s)\n"
                   return fmt % (opt, default, actual, help)

               vars.FormatVariableHelpText = my_format

       To make it more convenient to work with customizable Variables, <b>scons</b> provides a number of functions that
       make it easy to set up various types of Variables. Each of these return a tuple ready to be passed to the
       <b>Add</b> or <b>AddVariables</b> method:

       <b>BoolVariable</b>(<u>key,</u> <u>help,</u> <u>default</u>)
           Return a tuple of arguments to set up a Boolean option. The option will use the specified name <u>key</u>,
           have a default value of <u>default</u>, and <u>help</u> will form the descriptive part of the help text. The option
           will interpret the command-line values <b>y</b>, <b>yes</b>, <b>t</b>, <b>true</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>on</b> and <b>all</b> as true, and the command-line
           values <b>n</b>, <b>no</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>false</b>, <b>0</b>, <b>off</b> and <b>none</b> as false.

       <b>EnumVariable</b>(<u>key,</u> <u>help,</u> <u>default,</u> <u>allowed_values,</u> <u>[map,</u> <u>ignorecase]</u>)
           Returns a tuple of arguments to set up an option whose value may be one of a specified list of legal
           enumerated values. The option will use the specified name <u>key</u>, have a default value of <u>default</u>, and
           <u>help</u> will form the descriptive part of the help text. The option will only support those values in
           the <u>allowed_values</u> list. The optional <u>map</u> argument is a dictionary that can be used to convert input
           values into specific legal values in the <u>allowed_values</u> list. If the value of <u>ignore_case</u> is 0 (the
           default), then the values are case-sensitive. If the value of <u>ignore_case</u> is 1, then values will be
           matched case-insensitively. If the value of <u>ignore_case</u> is 2, then values will be matched
           case-insensitively, and all input values will be converted to lower case.

       <b>ListVariable</b>(<u>key,</u> <u>help,</u> <u>default,</u> <u>names,</u> <u>[map]</u>)
           Returns a tuple of arguments to set up an option whose value may be one or more of a specified list
           of legal enumerated values. The option will use the specified name <u>key</u>, have a default value of
           <u>default</u>, and <u>help</u> will form the descriptive part of the help text. The option will only accept the
           values “all”, “none”, or the values in the <u>names</u> list. More than one value may be specified,
           separated by commas. The default may be a string of comma-separated default values, or a list of the
           default values. The optional <u>map</u> argument is a dictionary that can be used to convert input values
           into specific legal values in the <u>names</u> list. (Note that the additional values accepted through the
           use of a <u>map</u> are not reflected in the generated help message).

       <b>PackageVariable</b>(<u>key,</u> <u>help,</u> <u>default</u>)
           Returns a tuple of arguments to set up an option whose value is a path name of a package that may be
           enabled, disabled or given an explicit path name. The option will use the specified name <u>key</u>, have a
           default value of <u>default</u>, and <u>help</u> will form the descriptive part of the help text. The option will
           support the values <b>yes</b>, <b>true</b>, <b>on</b>, <b>enable</b> or <b>search</b>, in which case the specified <u>default</u> will be used,
           or the option may be set to an arbitrary string (typically the path name to a package that is being
           enabled). The option will also support the values <b>no</b>, <b>false</b>, <b>off</b> or <b>disable</b> to disable use of the
           specified option.

       <b>PathVariable</b>(<u>key,</u> <u>help,</u> <u>default,</u> <u>[validator]</u>)
           Returns a tuple of arguments to set up an option whose value is expected to be a path name. The
           option will use the specified name <u>key</u>, have a default value of <u>default</u>, and <u>help</u> will form the
           descriptive part of the help text. An additional <u>validator</u> may be specified that will be called to
           verify that the specified path is acceptable. SCons supplies the following ready-made validators:

           PathVariable.<b>PathExists</b>
               Verify that the specified path exists (this the default behavior if no <u>validator</u> is supplied).

           PathVariable.<b>PathIsFile</b>
               Verify that the specified path exists and is a regular file.

           PathVariable.<b>PathIsDir</b>
               Verify that the specified path exists and is a directory.

           PathVariable.<b>PathIsDirCreate</b>
               Verify that the specified path exists and is a directory; if it does not exist, create the
               directory.

           PathVariable.<b>PathAccept</b>
               Accept the specific path name argument without validation, suitable for when you want your users
               to be able to specify a directory path that will be created as part of the build process, for
               example.

           You may supply your own <u>validator</u> function, which must accept three arguments (<u>key</u>, the name of the
           variable to be set; <u>val</u>, the specified value being checked; and <u>env</u>, the construction environment)
           and should raise an exception if the specified value is not acceptable.

       These functions make it convenient to create a number of variables with consistent behavior in a single
       call to the <b>AddVariables</b> method:

           vars.AddVariables(
               BoolVariable(
                   "warnings",
                   help="compilation with -Wall and similar",
                   default=True,
               ),
               EnumVariable(
                   "debug",
                   help="debug output and symbols",
                   default="no",
                   allowed_values=("yes", "no", "full"),
                   map={},
                   ignorecase=0,  # case sensitive
               ),
               ListVariable(
                   "shared",
                   help="libraries to build as shared libraries",
                   default="all",
                   names=list_of_libs,
               ),
               PackageVariable(
                   "x11",
                   help="use X11 installed here (yes = search some places)",
                   default="yes",
               ),
               PathVariable(
                   "qtdir",
                   help="where the root of Qt is installed",
                   default=qtdir),
               PathVariable(
                   "foopath",
                   help="where the foo library is installed",
                   default=foopath,
                   validator=PathVariable.PathIsDir,
               ),
           )

   <b>Node</b> <b>Objects</b>
       SCons represents objects that are the sources or targets of build operations as Nodes, which are internal
       data structures. There are a number of user-visible types of nodes: File Nodes, Directory Nodes, Value
       Nodes and Alias Nodes. Some of the node types have public attributes and methods, described below. Each
       of the node types has a global function and a matching environment method to create instances: <b>File</b>, <b>Dir</b>,
       <b>Value</b> and <b>Alias</b>.

       <b>Filesystem</b> <b>Nodes</b>

           The <b>File</b> and <b>Dir</b> functions/methods return File and Directory Nodes, respectively. File and Directory
           Nodes (collectively, Filesystem Nodes) represent build components that correspond to an entry in the
           computer's filesystem, whether or not such an entry exists at the time the Node is created. You do
           not usually need to explicitly create filesystem Nodes, since when you supply a string as a target or
           source of a Builder, SCons will create the Nodes as needed to populate the dependency graph. Builders
           return the target Node(s) in the form of a list, which you can then make use of. However, since
           filesystem Nodes have some useful public attributes and methods that you can use in SConscript files,
           it is sometimes appropriate to create them manually, outside the regular context of a Builder call.

           The following attributes provide information about a Node:

           <u>node</u>.<u>path</u>
               The build path of the given file or directory. This path is relative to the top-level directory
               (where the SConstruct file is found). The build path is the same as the source path if
               <u>variant_dir</u> is not being used.

           <u>node</u>.<u>abspath</u>
               The absolute build path of the given file or directory.

           <u>node</u>.<u>relpath</u>
               The build path of the given file or directory relative to the root SConstruct file's directory.

           <u>node</u>.<b>srcnode</b>()
               The <b>srcnode</b> method returns another File or Directory Node representing the source path of the
               given File or Directory Node.

           Examples:

               # Get the current build dir's path, relative to top.
               Dir('.').path

               # Current dir's absolute path
               Dir('.').abspath

               # Current dir's path relative to the root SConstruct file's directory
               Dir('.').relpath

               # Next line is always '.', because it is the top dir's path relative to itself.
               Dir('#.').path

               # Source path of the given source file.
               File('foo.c').srcnode().path

               # Builders return lists of File objects:
               foo = env.Program('foo.c')
               print("foo will be built in", foo[0].path)

           Filesystem Node objects have methods to create new File and Directory Nodes relative to the original
           Node. There are also times when you may need to refer to an entry in a filesystem without knowing in
           advance whether it's a file or a directory. For those situations, there is an <b>Entry</b> method of
           filesystem node objects, which returns a Node that can represent either a file or a directory.

           If the original Node is a Directory Node, these methods will place the new Node within the directory
           the original Node represents:

           <u>node</u>.<b>Dir</b>(<u>name</u>)
               Returns a directory Node <u>name</u> which is a subdirectory of the directory represented by <u>node</u>.

           <u>node</u>.<b>File</b>(<u>name</u>)
               Returns a file Node <u>name</u> in the directory represented by <u>node</u>.

           <u>node</u>.<b>Entry</b>(<u>name</u>)
               Returns an unresolved Node <u>name</u> in the directory represented by <u>node</u>.

           If the original Node is a File Node, these methods will place the the new Node in the same directory
           as the one the original Node represents:

           <u>node</u>.<b>Dir</b>(<u>name</u>)
               Returns a Node <u>name</u> for a directory in the parent directory of the file represented by <u>node</u>.

           <u>node</u>.<b>File</b>(<u>name</u>)
               Returns a Node <u>name</u> for a file in the parent directory of the file represented by <u>node</u>.

           <u>node</u>.<b>Entry</b>(<u>name</u>)
               Returns an unresolved Node <u>name</u> in the parent directory of the file represented by <u>node</u>.

           For example:

               # Get a Node for a file within a directory
               incl = Dir('include')
               f = incl.File('header.h')

               # Get a Node for a subdirectory within a directory
               dist = Dir('project-3.2.1')
               src = dist.Dir('src')

               # Get a Node for a file in the same directory
               cfile = File('sample.c')
               hfile = cfile.File('sample.h')

               # Combined example
               docs = Dir('docs')
               html = docs.Dir('html')
               index = html.File('index.html')
               css = index.File('app.css')

       <b>Value</b> <b>and</b> <b>Alias</b> <b>Nodes</b>

           SCons provides two other Node types to represent object that will not have an equivalent filesystem
           entry. Such Nodes always need to be created explicitly.

           The <b>Alias</b> method returns an Alias Node. Aliases are virtual objects - they will not themselves result
           in physical objects being constructed, but are entered into the dependency graph related to their
           sources. An alias is checked for up to date by checking if its sources are up to date. An alias is
           built by making sure its sources have been built, and if any building took place, applying any
           Actions that are defined as part of the alias.

           An <b>Alias</b> call creates an entry in the alias namespace, which is used for disambiguation. If an alias
           source has a string valued name, it will be resolved to a filesystem entry Node, unless it is found
           in the alias namespace, in which case it it resolved to the matching alias Node. As a result, the
           order of <b>Alias</b> calls is significant. An alias can refer to another alias, but only if the other alias
           has previously been created.

           The <b>Value</b> method returns a Value Node. Value nodes are often used for generated data that will not
           have any corresponding filesystem entry, but will be used to determine whether a build target is out
           of date, or to include as part of a build Action. Common examples are timestamp strings, revision
           control version strings and other run-time generated strings.

           A Value Node can also be the target of a builder.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDING</b> <b>SCONS</b></h4><pre>
       SCons is designed to be extensible through provided facilities, so changing the code of SCons itself is
       only rarely needed to customize its behavior. A number of the main operations use callable objects which
       can be supplemented by writing your own. Builders, Scanners and Tools each use a kind of plugin system,
       allowing you to easily drop in new ones. Information about creating Builder Objects and Scanner Objects
       appear in the following sections. The instructions SCons actually uses to construct things are called
       Actions, and it is easy to create Action Objects and hand them to the objects that need to know about
       those actions (besides Builders, see <b>AddPostAction</b>, <b>AddPreAction</b> and <b>Alias</b> for some examples of other
       places that take Actions).  Action Objects are also described below. Adding new Tool modules is described
       in Tool Modules

   <b>Builder</b> <b>Objects</b>
       <b>scons</b> can be extended to build different types of targets by adding new Builder objects to a construction
       environment.  <u>In</u> <u>general</u>, you should only need to add a new Builder object when you want to build a new
       type of file or other external target. For output file types <b>scons</b> already knows about, you can usually
       modify the behavior of premade Builders such as <b>Program</b>, <b>Object</b> or <b>Library</b> by changing the construction
       variables they use (<b>$CC</b>, <b>$LINK</b>, etc.). In this manner you can, for example, change the compiler to use,
       which is simpler and less error-prone than writing a new builder. The documentation for each Builder
       lists which construction variables it uses.

       Builder objects are created using the <b>Builder</b> factory function. Once created, a builder is added to an
       environment by entering it in the <b>$BUILDERS</b> dictionary in that environment (some of the examples in this
       section illustrate this). Doing so automatically triggers SCons to add a method with the name of the
       builder to the environment.

       The <b>Builder</b> function accepts the following keyword arguments:

       <u>action</u>
           The command used to build the target from the source.  <u>action</u> may be a string representing a template
           command line to execute, a list of strings representing the command to execute with its arguments
           (suitable for enclosing white space in an argument), a dictionary mapping source file name suffixes
           to any combination of command line strings (if the builder should accept multiple source file
           extensions), a Python function, an Action object (see Action Objects) or a list of any of the above.

           An action function must accept three arguments: <u>source</u>, <u>target</u> and <u>env</u>.  <u>source</u> is a list of source
           nodes; <u>target</u> is a list of target nodes; <u>env</u> is the construction environment to use for context.

           The <u>action</u> and <u>generator</u> arguments must not both be used for the same Builder.

       <u>prefix</u>
           The prefix to prepend to the target file name.  <u>prefix</u> may be a string, a function (or other
           callable) that takes two arguments (a construction environment and a list of sources) and returns a
           prefix string, or a dictionary specifying a mapping from a specific source suffix (of the first
           source specified) to a corresponding target prefix string. For the dictionary form, both the source
           suffix (key) and target prefix (value) specifications may use environment variable substitution, and
           the target prefix may also be a callable object. The default target prefix may be indicated by a
           dictionary entry with a key of <b>None</b>.

               b = Builder("build_it &lt; $SOURCE &gt; $TARGET",
                           prefix="file-")

               def gen_prefix(env, sources):
                   return "file-" + env['PLATFORM'] + '-'

               b = Builder("build_it &lt; $SOURCE &gt; $TARGET",
                           prefix=gen_prefix)

               b = Builder("build_it &lt; $SOURCE &gt; $TARGET",
                           suffix={None: "file-", "$SRC_SFX_A": gen_prefix})

       <u>suffix</u>
           The suffix to append to the target file name. Specified in the same manner as for <u>prefix</u> above. If
           the suffix is a string, then <b>scons</b> prepends a '.' to the suffix if it's not already there. The string
           returned by the callable object or obtained from the dictionary is untouched and you need to manually
           prepend a '.' if one is required.

               b = Builder("build_it &lt; $SOURCE &gt; $TARGET"
                           suffix="-file")

               def gen_suffix(env, sources):
                   return "." + env['PLATFORM'] + "-file"

               b = Builder("build_it &lt; $SOURCE &gt; $TARGET",
                           suffix=gen_suffix)

               b = Builder("build_it &lt; $SOURCE &gt; $TARGET",
                           suffix={None: ".sfx1", "$SRC_SFX_A": gen_suffix})

       <u>ensure_suffix</u>
           If set to a true value, ensures that targets will end in <u>suffix</u>. Thus, the suffix will also be added
           to any target strings that have a suffix that is not already <u>suffix</u>. The default behavior (also
           indicated by a false value) is to leave unchanged any target string that looks like it already has a
           suffix.

               b1 = Builder("build_it &lt; $SOURCE &gt; $TARGET"
                            suffix = ".out")
               b2 = Builder("build_it &lt; $SOURCE &gt; $TARGET"
                            suffix = ".out",
                            ensure_suffix=True)
               env = Environment()
               env['BUILDERS']['B1'] = b1
               env['BUILDERS']['B2'] = b2

               # Builds "foo.txt" because ensure_suffix is not set.
               env.B1('foo.txt', 'foo.in')

               # Builds "bar.txt.out" because ensure_suffix is set.
               env.B2('bar.txt', 'bar.in')

       <u>src_suffix</u>
           The expected source file name suffix.  <u>src_suffix</u> may be a string or a list of strings.

       <u>target_scanner</u>
           A Scanner object that will be invoked to find implicit dependencies for this target file. This
           keyword argument should be used for Scanner objects that find implicit dependencies based only on the
           target file and the construction environment, <u>not</u> for implicit dependencies based on source files.
           See the section called “Scanner Objects” for information about creating Scanner objects.

       <u>source_scanner</u>
           A Scanner object that will be invoked to find implicit dependencies in any source files used to build
           this target file. This is where you would specify a scanner to find things like #include lines in
           source files. The pre-built DirScanner Scanner object may be used to indicate that this Builder
           should scan directory trees for on-disk changes to files that <b>scons</b> does not know about from other
           Builder or function calls. See the section called “Scanner Objects” for information about creating
           your own Scanner objects.

       <u>target_factory</u>
           A factory function that the Builder will use to turn any targets specified as strings into SCons
           Nodes. By default, SCons assumes that all targets are files. Other useful target_factory values
           include <b>Dir</b>, for when a Builder creates a directory target, and <b>Entry</b>, for when a Builder can create
           either a file or directory target.

           Example:

               MakeDirectoryBuilder = Builder(action=my_mkdir, target_factory=Dir)
               env = Environment()
               env.Append(BUILDERS={'MakeDirectory': MakeDirectoryBuilder})
               env.MakeDirectory('new_directory', [])

           Note that the call to this <b>MakeDirectory</b> Builder needs to specify an empty source list to make the
           string represent the builder's target; without that, it would assume the argument is the source, and
           would try to deduce the target name from it, which in the absence of an automatically-added prefix or
           suffix would lead to a matching target and source name and a circular dependency.

       <u>source_factory</u>
           A factory function that the Builder will use to turn any sources specified as strings into SCons
           Nodes. By default, SCons assumes that all source are files. Other useful source_factory values
           include <b>Dir</b>, for when a Builder uses a directory as a source, and <b>Entry</b>, for when a Builder can use
           files or directories (or both) as sources.

           Example:

               CollectBuilder = Builder(action=my_mkdir, source_factory=Entry)
               env = Environment()
               env.Append(BUILDERS={'Collect': CollectBuilder})
               env.Collect('archive', ['directory_name', 'file_name'])

       <u>emitter</u>
           A function or list of functions to manipulate the target and source lists before dependencies are
           established and the target(s) are actually built.  <u>emitter</u> can also be a string containing a
           construction variable to expand to an emitter function or list of functions, or a dictionary mapping
           source file suffixes to emitter functions. (Only the suffix of the first source file is used to
           select the actual emitter function from an emitter dictionary.)

           A function passed as <u>emitter</u> must accept three arguments: <u>source</u>, <u>target</u> and <u>env</u>.  <u>source</u> is a list
           of source nodes, <u>target</u> is a list of target nodes, <u>env</u> is the construction environment to use for
           context.

           An emitter must return a tuple containing two lists, the list of targets to be built by this builder,
           and the list of sources for this builder.

           Example:

               def e(target, source, env):
                   return target + ['foo.foo'], source + ['foo.src']

               # Simple association of an emitter function with a Builder.
               b = Builder("my_build &lt; $TARGET &gt; $SOURCE", emitter=e)

               def e2(target, source, env):
                   return target + ['bar.foo'], source + ['bar.src']

               # Simple association of a list of emitter functions with a Builder.
               b = Builder("my_build &lt; $TARGET &gt; $SOURCE", emitter=[e, e2])

               # Calling an emitter function through a construction variable.
               env = Environment(MY_EMITTER=e)
               b = Builder("my_build &lt; $TARGET &gt; $SOURCE", emitter='$MY_EMITTER')

               # Calling a list of emitter functions through a construction variable.
               env = Environment(EMITTER_LIST=[e, e2])
               b = Builder("my_build &lt; $TARGET &gt; $SOURCE", emitter='$EMITTER_LIST')

               # Associating multiple emitters with different file
               # suffixes using a dictionary.
               def e_suf1(target, source, env):
                   return target + ['another_target_file'], source

               def e_suf2(target, source, env):
                   return target, source + ['another_source_file']

               b = Builder(
                   action="my_build &lt; $TARGET &gt; $SOURCE",
                   emitter={'.suf1': e_suf1, '.suf2': e_suf2}
               )

       <u>multi</u>
           Specifies whether this builder is allowed to be called multiple times for the same target file(s).
           The default is <b>False</b>, which means the builder can not be called multiple times for the same target
           file(s). Calling a builder multiple times for the same target simply adds additional source files to
           the target; it is not allowed to change the environment associated with the target, specify
           additional environment overrides, or associate a different builder with the target.

       <u>env</u>
           A construction environment that can be used to fetch source code using this Builder. (Note that this
           environment is <u>not</u> used for normal builds of normal target files, which use the environment that was
           used to call the Builder for the target file.)

       <u>generator</u>
           A function that returns a list of actions that will be executed to build the target(s) from the
           source(s). The returned action(s) may be an Action object, or anything that can be converted into an
           Action object (see the next section).

           A function passed as <u>generator</u> must accept four arguments: <u>source</u>, <u>target</u>, <u>env</u> and <u>for_signature</u>.
           <u>source</u> is a list of source nodes, <u>target</u> is a list of target nodes, <u>env</u> is the construction
           environment to use for context, and <u>for_signature</u> is a Boolean value that tells the function if it is
           being called for the purpose of generating a build signature (as opposed to actually executing the
           command). Since the build signature is used for rebuild determination, the function should omit those
           elements that do not affect whether a rebuild should be triggered if <u>for_signature</u> is true.

           Example:

               def g(source, target, env, for_signature):
                   return [["gcc", "-c", "-o"] + target + source]

               b = Builder(generator=g)

           The <u>generator</u> and <u>action</u> arguments must not both be used for the same Builder.

       <u>src_builder</u>
           Specifies a builder to use when a source file name suffix does not match any of the suffixes of the
           builder. Using this argument produces a multi-stage builder.

       <u>single_source</u>
           Specifies that this builder expects exactly one source file per call. Giving more than one source
           file without target files results in implicitly calling the builder multiple times (once for each
           source given). Giving multiple source files together with target files results in a UserError
           exception.

       <u>source_ext_match</u>
           When the specified <u>action</u> argument is a dictionary, the default behavior when a builder is passed
           multiple source files is to make sure that the extensions of all the source files match. If it is
           legal for this builder to be called with a list of source files with different extensions, this check
           can be suppressed by setting <u>source_ext_match</u> to <b>False</b> or some other non-true value. In this case,
           <b>scons</b> will use the suffix of the first specified source file to select the appropriate action from
           the <u>action</u> dictionary.

           In the following example, the setting of <u>source_ext_match</u> prevents <b>scons</b> from exiting with an error
           due to the mismatched suffixes of foo.in and foo.extra.

               b = Builder(action={'.in' : 'build $SOURCES &gt; $TARGET'},
                           source_ext_match=False)

               env = Environment(BUILDERS={'MyBuild':b})
               env.MyBuild('foo.out', ['foo.in', 'foo.extra'])

       <u>env</u>
           A construction environment that can be used to fetch source code using this Builder. (Note that this
           environment is <u>not</u> used for normal builds of normal target files, which use the environment that was
           used to call the Builder for the target file.)

               b = Builder(action="build &lt; $SOURCE &gt; $TARGET")
               env = Environment(BUILDERS={'MyBuild' : b})
               env.MyBuild('foo.out', 'foo.in', my_arg='xyzzy')

       <u>chdir</u>
           A directory from which scons will execute the action(s) specified for this Builder. If the <u>chdir</u>
           argument is a string or a directory Node, scons will change to the specified directory. If the <u>chdir</u>
           is not a string or Node and is non-zero, then scons will change to the target file's directory.

           Note that scons will <u>not</u> automatically modify its expansion of construction variables like <b>$TARGET</b>
           and <b>$SOURCE</b> when using the <u>chdir</u> keyword argument--that is, the expanded file names will still be
           relative to the top-level directory containing the SConstruct file, and consequently incorrect
           relative to the chdir directory. Builders created using <u>chdir</u> keyword argument, will need to use
           construction variable expansions like ${TARGET.file} and ${SOURCE.file} to use just the filename
           portion of the targets and source.

               b = Builder(action="build &lt; ${SOURCE.file} &gt; ${TARGET.file}",
                           chdir=1)
               env = Environment(BUILDERS={'MyBuild' : b})
               env.MyBuild('sub/dir/foo.out', 'sub/dir/foo.in')

               <b>Warning</b>
               Python only keeps one current directory location even if there are multiple threads. This means
               that use of the <u>chdir</u> argument will <u>not</u> work with the SCons <b>-j</b> option, because individual worker
               threads spawned by SCons interfere with each other when they start changing directory.

       Any additional keyword arguments supplied when a Builder object is created (that is, when the <b>Builder</b>
       function is called) will be set in the executing construction environment when the Builder object is
       called. The canonical example here would be to set a construction variable to the repository of a source
       code system.

       Any such keyword arguments supplied when a Builder object is called will only be associated with the
       target created by that particular <b>Builder</b> call (and any other files built as a result of the call). These
       extra keyword arguments are passed to the following functions: command generator functions, function
       Actions, and emitter functions.

   <b>Action</b> <b>Objects</b>
       The <b>Builder</b> factory function will turn its <u>action</u> keyword argument into an appropriate internal Action
       object, as will the <b>Command</b> function. You can also explicitly create Action objects for passing to
       <b>Builder</b>, or other functions that take actions as arguments, by calling the <b>Action</b> factory function. This
       may more efficient when multiple Builder objects need to do the same thing rather than letting each of
       those Builder objects create a separate Action object. It also allows more flexible configuration of an
       Action object. For example, to control the message printed when the action is taken you need to create
       the action object using <b>Action</b>.

       The Action factory function returns an appropriate object for the action represented by the type of the
       <u>action</u> argument (the first positional parameter):

       •   If <u>action</u> is already an Action object, the object is simply returned.

       •   If <u>action</u> is a string, a command-line Action is returned. If such a string begins with @, the command
           line is not printed. If the string begins with hyphen (-), the exit status from the specified command
           is ignored, allowing execution to continue even if the command reports failure:

               Action('$CC -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES')

               # Doesn't print the line being executed.
               Action('@build $TARGET $SOURCES')

               # Ignores return value
               Action('-build $TARGET $SOURCES')

       •   If <u>action</u> is a list, then a list of Action objects is returned. An Action object is created as
           necessary for each element in the list. If an element within the list is itself a list, the embedded
           list is taken as the command and arguments to be executed via the command line. This allows white
           space to be enclosed in an argument rather than taken as a separator by defining a command in a list
           within a list:

               Action([['cc', '-c', '-DWHITE SPACE', '-o', '$TARGET', '$SOURCES']])

       •   If <u>action</u> is a callable object, a Function Action is returned. The callable must accept three keyword
           arguments: <u>target</u>, <u>source</u> and <u>env</u>.  <u>target</u> is a Node object representing the target file, <u>source</u> is a
           Node object representing the source file and <u>env</u> is the construction environment used for building
           the target file.

           The <u>target</u> and <u>source</u> arguments may be lists of Node objects if there is more than one target file or
           source file. The actual target and source file name(s) may be retrieved from their Node objects via
           the built-in Python <b>str</b> function:

               target_file_name = str(target)
               source_file_names = [str(x) for x in source]

           The function should return 0 or <b>None</b> to indicate a successful build of the target file(s). The
           function may raise an exception or return a non-zero exit status to indicate an unsuccessful build.

               def build_it(target=None, source=None, env=None):
                   # build the target from the source
                   return 0

               a = Action(build_it)

       •   If <u>action</u> is not one of the above types, no action object is generated and <b>Action</b> returns <b>None</b>.

       The environment method form <b>env.Action</b> will expand construction variables in any argument strings,
       including <u>action</u>, at the time it is called, using the construction variables in the construction
       environment through which it was called. The global function form <b>Action</b> delays variable expansion until
       the Action object is actually used.

       The optional second argument to <b>Action</b> is used to control the output which is printed when the Action is
       actually performed. If this parameter is omitted, or if the value is an empty string, a default output
       depending on the type of the action is used. For example, a command-line action will print the executed
       command. The following argument types are accepted:

       •   If the second argument is a string, or if the <u>cmdstr</u> keyword argument is supplied, the string defines
           what is printed. Substitution is performed on the string before it is printed. The string typically
           contains substitutable variables, notably $TARGET(S) and $SOURCE(S), or consists of just a single
           variable which is optionally defined somewhere else.  SCons itself heavily uses the latter variant.

       •   If the second argument is a function, or if the <u>strfunction</u> keyword argument is supplied, the
           function will be called to obtain the string to be printed when the action is performed. The function
           must accept three keyword arguments: <u>target</u>, <u>source</u> and <u>env</u>, with the same interpretation as for a
           callable <u>action</u> argument above. The function is responsible for handling any required substitutions.

       •   If the second argument is <b>None</b>, or if cmdstr=None is supplied, output is suppressed entirely.

       The <u>cmdstr</u> and <u>strfunction</u> keyword arguments may not both be supplied in a single call to <b>Action</b>

       Printing of action strings is affected by the setting of <b>$PRINT_CMD_LINE_FUNC</b>.

       Examples:

           def build_it(target, source, env):
               # build the target from the source
               return 0

           def string_it(target, source, env):
               return "building '%s' from '%s'" % (target[0], source[0])

           # Use a positional argument.
           f = Action(build_it, string_it)
           s = Action(build_it, "building '$TARGET' from '$SOURCE'")

           # Alternatively, use a keyword argument.
           f = Action(build_it, strfunction=string_it)
           s = Action(build_it, cmdstr="building '$TARGET' from '$SOURCE'")

           # You can provide a configurable variable.
           l = Action(build_it, '$STRINGIT')

       Any additional positional arguments, if present, may either be construction variables or lists of
       construction variables whose values will be included in the signature of the Action (the build signature)
       when deciding whether a target should be rebuilt because the action changed. Such variables may also be
       specified using the <u>varlist</u> keyword parameter; both positional and keyword forms may be present, and will
       be combined. This is necessary whenever you want a target to be rebuilt when a specific construction
       variable changes. This is not often needed for a string action, as the expanded variables will normally
       be part of the command line, but may be needed if a Python function action uses the value of a
       construction variable when generating the command line.

           def build_it(target, source, env):
               # build the target from the 'XXX' construction variable
               with open(target[0], 'w') as f:
                   f.write(env['XXX'])
               return 0

           # Use positional arguments.
           a = Action(build_it, '$STRINGIT', ['XXX'])

           # Alternatively, use a keyword argument.
           a = Action(build_it, varlist=['XXX'])

       The Action factory function can be passed the following optional keyword arguments to modify the Action
       object's behavior:

       <u>chdir</u>
           If <u>chdir</u> is true (the default is <b>False</b>), SCons will change directories before executing the action.
           If the value of <u>chdir</u> is a string or a directory Node, SCons will change to the specified directory.
           Otherwise, if <u>chdir</u> evaluates true, SCons will change to the target file's directory.

           Note that SCons will <u>not</u> automatically modify its expansion of construction variables like <b>$TARGET</b>
           and <b>$SOURCE</b> when using the <u>chdir</u> parameter - that is, the expanded file names will still be relative
           to the top-level directory containing the SConstruct file, and consequently incorrect relative to the
           chdir directory. Builders created using <u>chdir</u> keyword argument, will need to use construction
           variable expansions like ${TARGET.file} and ${SOURCE.file} to use just the filename portion of the
           targets and source. Example:

               a = Action("build &lt; ${SOURCE.file} &gt; ${TARGET.file}", chdir=True)

       <u>exitstatfunc</u>
           If provided, must be a callable which accepts a single parameter, the exit status (or return value)
           from the specified action, and which returns an arbitrary or modified value. This can be used, for
           example, to specify that an Action object's return value should be ignored under special conditions
           and SCons should, therefore, consider that the action always succeeds. Example:

               def always_succeed(s):
                   # Always return 0, which indicates success.
                   return 0

               a = Action("build &lt; ${SOURCE.file} &gt; ${TARGET.file}",
                          exitstatfunc=always_succeed)

       <u>batch_key</u>
           If provided, indicates that the Action can create multiple target files by processing multiple
           independent source files simultaneously. (The canonical example is "batch compilation" of multiple
           object files by passing multiple source files to a single invocation of a compiler such as
           Microsoft's Visual C / C++ compiler.) If the <u>batch_key</u> argument evaluates True and is not a callable
           object, the configured Action object will cause <b>scons</b> to collect all targets built with the Action
           object and configured with the same construction environment into single invocations of the Action
           object's command line or function. Command lines will typically want to use the <b>$CHANGED_SOURCES</b>
           construction variable (and possibly <b>$CHANGED_TARGETS</b> as well) to only pass to the command line those
           sources that have actually changed since their targets were built. Example:

               a = Action('build $CHANGED_SOURCES', batch_key=True)

           The <u>batch_key</u> argument may also be a callable function that returns a key that will be used to
           identify different "batches" of target files to be collected for batch building. A <u>batch_key</u> function
           must accept four parameters: <u>action</u>, <u>env</u>, <u>target</u> and <u>source</u>. The first parameter, <u>action</u>, is the
           active action object. The second parameter, <u>env</u>, is the construction environment configured for the
           target. The <u>target</u> and <u>source</u> parameters are the lists of targets and sources for the configured
           action.

           The returned key should typically be a tuple of values derived from the arguments, using any
           appropriate logic to decide how multiple invocations should be batched. For example, a <u>batch_key</u>
           function may decide to return the value of a specific construction variable from <u>env</u> which will cause
           <b>scons</b> to batch-build targets with matching values of that construction variable, or perhaps return
           the Python <b>id</b>() of the entire construction environment, in which case <b>scons</b> will batch-build all
           targets configured with the same construction environment. Returning <b>None</b> indicates that the
           particular target should <u>not</u> be part of any batched build, but instead will be built by a separate
           invocation of action's command or function. Example:

               def batch_key(action, env, target, source):
                   tdir = target[0].dir
                   if tdir.name == 'special':
                       # Don't batch-build any target
                       # in the special/ subdirectory.
                       return None
                   return (id(action), id(env), tdir)
               a = Action('build $CHANGED_SOURCES', batch_key=batch_key)

       <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Functions</b>

           SCons supplies Action functions that arrange for various common file and directory manipulations to
           be performed. These are similar in concept to "tasks" in the Ant build tool, although the
           implementation is slightly different. These functions do not actually perform the specified action at
           the time the function is called, but rather are factory functions which return an Action object that
           can be executed at the appropriate time.

           There are two natural ways that these Action Functions are intended to be used.

           First, if you need to perform the action at the time the SConscript file is being read, you can use
           the <b>Execute</b> global function:

               Execute(Touch('file'))

           Second, you can use these functions to supply Actions in a list for use by the <b>env.Command</b> method.
           This can allow you to perform more complicated sequences of file manipulation without relying on
           platform-specific external commands:

               env = Environment(TMPBUILD='/tmp/builddir')
               env.Command(
                   target='foo.out',
                   source='foo.in',
                   action=[
                       Mkdir('$TMPBUILD'),
                       Copy('$TMPBUILD', '${SOURCE.dir}'),
                       "cd $TMPBUILD &amp;&amp; make",
                       Delete('$TMPBUILD'),
                   ],
               )

           <b>Chmod</b>(<u>dest,</u> <u>mode</u>)
               Returns an Action object that changes the permissions on the specified <u>dest</u> file or directory to
               the specified <u>mode</u> which can be octal or string, similar to the POSIX <b>chmod</b> command. Examples:

                   Execute(Chmod('file', 0o755))

                   env.Command(
                       'foo.out',
                       'foo.in',
                       [Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'), Chmod('$TARGET', 0o755)],
                   )

                   Execute(Chmod('file', "ugo+w"))

                   env.Command(
                       'foo.out',
                       'foo.in',
                       [Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'), Chmod('$TARGET', "ugo+w")],
                   )

               The behavior of <b>Chmod</b> is limited on Windows, see the notes in the Python documentation for
               os.chmod, which is the underlying function.

           <b>Copy</b>(<u>dest,</u> <u>src</u>)
               Returns an Action object that will copy the <u>src</u> source file or directory to the <u>dest</u> destination
               file or directory. If <u>src</u> is a list, <u>dest</u> must be a directory if it already exists. Examples:

                   Execute(Copy('foo.output', 'foo.input'))

                   env.Command('bar.out', 'bar.in', Copy('$TARGET', '$SOURCE'))

           <b>Delete</b>(<u>entry,</u> <u>[must_exist]</u>)
               Returns an Action that deletes the specified <u>entry</u>, which may be a file or a directory tree. If a
               directory is specified, the entire directory tree will be removed. If the <u>must_exist</u> flag is set
               to a true value, then a Python error will be raised if the specified entry does not exist; the
               default is false, that is, the Action will silently do nothing if the entry does not exist.
               Examples:

                   Execute(Delete('/tmp/buildroot'))

                   env.Command(
                       'foo.out',
                       'foo.in',
                       action=[
                           Delete('${TARGET.dir}'),
                           MyBuildAction,
                       ],
                   )

                   Execute(Delete('file_that_must_exist', must_exist=True))

           <b>Mkdir</b>(<u>name</u>)
               Returns an Action that creates the directory <u>name</u> and all needed intermediate directories.  <u>name</u>
               may also be a list of directories to create. Examples:

                   Execute(Mkdir('/tmp/outputdir'))

                   env.Command(
                       'foo.out',
                       'foo.in',
                       action=[
                           Mkdir('/tmp/builddir'),
                           Copy('/tmp/builddir/foo.in', '$SOURCE'),
                           "cd /tmp/builddir &amp;&amp; make",
                           Copy('$TARGET', '/tmp/builddir/foo.out'),
                       ],
                   )

           <b>Move</b>(<u>dest,</u> <u>src</u>)
               Returns an Action that moves the specified <u>src</u> file or directory to the specified <u>dest</u> file or
               directory. Examples:

                   Execute(Move('file.destination', 'file.source'))

                   env.Command(
                       'output_file',
                       'input_file',
                       action=[MyBuildAction, Move('$TARGET', 'file_created_by_MyBuildAction')],
                   )

           <b>Touch</b>(<u>file</u>)
               Returns an Action that updates the modification time on the specified <u>file</u>. Examples:

                   Execute(Touch('file_to_be_touched'))

                   env.Command('marker', 'input_file', action=[MyBuildAction, Touch('$TARGET')])

       <b>Variable</b> <b>Substitution</b>

           Before executing a command, <b>scons</b> performs parameter expansion (substitution) on the string that
           makes up the action part of the builder. The format of a substitutable parameter is ${<u>expression</u>}. If
           <u>expression</u> refers to a variable, the braces in ${<u>expression</u>} can be omitted <u>unless</u> the variable name
           is immediately followed by a character that could either be interpreted as part of the name, or is
           Python syntax such as <b>[</b> (for indexing/slicing) or <b>.</b>  (for attribute access - see Special Attributes
           below).

           If <u>expression</u> refers to a construction variable, it is replaced with the value of that variable in
           the construction environment at the time of execution. If <u>expression</u> looks like a variable name but
           is not defined in the construction environment it is replaced with an empty string. If <u>expression</u>
           refers to one of the Special Variables (see below) the corresponding value of the variable is
           substituted.  <u>expression</u> may also be a Python expression to be evaluated. See Python Code
           Substitution below for a description.

           SCons uses the following rules when converting construction variables into command line strings:

           •   If the value is a string it is interpreted as space delimited command line arguments.

           •   If the value is a list it is interpreted as a list of command line arguments. Each element of the
               list is converted to a string.

           •   Anything that is not a list or string is converted to a string and interpreted as a single
               command line argument.

           •   Newline characters (\n) delimit lines. The newline parsing is done after all other parsing, so it
               is not possible for arguments (e.g. file names) to contain embedded newline characters.

           •   For a literal <b>$</b> use <b>$$</b>. For example, $$FOO will be left in the final string as $FOO.

           When a build action is executed, a hash of the command line is saved, together with other information
           about the target(s) built by the action, for future use in rebuild determination. This is called the
           build signature (or build action signature). The escape sequence <b>$(</b> <u>subexpression</u> <b>$)</b> may be used to
           indicate parts of a command line that may change without causing a rebuild--that is, which are not to
           be included when calculating the build signature. All text from <b>$(</b> up to and including the matching
           <b>$)</b> will be removed from the command line before it is added to the build signature while only the <b>$(</b>
           and <b>$)</b> will be removed before the command is executed. For example, the command line string:

               "echo Last build occurred $( $TODAY $). &gt; $TARGET"

           would execute the command:

               echo Last build occurred $TODAY. &gt; $TARGET

           but the build signature added to any target files would be computed from:

               echo Last build occurred  . &gt; $TARGET

           While construction variables are normally directly substituted, if a construction variable has a
           value which is a callable Python object (a function, or a class with a __call__ method), that object
           is called during substitution. The callable must accept four arguments: <u>target</u>, <u>source</u>, <u>env</u> and
           <u>for_signature</u>.  <u>source</u> is a list of source nodes, <u>target</u> is a list of target nodes, <u>env</u> is the
           construction environment to use for context, and <u>for_signature</u> is a boolean value that tells the
           callable if it is being called for the purpose of generating a build signature. Since the build
           signature is used for rebuild determination, variable elements that do not affect whether a rebuild
           should be triggered should be omitted from the returned string if <u>for_signature</u> is true. See <b>$(</b> and
           <b>$)</b> above for the syntax.

           SCons will insert whatever the callable returns into the expanded string:

               def foo(target, source, env, for_signature):
                   return "bar"

               # Will expand $BAR to "bar baz"
               env = Environment(FOO=foo, BAR="$FOO baz")

           As a reminder, substitution happens when $BAR is actually used in a builder action. The value of
           env['BAR'] will be exactly as it was set: "$FOO baz". This can make debugging tricky, as the
           substituted result is not available at the time the SConscript files are being interpreted and thus
           not available to the print function. However, you can perform the substitution on demand by calling
           the <b>env.subst</b> method for this purpose.

           You can use this feature to pass arguments to a callable variable by creating a callable class that
           stores passed arguments in the instance, and then uses them (in the __call__ method) when the
           instance is called. Note that in this case, the entire variable expansion must be enclosed by curly
           braces so that the arguments will be associated with the instantiation of the class:

               class foo:
                   def __init__(self, arg):
                       self.arg = arg

                   def __call__(self, target, source, env, for_signature):
                       return self.arg + " bar"

               # Will expand $BAR to "my argument bar baz"
               env=Environment(FOO=foo, BAR="${FOO('my argument')} baz")

       <b>Substitution:</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Variables</b>

           Besides regular construction variables, scons provides the following Special Variables for use in
           expanding commands:

           <b>$CHANGED_SOURCES</b>
               The file names of all sources of the build command that have changed since the target was last
               built.

           <b>$CHANGED_TARGETS</b>
               The file names of all targets that would be built from sources that have changed since the target
               was last built.

           <b>$SOURCE</b>
               The file name of the source of the build command, or the file name of the first source if
               multiple sources are being built.

           <b>$SOURCES</b>
               The file names of the sources of the build command.

           <b>$TARGET</b>
               The file name of the target being built, or the file name of the first target if multiple targets
               are being built.

           <b>$TARGETS</b>
               The file names of all targets being built.

           <b>$UNCHANGED_SOURCES</b>
               The file names of all sources of the build command that have <u>not</u> changed since the target was
               last built.

           <b>$UNCHANGED_TARGETS</b>
               The file names of all targets that would be built from sources that have <u>not</u> changed since the
               target was last built.

           These names are reserved and may not be assigned to or used as construction variables.  SCons
           computes them in a context-dependent manner and they and are not retrieved from a construction
           environment.

           For example, the following builder call:

               env = Environment(CC='cc')
               env.Command(
                   target=['foo'],
                   source=['foo.c', 'bar.c'],
                   action='@echo $CC -c -o $TARGET $SOURCES'
               )

           would produce the following output:

               cc -c -o foo foo.c bar.c

           In the previous example, a string ${SOURCES[1]} would expand to: bar.c.

       <b>Substitution:</b> <b>Special</b> <b>Attributes</b>

           A variable name may have the following modifiers appended within the enclosing curly braces to access
           properties of the interpolated string. These are known as special attributes.
               <u>base</u> -
                   The base path of the file name,
                   including the directory path
                   but excluding any suffix.

               <u>dir</u> - The name of the directory in which the file exists.
               <u>file</u> -  The file name, minus any directory portion.
               <u>filebase</u> - Like <u>file</u> but minus its suffix.
               <u>suffix</u> - Just the file suffix.
               <u>abspath</u> - The absolute path name of the file.
               <u>relpath</u> - The path name of the file relative to the root SConstruct file's directory.
               <u>posix</u> -
                   The path with directories separated by forward slashes
                   (<b>/</b>).
                   Sometimes necessary on Windows systems
                   when a path references a file on other (POSIX) systems.

               <u>windows</u> -
                   The path with directories separated by backslashes
                   (<b>\\</b>).
                   Sometimes necessary on POSIX-style systems
                   when a path references a file on other (Windows) systems.
                   <u>win32</u> is a (deprecated) synonym for
                   <u>windows</u>.

               <u>srcpath</u> -
                   The directory and file name to the source file linked to this file through
                   <b>VariantDir</b>().
                   If this file isn't linked,
                   it just returns the directory and filename unchanged.

               <u>srcdir</u> -
                   The directory containing the source file linked to this file through
                   <b>VariantDir</b>().
                   If this file isn't linked,
                   it just returns the directory part of the filename.

               <u>rsrcpath</u> -
                   The directory and file name to the source file linked to this file through
                   <b>VariantDir</b>().
                   If the file does not exist locally but exists in a Repository,
                   the path in the Repository is returned.
                   If this file isn't linked, it just returns the
                   directory and filename unchanged.

               <u>rsrcdir</u> -
                   The Repository directory containing the source file linked to this file through
                   <b>VariantDir</b>().
                   If this file isn't linked,
                   it just returns the directory part of the filename.

           For example, the specified target will expand as follows for the corresponding modifiers:

               $TARGET              =&gt; sub/dir/file.x
               ${TARGET.base}       =&gt; sub/dir/file
               ${TARGET.dir}        =&gt; sub/dir
               ${TARGET.file}       =&gt; file.x
               ${TARGET.filebase}   =&gt; file
               ${TARGET.suffix}     =&gt; .x
               ${TARGET.abspath}    =&gt; /top/dir/sub/dir/file.x
               ${TARGET.relpath}    =&gt; sub/dir/file.x

               $TARGET              =&gt; ../dir2/file.x
               ${TARGET.abspath}    =&gt; /top/dir2/file.x
               ${TARGET.relpath}    =&gt; ../dir2/file.x

               SConscript('src/SConscript', variant_dir='sub/dir')
               $SOURCE              =&gt; sub/dir/file.x
               ${SOURCE.srcpath}    =&gt; src/file.x
               ${SOURCE.srcdir}     =&gt; src

               Repository('/usr/repository')
               $SOURCE              =&gt; sub/dir/file.x
               ${SOURCE.rsrcpath}   =&gt; /usr/repository/src/file.x
               ${SOURCE.rsrcdir}    =&gt; /usr/repository/src

           Some modifiers can be combined, like ${TARGET.srcpath.base), ${TARGET.file.suffix}, etc.

       <b>Python</b> <b>Code</b> <b>Substitution</b>

           If a substitutable expression using the notation ${<u>expression</u>} does not appear to match one of the
           other substitution patterns, it is evaluated as a Python expression. This uses Python's <b>eval</b>
           function, with the <u>globals</u> parameter set to the current environment's set of construction variables,
           and the result substituted in. So in the following case:

               env.Command(
                   'foo.out', 'foo.in', "echo ${COND==1 and 'FOO' or 'BAR'} &gt; $TARGET"
               )

           the command executed will be either

               echo FOO &gt; foo.out

           or

               echo BAR &gt; foo.out

           according to the current value of env['COND'] when the command is executed. The evaluation takes
           place when the target is being built, not when the SConscript is being read. So if env['COND'] is
           changed later in the SConscript, the final value will be used.

           Here's a more complete example. Note that all of <b>COND</b>, <b>FOO</b>, and <b>BAR</b> are construction variables, and
           their values are substituted into the final command.  <b>FOO</b> is a list, so its elements are interpolated
           separated by spaces.

               env=Environment()
               env['COND'] = 1
               env['FOO'] = ['foo1', 'foo2']
               env['BAR'] = 'barbar'
               env.Command(
                   'foo.out', 'foo.in', "echo ${COND==1 and FOO or BAR} &gt; $TARGET"
               )

           will execute:

               echo foo1 foo2 &gt; foo.out

           In point of fact, Python expression evaluation is how the special attributes are substituted: they
           are simply attributes of the Python objects that represent <b>$TARGET</b>, <b>$SOURCES</b>, etc., which SCons
           passes to <b>eval</b> which returns the value.

               <b>Caution</b>

               Use of the Python <b>eval</b> function is considered to have security implications, since, depending on
               input sources, arbitrary unchecked strings of code can be executed by the Python interpreter.
               Although SCons makes use of it in a somewhat restricted context, you should be aware of this
               issue when using the ${python-expression-for-subst} form.

   <b>Scanner</b> <b>Objects</b>
       Scanner objects are used to scan specific file types for implicit dependencies, for example embedded
       preprocessor/compiler directives that cause other files to be included during processing.  SCons has a
       number of pre-built Scanner objects, so it is usually only necessary to set up Scanners for new file
       types. You do this by calling the <b>Scanner</b> factory function.  <b>Scanner</b> accepts the following arguments.
       Only <u>function</u> is required; the rest are optional:

       <u>function</u>
           A scanner function to call to process a given Node (usually a file) and return a list of Nodes
           representing the implicit dependencies (usually files) found in the contents. The function must
           accept three required arguments, <u>node</u>, <u>env</u> and <u>path</u>, and an optional fourth, <u>arg</u>.  <u>node</u> is the
           internal SCons node representing the file to scan, <u>env</u> is the construction environment to use during
           the scan, and <u>path</u> is a tuple of directories that can be searched for files, as generated by the
           optional scanner <u>path_function</u> (see below). If <u>argument</u> was supplied when the Scanner object was
           created, it is given as <u>arg</u> when the scanner function is called; since <u>argument</u> is optional, the
           default is no <u>arg</u>.

           The function can use use <b>str</b>(<u>node</u>) to fetch the name of the file, <u>node</u>.<b>dir</b> to fetch the directory the
           file is in, <u>node</u>.<b>get_contents</b>() to fetch the contents of the file as bytes or
           <u>node</u>.<b>get_text_contents</b>() to fetch the contents of the file as text.

           The function must take into account the <u>path</u> directories when generating the dependency Nodes. To
           illustrate this, a C language source file may contain a line like #include "foo.h". However, there is
           no guarantee that foo.h exists in the current directory: the contents of <b>$CPPPATH</b> is passed to the C
           preprocessor which will look in those places for the header, so the scanner function needs to look in
           those places as well in order to build Nodes with correct paths. Using <b>FindPathDirs</b> with an argument
           of CPPPATH as the <u>path_function</u> in the <b>Scanner</b> call means the scanner function will be called with
           the paths extracted from <b>$CPPPATH</b> in the environment <u>env</u> passed as the <u>paths</u> parameter.

           Note that the file to scan is <u>not</u> guaranteed to exist at the time the scanner is called - it could be
           a generated file which has not been generated yet - so the scanner function must be tolerant of that.

           Alternatively, you can supply a dictionary as the <u>function</u> parameter, to map keys (such as file
           suffixes) to other Scanner objects. A Scanner created this way serves as a dispatcher: the Scanner's
           <u>skeys</u> parameter is automatically populated with the dictionary's keys, indicating that the Scanner
           handles Nodes which would be selected by those keys; the mapping is then used to pass the file on to
           a different Scanner that would not have been selected to handle that Node based on its own <u>skeys</u>.

       <u>name</u>
           The name to use for the Scanner. This is mainly used to identify the Scanner internally. The default
           value is "NONE".

       <u>argument</u>
           If specified, will be passed to the scanner function <u>function</u> and the path function <u>path_function</u>
           when called, as the optional parameter each of those functions takes.

       <u>skeys</u>
           Scanner key(s) indicating the file types this scanner is associated with. Used internally to select
           an appropriate scanner. In the usual case of scanning for file names, this argument will be a list of
           suffixes for the different file types that this Scanner knows how to scan. If <u>skeys</u> is a string, it
           will be expanded into a list by the current environment.

       <u>path_function</u>
           A Python function that takes four or five arguments: a construction environment, a Node for the
           directory containing the SConscript file in which the first target was defined, a list of target
           nodes, a list of source nodes, and the value of <u>argument</u> if it was supplied when the Scanner was
           created. Must return a tuple of directories that can be searched for files to be returned by this
           Scanner object. (Note that the <b>FindPathDirs</b> function can be used to return a ready-made <u>path_function</u>
           for a given construction variable name, instead of having to write your own function from scratch.)

       <u>node_class</u>
           The class of Node that should be returned by this Scanner object. Any strings or other objects
           returned by the scanner function that are not of this class will be run through the function supplied
           by the <u>node_factory</u> argument. A value of <b>None</b> can be supplied to indicate no conversion; the default
           is to return File nodes.

       <u>node_factory</u>
           A Python function that will take a string or other object and turn it into the appropriate class of
           Node to be returned by this Scanner object, as indicated by <u>node_class</u>.

       <u>scan_check</u>
           A Python function that takes two arguments, a Node (file) and a construction environment, and returns
           whether the Node should, in fact, be scanned for dependencies. This check can be used to eliminate
           unnecessary calls to the scanner function when, for example, the underlying file represented by a
           Node does not yet exist.

       <u>recursive</u>
           Specifies whether this scanner should be re-invoked on the dependency files returned by the scanner.
           If omitted, the Node subsystem will only invoke the scanner on the file being scanned and not
           recurse. Recursion is needed when the files returned by the scanner may themselves contain further
           file dependencies, as in the case of preprocessor #include lines. A value that evaluates true enables
           recursion; <u>recursive</u> may be a callable function, in which case it will be called with a list of Nodes
           found and should return a list of Nodes that should be scanned recursively; this can be used to
           select a specific subset of Nodes for additional scanning.

       Once created, a Scanner can added to an environment by setting it in the <b>$SCANNERS</b> list, which
       automatically triggers SCons to also add it to the environment as a method. However, usually a scanner is
       not truly standalone, but needs to be plugged in to the existing selection mechanism for deciding how to
       scan source files based on filename extensions. For this, SCons has a global SourceFileScanner object
       that is used by the <b>Object</b>, <b>SharedObject</b> and <b>StaticObject</b> builders to decide which scanner should be
       used. You can use the SourceFileScanner.add_scanner() method to add your own Scanner object to the SCons
       infrastructure that builds target programs or libraries from a list of source files of different types:

           def xyz_scan(node, env, path):
               contents = node.get_text_contents()
               # Scan the contents and return the included files.

           XYZScanner = Scanner(xyz_scan)

           SourceFileScanner.add_scanner('.xyz', XYZScanner)

           env.Program('my_prog', ['file1.c', 'file2.f', 'file3.xyz'])

   <b>Tool</b> <b>Modules</b>
       Additional tools can be added to a project either by placing them in a site_tools subdirectory of a site
       directory, or in a custom location specified to <b>scons</b> by giving the <u>toolpath</u> keyword argument to
       <b>Environment</b>. A tool module is a form of Python module, invoked internally using the Python import
       mechanism, so a tool can consist either of a single source file taking the name of the tool (e.g.
       mytool.py) or a directory taking the name of the tool (e.g.  mytool/) which contains at least an
       __init__.py file.

       The <u>toolpath</u> parameter takes a list as its value:

           env = Environment(tools=['default', 'foo'], toolpath=['tools'])

       This looks for a tool specification module (mytool.py, or directory mytool) in directory tools and in the
       standard locations, as well as using the ordinary default tools for the platform.

       Directories specified via <u>toolpath</u> are prepended to the existing tool path. The default tool path is any
       site_tools directories, so tools in a specified <u>toolpath</u> take priority, followed by tools in a site_tools
       directory, followed by built-in tools. For example, adding a tool specification module gcc.py to the
       toolpath directory would override the built-in gcc tool. The tool path is stored in the environment and
       will be used by subsequent calls to the <b>Tool</b> method, as well as by <b>env.Clone</b>.

           base = Environment(toolpath=['custom_path'])
           derived = base.Clone(tools=['custom_tool'])
           derived.CustomBuilder()

       A tool specification module must include two functions:

       <b>generate</b>(<u>env,</u> <u>**kwargs</u>)
           Modify the construction environment <u>env</u> to set up necessary construction variables, Builders,
           Emitters, etc., so the facilities represented by the tool can be executed. Care should be taken not
           to overwrite construction variables intended to be settable by the user. For example:

               def generate(env):
                   ...
                   if 'MYTOOL' not in env:
                       env['MYTOOL'] = env.Detect("mytool")
                   if 'MYTOOLFLAGS' not in env:
                       env['MYTOOLFLAGS'] = SCons.Util.CLVar('--myarg')
                   ...

           The <b>generate</b> function may use any keyword arguments that the user supplies via <u>kwargs</u> to vary its
           initialization.

       <b>exists</b>(<u>env</u>)
           Return a true value if the tool can be called in the context of <u>env</u>. else false. Usually this means
           looking up one or more known programs using the <u>PATH</u> from the supplied <u>env</u>, but the tool can make the
           <u>exists</u> decision in any way it chooses.

           <b>Note</b>

           At the moment, user-added tools do not automatically have their <b>exists</b> function called. As a result,
           it is recommended that the <b>generate</b> function be defensively coded - that is, do not rely on any
           necessary existence checks already having been performed. This is expected to be a temporary
           limitation, and the <b>exists</b> function should still be provided.

       The elements of the <u>tools</u> list may also be functions or callable objects, in which case the <b>Environment</b>
       method will call those objects to update the new construction environment (see <b>Tool</b> for more details):

           def my_tool(env):
               env['XYZZY'] = 'xyzzy'

           env = Environment(tools=[my_tool])

       The individual elements of the <u>tools</u> list may also themselves be lists or tuples of the form (toolname,
       kw_dict). SCons searches for the <u>toolname</u> specification file as described above, and passes <u>kw_dict</u>,
       which must be a dictionary, as keyword arguments to the tool's <b>generate</b> function. The <b>generate</b> function
       can use the arguments to modify the tool's behavior by setting up the environment in different ways or
       otherwise changing its initialization.

           # in tools/my_tool.py:
           def generate(env, **kwargs):
             # Sets MY_TOOL to the value of keyword 'arg1' '1' if not supplied
             env['MY_TOOL'] = kwargs.get('arg1', '1')

           def exists(env):
             return True

           # in SConstruct:
           env = Environment(tools=['default', ('my_tool', {'arg1': 'abc'})],
                             toolpath=['tools'])

       The tool specification (<b>my_tool</b> in the example) can use the <b>$PLATFORM</b> variable from the construction
       environment it is passed to customize the tool for different platforms.

       Tools can be "nested" - that is, they can be located within a subdirectory in the toolpath. A nested tool
       name uses a dot to represent a directory separator

           # namespaced builder
           env = Environment(ENV=os.environ.copy(), tools=['SubDir1.SubDir2.SomeTool'])
           env.SomeTool(targets, sources)

           # Search Paths
           # SCons\Tool\SubDir1\SubDir2\SomeTool.py
           # SCons\Tool\SubDir1\SubDir2\SomeTool\__init__.py
           # .\site_scons\site_tools\SubDir1\SubDir2\SomeTool.py
           # .\site_scons\site_tools\SubDir1\SubDir2\SomeTool\__init__.py

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM-SPECIFIC</b> <b>BEHAVIOR</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scons</b> and its configuration files are very portable, due largely to its implementation in Python. There
       are, however, a few portability issues waiting to trap the unwary.

   <b>.C</b> <b>File</b> <b>Suffix</b>
       <b>scons</b> handles the upper-case .C file suffix differently, depending on the capabilities of the underlying
       system. On a case-sensitive system such as Linux or UNIX, <b>scons</b> treats a file with a .C suffix as a C++
       source file. On a case-insensitive system such as Windows, <b>scons</b> treats a file with a .C suffix as a C
       source file.

   <b>Fortran</b> <b>File</b> <b>Suffixes</b>
       There are several ways source file suffixes impact the behavior of SCons when working with Fortran
       language code (not all are system-specific, but they are included here for completeness).

       As the Fortran language has evolved through multiple standards editions, projects might have a need to
       handle files from different language generations differently. To this end, SCons dispatches to a
       different compiler dialect setup (expressed as a set of construction variables) depending on the file
       suffix. By default, all of these setups start out the same, but individual construction variables can be
       modified as needed to tune a given dialect. Each of these dialacts has a tool specification module whose
       documentation describes the construction variables associated with that dialect: .f (as well as .for and
       .ftn) in fortran; (construction variables start with FORTRAN) .f77 in f77; (construction variables start
       with F77) .f90 in f90; (construction variables start with F90) .f95 in f95; (construction variables start
       with F95) .f03 in f03; (construction variables start with F03) .f08 in f08 (construction variables start
       with F08).

       While SCons recognizes multiple internal dialects based on filename suffixes, the convention of various
       available Fortran compilers is to assign an actual meaning to only two of these suffixes: .f (as well as
       .for and .ftn) refers to the fixed-format source code that was the only available option in FORTRAN 77
       and earlier, and .f90 refers to free-format source code which became available as of the Fortran 90
       standard. Some compilers recognize suffixes which correspond to Fortran specifications later then F90 as
       equivalent to .f90 for this purpose, while some do not - check the documentation for your compiler. An
       occasionally suggested policy suggestion is to use only .f and .f90 as Fortran filename suffixes. The
       fixed/free form determination can usually be controlled explicitly with compiler flags (e.g.
       <b>-ffixed-form</b> for gfortran), overriding any assumption that may be made based on the source file suffix.

       The source file suffix does not imply conformance with the similarly-named Fortran standard - a suffix of
       .f08 does not mean you are compiling specifically for Fortran 2008. Normally, compilers provide
       command-line options for making this selection (e.g.  <b>-std=f2008</b> for gfortran).

       For dialects from F90 on (including the generic FORTRAN dialect), a suffix of .mod is recognized for
       Fortran modules. These files are a side effect of compiling a Fortran source file containing module
       declarations, and must be available when other code which declares that it uses the module is processed.
       SCons does not currently have integrated support for submodules, introduced in the Fortran 2008 standard
       - the invoked compiler will produce results, but SCons will not recognize .smod files as tracked objects.

       On a case-sensitive system such as Linux or UNIX, a file with a an upper-cased suffix from the set .F,
       .FOR, .FTN, .F90, .F95, .F03 and .F08 is treated as a Fortran source file which shall first be run
       through the standard C preprocessor. The lower-cased versions of these suffixes do not trigger this
       behavior. On systems which do not distinguish between uppper and lower case in filenames, this behavior
       is not available, but files suffixed with either .FPP or .fpp are always passed to the preprocessor
       first. This matches the convention of <b>gfortran</b> from the GNU Compiler Collection, and also followed by
       certain other Fortran compilers. For these two suffixes, the generic <u>FORTRAN</u> dialect will be selected.

       SCons itself does not invoke the preprocessor, that is handled by the compiler, but it adds construction
       variables which are applicable to the preprocessor run. You can see this difference by examining
       <b>$FORTRANPPCOM</b> and <b>$FORTRANPPCOMSTR</b> which are used instead of <b>$FORTRANCOM</b> and <b>$FORTRANCOMSTR</b> for that
       dialect.

   <b>Windows:</b> <b>Cygwin</b> <b>Tools</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cygwin</b> <b>Python</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>Pythons</b>
       Cygwin supplies a set of tools and utilities that let users work on a Windows system using a POSIX-like
       environment. The Cygwin tools, including Cygwin Python, do this, in part, by sharing an ability to
       interpret POSIX-style path names. For example, the Cygwin tools will internally translate a Cygwin path
       name like /cygdrive/c/mydir to an equivalent Windows pathname of C:/mydir (equivalent to C:\mydir).

       Versions of Python that are built for native Windows execution, such as the python.org and ActiveState
       versions, do not understand the Cygwin path name semantics. This means that using a native Windows
       version of Python to build compiled programs using Cygwin tools (such as gcc, bison and flex) may yield
       unpredictable results. "Mixing and matching" in this way can be made to work, but it requires careful
       attention to the use of path names in your SConscript files.

       In practice, users can sidestep the issue by adopting the following guidelines: When using Cygwin's gcc
       for compiling, use the Cygwin-supplied Python interpreter to run <b>scons</b>; when using Microsoft Visual C/C++
       (or some other "native" Windows compiler) use the python.org, Microsoft Store, ActiveState or other
       native version of Python to run <b>scons</b>.

       This discussion largely applies to the msys2 environment as well (with the use of the mingw compiler
       toolchain), in particular the recommendation to use the msys2 version of Python if running <b>scons</b> from
       inside an msys2 shell.

   <b>Windows:</b> <b>scons.bat</b> <b>file</b>
       On Windows, if <b>scons</b> is executed via a wrapper scons.bat batch file, there are (at least) two
       ramifications. Note this is no longer the default - <b>scons</b> installed via Python''s <b>pip</b> installer will have
       an <b>scons.exe</b> which does not have these limitations:

       First, Windows command-line users that want to use variable assignment on the command line may have to
       put double quotes around the assignments, otherwise the Windows command shell will consume those as
       arguments to itself, not to <b>scons</b>:

           <b>scons</b> <b>"FOO=BAR"</b> <b>"BAZ=BLEH"</b>

       Second, the Cygwin shell does not recognize typing <b>scons</b> at the command line prompt as referring to this
       wrapper. You can work around this either by executing <b>scons.bat</b> (including the extension) from the Cygwin
       command line, or by creating a wrapper shell script named scons which invokes scons.bat.

   <b>MinGW</b>
       The MinGW bin directory must be in your <b>PATH</b> environment variable or the <u>['ENV']['PATH']</u> construction
       variable for <b>scons</b> to detect and use the MinGW tools. When running under the native Windows Python;
       interpreter, <b>scons</b> will prefer the MinGW tools over the Cygwin tools, if they are both installed,
       regardless of the order of the bin directories in the <b>PATH</b> variable. If you have both MSVC and MinGW
       installed and you want to use MinGW instead of MSVC, then you must explicitly tell <b>scons</b> to use MinGW by
       passing tools=['mingw'] to the <b>Environment</b> function, because <b>scons</b> will prefer the MSVC tools over the
       MinGW tools.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       In general, <b>scons</b> is not controlled by environment variables set in the shell used to invoke it, leaving
       it up to the SConscript file author to import those if desired. However the following variables are
       imported by <b>scons</b> itself if set:

       <b>SCONS_LIB_DIR</b>
           Specifies the directory that contains the <b>scons</b> Python module directory. Normally <b>scons</b> can deduce
           this, but in some circumstances, such as working with a source release, it may be necessary to
           specify (for example, /home/aroach/scons-src-0.01/src/engine).

       <b>SCONSFLAGS</b>
           A string containing options that will be used by <b>scons</b> in addition to those passed on the command
           line. Can be used to reduce frequent retyping of common options. The contents of <b>SCONSFLAGS</b> are
           considered before any passed command line options, so the command line can be used to override
           <b>SCONSFLAGS</b> options if necessary.

       <b>SCONS_CACHE_MSVC_CONFIG</b>
           (Windows only). If set, save the shell environment variables generated when setting up the Microsoft
           Visual C++ compiler (and/or Build Tools) to a cache file, to give these settings persistence across
           <b>scons</b> invocations. Generating this information is relatively expensive, so using this option may aid
           performance where <b>scons</b> is run often, such as Continuous Integration setups.

           If set to a True-like value ("1", "true" or "True") will cache to a file named scons_msvc_cache.json
           in the user's home directory. If set to a pathname, will use that pathname for the cache.

           Note: this implementation may still be somewhat fragile. In case of problems, remove the cache file -
           recreating with fresh info normally resolves any issues.  SCons ignores failures reading or writing
           the cache file and will silently revert to non-cached behavior in such cases.

           <u>New</u> <u>in</u> <u>3.1</u> <u>(experimental).</u> <u>The</u> <u>default</u> <u>cache</u> <u>file</u> <u>name</u> <u>was</u> <u>changed</u> <u>to</u> <u>its</u> <u>present</u> <u>value</u> <u>in</u> <u>4.4,</u> <u>and</u>
           <u>contents</u> <u>were</u> <u>expanded.</u>

       <b>QTDIR</b>
           If using the qt tool, this is the path to the Qt installation to build against.  SCons respects this
           setting because it is a long-standing convention in the Qt world, where multiple Qt installations are
           possible.
