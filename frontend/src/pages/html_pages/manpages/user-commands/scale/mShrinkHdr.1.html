</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mShrinkHdr - Make a FITS header from a template with different pixel scale

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       mShrinkHdr [-d][-s scale] template.hdr shrunken.hdr

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  two ways to generate "thumbnail" images.  One is to build a full-resolution mosaic and shrink
       it down using mShrink to the scale desired.  This process can be costly if the full resolution  image  is
       not desired (or not desired yet).  It is much faster to mosaic at the scale of the thumbnail itself.  One
       reason for doing this could be to evaluate whether th full-resolution mosaic is worth building at all.

       mShrinkHdr  is  a simple utility that takes a FITS header template (such as might come out of mMakeHdr or
       mHdr) and make a new one at a differenc pixel scale.  The default  scale  for  this  new  header  is  200
       pixels, though the user can override this with any value.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -d

              Turn on debugging.

       -s <u>scale</u>

              Set the size in pixels of the larger axis.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       template.hdr

              Original FITS header template.

       shrunken.hdr

              "Thumbnail" FITS header template.

</pre><h4><b>RESULT</b></h4><pre>
       If successful, the result is a new FITS header template with a size and pixel scale appropriate to making
       a thumbnail mosaic.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>
       ERROR  Cannot open output template file

       ERROR  Bad template: <u>filename</u>

       ERROR  Output wcsinit() failed.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       $ mShrinkHdr region.hdr thumbnail.hdr
              [struct stat="OK"]

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The drizzle algorithm has been implemented but has not been tested in this release.

       If a header template contains carriage returns (i.e., created/modified on a Windows machine), the cfitsio
       library  will  be  unable  to read it properly, resulting in the error: [struct stat="ERROR", status=207,
       msg="illegal character in keyword"]

       It is best for the background correction  algorithms  if  the  area  described  in  the  header  template
       completely encloses all of the input images in their entirety. If parts of input images are "chopped off"
       by  the  header  template,  the  background correction will be affected. We recommend you use an expanded
       header for the reprojection and background modeling steps, returning to  the  originally  desired  header
       size  for  the  final  coaddition.  The  default background matching assumes that there are no non-linear
       background variations in the individual images (and therefore in the overlap differences).  If  there  is
       any  uncertainty  in  this  regard, it is safer to turn on the "level only" background matching (the "-l"
       flag in mBgModel.
