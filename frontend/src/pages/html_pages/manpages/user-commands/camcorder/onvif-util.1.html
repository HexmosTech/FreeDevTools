</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       onvif-util - query and adjust onvif compatible cameras

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         <b>onvif-util</b> [<b>-ah</b>] [<b>-u</b> &lt;user&gt;] [<b>-p</b> &lt;password&gt;] [<u>ip_address</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       View  and  set  parameters  on  onvif compatible IP cameras. The command may be used to find and identify
       cameras, and then to create an interactive session that can be used to query and set camera properties.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b> show all cameras on the network

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b> show the help for this command

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user</b> set the username for the camera login

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--password</b> set the password for the camera login

       To view all cameras on the network: <b>onvif-util</b> <b>-a</b>

       To login to a particular camera: <b>onvif-util</b> <b>-u</b> username <b>-p</b> password <u>ip_address</u>

       To login to a camera with safe mode disabled: <b>onvif-util</b> <b>-s</b> <b>-u</b> username <b>-p</b> password <u>ip_address</u>

       Once logged into the camera you can view data using the 'get' command followed by the data requested. The
       (n) indicates an optional profile index to apply the setting, otherwise the current profile is used

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       A typical session would begin by finding the cameras on the network

       &gt; <b>onvif-util</b> <b>-a</b>

             Looking for cameras on the network...
             Found 8 cameras
             192.168.1.18 localhost(TV TV-IP319PI)
             192.168.1.7 (IPC-BO IPC-122)
             192.168.1.14 IPC(Dahua IPC-HDW4631C-A)

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       There is a gui version of this program included with the libonvif package which will  implement  most  of
       the  same  commands.  It may be invoked using the 'onvif' command. The gui has the ability to view camera
       video output using a player such as ffplay, provided that the  player  executable  is  installed  in  the
       computer path.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Camera  compliance  with the onvif standard is often incomplete and in some cases incorrect. Success with
       the <b>onvif-util</b> may be limited in many cases. Cameras made by Hikvision will have the  greatest  level  of
       compatibility  with <b>onvif-util</b>. Cameras made by Dahua will have a close degree of compatibility with some
       notable exceptions regarding gateway and DNS settings. Time settings may not be reliable in  some  cases.
       If  the  time  is  set without the zone flag, the time appearing in the camera feed will be synced to the
       computer time. If the time zone flag is used, the displayed time  may  be  set  to  an  offset  from  the
       computer time based on the timezone setting of the camera.

       If  the  camera  DNS setting is properly onvif compliant, the IP address may be reliably set using <b>onvif-</b>
       <b>util</b>. Some cameras may not respond to the DNS setting requested by <b>onvif-util</b> due to non compliance. Note
       that the camera may reboot automatically under some conditions if the DNS setting is changed from off  to
       on.

       Video  settings are reliable. The Admin Password setting is reliable, as well as sync_time and the reboot
       command. If there is an issue with a particular setting, it is recommended to connect to the camera using
       the browser command, as most cameras will have a web interface that will allow you to  make  the  changes
       reliably.  The gui version has a button on the Admin tab that will launch the web browser with the camera
       ip address automatically.
