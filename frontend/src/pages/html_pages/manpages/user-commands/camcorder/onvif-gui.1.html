</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         <b>onvif-gui</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       GUI  program  to view and set parameters on onvif compatible IP cameras. Double clidcking the camera name
       in the list will display the camera video output.

       Camera parameters are available on the tabs on the lower right side of the application. Once a  parameter
       has been changed, the Apply button will be enabled, which can be used to commit the change to the camera.
       It may be necessary to re-start the video output stream in order to see the changes.

       Video:

               Resolution  - The drop down bos is used to select the setting.
               Frame Rate  - The number of frames per second in the video output.
               Gov Length  - This is the distance between key frames in the stream.
               Bitrate     - The maxmimum number of bits per second to transmit.

       Image:

               All values are set using the sliders

       Resolution. Upon changing the selection, the Apply button will be enabled. Click the apply button to make
       the change. The stream will stop and may be re-started by double clicking on the camera name.

       If camera is not repsonding to a particular command, or a command needed is not present on the  tool,  go

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       There is a command line version of this program included with the libonvif package which  will  implement
       most of the same commands. It may be invoked using the 'onvif-util' command.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Camera  compliance  with the onvif standard is often incomplete and in some cases incorrect. Success with
       the onvif-util may be limited in many cases. Cameras made by Hikvision will have the  greatest  level  of
       compatibility  with onvif-util. Cameras made by Dahua will have a close degree of compatibility with some
       notable exceptions regarding gateway and DNS settings. Time settings may not be reliable in  some  cases.
       If  the  time  is  set without the zone flag, the time appearing in the camera feed will be synced to the
       computer time. If the time zone flag is used, the displayed time  may  be  set  to  an  offset  from  the
       computer time based on the timezone setting of the camera.

       If  the  camera DNS setting is properly onvif compliant, the IP address may be reliably set. Some cameras
       may not respond to the DNS setting requested by <b>onvif-gui</b> due to non compliance. Note that the camera may
       reboot automatically under some conditions if the DNS setting is changed from off to on.
