</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       photopc - utility to control digital cameras based on Sierra Imaging firmware

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       photopc  [-h]  [-V] [-v[v]] [-q] [-z] [-t] [-f timeformat] [-s &lt;speed&gt;] [-S &lt;pseudo-speed&gt;] [-l &lt;device&gt;]
       [command [params] ] ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a command line tool to manipulate digital still cameras that use certain control protocol, namely
       Agfa ePhoto line, Epson PhotoPC line, Olympus D-xxxL  line,  Sanyo  and  Nikon  (at  least  CoolPix  9xx)
       cameras.   It can set camera parameters, download and erase pictures, e.t.c.  It was originally developed
       for Epson PhotoPC 500, now the author uses it with Olympus D-600L, results with other models may vary.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>   This option produces a help screen of all options and commands.

       <b>-V</b>   This option prints software revision information.

       <b>-v</b>   This option enables verbose output. Using two -v options increases the level of verbosity.  This  is
            primarily meant for debugging.

       <b>-q</b>   This  option  sets  quiet  mode.   If  it  is  not specified, the program will show running download
            progress indicator.

       <b>-z</b>   This option sets no time-zone processing mode.  Use this option if the camera's clock is (should be)
            set up shifted by the local timezone offset.

       <b>-s</b> <b>speed</b>
            This option permits setting the data rate to use when communicating with the  camera.   Valid  rates
            are 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600 and 115200 (the default).

       <b>-S</b> <b>speed</b>
            On  some  UNIX systems with some serial hardware/driver combinations you need to "lie" to the driver
            about the communication speed that you want to use at startup  and  during  the  session.   Physical
            startup  speed  is  always  19200.  E.g., if on your system speeds up to 19200 are translated one to
            one, but in order to use 57600 baud you have to specify 50 baud, and  you  want  to  run  at  57600,
            you'll need to specify <b>photopc</b> <b>-s57600</b> <b>-S19200,50</b> <u>&lt;commands</u> <u>...&gt;</u>

            Another  example:  if  your driver will use physical speed four times as high as you told it to set,
            and you want to run at default 115200 physical speed, specify <b>photopc</b> <b>-S4800,28800</b> <u>&lt;commands</u> <u>...&gt;</u>

       <b>-t</b>   Set timestamp of generated files to the time of snapshot.

       <b>-f</b> <b>timeformat</b>
            This option permits specifying the format for automatically generated image file names; the value is
            used as the format string for <a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3) function.  By default, names of the format  "MMDD_NNN.jpg"
            are  generated,  where  MM  is  a  month, DD is a day, and NNN is a count starting from 001.  A good
            starting point for the timeformat value could be  "%Y_%m_%d-%H_%M_%S.jpg".   If  the  format  string
            contains  context  "%%XXXd"  where  XXX are digits, it is taken for the count, i.e. if the file with
            such name is present, next count is tried.  If the format string does not contain "%%XXXd" part, the
            count field, if necessary, is appended at the end of the name.

            A few single-character formats are used as shortcuts.  "x" makes the name of seconds since the epoch
            in hexadecimal format (8 characters + ".jpg"), "d" - the same in decimal format (10 characters), "1"
            stands for default format  "%m%d_%%03d.jpg",  "2"  stands  for  "%y%m%d%%02d.jpg",  "3"  stands  for
            "%Y_%m_%d-%H_%M_%S.jpg"  and  4  stands for "%Y/%m/%d/%H_%M_%S.jpg".  The program attempts to create
            intermediate directories if necessary (and possible).

       <b>-l</b> <b>device</b>
            This allows specifying the serial device to use for communicating with the camera.  The  default  is
            <u>/dev/photopc</u>  (which  is typically created as a (symbolic) link to the real device, e.g. /dev/ttyS0)
            in UNIX, and <u>COM1:</u> in DOS and Windows.  Note that the program does not use UUCP style locks  so  you
            need  to  be  certain  that no other program, such as uugetty, uucico or mouse manager, is trying to
            access the same device.  Another note: on some systems (notably Linux) terminal  settings  are  kept
            across  usage of the serial port by different programs.  <b>photopc</b> may have troubles if, say, hardware
            flow control was kept turned on.  Try "stty -F /dev/ttyXX sane" if you suspect that you  are  bitten
            by this.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       After the options, one or more commands can be given in the command line.

       Some  commands  accept  <b>frame-list</b>  as  a  parameter.  Frame list is a comma-separated list of tokens (no
       whitespace allowed), each of the tokens being a word <b>all</b>, or a single number, or two numbers separated by
       a dash (-), or a number followed by a dash and a word <b>last</b> (without whitespace).

       <b>query</b>
            Display all current camera settings.

       <b>count</b>
            Output the number of pictures stored in the camera.  This is intended for use in shell scripts.

       <b>list</b> List information about frames stored in the camera.  Fields displayed are:  frame  number,  size  of
            image  file,  protection  state,  resolution mode, timestamp and filename if available.  Faster than
            <b>llist</b> but may not work with some (older) models.

            WARNING: this command changes current directory on models that support directory tree on  the  flash
            media.

       <b>llist</b>
            List  more  information  about  frames  stored  in  the camera.  Fields displayed are: frame number,
            protection state, size of image file, resolution mode, flash, shutter and  timestamp.   Slower  than
            <b>list</b> and does not work with models that use <u>Exif</u> file format.

            WARNING:  this  command changes current directory on models that support directory tree on the flash
            media.

       <b>cd</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
            On the models that support multiple directories on the flash  media,  change  current  directory  as
            specified.

            The  program chdir's to the first non-empty folder at the beginning.  So, your first <b>cd</b> command <u>must</u>
            specify full path starting with a slash. If it where unix you could also <b>cd</b> <u>../something</u> but here we
            do not have a way to move up one level.

       <b>protect</b> <b>&lt;frame-list&gt;</b> <b>On</b> <b>|</b> <b>Off</b>
            Change "protected" status of frames. Frame numbering starts at 1. The command will fail if the frame
            number is omitted, not numeric, or does not correspond to a stored frame.  "Protected" frames cannot
            be erased with "erase" and "eraseall" commands or with the "erase" button on the camera.

       <b>erase</b> <b>&lt;frame-list&gt;</b>
            Erase frames. Frame numbering starts at 1. The command will fail if the frame number is omitted, not
            numeric, or does not correspond to a stored frame.

            To avoid unexpected results, list of frames specified for this command is sorted  and  processed  in
            reverse order.

       <b>eraseall</b>
            Erase all stored frames.

       <b>eraselast</b>
            Erase most recently taken frame.

       <b>snapshot</b>
            Take a picture.

       <b>off</b>  Switch  off  the camera.  This command only has this effect on some models (notably Olympus D-600L).
            On other models, it just terminates the session immediately (otherwise the camera  would  be  active
            several seconds after the last command).  On models with big timeout, such as Photopc 600, it may be
            wise to always issue "off" at the end of command row, to decrease power consumption.

            All commands going after "off" are ignored.

       <b>image</b> <b>&lt;frame-list&gt;</b> <b>&lt;file-or-dir-name&gt;</b>
            Download  an  image or series of images from the camera to disk file(s) on the host computer.  Frame
            numbering starts at 1. The command will fail if the frame number is omitted, not  numeric,  or  does
            not  correspond to a stored frame.  Files are stored in JPEG (JFIF or Exif) format.  Image file also
            contains a thumbnail portion, and set of parameters like the shutter  speed,  date  and  time,  I.D.
            string  and  more.   Directory  must  be specified if frame list is requested.  If directory name is
            specified, downloaded file(s) will get unique names starting with month and date of snapshot, unless
            -f option is used, in which case unique names according to <b>-f</b> option setting.

       <b>thumbnail</b> <b>&lt;frame-list&gt;</b> <b>&lt;file-or-dir-name&gt;</b>
            Download a thumbnail image or series of thumbnails from the camera  to  disk  file(s)  on  the  host
            computer.  Frame  numbering  starts  at 1. The command will fail if the frame number is omitted, not
            numeric, or does not correspond to a stored frame. Files are stored in JPEG (JFIF or  Exif)  format.
            If  the  camera  does  not keep files in <u>EXIF</u> format, then the thumbnail file also contains a set of
            parameters like the shutter speed, date  and  time,  I.D.   string  and  more.   Directory  must  be
            specified  if  frame list is requested.  If directory name is specified, downloaded file(s) will get
            unique names according to <b>-f</b> option setting.

       <b>audio</b> <b>&lt;frame-list&gt;</b> <b>&lt;file-or-dir-name&gt;</b>
            Download an audio notice file or series of files from  the  camera  to  disk  file(s)  on  the  host
            computer.  Frame  numbering  starts  at 1. The command will fail if the frame number is omitted, not
            numeric, or does not correspond to a stored frame. Files are stored with ".wav"  extension  but  the
            format is <u>not</u> RIFF WAV format.  It is compressed in some way, probably with some variation of ADPCM.
            The program stores the raw data as provided by the camera, it is not playable as a normal <u>.wav</u> file.
            Directory  must be specified if frame list is requested.  If directory name is specified, downloaded
            file(s) will get unique names according to <b>-f</b> option setting.

       <b>preview</b> <b>&lt;file-name&gt;</b>
            take a `preview' snapshot and save image as a &lt;file-name&gt;.  File is in JPEG (JFIF or  Exif)  format,
            and does not contain any additional data, just plain (very low resolution) image.

       <b>upload</b> <b>&lt;file-name&gt;</b>
            Upload  image  file  into  the camera.  This command is not enabled in LOWMEMORY version (i.e. under
            MS/DOS).

            <b>WARNING!</b>  You cannot upload arbitrary JPEG file.  Depending on the camera model,  such  attempt  may
            result  in  the  image  not  uploaded, not viewable, or even the camera "hung" needing to remove the
            batteries to make it work again.  File previously downloaded from the same camera  model  is  always
            uploadable.   Otherwise, your milage may vary.  <b>photopc</b> program does not perform any checks, so it's
            up to the user to provide the file in proper format.

       <b>mode</b> <b>Record</b> <b>|</b> <b>Play</b> <b>|</b> <b>Thumbnail</b>
            Set specified operation mode on certain models.

       <b>resolution</b> <b>Hi</b> <b>|</b> <b>Lo</b> <b>|</b> <b>Ext</b> <b>|</b> <b>&lt;number&gt;</b>
            Set the camera to high, low or extended resolution mode.  Exact  meaning  of  the  modes  is  model-
            dependant and may specify different image dimensions and/or JPEG compression rate.

       <b>clock</b>
            Set  the  camera's  internal real-time clock using the current date and time from the host computer.
            Time of taking a snapshot is included inside the JPEG files produced.  Note that  the  models  which
            display  the  time  on  the  LCD will then display GMT rather than local time.  With <b>-z</b> option, time
            shifted by the timezone offset is set, and the LCD will display local time.  Using  unshifted  (GMT)
            time in the camera seems a proper way to go.

       <b>shutter</b> <b>&lt;speed&gt;</b>
            Set  the  camera  shutter speed.  Units can be specified in microseconds or in traditional form like
            "1/250".  Valid interval depends on the model.  If a value outside the interval  is  specified,  the
            camera  will  set  the  speed to the nearest margin of the valid interval.  Special speed value <b>auto</b>
            will set automatic shutter.  Note that this only works while the camera is connected  to  the  host,
            and   automatically  turns  the  flash  off.   While  disconnected,  shutter  speed  is  always  set
            automatically.

       <b>aperture</b> <b>Auto</b> <b>|</b> <b>Lo</b> <b>|</b> <b>Med</b> <b>|</b> <b>Hi</b>
            Set the lense aperture on models that support it.

       <b>flash</b> <b>Auto</b> <b>|</b> <b>Force</b> <b>|</b> <b>Off</b> <b>|</b> <b>AntiRedeye</b> <b>|</b> <b>SlowSync</b>
            Set the camera flash mode.

       <b>id</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b>
            Set the camera identifier string that is included inside the JPEG files produced.  Only  few  models
            support this.

       <b>autoshut-host</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
            Automatically  shut  off  the  camera  after  that many seconds of inactivity while connected to the
            computer (on the host).

       <b>autoshut-field</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
            Automatically shut off the camera after that many seconds of inactivity while disconnected from  the
            computer (in the field).

       <b>lcd-autoshut</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
            Automatically shut off the LCD monitor after that many seconds of inactivity.

       <b>lcd-brightness</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
            Set LCD brightness to the value (valid values are 1 to 7).

       <b>focus</b> <b>Macro</b> <b>|</b> <b>Normal</b> <b>|</b> <b>Infinity</b>
            Set  the  lens  focusing  mode.   As far as I can tell, on fixed focus models macro only means force
            minimum aperture, not change the focal  length.   Only  has  effect  in  the  same  invocation  with
            "snapshot" command.

       <b>adjust</b> <b>Normal</b> <b>|</b> <b>Contrast+</b> <b>|</b> <b>Contrast-</b> <b>|</b> <b>Brightness+</b> <b>|</b> <b>Brightness-</b>
            Set adjustment of picture brightness/contrast.

       <b>metering</b> <b>Center-weighted</b> <b>|</b> <b>Spot</b> <b>|</b> <b>Matrix</b>
            Set auto exposure metering mode.

       <b>whitebalance</b> <b>Normal</b> <b>|</b> <b>Sunny</b> <b>|</b> <b>Incandescent</b> <b>|</b> <b>Fluorescent</b> <b>|</b> <b>Flash</b> <b>|</b> <b>Preset</b> <b>|</b> <b>Cloudy</b>
            Set white balance.

       <b>color</b> <b>On</b> <b>|</b> <b>Off</b>
            Set color or B/W mode.

       <b>dzoom</b> <b>On</b> <b>|</b> <b>Off</b> <b>|</b> <b>&lt;number&gt;</b>
            Set  digital  zoom on or off.  Note that it <u>may</u> only work if low resolution was set prior to turning
            on digital zoom, and only have effect in the  same  invocation  with  "snapshot"  command.   Numeric
            values have model-dependant meaning.

       <b>zoom</b> <b>&lt;mm&gt;</b>
            Set optical zoom value on models that support it.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       On  some  models,  powersaving  timeouts  are measured not in seconds but in 1/10 sec units.  The program
       reports them as in seconds.

       Llist command relies on the format of thumbnail image that does not contain necessary information on some
       models (e.g. Nikon CP 900), this command does not work for these models.  List command, on the  contrary,
       do not display useful data on models that do not return it in the register 47 (e.g. Agfa 780).

       The  program is known to have some timing problems talking to Nikon CP900 when the camera is "napping" in
       powersaving mode.  Until the problem is solved, a workaround is to run the program this way:

       <b>$</b> <b>photopc</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>photopc</b> <u>&lt;command</u> <u>list&gt;</u>

       Nikon seem to have some other problems too, especially when doing "actions" (e.g. snapshots, erase).

       Another Nikon problem: if 32Mb (or bigger?) memry card is inserted, the program cannot get the number  of
       frames  taken,  and if "all" or "NN-last" range is specified for downloading, the program fails.  Specify
       explicit range of frames.  Also, with any card, number of frames taken is not updated  immediately  after
       the  "snapshot"  command  (the  same  has  been  reported for other models).  If you find how to find the
       correct number of frames, please let me know.
