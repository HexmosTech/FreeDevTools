</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       live-clone - program to clone GNU-Linux distributions based on live-build

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>sudo</b> <b>live-clone</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>live-clone</b> is a GUI program that allows one to clone the running system from a Debian Live USB stick
       (generated by <b>live-build</b> as an iso-hybrid drive) to other USB sticks or USB drives.

       All connected USB sticks and drives detected by live-clone are shown in a table, and one can select the
       targets of the clone process. The clone process will copy only the read-only part of the system, so
       personal data are not disclosed.

       One can select the size of a VFAT partition to create on the target devices, and a persistence partition
       is created on each of them. This partition will contain no initial data, and it will be populated during
       the first boot of the new system, and later continuously updated with the data generated by the user's
       activity.

       One can use this program also to clone from a Debian USB stick to the local main hard disk. This is NOT a
       standard installation of the Debian system, but the result is very efficient, and has nice features for
       the beginners.
