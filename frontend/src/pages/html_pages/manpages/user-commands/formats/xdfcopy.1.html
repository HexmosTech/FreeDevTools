       xdfcopy - copy and format XDF disks in Linux

</pre><h4><b>Note</b></h4><pre>
       This  manpage  has  been  automatically  generated  from  fdutils's texinfo documentation.  However, this
       process is only approximative, and some items, such as cross-references, footnotes and indices  are  lost
       in  this  translation  process.   Indeed,  these  items have no appropriate representation in the manpage
       format.  Moreover, only the items specific  to  each  command  have  been  translated,  and  the  general
       information about fdutils has been dropped in the manpage version.  Thus I strongly advise you to use the
       original texinfo doc.

       *      To generate a printable copy from the texinfo doc, run the following commands:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>dvi;</b> <b>dvips</b> <b>fdutils.dvi</b>

       *      To generate a HTML copy,  run:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>html</b>

              A pre-made HTML can be found at: `<a href="http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/fdutils">http://www.tux.org/pub/knaff/fdutils</a>'

       *      To generate an info copy (browsable using emacs' info mode), run:

                     <b>./configure;</b> <b>make</b> <b>info</b>

       The  texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as HTML.  Indeed, in the info version certain examples
       are difficult to read due to the quoting conventions used in info.

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
          xdfcopy [-<u>format-id</u>] [-d] [-n] [-h <u>head-skew</u>] [-t <u>cylinder-skew</u>] [-T
          <u>end-cylinder</u>] [<u>source</u>] <u>target</u>

       Xdfcopy is a utility to copy and format XDF disks. XDF (eXtended Density Format) is a format used by OS/2
       which can hold 1840KB of data (on a 3 1/2 high density disk). Its advantage over 2m formats is that it is
       faster: 38KB/s. Because of this fast speed, I extended the XDF standard  to  higher  capacities  (1992KB)
       with a transfer rate of 45KB/s. I called the new formats XXDF.

       This program works best with kernels newer than 2.0.0.

       If  both  source  and  target  are given, xdfcopy copies the disk image from file to floppy disk or vice-
       versa. When copying to a floppy disk, the disk is first formatted, unless the -n option is given.

       If no source is given, the target is only formatted. In this case, the target must be a floppy drive.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Selecting</b> <b>a</b> <b>format</b>
       Formats are selected by the format_id. The following formats are understood:

       0      Formats a 5 1/4 XDF disk (1520 KB, 45.6 KB/s).

       1      Formats a 3 1/2 high density XDF disk (1840 KB, 38.3 KB/s).

       2      Formats a 3 1/2 extra density XDF disk (3680 KB, 102 KB/s)

       3      Formats a 3 1/2 high density XXDF disk (1920 KB, 45 KB/s)

       4      Formats a 3 1/2 extra density XXDF disk (3840 KB, 90 KB/s)

</pre><h4><b>Misc</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       -D <u>dosdrive</u>
              Describes the DOS drive letter for mformat. If this option  is  given,  an  MS-DOS  filesystem  is
              automatically  installed  on the disk after the low-level format is complete. In order for this to
              work, the drive has to be configured to accept the 23x2x80 geometry in your  /etc/mtools  or  your
              <a href="file:~/.mtoolsrc">~/.mtoolsrc</a> file. Moreover, this only works with a version of mtools that is more recent than 3.0.

              Example of a working mtoolsrc line:

                 <b>A</b> <b>/dev/fd0</b>  <b>0</b>  <b>0</b> <b>0</b>  <b>0</b>

              Examples of a non-working mtoolsrc line:

                 <b>A</b> <b>/dev/fd0</b> <b>12</b> <b>80</b> <b>2</b> <b>18</b>

       -n     Don't format the disk before copying the disk image to the disk.

</pre><h4><b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>power</b> <b>users</b></h4><pre>
       -t <u>cylinder</u> <u>skew</u>
              Uses  a  different  track  skew  than  the  default  (14).  For more details on skews, see section
              superformat. In this version of xdfcopy, the -t parameter is ignored.

       -h <u>head</u> <u>skew</u>
              Uses a different head skew than the default (0) In this version, this parameter is ignored

       -d     Debugging. For each read or write operation, the time it took to complete the operation is printed
              (in milliseconds). This can be used to optimize the skews.

       -T <u>end-cylinders</u>
              Tells how many cylinders to format.  With the XXDF formats, it is actually possible to  format  up
              to 83 cylinders, yielding a format of up to 1992KB on a 3 1/2 high density disk.
