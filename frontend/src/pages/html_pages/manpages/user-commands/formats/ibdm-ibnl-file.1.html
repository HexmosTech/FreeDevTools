</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ibnl - a generic IB netlist format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       IBDM topology file <b>ibdm-topo-file</b> provide means to describe the IB fabric using a set of predefined
       systems. A system definition is provided in a single file in IBNL format that describes the internal
       InfiniBand connectivity of the system in terms of boards and devices. When IBDM starts it parses all the
       available system definition files before it handles the topology file. The files are located in the
       following directory relative to the installation prefix: &lt;prefix&gt;/lib/ibdm1.0/ibnl.

       This man page describes the IBNL file format used to define an arbitrary IB system internal IB
       connectivity. It outlines the main concepts used by the file, provides details for how to write such a
       file and provides a formal definition of the file syntax in BNF like format (YACC/Bison readable).

</pre><h4><b>1.</b> <b>Main</b> <b>Concepts</b></h4><pre>
       The described file format for defining generic system IB connectivity uses the following terminology:

       NODE
           The instantiation of an IB device may it be a switch or a channel adapter

       SUB-SYSTEM
           The instantiation of a board or module in a system

       SYSTEM
           A definition of a board or a module

       TOPSYSTEM
           The top most system defined in the given file

       SUB-SYSTEM MODIFIER
           Many  systems allow multiple variations of their subsystem such as a 12X version of a leaf board in a
           MTS9600. The modifier is a suffix to the board name. The  IBNL  format  supports  assigning  multiple
           names to the same board.

</pre><h4><b>2.</b> <b>File</b> <b>Format</b></h4><pre>
       The  exact  file  format is provided in section 4. This section only provides extra information regarding
       the specific semantics of various sections.

       The IBNL file is line sensitive as it requires different sections to start on a new  line.  The  file  is
       broken into several SYSTEM (optional) and one TOPSYSTEM sections. Each has one or more names.

       Connections are defined inside the SYSTEM/TOPSYSTEM section only and thus might be of two types:

       1. Between any node or sub-system to other node or sub-system
       2. From any node or sub-system to a connector of the system.

       NOTE-1:  The  top  system  can  define ports that might be redundant and not connected to any lower level
       board connector. In these cases the ports are simply omitted from  the  resulting  system.  This  feature
       enables defining the front panel ports of a 12X/4X such that if a 12X leaf is selected only the 12X front
       panel ports are used.

       NOTE-2:   Port  width and speed provided at the lowest level have precedence over definitions provided at
       upper levels of the hierarchy.

</pre><h4><b>3.</b> <b>Guidelines</b> <b>for</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>System</b> <b>IBNL</b> <b>File</b></h4><pre>
       The following procedure should be followed in order to provide a new system IBNL:

       a)  Name the file after the system name: &lt;any sys name (no spaces)&gt;.ibnl

       b)  Define a SYSTEM section for each board included in the system

       c)  The port names of the boards are just strings, we use the simple format of  Pn  where  N  is  just  a
           serial number but you can pick any name you want. Just make sure it is unique.

       d)  When  different  flavors of the boards exists like when you have a 4x and 12x option for a board name
           the optional boards with a modifier postfix. An example for such system that supports a LEAF board of
           12x and 4x types would be to define two SYSTEMS:

               SYSTEM LEAF,LEAF:4x,LEAF:4X

               ...

               SYSTEM LEAF:12x,LEAF:12X

               ...

           NOTE-3: The instantiations of the LEAF boards in another board or the top system need not specify the
           postfix and are being decided upon only when the topology file is being  parsed.  The  "SYSTEM  LEAF"
           with  no  postfix  will  be  used  by  default.  To  continue  the  example here is how the LEAFs are
           instantiated in the top system:

               TOPSYSTEM MyIbSystem

               LEAF leaf1

               ...

               LEAF leaf2

               ...

           The actual 4x or 12x version of the LEAF board can then be specified in the topology file CFG section
           to select the right combination of optional boards in the system. An example will be:

               MyIbSystem N001 CFG: leaf2=12x

           In this case leaf1 will be 4x as no special modifier is defined for it (and LEAF is by default  a  4x
           leaf). Leaf2 will be 12x as defined in the CFG section.

       e)  Special  considerations  should  be made to design the top system section when several optional board
           types exist. Top system section might include multiple definitions for front panel plugs  like  P1-4x
           and  P1-12x (yes these are just names that should follow the writing on the front or back panels). As
           the different flavors of the boards are not required  to  define  the  same  names  for  their  ports
           including  a 12x port might leave some of the top level connections dangling (not connected) and thus
           the front panel ports of the other flavor will be removed from the final  system  definition.  As  an
           example  let  us  consider  a  simple  board  LEAF with 3 4x port flavor and one 12x port flavors. We
           recommend connecting it in the top level using the following scheme:

               SYSTEM LEAF:4x

               NODE U1

               1 -4x-&gt; 4XP1

               2 -4x-&gt; 4XP2

               3 -4x-&gt; 4XP3

               ...

               SYSTEM LEAF:12x

               NODE U1

               1 -12x-&gt; 12XP1

               ...

               TOPSYSTEM myIbSystem

               SUBSYSTEM LEAF leaf1

               4XP1 -&gt; L1/P1

               4XP2 -&gt; L1/P2

               4XP3 -&gt; L1/P3

               12XP1 -&gt; L1/P1-12x

       f)  Place the file in the &lt;prefix&gt;/lib/IBDM/ibdm1.0/ibnl directory

       g)  Check the new file syntax by placing it in the ibnl directory as described above, creating  a  simple
           topology  (<b>ibdm-topo-file</b>  file with one such system and running <b>ibdmtr</b> utility to parse it tracing a
           simple path through it.
