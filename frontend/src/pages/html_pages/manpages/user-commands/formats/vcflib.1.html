</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       vcflib  contains tools and libraries for dealing with the Variant Call Format (VCF) which is a flat-file,
       tab-delimited textual format intended to describe reference-indexed variations between individuals.

       VCF provides a common interchange format for the description of variation in individuals and  populations
       of  samples, and has become the defacto standard reporting format for a wide array of genomic variant de‐
       tectors.

       vcflib provides methods to manipulate and interpret sequence variation as it can be described by VCF.  It
       is both:

       • an API for parsing and operating on records of genomic variation as it can be described by the VCF for‐
         mat,

       • and a collection of command-line utilities for executing complex manipulations on VCF files.

       The API itself provides a quick and extremely permissive method to read and write VCF files.   Extensions
       and  applications of the library provided in the included utilities (*.cpp) comprise the vast bulk of the
       library’s utility for most users.
