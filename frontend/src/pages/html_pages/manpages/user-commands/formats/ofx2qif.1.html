</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ofx2qif - convert OFX files to QIF format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ofx2qif</b> <u>path_to_ofx_file/ofx_filename</u> &gt; <u>output_filename.qif</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ofx2qif</b> is a OFX "file" to QIF (Quicken Interchange Format) converter.  It was written as a second code
       example, and as a way for LibOFX to immediately provide something useful, and to give people a reason to
       try the library.  It is not recommended that financial software use the output of this utility for OFX
       support.  The QIF file format is very primitive, and much information is lost.  The utility currently
       supports every transaction tags of the QIF format except the address lines, and supports many of the
       !Account tags.  It should generate QIF files that will import successfully in just about every software
       with QIF support.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This program does not accept any command-line options.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       The libofx maintainer does not plan on improving this utility much further, but contributions and patches
       are gladly accepted. If you are interested in hacking on <b>ofx2qif</b>, links to QIF documentation are
       available on the LibOFX home page.

       Note that all error output is disabled by default.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ofx2qif</b> is meant to be the C code example and demo of the libofx library.  It uses many of the functions
       and structures of the LibOFX API.
