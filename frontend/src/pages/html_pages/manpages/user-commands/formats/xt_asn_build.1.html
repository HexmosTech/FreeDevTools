       xt_asn_build — convert ASN.csv to packed format for xt_asn

</pre><h4><b>Syntax</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/usr/libexec/xt_asn/</u><b>xt_asn_build</b> [<b>-D</b> <u>target_dir</u>] [<b>-S</b> <u>source_dir</u>] [<b>-O</b> <u>output_file</u>]

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       xt_asn_build  is  used  to  build packed raw representations of the range database that the xt_asn module
       relies on. Since kernel memory is precious, much of the preprocessing is done in userspace by  this  very
       building  tool. One file is produced for each country, so that no more addresses than needed are required
       to be loaded into memory. The ranges in the packed database files are also ordered, as xt_asn  relies  on
       this property for its bisection approach to work.

       Since  the script is usually installed to the libexec directory of the xtables-addons package and this is
       outside $PATH (on purpose), invoking the script requires it to be called with a path.

       <b>-D</b> <u>target_dir</u>
              Specifies the target directory into which the files are to be put. Defaults to ".".

       <b>-S</b> <u>source_dir</u>
              Specifies  the  source  directory  from  which  to  read  the   two   files   by   the   name   of
              <b>GeoLite2-ASN-Blocks-IPv?.csv</b>,

       <b>-O</b> <u>output_file</u>
              Specifies an optioan target file to output DNS records for ASN to name (TXT-RRs) and network (APL-
              RRs).   Defaults  to  no output.  The file should be sorted postprocessing to remove duplicate TXT
              records and to combine APL-RRs into a more compact record set.

</pre><h4><b>Application</b></h4><pre>
       Shell commands to build the databases and put them to where they are expected:

       xt_asn_build -D /usr/share/xt_asn
