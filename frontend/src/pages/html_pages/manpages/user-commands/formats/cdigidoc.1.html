</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cdigidoc - read, digitally sign, verify files in XAdES format and encrypt, decrypt files in XMLENC format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cdigidoc</b> <b>&lt;command(s)&gt;</b> <b>[</b> <u>-in</u> <u>&lt;input-file&gt;</u> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <u>-out</u> <u>&lt;output-file&gt;</u> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <u>-config</u> <u>&lt;config-file&gt;</u> <b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cdigidoc</b>  is  an  utility  which  provides  a  command line interface to the CDigiDoc library, which is a
       library in C programming language offering the the functionality to create  files  in  supported  DigiDoc
       formats,  sigitally sign the DigiDoc files using smart cards or other supported cryptographic tokens, add
       time marks and validity confirmations to digital signatures  using  OCSP  protocol,  verify  the  digital
       signatures,  and  digitally  encrypt  and  decrypt the DigiDoc files. It is also possible to use cdigidoc
       utility as a CGI program in web applications created in environments that cannot easily use the  JDigiDoc
       library or call the DigiDocService webservice for digital signature functionality.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -?, -help
              Displays help about command syntax.

       -in &lt;input-file&gt;
              Specifies  the  input  file  name.  It  is  recommended  to pass the full path to the file in this
              parameter.

       -out &lt;output-file&gt;
              Stores the newly created or modified document in a file.

       -config &lt;configuration-file&gt;
              Specifies the CDigiDoc configuration file name. If left unspecified, then the  configuration  file
              is looked up from default locations.

       -check-cert &lt;certificate-file-in-pem-format&gt;
              Checks  the  certificate  validity  status.  Used  for checking the chosen certificate’s validity;
              returns an OCSP response from the certificate’s CA’s OCSP responder.  Note  that  the  command  is
              currently not being tested. If the certificate is valid, then the return code’s (RC) value is 0.

       -new [format] [version]
              Creates  a new digidoc container with the specified format and version. The current digidoc format
              in CDigiDoc library is DIGIDOC-XML, default  version  is  1.3  (newest).  By  using  the  optional
              parameter  -  version  -  with this command, you can specify an alternative version to be created.
              Note: the older SK-XML format is supported only for backward compatibility.

       -add &lt;input-file&gt; &lt;mime-type&gt; [&lt;content-type&gt;] [&lt;charset&gt;]
              Adds a new data file to a digidoc document. If digidoc doesn't  exist  then  creates  one  in  the
              default format.

              Input file (required)
                     Specifies  the  name  of  the  data  file  (it  is recommended to include full path in this
                     parameter; the path is removed when writing to DigiDoc container file).

              Mime type (required)
                     Represents the MIME type of the original file like "text/plain" or "application/msword".

              Content type
                     Reflects how the original files are embedded in  the  container  EMBEDDED_BASE64  (used  by
                     default).   In previous versions cdigidoc allowed content type EMBEDDED to sign pure xml or
                     text.

              Charset
                     UTF-8 encoding is supported and used by default.

       -sign &lt;pin-code&gt; [[[manifest] [[city] [state] [zip] [country]] [<a href="../man0/slot.0.html">slot</a>(0)] [<a href="../man1/ocsp.1.html">ocsp</a>(1)] [token-type(PKCS11)]
       [pkcs12-file-name]]
              Adds a digital signature to the digidoc document. You can use it with following parameters:

              pin code
                     In case of Estonian ID cards, pin code2 is used for digital  signing.  If  signing  with  a
                     software token (PKCS#12 file), then the password of PKCS#12 file should be entered here.

              manifest
                     Role or resolution of the signer

              city   City where the signature is created

              state  State or province where the signature is created

              zip    Postal code of the place where the signature is created

              country
                     Country of origin. ISO 3166-type 2-character country codes are used (e.g. EE)

              slot   Identifier  of  the  signer’s private key’s slot on a smartcard. When operating for example
                     with a single Estonian ID card, its signature key can be found in slot 1 - which is used by
                     default.  The library makes some assumptions about PKCS#11 drivers and card layouts:
                      - you have signature and/or authentication keys on the card
                      - both key and certificate are in one slot
                      - if you have many keys like 1 signature  and  1  authentication  key  then  they  are  in
                     different slots
                      -   you   can   sign  with  signature  key  that  has  a  corresponding  certificate  with
                     "NonRepudiation" bit set.  You may need to specify a different slot to  be  used  when  for
                     example  operating  with  multiple smart cards on the same system.  If the slot needs to be
                     specified during signing, then the 5 previous optional parameters (manifest,  city,  state,
                     zip,  country)  should  be  filled  first (either with the appropriate data or as "" for no
                     value).

              ocsp   Specifies whether an OCSP confirmation is added to the signature  that  is  being  created.
                     Possible  values  are 0 - confirmation is not added; 1 - confirmation is added. By default,
                     the value is set to 1.  Parameter value 0 can be used when creating a technical  signature.
                     Technical signature is a signature with no OCSP confirmation and no timestamp value.

              token type
                     Speciafies type of signature token to be use.
                      - PKCS11 default value. Signs with a smart-card or software pkcs11 token
                      - CNG on windows platforms uses CSP/CNG for signing
                      - PKCS12 signs with a PKCS#12 key container that must be entered in the next parameter

              pkcs12 file name
                     Name of the PKCS#12 key container file to be used for signing.

       -mid-sign &lt;phone-no&gt; &lt;per-code&gt; [[&lt;country&gt;(EE)] [&lt;lang&gt;(EST)] [&lt;service&gt;(Testing)] [&lt;manifest&gt;] [&lt;city&gt;
       &lt;state&gt; &lt;zip&gt;]]
              Invokes  mobile signing of a ddoc file using Mobile-ID and DigiDocService.  Mobile-ID is a service
              based on Wireless PKI providing for mobile authentication and digital signing, currently supported
              by all Estonian and some Lithuanian mobile operators.  The Mobile-ID user gets a special SIM  card
              with  private keys on it. Hash to be signed is sent over the GSM network to the phone and the user
              shall enter PIN code to sign. The signed result is sent back over the air.   DigiDocService  is  a
              SOAP-based  web  service,  access  to the service is IP-based and requires a written contract with
              provider of DigiDocService.  You can use Mobile-ID signing with the following parameters:

              phone-no
                     Phone number of the signer  with  the  country  code  in  format  +xxxxxxxxx  (for  example
                     +3706234566)

              per-code
                     Identification number of the signer (personal national ID number).

              country
                     Country of origin. ISO 3166-type 2-character country codes are used (e.g. default is EE)

              lang   Language  for  user dialog in mobile phone. 3-character capitalized acronyms are used (e.g.
                     default is EST)

              service
                     Name of the service –  previously  agreed  with  Application  Provider  and  DigiDocService
                     operator. Maximum length – 20 chars. (e.g. default is Testing)

              manifest
                     Role or resolution of the signer

              city   City where the signature is created

              state  State or province where the signature is created

              zip    Postal code of the place where the signature is created

       -list  Displays  the  data  file  and  signature  info  of  a DigiDoc document just read in; verifies all
              signatures.

              Returns Digidoc container data, in format: SignedDoc | &lt;format-identifier&gt; | &lt;version&gt;

              List of all data files, in format: DataFile | &lt;file identifier&gt; | &lt;file  name&gt;  |  &lt;file  size  in
                     bytes&gt; | &lt;mime type&gt; | &lt;data file embedding option&gt;

              List  of  all signatures (if existing), in format:  Signature | &lt;signature identifier&gt; | &lt;signer’s
                     key  info:  last  name,  first  name,  personal  code&gt;  |  &lt;verification  return  code&gt;   |
                     &lt;verification result&gt;

              Signer’s certificate information.

              OCSP responder certificate information

       -verify
              Returns signature verification results (if signatures exist):

              Signature  |  &lt;signature identifier&gt; | &lt;signer’s key info: last name, first name, personal code&gt; |
                     &lt;verification return code&gt; | &lt;verification result&gt;

              Returns signer’s certificate and OCSP Responder certificate information.

       -extract &lt;data-file-id&gt; &lt;output-file&gt;
              Extracts the selected data file from the DigiDoc container and stores it in a file.  Data file  id
              represents  the ID for data file to be extracted from inside the DigiDoc container (e.g. D0, D1…).
              Output file represents the name of the output file.

       -denc-list &lt;input-encrypted-file&gt;
              Displays the encrypted data and recipient’s info of an encrypted document just read in.

       -encrecv &lt;certificate-file&gt; [recipient] [KeyName] [CarriedKeyName]
              Adds a new recipient certificate and other metadata to an  encrypted  document.  Certificate  file
              (required)  specifies  the  file from which the public key component is fetched for encrypting the
              data. The decryption can be performed only by using private key corresponding to that certificate.
              The input certificate files for encryption must come from  the  file  system  (PEM  encodings  are
              supported).  Possible  sources  where  the certificate files can be obtained from include: Windows
              Certificate Store ("Other Persons"), LDAP directories, ID-card in smart-card reader.  For  example
              the  certificate  files  for  Estonian  ID  card  owners can be retrieved from a LDAP directory at
              ldap://ldap.sk.ee. The query can be made  in  following  format  through  the  web  browser  (IE):
              ldap://ldap.sk.ee:389/c=EE??sub?(serialNumber= xxxxxxxxxxx) where serial Number is the recipient’s
              personal identification number, e,g.38307240240).  Other parameters include:

              recipient
                     If  left  unspecified,  then the program assigns the CN value of the certificate passwed as
                     first parameter.  This is later used as a command line option  to  identify  the  recipient
                     whose  key  and  smart  card is used to decrypt the data.  Note: Although this parameter is
                     optional, it is recommended to pass on the entire CN value from the recipient’s certificate
                     as the recipient identifier here, especially when dealing with multiple recipients.

              KeyName
                     Sub-element &lt;KeyName&gt; can be added to better identify the key object. Optional, but can  be
                     used to search for the right recipient’s key or display its data in an application.

              CarriedKeyName
                     Sub-element  &lt;CarriedKeyName&gt; can be added to better identify the key object. Optional, but
                     can be used to search for the right recipient’s key or display its data in an application.

       -encrypt-sk &lt;input-file&gt;
              Encrypts the data from the given input file and writes the completed encrypted document in a file.
              Recommended for providing cross-usability with other DigiDoc software  components.   This  command
              places the data file to be encrypted in a new DigiDoc container. Therefore handling such encrypted
              documents  later with other DigiDoc applications is fully supported (e.g. DigiDoc3 client).  Input
              file (required) specifies  the  original  data  file  to  be  encrypted.   Note:  There  are  also
              alternative  encryption  commands  which are however not recommended for providing cross-usability
              with other DigiDoc software components:

              <u>-encrypt</u> <u>&lt;input-file&gt;</u>
                     Encrypts the data from the given input file and writes the completed encrypted document  in
                     a  file. Should be used only for encrypting small documents, already in DIGIDOC-XML format.
                     Input file (required) specifies the original data file to be encrypted.

              <u>-encrypt-file</u> <u>&lt;input-file&gt;</u> <u>&lt;output-file&gt;</u>
                     Encrypts the input file and writes to output file. Should be used only for encrypting large
                     documents, already in DIGIDOC-XML format. Note that the command in  not  currently  tested.
                     Input  file  (required)  specifies  the  original  data  file to be encrypted.  Output file
                     (required) specifies the name of the output file which  will  be  created  in  the  current
                     encrypted document format (ENCDOC-XML ver 1.0), with file extension .cdoc.

       -decrypt-sk &lt;input-file&gt; &lt;pin&gt; [pkcs12-file] [<a href="../man0/slot.0.html">slot</a>(0)]
              Decrypts  and  possibly  decompresses  the  encrypted file just read in and writes to output file.
              Expects the encrypted file to be inside a DigiDoc container.  Input file (required) specifies  the
              input  file’s  name.   Pin  (required)  represents the recipient’s pin1 (in context of Estonian ID
              cards).  pkcs12-file (optional) specifies the PKCS#12 file if decrypting is done with  a  software
              token.  slot default is slot 0 containing Estonian ID cards authentication keypair. This parameter
              can  be  used  to  decrypt with a key from the second id card attached to the computer etc.  Note:
              There are also alternative commands for decryption, depending on the encrypted file’s format, size
              and the certificate type used for decrypting it.

              <u>-decrypt</u> <u>&lt;input-file&gt;</u> <u>&lt;pin&gt;</u> <u>[pkcs12-file]</u> <u>[<a href="../man0/slot.0.html">slot</a>(0)]</u>
                     Offers same functionality as -decrypt-sk, should be used for decrypting small files  (which
                     do  not  need to be inside a DigiDoc container).  Input file (required) specifies the input
                     file’s name.  Pin (required) represents the recipient’s pin1 (in contexts  of  Estonian  ID
                     cards).   pkcs12-file  (optional)  specifies  the PKCS#12 file if decrypting is done with a
                     software token.  slot default  is  slot  0  containing  Estonian  ID  cards  authentication
                     keypair.  This parameter can be used to decrypt with a key from the second id card attached
                     to the computer etc.

              <u>-decrypt-file</u> <u>&lt;input-file&gt;</u> <u>&lt;output-file&gt;</u> <u>&lt;pin&gt;</u> <u>[pkcs12-file]</u>
                     Offers same functionality  as  -decrypt  for  decrypting  documents,  should  be  used  for
                     decrypting  large  files  (which do not need to be inside a DigiDoc container). Expects the
                     encrypted data not to be compressed. Note that the command is not currently tested.   Input
                     file  (required)  specifies  the  encrypted  file  to be decrypted.  Output file (required)
                     specifies the output file  name.   Pin  (required)  represents  the  recipient’s  pin1  (in
                     contexts  of  Estonian  ID  cards).   pkcs12-file  (optional) specifies the PKCS#12 file if
                     decrypting is done with a software token.

       -calc-sign &lt;cert-file&gt; [&lt;manifest&gt;] [&lt;city&gt; &lt;state&gt; &lt;zip&gt; &lt;country&gt;]
              Offers an alternative to -sign command to be used in CGI pograms. Adds signers certificate in  pem
              format  and  optionally  manifest  and  signers  address and calculates the final hash value to be
              signed. This value is hex-encoded and can now be sent to users computer to be signed using  a  web
              plugin. This command creates an incomplete signature that lacks the actual RSA signature value. It
              must  be  stored  in  a temporary file and later completed using the -add-sign-value command.  -IP
              "-add-sign-value &lt;sign-value-file&gt; &lt;sign-id&gt;" Offers an alternative to -sign command to be used in
              CGI pograms. Adds an RSA signature hex-encoded value to an incomplete signature created using  the
              -calc-sign  command.  This  signature is still lacking the ocsp timemark, that can now be obtained
              using the -get-confirmation command producing a complete XAdES signature.

       -get-confirmation &lt;signature-id&gt;
              Adds an OCSP confirmation to a DigiDoc file’s signature.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       cdigidoc -new DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 -add &lt;input-file&gt; &lt;mime&gt; -sign &lt;pin2&gt; -out &lt;output-file&gt;
              Creates a new signed document in DIGIDOC-XML 1.3 format, adds one input file, signs with smartcard
              using the default signature slot and writes to a signed document file.

       cdigidoc -in &lt;signed-input-file&gt; -list
              Reads in a signed document, verifies signatures and prints the results to console.

       cdigidoc -in &lt;signed-input-file&gt; -extract D0 &lt;output-file&gt;
              Reads in a signed document, finds the first signed document and writes it to output file.

       file.cdoc&gt;
              Creates a new encypted file by encrypting input file that is encrypted using AES-128 and  encrypts
              the  generated  randome  transport  key  using RSA for two possible recipients identified by their
              certificates. Transport key is encrypted using RSA1.5.
