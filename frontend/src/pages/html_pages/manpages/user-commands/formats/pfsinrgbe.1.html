</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pfsinrgbe - Load images or frames in Radiance RGBE format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pfsinrgbe</b> [--linear] (&lt;file&gt; [--frames &lt;range&gt;] [--skip-missing])  [&lt;file&gt;...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>pfsinrgbe</u>  command loads images in Radiance RGBE format and writes <u>pfs</u> stream to the Standard Output. The
       <u>pfs</u> stream is usually piped to another program for further processing. To detect the format automatically
       based on the extension, use <u>pfsin</u> command.

       Since RGBE is an HDR format, 'LUMINANCE' tag is set to 'RELATIVE' (relative linear luminance values).

       To read images from standard input use a single dash '-' instead of filename. The images are  read  until
       EOF is reached.

       Each  file  can  contain  a %d pattern, which is substituted with frame numbers. The pattern has the same
       syntax as C <u>printf</u> command. For example, you can use %04d to  make  the  frame  number  four  digit  with
       proceedings  zeros.  You  can  select  the frames using the following options (the options must be always
       given after the file name):

       <b>--frames</b> <b>&lt;range&gt;</b>
              Range is given in mathlab / octave format:

              <b>startframe:step:endframe</b>

              Frame numbers start with <b>startframe</b> (default 0), are increased by <b>step</b> (default  1)  and  stop  at
              <b>endframe</b>  You  can skip one of those values, for example <u>1:100</u> for frames 1,2,...,100 and <u>0:2:</u> for
              frame 0,2,4,... up to the last file that exists.

       <b>--skip-missing</b>
              Skip up to ten frames in a row if corresponding files are missing.  Otherwise  the  program  stops
              reading  sequence  at the first file that does not exists. This switch does not apply to the first
              frame in a sequence. This switch can be useful if there is a rendered animation where some of  the
              frame has not been generated.

       <b>--linear</b>
              Ignored for compatibility with <u>pfsinppm</u>.

       <b>--radiance,</b> <b>-r</b>
              Correct  stored  values  so  that the luminance is reported the same in pfsview and radiance tools
              (xview or Photospheare). See IMPORTANT NOTE below.

       <b>--quiet,</b> <b>-q</b>
              Disable warning message about the change in handling absolute values in RGBE files. See  IMPORTANT
              NOTE below.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       pfsinrgbe intro%d.hdr frame%d.hdr | ...

              Concatenate two animations into one and pass it to pipe for further processing.

</pre><h4><b>IMPORTANT</b> <b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       There  is  an  incompatibility  between viewers of RGBE format in terms of absolute luminance values. The
       ximage viewer from Radiance package expects radiance values in RGBE files and  multiplies  the  resulting
       luminance by the WHITE_EFFICACY constant equal to 179.0f to convert from radiance to luminance.

       To  remain  compatible with Radiance (xview and Photospheare), pfstools prior to 1.9.0 divided red, green
       and blue values by 179 on writing and multiplied by that constant on reading RGBE  files.  This  in  turn
       caused  incompatibility  with  other  software,  such as Photoshop or HDR toolbox. Starting from pfstools
       1.9.0 this division / multiplication step was removed to make pfstools compatible in  terms  of  absolute
       values with the majority of the software. The downside is that this change made luminance units) with the
       pfstools  1.9.0  or later. To avoid any mistakes because of that change, a long warning messages is shown
       each time pfsinrgbe or pfsoutrgbe is called. The message can be suppressed with --quiet option.

       To enable the old functionality and read or write RGBE files with the correction for WHITE_EFFICACY,  add
       --radiance option to the command line.
