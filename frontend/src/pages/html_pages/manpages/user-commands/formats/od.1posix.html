</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       od <b>[</b>-v<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-A <u>address_base</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-j <u>skip</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-N <u>count</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-t <u>type_string</u><b>]</b>...

       od <b>[</b>-bcdosx<b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>file</u><b>]</b> <b>[[</b>+<b>]</b><u>offset</u><b>[</b>.<b>][</b>b<b>]]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>od</u> utility shall write the contents of its input files to standard output in a user-specified format.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>od</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u> <u>Syntax</u>
       <u>Guidelines</u>,  except  that  the  order  of  presentation  of  the  <b>-t</b>  options  and the <b>-bcdosx</b> options is
       significant.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-A</b> <u>address_base</u>
                 Specify the input offset base. See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION  section.   The  application  shall
                 ensure  that  the <u>address_base</u> option-argument is a character. The characters <b>'d'</b>, <b>'o'</b>, and <b>'x'</b>
                 specify that the offset base shall be written in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal,  respectively.
                 The character <b>'n'</b> specifies that the offset shall not be written.

       <b>-b</b>        Interpret bytes in octal. This shall be equivalent to <b>-t</b> <b>o1</b>.

       <b>-c</b>        Interpret  bytes  as  characters  specified  by  the  current setting of the <u>LC_CTYPE</u> category.
                 Certain non-graphic characters appear  as  C  escapes:  <b>"NUL=\0"</b>,  <b>"BS=\b"</b>,  <b>"FF=\f"</b>,  <b>"NL=\n"</b>,
                 <b>"CR=\r"</b>, <b>"HT=\t"</b>; others appear as 3-digit octal numbers.

       <b>-d</b>        Interpret <u>word</u>s (two-byte units) in unsigned decimal. This shall be equivalent to <b>-t</b> <b>u2</b>.

       <b>-j</b> <u>skip</u>   Jump  over  <u>skip</u>  bytes from the beginning of the input. The <u>od</u> utility shall read or seek past
                 the first <u>skip</u> bytes in the concatenated input files. If the combined input  is  not  at  least
                 <u>skip</u>  bytes  long,  the  <u>od</u> utility shall write a diagnostic message to standard error and exit
                 with a non-zero exit status.

                 By default, the <u>skip</u> option-argument shall be interpreted as a decimal number. With  a  leading
                 0x  or  0X,  the offset shall be interpreted as a hexadecimal number; otherwise, with a leading
                 <b>'0'</b>, the offset shall be interpreted as an octal number. Appending the character <b>'b'</b>,  <b>'k'</b>,  or
                 <b>'m'</b>  to  offset  shall cause it to be interpreted as a multiple of 512, 1024, or 1048576 bytes,
                 respectively. If the <u>skip</u> number is hexadecimal, any appended <b>'b'</b> shall be considered to be the
                 final hexadecimal digit.

       <b>-N</b> <u>count</u>  Format no more than <u>count</u> bytes of input. By default, <u>count</u> shall be interpreted as  a  decimal
                 number. With a leading 0x or 0X, <u>count</u> shall be interpreted as a hexadecimal number; otherwise,
                 with  a leading <b>'0'</b>, it shall be interpreted as an octal number. If <u>count</u> bytes of input (after
                 successfully skipping, if <b>-j</b> <u>skip</u> is specified) are not available, it shall not  be  considered
                 an error; the <u>od</u> utility shall format the input that is available.

       <b>-o</b>        Interpret <u>word</u>s (two-byte units) in octal. This shall be equivalent to <b>-t</b> <b>o2</b>.

       <b>-s</b>        Interpret <u>word</u>s (two-byte units) in signed decimal. This shall be equivalent to <b>-t</b> <b>d2</b>.

       <b>-t</b> <u>type_string</u>
                 Specify  one  or more output types. See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section. The application shall
                 ensure that the <u>type_string</u> option-argument is a string specifying the types to  be  used  when
                 writing  the input data. The string shall consist of the type specification characters <b>a</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>d</b>,
                 <b>f</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, and <b>x</b>, specifying named character, character, signed decimal, floating  point,  octal,
                 unsigned  decimal, and hexadecimal, respectively. The type specification characters <b>d</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>,
                 and <b>x</b> can be followed by an optional unsigned decimal integer  that  specifies  the  number  of
                 bytes to be transformed by each instance of the output type. The type specification character <b>f</b>
                 can  be  followed by an optional <b>F</b>, <b>D</b>, or <b>L</b> indicating that the conversion should be applied to
                 an item of type <b>float</b>, <b>double</b>, or <b>long</b> <b>double</b>, respectively. The type specification  characters
                 <b>d</b>,  <b>o</b>,  <b>u</b>,  and  <b>x</b>  can be followed by an optional <b>C</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>I</b>, or <b>L</b> indicating that the conversion
                 should be applied to an item of type <b>char</b>, <b>short</b>, <b>int</b>, or <b>long</b>,  respectively.  Multiple  types
                 can  be  concatenated  within  the  same  <u>type_string</u> and multiple <b>-t</b> options can be specified.
                 Output lines shall be written  for  each  type  specified  in  the  order  in  which  the  type
                 specification characters are specified.

       <b>-v</b>        Write  all input data. Without the <b>-v</b> option, any number of groups of output lines, which would
                 be identical to the immediately preceding group of output lines (except for the byte  offsets),
                 shall be replaced with a line containing only an &lt;asterisk&gt; (<b>'*'</b>).

       <b>-x</b>        Interpret <u>word</u>s (two-byte units) in hexadecimal. This shall be equivalent to <b>-t</b> <b>x2</b>.

       Multiple  types  can  be  specified by using multiple <b>-bcdostx</b> options. Output lines are written for each
       type specified in the order in which the types are specified.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>file</u>      A pathname of a file to be read. If no <u>file</u> operands are specified, the standard input shall be
                 used.

                 If there are no more than two operands, none of the <b>-A</b>, <b>-j</b>, <b>-N</b>, <b>-t</b>, or <b>-v</b> options is specified,
                 and either of the following is true: the first character of the last operand is  a  &lt;plus-sign&gt;
                 (<b>'+'</b>),  or  there  are two operands and the first character of the last operand is numeric; the
                 last operand shall be interpreted as an offset operand on XSI-conformant systems.  Under  these
                 conditions, the results are unspecified on systems that are not XSI-conformant systems.

       <b>[+]</b><u>offset</u><b>[.][b]</b>
                 The <u>offset</u> operand specifies the offset in the file where dumping is to commence.  This operand
                 is normally interpreted as octal bytes. If <b>'.'</b>  is appended, the offset shall be interpreted in
                 decimal. If <b>'b'</b> is appended, the offset shall be interpreted in units of 512 bytes.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The  standard  input shall be used if no <u>file</u> operands are specified, and shall be used if a <u>file</u> operand
       is <b>'-'</b> and the implementation treats the <b>'-'</b> as meaning standard input.  Otherwise,  the  standard  input
       shall not be used.  See the INPUT FILES section.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The input files can be any file type.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>od</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>LC_NUMERIC</u>
                 Determine the locale for  selecting  the  radix  character  used  when  writing  floating-point
                 formatted output.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>od</u>  utility  shall copy sequentially each input file to standard output, transforming the input data
       according to the output types specified by the <b>-t</b> option or the <b>-bcdosx</b> options.  If no  output  type  is
       specified, the default output shall be as if <b>-t</b> <b>oS</b> had been specified.

       The  number of bytes transformed by the output type specifier <b>c</b> may be variable depending on the <u>LC_CTYPE</u>
       category.

       The default number of bytes transformed by output type specifiers <b>d</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, and <b>x</b>  corresponds  to  the
       various C-language types as follows. If the <u>c99</u> compiler is present on the system, these specifiers shall
       correspond  to  the sizes used by default in that compiler. Otherwise, these sizes may vary among systems
       that conform to POSIX.1‐2008.

        *  For the type specifier characters <b>d</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, and <b>x</b>, the default number of bytes shall correspond to the
           size of the underlying implementation's basic integer  type.  For  these  specifier  characters,  the
           implementation  shall support values of the optional number of bytes to be converted corresponding to
           the number of bytes in the C-language types <b>char</b>, <b>short</b>, <b>int</b>, and <b>long</b>.  These numbers  can  also  be
           specified   by  an  application  as  the  characters  <b>'C'</b>,  <b>'S'</b>,  <b>'I'</b>,  and  <b>'L'</b>,  respectively.  The
           implementation shall also support the values 1, 2, 4, and 8, even if it provides no C-Language  types
           of  those  sizes.  The implementation shall support the decimal value corresponding to the C-language
           type <b>long</b> <b>long</b>.  The byte order used when interpreting numeric values is implementation-defined,  but
           shall  correspond  to  the order in which a constant of the corresponding type is stored in memory on
           the system.

        *  For the type specifier character <b>f</b>, the default number of bytes shall correspond  to  the  number  of
           bytes  in  the  underlying  implementation's  basic  double  precision  floating-point data type. The
           implementation shall support values of the optional number of bytes to be converted corresponding  to
           the  number  of bytes in the C-language types <b>float,</b> <b>double</b>, and <b>long</b> <b>double</b>.  These numbers can also
           be specified by an application as the characters <b>'F'</b>, <b>'D'</b>, and <b>'L'</b>, respectively.

       The type specifier character <b>a</b> specifies that bytes shall be interpreted as  named  characters  from  the
       International  Reference Version (IRV) of the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard. Only the least significant seven
       bits of each byte shall be used for this  type  specification.  Bytes  with  the  values  listed  in  the
       following table shall be written using the corresponding names for those characters.

                                             <b>Table:</b> <b>Named</b> <b>Characters</b> <b>in</b> <u>od</u>

       <b>Note:</b>     The <b>"\012"</b> value may be written either as <b>lf</b> or <b>nl</b>.

       The  type  specifier character <b>c</b> specifies that bytes shall be interpreted as characters specified by the
       current setting of the <u>LC_CTYPE</u> locale category. Characters listed in the table in the  Base  Definitions
       volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Chapter</u> <u>5</u>, <u>File</u> <u>Format</u> <u>Notation</u> (<b>'\\'</b>, <b>'\a'</b>, <b>'\b'</b>, <b>'\f'</b>, <b>'\n'</b>, <b>'\r'</b>, <b>'\t'</b>, <b>'\v'</b>)
       shall be written as the corresponding escape sequences, except that &lt;backslash&gt; shall  be  written  as  a
       single  &lt;backslash&gt;  and a NUL shall be written as <b>'\0'</b>.  Other non-printable characters shall be written
       as one three-digit octal number for each byte in the character. Printable multi-byte characters shall  be
       written  in  the  area  corresponding to the first byte of the character; the two-character sequence <b>"**"</b>
       shall be written in the area corresponding to each remaining byte in the character, as an indication that
       the character is continued. When either the <b>-j</b> <u>skip</u> or <b>-N</b> <u>count</u> option is specified along with the <b>c</b> type
       specifier, and this results in an attempt to start or finish in the middle of a multi-byte character, the
       result is implementation-defined.

       The input data shall be manipulated in blocks, where a block is defined as a multiple of the least common
       multiple of the number of bytes transformed by the specified output types. If the least  common  multiple
       is greater than 16, the results are unspecified. Each input block shall be written as transformed by each
       output  type, one per written line, in the order that the output types were specified. If the input block
       size is larger than the  number  of  bytes  transformed  by  the  output  type,  the  output  type  shall
       sequentially  transform  the  parts  of  the input block, and the output from each of the transformations
       shall be separated by one or more &lt;blank&gt; characters.

       If, as a result of the specification of the <b>-N</b> option or end-of-file being  reached  on  the  last  input
       file,  input  data only partially satisfies an output type, the input shall be extended sufficiently with
       null bytes to write the last byte of the input.

       Unless <b>-A</b> <b>n</b> is specified, the first output line produced for each input block shall be  preceded  by  the
       input  offset,  cumulative  across  input  files, of the next byte to be written. The format of the input
       offset is unspecified; however, it shall not contain any &lt;blank&gt; characters, shall  start  at  the  first
       character  of  the output line, and shall be followed by one or more &lt;blank&gt; characters. In addition, the
       offset of the byte following the last byte written shall be written after all the  input  data  has  been
       processed, but shall not be followed by any &lt;blank&gt; characters.

       If no <b>-A</b> option is specified, the input offset base is unspecified.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    All input files were processed successfully.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       XSI-conformant applications are warned not to use filenames starting with <b>'+'</b> or a first operand starting
       with  a numeric character so that the old functionality can be maintained by implementations, unless they
       specify one of the <b>-A</b>, <b>-j</b>, or <b>-N</b> options. To guarantee that one of these filenames is always  interpreted
       as a filename, an application could always specify the address base format with the <b>-A</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       If  a  file  containing  128  bytes  with decimal values zero to 127, in increasing order, is supplied as
       standard input to the command:

           od -A d -t a

       on an implementation using an input block size of 16 bytes,  the  standard  output,  independent  of  the
       current locale setting, would be similar to:

           0000000 nul soh stx etx eot enq ack bel  bs  ht  nl  vt  ff  cr  so  si

       Note  that  this  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017 allows <b>nl</b> or <b>lf</b> to be used as the name for the ISO/IEC 646:1991
       standard IRV character with decimal  value  10.  The  IRV  names  this  character  <b>lf</b>  (line  feed),  but
       traditional  implementations  have  referred  to  this  character  as  newline  (<b>nl</b>) and the POSIX locale
       character set symbolic name for the corresponding character is a &lt;newline&gt;.

       The command:

           od -A o -t o2x2x -N 18

       on a system with 32-bit words and an implementation using an input block size of 16 bytes could write  18
       bytes in approximately the following format:

           0000000 032056 031440 041123 042040 052516 044530 020043 031464

       on  a  system with 64-bit doubles (for example, IEEE Std 754‐1985 double precision floating-point format)
       would skip 21 bytes of input data and then write 24 bytes in approximately the following format:

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>od</u> utility went through several names in  early  proposals,  including  <u>hd</u>,  <u>xd</u>,  and  most  recently
       <u>hexdump</u>.  There were several objections to all of these based on the following reasons:

        *  The <u>hd</u> and <u>xd</u> names conflicted with historical utilities that behaved differently.

        *  The <u>hexdump</u> description was much more complex than needed for a simple dump utility.

        *  The <u>od</u> utility has been available on all historical implementations and there was no need to create a
           new name for a utility so similar to the historical <u>od</u> utility.

       The  original  reasons for not standardizing historical <u>od</u> were also fairly widespread. Those reasons are
       given below along with rationale explaining why the standard developers believe that  this  version  does
       not suffer from the indicated problem:

        *  The  BSD and System V versions of <u>od</u> have diverged, and the intersection of features provided by both
           does not meet the needs of the user community.  In  fact,  the  System  V  version  only  provides  a
           mechanism for dumping octal bytes and <b>short</b>s, signed and unsigned decimal <b>short</b>s, hexadecimal <b>short</b>s,
           and  ASCII  characters.  BSD  added  the ability to dump <b>float</b>s, <b>double</b>s, named ASCII characters, and
           octal, signed decimal, unsigned decimal, and hexadecimal <b>long</b>s.  The version presented here  provides
           more  normalized  forms for dumping bytes, <b>short</b>s, <b>int</b>s, and <b>long</b>s in octal, signed decimal, unsigned
           decimal, and hexadecimal; <b>float</b>, <b>double</b>, and <b>long</b> <b>double</b>; and named ASCII as well as  current  locale
           characters.

        *  It would not be possible to come up with a compatible superset of the BSD and System V flags that met
           the  requirements  of  the  standard  developers.  The  historical default <u>od</u> output is the specified
           default output of this utility. None of the option letters chosen for this  version  of  <u>od</u>  conflict
           with any of the options to historical versions of <u>od</u>.

        *  On  systems with different sizes for <b>short</b>, <b>int</b>, and <b>long</b>, there was no way to ask for dumps of <b>int</b>s,
           even in the BSD version. Because of the way options are named, the name space could not  be  extended
           to  solve  these  problems.  This  is  why the <b>-t</b> option was added (with type specifiers more closely
           matched to the <u>printf</u>() formats used in the rest of this volume of  POSIX.1‐2017)  and  the  optional
           field  sizes  were  added to the <b>d</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>u</b>, and <b>x</b> type specifiers. It is also one of the reasons why
           the historical practice was not mandated as a required obsolescent form of  <u>od</u>.   (Although  the  old
           versions  of  <u>od</u>  are  not  listed  as  an obsolescent form, implementations are urged to continue to
           recognize the older forms for several more years.) The <b>a</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>o</b>, and <b>x</b> types match the  meaning  of
           the  corresponding  format  characters in the historical implementations of <u>od</u> except for the default
           sizes of the fields converted. The <b>d</b> format is signed in this volume of  POSIX.1‐2017  to  match  the
           <u>printf</u>() notation. (Historical versions of <u>od</u> used <b>d</b> as a synonym for <b>u</b> in this version. The System V
           implementation  uses  <b>s</b>  for  signed decimal; BSD uses <b>i</b> for signed decimal and <b>s</b> for null-terminated
           strings.) Other than <b>d</b> and <b>u</b>, all of the type specifiers match format characters  in  the  historical
           BSD version of <b>od</b>.

           The  sizes  of  the  C-language types <b>char</b>, <b>short</b>, <b>int</b>, <b>long</b>, <b>float</b>, <b>double</b>, and <b>long</b> <b>double</b> are used
           even though it is recognized that there may be zero or more than one compiler for the C  language  on
           an  implementation  and  that they may use different sizes for some of these types. (For example, one
           compiler might use 2 bytes <b>short</b>s, 2 bytes <b>int</b>s, and 4 bytes <b>long</b>s, while  another  compiler  (or  an
           option  to  the  same  compiler) uses 2 bytes <b>short</b>s, 4 bytes <b>int</b>s, and 4 bytes <b>long</b>s.)  Nonetheless,
           there has to be a basic size known by the implementation for these types, corresponding to the values
           reported by invocations of the <u>getconf</u> utility when  called  with  <u>system_var</u>  operands  {UCHAR_MAX},
           {USHORT_MAX},  {UINT_MAX},  and  {ULONG_MAX}  for the types <b>char</b>, <b>short</b>, <b>int</b>, and <b>long</b>, respectively.
           There are similar constants required by the ISO C standard, but not required by the System Interfaces
           volume of POSIX.1‐2017 or this volume of POSIX.1‐2017. They are {FLT_MANT_DIG},  {DBL_MANT_DIG},  and
           {LDBL_MANT_DIG}  for  the  types  <b>float</b>,  <b>double</b>,  and <b>long</b> <b>double</b>, respectively. If the optional <u>c99</u>
           utility is provided by the implementation and used as specified by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, these
           are the sizes that would be provided. If an option is used that specifies different sizes  for  these
           types,  there  is  no guarantee that the <u>od</u> utility is able to interpret binary data output by such a
           program correctly.

           This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires that the numeric values of these lengths be recognized by the <u>od</u>
           utility and that symbolic forms also be recognized. Thus, a conforming application can always look at
           an array of <b>unsigned</b> <b>long</b> data elements using <u>od</u> <b>-t</b> <u>uL</u>.

        *  The method of specifying the format for the address field based on specifying a starting offset in  a
           file  unnecessarily  tied  the  two together. The <b>-A</b> option now specifies the address base and the <b>-S</b>
           option specifies a starting offset.

        *  It would be difficult to break the dependence on US ASCII to achieve an internationalized utility. It
           does not seem to be any harder for <u>od</u> to dump characters in the current locale than it is for the  <u>ed</u>
           or  <u>sed</u>  <b>l</b>  commands.  The <b>c</b> type specifier does this without difficulty and is completely compatible
           with the historical implementations of the <b>c</b> format character when the current locale uses a superset
           of the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard as a codeset. The <b>a</b> type specifier (from the BSD <b>a</b> format character)
           was left as a portable means to dump ASCII (or more correctly  ISO/IEC 646:1991  standard  (IRV))  so
           that headers produced by <u>pax</u> could be deciphered even on systems that do not use the ISO/IEC 646:1991
           standard as a subset of their base codeset.

       The  use  of  <b>"**"</b>  as  an indication of continuation of a multi-byte character in <b>c</b> specifier output was
       chosen based on seeing an implementation that uses this method. The continuation bytes have to be  marked
       in a way that is not ambiguous with another single-byte or multi-byte character.

       An early proposal used <b>-S</b> and <b>-n</b>, respectively, for the <b>-j</b> and <b>-N</b> options eventually selected. These were
       changed to avoid conflicts with historical implementations.

       The  original  standard specified <b>-t</b> <b>o2</b> as the default when no output type was given. This was changed to
       <b>-t</b> <b>oS</b> (the length of a <b>short</b>) to accommodate a supercomputer implementation  that  historically  used  64
       bits  as  its  default  (and  that  defined  shorts as 64 bits). This change should not affect conforming
       applications. The requirement to support lengths of 1, 2, and 4 was added at the same time to address  an
       historical implementation that had no two-byte data types in its C compiler.

       The  use  of  a  basic  integer  data  type is intended to allow the implementation to choose a word size
       commonly used by applications on that architecture.

       Earlier versions of this standard allowed for implementations with bytes other than eight bits, but  this
       has been modified in this version.
