</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sc_analysis_dump — dump of traceroute data in a format that is easily parsed.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sc_analysis_dump</b> [<b>-cCdeghHilMopQrstT</b>] [<b>-D</b> <u>debug-count</u>] [<b>-G</b> <u>geo-server</u>] [<b>-S</b> <u>skip-count</u>] [<u>file</u> <u>...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sc_analysis_dump</b>  utility  provides  a  dump of traceroute data in a format that is easily parsed by
       scripts.  Each line output contains a summary of a single trace, and includes the interfaces visited  and
       the  delay  of  each  response.   The  output format is identical to that of sk_analysis_dump from CAIDA,
       except that it uses the scamper file API to read both arts++ files produced by skitter  and  warts  files
       produced  by scamper.  The <b>sc_analysis_dump</b> utility only outputs traceroute data; for parsing other types
       of measurement, use <u><a href="../man1/sc_warts2json.1.html">sc_warts2json</a></u>(1) instead.  The options are as follows:

       <b>-c</b>      disables printing the cycle number in each line of output.

       <b>-C</b>      disables printing the comments about the output at the top of the output.

       <b>-d</b>      disables printing the destination address in each line of output.

       <b>-D</b> <u>debug-count</u>
               for each input file stop reading after the specified number of traces.

       <b>-e</b>      adds the response from the destination to each line of output.   Please  read  the  bugs  section
               below.

       <b>-g</b>      use geographical data from netacuity.  Not all builds of <b>sc_analysis_dump</b> support this option.

       <b>-G</b> <u>geo-server</u>
               specifies the name of the netacuity server to use.

       <b>-h</b>      prints a help message and then exits.

       <b>-H</b>      disables printing the halt fields: why traceroute halted and data for that reason.

       <b>-i</b>      disables printing the RTT to each hop, and how many tries were required.

       <b>-l</b>      disables printing the list id in each line of output.

       <b>-M</b>      prints any MPLS label stack objects embedded in ICMP responses.

       <b>-o</b>      prints each line of output using the old format from sk_analysis_dump 1.0.

       <b>-p</b>      disables print path data in each line of output.

       <b>-Q</b>      prints the IP-TTL from inside the ICMP quotation.

       <b>-r</b>      disables  printing  the  data associated the response from a destination: the RTT, the TTL of the
               probe, and the TTL of the response.

       <b>-s</b>      disables printing the source IP address in each line of output.

       <b>-S</b> <u>skip-count</u>
               skips the defined number of traces from each input file.

       <b>-t</b>      disables printing the timestamp of when the traceroute began.

       <b>-T</b>      prints the IP-TTL of the response packet.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       There is one trace per line.  Fields are separated by a tab character.  The  output  is  structured  into
       header  fields  (2  to  6),  reply  fields  (7  to  10)  corresponding  to the response received from the
       destination, halt fields (11 and 12), and hop fields (beginning at index 13).

             1.  Key

                 Indicates the type of line and determines the meaning  of  the  remaining  fields.   This  will
                 always be 'T' for an IP trace.

             2.  Source

                 Source IP of skitter/scamper monitor performing the trace.

             3.  Destination

                 Destination IP being traced.

             4.  ListId

                 ID  of the destination list containing this destination address.  This value will be zero if no
                 list ID was provided.  A ListId is a 32 bit unsigned integer.

             5.  CycleId

                 ID of current probing cycle.  A cycle is a single run through a given list.  A CycleId is a  32
                 bit  unsigned integer.  For skitter traces, cycle IDs will be equal to or slightly earlier than
                 the timestamp of the first trace in each cycle. There is no standard interpretation for scamper
                 cycle IDs.  This value will be zero if no cycle ID was provided.

             6.  Timestamp

                 Timestamp when trace began to this destination.

             7.  DestReplied

                 Whether a response from the destination was received.  The character R is printed  if  a  reply
                 was  received.   The  character  N  is printed if no reply was received.  Since skitter sends a
                 packet with a TTL of 255 when it halts probing, it is still possible for the final  destination
                 to  send  a  reply  and for the HaltReasonData (see below) to not equal no_halt.  Note: scamper
                 does not perform this last-ditch probing at TTL 255 by default.

             8.  DestRTT

                 The RTT (ms) of first response packet from destination.  This value is zero if  DestReplied  is
                 N.

             9.  RequestTTL

                 TTL  set  in  request packet which elicited a response (echo reply) from the destination.  This
                 value is zero if DestReplied is N.

             10. ReplyTTL

                 TTL found in reply packet from destination.  This value is zero if DestReplied is N.

             11. HaltReason

                 A single character corresponding to the reason, if any, why incremental probing stopped.  S  is
                 printed  if  the  destination  was  reached  or there is no halt data.  U is printed if an ICMP
                 unreachable message was received.  L is printed if a loop was detected.  G is  printed  if  the
                 gaplimit was reached.

             12. HaltReasonData

                 Extra data about why probing halted.  If HaltReason is S, the zero is output.  If HaltReason is
                 U,  the ICMP code of the unreachable message is printed.  If HaltReason is L, the length of the
                 loop is printed.  If HaltReason is G, the length of the gap is printed.

             13. PathComplete

                 Whether all hops to destination were found.  C is printed if the trace is  complete,  all  hops
                 are found.  I is printed if the trace is incomplete, at least one hop is missing (i.e., did not
                 respond).

             14. PerHopData

                 Response  data  for  each hop.  If multiple IP addresses respond at the same hop, response data
                 for each IP address are separated by semicolons:

                 IP,RTT,numTries (for only one responding IP) IP,RTT,numTries;IP,RTT,numTries;... (for  multiple
                 responding IPs)

                 where  IP  is the IP address which sent a TTL expired packet, RTT is the RTT of the TTL expired
                 packet, and numTries is the number of tries before a response was received from the TTL.

                 This field has the value 'q' if there was no response at a hop.

                 If the <b>-M</b> option is specified, any MPLS label stack objects embedded in the ICMP response  will
                 be  included in the following format, and the four fields correspond to each of the fields in a
                 MPLS header.

                    M|ttl|label|exp|s

                 If the ICMP response embeds more than one MPLS header, they are  given  one  at  a  time,  each
                 starting with an M.

                 If  the  <b>-Q</b> option is specified, the TTL value found in a quoted IP packet is included with the
                 following format:

                    Q|ttl

                 If the <b>-T</b> option is specified, the TTL value of  the  response  packet  is  included  with  the
                 following format:

                    T|ttl

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The command:

          sc_analysis_dump file1.warts file2.warts

       will  decode  and  print  the  traceroute  objects  in file1.warts, followed by the traceroute objects in
       file2.warts.

       The command:

          gzcat file1.warts.gz | sc_analysis_dump

       will decode and print the traceroute objects in the uncompressed file supplied on stdin.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       When the <b>-e</b> option is used, any unresponsive hops between the last responding router and the  destination
       are not printed, which could imply an IP link where none exists.  Use <u><a href="../man1/sc_warts2json.1.html">sc_warts2json</a></u>(1) instead.
