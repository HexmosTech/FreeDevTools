       grk_compress - compresses images to JPEG 2000 format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>grk_compress</b> [<b>-i</b> infile.bmp] [<b>-o</b> outfile.j2k]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program converts non-JPEG 2000 images to the JPEG 2000 format.

       • Supported input formats: JPEG, BMP, PNM, PGX, PNG, RAW, RAWL and TIFF

       • Supported  input  image  extensions: jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, .pgm, .pgx, .pnm, .ppm, .pam, .png, .raw, .rawl,
         .tif and .tiff

       • Supported output formats: JP2 and J2K/J2C

       • Supported output image extensions: .jp2 and .j2k/.j2c

       • For PNG the library must have libpng available.

       • For TIF/TIFF the library must have libtiff available.

       • For JPG/JPEG the library must have a libjpeg variant available.

       limitations

       • grk_compress supports up to and including 16 bit sample precision for input images.  This is  a  subset
         of the ISO standard, which allows up to 38 bit precision.

       stdin

       Input  from  stdin  is  supported for the following formats: PNG, JPG, RAW and RAWL.  To read from stdin,
       make sure that the -i parameter is <b>not</b> present, and that the -in_fmt parameter is set to one of the  sup‐
       ported formats listed above.

       Embedded ICC Profile (JP2 Only)

       If  there is an embedded ICC profile in the input file, then the profile will be stored in the compressed
       file.

       IPTC (JP2 Only)

       If an input TIF/TIFF file contains IPTC metadata, this metadata will be stored in the compressed file.

       XMP (JP2 Only)

       If an input TIF/TIFF or PNG file contains XMP metadata, this metadata will be stored  in  the  compressed
       file.

       Exif (JP2 only)

       To  transfer  Exif  and  all  other meta-data tags, use the command line argument -V described below.  To
       transfer the tags, Grok uses the wonderful ExifTool (https://exiftool.org/) Perl module.   ExifTool  must
       be installed for this command line argument to work properly.  Note: transferring Exif tags may add a few
       hundred ms to the decompress time, depending on the system.

       When only the input and output files are specified, the following default option values are used:

              * lossless compression
              * reversible DWT 5-3
              * single quality layer
              * single tile
              * precinct size : 2^15 x 2^15 (i.e. only 1 precinct)
              * code block dimensions : 64 x 64
              * number of resolutions (i.e. DWT decomposition levels + 1) : 6
              * no SOP markers
              * no EPH markers
              * default encode mode
              * progression order : `LRCP`
              * no ROI up-shifted
              * no image origin offset
              * no tile origin offset

       <b>Important</b>  <b>note</b> <b>on</b> <b>command</b> <b>line</b> <b>argument</b> <b>notation</b> <b>below</b>: the outer square braces appear for clarity only,
       and <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be included in the actual command line argument.  Square braces appearing inside the outer
       braces <b>should</b> be included.

   <b>Options</b>
       -h, -help

       Print a help message and exit.

       -version

       Print library version and exit.

       -v, -verbose

       Output information and warnings about encoding to console (errors are always output).  Default  is  false
       i.e. console is silent by default.

       -i, -in_file [file]

       Input  file.   Either  this  argument or the -in_dir argument described below is required.  See above for
       supported input formats.

       • PNG requires libpng while TIF/TIFF requires libtiff

       • JPG requires libjpeg (or libjpeg-turbo), and only 8 bit precision is supported

       • For BMP format, the coder accepts 24 bits color images and 8 bits (RLE or no-RLE) images

       • TIF files can have up to 16 bits per component.

       • For RAW or RAWL (RAW Little endian) images, the -F parameter must be used (see below).  In the case  of
         raw  images with a component depth value between 9 and 16 bits, each component’s data must be stored on
         two bytes (RAW format assumes big endian-ness, RAWL assumes little endian-ness) When using this option,
         the output file must be specified using -o.

       -o, -out_file [file]

       Output file.  Required when using -i option.  Valid output image extensions are J2K, JP2 and J2C.

       -y, -in_dir [input directory]

       Path to the folder where the images to be compressed are stored.  Either this argument or the -i argument
       described above is required.  When image files are in the same directory as the executable, this  can  be
       indicated by a dot . argument.  When using this option, output format must be specified using -O.

       -a, -out_dir [output directory]

       Output  directory  where  compressed  files are stored.  Only relevant when the -in_dir flag is set.  De‐
       fault: same directory as specified by -y.

       -O, -out_fmt [J2K|J2C|JP2]

       Output format used to compress the images read from the directory specified with -in_dir.  Required  when
       -in_dir option is used.  Supported formats are J2K, J2C, and JP2.

       -K, -in_fmt [pbm|pgm|ppm|pnm|pam|pgx|png|bmp|tif|raw|rawl|jpg]

       Input format.  Will override file tag.

       -F, -raw [width,height,number of components,bit depth,[s,u]@&lt;dx1&gt;x&lt;dy1&gt;:...:&lt;dxn&gt;x&lt;dyn&gt;]

       Raw  input image characteristics.  Required only if RAW or RAWL (RAW little endian) input file is provid‐
       ed.  Note: If sub-sampling is omitted, 1x1 is assumed for all components.

       Example of a raw 512x512 unsigned image with 4:2:0 sub-sampling

                 -F 512,512,3,8,u@1x1:2x2:2x2

       -A, -rate_control_algorithm [0|1]

       Select algorithm used for rate control.  * 0: Bisection search for optimal threshold using all code pass‐
       es in code blocks.  Slightly higher PSNR than algorithm 1.  * 1: Bisection search for  optimal  threshold
       using only feasible truncation points, on convex hull (default).  Faster than algorithm 0.

       -r, -compression_ratios [&lt;compression ratio&gt;,&lt;compression ratio&gt;,...]

       Note: not supported for Part 15 (HTJ2K) compression

       Compression  ratio  values  (double  precision, greater than or equal to one).  Each value is a factor of
       compression, thus 20 means 20 times compressed.  Each value represents a quality layer.  The  order  used
       to  define  the different levels of compression is important and must be from left to right in descending
       order.  A final lossless quality layer (including all remaining code passes) will  be  signified  by  the
       value 1.  Default: 1 single lossless quality layer.

       -q, -quality [quality in dB,quality in dB,...]

       Note: not supported for Part 15 (HTJ2K) compression

       Quality values (double precision, greater than or equal to zero).  Each value is a PSNR measure, given in
       dB,  representing  a  quality layer.  The order used to define the different PSNR values is important and
       must be from left to right in ascending order.  A value of 0 signifies a  final  lossless  quality  layer
       (including all remaining code passes) Default: 1 single lossless quality layer.

       -n, -num_resolutions [number of resolutions]

       Number of resolutions.  It corresponds to the number of DWT decompositions +1.  Default: 6.

       -b, -code_block_dims [code block width,code block height]

       Code-block  size.  The dimension must respect the constraint defined in the JPEG-2000 standard (no dimen‐
       sion smaller than 4 or greater than 1024, no code-block with more than 4096 coefficients).   The  maximum
       value authorized is 64x64.  Default: 64x64.

       -c, -precinct_dims [  [prec width,prec height],[prec width,prec height],... ]

       Precinct  dimensions.   Dimensions  specified must be powers of 2.  Multiple records may be specified, in
       which case the first record refers to the highest resolution level and subsequent records refer to  lower
       resolution  levels.   The  last  specified record’s dimensions are progressively right-shifted (halved in
       size) for each remaining lower resolution level.  Default: 2^15x2^15 at  each  resolution  i.e. precincts
       are not used.  Note: the inner square brackets must actually be present.

       Example for image with 6 resolutions :

       -c [256,256],[256,256],[256,256],[256,256],[256,256],[256,256]

       -t, -tile_dims [tile width,tile height]

       Tile size.  Default: the dimension of the whole image, thus only one tile.

       -L, -PLT

       Use PLT markers.  Default: off

       -X, -TLM

       Use TLM markers.  Default: off

       -I, -irreversible

       Irreversible  compression  (ICT  +  DWT  9-7).  This option enables the Irreversible Color Transformation
       (ICT) in place of the Reversible Color Transformation (RCT) and the irreversible DWT 9-7 in place of  the
       5-3 filter.  Default: off.

       -p, -progression_order [progression order]

       Progression order.  The five progression orders are : LRCP, RLCP, RPCL, PCRL and CPRL.  Default: LRCP.

       -Z, -rsiz [rsiz]

       Profile,  main level, sub level and version.  Note: this flag will be ignored if cinema profile flags are
       used.

       -N, -guard_bits [number of guard bits]

       Number of guard bits to use in block coder.  Must be between 0 and 7.

       -w, -cinema2K [24|48]

       2K digital cinema profile.  This option generates a codes stream compliant with  the  DCI  specifications
       for  2K  resolution  content.   The value given is the frame rate, which can be either 24 or 48 fps.  The
       main specifications of the JPEG 2000 Profile-3 (2K Digital Cinema Profile) are:

       -U, -broadcast [PROFILE [,mainlevel=X][,framerate=FPS] ]

       Broadcast compliant code stream

       • PROFILE must be one of { SINGLE, MULTI, MULTI_R}

       • X must be between 0 and 11

       number end,component number end,progression order/T&lt;tile number 1&gt;= ...]

       Progression  order change.  This specifies a list of progression orders and their bounds if a progression
       order change is desired.  Note: there must be at least two progression orders specified.

       Example: -POC T0=0,0,1,3,2,CPRL/T0=0,0,1,6,3,CPRL

       -S, -SOP

       SOP marker is added before each packet.  Default: no SOP.

       -E, -EPH

       EPH marker is added after each packet header.  Default: no EPH.

       -M, -mode [value]

       Non-default encode modes.  There are 7 modes available.  The first six are:

       • BYPASS(LAZY) [1]

       • RESET [2]

       • RESTART(TERMALL) [4]

       • VSC [8]

       • ERTERM(SEGTERM) [16]

       • SEGMARK(SEGSYM) [32]

       • HT [64]

       and they can be combined together.  If more than one mode is used, the values  between  the  brackets  []
       must be added together.  Default: no mode.

              Example : <a href="../man4/RESTART.4.html">RESTART</a>(4) + <a href="../man2/RESET.2.html">RESET</a>(2) + <a href="../man32/SEGMARK.32.html">SEGMARK</a>(32) =&gt; -M 38

       Mode HT [64], for High Throughput encoding, <u>cannot</u> be combined with any of the other flags.

       -u, -tile_parts [R|L|C]

       Divide  packets  of every tile into tile-parts.  The division is made by grouping Resolutions (R), Layers
       (L) or Components (C).  The type of division is specified by setting the single letter R, L, or C as  the
       value for this flag.

       -R, -ROI [c=component index,U=upshifting value]

       Quantization indices upshifted for a component.

       Warning: This option does not implement the usual ROI (Region of Interest).  It should be understood as a
       “Component  of Interest”.  It offers the possibility to upshift the value of a component during quantiza‐
       tion step.  The value after c= is the component number [0, 1, 2, ...] and the value after U= is the value
       of upshifting.  U must be in the range [0, 37].

       -d, -image_offset [x offset,y offset]

       Offset of the image origin.  The division in tile could be modified as the anchor point for  tiling  will
       be different than the image origin.  Keep in mind that the offset of the image can not be higher than the
       tile dimension if the tile option is used.  The two values are respectively for X and Y axis offset.  De‐
       fault: no offset.

       -T, -tile_offset [x offset,y offset]

       Offset  of  the  tile  origin.  The two values are respectively for X and Y axis offset.  The tile anchor
       point can not be inside the image area.  Default: no offset.

       -Y, -MCT [0|1|2]

       Specify explicitly if a Multiple Component Transform has to be used.

       • 0: no MCT

       • 1: RGB-&gt;YCC conversion

       • 2: custom MCT.

       For custom MCT, -m option has to be used (see below).  By default, RGB-&gt;YCC conversion is used  if  there
       are three components or more, otherwise no conversion.

       -m, -custom_mct [file]

       Use  custom array-based MCT of 32 bit signed values, comma separated, line-by-line no specific separators
       between lines, no space allowed between values.  If this option is used, it automatically sets  [-Y|-mct]
       option equal to 2.

       -V, -transfer_exif_tags

       Transfer all Exif tags to output file.

       Notes:

       1. ExifTool (https://exiftool.org/) must be installed for this command line argument to function correct‐
          ly.

       2. Only  supported  on  Linux.   On  other  platforms, exiftool can be used directly after compression to
          transfer tags:

       exiftool -TagsFromFile src.tif "-all:all&gt;all:all" dest.jp2

       -Q, -capture_res [capture resolution X,capture resolution Y]

       Capture resolution in pixels/metre, in double precision.

       • If the input image has a resolution stored in its header, then this resolution will be set as the  cap‐
         ture resolution, by default.

       • If  the  -Q command line parameter is set, then it will override the resolution stored in the input im‐
         age, if present

       • The special values [0,0] for -Q will force the encoder to <b>not</b> store capture resolution, even if present
         in input image.

       -D, -display_res [display resolution X,display resolution Y]

       Display resolution in pixels/metre, in double precision.  The special values [0,0] for -D will force  the
       encoder to set the display resolution equal to the capture resolution.

       -C, -comment [comment]

       Add  &lt;comment&gt;  in comment marker segment(s).  Multiple comments (up to a total of 256) can be specified,
       separated by the | character.  For example: -C "This is my first comment|This is  my  second  will  store
       This  is  my first comment in the first comment marker segment, and This is my second in a second comment
       marker.

       -W, -logfile [output file name]

       Log to file.  File name will be set to output file name

       -H, -num_threads [number of threads]

       Number of threads used for T1 compression.  Default is total number of logical cores.

       -J, -duration [duration]

       Duration in seconds for a batch compress job.  grk_compress will exit when duration has been reached.

       -e, -repetitions [number of repetitions]

       Number of repetitions, for either a single image, or a folder of images.  Default value is 1.   Unlimited
       repetitions are specified by a value of 0.
