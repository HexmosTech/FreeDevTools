</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       stx2any - converter from structured text to multiple formats

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       stx2any [ -T <u>format</u> ] [ <u>stx</u> <u>and</u> <u>m4</u> <u>options</u> ] [ <u>file</u>  <u>file</u> ... ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       stx2any converts files in structured text (Stx) format into other formats.  Formats currently implemented
       are HTML, man, raw text, PostScript, LaTeX, XHTML and DocBook XML.

       The  source format, structured text, is a kind of plain text format with standard markup for representing
       headings, lists, emphasis etc.  The markup  is  both  quicker  to  write  and  easier  to  remember  than
       conventional  tag-based  markup languages, and is beautifully legible also in source form.  Stx markup is
       better explained in <u>Stx</u> <u>quickie</u> <u>guide</u>, which is available in the examples directory.

       Most of the conversion happens in m4, and you can define your own  macros  and  other  stuff  for  giving
       structure to your documents.  stx2any provides a LaTeX-like extensible environment system and a diversion
       system for rearranging input.  (Tårta på tårta, as they say in Swedish.)

       Because  stx2any  doesn't  perform  any  kind of quoting on the input, markup that isn't available can be
       written directly in the destination language (losing convertibility to multiple languages).  This way, if
       you are only interested in one output format (eg. LaTeX), you can use Stx as an abbreviation  format  for
       the most common constructs.

       Some  formatting is not available as abbreviations, but by calling m4 macros.  You need macros relatively
       rarely: for example, floats (material that can “float” around in the document) are created by macros.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       stx2any accepts all command line options of m4, passing them directly on.  Of these, the -D  argument  is
       important enough to mention here separately.

          -DNAME=VALUE
                 Define  macro  NAME  to have the expansion VALUE.  This allows you to pass information into the
                 document from the command line.

          -T <u>format</u>
                 Sets the output format.  Default format is html.  <u>format</u> should be one of:

             html   produces basic HTML (hypertext markup language) output.

             man    produces man macro output.  This output is usable as  a  man  page  directly  (although  see
                    WRITING MAN PAGES below), or can be fed to troff / groff for formatting to e.g.  postscript.

             latex  produces  LaTeX  document  preparation  language output.  You can run latex on the result to
                    produce e.g. high quality pdf's.

             text   produces raw text output by postprocessing HTML output with w3m.  The  resulting  output  is
                    very basic, like stripping away most Stx markup; if you want more formatted output, consider
                    piping man output to nroff -man.

             ps     produces  simple  postscript output by postprocessing man output with groff.  If you want to
                    do real publishing, consider the LaTeX format instead.

             xhtml  produces XHTML output by postprocessing HTML output  with  W3C  tidy.   By  the  way,  check
                    <a href="http://hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml">http://hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml</a> for discussion about HTML and XHTML.

             docbook-xml
                    produces rudimentary DocBook XML output.  See BUGS below for more discussion about this.

          --link-abbrevs
                 Take  link abbreviation syntax into use.  Note that because link abbreviation processing occurs
                 in two phases, it doesn't work totally when the input comes from standard input  (for  example,
                 if you use stx2any as a middle part of a pipeline).

          --quote
                 Request  quoting  of  characters  (other  than  underscores  and dollar signs) that are somehow
                 magical in the requested output format.  This will make it quite difficult to put markup in the
                 output format directly in your document, but will greatly increase the  possibility  that  your
                 document will be correct (ie. does not have syntax errors) in the output format.

          --quote-me-harder
                 Request quoting of underscores and dollar signs.  This might make some LaTeX documents work but
                 might  break  some documents where underscores are used in macro names or dollar signs in macro
                 definitions.

          --numbering { on | off }
                 Request numbering of section headings.  The default varies by output format: section  numbering
                 is by default off for HTML, DocBook XML and man, on for LaTeX.

          --table-of-contents { on | off }
                 Request  producing a table of contents from the headings.  The default is to produce a TOC when
                 numbering is on.  Not implemented for DocBook XML.

          --make-title { on | off }
                 Request a “title page”.  The default is “on”.  This setting does not have any  effect  in  some
                 formats.   In  HTML,  it produces a big heading at the beginning of the document.  In LaTeX, it
                 produces the canonical maketitle.

          --no-template
                 Do not produce a document template at all, only the formatted input text.   You  probably  need
                 this if your document will be included as a part of a bigger document.  If that bigger document
                 is written totally in Stx, however, it will be cleaner to give all the source files directly as
                 arguments to stx2any rather than combine the results afterwards.

          --symmetric-crossrefs
                 In  document formats that support linking (HTML, DocBook), produce reverse links from labels to
                 referrers as well as links from referrers to labels.

          --latex-params <u>params</u>
                 Set the document class parameters for LaTeX documents.  The default is affected by system paper
                 size;  for  example,  on  a  European  system  it  is  typically   a4paper,notitlepage.    (See
                 “ENVIRONMENT” below.)

          --html-params <u>params</u>
                 Set the body tag parameters for HTML documents.  The default is no parameters.

          --picture-suffix <u>suffix</u>
                 Inline images will refer to files with suffix <u>suffix</u>.  The default is png for HTML and DocBook,
                 eps for LaTeX and man.

          --no-emdash-separate
                 In  the output, don't separate em dashes from adjacent text with spaces.  This is in accordance
                 to traditional English typography (if I understand correctly), but  is  not  standard  in  many
                 other languages — including Finnish, my mother tongue.

          --more-secure
                 Disable  some  insecure features of m4 and check some command line arguments that are passed to
                 shell for problematic characters.  This might be desirable if you've received the document from
                 somewhere else and want to make sure it won't do anything malicious when converted.   Currently
                 this denies execution of shell escapes.

                 Note  that  clearly  no  implementation  of  m4  has  been designed with security in mind. As a
                 consequence, this option cannot prevent every potentially harmful thing.  Things not  prevented
                 which  I'm  aware  of  are including contents of arbitrary files in the output and writing busy
                 loops (so that the conversion will use all processor time it can get, until terminated).

          --sed-preprocessor <u>scriptname</u>
                 Run the sed script <u>scriptname</u> for all input.   This  allows  you  to  add  custom  abbreviation
                 markups.   It  is almost the same as preprocessing input with sed, then piping it into stx2any,
                 but interacts better with --link-abbrevs (see its explanation for details).

          --version, -V
                 Just show version information and exit.

          --help, -?
                 Just show a short help message and exit.

</pre><h4><b>WRITING</b> <b>MAN</b> <b>PAGES</b></h4><pre>
       Basically, man pages are simply files in the man macro format.  However, there are some  programs  (first
       and  foremost  mandb)  that  require  parts of man pages to be in a specific format, and man pages should
       generally adhere to the standard sectioning and form (see man (1) and lexgrog (1) for details).

       When writing a man page, the title (w_title) of the page should be the program/file/format/utility  name,
       and  you  should define the section (w_section).  To make the page suitable for mandb parsing, you should
       start the page with one or more calls to w_man_desc.  This will create a proper “NAME” section  for  you.
       (Although you could write one by yourself.)

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       stx2any  may  give  any  error  message  that  m4 may give, e.g. on malformatted input (a macro call with
       missing closing parenthesis etc).  In addition, it has the following own error messages:

          unknown output format: “X”
                 You requested unsupported output format <u>X</u> with the -T option.

          unknown macro “X” called
                 stx2any encountered a macro beginning with w_, but knows no  definition  for  it.   This  is  a
                 warning, not an error — the offending macro and its arguments are stripped from the output.

          environment “X” closed by “Y” in layer N
                 Environments  in  stx2any  must  be  properly nested.  stx2any encountered w_end(<u>Y</u>) when it was
                 expecting w_end(<u>X</u>).  Often this is a sign of a forgotten w_end(<u>X</u>).

                 If <u>N</u> (the layer) is something other than 0, then the problem is probably  in  your  environment
                 definitions, not at the point that stx2any was processing when it encountered the error.

          unknown environment “X”
                 There  was  an  attempt  to begin an environment whose name is unknown to stx2any, i.e. no such
                 environment has been defined.

          diversion “X” closed by “Y”

          unknown diversion “X”
                 Same as above, but for diversions (w_begdiv and w_enddiv).

          attempt to use “X” in secure environment
                 You requested secure processing with --more-secure and the  document  contained  an  “insecure”
                 macro.   This  is  a  warning  message,  not  an  error — the causing macro is left in the text
                 verbatim.

          unknown cross link to “X”
                 There was a cross link to document <u>X</u>,  but  stx2any  does  not  know  about  such  a  document.
                 Probably  you  didn't  gather  /X/'s data with gather_stx_titles or you misspelled the document
                 reference.  This is a warning, not an error — the reference is left  in  the  output  verbatim,
                 without any kind of link.

       The return value of stx2any is zero on success, one if there was some problem.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The structured text format is not yet fully standardised.  There  are  some  corner  cases  where  it  is
       unclear  what  the  result  of  the  formatting  should  be.   In  these  cases, the output of stx2any is
       authoritative, so it <u>cannot</u> have bugs :)

       Some old GNU libc's seem to be abysmally slow on some instances of the emphasis  regexps.   It  would  be
       possible  to  make the regexps faster and less correct, but as newer GNU libc's and BSD libc seem to work
       OK in these cases, I guess it's not worth it.

       The --more-secure switch is not really very secure for reasons explained above.

       The support for DocBook XML sucks.  It is only included because someone will  show  up  anyway  and  ask,
       “hey,  does it support <b>DocBook</b> <b>XML</b>?”  Partly this sucking is due to my laziness, but partly it is because
       of the nature of DocBook.  For instance, stx2any will transform literal formatting into  DocBook  Literal
       elements,  but  the  <u>point</u>  of using DocBook is to convey more information than that — whether it is some
       ComputerOutput, UserInput, EnVar, or Application, or... and  the  result  is  still  very  abstract,  not
       actually  meant  for humans to read but rather for computers to process into something readable.  Now the
       truth is that I doubt you will ever come up with a DSSSL stylesheet whose output outperforms  LaTeX  (for
       publishing on paper) or direct conversion to HTML (for publishing on the web).

       The only sensible reasons I can think of for using Stx as a DocBook frontend are:

           1.  the ability to use both DocBook constructs and Stx abbreviations

           2.  if  you  have to write DocBook for some interesting reason (your boss told you so) but don't want
               to learn it

           3.  you happen to already have infrastructure for processing DocBook documents, and you want to  take
               advantage of it
