</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       img2dcm - Convert standard image formats into DICOM format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       img2dcm [options] imgfile-in... dcmfile-out

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>img2dcm</b>  tool serves as a conversion tool from a standard image format like JPEG (including JPEG-LS)
       or BMP to DICOM. Different output SOP Classes can be  selected.  The  additional  information  (regarding
       patients,  series,  etc.)  stored  in the DICOM output file can be extracted from other DICOM files which
       serve as a 'template' for the resulting DICOM object. <b>img2dcm</b> can also be configured  to  invent  missing
       DICOM type 1 and type 2 attributes to work even without any template dataset.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       imgfile-in   image input filename

       dcmfile-out  DICOM output filename ('-' for stdout)

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Attribute</b> <b>Sources</b>
       For  converting  a  general  image format into DICOM format, the <b>img2dcm</b> application may be fed with some
       additional input for filling mandatory (and optional) attributes in the  new  DICOM  file  like  patient,
       study  and series information. This information can be collected using different approaches, which can be
       combined and are applied to the result file in the following order:

       • Using the <u>--dataset-from</u> option <b>img2dcm</b> is forced to import attributes from an existing DICOM file. The
         given DICOM file is fully imported and serves as the basis for all further  export  operations.  As  an
         exception,  the  SOP  Instance  UID  is  not  copied by this option. Also image related data like Rows,
         Columns etc. is exchanged during conversion. Note that <b>img2dcm</b>  does  not  check  any  other  attribute
         values  for  validity,  e.g.  it does not look into sequences to adapt any attributes to the new object
         (referenced images etc.). Therefore, it is recommended to use the templates in the data  directory  for
         (old)  SC  and  VLP objects. See also section 'Input Templates'. As an alternative to option <u>--dataset-</u>
         <u>from</u> the mutually exclusive option <u>--dataset-from-xml</u> can be used. In this case, however, the file must
         contain XML data in the format as produced by <b>dcm2xml</b>.

       • The <u>--study-from</u> and <u>--series-from</u> options can be used to import patient, study and series  information
         from  an  existing  DICOM  file.  If <u>--series-from</u> is specified, then the given DICOM file is opened by
         <b>img2dcm</b> and all mandatory information down to the series level is imported.  Note  that  this  includes
         patient,  study  and  series  information. In case of <u>--study-from</u>, the series information is excluded.
         Using <u>--study-from</u> and <u>--series-from</u> at the same time does make sense. If both options are provided  on
         the command line, the rightmost option wins. The following attributes are taken over:

             Patient Level:
               Patient's Name
               Patient ID
               Patient's Sex
               Patient's Birth Date
               Specific Character Set

             Study Level:
               Study Instance UID
               Study Date
               Study Time
               Referring Physician's Name
               Study ID
               Accession Number

             Series Level (only in case of option --series-from):
               Series Instance UID
               Series Number
               Manufacturer

       • With the <u>--insert-type2</u> and <u>--invent-type1</u> options (both enabled per default), missing attributes (type
         2  attributes)  and/or  missing  attribute  values  (for type 1 attributes) are automatically added and
         invented by <b>img2dcm</b>. Please note that these options are only evaluated if option <u>--do-checks</u> is enabled
         (default). If the <u>--no-checks</u> options is enabled, no automatic attribute insertion will take place.

       • The <u>--key</u> option can be used to add further attributes to the DICOM output file. It is also possible to
         specify sequences, items and nested attributes using the <u>--key</u> option. In these cases, a special 'path'
         notation has to be used. Details on this path notation can be found in the documentation  of  <b>dcmodify</b>.
         The  <u>--key</u>  option  can be present more than once. The value part (after the '=') may be absent causing
         the attribute to be set with zero length. Please be advised that the <u>--key</u> option  is  applied  at  the
         very end, just before saving the DICOM file, so there is no value checking whatsoever.

   <b>UIDs</b>
       New  Study  and  Series  Instance  UIDs  are  generated  <b>if</b> <b>necessary</b> after applying the <u>--study-from</u> and
       <u>--series-from</u> options. If Study Instance UID or Series Instance UID are not present  after  these  steps,
       they are newly generated, independently from each other.

       A  contrary behavior is chosen for the SOP Instance UID that one could expect to be taken over when using
       the <u>--dataset-from</u> or <u>--dataset-from-xml</u> option. This is <b>not</b> the case, the SOP Instance UID is <b>not</b> copied
       to the new object. This should be the desirable behavior for most use cases. However, if  a  certain  SOP
       Instance UID should be inserted into the new object, the <u>--key</u> option should be used.

   <b>Input</b> <b>Templates</b>
       For supporting the conversion into DICOM, <b>img2dcm</b> comes with some pre-defined templates which can be used
       for  the  <u>--dataset-from</u> option (see sample files <u>SC.dump</u> and <u>VLP.dump</u>). These templates should be filled
       with the desired values and then must be dumped (converted) to a DICOM file before  actually  being  used
       with <b>img2dcm</b>. Use <b>dump2dcm</b> to convert the dump to DICOM. Example:

         dump2dcm SC.dump SC.dcm

       For  Ophthalmic Photography images, XML templates are provided (see sample file <u>OP_template_utf_8.xml</u> and
       <u>OP_template_latin_1.xml</u>).

       It is possible to use any DICOM file as a template. Please  note  that  the  complete  DICOM  dataset  is
       imported;  hence,  it  should  be  assured  that  only attributes are present which should be part of the
       constructed DICOM object. The SOP Class UID and the Pixel  Data  attributes  (including  attributes  like
       Rows, Columns etc.) are not copied but replaced by <b>img2dcm</b> during conversion.

   <b>Multiframe</b> <b>Images</b>
       It  is possible to convert multiple input files into one DICOM multiframe image if the selected DICOM SOP
       class supports multiframe. In particular, the Multi-frame Secondary  Capture  SOP  Classes  support  this
       feature. They are selected through the <u>--new-sc</u> command line option.

   <b>Character</b> <b>Sets</b>
       When  an  input template is loaded using <u>--dataset-from</u> or <u>--dataset-from-xml</u>, the specific character set
       of that template is used for the generated DICOM file. If the <u>--study-from</u> or <u>--series-from</u>  options  are
       used  additionally,  <b>img2dcm</b>  will  try  to  convert the character set of these attributes to that of the
       template, and will report an error if that is not possible.

       If the <u>--study-from</u> or <u>--series-from</u> options are used without a template, the specific character  set  of
       this  source  is used for the generated DICOM file. Any keys specified on the command line with the <u>--key</u>
       option are treated as raw bytes and override any attributes that may already be present due to a template
       or study/series file. Therefore, care should be taken to not specify a  specific  character  set  on  the
       command  line  if  one  might be loaded from another file. It is also the user's responsibility to ensure
       that attribute values specified on the command line use the correct encoding, as no conversion will  take
       place before the values are stored in the DICOM file.

   <b>Input</b> <b>Plugins</b>
       The <b>img2dcm</b> application currently supports the JPEG, JPEG-LS and the BMP image format as input.

   <b>JPEG</b> <b>Input</b> <b>Plugin</b>
       For  JPEG,  the  original JPEG from the source file is not decoded but extracted and slightly transformed
       (e.g. JFIF header is cut off) to allow fast conversion of  even  big  JPEG  files  without  the  need  of
       decoding  and  re-encoding.  The  JPEG  plugin chooses the necessary output transfer syntax automatically
       depending on the actual encoding of the data inside the JPEG  file.  Therefore,  the  following  Transfer
       Syntaxes (and their corresponding JPEG encodings) are used by the JPEG plugin:

       • JPEG Coding Process 1
          Baseline, Lossy, Non-Hierarchical, Sequential, DCT, Huffman, 8 Bit
          Transfer Syntax UID = 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.50

       • JPEG Coding Process 2 (8-bit) and 4 (12-bit)
          Extended, Lossy, Non-Hierarchical, Sequential, DCT, Huffman, 8/12 Bit
          Transfer Syntax UID = 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.51

       • JPEG Coding Process 10 (8-bit) and 12 (12-bit)
          Full Progression, lossy, Non-Hierarch., Progressive, DCT, Huffman, 8/12 Bit
          Transfer Syntax UID = 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.55

       Color and grayscale images are supported.

       The  support  for the Extended JPEG Transfer Syntax can be disabled (<u>--disable-ext</u> option) as well as the
       support for the (retired) Progressive JPEG Transfer Syntax (<u>--disable-progr</u> option).

       JPEG lossless encoding as well as any arithmetic or hierarchical JPEG encoding modes are not supported by
       the plugin.

       JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format) information facilitates optional APPn markers in a  JPEG  file.  Many
       digital  cameras  do  not  integrate such JFIF information into the JPEG output they create. For example,
       JFIF contains information about the pixel aspect ratio of the compressed image. If you want  the  <b>img2dcm</b>
       application  to insist on a JFIF header in the JPEG stream, you can use the option <u>--insist-on-jfif</u> which
       will abort if no JFIF information can be found. By default, missing JFIF information is ignored.

       For DICOM it is kind of a 'gray zone', whether the integration of JFIF (or any other APPn) data into  the
       DICOM  object's  internal  JPEG  stream  is allowed or not. However, the most reliable approach is to cut
       those markers and their information off the JPEG stream. This approach  is  also  taken  by  the  <b>img2dcm</b>
       application. By default, all APPn markers are cut off from the original JPEG stream. However, if you want
       to  keep other APPn markers than JFIF (e.g. EXIF information) inside the DICOM stream, the option <u>--keep-</u>
       <u>appn</u> does the trick. It should also be slightly faster than cutting off APPn information, because  it  is
       not  necessary  to scan the whole JPEG stream for such data. As stated before, JFIF information is always
       removed by <b>img2dcm</b>. However, when using this option, the APP2 marker is retained, but  <b>img2dcm</b>  does  not
       create an equivalent ICC Profile (0028,2000) attribute.

   <b>JPEG-LS</b> <b>Input</b> <b>Plugin</b>
       The  JPEG-LS plugin has been integrated directly into the main JPEG plugin. There is no need for the user
       to explicitly state in advance if input is JPEG or JPEG-LS.

       For JPEGL-LS, the original JPEG-LS from the source  file  is  not  decoded  but  extracted  and  slightly
       transformed (e. g. APP8 marker is cut off) to allow fast conversion of even big JPEG-LS files without the
       need of decoding and re-encoding.

       The  JPEG-LS  plugin  chooses  the necessary output transfer syntax automatically depending on the actual
       encoding of the data inside the JPEG-LS file. Therefore,  the  following  Transfer  Syntaxes  (and  there
       corresponding JPEG-LS encodings) are used by the JPEG-LS plugin:

       • JPEG-LS Lossless Image Compression
          Transfer Syntax UID = 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.80

       • JPEG-LS Lossy (Near-Lossless) Image Compression
          Transfer Syntax UID = 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.81

       Color  and  grayscale  images  are  supported.  CP-1843  enforce  that  the value of Planar Configuration
       (0028,0006) is irrelevant since the manner of encoding components is specified in the JPEG-LS bit  stream
       as  component,  line  or  sample  interleaved,  hence it shall be set to 0. Since no color transformation
       specific for JPEG-LS is currently defined in DICOM, it is assumed that the JPEG-LS stream is  encoded  in
       RGB color space.

       For  DICOM  it  is  clear  that SPIFF header should not be present in the DICOM object's internal JPEG-LS
       stream. The plugin will simply rejects any input JPEG-LS file containing a SPIFF header at marker APP8.

       By default, all APPn markers are cut off from the original JPEG-LS stream. However, if you want  to  keep
       APPn  markers  (e.g. APP8/HP color transform information, aka 'mrfx') inside the DICOM stream, the option
       <u>--keep-appn</u> does the trick. Pay attention that the plugin will check the actual color transform specified
       in the APP8/HP marker. Since DICOM does not allow any color transform to be specified in the APP8 marker,
       only a value of 0 (no color transform) is accepted.

   <b>BMP</b> <b>Input</b> <b>Plugin</b>
       <b>img2dcm</b> supports BMP as input format. However, so far only the most common BMP images are  supported.  In
       particular,  BMP  images  which  use  bit fields or run length encoding will be rejected. Such images are
       uncommon. Input images will either be converted into a DICOM image with RGB color model and a  bit  depth
       of  24,  or into an image with MONOCHROME2 color model an 8 bits per pixel. There are no specific options
       for fine-tuning BMP format conversion.

   <b>Output</b> <b>Plugins</b>
       The desired output SOP Class can be selected on the command  line.  Currently,  export  plugins  for  the
       Secondary  Capture  Image  SOP  Class  (default, option <u>-sc</u>), the Multi-frame Secondary Capture Image SOP
       Classes (option <u>-nsc</u>), Visible Light Photographic Image  SOP  Class  (option  <u>-vl</u>),  and  the  Ophthalmic
       Photography  Image  SOP Classes (option <u>-oph</u>) are available. Please note that the first one is deprecated
       according to the DICOM standard but is selected as a default  because  it  is  widely  supported.  Future
       versions of <b>img2dcm</b> might provide further output plugins for other SOP Classes.

       For  the new Secondary Capture SOP Classes, it is not possible to specify which specific SOP Class should
       be used for output. That is because these new SOP classes are differentiated from  each  other  by  color
       depth (1/8/16) and the fact whether the image is black/white or color. That is why <b>img2dcm</b> decides during
       conversion, which output SOP Class is suitable for a given source image.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Here are some examples that show how the <b>img2dcm</b> application can be used.

       1.  img2dcm image.jpg out.dcm
            Read  JPEG  file  'image.jpg', convert to the old Secondary Capture SOP Class and save the result to
           DICOM file 'out.dcm'. This is the easiest way of using <b>img2dcm</b>. Any type  1  and  type  2  attributes
           required for writing valid objects of this SOP Class are inserted automatically.

       2.  img2dcm -i BMP image.bmp out.dcm
            Same as above but tells <b>img2dcm</b> to read a BMP file instead of JPEG.

       3.  img2dcm image.jpg out.dcm -vlp -k 'PatientName=Bond^James'
            Same  as  first  example,  but  writes Visible Light Photographic Image object to 'out.dcm' and sets
           PatientName to 'Bond^James' which otherwise would be left empty.

       4.  img2dcm image.jpg out.dcm --series-from template.dcm -k 'PatientName=Bond^James'
            Same as 1), but imports patient/study/series information from DICOM file 'template.dcm'. Please note
           that attribute PatientName will contain 'Bond^James' at the end, any value from  'template.dcm'  will
           be  overwritten. That is, because the <u>-k</u> option is applied at the very end of the conversion pipeline
           (see above).

       5.  img2dcm image.jpg out.dcm --no-checks
            Same as 1), but does not perform any  attribute  checking  and  no  type  1  and  type  2  attribute
           insertion!  So  in  this case, an invalid DICOM object would be generated. This can be interesting if
           the output file is not meant to be completed but will undergo further  transformations,  e.g.  adding
           attributes using <b>dcmodify</b>. Only use option <u>--no-checks</u> if you know what you are doing!

       6.  img2dcm image.jpg out.dcm --no-type1-invent
            Same  as  1),  but  does not insert missing type 1 attributes and/or their values. Type 2 attributes
           will be inserted. Note that in this case it must be assured that all type 1 attributes  are  provided
           by  other  means,  i.e. by adding them with the <u>--key</u> option. Otherwise, <b>img2dcm</b> will report an error
           and will stop converting.

       7.  img2dcm image.jpg out.dcm --keep-appn --insist-on-jfif
            Same as 1), but takes over APPn information like EXIF into the DICOM object's resulting JPEG stream.
           Further, <u>--insist-on-jfif</u> will force <b>img2dcm</b> to abort if no  JFIF  information  is  existent  in  the
           source file.

       8.  img2dcm image1.jpg image2.jpg out.dcm --new-sc
            Read  the JPEG files 'image1.jpg' and 'image2.jpg', convert to a multiframe image of the appropriate
           Multi-frame Secondary Capture SOP Class, and save the result to DICOM file 'out.dcm'.

</pre><h4><b>LOGGING</b></h4><pre>
       The level of logging output of the various command line tools and underlying libraries can  be  specified
       by  the user. By default, only errors and warnings are written to the standard error stream. Using option
       <u>--verbose</u> also informational messages like processing details are reported. Option <u>--debug</u> can be used to
       get more details on the internal activity, e.g. for debugging  purposes.  Other  logging  levels  can  be
       selected  using  option  <u>--log-level</u>. In <u>--quiet</u> mode only fatal errors are reported. In such very severe
       error events, the application will usually terminate. For more details on the different  logging  levels,
       see documentation of module 'oflog'.

       In case the logging output should be written to file (optionally with logfile rotation), to syslog (Unix)
       or  the  event  log  (Windows)  option  <u>--log-config</u> can be used. This configuration file also allows for
       directing only certain messages to a particular output stream and for filtering certain messages based on
       the module or application where they  are  generated.  An  example  configuration  file  is  provided  in
       <u>&lt;etcdir&gt;/logger.cfg</u>.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b></h4><pre>
       All command line tools use the following notation for parameters: square brackets enclose optional values
       (0-1), three trailing dots indicate that multiple values are allowed (1-n), a combination of both means 0
       to n values.

       Command  line  options  are  distinguished  from  parameters  by a leading '+' or '-' sign, respectively.
       Usually, order and position of command line options  are  arbitrary  (i.e.  they  can  appear  anywhere).
       However,  if  options  are mutually exclusive the rightmost appearance is used. This behavior conforms to
       the standard evaluation rules of common Unix shells.

       In addition, one or more command files can be specified using an '@' sign as a  prefix  to  the  filename
       (e.g.  <u>@command.txt</u>).  Such  a command argument is replaced by the content of the corresponding text file
       (multiple whitespaces are treated as a single separator unless they appear between two  quotation  marks)
       prior  to  any  further  evaluation. Please note that a command file cannot contain another command file.
       This simple but effective approach allows one to summarize common combinations of options/parameters  and
       avoids longish and confusing command lines (an example is provided in file <u>&lt;datadir&gt;/dumppat.txt</u>).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>img2dcm</b> utility will attempt to load DICOM data dictionaries specified in the <u>DCMDICTPATH</u> environment
       variable.   By   default,   i.e.   if   the  <u>DCMDICTPATH</u>  environment  variable  is  not  set,  the  file
       <u>&lt;datadir&gt;/dicom.dic</u> will be loaded unless the dictionary is  built  into  the  application  (default  for
       Windows).

       The  default  behavior  should  be  preferred  and  the  <u>DCMDICTPATH</u>  environment variable only used when
       alternative data dictionaries are required. The <u>DCMDICTPATH</u> environment variable has the same  format  as
       the  Unix  shell  <u>PATH</u>  variable in that a colon (':') separates entries. On Windows systems, a semicolon
       (';') is used as a separator. The data dictionary code will attempt to load each file  specified  in  the
       <u>DCMDICTPATH</u> environment variable. It is an error if no data dictionary can be loaded.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>&lt;datadir&gt;/SC.dump</u> - Sample dump file for Secondary Capture images
       <u>&lt;datadir&gt;/VLP.dump</u> - Sample dump file for Visible Light Photographic images
       <u>&lt;datadir&gt;/OP_template.xml</u> - Sample XML template for Ophthalmic Photography images
