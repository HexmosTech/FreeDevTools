</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pfsout  - Read pfs frames from stdin and write them in the format determined by the extension of the file
       name

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pfsout</b> pfsout &lt;file&gt; [&lt;file&gt;...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This command can be used to write pfs frames piped to standard input in one  of  the  several  recognized
       formats.  The  proper  format  is  determined  by  the  extension of the give file name. To get a list of
       recognized formats and extensions, execute:

         pfsin --help

       This command is a front-end for pfsout* programs for writing images: pfsoutrgbe, pfsoutexr, etc. Based on
       the file extension, appropriate  program  is  executed.  If  two  different  file  format  are  given  as
       parameters,  two different program for writing images are executed. Additional options starting with dash
       '-' can be passed to pfsout* programs. The following rules apply for passing  the  options:  the  options
       given  before any image file name (or %d pattern) are passed to all pfsout* programs. Options given after
       image file name are only passed to the program executed for that file(s). Note also that all option  that
       take an argument (except <b>--frames</b>) must given in the form <u>--option=value</u>, that is without a space between
       an option and its argument.
