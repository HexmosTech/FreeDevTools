</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tofrodos - Converts text files between DOS and Unix formats.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fromdos</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [file...]
       <b>todos</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [file...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       DOS  text  files traditionally have carriage return and line feed pairs as their newline characters while
       Unix text files have the line feed as their newline character.  <u>fromdos</u> converts ASCII and Unicode  UTF-8
       text  files from the DOS format to the Unix format, while <u>todos</u> converts them from the Unix format to the
       DOS format.

       The programs accept multiple filenames and wildcards as their arguments.  You may  also  use  them  in  a
       pipe.   If  either  program  finds  its  input  redirected, it will process stdin and place the output on
       stdout.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>     This option is deprecated. Do not use it unless you know what you're doing. By  default,  Tofrodos
              does  the expected thing for text files. That is, when converting from DOS to Unix, it will remove
              carriage returns only if they are followed by line feeds.  When converting from Unix  to  DOS,  it
              will  add  carriage  returns  only if the linefeeds are not already preceeded by carriage returns.
              When Tofrodos is run on a normal text file that has already been  converted,  the  resulting  file
              should  be  identical  to  the  original. However, if you use this option, the program will always
              remove carriage returns in the DOS to Unix mode and always add carriage returns in the Unix to DOS
              mode even if it is not appropriate.

       <b>-b</b>     Make a backup of original file. The original file with a <u>.bak</u> extension appended to  the  original
              filename,  silently  replacing  any  existing  file  of  that  name.   For  example, a file called
              "filename.ext"  becomes  "filename.ext.bak"  replacing  any  existing   file   having   the   name
              "filename.ext.bak".   Important:  the  program  behaves  differently if it is compiled for DOS (as
              compared to being compiled for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X or other systems). In view of the filename
              restrictions present on DOS, the DOS executable will strip the original file  extension,  if  any,
              from   the  file  before  appending  the  <u>.bak</u>  extension.  For  example,  "filename.ext"  becomes
              "filename.bak".

       <b>-d</b>     Convert from DOS to Unix. This forces the program to convert the file in a  particular  direction.
              By  default, if the program is named <u>fromdos</u> or <u>dos2unix,</u> it will assume that the input file is in
              a DOS format and convert it to a Unix format. If the program is named <u>todos</u> or <u>unix2dos,</u>  it  will
              assume that the input file is in a Unix format and convert it to a DOS format. Using the <u>-d</u> option
              forces  the program to convert from a DOS format to a Unix format regardless of how the program is
              named. Likewise, using the <u>-u</u> option forces the program to convert from a Unix  format  to  a  DOS
              format regardless of the name of the program.

       <b>-e</b>     Abort  processing  on any error in any file. Normally, the program will simply skip to process the
              next file on the command line when it encounters any errors. This option causes  it  to  abort  on
              errors.

       <b>-f</b>     Force:  convert  even  if  the file is not writeable (read-only). By default, if the program finds
              that the file does not have write permission, it will not process that file.  This  option  forces
              the conversion even if the file is read-only.

       <b>-h</b>     Display a short help screen on the program usage and quit.

       <b>-l</b><u>&lt;logfile&gt;</u>
              Log  error  messages  to  &lt;logfile&gt;. Note that if your command line has an error, such as when you
              specify an unknown option, the error message for the command line option error will be  issued  to
              stderr instead and not logged.

       <b>-o</b>     Overwrite the original file (no backup). This is the default.

       <b>-p</b>     Preserve  file ownership and time on Unix-type systems (like Linux). On Windows and MSDOS, it only
              preserves the file time. Note that on many Unix-type systems, including Linux, the file  ownership
              will only be preserved if the program is run as root, otherwise it will just set the file time and
              silently  fail  the  change of file ownership. On such systems, if you want a warning message when
              the file ownership cannot be changed, use -v (the verbose flag) as well.

       <b>-u</b>     Convert from Unix to DOS. See the <u>-d</u> option above for more information.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbose.

       <b>-V</b>     Show version message and quit.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODE</b></h4><pre>
       Tofrodos terminates with an exit code of 0 on success and 1 on error.

       If the program is invoked with multiple files on the command line, the default behaviour is  to  skip  to
       the  next  file  in  the  list  if  an  error is encountered with any file. In such a case, the exit code
       returned will the status of the last file processed (ie, 0 on success, 1 on  failure).  If  this  is  not
       desirable, use the -e option, which will force the program to abort immediately with the appropriate exit
       code on encountering any error.
