       scanimage - scan an image

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scanimage</b>   [<b>-d</b>  <u>dev</u>]  [<b>--format</b><u>=output-format</u>]  [<b>-i</b>  <u>profile</u>]  [<b>-L</b>]  [<b>-f</b>  <u>device-format</u>]  [<b>-b</b>  [<u>format</u>]]
       [<b>--batch-start</b><u>=start</u>]      [<b>--batch-count</b><u>=count</u>]      [<b>--batch-increment</b><u>=increment</u>]      [<b>--batch-double</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scanimage</b>  is  a  command-line interface to control image acquisition devices such as flatbed scanners or
       cameras.  The device is controlled via command-line options.  After  command-line  processing,  <b>scanimage</b>
       normally  proceeds  to  acquire an image.  The image data is written to standard output in one of the PNM
       (portable aNyMaP) formats (PBM for black-and-white images, PGM for grayscale images, and  PPM  for  color
       images), TIFF format (black-and-white, grayscale or color), PNG format, or JPEG format (compression level
       75).   <b>scanimage</b>  accesses image acquisition devices through the <b>SANE</b> (Scanner Access Now Easy) interface
       and can thus support any device for which there exists a <b>SANE</b> backend (try <b>apropos</b> <u>sane-</u> to get a list of
       available backends).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To get a list of devices:

         scanimage -L

       To scan with default settings to the file image.pnm:

         scanimage &gt;image.pnm

       To scan 100x100 mm to the file image.tiff (-x and -y may not be available with all devices):

         scanimage -x 100 -y 100 --format=tiff &gt;image.tiff

       To print all available options:

         scanimage -h

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are two sets of options available when running <b>scanimage</b>.

       The options that are provided by <b>scanimage</b> itself are listed below. In addition, each backend offers  its
       own  set of options and these can also be specified. Note that the options available from the backend may
       vary depending on the scanning device that is selected.

       Often options that are similar in function may be implemented differently across backends. An example  of
       this  difference  is  <u>--mode</u>  <u>Gray</u>  and  <u>--mode</u>  <u>Grayscale</u>.   This may be due to differing backend author
       preferences.  At other times, options are defined by the scanning device itself and therefore out of  the
       control of the backend code.

       Parameters  are  separated  by  a  blank from single-character options (e.g.  <b>-d</b> <u>epson</u>) and by a "=" from
       multi-character options (e.g.  <b>--device-name</b>=<u>epson</u>).

       <b>-d</b> <u>dev</u>, <b>--device-name</b>=<u>dev</u>
              specifies the device to access and must be followed by a SANE device-name like `<u>epson:/dev/sg0</u>' or
              `<u>hp:/dev/usbscanner0</u>'.   A  (partial)  list  of  available  devices  can  be  obtained  with   the
              <b>--list-devices</b>  option  (see below).  If no device-name is specified explicitly, <b>scanimage</b> reads a
              device-name from the environment variable <b>SANE_DEFAULT_DEVICE</b>.   If  this  variable  is  not  set,
              <b>scanimage</b> will attempt to open the first available device.

       <b>--format</b>=<u>output-format</u>
              selects  how  image  data is written to standard output or the file specified by the <b>--output-file</b>
              option.  <u>output-format</u> can be <b>pnm</b>, <b>tiff</b>, <b>png</b>, or <b>jpeg</b>.  If  <b>--format</b>  is  not  specified,  PNM  is
              written by default.

       <b>-i</b> <u>profile</u>, <b>--icc-profile</b>=<u>profile</u>
              is used to include an ICC profile into a TIFF file.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--list-devices</b>
              requests  a (partial) list of devices that are available.  The list may not be complete since some
              devices may be available, but are not  listed  in  any  of  the  configuration  files  (which  are
              typically stored in directory <u>/etc/sane.d</u>).  This is particularly the case when accessing scanners
              through the network.  If a device is not listed in a configuration file, the only way to access it
              is  by  its  full  device name.  You may need to consult your system administrator to find out the
              names of such devices.

       <b>-f</b> <u>format</u>, <b>--formatted-device-list</b>=<u>device-format</u>
              works similarly  to  <b>--list-devices</b>,  but  requires  a  format  string.   <b>scanimage</b>  replaces  the
              placeholders  <b>%d</b>  <b>%v</b>  <b>%m</b>  <b>%t</b> <b>%i</b> <b>%n</b> with the device name, vendor name, model name, scanner type, an
              index number and newline respectively. The command

              <b>scanimage</b> <b>-f</b> <u>“</u> <u>scanner</u> <u>number</u> <u>%i</u> <u>device</u> <u>%d</u> <u>is</u> <u>a</u> <u>%t,</u> <u>model</u> <u>%m,</u> <u>produced</u> <u>by</u> <u>%v</u> <u>”</u>

              will produce something like:

                     scanner number 0  device sharp:/dev/sg1 is  a  flatbed scanner, model JX250 SCSI,  produced
                     by SHARP

       The <b>--batch*</b> options provide features for scanning documents using document feeders.

              <b>-b</b> [<u>format</u>], <b>--batch</b>=[<u>format</u>]
                     is used to specify the format of the filename that each page will be written to.  Each page
                     is  written out to a single file.  If <u>format</u> is not specified, the default of <u>out%d.pnm</u> (or
                     <u>out%d.tif</u> for <b>--format</b> <b>tiff</b>, <u>out%d.png</u> for <b>--format</b> <b>png</b> or  <u>out%d.jpg</u>  for  <b>--format</b>  <b>jpeg</b>)
                     will  be used.  This option is incompatible with the <b>--output-path</b> option.  <u>format</u> is given
                     as a printf style string with one integer parameter.

              <b>--batch-start</b>=<u>start</u>
                     selects the page number to start naming files with.  If  this  option  is  not  given,  the
                     counter will start at 1.

              <b>--batch-count</b>=<u>count</u>
                     specifies  the  number  of pages to attempt to scan.  If not given, <b>scanimage</b> will continue
                     scanning until the scanner returns a state other than OK.  Not all scanners  with  document
                     feeders signal when the ADF is empty. Use this option to work around them.

              <b>--batch-increment</b>=<u>increment</u>
                     sets  the amount that the number in the filename is incremented by.  Generally this is used
                     when  you  are  scanning  double-sided  documents  on  a  single-sided   document   feeder.
                     <b>--batch-double</b> is a specific command provided to aid this.

              <b>--batch-double</b>
                     will automatically set the increment to 2.  Equivalent to <b>--batch-increment</b>=2.

              <b>--batch-prompt</b>
                     will ask for pressing RETURN before scanning a page. This can be used for scanning multiple
                     pages without an automatic document feeder.

       <b>--accept-md5-only</b>
              only  accepts  user  authorization  requests  that  support  MD5 security. The <b>SANE</b> network daemon
              <b><a href="../man8/saned.8.html">saned</a></b>(8) is capable of doing such requests.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--progress</b>
              requests that <b>scanimage</b> prints a progress counter. It shows how much image  data  of  the  current
              image has already been received (in percent).

       <b>-o</b> <u>path</u>, <b>--output-file</b>=<u>path</u>
              requests  that <b>scanimage</b> saves the scanning output to the given <u>path</u>.  This option is incompatible
              with the <b>--batch</b> option. The program will try to guess <b>--format</b> from the file name. If that is not
              possible, it will print an error message and exit.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--dont-scan</b>
              requests that <b>scanimage</b> only sets the options provided by the user but doesn't actually perform  a
              scan. This option can be used to e.g. turn off the scanner's lamp (if supported by the backend).

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--test</b>
              requests  that  <b>scanimage</b>  performs  a  few  simple sanity tests to make sure the backend works as
              defined by the <b>SANE</b> API. In particular the <b>sane_read</b>() function is exercised by this test.

       <b>-A</b>, <b>--all-options</b>
              requests that <b>scanimage</b> lists all available options  exposed  by  the  backend,  including  button
              options.  The information is printed on standard output and no scan will be performed.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              requests  help  information.   The  information  is printed on standard output and no scan will be
              performed.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              increases the verbosity of the output of <b>scanimage</b>.  The option may be specified repeatedly,  each
              time increasing the verbosity level.

       <b>-B</b> [<u>size</u>], <b>--buffer-size</b>=<u>size</u>
              changes input buffer size from the default of 1MB to <u>size</u> KB.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              requests  that  <b>scanimage</b>  prints  the  program  and  package name, the version number of the <b>SANE</b>
              distribution that it came with and the version of the backend that it loads. If  more  information
              about  the version numbers of the backends are necessary, the <b>DEBUG</b> variable for the dll layer can
              be used. Example: <u>SANE_DEBUG_DLL=3</u> <u>scanimage</u> <u>-L</u>.

       As you might imagine, much of the power of <b>scanimage</b> comes from the fact that it  can  control  any  <b>SANE</b>
       backend.  Thus, the exact set of command-line options depends on the capabilities of the selected device.
       To see the options for a device named <u>dev</u>, invoke <b>scanimage</b> via a command-line of the form:

              scanimage --help --device-name <u>dev</u>

       The  documentation  for  the  device-specific  options  printed  by  <b>--help</b>  is best explained with a few
       examples:

       <b>-l</b> <b>0..218mm</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Top-left x position of scan area.

              The description above shows that option <b>-l</b> expects an option value in the range from 0 to 218  mm.
              The  value  in  square  brackets  indicates  that  the current option value is 0 mm. Most backends
              provide similar geometry options for top-left y position (<b>-t</b>), width (<b>-x</b>) and height of  scan-area
              (-y<b>).</b>

       <b>--brightness</b> <b>-100..100%</b> <b>[0]</b>
              Controls the brightness of the acquired image.

              The  description  above  shows  that option <b>--brightness</b> expects an option value in the range from
              -100 to 100 percent.  The value in square brackets indicates that the current option  value  is  0
              percent.

       <b>--default-enhancements</b>
              Set default values for enhancement controls.

              The  description above shows that option <b>--default-enhancements</b> has no option value.  It should be
              thought of as having an immediate effect at the point of the command-line  at  which  it  appears.
              For  example,  since  this  option resets the <b>--brightness</b> option, the option-pair <b>--brightness</b> <b>50</b>
              <b>--default-enhancements</b> would effectively be a no-op.

       <b>--mode</b> <b>Lineart|Gray|Color</b> <b>[Gray]</b>
              Selects the scan mode (e.g., lineart or color).

              The description above shows that option <b>--mode</b> accepts an argument that must be one of the strings
              <b>Lineart</b>, <b>Gray</b>, or <b>Color</b>.  The value in the square bracket indicates that the option  is  currently
              set  to <b>Gray</b>.  For convenience, it is legal to abbreviate the string values as long as they remain
              unique.  Also, the case of the spelling doesn't matter.  For example, option setting <b>--mode</b> <b>col</b> is
              identical to <b>--mode</b> <b>Color</b>.

       <b>--custom-gamma[=(yes|no)]</b> <b>[inactive]</b>
              Determines whether a builtin or a custom gamma-table should be used.

              The description above shows that option <b>--custom-gamma</b> expects either no  option  value,  a  "yes"
              string,  or a "no" string.  Specifying the option with no value is equivalent to specifying "yes".
              The value in square-brackets indicates  that  the  option  is  not  currently  active.   That  is,
              attempting  to  set  the  option  would  result in an error message.  The set of available options
              typically depends on the settings of other options.  For example, the <b>--custom-gamma</b>  table  might
              be active only when a grayscale or color scan-mode has been requested.

              Note  that  the <b>--help</b> option is processed only after all other options have been processed.  This
              makes it possible to see the option settings for a particular mode by specifying  the  appropriate
              mode-options along with the <b>--help</b> option.  For example, the command-line:

              <b>scanimage</b> <b>--help</b> <b>--mode</b> <u>color</u>

              would print the option settings that are in effect when the color-mode is selected.

       <b>--gamma-table</b> <b>0..255,...</b>
              Gamma-correction  table.   In  color  mode  this  option  equally affects the red, green, and blue
              channels simultaneously (i.e., it is an intensity gamma table).

              The description above shows that option <b>--gamma-table</b> expects zero or more values in the  range  0
              to 255.  For example, a legal value for this option would be "3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12".  Since it's
              cumbersome to specify long vectors in this form, the same can be expressed by the abbreviated form
              "[0]3-[9]12".   What  this means is that the first vector element is set to 3, the 9-th element is
              set to 12 and the values in between are interpolated linearly.   Of  course,  it  is  possible  to
              specify  multiple such linear segments.  For example, "[0]3-[2]3-[6]7,[7]10-[9]6" is equivalent to
              "3,3,3,4,5,6,7,10,8,6".  The program <b>gamma4scanimage</b> can be used to  generate  such  gamma  tables
              (see <b><a href="../man1/gamma4scanimage.1.html">gamma4scanimage</a></b>(1) for details).

       <b>--filename</b> <b>&lt;string&gt;</b> <b>[/tmp/input.ppm]</b>
              The filename of the image to be loaded.

              The  description  above  is  an  example  of an option that takes an arbitrary string value (which
              happens to be a filename).  Again, the value in brackets show that the option is  current  set  to
              the filename <u>/tmp/input.ppm</u>.
