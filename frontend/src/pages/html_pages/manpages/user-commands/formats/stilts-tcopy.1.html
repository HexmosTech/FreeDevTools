       stilts-tcopy - Converts between table formats

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>stilts</b> <b>tcopy</b> [in=<u>&lt;table&gt;</u>] [out=<u>&lt;out-table&gt;</u>] [ifmt=<u>&lt;in-format&gt;</u>] [ofmt=<u>&lt;out-format&gt;</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>tcopy</u>  is  a  table  copying  tool. It simply copies a table from one place to another, but since you can
       specify the input and output formats as desired, it works as a converter from any of the supported  input
       formats to any of the supported output formats.

       <u>tcopy</u>  is  just a stripped-down version of <u>tpipe</u> - it doesn't do anything that <u>tpipe</u> can't, but the usage
       is slightly simplified. It is provided as a drop-in replacement for the old <u>tablecopy</u> (<u>uk.ac.starlink.ta‐</u>
       <u>ble.TableCopy</u>) tool which was supplied with earlier versions of STIL and TOPCAT - it has the  same  argu‐
       ments  and behaviour as <u>tablecopy</u>, but is implemented somewhat differently and will in some cases be more
       efficient.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>in=</b><u>&lt;table&gt;</u>
              The location of the input table. This may take one of the following forms:

                * A filename.

                * A URL.

                * The special value "<u>-</u>", meaning standard input. In this case the input format must be given ex‐
                  plicitly using the <u>ifmt</u> parameter. Note that not all formats can be streamed in this way.

                * A scheme specification of the form <u>:&lt;scheme-name&gt;:&lt;scheme-args&gt;</u>.

                * A system command line with either a "<u>&lt;</u>" character at the start, or a "<u>|</u>" character at the  end
                  ("<u>&lt;syscmd</u>" or "<u>syscmd|</u>"). This executes the given pipeline and reads from its standard output.
                  This will probably only work on unix-like systems.
               In  any case, compressed data in one of the supported compression formats (gzip, Unix compress or
              bzip2) will be decompressed transparently.

       <b>out=</b><u>&lt;out-table&gt;</u>
              The location of the output table. This is usually a filename to write to. If it is  equal  to  the
              special value "-" (the default) the output table will be written to standard output.

       <b>ifmt=</b><u>&lt;in-format&gt;</u>
              Specifies the format of the input table as specified by parameter <u>in</u>. The known formats are listed
              in  SUN/256. This flag can be used if you know what format your table is in. If it has the special
              value <u>(auto)</u> (the default), then an attempt will be made to detect the format of the  table  auto‐
              matically.  This cannot always be done correctly however, in which case the program will exit with
              an error explaining which formats were attempted. This parameter is ignored  for  scheme-specified
              tables.

       <b>ofmt=</b><u>&lt;out-format&gt;</u>
              Specifies  the  format  in  which  the  output table will be written (one of the ones in SUN/256 -
              matching is case-insensitive and you can use just the first few letters). If it  has  the  special
              value  "<u>(auto)</u>" (the default), then the output filename will be examined to try to guess what sort
              of file is required usually by looking at the extension. If it's not  obvious  from  the  filename
              what output format is intended, an error will result.
