</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dcm2mnc - convert sets of DICOM files to one or more MINC format files.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dcm2mnc</b> <u>[&lt;options&gt;]</u> <u>&lt;input-list&gt;</u> <u>&lt;output-dir&gt;</u>

       <b>dcm2mnc</b> <u>-help</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>dcm2mnc</b> command is used to convert DICOM format files to MINC format.

       DICOM  (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format is used by many vendors of medical imaging
       equipment as a standard means of data interchange.  The DICOM  specification  is  extremely  complex  and
       includes  protocols  for data interchange and communications as well as the specifics of the data format.
       In most cases, tens or even hundreds of DICOM files must be combined to produce a single MINC file.

       In normal operation, the <u>input-list</u> will consist of the names of one or more files or  directories.   The
       program  scans  all  specified  input files and directories and attempts to identify groups of files that
       should be combined into a single MINC  file.   Once  these  groups  (or  "series")  of  DICOM  files  are
       identified,  the program analyzes the data for each series and attempts to determine the correct geometry
       and ancillary information to be incorporated into the MINC file.

       If all goes well, one or more MINC files will be created in one or more  subdirectories  created  in  the
       specified directory <u>output-dir</u>.  These directories and files will be automatically named according to the
       patient's name, the acquisition date, acquisition time, series identifier, and modality.

       For  a variety of reasons, medical imaging manufacturers have chosen to implement a number of proprietary
       extensions to the DICOM format. This program attempts to be very general, but it does some extra checking
       for specific proprietary fields where useful  or  necessary.  However,  as  device  settings  change  and
       software  is  updated,  the  precise details of the DICOM output for a given device may shift.  Different
       devices from the same manufacturer may produce substantially different DICOM output.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that options can be specified in abbreviated form (as long as they are  unique)  and  can  be  given
       anywhere on the command line.

</pre><h4><b>Output</b> <b>file</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-clobber</b>
              Overwrite existing files.  By default, <b>dcm2mnc</b> will not write over an existing file.

       <b>-anon</b>  Do  not  store  the  patient  name in the MINC file.  The string "anonymous" will be used instead.
              Note that all other identifying information will still be stored in the file.

       <b>-nosplitecho</b>
              Do not split echoes into separate files.  If multiple echoes are present in a  series,  they  will
              all be stored in a single MINC file with a dimension named "echo".

       <b>-splitdynamic</b>
              Split  dynamic  scans into separate files. Normally dynamic scans are stored in a single MINC file
              with a "time" dimension.  If this option is specified, each time slice will be saved in a separate
              file.

       <b>-fname</b> <u>&lt;format-spec&gt;</u>
              Set the format of the output file name. See FILENAMES section for details on this option.

       <b>-dname</b> <u>&lt;format-spec&gt;</u>
              Set the format of the output subdirectory name. See FILENAMES section for details on this  option.
              Set this to the empty string to avoid creating a subdirectory.

</pre><h4><b>Siemens</b> <b>mosaic</b> <b>specific</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       These  two  options  control  the  manner  in  which  Siemens mosaic data is converted.  Siemens scanners
       commonly represent fMRI data as a "mosaic" of subimages combined into a  single  large  image.   Normally
       these  are in what we call "ascending" order, but if your functional image is not converted properly, you
       may need to specify one of these options.  NOTE that the mosaic order is often not the same as the  slice
       acquisition order.

       <b>-descending</b>
              The mosaic image is stored in descending order.

       <b>-interleaved</b>
              The mosaic image is stored in alternating (odd/even) order.

</pre><h4><b>Other</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-stdin</b> This option tells <b>dcm2mnc</b> to read a list of input files from the standard input in addition to any
              files specified on the command line.

       <b>-cmd</b> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>
              This  option  will apply the given command string to each output file after it is created.  Can be
              used to run gzip or compress on each output file, for example.

       <b>-minmax</b>

              Use the values for the largest and smallest pixel value as stored  in  the  DICOM  file.  This  is
              useful  especially with GE PET data, but may be needed to get a quantitatively accurate conversion
              with other manufacturers.  If this option is not specified.  .B dcm2mnc uses the full range of the
              datatype as specified by the number of bits stored per  voxel  (field  #  0028,0101).   When  this
              option is specified, the 0028,0106 and 0028,0107 will be used to set the valid range of pixels.

       <b>-list</b>  List  files in series, but do not perform conversion.  Sometimes useful for verifying the validity
              of a dataset, and for debugging problems with <b>dcm2mnc</b>.

       <b>-verbose</b>
              Verbose operation.  Prints a large amount of additional information about the program's operation.
              This information can probably only be interpreted by someone familiar with both this  program  and
              the DICOM standard.

       <b>-debug</b> Extremely  verbose  operation.  Prints a huge amount of additional information about the program's
              operation. This information can probably only be interpreted by someone familiar  with  both  this
              program and the DICOM standard.

       <b>-usecoordinates</b>
              This  option  requests  that the conversion rely on the slice coordinates rather than the standard
              DICOM fields for slice thickness and spacing.  It is useful if for some reason the standard  DICOM
              fields for slice thickness and spacing are incorrect.

       <b>-opts</b> <u>&lt;value&gt;</u>
              This is a private option intended only for debugging purposes.  Please avoid using it.

</pre><h4><b>Generic</b> <b>options</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>commands</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-help</b>  Print summary of command-line options and abort

       <b>-version</b>
              Print the program and library versions and abort

</pre><h4><b>FILENAMES</b></h4><pre>
       To  avoid  naming  collisions  when  converting a large set of input DICOM files to a smaller set of MINC
       output files, <b>dcm2mnc</b> automatically generates the names of output files according to  various  parameters
       of the DICOM file information.  The normal behavior is to place all of the output files in a subdirectory
       of  the  given output directory which has its name derived from the patient's name and the study date and
       time as follows:

       patientname_yyyymmdd_hhmmss/

       The individual files are named according to the patient name, study date and time, series identifier, and
       modality information as follows:

       patientname_yyyymmdd_hhmmss_series_scan_modality.mnc

       The optional scan information includes the echo number ('e&lt;n&gt;'),  slice  number  ('sl&lt;n&gt;'),  time  series
       position ('d&lt;n&gt;'), phase number ('p&lt;n&gt;'), or chemical shift ('cs&lt;n&gt;').

       The optional modality information consists of either the string "_pet" or "_mri".  No suffix is added for
       unrecognized modalities.

       The <b>-fname</b> and <b>-dname</b> commands allow the user to override the standard file naming behavior by specifying
       alternative  output directory and file formats.  The arguments to these options are template strings that
       will be expanded to include information from the DICOM sequences in specified locations. Replacements are
       specified by a '%' character followed by a single alphabetic character, as follows:

           %N - Name of patient
           %D - Date of scan
           %T - Time of scan
           %S - Study ID (typically 'yyyymmdd.hhmmss')
           %A - Acquisition or series ID
           %s - Optional slice label
           %e - Optional echo number
           %t - Optional dynamic scan number
           %p - Optional phase number
           %c - Optional chemical shift number
           %m - Optional modality

       The default file name convention is therefore given by the format string:

       %N_%D_%T_%A%s%e%t%p%c%m

       and the default directory name is given by the format string:

       %N_%D_%T

       If you wish to avoid creating a subdirectory, you may do  so  by  giving  a  zero-length  string  as  the
       argument to the <b>-dname</b> option:

       dcm2mnc -dname ´´ filenames...

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Probably  many.  For best results, output files should be checked by a competent human to verify that the
       conversion was performed properly.  DICOM is a very complex format, and it is difficult to anticipate all
       of the possible combinations of fields and values that may be encountered.  If you have a problem, please
       contact the maintainer.  It will be extremely useful if you can provide an example dataset that  exhibits
       the problem you have discovered.
