       odf2pod - POD generation from an OpenDocument file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Usage : odf2pod &lt;filename&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This demo script exports the content of a given OpenDocument file to POD on the standard output. In the
       present form, it's quite limited and not flexible, in order to remain easily readable. It should be
       considered as an example of text extraction using OpenOffice::OODoc and not as the 'definitive' odf2pod
       filter, knowing that complex document structures are not properly rendered.

       Before extraction, some transformations are done in the document in order to make it more convenient for
       a POD presentation. Some pieces of metadata (title, subject, description), if defined, are reported in
       the beginning of the POD. The footnotes are removed from the content and reported in a special section at
       the end.

       This script needs Text::Wrapper (that is not necessarily required by the OpenOffice::OODoc installation).
       To implement more sophisicated presentation rules, you could use Text::Format instead.
