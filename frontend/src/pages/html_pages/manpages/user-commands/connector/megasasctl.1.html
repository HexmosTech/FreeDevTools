       megasasctl - diagnostics on megaraid adapters and attached disks.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       megasasctl [<b>-vest</b>] [<b>-H</b>] [<b>-l</b> log-page-nr] [<b>-T</b> long|short] [target ...]

       Reports  diagnostics on megaraid adapters and attached disks. Permits dumping of controller log pages for
       inspection of  error,  temperature,  and  self-test  conditions,  initiates  self-test  diagnostics,  and
       documents  adapter and logical drive configuration. Target devices may be adapters, (e.g. a0), enclosures
       (e.g. a0e0), or individual disks (e.g. a0e0s0). If no target  is  specified,  reports  configuration  and
       drive  state  on  all  adapters. If a target matches a collection of disks, operations are applied to all
       matching devices. Options are:

       <b>-v</b>     Increase program verbosity.

       <b>-e</b>     Dump read (0x03), write (0x02), and verify (0x05) error log pages.

       <b>-s</b>     Dump self-test (0x10) log page.

       <b>-t</b>     Dump temperature (0x0d) log page.

       <b>-l</b> <b>page</b>
              Dump the specified log page. Log page 0 documents the log pages the device supports.

       <b>-p</b>     Do not report physical disks. Reports only adapters  and  logical  drives.  Useful  for  concisely
              documenting adapter configuration.

       <b>-T</b> <b>test</b>
              Initiate  the  background  short  or  long self-test procedure. The test may take up to an hour to
              complete, but does not inhibit access to the device. The  test  may  be  monitored  using  the  <b>-s</b>
              option.

       <b>-H</b>     Perform  an  adapter  health  check. Inspects state of all logical and physical drives and battery
              backup unit and reports problem conditions. If all is well, generates no output. Useful in a  cron
              job.

       <b>-B</b>     When performing health check, do not treat battery problems as failures.

       <b>-V</b>     Show version.

       N.B. The background long self test is a useful tool for diagnosing problems with individual disks. But be
       cautious  with  program usage.  "megasasctl <b>-T</b> long" with no targets will initiate a background long self
       test on every drive on every adapter. This may not be what you want.

       By default, the health check option inspects log pages 0x02, 0x03, and 0x05 for uncorrected read,  write,
       and  verify  errors, 0x0d for excess temperature conditions, and 0x10 for failed self tests. If, however,
       any of the log page options is specified, only the designated log pages are inspected.

       This program requires the device file /dev/megaraid_sas_ioctl_node to be present on the system.  If  your
       system  does  not  have  this  device file, you may create it either by executing LSI's "MegaCli" program
       once,   or   by   locating    the    megadev_sas_ioctl    entry    in    <a href="file:/proc/devices">/proc/devices</a>    and    creating
       /dev/megaraid_sas_ioctl_node as a character device with suitable permissions with a matching major device
       number and a minor number of 0.
