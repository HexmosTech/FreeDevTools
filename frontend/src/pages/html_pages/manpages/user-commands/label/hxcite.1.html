</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       hxcite - replace bibliographic references by hyperlinks

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hxcite</b> [ <b>-b</b> <u>base</u> ] [ <b>-p</b> <u>pattern</u> ] [ <b>-a</b> <u>auxfile</u> ] [ <b>-m</b> <u>marker</u> ] [ <b>-c</b> ] <u>bibfile</u> [ <u>file</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>hxcite</b>  commands copies the <u>file</u> to standard output, looking for strings of the form [[<u>label</u>]].  The
       label may not include white space and the double pair of square brackets must enclose the  label  without
       any  spaces  in between. If <b>hxcite</b> finds the label in the <u>bibfile</u>, the string is replaced by the <u>pattern</u>.
       The pattern can include certain variables. If the label is not found in <u>bibfile</u>, it is left unchanged.

       The default pattern replaces the string with a hyperlink, but if the <b>-p</b> option is used,  the  replacement
       can be any pattern. The input doesn't even have to be HTML.

       If  the  label  is  enclosed  in {{...}} instead of [[...]], it is copied to the output unchanged and not
       replaced by the pattern, but the label is still searched in the <u>bibfile</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are supported:

       <b>-p</b> <u>pattern</u>
                 Specifies the pattern by which the string [[<u>label</u>]] is replaced.  The pattern may  include  the
                 variables  <b>%b</b>  (which  is replaced by the value of the <b>-b</b> option), <b>%m</b> (which is replaced by the
                 value of the <b>-m</b> option) and <b>%L</b> (which is replaced by the <u>label</u>).  The default pattern is

                     &lt;a href="%b#%L" rel="biblioentry"&gt;[%L]&lt;!--{{%m%L}}--&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

       <b>-b</b> <u>base</u>   Sets the value for the <b>%b</b> variable in the pattern. Typically this  is  set  to  a  relative  or
                 absolute URL. By default this value is an empty string.

       <b>-a</b> <u>auxfile</u>
                 All  labels  that  have  been  found  and  replaced are also written to a file. This is so that
                 <b><a href="../man1/hxmkbib.1.html">hxmkbib</a></b>(1) can find them and create a bibliography. The default <u>auxfile</u> is constructed from the
                 name of the <u>file</u> by removing the last extension (if any) and replacing it  by  ".aux".   If  no
                 <u>file</u> is given, the default name is "aux.aux".

       <b>-m</b> <u>marker</u> By  default, the program looks for "[[name]]", but it can be made to look for "[[#name]]" where
                 # is some string, usually a symbol such as '!' or '='. This allows references to be classified,
                 e.g., "[[!name]]" for normative references and "[[name]]" for non-normative references.

       <b>-c</b>        Causes "[[name]]" to be ignored when it occurs inside  XML  comments  ("&lt;!--...--&gt;").  This  is
                 useful  for  files  where  such  labels  occur  in comments, to avoid that they be expanded and
                 possibly lead to invalid output; useful also if <b>hxcite</b> is used for  non-HTML  files  which  may
                 contain  "&lt;!--"  that  are not comment. Occurrences of "{{name}}" are not affected by <b>-c</b>.  (But
                 see warning under BUGS below.)

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands are supported:

       <u>bibfile</u>   The name of a bibliographic database must be given. It must be a file in  <b><a href="../man1/refer.1.html">refer</a></b>(1)  format  and
                 every  entry  must  have  at  least a <b>%L</b> field, which is used as label. (Entries without such a
                 field will be ignored.) Entries may optionally have a <b>%K</b> line, which should contain whitespace-
                 separated keywords. Those keywords can be used to refer to the entry instead of the label. Thus
                 the <u>foo</u> in [[<u>foo</u>]] can either be the label of an entry (%L line) or one of the keywords of  the
                 entry's %K line.

       <u>file</u>      The  name  of the input file is optional. If absent, <b>hxcite</b> will read from stdin. The file does
                 not have to be an HTML file, but the default pattern (see the <b>-p</b> option) assumes HTML.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values are returned:

       <b>0</b>         Successful completion.

       <b>&gt;</b> <b>0</b>       An error occurred. Usually this is because a file could not be opened.  Very rarely it may also
                 be an out of memory error.

</pre><h4><b>VERSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       March 2000: created by Bert Bos &lt;<a href="mailto:bert@w3.org">bert@w3.org</a>&gt; as "cite".

       August 2008: renamed to "hxcite".

       Currently maintained by Bert Bos.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hxcite</b> does not actually parse HTML or XML input and the <b>-c</b> option  simply  treats  every  occurrence  of
       "&lt;!--"  as  the  start of an XML comment, even if it occurs inside an attribute value or a CDATA section.
       Likewise for "--&gt;" for the end of a comment.

       There is currently no way to use numbers for references  (e.g.,  "[1]",  "[2]")  instead  of  the  labels
       ("[Lie1996]", "[UTN22]").

       <b>hxcite</b>  requires  the <b>%L</b> (label) field to be present in every entry in <u>bibfile</u>, which is not the case for
       <b><a href="../man1/refer.1.html">refer</a></b>(1).  <b>hxcite</b> does not implement <b>refer</b>'s keyword search.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       The following looks for reference of the form "[[!label]]" in  "myfile.html",  skipping  references  that
       occur  inside HTML comments, and looks up the labels in "biblio.ref". The output is written to "new.html"
       and the list of recognized labels to "myfile.aux".

           hxcite -c -m '!' biblio.ref myfile.html &gt; new.html
