       flow6 - A security assessment tool for the IPv6 Flow Label field

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>flow6</b> [<b>-i</b> <u>INTERFACE</u>] <b>-d</b> <u>DST_ADDR</u> [<b>-S</b> <u>LINK_SRC_ADDR</u>] [<b>-D</b> <u>LINK_DST_ADDR</u>] [<b>-s</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u>[/<u>LEN</u>]] [<b>-A</b> <u>HOP_LIMIT</u>]
       [<b>-P</b> <u>PROTOCOL</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>PORT</u>] [<b>-W</b>] [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-h</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>flow6</b>  performs a security assessment of the Flow Label generation policy of a target node. It is part of
       the SI6 Networks' IPv6 Toolkit: a security assessment suite for the IPv6 protocols.

       <b>flow6</b> sends a number of probe packets to the target node, and  samples  the  Flow  Label  values  of  the
       corresponding  response packets. Based on the sampled values, it tries to infer the Flow Label generation
       policy of the target.

       The tool will first send a number of  probe  packets  from  single  IPv6  address,  such  that  the  per-
       destination  policy is determined. The tool will then send probe packets from random IPv6 addresses (from
       the same prefix as the first probes)  such  that  the  "global"  Flow  Label  generation  policy  can  be
       determined.

       The  tool  computes  the expected value and the standard deviation of the difference between consecutive-
       sampled Flow Label values (Labeln - Labeln-1) with the intent of  inferring  the  Flow  Label  generation
       algorithm of the target node.

       If  the standard deviation of [Labeln - Labeln-1] is 0, the Flow Label is assumed to be set to a constant
       value, and the corresponding value is informed to the user. For small values of the  standard  deviation,
       the  Flow  Label  is  assumed  to be a monotonically-increasing function with increments of the "expected
       value", and such "expected value" together with the standard deviation, are informed  to  the  user.  For
       large  values  of  the  standard  deviation, the Flow Label is assumed to be randomized, and the expected
       value and standard deviation are informed to the user, as indicators of the "quality" of the  Flow  Label
       generation algorithm.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>flow6</b> takes it parameters as command-line options. Each of the options can be specified with a short name
       (one  character  preceded with the hyphen character, as e.g. "-i") or with a long name (a string preceded
       with two hyphen characters, as e.g. "--interface").

       <b>-i</b> <u>INTERFACE</u><b>,</b> <b>--interface</b> <u>INTERFACE</u>
              This option specifies the network interface that the tool will use.  If  the  destination  address
              ("-d"  option)  is a link-local address, the interface must be explicitly specified. The interface
              may also be specified alon with a destination address, with the "-d" option.

       <b>-s</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--src-address</b> <u>SRC_ADDR</u>

              This option specifies the IPv6 source address (or IPv6 prefix) to be used for the  Source  Address
              of  the  probe  packets.  If  an  IPv6  prefix is specified, the IPv6 Source Address of the ICMPv6
              packets will be randomized from that prefix.

       <b>-d</b> <u>DST_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-address</b> <u>DST_ADDR</u>

              This option specifies the IPv6 Destination Address of the target node. This option cannot be  left
              unspecified.

       <b>-A</b> <u>HOP_LIMIT</u><b>,</b> <b>--hop-limit</b> <u>HOP_LIMIT</u>

              This  option specifies the Hop Limit to be used for the IPv6 packets. By default, the Hop Limit is
              randomized.

       <b>-S</b> <u>SRC_LINK_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--src-link-address</b> <u>SRC_LINK_ADDR</u>

              This option specifies the link-layer Source Address of the probe packets (currently, only Ethernet
              is supported). If left unspecified, the link-layer Source Address of the packets  is  set  to  the
              real link-layer address of the network interface.

       <b>-D</b> <u>DST_LINK_ADDR</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-link-address</b> <u>DST_LINK_ADDR</u>

              This  option  specifies  the  link-layer Destination Address of the probe packets (currently, only
              Ethernet is supported). By default, the link-layer Destination Address is automatically set to the
              link-layer address of the destination host (for on-link destinations) or to the link-layer address
              of the first-hop router.

       <b>-P</b> <u>PROTOCOL</u><b>,</b> <b>--protocol</b> <u>PROTOCOL</u>

              This option specifies the protocol type of the probe packets. Currently, both "UDP" and "TCP"  are
              supported. If this option is left unspecified, the protocol type defaults to "TCP".

       <b>-p</b> <u>PORT</u><b>,</b> <b>--dst-port</b> <u>PORT</u>

              This  option  specifies  the  Destination  Port  of  the  probe  packets. If left unspecified, the
              Destination Port defaults to "80" when the IPv6 payload is TCP, and to 53 if the IPv6  payload  is
              UDP.

              Note:  Since  it  is  vital  for the tool to receive response packets to be able to infer the Flow
              Label algorithm of the target, the protocol type and Destination Port should be carefully selected
              (i.e., the corresponding protocol and Destination Port should not be filter, and the target should
              respond to packets sent to that protocol/port).

       <b>-W,</b> <b>--flow-label-policy</b>
              This option instructs the tool to determine the Flow Label generation policy. As of  this  version
              of the tool, this option must be specified.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>

              This  option  instructs  the  flow6  tool to be verbose.  If this option is set twice, the tool is
              "very verbose", and outputs the sampled Flow Label values (in addition to other information).

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>

              Print help information for the <b>flow6</b> tool.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following sections illustrate typical use cases of the <b>flow6</b> tool.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#1</b>

       # flow6 -i eth0 --flow-label-policy -d fe80::1 -v

       Assess the Flow Label generation policy of the host "fe80::1", using the network interface "eth0".  Probe
       packets  are  TCP  segments  directed  to  port 80 (default). Be verbose. In this example, since the IPv6
       destination address is a link-local address, the network interface ccard must be explicitly specified.

       <b>Example</b> <b>#2</b>

       # flow6 -d 2001:db8::1 --flow-label-policy -P TCP -p 22 -vv

       Assess the Flow Label generation policy of  the  host  "2001:db8::1".  Probe  packets  are  TCP  segments
       directed to port 22. Be very verbose (i.e., list the sampled Flow Label values).
