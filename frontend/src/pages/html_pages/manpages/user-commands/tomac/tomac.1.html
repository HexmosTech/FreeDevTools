</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tomac - Transmit files to the Mac

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tomac</b> [ <b>-</b> <b>options</b> ] [ files ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>tomac</u>  takes the files specified in <u>tomac</u> and transmits them to the Mac subject to the <u>options</u> specified.
       If <u>files</u> also specifies  directories  they  are  followed  recursively,  and  all  files  found  will  be
       transmitted.  If no <u>files</u> parameter is specified, binhex reads a MacBinary stream from standard input and
       transmits the files found; folder information is lost.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In the absence of any options, <u>tomac</u> takes the specified files and transmits them to to the Mac using the
       XMODEM  protocol.   Directories  named  in  <u>files</u>  are  followed  recursively,  all  files  found will be
       transmitted.  Files are assumed to be in MacBinary format.  However, if the filename ends with .info  the
       file  is  assumed to be the info fork of a MacIntosh file split amongst more than one file.  In that case
       the files with .data and .rsrc extensions are also  read  (if  present).   Also,  if  the  info  fork  is
       mentioned  in  the  parameter list, the names of data and resource forks can also be mentioned, but those
       will be ignored (this is to allow wild-card expansion by the shell.)  Further, if some form of AppleShare
       is supported by the installed program, and if the current directory, or  one  of  the  directories  found
       during  recursive  processing, is a directory in the format of the supported version of AppleShare, those
       files will be handled according to the properties of AppleShare.

       <b>-r</b>     No intelligent file-processing is performed; all files named are  assumed  to  be  plain  resource
              files,  and  are transmitted as if they were MacIntosh resource files with creator "RSED" and type
              "RSRC", unless another creator and/or type are specified.

       <b>-d</b>     No intelligent file-processing is performed; all files named are assumed to be plain  data  files,
              and  are  transmitted  as  if  they were MacIntosh data files with creator "MACA" and type "TEXT",
              unless another creator and/or type are specified.

       <b>-u</b>     As -d, but the codes for CR and LF are interchanged.

       <b>-U</b>     Is a synonym for -u.

       <b>-c</b> <b>creator</b>
              Defines the creator name to be used if one of the previous options is specified.

       <b>-t</b> <b>type</b>
              Defines the type name to be used if one of the previous options is specified.

       <b>-l</b>     List every file and directory processed.

       <b>-i</b>     Do not transmit files, give information only (implies -l.)

       <b>-q</b>     Ask the user for every file/directory whether it should be visited (implies -l.)

       <b>-x</b>     Use the XMODEM protocol for transmission.

       <b>-y</b>     Use the YMODEM protocol for transmission (not yet supported.)

       <b>-z</b>     Use the ZMODEM protocol for transmission (not yet supported.)

       <b>-o</b>     Use the pre-beta version of XMODEM.

       <b>-T</b>     Allow for time-out detection during the protocol.  Normally you will not need this option  because
              on occasion, when network delays do occur, time-out detection interferes with a good transmission.
              Also,  when  for  some reason the connection is broken the program will normally receive a hang-up
              signal and terminate.  However, in some situations it might be necessary to early detect time-outs
              (because of communication loss or whatever, without loss of connection).  You should check whether
              use of this option has profits in your situation or not.

       <b>-V</b>     Gives the patchlevel of the program, and other information.  Other options  are  ignored  and  the
              program quits immediately.

       <b>-H</b>     Give  short  information  about  the  options.   Other  options  are ignored and the program quits
              immediately.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       As this is a beta release, there may still be some problems.
