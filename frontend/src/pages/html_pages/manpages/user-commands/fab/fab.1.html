</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fab - Simple Pythonic remote deployment tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
        <u>fab</u> <u>[commands</u> <u>...]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  most  common  method  for utilizing Fabric is via its command-line tool, <b>fab</b>, which should have been
       placed on your shell's executable path when Fabric was installed. <b>fab</b>  tries  hard  to  be  a  good  Unix
       citizen, using a standard style of command-line switches, help output, and so forth.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Basic</b> <b>use</b>
       In  its most simple form, <b>fab</b> may be called with no options at all, and with one or more arguments, which
       should be task names, e.g.:

          $ fab task1 task2

       This will run <b>task1</b> followed by <b>task2</b>, assuming that Fabric was able to find a fabfile nearby  containing
       Python functions with those names.

       However,  it's  possible  to expand this simple usage into something more flexible, by using the provided
       options and/or passing arguments to individual tasks.

   <b>Arbitrary</b> <b>remote</b> <b>shell</b> <b>commands</b>
       New in version 0.9.2.

       Fabric leverages a lesser-known command line convention and may be called in the following manner:

          $ fab [options] -- [shell command]

       where everything after the <b>--</b> is turned into a temporary <b>run</b> call, and is not parsed for <b>fab</b> options.  If
       you've  defined  a  host  list  at  the  module  level or on the command line, this usage will act like a
       one-line anonymous task.

       For example, let's say you just wanted to get the kernel info for a bunch of systems; you could do this:

          $ fab -H system1,system2,system3 -- uname -a

       which would be literally equivalent to the following fabfile:

          from fabric.api import run

          def anonymous():
              run("uname -a")

       as if it were executed thusly:

          $ fab -H system1,system2,system3 anonymous

       Most of the time you will want to just write out the task in your fabfile (anything you use once,  you're
       likely to use again) but this feature provides a handy, fast way to quickly dash off an SSH-borne command
       while leveraging your fabfile's connection settings.

   <b>Command-line</b> <b>options</b>
       A  quick overview of all possible command line options can be found via <b>fab</b> <b>--help</b>. If you're looking for
       details on a specific option, we go into detail below.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          <b>fab</b> uses Python's <u>optparse</u> library, meaning that it honors typical Linux or GNU style short  and  long
          options,  as  well  as  freely  mixing  options  and  arguments.  E.g.  <b>fab</b> <b>task1</b> <b>-H</b> <b>hostname</b> <b>task2</b> <b>-i</b>
          <b>path/to/keyfile</b> is just as valid as the more straightforward <b>fab</b> <b>-H</b> <b>hostname</b> <b>-i</b> <b>path/to/keyfile</b>  <b>task1</b>
          <b>task2</b>.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--no_agent</b>
              Sets  <u>env.no_agent</u>  to  <b>True</b>,  forcing  our  SSH layer not to talk to the SSH agent when trying to
              unlock private key files.

              New in version 0.9.1.

       <b>-A,</b> <b>--forward-agent</b>
              Sets <u>env.forward_agent</u> to <b>True</b>, enabling agent forwarding.

              New in version 1.4.

       <b>--abort-on-prompts</b>
              Sets <u>env.abort_on_prompts</u> to <b>True</b>, forcing Fabric to abort whenever it would prompt for input.

              New in version 1.1.

       <b>-c</b> <b>RCFILE,</b> <b>--config=RCFILE</b>
              Sets <u>env.rcfile</u> to the given file path, which Fabric will try to load on startup and use to update
              environment variables.

       <b>-d</b> <b>COMMAND,</b> <b>--display=COMMAND</b>
              Prints the entire docstring for the given task, if there is one. Does not currently print out  the
              task's function signature, so descriptive docstrings are a good idea. (They're <u>always</u> a good idea,
              of course -- just moreso here.)

       <b>--connection-attempts=M,</b> <b>-n</b> <b>M</b>
              Set number of times to attempt connections. Sets <u>env.connection_attempts</u>.

              <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO:</b>
                 <u>env.connection_attempts</u>, <u>env.timeout</u>

              New in version 1.4.

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--disable-known-hosts</b>
              Sets  <u>env.disable_known_hosts</u>  to  <b>True</b>, preventing Fabric from loading the user's SSH <b>known_hosts</b>
              file.

       <b>-f</b> <b>FABFILE,</b> <b>--fabfile=FABFILE</b>
              The fabfile name pattern to search for (defaults to <b>fabfile.py</b>), or alternately an  explicit  file
              path to load as the fabfile (e.g.  <b>/path/to/my/fabfile.py</b>.)

              <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO:</b>
                 <b>fabfiles</b>

       <b>-F</b> <b>LIST_FORMAT,</b> <b>--list-format=LIST_FORMAT</b>
              Allows control over the output format of <u>--list</u>. <b>short</b> is equivalent to <u>--shortlist</u>, <b>normal</b> is the
              same  as  simply  omitting this option entirely (i.e. the default), and <b>nested</b> prints out a nested
              namespace tree.

              New in version 1.1.

              <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO:</b>
                 <u>--shortlist</u>, <u>--list</u>

       <b>-g</b> <b>HOST,</b> <b>--gateway=HOST</b>
              Sets <u>env.gateway</u> to <b>HOST</b> host string.

              New in version 1.5.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Displays a standard help message, with all possible options and a brief overview of what they  do,
              then exits.

       <b>--hide=LEVELS</b>
              A comma-separated list of <b>output</b> <b>levels</b> to hide by default.

       <b>-H</b> <b>HOSTS,</b> <b>--hosts=HOSTS</b>
              Sets <u>env.hosts</u> to the given comma-delimited list of host strings.

       <b>-x</b> <b>HOSTS,</b> <b>--exclude-hosts=HOSTS</b>
              Sets  <u>env.exclude_hosts</u>  to the given comma-delimited list of host strings to then keep out of the
              final host list.

              New in version 1.1.

       <b>-i</b> <b>KEY_FILENAME</b>
              When set to a file path, will load the given file as an SSH identity file (usually a private key.)
              This option may be repeated multiple times. Sets (or appends to) <u>env.key_filename</u>.

       <b>-I,</b> <b>--initial-password-prompt</b>
              Forces a password prompt at the start of the session (after fabfile load and option  parsing,  but
              before executing any tasks) in order to pre-fill <u>env.password</u>.

              This  is  useful for fire-and-forget runs (especially parallel sessions, in which runtime input is
              not possible) when setting the password via <u>--password</u> or by setting <u>env.password</u> in your fabfile,
              is undesirable.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 The value entered into this prompt will <u>overwrite</u> anything supplied via <u>env.password</u> at  module
                 level, or via <u>--password</u>.

              <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO:</b>
                 <u>password-management</u>

       <b>-k</b>     Sets  <u>env.no_keys</u>  to  <b>True</b>,  forcing the SSH layer to not look for SSH private key files in one's
              home directory.

              New in version 0.9.1.

       <b>--keepalive=KEEPALIVE</b>
              Sets <u>env.keepalive</u> to the given (integer) value, specifying an SSH keepalive interval.

              New in version 1.1.

       <b>--linewise</b>
              Forces output to be buffered line-by-line instead of byte-by-byte. Often useful  or  required  for
              <u>parallel</u> <u>execution</u>.

              New in version 1.3.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--list</b>
              Imports  a  fabfile as normal, but then prints a list of all discovered tasks and exits. Will also
              print the first line of each  task's  docstring,  if  it  has  one,  next  to  it  (truncating  if
              necessary.)

              Changed in version 0.9.1: Added docstring to output.

              <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO:</b>
                 <u>--shortlist</u>, <u>--list-format</u>

       <b>-p</b> <b>PASSWORD,</b> <b>--password=PASSWORD</b>
              Sets  <u>env.password</u>  to  the given string; it will then be used as the default password when making
              SSH connections or calling the <b>sudo</b> program.

              <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO:</b>
                 <u>--initial-password-prompt</u>

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--parallel</b>
              Sets <u>env.parallel</u> to <b>True</b>, causing tasks to run in parallel.

              New in version 1.3.

              <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO:</b>
                 <b>/usage/parallel</b>

       <b>--no-pty</b>
              Sets <u>env.always_use_pty</u> to <b>False</b>, causing all <b>run</b>/<b>sudo</b> calls to behave as  if  one  had  specified
              <b>pty=False</b>.

              New in version 1.0.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--reject-unknown-hosts</b>
              Sets  <u>env.reject_unknown_hosts</u> to <b>True</b>, causing Fabric to abort when connecting to hosts not found
              in the user's SSH <b>known_hosts</b> file.

       <b>-R</b> <b>ROLES,</b> <b>--roles=ROLES</b>
              Sets <u>env.roles</u> to the given comma-separated list of role names.

       <b>--set</b> <b>KEY=VALUE,...</b>
              Allows you to set default values for arbitrary Fabric env vars. Values set this  way  have  a  low
              precedence  --  they  will  not  override  more  specific env vars which are also specified on the
              command line. E.g.:

                 fab --set password=foo --password=bar

              will result in <b>env.password</b> <b>=</b> <b>'bar'</b>, not <b>'foo'</b>

              Multiple <b>KEY=VALUE</b> pairs may be comma-separated, e.g. <b>fab</b> <b>--set</b> <b>var1=val1,var2=val2</b>.

              Other than basic string values, you may also set env vars to True by omitting the <b>=VALUE</b> (e.g. <b>fab</b>
              <b>--set</b> <b>KEY</b>), and you may set values to the empty string (and  thus  a  False-equivalent  value)  by
              keeping the equals sign, but omitting <b>VALUE</b> (e.g. <b>fab</b> <b>--set</b> <b>KEY=</b>.)

              New in version 1.4.

       <b>-s</b> <b>SHELL,</b> <b>--shell=SHELL</b>
              Sets  <u>env.shell</u>  to  the given string, overriding the default shell wrapper used to execute remote
              commands.

       <b>--shortlist</b>
              Similar to <u>--list</u>, but without any embellishment, just task names separated by  newlines  with  no
              indentation or docstrings.

              New in version 0.9.2.

              <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO:</b>
                 <u>--list</u>

       <b>--show=LEVELS</b>
              A comma-separated list of <b>output</b> <b>levels</b> to be added to those that are shown by default.

              <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO:</b>
                 <b>run</b>, <b>sudo</b>

       <b>--ssh-config-path</b>
              Sets <u>env.ssh_config_path</u>.

              New in version 1.4.

                 <u>ssh-config</u>

       <b>--skip-bad-hosts</b>
              Sets <u>env.skip_bad_hosts</u>, causing Fabric to skip unavailable hosts.

              New in version 1.4.

       <b>--skip-unknown-tasks</b>
              Sets <u>env.skip_unknown_tasks</u>, causing Fabric to skip unknown tasks.

                 <u>env.command_timeout</u>,

              New in version 1.6.

       <b>-u</b> <b>USER,</b> <b>--user=USER</b>
              Sets  <u>env.user</u>  to  the given string; it will then be used as the default username when making SSH
              connections.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Displays Fabric's version number, then exits.

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--warn-only</b>
              Sets <u>env.warn_only</u> to <b>True</b>, causing Fabric to continue  execution  even  when  commands  encounter
              error conditions.

       <b>-z,</b> <b>--pool-size</b>
              Sets  <u>env.pool_size</u>,  which  specifies  how  many  processes  to  run concurrently during parallel
              execution.

              New in version 1.3.

                 <b>/usage/parallel</b>

   <b>Per-task</b> <b>arguments</b>
       The options given in <u>command-line-options</u> apply to the invocation of <b>fab</b> as a whole; even if the order is
       mixed around, options still apply to all given tasks equally. Additionally, since tasks are  just  Python
       functions, it's often desirable to pass in arguments to them at runtime.

       Answering both these needs is the concept of "per-task arguments", which is a special syntax you can tack
       onto the end of any task name:

       • Use a colon (<b>:</b>) to separate the task name from its arguments;

       • Use commas (<b>,</b>) to separate arguments from one another (may be escaped by using a backslash, i.e. <b>\,</b>);

       • Use  equals signs (<b>=</b>) for keyword arguments, or omit them for positional arguments. May also be escaped
         with backslashes.

       Additionally, since this process involves string parsing, all values will end up as  Python  strings,  so
       plan  accordingly.  (We  hope  to  improve  upon this in future versions of Fabric, provided an intuitive
       syntax can be found.)

       For example, a "create a new user" task might be defined like so (omitting most of the actual  logic  for
       brevity):

          def new_user(username, admin='no', comment="No comment provided"):
              print("New User (%s): %s" % (username, comment))
              pass

       You can specify just the username:

          $ fab new_user:myusername

       Or treat it as an explicit keyword argument:

          $ fab new_user:username=myusername

       If both args are given, you can again give them as positional args:

          $ fab new_user:myusername,yes

       Or mix and match, just like in Python:

          $ fab new_user:myusername,admin=yes

       The <b>print</b> call above is useful for illustrating escaped commas, like so:

          $ fab new_user:myusername,admin=no,comment='Gary\, new developer (starts Monday)'

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Quoting  the  backslash-escaped  comma  is  required,  as not doing so will cause shell syntax errors.
          Quotes are also needed whenever an argument involves other shell-related characters such as spaces.

       All of the above are translated into the expected Python function calls. For example, the last call above
       would become:

          &gt;&gt;&gt; new_user('myusername', admin='yes', comment='Gary, new developer (starts Monday)')

   <b>Roles</b> <b>and</b> <b>hosts</b>
       As mentioned in <u>the</u> <u>section</u> <u>on</u> <u>task</u> <u>execution</u>, there are a handful of per-task keyword  arguments  (<b>host</b>,
       <b>hosts</b>,  <b>role</b>  and  <b>roles</b>)  which  do  not actually map to the task functions themselves, but are used for
       setting per-task host and/or role lists.

       These special kwargs are <b>removed</b> from the args/kwargs sent to the task function itself; this is  so  that
       you  don't run into TypeErrors if your task doesn't define the kwargs in question. (It also means that if
       you <b>do</b> define arguments with these names, you won't  be  able  to  specify  them  in  this  manner  --  a
       regrettable but necessary sacrifice.)

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          If  both the plural and singular forms of these kwargs are given, the value of the plural will win out
          and the singular will be discarded.

       When using the plural form of these arguments, one must use semicolons (<b>;</b>) since commas are already being
       used to separate arguments from one another.   Furthermore,  since  your  shell  is  likely  to  consider
       semicolons   a  special  character,  you'll  want  to  quote  the  host  list  string  to  prevent  shell
       interpretation, e.g.:

          $ fab new_user:myusername,hosts="host1;host2"

       Again, since the <b>hosts</b> kwarg is removed from the argument list sent to the <b>new_user</b>  task  function,  the
       actual  Python  invocation  would be <b>new_user('myusername')</b>, and the function would be executed on a host
       list of <b>['host1',</b> <b>'host2']</b>.

   <b>Settings</b> <b>files</b>
       Fabric currently honors a simple user settings file, or <b>fabricrc</b> (think <b>bashrc</b> but for <b>fab</b>) which  should
       contain  one or more key-value pairs, one per line. These lines will be subject to <b>string.split('=')</b>, and
       thus can currently only be used to specify string settings. Any such key-value  pairs  will  be  used  to
       update <b>env</b> when <b>fab</b> runs, and is loaded prior to the loading of any fabfile.

       By default, Fabric looks for <b><a href="file:~/.fabricrc">~/.fabricrc</a></b>, and this may be overridden by specifying the <u>-c</u> flag to <b>fab</b>.

       For  example,  if  your  typical SSH login username differs from your workstation username, and you don't
       want to modify <b>env.user</b> in a project's fabfile (possibly because you expect others to use it as well) you
       could write a <b>fabricrc</b> file like so:

          user = ssh_user_name

       Then, when running <b>fab</b>, your fabfile would load up with <b>env.user</b> set to <b>'ssh_user_name'</b>. Other  users  of
       that  fabfile could do the same, allowing the fabfile itself to be cleanly agnostic regarding the default
       username.
