</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>coveralls</b> - Coveralls API client utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>coveralls</b> <u>sub-command</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Coveralls  is  a  command-line utility to interact with Coveralls web service to help you track your code
       coverage over time, and ensure that all your new code is fully covered.

       Coveralls automatically collects your code coverage data, uploads it to their servers  and  gives  you  a
       nice interface to dig into it.

       Any type of Ruby project or test framework supported by SimpleCov is supported by the Coveralls gem. This
       includes all your favorites, like RSpec, Cucumber, and Test::Unit.

</pre><h4><b>SUB-COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>help</b> COMMAND
              Describe available commands or one specific command.

       <b>last</b>   View the last build for this repository on Coveralls.

       <b>open</b>   View this repository on Coveralls.

       <b>push</b>   Runs your test suite and pushes the coverage results to Coveralls.

       <b>report</b> Runs your test suite locally and displays coverage statistics.

       <b>service</b>
              View this repository on your CI service's website.

       <b>version</b>
              See version.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Coveralls for Ruby uses an optional <b>.coveralls.yml</b> file at the root level of your repository to configure
       options.

       The  option <b>repo_token</b> (found on your repository's page on Coveralls) is used to specify which project on
       Coveralls your project maps to. This is only needed for repos not using a CI and should be kept secret --
       anyone could use it to submit coverage data on your repo's  behalf.  This  shouldn't  be  a  concern  for
       private repos, however.

       Another  important option is <b>service_name</b> which allows you to specify where Coveralls should look to find
       additional information about your builds. This can be any string, but using travis-ci or travis-pro  will
       allow Coveralls to fetch branch data, comment on pull requests, and more.
