</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       flatpak-override - Override application requirements

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>flatpak</b> <b>override</b> [OPTION...] [APP]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Overrides the application specified runtime requirements. This can be used to grant a sandboxed
       application more or less resources than it requested.

       By default the application gets access to the resources it requested when it is started. But the user can
       override it on a particular instance by specifying extra arguments to <b>flatpak</b> <b>run</b>, or every time by using
       <b>flatpak</b> <b>override</b>.

       The application overrides are saved in text files residing in $XDG_DATA_HOME/flatpak/overrides in user
       mode.

       If the application ID APP is not specified then the overrides affect all applications, but the
       per-application overrides can override the global overrides.

       Unless overridden with the <b>--user</b> or <b>--installation</b> options, this command changes the default system-wide
       installation.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user</b>
           Update a per-user installation.

       <b>--system</b>
           Update the default system-wide installation.

       <b>--installation=NAME</b>
           Updates a system-wide installation specified by NAME among those defined in
           /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using <b>--installation=default</b> is equivalent to using <b>--system</b>.

       <b>--share=SUBSYSTEM</b>
           Share a subsystem with the host session. This overrides the Context section from the application
           metadata.  SUBSYSTEM must be one of: network, ipc. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--unshare=SUBSYSTEM</b>
           Don't share a subsystem with the host session. This overrides the Context section from the
           application metadata.  SUBSYSTEM must be one of: network, ipc. This option can be used multiple
           times.

       <b>--socket=SOCKET</b>
           Expose a well-known socket to the application. This overrides to the Context section from the
           application metadata.  SOCKET must be one of: x11, wayland, fallback-x11, pulseaudio, system-bus,
           session-bus, ssh-auth, pcsc, cups, gpg-agent, inherit-wayland-socket. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--nosocket=SOCKET</b>
           Don't expose a well-known socket to the application. This overrides to the Context section from the
           application metadata.  SOCKET must be one of: x11, wayland, fallback-x11, pulseaudio, system-bus,
           session-bus, ssh-auth, pcsc, cups, gpg-agent, inherit-wayland-socket. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--device=DEVICE</b>
           Expose a device to the application. This overrides to the Context section from the application
           metadata.  DEVICE must be one of: dri, input, usb, kvm, shm, all. This option can be used multiple
           times.

       <b>--nodevice=DEVICE</b>
           Don't expose a device to the application. This overrides to the Context section from the application
           metadata.  DEVICE must be one of: dri, input, usb, kvm, shm, all. This option can be used multiple
           times.

       <b>--allow=FEATURE</b>
           Allow access to a specific feature. This updates the [Context] group in the metadata.  FEATURE must
           be one of: devel, multiarch, bluetooth, canbus, per-app-dev-shm. This option can be used multiple
           times.

           See <b><a href="../man1/flatpak-build-finish.1.html">flatpak-build-finish</a></b>(1) for the meaning of the various features.

       <b>--disallow=FEATURE</b>
           Disallow access to a specific feature. This updates the [Context] group in the metadata.  FEATURE
           must be one of: devel, multiarch, bluetooth, canbus, per-app-dev-shm. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--filesystem=FILESYSTEM</b>
           Allow the application access to a subset of the filesystem. This overrides to the Context section
           from the application metadata.  FILESYSTEM can be one of: home, host, host-os, host-etc, xdg-desktop,
           xdg-documents, xdg-download, xdg-music, xdg-pictures, xdg-public-share, xdg-templates, xdg-videos,
           xdg-run, xdg-config, xdg-cache, xdg-data, an absolute path, or a homedir-relative path like <a href="file:~/dir">~/dir</a> or
           paths relative to the xdg dirs, like xdg-download/subdir. The optional :ro suffix indicates that the
           location will be read-only. The optional :create suffix indicates that the location will be
           read-write and created if it doesn't exist. This option can be used multiple times. See the
           "[Context] filesystems" list in <b><a href="../man5/flatpak-metadata.5.html">flatpak-metadata</a></b>(5) for details of the meanings of these filesystems.

       <b>--nofilesystem=FILESYSTEM</b>
           Undo the effect of a previous <b>--filesystem=</b>FILESYSTEM in the app's manifest or a lower-precedence
           layer of overrides, and/or remove a previous <b>--filesystem=</b>FILESYSTEM from this layer of overrides.
           This overrides the Context section of the application metadata.  FILESYSTEM can take the same values
           as for <b>--filesystem</b>, but the :ro and :create suffixes are not used here. This option can be used
           multiple times.

           This option does not prevent access to a more narrowly-scoped <b>--filesystem</b>. For example, if an
           application has the equivalent of <b>--filesystem=xdg-config/MyApp</b> in its manifest or as a system-wide
           override, and flatpak override --user --nofilesystem=home as a per-user override, then it will be
           prevented from accessing most of the home directory, but it will still be allowed to access
           $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/MyApp.

           As a special case, <b>--nofilesystem=host:reset</b> will ignore all <b>--filesystem</b> permissions inherited from
           the app manifest or a lower-precedence layer of overrides, in addition to having the behaviour of
           <b>--nofilesystem=host</b>.

       <b>--add-policy=SUBSYSTEM.KEY=VALUE</b>
           Add generic policy option. For example, "--add-policy=subsystem.key=v1 --add-policy=subsystem.key=v2"
           would map to this metadata:

               [Policy subsystem]
               key=v1;v2;

           This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--remove-policy=SUBSYSTEM.KEY=VALUE</b>
           Remove generic policy option. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--env=VAR=VALUE</b>
           Set an environment variable in the application. This overrides to the Context section from the
           application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--unset-env=VAR</b>
           Unset an environment variable in the application. This overrides the unset-environment entry in the
           [Context] group of the metadata, and the [Environment] group. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--env-fd=</b><u>FD</u>
           Read environment variables from the file descriptor <u>FD</u>, and set them as if via <b>--env</b>. This can be
           used to avoid environment variables and their values becoming visible to other users.

           Each environment variable is in the form <u>VAR</u>=<u>VALUE</u> followed by a zero byte. This is the same format
           used by env -0 and <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>*/environ.

       <b>--own-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to own the well-known name NAME on the session bus. This overrides to the
           Context section from the application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--talk-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to talk to the well-known name NAME on the session bus. This overrides to the
           Context section from the application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--no-talk-name=NAME</b>
           Don't allow the application to talk to the well-known name NAME on the session bus. This overrides to
           the Context section from the application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--system-own-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to own the well known name NAME on the system bus. If NAME ends with .*, it
           allows the application to own all matching names. This overrides to the Context section from the
           application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--system-talk-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to talk to the well known name NAME on the system bus. If NAME ends with .*, it
           allows the application to talk to all matching names. This overrides to the Context section from the
           application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--system-no-talk-name=NAME</b>
           Don't allow the application to talk to the well known name NAME on the system bus. If NAME ends with
           .*, it allows the application to talk to all matching names. This overrides to the Context section
           from the application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--persist=FILENAME</b>
           If the application doesn't have access to the real homedir, make the (homedir-relative) path FILENAME
           a bind mount to the corresponding path in the per-application directory, allowing that location to be
           used for persistent data. This overrides to the Context section from the application metadata. This
           option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--reset</b>
           Remove overrides. If an APP is given, remove the overrides for that application, otherwise remove the
           global overrides.

       <b>--show</b>
           Shows overrides. If an APP is given, shows the overrides for that application, otherwise shows the
           global overrides.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Print debug information during command processing.

       <b>--ostree-verbose</b>
           Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
