</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       plinth - a web front end for administering FreedomBox

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>plinth</b> [<b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>] [<b>--server_dir</b> {SERVER_DIR}] [<b>--develop</b>] [<b>--diagnose</b>] [<b>--setup</b> [application...]]
              [<b>--setup-no-install</b> [application...]] [<b>--list-dependencies</b> [application...]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       FreedomBox is a community project to develop, design and promote personal servers running free software
       for private, personal communications. It is a networking appliance designed to allow interfacing with the
       rest of the Internet under conditions of protected privacy and data security. It hosts applications such
       as blog, wiki, website, social network, email, web proxy and a Tor relay on a device that can replace a
       wireless router so that data stays with the users.

       Plinth is a web interface to administer the functions of the FreedomBox. It is extensible and is made of
       modules. Each module provides a simplified user interface to control the underlying functionality of a
       specific application of FreedomBox. As FreedomBox can act as a wireless router, it is possible to
       configure networking from Plinth. Plinth allows configuration of basic system parameters such as time
       zone, hostname and automatic upgrade settings.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--server_dir</b> <b>SERVER_DIR</b>
           This the URL fragment under which Plinth will provide its services. Plinth is shipped with a default
           value of /plinth. This means that Plinth will be available as <a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:8000/plinth by
           default.

       <b>--develop</b>
           Enable development mode. Use develop.config and action scripts from the current working directory.
           Enables extra debug messages, enable Django debug mode for detailed error pages and turn off Django
           security features. Monitor source files for changes and restart Plinth on modifications. Die if there
           is an error during module initialization.

       <b>--diagnose</b>
           If provided, Plinth loads modules, performs initialization but does start the web server. Instead it
           runs diagnostic tests on each module and exits.

       <b>--setup</b>
           Perform application setup operations and exit. Setting up an application involves installing packages
           required for that application and performing pre and post install configuration setups. If no
           application is provided, setup all applications which describe themselves as essential. If a list of
           applications is provided, setup only those applications.

       <b>--setup-no-install</b>
           Same as <b>--setup</b> but no new Debian packages are installed during setup. When a package needs to be
           installed, a check is done to make sure the package is already installed. If the package is already
           installed, no upgrade is performed and setup skips this step and proceeds to next operation. If the
           package is not installed an error is raised and setup process halts. This is option is useful for
           running setup during post installation script of a Debian package. Essential packages are added as
           dependencies for the Debian package and then setup process is executed from post install script of
           the Debian package.

       <b>--list-dependencies</b>
           For the list of provided applications, print the list of packages needed by the applications. If no
           application is provided as additional argument, then print list of packages needed by all essential
           applications. If '*' is provided in the list of the applications, then list of packages needed by all
           applications will be printed. Although, packages are installed when the application is first
           accessed, this list will be useful for adding list of dependencies to a Debian package and to get a
           list of all interesting packages. Other output may be printed on stderr and should be ignored.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Plinth reads various configuration options from the files /usr/share/freedombox/freedombox.config,
       /usr/share/freedombox/freedombox.config.d/*.config, /etc/plinth/plinth.config,
       /etc/plinth/plinth.config.d/*.config, /etc/freedombox/freedombox.config and
       /etc/freedombox/freedombox.config.d/*.config in that order. Options in a file read later override options
       specified earlier.  /etc/plinth/ locations are deprecated.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Example</b> <b>1.</b> <b>Start</b> <b>Plinth</b> <b>with</b> <b>default</b> <b>options</b>

           $ plinth

       Run Plinth as guided by configuration file.

       <b>Example</b> <b>2.</b> <b>Run</b> <b>Plinth</b> <b>with</b> <b>different</b> <b>URL</b> <b>prefix</b>

           $ plinth --server_dir='/myurl'

       Run Plinth with the '/myurl' prefix. Note that Apache forwards requests to '/plinth' by default, so
       /myurl is not accessible outside of your FreedomBox without adapting the apache configuration.

       <b>Example</b> <b>3.</b> <b>Run</b> <b>Plinth</b> <b>in</b> <b>development</b> <b>mode</b>

           $ plinth --develop

       Run in development mode on the terminal. Enable auto-reloading and more extensive debugging.
