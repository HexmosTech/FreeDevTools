</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CuteSDR - a simple demodulation and spectrum display program

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Its primary purpose is for spawning custom applications or for educational use. It is NOT a full featured
       program  as  it  is  purposely  kept  simple  in  order  for developers to more easily spin off their own
       applications. A further goal was to use only the stock functionality of Qt ie  no  libraries  or  special
       drivers. This limits CuteSDR to using only a network connection.

       The  application is compatible with the SDR-IP and NetSDR networked software defined radio receivers made
       by RFSPACE, Inc. of Atlanta, GA

       Running with other receivers that have USB interfaces (such as  the  SDR-IQ)  is  made  possible  by  the
       siqs_ftdi program.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>CuteSDR</b>
