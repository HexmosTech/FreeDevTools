</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wapiti</b> - A web application vulnerability scanner in Python

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wapiti</b> -u <u>BASE_URL</u> [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Wapiti allows you to audit the security of your web applications.

       It  performs  "black-box" scans, i.e. it does not study the source code of the application but will scans
       the webpages of the deployed webapp, looking for scripts and forms where it can inject data.

       Once it gets this list, Wapiti acts like a fuzzer, injecting payloads to see if a script is vulnerable.

       Wapiti is useful only to discover vulnerabilities: it is not  an  exploitation  tools.  Some  well  known
       applications can be used for the exploitation part like the recommended sqlmap.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>SUMMARY</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>TARGET</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       •   <b>-u</b>, <b>--url</b> <u>URL</u>
           The URL that will be used as the base for the scan. Every URL found during the scan will  be  checked
           against the base URL and the corresponding scan scope (see --scope for details).
           This is the only required argument. The scheme part of the URL must be either http or https.

       •   <b>--scope</b> <u>SCOPE</u>
           Define the scope of the scan and attacks. Valid choices are :

       •   url : will only scan and attack the exact base URL given with -u option.

       •   page : will attack every URL matching the path of the base URL (every query string variation).

       •   folder : will scan and attack every URL starting with the base URL value. This base URL should have a
           trailing slash (no filename).

       •   domain : will scan and attack every URL whose domain name match the one from the base URL.

       •   punk : will scan and attack every URL found whatever the domain. Think twice before using that scope.

</pre><h4><b>ATTACK</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       •   <b>-m</b>, <b>--module</b> <u>MODULE_LIST</u>
           Set the list of attack modules (modules names separated with commas) to launch against the target.
           Default behavior (when the option is not set) is to use the most common modules.
           Common modules can also be specified using the "common" keyword.
           If you want to use common modules along with XXE module you can pass -m common,xxe.
           Activating all modules can be done with the "all" keyword (not recommended though).
           To launch a scan without launching any attack, just give an empty value (-m "").
           You can filter on http methods too (only get or post). For example -m "xss:get,exec:post".

       •   <b>--list-modules</b>
           Print the list of available Wapiti modules along with a short description then exit.

       •   <b>-l</b>, <b>--level</b> <u>LEVEL</u>
           In  previous versions Wapiti used to inject attack payloads in query strings even if no parameter was
           present in the original URL.
           While it may be successful in finding vulnerabilities that way, it was causing too many requests  for
           not enough success.
           This behavior is now hidden behind this option and can be reactivated by setting -l to 2.
           It may be useful on CGIs when developers have to parse the query-string themselves.
           Default value for this option is 1.

</pre><h4><b>PROXY</b> <b>AND</b> <b>AUTHENTICATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       •   <b>-p</b>, <b>--proxy</b> <u>PROXY_URL</u>
           The  given  URL  will  be  used  as a proxy for HTTP and HTTPS requests. This URL can have one of the
           following scheme : http, https, socks.

       •   <b>--tor</b>
           Make Wapiti use a Tor listener (same as --proxy socks://127.0.0.1:9050/)

       •   <b>-a</b>, <b>--auth-cred</b> <u>CREDENTIALS</u>
           Set credentials to use for authentication on the target.
           Given value should be in the form login%password (% is used as a separator)

       •   <b>--auth-type</b> <u>TYPE</u>
           Set the authentication mechanism to use. Valid choices are basic, digest,  kerberos,  ntlm  and  post
           (web login form).
           Kerberos  and  NTLM  authentication  may  require  you  to  install additional Python modules. "Post"
           authentication could be combined with <b>-s</b> to specify where to find the login form.

       •   <b>-c</b>, <b>--cookie</b> <u>COOKIE_FILE</u>
           Load cookies from a Wapiti JSON cookie file. See <a href="../man1/wapiti-getcookie.1.html">wapiti-getcookie</a>(1) for more information.

</pre><h4><b>SESSION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Since Wapiti 3.0.0, scanned URLs, discovered vulnerabilities and attacks status  are  stored  in  sqlite3
       databases used as Wapiti session files.
       Default  behavior  when  a previous scan session exists for the given base URL and scope is to resume the
       scan and attack status.
       Following options allows you to bypass this behavior/

       •   <b>--skip-crawl</b>
           If a previous scan was performed but wasn´t finished, don´t resume the scan. Attack will be  made  on
           currently known URLs without scanning more.

       •   <b>--resume-crawl</b>
           If  the crawl was previously stopped and attacks started, default behavior is to skip crawling if the
           session is restored.
           Use this option in order to continue the scan process while keeping vulnerabilities  and  attacks  in
           the session.

       •   <b>--flush-attacks</b>
           Forget everything about discovered vulnerabilities and which URL was attacked by which module.
           Only the scan (crawling) information will be kept.

       •   <b>--flush-session</b>
           Forget everything about the target for the given scope.

       •   <b>--store-session</b> <u>PATH</u> Specify an alternative path for storing session (.db and .pkl) files.

       •   <b>--store-config</b>  <u>PATH</u>  Specify  an  alternative  path  for  storing  particular  module (<b>apps.json</b> and
           <b>nikto_db</b>) files.

</pre><h4><b>SCAN</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ATTACKS</b> <b>TUNING</b></h4><pre>
       •   <b>-s</b>, <b>--start</b> <u>URL</u>
           If for some reasons, Wapiti doesn´t find any (or enough) URLs from the base URL  you  can  still  add
           URLs to start the scan with.
           Those URLs will be given a depth of 0, just like the base URL.
           This option can be called several times.
           You  can  also  give  it  a  filename  and  Wapiti  will read URLs from the given file (must be UTF-8
           encoded), one URL per line. Combined with <b>--auth-type=post</b>, Wapiti will try to find a login  form  on
           the first URL provided and to authenticate with the given credentials.

       •   <b>-x</b>, <b>--exclude</b> <u>URL</u>
           Prevent  the  given  URL  from  being scanned. Common use is to exclude the logout URL to prevent the
           destruction of session cookies (if you specified a cookie file with --cookie).
           This option can be applied several times. Excluded URL given as a parameter can contain wildcards for
           basic pattern matching.

       •   <b>-r</b>, <b>--remove</b> <u>PARAMETER</u>
           If the given parameter is found in scanned URL it will be automatically removed (URLs are edited).
           This option can be used several times.

       •   <b>--skip</b> <u>PARAMETER</u>
           Given parameter will be kept in URLs and forms but won´t be attacked.
           Useful if you already know non-vulnerable parameters.

       •   <b>-d</b>, <b>--depth</b> <u>DEPTH</u>
           When Wapiti crawls a website it gives each found URL a depth value.
           The base URL, and additional starting URLs (-s) are given a depth of 0.
           Each link found in thoses URLs got a depth of 1, and so on.
           Default maximum depth is 40 and is very large.
           This limit make sure the scan will stop at some time.
           For a fast scan a depth inferior to 5 is recommanded.

       •   <b>--max-links-per-page</b> <u>MAX</u>
           This is another option to be able to reduce the number of URLs discovered by the crawler.
           Only the first MAX links of each webpage will be extracted.
           This option is not really effective as the same link may appear on different webpages.
           It should be useful is rare conditions, for exeample when there is a lot  a  webpages  without  query
           string.

       •   <b>--max-files-per-dir</b> <u>MAX</u>
           Limit the number of URLs to crawl under each folder found on the webserver.
           Note that an URL with a trailing slash in the path is not necessarily a folder with Wapiti will treat
           it as its is.
           Like the previous option it should be useful only in certain situations.

       •   <b>--max-scan-time</b>  <u>SECONDS</u> Stop the scan after SECONDS seconds if it is still running. Should be useful
           to automatise scanning from another process (continuous testing).

       •   <b>--max-attack-time</b> <u>SECONDS</u> Each attack module will stop after SECONDS seconds if it is still  running.
           Should be useful to automatise scanning from another process (continuous testing).

       •   <b>--max-parameters</b> <u>MAX</u>
           URLs  and  forms  having  more  than  MAX  input parameters will be discarded before launching attack
           modules.

       •   <b>-S</b>, <b>--scan-force</b> <u>FORCE</u>
           The more input parameters an URL or form have, the more requests Wapiti will send.
           The sum of requests can grow rapidly and attacking a form with 40 or more input  fields  can  take  a
           huge amount of time.
           Wapiti  use  a  mathematical  formula to reduce the numbers of URLs scanned for a given pattern (same
           variables names) when the number of parameters grows.
           The formula is <b>maximum_allowed_patterns</b> <b>=</b> <b>220</b> <b>/</b> <b>(math.exp(number_of_parameters</b> <b>*</b> <b>factor)</b> <b>**</b> <b>2)</b>  where
           factor is an internal value controller by the <u>FORCE</u> value you give as an option.
           Available choices are : paranoid, sneaky, polite, normal, aggressive, insane.
           Default value is normal (147 URLs for 1 parameter, 30 for 5, 5 for 10, 1 for 14 or more).
           Insane mode just remove the calculation of those limits, every URL will be attacked.
           Paranoid mode will attack 30 URLs with 1 parameter, 5 for 2, and just 1 for 3 and more).

       •   <b>--endpoint</b> <u>URL</u> Some attack modules are using an HTTP endpoint to check for vulnerabilities.
           For  example  the  SSRF  module inject the endpoint URL into webpage arguments to check if the target
           script try to fetch that URL.
           Default endpoint is <a href="http://wapiti3.ovh/">http://wapiti3.ovh/</a>. Keep in mind that the target and your computer must be  able
           to join that endpoint for the module to work.
           On internal pentests this endpoint may not be accessible to the target hence you may prefer to set up
           your own endpoint.
           This option will set both internal and external endpoint URL to the same value.

       •   <b>--internal-endpoint</b> <u>URL</u> You may want to specify an internal endpoint different from the external one.
           The internal endpoint is used by Wapiti to fetch results of attacks.
           If you are behind a NAT it may be an URL for a local server (for example <a href="http://192.168.0.1/">http://192.168.0.1/</a>)

       •   <b>--external-endpoint</b>  <u>URL</u>  Set  the  endpoint  URL  (the  one  that  the  target will fetch in case of
           vulnerability).
           Using your own endpoint may reduce risk of being caught by NIDS or WAF.

</pre><h4><b>HTTP</b> <b>AND</b> <b>NETWORK</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       •   <b>-t</b>, <b>--timemout</b> <u>SECONDS</u>
           Time to wait (in seconds) for a HTTP response before considering failure.

       •   <b>-H</b>, <b>--header</b> <u>HEADER</u>
           Set a custom HTTM header to inject in every request sent by Wapiti. This option can be  used  several
           times.
           Value should be a standard HTTP header line (parameter and value separated with a : sign).

       •   <b>-A</b>, <b>--user-agent</b> <u>AGENT</u>
           Default  behavior  of Wapiti is to use the same User-Agent as the TorBrowser, making it discreet when
           crawling standard website or .onion ones.
           But you may have to change it to bypass some restrictions so this option is here.

       •   <b>--verify-ssl</b> <u>VALUE</u>
           Wapiti doesn´t care of certificates validation by default. That behavior can be changed by passing  1
           as a value to that option.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Wapiti prints its status to standard output. The two following options allow one to tune the output.

       •   <b>--color</b>
           Outpout  will  be  colorized  based  on  the severity of the information (red is critical, orange for
           warnings, green for information).

       •   <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b> <u>LEVEL</u>
           Set the level of verbosity for the  output.  Possible  values  are  quiet  (O),  normal  (1,  default
           behavior) and verbose (2).

</pre><h4><b>REPORT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Wapiti will generate a report at the end of the attack process. Several formats of reports are available.

       •   <b>-f</b>, <b>--format</b> <u>FORMAT</u>
           Set the format of the report. Valid choices are json, html, txt and xml.
           Although  the  HTML  reports  were rewritten to be more responsive, they still are impracticable when
           there is a lot of found vulnerabilities.

       •   <b>-o</b>, <b>--output</b> <u>OUTPUT_PATH</u>
           Set the path were the report will be generated.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       •   <b>--version</b>
           Print Wapiti version then exit.

       •   <b>--no-bugreport</b>
           If a Wapiti attack module crashes of a non-caught exception a bug report is generated  and  sent  for
           analysis in order to improve Wapiti reliability. Note that only the content of the report is kept.
           You can still prevent reports from being sent using that option.

       •   <b>--update</b>  Update  particular  Wapiti  modules (download a fresh version of the <b>apps.json</b> and <b>nikto_db</b>
           files) then exit. You can combine it with <b>--store-config</b> to specify where to store downloaded files.

       •   <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show detailed options description. More details are available in this manpage though.
