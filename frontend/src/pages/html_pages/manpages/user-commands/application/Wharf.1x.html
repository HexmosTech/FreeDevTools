</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Wharf</b> - AfterStep module for launching or docking applications aka button bar

</pre><h4><b>MyStyle</b> <b>DEFINITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       MyStyle "*WharfTile"

              Specifies  the  style  of  the  wharf  button tiles, including background color, background pixmap
              (which may be transparent), and background gradient. This method of specifying the  background  is
              preferred  over  the  BgColor,  MaxColors, Pixmap, TextureColor, and TextureType options, although
              those (older) options do still work. See <u>MyStyle</u> format for details.

       MyStyle "*WharfOddTile"

              Specifies the style of every odd wharf button tile. See <u>MyStyle</u> format for details.

       MyStyle "*WharfFocusedTile"

              Specifies the style of the wharf button tile under the mouse pointer, including background  color,
              background  pixmap  (which  may  be  transparent), and background gradient. See <u>MyStyle</u> format for
              details.

       MyStyle "*WharfOddFocusedTile"

              Specifies the style of every odd wharf button tile under the mouse pointer. See <u>MyStyle</u> format for
              details.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       AlignContents <u>Left,Top,Right,Bottom,HTiled,VTiled,HScaled,VScaled,HCenter,VCenter</u>

              That will force contents of each Wharf's button to be aligned to either side of the  button,  when
              FitContents is not used.

              See Also: Alignment flags for further details.

       Animate

              If specified, the opening and closing of Folders will be animated, rather than simply drawn in one
              frame.

       AnimateDelay

              Specifies  the  <u>delay</u> in milliseconds that the animation will pause between each move when opening
              or closing a folder.

       AnimateMain

              Designates that full-length <b>Wharf</b> withdraws will be animated.

       AnimateSteps

              Specifies the <u>steps</u> a Folder takes in animating while opening or closing. This translates into the
              Folder button moving button-size/ <u>steps</u> pixels each step.

       AnimateStepsMain

              Specifies the <u>steps</u> the main Wharf takes in iconification or de-iconification upon mouse button  3
              being pressed. This translates into the main Wharf moving &lt;button-size&gt;/ <u>steps</u> pixels each step.

       BalloonBorderHilite

              Defines bevel to be drawn around balloons - replaces the BorderWidth setting.

              See Also: Bevel flags for further details.

       BalloonCloseDelay <u>number</u>

              Specifies the period in milliseconds to delay the disappearance of the balloon when leaving window
              with the mouse.

       BalloonDelay <u>number</u>

              Specifies the period in milliseconds to delay the appearance of the balloon.

       BalloonStyle <u>MyStyle</u>

              MyStyle to be used to draw balloon. Note that balloons could be shaped (BackPixmap 125 and 126).

       BalloonTextPaddingX size

              width of the border around the text in balloons.

       BalloonTextPaddingY size

              height of the border around the text in balloons.

       BalloonXOffset

              The  balloon  window  is  positioned  to  be  horizontally centered against the <b>Wharf</b> window it is
              describing. The horizontal position may be set as an offset. Negative  offsets  of-Nare  placed  <u>N</u>
              pixels  left  of the <b>Wharf</b> window, positive offsets of <u>+N</u> are placed <u>N</u> pixels right of the window.
              Defaults to +2.

       BalloonYOffset

              The balloon window is positioned to be horizontally  centered  against  the  <b>Wharf</b>  window  it  is
              describing.  The  vertical  position  may  be  set as an offset. Negative offsets of-Nare placed <u>N</u>
              pixels above the <b>Wharf</b> window, positive offsets of <u>+N</u> are placed <u>N</u> pixels below. Defaults to +2.

       Balloons

              Turns on the balloon feature. A "balloon" is displayed showing the name of the button the  pointer
              is  resting  on  in  the  <b>Wharf</b>  . The balloon background and text are configured with the MyStyle
              "*WharfBalloon". See <u><a href="../man1x/afterstep.1x.html">afterstep</a>(1x)</u> for more information on MyStyles.

       Bevel <u>None|[Left,Top,Right,Bottom,Extra,NoOutline]</u>

              Determines exact size and shape of the 3D bevel drawn around each button. This option is  somewhat
              synonymous  to  NoBorder.  If  NoBorder  is encountered after Bevel - then it will override Bevel,
              otherwise Bevel will override NoBorder.

              See Also: Bevel flags for further details.

       Columns

              Specifies the number of <u>columns</u> of buttons to be created. This will give  your  <b>Wharf</b>  a  vertical
              layout, with the number of columns equal to the number specificed in <u>columns</u> . If unspecified, the
              number  of columns will be set to 1. If the <u>columns</u> are set to a number greater than 1, then there
              will be that number of columns with enough rows to satisfy the requested number of  buttons.  Only
              one of <u>*WharfRows</u> or <u>*WharfColumns</u> should be specified.

       CompositionMethod <u>testure_type</u>

              Determines  algorithm used to blend all the icons and Wharf background to form the button's image.
              Valid es are 130-145 ( see MyStyles section ). The default value is 131 ( alpha-blending )

       FitContents

              Wharf will draw each button so that it fits its contents perfectly (icon or swallowed app ).  That
              will  cause  some  of  the  Wharf's buttons to differ in size from others. Use in conjunction with
              ShapeToContents.

       FlipLabel

              Will cause Wharf to draw vertical label text.

       FolderOffset <u>size</u>

              sets the distance between opened folder and its parent.

       ForceSize <u>Size</u>

              If specified, will force pixmaps to Size instead of the default of 64x64. This has  no  effect  on
              the Size of the displayed icons (they will be croped if larger).

       Geometry

              Specifies  the  <b>Wharf</b>  window  location  and/or  size.  If  the  size is not specified, Wharf will
              auto-size itself in  a  reasonable  manner.  The  <u>geometry</u>  is  a  standard  X11  window  geometry
              specification; see <u><a href="../man3x/XParseGeometry.3x.html">XParseGeometry</a>(3x)</u> , and <u>EXAMPLES</u> (below) for further details.

       LabelLocation <u>number</u>

              Specifies  the  location of the label. Correct values are integers from 0-32. label could be drawn
              on each side of the button and just on top of icon. It could also be aligned to different sides.

       MyStyle

              Specifies the style of the wharf button  tiles,  including  background  color,  background  pixmap
              (which  may  be transparent), and background gradient. This method of specifying the background is
              preferred over the BgColor, MaxColors, Pixmap, TextureColor,  and  TextureType  options,  although
              those (older) options do still work.

              See Also: MyStyle definition for further details.

       NoBalloons

              Do not show Balloons in Wharf.

       OrthogonalFolderOffset <u>size</u>

              sets the offset of an opened folder relative to its parent orthogonal to the opening direction. In
              other words this can be used to move the opened folder parallel to its parent

       Rows

              Specifies  the  number  of  <u>rows</u>  of buttons to be created. This will give your <b>Wharf</b> a horizontal
              layout, with the number of rows equal to the number specified in <u>rows</u> . If unspecified, the number
              of rows will be set to 1. If the <u>rows</u> are set to a number greater than 1, then there will be  that
              number  of  rows  with  enough  columns  to  satisfy  the requested number of buttons. Only one of
              <u>*WharfRows</u> or <u>*WharfColumns</u> should be specified.

       ShapeToContents

              Will cause Wharf to use X Shaped extensions and have a window of non-rectangular shape.  Shape  is
              composed  from  the  overall geometry of buttons ( see FitContents ), shape of the MyStyle used to
              draw Wharf background ( if BackPixmap 126 or 125 is used ), contents of  each  button  -  such  as
              swallowed app's shape, label and icons.

       ShowHints

              FIXME: add proper description here.

              See Also: Balloon Contents flags for further details.

       ShowLabel

              Tells  Wharf to render a label on each of its buttons, effectively immitating the behaviour of the
              discontinued Zharf module.

       Sound

              FIXME: add proper description here.

              See Also: Wharf sound definition for further details.

       StretchBackground

              This should allow for all kinds of skins where each button is just a part of large shaped figure.

       WithdrawStyle

              Specifies the circumstances under which button 3 should cause the Wharf to withdraw to  a  corner.
              If style is 0, button 3 will do nothing. If style is 1 (the default), a click on any button in the
              toplevel  bar will cause Wharf to withdraw to the nearest corner. If style is 2, a click on either
              the first or the last button in the toplevel bar will cause the withdrawal.
