</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       flatpak-run - Run an application or open a shell in a runtime

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>flatpak</b> <b>run</b> [OPTION...] REF [ARG...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       If REF names an installed application, Flatpak runs the application in a sandboxed environment. Extra
       arguments are passed on to the application. The current branch and arch of the application is used unless
       otherwise specified with <b>--branch</b> or <b>--arch</b>. See <b><a href="../man1/flatpak-make-current.1.html">flatpak-make-current</a></b>(1).

       If REF names a runtime, a shell is opened in the runtime. This is useful for development and testing. If
       there is ambiguity about which branch to use, you will be prompted to choose. Use <b>--branch</b> to avoid this.
       The primary arch is used unless otherwise specified with <b>--arch</b>.

       By default, Flatpak will look for the application or runtime in the per-user installation first, then in
       all system installations. This can be overridden with the <b>--user</b>, <b>--system</b> and <b>--installation</b> options.

       Flatpak creates a sandboxed environment for the application to run in by mounting the right runtime at
       <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> and a writable directory at <a href="file:/var">/var</a>, whose content is preserved between application runs. The
       application itself is mounted at /app.

       The details of the sandboxed environment are controlled by the application metadata and various options
       like <b>--share</b> and <b>--socket</b> that are passed to the run command: Access is allowed if it was requested
       either in the application metadata file or with an option and the user hasn't overridden it.

       The remaining arguments are passed to the command that gets run in the sandboxed environment. See the
       <b>--file-forwarding</b> option for handling of file arguments.

       Environment variables are generally passed on to the sandboxed application, with certain exceptions. The
       application metadata can override environment variables, as well as the <b>--env</b> option. Apart from that,
       Flatpak always unsets or overrides the following variables, since their session values are likely to
       interfere with the functioning of the sandbox:
           PATH
           LD_LIBRARY_PATH
           LD_PRELOAD
           LD_AUDIT
           XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
           XDG_DATA_DIRS
           SHELL
           TEMP
           TEMPDIR
           TMP
           TMPDIR
           XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
           container
           TZDIR
           PYTHONPATH
           PERLLIB
           PERL5LIB
           XCURSOR_PATH
           GST_PLUGIN_PATH_1_0
           GST_REGISTRY
           GST_REGISTRY_1_0
           GST_PLUGIN_PATH
           GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH
           GST_PLUGIN_SCANNER
           GST_PLUGIN_SCANNER_1_0
           GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH_1_0
           GST_PRESET_PATH
           GST_PTP_HELPER
           GST_PTP_HELPER_1_0
           GST_INSTALL_PLUGINS_HELPER
           KRB5CCNAME
           XKB_CONFIG_ROOT
           GIO_EXTRA_MODULES
           GDK_BACKEND
           VK_ADD_DRIVER_FILES
           VK_ADD_LAYER_PATH
           VK_DRIVER_FILES
           VK_ICD_FILENAMES
           VK_LAYER_PATH
           __EGL_EXTERNAL_PLATFORM_CONFIG_DIRS
           __EGL_EXTERNAL_PLATFORM_CONFIG_FILENAMES
           __EGL_VENDOR_LIBRARY_DIRS
           __EGL_VENDOR_LIBRARY_FILENAMES

       Also several environment variables with the prefix "GST_" that are used by gstreamer are unset (since
       Flatpak 1.12.5).

       Flatpak also overrides the XDG environment variables to point sandboxed applications at their writable
       filesystem locations below <a href="file:~/.var/app/">~/.var/app/</a>$APPID/:
           XDG_DATA_HOME
           XDG_CONFIG_HOME
           XDG_CACHE_HOME
           XDG_STATE_HOME (since Flatpak 1.13)

       Apps can use the <b>--persist=.local/state</b> and <b>--unset-env=XDG_STATE_HOME</b> options to get a Flatpak
       1.13-compatible <a href="file:~/.local/state">~/.local/state</a> on older versions of Flatpak.

       The host values of these variables are made available inside the sandbox via these HOST_-prefixed
       variables:
           HOST_XDG_DATA_HOME
           HOST_XDG_CONFIG_HOME
           HOST_XDG_CACHE_HOME
           HOST_XDG_STATE_HOME (since Flatpak 1.13)

       Flatpak sets the environment variable <b>FLATPAK_ID</b> to the application ID of the running app.

       Flatpak also bind-mounts as read-only the host's <a href="file:/etc/os-release">/etc/os-release</a> (if available, or <a href="file:/usr/lib/os-release">/usr/lib/os-release</a> as
       a fallback) to /run/host/os-release in accordance with the <b>os-release</b> <b>specification</b>[1].

       If parental controls support is enabled, flatpak will check the current userâ€™s parental controls
       settings, and will refuse to run an app if it is blocklisted for the current user.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Show help options and exit.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--user</b>
           Look for the application and runtime in per-user installations.

       <b>--system</b>
           Look for the application and runtime in the default system-wide installations.

       <b>--installation=NAME</b>
           Look for the application and runtime in the system-wide installation specified by NAME among those
           defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using <b>--installation=default</b> is equivalent to using
           <b>--system</b>.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Print debug information during command processing.

       <b>--ostree-verbose</b>
           Print OSTree debug information during command processing.

       <b>--arch=ARCH</b>
           The architecture to run. See <b>flatpak</b> <b>--supported-arches</b> for architectures supported by the host.

       <b>--command=COMMAND</b>
           The command to run instead of the one listed in the application metadata.

       <b>--cwd=DIR</b>
           The directory to run the command in. Note that this must be a directory inside the sandbox.

       <b>--branch=BRANCH</b>
           The branch to use.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--devel</b>
           Use the devel runtime that is specified in the application metadata instead of the regular runtime,
           and use a seccomp profile that is less likely to break development tools.

       <b>--runtime=RUNTIME</b>
           Use this runtime instead of the one that is specified in the application metadata. This is a full
           tuple, like for example org.freedesktop.Sdk/x86_64/1.2, but partial tuples are allowed. Any empty or
           missing parts are filled in with the corresponding values specified by the app.

       <b>--runtime-version=VERSION</b>
           Use this version of the runtime instead of the one that is specified in the application metadata.
           This overrides any version specified with the --runtime option.

       <b>--share=SUBSYSTEM</b>
           Share a subsystem with the host session. This overrides the Context section from the application
           metadata.  SUBSYSTEM must be one of: network, ipc. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--unshare=SUBSYSTEM</b>
           Don't share a subsystem with the host session. This overrides the Context section from the
           application metadata.  SUBSYSTEM must be one of: network, ipc. This option can be used multiple
           times.

       <b>--socket=SOCKET</b>
           Expose a well known socket to the application. This overrides to the Context section from the
           application metadata.  SOCKET must be one of: x11, wayland, fallback-x11, pulseaudio, system-bus,
           session-bus, ssh-auth, pcsc, cups, gpg-agent, inherit-wayland-socket. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--nosocket=SOCKET</b>
           Don't expose a well known socket to the application. This overrides to the Context section from the
           application metadata.  SOCKET must be one of: x11, wayland, fallback-x11, pulseaudio, system-bus,
           session-bus, ssh-auth, pcsc, cups, gpg-agent, inherit-wayland-socket. This option can be used
           multiple times.

       <b>--device=DEVICE</b>
           Expose a device to the application. This overrides to the Context section from the application
           metadata.  DEVICE must be one of: dri, usb, input, kvm, shm, all. This option can be used multiple
           times.

       <b>--nodevice=DEVICE</b>
           Don't expose a device to the application. This overrides to the Context section from the application
           metadata.  DEVICE must be one of: dri, usb, input, kvm, shm, all. This option can be used multiple
           times.

       <b>--allow=FEATURE</b>
           Allow access to a specific feature. This overrides to the Context section from the application
           metadata.  FEATURE must be one of: devel, multiarch, bluetooth. This option can be used multiple
           times.

           See <b><a href="../man1/flatpak-build-finish.1.html">flatpak-build-finish</a></b>(1) for the meaning of the various features.

       <b>--disallow=FEATURE</b>
           Disallow access to a specific feature. This overrides to the Context section from the application
           metadata.  FEATURE must be one of: devel, multiarch, bluetooth. This option can be used multiple
           times.

       <b>--filesystem=FILESYSTEM</b>
           Allow the application access to a subset of the filesystem. This overrides to the Context section
           from the application metadata.  FILESYSTEM can be one of: home, host, host-os, host-etc, xdg-desktop,
           xdg-documents, xdg-download, xdg-music, xdg-pictures, xdg-public-share, xdg-templates, xdg-videos,
           xdg-run, xdg-config, xdg-cache, xdg-data, an absolute path, or a homedir-relative path like <a href="file:~/dir">~/dir</a> or
           paths relative to the xdg dirs, like xdg-download/subdir. The optional :ro suffix indicates that the
           location will be read-only. The optional :create suffix indicates that the location will be
           read-write and created if it doesn't exist. This option can be used multiple times. See the
           "[Context] filesystems" list in <b><a href="../man5/flatpak-metadata.5.html">flatpak-metadata</a></b>(5) for details of the meanings of these filesystems.

       <b>--nofilesystem=FILESYSTEM</b>
           Undo the effect of a previous <b>--filesystem=</b>FILESYSTEM in the app's manifest and/or the overrides set
           up with <b><a href="../man1/flatpak-override.1.html">flatpak-override</a></b>(1). This overrides the Context section of the application metadata.
           FILESYSTEM can take the same values as for <b>--filesystem</b>, but the :ro and :create suffixes are not
           used here. This option can be used multiple times.

           This option does not prevent access to a more narrowly-scoped <b>--filesystem</b>. For example, if an
           application has the equivalent of <b>--filesystem=xdg-config/MyApp</b> in its manifest or as a system-wide
           override, and flatpak override --user --nofilesystem=home as a per-user override, then it will be
           prevented from accessing most of the home directory, but it will still be allowed to access
           $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/MyApp.

           As a special case, <b>--nofilesystem=host:reset</b> will ignore all <b>--filesystem</b> permissions inherited from
           the app manifest or <b><a href="../man1/flatpak-override.1.html">flatpak-override</a></b>(1), in addition to having the behaviour of <b>--nofilesystem=host</b>.

       <b>--add-policy=SUBSYSTEM.KEY=VALUE</b>
           Add generic policy option. For example, "--add-policy=subsystem.key=v1 --add-policy=subsystem.key=v2"
           would map to this metadata:

               [Policy subsystem]
               key=v1;v2;

           This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--remove-policy=SUBSYSTEM.KEY=VALUE</b>
           Remove generic policy option. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--usb=TYPE[:DATA]</b>
           Adds a USB device query to the application metadata. This allows device enumeration and usage by the
           USB portal.  TYPE must be one of: all, cls, dev, vnd.

           <b>all</b>
               Match all devices.

           <b>cls</b>
               A device class and subclass query.  DATA must be in the form of CLASS:SUBCLASS where both CLASS
               and SUBCLASS must be a valid 2-digit hexadecimal class id number. Alternatively, SUBCLASS may be
               * to match all subclasses.

           <b>dev</b>
               A device product id query.  DATA must be a valid 4-digit hexadecimal product id number, for
               example <b>0a1b</b>. It requires a <b>vnd</b> filter in the query.

           <b>vnd</b>
               A device vendor id query.  DATA must be a valid 4-digit hexadecimal vendor id number greater than
               zero, for example <b>0fab</b>.

           It is possible to compose multiple device queries together with the + sign, for example
           <b>--usb=vnd:0123+dev:4567</b>. The dev filter requires a vnd. Available since 1.15.11.

       <b>--nousb=VENDOR_ID:PRODUCT_ID</b>
           Adds a blocking USB device query to the application metadata. Blocked devices take precedence over
           allowed devices. The syntax is exactly equal to <b>--usb</b>. Available since 1.15.11.

       <b>--env=VAR=VALUE</b>
           Set an environment variable in the application. This overrides to the Context section from the
           application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--unset-env=VAR</b>
           Unset an environment variable in the application. This overrides the unset-environment entry in the
           [Context] group of the metadata, and the [Environment] group. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--env-fd=</b><u>FD</u>
           Read environment variables from the file descriptor <u>FD</u>, and set them as if via <b>--env</b>. This can be
           used to avoid environment variables and their values becoming visible to other users.

           Each environment variable is in the form <u>VAR</u>=<u>VALUE</u> followed by a zero byte. This is the same format
           used by env -0 and <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>*/environ.

       <b>--own-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to own the well known name NAME on the session bus. If NAME ends with .*, it
           allows the application to own all matching names. This overrides to the Context section from the
           application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--talk-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to talk to the well known name NAME on the session bus. If NAME ends with .*,
           it allows the application to talk to all matching names. This overrides to the Context section from
           the application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--no-talk-name=NAME</b>
           Don't allow the application to talk to the well known name NAME on the session bus. If NAME ends with
           .*, it allows the application to talk to all matching names. This overrides to the Context section
           from the application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--system-own-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to own the well known name NAME on the system bus. If NAME ends with .*, it
           allows the application to own all matching names. This overrides to the Context section from the
           application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--system-talk-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to talk to the well known name NAME on the system bus. If NAME ends with .*, it
           allows the application to talk to all matching names. This overrides to the Context section from the
           application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--system-no-talk-name=NAME</b>
           Don't allow the application to talk to the well known name NAME on the system bus. If NAME ends with
           .*, it allows the application to talk to all matching names. This overrides to the Context section
           from the application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--a11y-own-name=NAME</b>
           Allow the application to own the well known name NAME on the a11y bus. If NAME ends with .*, it
           allows the application to own all matching names. This overrides to the Context section from the
           application metadata. This option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--persist=FILENAME</b>
           If the application doesn't have access to the real homedir, make the (homedir-relative) path FILENAME
           a bind mount to the corresponding path in the per-application directory, allowing that location to be
           used for persistent data. This overrides to the Context section from the application metadata. This
           option can be used multiple times.

       <b>--no-session-bus</b>
           Run this instance without the filtered access to the session dbus connection. Note, this is the
           default when run with --sandbox.

       <b>--session-bus</b>
           Allow filtered access to the session dbus connection. This is the default, except when run with
           --sandbox.

           In sandbox mode, even if you allow access to the session bus the sandbox cannot talk to or own the
           application ids (org.the.App.*) on the bus (unless explicitly added), only names in the .Sandboxed
           subset (org.the.App.Sandboxed.* and org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.org.the.App.Sandboxed.*).

       <b>--no-a11y-bus</b>
           Run this instance without the access to the accessibility bus. Note, this is the default when run
           with --sandbox.

       <b>--a11y-bus</b>
           Allow access to the accessibility bus. This is the default, except when run with --sandbox.

       <b>--sandbox</b>
           Run the application in sandboxed mode, which means dropping all the extra permissions it would
           otherwise have, as well as access to the session/system/a11y busses and document portal.

       <b>--log-session-bus</b>
           Log session bus traffic. This can be useful to see what access you need to allow in your D-Bus
           policy.

       <b>--log-system-bus</b>
           Log system bus traffic. This can be useful to see what access you need to allow in your D-Bus policy.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--die-with-parent</b>
           Kill the entire sandbox when the launching process dies.

       <b>--parent-pid=PID</b>
           Specifies the pid of the "parent" flatpak, used by --parent-expose-pids and --parent-share-pids.

       <b>--parent-expose-pids</b>
           Make the processes of the new sandbox visible in the sandbox of the parent flatpak, as defined by
           --parent-pid.

       <b>--parent-share-pids</b>
           Use the same process ID namespace for the processes of the new sandbox and the sandbox of the parent
           flatpak, as defined by --parent-pid. Implies --parent-expose-pids.

       <b>--instance-id-fd</b>
           Write the instance ID string to the given file descriptor.

       <b>--file-forwarding</b>
           If this option is specified, the remaining arguments are scanned, and all arguments that are enclosed
           between a pair of '@@' arguments are interpreted as file paths, exported in the document store, and
           passed to the command in the form of the resulting document path. Arguments between "@@u" and "@@"
           are considered URIs, and any "file:" URIs are exported. The exports are non-persistent and with read
           and write permissions for the application.

       <b>--app-path=</b><u>PATH</u>
           Instead of mounting the app's content on <a href="file:/app">/app</a> in the sandbox, mount <u>PATH</u> on <a href="file:/app">/app</a>, and the app's
           content on /run/parent/app. If the app has extensions, they will also be redirected into
           /run/parent/app, and will not be included in the <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b> inside the sandbox.

       <b>--app-path=</b>
           As a special case, <b>--app-path=</b> (with an empty <u>PATH</u>) results in an empty directory being mounted on
           /app.

       <b>--usr-path=</b><u>PATH</u>
           Instead of mounting the runtime's files on <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> in the sandbox, mount <u>PATH</u> on <a href="file:/usr">/usr</a>, and the runtime's
           normal files on /run/parent/usr. If the runtime has extensions, they will also be redirected into
           /run/parent/usr, and will not be included in the <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b> inside the sandbox.

           This option will usually only be useful if it is combined with <b>--app-path=</b> and
