</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       editres - a dynamic resource editor for X Toolkit applications

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <b>editres</b> [ <u>-toolkitoption</u> ... ] [<b>-help</b>] [<b>-version</b>]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Editres</u>  accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options (see <u><a href="../man7/X.7.html">X</a>(7)</u>).  The order of the command
       line options is not important.

       <u>Editres</u> also accepts the following additional options:

       <b>-help</b>       Prints a usage message and exits.

       <b>-version</b>    Prints version info and exits.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Editres is a tool that allows users and application developers to view the full widget hierarchy of any X
       Toolkit application that speaks the Editres protocol.  In addition, editres will help the user  construct
       resource  specifications,  allow  the  user to apply the resource to the application and view the results
       dynamically.  Once the user is happy with a resource  specification  editres  will  append  the  resource
       string to the user's X Resources file.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>EDITRES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Editres</u> provides a window consisting of the following four areas:

       Menu Bar                 A set of popup menus that allow you full access to editres's features.

       Panner                   The panner allows a more intuitive way to scroll the application tree display.

       Message Area             Displays information to the user about the action that editres expects of her.

       Application Widget Tree  This area will be used to display the selected application's widget tree.

       To begin an editres session select the <b>Get</b> <b>Widget</b> <b>Tree</b> menu item from the command menu.  This will change
       the  pointer cursor to cross hair.  You should now select the application you wish look at by clicking on
       any of its windows.  If this application understands the editres protocol then editres will  display  the
       application's  widget  tree  in  its  tree  window.   If  the application does not understand the editres
       protocol editres will inform you of this fact in the message area after a few seconds delay.

       Once you have a widget tree you may now select any of the other menu options. The effect of each of these
       is described below.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Get Widget Tree
               Allows the user to click on any application that speaks the  editres  protocol  and  receive  its
               widget tree.

       Refresh Current Widget Tree
               Editres  only  knows  about the widgets that exist at the present time.  Many applications create
               and destroy widgets on the fly.   Selecting  this  menu  item  will  cause  editres  to  ask  the
               application  to  resend  its  widget  tree, thus updating its information to the new state of the
               application.

               For example, xman only creates the widgets for its <u>topbox</u> when it starts up.  None of the widgets
               for the manual page window are created until the user actually clicks on the <u>Manual</u> <u>Page</u>  button.
               If you retrieved xman's widget tree before the the manual page is active, you may wish to refresh
               the  widget  tree after the manual page has been displayed.  This will allow you to also edit the
               manual page's resources.

       Dump Widget Tree to a File
               For documenting applications it is often useful to be able to dump the entire application  widget
               tree  to  an ASCII file.  This file can then be included in the manual page.  When this menu item
               is selected a popup dialog is activated.  Type the name of the file in this  dialog,  and  either
               select  <u>okay</u>, or type a carriage-return.  Editres will now dump the widget tree to this file.  To
               cancel the file dialog, select the <u>cancel</u> button.

       Show Resource Box
               This command will popup a resource box for the current application.  This resource box (described
               in detail below) will allow the user to see exactly which resources can be  set  for  the  widget
               that  is  currently  selected  in  the  widget  tree  display.   Only one widget may be currently
               selected; if greater or fewer are selected editres will refuse to pop up the resource box and put
               an error message in the <b>Message</b> <b>Area</b>.

       Set Resource
               This command will popup a simple dialog box for setting an arbitrary  resource  on  all  selected
               widgets.   You  must type in the resource name, as well as the value.  You can use the Tab key to
               switch between the resource name field the resource value field.

       Quit    Exits editres.

</pre><h4><b>TREE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>Tree</b> menu contains several commands that allow operations to be performed on the widget tree.

       Select Widget in Client
              This menu item allows you to select any widget in the application; editres will then highlight the
              corresponding element the widget tree display.  Once this menu item is selected the pointer cursor
              will again turn to a crosshair, and you must click any pointer button in the widget  you  wish  to
              have  displayed.   Since  some widgets are fully obscured by their children, it is not possible to
              get to every widget this way, but this mechanism  does  give  very  useful  feedback  between  the
              elements in the widget tree and those in the actual application.

       Select All

       Unselect All

       Invert All
              These functions allow the user to select, unselect, or invert all widgets in the widget tree.

       Select Children

       Select Parents
              These functions select the immediate parent or children of each of the currently selected widgets.

       Select Descendants

       Select Ancestors
              These functions select all parents or children of each of the currently selected widgets.  This is
              a recursive search.

       Show Widget Names

       Show Class Names

       Show Widget IDs

       Show Widget Windows
              When  the  tree  widget is initially displayed the labels of each widget in the tree correspond to
              the widget names.  These functions will cause the label of <b>all</b> widgets in the tree to  be  changed
              to show the class name, IDs, or window associated with each widget in the application.  The widget
              IDs, and windows are shown as hex numbers.

       In  addition there are keyboard accelerators for each of the Tree operations.  If the input focus is over
       an individual widget in the tree, then that operation will only effect that widget.  If the  input  focus
       is in the Tree background it will have exactly the same effect as the corresponding menu item.

       The translation entries shown may be applied to any widget in the application.  If that widget is a child
       of  the  Tree widget, then it will only affect that widget, otherwise it will have the same effect as the
       commands in the tree menu.

       Flash Active Widgets
              This command is the inverse of the <b>Select</b> <b>Widget</b> <b>in</b> <b>Client</b> command, it will  show  the  user  each
              widget  that is currently selected in the widget tree, by flashing the corresponding widget in the
              application <u>numFlashes</u> (three by default) times in the <u>flashColor</u>.

              <b>Key</b>     <b>Option</b>                     <b>Translation</b> <b>Entry</b>
              -
              space   Unselect                   Select(nothing)
              w       Select                     Select(widget)
              s       Select                     Select(all)
              i       Invert                     Select(invert)
              c       Select Children            Select(children)
              d       Select Descendants         Select(descendants)
              p       Select Parent              Select(parent)
              a       Select Ancestors           Select(ancestors)
              N       Show Widget Names          Relabel(name)
              C       Show Class Names           Relabel(class)
              I       Show Widget IDs            Relabel(id)
              W       Show Widget Windows        Relabel(window)
              T       Toggle Widget/Class Name   Relabel(toggle)

              Clicking button 1 on a widget adds it to the set of selected widgets.   Clicking  button  2  on  a
              widget  deselects  all  other  widgets  and then selects just that widget.  Clicking button 3 on a
              widget toggles its label between the widget's instance name the widget's class name.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>RESOURCE</b> <b>BOX</b></h4><pre>
       The resource box contains five different areas.  Each of the areas, as they appear on  the  screen,  from
       top to bottom will be discussed.

       The Resource Line
              This  area  at  the  top  of  the resource box shows the current resource name exactly as it would
              appear if you were to save it to a file or apply it.

       The Widget Names and Classes
              This area allows you to select exactly which widgets  this  resource  will  apply  to.   The  area
              contains four lines, the first contains the name of the selected widget and all its ancestors, and
              the more restrictive dot (<b>.</b>) separator.  The second line contains less specific the Class names of
              each  widget,  and well as the less restrictive star (<b>*</b>) separator.  The third line contains a set
              of special buttons called <b>Any</b> <b>Widget</b> which will generalize this level to match  any  widget.   The
              last  line  contains  a  set of special buttons called <b>Any</b> <b>Widget</b> <b>Chain</b> which will turn the single
              level into something that matches zero or more levels.

              The initial state of this area is the most restrictive, using  the  resource  names  and  the  dot
              separator.   By  selecting  the  other buttons in this area you can ease the restrictions to allow
              more and more widgets to match the specification.  The extreme case  is  to  select  all  the  <b>Any</b>
              <b>Widget</b>  <b>Chain</b> buttons, which will match every widget in the application.   As you select different
              buttons the tree display will update to show you exactly which widgets will  be  effected  by  the
              current resource specification.

       Normal and Constraint Resources
              The next area allows you to select the name of the normal or constraint resources you wish to set.
              Some widgets may not have constraint resources, so that area will not appear.

       Resource Value
              This  next  area  allows you to enter the resource value.  This value should be entered exactly as
              you would type a line into your resource file.  Thus it should  contain  no  unescaped  new-lines.
              There are a few special character sequences for this file:

              \n - This will be replaced with a newline.

              \###  -  Where  # is any octal digit.  This will be replaced with a single byte that contains this
              sequence interpreted as an octal number.  For example, a value  containing  a  NULL  byte  can  be
              stored by specifying \000.

              \&lt;new-line&gt; - This will compress to nothing.

              \\ - This will compress to a single backslash.

       Command Area
              This area contains several command buttons, described in this section.

       Set Save File
              This  button allows the user to modify file that the resources will be saved to.  This button will
              bring up a dialog box that will ask you for a filename; once the filename has been entered, either
              hit carriage-return or click on the <u>okay</u> button.  To pop down the dialog box without changing  the
              save file, click the <u>cancel</u> button.

       Save   This button will append the <b>resource</b> <b>line</b> described above to the end of the current save file.  If
              no  save file has been set the <b>Set</b> <b>Save</b> <b>File</b> dialog box will be popped up to prompt the user for a
              filename.

       Apply  This button attempts to perform a XtSetValues call on all widgets that  match  the  <b>resource</b>  <b>line</b>
              described  above.  The value specified is applied directly to all matching widgets.  This behavior
              is an attempt to give a dynamic feel to the resource editor.  Since this feature allows  users  to
              put  an  application  in states it may not be willing to handle, a hook has been provided to allow
              specific applications to block these SetValues requests (see <b>Blocking</b> <b>Editres</b> <b>Requests</b> below).

              Unfortunately due to design constraints imposed on the widgets by the X Toolkit and  the  Resource
              Manager,  trying  to  coerce  an  inherently static system into dynamic behavior can cause strange
              results.  There is no guarantee that the results of an apply will be the same as what will  happen
              when  you  save  the  value and restart the application.  This functionality is provided to try to
              give you a rough feel for what your changes will accomplish, and the results  obtained  should  be
              considered suspect at best.  Having said that, this is one of the neatest features of editres, and
              I strongly suggest that you play with it, and see what it can do.

       Save and Apply
              This button combines the Save and Apply actions described above into one button.

       Popdown Resource Box
              This button will remove the resource box from the display.

</pre><h4><b>BLOCKING</b> <b>EDITRES</b> <b>REQUESTS</b></h4><pre>
       The  editres  protocol  has been built into the Athena Widget set.  This allows all applications that are
       linked against Xaw to be able to speak to the resource editor.  While this  provides  great  flexibility,
       and is a useful tool, it can quite easily be abused.  It is therefore possible for any Xaw application to
       specify a value for the <b>editresBlock</b> resource described below, to keep editres from divulging information
       about its internals, or to disable the <b>SetValues</b> part of the protocol.

       <b>editresBlock</b> <b>(</b>Class <b>EditresBlock)</b>
               Specifies which type of blocking this application wishes to impose on the editres protocol.

       The accepted values are:

       all            Block all requests.

       setValues      Block  all SetValues requests.  As this is the only editres request that actually modifies
                      the application, this is in effect stating that the application is read-only.

       none           Allow all editres requests.

       Remember that these resources are set on  any  Xaw  application,  <b>not</b>  <b>editres</b>.   They  allow  individual
       applications  to keep all or some of the requests editres makes from ever succeeding.  Of course, editres
       is also an Xaw application, so it may also be viewed and modified by editres (rather recursive, I  know),
       these commands can be blocked by setting the <b>editresBlock</b> resource on editres itself.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCES</b></h4><pre>
       For <u>editres</u> the available application resources are:

       <b>numFlashes</b> <b>(</b>Class <b>NumFlashes)</b>
               Specifies the number of times the widgets in the application will be flashed when the <b>Show</b> <b>Active</b>
               <b>Widgets</b> command in invoked.

       <b>flashTime</b> <b>(</b>Class <b>FlashTime)</b>
               Amount of time between the flashes described above.

       <b>flashColor</b> <b>(</b>Class <b>flashColor)</b>
               Specifies  the  color used to flash application widgets.  A bright color should be used that will
               immediately draw your attention to the area being flashed, such as red or yellow.

       <b>saveResourcesFile</b> <b>(</b>Class <b>SaveResourcesFile)</b>
               This is the file the resource line will be append to  when  the  <b>Save</b>  button  activated  in  the
               resource box.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGETS</b></h4><pre>
       In  order  to specify resources, it is useful to know the hierarchy of the widgets which compose <u>editres</u>.
       In the notation below, indentation indicates hierarchical structure.  The  widget  class  name  is  given
       first, followed by the widget instance name.
