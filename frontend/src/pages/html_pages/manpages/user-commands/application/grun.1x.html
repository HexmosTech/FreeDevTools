</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gRun - X/GTK based application launcher.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gRun</b> [<u>filename</u>] [-v] [--version] [-h] [--help]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gRun</b> launches applications in X Windows without the need for an <b>xterm</b> session at all. <b>gRun</b> provides three
       methods  of  launching applications, entering the command directly into the text field, browsing the tree
       for the application and running an application specified on the command line. In  all  cases  <b>gRun</b>  exits
       completely  after  launching the application and the application is left running as a full child of the X
       process, as if it were launched from a WM menu. If <b>gRun</b> is launched from an <b>xterm</b>  or  shell,  the  shell
       will  be  freed  for  further  use  after  <b>gRun</b>  exits.  No more wasting an <b>xterm</b> for the duration of the
       application.

       <b>gRun</b> will attempt to complete a command automatically from the history  as  it  is  typed  in,  hopefully
       saving  some  time. Pressing the Tab key will try to find an executable file in the path that starts with
       the characters already entered into the entry box.

       <b>gRun</b> also includes a facility for checking if the command is in a list of console mode apps,  eg  <b>telnet</b>.
       If it finds the command in the file, <b>gRun</b> launches a <b>xterm</b> with the command as the <b>-e</b> parameter.

       <b>gRun</b>  now  has a facility for associating file extensions with a command, ala Windows. If an extension is
       found, the associated application is launched with the command entry as the parameter.

   <b>Options</b>
       <u>filename</u>
              Application name for command line launching from a <b>xterm</b>. The filename must  exist  within  either
              the  default path or have a fully qualified path. Any options passed after the filename are passed
              down to the application if not removed by gtk_init()

       <b>--persist</b>
              <b>gRun</b> dialog does not close after launching application

       <b>--notips</b>
              Tooltips are not displayed

       <b>--version</b>
              Display the current version number of <b>grun</b>.

       <b>--help</b> Display a short usage guide.

       <b>gRun</b> also recognizes all standard X Windows and GTK options, eg <b>-display</b> and <b>-geometry</b>.
