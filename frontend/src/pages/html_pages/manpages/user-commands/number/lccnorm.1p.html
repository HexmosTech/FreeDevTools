       lccnorm - normalize Library of Congress Classification call numbers

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lccnorm</b> [<u>option</u>...] [<u>file</u>...]

       <b>lccnorm</b> <b>-h</b>|<b>--help</b>

       <b>lccnorm</b> <b>-V</b>|<b>--version</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lccnorm</b> transforms LC-style call numbers into a form that may be used in a straight ASCII sort.

       By default, each line of input is assumed to consist of a number of tab-delimited fields, of which the
       first contains an LC-style call number or class.

       If no file is specified, or if the file name "-" is specified, standard input will be processed.

       Normalization of call number ranges is a special challenge, because ranges are not normally specified
       using the exact endpoint.  Consider the range "B708-B713"; while "B708" does indicate the beginning point
       -- a no call number that comes before B 708 can fall within the range -- the end point is only a guide,
       not a strict limit, since the intent is that call numbers such as "B 713 .H94" and "B 713 .W55 L86" <b>do</b>
       fall within the range.  Unfortunately, ranges are often specified ambiguously; for example, the call
       number "B 713.14 G92" might or might not be considered to fall within this range.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b>, <b>--delimiter</b> <u>string</u>
           Specify  a  string  other  than  a  single tab (ASCII character 9) to delimit the fields in a line of
           input.  This also provides the default for joining fields in the output; see option <b>-j</b> below.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--field</b> <u>range</u>
           The call number (or range) is found in the given range of fields.   Fields  are  1-based  (the  first
           field  is field 1, not field 0) and are separated by a single tab character (unless option <b>-d</b> is used
           to specify an alternate delimiter).

           When parsing call numbers (not ranges), all fields are concatenated using a single space to form  the
           call number that will be normalized.

           When parsing ranges, there are four possibilities:

           1 field
               The field contains a range in the form <u>prefix</u> (e.g., "J80"), <u>closed</u> <u>range</u> (e.g., "ML566-566.6" or
               "ML566-ML566.6") or <u>half-open</u> <u>range</u> (e.g., "KME451&lt;KME500").

           2 fields
               The first field is the beginning of the (closed) range, and the second is the end.

           3 fields
               The first field is a prefix common to both the beginning and end of the range, and the second and
               third fields are the remainders.

           4 fields
               The first and third fields together are the beginning of the range, and the second and fourth are
               the end.

           For example, the following all produce identical output:

               $ echo 'PL4501-4509'     | lccnorm -d: -f1
               $ echo 'PL4501:PL4509'   | lccnorm -d: -f1-2
               $ echo 'PL:4501:4509'    | lccnorm -d: -f1-3
               $ echo 'PL:4501:PL:4509' | lccnorm -d: -f1-4

       <b>-j</b>, <b>--join</b> <u>string</u>
           Specify  a  character  to  use  when joining fields for output. The default is to use the same string
           specified in option <b>-d</b>, or a single tab if <b>-d</b> was not given.

       <b>-c</b>  Don't delete the input fields from which call numbers (or ranges) were obtained.  Either the  <b>-b</b>  and
           <b>-e</b> option must be provided to specify where the normalized string is to be placed.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--begin</b>
           Place normalized strings at the beginning of output lines.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--end</b>
           Place normalized strings at the end of output lines.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--die-on-error</b>
           Exit  with  a  non-zero  status as soon as an unnormalizable input is encountered.  The default is to
           issue a warning and normalize to the empty string.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
           Be verbose.  This currently has no effect unless used with the <b>-V</b> or <b>--version</b> option.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print help information and exit.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
           Print the version number and exit.  If the <b>-v</b> or <b>--verbose</b> option is specified, print out  additional
           information.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--manual</b>
           View the manual page for <b>lccnorm</b>.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--license</b>
