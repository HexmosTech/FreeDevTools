</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bibdoiadd.pl - add DOI numbers to papers in a given bib file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       bibdoiadd [<b>-c</b> <u>config_file</u>] [<b>-C</b> 1|0] [<b>-e</b> 1|0] [<b>-f</b>] [<b>-o</b> <u>output</u>] <u>bib_file</u>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b> <u>config_file</u>
           Configuration file.  If this file is absent, some defaults are used.  See below for its format.

       <b>-C</b> 1|0
           Whether to canonicalize names in the output (1) or not (0).  By default, 1.

       <b>-e</b>  If 1 (default), add empty doi if a doi cannot be found.  This prevents repeated searches for the same
           entries if you add new entries to the file.  Calling "-e 0" suppresses this behavior.

       <b>-f</b>  Force checking doi number even if one is present

       <b>-o</b> <u>output</u>
           Output  file.  If this option is not used, the name for the output file is formed by adding "_doi" to
           the input file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The script reads a BibTeX file.  It checks whether the entries have DOIs.  If not, it  tries  to  contact
       <a href="http://www.crossref.org">http://www.crossref.org</a>  to  get  the  corresponding  DOI.   The  result is a BibTeX file with the fields
       "doi=..." added.

       The name of the output file is either set by the <b>-o</b> option or is derived by adding the suffix  "_doi"  to
       the output file.

       Every  BibTeX record in the input is parsed, using BibTeX::Parser, but only the ones that do not have the
       "doi" field (or "mrnumber" or "zblnumber" for the sibling scripts) are processed. These  entries  without
       the requested field are written back, as described in BibTeX::Parser::Entry.

       The  bib  records that are not processed (because they already have the requested field) are written back
       as-is, without any reformatting.

       There are (were?) two options for making queries with Crossref: free account and paid membership. In  the
       first  case  you  still must register with Crossref and are limited to a small number of queries, see the
       agreement at "<a href="http://www.crossref.org/01company/free_services_agreement.html">http://www.crossref.org/01company/free_services_agreement.html</a>". In  the  second  case  you
       have  a  username  and password, and can use them for automatic queries. I am not sure whether the use of
       this script is allowed for the free account holders. At any rate, if you want to  add  DOIs  to  a  large
       number of entries, you should register as a paid member.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration  file relates to the Crossref queries, and is mostly self-explanatory: it has comments
       (starting with "#") and assginments in the form

          $field = value ;

       The important parameters are $mode ('free' or 'paid'), $email (for free users) and $username &amp;  $password
       for paid members.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
          bibdoiadd -c bibdoiadd.cfg -o - citations.bib &gt; result.bib
          bibdoiadd -c bibdoiadd.cfg -o result.bib citations.bib
