</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ascii2binary - Convert ASCII numbers to binary

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ascii2binary</b> <b>[flags]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>ascii2binary</u>  reads input consisting of a sequence of ASCII textual representations of numbers, separated
       by whitespace, and produces as output  the  binary  equivalents.   The  type  (unsigned  integer,  signed
       integer,  or  floating  point  number) and size of the binary output is selected by means of command line
       flags. The default is unsigned character.  Input is checked both for format errors and to ensure that the
       number requested can be represented in a number of the requested binary type and size.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The input formats supported are exactly those supported by  <u><a href="../man3/strtod.3.html">strtod</a>(3)</u>  for  floating  point  numbers,  by
       <u><a href="../man3/strtoll.3.html">strtoll</a>(3)</u>  for  signed integers, and by <u><a href="../man3/strtoull.3.html">strtoull</a>(3)</u> for unsigned integers, except that, unlike <u><a href="../man3/strtod.3.html">strtod</a>(3)</u>
       floating point numbers may have thousands separators.   This  means  that  by  default  integers  may  be
       decimal, octal, or hexadecimal, determined by the usual conventions. The command line flag <u>-b</u> may be used
       to specify another base for integer conversions.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       Long options may not be available on some systems.

       -b,--base &lt;base&gt;
              set base in range [2,36] for integer conversions. The base may be either an integer or:

              (b)binary

              (o)octal

              (d)ecimal

              (h)exadecimal.

       -h,--help
              print help message

       -L,locale &lt;locale&gt;
              Set the LC_NUMERIC facet of the locale to &lt;locale&gt;.

       -s,--sizes
              print sizes of types on current machine and related information

       -t,--type &lt;type&gt;
              set type and size of output

              The  following  are  the  possible output types. Note that some types may not be available on some
              machines.

              d  double

              f  float

              sc signed char

              ss signed short

              si signed int

              sl signed long

              sq signed long long

              uc unsigned char

              us unsigned short

              ui unsigned int

              ul unsigned long

              uq unsigned long long

       -v,--version
              identify version

       -X,--explain-exit-codes
              print a summary of the exit status codes.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following values are returned on exit:

       0 SUCCESS
              The input was successfully converted.

       1 INFO The user requested information such as the version number or usage  synopsis  and  this  has  been
              provided.

       2 SYSTEM ERROR
              An  error  resulted  from  a  failure of the operating system such as an i/o error or inability to
              allocate storage.

       3 COMMAND LINE ERROR
              The program was called with invalid or inconsistent command line flags.

       4 RANGE ERROR
              This means that the input may be well-formed but cannot be represented as the required  type.  For
              example,  if  the  input  is  the string 983 and ascii2binary is requested to convert this into an
              unsigned byte, ascii2binary will exit with a RANGE ERROR because 983  exceeds  the  maximum  value
              representable in an unsigned byte, which is 255.

       5 INPUT ERROR
              This  means that the input was ill-formed, that is that it could not be interpreted as a number of
              the required type. For example, if the input is 0x2A and a decimal value is called for,  an  INPUT
              ERROR will be returned since 0x2A is not a valid representation of a decimal integer.
