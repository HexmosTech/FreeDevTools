</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       most - browse or page through a text file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>most</b>  [  <b>-1</b>  ]  [  <b>-b</b>  ]  [  <b>-C</b> ] [ <b>-c</b> ] [ <b>-d</b> ] [ <b>-M</b> ] [ <b>-r</b> ] [ <b>-s</b> ] [ <b>-t</b> ] [ <b>-u</b> ] [ <b>-v</b> ] [ <b>-w</b> ] [ <b>-z</b> ] [
       <b>+/</b><u>string</u> ] [ <b>+</b><u>line-number</u> ] [ <b>+d</b> ] [ <b>+s</b> ] [ <b>+u</b> ] [ <u>file...</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>most</b> is a paging program that displays, one windowful at a time, the contents of a file  on  a  terminal.
       It  pauses  after  each  windowful and prints on the window status line the screen the file name, current
       line number, and the percentage of the file so far displayed.

       Unlike other paging programs, <b>most</b> is capable of displaying an arbitrary number of  windows  as  long  as
       each  window  occupies  at  least two screen lines.  Each window may contain the same file or a different
       file.  In addition, each window has its own mode.  For example, one window may display a  file  with  its
       lines  wrapped  while  another may be truncating the lines. Windows may be `locked' together in the sense
       that if one of the locked windows scrolls, all locked windows will  scroll.   <b>most</b>  is  also  capable  of
       ignoring  lines  that  are  indented beyond a user specified value.  This is useful when viewing computer
       programs to pick out gross features of the code.  See the `:o' command for a description of this feature.

       In addition to displaying ordinary text files, <b>most</b> can also display binary files as well as  files  with
       arbitrary  ascii  characters.  When a file is read into a buffer, <b>most</b> examines the first 32 bytes of the
       file to determine if the file is a binary file and then switches to the appropriate mode.  However,  this
       feature  may  be  disabled with the -k option.  See the description of the -b, -k, -v, and -t options for
       further details.

       Text files may contain combinations of underscore and backspace characters causing a printer to underline
       or overstrike.  When <b>most</b> recognizes this, it inserts the appropriate escape  sequences  to  achieve  the
       desired  effect.   In  addition,  some files cause the printer to overstrike some characters by embedding
       carriage return characters in the middle of a line.  When  this  occurs,  <b>most</b>  displays  the  overstruck
       character  with  a  bold attribute.  This feature facilitates the reading of UNIX man pages or a document
       produced by runoff.  In particular, viewing this document  with  <b>most</b>  should  illustrate  this  behavior
       provided  that  the  underline  characters  have  not  been stripped.  This may be turned off with the -v
       option.

       By default, lines with more characters than the terminal width are not wrapped but are instead truncated.
       When truncation occurs, this is indicated by a `$' in the far right column of the terminal  screen.   The
       RIGHT  and LEFT arrow keys may be used to view lines which extend past the margins of the screen.  The -w
       option may be used to override this feature.  When a window is wrapped, the character `\' will appear  at
       the right edge of the window.

       Commands are listed below.

</pre><h4><b>COLOR</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>most</b>  has  supported  both 256-color and 24 bit truecolor terminals since version 5.2.  Not all terminals
       are capable of generating arbitrary 24 bit colors. If your terminal supports 24 bit colors, but <b>most</b> does
       not detect it, then set the environment variable

            COLORTERM=truecolor

       to force 24 bit truecolors to be used.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-1</b>     VT100 mode.  This is meaningful only on VMS systems.  This option should be used if  the  terminal
              is  strictly  a  VT100.   This  implies  that the terminal does not have the ability to delete and
              insert multiple lines.  VT102s and above have this ability.

       <b>-b</b>     Binary mode.  Use this switch when you want to view files containing 8 bit characters.  <b>most</b>  will
              display the file 16 bytes per line in hexadecimal notation. A typical line looks like:

                 01000000 40001575 9C23A020 4000168D     ....@..u.#. @...

              When used with the -v option, the same line looks like:

                 ^A^@^@^@  @^@^U u 9C #A0    @^@^V8D     ....@..u.#. @...

       <b>-C</b>     Disable color support.

       <b>-c</b>     Make searches case-sensitive

       <b>-d</b>     Omit the backslash mark used to denote a wrapped line.

       <b>-M</b>     Disable the use of mmap.

       <b>-r</b>     Default to using regexp searches

       <b>-s</b>     Squeeze-mode.  Replace multiple blank lines with a single blank line.

       <b>-t</b>     Display  tabs  as  ^I.  If this option is immediately followed by an integer, the integer sets the
              tab width, e.g., -t4

       <b>-u</b>     Disable UTF-8 mode even if the locale dictates it

       <b>+u</b>     Force UTF-8 mode.  By default <b>most</b> will use the current locale to determine if UTF-8  mode  should
              be used.  The +u and -u switches allow the behavior to be overridden

       <b>-v</b>     Display  control  characters  as  in `^A' for control A.  Normally <b>most</b> does not interpret control
              characters.

       <b>-w</b>     Wrap lines

       <b>-z</b>     Disable gunzip-on-the-fly

       <b>+/</b><u>string</u>
              Start up at the line containing the first occurrence of string

       <b>+</b><u>lineno</u>
              Start up at the specified line-number

       <b>+d</b>     This switch should only be used if you want the option to delete a file while  viewing  it.   This
              makes  it  easier  to  clean  unwanted  files  out  of  a  directory. The file is deleted with the
              interactive key sequence `:D' and then confirming with `y'.

       <b>+s</b>     Secure Mode-- no edit, cd, shell, and reading files not already listed on the command line.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The commands take effect immediately; it is not necessary to type a carriage return.   In  the  following
       commands, <b>i</b> is a numerical argument (1 by default).

       <b>SPACE,</b> <b>CTRL-D,</b> <b>NEXT_SCREEN</b>
              Display another windowful, or jump <b>i</b> windowfuls if <b>i</b> is specified.

       <b>RETURN,</b> <b>DOWN_ARROW,</b> <b>V,</b> <b>CTRL-N</b>
              Display another line, or <b>i</b> more lines, if specified.

       <b>UP_ARROW,</b> <b>^,</b> <b>CTRL-P</b>
              Display previous line, or <b>i</b> previous lines, if specified.

       <b>T,</b> <b>ESCAPE&lt;</b>
              Move to top of buffer.

       <b>B,</b> <b>ESCAPE&gt;</b>
              Move to bottom of buffer.

       <b>RIGHT_ARROW,</b> <b>TAB,</b> <b>&gt;</b>
              Scroll window left 60<b>i</b> columns to view lines that are beyond the right margin of the window.

       <b>LEFT_ARROW,</b> <b>CTRL-B,</b> <b>&lt;</b>
              Scroll window right 60<b>i</b> columns to view lines that are beyond the left margin of the window.

       <b>U,</b> <b>CTRL-U,</b> <b>DELETE,</b> <b>PREV_SCREEN</b>
              Skip back <b>i</b> windowfuls and then print a windowful.

       <b>R,</b> <b>CTRL-R</b>
              Redraw the window.

       <b>J,</b> <b>G</b>   If   <b>i</b>   is   not   specified, then prompt for a line number then jump to that line otherwise just
              jump to line i.

       <b>%</b>      If <b>i</b> is not specified, then prompt for a percent number then jump to  that  percent  of  the  file
              otherwise just jump to <b>i</b> percent of the file.

       <b>W,</b> <b>w</b>   If   the   current   screen   width   is  80,  make it 132 and vice-versa.  For other values, this
              command is ignored.

       <b>Q,</b> <b>CTRL-X</b> <b>CTRL-C,</b> <b>CTRL-K</b> <b>E</b>
              Exit from <b>most</b>.  On VMS, ^Z also exits.

       <b>h,</b> <b>CTRL-H,</b> <b>HELP,</b> <b>PF2</b>
              Help.  Give a description of all the <b>most</b> commands.  The <b>most</b> environment variable MOST_HELP  must
              be set for this to be meaningful.

       <b>f,</b> <b>/,</b> <b>CTRL-F,</b> <b>FIND,</b> <b>GOLD</b> <b>PF3</b>
              Prompt   for  a  string  and search forward from the current line for ith distinct line containing
              the string.  CTRL-G aborts.

       <b>?</b>      Prompt for a string and search backward for the ith distinct line containing the  string.   CTRL-G
              aborts.

       <b>n</b>      Search for the next <b>i</b> lines containing an occurrence of the last search string in the direction of
              the previous search.

       <b>m,</b> <b>SELECT,</b> <b>CTRL-@,</b> <b>CTRL-K</b> <b>M,</b> <b>PERIOD</b>
              Set a mark on the current line for later reference.

       <b>INSERT_HERE,</b> <b>CTRL-X</b> <b>CTRL-X,</b> <b>COMMA,</b> <b>CTRL-K</b> <b>RETURN,</b> <b>GOLD</b> <b>PERIOD</b>
              Set  a  mark on the current line but return to previous mark.  This allows the user to toggle back
              and forth between two positions in the file.

       <b>l,</b> <b>L</b>   Toggle locking for this window.  The window is locked if there is a `*' at the left  edge  of  the
              status line.  Windows locked together, scroll together.

       <b>CTRL-X</b> <b>2,</b> <b>CTRL-W</b> <b>2,</b> <b>GOLD</b> <b>X</b>
              Split this window in half.

       <b>CTRL-X</b> <b>o,</b> <b>CTRL-W</b> <b>o,</b> <b>o,</b> <b>GOLDUP,</b> <b>GOLDDOWN</b>
              Move to other window.

       <b>CTRL-X</b> <b>0,</b> <b>CTRL-W</b> <b>0,</b> <b>GOLD</b> <b>V</b>
              Delete this window.

       <b>CTRL-X</b> <b>1,</b> <b>CTRL-W</b> <b>1,</b> <b>GOLD</b> <b>O</b>
              Delete all other windows, leaving only one window.

       <b>E,</b> <b>e</b>   Edit this file.

       <b>$,</b> <b>ESC</b> <b>$</b>
              This  is  system  dependent.  On VMS, this causes <b>most</b> to spawn a subprocess.  When the user exits
              the process, <b>most</b> is resumed.  On UNIX systems, <b>most</b> simply suspends itself.

       <b>:n</b>     Skip to the next filename given in the command line.  Use the arrow  keys  to  scroll  forward  or
              backward through the file list.  `Q' quits <b>most</b> and any other key selects the given file.

       <b>:c</b>     Toggle case sensitive search.

       <b>:D</b>     Delete current file.  This command is only meaningful with the +d switch.

       <b>:o,</b> <b>:O</b> Toggle various options.  With this key sequence, <b>most</b> displays a prompt asking the user to hit one
              of: bdtvw.  The `b', `t', `v', and `w' options have the same meaning as the command line switches.
              For example, the `w' option will toggle wrapping on and off for the current window.

              The `d' option must be used with a prefix integer i.  All lines indented beyond <b>i</b> columns will not
              be displayed.  For example, consider the fragment:

                 int main(int argc, char **argv)
                 {
                   int i;
                   for (i = 0; i &lt; argc, i++)
                     {
                       fprintf(stdout,"%i: %s\n",i,argv[i]);
                     }
                   return 0;
                 }
              The key sequence `1:od' will cause <b>most</b> to display the file ignoring all lines indented beyond the
              first column.  So for the example above, <b>most</b> would display:

                 int main(int argc, char **argv)...
                 }
              where the `...' indicates lines that follow are not displayed.

</pre><h4><b>HINTS</b></h4><pre>
       CTRL-G aborts the commands requiring the user to type something in at a prompt.  The back-quote key has a
       special  meaning  here.   It  is  used  to  quote certain characters.  This is useful when search for the
       occurrence of a string with a control character or a string at the beginning of a line.   In  the  latter
       case, to find the occurrence of `The' at the beginning of a line, enter `^JThe where ` quotes the CTRL-J.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>most</b> uses the following environment variables:

       <b>MOST_SWITCHES</b>
              This   variable   sets   commonly used switches.  For example, some people prefer to use <b>most</b> with
              the -s option so that excess blank lines are not displayed.  On VMS this is normally done done  in
              the login.com through the line:

                 $ define MOST_SWITCHES "-s"

       <b>MOST_EDITOR,</b> <b>SLANG_EDITOR</b>
              Either   of   these environment variables specify an editor for <b>most</b> to invoke to edit a file. The
              value can contain %s and %d formatting descriptors that represent the file name and  line  number,
              respectively.  For example, if JED is your editor, then set MOST_EDITOR to 'jed %s -g %d'.

       <b>MOST_HELP</b>
              This variable may be used to specify an alternate help file.

       <b>MOST_INITFILE</b>
              Set  this  variable to specify the initialization file to load during startup.  The default action
              is to load the system configuration file and then a personal configuration file called .mostrc  on
              Unix, and most.rc on other systems.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       When <b>most</b> starts up, it tries to read a system configuration file and then a personal configuration file.
       These files may be used to specify key-bindings and colors.

       To bind a key to a particular function use the syntax:

           setkey function-name key-sequence

       The  setkey command requires two arguments.  The function-name argument specifies the function that is to
       be executed as a response to the keys specified by the key-sequence argument are pressed.  For example,

           setkey   "up"     "^P"

       indicates that when Ctrl-P is pressed then the function up is to be executed.

       Sometimes, it is necessary to first unbind a key-sequence before rebinding it in order via  the  unsetkey
       function:

           unsetkey "^F"

       Colors  may  be  defined  through  the  use  of the color keyword in the the configuration file using the
       syntax:

           color OBJECT-NAME FOREGROUND-COLOR BACKGROUND-COLOR

       Here, OBJECT-NAME can be any one of the following items:

            status           -- the status line
            underline        -- underlined text
            overstrike       -- overstruck text
            normal           -- anything else

       See the sample configuration files for more information.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Almost all of the known bugs or limitations of <b>most</b> are due to a desire to  read  and  interpret  control
       characters  in  files.   One problem concerns the use of backspace characters to underscore or overstrike
       other characters.  <b>most</b> makes an attempt to use terminal escape sequences to simulate this behavior.  One
       side effect is the one does not always get what one expects when scrolling right and left through a file.
       When in doubt, use the -v and -b options of <b>most</b>.

       The regular-expression searches may fail to find  strings  that  involve  backspace/underscore  used  for
       highlighting.  The regular-expression syntax is described in the S-Lang Library documentation.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Over  the years, many people have contributed to <b>most</b> in one way or another, e.g., via code patches, bug-
       fixes, comments, or criticisms.  I am particularly grateful to the very early adopters of the program who
       took a chance with a fledgling software project headed  by  someone  learning  the  underlying  language.
       These include:

       Mats  Akerberg,  Henk  D.  Davids,  Rex  O.  Livingston,  and Mark Pizzolato contributed to the early VMS
       versions of <b>most</b>.  In particular, Mark worked on it to get it ready for DECUS.

       Foteos Macrides adapted <b>most</b> for use in cswing and gopher.  A few features of the present version of <b>most</b>
       was inspired from his work.

       I am grateful to Robert Mills for re-writing the search routines to use regular expressions.

       Sven Oliver Moll came up with the idea of automatic detection of zipped files.

       I would also like to thank Shinichi Hama for his valuable criticisms of <b>most</b>.

       Javier Kohen was instrumental in the support for UTF-8.

       Thanks to David W. Sanderson for adapting the early documentation to nroff man page source format.

                                                  30 July 2022                                           <u><a href="../man1/MOST.1.html">MOST</a></u>(1)
