</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bg-installer - Standardized installer program.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>bg-installer</b> [<u>top-directory</u>] <u>&lt;LIST</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  program  <b>bg-installer</b>  reads  an installation instruction file from standard input, and executes the
       instructions in the directory named on the command line.

       Each line in the file is an individual instruction.   Blank  lines  and  lines  beginning  with  "#"  are
       ignored.   Lines  beginning with "&gt;", if present, instruct bg-installer as to which base directory to use
       (see below).  All other lines must have following format:

              CMD:[OWNER]:[GROUP]:MODE:DIR[:FILENAME[:SOURCE]]

       <u>CMD</u>    is a single character specifying the installation command, optionally followed by  "?"  indicating
              the  command  should  only  execute if the source exists.  If the "?" is followed by a name, it is
              used instead of <u>SOURCE</u> as the filename to test.

       <u>OWNER</u>  (optional) is the owner user ID or name for the target file.

       <u>GROUP</u>  (optional) is the group ID or name for the target file.

       <u>MODE</u>   is the permissions of the installed file in octal.

       <u>DIR</u>    is the subdirectory of the installation prefix for the destination file.

       <u>FILENAME</u>
              (optional) is the name of the file  to  install  into  the  directory.   It  may  be  omitted  for
              directories.

       <u>SOURCE</u> (optional)  is the name of the source file to install, if it differs from the destination file, or
              the path in the symlink.

       If <u>SOURCE</u> contains wildcards, the command is repeated once for each matching filename.

       If <u>FILENAME</u> is empty, it is replaced with the value of <u>SOURCE</u> after wildcard expansion.  Each instance of
       "$N" in <u>FILENAME</u> where "N" is a single digit is replaced with the Nth part of the source filename.   "$0"
       is replaced with the whole source filename.

       The  target filename is "PREFIX/TOP/DIR/FILENAME" where "PREFIX" is the value of <u>$install_prefix</u> if it is
       set, <u>TOP</u> is the directory given on the command line, and <u>DIR</u> and <u>FILENAME</u> given in the installation file.

       o      "c" lines copy regular files from the current directory

       o      "d" lines create directories

       o      "s" lines create symlinks (<u>UID</u>, <u>GID</u>, and <u>MODE</u> are ignored)

       o      "l" lines copy libraries using libtool

       When <b>bg-installer</b> encounters a base directory directive, as indicated above,  it  opens  the  file  named
       <u>conf-BASE</u> (where <u>BASE</u> is the word on the directive line), reads the first line, and uses that as the base
       directory (prefixed by <u>$install_prefix</u> as above).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              List the files as they are processed.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--dry-run</b>
              Don't modify any files, just display.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--check</b>
              Check destinations instead of installing.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display usage information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
              &gt;bin
              c:::755::prog2
              c?:root:root:4750::prog2
              &gt;include
              d:::755:package
              c:::644:package:base.h:pkgbase.h
              s:::::package.h:package/base.h

       This  reads <u>conf-bin</u>, and installs <u>prog1</u> and setuid root <u>prog2</u> (if it was built) under it.  It then reads
       <u>conf-include</u>, creates the directory <u>package</u> under it, and installs <u>pkgbase.h</u> as <u>base.h</u> in that directory.
       It also creates a symlink <u>package.h</u> to <u>package/base.h</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>install_prefix</u>
              If set, is prefixed to all destination file names.
