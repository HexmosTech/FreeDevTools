</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       piuparts - .deb installation, upgrade, and removal testing suite

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>piuparts</b>  [<u>-a</u>  <u>-p</u>  <u>-v</u>  <u>-V</u>]  [<u>-d</u> <u>distro</u>] [<u>-i</u> <u>filename</u>] [<u>-I</u> <u>regexp</u>] [<u>-l</u> <u>logfile</u>] [<u>-m</u> <u>URL</u>] [<u>--bindmount</u> <u>dir</u>]
       [<u>package</u> ...] [<u>changes_file</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>piuparts</b> tests that Debian packages handle installation, upgrading, and removal correctly. It  does  this
       by  creating  a minimal Debian installation in a chroot, and installing, upgrading, and removing packages
       in that environment, and comparing the state of the directory tree before and after. <b>piuparts</b> reports any
       files that have been added, removed, or modified during this process.

       <b>piuparts</b> is meant as a quality assurance tool for people who create Debian packages to test  them  before
       they upload them to the Debian package archive.

       By default, piuparts can do three different tests:

       • A  simple  install-purge  test  within  one Debian distribution (chosen with the <u>-d</u> option, unstable by
         default). It sets up the chroot with the desired distribution, then installs and purges  the  packages,
         and reports problems.

       • A simple install-upgrade-purge test within one Debian distribution. This test is like the install-purge
         test,  but  it  installs  the  packages first via <b>apt-get</b> and then upgrades them with the package files
         given on the command line. If the command line has package names (option  <u>--apt</u>  used),  or  no  tested
         package  is  known  to  <b>apt-get</b>  (new  packages),  this  test  is  skipped,  otherwise  it is performed
         automatically.

       • An upgrade test between Debian releases. This test is enabled by using the <u>-d</u> option multiple times and
         disables the other two tests. It sets up the chroot with the first distribution named, then upgrades it
         to each successive one, and then remembers the directory tree state at the end. After this,  it  starts
         over  with  the  chroot of the first distribution, installs the desired packages (via <b>apt-get</b> <b>install</b>),
         and does the successive upgrading (via <b>apt-get</b> <b>dist-upgrade</b>). Then, if  package  files  (and  not  just
         package  names)  were given on the command line, it installs them. Finally, it reports problems against
         the state of the directory tree at the last distribution compared with the state without  the  packages
         having  been  installed.  This  test  can  be  quite slow to execute. Note that this does not work with
         experimental, because <b>apt-get</b> does not automatically upgrade to packages in  experimental.  To  test  a
         particular package or group of packages in experimental, use the second test.

       Command  line  arguments  are the paths to package files (e.g., <b>piuparts_1.0-1_all.deb</b>), paths to changes
       files (e.g., <b>piuparts_1.0-1_i386.changes</b>), or names of packages, if the <u>--apt</u> option is given.

       When processing changes files, by default, all packages in a changes file will be processed together with
       all individual packages given on the command line. Then  each  package  given  on  the  command  line  is
       processed  in  a  single  group.  If <u>--single-changes-list</u> is used, the packages in all changes files are
       processed together along with any individual packages that were given on the command line. To avoid  this
       behaviour, it is possible to specify <u>--single-packages</u>.

       <b>piuparts</b>  outputs  to  the  standard  output some log messages to show what is going on. If a log file is
       used, the messages go there as well.

       <b>piuparts</b> requires root rights to test packages. It does not have to  be  run  in  the  initial  namespace
       though.  When  running it as non-root, it'll create a new Linux namespace and rerun itself as root inside
       said namespace. For this to work, your user needs have an subuid range (which happens by default since  a
       few years) and you need to install the <u>uidmap</u> package to provide setuid helpers <b>newuidmap</b> and <b>newgidmap</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options must come before the other command line arguments.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--apt</b>
              The  package  arguments  on  the command line are to be treated as package names and installed via
              <b>apt-get</b> <b>install</b> instead of being names of package files, to be installed via <b>dpkg</b> <b>-i</b>.

       <b>--allow-database</b>
              Allow starting MySQL and PostgreSQL database servers in the chroot for packages requiring database
              access in their maintainer scripts.  Do not use this option if there is already a database  server
              running  on the system running <b>piuparts</b> (or <b>piuparts-slave</b>)!  In master-slave setups with multiple
              slaves running on one host collisions may occur, these will be detected by  <b>detect_piuparts_issues</b>
              and the affected packages will be tested again.

       <b>--arch</b> <b>arch</b>
              Create  chroot  and  run tests for (non-default) architecture <u>arch</u>. The default is the output from
              <b>dpkg</b> <b>--print-architecture</b>.

       <b>-b</b> <b>tarball,</b> <b>--basetgz</b> <b>tarball</b>
              Use <b>tarball</b> as the contents of the initial chroot, instead of building a new one with <b>debootstrap</b>.

              The tarball can be created with the <u>-s</u> option, or you can use one that <b>pbuilder</b> has  created  (see
              <u>-p</u>).  If  you  create  one  manually, make sure the root of the chroot is the root of the tarball.
              Despite the option name implying gzip compression, the compression scheme is deduced by  <b>tar</b>  from
              the filename suffix.

       <b>--bindmount</b> <b>dir</b>
              Bind-mount a directory inside the chroot.

       <b>--bootstrapcmd</b> <b>cmd</b>
              Set  alternative  chroot  bootstrap  command  (including  command  line  options).  The default is
              <b>debootstrap</b> <b>--variant=minbase</b>. Needs to  be  compatible  with  typical  <b>debootstrap</b>  command  line
              options   such   as   <b>--arch</b>   and   <b>--include</b>.   For  <b>mmdebstrap</b>  use:  <b>--bootstrapcmd=mmdebstrap</b>
              <b>--skip=check/empty</b> <b>--variant=minbase</b>.

       <b>-d</b> <b>name,</b> <b>--distribution</b> <b>name</b>
              Which Debian distribution to use:  a  code  name  (for  example  <b>bullseye</b>,  <b>bookworm</b>  or  <b>sid</b>)  or
              <b>experimental</b>. The default is <b>sid</b> (= <b>unstable</b>).

       <b>-D</b> <b>flavor,</b> <b>--defaults</b> <b>flavor</b>
              Use  default  settings  suitable  for  a particular flavor of Debian: either <b>debian</b> or <b>ubuntu</b>. The
              default is <b>debian</b>.

       <b>--do-not-verify-signatures</b>
              Do  not  verify  signatures  from  the  Release  files  when   running   debootstrap.   Also   set
              <b>APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated</b> accordingly in <b>/etc/apt/apt.conf</b> in the chroots.

       <b>--dpkg-force-confdef</b>
              Make  <b>dpkg</b>  use  <b>--force-confdef</b>, which lets <b>dpkg</b> always choose the default action when a modified
              conffile is found. This option will make <b>piuparts</b> ignore errors it  was  designed  to  report  and
              therefore  should  only be used to hide problems in depending packages. <u>This</u> <u>option</u> <u>shall</u> <u>normally</u>
              <u>not</u> <u>be</u> <u>used.</u> (See <u>#466118</u>.)

       <b>--dpkg-noforce-unsafe-io</b>
              Prevent running <b>dpkg</b> with <b>--force-unsafe-io</b>.  <b>--force-unsafe-io</b> causes <b>dpkg</b> to skip  certain  file
              system  syncs  known  to  cause  substantial  performance  degradation on some filesystems.  Thus,
              including this option reverts to  safe  but  slower  behavior.   The  <u>--dpkg-noforce-unsafe-io</u>  is
              required for running tests on distributions older than squeeze.

       <b>--no-eatmydata</b>
              Prevent  use  of eatmydata.  The --no-eatmydata option is required for running tests on squeeze or
              older distributions.

       <b>--extra-old-packages</b> <b>pkg1[,pkg2]...</b>
              Install additional old packages before upgrading.  Allows testing package renames/merges where the
              old  package  is  no  longer  available  in  the  new  distribution  and  the  new  one   utilizes
              Conflicts/Replaces.  The argument is a comma separated list of package names and the option can be
              given multiple times.  For install/purge tests these packages will be installed before the package
              that is to be tested.

       <b>-e</b> <b>dirname,</b> <b>--existing-chroot</b> <b>dirname</b>
              Use  the  specified  directory  as  source  for the new chroot, instead of building a new one with
              debootstrap. This is similar to <u>--basetgz</u>, but  the  contents  are  not  archived.  See  also  the
              <u>--hard-link</u> option.

       <b>--distupgrade-to-testdebs</b>
              Use  the  "testdebs"  repository  to override the packages in the distupgrade target distribution.
              This allows one to test complex upgrade paths before the packages enter the archive.

       <b>--extra-repo</b> <b>deb-line</b>
              Provide an additional (unparsed) line to be appended to <b>sources.list</b>, for example:

                 'deb &lt;URL&gt; &lt;distrib&gt; &lt;components&gt;'
                  or
                 'deb file:// &lt;/bind/mount&gt; ./'

              Useful for e.g. backports, security or local repositories that cannot be handled by <u>--mirror</u>.  May
              be repeated to add more than one line.

       <b>--fake-essential-packages</b> <b>pkg1[,pkg2]...</b>
              Install  additional  packages  in  the  base chroot that are not removed after the test. These are
              available during purge and for checking against mistreatment.  Takes a  comma  separated  list  of
              package names and can be given multiple times.

       <b>--hard-link</b>
              When  the  <u>--existing-chroot</u>  option  is used, and the source directory is on the same filesystem,
              hard-link files instead of copying them. This is faster, but any modifications to  files  will  be
              reflected in the originals.

       <b>-i</b> <b>filename,</b> <b>--ignore</b> <b>filename</b>
              Add  a  filename  to  the  list of filenames to be ignored when comparing changes before and after
              installation. By default, <b>piuparts</b> ignores files that always change during a package  installation
              and  uninstallation, such as <b>dpkg</b> status files. The filename should be relative to the root of the
              chroot (e.g., <b>var/lib/dpkg/status</b>).  Filenames prefixed with a  <b>:</b>  will  be  logged  verbosely  if
              found.  This option can be used as many times as necessary.

       <b>-I</b> <b>regexp,</b> <b>--ignore-regexp</b> <b>regexp</b>
              Add  a  regular  expression  pattern  to  the  list  of  patterns for filenames to be ignored when
              comparing changes before and after installation.  Patterns prefixed with a <b>:</b>  will  log  verbosely
              all matching files.  This option can be used as many times as necessary.

       <b>--install-purge-install</b>
              Purge package after installation and reinstall. All dependencies are available during purge.

       <b>--install-recommends</b>
              Enable installation of Recommends.

       <b>--install-suggests</b>
              Enable installation of Suggests.

       <b>--install-remove-install</b>
              Remove    package    after    installation    and   reinstall.   For   testing   installation   in
              config-files-remaining state.

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--keep-env</b>
              Depending on which option is passed, keep the environment used for testing after the program ends

                 • By default it doesn't remove the temporary directory for the chroot,

                 • or if <u>--schroot</u> is used, the schroot session is not terminated,

                 • or if <u>--docker-image</u> is used, the container created is not destroyed.

       <b>-K</b> <b>filename,</b> <b>--keyring</b> <b>filename</b>
              Use <b>filename</b> as the keyring to use with debootstrap when creating chroots.

       <b>--keep-sources-list</b>
              Don't modify the chroot's <b><a href="file:/etc/apt/sources.list">/etc/apt/sources.list</a></b>.

       <b>--list-installed-files</b>
              List the files added  to  the  chroot  after  the  installation  of  the  package  and  after  the
              installation of the package dependencies.

       <b>--lvm-volume</b> <b>lvm-volume</b>
              Use  the  specified  <u>lvm-volume</u>  as  source  for  the  chroot,  instead of building a new one with
              debootstrap. This creates a snapshot of the given LVM volume and mounts it to the chroot path.

       <b>--lvm-snapshot-size</b> <b>snapshot-size</b>
              Use the specified <u>snapshot-size</u> as snapshot size when creating a new LVM snapshot (default: 1G)

       <b>-l</b> <b>filename,</b> <b>--log-file</b> <b>filename</b>
              Append log file to <b>filename</b> in addition to the standard output.

       <b>--log-level</b> <b>level</b>
              Display messages from loglevel <u>level</u>, possible values are: <u>error</u>, <u>info</u>, <u>dump</u>, <u>debug</u>.  The  default
              is <u>dump</u>.

       <b>--max-command-output-size</b> <b>size</b>
              Set  the maximum permitted command output to <u>size</u> (in MB) for debugging runs exceeding the default
              of 8 MB.

       <b>--merged-usr</b>
              When using debootstrap to create the chroot, use the <b>--merged-usr</b> option to create a  chroot  with
              <b><a href="file:/bin">/bin</a></b>, <b><a href="file:/lib">/lib</a></b>, <b><a href="file:/sbin">/sbin</a></b> being symlinks to their <b><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></b> counterparts.

       <b>--no-merged-usr</b>
              When using debootstrap to create the chroot, use the <b>--no-merged-usr</b> option.

       <b>-m</b> <b>URL,</b> <b>--mirror</b> <b>URL</b>
                 Which  Debian  mirror to use. The default is the first mirror named in <b><a href="file:/etc/apt/sources.list">/etc/apt/sources.list</a></b> or
                 <b><a href="http://deb.debian.org/debian">http://deb.debian.org/debian</a></b> if none is found. This option may be used multiple  times  to  use
                 multiple mirrors. Only the first mirror is used with <b>debootstrap</b>.

                 The 'components' that are used for a mirror can also be set with this option: a space separated
                 list  within  the  same argument (so you need to quote the entire argument in the shell). If no
                 components are given explicitly, the usual Debian components are used (<u>main</u>, <u>contrib</u>,  <u>non-free</u>
                 and  <u>non-free-firmware</u>).  For  the  mirrors read from <b><a href="file:/etc/apt/sources.list">/etc/apt/sources.list</a></b>, the components are
                 read from the same place.

              Note that <b>file:</b> addresses work if the directories are made accessible from within the chroot  with
              <u>--bindmount</u>.

       <b>--no-adequate</b>
              Don't run <b>adequate</b> after installation. The default is to run <b>adequate</b>, provided it is installed.

       <b>--no-check-valid-until</b>
              Set  <b>apt</b> option <b>Acquire::Check-Valid-Until=false</b> in the chroot to ignore the expiration of Release
              files. This is needed for testing archived releases.

       <b>--no-diversions</b>
              Don't check for broken diversions.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--no-ignores</b>
              Forget all built-in and other ignores that have been set so far. Any <u>-i</u> or <u>-I</u> arguments that  come
              after this one will be obeyed, but none of the ones that come before.

       <b>-N,</b> <b>--no-symlinks</b>
              Don't check for broken symlinks.

       <b>--fail-if-inadequate</b>
              Fail  on  inadequate  results  from running <b>adequate</b>. The default is to just issue those errors as
              warnings.

       <b>--fail-on-broken-symlinks</b>
              Fail on broken symlinks. The default is to just issue those errors as warnings.

       <b>--no-upgrade-test</b>
              Skip testing upgrade from an existing version in the archive.

       <b>--no-install-purge-test</b>
              Skip the install and purge test.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--pbuilder</b>
              Use <b>/var/cache/pbuilder/base.tgz</b> as the base tarball. This is a shorthand so that you  don't  need
              to use <u>-b</u> for it.

       <b>--pedantic-purge-test</b>
              Be  pedantic  when  checking  if  a purged package leaves files behind. If this option is not set,
              files left in <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b> are ignored.

       <b>--proxy</b> <b>URL</b>
              Use the proxy at <u>URL</u> to  access  the  Debian  mirror(s).  Takes  precedence  over  the  <b>http_proxy</b>
              environment variable. Using a local proxy is recommended because <b>piuparts</b> may use large amounts of
              bandwidth to repeatedly download the same files.

       <b>-s</b> <b>filename,</b> <b>--save</b> <b>filename</b>
              Save  the  chroot,  after it has been set up, as a tarball into <b>filename</b>. It can then be used with
              <u>-b</u>.

       <b>-B</b> <b>filename,</b> <b>--end-meta</b> <b>filename</b>
              Load  chroot  package  selection  and  file  meta   data   from   <b>filename</b>.   See   the   function
              <b>install_and_upgrade_between_distros()</b>  in  <b>piuparts.py</b> for defaults. Mostly useful for large scale
              distro upgrade tests.

       <b>-S</b> <b>filename,</b> <b>--save-end-meta</b> <b>filename</b>
              Save chroot package selection and file meta data in <b>filename</b>  for  later  use.  See  the  function
              <b>install_and_upgrade_between_distros()</b>  in  <b>piuparts.py</b> for defaults. Mostly useful for large scale
              distro upgrade tests.

       <b>--scriptsdir</b> <b>directory</b>
              Directory where are custom scripts are placed. By default, this is not set. For  more  information
              about this, read <b>README_server.txt</b>

       <b>--schroot</b> <b>SCHROOT-NAME</b>
              Use  schroot session named <u>SCHROOT-NAME</u> for the testing environment, instead of building a new one
              with <b>debootstrap</b>.

       <b>--docker-image</b> <b>DOCKER-IMAGE</b>
              Use a container created from the docker image <u>DOCKER-IMAGE</u> for the testing environment, instead of
              building a new one with <b>debootstrap</b>.  This  only  supports  <b>overlay2</b>  for  now  and  it  uses  the
              <b>MergedDir</b> layer where <b>piuparts</b> can access, add, edit and remove files easily by directly accessing
              the directory.

       <b>--single-changes-list</b>
              When  processing changes files, <b>piuparts</b> will process the packages in each individual changes file
              separately. This option will set <b>piuparts</b> to scan the packages of all changes files together along
              with any individual package files that may have been given on the command line.

       <b>--single-packages</b>
              Process every package file or package name  individually,  thus  <b>piuparts</b>  process  runs  multiple
              times. This option can be useful with conflicting packages.

       <b>--shell-on-error</b>
              Start  an  interactive  shell  in  the chroot after an error occurred.  This should help debugging
              failures directly inside the <b>piuparts</b> test environment.  The chroot cleanup  will  continue  after
              the  shell  terminates.   Note:  This  does  not  work  if  the  <b>piuparts</b> command is prefixed with
              'timeout', which is usually the case in  command  lines  directly  copied  from  logfiles  from  a
              master-slave setup. Removing the 'timeout' part is sufficient.

       <b>--skip-minimize</b>
              Allow  skip  minimize  chroot  step.  This  is  useful when you want to test several packages with
              <b>piuparts</b>. You can prepare a tarball already minimized and skip this step in all the tests. This is
              the default now.

       <b>--minimize</b>
              Minimize the chroot with debfoster. This used to be the default until <u>#539142</u> was fixed.

       <b>--skip-cronfiles-test</b>
              Skip testing the output from the cron files left in the system after remove a package.

       <b>--skip-logrotatefiles-test</b>
              Skip testing the output from the logrotate files left in the system after remove a package.

       <b>--testdebs-repo</b> <b>deb-line</b>
              Provide an additional line to be appended to sources.list, for example:

                 'deb [ trusted=yes ] &lt;URL&gt; &lt;distrib&gt; &lt;components&gt;'
                  or
                 'deb [ trusted=yes ] file:// &lt;/bind/mount&gt; ./'

              If only an URL or local path is given as argument, <b>deb</b> <b>[</b> <b>trusted=yes</b> <b>]</b>, <b>file://</b>, and  <b>./</b>  will  be
              prepended/appended  as  needed.  The "testdebs" repository provides the packages to be tested (and
              some additional dependencies, if needed, e.g. all packages built from the same source  package  as
              the  (binary)  package  being tested) and can be used for testing complex installation and upgrade
              scenarios involving dependencies that are  not  yet  in  the  archive.  This  repository  will  be
              available  only for installing the target packages. Dependency resolution will be done by <b>apt-get</b>.
              The packages to be tested can be passed as <b>.deb</b>s or as package names (with <u>--apt</u>).

              The <b>trusted=yes</b> option causes this (and only this)  repository  to  be  trustworthy  even  if  the
              Packages  file is not signed, such that a (globally acting) <u>--do-not-verify-signatures</u> will not be
              needed.

       <b>-t</b> <b>directory,</b> <b>--tmpdir</b> <b>directory</b>
              Use <u>directory</u> as the place where temporary files and directories are created. The default  is  the
              environment  variable  <u>TMPDIR</u>,  or  <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b>  if  not  set.  Note: the temporary directory must <u>not</u> be
              mounted with the <u>nodev</u> or <u>nosuid</u> mount option.

       <b>--update-retries</b> <b>num-retries</b>
              Rerun <b>apt-get</b> <b>update</b> up to <u>num-retries</u> times.  Useful to work around  temporary  network  failures
              and hashsum mismatch errors.

       <b>--upgrade-before-dist-upgrade</b>
              Perform two-stage upgrades: <b>apt-get</b> <b>upgrade</b> <b>&amp;&amp;</b> <b>apt-get</b> <b>dist-upgrade</b>.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              This option no longer has any meaning, but it is still accepted for backwards compatibility.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Write out the version number of the program.

       <b>--warn-on-debsums-errors</b>
              Print a warning rather than failing if debsums reports modified files.

       <b>--warn-on-leftovers-after-purge</b>
              Print a warning rather than failing if files are left behind after purge.

       <b>--warn-on-others</b>
              Print  a  warning  rather than failing if files are left behind, modified, or removed by a package
              that was not given on the command-line.

              This way, you can basically isolate the purge test to your own packages.  If  a  package  that  is
              brought  in  as  a  dependency  doesn't purge cleanly, the test will not fail because of it (but a
              warning message will be printed).

              Behavior with multiple packages given on the command-line could be  problematic,  particularly  if
              the  dependency  tree  of  one  package in the list includes another in the list. Therefore, it is
              recommended to use this option with one package at a time.

       <b>--warn-on-usr-move</b> <b>disabled|warn|fail</b>
              Whether to enable the test (with a warning or a failure) that checks if files  are  moved  between
              <b>/</b><u>bin|sbin|lib*</u> and <b><a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a></b><u>bin|sbin|lib*</u>.  Accepted values: <u>disabled</u> (default), <u>warn</u>, <u>fail</u>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Assume  that you have just built a new version of your Debian package, to be uploaded to Debian unstable.
       It is in <b>../foo_1.0-2_i386.deb</b> and you would like to know whether it installs  and  uninstalls  properly.
       Here's what you would do:

          piuparts ../foo_1.0-2_i386.deb

       If  the  package  exists  in  the  Debian  archive already, the above command also tests that it upgrades
       properly.

       To do the same test, but using a particular mirror, and only the main component, you would do this:

          piuparts -m '<a href="http://gytha/debian">http://gytha/debian</a> main' ../foo_1.0-2_i386.deb

       If you want to do the same as above but for your changes files, pass in your changes files  when  running
       <b>piuparts</b>,  and <b>piuparts</b> will process each package in the changes files as though you had passed all those
       packages on the command line to <b>piuparts</b> yourself. For example:

          piuparts ../foo_1.0-2_i386.changes

          piuparts -m '<a href="http://gytha/debian">http://gytha/debian</a> main' ../foo_1.0-2_i386.changes

       If you want to test that a package installs properly in the stable (currently bullseye)  Debian  release,
       then  can  be  upgraded  to  the  testing  (currently  bookworm)  and  unstable  (sid) versions, and then
       uninstalled without problems, you would give the following command:

          piuparts -a -d bullseye -d bookworm -d sid foo

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>TMPDIR</b> Location for temporary files and directories. If not set, use <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b>. See also the <u>--tmpdir</u> option.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Output of commands run by <b>piuparts</b> is limited to three megabytes. To change this limit, the  source  code
       needs to be edited.  Commands exceeding this limit will be aborted.
