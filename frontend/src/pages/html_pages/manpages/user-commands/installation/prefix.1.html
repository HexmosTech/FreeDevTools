</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       prefix  - Script that allows you to reconfigure environment variables for multiple installations of a set
       of software installed on the same machine

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>prefix</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       It is assumed that the software for each installation is all under  a  single  directory  whose  name  is
       assigned to an environment variable called PREFIX.

       This  arrangement  of  enabling  multiple installations of software on a single machine is useful at many
       times. On a single server, it  can  provide  for  development,  test,  and  production  installations  of
       software.  Alternatively, on development servers, it allows for multiple development "sandboxes", one for
       each developer. On production servers, it allows for multiple versions of the production software  to  be
       installed.  One might be the currently running software, one the previous software kept online as a fall-
       back, and one a new release of software wich is scheduled to be brought online soon.

       There are three usages of the prefix script:

              (1) The interactive usage should be placed as the last line
                  of a user's ".profile".  The user must be running the
                  Korn shell (ksh) or the Bourne Again shell (bash).
                  The user is prompted to enter one of the known PREFIX locations,
                  specified in the $HOME/.prefixes file or the /etc/prefixes file.
                  During configuration, the $PREFIX/.prefixrc file is sourced
                  in order to accomplish environment-specific configurations.

              (2) The non-interactive user configuration does not consult
                  $HOME/.prefixes or /etc/prefixes or prompt the user, but merely
                  configures the environment in accordance with the cmd line argument.

              (3) The batch command usage is mainly for running commands from
                  cron or running commands in another environment without changing
                  to that environment.

       Usage (1): . prefix                     (sets up environment)
             (2): . prefix &lt;prefix&gt;            (non-interactive setup)
             (3): prefix &lt;prefix&gt; &lt;cmd&gt; &lt;args&gt; (runs cmd configured for PREFIX)
