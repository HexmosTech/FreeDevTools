</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>innoextract</b> is a tool that can extract installer executables created by Inno Setup.

       <b>innoextract</b> will extract files from installers specified on the command line.

       To  extract  a multi-part installer with external data files, only the executable (.exe) file needs to be
       given as an argument to <b>innoextract</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--</b>     Treat all arguments after this one as files, even if they begin with a dash.

       <b>--check-password</b>
              Abort  processing if the password provided using the <b>--password</b> or <b>--password-file</b> option does not
              match the checksum stored in the installer.

              The password checksum used for this check can be retrieved using the <b>--show-password</b> option.

       <b>--codepage</b> <u>CODEPAGE</u>
              Non-Unicode versions of  Inno  Setup  store  strings  in  an  unspecified  encoding.  By  default,
              <b>innoextract</b>  will  guess  the  encoding  from  the  installer's  language  list,  falling  back to
              Windows-1252. This option can be used to override that guess  by  specifying  a  non-zero  Windows
              codepage number to use.

              On  non-Windows  platforms,  <b>innoextract</b> will ignore the system locale and always use UTF-8 as the
              filesystem and standard output encoding - the <b>--codepage</b> option only changes the  input  encoding.
              However,  using  codepage  number  "<b>65001</b>" instructs <b>innoextract</b> to assume all strings are already
              encoded as UTF-8 and to output them without conversion.

              This option has no effect with Unicode-enabled installers,  which  always  use  UTF-16LE.  Invalid
              UTF-16  data is represented using the WTF-8 encoding which is a straightforward extension of UTF-8
              to represent unpaired UTF-16 surrogate code units.

       <b>--collisions</b> <u>ACTION</u>
              Inno Setup installers  can  contain  duplicate  files  with  the  same  name.  This  option  tells
              innoextract what to do when such a collisions is encountered. Valid actions are:

              "<b>overwrite</b>"
                     Extract  only  one  of  the  colliding  files. The choice is done similar to how Inno Setup
                     overwrites files during installation. This is the default.

              "<b>rename</b>"
                     Rename files that would be overwritten using the "<b>overwrite</b>" action by appending  a  suffix
                     comprised  of  the  file's language, its architecture, the component it belongs to and/or a
                     number to make the filename unique. The language suffix (if applicable) is also appended to
                     the <u>default</u> file that would have been extracted with the "<b>overwrite</b>" action.

              "<b>rename-all</b>"
                     Rename all colliding files by appending a suffix comprised  of  the  file's  language,  its
                     architecture,  the component it belongs to and/or a number to make the filename unique. The
                     complete suffix is appended to both files  that  would  have  been  overwritten  using  the
                     "<b>overwrite</b>" action and to those that would have overwritten other files.

              "<b>error</b>"
                     Exit when a collision is detected.

              <b>Rename</b> <b>rules:</b>

              1.  If  the  <b>component</b> is not the same for all files in the collision set (all files with the same
              filename), "<b>#</b>" (without quotes) followed by the component id is appended to  all  files  that  are
              specific to a single component.

              2.  If  the  <b>language</b>  is  not  the  same for all files in the collision set, "<b>@</b>" (without quotes)
              followed by the language id is appended to all files that are specific to a single language unless
              that language matches the default language specified by the <b>--default-language</b>. While  the  suffix
              is  omitted  for  the default language, no numbered suffix is added in it's place unless needed to
              make the filename unique.

              3. If the <b>architecture</b> is not the same for all files in the collision set,  "<b>@32bit</b>"  or  "<b>@64bit</b>"
              (without quotes) is appended to all files that are specific to a single architecture.

              4.  If  no  suffix  was  added  by  the  previous steps, or if the filename is not yet unique, "<b>$</b>"
              (without quotes) followed by the lowest integer (starting at 0) to make  the  filename  unique  is
              appended.

              With the "<b>rename</b>" action, steps 1 and 3 are only applied to files that would have been overwritten
              by the "<b>overwrite</b>" action while "<b>rename-all</b>" applies them to all files in the collision set.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--color</b>[=<u>ENABLE</u>]
              By  default  <b>innoextract</b> will try to detect if the terminal supports shell escape codes and enable
              or disable color output accordingly. Specifically, colors will  be  enabled  if  both  <b>stdout</b>  and
              <b>stderr</b>  point  to  a  TTY,  the  <b>TERM</b>  environment  variable is not set to "<b>dumb</b>" and the <b>NO_COLOR</b>
              environment variable is unset. Pass <b>1</b> or <b>true</b> to <b>--color</b> to force color output. Pass <b>0</b> or <b>false</b> to
              never output color codes.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--data-version</b>
              Print the Inno Setup data version of the installer and exit immediately.

              The version printed using this option is the one stored in the setup file and can differ from  the
              version printed with other actions as the stored data version is not always correct.

              This  option  can  be  used  to determine if a file is an Inno Setup installer without loading any
              compressed headers.

              This option cannot be combined with any other action.

       <b>--default-language</b> <u>LANG</u>
              Set a language as the default.

              With <b>--collisions=overwrite</b> (the default) this will change the choice of which  file  to  keep  to
              always  prefer  the  given language. In effect, <b>--default-language</b> behaves almost like <b>--language</b>,
              except that files are extracted for all languages if they have different names.

              When using the <b>--collisions=rename</b> option, <b>--default-language</b> chooses a  language  for  which  the
              files should keep the original name if possible.

       <b>--dump</b> Don't convert Windows paths to UNIX paths and don't substitute constants in paths.

              When  combining  <b>--dump</b>  with  <b>--extract</b>  innoextract  will  <u>not</u> ensure that the paths don't point
              outside the destination directory. Use this option with caution when handling untrusted files.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--exclude-temp</b>
              Don't extract files that would have been deleted at the end of the install process. Such files are
              marked with [temp] in the file listing.

              This option takes precedence over <b>--include</b> and <b>--language</b>: temporary files  are  never  extracted
              when using the <b>--exclude-temp</b>, even if they match the selected language or include expressions.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--extract</b>
              Extract  all files to the current directory. This action is enabled by default, unless one or more
              of  the  <b>--list</b>,  <b>--list-sizes</b>,   <b>--list-checksums</b>,   <b>--test</b>,   <b>--list-languages</b>,   <b>--gog-game-id</b>,
              <b>--show-password</b> or <b>--check-password</b> actions are specified.

              By default innoextract will continue after encountering file checksum errors. The <b>--extract</b> option
              can be combined with <b>--test</b> to abort on checksum errors.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-extract-unknown</b>
              By  default  innoextract will try to extract installers with an unknown Inno Setup data version by
              treating it as the closest known version. This option tells innoextract to abort instead.

       <b>-g</b>, <b>--gog</b>
              Try to process additional .bin files that have the same basename as the setup but are not actually
              part of the Inno Setup installer. This is the case for newer multi-part GOG.com  installers  where
              these  .bin  files are RAR archives, potential encrypted with the MD5 checksum of the game ID (see
              the <b>--gog-game-id</b> option).

              Extracting these RAR archives requires rar, unrar or lsar/unar command-line utilities to be in the
              PATH.

              The <b>--list</b>, <b>--test</b>, <b>--extract</b> and <b>--output-dir</b> options are passed along to unrar/unar,  but  other
              options  may  be  ignored  for  the  RAR files. For multi-part RAR archives, the <b>--test</b> requires a
              writable output directory for temporary files  which  can  be  specified  using  the  <b>--output-dir</b>
              option.  If  the output directory does not exist it will be created and then removed after testing
              is done. Parent directories are not created. Temporary files  created  inside  the  directory  are
              always removed.

              Note  that  is  option  is geared towards GOG.com installers. Other installers may come be bundled
              with different extraneous <u>.bin</u> which this option might not be able to handle.

              This option also forces re-assembly of GOG Galaxy file parts. See the <b>--no-gog-galaxy</b>  option  for
              details.

       <b>--no-gog-galaxy</b>
              Some  GOG.com  installers  contain  files in GOG Galaxy format (split into multiple parts that are
              individually compressed) which are re-assembled using post-install scripts. By default <b>innoextract</b>
              will try to re-assemble such files if it detects a GOG.com installer. This option disables that.

              GOG.com installers are detected using the publisher and URL fields in the setup headers.  Use  the
              <b>--gog</b> option to force reassembly for all installers.

       <b>--gog-game-id</b>
              Determine  the  ID  used  by GOG.com for the game contained in this installer. This will only work
              with Galaxy-ready GOG.com installers.

              This option can be combined with <b>--silent</b> to print only the game ID without additional syntax that
              would make consumption by other scripts harder.

              The <b>--gog-game-id</b> action can be combined with <b>--list</b>, <b>--test</b>, <b>--extract</b>  and/or  <b>--list-languages</b>.
              If <b>--silent</b> and <b>--gog-game-id</b> are combined with <b>--list</b> and/or <b>--list-languages</b>, the game ID (or an
              empty line) will be printed on it's own line before the file list but after the language list.

              For  newer  multi-part  GOG.com installers the <u>.bin</u> files are not part of the Inno Setup installer
              but instead are RAR archives. Some of these RAR files are encrypted, with the password  being  the
              MD5 checksum of the game ID:

                <b>innoextract</b> <b>--gog-game-id</b> <b>--silent</b> <u>setup_....exe</u> | <b>md5sum</b> | <b>cut</b> <b>-d</b> ' ' <b>-f</b> 1

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Show a list of the supported options.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--include</b> <u>EXPR</u>
              If  this  option  is  specified,  innoextract will only process files whose path matches <u>EXPR</u>. The
              expression can be either a single path component (a  file  or  directory  name)  or  a  series  of
              successive path components joined by the OS path separator (\ on Windows, / elsewhere).

              The  expression  is always matched against one or more full path components. Filtering by parts of
              filenames is currently not supported. Matching is done case-insensitively.

              <u>EXPR</u> may contain one leading path separator, in which case the rest of the expression  is  matched
              against the start of the path. Otherwise, the expression is matched against any part of the path.

              The  <b>--include</b>  option  may  be  repeated  in  order  allow files matching against one of multiple
              patterns. If <b>--include</b> is not used, all files are processed.

       <b>-i</b> <b>--info</b>
              This is a convenience option to enable all actions that print information about the installer.

              Scrips should not rely on the output format  with  this  option  and  should  instead  enable  the
              individual actions instead.

              Currently this option enables <b>--list-languages</b>, <b>--gog-game-id</b> and <b>--show-password</b>.

       <b>--language</b> <u>LANG</u>
              Extract only language-independent files and files for the given language. By default all files are
              extracted.

              To also skip language-independent files, combine this option with <b>--language-only</b>.

       <b>--language-only</b>
              Only extract files that are language-specific.

              This option can be combined with <b>--language</b> to only extract the files of a specific language.

       <b>--license</b>
              Show license information.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
              List files contained in the installer but don't extract anything.

              This action also enables the <b>--list-sizes</b> action unless either <b>--quiet</b> or <b>--silent</b> is specified.

              This  option can be combined with <b>--silent</b> to print only the names of the contained files (one per
              line) without additional syntax that would make consumption by other scripts harder.

              The <b>--list</b> action can be combined with <b>--test</b>, <b>--extract</b>, <b>--list-languages</b> and/or <b>--gog-game-id</b> to
              display the names of the files as they are extracted even with <b>--silent</b>.

       <b>--list-checksums</b>
              List checksums for files contained in the installer.

              This option implies the <b>--list</b> action and can be combined with the <b>--list-sizes</b>  option  to  print
              both the size and checksum for each file.

              With  <b>--silent</b> the file checksum will be printed at the start of the line (but after the file size
              if enabled with the <b>--list-sizes</b> option) followed by a space. Otherwise the  checksum  is  printed
              after the file name.

              The  checksum  type  can  be  one  of  <b>Adler32</b>,  <b>CRC32</b>, <b>MD5</b> or <b>SHA-1</b> and is printed in fron of the
              checksum hash followed by a space. <b>Adler32</b> and <b>CRC32</b> checksums are printed as "<b>0x</b>" followed by the
              32-bit hexadecimal value.

              Different files in the same installer can have different checksum types if GOG  Galaxy  file  part
              reassembly is not disabled using the <b>--no-gog-galaxy</b> option.

       <b>--list-languages</b>
              List languages supported by the installer.

              This  option can be combined with <b>--silent</b> to print only the identifiers of the languages (one per
              line) followed by a space and then the language name, without additional syntax  that  would  make
              consumption by other scripts harder.

              The <b>--list-languages</b> action can be combined with <b>--list</b>, <b>--test</b>, <b>--extract</b> and/or <b>--gog-game-id</b> to
              display  the  available languages before doing anything else. If <b>--silent</b> and <b>--list-languages</b> are
              combined with <b>--list</b> and/or <b>--gog-game-id</b>, the languages list will be  terminated  with  an  empty
              line and will precede both the game ID and files list.

       <b>--list-sizes</b>
              List uncompressed sizes for files contained in the installer.

              This  option  implies  the  <b>--list</b>  action and can be combined with the <b>--list-checksums</b> option to
              print both the size and checksum for each file.

              With <b>--silent</b> the file size in bytes will be printed at the start of the line followed by a space.
              Otherwise the size is printed after the file name in a human-friendly format.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--lowercase</b>
              Convert filenames stored in the installer to lower-case before extracting.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--output-dir</b> <u>DIR</u>
              Extract all files into the given directory. By default, <b>innoextract</b> will extract all files to  the
              current directory.

              If  the specified directory does not exist, it will be created. However, the parent directory must
              exist or extracting will fail.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--password</b> <u>PASSWORD</u>
              Specifies the password to decrypt encrypted files. The password is assumed to be encoded as  UTF-8
              and converted the internal encoding according used in the installer as needed.

              Use  the  <b>--password-file</b>  option to load the password from a file or standard input instead. This
              option cannot be combined with <b>--password-file</b>.

              If this password does not match the checksum stored in the  installer,  encrypted  files  will  be
              skipped  but  unencrypted  files will still be extracted. Use the <b>--check-password</b> option to abort
              processing entirely if the password is incorrect.

       <b>--password-file</b> <u>FILE</u>
              Load a password form the specified file. Only the first line excluding  the  terminating  carriage
              return  and/or  line break is used as the password. The password is assumed to be encoded as UTF-8
              and converted the internal encoding according used in the installer as needed.

              If the special file name "<b>-</b>" is used, the password will be read from standard input.

              Use the <b>--password</b> option to specify the password on the command-line instead. This option  cannot
              be combined with <b>--password</b>.

              If  this  password  does  not  match the checksum stored in the installer, encrypted files will be
              skipped but unencrypted files will still be extracted. Use the <b>--check-password</b>  option  to  abort
              processing entirely if the password is incorrect.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--progress</b>[=<u>ENABLE</u>]
              By  default  <b>innoextract</b> will try to detect if the terminal supports shell escape codes and enable
              or disable progress bar output accordingly. Pass <b>1</b> or <b>true</b> to <b>--progress</b>  to  force  progress  bar
              output. Pass <b>0</b> or <b>false</b> to never show a progress bar.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              Less verbose output.

       <b>--show-password</b>
              Show  checksum  <b>$c</b> and salt <b>$s</b> used for the password <b>$p</b> check as well as encoding of the password.
              The checksum is calculated from the salt concatenated with the password:

               <b>$c</b> <b>=</b> <b>hash($s</b> <b>.</b> <b>$p)</b>

              With the <b>--silent</b> option, the checksum name and hash is printed on one line seperated by  a  space
              followed by the salt encoded as hex bytes and password encoding on separate lines.

              Checksum  types  can  be  <b>CRC32</b>,  <b>MD5</b>  or  <b>SHA-1</b>  although  <b>CRC32</b>  is  not used in installers with
              encryption.

              Use the <b>--password</b> or <b>--password-file</b> option together with <b>--check-password</b> to check if a password
              matches this checksum.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--silent</b>
              Don't output anything except errors and warnings unless explicitly requested and  use  a  machine-
              readable output format.

              This  option  can  be combined with <b>--list</b> to print only the names of the contained files (one per
              line) without additional syntax that would make consumption by other scripts harder.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--test</b>
              Test archive integrity but don't write any output files.

              This option can be combined with <b>--extract</b> to abort on file checksum errors.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--timestamps</b> <u>TZ</u>
              Inno Setup installers can contain timestamps in both UTC and 'local' timezones.

              The <b>--timestamps</b> option specifies what timezone should be used to adjust these 'local' file times.

              Valid values are those accepted by <b>tzset</b> in the <b>TZ</b> environment variable, except with the direction
              of the time offset reversed: both <b>-T</b> <b>CET</b> and <b>-T</b> <b>GMT+1</b> will (when DST is in effect) give  the  same
              result.

              Besides timezones, two special values are accepted:

              "<b>none</b>"  Don't  preserve  file  times for extracted files, both for UTC and 'local' timestamps. The
                     file times will be left the way the OS set them when creating the output files.

              "<b>local</b>" Use the system timezone for 'local' timestamps. This is the normal  Inno  Setup  behavior,
                     and can be used together with the <b>TZ</b> environment variable.

              The  default  value  for this option is <b>UTC</b>, causing innoextract to not adjust 'local' file times.
              File times marked as UTC in the Inno Setup file will never be adjusted no matter what <b>--timestamps</b>
              is set to.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Print the <b>innoextract</b> version number and supported Inno Setup versions.

              If combined with the <b>--silent</b> option, only the version <u>number</u> is printed.  Otherwise,  the  output
              will  contain the name (innoextract) followed by the version number on the first line, and, unless
              the <b>--quiet</b> options is specified, the range of suuported Inno  Setup  installer  versions  on  the
              second line.

       <b>--no-warn-unused</b>
              By default, innoextract will print a warning if it encounters <u>.bin</u> files that look like they could
              be part of the setup but are not used. This option disables that warning.

</pre><h4><b>PATH</b> <b>CONSTANTS</b></h4><pre>
       Paths  in  Inno Setup installers can contain constants (variable or code references) that are expanded at
       install time. innoextract expands all such constants to their name  and replaces unsafe  characters  with
       <b>$</b>. For exmaple <b>{app}</b> is expanded to <b>app</b> while <b>{code:Example}</b> is expanded to <b>code$Example</b>.

       There is currently no way to configure this expansion except for disabling it with the <b>--dump</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>0</b>      Success

       <b>1</b>      Syntax or usage error

       <b>2+</b>     Broken or unsupported setup file, or input/output error

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There is no support for extracting individual components and limited support for filtering by name.

       Included scripts and checks are not executed.

       The mapping from Inno Setup constants like the application directory to subdirectories is hard-coded.

       Names for data slice/disk files in multi-file installers must follow the standard naming scheme.
