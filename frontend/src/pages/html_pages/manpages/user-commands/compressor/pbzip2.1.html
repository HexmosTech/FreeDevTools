</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pbzip2  -  parallel bzip2 file compressor, v1.1.10

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pbzip2</b> [ <b>-123456789</b> ] [ <b>-b#cdfhklm#p#qrS#tvVz</b> ] [ <u>filenames</u> <u>...</u>  ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>pbzip2</u>  is  a  parallel  implementation of the bzip2 block-sorting file compressor that uses pthreads and
       achieves near-linear speedup on SMP machines. The output of this version is fully compatible  with  bzip2
       v1.0.2 or newer (ie: anything compressed with <u>pbzip2</u> can be decompressed with bzip2).

       <u>pbzip2</u>  should  work on any system that has a pthreads compatible C++ compiler (such as gcc). It has been
       tested on: Linux, Windows (cygwin), Solaris, Tru64/OSF1, HP-UX, and Irix.

       The default settings for <u>pbzip2</u> will work well in most cases. The only switch you will likely need to use
       is -d to decompress files and -p to set the # of processors for  <u>pbzip2</u>  to  use  if  autodetect  is  not
       supported on your system, or you want to use a specific # of CPUs.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b#</b>    Where # is block size in 100k steps (default 9 = 900k)

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--stdout</b>
              Output to standard out (stdout)

       <b>-d,--decompress</b>

       <b>-k,--keep</b>
              Keep input file, do not delete

       <b>-l,--loadavg</b>
              Load average determines max number processors to use

       <b>-m#</b>    Where # is max memory usage in 1MB steps (default 100 = 100MB)

       <b>-p#</b>    Where # is the number of processors (default: autodetect)

       <b>-q,--quiet</b>
              Quiet mode (default)

       <b>-r,--read</b>
              Read entire input file into RAM and split between processors

       <b>-S#</b>    Child thread stack size in 1KB steps (default stack size if unspecified)

       <b>-t,--test</b>
              Test compressed file integrity

       <b>-v,--verbose</b>
              Verbose mode

       <b>-V</b>     Display version info for <u>pbzip2</u> then exit

       <b>-z,--compress</b>
              Compress file (default)

       <b>-1,--fast</b> <b>...</b> <b>-9,--best</b>
              Set BWT block size to 100k .. 900k (default 900k).

       <b>--ignore-trailing-garbage=#</b>
              Ignore trailing garbage flag (1 - ignored; 0 - forbidden)

       If no file names are given, pbzip2 compresses or decompresses from standard input to standard output.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>SIZES</b></h4><pre>
       You should be able to compress files larger than 4GB with <u>pbzip2.</u>

       Files  that are compressed with <u>pbzip2</u> are broken up into pieces and each individual piece is compressed.
       This is how <u>pbzip2</u> runs faster on multiple CPUs since the pieces can be compressed  simultaneously.   The
       final  .bz2  file  may be slightly larger than if it was compressed with the regular bzip2 program due to
       this file splitting (usually less than 0.2% larger).  Files that are compressed  with  <u>pbzip2</u>  will  also
       gain considerable speedup when decompressed using <u>pbzip2.</u>

       Files  that  were compressed using bzip2 will not see speedup since bzip2 packages the data into a single
       chunk that cannot be split between processors.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Example 1: pbzip2 myfile.tar

       This example will compress the file "myfile.tar" into the compressed file "myfile.tar.bz2". It  will  use
       the  autodetected  #  of  processors  (or 2 processors if autodetect not supported) with the default file
       block size of 900k and default BWT block size of 900k.

       Example 2: pbzip2 -b15k myfile.tar

       This example will compress the file "myfile.tar" into the compressed file "myfile.tar.bz2". It  will  use
       the  autodetected # of processors (or 2 processors if autodetect not supported) with a file block size of
       1500k and a BWT block size of 900k. The file "myfile.tar"  will  not  be  deleted  after  compression  is
       finished.

       Example 3: pbzip2 -p4 -r -5 myfile.tar second*.txt

       This example will compress the file "myfile.tar" into the compressed file "myfile.tar.bz2". It will use 4
       processors  with  a BWT block size of 500k.  The file block size will be the size of "myfile.tar" divided
       by 4 (# of processors) so that the data will be split evenly among each  processor.   This  requires  you
       have  enough RAM for pbzip2 to read the entire file into memory for compression. Pbzip2 will then use the
       same options to compress all other files that match the wildcard "second*.txt" in that directory.

       Example 4: tar cf myfile.tar.bz2 --use-compress-prog=pbzip2 dir_to_compress/
       Example 4: tar -c directory_to_compress/ | pbzip2 -c &gt; myfile.tar.bz2

       These examples will compress the data being given to pbzip2 via pipe from TAR into  the  compressed  file
       "myfile.tar.bz2".   It  will  use  the  autodetected  #  of processors (or 2 processors if autodetect not
       supported) with the default file block size of  900k  and  default  BWT  block  size  of  900k.   TAR  is
       collecting all of the files from the "directory_to_compress/" directory and passing the data to pbzip2 as
       it works.

       Example 5: pbzip2 -d -m500 myfile.tar.bz2

       This  example  will decompress the file "myfile.tar.bz2" into the decompressed file "myfile.tar". It will
       use the autodetected # of processors (or 2 processors if autodetect not supported). It will use a maximum
       of 500MB of memory for decompression.  The switches -b, -r, and -1..-9 are not valid for decompression.

       Example 6: pbzip2 -dc myfile.tar.bz2 | tar x

       This example will decompress and untar the file "myfile.tar.bz2" piping the output of  the  decompressing
       pbzip2 to tar.

       Example 7: pbzip2 -c &lt; myfile.txt &gt; myfile.txt.bz2

       This  example  will  read  myfile.txt  from  standard  input  compressing  it to standard output which is
       redirected to to myfile.txt.bz2.
