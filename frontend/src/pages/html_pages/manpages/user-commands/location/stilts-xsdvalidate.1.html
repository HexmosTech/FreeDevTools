       stilts-xsdvalidate - Validates against XML Schema

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>stilts</b> <b>xsdvalidate</b> [doc=<u>&lt;location&gt;</u>] [schemaloc=<u>&lt;namespace&gt;=&lt;location&gt;</u> <u>...</u>] [topel=<u>[{&lt;ns-uri&gt;}][&lt;local-</u>
                          <u>name&gt;]</u>] [verbose=<u>true|false</u>] [uselocals=<u>true|false</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xsdvalidate</u>  is  a utility for validating XML documents against XML Schemas. This is not very specific to
       STILTS, and does not claim to do a better job than other XSD validators out there, so if you can find an‐
       other one that suits your purposes, please use it. It was added to the package  however  since  it  seems
       hard to find suitable tools that do this job.

       The schema is not specified by runtime parameters, elements in a given XML document are validated against
       any  schemas associated with the namespaces defined in that document. However, it is possible to override
       the locations of schemas using runtime parameters. By using the <u>schemaloc</u> parameter,  you  can  tell  the
       validator  to  validate against a local copy of a schema or one at a given URL, rather than the copy that
       is referenced by <u>xsi:schemaLocation</u> attributes in the document itself. That can be convenient when devel‐
       oping a schema with a public namespace that is fixed, but content which is still subject to change. More‐
       over, some local copies of W3C and IVOA schemas are kept within the application, so that external network
       accesses are not required during validation.

       By default, successful validation results in no output and a success exit status, but if there are  vali‐
       dation errors then some indication of what went wrong is printed to standard output and the command exits
       with an error. This makes it suitable for use in makefiles.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>doc=</b><u>&lt;location&gt;</u>
              Location of XML document to validate.

       <b>schemaloc=</b><u>&lt;namespace&gt;=&lt;location&gt;</u> <u>...</u>
              Assignments  of  override  schema locations to XML namespaces. One or more assignments may be sup‐
              plied, each of the form <u>&lt;namespace&gt;=&lt;location&gt;</u> where the location may be a filename or URL. Multi‐
              ple assignments may be made by supplying the parameter multiple times, or using a space  character
              as a separator.

              Each  assignment causes any reference to the given namespace in the validated document to be vali‐
              dated with reference to the XSD schema at the given location rather than to a schema  acquired  in
              the default way (using <u>xsi:schemaLocation</u> attributes or using the namespace as a retrieval URL).

       <b>topel=</b><u>[{&lt;ns-uri&gt;}][&lt;local-name&gt;]</u>
              Local name of the top-level element expected in the parsed document. If the actual parsed top-lev‐
              el  element has a local name differing from this, an error will be reported. If no value is speci‐
              fied (the default) no checking is done.

       <b>verbose=</b><u>true|false</u>
              If true, some INFO reports will be displayed alongside any ERROR reports resulting from the parse.
              This may be useful for diagnosis or reassurance.

       <b>uselocals=</b><u>true|false</u>
              Whether to use local copies of VO schemas where available. If true, copies of  some  IVOA  schemas
              stored  within the application are used instead of retrieving them from their <a href="http://www.ivoa.net/">http://www.ivoa.net/</a>
              URLs. Setting this true is generally faster and more robust against network issues, though it  may
              risk retrieving out of date copies of the schemas.
