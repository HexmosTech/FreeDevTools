       stilts-votcopy - Transforms between VOTable encodings

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>stilts</b> <b>votcopy</b> [in=<u>&lt;location&gt;</u>] [out=<u>&lt;location&gt;</u>] [format=<u>TABLEDATA|BINARY|BINARY2|FITS</u>]
                      [version=<u>1.0|1.1|1.2|1.3|1.4|1.5</u>] [charset=<u>&lt;xml-encoding&gt;</u>] [cache=<u>true|false</u>]
                      [href=<u>true|false</u>] [nomagic=<u>true|false</u>] [base=<u>&lt;location&gt;</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  VOTable standard provides for three basic encodings of the actual data within each table: TABLEDATA,
       BINARY and FITS. TABLEDATA is a pure-XML encoding, which is relatively easy for humans to read and write.
       However, it is verbose and not very efficient for transmission and processing, for which reason the  more
       compact  BINARY  format has been defined. FITS format shares the advantages of BINARY, but is more likely
       to be used where a VOTable is providing metadata 'decoration' for an existing FITS  table.  In  addition,
       the BINARY and FITS encodings may carry their data either inline (as the base64-encoded text content of a
       <u>STREAM</u> element) or externally (referenced by a <u>STREAM</u> element's <u>href</u> attribute).

       These  different  formats  have their different advantages and disadvantages. Since, to some extent, pro‐
       grammers are humans too, much existing VOTable software deals in TABLEDATA format even though it may  not
       be  the most efficient way to proceed. Conversely, you might wish to examine the contents of a BINARY-en‐
       coded table without use of any software more specialised than a text editor. So there are times  when  it
       is desirable to convert from one of these encodings to another.

       <u>votcopy</u> is a tool which translates between these encodings while making a minimum of other changes to the
       VOTable  document.  The  processing  may  result in some changes to lexical details such as whitespace in
       start tags, but the element structure is not modified. Unlike <u>tpipe</u> it does not impose  STIL's  model  of
       what constitutes a table on the data between reading it in and writing it out, so subtleties dependent on
       the exact structure of the VOTable document will not be mangled. The only important changes should be the
       contents of <u>DATA</u> elements in the document.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>in=</b><u>&lt;location&gt;</u>
              Location  of the input VOTable. May be a URL, filename, or "-" to indicate standard input. The in‐
              put table may be compressed using one of the known compression formats  (Unix  compress,  gzip  or
              bzip2).

       <b>out=</b><u>&lt;location&gt;</u>
              Location of the output VOTable. May be a filename or "-" to indicate standard output.

       <b>format=</b><u>TABLEDATA|BINARY|BINARY2|FITS</u>
              Determines the encoding format of the table data in the output document. If <u>null</u> is selected, then
              the  tables will be data-less (will contain no DATA element), leaving only the document structure.
              Data-less tables are legal VOTable elements.

              The <u>BINARY2</u> format is only available for <u>version</u>=<u>1.3</u>

       <b>version=</b><u>1.0|1.1|1.2|1.3|1.4|1.5</u>
              Determines the version of the VOTable standard to which the output will conform. If null (the  de‐
              fault), the output table will have the same version as the input table.

       <b>charset=</b><u>&lt;xml-encoding&gt;</u>
              Selects  the Unicode encoding used for the output XML. The available options are dependent on your
              JVM, use <u>help=charset</u> for a full listing. Setting the value null will use  the  JVM's  system  de‐
              fault.

       <b>cache=</b><u>true|false</u>
              Determines  whether the input tables are read into a cache prior to being written out. The default
              is selected automatically depending on the input table; so you should  normally  leave  this  flag
              alone.

       <b>href=</b><u>true|false</u>
              In  the  case  of BINARY or FITS encoding, this determines whether the STREAM elements output will
              contain their data inline or externally. If set false, the output document will be self-contained,
              with STREAM data inline as base64-encoded characters. If true, then for each TABLE in the document
              the binary data will be written to a separate file and referenced by an href attribute on the cor‐
              responding STREAM element. The name of these files is usually determined by the name of  the  main
              output file; but see also the  <u>base</u> flag.

       <b>nomagic=</b><u>true|false</u>
              Eliminate  the  <u>null</u>  attributes  of <u>VALUES</u> elements where they are no longer required. In VOTable
              versions &lt;=1.2, the only way to specify null values for integer-type scalar columns was to use the
              <u>null</u> attribute of the <u>VALUES</u> element to indicate an in-band magic value  representing  null.  From
              VOTable v1.3, null values can be represented using empty <u>&lt;TD&gt;</u> elements or flagged specially in <u>BI‐</u>
              <u>NARY2</u>  streams. In these cases, it is recommended (though not required) not to use the <u>VALUES</u>/<u>null</u>
              mechanism.

              If this parameter is set true, then any <u>VALUES</u>/<u>null</u> attributes will be removed in VOTable 1.3  BI‐
              NARY2 or TABLEDATA output. If this results in an empty <u>VALUES</u> element, it too will be removed.

              This  parameter  is  ignored  if  the  output VOTable version is lower than 1.3 or if <u>format</u>=BINA‐
              RY/FITS.

       <b>base=</b><u>&lt;location&gt;</u>
              Determines the name of external output files written when the <u>href</u> flag is  true.  Normally  these
              are given names based on the name of the output file. But if this flag is given, the names will be
              based  on  the  <u>&lt;location&gt;</u> string. This flag is compulsory if <u>href</u> is true and <u>out=-</u> (output is to
              standard out), since in this case there is no default base name to use.
