       <b>pcp-check</b> - manage the configuration of optional PCP components

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$pcp-check</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-l</b>] [<b>-n</b>] [<b>-s</b>] [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-x</b>] [component ...]
       <b>$pcp-check</b> [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-c</b> script]] [<b>-d</b>] [<b>-l</b>] [<b>-n</b>] [<b>-s</b>] [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-x</b>]
       <b>$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmcheck</b> ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) includes a number of core components that are likely to be pre-configured
       and operational, but it also includes a larger number of components that are not active by  default.   In
       the  context  of <b>pmcheck</b> these components cover services that are typically started as part of the system
       boot procedure, e.g.  <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/pmlogger.1.html">pmlogger</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/pmproxy.1.html">pmproxy</a></b>(1), etc. or optional Performance Metric Domain Agents
       (PMDAs) that augment the available performance metrics exported by <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1).

       <b>pmcheck</b> allows the interrogation of the state of components with the <b>-s</b>, <b>--state</b> option.  Components  can
       be  activated  with  the  <b>-a</b>,  <b>--activate</b> option, or deactivated with the <b>-d</b>, <b>--deactivate</b> option.  These
       three options are clearly mutually exclusive for any single execution of <b>pmcheck</b>, and in the  absence  of
       any of them <b>-s</b> is assumed to be the default.

       The  set  of  components to be interrogated or configured are specified by the <u>component</u> name(s) from the
       command line, else all known components in the absence of any <u>component</u>  arguments.   When  one  or  more
       <u>component</u> arguments are specified, these may optionally be <b><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></b>(1) (glob) patterns that are matched against
       the names of the known components.

       The  <b>-l</b>,  <b>--list</b>  option  reports  on  known  components.   With one or more <u>components</u> each is reported.
       Without any <u>component</u> arguments the <u>-l</u> option lists  all  known  components,  which  is  simply  all  the
       component  scripts  (see  the  <b>COMPONENT</b>  <b>SCRIPTS</b> section below) stored in the <u>$PCP_SHARE_DIR/lib/pmcheck</u>
       directory.  If the <b>-v</b> option is also used, a short  description  of  each  requested  component  is  also
       displayed.

       Additional  components  can be integrated into the <b>pmcheck</b> framework, and the <b>-c</b>, <b>--file</b> option allows an
       alternate <b><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></b>(1) <u>script</u> to be used instead of a script associated with a known <u>component</u>.

       In concert with the <b>-a</b> or <b>-d</b> options, the <b>-n</b>, <b>--show-me</b> option performs a  dry  run,  showing  the  <b><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></b>(1)
       commands  that  would be needed to perform the reconfiguration, but no reconfiguration is done.  Commands
       that need to be run as ``root'' are prefixed with <b>#</b> and other commands are prefixed with <b>$</b>.

       The <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b> option increases reporting verbosity.

       The <b>-x</b>, <b>--trace</b> option may be used specify that the component scripts are run with <b>-x</b>  option  to  <b><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></b>(1).
       This  can  assist  with  debugging  the  failure of a component script or during the development of a new
       component script, probably also involving the <b>-c</b> option to <b>pmcheck</b>.

       The <b>-?</b>, <b>--help</b> option displays a usage message.

       As a convience, <b>pmcheck</b> <b>.</b>  is an alias for <b>pcp-check</b>.

</pre><h4><b>COMPONENT</b> <b>SCRIPTS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>pmcheck</b> framework is extensible, as the set of known components  is  defined  by  the  names  of  the
       component scripts in the <u>$PCP_SHARE_DIR/lib/pmcheck</u> directory.

       Each component script needs to abide by the following rules for correct integration with <b>pmcheck</b>:

       • The  script  will  be run with <b><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></b>(1), if you need some other scripting language then you must provide a
         <b><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></b>(1) wrapper.
       • Since each script is responsible for one component, the name of the component is implied,  however  the
         name  of the component is also passed from <b>pmcheck</b> as the sole argument after the options.  This allows
         generic component scripts to be implemented as hard links below <u>$PCP_SHARE_DIR/lib/pmcheck</u>.
       • When called with a <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b> option the script does nothing, unless it is also called with a <b>-v</b> option
         in which case a short description of the component is displayed on standard output.
       • When called with a <b>-s</b>, <b>--state</b> option, the script must exit with the an exit code  that  indicates  the
         component's  state, namely 0 (active), 1 (inactive, but <u>could</u> be activated by <b>pmcheck</b>), 2 (inactive and
         <u>cannot</u> be activated by <b>pmcheck</b>).  The distinction between exit codes 1 and 2 is based on many  factors,
         but  1  usually  means  all  of  the required software packages (PCP and other) are installed, required
         prerequisite services are running or could be safely  started,  and  any  component  configuration  can
         assume default settings or can be reliably deduced, e.g. a port number for communications.  Conversely,
         2  means  automatic  activation  of  the  component  is  not possible and some end-user intervention is
         required.
       • When called with a <b>-a</b>, <b>--activate</b> option the script must activate the component.  This means making any
         required configuration change so that it <u>is</u> restarted at the next system reboot or <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) restart, and
         starting the component if it is currently inactive,
       • When called with a <b>-d</b>, <b>--deactivate</b> option the  script  must  deactivate  the  component.   This  means
         stopping  the component if it is currently active, and making any required configuration change so that
         it <u>is</u> <u>not</u> restarted at the next system reboot or <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1) restart.
       • When called with a <b>-n</b>, <b>--show-me</b> option the script must  perform  a  dry  run  and  echo  any  required
         commands on standard output as per the rules described above for the <b>-n</b> option of <b>pmcheck</b>.
       • If  a  <b>-v</b>,  <b>--verbose</b>  option is also specified, the script should provide explanatory text on standard
         output to help explain, particularly in cases where the component is not active or the  reconfiguration
         failed.

       To  assist  with  component  script  development, the file <u>$PCP_SHARE_DIR/lib/checkproc.sh</u> may be sourced
       (after sourcing <u>$PCP_DIR/etc/pcp.env</u>).  <u>checkproc.sh</u> provides the following services:

       • A temporary directory is created and the shell variable <b>$tmp</b> is assigned to the full  pathname  of  the
         directory.
       • The shell variable <b>$status</b> is used to return the exit status from the script [defaults to 0].
       • The shell variable <b>$component</b> is assigned to the associated component name.
       • The  shell  variable  <b>$prog</b>  is assigned to the script's basename (so the component name in the default
         case).
       • A <b>trap</b> is installed to cleanup <b>$tmp</b> and exit with <b>$status</b>.
       • A <b>_do_args</b> shell procedure that handles all command argument parsing.
       • Shell variables <b>$aflag</b>, <b>$dflag</b>, <b>$lflag</b> or <b>$sflag</b> have default values of <b>false</b> and are set  to  <b>true</b>  by
         <b>_do_args</b> when the <b>-a</b>, <b>-d</b>, <b>-l</b> or <b>-s</b> options are parsed.
       • The  shell  variable <b>$show_me</b> has the default value of <b>false</b> and is set to <b>true</b> by <b>_do_args</b> when the <b>-n</b>
         option is parsed.
       • The shell variable <b>$verbose</b> counts number of <b>-v</b> options parsed by <b>_do_args</b>.
       • A <b>_ctl_svc</b> shell procedure that handles status requests and all reconfiguration operations for services
         that are managed by <b><a href="../man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl</a></b>(1) or  <b><a href="../man1/init.1.html">init</a></b>(1)  or  similar  infrastructure  layers.   <b>_ctl_svc</b>  takes  2
         arguments,  the  first  is  an  <u>action</u>  (one  of  <b>state</b>,  <b>start</b>,  <b>stop</b>, <b>activate</b> (enable and start), or
         <b>deactivate</b> (stop and disable), and the second is the <u>name</u> of the component;  for  <b><a href="../man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl</a></b>(1)  managed
         components,  <u>name</u>  should  be  the  basename of the service, e.g.  <b>pmcd</b> for the <b>pmcd.service</b> <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1)
         unit, otherwise <u>name</u> is the name of the <b><a href="../man1/init.1.html">init</a></b>(1) or similar ``rc'' script.
       • <b>_ctl_svc</b> will return a value (via <b>$?</b>  when called from a shell script)  that  matches  the  exit  codes
         defined above for each action.
       • A  <b>_ctl_pmda</b> shell procedure that handles status requests and all reconfiguration operations for a PMDA
         that is connected to <b><a href="../man1/pmcd.1.html">pmcd</a></b>(1).  <b>_ctl_pmda</b> takes at least 2 arguments, the first is  an  action  (one  of
         <b>state</b>,  <b>activate</b>  or  <b>deactivate</b>,  and  the  second  argument is the name of the PMDA.  For the <b>install</b>
         action, there is a third argument for the name of the PMDA's executable or DSO and an  optional  fourth
         argument  is the name of a file providing the input required for the PMDA's <u>Install</u> script (defaults to
         /dev/null).
       • <b>_ctl_pmda</b> will return a value (via <b>$?</b>  when called from a shell script) that  matches  the  exit  codes
         defined above for each action.

       So the following is the simplest possible component script for a system service.

       #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
       . $PCP_DIR/etc/pcp.env || exit 1
       . $PCP_SHARE_DIR/lib/checkproc.sh
       _do_args "$@"
       if $lflag
       then
           [ $verbose -gt 0 ] &amp;&amp; echo "my description"
       elif $sflag
       then
           _ctl_svc state $component
           status=$?
       elif $aflag
       then
           _ctl_svc activate $component || status=1
       elif $dflag
       then
           _ctl_svc deactivate $component || status=1
       fi

       And the following is the simplest possible component script for a PMDA.

       #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
       . $PCP_DIR/etc/pcp.env || exit 1
       . $PCP_SHARE_DIR/lib/checkproc.sh
       _do_args "$@"
       if $lflag
       then
           [ $verbose -gt 0 ] &amp;&amp; echo "my description"
       elif $sflag
       then
           _ctl_pmda state $component
           status=$?
       elif $aflag
       then
           _ctl_pmda activate $component || status=1
       elif $dflag
       then
           _ctl_pmda deactivate $component || status=1
       fi

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       For  <b>pmcheck</b>  (not  the component scripts) the exit status is typically 0, but values of 9 or 99 indicate
       serious internal botches.

       When the <b>-a</b> or <b>-d</b> options are used, the success or failure of the reconfiguration is reported on standard
       output.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEAT</b></h4><pre>
       Some components have prerequisites that demand additional non-PCP services be installed,  configured  and
       operational,  e.g.  a  database  server or a key-value server.  In these cases, probing the status of the
       non-PCP service may be subject to some access controls and if <b>pmcheck</b> is run as a non-root user, then the
       output from <b>-s</b> (the default) may be incomplete or misleading; in these circumstances, running <b>pmcheck</b>  as
       root should provide a more accurate report.

</pre><h4><b>PCP</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Environment  variables with the prefix <b>PCP_</b> are used to parameterize the file and directory names used by
       PCP.  On each installation, the file <u>/etc/pcp.conf</u> contains the local values for  these  variables.   The
       <b>$PCP_CONF</b> variable may be used to specify an alternative configuration file, as described in <b><a href="../man5/pcp.conf.5.html">pcp.conf</a></b>(5).
