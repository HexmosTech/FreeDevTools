</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ccomps - connected components filter for graphs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ccomps</b> [ <b>-sxvenzC?</b>  ] [ <b>-X</b><u>[#%]s[-f]</u> ] [ <b>-o</b><u>outfile</u> ] [ <u>files</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ccomps</b> decomposes graphs into their connected components, printing the components to standard output.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are supported:

       <b>-e</b>     Do not induce edges in the connected components.

       <b>-s</b>     No  output  graph  is  printed. The return value can be used to check if the graph is connected or
              not.

       <b>-x</b>     Only the connected components are printed, as separate graphs.

       <b>-v</b>     Counts of nodes, edges and connected components are printed.

       <b>-z</b>     Sort components by size, with the largest first. This is only effective if either  <b>-x</b>  or  <b>-X#</b>  is
              present.  Thus, <b>-zX#0</b> will cause the largest component to be printed.

       <b>-C</b>     Use  clusters  in  computing  components in addition to normal edge connectivity. In essence, this
              gives the connected components of the derived graph in which nodes top-level clusters and nodes in
              the original graph. This maintains all subgraph structure within a component, even if  a  subgraph
              does not contain any nodes.

       <b>-n</b>     Do not project subgraph structure. Normally, if <b>ccomps</b> produces components as graphs distinct from
              the  input  graph,  it will define subgraphs which are projections of subgraphs of the input graph
              onto the component. (If the projection is empty, no subgraph is produced.)  If this flag  is  set,
              the component contains only the relevant nodes and edges.

       <b>-X</b> <u>node_name</u>
              Prints only the component containing the node <u>node_name</u>, if any.

       <b>-X#</b> <u>start</u>


       <b>-X#</b> <u>start-</u>
       <b>-X#</b> <u>start-last</u>
              Prints  only components in the given range of indices. In the first form, only the component whose
              index is <u>start</u>, if any, is printed.  In the second form, each component whose index  is  at  least
              <u>start</u>  is  printed.  In  the  last  form,  only  those  components  whose indices are in the range
              <b>[</b><u>Istart</u><b>,</b><u>last</u><b>]</b> are printed.  Thus, the flag <b>-x</b> is equivalent to <b>-X#0-</b>.

       <b>-X%</b> <u>min</u>


       <b>-X%</b> <u>min-</u>
       <b>-X%</b> <u>min-max</u>
              Prints only components in the given range of sizes. In the first form, only a component whose size
              is <u>min</u>, if any, is printed.  In the second form, each component whose size  is  at  least  <u>min</u>  is
              printed.  In  the  last  form,  only  those components whose sizes are in the range <b>[</b><u>Imin</u><b>,</b><u>max</u><b>]</b> are
              printed.

       <b>-o</b> <u>outfile</u>
              If specified, each graph will be written to a different file with the names derived from  <u>outfile</u>.
              In  particular,  if  both  <b>-o</b> and <b>-x</b> flags are used, then each connected component is written to a
              different file. If <u>outfile</u> does not have a suffix, the first file will have the name <u>outfile</u>; then
              next <u>outfile_1</u>, then next <u>outfile_2</u>, and so on.  If <u>outfile</u> has  a  suffix,  i.e.,  has  the  form
              <u>base.sfx</u>, then the files will be named <u>base.sfx</u>, <u>base_1.sfx</u>, <u>base_2.sfx</u>, etc.

       By  default, each input graph is printed, with each connected component given as a subgraph whose name is
       a concatenation of the name of the input graph, the string "_cc_" and the number of the component.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand is supported:

       <u>files</u>   Names of files containing 1 or more graphs in dot format.  If no <u>files</u> operand is specified,  the
               standard input will be used.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       Unless  used  to  extract  a  single  connected  component,  <b>ccomps</b> returns <b>0</b> if all the input graphs are
       connected; and non-zero if any graph has multiple components, or any error occurred.  If just  extracting
       a single component, <b>ccomps</b> returns <b>0</b> on success and non-zero if an error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       It  is  possible,  though  unlikely, that the names used for connected components and their subgraphs may
       conflict with existing subgraph names.
