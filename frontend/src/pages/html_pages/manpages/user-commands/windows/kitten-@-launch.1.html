</pre><h4><b>Name</b></h4><pre>
       kitten-@-launch - Run an arbitrary process in a new window/tab

</pre><h4><b>Usage</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kitten</b> <b>@</b> <b>launch</b>  <b>[CMD</b> <b>...]</b>

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Prints  out  the  id of the newly opened window. Any command line arguments are assumed to be the command
       line used to run in the new window, if none are provided, the default shell is run. For example::

           kitten @ launch --title=Email mutt

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--match,</b> <b>-m</b>
              The tab to match. Match specifications are of the form: field:query. Where field can  be  one  of:
              id,  index, title, window_id, window_title, pid, cwd, cmdline env, var, state and recent. query is
              the expression to match. Expressions can be either a number or a regular expression,  and  can  be
              combined using Boolean operators.

              The special value all matches all tabs.

              For  numeric  fields:  id,  index,  window_id,  pid and recent, the expression is interpreted as a
              number, not a regular expression. Negative values for  id/window_id  match  from  the  highest  id
              number down, in particular, -1 is the most recently created tab/window.

              When  using title or id, first a matching tab is looked for, and if not found a matching window is
              looked for, and the tab for that window is used.

              You can also use window_id and window_title to match the tab that contains  the  window  with  the
              specified id or title.

              The index number is used to match the nth tab in the currently active OS window. The recent number
              matches  recently  active  tabs  in  the currently active OS window, with zero being the currently
              active tab, one the previously active tab and so on.

              When using the env field to match on environment variables, you can specify only  the  environment
              variable  name or a name and value, for example, env:MY_ENV_VAR=2. Tabs containing any window with
              the specified environment variables are matched. Similarly, var matches tabs containing any window
              with the specified user variable.

              The field state matches  on  the  state  of  the  tab.  Supported  states  are:  active,  focused,
              needs_attention,  parent_active  and  parent_focused.  Active tabs are the tabs that are active in
              their parent OS window. There is only one focused tab and it is the tab to which  keyboard  events
              are delivered. If no tab is focused, the last focused tab is matched.

              Note that you can use the kitten @ ls command to get a list of tabs.

       <b>--no-response</b>
              Do not print out the id of the newly created window.

       <b>--self</b> If  specified  the  tab containing the window this command is run in is used instead of the active
              tab

       <b>--title,</b> <b>--window-title</b>
              The title to set for the new window. By default, title is controlled by  the  child  process.  The
              special value current will copy the title from the currently active window.

       <b>--tab-title</b>
              The title for the new tab if launching in a new tab. By default, the title of the active window in
              the  tab is used as the tab title. The special value current will copy the title from the title of
              the currently active tab.

       <b>--type</b> <u>[=window]</u>
              Where to launch the child process:

              window
                  A new kitty window in the current tab

              tab
                  A new tab in the current OS window

              os-window
                  A new operating system window

              overlay
                  An overlay window covering the current active kitty window

              overlay-main
                  An overlay window covering the current active kitty window. Unlike  a  plain  overlay  window,
              this window is considered as a main window which means it is used as the active window for getting
              the  current  working  directory, the input text for kittens, launch commands, etc. Useful if this
              overlay is intended to run for a long time as a primary window.

              background
                  The  process  will  be  run  in  the  background,  without  a  kitty  window.  Note  that   if
              <b>--allow-remote-control</b>  <b>is</b>  <b>specified</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>KITTY_LISTEN_ON</b>  <b>environment</b> <b>variable</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>set</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b>
              <b>dedicated</b> <b>socket</b> <b>pair</b> <b>file</b> <b>descriptor</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control.</b>

              clipboard, primary
                  These two are meant to work with <b>--stdin-source</b> <b>to</b>  <b>copy</b>  <b>data</b>  <b>to</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>system</b>  <b>clipboard</b>  <b>or</b>
              <b>primary</b> <b>selection.</b>

              Choices: window, background, clipboard, os-window, overlay, overlay-main, primary, tab

       <b>--dont-take-focus,</b> <b>--keep-focus</b>
              Keep the focus on the currently active window instead of switching to the newly opened window.

       <b>--cwd</b>  The  working  directory  for  the  newly  launched child. Use the special value current to use the
              working directory of the currently active window. The special value last_reported  uses  the  last
              working  directory  reported  by  the  shell  (needs shell_integration to work). The special value
              oldest works like current but  uses  the  working  directory  of  the  oldest  foreground  process
              associated  with  the  currently active window rather than the newest foreground process. Finally,
              the special value root refers to the process that was  originally  started  when  the  window  was
              created.

       <b>--env</b>  Environment  variables  to  set  in  the  child  process.  Can  be specified multiple times to set
              different environment variables. Syntax: name=value. Using name= will set to empty string and just
              name will remove the environment variable.

       <b>--var</b>  User variables to set in the created window. Can be specified multiple times to set different user
              variables. Syntax: name=value. Using name= will set to empty string.

       <b>--hold</b> Keep the window open even after the command being executed exits, at a shell prompt.

       <b>--copy-colors</b>
              Set the colors of the newly created window to be the same as the colors in  the  currently  active
              window.

       <b>--copy-cmdline</b>
              Ignore  any  specified  command  line  and  instead use the command line from the currently active
              window.

       <b>--copy-env</b>
              Copy the environment variables from the currently active window  into  the  newly  launched  child
              process.  Note  that  this only copies the environment when the window was first created, as it is
              not possible to  get  updated  environment  variables  from  arbitrary  processes.  To  copy  that
              environment,  use  either  the  clone-in-kitty  feature  or  the kitty remote control feature with
              <b>--copy-env.</b>

       <b>--location</b> <u>[=default]</u>
              Where to place the newly created window when it is added to  a  tab  which  already  has  existing
              windows  in  it. after and before place the new window before or after the active window. neighbor
              is a synonym for after. Also applies to creating a new tab, where the value of  after  will  cause
              the  new  tab  to  be  placed next to the current tab instead of at the end. The values of vsplit,
              hsplit and split are only used by the splits layout and control if the new window is placed  in  a
              vertical,  horizontal or automatic split with the currently active window. The default is to place
              the window in a layout dependent manner, typically, after the currently active window.

              Choices: default, after, before, first, hsplit, last, neighbor, split, vsplit

       <b>--bias</b> <u>[=0]</u>
              The bias used to alter the size of the window. It controls what fraction of  available  space  the
              window takes. The exact meaning of bias depends on the current layout.

              *  Splits  layout:  The  bias  is  interpreted as a percentage between 0 and 100. When splitting a
              window into two, the new window will take up the specified fraction of the space  alloted  to  the
              original window and the original window will take up the remainder of the space.

              *  Vertical/horizontal  layout: The bias is interpreted as adding/subtracting from the normal size
              of the window. It should be a number between -90 and 90. This number is the percentage of  the  OS
              Window  size  that  should be added to the window size. So for example, if a window would normally
              have been size 50 in the layout inside an OS Window that is size 80 high and --bias -10 is used it
              will become *approximately* size 42 high. Note that sizes are approximations, you cannot use  this
              method to create windows of fixed sizes.

              *  Tall  layout:  If  the window being created is the *first* window in a column, then the bias is
              interpreted as a percentage, as for the splits layout,  splitting  the  OS  Window  width  between
              columns.  If  the  window  is a second or subsequent window in a column the bias is interpreted as
              adding/subtracting from the window size as for the vertical layout above.

              * Fat layout: Same as tall layout except it goes by rows instead of columns.

              * Grid layout: The bias is interpreted the same way as for the Vertical and Horizontal layouts, as
              something to be added/subtracted to the normal size. However, the since in a grid layout there are
              rows *and* columns, the bias on the first window in a column operates on the  columns.  Any  later
              windows in that column operate on the row. So, for example, if you bias the first window in a grid
              layout  it  will  change the width of the first column, the second window, the width of the second
              column, the third window, the height of the second row and so on.

              The bias option was introduced in kitty version 0.36.0.

       <b>--allow-remote-control</b>
              Programs running in this window can control kitty (even  if  remote  control  is  not  enabled  in
              <u>kitty.conf).</u>  <u>Note</u>  <u>that</u>  <u>any</u>  <u>program</u>  <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>right</u> <u>level</u> <u>of</u> <u>permissions</u> <u>can</u> <u>still</u> <u>write</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u>
              <u>pipes</u> <u>of</u> <u>any</u> <u>other</u> <u>program</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u> <u>computer</u> <u>and</u> <u>therefore</u> <u>can</u> <u>control</u> <u>kitty.</u> <u>It</u> <u>can,</u>  <u>however,</u>
              <u>be</u>  <u>useful</u> <u>to</u> <u>block</u> <u>programs</u> <u>running</u> <u>on</u> <u>other</u> <u>computers</u> <u>(for</u> <u>example,</u> <u>over</u> <u>SSH)</u> <u>or</u> <u>as</u> <u>other</u> <u>users.</u>
              <u>See</u> <b>--remote-control-password</b> <b>for</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>restrict</b> <b>actions</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>by</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control.</b>

       <b>--remote-control-password</b>
              Restrict the actions remote control is allowed to take. This works  like  <b>remote_control_password.</b>
              <b>You</b> <b>can</b> <b>specify</b> <b>a</b> <b>password</b> <b>and</b> <b>list</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>for</b> <b>remote_control_password.</b> <b>For</b> <b>example::</b>

                  --remote-control-password '"my passphrase" get-* set-colors'

              This password will be in effect for this window only. Note that any passwords you have defined for
              <b>remote_control_password</b>  <b>in</b> <u>kitty.conf</u> <u>are</u> <u>also</u> <u>in</u> <u>effect.</u> <u>You</u> <u>can</u> <u>override</u> <u>them</u> <u>by</u> <u>using</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u>
              <u>password</u> <u>here.</u> <u>You</u> <u>can</u> <u>also</u> <u>disable</u> <u>all</u> <b>remote_control_password</b> <b>global</b> <b>passwords</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b>  <b>window,</b>
              <b>by</b> <b>using::</b>

                  --remote-control-password '!'

              This  option  only  takes  effect  if  <b>--allow-remote-control</b>  <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>specified.</b> <b>Can</b> <b>be</b> <b>specified</b>
              <b>multiple</b> <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>multiple</b> <b>passwords.</b> <b>This</b> <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>kitty</b> <b>in</b> <b>version</b> <b>0.26.0</b>

       <b>--stdin-source</b> <u>[=none]</u>
              Pass the screen contents as <u>STDIN</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>child</u> <u>process.</u>

              @selection
                  is the currently selected text.

              @screen
                  is the contents of the currently active window.

              @screen_scrollback
                  is the same as @screen, but includes the scrollback buffer as well.

              @alternate
                  is the secondary screen of the current active window. For example if you  run  a  full  screen
              terminal  application,  the  secondary  screen  will be the screen you return to when quitting the
              application.

              @first_cmd_output_on_screen
                  is the output from the first command run in the shell on screen.

              @last_cmd_output
                  is the output from the last command run in the shell.

              @last_visited_cmd_output
                  is the first output below the last scrolled position via scroll_to_prompt,  this  needs  shell
              integration to work.

              Choices:  none,  @alternate, @alternate_scrollback, @first_cmd_output_on_screen, @last_cmd_output,

              <b>wrapped</b>  <b>at</b>  <b>screen</b>  <b>edges).</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>useful</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>to</b> <b>program</b> <b>that</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>duplicate</b>
              <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> <b>layout</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b>

       <b>--marker</b>
              Create a marker that highlights text in the newly created window. The syntax is the  same  as  for
              the toggle_marker action (see /marks).

       <b>--os-window-class</b>
              Set  the WM_CLASS property on X11 and the application id property on Wayland for the newly created
              OS window when using <b>--type.</b> <b>Defaults</b> <b>to</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>kitty</b>  <b>process,</b>  <b>which</b>  <b>in</b>
              <b>turn</b> <b>defaults</b> <b>to</b> <b>kitty.</b>

       <b>--os-window-name</b>
              Set  the  WM_NAME  property  on X11 for the newly created OS Window when using <b>--type.</b> <b>Defaults</b> <b>to</b>

       <b>--os-window-state</b> <u>[=normal]</u>
              The initial state for the newly created OS Window.

              Choices: normal, fullscreen, maximized, minimized

              vertical values. Can be specified multiple times. Note that this is ignored for overlay windows as
              these use the settings from the base window.

       <b>--watcher,</b> <b>-w</b>
              Path to a Python file. Appropriately named functions in this  file  will  be  called  for  various
              events,  such as when the window is resized, focused or closed. See the section on watchers in the
              launch command documentation: watchers. Relative paths are resolved relative to the  kitty  config

              resolved from the kitty configuration directory. Use - to read from STDIN. Use fd:num to read from
              the  file  descriptor num. Used if no <b>--password</b> <b>is</b> <b>supplied.</b> <b>Defaults</b> <b>to</b> <b>checking</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <u>rc-pass</u>
              <u>file</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>kitty</u> <u>configuration</u> <u>directory.</u>

       <b>--password-env</b> <u>[=KITTY_RC_PASSWORD]</u>
              The name of an environment variable to read the password  from.  Used  if  no  <b>--password-file</b>  <b>is</b>
              <b>supplied.</b> <b>Defaults</b> <b>to</b> <b>checking</b> <b>the</b> <b>environment</b> <b>variable</b> <b>KITTY_RC_PASSWORD.</b>

       <b>--use-password</b> <u>[=if-available]</u>
              If  no  password  is  available, kitty will usually just send the remote control command without a
              password. This option can be used to force it to always or never use the supplied password. If set
              to always and no password is provided, the blank password is used.

              Choices: if-available, always, never
