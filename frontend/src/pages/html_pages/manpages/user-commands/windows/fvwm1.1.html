</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fvwm1 - F(?) Virtual Window Manager for X11, version 1.x

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fvwm1</b> [ <u>options</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Fvwm</u>  is  a window manager for X11. It is a derivative of <u>twm</u>, redesigned to minimize memory consumption,
       provide a 3-D look to window frames, and  provide  a  simple  virtual  desktop.   Memory  consumption  is
       estimated  at  about  one-half to one-third the memory consumption of <u>twm</u>, due primarily to a redesign of
       <u>twm</u>'s method of storing mouse bindings. In addition, many of the configurable options of  <u>twm</u>  have  been
       removed.

       The  name  "FVWM"  used  to  stand  for something, but I forgot what. (Feeble, famous, foobar? It doesn't
       really matter, this is an acronym based society anyway.)

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THIS</b> <b>SOFTWARE</b></h4><pre>
       Since the release of FVWM 2.2 in March  1999,  this  release  is  officially  deprecated  and  no  longer
       supported.   Please do not report any bugs in this software.  Also, for Debian users, the module manpages
       for this release of FVWM will be found as <a href="../man1x/FvwmAudio1.1x.html">FvwmAudio1</a>(1x) etc.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>NOTE</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>XFREE86</b> <b>USERS</b></h4><pre>
       XFree86 provides a virtual screen whose operation can be confusing when used in  conjunction  with  <u>fvwm</u>.
       With XFree86 all windows which appear on the virtual screen actually get drawn into video memory (whether
       or  not  they  appear  on  the physical screen), so the virtual screen size is limited by available video
       memory.

       With <u>fvwm</u>'s virtual desktop, windows which do not appear on the screen do not  actually  get  drawn  into
       video  RAM.  The  size  of  the  virtual  desktop  is limited to about 32,000 by 32,000 pixels, but it is
       probably impractical to use a virtual desktop more  than  about  5  times  the  visible  screen  in  each
       direction.   Note  that memory usage is a function of the number of windows which exist - the size of the
       desktop makes no difference.

       When becoming familiar with <u>fvwm</u> it is recommended that you disable XFree86's virtual screen  by  setting
       the  virtual screen size to the physical screen size. After you become familiar with <u>fvwm</u> you may want to
       re-enable XFree86's virtual screen.

</pre><h4><b>ANATOMY</b> <b>OF</b> <b>A</b> <b>WINDOW</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Fvwm</u> puts a decorative border around most windows. This border consists of a bar on each side and a small
       "L" shaped section on each corner.  There is an additional top bar called the title bar which is used  to
       display  the  name  of the window. In addition, there are up to 10 title-bar buttons.  The top, side, and
       bottom bars are collectively known as the side-bars.  The corner pieces are called the frame.

       Unless the standard defaults files are modified, pressing mouse button 1 in the title or  side-bars  will
       begin  a  move  operation on the window. Pressing button 1 in the corner frame pieces will begin a resize
       operation. Pressing button 2 anywhere in the border brings up an extensive list of window operations.

       Up to ten title-bar buttons may exist. Their use is completely user definable.  The default configuration
       has a title-bar button on each side of the title-bar. The one on the left is used to bring up a  list  of
       window  options,  regardless  of  which mouse button is used. The one on the right is used to iconify the
       window.  The number of title-bar buttons used depends on which ones have mouse actions bound to them. See
       the section on the "Mouse" configuration parameter below.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>VIRTUAL</b> <b>DESKTOP</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Fvwm</u> provides multiple virtual desktops for users who wish to use them. The screen is a viewport  onto  a
       desktop  which  may  be  larger  than the screen. Several distinct desktops can be accessed (concept: one
       desktop for each project, or one desktop for each application,  when  view  applications  are  distinct).
       Since  each  desktop  can be larger than the physical screen, windows which are larger than the screen or
       large groups of related windows can easily be viewed.

       The size of the virtual desktops can be specified at start-up.  All virtual desktops  must  be  the  same
       size.  The  total  number  of  distinct desktops need not be specified, but is limited to approximately 4
       billion total. All windows on the current desktop can be displayed in a Pager, a miniature  view  of  the
       current desktop. Windows which are not on the current desktop can be listed, along with their geometries,
       in a window list, accessible as a pop-up menu.

       "Sticky"  windows  are  windows  which transcend the virtual desktop by "Sticking to the screen's glass."
       They always stay put on the screen.  This is convenient for things like clocks and xbiff's, so  you  only
       need to run one such gadget and it always stays with you.

       Window geometries are specified relative to the current viewport. That is:
       xterm -geometry +0+0
       will always show up in the upper-left hand corner of the visible portion of the screen. It is permissible
       to specify geometries which place windows on the virtual desktop, but off the screen. For example, if the
       visible  screen  is  1000 by 1000 pixels, and the desktop size is 3x3, and the current viewport is at the
       upper left hand corner of the desktop, then invoking:
       xterm -geometry +1000+1000
       will place the window just off of the lower right hand corner of the screen. It can be  found  by  moving
       the  mouse to the lower right hand corner of the screen and waiting for it to scroll into view.  There is
       currently no way to cause a window to map onto a desktop other than the currently active desk.

       A geometry specified as something like:
       xterm -geometry -5-5
       will generally place the window's lower right hand corner 5 pixels from the lower  right  corner  of  the
       visible portion of the screen. Not all applications support window geometries with negative offsets.

       Some  applications,  like  xterm and xfontsel, allow the user to specify the start-up desk on the command
       line:
       xterm -xrm "*Desk:1"
       will start an xterm on desk number 1. Not all applications understand this option, however.

</pre><h4><b>INITIALIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       During initialization, <u>fvwm</u> will search for a configuration file which describes key and button bindings,
       and a few other things. The format of these files will be described later. First, <u>fvwm</u> will search for  a
       file    named   .fvwmrc   in   the   users   home   directory.   Failing   that,   it   will   look   for
       /etc/X11/fvwm/system.fvwmrc for system-wide defaults. If that file is not found, <u>fvwm</u> will exit.

       <u>Fvwm</u> will set two environment variables which will be inherited by its children. These are $DISPLAY which
       describes the display on which <u>fvwm</u> is running. $DISPLAY may be unix:0.0 or :0.0, which doesn't work  too
       well when passed through rsh to another machine, so $HOSTDISPLAY will also be set and will use a network-
       ready description of the display.  $HOSTDISPLAY will always use the TCP/IP transport protocol (even for a
       local  connection)  so  $DISPLAY should be used for local connections, as it may use Unix-domain sockets,
       which are faster.

</pre><h4><b>SHAPED</b> <b>WINDOWS</b></h4><pre>
       If you typically use shaped windows such as xeyes or oclock, you have several options. You can make  them
       all  undecorated  (NoBorder  oclock  and  NoTitle  oclock,  for  example)  or  you  can  use  the default
       configuration and leave them decorated, in which case a decorative border and a solid-color backdrop  are
       shown.  Alternately, you can compile in the SHAPE extensions by changing a flag in the Makefile, in which
       case you get the shaped window with no backdrop, and a title bar floats  above  the  window.  The  shaped
       window  extensions  increase  the  window  manager's memory consumption by about 60 Kbytes when no shaped
       windows are present but have little effect when shaped windows are present.

</pre><h4><b>ICONS</b></h4><pre>
       The basic <u>Fvwm</u> configuration uses monochrome bitmap icons, similar to <u>twm</u>. If XPM extensions are compiled
       in, then color icons similar to ctwm, MS-Windows, or the Macintosh icons can be used.  In  order  to  use
       these options you will need the XPM package, as described in the Makefile.noImake and the Imakefile.

       If both the SHAPE and XPM options are compiled in you will get shaped color icons, which are very spiffy.

</pre><h4><b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       A  module  is  a separate program which runs as a separate Unix process but transmits commands to <u>fvwm</u> to
       execute. Future releases are expected to provide a means for these modules to extract window  information
       from  <u>fvwm</u>.  Users can write their own modules to do any weird or bizarre manipulations without affecting
       the integrity of <u>fvwm</u> itself.

       Modules MUST be spawned by <u>fvwm</u> so that it can set up two pipes for <u>fvwm</u> and the  module  to  communicate
       with. The pipes will already be open for the module when it starts and the file descriptors for the pipes
       are provided as command line arguments.

       Modules  can  be  spawned  during  <u>fvwm</u> initialization via the Module option, or at any time during the X
       session by use of the Module built-in. Modules can exist for the  duration  of  the  X  session,  or  can
       perform  a  single task and exit. If the module is still active when <u>fvwm</u> is told to quit, then <u>fvwm</u> will
       close the communication pipes and wait to receive a SIGCHLD from  the  module,  indicating  that  it  has
       detected the pipe closure and has exited. If modules fail to detect the pipe closure <u>fvwm</u> will exit after
       approximately  30  seconds  anyway.  The  number  of  simultaneously  executing modules is limited by the
       operating system's maximum number of simultaneously open files, usually between 60 and 256.

       Modules simply transmit text commands to the <u>fvwm</u> built-in command engine. Text  commands  are  formatted
       just  as  in the case of a mouse binding in the .fvwmrc setup file. Certain auxiliary information is also
       transmitted, as in the sample module GoodStuff. The GoodStuff module is documented in its own man page.

</pre><h4><b>ICCCM</b> <b>COMPLIANCE</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Fvwm</u> attempts to be ICCCM 1.1 compliant. As of this (1.20l) colormap handling  is  not  completely  ICCCM
       compliant.  In  addition,  ICCCM  states  that  it  should  be  possible  for applications to receive ANY
       keystroke, which is not consistent with the keyboard shortcut approach used in <u>fvwm</u> and most other window
       managers.

</pre><h4><b>M4</b> <b>PREPROCESSING</b></h4><pre>
       If <u>fvwm</u> is compiled with the M4 option, <u>fvwm</u> uses <u><a href="../man1/m4.1.html">m4</a>(1)</u> to preprocess its  setup  files  before  parsing.
       This  way  you  can use <u>m4</u> macros to perform operations at runtime.  This makes it very easy to work with
       different displays with different characteristics.

       For example, depending on your mood, you might want different color schemes.  One way of doing this is by
       using the <u>-m4opt</u> to specify your mood.  For a sunny mood use <u>-m4opt</u> <u>-DSunny</u>; for a dark mood  use  <u>-m4opt</u>
       <u>-DDark</u>.  Your .fvwmrc file might then contain:
       ifdef(`Sunny',`
       StdForeColor        Black
       StdBackColor        LightSkyBlue
       HiForeColor         yellow
       HiBackColor         PeachPuff1
       PagerBackColor      BlanchedAlmond ')

       ifdef(`Dark',`
       StdForeColor        Black
       StdBackColor        #60a0c0
       HiForeColor         black
       HiBackColor         #c06077
       PagerBackColor      #5c54c0
       PagerForeColor      orchid
       StickyForeColor          Black
       StickyBackColor          #60c0a0 ')

       The following <u>m4</u> symbols are predefined by <u>fvwm</u>:

       <b>BITS_PER_RGB</b>            The  number  of  significant  bits in an RGB color.  (log base 2 of the number of
                               distinct colors that can be created.  This is often different from the number  of
                               colors that can be displayed at once.)

       <b>CLASS</b>                   Your  visual  class.   Will  return  one  of  <b>StaticGray</b>, <b>GrayScale</b>, <b>StaticColor</b>,
                               <b>PseudoColor</b>, <b>TrueColor</b>, <b>DirectColor</b>, or, if it cannot determine  what  you  have,
                               <b>NonStandard</b>.

       <b>CLIENTHOST</b>              The machine that is running the clients.

       <b>COLOR</b>                   This  will  be  either  'Yes'  or  'No'.  This is just a wrapper around the CLASS
                               definition.  Returns 'Yes' on <b>*Color</b> and 'No' on <b>StaticGray</b> and <b>GrayScale</b>.

       <b>FVWMDIR</b>                 This is set to the path where the modules were configured to be installed.

       <b>FVWM_VERSION</b>            This is a string containing the version of <u>fvwm</u>.

       <b>HEIGHT</b>                  The height of your display in pixels.

       <b>HOME</b>                    The user's home directory.  Obtained from the environment.

       <b>HOSTNAME</b>                The canonical hostname running the clients  (ie.  a  fully-qualified  version  of
                               <b>CLIENTHOST</b>).

       <b>OPTIONS</b>                 This is a string of compile time options used.  Each option is separated from the
                               other by a space.

       <b>PLANES</b>                  The number of bit planes your display supports in the default root window.

       <b>RELEASE</b>                 The release number of your X server.  For MIT X11R5 this is <b>5</b>.

       <b>REVISION</b>                The X minor protocol revision.  As seen by <a href="../man3/ProtocolRevision.3.html">ProtocolRevision</a>(3).

       <b>SERVERHOST</b>              This variable is set to the name of the machine that is running the X server.

       <b>TWM_TYPE</b>                Tells  which <u>twm</u> offshoot is running.  It will always be set to the string "fvwm"
                               in this program.  This is useful for protecting parts of your  <u>.twmrc</u>  file  that
                               <u>fvwm</u>  proper  won't  understand (like <b>WorkSpaces</b>) so that it is still usable with
                               other <u>twm</u> programs.

       <b>USER</b>                    The name of the user running the program.  Obtained from the environment.

       <b>VENDOR</b>                  The vendor of your X server.  For example: <b>MIT</b> <b>X</b> <b>Consortium</b>.

       <b>VERSION</b>                 The X major protocol version.  As seen by <a href="../man3/ProtocolVersion.3.html">ProtocolVersion</a>(3).

       <b>WIDTH</b>                   The width of your display in pixels.

       <b>X_RESOLUTION</b>            The X resolution of your display in pixels per meter.

       <b>Y_RESOLUTION</b>            The Y resolution of your display in pixels per meter.

       You may well find that if you research the <u><a href="../man1/m4.1.html">m4</a>(1)</u> manual well and understand the power of <u>m4</u>, this will be
       a <b>very</b> useful and powerful tool.  But if you use any of the symbols which are predefined by <u>m4</u>,  you  are
       in severe danger!  For example, Sun's <u>m4</u> predefines <b>include</b>, so if you use that name in your .fvwmrc, you
       are  out  of luck.  The correct solution to this problem is to put a set of quotes around the troublesome
       word:  <b>`include'</b>.

       To help alleviate this problem, the following options may be useful.  To change  the  quoting  characters
       used by <u>m4</u>, use the options <u>-m4-squote</u> and <u>-m4-equote</u>.  Be sure to specify both options otherwise <u>m4</u> will
       be  confused.   When  these  are  given,  a  <u>changequote</u>  macro  is given before the users fvwmrc file is
       processed.

       <b>NOTE:</b> Some versions of <u>m4</u> are broken with respect to changing  quoting  characters  and  included  files.
       When  the  quoting  strings  are longer than one character, the macro "include(&lt;&lt;file&gt;&gt;)", where "&lt;&lt;" and
       "&gt;&gt;" are the quoting characters, contains extra characters around the  contents  of  the  included  file.
       This will confuse fvwm.  SunOS 4.1.3 is known to have this problem.

       If  you are using GNU <u>m4</u> an additional option is available.  By specifying <u>-m4-prefix</u> when starting <u>fvwm</u>,
       <u>m4</u> is instructed to prefix all builtin macros with <u>m4</u><b>_</b>.  Thus, <u>include</u> becomes <u>m4_include</u>.

       The availability of the m4 preprocessing is subject to the compilation define M4.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These are the command line options that are recoginzed by <u>fvwm</u>:

       <b>-f</b> <u>config_file</u>
              Causes <u>fvwm</u> to use <u>config_file</u> in the user's home directory  instead  of  .fvwmrc  as  the  window
              manager configuration file.

       <b>-debug</b> Puts X transactions in synchronous mode, which dramatically slows things down, but guarantees that
              <u>fvwm</u>'s internal error messages are correct.

       <b>-d</b> <u>displayname</u>
              Manage the display called "displayname" instead of the name obtained from the environment variable
              $DISPLAY.

       <b>-s</b>     On  a multi-screen display, run <u>fvwm</u> only on the screen named in the $DISPLAY environment variable
              or provided through the -d option. Normally, <u>fvwm</u> will attempt to start up on  all  screens  of  a
              multi-screen display.

       <b>-version</b>
              Print the version of <u>fvwm</u> to stderr.

       The following options are available only if fvwm is compiled with the M4 option.

       <b>-no-m4</b> Do  not  use  <u>m4</u>  to  preprocess the .fvwmrc.  The default is to preprocess the startup file using
              <u><a href="../man1/m4.1.html">m4</a>(1)</u>.

       <b>-m4-prefix</b>
              If GNU <u>m4</u> is available, cause <u>m4</u> to prefix all builtin commands with <u>m4</u><b>_</b>.

       <b>-m4opt</b> <u>option</u>
              Pass this option to <u>m4</u>.  The <u>option</u> can be any string of characters without spaces.   This  option
              can occur multiple times.  If GNU <u>m4</u> is available, <b>DO</b> <b>NOT</b> pass the <u>-P</u> option here.  Use <b>-m4-prefix</b>
              instead.

       <b>-m4-squote</b> <u>string</u>
              Use this given <b>string</b> as the starting quote characters.  You must also specify <b>-m4-equote</b><u>.</u>

       <b>-m4-equote</b> <u>string</u>
              Use this given <b>string</b> as the ending quote characters.  You must also specify <b>-m4-squote</b><u>.</u>

       <b>-m4prog</b> <u>path</u>
              Use  <u>path</u>  as  the  location of the desired m4 processor.  By default, m4prog is set to "m4" which
              must exist somewhere on the user's path.  This option allows the user  to  explicitly  choose  the
              version of m4 to use.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration  file is used to describe mouse and button bindings, colors, the virtual display size,
       and related items. This section describes the configuration options. Lines beginning  with  '#'  will  be
       ignored  by  <u>fvwm</u>.  Lines starting with '*' are expected to contain module configuration commands (rather
       than configuration commands for <u>fvwm</u> itself).

       AppsBackingStore
              Causes application windows to request backing store. This option compromises the ICCCM  compliance
              of  the  window  manager. While this option can speed things up in an X-terminal, where redraws of
              windows are expensive, it may not help much on regular workstations.

       AutoRaise <u>delay</u>
              Enables auto-raising of windows and specifies the time delay  (in  milliseconds)  between  when  a
              window  acquires  the input focus and when it is automatically raised. This option works in focus-
              follows-mouse mode, and in click-to-focus mode  if  the  focus  is  changed  by  clicking  in  the
              application  window  instead  of a decoration window. In click-to-focus mode, you can suppress the
              raise-on-focus behavior by specifying a negative delay value.

       BackingStore
              Causes <u>fvwm</u> decorations to request backing store. See the discussion on AppsBackingStore.

       BoundaryWidth <u>Width</u>
              Changes the boundary width on decorated windows to the specified value.  The default is 6 pixels.

              The Style command provides another (more general) method for specifying BoundaryWidth.

       ButtonStyle <u>button#</u> <u>Width</u>x<u>Height</u>
              Defines the rectangular decoration shape to be used in a title-bar button.  <u>button#</u> is the  title-
              bar  button number, and is between 0 and 9.  A description of title-bar button numbers is given in
              the Mouse section below.  Width is the percentage of the full button width which is  to  be  used.
              Height  is  the percentage of the full height to be used. Negative numbers cause the shading to be
              inverted.

              And that's not all! If you use a line like:
              ButtonStyle : 2 4 50x30@1 70x70@0 30x70@0 50x30@1
              then the button 2 decoration will use a 4-point pattern consisting of a line from  (x=50,y=30)  to
              (70,70)  in the shadow color (@0), and then to (30,70) in the shadow color, and finally to (50,30)
              in the highlight color (@1). Is that too confusing? See the sample system.fvwmrc.

       CenterOnCirculate
              When circulating, the desktop page containing the  window  which  the  pointer  is  moving  to  is
              automatically  selected. If CenterOnCirculate is selected then <u>fvwm</u> will do its best to center the
              target window in the desktop viewport, rather than just lining up to the closest page.

       CirculateSkip <u>windowname</u>
              Causes windows with the indicated name to be skipped over when the circulate-up or  circulate-down
              functions are invoked. <u>windowname</u> can be a window's name or its class.

              The Style command provides another (more general) method for specifying CirculateSkip.

       CirculateSkipIcons
              Causes circulate and warp operations to skip over iconified windows.

       ClickTime <u>delay</u>
              Specifies  the maximum delay (in milliseconds) between a button press and a button release for the
              Function built-in to consider the action a mouse click. The default delay is 150 milliseconds.

       ClickToFocus
              Normally keyboard input goes to the window the mouse pointer is in. If  this  option  is  set  the
              keyboard  input  stays with one window until the mouse is clicked with the pointer positioned in a
              new window.

       Cursor  <u>cursor_num</u> <u>cursor_type</u>
              This provides a very awkward way of changing cursor styles. <u>Cursor_num</u> tells which cursor you  are
              changing, and is a number between 0 and 12, as follows:

                 0 POSITION     - used when initially placing windows.
                 1 TITLE        - used in a window title-bar.
                 2 DEFAULT      - used in windows that don't set their cursor.
                 3 SYS          - used in one of the title-bar buttons.
                 4 MOVE         - used when moving or resizing windows.
                 5 WAIT         - used during an EXEC builtin command.
                 6 MENU         - used in menus.
                 7 SELECT       - used for various builtin commands such as iconify.
                 8 DESTROY      - used for DESTROY and DELETE built-ins.
                 9 TOP          - used in the top side-bar of a window.
                10 RIGHT        - used in the right side-bar of a window.
                11 BOTTOM       - used in the bottom side-bar of a window.
                12 LEFT         - used in the left side-bar of a window.
                13 TOP_LEFT     - used in the top left corner of a window.
                14 TOP_RIGHT    - used in the top right corner of a window.
                15 BOTTOM_LEFT  - used in the bottom left corner of a window.
                16 BOTTOM_RIGHT - used in the bottom right corner of a window.

              The  <u>cursor_type</u>  argument  is a number which tells the cursor shape to use. The available numbers
              can be found in /usr/include/X11/cursorfont.h and are currently even numbers between 0 and 152. At
              the current time, the following cursor types are available:

                0   X_cursor                  2   arrow
                4   based_arrow_down          6   based_arrow_up

                152 xterm

       DecorateTransients
              Causes transient windows, which are  normally  left  undecorated,  to  be  given  the  usual  <u>fvwm</u>
              decorations. Note that some pop-up windows, such as the xterm menus, are not managed by the window
              manager and still do not receive decorations.

       DeskTopScale <u>Scale</u>
              Defines the virtual desktop scale with respect to the screen.

       DeskTopSize <u>Horizontal</u>x<u>Vertical</u>
              Defines the virtual desktop size in units of the physical screen size.

       DontMoveOff
              Prevents windows from being moved off or initially placed off of the desktop.  A few programs will
              not  work correctly if you use this option. This only keeps windows from being completely lost off
              the edge of the desktop. It insists on keeping 16 pixels on the desktop but  doesn't  care  a  bit
              about  keeping  the  whole window on the desk. See EdgeResistance if you don't like having windows
              partially off the screen.

       EdgeResistance <u>scrolling</u> <u>moving</u>
              Tells how hard it should be to change the desktop viewport by moving the mouse over  the  edge  of
              the screen and how hard it should be to move a window over the edge of the screen.

              The  first  parameter tells how milliseconds the pointer must spend on the screen edge before <u>fvwm</u>
              will move the viewport. This is intended  for  people  who  use  "EdgeScroll  100  100"  but  find
              themselves accidentally flipping pages when they don't want to.

              The  second  parameter tells how many pixels over the edge of the screen a window's edge must move
              before it actually moves partially off the screen.

              Note that, with "EdgeScroll 0 0", it is still possible to move or resize windows across  the  edge
              of  the  current screen. By making the first parameter to EdgeResistance 10000 this type of motion
              is impossible. With EdgeResistance less than 10000 but greater than 0 moving  over  pages  becomes
              difficult but not impossible.

       EdgeScroll <u>horizontal</u> <u>vertical</u>
              Specifies the percentage of a page to scroll when the cursor hits the edge of a page. If you don't
              want  any  paging  or  scrolling  when you hit the edge of a page include "EdgeScroll 0 0" in your
              .fvwmrc file. If you want whole pages, use "EdgeScroll 100  100".  Both  horizontal  and  vertical
              should be positive numbers.

              If  the horizontal and vertical percentages are multiplied by 1000 then scrolling will wrap around
              at the edge of the desktop. If "EdgeScroll 100000 100000" is used <u>fvwm</u> will scroll by whole pages,
              wrapping around at the edge of the desktop.

       Font <u>fontname</u>
              Makes <u>fvwm</u> use font <u>fontname</u> instead of "fixed" for menus, the resize indicators, and icon  labels
              (if IconFont is not specified).

       Function <u>FunctionName</u>
              Starts  the  definition of a complex function, composed of the <u>fvwm</u> built-in functions, which will
              later be bound to a mouse button or key.  <u>FunctionName</u>  must  be  enclosed  in  quotes.   Function
              entries  are  included  on  lines following the Function keyword. The definition ends with the key
              word EndFunction. Function entries are specified as shown in the following example. The first word
              on each line is the built-in function which will be performed, followed the type  of  event  which
              should trigger the action (enclosed in quotes), followed by any additional arguments needed by the
              built-in  function.  Menus  can  be  specified by using the Popup built-in as long as the menu was
              defined earlier in the configuration file.

              The trigger actions which are recognized are Immediate, Motion, Click, and DoubleClick.  Immediate
              actions are executed as soon as the function is activated, even if a window has not been selected.
              If  there  are  actions  other than immediate ones, <u>fvwm</u> will wait to see if the user is clicking,
              double-clicking, or dragging the mouse. After the decision is made, <u>fvwm</u>  will  execute  only  the
              built-ins  from  the  function definition whose trigger action matches the action performed by the
              user.

              If the following example were bound to button 1 in a window title-bar,  then,  when  button  1  is
              pressed,  <u>fvwm</u> would wait 150 msec to see if the button is released. If the button is not released
              <u>fvwm</u> will start a move operation. When the move operation is complete a raise  operation  will  be
              performed.  If  a  button  release  is  detected then <u>fvwm</u> will wait another 150 msec for a second
              click. If only one click is detected then the window will be raised. If two  clicks  are  detected
              the window will be alternately raised and lowered. The 150 msec wait duration can be altered using
              the ClickTime option.
              Function "Move-or-Raise"
                  Move            "Motion"
                  Raise           "Motion"
                  Raise           "Click"
                  RaiseLower      "DoubleClick"
              EndFunction
              The clicking and double clicking concepts do not carry through to using keyboard shortcuts.

              Two  special  functions  exist:  InitFunction and RestartFunction. The InitFunction will be called
              when <u>fvwm</u> is started for the first time in any X session and can be used  to  start  modules,  set
              background  patterns,  and  begin  programs.  The  restart  function  will  be called when <u>fvwm</u> is
              restarted. It can be used to start modules and set background patterns but probably should not  be
              used to start programs.

       HiBackColor <u>colorname</u>
              Sets the background color of the selected window to <u>colorname</u>. When using a monochrome screen this
              option is ignored and white is used.

       HiForeColor <u>colorname</u>
              Sets  the  color  of the selected window's title to <u>colorname</u>. When using a monochrome screen this
              option is ignored and black is used.

       Icon <u>windowname</u> <u>bitmap-file</u>
              Specifies the bitmap to be used for a window when it is  iconified.   The  <u>windowname</u>  can  be  an
              application's  window name or class name and must be enclosed in quotes. The <u>bitmap-file</u> is either
              the full path name to a standard X11 bitmap file or a file in  the  IconPath  or  PixmapPath.  The
              specified bitmap/pixmap is used in preference to any icon supplied by the window itself.

              If <u>fvwm</u> is compiled with XPM support for color icons then <u>bitmap</u> can be an XPM pixmap file.

              <u>windowname</u>  should  be enclosed in double quotes but <u>bitmap-file</u> should not. Environment variables
              should not be used in the <u>bitmap-file</u> specification.

              If <u>windowname</u> is an empty string then the specified file is the default icon, and will be used  if
              no other icon bitmap or pixmap can be found:
              Icon "" my-favorite-icon

              The Style command provides another (more general) method for specifying Icon.

       IconBox <u>left</u> <u>top</u> <u>right</u> <u>bottom</u>
              Defines regions of the screen in which to place icons. Up to four icon boxes can be defined. If an
              IconBox line is provided then icons will automatically be placed in them, if possible. Each time a
              window  is  iconified a new place is found for it. Icon boxes are searched for space going left to
              right, then top to bottom. Icons will not be auto-placed on top of other icons  but  they  may  be
              placed underneath application windows. If <u>left</u> or <u>right</u> is negative, then <u>fvwm</u> will add the screen
              width to it. If <u>top</u> or <u>bottom</u> is negative, then <u>fvwm</u> will add the screen height to it. NOTE: -0 is
              not parsed as the right or bottom pixel on the screen. You have to use -1 instead.

              If  no  IconBox  line  is provided or all icon boxes are full, then <u>fvwm</u> will place icons near the
              current pointer location.

       IconFont <u>fontname</u>
              Makes <u>fvwm</u> use font <u>fontname</u> for icon labels. If omitted, the menu font  (specified  by  the  Font
              configuration parameter) will be used instead.

       IconPath <u>path</u>
              Specifies a colon separated list of full path names of directories where bitmap (monochrome) icons
              can  be found. Each path should start with a slash. Note: if the M4 patches are included when <u>fvwm</u>
              is built, then <u>m4</u> will want to mangle the word "include" which will  frequently  show  up  in  the
              IconPath or PixmapPath command. To fix this add undefine(`include') prior to the IconPath command.

       Key <u>keyname</u> <u>Context</u> <u>Modifiers</u> <u>Function</u>
              Binds a keyboard key to a specified <u>fvwm</u> built-in function.  Definition is the same as for a mouse
              binding except that the mouse button number is replaced with a key name. The <u>keyname</u> is one of the
              entries from /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h, with the leading XK_ omitted. The <u>Context</u> and <u>Modifiers</u>
              fields are defined as in the mouse binding.

              Binding  a  key  to a title-bar button will not cause that button to appear unless a mouse binding
              also exists.

       Lenience
              The ICCCM states that if an application sets the input field of the wm_hints structure  to  False,
              then  it  never  wants  the window manager to give it the input focus. The only application that I
              know of which needs this is sxpm, and that is a silly bug with a trivial fix and  has  no  overall
              effect on the program anyway. Rumor is that some older applications have problems too.

              If this parameter is set then <u>fvwm</u> will ignore this ICCCM convention.

       MenuBackColor <u>colorname</u>
              Sets  the menu background color. When using monochrome this option is ignored. This option is only
              available if <u>fvwm</u> is compiled with MENUCOLOR defined.

       MenuForeColor <u>colorname</u>
              Sets the menu foreground color. When using monochrome this option is ignored. This option is  only
              available if <u>fvwm</u> is compiled with MENUCOLOR defined.

       MenuStippleColor <u>colorname</u>
              Sets  the  color  for  shaded  out  entries  in  menus (for functions which are not allowed on the
              currently selected window). When using monochrome this option is ignored and a stipple pattern  is
              used.  This option is only available if <u>fvwm</u> is compiled with MENUCOLOR defined.

       Module <u>ModuleName</u>
              Specifies  a  module  which  should  be  spawned  during  initialization.  At the current time the
              available modules  are  FvwmAudio,  FvwmBacker,  FvwmBanner,  FvwmClean,  FvwmDebug,  FvwmIconBox,
              FvwmIdent,  FvwmPager,  FvwmSave,  FvwmSaveDesk,  FvwmScroll,  FvwmWinList,  and  GoodStuff. These
              modules have their own man pages.  <u>Module</u> can also be used as a built-in.  Modules  can  be  short
              lived transient programs or, like GoodStuff, can remain for the duration of the X session. Modules
              will  be  terminated  by  the  window  manager  prior  to restarts and quits, if possible. See the
              introductory section on modules.

       ModulePath
              Specifies a colon separated list of paths for <u>fvwm</u> to search when looking for a  module  to  load.
              Individual directories do not need trailing slashes.

       Mouse <u>Button</u> <u>Context</u> <u>Modifiers</u> <u>Function</u>
              Defines a mouse binding. <u>Button</u> is the mouse button number. If <u>Button</u> is zero then any button will
              perform the specified function.  <u>Context</u> describes where the binding applies. Valid contexts are R
              for  the  root window, W for an application window, T for a window title bar, S for a window side,
              top, or bottom bar, F for a window frame (the corners), I for an Icon window, or 0 through  9  for
              title-bar  buttons, or any combination of these letters. A is for any context except for title-bar
              buttons. For instance, a context of FST will apply when the mouse is anywhere in a window's border
              except the title-bar buttons.

              <u>Modifiers</u> is any combination of N for no modifiers, C for control, S for shift, M for Meta,  or  A
              for  any modifier.  For example, a modifier of SM will apply when both the Meta and shift keys are
              down. X11 modifiers mod1 through mod5 are represented as the digits 1 through 5.

              <u>Function</u> is one of <u>fvwm</u>'s built-in functions.

              The title bar buttons are numbered with odd numbered buttons on the left side of the title bar and
              even numbers on the right. Smaller-numbered buttons are displayed toward the outside of the window
              while larger-numbered buttons appear toward the middle of the window  (0  is  short  for  10).  In
              summary, the buttons are numbered:
              1 3 5 7 9    0 8 6 4 2
              The  highest  odd numbered button which has an action bound to it determines the number of buttons
              drawn on the left side of the title bar. The highest even number determines the  number  or  right
              side buttons which are drawn. Actions can be bound to either mouse buttons or keyboard keys.

       MWMBorders
              Substitutes MWM style 1 pixel wide relief lines instead of <u>fvwm</u>'s 2 pixel borders.

       MWMButtons
              Disables  button press feedback for all decorations except the title bar and title-bar buttons, as
              in MWM.

       MWMDecorHints
              Causes <u>fvwm</u> to read the MOTIF_WM_HINTS atom from application windows and to parse and  attempt  to
              replicate  the  Motif  behavior  with regard to window decorations.  Note that mwm allows function
              hints to affect window decorations but these effects are not replicated by this option.

       MWMFunctionHints
              Causes <u>fvwm</u> to read the MOTIF_WM_HINTS atom from application windows and to parse and  attempt  to
              replicate  the  Motif  behavior with regard to allowed window functions.  Unlike mwm, which simply
              removes prohibited functions from the window's  menus,  <u>fvwm</u>  simply  shades  out  the  prohibited
              functions. Also, because <u>fvwm</u> implements some functions in user defined macros that mwm implements
              internally, the mapping of prohibited functions is partially based on the menu item label.

       MWMHintOverride
              If  MWMFunctionHints  is  used  then  maximization and iconfication are prohibited for transients.
              Also, windows can specify that the window manager should not destroy or delete them.  Since  these
              MWM  rules  are  kind  of  stupid, especially with regard to the transient windows, I provide this
              MWMHintOverride option. When it is used menu items will be shaded out if MWM would prohibit  their
              use, but the user can go ahead and select that item and it will operate as expected.

              The  override should be used cautiously because some applications will break if you override their
              mwm hints.

       MWMMenus
              Substitutes MWM look and feel menus in place of the standard  <u>fvwm</u>  versions.   This  option  also
              triggers  a  few  other mwm-style options, such as centering the size/resize window on the screen,
              instead of leaving it in the upper left,  and  switches  the  resize-on-initial-placement  trigger
              action to shift-button-1 instead of the <u>twm</u> style press-button-2

       NoBorder <u>windowname</u>
              Keeps <u>fvwm</u> from putting decorative borders on windows named <u>windowname</u>. This command has no effect
              on the title-bar.  This is handy for clocks and similar gadgets that you don't want to take up too
              much space. <u>windowname</u> can be a window's name or its class.

              If you specify both NoBorder <u>windowname</u> and NoTitle <u>windowname</u> for the same window in your .fvwmrc
              file the window will be completely undecorated.

              <u>Windowname</u>  can  contain  the  wildcards  "*"  and "?" which match window names in the normal Unix
              filename matching manner. Actual "*", "?", and "\" characters in a window name can be  entered  by
              preceding the character with a "\".

              The Style command provides another (more general) method for specifying NoBorder.

       NoBoundaryWidth <u>Width</u>
              Changes the width of the decorations for windows with no titles and no borders.  The default is 1.
              Any positive or zero value is acceptable.  Decorations for these undecorated windows have the same
              context as the side-bars on normally decorated windows.

              The Style command provides another (more general) method for specifying NoBoundaryWidth.

       NoPPosition
              Instructs  <u>fvwm</u> to ignore the PPosition field when adding new windows.  Adherence to the PPosition
              field is required for some applications, but if you don't have one of those its a real headache.

       NoTitle <u>windowname</u>
              Keeps <u>fvwm</u> from putting a title-bar in the decorations for windows named <u>windowname</u>. This is handy
              for clocks and similar gadgets that you don't want to take up too much space. <u>windowname</u> can be  a
              window's name or its class.

              <u>Windowname</u>  can  contain  the  wildcards  "*"  and "?" which match window names in the normal Unix
              filename matching manner. Actual "*", "?", and "\" characters in a window name can be  entered  by
              preceding the character with a "\".

              The Style command provides another (more general) method for specifying NoTitle.

       OpaqueMove <u>percentage</u>
              Tells  <u>fvwm</u>  the  maximum  size  window  with  which  opaque  window  movement should be used. The
              percentage is percent of the total screen area. With "OpaqueMove 0"  all  windows  will  be  moved
              using the traditional rubber-band outline. With "OpaqueMove 100" all windows will be move as solid
              windows. The default is "OpaqueMove 5", which allows small windows to be moved in an opaque manner
              but large windows are moved as rubber-bands.

       OpaqueResize
              Causes resize operations to be done with the window itself instead of an outline.

       Pager  <u>X_Location</u> <u>Y_Location</u>
              Enables  a paging style of moving across the desktop. A Pager window (not a pop-up) will appear at
              (X_Location, Y_Location). Miniature versions of all the non-sticky windows on the virtual  desktop
              are  shown in the pager.  The color of the miniature version is the same as the color of the full-
              size window's border.

              In the Pager window, pressing mouse button 1 will move the desktop viewport to the  selected  page
              (in  click-to-focus  mode;  it will also move the keyboard focus to the window whose miniature you
              click on).  Pressing button 2 on a window in the  pager  will  begin  a  window  move,  using  the
              miniature  to  quickly  move  the window anywhere on the desktop.  Pressing button 3 will move the
              top-left corner of the viewport to the location of the button press, even if it does not  line  up
              with  a  page.   Dragging  button  3  will  cause  the selected viewport to scroll as you move the
              pointer. The Pager is automatically sticky but does not automatically stay on top.

       PagerForeColor <u>colorname</u>
              Causes the pager foreground color to be <u>colorname</u> instead of black.  This is  the  color  used  to
              highlight  the  current  viewport  in  the  pager  window.   On a monochrome screen this option is
              ignored. If the NO_PAGER option is set when building <u>fvwm</u> this option is unavailable.

       PagerBackColor <u>colorname</u>
              Causes the pager background color to be <u>colorname</u> instead of white.  On a monochrome  screen  this
              option is ignored. If the NO_PAGER option is set when building <u>fvwm</u> this option is unavailable.

       PagerFont <u>fontname</u>
              Makes  <u>fvwm</u>  use font <u>fontname</u> for writing window icon names in the window's representation in the
              pager. If this option is omitted no names are written in the pager windows.

       PagingDefault <u>pagingdefaultvalue</u>
              Tells <u>fvwm</u> if it should start up with paging enabled or disabled.  "PagingDefault  0"  will  start
              <u>fvwm</u> with paging disabled; "PagingDefault 1" will start <u>fvwm</u> with paging enabled by default.

       PixmapPath <u>path</u>
              Specifies  a colon separated list of full path names of directories where pixmap (color) icons can
              be found. Each path should start with a slash.

       Popup <u>PopupName</u>
              Starts the definition of a pop-up menu which will later  be  bound  to  a  mouse  button  or  key.
              <u>PopupName</u>  must  be  enclosed  in  quotes.  Menu entries are included on lines following the Popup
              keyword. The menu definition ends with the key word EndPopup. Menu entries are specified as  shown
              in  the  following  example.   The  first word on each line is the built-in function which will be
              performed, followed by the caption (enclosed in quotes) which will be shown in the menu,  followed
              by  any  additional arguments needed by the built-in function. Sub-menus can be specified by using
              the Popup built-in as long as the sub-menu was defined earlier in the configuration file.
              Popup "Window Ops"
                  Title   "Window Ops"
                  Move    "Move"
                  Resize  "Resize"
                  Raise   "Raise"
                  Lower   "Lower"
                  Iconify "(De)Iconify"
                  Nop    " "
                  Destroy "Destroy"
                  Title   "HARDCOPY"
                  Exec    "Hardcopy"  exec xdpr &amp;
                  Exec    "Hardcopy RV"  exec xdpr -rv &amp;
              EndMenu
              Note that if a tab character is embedded in the caption of a menu entry then  the  text  following
              the  tab  will  be  entered  into  a  second  column in the menu and the entire menu will be left-
              adjusted. This is intended for shortcut labeling. The tab character must really be a tab. If it is
              expanded into spaces it will not work! For example:
              Popup "Window Ops"
                  Title   "Window Ops Alt-F1"
                  .
                  .
                  .
              Is the start of a left adjusted menu. Alt-F1 will be placed toward the right side of the menu.

              Shortcut keys may be specified  in  the  menu  definition  by  preceding  the  character  with  an
              ampersand.   The  ampersand  will  not  be  displayed but the character after it will be displayed
              underlined, and if the user presses the corresponding key then that item will be activated  as  if
              the  user had clicked on it with the mouse.  Only alphabetic and numeric characters may be used as
              shortcut keys.  The shift state of the keyboard is ignored when testing shortcut  characters.  For
              example:
              Popup "Window Ops"
                  Maximize "Ma&amp;ximise" 100 100
              EndMenu
              When  this  menu  is  popped up the 'x' will be underlined and pressing the 'x' key will cause the
              current window to be maximized. Shortcut keys are not operative unless  MENU_HOTKEYS  was  defined
              when  building <u>fvwm</u>.  If WINDOWLIST_HOTKEYS was also defined then hot keys are automatically added
              to the WindowList when it is displayed.

       RandomPlacement
              Causes windows which would normally require user placement to be automatically placed in  ever-so-
              slightly  random  locations.   For  the  best  of all possible worlds use both RandomPlacement and
              SmartPlacement.

       SaveUnders
              Causes the <u>fvwm</u> decoration frames to request  save-unders.  This  can  significantly  improve  the
              performance during opaque moves but it causes a significant increase in memory usage.

       SloppyFocus
              This  focusing  mode  is  like focus-follows-mouse (the default) except that the focus will not be
              removed from a window until your mouse enters a new window. Exiting a window  to  enter  the  root
              window will leave the focus unchanged.

       SmartPlacement
              Causes  windows  which would normally require user placement to be automatically placed in a smart
              location - a location in which they do not overlap any other windows on the  screen.  If  no  such
              position  can be found user placement or random placement will be used as a fall-back method.  For
              the best of all possible worlds use both RandomPlacement and SmartPlacement.

       StartsOnDesk <u>windowname</u> <u>desk-number</u>
              This command causes windows whose name or class is <u>windowname</u> to be initially  placed  on  desktop
              number  <u>desk-number</u>.   <u>windowname</u>  should  be  enclosed  in  double quotes. If the window requires
              interactive placement, an outline will be displayed on the current desk but the window will appear
              on the specified desk.

              <u>Windowname</u> can contain the wildcards "*" and "?" which match  window  names  in  the  normal  Unix
              filename  matching  manner. Actual "*", "?", and "\" characters in a window name can be entered by
              preceding the character with a "\".

              The Style command provides another (more general) method for specifying StartsOnDesk.

       StaysOnTop <u>windowname</u>
              These  windows always try to stay on top of the other windows. This might be handy for  clocks  or
              mailboxes  that  you  would always like to be visible. If the window is explicitly lowered it will
              not try to force its way back to the top until it  is  explicitly  raised.  <u>windowname</u>  can  be  a
              window's name or its class.

              <u>Windowname</u>  can  contain  the  wildcards  "*"  and "?" which match window names in the normal Unix
              filename matching manner. Actual "*", "?", and "\" characters in a window name can be  entered  by
              preceding the character with a "\".

              The Style command provides another (more general) method for specifying StaysOnTop.

       StdBackColor <u>colorname</u>
              Sets the background color for menus and non-selected windows to <u>colorname</u>. When using a monochrome
              screen this option is ignored and white is used.

              The Style command provides another (more general) method for specifying StdBackColor.

       StdForeColor <u>colorname</u>
              Sets  the  foreground  color  for  menus and non-selected window titles to <u>colorname</u>. When using a
              monochrome screen this option is ignored and black is used.

              The Style command provides another (more general) method for specifying StdForeColor.

       StickyBackColor <u>colorname</u>
              Sets the background color for non-selected sticky windows to <u>colorname</u>. When  using  a  monochrome
              screen  this  option  is  ignored  and white is used. Only available if -DMORE_COLORS is used when
              compiling.

       StickyForeColor <u>colorname</u>
              Sets the foreground color for non-selected  sticky  window  titles  to  <u>colorname</u>.  When  using  a
              monochrome  screen  this  option  is ignored and black is used. Only available if -DMORE_COLORS is
              used when compiling.

       Sticky <u>windowname</u>
              Sticky windows "stick to the screen's glass." That is, they don't move the the viewport  into  the
              virtual desktop changes.  <u>windowname</u> can be a window's name or its class.

              <u>Windowname</u>  can  contain  the  wildcards  "*"  and "?" which match window names in the normal Unix
              filename matching manner. Actual "*", "?", and "\" characters in a window name can be  entered  by
              preceding the character with a "\".

              The Style command provides another (more general) method for specifying Sticky.

       StickyIcons
              Causes  icons  to  always stick to the screen's glass. That is, icons always follow you around the
              desktop. When a window is de-iconified it gets un-stuck. Some people find this  a  useful  way  of
              moving windows around.

       StubbornIcons
              Changes de-iconification behavior a bit. Instead of having windows always de-iconify themselves on
              the current page they de-iconify into their original position.

       StubbornIconPlacement
              When used with IconBoxes, causes icons to avoid placing themselves underneath existing windows.

       StubbornPlacement
              When using SmartPlacement, causes new windows to avoid placing themselves over icons.

       Style <u>windowname</u> <u>options</u>
              This  command  is  intended  to  replace  the  commands  NoBorder,  NoTitle, StartsOnDesk, Sticky,
              StaysOnTop, Icon, WindowListSkip, CirculateSkip,  SuppressIcons,  BoundaryWidth,  NoBoundaryWidth,
              StdForeColor,  and StdBackColor with a single flexible and comprehensive command.  This command is
              used to set attributes of a window to values other than the default or to set the  window  manager
              default styles.

              <u>windowname</u>  can  be  a  window's  name,  class, or resource string. It can contain the wildcards *
              and/or ?, which are matched in the usual Unix filename manner.

              <u>options</u>  is  a  comma  separated  list  containing  some  or  all  of  the  keywords  BorderWidth,
              HandleWidth,NoIcon/Icon,     NoTitle/Title,    NoHandles/Handles,    WindowListSkip/WindowListHit,
              CirculateSkip/CirculateHit, StaysOnTop/StaysPut, Sticky/Slippery, StartIconic/StartNormal,  Color,
              ForeColor, BackColor, StartsOnDesk/StartsAnyWhere, IconTitle/NoIconTitle, and NoButton/Button.

              In  the  above  list  some options are listed as style-option/opposite-style-option. The opposite-
              style-option for entries that have them describes the <u>fvwm</u> default behavior and can be used if you
              want to change the <u>fvwm</u> default behavior.

              Icon takes an (optional) unquoted string argument which is the icon bitmap or pixmap to use.

              StartsOnDesk takes a numeric argument which is the desktop number on which the  window  should  be
              initially placed.

              BorderWidth  takes  a  numeric argument which is the width of the border to place the window if it
              does not have resize-handles.

              HandleWidth takes a numeric argument which is the width of the border to place the  window  if  it
              does have resize-handles.

              Button  and  NoButton take a numeric argument which is the number of the title-bar button which is
              to be included/omitted.

              Color takes two arguments. The first is the window-label text color and the second is  the  window
              decoration's  normal background color.  The two colors are separated with a slash. If the use of a
              slash causes problems then the separate ForeColor and BackColor options can be used.

              An example:
              # Change default fvwm behavior to no title-bars on windows!
              # Also define a default icon.
              Style "*" NoTitle,Icon unknown1.xpm, BorderWidth 4,HandleWidth 5

              # now, window specific changes:
              Style "Fvwm*"     NoHandles,Sticky,WindowListSkip,BorderWidth 0
              Style "Fvwm Pager"                 StaysOnTop, BorderWidth 0
              Style "*lock"     NoHandles,Sticky,StaysOnTop,WindowListSkip
              Style "xbiff"               Sticky,           WindowListSkip
              Style "GoodStuff" NoHandles,Sticky,WindowListSkip
              Style "sxpm"      NoHandles
              Style "makerkit"

              # Put title-bars back on xterms only!
              Style "xterm"     Title, Color black/grey

              Style "rxvt"      Icon term.xpm
              Style "xterm"     Icon rterm.xpm
              Style "xcalc"     Icon xcalc.xpm
              Style "xbiff"     Icon mail1.xpm
              Style "xmh"       Icon mail1.xpm, StartsOnDesk 2
              Style "xman"      Icon xman.xpm
              Style "matlab"    Icon math4.xpm, StartsOnDesk 3
              Style "xmag"      Icon magnifying_glass2.xpm
              Style "xgraph"    Icon graphs.xpm
              Style "GoodStuff" Icon toolbox.xpm

              Style "Maker"     StartsOnDesk 1
              Style "signal"    StartsOnDesk 3
              Note  that  all  properties  for a window will be OR'ed together. In the above example "FvwmPager"
              gets the property StaysOnTop via an exact window name match but also gets NoHandles,  Sticky,  and
              WindowListSkip  by  a  match  to  "Fvwm*".  It  will  get  NoTitle by virtue of a match to "*". If
              conflicting styles are specified for a window, then the last style specified will be used.

              If the NoIcon attribute is set then  the  specified  window  will  simply  disappear  when  it  is
              iconified. The window can be recovered through the window-list. If Icon is set without an argument
              then  the  NoIcon  attribute is cleared but no icon is specified. An example which allows only the
              FvwmPager module icon to exist:
              Style "*" NoIcon
              Style "Fvwm Pager" Icon

       SuppressIcons
              Prevents icon windows from being created or drawn. When used with the window-list this provides  a
              sort of icon manager.

              The Style command provides another (more general) method for specifying SuppressIcons.

       WindowFont <u>fontname</u>
              Makes <u>fvwm</u> use font <u>fontname</u> instead of "fixed" for the window title bar.

       WindowListSkip <u>windowname</u>
              Causes windows with the indicated name to be left out of the window list.

              <u>Windowname</u>  can  contain  the  wildcards  "*"  and "?" which match window names in the normal Unix
              filename matching manner. Actual "*", "?", and "\" characters in a window name can be  entered  by
              preceding the character with a "\".

              The Style command provides another (more general) method for specifying WindowListSkip.

       XORvalue <u>number</u>
              Changes  the  value  with  which bits are XOR'ed when doing rubber-band window moving or resizing.
              Setting this value is a trial-and-error process.

</pre><h4><b>BUILT</b> <b>IN</b> <b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Fvwm</u> supports a set of built-in functions which can be bound to keyboard or mouse buttons:

       Beep   Makes the computer beep.

       CirculateDown [ <u>name</u> <u>window_name</u> ]
              Causes the pointer to move to the next window in the list of windows for which  CirculateSkip  has
              not not been specified.

              If the optional arguments are supplied then the focus will move to the first window whose name (or
              icon name or class) matches <u>window_name</u>.  The optional argument <u>name</u> is required if <u>window_name</u> is
              supplied  and  is  enclosed  in  quotes.  This  argument is the name which appears in menus if the
              function is called from a menu, but serves no purpose if the function is not called from a menu.

       CirculateUp [ <u>name</u> <u>window_name</u> ]
              Causes the pointer to move to the previous window in the list of windows for  which  CirculateSkip
              has not not been specified.

              If the optional arguments are supplied then the focus will move to the first window whose name (or
              icon name or class) matches <u>window_name</u>.  The optional argument <u>name</u> is required if <u>window_name</u> is
              supplied  and  is  enclosed  in  quotes.  This  argument is the name which appears in menus if the
              function is called from a menu, but serves no purpose if the function is not called from a menu

              Here's an example that move the focus to an xterm window when Alt-F1 is pressed:
              Key F1 A M CirculateUp "whatever" xterm

       Close  If the window accepts the delete window protocol a message is sent to  the  window  asking  it  to
              gracefully  remove  itself.  If the window does not understand the delete window protocol then the
              window is destroyed.

       CursorMove <u>horizonal</u> <u>vertical</u>
              Moves the mouse pointer by <u>horizontal</u> pages in the  X  direction  and  <u>vertical</u>  pages  in  the  Y
              direction.  Either  or  both  entries  may  be  negative.  Both horizontal and vertical values are
              expressed in percent of pages, so "CursorMove 100 100" means to move down and  left  by  one  full
              page.  "CursorMove  50  25"  means  to  move  left  half  a page and down a quarter of a page. The
              CursorMove function should not be called from pop-up menus.

       Delete Sends a message to a window asking that it remove itself, frequently causing  the  application  to
              exit.

       Desk <u>arg1</u> <u>arg2</u>
              Changes to another desktop (workspace, room).

              If  <u>arg1</u>  is  non  zero then the next desktop number will be the current desktop number plus <u>arg1</u>.
              Desktop numbers can be negative.

              If <u>arg1</u> is zero then the new desktop number will be <u>arg2</u>.

              The number of active desktops is determined dynamically. Only desktops which  contain  windows  or
              are  currently  being  displayed  are  active.  Desktop  numbers  must  be  between 2147483647 and
              -2147483648 (is that enough?).

       Destroy
              Destroys a window. Guaranteed to get rid of the window, but is a fairly violent way  to  terminate
              an application.

       Exec <u>name</u> <u>command</u>
              Executes  <u>command</u>. <u>command</u> is not quoted but <u>name</u> is.  <u>name</u> is the name that appears in a menu, if
              that is where the function is called from. <u>name</u> is required even if the  function  is  not  called
              from a menu.

              The  following  example  binds  function key F1 in the root window, with no modifiers, to the exec
              function. The program rxvt will be started with an assortment of options.
              Key F1 R N Exec "rxvt" exec rxvt -fg yellow -bg blue -e /bin/tcsh &amp;

       Focus  Moves the viewport or window as needed to make the selected window  visible.   Sets  the  keyboard
              focus  to  the selected window.  Raises the window if needed to make it visible. Warps the pointer
              into the selected window in focus-follows-mouse mode.   Does  not  de-iconify.  This  function  is
              primarily for use with a module such as  FvwmWinList.

       Function
              Used to bind a previously defined function to a key or mouse button.

              The  following example binds mouse button 1 to a function called "Move-or-Raise", whose definition
              was provided as an example earlier in this man page.  After  performing  this  binding  <u>fvwm</u>  will
              execute to move-or-raise function whenever button 1 is pressed in a window title-bar.
              Mouse 1 T A Function "Move-or-Raise"

       GotoPage  x y
              Moves  the desktop viewport to page (x,y). The upper left page is (0,0), the upper right is (N,0),
              where N is one less than the current number of  horizontal  pages  specified  in  the  DeskTopSize
              command. The lower left page is (0,M), and the lower right page is (N,M), where M is the desktop's
              vertical size as specified in the DeskTopSize command. The GotoPage function should not be used in
              a pop-up menu.

       Iconify [ <u>value</u> ]
              Iconifies  a  window if it is not already iconified or de-iconifies it if it is already iconified.
              If the optional argument <u>value</u> is positive the only iconification will be allowed. It the optional
              argument is negative only de-iconification will be allowed.

       Lower  Allows the user to lower a window.

       Maximize [  <u>horizontal</u> <u>vertical</u> ]
              Without its optional arguments Maximize causes the window to alternately switch from a full-screen
              size to its normal size.

              With the optional arguments horizontal and vertical, which are expressed as percentage of  a  full
              screen,  the user can control the new size of the window. If horizontal is greater than 0 then the
              horizontal dimension of the window  will  be  set  to  horizontal*screen_width/100.  The  vertical
              resizing is similar.  For example, the following will add a title-bar button to switch a window to
              the full vertical size of the screen:
              Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 0 100
              The following causes windows to be stretched to the full width:
              Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 100 0
              This makes a window that is half the screen size in each direction:
              Mouse 0 4 A Maximize 50 50
              Values larger than 100 can be used with caution.

              If  the  letter  "p"  is appended to each coordinate (horizontal and/or vertical), then the scroll
              amount will be measured in pixels.

       Module <u>name</u> <u>ModuleName</u>
              Specifies a module which should be spawned. Modules can be short lived transient programs  or  can
              remain  for  the duration of the X session. Modules will be terminated by the window manager prior
              to restarts and quits, if possible.  <u>name</u> is  a  double-qouted  string  which  has  absolutely  no
              significance, but must exist.

       Move [ <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ]
              Allows  the  user  to move a window. If called from somewhere in a window or its border, then that
              window will be moved. If called from the root window then the user will be allowed to  select  the
              target window.

              If  the  optional  arguments x and y are provided, then the window will be moved so that its upper
              left corner is at  location (x,y). The units of x and y are percent-of-screen, unless a letter "p"
              is appended to each coordinate, in which case the location is specified in pixels.

              Examples:
              Mouse 1 T A Move
              Mouse 2 T A Move 10 10
              Mouse 3 T A Move 10p 10p
              In the first example, an interactive move is indicated. In the second, the window whose  title-bar
              is  selected will be moved so that its upper left hand corner is 10 percent of the screen width in
              from the left of the screen, and 10 percent down from the top. The final example moves the  window
              to coordinate (10,10) pixels.

       Nop    Does  nothing.  This  is  used  to  insert  a  blank line or separator in a menu. If the menu item
              specification is Nop " ", then a blank line is inserted. If it looks like Nop "", then a separator
              line is inserted.

       Popup  This built-in has two purposes: to bind a menu to a key or mouse button, and to  bind  a  sub-menu
              into a menu.  The formats for the two purposes differ slightly.

              To bind a previously defined pop-up menu to a key or mouse button:

                The  following  example  binds  mouse  buttons  2  and  3 to a pop-up called "Window Ops", whose
                definition was provided as an example earlier in this man page.  The menu will  pop  up  if  the
                buttons  2 or 3 are pressed in the window frame, side-bar, or title-bar, with no modifiers (none
                of shift, control, or meta).
                Mouse 2 FST N Popup "Window Ops"
                Mouse 3 FST N Popup "Window Ops"
                Pop-ups can be bound to keys through the use of  the  key  modifier.  Pop-ups  can  be  operated
                without using the mouse by binding to keys and operating via the up arrow, down arrow, and enter
                keys.

              To bind a previously defined pop-up menu to another menu, for use as a sub-menu:

                The  following  example  defines a sub menu, "Quit-Verify" and binds it into a main menu, called
                "Utilities":
                Popup "Quit-Verify"
                    Title   "Really Quit Fvwm?"
                    Quit    "Yes, Really Quit"
                    Restart "Restart Fvwm" fvwm
                    Nop     ""
                    Nop     "No, Don't Quit"
                EndPopup

                Popup "Utilities"
                    Title   "Utilities"
                    Exec    "Xterm"         exec xterm &amp;
                    Exec    "Rxvt"          exec rxvt &amp;
                    Exec    "Top"           exec rxvt -T Top -n Top -e top &amp;
                    Exec    "Calculator"    exec xcalc &amp;
                    Exec    "Xman"          exec xman &amp;
                    Exec    "Xmag"          exec xmag &amp;
                    Nop     ""
                    Popup   "Exit Fvwm"     Quit-Verify
                EndPopup
                Sub-menus must be defined prior to the main menu in which they are bound.  Sub-menu nesting  can
                be arbitrarily deep.

       Quit   Exits <u>fvwm</u>, generally causing X to exit too.

       Raise  Allows the user to raise a window.

       RaiseLower
              Alternately raises and lowers a window.

       Refresh
              Causes all windows on the screen to redraw themselves.

       Resize [ <u>x</u> <u>y</u> ]
              Allows the user to resize a window.

              If  the  optional  arguments x and y are provided, then the window will be moved so that its upper
              left corner is at  location (x,y). The units of x and y are percent-of-screen, unless a letter "p"
              is appended to each coordinate, in which case the location is specified in pixels.

       Restart  <u>name</u> <u>WindowManagerName</u>
              Causes <u>fvwm</u> to restart itself if WindowManagerName is "fvwm", or to switch to an alternate  window
              manager  if  WindowManagerName is other than "fvwm".  If the window manager is not in your default
              search path, then you should use the full path name for <u>WindowManagerName</u>.

              <u>WindowManagerName</u>  is not quoted but <u>name</u> is.  <u>name</u> is the name that appears in a menu, if that is
              where the function is called from. <u>name</u> is required even if the function  is  not  called  from  a
              menu.

              This  command  should  not  have a trailing ampersand or any command line arguments and should not
              make use of any environmental variables. Of the following  examples,  the  first  three  are  sure
              losers, but the third is OK:
              Key F1 R N Restart " " fvwm &amp;
              Key F1 R N Restart " " $(HOME)/bin/fvwm
              Key F1 R N Restart " " twm -f .mystartupfile
              Key F1 R N Restart " " /home/nation/bin/fvwm

       Stick  Makes a window sticky if it is not already sticky, or non-sticky if it is already sticky.

       Scroll <u>horizonal</u> <u>vertical</u>
              Scrolls  the  virtual desktop's viewport by <u>horizontal</u> pages in the x-direction and <u>vertical</u> pages
              in the y-direction. Either or both entries may be negative. Both horizontal  and  vertical  values
              are  expressed  in percent of pages, so "Scroll 100 100" means to scroll down and left by one full
              page. "Scroll 50 25" means to scroll left half a page and down a quarter of  a  page.  The  scroll
              function  should  not  be  called from pop-up menus. Normally, scrolling stops at the  edge of the
              desktop.

              If the horizontal and vertical percentages are multiplied by 1000 then scrolling will wrap  around
              at  the  edge of the desktop. If "Scroll 100000 0" is executed over and over <u>fvwm</u> will move to the
              next desktop page on each execution and will wrap around at the edge of the desktop, so that every
              page is hit in turn.

              If the letter "p" is appended to each coordinate (horizontal and/or  vertical),  then  the  scroll
              amount will be measured in pixels.

       Title  Does nothing. This is used to insert a title line in a popup or menu.

       TogglePage
              Temporarily disables edge scrolling. Edge scrolling can be re-enabled by calling this again.

       Wait <u>name</u>
              This  built-in is intended to be used in <u>fvwm</u> functions only. It causes execution of a function to
              pause until a new window name <u>name</u> appears. <u>Fvwm</u> remains fully functional during a wait.  This  is
              particularly useful in the InitFunction if you are trying to start windows on specific desktops:
              Function "InitFunction"
                   Exec "I"  exec xterm -geometry 80x64+0+0
                   Wait "I"  xterm
                   Desk "I"  0 2
                   Exec "I"  exec xmh -font fixed -geometry 507x750+0+0 &amp;
                   Wait "I"  xmh
                   Desk      "I"  0 0
              EndFunction
              The  above function starts an xterm on the current desk, waits for it to map itself, then switches
              to desk 2 and starts an xmh. After the xmh window appears control moves to desk 0.

       Warp [ <u>name</u> <u>window_name</u> ]
              Same as CirculateDown but de-iconifies any iconified windows as it focuses on them.

       WindowsDesk <u>new_desk</u>
              Moves the selected window the the desktop specified as <u>new_desk</u>.

       WindowList <u>arg1</u> <u>arg2</u>
              Generates a pop-up menu (and pops it up) in which the title and geometry of each  of  the  windows
              currently  on  the  desk  top  are  shown. The geometry of iconified windows is shown in brackets.
              Selecting an item from the window list pop-up menu will cause that window to  be  moved  onto  the
              desktop  if  it  is currently not on it, will move the desktop viewport to the page containing the
              upper left hand corner of the window, will de-iconify the window if  it  is  iconified,  and  will
              raise the window.

              If  <u>arg1</u>  is  an  even number then the windows will be listed using the window name (the name that
              shows up in the title-bar). If it is odd then the window's icon name is used.

              If <u>arg1</u> is less than 2 then all windows on all desktops (except  those  listed  in  WindowListSkip
              directives) will be shown.

              If <u>arg1</u> is 2 or 3 then only windows on the current desktop will be shown.

              If <u>arg1</u> is 4 or 5 then only windows on desktop number <u>arg2</u> will be shown.

</pre><h4><b>KEYBOARD</b> <b>SHORTCUTS</b></h4><pre>
       All  (I think) window manager operations can be performed from the keyboard so mouseless operation should
       be possible. In addition to scrolling around the virtual  desktop  by  binding  the  Scroll  built-in  to
       appropriate  keys,  pop-ups, move, resize, and most other built-ins can be bound to keys. Once a built-in
       function is started the pointer is moved by using the up, down, left, and right arrows, and the action is
       terminated by pressing return.  Holding down the shift key will cause  the  pointer  movement  to  go  in
       larger  steps  and  holding  down  the control key will cause the cursor movement to go in smaller steps.
       Standard emacs and vi cursor movement controls (^n, ^p, ^f, ^b, and ^j, ^k, ^h, ^l) can be  used  instead
       of the arrow keys.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPLIED</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       A  sample configuration file, system.fvwmrc, is supplied with the <u>fvwm</u> distribution. It is well commented
       and can be used as a source of examples for <u>fvwm</u> configuration.

</pre><h4><b>USE</b> <b>ON</b> <b>MULTI-SCREEN</b> <b>DISPLAYS</b></h4><pre>
       If the -s command line argument is not given, <u>fvwm</u> will automatically start up on  every  screen  on  the
       specified  display.  After  <u>fvwm</u> starts each screen is treated independently. Restarts of <u>fvwm</u> need to be
       performed separately on each screen. The use of EdgeScroll 0 0 is strongly recommended  for  multi-screen
       displays.

       You may need to quit on each screen to quit from the X session completely.

       Multi-screen support is only available if <u>fvwm</u> is compiled with -DMULTIPLE_SCREENS

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       As  of  fvwm  0.99  there  were exactly 39.342 unidentified bugs. Identified bugs have mostly been fixed,
       though. Since then 9.34 bugs have been fixed.  Assuming that there are at least 10 unidentified bugs  for
       every  identified  one,  that leaves us with 39.342 - 9.32 + 10 * 9.34 = 123.402 unidentified bugs. If we
       follow this to its logical conclusion we will have an infinite number of  unidentified  bugs  before  the
       number  of  bugs  can  start  to  diminish, at which point the program will be bug-free.  Since this is a
       computer program infinity = 3.4028e+38 if you don't insist on double-precision. At the  current  rate  of
       bug  discovery we should expect to achieve this point in 3.37e+27 years. I guess I better plan on passing
       this thing on to my children....

       Binding a key to a window decoration but not to the window itself is discouraged because  when  the  key-
       press  event  finally  gets  to  the  window  it  will be marked as SYNTHETIC and will be ignored by many
       applications.

       Bug reports can be sent to <a href="mailto:fvwm@wonderland.org">fvwm@wonderland.org</a>.
