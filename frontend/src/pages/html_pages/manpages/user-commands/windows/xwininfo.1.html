       xwininfo - window information utility for X

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xwininfo</b>  [-help] [-id <u>wdid</u>] [-root] [-name <u>wdname</u>] [-int] [-children] [-tree] [-stats] [-bits] [-events]
       [-size] [-wm] [-shape] [-frame] [-all] [-english] [-metric] [-display <u>host:dpy</u>] [-version]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xwininfo</u> is a utility for  displaying  information  about  windows.   Various  information  is  displayed
       depending on which options are selected.  If no options are chosen, <b>-stats</b> is assumed.

       The  user  has  the option of selecting the target window with the mouse (by clicking any mouse button in
       the desired window) or by specifying its window id on the command line with the <b>-id</b> option.   Or  instead
       of  specifying  the  window  by  its  id  number, the <b>-name</b> option may be used to specify which window is
       desired by name.  There is also a special <b>-root</b> option to quickly obtain information on the screen's root
       window.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-help</b>   Print out the `Usage:' command syntax summary.

       <b>-id</b> <u>wdid</u>
               This option allows the user to specify a target window <u>wdid</u> on the command line rather than using
               the mouse to select the target window.  This is very useful in debugging X applications where the
               target window is not mapped to the screen or where the use of the mouse might  be  impossible  or
               interfere with the application.

       <b>-name</b> <u>wdname</u>
               This  option  allows the user to specify that the window named <u>wdname</u> is the target window on the
               command line rather than using the mouse to select the target window.

       <b>-root</b>   This option specifies that X's root window is the target window.  This is  useful  in  situations
               where the root window is completely obscured.

       <b>-int</b>    This  option  specifies that all X window ids should be displayed as integer values.  The default
               is to display them as hexadecimal values.

       <b>-children</b>
               This option causes the root, parent, and children windows' ids and names of the  selected  window
               to be displayed.

       <b>-tree</b>   This option is like <b>-children</b> but displays all children recursively.

       <b>-stats</b>  This option causes the display of various attributes pertaining to the location and appearance of
               the  selected  window.   Information displayed includes the location of the window, its width and
               height, its depth, border width, visual id and class, colormap id if  any,  map  state,  backing-
               store hint, and location of the corners.

       <b>-bits</b>   This option causes the display of various attributes pertaining to the selected window's raw bits
               and  how  the  selected  window  is  to  be  stored.  Displayed information includes the selected
               window's bit gravity, window gravity, backing-store hint, backing-planes  value,  backing  pixel,
               and whether or not the window has save-under set.

       <b>-events</b> This  option  causes  the  selected window's event masks to be displayed.  Both the event mask of
               events wanted by some client and the event mask of events not to propagate are displayed.

       <b>-size</b>   This option causes the selected window's sizing hints to  be  displayed.   Displayed  information
               includes:  for  both the normal size hints and the zoom size hints, the user supplied location if
               any; the program supplied location if any; the user supplied size if any;  the  program  supplied
               size  if any; the minimum size if any; the maximum size if any; the resize increments if any; and
               the minimum and maximum aspect ratios if any.

       <b>-wm</b>     This option causes the selected window's window  manager  hints  to  be  displayed.   Information
               displayed may include whether or not the application accepts input, what the window's icon window
               # and name is, where the window's icon should go, and what the window's initial state should be.

       <b>-shape</b>  This option causes the selected window's window and border shape extents to be displayed.

       <b>-frame</b>  This option causes window manager frames to be considered when manually selecting windows.

       <b>-metric</b> This  option  causes  all  individual  height,  width,  and  x and y positions to be displayed in
               millimeters as well as number of pixels, based on what  the  server  thinks  the  resolution  is.
               Geometry specifications that are in <b>+x+y</b> form are not changed.

       <b>-english</b>
               This  option causes all individual height, width, and x and y positions to be displayed in inches
               (and feet, yards, and miles if necessary) as well as number of pixels. <b>-metric</b> and  <b>-english</b>  may
               both be enabled at the same time.

       <b>-all</b>    This option is a quick way to ask for all information possible.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>-display</b> <u>host:dpy</u>
               This option allows you to specify the server to connect to; see <u><a href="../man7/X.7.html">X</a>(7)</u>.

       <b>-version</b>
               This option indicates that <u>xwininfo</u> should print its version information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       The following is a sample summary taken with no options specified:

       xwininfo: Window id: 0x60000f "xterm"

         Absolute upper-left X: 2
         Absolute upper-left Y: 85
         Relative upper-left X:  0
         Relative upper-left Y:  25
         Width: 579
         Height: 316
         Depth: 8
         Visual: 0x1e
         Visual Class: PseudoColor
         Border width: 0
         Class: InputOutput
         Colormap: 0x27 (installed)
         Bit Gravity State: NorthWestGravity
         Window Gravity State: NorthWestGravity
         Backing Store State: NotUseful
         Save Under State: no
         Map State: IsViewable
         Override Redirect State: no
         Corners:  +2+85  -699+85  -699-623  +2-623
         -geometry 80x24+0+58

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b> To get the default host and display number.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man7/X.7.html">X</a></u>(7), <u><a href="../man1/xprop.1.html">xprop</a></u>(1), <u><a href="../man1/xdpyinfo.1.html">xdpyinfo</a></u>(1), <u><a href="../man1/xdriinfo.1.html">xdriinfo</a></u>(1), <u><a href="../man1/xvinfo.1.html">xvinfo</a></u>(1), <u><a href="../man1/glxinfo.1.html">glxinfo</a></u>(1)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Using <b>-stats</b> <b>-bits</b> shows some redundant information.

       The  <b>-geometry</b> string displayed must make assumptions about the window's border width and the behavior of
       the application and the window manager.  As a result, the location given is not always correct.
