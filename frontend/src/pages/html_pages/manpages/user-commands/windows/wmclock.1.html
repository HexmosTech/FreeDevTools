</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wmclock - A dockable clock for the Window Maker window manager

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>wmclock</b>  [{-12|-24|-year}]  [-noblink]  [-version]  [-exe  <u>program</u>]  [-led  <u>color</u>]  [-monthxpm  <u>filename</u>]
              [-weekdayxpm <u>filename</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Wmclock</b> is an applet which displays the date and time in a dockable tile in the same style as  the  clock
       from  the  NEXTSTEP(tm)  operating  system.   <b>Wmclock</b>  is  specially designed for the Window Maker window
       manager, by Alfredo Kojima, and features multiple  language  support,  twenty-four-hour  and  twelve-hour
       (am/pm)  time  display,  and,  optionally, can run a user-specified program on a mouse click.  <b>Wmclock</b> is
       derived from <b>asclock</b>, a similar clock for the AfterStep window manager.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-12</b> or <b>-24</b>
              Display the time in either twelve-hour format (with am/pm) or twenty-four-hour  format.   Defaults
              to twenty-four-hour display.

       <b>-year</b>  Display the current year in the LED display instead of the time.

       <b>-noblink</b>
              The  separator  between  the hours and minutes in the time display blinks by default.  This option
              turns off the blinking and displays a steadily lit separator instead.

       <b>-interval</b> <u>n</u>
              Set the blink cycle to <u>n</u> seconds.  The default is 2 (1 second on, 1 second off).

       <b>-version</b>
              Displays the version of Wmclock.

       <b>-exe</b> <u>command</u>
              Run <u>command</u> in the background when a mouse button is pressed over <b>wmclock</b>.  See below for details.

       <b>-led</b> <u>color</u>
              Use <u>color</u> as the foreground color of the LED display.  <u>Color</u> may be either a named color from  the
              rgb.txt  database  (for example, `red' or `chartreuse') or a numeric color specification in any of
              the usual X11 formats (for example, `#ff0000' or `rgb:7f/ff/00').  See the <b><a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a></b>(1) man page for  more
              information.

       <b>-monthxpm</b> <u>filename</u>
              Get  month  abbreviations from <u>filename</u>, which is expected to be in the XPM format.  See below for
              details.

       <b>-weekdayxpm</b> <u>filename</u>
              Get weekday abbreviations from <u>filename</u>, which is expected to be in the XPM format.  See below for
              details.

</pre><h4><b>INVOCATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The simplest way to start <b>wmclock</b> is:

              wmclock

       <b>Wmclock</b> displays in its own appicon, which you can place in Window Maker's dock by holding down the [Alt]
       or [Meta] key and dragging <b>wmclock</b> to the dock with the primary mouse button (usually the left one).

       For a more complicated example:

              wmclock -12 -led gold -exe /usr/GNUstep/Apps/WPrefs.app/WPrefs

       This displays 12-hour time in an amber-colored LED display, and starts Window Maker's preferences utility
       when you click on <b>wmclock</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Running</b> <b>Commands</b>
       When you use <b>wmclock</b> with the <b>-exe</b> option, <b>wmclock</b> will run the command you specify whenever you press  a
       mouse  button  while  the  mouse  cursor is over <b>wmclock</b>.  <b>Wmclock</b> uses the <b><a href="../man3/system.3.html">system</a></b>(3) function from the C
       library (and ultimately <b><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></b>) to run the command; hence, the command must be in Bourne-shell syntax.

   <b>Using</b> <b>Alternate</b> <b>Month</b> <b>and</b> <b>Weekday</b> <b>Abbreviations</b>
       You can use the <b>-monthxpm</b> and <b>-weekdayxpm</b> options to convince <b>wmclock</b> to display  month  and  day-of-week
       abbreviations  in  a language besides the one it was compiled with, or to display them in a language that
       <b>wmclock</b> does not yet support.  The files you specify must be in the XPM format, and they must follow  the
       same  strict  size  and  placement as the month and weekday XPMs that come in the <b>wmclock</b> source package.
       Each weekday abbreviation must be 21 pixels wide and 6 pixels high; each month abbreviation  must  be  22
       pixels  wide  and  6  pixels  high.   The month abbreviations must be arranged vertically, beginning with
       January at the top and continuing down to December at the bottom.  The weekday abbreviations must also be
       arranged vertically, beginning with Monday at the top and continuing to Sunday at the bottom.

       You can find XPM files for a variety of languages in:

              <b>/usr/share/wmclock</b>

       For example, to have a French display, you could use the following command line:

              wmclock -monthxpm /usr/share/wmclock/lang.french/month.xpm -weekdayxpm
              /usr/share/wmclock/lang.french/weekday.xpm

   <b>Obsolete</b> <b>Options</b>
       In order to maintain command-line compatibility (mostly) with <b>asclock</b>, <b>wmclock</b> accepts a few  options  on
       the  command line without complaining, even though they don't have any effect.  The options which <b>wmclock</b>
       accepts in this manner are <b>-shape</b> and <b>-iconic</b>.  Some dockable versions of <b>asclock</b> required one or both of
       these options to become properly dockable.  However, Since <b>wmclock</b> is designed for Window  Maker's  dock,
       it already displays in a shaped window in its own dockable appicon.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Wmclock</b> shouldn't run a command on a single click; should use a double click instead.

       <b>Wmclock</b> should use Alfredo Kojima's libdockapp library instead of inventing its own wheel.
