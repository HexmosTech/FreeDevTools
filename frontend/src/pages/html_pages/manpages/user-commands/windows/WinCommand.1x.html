</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>WinCommand</b> - AfterStep module for choosing and manipulating windows based on patterns

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       WinCommand  is  a  command  line  tool which allows you to select windows based on their name and to then
       manipulate them in various ways. Actions currently supported are:  "center",  "center  jump",  "iconify",
       "jump", "kill", "move", "resize" and "sendtodesk".

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULTS</b></h4><pre>
       The default pattern is "", meaning all windows will be selected.

       All  other default-values depend on the action you would like WinCommand to take. If more than one action
       is specified, default-values are set depending on the last action specified.

</pre><h4><b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       center

              Place matching windows into the center of the screen.

       center jump:

              Places first window that matches into the center of the screen and jumps to it.

       iconify:

              Iconifies matching windows.

       jump:

              Jumps to the first window which matches.

       kill:

              Kills all matching windows.

       move:

              Moves all matching windows to x/y. x and y are specified using the -x and -y flags.

       resize:

              Resize all matching windows. The two parameters width and height are specified  using  the  -width
              and -height flags.

       send_to_desk:

              Send all matching windows to desk specified with the -new_desk flag.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -all

              Operate  on all windows which match the given pattern. This is set by default unless the action is
              either "jump" or "center jump".

       -alldesks

              Windows on all desks will be taken into account. This is set by default if action is either "jump"
              or "center jump".

       -desk

              Windows on the whole desk will be taken into account.

       -x/-y

              These are required when issuing the move-command.

       -width/-height

              These are required whenever you want to resize windows.

              Examples WinCommand -pattern term iconify

              This command will iconify all terminals. Since the specified  pattern  is  a  regular  expression,
              something like this also works:

              WinCommand -pattern "(term)|(moz)" iconify

              This will iconify all terminals and mozilla-browser windows.

              WinCommand -pattern xmm jump

              will jump to your xmms. In this situation, it's far more advisable to use GWCommand though.

              It is probably not a good idea to delete windows while windows are being arranged.
