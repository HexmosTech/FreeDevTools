       xmonad - Tiling Window Manager

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xmonad</u>  is a minimalist tiling window manager for X, written in Haskell.  Windows are managed using auto‐
       matic layout algorithms, which can be dynamically reconfigured.  At any time windows are arranged  so  as
       to maximize the use of screen real estate.  All features of the window manager are accessible purely from
       the  keyboard:  a  mouse  is entirely optional.  <u>xmonad</u> is configured in Haskell, and custom layout algo‐
       rithms may be implemented by the user in config files.  A principle of <u>xmonad</u> is predictability: the user
       should know in advance precisely the window arrangement that will result from any action.

       By default, <u>xmonad</u> provides three layout algorithms: tall, wide and fullscreen.  In tall  or  wide  mode,
       windows  are  tiled and arranged to prevent overlap and maximize screen use.  Sets of windows are grouped
       together on virtual screens, and each screen retains its own layout, which may be reconfigured dynamical‐
       ly.  Multiple physical monitors are supported via Xinerama, allowing simultaneous display of a number  of
       screens.

       By utilizing the expressivity of a modern functional language with a rich static type system, <u>xmonad</u> pro‐
       vides a complete, featureful window manager in less than 1200 lines of code, with an emphasis on correct‐
       ness and robustness.  Internal properties of the window manager are checked using a combination of static
       guarantees  provided by the type system, and type-based automated testing.  A benefit of this is that the
       code is simple to understand, and easy to modify.

</pre><h4><b>Usage</b></h4><pre>
       <u>xmonad</u> places each window into a “workspace”.  Each workspace can have any number of windows,  which  you
       can  cycle though with mod-j and mod-k.  Windows are either displayed full screen, tiled horizontally, or
       tiled vertically.  You can toggle the layout mode with mod-space, which will cycle through the  available
       modes.

       You  can switch to workspace N with mod-N.  For example, to switch to workspace 5, you would press mod-5.
       Similarly, you can move the current window to another workspace with mod-shift-N.

       When running with multiple monitors (Xinerama), each screen has exactly 1 workspace visible.  mod-{w,e,r}
       switch the focus between screens, while shift-mod-{w,e,r} move the current window to that  screen.   When
       <u>xmonad</u> starts, workspace 1 is on screen 1, workspace 2 is on screen 2, etc.  When switching workspaces to
       one that is already visible, the current and visible workspaces are swapped.

   <b>Flags</b>
       xmonad has several flags which you may pass to the executable.  These flags are:

       –recompile
              Recompiles your <u>xmonad.hs</u> configuration

       –restart
              Causes the currently running <u>xmonad</u> process to restart

       –replace
              Replace the current window manager with xmonad

       –version
              Display version of <u>xmonad</u>

       –verbose-version
              Display detailed version of <u>xmonad</u>

</pre><h4><b>Examples</b></h4><pre>
       To use xmonad as your window manager add to your <u><a href="file:~/.xinitrc">~/.xinitrc</a></u> file:

              exec xmonad

</pre><h4><b>Customization</b></h4><pre>
       xmonad is customized in your <u>xmonad.hs</u>, and then restarted with mod-q.  You can choose where your config‐
       uration file lives by

       1. Setting  XMONAD_DATA_DIR, XMONAD_CONFIG_DIR, and XMONAD_CACHE_DIR; <u>xmonad.hs</u> is then expected to be in
          XMONAD_CONFIG_DIR.

       2. Creating <u>xmonad.hs</u> in <u><a href="file:~/.xmonad">~/.xmonad</a></u>.

       3. Creating <u>xmonad.hs</u> in XDG_CONFIG_HOME.  Note that, in this case, xmonad  will  use  XDG_DATA_HOME  and
          XDG_CACHE_HOME for its data and cache directory respectively.

       You  can  find  many extensions to the core feature set in the xmonad- contrib package, available through
       your package manager or from xmonad.org (https://xmonad.org).

   <b>Modular</b> <b>Configuration</b>
       As of <u>xmonad-0.9</u>, any additional Haskell modules may be placed in <u><a href="file:~/.xmonad/lib/">~/.xmonad/lib/</a></u> are available  in  GHC’s
       searchpath.  Hierarchical modules are supported: for example, the file <u><a href="file:~/.xmonad/lib/XMonad/Stack/MyAddi">~/.xmonad/lib/XMonad/Stack/MyAddi</a>‐</u>
       <u>tions.hs</u> could contain:

              module XMonad.Stack.MyAdditions (function1) where
                function1 = error "function1: Not implemented yet!"

       Your  xmonad.hs may then import XMonad.Stack.MyAdditions as if that module was contained within xmonad or
       xmonad-contrib.

</pre><h4><b>Bugs</b></h4><pre>
       Probably.  If you find any, please report them to  the  bugtracker  (https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad/is‐
       sues)
