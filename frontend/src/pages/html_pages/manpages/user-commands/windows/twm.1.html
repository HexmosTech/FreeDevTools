</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       twm - Tab Window Manager for the X Window System

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <b>twm</b> [ <b>-display</b> <u>dpy</u> ] [ <b>-s</b> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>initfile</u> ] [ <b>-v</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Twm</u> is a window manager for the X Window System.  It provides titlebars, shaped windows, several forms of
       icon management, user-defined macro functions, click-to-type and pointer-driven keyboard focus, and user-
       specified key and pointer button bindings.

       This  program  is usually started by the user's session manager or startup script.  When used from <u><a href="../man1/xdm.1.html">xdm</a>(1)</u>
       or <u><a href="../man1/xinit.1.html">xinit</a>(1)</u> without a session manager, <u>twm</u> is frequently executed in the foreground as the  last  client.
       When run this way, exiting <u>twm</u> causes the session to be terminated (i.e., logged out).

       By  default,  application  windows are surrounded by a ``frame'' with a titlebar at the top and a special
       border around the window.  The titlebar contains the window's name, a rectangle  that  is  lit  when  the
       window  is  receiving  keyboard input, and function boxes known as ``titlebuttons'' at the left and right
       edges of the titlebar.

       Pressing pointer Button1 (usually the left-most button unless it has been  changed  with  <u>xmodmap</u>)  on  a
       titlebutton  will  invoke the function associated with the button.  In the default interface, windows are
       iconified by clicking (pressing and then immediately releasing) the left titlebutton (which looks like  a
       Dot).   Conversely,  windows  are  deiconified  by  clicking  in the associated icon or entry in the icon
       manager (see description of the variable <b>ShowIconManager</b> and of the function <b>f.showiconmgr</b>).

       Windows are resized by pressing the right titlebutton  (which  resembles  a  group  of  nested  squares),
       dragging  the  pointer  over  edge that is to be moved, and releasing the pointer when the outline of the
       window is the desired size.  Similarly, windows are moved by pressing in the title or  highlight  region,
       dragging  a  window  outline  to  the new location, and then releasing when the outline is in the desired
       position.  Just clicking in the title or highlight region raises the window without moving it.

       When new windows are created, <u>twm</u> will honor any size and location  information  requested  by  the  user
       (usually  through  <u>-geometry</u>  command  line  argument  or  resources  for  the  individual applications).
       Otherwise, an outline of the window's default size, its titlebar, and lines dividing the  window  into  a
       3x3  grid that track the pointer are displayed.  Clicking pointer Button1 will position the window at the
       current position and give it the default size.  Pressing pointer  Button2  (usually  the  middle  pointer
       button)  and  dragging  the  outline  will give the window its current position but allow the sides to be
       resized as described above.  Clicking pointer Button3 (usually the right pointer button)  will  give  the
       window its current position but attempt to make it long enough to touch the bottom the screen.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Twm</u> accepts the following command line options:

       <b>-display</b> <u>dpy</u>
               This option specifies the X server to use.

       <b>-s</b>      This  option  indicates  that only the default screen (as specified by <b>-display</b> or by the <b>DISPLAY</b>
               environment variable) should be managed.  By default, <u>twm</u> will attempt to manage all  screens  on
               the display.

       <b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>
               This  option  specifies  the  name  of the startup file to use.  By default, <u>twm</u> will look in the
               user's home directory for files named <u>.twmrc.num</u> (where <u>num</u> is a screen number) or <u>.twmrc</u>.

       <b>-v</b>      This option indicates that <u>twm</u> should print error messages whenever an unexpected X  Error  event
               is  received.   This  can be useful when debugging applications but can be distracting in regular
               use.

</pre><h4><b>CUSTOMIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       Much of <u>twm</u>'s appearance and behavior can be controlled by  providing  a  startup  file  in  one  of  the
       following locations (searched in order for each screen being managed when <u>twm</u> begins):

       <b>$HOME/.twmrc.</b><u>screennumber</u>
               The  <u>screennumber</u>  is  a  small positive number (e.g. 0, 1, etc.)  representing the screen number
               (e.g. the last number in the DISPLAY environment variable <u>host:displaynum.screennum</u>)  that  would
               be  used  to  contact  that  screen  of the display.  This is intended for displays with multiple
               screens of differing visual types.

       <b>$HOME/.twmrc</b>
               This is the usual name for an individual user's startup file.

       <b>/usr/share/X11/twm/system.twmrc</b>
               If neither of the preceding  files  are  found,  <u>twm</u>  will  look  in  this  file  for  a  default
               configuration.   This  is often tailored by the site administrator to provide convenient menus or
               familiar bindings for novice users.

       If no startup files are found, <u>twm</u> will use the built-in defaults described  above.   The  only  resource
       used by <u>twm</u> is <u>bitmapFilePath</u> for a colon-separated list of directories to search when looking for bitmap
       files (for more information, see the <u>Athena</u> <u>Widgets</u> manual and <u><a href="../man1/xrdb.1.html">xrdb</a>(1)</u>).

       <u>Twm</u>  startup  files  are  logically  broken  up into three types of specifications:  <u>Variables</u>, <u>Bindings</u>,
       <u>Menus</u>.  The <u>Variables</u> section must come first and is used to describe the fonts, colors, cursors,  border
       widths,  icon and window placement, highlighting, autoraising, layout of titles, warping, use of the icon
       manager.  The <u>Bindings</u> section usually comes second and is used to specify the functions that  should  be
       to  be  invoked when keyboard and pointer buttons are pressed in windows, icons, titles, and frames.  The
       <u>Menus</u> section gives any user-defined menus  (containing  functions  to  be  invoked  or  commands  to  be
       executed).

       Variable  names and keywords are case-insensitive.  Strings must be surrounded by double quote characters
       (e.g. "blue") and are case-sensitive.  A pound sign (#) outside of a string causes the remainder  of  the
       line in which the character appears to be treated as a comment.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Many  of  the  aspects  of <u>twm</u>'s user interface are controlled by variables that may be set in the user's
       startup file.  Some of the options are enabled or  disabled  simply  by  the  presence  of  a  particular
       keyword.  Other options require keywords, numbers, strings, or lists of all of these.

       Lists are surrounded by braces and are usually separated by whitespace or a newline.  For example:
       <b>AutoRaise</b> { "emacs" "XTerm" "Xmh" }
       or
       <b>AutoRaise</b>
       {
               "emacs"
               "XTerm"
               "Xmh"
       }
       When  a variable containing a list of strings representing windows is searched (e.g. to determine whether
       or not to enable autoraise as shown above), a string must  be  an  exact,  case-sensitive  match  to  the
       window's  name  (given  by  the  WM_NAME window property), resource name or class name (both given by the
       WM_CLASS window property).  The preceding example would enable autoraise on windows  named  ``emacs''  as
       well as any <u>xterm</u> (since they are of class ``XTerm'') or xmh windows (which are of class ``Xmh'').

       String  arguments  that  are interpreted as filenames (see the <b>Pixmaps</b>, <b>Cursors</b>, and <b>IconDirectory</b> below)
       will prepend the user's directory (specified by the <b>HOME</b> environment variable) if the first character  is
       a tilde (~).  If, instead, the first character is a colon (:), the name is assumed to refer to one of the
       internal bitmaps that are used to create the default titlebars symbols:  <b>:xlogo</b> or <b>:delete</b> (both refer to
       the  X  logo),  <b>:dot</b>  or <b>:iconify</b> (both refer to the dot), <b>:resize</b> (the nested squares used by the resize
       button), <b>:menu</b> (a page with lines), and <b>:question</b> (the question mark used for non-existent bitmap files).

       The following variables may be specified at the top of a <u>twm</u> startup file.  Lists of Window  name  prefix
       strings are indicated by <u>win-list</u>.  Optional arguments are shown in square brackets:

       <b>AutoRaise</b> { <u>win-list</u> }
               This  variable  specifies  a  list  of  windows  that should automatically be raised whenever the
               pointer enters the window.  This action can be interactively enabled or  disabled  on  individual
               windows using the function <b>f.autoraise</b>.

       <b>AutoRelativeResize</b>
               This  variable indicates that dragging out a window size (either when initially sizing the window
               with pointer Button2 or when resizing it) should not wait  until  the  pointer  has  crossed  the
               window edges.  Instead, moving the pointer automatically causes the nearest edge or edges to move
               by  the same amount.  This allows the resizing of windows that extend off the edge of the screen.
               If the pointer is in the center of  the  window,  or  if  the  resize  is  begun  by  pressing  a
               titlebutton,  <u>twm</u>  will still wait for the pointer to cross a window edge (to prevent accidents).
               This option is particularly useful for people who like the press-drag-release method of  sweeping
               out window sizes.

       <b>BorderColor</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>wincolorlist</u> }]
               This  variable  specifies  the  default color of the border to be placed around all non-iconified
               windows, and may only be given within a  <b>Color</b>,  <b>Grayscale</b>  or  <b>Monochrome</b>  list.   The  optional
               <u>wincolorlist</u>  specifies  a  list  of window and color name pairs for specifying particular border
               colors for different types of windows.  For example:
               <b>BorderColor</b> "gray50"
               {
                       "XTerm" "red"
                       "xmh"   "green"
               }
               The default is "black".

       <b>BorderTileBackground</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>wincolorlist</u> }]
               This variable specifies the default background color in the gray pattern  used  in  unhighlighted
               borders (only if <b>NoHighlight</b> hasn't been set), and may only be given within a <b>Color</b>, <b>Grayscale</b> or
               <b>Monochrome</b>  list.   The  optional  <u>wincolorlist</u>  allows  per-window  colors to be specified.  The
               default  is "white".

       <b>BorderTileForeground</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>wincolorlist</u> }]
               This variable specifies the default foreground color in the gray pattern  used  in  unhighlighted
               borders (only if <b>NoHighlight</b> hasn't been set), and may only be given within a <b>Color</b>, <b>Grayscale</b> or
               <b>Monochrome</b>  list.   The  optional  <u>wincolorlist</u>  allows  per-window  colors to be specified.  The
               default is "black".

       <b>BorderWidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
               This variable specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding all client window frames if
               <b>ClientBorderWidth</b> has not been specified.  This value is also used to  set  the  border  size  of
               windows created by <u>twm</u> (such as the icon manager).  The default is 2.

       <b>ButtonIndent</b> <u>pixels</u>
               This  variable  specifies  the  amount  by  which  titlebuttons  should be indented on all sides.
               Positive values cause the buttons to be smaller than the window text and highlight area  so  that
               they stand out.  Setting this and the <b>TitleButtonBorderWidth</b> variables to 0 makes titlebuttons be
               as tall and wide as possible.  The default is 1.

       <b>ClientBorderWidth</b>
               This variable indicates that border width of a window's frame should be set to the initial border
               width of the window, rather than to the value of <b>BorderWidth</b>.

       <b>Color</b> { <u>colors-list</u> }
               This  variable specifies a list of color assignments to be made if the default display is capable
               of displaying more than simple black and white.  The <u>colors-list</u> is  made  up  of  the  following
               color   variables   and   their  values:  <b>DefaultBackground</b>,  <b>DefaultForeground</b>,  <b>MenuBackground</b>,
               <b>MenuForeground</b>,  <b>MenuTitleBackground</b>,  <b>MenuTitleForeground</b>,   <b>MenuShadowColor</b>,   <b>MenuBorderColor</b>,
               <b>PointerForeground</b>, and <b>PointerBackground</b>.  The following color variables may also be given a list
               of  window  and  color name pairs to allow per-window colors to be specified (see <b>BorderColor</b> for
               details):  <b>BorderColor</b>,   <b>IconManagerHighlight</b>,   <b>BorderTitleBackground</b>,   <b>BorderTitleForeground</b>,
               <b>TitleBackground</b>,     <b>TitleForeground</b>,     <b>IconBackground</b>,     <b>IconForeground</b>,    <b>IconBorderColor</b>,
               <b>IconManagerBackground</b>, and <b>IconManagerForeground</b>.  For example:
               <b>Color</b>
               {
                       MenuBackground          "gray50"
                       MenuForeground          "blue"
                       BorderColor                     "red" { "XTerm" "yellow" }
                       TitleForeground         "yellow"
                       TitleBackground         "blue"
               }
               All of these color variables may also be specified for the <b>Monochrome</b> variable, allowing the same
               initialization file to be used on both color and monochrome displays.

       <b>ConstrainedMoveTime</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
               This variable specifies the length of time between button clicks needed to  begin  a  constrained
               move  operation.   Double clicking within this amount of time when invoking <b>f.move</b> will cause the
               window to be moved only in a horizontal or vertical direction.  Setting  this  value  to  0  will
               disable constrained moves.  The default is 400 milliseconds.

       <b>Cursors</b> { <u>cursor-list</u> }
               This  variable specifies the glyphs that <u>twm</u> should use for various pointer cursors.  Each cursor
               may be defined either from the <b>cursor</b> font or from two bitmap files.  Shapes from the <b>cursor</b> font
               may be specified directly as:
                       <u>cursorname</u>        "<u>string</u>"
               where <u>cursorname</u> is one of the cursor names listed below, and <u>string</u> is the name of  a  glyph  as
               found  in  the file <u>/usr/include/X11/cursorfont.h</u> (without the ``XC_'' prefix).  If the cursor is
               to be defined from bitmap files, the following syntax is used instead:
                       <u>cursorname</u>        "<u>image</u>"   "<u>mask</u>"
               The <u>image</u> and <u>mask</u> strings specify the names of files containing the  glyph  image  and  mask  in
               <u><a href="../man1/bitmap.1.html">bitmap</a>(1)</u>  form.   The  bitmap  files  are  located in the same manner as icon bitmap files.  The
               following example shows the default cursor definitions:
               <b>Cursors</b>
               {
                       Frame           "top_left_arrow"
                       Title           "top_left_arrow"
                       Icon            "top_left_arrow"
                       IconMgr "top_left_arrow"
                       Move            "fleur"
                       Resize          "fleur"
                       Menu            "sb_left_arrow"
                       Button          "hand2"
                       Wait            "watch"
                       Select          "dot"
                       Destroy "pirate"
               }

       <b>DecorateTransients</b>
               This variable indicates that transient windows (those  containing  a  WM_TRANSIENT_FOR  property)
               should have titlebars.  By default, transients are not reparented.

       <b>DefaultBackground</b> <u>string</u>
               This  variable specifies the background color to be used for sizing and information windows.  The
               default is "white".

       <b>DefaultForeground</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the foreground color to be used for sizing and information windows.   The
               default is "black".

       <b>DontIconifyByUnmapping</b> { <u>win-list</u> }
               This  variable  specifies  a list of windows that should not be iconified by simply unmapping the
               window (as would be the case if <b>IconifyByUnmapping</b> had been set).  This  is  frequently  used  to
               force some windows to be treated as icons while other windows are handled by the icon manager.

       <b>DontMoveOff</b>
               This variable indicates that windows should not be allowed to be moved off the screen.  It can be
               overridden by the <b>f.forcemove</b> function.

       <b>DontSqueezeTitle</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable indicates that titlebars should not be squeezed to their minimum size as described
               under <b>SqueezeTitle</b> below.  If the optional window list is supplied, only those  windows  will  be
               prevented from being squeezed.

       <b>ForceIcons</b>
               This  variable  indicates  that  icon pixmaps specified in the <b>Icons</b> variable should override any
               client-supplied pixmaps.

       <b>FramePadding</b> <u>pixels</u>
               This variable specifies the distance between the titlebar decorations (the button and  text)  and
               the window frame.  The default is 2 pixels.

       <b>Grayscale</b> { <u>colors</u> }
               This  variable  specifies  a  list  of  color assignments that should be made if the screen has a
               GrayScale default visual.  See the description of <b>Colors</b>.

       <b>IconBackground</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This variable specifies the background color of icons, and may only  be  specified  inside  of  a
               <b>Color</b>,  <b>Grayscale</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The optional <u>win-list</u> is a list of window names and colors
               so that per-window colors may  be  specified.   See  the  <b>BorderColor</b>  variable  for  a  complete
               description of the <u>win-list</u>.  The default is "white".

       <b>IconBorderColor</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable specifies the color of the border used for icon windows, and may only be specified
               inside of a <b>Color</b>, <b>Grayscale</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The optional <u>win-list</u> is a list of window names
               and colors so that per-window colors may be  specified.   See  the  <b>BorderColor</b>  variable  for  a
               complete description of the <u>win-list</u>.  The default is "black".

       <b>IconBorderWidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
               This  variable specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding icon windows.  The default
               is 2.

       <b>IconDirectory</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the directory that should be searched if if a bitmap file cannot be found
               in any of the directories in the <b>bitmapFilePath</b> resource.

       <b>IconFont</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the font to be used to display icon names within icons.  The  default  is
               "variable".

       <b>IconForeground</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable  specifies  the foreground color to be used when displaying icons, and may only be
               specified inside of a <b>Color</b>, <b>Grayscale</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The optional <u>win-list</u> is  a  list  of
               window names and colors so that per-window colors may be specified.  See the <b>BorderColor</b> variable
               for a complete description of the <u>win-list</u>.  The default is "black".

       <b>IconifyByUnmapping</b> <b>[{</b> <u>win-list</u> <b>}]</b>
               This  variable indicates that windows should be iconified by being unmapped without trying to map
               any icons.  This assumes that the user will remap  the  window  through  the  icon  manager,  the
               <b>f.warpto</b>  function,  or  the  <u>TwmWindows</u>  menu.  If the optional <u>win-list</u> is provided, only those
               windows  will  be  iconified  by  simply  unmapping.   Windows  that  have  both  this  and   the
               <b>IconManagerDontShow</b> options set may not be accessible if no binding to the <u>TwmWindows</u> menu is set
               in the user's startup file.

       <b>IconManagerBackground</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable  specifies  the  background color to use for icon manager entries, and may only be
               specified inside of a <b>Color</b>, <b>Grayscale</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The optional <u>win-list</u> is  a  list  of
               window names and colors so that per-window colors may be specified.  See the <b>BorderColor</b> variable
               for a complete description of the <u>win-list</u>.  The default is "white".

       <b>IconManagerDontShow</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable  indicates  that the icon manager should not display any windows.  If the optional
               <u>win-list</u> is given, only those windows will not be displayed.  This variable is  used  to  prevent
               windows  that  are  rarely  iconified  (such as <u>xclock</u> or <u>xload</u>) from taking up space in the icon
               manager.

       <b>IconManagerFont</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the font to be used when displaying icon manager entries.  The default is
               "variable".

       <b>IconManagerForeground</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This variable specifies the foreground color to be used when displaying icon manager entries, and
               may only be specified inside of a <b>Color</b>, <b>Grayscale</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The optional <u>win-list</u>  is
               a  list  of  window  names  and  colors  so  that  per-window  colors  may be specified.  See the
               <b>BorderColor</b> variable for a complete description of the <u>win-list</u>.  The default is "black".

       <b>IconManagerGeometry</b> <u>string</u> [ <u>columns</u> ]
               This variable specifies the geometry of the icon manager window.  The <u>string</u> argument is standard
               geometry specification that indicates the initial full  size  of  the  icon  manager.   The  icon
               manager  window  is then broken into <u>columns</u> pieces and scaled according to the number of entries
               in the icon manager.  Extra entries are wrapped to form additional rows.  The default  number  of
               columns is 1.

       <b>IconManagerHighlight</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This variable specifies the border color to be used when highlighting the icon manager entry that
               currently  has  the  focus,  and can only be specified inside of a <b>Color</b>, <b>Grayscale</b> or <b>Monochrome</b>
               list.  The optional <u>win-list</u> is a list of window names and colors so that per-window  colors  may
               be  specified.   See  the  <b>BorderColor</b>  variable for a complete description of the <u>win-list</u>.  The
               default is "black".

       <b>IconManagers</b> { <u>iconmgr-list</u> }
               This variable specifies a list of icon managers to create.  Each item in the <u>iconmgr-list</u> has the
               following format:
                       "<u>winname</u>" ["<u>iconname</u>"]      "<u>geometry</u>" <u>columns</u>
               where <u>winname</u> is the name of the windows that should be put into this icon manager,  <u>iconname</u>  is
               the  name  of that icon manager window's icon, <u>geometry</u> is a standard geometry specification, and
               <u>columns</u> is the number of columns in this icon manager as described in  <b>IconManagerGeometry</b>.   For
               example:
               <b>IconManagers</b>
               {
                       "XTerm" "=300x5+800+5"  5
                       "myhost"        "=400x5+100+5"  2
               }
               Clients  whose  name  or  class  is  ``XTerm''  will  have an entry created in the ``XTerm'' icon
               manager.  Clients whose name was ``myhost'' would be put into the ``myhost'' icon manager.

       <b>IconManagerShow</b> { <u>win-list</u> }
               This variable specifies a list of windows that should appear in the icon manager.  When  used  in
               conjunction with the <b>IconManagerDontShow</b> variable, only the windows in this list will be shown in
               the icon manager.

       <b>IconRegion</b> <u>geomstring</u> <u>vgrav</u> <u>hgrav</u> <u>gridwidth</u> <u>gridheight</u>
               This  variable specifies an area on the root window in which icons are placed if no specific icon
               location is provided by the client.  The <u>geomstring</u> is a  quoted  string  containing  a  standard
               geometry  specification.  If more than one <b>IconRegion</b> lines are given, icons will be put into the
               succeeding icon regions when the first is full.  The <u>vgrav</u> argument should  be  either  <b>North</b>  or
               <b>South</b> and control and is used to control whether icons are first filled in from the top or bottom
               of  the  icon region.  Similarly, the <u>hgrav</u> argument should be either <b>East</b> or <b>West</b> and is used to
               control whether icons should be filled in from left from the right.  Icons are  laid  out  within
               the region in a grid with cells <u>gridwidth</u> pixels wide and <u>gridheight</u> pixels high.

       <b>Icons</b> { <u>win-list</u> }
               This  variable  specifies  a list of window names and the bitmap filenames that should be used as
               their icons.  For example:
               <b>Icons</b>
               {
                       "XTerm" "xterm.icon"
                       "xfd"           "xfd_icon"
               }
               Windows that match ``XTerm'' and would not be iconified by unmapping, and would try  to  use  the
               icon  bitmap  in  the  file ``xterm.icon''.  If <b>ForceIcons</b> is specified, this bitmap will be used
               even if the client has requested its own icon pixmap.

       <b>InterpolateMenuColors</b>
               This variable indicates that menu entry colors should be  interpolated  between  entry  specified
               colors.  In the example below:
               <b>Menu</b> "mymenu"
               {
                       "Title"         ("black":"red")         f.title
                       "entry1"                                f.nop
                       "entry2"                                f.nop
                       "entry3"        ("white":"green")       f.nop
                       "entry4"                                f.nop
                       "entry5"        ("red":"white")         f.nop
               }
               the foreground colors for ``entry1'' and ``entry2'' will be interpolated between black and white,
               and  the  background colors between red and green.  Similarly, the foreground for ``entry4'' will
               be half-way between white and red, and the background will be half-way between green and white.

       <b>MakeTitle</b> { <u>win-list</u> }
               This variable specifies a list of windows on which a titlebar should be placed  and  is  used  to
               request titles on specific windows when <b>NoTitle</b> has been set.

       <b>MaxWindowSize</b> <u>string</u>
               This  variable  specifies  a  geometry  in which the width and height give the maximum size for a
               given window.  This is typically used to restrict windows to the size of the screen.  The default
               width is 32767 - screen width.  The default height is 32767 - screen height.

       <b>MenuBackground</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the background color used for menus, and can only be specified inside  of
               a <b>Color</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The default is "white".

       <b>MenuBorderColor</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the color of the menu border and can only be specified inside of a <b>Color</b>,
               <b>Grayscale</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The default is "black".

       <b>MenuBorderWidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
               This  variable specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding menu windows.  The default
               is 2.

       <b>MenuFont</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the font to use when displaying menus.  The default is "variable".

       <b>MenuForeground</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the foreground color used for menus, and can only be specified inside  of
               a <b>Color</b>, <b>Grayscale</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The default is "black".

       <b>MenuShadowColor</b> <u>string</u>
               This  variable specifies the color of the shadow behind pull-down menus and can only be specified
               inside of a <b>Color</b>, <b>Grayscale</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The default is "black".

       <b>MenuTitleBackground</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the background color for <b>f.title</b>  entries  in  menus,  and  can  only  be
               specified inside of a <b>Color</b>, <b>Grayscale</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The default is "white".

       <b>MenuTitleForeground</b> <u>string</u>
               This  variable  specifies  the  foreground  color  for  <b>f.title</b>  entries in menus and can only be
               specified inside of a <b>Color</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The default is "black".

       <b>Monochrome</b> { <u>colors</u> }
               This variable specifies a list of color assignments that should be made if the screen has a depth
               of 1.  See the description of <b>Colors</b>.

       <b>MoveDelta</b> <u>pixels</u>
               This variable specifies the number of pixels the pointer must move  before  the  <b>f.move</b>  function
               starts working.  Also see the <b>f.deltastop</b> function.  The default is zero pixels.

       <b>NoBackingStore</b>
               This  variable indicates that <u>twm</u>'s menus should not request backing store to minimize repainting
               of menus.  This is typically used with servers that can  repaint  faster  than  they  can  handle
               backing store.

       <b>NoCaseSensitive</b>
               This  variable  indicates that case should be ignored when sorting icon names in an icon manager.
               This option is typically used with applications that capitalize the first letter  of  their  icon
               name.

       <b>NoDefaults</b>
               This  variable  indicates that <u>twm</u> should not supply the default titlebuttons and bindings.  This
               option should only be used if the startup file contains a completely  new  set  of  bindings  and
               definitions.

       <b>NoGrabServer</b>
               This  variable  indicates  that  <u>twm</u>  should not grab the server when popping up menus and moving
               opaque windows.

       <b>NoHighlight</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This variable indicates that borders should not be highlighted  to  track  the  location  of  the
               pointer.   If  the  optional  <u>win-list</u>  is  given,  highlighting  will only be disabled for those
               windows.  When the border is highlighted, it will be drawn in the current <b>BorderColor</b>.  When  the
               border  is  not  highlighted,  it  will  be  stippled  with  a  gray  pattern  using  the current
               <b>BorderTileForeground</b> and <b>BorderTileBackground</b> colors.

       <b>NoIconManagers</b>
               This variable indicates that no icon manager should be created.

       <b>NoMenuShadows</b>
               This variable indicates that menus should not have drop  shadows  drawn  behind  them.   This  is
               typically  used  with slower servers since it speeds up menu drawing at the expense of making the
               menu slightly harder to read.

       <b>NoRaiseOnDeiconify</b>
               This variable indicates that windows that are deiconified should not be raised.

       <b>NoRaiseOnMove</b>
               This variable indicates that windows should not be raised when moved.  This is typically used  to
               allow windows to slide underneath each other.

       <b>NoRaiseOnResize</b>
               This  variable  indicates that windows should not be raised when resized.  This is typically used
               to allow windows to be resized underneath each other.

       <b>NoRaiseOnWarp</b>
               This variable indicates that windows should not be raised when the pointer is  warped  into  them
               with  the  <b>f.warpto</b> function.  If this option is set, warping to an occluded window may result in
               the pointer ending up in the occluding window instead the desired window (which causes unexpected
               behavior with <b>f.warpring</b>).

       <b>NoSaveUnders</b>
               This variable indicates that menus should not request save-unders to minimize  window  repainting
               following  menu  selection.  It is typically used with displays that can repaint faster than they
               can handle save-unders.

       <b>NoStackMode</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This variable indicates that client window requests to change stacking order should  be  ignored.
               If  the  optional  <u>win-list</u>  is  given,  only requests on those windows will be ignored.  This is
               typically used to prevent applications from relentlessly popping themselves to the front  of  the
               window stack.

       <b>NoTitle</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable  indicates  that  windows  should not have titlebars.  If the optional <u>win-list</u> is
               given, only those windows will not have titlebars.  <b>MakeTitle</b> may be used  with  this  option  to
               force titlebars to be put on specific windows.

       <b>NoTitleFocus</b>
               This  variable  indicates  that  <u>twm</u>  should not set keyboard input focus to each window as it is
               entered.  Normally, <u>twm</u> sets the focus so that focus and key events from the  titlebar  and  icon
               managers  are  delivered  to the application.  If the pointer is moved quickly and <u>twm</u> is slow to
               respond, input can be directed to the old window instead of the new.  This  option  is  typically
               used  to  prevent  this  ``input  lag''  and  to work around bugs in older applications that have
               problems with focus events.

       <b>NoTitleHighlight</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This variable indicates that the highlight area of the titlebar, which is used  to  indicate  the
               window  that currently has the input focus, should not be displayed.  If the optional <u>win-list</u> is
               given, only those windows will not have highlight areas.  This and the <b>SqueezeTitle</b>  options  can
               be set to substantially reduce the amount of screen space required by titlebars.

       <b>OpaqueMove</b>
               This  variable indicates that the <b>f.move</b> function should actually move the window instead of just
               an outline so that the user can immediately see what  the  window  will  look  like  in  the  new
               position.  This option is typically used on fast displays (particularly if <b>NoGrabServer</b> is set).

       <b>Pixmaps</b> { <u>pixmaps</u> }
               This  variable  specifies  a  list of pixmaps that define the appearance of various images.  Each
               entry is a keyword indicating the pixmap to set, followed by a string  giving  the  name  of  the
               bitmap file.  The following pixmaps may be specified:
               <b>Pixmaps</b>
               {
                       TitleHighlight  "gray1"
               }
               The default for <u>TitleHighlight</u> is to use an even stipple pattern.

       <b>Priority</b> <u>priority</u>
               This  variable  sets  <u>twm</u>'s  priority.  <u>priority</u> should be an unquoted, signed number (e.g. 999).
               This variable has an effect only if the server supports the SYNC extension.

       <b>RandomPlacement</b>
               This variable indicates that windows with no specified geometry should be  placed  in  a  pseudo-
               random location instead of having the user drag out an outline.

       <b>ResizeFont</b> <u>string</u>
               This  variable  specifies the font to be used for in the dimensions window when resizing windows.
               The default is "fixed".

       <b>RestartPreviousState</b>
               This variable indicates that <u>twm</u> should attempt to use the WM_STATE property on client windows to
               tell which windows should be iconified and which should be left visible.  This is typically  used
               to  try  to  regenerate  the  state that the screen was in before the previous window manager was
               shutdown.

       <b>SaveColor</b> { <u>colors-list</u> }
               This variable indicates a list of color assignments to be stored as  pixel  values  in  the  root
               window property _MIT_PRIORITY_COLORS.  Clients may elect to preserve these values when installing
               their  own  colormap.   Note  that use of this mechanism is a way an for application to avoid the
               "technicolor" problem, whereby useful  screen  objects  such  as  window  borders  and  titlebars
               disappear when a programs custom colors are installed by the window manager.  For example:
               <b>SaveColor</b>
               {
                       BorderColor
                       TitleBackground
                       TitleForeground
                       "red"
                       "green"
                       "blue"
               }
               This  would  place  on  the  root window 3 pixel values for borders and titlebars, as well as the
               three color strings, all taken from the default colormap.

       <b>ShowIconManager</b>
               This variable indicates that the icon manager window should be displayed when <u>twm</u> is started.  It
               can always be brought up using the <b>f.showiconmgr</b> function.

       <b>SortIconManager</b>
               This variable indicates that entries in the icon manager should be sorted  alphabetically  rather
               than by simply appending new windows to the end.

       <b>SqueezeTitle</b> [{ <u>squeeze-list</u> }]
               This  variable  indicates  that  <u>twm</u>  should attempt to use the SHAPE extension to make titlebars
               occupy only as much screen space as they need, rather than extending all the way across  the  top
               of  the  window.   The  optional <u>squeeze-list</u> may be used to control the location of the squeezed
               titlebar along the top of the window.  It contains entries of the form:
                       "<u>name</u>"            <u>justification</u>     <u>num</u>       <u>denom</u>
               where <u>name</u> is a window name, <u>justification</u> is either <b>left</b>, <b>center</b>, or <b>right</b>, and  <u>num</u>  and  <u>denom</u>
               are  numbers  specifying  a  ratio  giving  the  relative  position  about  which the titlebar is
               justified.  The ratio is measured from left to right if the numerator is positive, and  right  to
               left  if negative.  A denominator of 0 indicates that the numerator should be measured in pixels.
               For convenience, the ratio 0/0 is the same as 1/2 for <b>center</b> and -1/1 for <b>right</b>.  For example:
               <b>SqueezeTitle</b>
               {
                       "XTerm" left            0       0
                       "xterm1"        left            1       3
                       "xterm2"        left            2       3
                       "oclock"        center          0       0
                       "emacs" right           0       0
               }
               The <b>DontSqueezeTitle</b> list can be used to turn off squeezing on certain titles.

       <b>StartIconified</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This variable indicates that client windows should initially be left as  icons  until  explicitly
               deiconified  by  the user.  If the optional <u>win-list</u> is given, only those windows will be started
               iconic.  This is useful for programs that do not  support  an  <u>-iconic</u>  command  line  option  or
               resource.

       <b>TitleBackground</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable specifies the background color used in titlebars, and may only be specified inside
               of a <b>Color</b>, <b>Grayscale</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The optional <u>win-list</u> is a list of  window  names  and
               colors so that per-window colors may be specified.  The default is "white".

       <b>TitleButtonBorderWidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
               This  variable  specifies  the  width  in pixels of the border surrounding titlebuttons.  This is
               typically set to 0 to allow titlebuttons to take up as much space as possible and to not  have  a
               border.  The default is 1.

       <b>TitleFont</b> <u>string</u>
               This  variable  specifies  the  font  to  be  used for displaying window names in titlebars.  The
               default is "variable".

       <b>TitleForeground</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This variable specifies the foreground color used in titlebars, and may only be specified  inside
               of  a  <b>Color</b>,  <b>Grayscale</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The optional <u>win-list</u> is a list of window names and
               colors so that per-window colors may be specified.  The default is "black".

       <b>TitlePadding</b> <u>pixels</u>
               This variable specifies the distance between the various buttons, text, and  highlight  areas  in
               the titlebar.  The default is 8 pixels.

       <b>UnknownIcon</b> <u>string</u>
               This  variable  specifies  the  filename  of  a bitmap file to be used as the default icon.  This
               bitmap will be used as the icon of all clients which do not provide an icon bitmap  and  are  not
               listed in the <b>Icons</b> list.

       <b>UsePPosition</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies whether or not <u>twm</u> should honor program-requested locations (given by the
               <b>PPosition</b> flag in the WM_NORMAL_HINTS property) in the absence of a user-specified position.  The
               argument  <u>string</u>  may  have  one of three values:  <b>"off"</b> (the default) indicating that <u>twm</u> should
               ignore the program-supplied position, <b>"on"</b> indicating that the position should be used, and <b>"non-</b>
               <b>zero"</b> indicating that the position should used if it is other than (0,0).  The latter  option  is
               for working around a bug in older toolkits.

       <b>WarpCursor</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This variable indicates that the pointer should be warped into windows when they are deiconified.
               If  the  optional  <u>win-list</u>  is  given,  the  pointer  will only be warped when those windows are
               deiconified.

       <b>WindowRing</b> { <u>win-list</u> }
               This variable specifies a list of windows along which the <b>f.warpring</b> function cycles.

       <b>WarpUnmapped</b>
               This variable indicates that the <b>f.warpto</b> function should  deiconify  any  iconified  windows  it
               encounters.  This is typically used to make a key binding that will pop a particular window (such
               as <u>xmh</u>), no matter where it is.  The default is for <b>f.warpto</b> to ignore iconified windows.

       <b>XorValue</b> <u>number</u>
               This  variable  specifies  the value to use when drawing window outlines for moving and resizing.
               This should be set to a value that will result in a variety of  of  distinguishable  colors  when
               exclusive-or'ed with the contents of the user's typical screen.  Setting this variable to 1 often
               gives nice results if adjacent colors in the default colormap are distinct.  By default, <u>twm</u> will
               attempt to cause temporary lines to appear at the opposite end of the colormap from the graphics.

       <b>Zoom</b> [ <u>count</u> ]
               This  variable  indicates that outlines suggesting movement of a window to and from its iconified
               state should be displayed whenever a window is iconified  or  deiconified.   The  optional  <u>count</u>
               argument specifies the number of outlines to be drawn.  The default count is 8.

       The following variables must be set after the fonts have been assigned, so it is usually best to put them
       at the end of the variables or beginning of the bindings sections:

       <b>DefaultFunction</b> <u>function</u>
               This  variable  specifies  the function to be executed when a key or button event is received for
               which no binding is provided.  This is typically bound to <b>f.nop</b>, <b>f.beep</b>,  or  a  menu  containing
               window operations.

       <b>WindowFunction</b> <u>function</u>
               This  variable  specifies  the  function to execute when a window is selected from the <b>TwmWindows</b>
               menu.  If this variable is not set, the window will be deiconified and raised.

</pre><h4><b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       After the desired variables have been set, functions may be attached titlebuttons  and  key  and  pointer
       buttons.   Titlebuttons may be added from the left or right side and appear in the titlebar from left-to-
       right according to the order in which they are specified.  Key and pointer button bindings may  be  given
       in any order.

       Titlebuttons specifications must include the name of the pixmap to use in the button box and the function
       to be invoked when a pointer button is pressed within them:
       <b>LeftTitleButton</b> "<u>bitmapname</u>"        = <u>function</u>
       or
       <b>RightTitleButton</b> "<u>bitmapname</u>"       = <u>function</u>
       The  <u>bitmapname</u>  may refer to one of the  built-in bitmaps (which are scaled to match <b>TitleFont</b>) by using
       the appropriate colon-prefixed name described above.

       Key and pointer button specifications must give the modifiers that must be pressed, over which  parts  of
       the screen the pointer must be, and what function is to be invoked.  Keys are given as strings containing
       the appropriate keysym name; buttons are given as the keywords <b>Button1</b>-<b>Button5</b>:
       "FP1"           = <u>modlist</u> : <u>context</u> : <u>function</u>
       <b>Button1</b>   = <u>modlist</u> : <u>context</u> : <u>function</u>
       The  <u>modlist</u> is any combination of the modifier names <b>shift</b>, <b>control</b>, <b>lock</b>, <b>meta</b>, <b>mod1</b>, <b>mod2</b>, <b>mod3</b>, <b>mod4</b>,
       or <b>mod5</b> (which may be abbreviated as <b>s</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>l</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>m1</b>,  <b>m2</b>,  <b>m3</b>,  <b>m4</b>,  <b>m5</b>,  respectively)  separated  by  a
       vertical  bar  (|).   Similarly,  the  <u>context</u>  is  any  combination of <b>window</b>, <b>title</b>, <b>icon</b>, <b>root</b>, <b>frame</b>,
       <b>iconmgr</b>, their first letters (<b>iconmgr</b> abbreviation is <b>m</b>), or <b>all</b>,  separated  by  a  vertical  bar.   The
       <u>function</u>  is any of the <b>f.</b>  keywords described below.  For example, the default startup file contains the
       following bindings:
       Button1 =       : root          : f.menu "TwmWindows"
       Button1 = m     : window | icon : f.function "move-or-lower"
       Button2 = m     : window | icon : f.iconify
       Button3 = m     : window | icon : f.function "move-or-raise"
       Button1 =       : title         : f.function "move-or-raise"
       Button2 =       : title         : f.raiselower
       Button1 =       : icon          : f.function "move-or-iconify"
       Button2 =       : icon          : f.iconify
       Button1 =       : iconmgr       : f.iconify
       Button2 =       : iconmgr       : f.iconify
       A user who wanted to be able to manipulate windows from the keyboard could use the following bindings:
       "F1"    =       : all           : f.iconify
       "F2"    =       : all           : f.raiselower
       "F3"    =       : all           : f.warpring "next"
       "F4"    =       : all           : f.warpto "xmh"
       "F5"    =       : all           : f.warpto "emacs"
       "F6"    =       : all           : f.colormap "next"
       "F7"    =       : all           : f.colormap "default"
       "F20"   =       : all           : f.warptoscreen "next"
       "Left"  = m     : all           : f.backiconmgr
       "Right" = m | s : all           : f.forwiconmgr
       "Up"    = m     : all           : f.upiconmgr
       "Down"  = m | s : all           : f.downiconmgr
       <u>Twm</u> provides many more window manipulation primitives than can be  conveniently  stored  in  a  titlebar,
       menu,  or  set  of key bindings.  Although a small set of defaults are supplied (unless the <b>NoDefaults</b> is
       specified), most users will want to have their most common operations bound to key  and  button  strokes.
       To  do  this,  <u>twm</u>  associates  names with each of the primitives and provides <u>user-defined</u> <u>functions</u> for
       building higher level primitives and <u>menus</u> for interactively selecting among groups of functions.

       User-defined functions contain the name by which they are referenced in calls to <b>f.function</b> and a list of
       other functions to execute.  For example:
       Function "move-or-lower"        { f.move f.deltastop f.lower }
       Function "move-or-raise"        { f.move f.deltastop f.raise }
       Function "move-or-iconify"      { f.move f.deltastop f.iconify }
       Function "restore-colormap"     { f.colormap "default" f.lower }
       The function name must be used in <b>f.function</b> exactly as it appears in the function specification.

       In the descriptions below, if the function is said to operate on the selected window, but is invoked from
       a root menu, the cursor will be changed to the <b>Select</b> cursor and the next  window  to  receive  a  button
       press will be chosen:

       <b>!</b> <u>string</u>
               This is an abbreviation for <b>f.exec</b> <u>string</u>.

       <b>f.autoraise</b>
               This  function  toggles  whether  or  not  the  selected window is raised whenever entered by the
               pointer.  See the description of the variable <b>AutoRaise</b>.

       <b>f.backiconmgr</b>
               This function warps the pointer to the previous column in the current icon manager, wrapping back
               to the previous row if necessary.

       <b>f.beep</b>  This function sounds the keyboard bell.

       <b>f.bottomzoom</b>
               This function is similar to the <b>f.fullzoom</b> function, but resizes the  window  to  fill  only  the
               bottom half of the screen.

       <b>f.circledown</b>
               This function lowers the top-most window that occludes another window.

       <b>f.circleup</b>
               This function raises the bottom-most window that is occluded by another window.

       <b>f.colormap</b> <u>string</u>
               This  function  rotates  the  colormaps  (obtained  from  the WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property on the
               window) that <u>twm</u> will display when the pointer is in this window.  The argument <u>string</u>  may  have
               one  of  the  following  values:  <b>"next"</b>, <b>"prev"</b>, and <b>"default"</b>.  It should be noted here that in
               general, the installed colormap is determined by keyboard focus.  A pointer driven keyboard focus
               will install a private colormap upon entry of the window owning the colormap.  Using the click to
               type model, private colormaps will not be installed until the user presses a mouse button on  the
               target window.

       <b>f.deiconify</b>
               This  function deiconifies the selected window.  If the window is not an icon, this function does
               nothing.

       <b>f.delete</b>
               This function sends the WM_DELETE_WINDOW message to the selected window if the client application
               has requested it through the WM_PROTOCOLS  window  property.   The  application  is  supposed  to
               respond  to  the  message  by  removing  the  indicated  window.  If the window has not requested
               WM_DELETE_WINDOW messages, the keyboard bell will be rung indicating that the user should  choose
               an alternative method.  Note this is very different from f.destroy.  The intent here is to delete
               a single window,  not necessarily the entire application.

       <b>f.deltastop</b>
               This  function  allows  a  user-defined function to be aborted if the pointer has been moved more
               than <u>MoveDelta</u> pixels.  See the example definition given  for  <b>Function</b>  <b>"move-or-raise"</b>  at  the
               beginning of the section.

       <b>f.destroy</b>
               This  function  instructs the X server to close the display connection of the client that created
               the selected window.  This should only be used  as  a  last  resort  for  shutting  down  runaway
               clients.  See also f.delete.

       <b>f.downiconmgr</b>
               This  function  warps  the  pointer  to  the next row in the current icon manger, wrapping to the
               beginning of the next column if necessary.

       <b>f.exec</b> <u>string</u>
               This function passes the argument <u>string</u> to <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>  for  execution.   In  multiscreen  mode,  if
               <u>string</u>  starts  a  new  X client without giving a display argument, the client will appear on the
               screen from which this function was invoked.

       <b>f.focus</b> This function toggles the keyboard focus of the server to the selected window, changing the focus
               rule from pointer-driven if necessary.  If the selected window already was focused, this function
               executes an <b>f.unfocus</b>.

       <b>f.forcemove</b>
               This function is like <b>f.move</b> except that it ignores the <b>DontMoveOff</b> variable.

       <b>f.forwiconmgr</b>
               This function warps the pointer to the next column in the current icon manager, wrapping  to  the
               beginning of the next row if necessary.

       <b>f.fullzoom</b>
               This  function  resizes  the selected window to the full size of the display or else restores the
               original size if the window was already zoomed.

       <b>f.function</b> <u>string</u>
               This function executes the user-defined function whose name is specified by the argument <u>string</u>.

       <b>f.hbzoom</b>
               This function is a synonym for <b>f.bottomzoom</b>.

       <b>f.hideiconmgr</b>
               This function unmaps the current icon manager.

       <b>f.horizoom</b>
               This variable is similar to the <b>f.zoom</b> function except that the selected window is resized to the
               full width of the display.

       <b>f.htzoom</b>
               This function is a synonym for <b>f.topzoom</b>.

       <b>f.hzoom</b> This function is a synonym for <b>f.horizoom</b>.

       <b>f.iconify</b>
               This function iconifies or deiconifies the selected window or icon, respectively.

       <b>f.identify</b>
               This function displays a summary of the name and geometry of the selected window.  If the  server
               supports  the  SYNC  extension,  the  priority of the client owning the window is also displayed.
               Clicking the pointer or pressing a key in the window will dismiss it.

       <b>f.lefticonmgr</b>
               This function similar to <b>f.backiconmgr</b> except that wrapping does not change rows.

       <b>f.leftzoom</b>
               This variable is similar to the <b>f.bottomzoom</b> function but causes  the  selected  window  is  only
               resized to the left half of the display.

       <b>f.lower</b> This function lowers the selected window.

       <b>f.menu</b> <u>string</u>
               This  function invokes the menu specified by the argument <u>string</u>.  Cascaded menus may be built by
               nesting calls to <b>f.menu</b>.

       <b>f.move</b>  This function drags an outline of the selected window (or the window  itself  if  the  <b>OpaqueMove</b>
               variable  is  set)  until  the  invoking  pointer button is released.  Double clicking within the
               number of milliseconds given by <b>ConstrainedMoveTime</b> warps the pointer to the center of the window
               and constrains the move to be either horizontal or vertical  depending  on  which  grid  line  is
               crossed.  To abort a move, press another button before releasing the first button.

       <b>f.nexticonmgr</b>
               This function warps the pointer to the next icon manager containing any windows on the current or
               any succeeding screen.

       <b>f.nop</b>   This  function  does  nothing  and  is  typically used with the <b>DefaultFunction</b> or <b>WindowFunction</b>
               variables or to introduce blank lines in menus.

       <b>f.previconmgr</b>
               This function warps the pointer to the previous  icon  manager  containing  any  windows  on  the
               current or preceding screens.

       <b>f.priority</b> <u>string</u>
               This  function sets the priority of the client owning the selected window to the numeric value of
               the argument <u>string</u>, which should be a signed integer in  double  quotes  (e.g.  "999"  ).   This
               function has an effect only if the server supports the SYNC extension.

       <b>f.quit</b>  This  function  causes  <u>twm</u> to restore the window's borders and exit.  If <u>twm</u> is the first client
               invoked from <u>xdm</u>, this will result in a server reset.

       <b>f.raise</b> This function raises the selected window.

       <b>f.raiselower</b>
               This function raises the selected window to the top of the stacking order if it  is  occluded  by
               any windows, otherwise the window will be lowered.

       <b>f.refresh</b>
               This function causes all windows to be refreshed.

       <b>f.resize</b>
               This  function  displays  an  outline  of  the  selected  window.   Crossing a border (or setting
               <b>AutoRelativeResize</b>) will cause the outline to begin to rubber band until the invoking  button  is
               released.  To abort a resize, press another button before releasing the first button.

       <b>f.restart</b>
               This function kills and restarts <u>twm</u>.

       <b>f.startwm</b> <u>string</u>
               This function kills <u>twm</u> and starts another window manager, as specified by <u>string</u>.

       <b>f.righticonmgr</b>
               This function is similar to <b>f.nexticonmgr</b> except that wrapping does not change rows.

       <b>f.rightzoom</b>
               This  variable  is  similar  to the <b>f.bottomzoom</b> function except that the selected window is only
               resized to the right half of the display.

       <b>f.saveyourself</b>
               This function sends a WM_SAVEYOURSELF message to the selected window  if  it  has  requested  the
               message  in  its  WM_PROTOCOLS window property.  Clients that accept this message are supposed to
               checkpoint all state associated with the window and update the WM_COMMAND property  as  specified
               in  the  ICCCM.  If the selected window has not selected for this message, the keyboard bell will
               be rung.

       <b>f.showiconmgr</b>
               This function maps the current icon manager.

       <b>f.sorticonmgr</b>
               This function sorts the entries in the current icon manager  alphabetically.   See  the  variable
               <b>SortIconManager</b>.

       <b>f.title</b> This function provides a centered, unselectable item in a menu definition.  It should not be used
               in any other context.

       <b>f.topzoom</b>
               This  variable  is  similar  to the <b>f.bottomzoom</b> function except that the selected window is only
               resized to the top half of the display.

       <b>f.unfocus</b>
               This function resets the focus back to pointer-driven.  This should be used when a focused window
               is no longer desired.

       <b>f.upiconmgr</b>
               This function warps the pointer to the previous row in the current icon manager, wrapping to  the
               last row in the same column if necessary.

       <b>f.vlzoom</b>
               This function is a synonym for <b>f.leftzoom</b>.

       <b>f.vrzoom</b>
               This function is a synonym for <b>f.rightzoom</b>.

       <b>f.warpring</b> <u>string</u>
               This  function  warps  the  pointer  to the next or previous window (as indicated by the argument
               <u>string</u>, which may be <b>"next"</b> or <b>"prev"</b>) specified in the <b>WindowRing</b> variable.

       <b>f.warpto</b> <u>string</u>
               This function warps the pointer to the window which has a name or class that matches <u>string</u>.   If
               the  window  is  iconified,  it  will  be deiconified if the variable <b>WarpUnmapped</b> is set or else
               ignored.

       <b>f.warptoiconmgr</b> <u>string</u>
               This function warps the pointer to the icon manager entry associated with the  window  containing
               the  pointer in the icon manager specified by the argument <u>string</u>.  If <u>string</u> is empty (i.e. ""),
               the current icon manager is chosen.

       <b>f.warptoscreen</b> <u>string</u>
               This function warps the pointer to the screen specified by the argument <u>string</u>.  <u>String</u> may be  a
               number  (e.g.  <b>"0"</b>  or <b>"1"</b>), the word <b>"next"</b> (indicating the current screen plus 1, skipping over
               any unmanaged screens), the word <b>"back"</b> (indicating the current screen minus 1, skipping over any
               unmanaged screens), or the word <b>"prev"</b> (indicating the last screen visited.

       <b>f.winrefresh</b>
               This function is similar to the <b>f.refresh</b> function  except  that  only  the  selected  window  is
               refreshed.

       <b>f.zoom</b>  This  function  is  similar  to  the  <b>f.fullzoom</b> function, except that the only the height of the
               selected window is changed.

</pre><h4><b>MENUS</b></h4><pre>
       Functions may be grouped and interactively selected using pop-up (when bound  to  a  pointer  button)  or
       pull-down  (when  associated with a titlebutton) menus.  Each menu specification contains the name of the
       menu as it will be referred to by <b>f.menu</b>, optional default foreground and background colors, the list  of
       item  names  and  the  functions  they  should  invoke, and optional foreground and background colors for
       individual items:
       <b>Menu</b> "<u>menuname</u>" [ ("<u>deffore</u>":"<u>defback</u>") ]
       {
               <u>string1</u>   [ ("<u>fore1</u>":"<u>backn</u>")]        <u>function1</u>
               <u>string2</u>   [ ("<u>fore2</u>":"<u>backn</u>")]        <u>function2</u>
                       .
                       .
                       .
               <u>stringN</u>   [ ("<u>foreN</u>":"<u>backN</u>")]        <u>functionN</u>
       }

       The <u>menuname</u> is case-sensitive.  The optional <u>deffore</u> and <u>defback</u> arguments specify  the  foreground  and
       background  colors  used  on  a color display to highlight menu entries.  The <u>string</u> portion of each menu
       entry will be the text which will appear in the menu.  The optional <u>fore</u> and <u>back</u> arguments  specify  the
       foreground  and  background  colors of the menu entry when the pointer is not in the entry.  These colors
       will only be used on a color display.  The default is to use the colors specified by  the  <b>MenuForeground</b>
       and  <b>MenuBackground</b> variables.  The <u>function</u> portion of the menu entry is one of the functions, including
       any user-defined functions, or additional menus.

       There is a special menu named <b>TwmWindows</b> which contains the names of all of the client  and  <u>twm</u>-supplied
       windows.   Selecting  an  entry  will  cause  the  <b>WindowFunction</b>  to  be  executed  on  that window.  If
       <b>WindowFunction</b> hasn't been set, the window will be deiconified and raised.

</pre><h4><b>ICONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Twm</u> supports several different ways of manipulating iconified windows.  The common pixmap-and-text  style
       may  be laid out by hand or automatically arranged as described by the <b>IconRegion</b> variable.  In addition,
       a terse grid of icon names, called an icon manager, provides a more efficient use of screen space as well
       as the ability to navigate among windows from the keyboard.

       An icon manager is a window that contains names of selected or all windows currently on the display.   In
       addition  to  the  window  name, a small button using the default iconify symbol will be displayed to the
       left of the name when the window is iconified.  By default, clicking on an  entry  in  the  icon  manager
       performs  <b>f.iconify</b>.   To  change the actions taken in the icon manager, use the the <b>iconmgr</b> context when
       specifying button and keyboard bindings.

       Moving the pointer into the icon manager also directs keyboard focus to the indicated window (setting the
       focus explicitly or  else  sending  synthetic  events  <b>NoTitleFocus</b>  is  set).   Using  the  <b>f.upiconmgr</b>,
       <b>f.downiconmgr</b> <b>f.lefticonmgr</b>, and <b>f.righticonmgr</b> functions, the input focus can be changed between windows
       directly from the keyboard.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The resource manager should have been used instead of all of the window lists.

       The <b>IconRegion</b> variable should take a list.

       Double  clicking  very fast to get the constrained move function will sometimes cause the window to move,
       even though the pointer is not moved.

       If  <b>IconifyByUnmapping</b>  is  on   and   windows   are   listed   in   <b>IconManagerDontShow</b>   but   not   in
       <b>DontIconifyByUnmapping</b>,  they may be lost if they are iconified and no bindings to <b>f.menu</b> <b>"TwmWindows"</b> or
       <b>f.warpto</b> are setup.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$HOME/.twmrc.&lt;screen</u> <u>number&gt;</u>
       <u>$HOME/.twmrc</u>
       <u>/usr/lib/X11/twm/system.twmrc</u>

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       DISPLAY This variable is used to determine which X server to use.  It is also set during <b>f.exec</b>  so  that
               programs come up on the proper screen.

       HOME    This  variable  is  used as the prefix for files that begin with a tilde and for locating the <u>twm</u>
               startup file.
