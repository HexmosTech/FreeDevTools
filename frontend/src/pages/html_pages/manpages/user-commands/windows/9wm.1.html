       9wm - rio-like Window Manager for X

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>9wm</b>  [  <b>-border</b>  ] [ <b>-cursor</b> <u>cursor</u> ] [ <b>-version</b> ] [ <b>-font</b> <u>fname</u> ] [ <b>-term</b> <u>termprog</u> ] [ <b>-active</b> <u>color</u> ] [
       <b>-inactive</b> <u>color</u> ] [ <b>exit</b>|<b>restart</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>9wm</u> is a window manager for X which attempts to emulate the window management policies of  Plan  9's  <u>rio</u>
       window manager.

       <u>9wm</u>  is click-to-type: it has a notion of the current window, which is usually on top, and always has its
       border darkened.  Characters typed at the keyboard go to the current window, and mouse clicks outside the
       current window are swallowed up by <u>9wm</u>.  To make another window the current one, click on it with  button
       1.   Unlike  other  X  window  managers,  9wm implements `mouse focus': mouse events are sent only to the
       current window.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -border
              Shrinks the size of window borders to be more like Plan9.

       -cursor cursor
              Sets the cursor to one of two custom Plan9-style cursors: <u>v1</u> or <u>blit.</u>  Use this option for maximum
              authenticity.

       -font fname
              Sets the font in <u>9wm</u>'s menu to <u>fname</u>, overriding the default.

       -term termprog
              Specifies an alternative program to run when the <u>New</u> menu item is selected.

       -active color
              Sets the color of the active window border, which defaults to black.

       -inactive color
              Sets the color of the inactive window border, which defaults to white.

       -version
              Prints the current version on standard error, then exits.

</pre><h4><b>MENU</b></h4><pre>
       A menu of window operations is available by pressing button 3 outside the current window.

       New    attempts to spawn an <u>xterm</u> process (unless the <b>-term</b> argument is used).

       All of the next operations change the cursor into a target, prompting the user to click button 3  on  one
       of  the  windows  to  select  it for the operation.  At this stage, clicking button 1 or 2 will abort the
       operation.

       Resize The user is prompted to sweep out the new outline with button 3.

       Move   The user should keep the button held down after the initial click that selected  the  window,  and
              drag the window to the right place before releasing.  In either case, button 1 or 2 will abort the
              operation.

       Delete The window will be deleted when the button is released.  This typically kills the client that owns
              the window.

       Hide   Makes the window invisible.  While hidden, the window's name appears on the bottom of the button 3
              menu.   Selecting  that  item  brings  the  window back (unhides it).  This operation replaces the
              iconification feature provided by other window managers.

       To make <u>9wm</u> exit, you have to run <b>9wm</b> <b>exit</b> on the command line.  There is no ``exit'' menu item.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Is not completely compatible with rio.

       There is a currently a compiled-in limit of 32 hidden windows.
