       pamx - display Netpbm image in X Window System window

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pamx</b>

       [<b>-fullscreen</b>]  [<b>-install</b>]  [<b>-private</b>]  [<b>-fit</b>]  [<b>-pixmap</b>]  [<b>-verbose</b>]  [<b>-display=</b><u>x-display</u>]  [<b>-title=</b><u>text</u>]
       [<b>-foreground=</b><u>color</u>]  [<b>-background=</b><u>color</u>]  [<b>-border=</b><u>color</u>]  [<b>-geometry=</b><u>x-geometry-string</u>]   [<b>-visual=</b><u>name</u>]
       <u>netpbm_file</u>

       All  options  can be abbreviated to their shortest unique prefix.  You may use two hyphens instead of one
       to designate an option.  You may use either white space or an equals sign between an option name and  its
       value.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pamx</b>  displays  a  Netpbm  image  in  an X Window System window.  It is like a very simple version of the
       classic X image viewer <b>xloadimage</b>.

       If you don't specify the input file <u>netpbm_file</u>, the input is from Standard Input.  The input  image  can
       be any Netpbm image format.  If the input is a multi-image stream, <b>pamx</b> ignores all but the first image.

       <b>pamx</b>  is  not  the  best choice for general purpose viewing of images, because it is a traditional simple
       Netpbm building block.  It is a good thing to build into other programs and can be useful  for  debugging
       more  complex  systems,  but  you can get much more powerful viewers that can display Netpbm images.  For
       example, <b>xloadimage</b>, <b>xli</b>, <b>xzgv</b>, and any web browser.

       The program <b>xwud</b> (X Window Undump) is part of the X Window System and performs  the  same  basic  display
       function, though with input in the special X Window Dump format (for which Netpbm has converters).

       The initial window is at most 90% of the size of the display unless the window manager does not correctly
       handle  window  size requests or if you've used the <b>-fullscreen</b> option.  You may move the image around in
       the window by dragging with the first mouse button.  The cursor will indicate which  directions  you  may
       drag,  if  any.   You  may  exit  the window by typing 'q' or control-C when the keyboard focus is on the
       window.

       <b>ppmsvgalib</b> is a similar program that displays an image on a Linux system  without  the  need  for  the  X
       Window System.

</pre><h4><b>X</b> <b>RESOURCE</b> <b>CLASS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pamx</b>  uses the resource class name <b>Xloadimage</b> for window managers which need this resource set.  This is,
       of course, the same resource class that the conventional viewer program <b>xloadimage</b> uses.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably  <b>-quiet</b>,  see   Common
       Options ), <b>pamx</b> recognizes the following command line options:

       <b>-border=</b><u>color</u>
              This sets the background portion of the window which is not covered by any images to be <u>color</u>.

       <b>-display=</b><u>display_name</u>
              This names the X display in which to put the window.  E.g. <b>0:0</b>.

       <b>-fit</b>   Force image to use the default visual and colormap.  This is useful if you do not want technicolor
              effects  when  the colormap focus is inside the image window, but it may reduce the quality of the
              displayed image.

       <b>-fullscreen</b>
              Use the entire screen to display the image.

       <b>-geometry=</b><u>W</u><b>x</b><u>H</u>[{<b>+</b>,<b>-</b>}<u>X</u>{<b>+</b>,<b>-</b>}<u>Y</u>
              This sets the size and position of the window in which <b>pamx</b> displays the image.

              By default, the window size exactly matches the image size,  except  that  if  you  don't  specify
              <b>-fullscreen</b>, the maximum is 90% of the screen dimensions.

       <b>-install</b>
              Forcibly  install  the image's colormap when the window is focused.  This violates ICCCM standards
              and only exists to allow operation with naive window managers.   Use  this  option  only  if  your
              window manager does not install colormaps properly.

       <b>-pixmap</b>
              Force  the  use of a pixmap as backing-store.  This is provided for servers where backing-store is
              broken (such as some versions of the AIXWindows server).  It may improve scrolling performance  on
              servers which provide backing-store.

       <b>-private</b>
              Force  <b>pamx</b>  to  use of a private colormap.  By default, <b>pamx</b> allocates colors shared unless there
              are not enough colors available.

       <b>-verbose</b>
              Causes <b>pamx</b> to print various information about what it's doing to Standard Error.

       <b>-visual=</b><u>visual_name</u>
              Force the use of a specific visual type to display an image.  By default, <b>pamx</b> tries to  pick  the
              best  available  image  for a particular image type.  The available visual types are: <b>DirectColor</b>,
              <b>TrueColor</b>, <b>PseudoColor</b>, <b>StaticColor</b>, <b>GrayScale</b>, and <b>StaticGray</b>.  You may use the  shortest  unique
              prefix of these names, and case is not significant.

       <b>-background=</b><u>color</u>
              Use  <u>color</u>  as  the background color instead of the default (usually white but this depends on the
              image type) if you are transferring a monochrome image to a color display.

       <b>-foreground=</b><u>color</u>
              Use <u>color</u> as the foreground color instead of black if you are transferring a monochrome image to a
              color display.  You can also use this  to  invert  the  foreground  and  background  colors  of  a
              monochrome image.

       <b>-title=</b><u>text</u>
              Set  the title bar title of the window.  Default is the file name of the input file, or "stdin" if
              the image is from Standard Input.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pamx</b> was new in Netpbm 10.34 (May 2006).

       <b>pamx</b> is essentially based on the classic X displayer  program  <b>xloadimage</b>  by  Jim  Frost,  1989.   Bryan
       Henderson stripped it down and adapted it to Netpbm in March 2006.

       The following features of <b>xloadimage</b> are left out of <b>pamx</b>, to be more compatible with Netpbm's philosophy
       of simple building blocks.  Note that there are other programs in Netpbm that do most of these things:

       •      zoom in/out

       •      ability to accept formats other than Netpbm

       •      image transformations (brightening, clipping, rotating, etc)

       •      decompressing and other decoding of input

       •      ability to display on the root window

       •      slide show

              <b>pamx</b> also differs from <b>xloadimage</b> in that it uses Libnetpbm.

       There  is  virtually  no  code  from <b>xloadimage</b> actually in <b>pamx</b>, because Bryan rewrote it all to make it
       easier to understand.
