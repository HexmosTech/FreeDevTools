</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xlax - X window system program to send keyboard input to multiple windows

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xlax</b> [-find] [-prefix <u>string</u>] [-<u>toolkit</u> <u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xlax</u>  is  an  X  Window  System  program  that  will send keyboard input it receives to multiple selected
       windows.  When run, <u>Xlax</u> will bring up its main window.  There will be six buttons on  it,  "Quit",  "Add
       Windows", "Find xlax:", "Send String", "Paste", and "Kill Window."

       "Quit" will terminate <u>xlax</u> and "Add windows" will change the cursor to a cross-hair and allow the user to
       select  any window on the screen by pressing a mouse button.  The user will be able to continue selecting
       windows until either the <u>xlax</u> window or a window that has already been selected, is selected.

       When a window is selected, its name will appear in the <u>xlax</u> window.  Clicking the  mouse  on  the  window
       name  will  toggle  whether  that  window should receive input.  When the user types anywhere in the <u>xlax</u>
       window, those keystrokes will be sent to all selected windows.

       "Kill Window" will allow the user to select a window and remove it from <u>xlax's</u> list (note: the user  must
       click on the actual window, not the name that appears in <u>xlax).</u>

       There  is  a window to the right of each name, which may display text assigned to this window name.  When
       "Send String" is selected, the specific string associated with each window will be sent to those windows.
       Clicking the first mouse button in this area will bring up a popup window that allows you to  change  the
       assigned  text.   Up  to  150  characters  are  allowed.   The  software records all characters including
       backspace and carriage return, so there is no editing this field -- if  you  make  a  mistake,  click  on
       "Clear" to start over.

       The "Paste" button sends the currently (or most recently) selected text to all active windows.

       The "Find xlax:" button searches all X11 windows for those with a class hint that begins with "xlax:" (or
       alternately,  a  string  specified  by  the  user  with  the  -prefix  option).   These windows are added
       automatically, and their sendstring is automatically set to whatever follows "xlax:"  (or  the  alternate
       prefix value).

       This  tool  tends  to  be useful for system administration tasks that require almost the same thing to be
       done in several different windows, but require  some  human  intervention  (e.g.  some  tape  backups  or
       building  multiple servers).  The string area is useful for machine or platform specific strings (such as
       machine names or machine type).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This starts up three xterms, and then xlax automatically finds them.
              example% xterm -xrm 'XTerm*allowSendEvents: true' -name xlax:string1 &amp;
              [1] 555
              example% xterm -xrm 'XTerm*allowSendEvents: true' -name xlax:string2 &amp;
              [2] 556
              example% xterm -xrm 'XTerm*allowSendEvents: true' -name xlax:string3 &amp;
              [3] 557
              example% xlax -find

       If you want more than one xlax, to automatically find different windows, specify a different prefix:
              example% xterm -xrm 'XTerm*allowSendEvents: true' -name foo:string1 &amp;
              [1] 555
              example% xterm -xrm 'XTerm*allowSendEvents: true' -name foo:string2 &amp;
              [2] 556
              example% xterm -xrm 'XTerm*allowSendEvents: true' -name bar:string3 &amp;
              [3] 557
              example% xterm -xrm 'XTerm*allowSendEvents: true' -name bar:string3 &amp;
              [4] 558
              example% xlax -prefix foo: -find &amp;
              [5] 559
              example% xlax -prefix bar: -find &amp;
              [6] 560

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b> To get default host and display number.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       For <u>xlax</u> to work on an xterm, "allowSendEvents" must be enabled on the xterm.  Note that this means  that
       anyone  can  send  keystrokes  to  that  xterm,  so  this should not be run in an insecure or unmonitored
       environment.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Probably something, but nothing that comes to mind.
