</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wine - run Windows programs on Unix

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wine</b> <u>program</u> [<u>arguments</u>]
       <b>wine</b> <b>--help</b>
       <b>wine</b> <b>--version</b>

       For  instructions  on  passing arguments to Windows programs, please see the <b>PROGRAM/ARGUMENTS</b> section of
       the man page.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wine</b> loads and runs the given program, which can be a DOS, Windows 3.x, Win32  or  Win64  executable  (on
       64-bit systems).

       For debugging wine, use <b>winedbg</b> instead.

       For  running  CUI  executables  (Windows  console  programs), use <b>wineconsole</b> instead of <b>wine</b>.  This will
       display the output in a separate window. Not using <b>wineconsole</b> for CUI programs will  only  provide  very
       limited console support, and your program might not function properly.

       When  invoked  with <b>--help</b> or <b>--version</b> as the only argument, <b>wine</b> will simply print a small help message
       or its version respectively and exit.

</pre><h4><b>PROGRAM/ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The  program  name  may  be  specified  in  DOS  format  (<u>C:\\WINDOWS\\SOL.EXE</u>)   or   in   Unix   format
       (<u>/msdos/windows/sol.exe</u>).  You may pass arguments to the program being executed by adding them to the end
       of  the  command  line invoking <b>wine</b> (such as: <u>wine</u> <u>notepad</u> <u>C:\\TEMP\\README.TXT</u>).  Note that you need to
       '\' escape special characters (and spaces) when invoking Wine via a shell, e.g.

       wine C:\\Program\ Files\\MyPrg\\test.exe

       It can also be one of the Windows executables shipped with Wine, in which case specifying the  full  path
       is not mandatory, e.g. <u>wine</u> <u>explorer</u> or <u>wine</u> <u>notepad</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wine</b>  makes the environment variables of the shell from which it is started accessible to the Windows/DOS
       processes started. So use the appropriate syntax for your shell to enter environment variables you need.

       <b>WINEPREFIX</b>
              If set, the contents of this variable is taken as the name of the directory where Wine stores  its
              data  (the  default  is <u>$HOME/.wine</u>).  This directory is also used to identify the socket which is
              used to communicate with the <b>wineserver</b>.  All <b>wine</b> processes using the same <b>wineserver</b> (i.e.: same
              user) share certain things like registry, shared memory, and config file.  By  setting  <b>WINEPREFIX</b>
              to  different  values  for  different  <b>wine</b>  processes,  it  is  possible to run a number of truly
              independent <b>wine</b> processes.

       <b>WINESERVER</b>
              Specifies the path and name of  the  <b>wineserver</b>  binary.  If  not  set,  Wine  will  try  to  load
              <u>/usr/lib/wine-development/wineserver</u>, and if this doesn't exist it will then look for a file named
              "wineserver" in the path and in a few other likely locations.

       <b>WINELOADER</b>
              Specifies the path and name of the <b>wine</b> binary to use to launch new Windows processes. If not set,
              Wine  will try to load <u>/usr/lib/wine-development/wine</u>, and if this doesn't exist it will then look
              for a file named "wine" in the path and in a few other likely locations.

       <b>WINEDEBUG</b>
              Turns  debugging  messages  on  or  off.  The  syntax   of   the   variable   is   of   the   form
              [<u>class</u>][<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<u>channel</u>[,[<u>class2</u>][<b>+</b>|<b>-</b>]<u>channel2</u>]

              <u>class</u>  is  optional  and can be one of the following: <b>err</b>, <b>warn</b>, <b>fixme</b>, or <b>trace</b>.  If <u>class</u> is not
              specified, all debugging messages for the specified channel are  turned  on.   Each  channel  will
              print messages about a particular component of Wine.  The following character can be either <b>+</b> or <b>-</b>
              to  switch  the  specified channel on or off respectively.  If there is no <u>class</u> part before it, a
              leading <b>+</b> can be omitted. Note that spaces are not allowed anywhere in the string.

              Examples:

              WINEDEBUG=warn+all
                     will turn on all warning messages (recommended for debugging).

              WINEDEBUG=warn+dll,+heap
                     will turn on DLL warning messages and all heap messages.

              WINEDEBUG=fixme-all,warn+cursor,+relay
                     will turn off all FIXME messages, turn on cursor warning messages, and turn  on  all  relay
                     messages (API calls).

              WINEDEBUG=relay
                     will  turn  on all relay messages. For more control on including or excluding functions and
                     dlls from the relay trace, look  into  the  <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Wine\Debug</b>  registry
                     key.

              For more information on debugging messages, see the <u>Running</u> <u>Wine</u> chapter of the Wine User Guide.

       <b>WINEDLLPATH</b>
              Specifies the path(s) in which to search for builtin dlls and Winelib applications. This is a list
              of  directories separated by ":". In addition to any directory specified in <b>WINEDLLPATH</b>, Wine will
              also look in <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/wine-development</u>.

       <b>WINEDLLOVERRIDES</b>
              Defines the override type and load order of dlls used in the loading process for  any  dll.  There
              are  currently  two  types  of  libraries  that can be loaded into a process address space: native
              windows dlls (<u>native</u>) and Wine internal dlls (<u>builtin</u>).  The type  may  be  abbreviated  with  the
              first letter of the type (<u>n</u> or <u>b</u>).  The library may also be disabled (''). Each sequence of orders
              must be separated by commas.

              Each  dll may have its own specific load order. The load order determines which version of the dll
              is attempted to be loaded into the address space. If the first fails, then the next is  tried  and
              so  on.  Multiple  libraries  with  the  same  load order can be separated with commas. It is also
              possible to use specify different loadorders for different libraries by separating the entries  by
              ";".

              The  load  order  for  a  16-bit  dll  is  always defined by the load order of the 32-bit dll that
              contains it (which can be identified by looking at the symbolic link of the 16-bit .dll.so  file).
              For  instance  if  <u>ole32.dll</u>  is configured as builtin, <u>storage.dll</u> will be loaded as builtin too,
              since the 32-bit <u>ole32.dll</u> contains the 16-bit <u>storage.dll</u>.

              Examples:

              WINEDLLOVERRIDES="comdlg32,shell32=n,b"
                     Try to load comdlg32 and shell32 as native windows dll first and try the builtin version if
                     the native load fails.

              WINEDLLOVERRIDES="comdlg32,shell32=n;c:\\foo\\bar\\baz=b"
                     Try to load the libraries comdlg32 and shell32 as native windows dlls. Furthermore,  if  an
                     application request to load <u>c:\foo\bar\baz.dll</u> load the builtin library <u>baz</u>.

              WINEDLLOVERRIDES="comdlg32=b,n;shell32=b;comctl32=n;oleaut32="
                     Try to load comdlg32 as builtin first and try the native version if the builtin load fails;
                     load shell32 always as builtin and comctl32 always as native; oleaut32 will be disabled.

       <b>WINEPATH</b>
              Specifies  additional  path(s)  to  be prepended to the default Windows <b>PATH</b> environment variable.
              This is a list of Windows-style directories separated by ";".

              For  a  permanent  alternative,   edit   (create   if   needed)   the   <b>PATH</b>   value   under   the
              <b>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment</b> registry key.

       <b>WINEARCH</b>
              Specifies  the Windows architecture to support. It can be set either to <b>win32</b> (support only 32-bit
              applications), or to <b>win64</b> (support both 64-bit applications and 32-bit ones in WoW64 mode).
              The architecture supported by a given Wine prefix is set at prefix creation  time  and  cannot  be
              changed  afterwards.  When  running with an existing prefix, Wine will refuse to start if <b>WINEARCH</b>
              doesn't match the prefix architecture.

       <b>DISPLAY</b>
              Specifies the X11 display to use.

       OSS sound driver configuration variables:

       <b>AUDIODEV</b>
              Set the device for audio input / output. Default <u>/dev/dsp</u>.

       <b>MIXERDEV</b>
              Set the device for mixer controls. Default <u>/dev/mixer</u>.

       <b>MIDIDEV</b>
              Set the MIDI (sequencer) device. Default <u>/dev/sequencer</u>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/usr/lib/wine-development/wine</u>
              The Wine program loader.

       <u>/usr/lib/wine-development/wineconsole</u>
              The Wine program loader for CUI (console) applications.

       <u>/usr/lib/wine-development/wineserver</u>
              The Wine server

       <u>/usr/lib/wine-development/winedbg</u>
              The Wine debugger

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/wine-development</u>
              Directory containing Wine shared libraries

       <u>$WINEPREFIX/dosdevices</u>
              Directory containing the DOS device mappings. Each file in that directory is a symlink to the Unix
              device file implementing a given device. For instance, if COM1 is mapped to <u>/dev/ttyS0</u> you'd  have
              a symlink of the form <u>$WINEPREFIX/dosdevices/com1</u> -&gt; <u>/dev/ttyS0</u>.
              DOS  drives  are  also  specified with symlinks; for instance if drive D: corresponds to the CDROM
              mounted at <u>/mnt/cdrom</u>, you'd have a symlink  <u>$WINEPREFIX/dosdevices/d:</u>  -&gt;  <u>/mnt/cdrom</u>.  The  Unix
              device  corresponding  to  a  DOS drive can be specified the same way, except with '::' instead of
              ':'. So for the previous example, if the CDROM device is mounted from <u>/dev/hdc</u>, the  corresponding
              symlink would be <u>$WINEPREFIX/dosdevices/d::</u> -&gt; <u>/dev/hdc</u>.
