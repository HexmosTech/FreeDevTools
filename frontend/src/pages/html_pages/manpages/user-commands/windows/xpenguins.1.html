</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xpenguins - cute little penguins that walk along the tops of your windows

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xpenguins</b> [-option ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>XPenguins</u>  is  a  program for animating cute cartoons/animals in your root window.  By default it will be
       penguins - they drop in from the top of the screen, walk along the tops of your windows, up the  side  of
       your  windows,  levitate,  skateboard,  and  do other similarly exciting things. Be careful when you move
       windows as the little guys squash easily.  <u>XPenguins</u> is now themeable, so it is easy to select  something
       else  to  animate  instead  of penguins, or even (with a little artistic talent) define your own; see the
       <b>THEMES</b> section below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In all the following cases a double dash can be replaced by a single dash.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--no-angels</b>
               Do not show any cherubim flying up to heaven when a toon gets squashed.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--no-blood</b>
               Do not show any gory death sequences.

       <b>-c</b> <u>dir</u><b>,</b> <b>--config-dir</b> <u>dir</u>
               Look for config files and themes in this directory. The default is usually <u>/usr/share/xpenguins</u>.

       <b>-d</b> <u>display</u><b>,</b> <b>--display</b> <u>display</u>
               Send the toons to the specified X display. In the absence of this option, the  display  specified
               by the <b>DISPLAY</b> environment variable is used.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
               Print out a message describing the available options.

       <b>--defaults</b>
               Skip reading from <a href="file:~/.xpenguinrc">~/.xpenguinrc</a>

       <b>--nomenu</b>
               Do not show menu

       <b>--nodoublebuffer</b>
               Do not use double buffering

       <b>--hidemenu</b>
               Iconify menu at startup

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--theme-info</b>
               Print out the auxiliary information about a theme and exit. Use the <b>-t</b> option to select the theme
               to describe.

       <b>--random-theme</b>
               Start with a random theme.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--list-themes</b>
               List the available themes, one on each line, and exit.

       <b>-m</b> <u>delay</u><b>,</b> <b>--delay</b> <u>delay</u>
               Set the delay between each frame in milliseconds. The default is defined by the theme.

       <b>-n</b> <u>number</u><b>,</b> <b>--penguins</b> <u>number</u>
               The number of toons to start, up to a maximum of 512. The default is defined by the theme.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--ignorepopups</b>
               Toons  fall  through `popup' windows (those with the save-under attribute set), such as tooltips.
               Note that this also includes the KDE panel.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--rectwin</b>
               Toons regard all windows as rectangular. This option results  in  faster  calculation  of  window
               positions,  but  if  you use one of those fancy new window managers with shaped windows then your
               toons might sometimes look like they're walking on thin air.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--squish</b>
               Enable the penguins to be squished using any of the mouse buttons. Note that  this  disables  any
               existing function of the mouse buttons on the root window.

       <b>--lift</b>  <b>number</b>
               Lift penguins window number pixels, e.g. to keep above a panel.

       <b>-t</b> <u>theme</u><b>,</b> <b>--theme</b> <u>theme</u>
               Use  the  named theme. The default is <b>Penguins</b>.  If the theme has spaces in its name then you can
               use underscores instead, or alternatively just put the name in double quotes. This option can  be
               called multiple times to run several themes simultaneously.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
               Suppress the exit message when an interrupt is received.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
               Print out the current version number and quit.

       <b>--all</b>   Load all available themes and run them simultaneously.

       <b>--id</b> <u>window</u>
               Send  toons  to  the  window  with  this  ID,  instead  of the root window or whichever window is
               appropriate for the current desktop environment. Note that  the  ID  of  X  clients  reported  by
               <u>xwininfo</u> is rarely that of the foremost visible window that should be used here.

       <b>--nice</b> <u>loadaverage1</u> <u>loadaverage2</u>
               Start  killing  toons  when  the 1-min averaged system load exceeds <u>loadaverage1</u>; when it exceeds
               <u>loadaverage2</u> kill them all. The toons will reappear when the load average comes down. The load is
               checked every 5 seconds by looking in <u><a href="file:/proc/loadavg">/proc/loadavg</a></u>, so this option only works under unices  that
               implement  this  particular  pseudo  file  (probably  just Linux). When there are no toons on the
               screen, <u>XPenguins</u> uses only a minuscule amount of CPU time - it just wakes up every 5 seconds  to
               recheck the load.

       <b>--changelog</b>
               Show ChangeLog

       <b>--selfrep</b>
               Put source in the form of a gzipped tar file on stdout.

</pre><h4><b>THEMES</b></h4><pre>
       The  system  themes  are  usually  kept  in  <u>/usr/share/xpenguins/themes</u>,  and  these can be augmented or
       overridden by the user's themes in <u>$HOME/.xpenguins/themes</u>.  Each theme has its own subdirectory which to
       be valid must contain a file called <u>config</u>.  The name of the theme is  taken  from  the  directory  name,
       although  because  many install scripts choke on directory names containing spaces, all spaces in a theme
       name are represented in the directory name by  underscores.  Any  directory  name  containing  spaces  is
       inaccessible by <u>xpenguins</u>.

       In  addition  to  the <u>config</u> file, the theme directory contains the toon images that make up the theme in
       the form of <u>xpm</u> <u>image</u> <u>files</u>.  Additionally, there should be an <u>about</u> file which gives information on  the
       creator  of  the  theme, the license under which it is distributed and various other things. This file is
       principally for use by <u>xpenguins_applet</u>, an applet for <u>GNOME</u> that allows different themes to be  selected
       at the click of a button.

       The  <u>config</u>  file  has  a  reasonably  straightforward  format.  You  can  either  read this rather terse
       description of it or you can have a look at the config file for the  default  <b>Penguins</b>  theme,  which  is
       usually installed at <u>/usr/share/xpenguins/themes/Penguins/config</u>, and is reasonably well commented. We'll
       first  establish some simple terminology. Say you have a Farmyard theme with cows and sheep. The cows and
       sheep are types of <b>toon</b>, while the various things they get up to (walking, mooing and so on)  are  termed
       <b>activities</b>.   Each <b>activity</b> has its own <u>xpm</u> <u>image</u> <u>file</u>, in which the <b>frames</b> of the animation are laid out
       horizontally. Some activities (notably walking) use different images depending on the <b>direction</b> the  toon
       is  moving  in.  In  this  case the frames for the two directions are laid out one above the other in the
       image.

       As in shell scripts, comments are initiated with the <b>#</b> character and hide the remainder of the line.  The
       format  is  entirely  free  except  that  there  is  an  arbitrary  limit  on the length of a line of 512
       characters.  Spaces, tabs and newlines all count equally as white space. Data is entered as a sequence of
       <b>key</b> <b>value</b> pairs, all separated by white space. Neither the <b>keys</b> nor the <b>values</b> are case sensitive, except
       where the <b>value</b> is a filename. The following <b>keys</b> are understood:

       <b>delay</b> <u>delay</u>
               Set the recommended delay between frames in milliseconds.

       <b>toon</b> <u>toon</u>
               Begin defining a new toon called <u>toon</u>.  If only one type of toon is present  in  the  theme  then
               this key may be omitted.

       <b>number</b> <u>number</u>
               Set the default number of toons of the current type to start.

       <b>define</b> <u>activity</u>
               Begin  defining an <u>activity</u> for the current toon. The currently understood activities are <b>walker</b>,
               <b>faller</b>, <b>tumbler</b>, <b>climber</b>, <b>floater</b>, <b>runner</b>, <b>explosion</b>, <b>squashed</b>, <b>zapped</b>, <b>splatted</b>, <b>angel</b>, <b>exit</b> and
               <b>action?</b>, where <b>?</b> is a number between <b>0</b> and <b>6</b>.  Once you've seen the program in action you  should
               be  able  to  guess  which  is  which.  A  valid theme must contain at least <b>walkers</b> and <b>fallers</b>.
               Additionally, you may define a default activity (with <b>define</b> <b>default</b>); any  properties  (such  as
               <b>width</b> and <b>speed</b>) set here are then adopted by the activities defined from then on, if they do not
               themselves  explicitly define those properties.  After an activity has been declared with <b>define</b>,
               the following properties may be assigned:

       <b>pixmap</b> <u>xpmfile</u>
               The file containing the image data for the activity. Note that you may not set a <b>default</b> pixmap.

       <b>width</b> <u>width</u>
               The width of each frame of the animation in pixels.

       <b>height</b> <u>height</u>
               The height of each frame of the animation in pixels.

       <b>frames</b> <u>frames</u>
               The number of frames in the animation.

       <b>directions</b> <u>directions</u>
               The number of directions for the activity (can be 1 or 2).

       <b>speed</b> <u>speed</u>
               The initial speed of the toon when engaged in this activity, in pixels per frame.

       <b>acceleration</b> <u>acceleration</u>
               The rate at which the speed increases, in pixels per frame squared. This property is not utilised
               by all activities.

       <b>terminal_velocity</b> <u>terminal_velocity</u>
               The maximum speed in pixels per frame, again not utilised by all activities.

       <b>loop</b> <u>loop</u>
               Only understood by the <b>actions</b>; indicates how many times to repeat the action. If negative,  then
               the probility of stopping the action every time the action is complete is -1/<u>loop</u>.

       Some  notes  regarding the various activities. If you design a new theme, feel free to make the <b>splatted</b>,
       <b>squashed</b>, <b>zapped</b> and <b>exit</b> animations as gory and bloody as  you  like,  but  please  keep  the  <b>explosion</b>
       activity  nice  and  tame; that way those of a nervous disposition can employ the <b>--no-blood</b> option which
       replaces all these violent deaths with a tasteful explosion that wouldn't offend  your  grandmother.  Xpm
       images  files  are  a factor of two smaller if you can limit the number of colours in the image such that
       only one character need be used to represent each colour; this also makes <u>XPenguins</u> start  up  much  more
       rapidly. Rarely are more than 64 colours required.

       So  that's  about it for the <u>config</u> file, now for the <u>about</u> file. This is very simple. Again comments are
       initialised by a <b>#</b>.  An entry consists of a <b>key</b> at the start of a line,  followed  by  the  corresponding
       <b>value</b>  which  is  read  up  to  the  next  newline.  The following <b>keys</b> are understood, although none are
       compulsory.

       <b>artist</b>  Used to list the artist(s) who created the original images.

       <b>maintainer</b>
               The person who compiled the images into an <u>XPenguins</u> theme. It is useful if an email address  can
               also be provided.

       <b>date</b>    The  date  when the theme was last modified. My preferred format is <u>day</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>month</u>, <u>name</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
               <u>month</u> <u>in</u> <u>english</u>, <u>full</u> <u>year</u>.  For example: 24 April 2001.

       <b>icon</b>    The name of an image file that can be used as an icon for the theme; XPM  and  PNG  are  suitable
               formats.

       <b>license</b> The name of the license under which the theme is distributed (e.g. GPL).

       <b>copyright</b>
               The year and holder of the copyright.

       <b>comment</b> Any other essential information, such as the theme's web site, as brief as possible.

               Please  test  any  <u>about</u>  files  you create by looking at how the information is displayed by the
               <u>xpenguins_applet</u> program.

       were taken from <u>Pingus</u>, a free lemmings clone that  can  be  found  at  &lt;<a href="http://pingus.seul.org/">http://pingus.seul.org/</a>&gt;;  these

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>XPenguins</u> can load an X server and/or network (although the CPU time used  is  small),  and  if  a  large
       number of penguins are spawned then they may begin to flicker, depending on the speed of the X server.

       The <u>xpenguins</u> homepage is located at:

       version &lt; 3.0: <a href="http://xpenguins.seul.org/">http://xpenguins.seul.org/</a>

       version         &gt;=         3.0:         https://www.ratrabbit.nl/ratrabbit/software/xpenguins         and
       https://sourceforge.net/projects/xpenguins/

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If there are icons drawn on the root window then the toons will erase them  when  they  walk  over  them,
       although an expose event will be sent to the window every second to redraw them.

       Since  version 3.0, <u>xpenguins</u> uses, if possible,  a transparent, click-through window to draw it's toons.
       The --squish flag does not function in this mode.

       The behaviour of the menu is not well defined when the same theme name is used more than once.
