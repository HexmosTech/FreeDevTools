</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       JWM - Joe's Window Manager

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jwm</b> [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       JWM is a window manager for the X11 Window System.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-display</b> <u>display</u>
              This option specifies the display to use; see <b><a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a></b>(1).

       <b>-exit</b>
              Exit JWM by sending _JWM_EXIT to the root window.

       <b>-f</b> <u>file</u>
              Specify an alternate configuration file to use.

       <b>-h</b>
              Display a help message and exit.

       <b>-p</b>
              Parse  the  configuration file and exit.  It is a good idea to use this after making modifications
              to the configuration file to ensure there are no errors.

       <b>-restart</b>
              Restart JWM by sending _JWM_RESTART to the root window.

       <b>-reload</b>
              Reload menus by sending _JWM_RELOAD to the root window.

       <b>-v</b>
              Display version information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/jwm/system.jwmrc
              The default JWM configuration file.

       <a href="file:~/.jwmrc">~/.jwmrc</a>
              Default local configuration file. Copy the default configuration file to  this  location  to  make
              user-specific changes.  See also, option <b>-f</b>.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>OVERVIEW</b>
              Configuration  of JWM is done by editing ".jwmrc" (or the configuration file specified with the <b>-f</b>
              option).  This file is XML making it easy  to  edit,  either  by  hand  or  programmatically.  The
              example.jwmrc  gives  an  example configuration file.  Before restarting JWM, it is a good idea to
              run "jwm -p" to make sure the configuration file is free of errors.   Otherwise  you  may  end  up
              without a root menu.

       <b>ROOT</b> <b>MENU</b>
              The  root  menu in JWM is the primary way of starting programs.  It also provides a way to restart
              or exit the window manager.  The  outer  most  tag  is  <b>RootMenu</b>.  The  following  attributes  are
              supported:

              <b>onroot</b> <u>list</u>
                     Determine  which  buttons on the root window activate the menu.  This is a list of integers
                     specifying buttons. The default is "123".  Note that multiple root menus may  be  specified
                     by  using  different  buttons  for  different menus. The range of possible values is <b>0</b> to <b>9</b>
                     inclusive as well as <b>a</b> to <b>z</b> inclusive, providing for up to 36 menus.  Note  that  only  the
                     numeric values map to mouse buttons.

              <b>height</b> <u>int</u>
                     Height  of  each  menu item in pixels. 0 indicates the largest menu item will determine the

              either be hex triplets in RGB format (for example, #FF0000 is red) or by a name recognized by  the
              X server.  For components that support gradients, two colors may be specified separated by a colon
              for a horizontal gradient or a semicolon for a vertical gradient.

       <b>ICONS</b>
              Icons for windows that don't supply an icon via the _NET_WM_ICON hint are located by searching the
              icon  search  path(s)  for  an  icon whose name (minus the ".xpm" or ".png" extension) matches the
              instance name of the window as returned in the WM_CLASS hint. If this lookup fails, a default icon
              is supplied. This icon will be displayed for the window on it's title bar and on  the  task  list.
              Icons that are not an appropriate size will be scaled. Square icons work best.

              For  menu items, the icon path is searched for a match. the icon specified for a menu item must be
              the exact name of the icon file with the extension.  If no match  is  found,  a  blank  area  will
              appear  where the icon should appear.  If an icon is not specified for any menu item in a menu, no
              space will be allocated for icons.

              Zero or more <b>IconPath</b> tags may be specified. The text of this tag is assumed  to  be  an  absolute
              directory  path  to a directory containing XPM, PNG, and/or JPEG icons.  When searching for icons,
              if multiple paths are provided, they will be searched in order until a match is made.   Note  that
              icon, PNG, JPEG, and XPM support are compile-time options.

       <b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b>
              Keyboard  bindings in JWM are specified in <b>Key</b> tags.  Either the <b>key</b> or <b>keycode</b> attributes must be
              specified to determine which key will cause an action. The  optional  attribute,  <b>mask</b>,  specifies
              what  key  mask,  if any, must be in effect for the binding to match. Finally, the text of the <b>Key</b>
              tag is the action to perform.  The last action to match is used if there are duplicates.

              One or more of the following key masks may be specified for <b>mask</b> (see <b><a href="../man1/xmodmap.1.html">xmodmap</a></b>(1)):

                     <b>A</b>      The "Alt" key (mod1).

                     <b>C</b>      Control

                     <b>3</b>      mod3

                     <b>4</b>      mod4

                     <b>5</b>      mod5

              The key specified in the <b>key</b> attribute must contain a valid  key  string  for  <b><a href="../man3/XStringToKeysym.3.html">XStringToKeysym</a></b>(3).
              These values are usually what one would expect (for example, the escape key is called "Escape").

              Note  that there are no default key bindings.  It is possible to bind multiple key combinations to
              the same action.

       <b>MOUSE</b> <b>BINDINGS</b>
              Mouse bindings are configured using <b>Mouse</b> tags.  The <b>context</b> attribute determines the  context  in
              which  the binding applies, the <b>button</b> attribute species the mouse button, and the (optional) <b>mask</b>
              attribute specifies the key mask that must be in effect for the binding to  match.   Finally,  the
              text  of  the <b>Mouse</b> tag determines the action to perform (see <b>KEY</b> <b>BINDINGS</b> for a list of actions).
              The <b>button</b> is a mouse button number, starting at <b>1</b> (typically the left button). A  positive  value
              for  the  button  indicates  that the action applies on mouse press and a negative value indicates
              that the action applies on release. The button number can be repeated to bind  to  double  clicks.
              The following mouse contexts are supported:

              <b>border</b>
                     The window border.

              <b>close</b>
                     The close button on a window.

              <b>icon</b>
                     The icon button on a window.

              <b>maximize</b>
                     The maximize button on a window.

              <b>minimize</b>
                     The minimize button on a window.

              <b>root</b>
                     The root window.

              <b>title</b>
                     The title bar of a window.

              Other bindings:

              Button 1 (typically the left button):
                     Over  a  task  bar,  restores  or  minimizes the window.  Over a pager, switches the active
                     desktop.

              Button 2 (typically the middle button):
                     Over a task bar, closes the window.  Over a pager, switches the active desktop.

              Button 3 (typically the right button):
                     Over a task bar, shows the window menu.  Over a pager, dragging while holding button 3 will
                     move a window.

              When a menu is open, the scroll wheel will move through menu items.   When  over  the  pager,  the
              scroll wheel will switch desktops.  When over a task list, the scroll wheel will switch windows.

       <b>DESKTOPS</b>
              Virtual desktops are controlled with the <b>Desktops</b> tag.  Within this tag the following attribute is
              supported:

              <b>width</b> <u>int</u>
                     The number of virtual desktops in the horizontal direction.  The default is 4.

              <b>height</b> <u>int</u>
                     The number of virtual desktops in the vertical direction.  The default is 1.

              <b>backandforth</b> <u>string</u>
                     Controls  whether  changing  the desktop to the currently active desktop using the <b>desktop#</b>
                     action should instead switch to the previously active desktop.   Default  is  "off"  to  do
                     nothing  when  switching  to  the  currently  active desktop.  Possible values are "on" and
                     "off".

              <b>Background</b>
                     The default background for desktops. The <b>type</b> attribute determines the type  of  background

                     <b>solid</b>
                            A solid color. See the <b>COLORS</b> section for more information.  This is the default.

                            A  stretched  image.  This  may be an XPM, PNG, or JPEG image. Note that support for
                            XPM, PNG, and JPEG images must be compiled in and icon support is required.
                     <b>tile</b>
                            A tiled image. Like <u>image</u>, but the image is tiled instead of stretched.
                     <b>scale</b>
                            A scaled image. Like <u>image</u>, but the aspect ratio of the image is preserved.
                     <b>command</b>
                            A command to run for setting the background.

              <b>Desktop</b>
                     Desktop-specific data. The <b>name</b> attribute may be specified to name the desktop (the default
                     is the desktop number). Within this tag a <b>Background</b> tag may be specified  for  a  desktop-
                     specific background.  See <b>Background</b> above for more information.
