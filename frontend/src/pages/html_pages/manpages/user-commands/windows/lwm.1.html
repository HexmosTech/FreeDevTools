</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lwm - Lightweight Window Manager for the X Window System

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lwm</b> [ <b>-s</b> <u>session-id</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Lwm</u>  is a window manager for the X Window System. It provides enough features to allow the user to manage
       their windows, and no more.

       Windows are surrounded by a frame with a titlebar at the top next to a small box. The  frame  is  a  grey
       colour for all windows except that which has the input focus, where it is black.

       In  the default configuration, <u>lwm</u> uses the enter-to-focus scheme, where moving the pointer into a window
       gives that window the input focus.  <u>Lwm</u> may also be configured to use the click-to-focus scheme, where  a
       window must be clicked on (with any button) to receive the input focus. Clicking on a window in this mode
       causes  the  window to be raised. Note that a click used to focus a window is always swallowed by <u>lwm</u>, so
       clicking a button in a new window requires two clicks.

       A button 1 click on a window frame brings that window to the top. Dragging button 1 on  the  frame  of  a
       resizable  window  repositions  that edge of the window. If a corner rather than an edge is dragged, then
       both edges forming the corner are repositioned. While you're reshaping a window, a little window pops  up
       to show you the window's current size.

       In the default configuration, button 1 on the root window does nothing.

       Button  2 is used to drag a window by its frame, repositioning the window but maintaining its position in
       the window stack.

       In the default configuration, button 2 on the root window brings up a new shell.

       A button 3 click on a window frame hides that window.  Pressing button 3 on the root window brings  up  a
       menu of all the hidden windows.  Releasing the button while over an item will unhide the named window.

       A  button  3  click  in the frame while Shift is held down pushes the window to the back, under any other
       windows. (Users with 4-button mice are encouraged to use their fourth button for this function.)

       A click with any button inside the little white box in a window's frame can be used to close the window.
