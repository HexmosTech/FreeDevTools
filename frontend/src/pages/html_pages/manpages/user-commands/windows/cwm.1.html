</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cwm — a lightweight and efficient window manager for X11

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cwm</b> [<b>-nv</b>] [<b>-c</b> <u>file</u>] [<b>-d</b> <u>display</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cwm</b>  is  a  window  manager  for  X11 which contains many features that concentrate on the efficiency and
       transparency of window management, while maintaining the simplest and most pleasant aesthetic.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-c</b> <u>file</u>
               Specify an alternative configuration file.  By default, <b>cwm</b>  loads  <u><a href="file:~/.cwmrc">~/.cwmrc</a></u>,  if  present.   Any
               error  messages  from  lines  in the configuration file will be sent to <u>stderr</u>; however, <b>cwm</b> will
               continue to process the rest of the configuration file.

       <b>-d</b> <u>display</u>
               Specify the display to use.

       <b>-n</b>      Configtest mode.  Only check the configuration file for validity.

       <b>-v</b>      Verbose mode.  Multiple <b>-v</b> options increase the verbosity.

       <b>cwm</b> actions are initiated either via key or mouse bindings.  The following notations are used  throughout
       this page:

             <b>C</b>       Control key.
             <b>M</b>       Meta key.

       The default mouse bindings are:

             <b>M-M1</b>            Move current window.
             <b>CM-M1</b>           Toggle group membership of current window.

             <b>CMS-M3</b>          Hide current window.

       The following key bindings may be used to navigate search and exec dialogs:

             <b>[Return]</b>              Select item.
             <b>[Down],</b> <b>C-s</b> or <b>M-j</b>    Next item.
             <b>[Up],</b> <b>C-r</b> or <b>M-k</b>      Previous item.
             <b>[Backspace]</b> or <b>C-h</b>    Backspace.
             <b>C-u</b>                   Clear input.
             <b>C-a</b>                   List all available items.
             <b>[Esc]</b>                 Cancel.

       <b>cwm</b> rereads its configuration file when it receives a hangup signal, SIGHUP, by executing itself with the
       name and arguments with which it was started.  This is equivalent to the <u>restart</u> function.

</pre><h4><b>SEARCH</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cwm</b> features the ability to search for windows by their current title, old titles, and  by  their  label.
       The  priority  for the search results are: label, current title, old titles in reverse order, and finally
       window class name.  <b>cwm</b> keeps a history of the 5 previous titles of a window.

       When searching, the leftmost character of the result list may show a flag:

             !       Window is currently focused.
             &amp;       Window is hidden.

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cwm</b> manages a list of applications defined with the <b>command</b> configuration option.

</pre><h4><b>GROUPS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cwm</b> has the ability to group windows together, and use the groups to perform  operations  on  the  entire
       group  instead  of just one window.  Together with the <u>sticky</u> option, this can be used to emulate virtual
       desktops.

       To edit groups, use the group selection commands to toggle membership of a group.  A blue border will  be
       shown  briefly  on  windows  added  to  the  current  group, and a red border will be shown on those just
       removed.

</pre><h4><b>MENUS</b></h4><pre>
       Menus are recalled by clicking the mouse on the root window:

             <b>M1</b>      Show list of currently defined windows.  Selecting  an  item  will  warp  to  that  window,
                     unhiding it if necessary.
             <b>M2</b>      Show list of currently defined groups.  Selecting an item will hide/unhide that group.
             <b>M3</b>      Show  list  of  applications  as defined in the configuration file.  Selecting an item will
                     spawn that application.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       DISPLAY     <b>cwm</b> starts on this display unless the <b>-d</b> option is given.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:~/.cwmrc">~/.cwmrc</a></u>    Default <b>cwm</b> configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man5/cwmrc.5.html">cwmrc</a></u>(5)

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cwm</b> was originally inspired by evilwm, but was rewritten from scratch due to limitations  in  the  evilwm
       codebase.  The from-scratch rewrite borrowed some code from 9wm, however that code has since been removed
       or rewritten.

       <b>cwm</b> first appeared in OpenBSD 4.2.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
