</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       windowlab - a window manager for X11

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>windowlab</b> <u>[options...]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>windowlab</b> is a small and simple window manager of novel design.

       It  has  a  click-to-focus  but not raise-on-focus policy, a window resizing mechanism that allows one or
       many edges of a window to be changed in one action, and an innovative menubar that shares the  same  part
       of  the  screen  as  the taskbar. Window titlebars are prevented from going off the edge of the screen by
       constraining  the  mouse  pointer,  and  when  appropriate  the  pointer  is  also  constrained  to   the
       taskbar/menubar in order to make target menu items easier to hit.

       WindowLab  places a taskbar at the top of the screen and adds a titlebar to the top of each window. These
       titlebars consist of a draggable area, and three icons on the right hand side. When left  clicked,  these
       icons:

       * hide the window
       *  toggle  the  window's  Z order Amiga style (if it's not at the front, bring it to the front, otherwise
       send it to the back)
       * close the window

       Another way of toggling a window's Z order (depth) is by double left clicking on the  draggable  part  of
       its titlebar.

       Windows' titlebars are prevented from leaving the screen and cannot overlap the taskbar.

       The  taskbar should list all windows currently in use. Left clicking on a window's taskbar item will give
       that window focus and toggle its Z order (depth).

       To resize the active window hold down alt and push against the window's edges with the left mouse  button
       down.

       If  you  right  click outside a client window, WindowLab's taskbar becomes a menubar. Releasing the right
       mouse button over a selected menu item will start a corresponding external program. WindowLab  will  look
       in each of the following files in turn for definitions of the menu labels and commands:

       * <a href="file:~/.windowlab/windowlab.menurc">~/.windowlab/windowlab.menurc</a>
       * ../etc/windowlab.menurc (from the directory containing the executable)
       * /etc/X11/windowlab/windowlab.menurc

       Each line in the menurc file should have the menu label, a colon, and then the corresponding command, eg:

       The GIMP:gimp

       New  windows (that don't specify their location) are positioned according to the coordinates of the mouse
       - the top-left hand corner of a new window is set to the location of the mouse pointer (if necessary  the
       window will be moved to ensure that all of it is on the screen).

       WindowLab has the following keyboard controls. Hold down alt and press:

       * <b>tab</b> to give focus to the previous window
       * <b>q</b> to give focus to the next window
       * <b>F11</b> to toggle fullscreen mode on and off for non transient windows
       * <b>F12</b> to toggle the window's depth. This is the same as left clicking a window's middle icon

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b> Sets which X display will be managed by <b>windowlab</b>.

</pre><h4><b>MENU</b> <b>SYSTEM</b></h4><pre>
       This version of WindowLab supports the Debian Menu subsystem.   To  update  the  menus,  it  suffices  to
       execute the command <u>update-menus</u>. If executed as root, the system setting in

             <b>/etc/X11/windowlab/windowlab.menurc</b>

       will be affected, whereas execution by any underprivileged user only effects the private resource file in

             <b><a href="file:~/.windowlab/windowlab.menurc">~/.windowlab/windowlab.menurc</a></b>.

       The following files tune the compilation of auto-generated menus:

       <b>/etc/X11/windowlab/debian_config</b>, <b><a href="file:~/.windowlab/debian_config">~/.windowlab/debian_config</a></b>
              Debian-specific system configuration and user-specific overrides.

       <b>/etc/X11/windowlab/common_menu</b>
              A common tail part, that currently encompasses <u>About</u>, <u>Reload</u> and <u>Quit</u>. All users get these entries
              included in their menu.

       <b><a href="file:~/.windowlab/user_menu">~/.windowlab/user_menu</a></b>
              Menu entries hand-picked by the individual user.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       When  WindowLab  receives a <b>SIGHUP</b> signal, it will reload all relevant menu resource files, thus updating
       the menu bar.
