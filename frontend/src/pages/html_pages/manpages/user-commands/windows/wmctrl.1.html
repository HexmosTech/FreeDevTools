</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wmctrl - interact with a EWMH/NetWM compatible X Window Manager.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wmctrl</b> [ <u>options</u> | <u>actions</u> ]<u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wmctrl</b>  is  a  command  that can be used to interact with an X Window manager that is compatible with the
       EWMH/NetWM specification.  <b>wmctrl</b> can query the window manager for information, and it can  request  that
       certain window management actions be taken.

       <b>wmctrl</b>  is  controlled  entirely  by  its  command line arguments. The command line arguments are used to
       specify the action to be performed (with options that modify behavior) and any arguments  that  might  be
       needed to perform the actions.

       The following sections define the supported actions and options. Arguments to the actions and options are
       written in the form <u>&lt;ARGNAME&gt;</u> in the descriptions below. The detailed syntax for writing arguments are in
       a single section dedicated to that purpose.

</pre><h4><b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  command line arguments can be specified to invoke a <b>wmctrl</b> action. Only one action can be
       executed with the invocation of the <b>wmctrl</b> command.

       <b>-a</b> <u>&lt;WIN&gt;</u>
              Switch to the desktop containing the window <u>&lt;WIN&gt;</u>, (see below)  raise  the  window,  and  give  it
              focus.

       <b>-b</b>  <b>(</b> <b>add</b> <b>|</b> <b>remove</b> <b>|</b> <b>toggle),</b><u>prop1</u> <b>[,</b><u>prop2</u> <b>]</b>
              Add,  remove,  or  toggle  up  to  two  window properties simultaneously. The window that is being
              modified must be identified with a <b>-r</b> action. The property change is achieved by  using  the  EWMH
              _NET_WM_STATE  request.  The  supported  property  names  (for <u>prop1</u> and <u>prop2</u>) are <b>modal</b>, <b>sticky</b>,
              <b>maximized_vert</b>, <b>maximized_horz</b>, <b>shaded</b>, <b>skip_taskbar</b>, <b>skip_pager</b>, <b>hidden</b>,  <b>fullscreen</b>,  <b>above</b>  and
              <b>below</b>.   Two  properties are supported to allow operations like maximizing a window to full screen
              mode. Note that this action is made up of exactly two shell command line arguments.

       <b>-c</b> <u>&lt;WIN&gt;</u>
              Close the window <u>&lt;WIN&gt;</u> gracefully.

       <b>-Y</b> <u>&lt;WIN&gt;</u>
              Iconify the window <u>&lt;WIN&gt;</u> .

       <b>-d</b>     List all desktops managed by the window manager. One line is output for  each  desktop,  with  the
              line  broken up into space separated columns. The first column contains an integer desktop number.
              The second column contains a '*' character for the current desktop, otherwise it  contains  a  '-'
              character.  The  next  two  columns  contain the fixed string <b>DG:</b> and then the desktop geometry as
              '<u>&lt;width&gt;</u>x<u>&lt;height&gt;</u>' (<u>e.g.</u> '1280x1024'). The following two columns contain the fixed string <b>VP:</b>  and
              then the viewport position in the format '<u>&lt;x&gt;</u>,<u>&lt;y&gt;</u>' (<u>e.g.</u> '0,0'). The next three columns after this
              contains  the  fixed  string  <b>WA:</b> and then two columns with the workarea geometry as '<u>X</u>,<u>Y</u> and <u>W</u>x<u>H</u>'
              (<u>e.g.</u> '0,0 1280x998'). The rest of the line contains the name of the desktop (possibly  containing
              multiple spaces).

       <b>-e</b> <u>&lt;MVARG&gt;</u>
              Resize  and  move  a  window  that  has  been  specified with a <b>-r</b> action according to the <u>&lt;MVARG&gt;</u>
              argument.

       <b>-g</b> <u>w</u><b>,</b><u>h</u> Change the geometry (common size) of all desktops so they are <u>w</u> pixels wide and <u>h</u> pixels  high.  <u>w</u>
              and <u>h</u> must be positive integers. A window manager may ignore this request.

       <b>-h</b>     Print help text about program usage.

       <b>-I</b> <u>name</u>
              Set the icon name (short title) of the window specified by a <b>-r</b> action to <u>name</u>.

       <b>-k</b>  <b>(</b> <b>on</b>  <b>|</b>  <b>off</b>  <b>|</b>  <b>toggle</b>  <b>)</b>
              Turn  on  or  off  or  toggle  the window manager's "show the desktop" mode (if the window manager
              implements this feature).

       <b>-M</b> <u>path</u>
              Set the mini-icon of the window specified by a <b>-r</b> action to the xpm bitmap in <u>path</u>.

       <b>-l</b>     List the windows being managed by the window manager. One line is output for each window, with the
              line broken up into space separated columns.  The first column always contains the window identity
              as a hexadecimal integer, and the second column always contains the desktop number (a -1  is  used
              to  identify  a sticky window). If the <b>-p</b> option is specified the next column will contain the PID
              for the window as a decimal integer. If the <b>-G</b> option is specified then four integer columns  will
              follow:  x-offset,  y-offset, width and height. The next column always contains the client machine
              name. The remainder of the line contains the window title (possibly with multiple  spaces  in  the
              title).

       <b>-m</b>     Display information about the window manager and the environment.

       <b>-n</b> <u>N</u>   Change the number of desktops to <u>N</u> (a non-negative integer).

       <b>-N</b> <u>name</u>
              Set the name (long title) of the window specified by a <b>-r</b> action to <u>name</u>.

       <b>-o</b> <u>x</u><b>,</b><u>y</u> Change  the  viewport for the current desktop. The values <u>x</u> and <u>y</u> are numeric offsets that specify
              the position of the top left corner of the viewport. A window manager may ignore this request.

       <b>-r</b> <u>&lt;WIN&gt;</u>
              Specify a target window for an action.

       <b>-R</b> <u>&lt;WIN&gt;</u>
              Move the window <u>&lt;WIN&gt;</u> to the current desktop, raise the window, and give it focus.

       <b>-s</b> <u>&lt;DESK&gt;</u>
              Switch to the desktop <u>&lt;DESK&gt;</u>.

       <b>-t</b> <u>&lt;DESK&gt;</u>
              Move a window that has been specified with the <b>-r</b> action to the desktop <u>&lt;DESK&gt;</u>.

       <b>-T</b> <u>name</u>
              Set the both the name (long title) and icon name (short title) of the window  specified  by  a  <b>-r</b>
              action  to  <u>name</u>.   This  action is like using the <b>-N</b> and <b>-I</b> actions at the same time (which would
              otherwise be impossible since <b>wmctrl</b> can execute only one action at a time).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options modify the default actions, or they modify the interpretation of arguments.

       <b>-F</b>     Window name arguments (<u>&lt;WIN&gt;</u>) are to be treated as exact window titles that  are  case  sensitive.
              Without  this  options  window titles are considered to be case insensitive substrings of the full
              window title.

       <b>-G</b>     Include geometry information in the output of the <b>-l</b> action.

       <b>-S</b>     List windows in stacking order (bottom to top).

       <b>-i</b>     Interpret window arguments (<u>&lt;WIN&gt;</u>) as a numeric value rather than a string name for the window. If
              the numeric value starts with the prefix '0x' it is assumed to be a hexadecimal number.

       <b>-p</b>     Include PIDs in the window list printed by the <b>-l</b> action. Prints a PID of '0' if  the  application
              owning the window does not support it.

       <b>-u</b>     Override auto-detection and force UTF-8 mode.

       <b>-v</b>     Provide verbose output. This is really useful when debugging <b>wmctrl</b> itself.

       <b>-w</b> <u>[</u> <u>&lt;WORKAROUND&gt;[,&lt;WORKAROUND&gt;]...</u> <u>]</u>
              Use workarounds specified in the argument.

       <b>-x</b>     Include WM_CLASS in the window list or interpret &lt;WIN&gt; as the WM_CLASS name.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>&lt;DESK&gt;</u> A  Desktop is always specified by an integer which represents the desktop numbers. Desktop numbers
              start at 0.

       <u>&lt;MVARG&gt;</u>
              A move and resize argument has the format <b>'</b><u>g</u><b>,</b><u>x</u><b>,</b><u>y,</u><b>w</b><u>,</u><b>h</b><u>'.</u>  All  five  components  are  integers.  The
              first  value,  <u>g</u>,  is  the  gravity of the window, with 0 being the most common value (the default
              value for the window). Please see the EWMH specification for other values.

              The four remaining values are a standard geometry specification: <u>x</u><b>,</b><u>y</u> is the position  of  the  top
              left  corner of the window, and <u>w</u><b>,</b><u>h</u> is the width and height of the window, with the exception that
              the value of -1 in any position is interpreted to mean that the current geometry value should  not
              be modified.

       <u>&lt;WIN&gt;</u>  This  argument  specifies  a  window  that  is the target of an action. By default the argument is
              treated as if were a string, and windows are examined  until  one  is  found  with  a  title  that
              contains the specified string as a substring. The substring matching is done in a case insensitive
              manner. The <b>-F</b> option may be used to force exact, case sensitive title matching. The option <b>-i</b> may
              be used to interpret the window target as a numeric window identity instead of a string.

              The  window  name  string  <b>:SELECT:</b>  is treated specially. If this window name is used then <b>wmctrl</b>
              waits for the user to select the target window by clicking on it.

              The window name string <b>:ACTIVE:</b> may be used to instruct <b>wmctrl</b> to use the currently active  window
              for the action.

       <u>&lt;WORKAROUND&gt;</u>
              There  is  only  one  work  around  currently  implemented.  It  is  specified by using the string
              <b>DESKTOP_TITLES_INVALID_UTF8</b> and it causes the printing of non-ASCII desktop tiles  correctly  when
              using Window Maker.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Getting a list of windows managed by the window manager

              wmctrl -l

       Getting a list of windows with PID and geometry information.

              wmctrl -p -G -l

       Going to the window with a name containing 'emacs' in it

              wmctrl -a emacs

       Shade a window with a title that contains the word 'mozilla'

              wmctrl -r mozilla -b add,shaded

       Close a very specifically titled window sticky

              wmctrl -F -c 'Debian bug tracking system - Mozilla'

       Set the 'stickiness' of a window with a specific window identity

              wmctrl -i -r 0x0120002 -b add,sticky

       Change the title of window to a specified string but choose the window by clicking on it

              wmctrl -r :SELECT: -T "Selected Window"

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man1/zenity.1.html">zenity</a></b>(1) is a useful dialog program for building scripts with <b>wmctrl</b>.

       Some  examples  of EWMH/NetWM compatible window managers include recent versions of Enlightenment, Icewm,
       Kwin, Sawfish and Xfce.
