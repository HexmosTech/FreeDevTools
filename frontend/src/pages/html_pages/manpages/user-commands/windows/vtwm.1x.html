       vtwm - Virtual Tab Window Manager for the X Window System

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vtwm</b> [ <b>-d</b> <u>display</u> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>initfile</u> ] [ <b>-m</b> [ <u>m4-options</u> ] ] [ <b>-p</b> ] [ <b>-s</b> ] [ <b>-v</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vtwm</b>  is  a window manager for the X Window System.  It provides titlebars, shaped windows, several forms
       of icon management, user-defined macro functions, click-to-type and pointer-driven  keyboard  focus,  and
       user-specified key and pointer button bindings.

       This  program  is usually started by the user's session manager or startup script.  When used from <b><a href="../man1/xdm.1.html">xdm</a></b>(1)
       or <b><a href="../man1/xinit.1.html">xinit</a></b>(1) without a session manager, <b>vtwm</b> is frequently executed in the foreground as the last  client.
       When run this way, exiting <b>vtwm</b> causes the session to be terminated (i.e., logged out).

       By  default,  application  windows  are  surrounded by a border with a titlebar at the top.  The titlebar
       contains the window's name, a rectangular area that indicates  when  the  window  is  receiving  keyboard
       input, and three function boxes known as "titlebar buttons".  Pressing pointer Button1 (usually the left-
       most button unless it has been changed with <b><a href="../man1/xmodmap.1.html">xmodmap</a></b>(1)) on any of these titlebar features will invoke the
       function associated with them.

       With  the  default interface, windows are iconified by clicking (pressing and then immediately releasing)
       the titlebar button that looks like a dot.  Conversely,  windows  are  deiconified  by  clicking  in  the
       associated  icon  or  entry in the icon manager (see the descriptions of the variable <b>ShowIconManager</b> and
       the function <b>f.showiconmgr</b> in the <b>BINDINGS</b> section).

       Windows are resized by pressing the titlebar button that resembles a group of  nested  squares,  dragging
       the  pointer  over the edge that is to be moved, and releasing the pointer when the window is the desired
       size.  Similarly, windows are moved by pressing in the title or highlight area, dragging it  to  the  new
       location,  and  then releasing when the window is in the desired position.  Just clicking in the title or
       highlight area raises the window without moving it.

       Pressing the titlebar button with the down arrow in it brings up a menu with many  other  functions  that
       may be applied to the window.

       When  new  windows  are  created, <b>vtwm</b> will honor any size and location information requested by the user
       (usually through <b>-geometry</b> command line argument or X11 resources for the individual applications).  With
       the default configuration, Clicking pointer Button1 will position the window at the current position  and
       give  it the default size.  Pressing pointer Button2 (usually the middle pointer button) and dragging the
       window will give the window its current position but allow the sides to be resized  as  described  above.
       Clicking pointer Button3 (usually the right pointer button) will give the window its current position but
       attempt to make it long enough to touch the bottom of the screen.

       The  default  behavior  during  these operations is to represent the window with an outline of the client
       window and its titlebar, lines crossing within the client window.  Alternatively, <b>vtwm</b> may be  configured
       to draw the window completely, but it is not recommended unless yours is a fast system.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>VIRTUAL</b> <b>DESKTOP</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vtwm</b>  is  based  upon  the  <b><a href="../man1/twm.1.html">twm</a></b>(1)  window manager, but adds extra functionality in the form of a virtual
       desktop.  The virtual desktop is an area larger than the physical screen. The real screen  is  considered
       to  be a window onto portions of the virtual desktop showing whatever windows are present in that area of
       the desktop.   To help navigate around the desktop, <b>vtwm</b> creates a new window, of the name <u>VTWM</u>  <u>Desktop</u>,
       which  shows  the  entire  desktop  using a small scale.  In the Virtual Desktop window, all windows that
       exist are displayed and various options are provided to recognize the identity of the  different  windows
       (see    the   descriptions   of   the   variables   <b>DesktopDisplayBackground</b>,   <b>DesktopDisplayForeground</b>,
       <b>DesktopDisplayBorder</b> and <b>VirtualDesktopFont</b>).

       To provide a consistent workspace, the option is provided of <u>nail</u>ing windows onto the real screen.   When
       a  window  is  nailed,  it  is  considered stuck to the real screen no matter what part of the desktop is
       currently being displayed.

       Normally, a few standard utilities are nailed down: the icon manager, the desktop view,  a  load  average
       chart,  a  clock, and a mail notifier.  The <b>f.nail</b> (or its alias, <b>f.stick</b>) function can be used to change
       the nailed status of any window; see the <b>BINDINGS</b> section for details.

       The root window of the display is unchanged by this  program  and  utilities  such  as  <b><a href="../man1/xsetroot.1.html">xsetroot</a></b>(1)  will
       continue to work unmodified.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vtwm</b> accepts the following command line options:

       <b>-d</b> <u>display</u>     This option specifies the X server to use.

       <b>-f</b> [<u>initfile</u>]  This  option specifies the name of the startup file to use.  By default, <b>vtwm</b> will look in
                      the user's home directory for files named <u>.vtwmrc.N</u>, <u>.vtwmrc</u>, <u>.twmrc.N</u>, or  <u>.twmrc</u>  (where
                      '<u>N</u>'  is  a  screen  number).   It  also  looks  for  system-wide  default  files;  see the
                      <b>CUSTOMIZATION</b> section below for details. If <u>initfile</u> is not provided, this specifies  that
                      <b>vtwm</b>  should  disregard  any  startup  files  it finds, and use only the defaults that are
                      compiled in (intended for testing compiled-in defaults).

       <b>-m</b> [<u>options</u>]   This option causes <b>vtwm</b> to preprocess the startup file using the  <b><a href="../man1/m4.1.html">m4</a></b>(1)  macro  processor.
                      The  <u>options</u>  will  be  passed verbatim to <b>m4</b> along with those symbols that <b>vtwm</b> declares.
                      Note that <u>options</u> itself should be quoted, to prevent unwanted processing that  may  occur
                      by the shell, etc.

       <b>-p</b>             This  option  indicates  that  <b>vtwm</b>  should attempt to write it's PID to <u>$HOME/vtwm.pid</u> on
                      startup, and delete that file on shutdown.  This file may be useful as a lock file, or for
                      determining the correct <b>vtwm</b> process for a particular user.  If the file cannot be written
                      on startup, a bell will sound, but <b>vtwm</b> will continue.

       <b>-s</b>             This option indicates that only the default screen (as specified by the <b>-d</b>  option  or  by
                      the  <b>DISPLAY</b>  environment  variable)  should be managed.  By default, <b>vtwm</b> will attempt to
                      manage all screens on the display.

       <b>-v</b>             This option indicates that <b>vtwm</b> should  print  messages  to  the  stderr  device  when  an
                      unexpected  event  occurs.   This  can be be useful for debugging applications, but may be
                      distracting in regular use.

</pre><h4><b>CUSTOMIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       Much of <b>vtwm</b>'s appearance and behavior can be controlled by providing  a  startup  file  in  one  of  the
       following locations (searched in order for each screen being managed when <b>vtwm</b> begins):

       <u>$HOME/.vtwmrc.screennumber</u>
               The  <u>screennumber</u>  is  a small positive number (e.g., 0, 1, etc.)  representing the screen number
               (e.g., the last number in the DISPLAY environment variable <u>host:displaynum.screennum</u>) that  would
               be  used  to  contact  that  screen  of the display.  This is intended for displays with multiple
               screens of differing visual types.

       <u>$HOME/.vtwmrc</u>
               This is the usual name for an individual user's startup file.

       <u>$VTWMDIR/twm/system.vtwmrc</u>
               If neither of the preceding files  are  found,  <b>vtwm</b>  will  look  in  this  file  for  a  default
               configuration.   Note  that  the  variable  is defined <u>only</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>Makefile</u>, and is often set and
               tailored by the site administrator to provide convenient menus or familiar  bindings  for  novice
               users.

       <u>$HOME/.twmrc.screennumber</u>

       <u>$HOME/.twmrc</u>

       <u>$VTWMDIR/twm/system.twmrc</u>
               When none of the <u>.vtwmrc</u> files can be found, <b>vtwm</b> reverts to acting like <b><a href="../man1/twm.1.html">twm</a></b>(1), and searches for
               these three <u>.twmrc</u> variants.  Note that the variable is defined <u>only</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>Makefile</u>.

       This  search  algorithm allows both <b><a href="../man1/twm.1.html">twm</a></b>(1) and <b>vtwm</b> to coexist peacefully at an installation.  Since <b>vtwm</b>
       is a superset of <b><a href="../man1/twm.1.html">twm</a></b>(1), it can even used to replace the latter, and users who have only  a  <u>.twmrc</u>-style
       file should not notice much difference.

       If  no  startup  files  are  found, or if <b>vtwm</b> is told to ignore them, <b>vtwm</b> will use built-in defaults as
       described in the <b>DESCRIPTION</b> section above, though the <u>system.vtwmrc</u> file, if  re-configured  before  the
       build, may intervene.  The only X11 resource used by <b>vtwm</b> is <u>bitmapFilePath</u> for a colon-separated list of
       directories  to  search  when  looking  for bitmap and pixmap files (for more information, see the <u>Athena</u>
       <u>Widgets</u> manual and <b><a href="../man1/xrdb.1.html">xrdb</a></b>(1)).

       <b>vtwm</b> startup files are logically broken up into three  types  of  specifications:   <u>Variables</u>,  <u>Bindings</u>,
       <u>Menus</u>.

       The  <u>Variables</u> section must come first and is used to describe the fonts, colors, cursors, border widths,
       icon and window placement, highlighting, autoraising, layout of titles, warping,  and  use  of  the  icon
       manager.

       The  <u>Bindings</u>  section  usually  comes  second  and is used to specify the functions that should be to be
       invoked when keyboard and pointer buttons are pressed in windows, icons, titles, and frames.

       The <u>Menus</u> section gives any user-defined menus (containing functions to be  invoked  or  commands  to  be
       executed).

       Variable  names and keywords are case-insensitive.  Strings must be surrounded by double quote characters
       (e.g., <u>"blue"</u>) and are case-sensitive.  A sharp sign ('#') outside of a string causes  the  remainder  of
       the line in which the character appears to be treated as a comment.

</pre><h4><b>M4</b> <b>PREPROCESSING</b></h4><pre>
       A  powerful  feature  of  <b>vtwm</b>  as  of version 5.4.6 is that it can use <b><a href="../man1/m4.1.html">m4</a></b>(1) to pre-process it's startup
       files.  When <b>vtwm</b> is started with <b>-m</b>, it will open a file for input as described above, but will  process
       that  file  through  <b>m4</b>  before  parsing it.  So, you can use <b>m4</b> macros to perform operations at runtime.
       This makes it very easy to work when you use many different displays, etc.  For example, if you  want  to
       set  the  lower  right  section  of  the screen to be your <b>IconRegion</b>, you can use <b>m4</b> directives and pre-
       defined symbols to calculate the region you want:
           define(IRegion, translit(eval(WIDTH/3)*eval(HEIGHT/2)+eval(WIDTH-WIDTH/3)-0, *, x))
           IconRegion  "IRegion" SOUTH EAST 75 25
       will define the lower half, and right-hand third of  the  screen.   The  symbols  <u>WIDTH</u>  and  <u>HEIGHT</u>  are
       calculated by <b>vtwm</b> for <b>m4</b> to use.  The following symbols are pre-defined by <b>vtwm</b>:

       <b>SERVERHOST</b>     This variable is set to the name of the machine that is running the X server.

       <b>CLIENTHOST</b>     The machine that is running the X clients (i.e., "vtwm", "xterm", etc.).

       <b>HOSTNAME</b>       The   canonical   hostname  running  the  clients  (i.e.,  a  fully-qualified  version  of
                      <b>CLIENTHOST</b>).

       <b>USER</b>           The name of the user running the program.  Gotten from the environment.

       <b>HOME</b>           The user's home directory.  Gotten from the environment.

       <b>VERSION</b>        The X major protocol version.  As seen by ProtocolVersion().

       <b>REVISION</b>       The X minor protocol revision.  As seen by ProtocolRevision().

       <b>VENDOR</b>         The vendor of your X server (i.e., "MIT X Consortium").

       <b>RELEASE</b>        The release number of your X server.  For MIT X11R5, this is "5".

       <b>WIDTH</b>          The width of your display in pixels.

       <b>HEIGHT</b>         The height of your display in pixels.

       <b>X_RESOLUTION</b>   The X resolution of your display in pixels per meter.

       <b>Y_RESOLUTION</b>   The Y resolution of your display in pixels per meter.

       <b>PLANES</b>         The number of bit planes your display supports in the default root window.

       <b>BITS_PER_RGB</b>   The number of significant bits in an RGB color.  (log base 2 of  the  number  of  distinct
                      colors that can be created.  This is often different from the number of colors that can be
                      displayed at once.)

       <b>TWM_TYPE</b>       Tells  which  <b>twm</b> derivative is running.  It will always be set to "vtwm" in this program.
                      This is useful for protecting parts of your startup file that <b>twm</b> proper won't  understand
                      (like <b>VirtualDesktop</b>) so that it is still usable with other <b>twm</b>-based programs.

       <b>CLASS</b>          Your   visual  class.   Will  return  one  of  "StaticGray",  "GrayScale",  "StaticColor",
                      "PseudoColor", "TrueColor", "DirectColor", or, if  it  cannot  determine  what  you  have,
                      "NonStandard".

       <b>COLOR</b>          This  will  be  either "Yes" or "No".  This is just a wrapper around the above definition.
                      Returns "Yes" on "*Color", and "No" on "StaticGray" and "GrayScale".

       <b>I18N</b>           This will be either "Yes" or "No" depending on whether  support  for  internationalization
                      has been compiled in.

       <b>XPM</b>            This  will be either "Yes" or "No" depending on whether support for pixmap image files has
                      been compiled in.

       <b>SOUND</b>          This will be either "Yes" or "No" depending on whether support for sound has been compiled
                      in.

       <b>REGEX</b>          This will be either "Yes" or "No" depending on whether  support  for  regular  expressions
                      ("RE"s) has been compiled in.

       Note  that  any symbols passed to <b>m4</b> on the command line that conflict with these will not be anticipated
       or dealt with by <b>vtwm</b>; you will be at the mercy of your particular <b>m4</b>.

       Note also that if <b>vtwm</b>'s preparation for executing <b>m4</b> fails, the startup file will be processed normally,
       and will choke on the first <b>m4</b> macro encountered.

       Finally, be aware that <b>m4</b> preprocessing can cause things often found in  startup  files  to  break.   For
       example,  quotes  and  backquotes  in shell commands will be badly messed up by <b>m4</b>'s own internal quoting
       mechanism.  This particular problem can be worked around by placing <u>changequote(,)</u> at  the  top  of  your
       startup file.

       Invoking <b>vtwm</b> with both the <b>-m</b> and <b>-v</b> options will print the <b>m4</b> command with all symbols expanded.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Many  of  the  aspects of <b>vtwm</b>'s user interface are controlled by variables that may be set in the user's
       startup file.  Some of the options are enabled or  disabled  simply  by  the  presence  of  a  particular
       keyword.  Other options require keywords, numbers, strings, or lists of all of these.

       Lists are surrounded by braces and are usually separated by whitespace or a newline.  For example:
           <b>AutoRaise</b> { "emacs" "VTWM*" "x*clock" "Xmh" "XTerm" }
       or
           <b>AutoRaise</b>
           {
               "emacs"
               "VTWM*"
               "x*clock"
               "Xmh"
               "XTerm"
           }

       When a variable containing a list of strings representing windows is searched (e.g., to determine whether
       or  not to enable autoraise as shown above), a string must be a case-sensitive match to the window's name
       (given by the WM_NAME window property), or the class name or class class  (both  given  by  the  WM_CLASS
       window  property).   The  preceding  example  would  enable autoraise on windows named "emacs", all <b>vtwm</b>-
       specific windows, any clocks installed whose name starts with an 'x' (<b>asclock</b> will  not  autoraise),  and
       all  <b>xmh</b>  and  <b>xterm</b>  windows  (which  are  of class "XTerm" and "Xmh", respectively).  See the <b>WILDCARDS</b>
       section for details on what the asterisks ('*') mean.

       String arguments that are interpreted as filenames (see the <b>Pixmaps</b>, <b>Cursors</b>, and <b>IconDirectory</b> variables
       below) will prepend the user's directory (specified by  the  <u>HOME</u>  environment  variable)  if  the  first
       character  is  a  tilde ('~').  If, instead, the first character is a colon (':'), the name is assumed to
       refer to one of the internal bitmaps that are used to create 2D titlebar buttons,  the  2D  icon  manager
       button,  and the 2D menu pull-right icon.  Finally, if the first five characters are ":xpm:", the name is
       assumed to refer to one of the built-in pixmaps that can used to create 3D titlebar buttons, the 3D  icon
       manager  button,  and  the  3D menu pull-right icon.  See the <b>IMAGE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>AUDIO</b> <b>FORMATS</b> section for further
       details.

       The following variables may be specified in the <b>vtwm</b> startup file.  Lists of window names  are  indicated
       by  <u>win-list</u>,  and  optional  arguments are shown in square brackets. Any default values are based on the
       distributed <u>system.vtwmrc</u> files, and if none is mentioned, the default setting is "off",  "disabled",  or
       "none".

       <b>AppletRegion</b> <u>geomstr</u> <u>vgrav</u> <u>hgrav</u> <u>hgrid</u> <u>vgrid</u> { <u>win-list</u> }
              This  variable  specifies  an  area on the root window in which the windows listed in <u>win-list</u> are
              placed.  The <u>geomstr</u> is a quoted string containing  a  standard  geometry  specification  for  the
              region  size  and  location.  If more than one <b>AppletRegion</b> is specified, windows will be put into
              succeeding regions that have the window listed when the first is full.  The <u>vgrav</u> argument  should
              be  either  <b>North</b> or <b>South</b> and is used to control whether windows are first filled in from the top
              or bottom of the region.  Similarly, the <u>hgrav</u> argument should be either <b>East</b> or <b>West</b> and is  used
              to  control whether windows should be filled in from the left or right.  Windows are laid out in a
              grid with cells <u>hgrid</u> pixels wide and <u>vgrid</u> pixels high.  Note that the smallest dimension of  the
              region must be at least the size of the largest window in it, including frame and titlebar, in the
              same  direction.   This  variable  is  intended  to  simplify  management of all those little tool
              applications like <b><a href="../man1/xcb.1.html">xcb</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/xbiff.1.html">xbiff</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/xload.1.html">xload</a></b>(1), etc. that are used regularly.

       <b>AutoPan</b> <u>N</u>
               This variable allows the screen to automatically pan by <u>N%</u> of a  real  screen  when  the  pointer
               approaches  the  edge of the screen. The pan will be in the direction of the edge approached. The
               default is <u>100</u>, effectively "paging" across the virtual desktop.

       <b>AutoPanBorderWidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
               If <b>AutoPan</b> is turned on, when the pointer goes within the specified number of <u>pixels</u> of the  real
               screen's border, the screen is panned.  The default value is <u>5</u>.

       <b>AutoPanExtraWarp</b> <u>pixels</u>
               If  <b>AutoPan</b>  is turned on and <b>NaturalAutopanBehavior</b> turned off, this variable specifies how far,
               in pixels, you want the pointer to move away from the inner  edge  of  the  autopan  border  when
               autopanning.  The default value is <u>2</u> pixels.

       <b>AutoPanWarpWithRespectToRealScreen</b> <u>N</u>
               With  this option turned on, the pointer is warped by <u>N%</u> as many pixels on the real screen as the
               screen is scrolled, or by
                   (<b>AutoPanBorderWidth</b> + <b>AutoPanExtraWarp</b>)
               pixels, whichever is greater.  See <b>NaturalAutopanBehavior</b> for a more thorough discussion of  this
               and some recommended settings.

       <b>AutoRaise</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable  specifies  a  list  of  windows  (all  windows  if  <u>win-list</u>  is  omitted)  to be
               automatically raised whenever the pointer has come to rest in a window for  the  amount  of  time
               specified  by  the  <b>RaiseDelay</b> variable.  This action can be interactively enabled or disabled on
               individual windows using the function <b>f.autoraise</b>.

       <b>AutoRaiseDelay</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
               A synonym for <b>RaiseDelay</b>.

       <b>AutoRelativeResize</b>
               This variable indicates that dragging out a window size (either when initially sizing the  window
               with  pointer  Button2  or  when  resizing  it) should not wait until the pointer has crossed the
               window edges.  Instead, moving the pointer automatically causes the nearest edge or edges to move
               by the same amount.  This allows the resizing windows that extend off the edge of the screen.  If
               the pointer is in the center of the window, or if the resize is  begun  by  pressing  a  titlebar
               button, <b>vtwm</b> will still wait for the pointer to cross a window edge (to prevent accidents).  This
               option  is  particularly useful for people who like the press-drag-release method of sweeping out
               window sizes.

       <b>BeNiceToColormap</b>
               This variable specifies that stippled lines be used for the bevel  colors  when  any  of  the  3D
               variables are set, to conserve on colormap allocations.

       <b>BorderBevelWidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
               Tells  <b>vtwm</b> to use 3D-looking window borders, and specifies the width in pixels of the bevel. The
               color of the 3D border is <b>BorderTileBackground</b>, and if <b>NoHighlight</b> is not selected, the border of
               the Focus window is <b>BorderColor</b>.  The default is <u>0</u> if <b>vtwm</b> is built with 2D features, or  <u>2</u>  when
               <b>vtwm</b> is built with 3D features.

       <b>BorderColor</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>wincolorlist</u> }]
               This  variable  specifies  the  default color of the border to be placed around all non-iconified
               windows, and may only be given within a <b>Color</b> or  <b>Monochrome</b>  list.   The  optional  <u>wincolorlist</u>
               specifies  a  list  of  window  and  color name pairs for specifying particular border colors for
               different types of windows.  For example:
                   <b>BorderColor</b>    "gray50"
                   {
                       "XTerm"    "red"
                       "xmh"      "green"
                   }

               The default is <u>"gray70"</u>.

       <b>BorderTileBackground</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>wincolorlist</u> }]
               This variable specifies the default background color in the gray pattern  used  in  unhighlighted
               borders (only if <b>NoHighlight</b> hasn't been set), and may only be given within a <b>Color</b> or <b>Monochrome</b>
               list.   The  optional  <u>wincolorlist</u>  allows  per-window  colors  to be specified.  The default is
               <u>"gray60"</u>.

       <b>BorderTileForeground</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>wincolorlist</u> }]
               This variable specifies the default foreground color in the gray pattern  used  in  unhighlighted
               borders (only if <b>NoHighlight</b> hasn't been set), and may only be given within a <b>Color</b> or <b>Monochrome</b>
               list.   The  optional  <u>wincolorlist</u>  allows  per-window  colors  to be specified.  The default is
               <u>"gray60"</u>.

       <b>BorderWidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
               This variable specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding all client window frames if
               <b>ClientBorderWidth</b> has not been specified.  This value is also used to  set  the  border  size  of
               windows  created  by  <b>vtwm</b> (such as the icon manager).  The default is <u>2</u> if <b>vtwm</b> is built with 2D
               features, or <u>6</u> when <b>vtwm</b> is built with 3D features.

       <b>ButtonBevelWidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
               Tells <b>vtwm</b> to use 3D-looking window buttons. It specifies the width in pixels of the bevel.   The
               default is <u>0</u> if <b>vtwm</b> is built with 2D features, or <u>1</u> when <b>vtwm</b> is built with 3D features.

       <b>ButtonIndent</b> <u>pixels</u>
               This variable specifies the size of titlebar buttons, expressed as a difference from the titlebar
               font height, and normally means that titlebar buttons will shrink (built-in images) or be cropped
               (external  images)  accordingly.  A negative value is accepted, however, indicating that titlebar
               buttons should be larger than the titlebar font. Setting this to a  negated  <b>FramePadding</b>  value,
               with  <b>TitleButtonBorderWidth</b>  set  to 0, makes titlebar buttons as tall and wide as possible. The
               default is <u>0</u> if <b>vtwm</b> is built with with 2D features, or <u>-2</u> when <b>vtwm</b> is built with 3D features.

       <b>ButtonColorIsFrame</b>
               This variable specifies that the titlebar buttons will be the same color as the window frame.  It
               is set by default if <b>vtwm</b> is built with 3D features.

       <b>ClearBevelContrast</b> <u>contrast</u>
               Indicates to <b>vtwm</b> how to calculate the clear bevel color for 3D items.  The value is a compressed
               to the range 0 and 100. The formula used is:
                   clear.{RGB} = (65535 - color.{RGB}) * (contrast / 100)

               The default is <u>40</u> if <b>vtwm</b> is built with 3D features.

       <b>ClientBorderWidth</b>
               This  variable  indicates  that  width  of  a window's frame should be set to the border width as
               specified by the client, rather than to the value of <b>BorderWidth</b>.  If  <b>BorderBevelWidth</b>  is  non-
               zero, however, this variable is ignored.

       <b>Color</b> { <u>colors-list</u> }
               This  variable specifies a list of color assignments to be made if the default display is capable
               of displaying more than simple black and white.  The <u>colors-list</u> is  made  up  of  the  following
               color   variables   and   their  values:  <b>DefaultBackground</b>,  <b>DefaultForeground</b>,  <b>MenuBackground</b>,
               <b>MenuForeground</b>, <b>MenuTitleBackground</b>, <b>MenuTitleForeground</b>,  and  <b>MenuShadowColor</b>.   The  following
               color  variables  may  also  be  given  a list of window and color name pairs to allow per-window
               colors to be specified (see  <b>BorderColor</b>  for  details):  <b>BorderColor</b>,  <b>DesktopDisplayForeground</b>,
               <b>DesktopDisplayBackground</b>,    <b>RealScreenForeground</b>,    <b>RealScreenBackground</b>,    <b>VirtualForeground</b>,
               <b>VirtualBackground</b>,     <b>DekstopDisplayBorder</b>,     <b>IconManagerHighlight</b>,     <b>BorderTitleBackground</b>,
               <b>BorderTitleForeground</b>,    <b>TitleBackground</b>,   <b>TitleForeground</b>,   <b>IconBackground</b>,   <b>IconForeground</b>,
               <b>IconBorderColor</b>, <b>IconManagerBackground</b>, and <b>IconManagerForeground</b>.  For example:
                   <b>Color</b>
                   {
                       <b>MenuBackground</b>     "gray50"
                       <b>MenuForeground</b>     "blue"
                       <b>BorderColor</b>        "red"
                       {
                           "XTerm"        "yellow"
                       }
                       <b>TitleForeground</b>    "yellow"
                       <b>TitleBackground</b>    "blue"
                   }

               All of these color variables may also be specified for the <b>Monochrome</b> variable, allowing the same
               initialization file to be used on both color and monochrome displays.

       <b>ConstrainedMoveTime</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
               This variable specifies the length of time between button clicks needed to  begin  a  constrained
               move  operation.  Double  clicking within this amount of time when invoking <b>f.move</b> will cause the
               window only to be moved in a horizontal or vertical direction.  Setting  this  value  to  0  will
               disable constrained moves.  The default is <u>400</u> milliseconds.

       <b>Cursors</b> { <u>cursor-list</u> }
               This variable specifies the glyphs that <b>vtwm</b> should use for various pointer cursors.  Each cursor
               may be defined either from the <b>cursor</b> font or from two bitmap files.  Shapes from the <b>cursor</b> font
               may be specified directly as:
                   <u>cursorname</u>    "<u>string</u>"
               where  <u>cursorname</u>  is  one of the cursor names listed below, and <u>string</u> is the name of a glyph as
               found in the file /usr/include/X11/cursorfont.h (without the "XC_" prefix).  If the cursor is  to
               be defined from bitmap files, the following syntax is used instead:
                   <u>cursorname</u>    "<u>image</u>"    "<u>mask</u>"
               where  <u>image</u> and <u>mask</u> specify the names of files containing the glyph image and mask in <u><a href="../man1/bitmap.1.html">bitmap</a></u>(1)
               form.  The bitmap files are located in the same manner  as  icon  bitmap  files.   The  following
               example shows the default cursor definitions:
                   <b>Cursors</b>
                   {
                       Frame      "top_left_arrow"
                       Title      "top_left_arrow"
                       Icon       "top_left_arrow"
                       IconMgr    "top_left_arrow"
                       Move       "fleur"
                       Resize     "fleur"
                       Menu       "sb_left_arrow"
                       Button     "hand2"
                       Wait       "watch"
                       Select     "dot"
                       Destroy    "pirate"
                       Door       "exchange"
                       Virtual    "rtl_logo"
                       Desktop    "dotbox"
                   }

       <b>DarkBevelContrast</b> <u>contrast</u>
               Indicates  to  <b>vtwm</b> has to calculate the dark bevel color for 3D items.  The value is a comprised
               between 0 and 100. The formula used is:
                   dark.{RGB} = color.{RGB} * ((100 - contrast) / 100)

               The default is <u>40</u> if <b>vtwm</b> is built with 3D features.

       <b>DecorateTransients</b>
               This variable indicates that transient windows (those  containing  a  WM_TRANSIENT_FOR  property)
               should have titlebars.  By default, transients are not reparented.

       <b>DefaultBackground</b> <u>string</u>
               This  variable specifies the background color to be used for sizing and information windows.  The
               default is <u>"maroon"</u> for color displays or <u>"gray50"</u> for monochrome displays.

       <b>DefaultForeground</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the foreground color to be used for sizing and information windows.   The
               default is <u>"gray85"</u>.

       <b>DeiconifyToScreen</b>
               When deiconifying a window, by default, the window will be placed at its previous geometry in the
               virtual desktop. With this variable set, <b>vtwm</b> ensures that the window will be placed somewhere on
               the real screen.

       <b>DesktopDisplayBackground</b> <u>color</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable  sets the backgrounds of the little windows inside the Virtual Desktop window, AND
               it sets the backgrounds of  menu  entries  in  the  <b>VTWM</b>  <b>Windows</b>  menu  --  unless  you  specify
               <b>OldFashionedVtwmWindowsMenu</b>.  The default <u>color</u> is used for the default background of windows not
               named in the list.  The optional <u>win-list</u> is a list of window names and colors, for example:
                   <b>DesktopDisplayBackground</b>    "purple"
                   {
                       "zwgc"                  "green"
                   }

               The default is <u>"gray60"</u>.

       <b>DesktopDisplayBorder</b> <u>color</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable  sets the border color in the virtual desktop representation window to <u>color</u>.  The
               <u>win-list</u> is in the same format as <b>TitleForeground</b> and other similar variables.
                   <b>DesktopDisplayBorder</b>    "black"
                   {
                       "zwgc"              "green"
                   }

               The default is <u>"black"</u>.

       <b>DesktopDisplayForeground</b> <u>color</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               If both this and the <b>VirtualDesktopFont</b> variable are set, then the names of the windows  will  be
               written  in  the  window  representations  shown in the desktop.  This entry also sets foreground
               colors for entries in the <b>VTWM</b> <b>Windows</b> menu.  The format of this variable is  the  same  as  that
               used for <b>DesktopDisplayBackground</b>.  The default is <u>"gray85"</u>.

       <b>DontDeiconifyTransients</b>
               This  variable  sees  that  iconified  transient  windows  of  an  iconified parent window aren't
               deiconified when that parent is, thus preserving their state.  Default behavior is  to  deiconify
               all transient subwindows of the ancestor window when it is deiconified.

       <b>DontIconifyByUnmapping</b> { <u>win-list</u> }
               This  variable  specifies  a list of windows that should not be iconified by simply unmapping the
               window (as would be the case if <b>IconifyByUnmapping</b> had been set).  This  is  frequently  used  to
               force some windows to be treated as icons while other windows are handled by the icon manager.

       <b>DontInterpolateTitles</b>
               This variable specifies a modification to the <b>InterpolateMenuColors</b> behavior.  It will cause <b>vtwm</b>
               to  not  apply  color interpolation to any titles in the middle of the menu.  So, <b>f.title</b> strings
               that appear in the middle of the menu (ie, without  a  specific  color  defined  for  them)  will
               inherit the default MenuTitle foreground and background colors.

       <b>DontMoveOff</b>
               This variable indicates that windows should not be allowed to be moved off the screen.  It can be
               overridden by the <b>f.forcemove</b> function.

       <b>DontShowInDisplay</b> { <u>list</u> }
               This  variable  specifies  a  list of clients that should not appear in the desktop display.  The
               default is:
                   <b>DontShowInDisplay</b>
                   {
                       "VTWM *"
                       "xclock"
                       "xload"
                   }

       <b>DontShowInTwmWindows</b> { <u>list</u> }

       <b>DontShowInVtwmWindows</b> { <u>list</u> }
               These variables specify a list of clients that should not appear in the <b>VTWM</b> <b>Windows</b> menu.

       <b>DontSqueezeTitle</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This variable indicates that titlebars should not be squeezed to their minimum size as  described
               under  <b>SqueezeTitle</b>  below.   If the optional window list is supplied, only those windows will be
               prevented from being squeezed.

       <b>DoorBackground</b> <u>color</u> [{ <u>door-list</u> }]
               Specifies background colors of doors. The default is <u>"maroon"</u> for color displays or <u>"gray50"</u>  for
               monochrome displays.

       <b>DoorBevelWidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
               Tells  <b>vtwm</b>  to use 3D-looking doors, and specifies the width in pixels of the bevel. The default
               is <u>0</u> if <b>vtwm</b> is built with 2D features, or <u>1</u> when <b>vtwm</b> is built with 3D features.

       <b>DoorFont</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the font to be used for text in doors.  This must be set in order to  see
               the doors.  The default is <u>"-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-*-*"</u>.

       <b>DoorForeground</b> <u>color</u> [{ <u>door-list</u> }]
               Specifies foreground colors of doors. The default is <u>"gray85"</u>.

       <b>Doors</b> { <u>door-list</u> }
               This  variable  is used to create doors, which are teleports.  Each item in the door-list has the
               following format:
                   "<u>winname</u>"    "<u>location</u>"    "<u>jumpTo</u>"

               Windows with the name <u>winname</u> appear with geometry and position as defined in <u>location</u>, and  warp
               the user to <u>jumpTo</u> when <b>f.enterdoor</b> is executed inside them.  Doors have a class of "VTWM Door".

       <b>EnhancedExecResources</b>
               By  default,  <b>f.exec</b> variables behaved as they always did in <b>vtwm</b>.  You would have to append " &amp;"
               to all of your variables in order to execute them without blocking the window manager.  With this
               option turned on, you don't have to; <b>vtwm</b> will automatically append " &amp;" to the  <b>f.exec</b>  variable
               <u>unless</u>  the  last non-space character is either '&amp;' or (in case you still want a command to block
               the window manager) ';'. For example, in a variable such as:
                   f.exec "foo; bar; baz"
               the window manager will be blocked so that "foo" and "bar" can be executed;  "baz"  is  the  only
               command  which  will  NOT  block  the  window  manager.   If  you  want  all these commands to be
               backgrounded, try the following:
                   f.exec "{ foo; bar; baz }" # note that "{" and "}"
                                              # are shell keywords; they
                                              # MUST be separated by
                                              # spaces.

               If you still want a command to block the window manager, you would use:
                   f.exec "xset fp rehash;" # vtwm will not append " &amp;"
                                            # because ';' is the last
                                            # non-space character.

               This behavior was inspired by that of <b><a href="../man1/vuewm.1.html">vuewm</a></b>(1),  Hewlett-Packard's  workspace  implementation  of
               <b><a href="../man1/mwm.1.html">mwm</a></b>(1).

       <b>FixManagedVirtualGeometries</b>

       <b>FixTransientVirtualGeometries</b>
               These are bug workarounds that *should* fix the way most windows' virtual geometries are handled,
               i.e.,  they  should be on the real screen if the parent windows are on the real screen, no matter
               where the virtual desktop is (<b><a href="../man1/xv.1.html">xv</a></b>(1) is one example of how these <u>don't</u> work).  They are  both  set
               by default.

       <b>ForceIcons</b>
               This variable indicates that icon image files specified in the <b>Icons</b> variable should override any
               client-supplied images.

       <b>FramePadding</b> <u>pixels</u>
               This  variable  specifies  the  distance between the titlebar font or the titlebar button height,
               whichever is greater, and the  window  frame,  enlarging  the  titlebar  as  required.  See  also
               <b>ButtonIndent</b>, for how it influences the titlebar. The default is <u>2</u> pixels.

       <b>IconBackground</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable  specifies  the  background  color of icons, and may only be specified inside of a
               <b>Color</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The optional <u>win-list</u> is a list of window names  and  colors  so  that
               per-window  colors  may be specified.  See the <b>BorderColor</b> variable for a complete description of
               the <u>win-list</u>.  The default is <u>"maroon"</u> for color displays or <u>"gray50"</u> for monochrome displays.

       <b>IconBevelWidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
               Tells <b>vtwm</b> to use 3D-looking icons, and specifies the width in pixels of the bevel.  The  default
               is <u>0</u> if <b>vtwm</b> is built with 2D features, or <u>2</u> when <b>vtwm</b> is built with 3D features.

       <b>IconBorderColor</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable specifies the color of the border used for icon windows, and may only be specified
               inside of a <b>Color</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The optional <u>win-list</u> is a list of window names and colors
               so that per-window colors may  be  specified.   See  the  <b>BorderColor</b>  variable  for  a  complete
               description of the <u>win-list</u>.  The default is <u>"gray85"</u>.

       <b>IconBorderWidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
               This  variable specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding icon windows.  The default
               is <u>2</u> if <b>vtwm</b> is built with 2D features, or <u>0</u> when <b>vtwm</b> is built with 3D features.

       <b>IconDirectory</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the directory that should be searched if an image file cannot be found in
               any of the directories in the <b>bitmapFilePath</b> variable.

       <b>IconFont</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the font to be used to display icon names within icons.  The  default  is
               <u>"-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-*-*"</u>.

       <b>IconForeground</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable  specifies  the foreground color to be used when displaying icons, and may only be
               specified inside of a <b>Color</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The optional <u>win-list</u> is a list of window  names
               and  colors  so  that  per-window  colors  may  be specified.  See the <b>BorderColor</b> variable for a
               complete description of the <u>win-list</u>.  The default is <u>"gray85"</u>.

       <b>IconifyByUnmapping</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This variable indicates that windows should be iconified by being unmapped without trying to  map
               any  icons.  If the optional <u>win-list</u> is provided, only those windows will be iconified by simply
               unmapping.  Windows that have both this and  the  <b>IconManagerDontShow</b>  options  set  may  not  be
               accessible  unless  the  user  has  provided bindings to the warp functions (<b>f.warp</b> and the like)
               while <b>WarpUnmapped</b> is set, or by the <b>VTWM</b> <b>Windows</b> menu.  It is set by default.

       <b>IconManagerBackground</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This variable specifies the background color to use for icon manager entries,  and  may  only  be
               specified  inside of a <b>Color</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The optional <u>win-list</u> is a list of window names
               and colors so that per-window colors may be  specified.   See  the  <b>BorderColor</b>  variable  for  a
               complete description of the <u>win-list</u>.  The default is <u>"maroon"</u> for color displays or <u>"gray50"</u> for
               monochrome displays.

       <b>IconManagerBevelWidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
               Tells  <b>vtwm</b>  to  use  3D-looking icon manager entries, and specifies the width in pixels of their
               bevels.  The default is <u>0</u> if <b>vtwm</b> is built with 2D features, or <u>1</u> when  <b>vtwm</b>  is  built  with  3D
               features.

       <b>IconManagerDontShow</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable  indicates  that the icon manager should not display any windows.  If the optional
               <u>win-list</u> is given, only those windows will not be displayed.  This variable is  used  to  prevent
               windows  that  are  rarely  iconified  (such as <u>xclock</u> or <u>xload</u>) from taking up space in the icon
               manager.  The default is:
                   <b>IconManagerDontShow</b>
                   {
                       "VTWM *"
                       "xclock"
                       "xload"
                   }

       <b>IconManagerFont</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the font to be used when displaying icon manager entries.  The default is
               <u>"-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-*-*"</u>.

       <b>IconManagerForeground</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This variable specifies the foreground color to be used when displaying icon manager entries, and
               may only be specified inside of a <b>Color</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The optional <u>win-list</u> is a  list  of
               window names and colors so that per-window colors may be specified.  See the <b>BorderColor</b> variable
               for a complete description of the <u>win-list</u>.  The default is <u>"gray85"</u>.

       <b>IconManagerGeometry</b> <u>string</u> [ <u>columns</u> ]
               This variable indicates that a default icon manager is to be created, with the geometry specified
               with  <u>string</u>.  The  <u>string</u> argument should be a standard X geometry specification, specifying the
               initial size and/or location.  The icon manager window is then broken  into  <u>columns</u>  pieces  and
               scaled according to the number of entries in the icon manager.  Extra entries are wrapped to form
               additional rows.  The default <u>string</u> is <u>"+0+0"</u>, and the default <u>columns</u> is <u>1</u>.

       <b>IconManagerHighlight</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This variable specifies the border color to be used when highlighting the icon manager entry that
               currently  has  the  focus,  and can only be specified inside of a <b>Color</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The
               optional <u>win-list</u> is a list of  window  names  and  colors  so  that  per-window  colors  may  be
               specified.  See the <b>BorderColor</b> variable for a complete description of the <u>win-list</u>.  The default
               is <u>"black"</u>.

       <b>IconManagers</b> { <u>iconmgr-list</u> }
               This  variable  specifies  a  list  of  icon  managers to create, in addition to the default icon
               manager if <b>IconManagerGeometry</b> is used.  Each item in the <u>iconmgr-list</u> has the following format:
                   "<u>winname</u>"    ["<u>iconname</u>"]    "<u>geometry</u>"    <u>columns</u>
               where <u>winname</u> is the name of the windows that should be put into this icon manager,  <u>iconname</u>  is
               the  name  of that icon manager window's icon, <u>geometry</u> is a standard geometry specification, and
               <u>columns</u> is the number of columns in this icon manager as described in  <b>IconManagerGeometry</b>.   For
               example:
                   <b>IconManagers</b>
                   {
                       "XTerm"     "300x5+800+5"    5
                       "myhost"    "400x5+100+5"    2
                   }

               Clients  whose  name  or class is "XTerm" will have an entry created in the "XTerm" icon manager.
               Clients whose name was "myhost" would be put into the "myhost" icon manager.

       <b>IconManagerShow</b> { <u>win-list</u> }
               This variable specifies a list of windows that should appear in the icon manager.  When  used  in
               conjunction with the <b>IconManagerDontShow</b> variable, only the windows in this list will be shown in
               the icon manager.  By default, all windows are shown except those in <b>IconManagerDontShow</b>.

       <b>IconRegion</b> <u>geomstr</u> <u>vgrav</u> <u>hgrav</u> <u>hgrid</u> <u>vgrid</u>
               This  variable specifies an area on the root window in which icons are placed if no specific icon
               location is provided by the client.  The  <u>geomstr</u>  is  a  quoted  string  containing  a  standard
               geometry  specification  for  the  region size and location.  If more than one <b>IconRegion</b> line is
               given, icons will be put into the succeeding regions when the first is full.  The <u>vgrav</u>  argument
               should be either <b>North</b> or <b>South</b> and is used to control whether icons are first filled in from the
               top  or bottom of the region.  Similarly, the <u>hgrav</u> argument should be either <b>East</b> or <b>West</b> and is
               used to control whether icons should be filled in from the left or right.  Icons are laid out  in
               a  grid  with cells <u>hgrid</u> pixels wide and <u>vgrid</u> pixels high.  Note that the smallest dimension of
               the region must be at least the size of the largest icon in it in the same direction.  Note  also
               that  many  applications change their icon name as they run, and no provision is made to reformat
               the icon regions if any icon changes size accordingly.

       <b>Icons</b> { <u>win-list</u> }
               This variable specifies a list of window names and the image filenames that  should  be  used  as
               their icons.  For example:
                   <b>Icons</b>
                   {
                       "XTerm"    "xterm.icon"
                       "xfd"      "xfd_icon"
                   }

               Windows that match "XTerm" and would not be iconified by unmapping, and would try to use the icon
               image  in the file "xterm.icon".  If <b>ForceIcons</b> is specified, this image will be used even if the
               client has requested its own icon image.

       <b>IgnoreModifiers</b> <u>modlist</u>
               This variable specifies the "shift states" to ignore when determining if an  event  is  bound  by
               <b>vtwm</b>. In this example:
                   <b>IgnoreModifiers</b>    l | m2
               the  CapsLock and NumLock states will be ignored. Note that the use of this variable can generate
               quite a bit of X protocol network traffic; <u>modlist</u> should be kept as small as possible. See  also
               the <b>BINDINGS</b> section.

       <b>InfoBevelWidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
               Tells <b>vtwm</b> to use 3D-looking identify, move and resize windows, and specifies the width in pixels
               of  the  bevel.  The default is <u>0</u> if <b>vtwm</b> is built with 2D features, or <u>2</u> when <b>vtwm</b> is built with
               3D features.

       <b>InfoFont</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the font to be used for in the identify window.  The default is  <u>"-adobe-</u>
               <u>helvetica-bold-r-normal--*-100-*-*-*-*-*-*"</u>.

       <b>InterpolateMenuColors</b>
               This  variable  indicates  that  menu entry colors should be interpolated between entry specified
               colors.  In this example:
                   <b>Menu</b>    "mymenu"
                   {
                       "Title"     ("black":"red")      f.title
                       "entry1"                         f.nop
                       "entry2"                         f.nop
                       "entry3"    ("white":"green")    f.nop
                       "entry4"                         f.nop
                       "entry5"    ("red":"white")      f.nop
                   }
               the foreground colors for "entry1" and "entry2" will be interpolated between black and white, and
               the background colors between red and green.  Similarly, the  foreground  for  "entry4"  will  be
               half-way between white and red, and the background will be half-way between green and white.

       <b>LessRandomZoomZoom</b>
               With  this  option turned on, this makes random zooms a bit less "random" and a bit more visible.
               This might make a better visual bell, depending on your personal taste.

       <b>MakeTitle</b> { <u>win-list</u> }
               This variable specifies a list of windows on which a titlebar should be placed  and  is  used  to
               request titles on specific windows when <b>NoTitle</b> has been set.

       <b>MaxWindowSize</b> <u>string</u>
               This  variable  specifies  a  geometry  in which the width and height give the maximum size for a
               given window.  This is typically used to restrict windows to the size of the screen.  The default
               is <u>"30000x30000"</u>.

       <b>MenuBackground</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the background color used for menus, and can only be specified inside  of
               a  <b>Color</b>  or  <b>Monochrome</b>  list.   The  default  is  <u>"maroon"</u>  for  color displays or <u>"gray50"</u> for
               monochrome displays.

       <b>MenuBevelWidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
               Tells <b>vtwm</b> to use 3D-looking menus, and specifies the width in pixels of the bevel.  The  default
               is <u>0</u> if <b>vtwm</b> is built with 2D features, or <u>2</u> when <b>vtwm</b> is built with 3D features.

       <b>MenuFont</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the font to use when displaying menus.  The default is <u>"-adobe-helvetica-</u>
               <u>bold-r-normal--*-120-*-*-*-*-*-*"</u>.

       <b>MenuForeground</b> <u>string</u>
               This  variable specifies the foreground color used for menus, and can only be specified inside of
               a <b>Color</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The default is <u>"gray85"</u>.

       <b>MenuScrollBorderWidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
               When the contents of a menu would make it taller than the  display,  moving  the  pointer  within
               <u>pixels</u> of the top or bottom of the menu causes it to scroll the entries.  The default value is <u>2</u>.

       <b>MenuScrollJump</b> <u>entries</u>
               This variable specifies the number of entries to scroll when the pointer is moved within the area
               defined by <b>MenuScrollBorderWidth</b>.  The default is <u>3</u> entries.

       <b>MenuShadowColor</b> <u>string</u>
               This  variable specifies the color of the shadow behind pull-down menus and can only be specified
               inside of a <b>Color</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The default is <u>"black"</u>.

       <b>MenuTitleBackground</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the background color for <b>f.title</b>  entries  in  menus,  and  can  only  be
               specified inside of a <b>Color</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The default is <u>"gray70"</u>.

       <b>MenuTitleFont</b> <u>string</u>
               This  variable  specifies  the font to be used in menu titles.  The default is <u>"-adobe-helvetica-</u>
               <u>bold-r-normal--*-120-*-*-*-*-*-*"</u>.

       <b>MenuTitleForeground</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the foreground color for  <b>f.title</b>  entries  in  menus  and  can  only  be
               specified  inside  of  a <b>Color</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The default is <u>"maroon"</u> for color displays or
               <u>"gray50"</u> for monochrome displays.

       <b>Monochrome</b> { <u>colors</u> }
               This variable specifies a list of color assignments that should be made if the screen has a depth
               of 1.  See the description of <b>Colors</b>.

       <b>MoveDelta</b> <u>pixels</u>
               This variable specifies the number of pixels the pointer must move before the <b>f.move</b> and <b>f.resize</b>
               functions and initial menu highlighting starts working.  See also the <b>f.deltastop</b> function.   The
               default is <u>3</u> pixels.

       <b>NailedAbove</b>
               This variable causes nailed windows to be physically above non-nailed windows.  The <b>f.nailedabove</b>
               function can be used to toggle this setting.

       <b>NailedDown</b> { <u>list</u> }
               This variable gives a <u>list</u> of clients that are nailed initially.  The default is:
                   <b>NailedDown</b>
                   {
                       "VTWM *"
                       "xclock"
                       "xload"
                   }

       <b>NaturalAutopanBehavior</b>
               By default, when autopanning, the pointer is warped by only
                   (<b>AutoPanBorderWidth</b> + <b>AutoPanExtraWarp</b>)
               pixels  on the real screen.  With this option turned on, the pointer is warped on the real screen
               by as many pixels as the screen is scrolled, or the above value, whichever is greater.  Thus, the
               pointer does not normally move very much (only by <b>AutoPanExtraWarp</b>) in relation  to  the  virtual
               desktop.

               This  works really well on faster X terminals and workstations, although for slower ones, you may
               want to use the following:
                   <b>AutoPanWarpWithRespectToRealScreen</b>    50
               to achieve a similar effect.  Setting <b>NaturalAutopanBehavior</b> has the exact same effect  as  using
               the variable
                   <b>AutoPanWarpWithRespectToRealScreen</b>    100

       <b>NoBackingStore</b>
               This  variable  indicates  that  <b>vtwm</b>'s  windows  should  not  request  backing store to minimize
               repainting.  This is typically used with servers that can repaint faster  than  they  can  handle
               backing store.

       <b>NoBorder</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This variable indicates that windows should not have borders.  If the optional <u>win-list</u> is given,
               only those windows will not have borders.

       <b>NoBorderDecorations</b>
               This  variable  indicates that the 3D borders of titled windows should not have the little divots
               adorning the corners.

       <b>NoCaseSensitive</b>
               This variable indicates that case should be ignored when sorting icon names in an  icon  manager.
               This  option  is  typically used with applications that capitalize the first letter of their icon
               name.

       <b>NoDefaultMouseOrKeyboardBindings</b>
               This variable indicates that <b>vtwm</b> should not supply the default pointer  and  keyboard  bindings.
               This  option should only be used if the startup file contains a completely new set of pointer and
               keyboard bindings and definitions.  See also <b>NoDefaults</b>.

       <b>NoDefaults</b>
               This variable indicates that <b>vtwm</b> should not supply the default titlebar  buttons  and  bindings.
               This option should only be used if the startup file contains a completely new set of bindings and
               definitions.   This  function has the effect of setting both <b>NoDefaultMouseOrKeyboardBindings</b> and
               <b>NoDefaultTitleButtons</b>.

       <b>NoDefaultTitleButtons</b>
               This variable indicates that <b>vtwm</b> should not supply the default titlebar  buttons.   This  option
               should  only  be  used  if  the  startup  file  contains  a completely new set of titlebar button
               definitions.  See also <b>NoDefaults</b>.

       <b>NoGrabServer</b>
               This variable indicates that <b>vtwm</b> should minimize server grabs when popping up menus  and  moving
               or resizing windows.

       <b>NoHighlight</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable  indicates  that  borders  should  not be highlighted to track the location of the
               pointer.  If the optional <u>win-list</u> is  given,  highlighting  will  only  be  disabled  for  those
               windows.   When the border is highlighted, it will be drawn in the current <b>BorderColor</b>.  When the
               border is not  highlighted,  it  will  be  stippled  with  an  gray  pattern  using  the  current
               <b>BorderTileForeground</b> and <b>BorderTileBackground</b> colors.  It is set by default if <b>vtwm</b> is built with
               3D features.

       <b>NoIconManagerFocus</b>
               This  variable indicates that <b>vtwm</b> should not set focus to windows corresponding to their entries
               in an icon manager.  Normally, <b>vtwm</b> sets the focus so  that  events  from  an  icon  manager  are
               delivered  to  the  application.  Typically, this is set to facilitate icon manager bindings that
               would otherwise be delivered to the application.

       <b>NoIconManagerHighlight</b>
               This variable indicates that icon manager entries will not be highlighted to track  the  location
               of the pointer. This is independant of the <b>NoHighlight</b> variable.

       <b>NoIconManagers</b>
               This variable indicates that no icon manager should be created.

       <b>NoIconifyIconManagers</b>
               This variable indicates that no icon manager should be iconified.

       <b>NoMenuShadows</b>
               This  variable  indicates  that  menus  should  not have drop shadows drawn behind them.  This is
               typically used with slower servers since it speeds up menu drawing at the expense of  making  the
               menu slightly harder to read.

       <b>NoOpaqueMove</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]

       <b>NoOpaqueResize</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               These  variables  indicate  that  the <b>f.move</b> and <b>f.resize</b> functions should change just a window's
               outline.  If the optional <u>win-list</u> is given, only those  windows  will  be  affected.  These  are
               usually used to narrow the scope of "global" <b>OpaqueMove</b> and <b>OpaqueResize</b> variables.

       <b>NoPrettyTitles</b>
               If  you  don't  mind  long  titles  butting up against the right edge of short titlebars and icon
               managers. Disables the default behavior of using ellipses to indicate a truncated title.

       <b>NoRaiseOnDeiconify</b>

       <b>NoRaiseOnMove</b>

       <b>NoRaiseOnResize</b>

       <b>NoRaiseOnWarp</b>
               These variables indicate that windows should not be raised after a deiconify,  move,  resize,  or
               warp  operation,  and  are  typically  used  to preserve the window stacking order. Note that the
               pointer may end up in an occluding window when these variables are used.

       <b>NoSaveUnders</b>
               This variable indicates that menus should not request save-unders to minimize  window  repainting
               following  menu  selection.  It is typically used with displays that can repaint faster than they
               can handle save-unders.

       <b>NoStackMode</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This variable indicates that client window requests to change stacking order should  be  ignored.
               If  the  optional  <u>win-list</u>  is  given,  only requests on those windows will be ignored.  This is
               typically used to prevent applications from relentlessly popping themselves to the front  of  the
               window stack.

       <b>NoTitle</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable  indicates  that  windows  should not have titlebars.  If the optional <u>win-list</u> is
               given, only those windows will not have titlebars.  <b>MakeTitle</b> may be used  with  this  option  to
               force titlebars to be put on specific windows.  The default is:
                   <b>NoTitle</b>
                   {
                       "VTWM *"
                       "xclock"
                       "xload"
                   }

       <b>NoTitleFocus</b>
               This  variable  indicates  that  <b>vtwm</b> should not set keyboard input focus to each window as it is
               entered.  Normally, <b>vtwm</b> sets the focus so that focus and key events from the titlebar  and  icon
               managers  are  delivered to the application.  If the pointer is moved quickly and <b>vtwm</b> is slow to
               respond, input can be directed to the old window instead of the new.  This  option  is  typically
               used to prevent this "input lag" and to work around bugs in older applications that have problems
               with focus events.

       <b>NoTitleHighlight</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable  indicates  that the highlight area of the titlebar, which is used to indicate the
               window that currently has the input focus, should not be displayed.  If the optional <u>win-list</u>  is
               given,  only  those windows will not have highlight areas.  This and the <b>SqueezeTitle</b> options can
               be set to substantially reduce the amount of screen space required by titlebars.

       <b>NotVirtualGeometries</b>
               This variable indicates that <b>vtwm</b> should assume that user geometries should be  relative  to  the
               current  virtual  window, as opposed to absolute.  If you set this, then "xterm -geometry +20+20"
               specifies a position in the current view; otherwise, it would specify a position in the  top-left
               view.  It is set by default.

       <b>NoWindowRing</b> { <u>win-list</u> }
               This  variable  specifies  a  list  of windows that will not be added to the list along which the
               <b>f.warpring</b> function cycles.  See also <b>WindowRing</b>.

       <b>OldFashionedTwmWindowsMenu</b>

       <b>OldFashionedVtwmWindowsMenu</b>
               By default, the <b>VTWM</b> <b>Windows</b> menu will use the same colors that  you  see  in  the  panner.  This
               variable disables that behavior.

       <b>OpaqueMove</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]

       <b>OpaqueResize</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               These variables indicate that the <b>f.move</b> and <b>f.resize</b> functions should actually change the window
               instead  of  just an outline so that the user can immediately see what the window will look like.
               If the optional <u>win-list</u> is given, only those windows will be affected "opaquely".  These options
               are typically used on fast systems (particularly when <b>NoGrabServer</b> is set).

       <b>PanDistanceX</b> <u>N</u>

       <b>PanDistanceY</b> <u>N</u>
               These variables define a grid of screens for the virtual desktop,  expressed  as  <u>N%</u>  of  a  real
               screen.  When  the  <b>f.snap</b>  function is called, the real screen will be moved to the closest grid
               location. The (mis)naming of these variables is for historical reasons. The default value is <u>100</u>,
               effectively setting up "pages" in the virtual desktop.

       <b>PanResistance</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
               This variable indicates how hard it should be to pan to an adjacent virtual screen.  It specifies
               how long the pointer must be within <b>AutoPanBorderWidth</b> pixels of the real screen's edge.   Values
               equal to <u>0</u> or greater than <u>10000</u> disables this feature.  The default is <u>750</u> milliseconds.

       <b>PauseOnExit</b> <u>N</u>

       <b>PauseOnQuit</b> <u>N</u>
               These  variables  define  a  delay  on exit, expressed in seconds. They allow the <b>(vtwm</b> <b>stop)</b> and
               <b>f.quit</b> sounds time to play before the connection to <b><a href="../man8/rplayd.8.html">rplayd</a></b>(8) is closed.

       <b>Pixmaps</b> { <u>pixmaps</u> }
               This variable specifies a list of images that define the appearance  of  various  windows.   Each
               entry  is  a  keyword  indicating  the window to set, followed by a string giving the name of the
               image. Built-in and external images may be freely mixed, given the constraints described  in  the
               <b>IMAGE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>AUDIO</b> <b>FORMATS</b> section.  The following windows may be specified thus:
                   <b>Pixmaps</b>
                   {
                       TitleHighlight             ":xpm:sunkenbox"
                       RealScreenPixmap           "scaledbackground.xpm"
                       VirtualBackgroundPixmap    "gray1"
                       MenuIconPixmap             ":xpm:rarrow"
                       IconManagerPixmap          ":xpm:zoom"
                   }

               By default, the <b>TitleHighlight</b> is an even, stippled pattern if <b>vtwm</b> is built with 2D features, or
               "sunken"  lines  when  <b>vtwm</b>  is  built  with  3D features. The <b>MenuIconPixmap</b> is a right arrow by
               default (rendered 3D as appropriate), and the default <b>IconManagerPixmap</b> is either the X logo or a
               "raised" box, for 2D or 3D features, respectively.

       <b>PointerPlacement</b>
               This variable indicates that windows with no specified geometry should be placed with the  window
               origin at the location of the mouse pointer or, if <b>WarpSnug</b> is specified, as close as possible to
               that location such that the window fits onto the real screen. If <b>RandomPlacement</b> is also set then
               it takes precedence.

       <b>PrettyZoom</b>
               If  <b>Zoom</b> is turned on, this makes the associated animation look just a little nicer, depending on
               your personal taste.  This makes the zoom slower, however, so you may have to decrease the  value
               of the <b>Zoom</b> variable.

       <b>RaiseDelay</b> <u>milliseconds</u>
               For  windows  that  are  to  be  automatically  raised when the pointer enters (see the <b>AutoRaise</b>
               variable and the <b>f.autoraise</b> function) this variable specifies the length  of  time  the  pointer
               should rest in the window before it is raised.  The default is <u>0</u> milliseconds.

       <b>RaiseOnStart</b>
               This  variable specifies that the raise which would normally occur at the end of a move or resize
               operation (subject to <b>MoveDelta</b>, <b>NoRaiseOnMove</b>, and <b>NoRaiseOnResize</b>) will occur at the  start  of
               the  operation.  This  may be useful when <b>OpaqueMove</b> and/or <b>OpaqueResize</b> are specified. Note that
               cancelling a move or resize operation with  this  variable  set  will  not  preserve  the  window
               stacking order.

       <b>RandomPlacement</b>
               This  variable  indicates  that  windows with no specified geometry should be placed in a pseudo-
               random location instead of having the  user  drag  an  outline  (or  the  window  itself  if  the
               <b>OpaqueMove</b> variable is set) to the preferred location.

       <b>RealScreenBackground</b> <u>string</u>
               See <b>RealScreenForeground</b>.

       <b>RealScreenBorderWidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
               This  value  specifies  the border width of the <b>RealScreen</b> window (see <b>RealScreenForeground</b>). The
               default value is <u>0</u> pixels.

       <b>RealScreenForeground</b> <u>string</u>
               Inside what <b>vtwm</b> calls the virtual desktop window, but which we might call  the  "panner",  is  a
               little  window that shows where the physical screen is located in virtual space.  The <b>vtwm</b> source
               code calls this little window the  RealScreen.   By  default,  it  has  no  border,  and  can  be
               distinguished  from the normal backdrop of the panner only by its color or image.  Its foreground
               color  has  no  meaning  unless  you  give  it  an  image.   (It  can  be  given  a  border  with
               <b>RealScreenBorderWidth</b>.)

       <b>RealScreenPixmap</b> <u>string</u>
               Names an image file used to decorate the RealScreen window.  A sample is provided, <u>nestedsqu.xbm</u>,
               but  your mileage may vary as the size of your screen varies!  It is easy to find out the size of
               this window and to create any image file of type <b><a href="../man1/bitmap.1.html">bitmap</a></b>(1) or  <b><a href="../man1/pixmap.1.html">pixmap</a></b>(1)  for  it;  that  is  the
               recommended procedure.

       <b>ResizeFont</b> <u>string</u>
               This  variable  specifies the font to be used for in the dimensions window when resizing windows.
               The default is <u>"-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--*-120-*-*-*-*-*-*"</u>.

       <b>ResizeRegion</b> <u>location</u>
               This variable specifies the area on the screen to display the resize window.  The <u>location</u> should
               be one of <b>NorthWest</b>, <b>NorthEast</b>, <b>SouthWest</b>, <b>SouthEast</b>, or <b>Centered</b>.

       <b>RestartPreviousState</b>
               This variable indicates that <b>vtwm</b> should attempt to use the WM_STATE property on  client  windows
               to  tell  which  windows should be iconified and which should be left visible.  This is typically
               used to try to regenerate the state that the screen was in before the previous window manager was
               shutdown. It is set by default.

       <b>RightHandSidePulldownMenus</b>
               Pull-down menus can appear when the pointer is to the right of the center of their  parent  menu,
               or  they  can  appear  when  the  pointer is closer to the right edge of their parent menu.  This
               option enables the latter behavior, and is the default.

       <b>SaveColor</b> { <u>colors-list</u> }
               This variable indicates a list of color assignments to be stored as  pixel  values  in  the  root
               window property _MIT_PRIORITY_COLORS.  Clients may elect to preserve these values when installing
               their  own  colormap.   Note  that use of this mechanism is a way an for application to avoid the
               "technicolor" problem, whereby useful  screen  objects  such  as  window  borders  and  titlebars
               disappear when a programs custom colors are installed by the window manager.  For example:
                   <b>SaveColor</b>
                   {
                       BorderColor
                       TitleBackground
                       TitleForeground
                       "red"
                       "green"
                       "blue"
                   }

               This  would  place  on  the  root window 3 pixel values for borders and titlebars, as well as the
               three color strings, all taken from the default colormap.

       <b>ShallowReliefWindowButton</b>
               This indicates that the features of built-in 3D titlebar buttons, the 3D icon manager button  the
               3D  menu  pull-right icon, and the 3D titlebar highlight area should be rendered with a "flatter"
               appearance. It is set by default if <b>vtwm</b> is built with 3D features.

       <b>ShowIconManager</b>
               This variable indicates that the icon manager window should be displayed when  <b>vtwm</b>  is  started.
               It can always be brought up using the <b>f.showiconmgr</b> function.

       <b>SnapRealScreen</b>
               This  variable  causes the real screen to snap to a grid defined in <b>PanDistanceX</b> and <b>PanDistanceY</b>
               increments whenever the representation moves. The <b>f.snaprealscreen</b> function can be used to toggle
               this setting.

       <b>SortIconManager</b>
               This variable indicates that entries in the icon manager should be sorted  alphabetically  rather
               than by simply appending new windows to the end. It is set by default.

       <b>SoundHost</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies what machine (by its <u>TCP/IP</u> <u>hostname</u>) is running the <b><a href="../man8/rplayd.8.html">rplayd</a></b>(8) daemon. If
               not specified, the local machine is tried. If <b><a href="../man8/rplayd.8.html">rplayd</a></b>(8) cannot be accessed, sound will be toggled
               off.

       <b>Sounds</b> { <u>sound-list</u> }
               This  variable  is  a  list of identifiers and associated sound files. It contains entries of the
               form:
                   "<u>identifier</u>"    "<u>soundfile</u>"    [<u>volume</u>]
               where <u>identifier</u> is any function described in the <b>BINDINGS</b> section except <b>f.playsound</b>,  <b>f.sounds</b>,
               and  <b>f.separator</b>,  as  well  as these event identifiers: <b>(vtwm</b> <b>start)</b>, <b>(vtwm</b> <b>stop)</b>, <b>(client</b> <b>map)</b>,
               <b>(client</b> <b>unmap)</b>, <b>(menu</b> <b>map)</b>, <b>(menu</b> <b>unmap)</b>, <b>(info</b> <b>unmap)</b>, <b>(autopan</b> <b>event)</b>, and  <b>(bell</b>  <b>event)</b>.  The
               <u>soundfile</u>  is  the  full  pathname  of  the sound file to play for the associated <u>identifier</u>, and
               <u>volume</u> sets the volume for which to play that sound (see also <b>SoundVolume</b>). Note  that  the  list
               entries must be quoted:
                   <b>Sounds</b>
                   {
                       "(vtwm start)"    "/usr/share/sounds/wowee.wav"
                       "(vtwm stop)"     "/usr/share/sounds/seeya.wav"
                       "f.exec"          "/usr/share/sounds/click.au"   50
                       "(client map)"    "/usr/share/sounds/ping.au"    50
                       "f.delete"        "/usr/share/sounds/doh1.wav"
                       "f.deletedoor"    "/usr/share/sounds/doh2.wav"
                       "f.destroy"       "/usr/share/sounds/doh3.wav"
                       "(client unmap)"  "/usr/share/sounds/ping.au"
                   }

               This example points out that some <u>identifier</u>s "overlap":
                   f.beep &gt; (bell event)            f.exec &gt; (client map)
                   f.delete &gt; (client unmap)        f.menu &gt; (menu map)
                   f.deletedoor &gt; (client unmap)    f.quit &gt; (vtwm stop)
                   f.destroy &gt; (client unmap)       f.version = f.identify

               In these cases, the function takes precedence over the event when both would otherwise play.

       <b>SoundVolume</b> <u>N</u>
               This  variable  sets  the  overall  volume  for which to play sounds, expressed as <u>N%</u> of maximum.
               Default is <u>25</u> (1/4 attenuation).

       <b>SqueezeTitle</b> [{ <u>squeeze-list</u> }]
               This variable indicates that <b>vtwm</b> should attempt to use the SHAPE  extension  to  make  titlebars
               occupy  only  as much screen space as they need, rather than extending all the way across the top
               of the window.  The optional <u>squeeze-list</u> may be used to control the  location  of  the  squeezed
               titlebar along the top of the window.  It contains entries of the form:
                   "<u>name</u>"    <u>justification</u>    <u>num</u>    <u>denom</u>
               where  <u>name</u>  is  a window name, <u>justification</u> is either <b>left</b>, <b>center</b>, or <b>right</b>, and <u>num</u> and <u>denom</u>
               are numbers specifying a ratio for the relative position about which  the  titlebar  is  located,
               measured from left to right.  A ratio of 0/0 indicates that the <u>justification</u> is absolute, A non-
               zero  numerator with a zero denominator indicates a pixel count, and the <u>justification</u> is ignored
               entirely for any other ratio.  For example:
                   <b>SqueezeTitle</b>
                   {
                       "XTerm"     left      0    0
                       "xterm1"    left      1    3
                       "xterm2"    right     2    3
                       "oclock"    center    0    0
                       "emacs"     right     0    0
                   }

               The <b>DontSqueezeTitle</b> list can be used to turn off squeezing on  certain  titles.  It  is  set  by
               default.

       <b>StartIconified</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable  indicates  that client windows should initially be left as icons until explicitly
               deiconified by the user.  If the optional <u>win-list</u> is given, only those windows will  be  started
               iconic.   This  is  useful  for  programs  that  do not support an <u>-iconic</u> command line option or
               resource.

       <b>StaticIconPositions</b>
               This variable alters icon placement such that they will maintain their positions on  the  virtual
               desktop  when  not  nailed  and  <b>DeiconifyToScreen</b>  is  not  used.   This is most applicable when
               <b>SnapRealScreen</b> and <b>AutoPan</b> is used with <b>PanDistanceX</b> and <b>PanDistanceY</b> values to simulate  <b><a href="../man1/ctwm.1.html">ctwm</a></b>(1)
               workspaces.

       <b>StayUpMenus</b>
               This variable alters menu interaction.  By default, a menu item is selected when a pointer button
               is  released  over  it.   This variable causes menu items to be selected on the next button press
               event.

       <b>StayUpOptionalMenus</b>
               This variable is similar to <b>StayUpMenus</b>, except that if any menu items  are  selected,  the  menu
               interaction  reverts to the old behavior.  For example, suppose you have the right pointer button
               bound to bring up a menu with a title bar.  Clicking the right button and releasing it (over  the
               title  bar)  will bring up the menu and have it stay up until you click on a menu item.  Clicking
               the right button, moving the pointer to a menu item, and releasing the right button will activate
               that menu item and dismiss the menu.

       <b>Sticky</b> { <u>list</u> }
               A synonym for <b>NailedDown</b>.

       <b>StickyAbove</b>
               A synonym for <b>NailedAbove</b>.

       <b>StrictIconManager</b>
               This variable causes icon managers to list only those windows that are in an iconified state.

       <b>TitleBackground</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This variable specifies the background color used in titlebars, and may only be specified  inside
               of  a  <b>Color</b>  or  <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The optional <u>win-list</u> is a list of window names and colors so
               that per-window colors may be specified. The default is <u>"maroon"</u> for color displays  or  <u>"gray50"</u>
               for monochrome displays.

       <b>TitleBevelWidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
               Tells  <b>vtwm</b>  to  use  3D-looking  titlebars,  and specifies the width in pixels of the bevel that
               surrounds the titlebar. If the value of <b>ButtonIndent</b> added to <b>FramePadding</b> equals zero, the bevel
               will be bound to the text and highlight area. The default is <u>0</u> if <b>vtwm</b> is built with 2D features,
               or <u>1</u> when <b>vtwm</b> is built with 3D features..

       <b>TitleButtonBorderWidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
               This variable specifies the width in pixels of the border surrounding titlebar buttons, drawn  in
               the  <b>TitleForeground</b>  color. The default is <u>1</u> if <b>vtwm</b> is built with 2D bitmaps, or <u>0</u> when <b>vtwm</b> is
               built with 3D pixmaps.

       <b>TitleFont</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the font to used for displaying window names in titlebars.   The  default
               is <u>"-adobe-helvetica-bold-r-normal--*-120-*-*-*-*-*-*"</u>.

       <b>TitleForeground</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable specifies the foreground color used in titlebars, and may only be specified inside
               of a <b>Color</b> or <b>Monochrome</b> list.  The optional <u>win-list</u> is a list of window  names  and  colors  so
               that  per-window colors may be specified.  The default is <u>"maroon"</u> for color displays or <u>"gray50"</u>
               for monochrome displays.

       <b>TitlePadding</b> <u>pixels</u>
               This variable specifies the distance  between  titlebar  buttons  in  the  titlebar.   Note  that
               distances between buttons and the title, the title and the highlight area, and the highlight area
               and  buttons,  are  all  set  to  a  hard-coded value.  The default is <u>5</u> if <b>vtwm</b> is built with 2D
               features, or <u>0</u> when <b>vtwm</b> is built with 3D features.

       <b>UnknownIcon</b> <u>string</u>
               This variable specifies the filename of an image  file to be used  as  the  default  icon.   This
               image  will  be  used  as  the icon of all clients which do not provide an icon image and are not
               listed in the <b>Icons</b> list.

       <b>UsePPosition</b> <u>string</u> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This variable specifies whether or not <b>vtwm</b> should honor program-requested  locations  (given  by
               the <b>PPosition</b> flag in the WM_NORMAL_HINTS property), in the absence of a user-specified position.
               The  argument  <u>string</u>  may  have  one  of three values:  <u>"off"</u> (the default) indicating that <b>vtwm</b>
               should ignore the program-supplied position, <u>"on"</u> indicating that the position  should  be  used,
               and  <u>"non-zero"</u>  indicating  that the position should used if it is other than (0,0) (for working
               around a bug in older toolkits).  The optional <u>win-list</u> is a list of window names  and  arguments
               that will override the global <u>string</u> argument. For example:
                   <b>UsePPosition</b>    "off"
                   {
                       "MPlayer"   "on"
                   }

       <b>VirtualBackground</b> <u>string</u>
               This  is  the background color for the panner, a.k.a. the Virtual Desktop window.  The default is
               <u>"maroon"</u> for color displays or <u>"gray50"</u> for monochrome displays.

       <b>VirtualBackgroundPixmap</b> <u>string</u>
               Names an image file to decorate the panner.

       <b>VirtualForeground</b> <u>string</u>
               Foreground for the panner; has no use unless you specify a panner image of type <b><a href="../man1/bitmap.1.html">bitmap</a></b>(1).

       <b>VirtualDesktop</b> <u>geometry</u> <u>scale</u>
               This variable must be set to enable the virtual desktop features of <b>vtwm</b>. If this variable is not
               set, <b>vtwm</b> will behave in the same manner as <b>twm</b>. This  variable  specifies  where  to  place  the
               virtual  desktop  window  and  its  size. The <u>geometry</u> is a standard X geometry specification and
               defines the size and location of the window containing the desktop representation.

               The <u>scale</u> parameter specifies the scaling of the virtual desktop window compared to the  desktop.
               The  size  specification  can  be given in three ways: If size is larger than the screen size, it
               represents the size of the whole desktop, and the virtual window desktop size will then  be  size
               divided  by  <u>scale</u>.  When  size  times <u>scale</u> is smaller than the screen size, size represents the
               number of screens that should fit in the desktop. Otherwise  size  represents  the  size  of  the
               virtual desktop window, and the currently accessible virtual desktop is then <u>scale</u> times the size
               of the desktop window. Using the default as an example:
                   <b>VirtualDesktop</b>    "5x2-0-0"    16
               With  <u>scale</u>  set to <u>16</u>, and a physical screen size of 1024x768, the desktop area is 1/16 the size
               of the screen times the number of screens specified:
                   (5 * (1024 / 16)) x (2 * (768 / 16)) = 320 x 96

               The size of the desktop can be changed  dynamically,  by  simply  resizing  the  virtual  desktop
               window.

       <b>VirtualDesktopBevelWidth</b> <u>pixels</u>
               Tells  <b>vtwm</b>  to use a 3D-looking virtual desktop, and specifies the width in pixels of the bevel.
               The default is <u>0</u> if <b>vtwm</b> is built with 2D features, or <u>1</u> when <b>vtwm</b> is built with 3D features.

       <b>VirtualDesktopFont</b> <u>font</u>
               This variable causes <u>font</u> to be used when displaying the names of windows in the virtual  desktop
               display.    If   this   variable   is   not   set,   then  names  will  not  be  displayed.   The
               <b>DesktopDisplayForeground</b> should also be set for this  feature  to  be  useful.   The  default  is
               <u>"-adobe-helvetica-medium-r-normal--*-75-*-*-*-*-*-*"</u>.

       <b>VirtualReceivesMotionEvents</b>

       <b>VirtualSendsMotionEvents</b>
               These variables indicate that changes to the position and dimension of windows on the real screen
               will be reflected in the virtual desktop as they occur, and visa-versa.

       <b>WarpCentered</b> <u>string</u>
               By default, on warps to windows, the pointer goes to either the center of the titlebar, or in the
               absence of, the center of the top border member.  This variable specifies that the pointer should
               warp  to  the  center of the window depending on the <u>string</u> argument: <u>"on"</u> indicates all windows,
               <u>"titled"</u> indicates titled windows only, <u>"untitled"</u> indicates untitled  windows  only,  and  <u>"off"</u>
               (the  default) indicating the default behavior. Note that warps to icon managers are exceptional:
               The pointer always goes to either the active entry, or in the absence of, the top entry.

       <b>WarpCursor</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This variable indicates that the pointer should be warped into windows when they are deiconified.
               If the optional <u>win-list</u> is given, the pointer  will  only  be  warped  when  those  windows  are
               deiconified. It is set by default.

       <b>WarpSnug</b>
               With  this  variable  set, the warp functions (<b>f.warp</b> and the like) will fit the entire window on
               the screen, i.e., they'll be snugged on the real screen.

       <b>WarpToTransients</b>
               This variable indicates that the pointer should be warped into transient windows  when  they  are
               created.

       <b>WarpUnmapped</b>
               This  variable  indicates  that  the  warp  functions  (<b>f.warp</b> and the like) should deiconify any
               iconified windows they encounter.  This is typically used to make a key binding that will  pop  a
               particular  window  (such  as  <u>xmh</u>),  no matter where it is.  The default is for the functions to
               ignore iconified windows.

       <b>WarpVisible</b>
               This variable indicates that the warp functions <b>f.warpclassnext</b>, <b>f.warpclassprev</b>, <b>f.warpring</b>, and
               <b>f.warpto</b> should restrict themselves to windows that are on the screen.  The default  is  for  the
               functions to traverse the entire virtual desktop.

       <b>WarpWindows</b>
               When  warping  to  a  window,  by default the real screen will be moved to find the window on the
               virtual desktop. With this set, the window itself will be warped to the real screen,  moving  the
               window in the virtual desktop.

       <b>WindowRing</b> [{ <u>win-list</u> }]
               This  variable specifies that when windows are created, they should be added to the list that the
               <b>f.warpring</b> function operates on. If the optional <u>win-list</u> is given, then only those windows  will
               be included in the window ring. See also <b>NoWindowRing</b> and <b>f.ring</b>.

       <b>XorValue</b> <u>number</u>
               This  variable  specifies  the value to use when drawing window outlines for moving and resizing.
               This should be set to a value that will result  in  a  variety  of  distinguishable  colors  when
               exclusive-or'ed with the contents of the user's typical screen.  Setting this variable to 1 often
               gives  nice  results  if  adjacent colors in the default colormap are distinct.  By default, <b>vtwm</b>
               will attempt to cause temporary lines to appear at the opposite end  of  the  colormap  from  the
               graphics.

       <b>Zoom</b> [ <u>count</u> ]
               This  variable  indicates that outlines suggesting movement of a window to and from its iconified
               state should be displayed whenever a window is iconified  or  deiconified.   The  optional  <u>count</u>
               argument specifies the number of outlines to be drawn.  The default count is <u>8</u>.

       <b>ZoomZoom</b>
               This  variable modifies zooms such that a random place will be used for the source or destination
               when there isn't an appropriate window (e.g., an icon, icon manager  entry,  or  client  window).
               Default  behavior inhibits zooms when there aren't appropriate windows, except for the <b>f.zoomzoom</b>
               function.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following variables must be set after the fonts have been assigned, so it is usually best to put them
       at the end of the variables or beginning of the bindings sections:

       <b>DefaultFunction</b> <u>function</u>
               This variable specifies the function to be executed when a key or button event  is  received  for
               which  no  binding  is  provided.  This is typically bound to <b>f.nop</b>, <b>f.beep</b>, or a menu containing
               window operations.

       <b>WindowFunction</b> <u>function</u>
               This variable specifies the function to execute when a window is selected from the  <b>VTWM</b>  <b>Windows</b>
               menu.   If  this variable is not set (default), the window will be deiconified and raised.  It is
               strongly recommended that if this is  set,  the  function  includes  provision  for  deiconifying
               windows.

</pre><h4><b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       After the desired variables have been set, functions may be attached titlebar buttons and key and pointer
       buttons.  Titlebar buttons may be added from the left or right side and appear in the titlebar from left-
       to-right  according  to  the  order  in which they are specified.  Key and pointer button bindings may be
       given in any order.

       Titlebuttons specifications must include the name of the image to use in the button box and the  function
       to be invoked when a pointer button is pressed within them:
           <b>LeftTitleButton</b>  "<u>image</u>" = <u>function</u>
       or
           <b>RightTitleButton</b> "<u>image</u>" = <u>function</u>

       See  the  <b>ButtonIndent</b>  and <b>FramePadding</b> variables and the <b>IMAGE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>AUDIO</b> <b>FORMATS</b> section for details on
       the <u>image</u> specification.

       Key and pointer button specifications must give the modifiers that must be pressed, over which  parts  of
       the screen the pointer must be, and what function is to be invoked.  Keys are given as strings containing
       the appropriate keysym name; buttons are given as the keywords <b>Button1</b>-<b>Button5</b>:
           "FP1"   = <u>modlist</u> : <u>context</u> : <u>function</u>
           <b>Button1</b> = <u>modlist</u> : <u>context</u> : <u>function</u>

       The  <u>modlist</u> is any combination of the modifier names <b>shift</b>, <b>control</b>, <b>lock</b>, <b>meta</b>, <b>mod1</b>, <b>mod2</b>, <b>mod3</b>, <b>mod4</b>,
       or <b>mod5</b> (which may be abbreviated as <b>s</b>, <b>c</b>, <b>l</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>m1</b>,  <b>m2</b>,  <b>m3</b>,  <b>m4</b>,  <b>m5</b>,  respectively)  separated  by  a
       vertical  bar  (|).   Similarly,  the  <u>context</u>  is  any  combination of <b>window</b>, <b>title</b>, <b>icon</b>, <b>root</b>, <b>frame</b>,
       <b>virtual</b>,  <b>desktop</b>,  <b>door</b>,  <b>iconmgr</b>,  their  first  letters  (<b>iconmgr</b>  abbreviation  is  <b>m</b>,  <b>door</b>  has  no
       abbreviation),  or  <b>all</b>,  separated  by  a vertical bar.  It is rumored that window class names will also
       work.  The <u>function</u> is any of the <b>f.</b> keywords described below.  For example,  the  default  startup  file
       contains the following bindings:
           Button1 =   : root          : f.menu "VTWM Windows"
           Button1 = m : window | icon : f.function "move-or-lower"
           Button2 = m : window | icon : f.iconify
           Button3 = m : window | icon : f.move
           Button1 =   : title         : f.move
           Button2 =   : title         : f.raiselower
           Button1 =   : icon          : f.function "move-or-iconify"
           Button2 =   : icon          : f.iconify
           Button1 =   : iconmgr       : f.iconify
           Button2 =   : iconmgr       : f.iconify

       A user who wanted to be able to manipulate windows from the keyboard could use the following bindings:
           "F1"    =       : all : f.iconify
           "F2"    =       : all : f.raiselower
           "F3"    =       : all : f.warpring "next"
           "F4"    =       : all : f.warpto "xmh"
           "F5"    =       : all : f.warpto "emacs"
           "F6"    =       : all : f.colormap "next"
           "F7"    =       : all : f.colormap "default"
           "F20"   =       : all : f.warptoscreen "next"
           "Left"  = m     : all : f.backiconmgr
           "Right" = m | s : all : f.forwiconmgr
           "Up"    = m     : all : f.upiconmgr
           "Down"  = m | s : all : f.downiconmgr

       Note,  however,  that using <u>all</u> for button or key bindings is almost always a bad idea, since it prevents
       all applications from receiving those events; this can cripple text and graphics editors  that  otherwise
       expect  to  see  those  buttons  or  keys  (see also the <b>IgnoreModifiers</b> variable, and the <b>f.bindbuttons</b>,
       <b>f.bindkeys</b>, <b>f.unbindbuttons</b>, and <b>f.unbindkeys</b> functions).

       <b>vtwm</b> provides many more window manipulation primitives than can be conveniently  stored  in  a  titlebar,
       menu,  or  set of key bindings.  Although a small set of defaults are supplied (unless either <b>NoDefaults</b>,
       <b>NoDefaultMouseOrKeyboardBindings</b>, or <b>NoDefaultTitleButtons</b> is specified), most users will  want  to  have
       their  most  common  operations  bound to key and button strokes.  To do this, <b>vtwm</b> associates names with
       each of the primitives and provides <u>user-defined</u> <u>functions</u> for building higher level primitives and <u>menus</u>
       for interactively selecting among groups of functions.

       User-defined functions contain the name by which they are referenced in calls to <b>f.function</b> and a list of
       other functions to execute.  For example:
           Function "move-or-lower"    { f.move f.deltastop f.lower }
           Function "move-or-iconify"  { f.move f.deltastop f.iconify }
           Function "restore-colormap" { f.colormap "default" f.lower }

       The function name must be used in <b>f.function</b> exactly as it appears in the function specification.

       <b>VTWM</b> <b>PROFILE</b>.  If a function called "VTWM Profile" is defined within the startup file, that function will
       be executed upon startup or restarting of the window manager.  For example:
           AutoPan    25
           Function   "VTWM Profile"
           {
               f.autopan
           }
       gives <b>AutoPan</b> a value but turns autopanning off initially (it won't have a value unless <b>AutoPan</b> is set in
       the startup file; see <b>f.autopan</b> below), in case you want to turn it on sometime later.

       In the descriptions below, if the function is said to operate on the selected window, but is invoked from
       a root menu, the cursor will be changed to the <b>Select</b> cursor and the next  window  to  receive  a  button
       press will be chosen:

       <b>!</b> <u>string</u>
               This is an abbreviation for <b>f.exec</b> <u>string</u>.

       <b>^</b> <u>string</u> (OBSOLETE --- use a clipboard client)
               This is an abbreviation for <b>f.cut</b> <u>string</u>.

       <b>f.autopan</b>
               If  autopan  wasn't  configured  in  your  .vtwmrc  file,  this does nothing. If, however, it was
               configured, this toggles the current autopan state. The reason for this command is  that  autopan
               is  sometimes nice to have, but it interferes with using sticky windows that are near the edge of
               the screen. With this command, you get the best of both worlds.

       <b>f.autoraise</b>
               This function toggles whether or not the selected  window  is  raised  whenever  entered  by  the
               pointer.  See the description of the variable <b>AutoRaise</b>.

       <b>f.backiconmgr</b>
               This function warps the pointer to the previous column in the current icon manager, wrapping back
               to the previous row if necessary.

       <b>f.beep</b>  This function sounds the keyboard bell.

       <b>f.bindbuttons</b>

       <b>f.bindkeys</b>
               These  functions  enable  <b>vtwm</b>'s pointer or keyboard bindings for the selected window.  These are
               only needed if  the  bindings  have  been  disabled  with  the  <b>f.unbindbuttons</b>  or  <b>f.unbindkeys</b>
               functions.  Be careful what you bind these functions to; <b>f.bindkeys</b> bound to a window context key
               will not be accessable after <b>f.unbindkeys</b> is invoked for the window!

       <b>f.bottomzoom</b>
               This  function  is  similar  to  the <b>f.fullzoom</b> function, but resizes the window to fill only the
               bottom half of the screen.

       <b>f.circledown</b>
               This function lowers the top-most window that occludes another window.

       <b>f.circleup</b>
               This function raises the bottom-most window that is occluded by another window.

       <b>f.colormap</b> <u>string</u>
               This function rotates the colormaps  (obtained  from  the  WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS  property  on  the
               window)  that <b>vtwm</b> will display when the pointer is in this window.  The argument <u>string</u> may have
               one of the following values: <u>"next"</u>, <u>"prev"</u>, and <u>"default"</u>.  It should  be  noted  here  that  in
               general, the installed colormap is determined by keyboard focus.  A pointer driven keyboard focus
               will install a private colormap upon entry of the window owning the colormap.  Using the click to
               type  model,  private  colormaps will not be installed until the user presses a pointer button on
               the target window.

       <b>f.cut</b> <u>string</u> (OBSOLETE --- use a clipboard client)
               This function places the specified <u>string</u> (followed by a newline character) into the root  window
               property CUT_BUFFER0.

       <b>f.cutfile</b> (OBSOLETE --- use a clipboard client)
               This  function  reads  the  file indicated by the contents of the CUT_BUFFER0 window property and
               replaces the cut buffer.

       <b>f.deiconify</b>
               This function deiconifies the selected window.  If the window is not an icon, this function  does
               nothing.

       <b>f.delete</b>
               This function sends the WM_DELETE_WINDOW message to the selected window if the client application
               has  requested  it  through  the  WM_PROTOCOLS  window  property.  The application is supposed to
               respond to the message by removing the window.  If the window has not requested  WM_DELETE_WINDOW
               messages,  the  keyboard  bell will be rung indicating that the user should choose an alternative
               method.  Note this is very different from <b>f.destroy</b>.  The intent  here  is  to  delete  a  single
               window,  not necessarily the entire application.

       <b>f.deletedoor</b>
               This function deletes a door.

       <b>f.deltastop</b>
               This  function  allows  a  user-defined function to be aborted if the pointer has been moved more
               than MoveDelta pixels.  See the example definition given  for  <b>Function</b>  <b>"move-or-lower"</b>  at  the
               beginning of the section.

       <b>f.destroy</b>
               This  function  instructs the X server to close the display connection of the client that created
               the selected window.  This should only be used  as  a  last  resort  for  shutting  down  runaway
               clients.  See also <b>f.delete</b>.

               This action sometimes leaves a runaway process that consumes CPU cycles; you should always try to
               use the applications own quit function, rather than this one.

       <b>f.downiconmgr</b>
               This  function  warps  the  pointer  to  the next row in the current icon manger, wrapping to the
               beginning of the next column if necessary.

       <b>f.enterdoor</b>
               This function activates this door.  Typically one binds:
                   Button1 = : door : f.enterdoor
                   Button2 = : door : f.enterdoor
                   Button3 = : door : f.enterdoor

       <b>f.exec</b> <u>string</u>
               This function passes the argument <u>string</u> to <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>  for  execution.   In  multiscreen  mode,  if
               <u>string</u>  starts  a  new  X client without giving a display argument, the client will appear on the
               screen from which this function was invoked.

       <b>f.file</b> <u>string</u> (OBSOLETE --- use a clipboard client)
               This function assumes <u>string</u> is a file name.  This file is read  into  the  window  server's  cut
               buffer.

       <b>f.focus</b> This function toggles the keyboard focus of the server to the selected window, changing the focus
               rule from pointer-driven if necessary.  If the selected window already was focused, this function
               executes an <b>f.unfocus</b>.

       <b>f.forcemove</b>
               This function is like <b>f.move</b> except that it ignores the <b>DontMoveOff</b> variable.

       <b>f.forwiconmgr</b>
               This  function  warps the pointer to the next column in the current icon manager, wrapping to the
               beginning of the next row if necessary.

       <b>f.fullzoom</b>
               This function resizes the selected window to the full size of the display or  else  restores  the
               original size if the window was already zoomed.

       <b>f.function</b> <u>string</u>
               This function executes the user-defined function whose name is specified by the argument <u>string</u>.

       <b>f.hbzoom</b>
               This function is a synonym for <b>f.bottomzoom</b>.

       <b>f.hidedesktopdisplay</b>
               This function unmaps the desktop display.

       <b>f.hideiconmgr</b>
               This  function unmaps the current icon manager when selected from a client window, and unmaps all
               icon managers when selected from the root window.

       <b>f.horizoom</b>
               This variable is similar to the <b>f.zoom</b> function except that the selected window is resized to the
               full width of the display.

       <b>f.htzoom</b>
               This function is a synonym for <b>f.topzoom</b>.

       <b>f.hzoom</b> This function is a synonym for <b>f.horizoom</b>.

       <b>f.iconify</b>
               This function iconifies or deiconifies the selected window or icon, respectively.

       <b>f.identify</b>
               This function displays a summary of the name and geometry of the selected window.   Clicking  the
               pointer or pressing a key in the window will dismiss it.  If the function is invoked on a desktop
               representation of a window, the real window which is represented will be identified.

       <b>f.lefticonmgr</b>
               This function similar to <b>f.backiconmgr</b> except that wrapping does not change rows.

       <b>f.leftzoom</b>
               This  variable  is  similar  to  the <b>f.bottomzoom</b> function but causes the selected window is only
               resized to the left half of the display.

       <b>f.lower</b> This function lowers the selected window.

       <b>f.menu</b> <u>string</u>
               This function invokes the menu specified by the argument <u>string</u>.  Cascaded menus may be built  by
               nesting calls to <b>f.menu</b>.

       <b>f.move</b>  This  function  drags  an  outline of the selected window (or the window itself if the <b>OpaqueMove</b>
               variable is set) until the invoking pointer button is released,  at  which  time  the  window  is
               raised (subject to <b>RaiseOnStart</b>, <b>MoveDelta</b>, and <b>NoRaiseOnMove</b>). Double clicking within the number
               of  milliseconds  given  by <b>ConstrainedMoveTime</b> warps the pointer to the center of the window and
               constrains the move horizontally or vertically, depending on pointer movement. To abort the move,
               press another button before releasing the invoking button.

       <b>f.movescreen</b>
               Moves a window (or possibly the real screen) inside the desktop display. To abort the move, press
               another button before releasing the invoking button.  By default, the bindings using the  <b>desktop</b>
               context are defined as:
                   Button1 = : desktop : f.movescreen
                   Button2 = : desktop : f.movescreen

               This   is   useful  if  you  want  to  reset  the  default  keyboard  and  pointer  bindings  via
               <b>NoDefaultMouseOrKeyboardBindings</b> and use some of your own for the virtual desktop, e.g.:
                   NoDefaultMouseOrKeyboardBindings
                   Button1 = : desktop : f.movescreen
                   Button2 = : desktop : f.warp
                   Button3 = : desktop : f.iconify

               This function is not useful under any context other than "desktop".

       <b>f.nail</b>  This function nails or unnails the selected window onto the real screen;  the  current  value  of
               this property is toggled on the window.

       <b>f.nailedabove</b>
               This function toggles the setting of the <b>NailedAbove</b> variable.

       <b>f.namedoor</b>
               This  function,  bound to the door context, pastes a name from CUT_BUFFER0 into the selected door
               (see the <b>BINDINGS</b> section for details).

       <b>f.newdoor</b>
               This function creates a new door with it's destination and name set to the real screen's  current
               position in the virtual desktop.

       <b>f.nexticonmgr</b>
               This function warps the pointer to the next icon manager containing any windows on the current or
               any succeeding screen.

       <b>f.nop</b>   This  function  does  nothing  and  is  typically used with the <b>DefaultFunction</b> or <b>WindowFunction</b>
               variables or to introduce blank lines in menus.

       <b>f.panup</b> <u>N</u>

       <b>f.pandown</b> <u>N</u>

       <b>f.panleft</b> <u>N</u>

       <b>f.panright</b> <u>N</u>
               These functions move the real screen by <u>N%</u> of the screen dimension in  the  indicated  direction.
               These are ideally bound to the cursor keys:
                   "Up"    = : root : f.panup    "100"
                   "Down"  = : root : f.pandown  "100"
                   "Left"  = : root : f.panleft  "100"
                   "Right" = : root : f.panright "100"

       <b>f.playsound</b> <u>soundfile</u>
               This  function  plays  the  specified sound at <b>SoundVolume</b> volume. The <u>soundfile</u> must be the full
               pathname of the sound file. This is a rather "expensive" function compared to  that  provided  by
               the <b>Sounds</b> variable, and should be avoided.

       <b>f.previconmgr</b>
               This  function  warps  the  pointer  to  the  previous icon manager containing any windows on the
               current or preceding screens.

       <b>f.quit</b>  This function causes <b>vtwm</b> to restore the window's borders and exit.  If <b>vtwm</b> is the  last  client
               invoked from <u>xdm</u>, this will result in a server reset, and the user's session will be logged out.

               Users who stay logged in for long periods (days or weeks), or who like to change window managers,
               or  experiment  with  them, may find it desirable to use a relatively simple application, such as
               <b><a href="../man1/xbiff.1.html">xbiff</a></b>(1), as the last application in their <u>.xinitrc</u> or <u>.xsession</u> file, letting the window manager
               start earlier, and run in the background.  This allows changing window managers  without  logging
               out,  and also makes it much less likely that a session will be abruptly terminated by a bug in a
               complex program like a window manager.  The one drawback to this approach is that <b>f.quit</b> then  no
               longer  terminates the session: you need to use <b>f.delete</b> or <b>f.destroy</b> on that last application to
               logout.

       <b>f.raise</b> This function raises the selected window.

       <b>f.raiselower</b>
               This function raises the selected window to the top of the stacking order if it  is  occluded  by
               any windows, otherwise the window will be lowered.

       <b>f.refresh</b>
               This function causes all windows to be refreshed.

       <b>f.resetdesktop</b>
               This function moves the real display to (0,0)

       <b>f.resize</b>
               This  function  drags an outline of the selected window (or the window itself if the <b>OpaqueResize</b>
               variable is set) after crossing a border (or by setting <b>AutoRelativeResize</b>)  until  the  invoking
               pointer  button  is  released,  at  which  time  the  window  is raised (subject to <b>RaiseOnStart</b>,
               <b>MoveDelta</b>, and <b>NoRaiseOnResize</b>). To abort the resize, press another button before  releasing  the
               invoking button.

       <b>f.restart</b>
               This function kills and restarts <b>vtwm</b>. See also <b>f.startwm</b>.

       <b>f.righticonmgr</b>
               This function is similar to <b>f.nexticonmgr</b> except that wrapping does not change rows.

       <b>f.rightzoom</b>
               This  variable  is  similar  to the <b>f.bottomzoom</b> function except that the selected window is only
               resized to the right half of the display.

       <b>f.ring</b>  Selects a window and adds it to the <b>WindowRing</b> list, or removes it if it was already in the ring.
               This command makes <b>f.warpring</b> much more useful, by making its configuration dynamic.

       <b>f.saveyourself</b>
               This function sends a WM_SAVEYOURSELF message to the selected window  if  it  has  requested  the
               message  in  its  WM_PROTOCOLS window property.  Clients that accept this message are supposed to
               checkpoint all state associated with the window and update the WM_COMMAND property  as  specified
               in the ICCCM.  If the window has not requested this message, the keyboard bell will be rung.

       <b>f.separator</b>
               Valid only in menus. The effect is to add a line separator between the previous and the following
               entry. The name selector part in the menu is not used (but must be present).

       <b>f.setrealscreen</b> <u>geomstr</u>
               This function sets the real screen to the virtual coordinates specified.  The <u>geomstr</u> is a quoted
               string containing a standard geometry specification.

       <b>f.showdesktopdisplay</b>
               This function maps the desktop display.

       <b>f.showiconmgr</b>
               This function maps the current icon manager when selected from a client window, and maps all icon
               managers when selected from the root window.

       <b>f.snap</b>  This  function  snaps  the  real  screen to a grid defined on virtual space with <b>PanDistanceX</b> and
               <b>PanDistanceY</b> increments.

       <b>f.snaprealscreen</b>
               This function toggles the setting of <b>SnapRealScreen</b>.

       <b>f.snugdesktop</b>
               moves the display to try to fit all partially visible windows completely on the screen.

       <b>f.snugwindow</b>
               moves the display to try to fit the selected window completely on the screen

       <b>f.sorticonmgr</b>
               This function sorts the entries in the current icon manager  alphabetically.   See  the  variable
               <b>SortIconManager</b>.

       <b>f.sounds</b>
               This function toggles the playing of sounds. It's a "mute" function.

       <b>f.squeezecenter</b>

       <b>f.squeezeleft</b>

       <b>f.squeezeright</b>
               Selects a window and makes its title appear as though you had configured it as
                   <b>SqueezeTitle</b>    center    0    0
               or
                   <b>SqueezeTitle</b>    left      0    0
               or
                   <b>SqueezeTitle</b>    right     0    0
               respectively. These make squeezed titles much more useful because their configuration is dynamic.

       <b>f.startwm</b> <u>commandline</u>
               This  function  kills  <b>vtwm</b>,  and  starts  up  the  window manager as specified by <u>commandline</u>. A
               trailing ampersand and/or environment variables should not be used. See also <b>f.restart</b>.

       <b>f.staticiconpositions</b>
               This function toggles the setting of <b>StaticIconPositions</b>.

       <b>f.stick</b> This function is a synonym for <b>f.nail</b>.

       <b>f.stickyabove</b>
               This function is synonymous with the <b>f.nailedabove</b> function.

       <b>f.stricticonmgr</b>
               This function toggles the setting of <b>StrictIconManager</b>.

       <b>f.title</b> This function provides a centered, unselectable item in a menu definition.  It should not be used
               in any other context.

       <b>f.topzoom</b>
               This variable is similar to the <b>f.bottomzoom</b> function except that the  selected  window  is  only
               resized to the top half of the display.

       <b>f.twmrc</b> Synonymous  with  <b>f.restart</b>.   Historically,  this  function  was  intended  to cause the startup
               customization file to be re-read.

       <b>f.unbindbuttons</b>

       <b>f.unbindkeys</b>
               These functions disable <b>vtwm</b>'s pointer or keyboard bindings for  the  selected  window,  allowing
               events  to pass directly to the application.  These are useful, for example, when running another
               window manager within <b>Xnest</b> or <b>Xvnc</b>.

       <b>f.unfocus</b>
               This function resets the focus back to pointer-driven.  This should be used when a focused window
               is no longer desired.

       <b>f.upiconmgr</b>
               This function warps the pointer to the previous row in the current icon manager, wrapping to  the
               last row in the same column if necessary.

       <b>f.version</b>
               This  function  causes  the  <b>vtwm</b>  version window to be displayed.  This window will be displayed
               until a pointer button is pressed or the pointer is moved from one window to another.

       <b>f.virtualgeometries</b>
               This function toggles the setting of <b>NotVirtualGeometries</b>.

       <b>f.vlzoom</b>
               This function is a synonym for <b>f.leftzoom</b>.

       <b>f.vrzoom</b>
               This function is a synonym for <b>f.rightzoom</b>.

       <b>f.warp</b>  Warp the cursor to the selected window.  This is only useful if the window is  selected  via  the
               icon manager.

       <b>f.warpclassnext</b> <u>string</u>

       <b>f.warpclassprev</b> <u>string</u>
               These  functions warp the pointer to the next or previous window in the specified class indicated
               by the argument <u>string</u>.  If <u>string</u> is <u>"VTWM"</u>, only icon managers, doors, and the Virtual  Desktop
               window  are  considered.  If <u>string</u> empty (i.e., <u>""</u>), the class of the window with focus is used.
               If the window is iconified, it will be deiconified if the variable <b>WarpUnmapped</b> is  set  or  else
               ignored.

       <b>f.warpring</b> <u>string</u>
               This  function  warps  the  pointer  to the next or previous window (as indicated by the argument
               <u>string</u>, which may be <u>"next"</u> or <u>"prev"</u>) specified in the <b>WindowRing</b> variable.  If  the  window  is
               iconified, it will be deiconified if the variable <b>WarpUnmapped</b> is set or else ignored.

       <b>f.warpsnug</b>
               This function toggles the setting of <b>WarpSnug</b>.

       <b>f.warpto</b> <u>string</u>
               This  function warps the pointer to the window which has a name or class that matches <u>string</u>. The
               <u>string</u> may be a VTWM-style wildcard, but not a <u>regular</u> <u>expression</u> (see the <b>WILDCARDS</b> section  for
               details).   If  the  window  is iconified, it will be deiconified if the <b>WarpUnmapped</b> variable is
               set, or else ignored.

       <b>f.warptoiconmgr</b> <u>string</u>
               This function warps the pointer to the icon manager entry associated with the  window  containing
               the pointer in the icon manager specified by the argument <u>string</u>.  If <u>string</u> is empty (i.e., <u>""</u>),
               the  current  icon  manager is chosen.  If the window is iconified, it will be deiconified if the
               variable <b>WarpUnmapped</b> is set or else ignored.

       <b>f.warptonewest</b>
               This function warps the pointer to the most recently created window.  If the window is iconified,
               it will be deiconified if the variable <b>WarpUnmapped</b> is set or else ignored.

       <b>f.warptoscreen</b> <u>string</u>
               This function warps the pointer to the screen specified by the argument <u>string</u>.  <u>String</u> may be  a
               number  (e.g.,  <u>"0"</u> or <u>"1"</u>), the word <u>"next"</u> (indicating the current screen plus 1, skipping over
               any unmanaged screens), the word <u>"back"</u> (indicating the current screen minus 1, skipping over any
               unmanaged screens), or the word <u>"prev"</u> (indicating the last screen visited.

       <b>f.warpvisible</b>
               This function toggles the setting of <b>WarpVisible</b>.

       <b>f.winrefresh</b>
               This function is similar to the <b>f.refresh</b> function  except  that  only  the  selected  window  is
               refreshed.

       <b>f.zoom</b>  This  function  is  similar  to  the  <b>f.fullzoom</b> function, except that the only the height of the
               selected window is changed.

       <b>f.zoomzoom</b>
               This function makes a zoom outline from a random place to another random place (see the <b>Zoom</b>  and
               <b>ZoomZoom</b>  variables).  It's silly, but can be used as a visual bell in place of <b>f.beep</b>.  See also
               the <b>LessRandomZoomZoom</b> variable.

</pre><h4><b>MENUS</b></h4><pre>
       Functions may be grouped and interactively selected using pop-up (when bound  to  a  pointer  button)  or
       pull-down  (when  associated with a titlebar button) menus.  Each menu specification contains the name of
       the menu as it will be referred to by <b>f.menu</b>, optional default foreground and background colors, the list
       of item names and the functions they should invoke, and optional foreground  and  background  colors  for
       individual items:
           <b>Menu</b>    "<u>menuname</u>"    [ ("<u>deffore</u>":"<u>defback</u>") ]
           {
               <u>string1</u>    [ ("<u>fore1</u>":"<u>back1</u>")]    <u>function1</u>
               <u>string2</u>    [ ("<u>fore2</u>":"<u>back2</u>")]    <u>function2</u>
                 ...
               <u>stringN</u>    [ ("<u>foreN</u>":"<u>backN</u>")]    <u>functionN</u>
           }

       The  <u>menuname</u>  is  case-sensitive.  The optional <u>deffore</u> and <u>defback</u> arguments specify the foreground and
       background colors used on a color display to highlight menu entries.  The <u>string</u>  portion  of  each  menu
       entry  will  be the text which will appear in the menu.  The optional <u>fore</u> and <u>back</u> arguments specify the
       foreground and background colors of the menu entry when the pointer is not in the  entry.   These  colors
       will  only  be used on a color display.  The default is to use the colors specified by the <b>MenuForeground</b>
       and <b>MenuBackground</b> variables.  The <u>function</u> portion of the menu entry is one of the functions,  including
       any user-defined functions, or additional menus.

       There  is  a  special  menu  named  <b>VTWM</b>  <b>Windows</b> which contains the names of all of the client and <b>vtwm</b>-
       supplied windows.  Selecting an entry will cause the <b>WindowFunction</b> to be executed on  that  window.   If
       <b>WindowFunction</b>  hasn't  been  set,  the  window  will be deiconified and raised.  This menu uses the same
       colors as the little windows in the panner.  This feature still honors the  traditional  <b>TwmWindows</b>  menu
       name of yore.

</pre><h4><b>ICONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vtwm</b>  supports several different ways of manipulating iconified windows.  The common image-and-text style
       may be laid out by hand or automatically arranged as described by the <b>IconRegion</b> variable.  In  addition,
       a terse grid of icon names, called an icon manager, provides a more efficient use of screen space as well
       as the ability to navigate among windows from the keyboard.

       An  icon manager is a window that contains names of selected or all windows currently on the display.  In
       addition to the window name, a small button using the default iconify symbol will  be  displayed  to  the
       left  of  the  name  when  the window is iconified.  By default, clicking on an entry in the icon manager
       performs <b>f.iconify</b>.  To change the actions taken in the  icon  manager,  use  the  <b>iconmgr</b>  context  when
       specifying button and keyboard bindings.

       Moving  the  pointer  into  the  icon  manager  also  directs keyboard focus to the indicated window when
       <b>NoIconManagerFocus</b> is not set  (setting  the  focus  explicitly  or  else  sending  synthetic  events  if
       <b>NoTitleFocus</b>  is set).  Using the <b>f.upiconmgr</b>, <b>f.downiconmgr</b> <b>f.lefticonmgr</b>, and <b>f.righticonmgr</b> functions,
       the input focus can be changed between windows directly from the keyboard.

</pre><h4><b>IMAGE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>AUDIO</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vtwm</b> supports many images on its own (referred to as "internal" or "built-in" in this document),  divided
       into  two types, <u>bitmaps</u> and <u>pixmaps</u>. They are differentiated from file images by either a colon (':') or
       the string ":xpm:" as the first character(s) of the name, respectively:
           <b>:darrow</b>             scaled in any, n/a for highlight
           <b>:delete</b> / <b>:xlogo</b>    centered in any drawable
           <b>:dot</b> / <b>:iconify</b>     centered in any drawable
           <b>:menu</b>               scaled in any drawable
           <b>:rarrow</b>             scaled in any, n/a for highlight
           <b>:resize</b>             scaled in any drawable

           <b>:xpm:bar</b>            scaled in any drawable
           <b>:xpm:box</b>            scaled in any drawable
           <b>:xpm:darrow</b>         scaled in any, n/a for highlight
           <b>:xpm:dot</b>            centered in any drawable
           <b>:xpm:lines</b>          scaled in any drawable
           <b>:xpm:menu</b>           scaled in any drawable
           <b>:xpm:raisedbox</b>      scaled, for highlight only
           <b>:xpm:raisedlines</b>    scaled, for highlight only
           <b>:xpm:rarrow</b>         scaled in any, n/a for highlight
           <b>:xpm:resize</b>         scaled in any drawable
           <b>:xpm:sunkenbox</b>      scaled, for highlight only
           <b>:xpm:sunkenlines</b>    scaled, for highlight only
           <b>:xpm:zoom</b>           scaled in any drawable

       <b>vtwm</b> also supports a single image file format by default, the X Window  System  bitmap  (files  typically
       carrying  an  extension  of <u>".xbm"</u>), for two-color images. However, when built with the XPM library, <b>vtwm</b>
       will also support the X Window System pixmap (files typically carrying an extension of <u>".xpm"</u>), for full-
       color images.

       All image types and sources can be freely mixed within the variables that use them,  given  the  behavior
       listed  above,  and  with  the following additional exceptions: The <b>Icons</b> and <b>UnknownIcon</b> variables don't
       recognize the built-in images, the <b>RealScreenPixmap</b>, <b>TitleHighlight</b>, and <b>VirtualBackgroundPixmap</b>  entries
       of  the  <b>Pixmaps</b>  variable  don't  recognize  the  built-in  images, only titlebar buttons can accomodate
       external images that would be larger than the default space allocated for them (in any  other  case,  the
       image will be cropped to fit), and only the <b>RealScreenPixmap</b>, <b>TitleHighlight</b>, and <b>VirtualBackgroundPixmap</b>
       entries of the <b>Pixmaps</b> variable will tile small images into the space allocated for them.

       The icon manager drawable is hard-coded to 11x11 pixels, the menu drawable is <b>MenuFont</b> pixels square, and
       titlebar buttons are
           (<b>TitleFont</b> - (2 * <b>ButtonIndent</b>))
       pixels square. The titlebar highlight area is
           (<u>titlebar</u> <u>height</u> - (2 * <b>FramePadding</b>) - 2)
       pixels high, where <u>titlebar</u> <u>height</u> is determined by <b>TitleFont</b> or the titlebar button height, whichever is
       greater, and <b>FramePadding</b>.

       The  root  window  can  be  decorated  with  whatever  image  files that are supported by X Window System
       utilities and applications (<b><a href="../man1/xloadimage.1.html">xloadimage</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/xsetroot.1.html">xsetroot</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/xv.1.html">xv</a></b>(1), etc.).

       If <b>vtwm</b> is built with sound support, several audio file formats are supported, not by <b>vtwm</b> per se, but by
       the <b><a href="../man8/rplayd.8.html">rplayd</a></b>(8) daemon.  Currently, the AU, AIFF, WAV, and VOC formats are natively supported, but see also
       <b><a href="../man5/rplay.helpers.5.html">rplay.helpers</a></b>(5).

</pre><h4><b>WILDCARDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>vtwm</b> supports "wildcarding" when matching windows against a variable's <u>win-list</u>. By default, the question
       mark ('?') represents any single character, the asterisk ('*') represents any zero  or  more  characters,
       and brackets ('[' and ']') represent any characters listed within them. The backslash ('\') "escapes" any
       one character, allowing these reserved characters to be used literally.

       <b>vtwm</b> can support a richer method of character substitution, called <u>regular</u> <u>expressions</u>, or <u>"RE"</u>s. If <b>vtwm</b>
       is built with REs, many more "wildcard" rules are added. A description of REs is beyond the scope of this
       document; see the <b><a href="../man7/re_format.7.html">re_format</a></b>(7) or <b><a href="../man1/egrep.1.html">egrep</a></b>(1) man pages.

       <b>vtwm</b>  distinguishes  REs  from  strings by enclosing them in forward slashes ('/'). The two may be freely
       mixed; changing the example in the <b>VARIABLES</b> section to:
           <b>AutoRaise</b>
           {
               "emacs"
               "VTWM*"
               /x.*clock/    # was "x*clock"
               "Xmh"
               "XTerm"
           }
       accomplishes the same thing. This is but a simple example of RE usage, and as such doesn't demonstrate or
       leverage their capabilities.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       It is possible to issue an <b>f.restart</b> via a Unix signal, to ease debugging of <b>vtwm</b> resource files.  To  do
       this, send a <u>SIGUSR1</u> to the <b>vtwm</b> process ID (written to <u>$HOME/vtwm.pid</u>).  See <b><a href="../man1/kill.1.html">kill</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/slay.1.html">slay</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There  are precious few safeguards against binding functions to objects inappropriately, especially where
       the virtual desktop is concerned.

       Double clicking very fast to get the constrained move function will sometimes cause the window  to  move,
       even though the pointer is not moved.

       It  is  possible  to  ‘lose’ windows in the virtual desktop by placing them in a large desktop area, then
       shrinking the desktop so as to remove them  from  view.   They  are  still  there,  of  course,  but  are
       unreachable until the

       See the <u>BUGS</u> file in the distribution for others.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$HOME/.vtwmrc.</u>screen-number
       <u>$HOME/.vtwmrc</u>
       <u>$VTWMETCMDIR/vtwm/system.vtwmrc</u>
       <u>$HOME/.twmrc.</u>screen-number
       <u>$HOME/.twmrc</u>
       <u>$VTWMETCMDIR/twm/system.vtwmrc</u>
              are  files  <b>vtwm</b>  will search for and use as its configuration file.  They are searched for in the
              order shown, and the first readable file found is used.

       <u>$HOME/vtwm.pid</u>
              contains the ID of the user's <b>vtwm</b> process; see the description of the <b>-p</b> option above.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b>
              This variable is used to determine which X server to use.  It is also set during  <b>f.exec</b>  so  that
              programs come up on the proper screen.

       <b>HOME</b>   This  variable  is  used as the prefix for files that begin with a tilde and for locating the <b>vtwm</b>
              startup file.
