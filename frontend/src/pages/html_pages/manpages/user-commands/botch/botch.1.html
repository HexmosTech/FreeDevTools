</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       botch - bootstrap/build order tool chain

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       botch is a collection of tools to create and analyze dependency graphs. This task is facilitated by a
       range of individual tools which use the deb822 and graphml formats to exchange information with each
       other.

       Also consider browsing the HTML based doc-base Manual at <u>/usr/share/doc/botch/wiki/Home.html</u>

       The tools that botch ships allow one to:
