</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents version 5.45 of the <b>file</b> command.

       <b>file</b> tests each argument in an attempt to classify it.  There are three sets of tests, performed in  this
       order:  filesystem  tests, magic tests, and language tests.  The <u>first</u> test that succeeds causes the file
       type to be printed.

       The type printed will usually contain one of the words <u>text</u> (the file contains only  printing  characters
       and  a  few common control characters and is probably safe to read on an ASCII terminal), <u>executable</u> (the
       file contains the result of compiling a program in a form understandable to some UNIX kernel or another),
       or <u>data</u> meaning anything else (data is usually “binary” or  non-printable).   Exceptions  are  well-known
       file  formats  (core  files,  tar  archives) that are known to contain binary data.  When modifying magic
       files or the program itself, make sure to <u>preserve</u> <u>these</u> <u>keywords</u>.  Users depend on knowing that all  the
       readable  files  in a directory have the word “text” printed.  Don't do as Berkeley did and change “shell
       commands text” to “shell script”.

       The filesystem tests are based on examining the return from a <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2) system call.  The program checks to
       see if the file is empty, or if it's some sort of special file.  Any known file types appropriate to  the
       system  you  are  running  on  (sockets,  symbolic  links,  or  named pipes (FIFOs) on those systems that
       implement them) are intuited if they are defined in the system header file &lt;<u>sys/stat.h</u>&gt;.

       The magic tests are used to check for files with data in particular fixed formats.  The canonical example
       of this is a binary executable (compiled program)  a.out  file,  whose  format  is  defined  in  &lt;<u>elf.h</u>&gt;,
       &lt;<u>a.out.h</u>&gt;  and  possibly  &lt;<u>exec.h</u>&gt;  in the standard include directory.  These files have a “magic number”
       stored in a particular place near the beginning of the file that tells the UNIX operating system that the
       file is a binary executable, and which of several types thereof.  The concept of  a  “magic  number”  has
       been applied by extension to data files.  Any file with some invariant identifier at a small fixed offset
       into the file can usually be described in this way.  The information identifying these files is read from
       <a href="file:/etc/magic">/etc/magic</a>  and  the  compiled  magic  file  <u><a href="file:/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc">/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc</a></u>,  or  the  files  in the directory
       <u><a href="file:/usr/share/misc/magic">/usr/share/misc/magic</a></u> if the  compiled  file  does  not  exist.   In  addition,  if  <u>$HOME/.magic.mgc</u>  or
       <u>$HOME/.magic</u> exists, it will be used in preference to the system magic files.

       If  a file does not match any of the entries in the magic file, it is examined to see if it seems to be a
       text file.  ASCII, ISO-8859-x, non-ISO 8-bit  extended-ASCII  character  sets  (such  as  those  used  on
       Macintosh  and  IBM PC systems), UTF-8-encoded Unicode, UTF-16-encoded Unicode, and EBCDIC character sets
       can be distinguished by the different ranges and sequences of bytes that  constitute  printable  text  in
       each set.  If a file passes any of these tests, its character set is reported.  ASCII, ISO-8859-x, UTF-8,
       and  extended-ASCII  files  are  identified  as “text” because they will be mostly readable on nearly any
       terminal; UTF-16 and EBCDIC are only “character data” because, while they contain text, it is  text  that
       will  require  translation  before  it  can  be  read.  In addition, <b>file</b> will attempt to determine other
       characteristics of text-type files.  If the lines of a file are terminated by CR, CRLF, or  NEL,  instead
       of  the  Unix-standard  LF,  this  will  be  reported.   Files  that contain embedded escape sequences or
       overstriking will also be identified.

       Once <b>file</b> has determined the character set used in a text-type file, it will attempt to determine in what
       language the file is written.  The language tests look for particular strings (cf.  &lt;<u>names.h</u>&gt;)  that  can
       appear  anywhere in the first few blocks of a file.  For example, the keyword <u>.br</u> indicates that the file
       is most likely a <u><a href="../man1/troff.1.html">troff</a></u>(1) input file, just as the keyword <u>struct</u> indicates a C program.  These tests  are
       less  reliable than the previous two groups, so they are performed last.  The language test routines also
       test for some miscellany (such as <u><a href="../man1/tar.1.html">tar</a></u>(1) archives, JSON files).

       Any file that cannot be identified as having been written in any of the character sets  listed  above  is
       simply said to be “data”.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--apple</b>
               Causes the <b>file</b> command to output the file type and creator code as used by older MacOS versions.
               The  code  consists of eight letters, the first describing the file type, the latter the creator.
               This option works properly only for file formats that have the apple-style output defined.

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--brief</b>
               Do not prepend filenames to output lines (brief mode).

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--compile</b>
               Write a <u>magic.mgc</u> output file that contains a pre-parsed version of the magic file or directory.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--checking-printout</b>
               Cause a checking printout of the parsed form  of  the  magic  file.   This  is  usually  used  in
               conjunction with the <b>-m</b> option to debug a new magic file before installing it.

       <b>-d</b>      Prints internal debugging information to stderr.

       <b>-E</b>      On  filesystem  errors  (file  not found etc), instead of handling the error as regular output as
               POSIX mandates and keep going, issue an error message and exit.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--exclude</b> <u>testname</u>
               Exclude the test named in <u>testname</u> from the list of tests made to determine the file type.  Valid
               test names are:

               apptype   EMX application type (only on EMX).

               ascii     Various types  of  text  files  (this  test  will  try  to  guess  the  text  encoding,
                         irrespective of the setting of the ‘encoding’ option).

               encoding  Different text encodings for soft magic tests.

               tokens    Ignored for backwards compatibility.

               cdf       Prints details of Compound Document Files.

               compress  Checks for, and looks inside, compressed files.

               csv       Checks Comma Separated Value files.

               elf       Prints  ELF  file  details,  provided soft magic tests are enabled and the elf magic is
                         found.

               json      Examines JSON (RFC-7159) files by parsing them for compliance.

               soft      Consults magic files.

               simh      Examines SIMH tape files.

               tar       Examines tar files by verifying the checksum of the 512  byte  tar  header.   Excluding
                         this test can provide more detailed content description by using the soft magic method.

               text      A synonym for ‘ascii’.

       <b>--exclude-quiet</b>
               Like  <b>--exclude</b>  but  ignore  tests  that  <b>file</b>  does  not  know  about.   This  is  intended for
               compatibility with older versions of <b>file</b>.

       <b>--extension</b>
               Print a slash-separated list of valid extensions for the file type found.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--separator</b> <u>separator</u>
               Use the specified string as the separator between the filename  and  the  file  result  returned.
               Defaults to ‘:’.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--files-from</b> <u>namefile</u>
               Read the names of the files to be examined from <u>namefile</u> (one per line) before the argument list.
               Either  <u>namefile</u>  or  at least one filename argument must be present; to test the standard input,
               use ‘-’ as a filename argument.   Please  note  that  <u>namefile</u>  is  unwrapped  and  the  enclosed
               filenames are processed when this option is encountered and before any further options processing
               is  done.   This  allows  one  to  process  multiple  lists  of files with different command line
               arguments on the same <b>file</b> invocation.  Thus if you want to set the delimiter, you need to do  it
               before you specify the list of files, like: “<b>-F</b> <u>@</u> <b>-f</b> <u>namefile</u>”, instead of: “<b>-f</b> <u>namefile</u> <b>-F</b> <u>@</u>”.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--no-dereference</b>
               This option causes symlinks not to be followed (on systems that support symbolic links).  This is
               the default if the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is not defined.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--mime</b>
               Causes  the  <b>file</b>  command  to  output  mime  type strings rather than the more traditional human
               readable ones.  Thus it may say ‘text/plain; charset=us-ascii’ rather than “ASCII text”.

       <b>--mime-type</b>, <b>--mime-encoding</b>
               Like <b>-i</b>, but print only the specified element(s).

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--keep-going</b>
               Don't stop at the first match, keep going.  Subsequent matches will be have the string  ‘\012-  ’
               prepended.   (If  you  want  a  newline,  see the <b>-r</b> option.)  The magic pattern with the highest
               strength (see the <b>-l</b> option) comes first.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b>
               Shows a list of patterns and their strength sorted descending by <u><a href="../man5/magic.5.html">magic</a></u>(5) strength which is  used
               for the matching (see also the <b>-k</b> option).

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--dereference</b>
               This  option  causes  symlinks to be followed, as the like-named option in <u><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></u>(1) (on systems that
               support symbolic links).  This is the default if  the  environment  variable  POSIXLY_CORRECT  is
               defined.

       <b>-m</b>, <b>--magic-file</b> <u>magicfiles</u>
               Specify  an alternate list of files and directories containing magic.  This can be a single item,
               or a colon-separated list.  If a compiled magic file is found alongside a file or  directory,  it
               will be used instead.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--no-pad</b>
               Don't pad filenames so that they align in the output.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--no-buffer</b>
               Force  stdout  to be flushed after checking each file.  This is only useful if checking a list of
               files.  It is intended to be used by programs that want filetype output from a pipe.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--preserve-date</b>
               On systems that support <u><a href="../man3/utime.3.html">utime</a></u>(3) or <u><a href="../man2/utimes.2.html">utimes</a></u>(2), attempt to  preserve  the  access  time  of  files
               analyzed, to pretend that <b>file</b> never read them.

       <b>-P</b>, <b>--parameter</b> <u>name=value</u>
               Set various parameter limits.

               <b>Name</b>         <b>Default</b>    <b>Explanation</b>
               <b>bytes</b>        1M         max number of bytes to read from file
               <b>elf_notes</b>    256        max ELF notes processed
               <b>elf_phnum</b>    2K         max ELF program sections processed
               <b>elf_shnum</b>    32K        max ELF sections processed
               <b>elf_shsize</b>   128MB      max ELF section size processed
               <b>encoding</b>     65K        max number of bytes to determine encoding
               <b>indir</b>        50         recursion limit for indirect magic
               <b>name</b>         50         use count limit for name/use magic
               <b>regex</b>        8K         length limit for regex searches

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--raw</b>
               Don't  translate unprintable characters to \ooo.  Normally <b>file</b> translates unprintable characters
               to their octal representation.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--special-files</b>
               Normally, <b>file</b> only attempts to read and determine the  type  of  argument  files  which  <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2)
               reports  are  ordinary  files.   This  prevents  problems, because reading special files may have
               peculiar consequences.  Specifying the <b>-s</b> option causes <b>file</b> to also read  argument  files  which
               are block or character special files.  This is useful for determining the filesystem types of the
               data  in  raw  disk  partitions,  which are block special files.  This option also causes <b>file</b> to
               disregard the file size as reported by <u><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></u>(2) since on some systems it reports a zero  size  for
               raw disk partitions.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--no-sandbox</b>
               On  systems  where libseccomp (<u>https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp</u>) is available, the <b>-S</b> option
               disables sandboxing which is enabled by default.  This option  is  needed  for  <b>file</b>  to  execute
               external  decompressing  programs,  i.e.  when  the  <b>-z</b>  option  is  specified  and  the built-in
               decompressors are not available.  On systems where sandboxing is not available, this  option  has
               no effect.

               <u>Note:</u>  This  Debian  version  of  file  was  built without seccomp support, so this option has no
               effect.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
               Print the version of the program and exit.

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--uncompress</b>
               Try to look inside compressed files.

       <b>-Z</b>, <b>--uncompress-noreport</b>
               Try to look inside compressed files, but report information  about  the  contents  only  not  the
               compression.

       <b>-0</b>, <b>--print0</b>
               Output  a  null  character  ‘\0’ after the end of the filename.  Nice to <u><a href="../man1/cut.1.html">cut</a></u>(1) the output.  This
               does not affect the separator, which is still printed.

               If this option is repeated more than once, then <b>file</b> prints just the filename followed by  a  NUL
               followed by the description (or ERROR: text) followed by a second NUL for each entry.

       <b>--help</b>  Print a help message and exit.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The  environment variable MAGIC can be used to set the default magic file name.  If that variable is set,
       then <b>file</b> will not attempt to open <u>$HOME/.magic</u>.  <b>file</b> adds “<u>.mgc</u>” to  the  value  of  this  variable  as
       appropriate.  The environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT controls (on systems that support symbolic links),
       whether  <b>file</b>  will  attempt  to follow symlinks or not.  If set, then <b>file</b> follows symlink, otherwise it
       does not.  This is also controlled by the <b>-L</b> and <b>-h</b> options.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc">/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc</a></u>  Default compiled list of magic.
       <u><a href="file:/usr/share/misc/magic">/usr/share/misc/magic</a></u>      Directory containing default magic files.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>file</b> will exit with 0 if the operation was successful or &gt;0 if an error was encountered.   The  following
       errors  cause  diagnostic messages, but don't affect the program exit code (as POSIX requires), unless <b>-E</b>
       is specified:
             <b>•</b>   A file cannot be found
             <b>•</b>   There is no permission to read a file
             <b>•</b>   The file type cannot be determined

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b> <b>CONFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       This program is believed to exceed the System V Interface Definition of FILE(CMD), as  near  as  one  can
       determine from the vague language contained therein.  Its behavior is mostly compatible with the System V
       program  of  the same name.  This version knows more magic, however, so it will produce different (albeit
       more accurate) output in many cases.

       The one significant difference between this version and System V is that this version  treats  any  white
       space as a delimiter, so that spaces in pattern strings must be escaped.  For example,

             &gt;10     string  language impress        (imPRESS data)

       in an existing magic file would have to be changed to

             &gt;10     string  language\ impress       (imPRESS data)

       In addition, in this version, if a pattern string contains a backslash, it must be escaped.  For example

             0       string          \begindata      Andrew Toolkit document

       SunOS  releases 3.2 and later from Sun Microsystems include a <b>file</b> command derived from the System V one,
       but with some extensions.  This version differs from Sun's only in minor ways.  It includes the extension
       of the ‘&amp;’ operator, used as, for example,

             &gt;16     long&amp;0x7fffffff &gt;0              not stripped

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b></h4><pre>
       On systems where  libseccomp  (<u>https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp</u>)  is  available,  <b>file</b>  is  enforces
       limiting system calls to only the ones necessary for the operation of the program.  This enforcement does
       not  provide  any security benefit when <b>file</b> is asked to decompress input files running external programs
       with the <b>-z</b> option.  To enable execution of external decompressors, one needs to disable sandboxing using
       the <b>-S</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>MAGIC</b> <b>DIRECTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The magic file entries have been collected from  various  sources,  mainly  USENET,  and  contributed  by
       various  authors.   Christos  Zoulas  (address  below)  will  collect  additional or corrected magic file
       entries.  A consolidation of magic file entries will be distributed periodically.

       The order of entries in the magic file is significant.  Depending on what system you are using, the order
       that they are put together may be incorrect.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       There has been a <b>file</b> command in every UNIX since at least Research Version 4 (man page  dated  November,
       1973).   The  System V version introduced one significant major change: the external list of magic types.
       This slowed the program down slightly but made it a lot more flexible.

       This program, based on the System V version,  was  written  by  Ian  Darwin  ⟨<a href="mailto:ian@darwinsys.com">ian@darwinsys.com</a>⟩  without
       looking at anybody else's source code.

       John  Gilmore revised the code extensively, making it better than the first version.  Geoff Collyer found
       several inadequacies and provided some magic file entries.  Contributions of  the  ‘&amp;’  operator  by  Rob
       McMahon, ⟨<a href="mailto:cudcv@warwick.ac.uk">cudcv@warwick.ac.uk</a>⟩, 1989.

       Guy Harris, ⟨<a href="mailto:guy@netapp.com">guy@netapp.com</a>⟩, made many changes from 1993 to the present.

       Primary development and maintenance from 1990 to the present by Christos Zoulas ⟨<a href="mailto:christos@astron.com">christos@astron.com</a>⟩.

       Altered  by  Chris Lowth ⟨<a href="mailto:chris@lowth.com">chris@lowth.com</a>⟩, 2000: handle the <b>-i</b> option to output mime type strings, using
       an alternative magic file and internal logic.

       Altered by Eric Fischer ⟨<a href="mailto:enf@pobox.com">enf@pobox.com</a>⟩, July, 2000, to identify character codes and attempt to  identify
       the languages of non-ASCII files.

       Altered  by  Reuben  Thomas  ⟨<a href="mailto:rrt@sc3d.org">rrt@sc3d.org</a>⟩,  2007-2011, to improve MIME support, merge MIME and non-MIME
       magic, support directories as well as files of magic, apply many bug fixes,  update  and  fix  a  lot  of
       magic,  improve  the  build  system,  improve  the documentation, and rewrite the Python bindings in pure
       Python.

       The list of contributors to the ‘magic’ directory (magic files) is too long to include  here.   You  know
       who you are; thank you.  Many contributors are listed in the source files.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       Fix output so that tests for MIME and APPLE flags are not needed all over the place, and actual output is
       only  done in one place.  This needs a design.  Suggestion: push possible outputs on to a list, then pick
       the last-pushed (most specific, one hopes) value at the end, or use a default if the list is empty.  This
       should not slow down evaluation.

       The handling of MAGIC_CONTINUE and printing \012- between entries is clumsy and complicated; refactor and
       centralize.

       Some of the encoding logic is hard-coded in encoding.c and can be moved to the magic files if  we  had  a
       !:charset annotation.

       Continue to squash all magic bugs.  See Debian BTS for a good source.

       Store  arbitrarily  long  strings,  for  example for %s patterns, so that they can be printed out.  Fixes
       Debian bug #271672.  This can be done by allocating strings in a string pool, storing the string pool  at
       the  end  of  the  magic  file and converting all the string pointers to relative offsets from the string
       pool.

       Add syntax for relative offsets after current level (Debian bug #466037).

       Make file -ki work, i.e. give multiple MIME types.

       Add a zip library so we can peek inside Office2007 documents to print more details about their contents.

       Add an option to print URLs for the sources of the file descriptions.

       Combine script searches and add a way to map executable names to MIME types (e.g. have a magic value  for
       !:mime  which  causes the resulting string to be looked up in a table).  This would avoid adding the same
       magic repeatedly for each new hash-bang interpreter.

       When a file descriptor is available, we can skip and adjust  the  buffer  instead  of  the  hacky  buffer
       management we do now.

       Fix  “name”  and  “use”  to  check  for  consistency at compile time (duplicate “name”, “use” pointing to
       undefined “name” ).  Make “name” / “use” more efficient by keeping a sorted list of names.   Special-case
       ^ to flip endianness in the parser so that it does not have to be escaped, and document it.

       If  the  offsets  specified  internally in the file exceed the buffer size ( HOWMANY variable in file.h),
       then we don't seek to that offset, but we give up.  It would be better if  buffer  managements  was  done
       when the file descriptor is available so we can seek around the file.  One must be careful though because
       this  has  performance  and  thus security considerations, because one can slow down things by repeatedly
       seeking.

       There is support now for keeping separate buffers and having offsets from the end of the  file,  but  the
       internal buffer management still needs an overhaul.
