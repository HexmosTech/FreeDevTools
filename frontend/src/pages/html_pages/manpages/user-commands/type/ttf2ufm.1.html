       TTF2UFM - A True Type to PostScript Type 1 Font Converter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       "ttf2ufm <u>[-options]</u> <u>ttffont.ttf</u> <u>[Fontname]</u>"

       or

       "ttf2ufm <u>[-options]</u> <u>ttffont.ttf</u> <u>-</u>"

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Ttf2ufm is a font converter from the True Type format (and some other formats supported by the FreeType
       library as well) to the Adobe Type1 format.

       The versions 3.0 and later got rather extensive post-processing algorithm that brings the converted fonts
       to the requirements of the Type1 standard, tries to correct the rounding errors introduced during
       conversions and some simple kinds of bugs that are typical for the public domain TTF fonts. It also
       generates the hints that enable much better rendering of fonts in small sizes that are typical for the
       computer displays. But everything has its price, and some of the optimizations may not work well for
       certain fonts. That's why the options were added to the converter, to control the performed
       optimizations.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The first variant creates the file "Fontname.pfa" (or "Fontname.pfb" if the option '<b>-b</b>' was used) with
       the converted font and "Fontname.afm" with the font metrics, the second one prints the font or another
       file (if the option '<b>-G</b>' was used) on the standard output from where it can be immediately piped through
       some filter. If no "Fontname" is specified for the first variant, the name is generated from "ttffont" by
       replacing the ".ttf" filename suffix.

       Most of the time no options are neccessary (with a possible exception of '<b>-e</b>'). But if there are some
       troubles with the resulting font, they may be used to control the conversion.  The <b>options</b> are:

       • "<b>-a</b>"  -  Include  all  the  glyphs  from the source file into the converted file. If this option is not
         specified then only the glyphs that have been assigned some encoding are included, because the rest  of
         glyphs  would  be inaccessible anyway and would only consume the disk space.  But some applications are
         clever enough to change the encoding on the fly and thus use the other glyphs, in this case they  could
         benefit from using this option. But there is a catch: the X11 library has rather low limit for the font
         size.  Including  more  glyphs  increases  the  file size and thus increases the chance of hitting this
         limit.  See "app/X11/README" for the description of a patch to X11 which fixes this problem.

       • "<b>-b</b>" - Encode the resulting font to produce a ready ".pfb" file.

       • "<b>-d</b> <b>suboptions</b>" - Debugging options. The suboptions are:

         "<b>a</b>" - Print out the absolute coordinates of dots in outlines. Such a  font  can  not  be  used  by  any
         program  (that's why this option is incompatible with '<b>-e</b>') but it has proven to be a valuable debuging
         information.

         "<b>r</b>" - Do not reverse the direction of outlines. The TTF fonts have the standard direction  of  outlines
         opposite  to  the  Type1 fonts. So they should be reversed during proper conversion. This option may be
         used for debugging or to handle a TTF font with wrong direction of outlines (possibly, converted  in  a
         broken  way  from a Type1 font). The first signs of the wrong direction are the letters like "P" or "B"
         without the unpainted "holes" inside.

       • "<b>-e</b>" - Assemble the resulting font to produce a ready ".pfa" file.

         [ S.B.: Personally I don't think that this option is particularly  useful.   The  same  result  may  be
         achieved by piping the unassembled data through t1asm, the Type 1 assembler. And, anyways, it's good to
         have  the  t1utils  package handy. But Mark and many users think that this functionality is good and it
         took not much time to add this option. ]

       • "<b>-F</b>" - Force the Unicode encoding: any type of MS encoding specified in the font  is  ignored  and  the
         font  is  treated  like it has Unicode encoding. <b>WARNING:</b> this option is intended for buggy fonts which
         actually are in Unicode  but  are  marked  as  something  else.  The  effect  on  the  other  fonts  is
         unpredictable.

       • "<b>-G</b>  <b>suboptions</b>" - File generation options. The suboptions may be lowercase or uppercase, the lowercase
         ones disable the generation of particular files, the  corresponding  uppercase  suboptions  enable  the
         generation  of  the  same  kind  of  files.  If the result of ttf2ufm is requested to be printed on the
         standard output, the last enabling suboption of <b>-G</b>  determines  which  file  will  be  written  to  the
         standard  output  and the rest of files will be discarded. For example, <b>-G</b> <b>A</b> will request the AFM file.
         The suboptions to disable/enable the generation of the files are:

         "<b>f/F</b>" - The font file. Depending on the other options this file will have one of the  suffixes  ".t1a",
         ".pfa"  or  ".pfb".  If the conversion result is requested on the standard output ('"-"' is used as the
         output file name) then the font file will also be written there  by  default,  if  not  overwritten  by
         another suboption of <b>-G</b>.  <b>Default:</b> <b>enabled</b>

         "<b>a/A</b>" - The Adobe font metrics file (".afm").  <b>Default:</b> <b>enabled</b>

         "<b>e/E</b>" - The dvips encoding file (".enc").  <b>Default:</b> <b>disabled</b>

       • "<b>-l</b>  <b>language[+argument]</b>"  - Extract the fonts for the specified language from a multi-language Unicode
         font. If this option is not used the converter tries to guess the language by the values of  the  shell
         variable LANG.  If it is not able to guess the language by LANG it tries all the languages in the order
         they are listed.

         After the plus sign an optional argument for the language extractor may be specified. The format of the
         argument  is absolutely up to the particular language converter. The primary purpose of the argument is
         to support selection of planes for the multi-plane Eastern encodings but it can also  be  used  in  any
         other  way.  The  language  extractor  may decide to add the plane name in some form to the name of the
         resulting font. None of the currently supported languages make any use of the argument yet.

         As of now the following languages are supported:

           "latin1" - for all the languages using the Latin-1 encoding

           "latin2" - for the Central European languages

           "latin4" - for the Baltic languages

           "latin5" - for the Turkish language

           "cyrillic" - for the languages with Cyrillic alphabet

           "russian" - historic synonym for cyrillic

           "bulgarian" - historic synonym for cyrillic

           "adobestd" - for the AdobeStandard encoding used by TeX

           "plane+<u>argument</u>" - to select one plane from a multi-byte encoding

         The argument of the ""plane"" language may be in one of three forms:

           "plane+<b>pid=</b><u>&lt;pid&gt;</u><b>,eid=</b><u>&lt;eid&gt;</u>"

           "plane+<b>pid=</b><u>&lt;pid&gt;</u><b>,eid=</b><u>&lt;eid&gt;</u><b>,</b><u>&lt;plane_number&gt;</u>"

           "plane+<u>&lt;plane_number&gt;</u>"

         Pid (TTF platform id) and eid (TTF encoding id) select a particular TTF encoding table in the  original
         font.  They  are  specified as decimal numbers. If this particular encoding table is not present in the
         font file then the conversion fails. The native ("ttf") front-end parser supports only  pid=3  (Windows
         platform),  the FreeType-based ("ft") front-end supports any platform. If pid/eid is not specified then
         the TTF encoding table is determined as usual: Unicode encoding if it's first or an 8-bit  encoding  if
         not  (and  for  an 8-bit encoding the plane number is silently ignored).  To prevent the converter from
         falling back to an 8-bit encoding, specify the Unicode pid/eid value explicitly.

         Plane_number is a hexadecimal (if starts with "<b>0x</b>") or decimal number.  It gives the  values  of  upper
         bytes  for which 256 characters will be selected. If not specified, defaults to 0. It is also used as a
         font name suffix (the leading "0x" is not included into the suffix).

         <b>NOTE:</b> You may notice that the language names  are  not  uniform:  some  are  the  names  of  particular
         languages  and  some  are names of encodings. This is because of the different approaches. The original
         idea was to implement a conversion from Unicode  to  the  appropriate  Windows  encoding  for  a  given
         language.  And  then  use  the translation tables to generate the fonts in whatever final encodings are
         needed. This would allow to pile together the Unicode fonts and the non-Unicode Windows fonts for  that
         language  and  let  the  program  to  sort  them  out automatically. And then generate fonts in all the
         possible encodings for that language. An example of this approach is the Russian language support.  But
         if  there  is no multiplicity of encodings used for some languages and if the non-Unicode fonts are not
         considered important by the users, another way would be simpler to implement:  just  provide  only  one
         table  for extraction of the target encoding from Unicode and don't bother with the translation tables.
         The latin* "languages" are examples of this approach. If somebody feels that he needs the  Type1  fonts
         both  in  Latin-* and Windows encodings he or she is absolutely welcome to submit the code to implement
         it.

         <b>WARNING:</b> Some of the glyphs included into the AdobeStandard encoding are not included into the  Unicode
         standard.  The  most typical examples of such glyphs are ligatures like 'fi', 'fl' etc. Because of this
         the font designers may place them at various places. The converter tries to do its best, if the  glyphs
         have  honest  Adobe  names  and/or  are placed at the same codes as in the Microsoft fonts they will be
         picked up. Otherwise a possible solution is to use the option '<b>-L</b>' with an external map.

       • "<b>-L</b> <b>file[+[pid=&lt;pid&gt;,eid=&lt;eid&gt;,][plane]]</b>" - Extract the fonts for the specified language from a  multi-
         language font using the map from this file. This is rather like the option '<b>-l</b>' but the encoding map is
         not  compiled into the program, it's taken from that file, so it's easy to edit. Examples of such files
         are provided in "maps/adobe-standard-encoding.map", "CP1250.map". (<b>NOTE:</b> the  'standard  encoding'  map
         does  not  include all the glyphs of the AdobeStandard encoding, it's provided only as an example.) The
         description of the supported map formats is in the file "maps/unicode-sample.map".

         Likewise to '<b>-l</b>', an argument may be specified after the map file name. But in this case  the  argument
         has fixed meaning: it selects the original TTF encoding table (the syntax is the same as in '<b>-l</b> <b>plane</b>')
         and/or  a  plane of the map file. The plane name also gets added after dash to the font name. The plane
         is a concept used in the Eastern fonts with big number of  glyphs:  one  TTF  font  gets  divided  into
         multiple  Type1 fonts, each containing one plane of up to 256 glyphs. But with a little creativity this
         concept may be used for other purposes of combining  multiple  translation  maps  into  one  file.   To
         extract  multiple  planes  from  a  TTF  font  "ttf2ufm"  must  be run multiple times, each time with a
         different plane name specified.

         The default original TTF encoding table used for the option '<b>-L</b>' is Unicode. The map files may  include
         directives  to  specify different original TTF encodings. However if the pid/eid pair is specified with
         it overrides any original encoding specified in the map file.

       • "<b>-m</b> <b>type=value</b>" - Set maximal or minimal limits of  resources.   These  limits  control  the  the  font
         generation  by  limiting  the  resources  that  the  font  is  permitted to require from the PostScript
         interpreter.  The currently supported types of limits are:

         "<b>h</b>" - the maximal hint stack depth for the substituted hints.  The default value is 128,  according  to
         the  limitation  in X11. This seems to be the lowest (and thus the safest) widespread value. To display
         the hint stack depth required by each glyph in a ".t1a" file use the script "scripts/cntstems.pl".

       • "<b>-O</b> <b>suboptions</b>" - Outline processing options.  The  suboptions  may  be  lowercase  or  uppercase,  the
         lowercase  ones  disable the features, the corresponding uppercase suboptions enable the same features.
         The suboptions to disable/enable features are:

         "<b>b/B</b>" - Guessing of the ForceBold parameter. This parameter helps the Type1  engine  to  rasterize  the
         bold  fonts  properly  at  small  sizes.  But the algorithm used to guess the proper value of this flag
         makes that guess based solely on the font name. In rare cases that may cause errors, in these cases you
         may want to disable this guessing.  <b>Default:</b> <b>enabled</b>

         "<b>h/H</b>"  -  Autogeneration  of  hints.  The  really  complex  outlines  may  confuse  the  algorithm,  so
         theoretically  it  may  be  useful sometimes to disable them. Although up to now it seems that even bad
         hints are better than no hints at all.  <b>Default:</b> <b>enabled</b>

         "<b>u/U</b>" - Hint substitution. Hint substitution is a technique  permitting  generation  of  more  detailed
         hints  for  the rasterizer. It allows to use different sets of hints for different parts of a glyph and
         change these sets as neccessary during rasterization (that's why "substituted").  So it should  improve
         the  quality  of  the fonts rendered at small sizes.  But there are two catches: First, the X11 library
         has rather low limit for the font size. More detailed hints increase the file size  and  thus  increase
         the  chance  of  hitting this limit (that does not mean that you shall hit it but you may if your fonts
         are particularly big). This is especially probable for Unicode fonts converted with option '<b>-a</b>', so you
         may want to use '<b>-a</b>' together with '<b>-Ou</b>'. See "app/X11/README" for the description of a  patch  to  X11
         which  fixes  this  problem.  Second,  some  rasterizers  (again,  X11  is  the typical example) have a
         limitation for total number of hints used when drawing a glyph (also known as the hint stack depth). If
         that stack overflows the glyph is ignored. Starting from version  3.22  "ttf2ufm"  uses  algorithms  to
         minimizing  this depth, with the trade-off of slightly bigger font files. The glyphs which still exceed
         the limit set by option '<b>-mh</b>' have all the substituted hints removed and only  base  hints  left.   The
         algorithms  seem  to  have been refined far enough to make the fonts with substituted hints look better
         than the fonts without them or at least the same. Still if the original fonts are not well-designed the
         detailed hinting may emphasize the defects of the design, such  as  non-even  thickness  of  lines.  So
         provided  that  you  are  not afraid of the X11 bug the best idea would be to generate a font with this
         feature and without it, then compare the results using the program "other/cmpf" (see the description in
         "other/README") and decide which one looks better.  <b>Default:</b> <b>enabled</b>

         "<b>o/O</b>" - Space optimization of the outlines' code. This kind of optimization never hurts, and  the  only
         reason to disable this feature is for comparison of the generated fonts with the fonts generated by the
         previous versions of converter. Well, it _almost_ never hurts. As it turned out there exist some brain-
         damaged  printers which don't understand it. Actually this feature does not change the outlines at all.
         The Type 1 font manual provides a set of redundant operators that make font description  shorter,  such
         as  '10  hlineto'  instead of '0 10 rlineto' to describe a horizontal line. This feature enables use of
         these operators.  <b>Default:</b> <b>enabled</b>

         "<b>s/S</b>" - Smoothing of outlines. If the font is broken in some way (even the ones  that  are  not  easily
         noticeable),  such  smoothing  may break it further. So disabling this feature is the first thing to be
         tried if some font looks odd. But with smoothing off  the  hint  generation  algorithms  may  not  work
         properly too.  <b>Default:</b> <b>enabled</b>

         "<b>t/T</b>" - Auto-scaling to the 1000x1000 Type1 standard matrix. The TTF fonts are described in terms of an
         arbitrary  matrix up to 4000x4000. The converted fonts must be scaled to conform to the Type1 standard.
         But the scaling introduces additional rounding errors, so it may be curious sometimes to  look  at  the
         font in its original scale.  <b>Default:</b> <b>enabled</b>

         "<b>v/V</b>"  -  Do  vectorization  on  the  bitmap  fonts.  Functionally "vectorization" is the same thing as
         "autotracing", a different word is used purely to differentiate it from the Autotrace library. It tries
         to produce nice smooth outlines from bitmaps. This feature is still  a  work  in  progress  though  the
         results are already mostly decent.  <b>Default:</b> <b>disabled</b>

         "<b>w/W</b>"  -  Glyphs' width corection. This option is designed to be used on broken fonts which specify too
         narrow widths for the letters. You can tell that a font can benefit from this option if  you  see  that
         the  characters  are  smashed  together  without  any  whitespace  between them. This option causes the
         converter to set the character widths to the actual width of this character plus the width of a typical
         vertical stem. But on the other hand the well-designed fonts may have characters that  look  better  if
         their  widths  are  set  slightly  narrower.  Such well-designed fonts will benefit from disabling this
         feature. You may want to convert a font with and without this feature, compare the results  and  select
         the  better  one.  This  feature may be used only on proportional fonts, it has no effect on the fixed-
         width fonts.  <b>Default:</b> <b>disabled</b>

         "<b>z/Z</b>" - Use the Autotrace library on the bitmap fonts. The results are horrible and  <b>the</b>  <b>use</b>  <b>of</b>  <b>this</b>
         <b>option</b>  <b>is</b>  <b>not</b>  <b>recommended</b>.  This  option  is  present for experimental purposes. It may change or be
         removed in the future. The working tracing can be achieved with option "<b>-OV</b>".  <b>Default:</b> <b>disabled</b>

       • "<b>-p</b> <b>parser_name</b>" - Use the specified front-end parser to read the font file.  If  this  option  is  not
         used,  ttf2ufm  selects the parser automatically based on the suffix of the font file name, it uses the
         first parser in its list that supports this font type. Now two parsers are supported:

           "ttf" - built-in parser for the ttf files (suffix ".ttf")

           "bdf" - built-in parser for the BDF files (suffix ".bdf")

           "ft" - parser based on the FreeType-2 library (suffixes ".ttf", ".otf", ".pfa", ".pfb")

         The parser "ft" is <b>NOT</b> linked in by default. See "Makefile" for instructions how to enable it. We do no
         support this parser on Windows: probably it will work but nobody tried and nobody knows  how  to  build
         it.

         The  conversion  of  the bitmap fonts (such as BDF) is simplistic yet, producing jagged outlines.  When
         converting such fonts, it might be a good idea to turn off the hint  substitution  (using  option  <b>-Ou</b>)
         because the hints produced will be huge but not adding much to the quality of the fonts.

       • "<b>-u</b>  <b>number</b>" - Mark the font with this value as its UniqueID. The UniqueID is used by the printers with
         the hard disks to cache the rasterized characters and thus significantly speed-up the printing. Some of
         those printers just can't store the fonts without UniqueID on their disk.The problem is that the ID  is
         supposed  to  be  unique,  as  it name says. And there is no easy way to create a guaranteed unique ID.
         Adobe specifies the range 4000000-4999999 for private IDs but still it's  difficult  to  guarantee  the
         uniqueness  within  it.  So  if you don't really need the UniqueID don't use it, it's optional. Luckily
         there are a few millions of possible IDs, so the chances of collision are rather low.   If  instead  of
         the  number  a  special  value  '"<b>A</b>"'  is  given  then  the  converter  generates the value of UniqueID
         automatically, as a hash of the font name. (<b>NOTE:</b>  in the version 3.22 the algorithm for autogeneration
         of UniqueID was changed to fit the values into the Adobe-spacified range. This means that if  UniqueIDs
         were  used  then  the printer's cache may need to be flushed before replacing the fonts converted by an
         old version with fonts converted by a newer version).  A simple way to find if any of the  fonts  in  a
         given directory have duplicated UniqueIDs is to use the command:

         "  cat *.pf[ab] | grep UniqueID | sort | uniq -c | grep -v ' 1 '"

         Or  if you use "scripts/convert" it will do that for you automatically plus it will also give the exact
         list of files with duplicate UIDs.

       • "<b>-v</b> <b>size</b>" - Re-scale the font to get the size of  a  typical  uppercase  letter  somewhere  around  the
         specified  size. Actually, it re-scales the whole font to get the size of one language-dependent letter
         to be at least of the specified size. Now this letter is "A" in all the supported languages.  The  size
         is  specified  in  the  points  of  the  Type 1 coordinate grids, the maximal value is 1000. This is an
         experimental option and should be used with caution. It tries to increase the visible font size  for  a
         given  point  size and thus make the font more readable. But if overused it may cause the fonts to look
         out of scale. As of now the interesting values of size for  this  option  seem  to  be  located  mostly
         between  600  and  850. This re-scaling may be quite useful but needs more experience to understand the
         balance of its effects.

       • "<b>-W</b> <b>level</b>" - Select the verbosity level of the  warnings.   Currently  the  levels  from  0  to  4  are
         supported. Level 0 means no warnings at all, level 4 means all the possible warnings. The default level
         is  3.  Other levels may be added in the future, so using the level number 99 is recommended to get all
         the possible warnings. Going below level 2 is not generally recommended because you may  miss  valuable
         information about the problems with the fonts being converted.

       • <b>Obsolete</b>  <b>option:</b>  "<b>-A</b>"  -  Print  the font metrics (.afm file) instead of the font on STDOUT.  Use <b>-GA</b>
         instead.

       • <b>Very</b> <b>obsolete</b> <b>option:</b>

         The algorithm that implemented the forced fixed width had major flaws, so it was disabled. The code  is
         still  in the program and some day it will be refined and returned back. Meanwhile the option name '<b>-f</b>'
         was reused for another option. The old version was:

         "<b>-f</b>" - Don't try to force the fixed width of font. Normally the converter considers the fonts in  which
         the  glyph width deviates by not more than 5% as buggy fixed width fonts and forces them to have really
         fixed width. If this is undesirable, it can be disabled by this option.

       The ".pfa" font format supposes that the description of the characters is binary encoded  and  encrypted.
       This converter does not encode or encrypt the data by default, you have to specify the option '<b>-e</b>' or use
       the  "t1asm"  program  to assemble (that means, encode and encrypt) the font program. The "t1asm" program
       that is included with the converter is actually a part of the "t1utils" package, rather  old  version  of
       which may be obtained from

       <a href="http://ttf2ufm.sourceforge.net/t1utils.tar.gz">http://ttf2ufm.sourceforge.net/t1utils.tar.gz</a>

       Note  that  "t1asm"  from the old version of that package won't work properly with the files generated by
       "ttf2ufm" version 3.20 and later. Please use "t1asm" packaged with "ttf2ufm"  or  from  the  new  version
       "t1utils" instead. For a newer version of "t1utils" please look at

       <a href="http://www.lcdf.org/~eddietwo/type/">http://www.lcdf.org/~eddietwo/type/</a>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       So, the following command lines:

       "ttf2ufm -e ttffont.ttf t1font"

       "ttf2ufm ttffont.ttf - | t1asm &gt;t1font.pfa"

       represent  two  ways  to  get a working font. The benefit of the second form is that other filters may be
       applied to the font between the converter and assembler.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       It seems that many Eastern fonts use features of the TTF format that are not supported by  the  ttf2ufm's
       built-in  front-end  parser. Because of this for now we recommend using the FreeType-based parser (option
       '<b>-p</b> <b>ft</b>') with the ""plane"" language.

   <b>Troubleshooting</b> <b>and</b> <b>bug</b> <b>reports</b>
       Have problems with conversion of some font ? The converter dumps  core  ?  Or  your  printer  refuses  to
       understand the converted fonts ? Or some characters are missing ? Or some characters look strange ?

       Send the bug reports to the ttf2ufm development mailing list at <a href="mailto:ttf2ufm-devel@lists.sourceforge.net">ttf2ufm-devel@lists.sourceforge.net</a>.

       Try  to  collect  more information about the problem and include it into the bug report. (Of course, even
       better if you would provide a ready fix, but just a detailed bug report is also good).  Provide  detailed
       information  about  your  problem,  this will speed up the response greatly.  Don't just write "this font
       looks strange after conversion" but describe what's exactly wrong with it: for example,  what  characters
       look  wrong  and what exactly is wrong about their look. Providing a link to the original font file would
       be also a good idea. Try to do a little troublehooting and report its result. This not  only  would  help
       with the fix but may also give you a temporary work-around for the bug.

       First,  enable  full  warnings  with option '<b>-W99</b>', save them to a file and read carefully. Sometimes the
       prolem is with a not implemented feature which is reported in the warnings. Still, reporting  about  such
       problems may be a good idea: some features were missed to cut corners, in hope that no real font is using
       them.  So a report about a font using such a feature may motivate someone to implement it. Of course, you
       may be the most motivated person: after all, you are the one wishing to convert that font. ;-) Seriously,
       the philosophy "scrath your own itch" seems to be the strongest  moving  force  behind  the  Open  Source
       software.

       The  next step is playing with the options. This serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it helps to localize
       the bug, on the other hand you may be able to get a working version of the font for  the  meantime  while
       the  bug is being fixed. The typical options to try out are: first '<b>-Ou</b>', if it does not help then '<b>-Os</b>',
       then '<b>-Oh</b>', then '<b>-Oo</b>'.  They are described in a bit more detail above.  Try  them  one  by  one  and  in
       combinations. See if with them the resulting fonts look better.

       On  some  fonts  ttf2ufm  just  crashes. Commonly that happens because the font being converted is highly
       defective (although sometimes the bug is in ttf2ufm itself). In any case it  should  not  crash,  so  the
       reports about such cases will help to handle these defects properly in future.

       We  try  to  respond  to  the  bug reports in a timely fashion but alas, this may not always be possible,
       especially if the problem is complex.  This is a volunteer project and its resources are limited. Because
       of this we would appreciate bug reports as detailed as possible, and we would appreciate the ready  fixes
       and contributions even more.
