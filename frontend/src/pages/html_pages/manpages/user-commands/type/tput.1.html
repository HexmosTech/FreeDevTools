</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tput</b>  uses  the  <u>terminfo</u>  library  and  database  to make terminal-specific capabilities and information
       available to the shell, to initialize or reset the terminal, or to report a description  of  the  current
       (or specified) terminal type.  Terminal capabilities are accessed by <u>cap-code</u>.

       <b><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></b>(5) discusses terminal capabilities at length and presents a complete list of <u>cap-codes</u>.

       When retrieving capability values, the result depends upon the capability's type.

       Boolean  <b>tput</b> sets its exit status to <b>0</b> if the terminal possesses <u>cap-code</u>, and <b>1</b> if it does not.

       numeric  <b>tput</b>  writes <u>cap-code</u>'s decimal value to the standard output stream if defined (<b>-1</b> if it is not)
                followed by a newline.

       string   <b>tput</b> writes <u>cap-code</u>'s value to the standard  output  stream  if  defined,  without  a  trailing
                newline.

       Before  using a value returned on the standard output, the application should test <b>tput</b> <b>'s</b> exit status to
       be sure it is 0; see section “EXIT STATUS” below.

   <b>Operands</b>
       Generally, an operand is a <u>cap-code</u>, a capability  code  from  the  terminal  database,  or  a  parameter
       thereto.   Three  others  are  specially  recognized  by <b>tput</b>: <b>init</b>, <b>reset</b>, and <b>longname</b>.  Although these
       resemble capability codes, they in fact receive special handling; we term them “pseudo-capabilities”.

       <u>cap-code</u>   indicates a capability from the terminal database.

                  If <u>cap-code</u> is of string type and takes parameters, <b>tput</b> interprets arguments  following  <u>cap-</u>
                  <u>code</u> as the parameters, up to the (fixed) quantity the capability requires.

                  Most parameters are numeric.  Only a few terminal capabilities require string parameters; <b>tput</b>
                  uses  a  table  to  decide  which  to  pass as strings.  Normally <b>tput</b> uses <b><a href="../man3NCURSES/tparm.3NCURSES.html">tparm</a></b>(3NCURSES) to
                  perform the substitution.  If no parameters are given for  the  capability,  <b>tput</b>  writes  the
                  string without performing the substitution.

       <b>init</b>       initializes  the  terminal.   If  the terminal database is present and an entry for the user's
                  terminal type exists, the following occur.

                  (1)  <b>tput</b> retrieves the terminal's mode settings.  It successively tests the file  descriptors
                       corresponding to

                       •   the standard error stream,

                       •   the standard output stream,

                       •   the standard input stream, and

                       •   <u>/dev/tty</u>

                       to  obtain  terminal settings.  Having retrieved them, <b>tput</b> remembers which descriptor to
                       use for further updates.

                  (2)  If the terminal dimensions  cannot  be  obtained  from  the  operating  system,  but  the
                       environment  or  terminal  type database entry describes them, <b>tput</b> updates the operating
                       system's notion of them.

                  (3)  <b>tput</b> updates the terminal modes.

                       •   Any delays specified in the entry (for example, when a newline is sent)  are  set  in
                           the terminal driver.

                       •   Tab expansion is turned on or off per the specification in the entry, and

                       •   if tabs are not expanded, standard tabs (every 8 spaces) are set.

                  (4)  If  initialization  capabilities,  detailed  in  subsection  “Tabs and Initialization” of
                       <b><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></b>(5), are present, <b>tput</b> writes them to the standard output stream.

                  (5)  <b>tput</b> flushes the standard output stream.

                  If an entry lacks the information needed for an activity  above,  that  activity  is  silently
                  skipped.

       <b>reset</b>      re-initializes the terminal.  A reset differs from initialization in two ways.

                  (1)  <b>tput</b> sets the terminal modes to a “sane” state,

                       •   enabling canonical (“cooked”) and echo modes,

                       •   disabling cbreak and raw modes,

                       •   enabling newline translation, and

                       •   setting any special input characters to their default values.

                  (2)  If  any  reset  capabilities  are  defined for the terminal type, <b>tput</b> writes them to the
                       output stream.  Otherwise, <b>tput</b> uses  any  defined  initialization  capabilities.   Reset
                       capabilities are detailed in subsection “Tabs and Initialization” of <b><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></b>(5).

       <b>longname</b>   A <u>terminfo</u> entry begins with one or more names by which an application can refer to the entry,
                  before  the list of terminal capabilities.  The names are separated by “|” characters.  X/Open
                  Curses terms the last name the “long name”, and indicates that it may include blanks.

                  <b>tic</b> warns if the last name does not include blanks, to accommodate old <u>terminfo</u>  entries  that
                  treated  the  long  name  as  an  optional feature.  The long name is often referred to as the
                  description field.

                  If the terminal database is present and an entry for the user's  terminal  type  exists,  <b>tput</b>
                  reports  its  description  to  the  standard  output  stream, without a trailing newline.  See
                  <b><a href="../man5/terminfo.5.html">terminfo</a></b>(5).

       <u>Note:</u> Redirecting the output of “<b>tput</b> <b>init</b>” or “<b>tput</b> <b>reset</b>” to a file will capture  only  part  of  their
       actions.   Changes  to  the  terminal  modes  are  not affected by file descriptor redirection, since the
       terminal modes are altered via <u><a href="../man2/ioctl.2.html">ioctl</a></u>(2).

   <b>Aliases</b>
       If <b>tput</b> is invoked via link with any of the names <b>clear</b>, <b>init</b>, or <b>reset</b>, it operates as if run  with  the
       corresponding (pseudo-)capability operand.  For example, executing a link named <b>reset</b> that points to <b>tput</b>
       has the same effect as “<b>tput</b> <b>reset</b>”.

       This feature was introduced by <u>ncurses</u> 5.2 in 2000.  It is rarely used.

       <b>clear</b>  is a separate program, which is both smaller and more frequently executed.

       <b>init</b>   has the same name as another program in widespread use.

       <b>reset</b>  is provided by the <b><a href="../man1/tset.1.html">tset</a></b>(1) utility (also via a link named <b>reset</b>).

   <b>Terminal</b> <b>Size</b>
       Besides  the  pseudo-capabilities  (such as <b>init</b>), <b>tput</b> treats the <b>lines</b> and <b>cols</b> <u>cap-codes</u> specially: it
       may call <b><a href="../man3NCURSES/setupterm.3NCURSES.html">setupterm</a></b>(3NCURSES) to obtain the terminal size.

       •   First, <b>tput</b> attempts to obtain these capabilities from the terminal database.  This  generally  fails
           for terminal emulators, which lack a fixed window size and thus omit the capabilities.

       •   It  then  asks  the  operating  system  for  the  terminal's  size, which generally works, unless the
           connection is via a serial line that does not support “NAWS”: negotiations about window size.

       •   Finally, it inspects the environment variables <u>LINES</u> and <u>COLUMNS</u>, which  may  override  the  terminal
           size.

       If  the  <b>-T</b>  option is given, <b>tput</b> ignores the environment variables by calling <b>use_tioctl(TRUE)</b>, relying
       upon the operating system (or, ultimately, the terminal database).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-S</b>       retrieves more than one capability per invocation of <b>tput</b>.  The capabilities must be  passed  to
                <b>tput</b>  from  the  standard  input stream instead of from the command line (see section “EXAMPLES”
                below).  Only one <u>cap-code</u> is allowed per line.  The <b>-S</b> option changes the meanings of the <b>0</b> and
                <b>1</b> exit statuses (see section “EXIT STATUS” below).

                Some capabilities use string parameters rather than numeric ones.  <b>tput</b> employs a built-in table
                and the presence of parameters in its input to decide how to interpret them, and whether to  use
                <b><a href="../man3NCURSES/tparm.3NCURSES.html">tparm</a></b>(3NCURSES).

       <b>-T</b> <u>type</u>  indicates  the terminal's <u>type</u>.  Normally this option is unnecessary, because a default is taken
                from the <u>TERM</u> environment variable.  If specified, the environment variables <u>LINES</u>  and  <u>COLUMNS</u>
                are also ignored.

       <b>-v</b>       causes <b>tput</b> to operate verbosely, reporting warnings.

       <b>-V</b>       reports the version of <u>ncurses</u> associated with <b>tput</b>, and exits with a successful status.

       <b>-x</b>       prevents “<b>tput</b> <b>clear</b>” from attempting to clear the scrollback buffer.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       Normally, one should interpret <b>tput</b>'s exit statuses as follows.

       <b>Status</b>   <b>Meaning</b> <b>When</b> <b>-S</b> <b>Not</b> <b>Specified</b>
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>0</b>        Boolean or string capability present
       <b>1</b>        Boolean or numeric capability absent
       <b>2</b>        usage error or no terminal type specified
       <b>3</b>        unrecognized terminal type
       <b>4</b>        unrecognized capability code
       <b>&gt;4</b>       system error (4 + <b>errno</b>)

       When the <b>-S</b> option is used, some statuses change meanings.

       <b>Status</b>   <b>Meaning</b> <b>When</b> <b>-S</b> <b>Specified</b>
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       <b>0</b>        all operands interpreted
       <b>1</b>        unused
       <b>4</b>        some operands not interpreted

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tput</b> reads up to three environment variables if the <b>-T</b> option is not specified.

       <u>COLUMNS</u>  specifies the width of the screen in characters.

       <u>LINES</u>    specifies the height of the screen in characters.

       <u>TERM</u>     denotes the terminal type.  Each terminal type is distinct, though many are similar.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/usr/share/tabset">/usr/share/tabset</a></u>
              tab stop initialization database

       <u><a href="file:/etc/terminfo">/etc/terminfo</a></u>
              compiled terminal description database

</pre><h4><b>PORTABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Over  time  <u>ncurses</u>  <b>tput</b>  has  differed  from that of System V in two important respects, one now mostly
       historical.

       •   “<b>tput</b> <u>cap-code</u>” writes to the standard output, which need not be a  terminal  device.   However,  the
           operands that manipulate terminal modes might not use the standard output.

           System V <u>tput</u>'s <b>init</b> and <b>reset</b> operands use logic from 4.1cBSD <u>tset</u>, manipulating terminal modes.  It
           checks the same file descriptors (and <u>/dev/tty</u>) for association with a terminal device as <u>ncurses</u> now
           does,  and  if  none  are,  finally  assumes  a 1200 baud terminal.  When updating terminal modes, it
           ignores errors.

           Until <u>ncurses</u> 6.1 (see section “HISTORY” below), <b>tput</b> did not modify terminal modes.  It now  employs
           a scheme similar to System V, using functions shared with <b>tset</b> (and ultimately based on 4.4BSD <u>tset</u>).
           If  it  is  not able to open a terminal (for instance, when run by <u><a href="../man1/cron.1.html">cron</a></u>(1)), <b>tput</b> exits with an error
           status.

       •   System V <u>tput</u> assumes that the type of a <u>cap-code</u> operand is numeric if all  the  characters  of  its
           value are decimal numbers; if they are not, it treats <u>cap-code</u> as a string capability.

           Most  implementations  that provide support for <u>cap-code</u> operands use the <b><a href="../man3NCURSES/tparm.3NCURSES.html">tparm</a></b>(3NCURSES) function to
           expand its parameters.  That function expects a mixture of numeric and string  parameters,  requiring
           <b>tput</b> to know which type to use.

           <u>ncurses</u> <b>tput</b> uses a table to determine the parameter types for the standard <u>cap-code</u> operands, and an
           internal function to analyze nonstandard <u>cap-code</u> operands.

           While  more  reliable  than System V's utility, a portability problem is introduced by this analysis.
           An OpenBSD developer adapted the internal library function from <u>ncurses</u>  to  port  NetBSD's  <u>termcap</u>-
           based  <u>tput</u>  to  <u>terminfo</u>,  and  modified  it to interpret multiple <u>cap-codes</u> (and parameters) on the
           command line.  Portable applications should not rely upon this feature; <u>ncurses</u> offers it to  support
           applications written specifically for OpenBSD.

       This  implementation,  unlike  others,  accepts both <u>termcap</u> and <u>terminfo</u> <u>cap-codes</u> if <u>termcap</u> support is
       compiled in.  In that case, however, the predefined <u>termcap</u> and  <u>terminfo</u>  codes  have  two  ambiguities;
       <u>ncurses</u> assumes the <u>terminfo</u> code.

       •   The <u>cap-code</u> <b>dl</b> means <b>delete_line</b> to <u>termcap</u> but <b>parm_delete_line</b> to <u>terminfo</u>.  <u>termcap</u> uses the code
           <b>DL</b> for <b>parm_delete_line</b>.  <u>terminfo</u> uses the code <b>dl1</b> for <b>delete_line</b>.

       •   The  <u>cap-code</u> <b>ed</b> means <b>exit_delete_mode</b> to <u>termcap</u> but <b>clr_eos</b> to <u>terminfo</u>.  <u>termcap</u> uses the code <b>cd</b>
           for <b>clr_eos</b>.  <u>terminfo</u> uses the code <b>rmdc</b> for <b>exit_delete_mode</b>.

       The <b>longname</b> operand, <b>-S</b> option, and the parameter-substitution features used in the <b>cup</b>  example  below,
       were  not  supported  in AT&amp;T/USL <u>curses</u> before SVr4 (1989).  Later, 4.3BSD-Reno (1990) added support for
       <b>longname</b>, and in 1994, NetBSD added support for the parameter-substitution features.

       IEEE Std 1003.1/The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7 (POSIX.1-2008) documents only the <b>clear</b>, <b>init</b>,
       and <b>reset</b> operands.  A few observations of interest arise from that selection.

       •   <u>ncurses</u> supports <b>clear</b> as it does any other standard <u>cap-code</u>.  The others (<b>init</b> and <b>longname</b>) do not
           correspond to terminal capabilities.

       •   The <u>tput</u> on SVr4-based systems such as Solaris, IRIX64, and HP-UX, as well as others such as AIX  and
           Tru64, also support standard <u>cap-code</u> operands.

       •   A  few  platforms  such  as  FreeBSD recognize <u>termcap</u> codes rather than <u>terminfo</u> capability codes in
           their respective <u>tput</u> commands.  Since 2010, NetBSD's <u>tput</u> uses  <u>terminfo</u>  codes.   Before  that,  it
           (like FreeBSD) recognized <u>termcap</u> codes.

           Beginning in 2021, FreeBSD uses <u>ncurses</u> <b>tput</b>, configured for both <u>terminfo</u> (tested first) and <u>termcap</u>
           (as a fallback).

       Because  (apparently) all <u>certified</u> Unix systems support the full set of capability codes, the reason for
       documenting only a few may not be apparent.

       •   X/Open Curses Issue 7 documents <b>tput</b> differently, with <u>cap-code</u> and the other features used  in  this
           implementation.

       •   That  is,  there  are  two  standards  for  <u>tput</u>:  POSIX  (a  subset)  and  X/Open  Curses  (the full
           implementation).  POSIX documents a subset to avoid the complication of including X/Open  Curses  and
           the terminal capability database.

       •   While  it is certainly possible to write a <u>tput</u> program without using <u>curses</u>, no system with a <u>curses</u>
           implementation provides a <u>tput</u> utility that does not also support standard <u>cap-codes</u>.

       X/Open Curses Issue 7 (2009) is the first version to document utilities.  However  that  part  of  X/Open
       Curses does not follow existing practice (that is, System V <u>curses</u> behavior).

       •   It  assigns  exit  status  4  to  “invalid  operand”,  which  may  have  the same meaning as “unknown
           capability”.  For instance, the source code for Solaris <u>xcurses</u> uses the term “invalid” in this case.

       •   It assigns exit status 255 to a numeric variable that is not  specified  in  the  <u>terminfo</u>  database.
           That  likely  is a documentation error, mistaking the “-1” written to the standard output to indicate
           an absent or canceled numeric capability for an (unsigned) exit status.

       The various System V implementations (AIX, HP-UX, Solaris) use the same exit statuses as <u>ncurses</u>.

       NetBSD <u>curses</u> documents exit statuses that correspond to neither <u>ncurses</u> nor X/Open Curses.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       Bill Joy wrote a <u>tput</u> command during development of 4BSD in October  1980.   This  initial  version  only
       cleared the screen, and did not ship with official distributions.

       System V developed a different <u>tput</u> command.

       •   SVr2 (1984) provided a rudimentary <u>tput</u> that checked the parameter against each predefined capability
           and  returned  the  corresponding  value.   This  version  of  <u>tput</u>  did  not use <b><a href="../man3NCURSES/tparm.3NCURSES.html">tparm</a></b>(3NCURSES) for
           parameterized capabilities.

       •   SVr3 (1987) replaced that with a more extensive program whose support for  <b>init</b>  and  <b>reset</b>  operands
           (more than half the program) incorporated the <b>reset</b> feature of BSD <u>tset</u> written by Eric Allman.

       •   SVr4  (1989) added color initialization by using the <b>orig_colors</b> (<b>oc</b>) and <b>orig_pair</b> (<b>op</b>) capabilities
           in its <b>init</b> logic.

       Keith Bostic refactored BSD <u>tput</u> for shipment in 4.3BSD-Tahoe (1988), then replaced it the next year with
       a new implementation based on System V <u>tput</u>.  Bostic's version similarly accepted some  parameters  named
       for  <u>terminfo</u>  (pseudo-)capabilities:  <b>clear</b>,  <b>init</b>,  <b>longname</b>,  and <b>reset</b>.  However, because he had only
       <u>termcap</u> available, it accepted <u>termcap</u> codes for other capabilities.  Also, Bostic's  BSD  <u>tput</u>  did  not
       modify the terminal modes as the earlier BSD <u>tset</u> had done.

       At  the same time, Bostic added a shell script named “clear” that used <u>tput</u> to clear the screen.  Both of
       these appeared in 4.4BSD, becoming the “modern” BSD implementation of <u>tput</u>.

       The origin of <u>ncurses</u> <b>tput</b> lies outside both System V and BSD, in Ross Ridge's <u>mytinfo</u> package, published
       on <u>comp.sources.unix</u> in December 1992.  Ridge's program made  more  sophisticated  use  of  the  terminal
       capabilities  than  the BSD program.  Eric Raymond used that <u>tput</u> program (and other parts of <u>mytinfo</u>) in
       <u>ncurses</u> in June 1995.  Incorporating the portions  dealing  with  terminal  capabilities  almost  without
       change, Raymond made improvements to the way command-line parameters were handled.

       Before <u>ncurses</u> 6.1 (2018), its <b>tset</b> and <b>tput</b> utilities differed.

       •   <b>tset</b> was more effective, resetting the terminal's modes and special input characters.

       •   On  the  other  hand,  <b>tset</b>'s repertoire of terminal capabilities for resetting the terminal was more
           limited; it had only equivalents of <b>reset_1string</b> (<b>rs1</b>), <b>reset_2string</b> (<b>rs2</b>),  and  <b>reset_file</b>  (<b>rf</b>),
           and not the tab stop and margin update features of <b>tput</b>.

       The <u>reset</u> program is traditionally an alias for <b>tset</b> due to its ability to reset the terminal's modes and
       special input characters.

       As of <u>ncurses</u> 6.1, the “reset” features of the two programs are (mostly) the same.  Two minor differences
       remain.

       •   When  issuing  a reset, the <b>tset</b> program checks whether the device appears to be a pseudoterminal (as
           might be used by a terminal emulator program), and, if it does not, waits one second in  case  it  is
           communicating with a hardware terminal.

       •   The  two  programs  write the terminal initialization strings to different streams; that is, standard
           error for <b>tset</b> and standard output for <b>tput</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tput</b> <b>init</b>
              Initialize the terminal according to the type of terminal in the <u>TERM</u>  environment  variable.   If
              the  system  does not reliably initialize the terminal upon login, this command can be included in
              <u>$HOME/.profile</u> after exporting the <u>TERM</u> environment variable.

       <b>tput</b> <b>-T5620</b> <b>reset</b>
              Reset an AT&amp;T 5620 terminal, overriding the terminal type in the <u>TERM</u> environment variable.

       <b>tput</b> <b>cnorm</b>
              Set cursor to normal visibility.

       <b>tput</b> <b>home</b>
              Move the cursor to line 0, column 0: the upper left corner of the screen,  usually  known  as  the
              “home” cursor position.

       <b>tput</b> <b>clear</b>
              Clear the screen: write the <b>clear_screen</b> capability's value to the standard output stream.

       <b>tput</b> <b>cols</b>
              Report the number of columns used by the current terminal type.

       <b>tput</b> <b>-Tadm3a</b> <b>cols</b>
              Report the number of columns used by an ADM-3A terminal.

       <b>strong=`tput</b> <b>smso`</b> <b>normal=`tput</b> <b>rmso`</b>
              Set  shell  variables  to  capability  values:  <b>strong</b> and <b>normal</b>, to begin and end, respectively,
              stand-out mode for the terminal.  One might use these to present a prompt.

                     printf "${strong}Username:${normal} "

       <b>tput</b> <b>hc</b>
              Indicate via exit status whether the terminal is a hard copy device.

       <b>tput</b> <b>cup</b> <b>23</b> <b>4</b>
              Move the cursor to line 23, column 4.

       <b>tput</b> <b>cup</b>
              Report the value of the <b>cursor_address</b> (<b>cup</b>)  capability  (used  for  cursor  movement),  with  no
              parameters substituted.

       <b>tput</b> <b>longname</b>
              Report  the <u>terminfo</u> database's description of the terminal type specified in the <u>TERM</u> environment
              variable.

       <b>tput</b> <b>-S</b>
              Process multiple capabilities.  The <b>-S</b> option can be profitably used with a shell “here document”.

              $ <b>tput</b> <b>-S</b> <b>&lt;&lt;!</b>
              &gt; <b>clear</b>
              &gt; <b>cup</b> <b>10</b> <b>10</b>
              &gt; <b>bold</b>
              &gt; <b>!</b>

              The foregoing clears the screen, moves the cursor to position (10, 10) and turns  on  bold  (extra
              bright) mode.

       <b>tput</b> <b>clear</b> <b>cup</b> <b>10</b> <b>10</b> <b>bold</b>
              Perform the same actions as the foregoing “<b>tput</b> <b>-S</b>” example.
