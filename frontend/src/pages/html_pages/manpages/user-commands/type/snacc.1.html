</pre><h4><b>For</b> <b>complete</b> <b>and</b> <b>current</b> <b>documentation,</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>snacc</b> <b>manual.</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Snacc  (Sample  Neufeld Asn.1 to C/C++ Compiler) generates C or C++ source code for BER encode and decode
       routines as well as print and free routines for each type in the  given  ASN.1  modules.   Alternatively,
       snacc  can  produce  type tables that can be used for table based/interpreted encoding and decoding.  The
       type table based methods tend to be slower than their C or C++ counterparts but  they  usually  use  less
       memory (table size vs. C/C++ object code).

       Most  of  the  1990  ASN.1  features  are  parsed although some do not affect the generated code.  Fairly
       rigourous error checking is performed on the ASN.1 source; any errors detected will be reported  (printed
       to stderr).

       Each  file  in  the  ASN.1  file list should contain a complete ASN.1 module.  ASN.1 modules that use the
       IMPORTS feature must be compiled together (specify all necessary modules in the ASN.1  file  list).   The
       generated  source  files will include each module's header file in the command line order.  This makes it
       important to order the modules from least dependent to most dependent on the command line to  avoid  type
       ordering problems. Currently, snacc assumes that each ASN.1 file given on the command line depends on all
       of  the  others  on  the  command line.  No attempt is made to only include the header files from modules
       referenced in the import list for that module.

       If the target language is C, snacc will generate a <b>.h</b> and <b>.c</b> file for each specified  ASN.1  module.   If
       the  target  language  is  C++, snacc will generate a <b>.h</b> and <b>.C</b> file for each module.  The generated file
       names will be derived from the module names.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>     Help. Prints a synopsis of snacc and exits.

       <b>-c</b>     Generate C source code.  This is the default behaviour of snacc.  Only one of <b>-c</b> , <b>-C</b> or <b>-T</b> should
              be specified.

       <b>-C</b>     Generate C++ source code.

       <b>-novolat</b>
              Generate ``return *this'' after calling ``abort()''.  (Some  broken  compilers  don't  know  about
              volatile functions, or their abort() isn't correctly typed.)

       <b>-meta</b>  Generate meta code that describes the generated types.  Implies -C.

       <b>-tcl</b>   <u>module.type</u>[,<u>module.type</u>]  Generate code for a Tcl interpreter where <u>module.type</u> are the top level
              PDUs.  Implies -meta.

       <b>-T</b> <u>file</u>This causes snacc to generate type tables and write them to the given
              file.

       <b>-P</b>     This causes snacc to print the parsed ASN.1 modules to stdout after the types  have  been  linked,
              sorted,  and processed.  This option is useful for debugging snacc and observing the modifications
              snacc performs on the types to make code generation simpler.

       <b>-t</b>     Generate type definitions in the target language for each ASN.1 type.

       <b>-v</b>     Generate value definitions  in  the  target  language  for  each  ASN.1  value.   Currently  value
              definitions are limited to INTEGERs, BOOLEANs and OBJECT IDENTIFIERs.

       <b>-e</b>     Generate encode routines in the target language for each ASN.1 type.

       <b>-d</b>     Generate decode routines in the target language for each ASN.1 type.

       <b>-p</b>     Generate print routines in the target language for each ASN.1 type.

       <b>-f</b>     Generate  free  routines  in the target language for each ASN.1 type.  This option only works when
              the target language is C.

              If none of the <b>-t,</b> <b>-v,</b> <b>-e,</b> <b>-d,</b> <b>-p,</b> <b>or</b> <b>-f</b> options are given on the command line, snacc assumes that
              all of them are in effect.  They do not affect type table generation.

       <b>-u</b> <u>file</u>Read the useful types definitions from the ASN.1 module in file <u>file</u>
               for linking purposes.  For some ASN.1 specifications, such as SNMP,  the  useful  types  are  not
              needed.  The  types in the given useful types file are globally available to all modules; a useful
              type definition is overridden by a local or explicitly imported type  with  the  same  name.   The
              current list of useful types is:
                ObjectDecscriptor
                NumericString
                PrintableString
                TeletexString
                T61String
                VideoTexString
                IA5String
                GraphicString
                ISO646String
                GeneralString
                UTCTime
                GeneralizedTime
                EXTERNAL

       <b>-mf</b> <u>number</u>This causes the generated source files to have a
              maximum length of <u>number</u> characters, including their suffix.  The <u>number</u> must be at least 3.  This
              option  is  useful  for supporting operating systems that only support short file names.  A better
              solution is to shorten the module name of each ASN.1 module.

       <b>-l</b> <u>number</u>This is fairly obscure but may be useful.  Each error that the
              decoders can report is given an id number.  The  number  <u>number</u>  is  where  the  error  ids  start
              decreasing from as they are assigned to errors .  The default is -100 if this option is not given.
              Avoid  using  a  number  in the range -100 to 0 since they may conflict with the library routines'
              error ids.  If you are re-compiling the useful types for the library use -50.  Another use of this
              option is to integrate newly generated code with older code; if done correctly, the error ids will
              not conflict.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Snacc has problems with the following case:

              Foo ::= SEQUENCE
              {
                  id IdType,
                  val ANY DEFINED BY id
              }

              IdType ::= CHOICE
              {
                  a INTEGER,
                  b OBJECT IDENTIFIER
              }

       The error checking pass will print an error to the effect that the id type  must  be  INTEGER  or  OBJECT
       IDENTIFER.   To fix this you must modify the error checking pass as well as the code generation pass.  To
       be cheap about it, disable/fix the error checking and hand modify the generated code.

       The hashing code used for handling ANY DEFINED BY id to type mappings will encounter problems if the hash
       table goes more than four levels deep (I think this is unlikely).  To fix this just add  linear  chaining
       at fourth level.
