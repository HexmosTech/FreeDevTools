</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lightspeed - Shows how objects moving at speeds near the speed of light look like.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lightspeed</b> <u>[</u><b>-hsa</b><u>]</u> <u>[</u><b>object</b><u>]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Light  Speed!  is a simulator which can illustrate the effects of special relativity on the appearance of
       objects travelling at ultra-high speeds. Depending on the particular speed,  and  one's  point  of  view,
       relativistic  effects  can  cause the object to appear shorter, longer, brighter, darker, deformed and/or
       off-color.

</pre><h4><b>CONTROLS</b></h4><pre>
       To adjust the velocity, use the slider along the right edge of the main window. You can also  type  in  a
       value,  using  the entry at the top right (press &lt;Enter&gt; once it is in). To change the units shown, press
       the button to the right of the entry, and it will cycle through a small list.

       The object travels in the positive-x direction, which can be visually checked by  activating  Objects  -&gt;
       Coordinate axes.

       Most  interactive  control is performed with the mouse. By holding down a particular button, and dragging
       the pointer around, various camera motions can be obtained:

          Left button:  Revolve camera around view target

          Left button + Shift key:  Revolve view target around camera

          Middle button:  Translate camera left, right, up or down

          Right button:  Dolly in or out

       The first and last motions are generally the most useful.  Should the camera become difficult to  control
       at any point, it may be re-initialized by selecting Camera -&gt; Reset View.
