</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dds2tar - tool for fast tape access

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dds2tar</b> [ <b>-f</b> <u>device</u> ] [ <b>-t</b> <u>indexfile</u> ] [options] <u>string</u> <u>...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dds2tar</b>  uses  an  index to find the files with record seek (a fast operation of DAT devices).  Since the
       file structure of the tape archives is used to extract the files, the archive has to be created  by  <b>tar</b>,
       compressed only by (the transparent signal processor of) the device.  So you can step through the archive
       very  quickly  and  extract  files.   The index may be created using <b>dds2index</b> or <b>tar</b>-vRt and is normally
       stored as a file on your hard disk.

       A tar archive is a sequence of blocks (e.g. 10240 bytes by default), each containing the same number  (20
       by  default)  of  records,  512  byte  each.   <b>dds2tar</b>  reads  the tape and writes the tar records of the
       specified files (that means the header record and the data records of each selected file) to stdout.  You
       may pipe the <b>dds2tar</b> output to the stdin of <u>tar</u> <u>-xvvf</u> <u>-</u> to restore the files to your disk.  (See <b>EXAMPLES</b>
       below.)  Before a file is extracted, the records of parent directories of the file are  also  written  to
       stdout.

       The  index of the archive should contain enough information to compute the number of the block containing
       the header of each selected file.  <b>dds2index</b> will give such a table, <b>tar</b> <b>-Rvt</b> e.g. will not (only  record
       numbers are listed).  A patch for <b>GNU</b> <b>tar-1.12</b> is available, adding the option <b>--record-file.</b>  This patch
       is not included in the version of tar that ships with Debian.  Alternatively there are some tricks to get
       the missing information.

       The strings are regular expressions to select the files.  The matching algorithm is the one from GNU tar.
       If  the  option  <b>-l</b> is given, the matched file names are printed to stdout (You may not pipe this list of
       pathnames to tar!).

       The default device is <u>/dev/nst0</u>, which may be overridden with the environment  variable  <b>TAPE</b>,  which  in
       turn may be overridden with the <b>-f</b> <u>device</u> option. The device must be a SCSI tape device.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-f</b> <u>devicefile</u> Device of the tape archive. Must be a SCSI tape device.

       <b>-t</b> <u>indexfile</u>
              Specifies the index file (default is stdin).

       <b>-s</b> <b>#</b>   Set  the  number  of  the first tape block of the archive. This option is useful only if the index
              file contains the verbose output of <b>tar</b> <b>-Rvt.</b>  Any information about the first  block  inside  the
              index  file will be overridden by this option.  If no information is available, the archive has to
              be the first file of the tape. If you have positioned your tape at the first block of the archive,
              you can use

              <b>dds2tar</b> <b>`mt-dds`</b> <b>-t</b> <b>index</b> <b>...</b> <b>|</b> <b>tar</b> <b>-f</b> <b>-</b> <b>...</b>

              to complete the information of the output of <b>tar</b> <b>-Rvt</b> stored in the index file.

       <b>-b</b> <b>#</b>   Set the blocksize of the archive (tar -b #). This option is useful only if the index file contains
              the verbose output of tar (or if you have problems  with  the  size  of  the  internal  buffer  of
              dds2tar).   Any  information  about the blocksize inside the index file will be overridden by this
              option.  If no information is available, the default blocksize of tar is used.

       <b>-z</b>     The index file should be read and stored in compressed mode.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>you</b> <b>didn't</b> <b>really</b> <b>need</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--z,</b> <b>--no-compress</b>
              Don't filter the archive file through gzip.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quick</b>
              Don't extract the parent directories of the selected objects from tape.   <b>--body</b>  Write  only  the
              first  selected  file  to  stdout. This is useful if you want to read a file or extract an archive
              which is part of the current archive.

       <b>-v</b>,<b>--verbose</b>
              verbose mode.

       <b>--hash-mode</b>
              Print a hash sign for each MB.

       <b>-V</b>,<b>--version</b>
              Print only the Version Number to stderr.

       <b>-l</b>     Don't access the tape but print the file names to stdout.  You may not pipe this list of pathnames
              into tar.

       <b>--extract</b>
              The stdout is closed and opened by a pipe to the command <b>tar</b> <b>-fxb</b> <b>-</b> <b>1</b> <b>.</b>  You may find this  option
              convenient, I like to pipe the output to tar by hand.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Example of <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>index</b> from the default tape /dev/nst0 and storing it in file archive.idx:

              dds2index -t archive.idx

       Alternatively  you  can  use  a  patched  version of tar to create an index file.  With the patch you can
       direct the errors and warning to stdout  and  the  index  information  including  information  about  the
       blocksize and the number of the first block to a file:

              tar -t --record-file archive.idx

       If  the  archive  is  the  first file of the tape and the blocksize is the default of 20, you can use the
       verbose output of tar (-Rv) as an index file.

              tar -t -v -R | tee archive.idx

       If the archive is not the first file of the tape, you can store all the necessary information inside  the
       index file with the use of <b>mt-dds</b> and <b>tar</b> :

              mt asf ...
              mt-dds tell &gt; archive.idx
              tar -tvR &gt;&gt;archive.idx

       Example of <b>using</b> <b>dds2tar</b> to extract the gnu library (all files containing the string "glibc" in filename)
       from the default tape /dev/nst0, using the previously stored index file archive.idx:

              dds2tar -t archive.idx '*glibc*' | tar xvvf -

       To  see  in  advance  what would happen in the previous command without actually writing anything to your
       disk, you may use:

              dds2tar -t archive.idx '*glibc*' | tar tvvf -

       Example of checking the matches. You may try:

              dds2tar -t archive.idx -l '*glibc*'

</pre><h4><b>BACKGROUND</b> <b>INFORMATION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>tapes</b>
       A tape device handles all I/O (read, write, seek) in units of <u>tape</u> <u>records</u>.  The bigger  a  tape  record,
       the  more  effective  usually  is  the  access (and the less gaps are on QIC-tapes).  However, normally a
       program will only read or write complete tape records.

       Normal tape drives allow to seek only relative to the current position. However, some newer SCSI-2 tapes,
       i.e. DAT, conforming to the DDS standard, keep track of the absolute position on the  tape  by  inserting
       the tape record number inside each track.  This number can be read while the fast seek is performed.

       The  <b><a href="../man1/tar.1.html">tar</a>(1)</b>  program uses a slightly different terminology.  It calls <u>tape</u> <u>blocks</u> what normally is called
       <u>tape</u> <u>records</u>.  In the following sections we use the tar terminology to avoid confusion.

   <b>tar</b>
       The unit inside a <b>tar</b> archive is a <u>tar</u> <u>record</u> with a fixed length of 512 bytes. Every file, directory  or
       soft  link  will occupy at least one tar record of information about pathname, permission information and
       so on called header record.  The data of each file is stored in additional tar records directly after the
       header record of that file.

       tar reports the <u>tar</u> <u>record</u> <u>number</u> of every header record in the archive with its -R option.   tar  counts
       the records continuously, starting with <b>0</b> (if invoked as tar -tR) or with <b>1</b> (if invoked as tar -cR).

       tar handles multiple records as a <u>tar</u> <u>block</u>, mainly to make the access of tapes (or disks) more efficient
       (and save tape space of QIC-tapes).  tar only writes and reads full blocks to or from an archive.  The -b
       option of tar controls, how many records are in one block. The default number of records per block is <b>20</b>.
       This number is usually called the <u>tar</u> <u>block</u> <u>size</u>.  However, this term is a little bit confusing, since it
       does  not  mean  the  number  of  bytes in a block.  Thus a perhaps better name would be the <u>tar</u> <u>blocking</u>
       <u>factor</u>.

   <b>tar</b> <b>on</b> <b>tapes</b>
       tar writes or reads its archive to or from tape in units of tar blocks.  As stated above, only a complete
       tape block may be transferred to/from tape.  To extract a specific tar block from tape, one has  to  read
       an entire tape block into a buffer and extract the specified tar record from the buffer manually.  If you
       would  like to read a tar record with a given number, you have to know the number of the first tape block
       of the archive and the tar block size to compute the number of the tape  block  witch  contains  the  tar
       record  to read.  If the tar archive is the first file on the tape, the <u>tape</u> <u>block</u> <u>number</u> is the equal to
       the <u>tar</u> <u>block</u> <u>number</u>.

       <b>Example:</b> A file with the tar record number 1234 (records start with  0)  may  be  found  in  a  tape  tar
       archive, written with a blocking factor of 20.  It may be found in the tar block with the number
                       blk = (int) 1234/20 = (int) 61.7 = 61
       which is also the tape block number.  The requested file is within this tar block at the record offset
                       rec = 1234-(61*20) = 14
       in 512 byte units.

       If a current archive is not the first archive on the tape, then the number of <u>tape</u> <u>blocks</u> of all previous
       archives  has  to be added to the block number computed above, to get the <u>current</u> <u>tape</u> <u>block</u> <u>number</u>.  The
       number of previous tape records should be obtained from DDS devices when the tape is  positioned  at  the
       beginning of the current archive (use <b>mt-dds</b> without arguments for example).

       <b>Example:</b>  Assuming  the  archive  in  the  above example to be the second file on a tape, and the archive
       starts at tape block 20222.  Then we will find our file with tar record number 1234 in the tape block
                       tblk = 20222 + (int) 1234/20 = 20283
       on the tape.  The record offset inside the tape block will be the same as above.

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       This program can only read records (tar is calling  them  tape  blocks)  up  to  32  kbytes  due  to  the
       limitations  of the Linux device driver.  The extracted archive is written to stdout with a block size of
       512 bytes.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The environment variable <b>TAPE</b> overrides the default tape device /dev/nst0.  The variable <b>DDS2TAR</b>  <b>cat</b>  <b>be</b>
       <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>some</b> <b>options,</b> <b>e.g.</b>  <b>--compress,</b> <b>-z,</b> <b>-s</b> <b>#</b> <b>,</b> <b>-b</b> <b>#.</b>

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  was  created  to  use the fast seek operation of my DAT streamer. The tapes are called dds
       (digital data storage).  Since the program will write a tar archive to  stdout,  I  called  this  program
       <b>dds2tar</b>.   If  I  created the index file, I'm now able to restore a file of 1MB within one minute even if
       the tape contains more than 2GB of data.

       Thanks to Andreas (<a href="mailto:Andreas_Bagge@h2.maus.de">Andreas_Bagge@h2.maus.de</a>), who has written a  nice  manual  page  for  the  overloaded
       version  1.1.3  of the program dds2tar (I added too much features ... ) His manual page for dds2tar-1.1.3
       gave me the idea how to split the  program  dds2tar  into  the  peaces  dds2tar,  dds2index  and  mt-dds.
       Additionally his manual page was the starting point for this page.

       Since  the  version  2.2  has  a  very robust algorithm to read the index file and the ability of pattern
       matching, a lot of options where obsolete and has been deleted. I tried to make dds2tar as simple I can.
