</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       callisto - Unix version of the <u>e-Callisto</u> software

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>callisto</b> [ options ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Unix  version  of  the e-Callisto software is a daemon program that can record uncalibrated data and
       spectral overviews from the Callisto hardware. If calibration of the data is desired,  it  must  be  done
       afterwards  by  other  means.  The  recorded  data  is saved as FITS files into the configured directory.
       Version 1.1.0 of the software supports Callisto firmware versions 1.5, 1.7  and  1.8.  Previous  versions
       supported only firmware version 1.5.

       The  program  operation  can  be  controlled  by  a schedule file, and also directly via a command server
       listening on a TCP port.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c,</b> <b>--config</b> <u>FILE</u>
              Use the specified configuration file instead of <b>/etc/callisto/callisto.cfg</b>.  The location  of  the
              configuration  file also specifies the configuration directory, which is where other configuration
              files (frequency file and schedule) are assumed to be  in  if  they  are  not  specified  with  an
              absolute file name.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--datadir</b> <u>DIR</u>
              Specify  the  directory where the recorded data is stored as FITS files.  This overrides the value
              set in the configuration file.

       <b>-O,</b> <b>--ovsdir</b> <u>DIR</u>
              Specify the directory where spectral overview result files are written. This overrides  the  value
              set in the configuration file.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--schedule</b> <u>FILE</u>
              Use the given schedule file instead of <b>scheduler.cfg</b> in the configuration directory.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--user</b> <u>USER</u>
              Run as the given user.

       <b>-L,</b> <b>--load-channels</b>
              Upload  the  channel  frequency data into the EEPROM. This is not normally done to conserve EEPROM
              write cycles, and also to speed up program start. The data  only  needs  to  be  uploaded  if  the
              channel frequencies have changed.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>--check-only</b>
              Try  to  reset and identify Callisto hardware, and exit with status 0 if Callisto is detected, and
              with status 1 otherwise. The check is done after channel upload, so -L and -C can be used together
              for channel upload.

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--pidfile</b> <u>FILE</u>
              Write program PID in the specified file.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--debug</b>
              Do not fork into background and turn on verbose debug messages. Logging is output to stderr.

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--serial-debug</b>
              Print serial port traffic into stderr. Give this option twice to enable colors: red color for data
              going to Callisto and blue for data coming from Callisto. This option implies --debug.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Print program version.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print program help text showing available options.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The Unix callisto uses the same configuration file format as the Windows software:  entries  are  in  the
       format  <b>[variable]=value</b> and comments start with <b>//</b> or <b>/*</b>.  The variables are compatible with the Windows
       software, except of course those that refer to file paths.

       The following variables must be defined:

       <b>rxcomport</b>
              Full path of the serial port device where the Callisto hardware is  connected  to  this  computer,
              e.g. /dev/ttyS0.

       <b>instrument</b>
              Short instrument code, appears as the first component of the FITS file names.

       <b>origin</b> Location of the instrument (e.g. the institute/observatory).

       <b>frqfile</b>
              The  channel  frequency  file to use. the file name is either an absolute path, or relative to the
              configuration directory.

       <b>datapath</b>
              The directory where FITS files of the recorded data are stored.

       <b>longitude</b>
              Longitude of the instrument location in degrees, in the form of <b>E,12.3</b> or <b>W,45.6</b>.

       <b>latitude</b>
              Longitude of the instrument location in degrees, in the form of <b>N,12.3</b> or <b>S,45.6</b>.

       <b>height</b> Height above sea level of the instrument location, in meters.

       <b>filetime</b>
              The time in seconds to record into one FITS file.

       <b>focuscode</b>
              The focuscode to use.

       The following variables may be defined:

       <b>ovspath</b>
              The directory where spectral overview files are stored. Default is the value of <b>datapath</b>.

       <b>chargepump</b>
              Whether PLL charge pump should be on or off.  Default is 1 (on).

       <b>agclevel</b>
              PWM level for tuner AGC.  Default is 120.

       <b>clocksource</b>
              Which source to use as the sampling clock. 1 for internal clock,  2  for  external  1  MHz  clock.
              Default is 1 (internal clock).

       <b>mmode</b>  Select  the  measurement  mode.  As only mode 3 is supported, setting this to any other value will
              cause an error on callisto startup. Defaults to 3.

       <b>autostart</b>
              If set to 1, recording is automatically started on program startup. If set to 0, recording is  not
              automatically  started.  If not defined or set to a negative value, the autostart value is deduced
              from the schedule, or set to 1 if there is no schedule. Default is -1 (deduce from schedule).

       The following variables are specific to the Unix version:

       <b>net_port</b>
              Start the command server on this TCP port. If not defined, the command server is not started.

       Variables not listed above are ignored.

</pre><h4><b>FREQUENCY</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The frequency file has the same syntax as  the  configuration  file.  The  following  variables  must  be
       defined:

       <b>target</b> This must have the value CALLISTO.

       <b>number_of_measurements_per_sweep</b>
              The number of channels to use, from 1 to 512.

       <b>number_of_sweeps_per_second</b>
              How many channel sweeps to perform per second. The sample rate derived from multiplying the number
              of channels by this value should not exceed 1000.

       The following variable may be defined:

       <b>external_lo</b>
              Frequency of the frontend downconverter local oscillator in MHz. Defaults to 0.

       Additionally there must be an entry in the form <u>[NNNN]=FFF.FFF,L</u> for each channel used, where NNNN is the
       channel  number,  from  1  onwards,  FFF.FFF  is  the  channel  frequency  in MHz, and L is the number of
       lightcurve samples (ignored by the Unix version).

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>AND</b> <b>LOGGING</b></h4><pre>
       The FITS files have a file name in the format <u>CCC_YYYYMMDD_hhmmss_FF.fit</u>, where  CCC  is  the  instrument
       code  specified by the configuration variable <b>instrument</b>, YYYYMMDD and hhmmss are the (UTC) starting date
       and time of the data in the file, and FF is the focuscode used.

       Spectral overview file names have the format <u>OVS_CCC_YYYYMMDD_hhmmss.prn</u>.

       Logging is done to the daemon facility of syslog, which typically ends up in /var/log/daemon.log.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>SERVER</b></h4><pre>
       The command server listens at the TCP port specified by the configuration file variable <b>net_port</b>.  When a
       connection is established, the server prints a banner line "e-Callisto for Unix V.V.V",  where  V.V.V  is
       the  program  version. After that it will accept commands. Responses to commands consist of a status line
       beginning either with OK or ERROR, followed by zero or more data lines, and terminated by an empty  line.
       The following commands are available.

       <b>start</b>  Start  data  recording.  If  a  spectral  overview  is  in progress, recording is started after it
              finishes. If recording is already in progress, a new FITS file  is  started  at  the  end  of  the
              current channel sweep.  This command never fails.

       <b>stop</b>   Stop  data recording. If a spectral overview is in progress, recording is not (re)started after it
              finishes. This command never fails.

       <b>overview</b>
              Start a spectral overview. If an overview is already in progress, this command is  ignored.  After
              the  overview has finished, the recording state is restored to its previous value (unless start or
              stop commands were issued during the overview). This command never fails.

       <b>get</b>    Get the data from the latest complete channel sweep. The first data line printed is in the  format
              <u>t=NNNNNNNNNN.NNNNNN</u>,  giving  the start time of the sweep in Unix epoch time. The rest of the data
              lines have the format <u>chNNN=FFF.FFF:XXX</u>, where NNN is the channel number, from 001 to 512, FFF.FFF
              is the channel frequency in MHz, and XXX is the channel  value  (in  A/D  converter  units).  This
              command may fail if there is no data in the buffer.

       <b>quit</b>   Close connection to the command server. This command never fails.

</pre><h4><b>SCHEDULING</b></h4><pre>
       Scheduled  operation  of  the  program  is  supported  via  a schedule file. The default schedule file is
       <b>scheduler.cfg</b> in  the  configuration  directory.  The  schedule  file  contains  entries  in  the  format
       <u>hh:mm:ss,FF,A</u>, which specifies the UTC time hh:mm:ss of the schedule entry, the focuscode FF for which it
       is valid for, and the action A to take. Supported actions are start (3), stop (0) and overview (8).

       The  Unix  version of callisto does not support changing the focuscode or the frequency file (which would
       be the optional fourth field of the schedule entry) on the fly.

       If there is no schedule file,  the  program  remains  in  manual  control,  possibly  starting  recording
       automatically  on  startup.  The  schedule  file is checked for existence or changes every minute. If the
       schedule file appears or has changed, it is (re)loaded and  the  new  schedule  becomes  active.  If  the
       program  is  in  scheduled  operation, and the schedule file disappears, is empty, or cannot be read, the
       program reverts to manual control and recording is started.

       The helper script <b><a href="../man1/callisto-sunschedule.1.html">callisto-sunschedule</a></b>(1) can be used to create schedule  files  that  record  data  only
       between sunrise and sunset.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       Sending  the  <b>HUP</b> signal to the callisto program has the same effect as issuing the start command via the
       command server.

       When the program receives the <b>TERM</b> signal, it tries to exit cleanly by stopping the Callisto hardware and
       writing any pending data buffers to disk. If a second termination signal is sent before  the  clean  exit
       has finished, the program exits immediately, possibly causing the latest data to be lost.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/callisto</b>
              Default configuration directory.

       <b>/etc/callisto/callisto.cfg</b>
              Default configuration file.

       <b>/etc/callisto/scheduler.cfg</b>
              Default schedule file.
