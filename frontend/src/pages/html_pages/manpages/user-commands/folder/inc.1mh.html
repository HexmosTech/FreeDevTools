</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>inc</b> incorporates mail from the user's incoming mail drop into an <b>nmh</b> folder.  If the mail drop is a file,
       it  can  be  in  <b>mbox</b>  or <b>MMDF</b> format.  If the mail drop is a directory it is considered to be in <b>Maildir</b>
       format.

       You may specify which folder to use with <u>+folder</u>.  If no folder is specified, then <b>inc</b>  will  use  either
       the  folder  given by a (non-empty) “<u>Inbox</u>” entry in the user's profile, or the folder named “<u>inbox</u>”.  If
       the specified (or default) folder doesn't exist, the user will be queried prior to its creation.

       When the new messages are incorporated into the folder, they are assigned numbers starting with the  next
       highest  number  for  the  folder.   As  the  messages  are  processed, a <b>scan</b> listing of the new mail is
       produced.

       The newly created messages will have a mode of 0600,  see  <a href="../man1/chmod.1.html">chmod</a>(1),  on  filesystems  that  support  it.
       Alternatively,  a  “<u>Msg-Protect:</u>  <u>nnn</u>” profile entry gives the mode to use, in octal.  For all subsequent
       operations on these messages, this initially assigned mode will be preserved.

       If the switch <b>-audit</b> <u>audit-file</u> is specified (usually as a default switch in the  user's  profile),  then
       <b>inc</b> will append a header line and a line per message to the specified audit-file with the format:

            &lt;&lt;inc&gt;&gt; date
            &lt;scan line for first message&gt;
            &lt;scan line for second message&gt;
            &lt;etc.&gt;

       This  is  useful  for keeping track of volume and source of incoming mail.  Eventually, <b>repl</b>, <b>forw</b>, <b>comp</b>,
       and <b>dist</b> may also output  audit  information  to  this  (or  another)  file,  perhaps  with  “<u>Message-Id</u>”
       information  to  keep  an  exact correspondence history.  “<u>Audit-file</u>” is assumed to be in the user's nmh
       directory unless a full path is specified.

       <b>inc</b> will incorporate even improperly formatted messages into the user's nmh  folder,  inserting  a  blank
       line prior to the offending component and printing a comment identifying the bad message.

       In  all  cases, except the use of <b>-file</b> <u>name</u> (see below), the user's mail drop will be zeroed, unless the
       <b>-notruncate</b> switch is given.

       If the profile entry “<u>Unseen-Sequence</u>” is present and non-empty, then <b>inc</b> will  add  each  of  the  newly
       incorporated messages to each sequence named in the profile entry.  <b>inc</b> will not zero each sequence prior
       to adding messages.

       The interpretation of the <b>-form</b> <u>formatfile</u>, <b>-format</b> <u>string</u>, and <b>-width</b> <u>columns</u> switches is the same as in
       <u><a href="../man1/scan.1.html">scan</a></u>(1).

       By  using  the  <b>-file</b>  <u>name</u> switch, one can direct <b>inc</b> to incorporate messages from a file other than the
       user's mail drop.  Note that the named file will <u>not</u> be zeroed, unless the <b>-truncate</b> switch is given.

       The <b>-file</b> switch does not support the use of standard input.  Instead, the <b>rcvstore</b> command can  be  used
       to incorporate mail from the standard input stream.

       If  the  environment  variable <b>$MAILDROP</b> is set, then <b>inc</b> uses it as the location of the user's mail drop
       instead of the default (the <b>-file</b> <u>name</u> switch  still  overrides  this,  however).   If  this  environment
       variable  is  not  set,  then <b>inc</b> will consult the profile entry “<u>MailDrop</u>” for this information.  If the
       value found is not absolute, then it is interpreted relative to the user's <b>nmh</b> directory.  If  the  value
       is not found, then <b>inc</b> will look in the standard system location for the user's mail drop.

       The  <b>-silent</b> switch directs <b>inc</b> to be quiet and not ask any questions at all.  This is useful for putting
       <b>inc</b> in the background and going on to other things.

   <b>Using</b> <b>POP</b>
       <b>inc</b> will normally check local mail drops for mail, as covered above.  But if the option “<u>pophost</u>” is  set
       in “<u>mts.conf</u>”, or if the <b>-host</b> <u>hostname</u> switch is given, or if the <b>$MAILHOST</b> environment variable is set,
       then  <b>inc</b>  will  query  this  POP service host for mail to incorporate.  If <b>$MAILHOST</b> is set and <b>-host</b> is
       specified as well, the command-line switch will override the  environment  variable.   The  <b>-port</b>  switch
       specifies  the  port  name  or  number used to connect to the POP server.  If unspecified, the default is
       “pop3”.

       To specify a username for authentication with the  POP  server,  use  the  <b>-user</b>  <u>username</u>  switch.   The
       credentials profile entry in <u><a href="../man5/mh-profile.5.html">mh-profile</a></u>(5) describes the ways to supply a username and password.

       If  passed  the  <b>-proxy</b> <u>command</u> switch, <b>inc</b> will use the specified command to establish the connection to
       the POP server.  The string <u>%h</u> in the command will be substituted by the hostname to connect to.

       For debugging purposes, you may give the  switch  <b>-snoop</b>,  which  will  allow  you  to  monitor  the  POP
       transaction.  If <b>-sasl</b> <b>-saslmech</b> <b>xoauth2</b> is used, the HTTP transaction is also shown.

       If  <b>nmh</b> has been compiled with SASL support, the <b>-sasl</b> switch will enable the use of SASL authentication.
       Depending on the SASL mechanism used, this may require an additional password prompt from the  user  (but
       the  <u>netrc</u> file can be used to store this password, as described in <u><a href="../man5/mh-profile.5.html">mh-profile</a></u>(5)).  The <b>-saslmech</b> switch
       can be used to select a particular SASL mechanism.

       If SASL authentication is successful, <b>inc</b>  will  attempt  to  negotiate  a  security  layer  for  session
       encryption.   Encrypted  traffic  is  labelled  with `(encrypted)' and `(decrypted)' when viewing the POP
       transaction with the <b>-snoop</b> switch; see <u><a href="../man8/post.8.html">post</a></u>(8)'s description of <b>-snoop</b> for its other features.

       If <b>nmh</b> has been compiled with OAuth support, the <b>-sasl</b> and <b>-saslmech</b> <b>xoauth2</b> switches will  enable  OAuth
       authentication.   The  <b>-user</b> switch must be used, and the <u>user-name</u> must be an email address the user has
       for the service, which must be specified with the <b>-authservice</b> <u>service</u> switch.  Before  using  this,  the
       user  must  authorize  nmh by running <b>mhlogin</b> and granting authorization to that account.  See <u><a href="../man1/mhlogin.1.html">mhlogin</a></u>(1)
       for more details.

       If <b>nmh</b> has been compiled with TLS support, the <b>-tls</b> and <b>-initialtls</b> switches will require the negotiation
       of TLS when connecting to the remote POP server. The <b>-tls</b> switch will direct <b>inc</b> to negotiate TLS as part
       of the normal POP protocol using the STLS command.  The <b>-initialtls</b> switch will direct <b>inc</b>  to  negotiate
       TLS immediately after the connection has taken place, before any POP commands are sent or received.  Data
       encrypted by TLS is labeled `(tls-encrypted)' and `(tls-decrypted)' when viewing the POP transaction with
       the <b>-snoop</b> switch.  The <b>-notls</b> switch will disable all attempts to negotiate TLS.

       When  using TLS the default is to verify the remote certificate and SubjectName against the local trusted
       certificate store.  This can be controlled by the  <b>-certverify</b>  and  <b>-nocertverify</b>  switches.   See  your
       OpenSSL documentation for more information on certificate verification.

       +folder             defaulted by “Inbox” above.
       -noaudit
       -changecur
       -format             As described above.
       -nosilent
       -nosasl
       -notruncate         Unless <b>-file</b> <u>name</u> is given.
       -width              The width of the terminal.

</pre><h4><b>CONTEXT</b></h4><pre>
       The  folder into which messages are being incorporated will become the current folder.  The first message
       incorporated will become the current message, unless the <b>-nochangecur</b> option is specified.   This  leaves
       the context ready for a <b>show</b> of the first new message.
