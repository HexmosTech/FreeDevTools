</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       folder, folders - set/list current nmh folder/message

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>folder</b> [<b>-help</b>] [<b>-version</b>] [<u>+folder</u>] [<u>msg</u>] [<b>-all</b> | <b>-noall</b>] [<b>-create</b> | <b>-nocreate</b>] [<b>-fast</b> | <b>-nofast</b>]
            [<b>-header</b> | <b>-noheader</b>] [<b>-recurse</b> | <b>-norecurse</b>] [<b>-total</b> | <b>-nototal</b>] [<b>-list</b> | <b>-nolist</b>] [<b>-push</b> | <b>-pop</b>]
            [<b>-pack</b> | <b>-nopack</b>] [<b>-print</b> | <b>-noprint</b>] [<b>-verbose</b> | <b>-noverbose</b>]

       <b>folders</b> is equivalent to <b>folder</b> <b>-all</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When  <b>folder</b>  is  given  the  <b>-print</b>  switch  (the  default), it lists: the current folder, the number of
       messages in it and their range (low-high), the folder's current  message,  and  an  indication  of  extra
       files, if any.  For example:

            inbox+            has  16 messages (  3- 22); cur=  5.

       If  a  <u>+folder</u>  and/or  <u>msg</u>  are  specified, they will become the current folder and/or message.  (When a
       <u>+folder</u> argument is given, this corresponds to a “cd” operation in the shell; when no <u>+folder</u> argument is
       given, this corresponds roughly to a “pwd” operation in the shell.) If <b>-noprint</b> is specified,  a  <u>+folder</u>
       and/or  <u>msg</u>  may still be specified to set the current folder and/or message, but the folder summary will
       not be printed.

       If the specified (or default) folder doesn't exist, <b>folder</b> will ask the user  if  the  folder  should  be
       created;  when  standard input is not a tty, the answer is assumed to be “yes”.  The <b>-create</b> switch tells
       <b>folder</b> to create new folders without query.  (This is an easy way to create an  empty  folder  for  later
       use.)   Specifying  <b>-nocreate</b>  will  cause  <b>folder</b>  to print an error message and exit without creating a
       folder.

   <b>Multiple</b> <b>Folders</b>
       Specifying <b>-all</b> will produce a summary line for each top-level folder in the user's <b>nmh</b> directory, sorted
       alphabetically.  (If <b>folder</b> is invoked by a name ending with  “s”  (e.g.   <b>folders</b>),  <b>-all</b>  is  assumed.)
       Specifying <b>-recurse</b> with <b>-all</b> will include a line for all sub-folders.  These folders are all preceded by
       any read-only folders, which occur as “<u>atr-cur-</u>” entries in the user's <b>nmh</b> context.  For example:

            FOLDER                  # MESSAGES RANGE      CUR     (OTHERS)
            /var/work/folder  has  35 messages ( 1- 35);  cur=23.
            /usr/bugs/Mail    has  82 messages ( 1-108);  cur=82.
            ff                has  no messages.
            inbox+            has  16 messages ( 3- 22);  cur= 5.
            mh                has  76 messages (15- 76);  cur=70.
            notes             has   2 messages ( 1-  2);  cur= 1.
            ucom              has 124 messages ( 1-124);  cur= 6; (others).
            TOTAL = 339 messages in 7 folders

       The  “+”  after  <u>inbox</u> indicates that it is the current folder.  The “(others)” indicates that the folder
       <u>ucom</u> contains files which aren't messages; these may either be sub-folders, or files  that  don't  belong
       under the <b>nmh</b> file naming scheme.

       The  header  is  output  if  either  the  <b>-all</b>  or  <b>-header</b>  switches are specified.  It is suppressed by
       <b>-noheader</b>.

       The folder and message totals are output if either the <b>-all</b> or <b>-total</b> switches are specified.   They  are
       suppressed by <b>-nototal</b>.

       If  <b>-fast</b> is given, only the folder name (or names, in the case of <b>-all</b>) will be listed.  (This is faster
       because the folders need not be read.)

       If a <u>+folder</u> is given with the <b>-all</b> switch, <b>folder</b> will, in addition to setting the current folder,  list
       the  top-level  sub-folders  for  the  current folder (with <b>-norecurse</b>) or list all sub-folders under the
       current folder recursively (with <b>-recurse</b>).

       If <u>msg</u> is supplied, together with <u>+folder</u> or without <b>-all</b>, it will become the current message of  <u>+folder</u>
       (if it had been supplied) or the current folder.

       The  <b>-recurse</b>  switch lists each folder recursively, so its use effectively defeats the speed enhancement
       of <b>-fast</b>, since each folder must be searched for sub-folders.  Nevertheless,  the  combination  of  these
       options is useful.

   <b>Compacting</b> <b>a</b> <b>Folder</b>
       The  <b>-pack</b>  switch  will  compress the message names in the designated folders, removing holes in message
       numbering.  The <b>-verbose</b> switch directs <b>folder</b> to tell the user the  general  actions  it  is  taking  to
       compress the folder.

   <b>The</b> <b>Folder</b> <b>Stack</b>
       The  <b>-push</b>  switch  directs <b>folder</b> to push the current folder onto the <u>folder-stack</u>, and make the <u>+folder</u>
       argument the current folder.  If <u>+folder</u> is not given, the current folder and the top of the <u>folder-stack</u>
       are exchanged.  This corresponds to the “pushd” operation in the shell.

       The <b>-pop</b> switch directs <b>folder</b> to discard the top of the <u>folder-stack</u>, after setting the  current  folder
       to  that  value.  No <u>+folder</u> argument is allowed.  This corresponds to the “popd” operation in the shell.
       The <b>-push</b> and <b>-pop</b> switches are mutually exclusive: the last  occurrence  of  either  one  overrides  any
       previous occurrence of the other.  The use of either of these switches also sets <b>-list</b>, by default.

       The  <b>-list</b>  switch  directs  <b>folder</b>  to  list the <u>folder-stack</u>.  No <u>+folder</u> argument is allowed.  After a
       successful <b>-push</b> or <b>-pop</b>, the <b>-list</b> action is taken, unless a <b>-nolist</b> switch follows them on the  command
       line.   This  corresponds  to  the  “dirs”  operation  in the shell.  The <b>-push</b>, <b>-pop</b>, and <b>-list</b> switches
       disable the default <b>-print</b> behavior.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       $HOME/.mh_profile   The user's profile.

</pre><h4><b>PROFILE</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Path:               To determine the user's nmh directory.
       Current-Folder:     To find the default current folder.
       Folder-Protect:     To set mode when creating a new folder.
       Folder-Stack:       To determine the folder stack.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULTS</b></h4><pre>
       +folder             The current folder.

       -noheader
       -nototal
       -nopack
       -norecurse
       -noverbose
       -print              is the default if none of <b>-list</b>, <b>-push</b>, or <b>-pop</b> are specified.
       -list               is the default if <b>-push</b>, or <b>-pop</b> is specified.

</pre><h4><b>CONTEXT</b></h4><pre>
       If <u>+folder</u> and/or <u>msg</u> are given, they will become the current folder and/or message.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There is no way to restore the default behavior (to ask the user whether to create a non-existent folder)
       after <b>-create</b> or <b>-nocreate</b> is given.
