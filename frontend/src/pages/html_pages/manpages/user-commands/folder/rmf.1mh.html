       rmf - remove an nmh folder

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>rmf</b> [<b>-help</b>] [<b>-version</b>] [<u>+folder</u>] [<b>-interactive</b> | <b>-nointeractive</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rmf</b>  removes  all  of the messages (files) within the specified (or default) folder, and then removes the
       folder (directory) itself.

       If there are any files within the folder which are not a part of <b>nmh</b>, they will <u>not</u> be  removed,  and  an
       error  will  be produced.  If the folder is given explicitly, or the <b>-nointeractive</b> option is given, then
       the folder will be removed without confirmation.  Otherwise, the user will be asked for confirmation.  If
       <b>rmf</b> can't, for some reason, find the current folder the folder to be removed defaults to `+inbox' (unless
       overridden by the user's profile entry “Inbox”), with confirmation.

       If the folder being removed is a subfolder, the parent folder will become the new current folder, and <b>rmf</b>
       will produce a message telling the user this has happened.  This provides an easy mechanism for selecting
       a set of messages, operating on the list, then removing the list and returning  to  the  current  folder,
       from which the list was extracted.

       If  <b>rmf</b>  is  used  on a read-only folder, it will delete all the private sequences (i.e., .RI “atr- seq -
       folder ” entries) for this folder from your context without affecting the folder itself.

       <b>rmf</b> irreversibly deletes messages that don't have other links, so use it with caution.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       $HOME/.mh_profile          The user profile

</pre><h4><b>PROFILE</b> <b>COMPONENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Path:                To determine the user's nmh directory
       Current-Folder:      To find the default current folder
       Inbox:               To find the default inbox

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man1/folder.1.html">folder</a></u>(1), <u><a href="../man1/rmm.1.html">rmm</a></u>(1)

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULTS</b></h4><pre>
       `<b>+folder</b>' defaults to the current folder, usually with confirmation
       `<b>-interactive</b>' if +folder' not given, `-nointeractive' otherwise

</pre><h4><b>CONTEXT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rmf</b> will set the current folder to the parent folder if a subfolder is removed; or if the current  folder
       is removed, it will make “inbox” current.  Otherwise, it doesn't change the current folder or message.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Although  intuitively  one  would  suspect that <b>rmf</b> works recursively, it does not.  Hence, if you have a
       sub-folder within a folder, in order to <b>rmf</b> the parent, you must first <b>rmf</b> each of the children.
