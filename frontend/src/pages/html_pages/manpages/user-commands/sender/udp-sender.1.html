</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "Udp-sender" is used to broadcast a file (for instance a disk image) to multiple "udp-receivers" on the
       local LAN. In order to do this, it uses Ethernet multicast or broadcast, so that all receivers profit
       from the same physical datastream. Thus, sending to 10 destinations does not take more time than it would
       take to send just 2.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Basic</b> <b>options</b>
       --file <u>file</u>
           Reads  data to be transmitted from <u>file</u>. If this parameter is not supplied, data to be transmitted is
           read from stdin instead.

       --pipe <u>command</u>
           Sends data through <u>pipe</u> before transmitting it. This is useful for compressing/decompressing  it,  or
           for  stripping  out  unused blocks. The <u>command</u> gets a direct handle on the input file or device, and
           thus may seek inside it, if needed. "Udpcast" itself also keeps a handle on the file, which  is  used
           for an informal progress display. The <u>command</u>'s stdout is a pipe to udpcast.

       --autostart <u>n</u>
           Starts transmission after <u>n</u> retransmissions of hello packet, without waiting for a key stroke. Useful
           for  unattended operation, where udp-sender is started from a cron-job for a broadcast/multicast at a
           scheduled time.

   <b>Networking</b> <b>options</b>
       The following networking options should be supplied both on the sender and the receivers:

       --portbase <u>portbase</u>
           Default ports to use for udpcast. Two ports are used: <u>portbase</u> and <u>portbase+1</u> . Thus,  <u>Portbase</u>  must
           be  even.  Default  is  9000.  The  same  <u>portbase</u>  must  be  specified  for  both  "udp-sender"  and
           "udp-receiver".

       --interface <u>interface</u>
           Network interface used to send out the data. Default is "eth0"

       --ttl <u>time</u> <u>to</u> <u>live</u>
           Sets the <u>time-to-live</u> parameter for the multicast packets. Should theoretically allow to use  UDPCast
           beyond the local network, but not tested for lack of a multicast router.

       --mcast-rdv-address <u>address</u>
           Uses  a non-standard multicast address for the control (rendez-vous) connection. This address is used
           by the sender and receivers to "find" each other. This is <b>not</b> the address that is  used  to  transfer
           the actual data.

           By  default  "mcast-rdv-address"  is  the  Ethernet  broadcast  address  if "ttl" is 1, and 224.0.0.1
           otherwise. This setting should not be used except in very special situations, such as when  224.0.0.1
           cannot be used for policy reasons.

       The following networking options should be supplied only on the sender:

       --mcast-data-address <u>address</u>
           Uses  the  given  address for multicasting the data. If not specified, the program will automatically
           derive a multicast address from its own IP (by keeping the last 27 bits of the IP and then prepending
           232).

       --pointopoint
           Point-to-point mode. Only a single receiver is allowed, but the data will be directly  send  to  this
           receiver  (in  unicast mode), rather than multicast/broadcast all over the place. If no async mode is
           chosen, and there happens to be only one receiver, point-to-point is activated automatically.

       --nopointopoint
           Don't use point-to-point, even if there is only one single receiver.

       --full-duplex
           Use this option if you use a full-duplex network. T-base-10 or 100 is full duplex if equipped with  a
           switch.  Hub based networks, or T-base-2 networks (coaxial cable) are only <b>half-duplex</b> and you should
           not use this option with these networks, or else you may experience a 10% performance hit.

           N.B. On  high-latency  WAN  links,  the  full-duplex  option  can  lead  to  substantial  performance
           improvements,  because  it  allows  udp-sender  to  send  more data while it is still waiting for the
           previous batch to get acknowledged.

       --half-duplex
           Use half duplex mode (needed for Hub based or T-base-2 networks). This is  the  default  behavior  in
           this version of udpcast.

       --broadcast
           Use  Ethernet broadcast, rather than multicast. Useful if you have Ethernet cards which don't support
           multicast.

           By default, "udpcast" uses multicast. This allows sending the  data  only  to  those  receivers  that
           requested  it.  Ethernet  cards of machines which <u>don't</u> participate in the transmission automatically
           block out the packets at the hardware level. Moreover,  network  switches  are  able  to  selectively
           transmit the packets only to those network ports to which receivers are connected. Both features thus
           allow  a  much  more  efficient  operation than broadcast. This option should only be supplied on the
           sender.

       -b blocksize
           Choses the packet size. Default (and also maximum) is 1456.

   <b>Unidirectional</b> <b>mode</b> <b>(without</b> <b>return</b> <b>channel)</b>
       The options described below are useful in situations where no "return channel"  is  available,  or  where
       such  a  channel  is  impractical  due  to  high latency. In an unidirectional setup (i.e. without return
       channel), the sender only sends data but doesn't expect any reply from the receiver.

       Unidirectional options must be used together, or else the transfer will not work correctly. You  may  for
       example use the following command line:

       "udp-sender --async --max-bitrate 10m --fec 8x8"

       --async
           Asynchronous  mode.  Do  not request confirmations from the receiver. Best used together with forward
           error correction and bandwidth limitation, or else the receiver will abort the reception as  soon  as
           it  misses  a  packet.  When the receiver aborts the reception in such a way, it will print a list of
           packets lost in the slice causing the problem. You can use  this  list  to  tune  the  forward  error
           correction parameters.

       --max-bitrate <u>bitrate</u>
           Limits  bandwidth  used by udpcast. Useful in asynchronous mode, or else the sender may send too fast
           for the switch and/or receiver to keep up. Bitrate may be expressed in  bits  per  second  (--bitrate
           5000000),  kilobits  per  second ("--bitrate 5000k") or megabits per second ("--bitrate 5m"). This is
           the raw bitrate, including packet headers, forward error  correction,  retransmissions,  etc.  Actual
           payload bitrate will be lower.

       --fec <u>interleave"x"redundancy"/"stripesize</u>
           Enables forward error correction. The goal of forward error correction is to transmit redundant data,
           in  order  to make up for packets lost in transit. Indeed, in unidirectional mode, the receivers have
           no way of requesting retransmission of lost packets, thus the only way to address packet loss  is  to
           include  redundant  information  to  begin  with.  The  algorithm is designed in such a way that if <u>r</u>
           redundant packets are transmitted, that those can be used to compensate for the loss of <u>any</u> r packets
           in the same FEC group (stripe).

           In order to increase robustness of the FEC algorithm against  burst  packet  losses,  each  <u>slice</u>  is
           divided  in  <u>interleave</u>  stripes.  Each stripe has <u>stripesize</u> blocks (if not specified, stripesize is
           calculated by diving <u>slice-size</u> by <u>interleave</u>). For each stripe, <u>redundancy</u> FEC  packets  are  added.
           Stripes  are  organized  in such a fashion that consecutive packets belong to different stripes. This
           way, we ensure that burst losses affect different stripes, rather than using all  FEC  packets  of  a
           single stripe. Example: "--fec 8x8/128"

       --rate-governor <u>module.so:key1=value1,key2=value2</u>
           Applies  a dynamically loadable rate governor. <u>module.so</u> is the name of the preloadable module, which
           is followed by a number of  property  assignments  (<u>key1=value1</u>).  The  rate  governor  controls  the
           transmission  rate  according  to  various  criteria,  such as congestion information received from a
           routing or encapsulating device. See comments in "/usr/include/udpcast/rateGovernor.h" and example in
           "examples/rateGovernor" for more details

       --rexmit-hello-interval <u>timeout</u>
           If set, rebroadcasts the HELLO packet used for initiating the casting each <u>timeout</u> milliseconds.

           This option is useful together with <u>asyc</u> <u>mode</u>, because with async mode  the  receiver  won't  send  a
           connection  request  to  the  sender  (and  hence  won't  get a connection reply). In <u>async</u> <u>mode</u>, the
           receivers get all needed information from  the  <u>hello</u>  packet  instead,  and  are  thus  particularly
           dependent on the reception of this packet, making retransmission useful.

           This  option  is  also  useful  on  networks  where  packet loss is so high that even with connection
           requests, sender and receiver would not find each other otherwise.

       --retries-until-drop <u>retries</u>
           How many time to send a REQACK until dropping a receiver. Lower retrycounts make "udp-sender"  faster
           to  react  to  crashed  receivers,  but  they also increase the probability of false alerts (dropping
           receivers that are not actually crashed, but merely slow to respond for whatever reason)

       --streaming
           Allows receivers to join an ongoing transmission mid through

   <b>Keyboardless</b> <b>mode</b>
       The options below help to run a sender in unattended mode.

       --min-receivers <u>n</u>
           Automatically start as soon as a minimal number of receivers have connected.

       --min-wait <u>t</u>
           Even when the necessary amount of receivers <u>do</u> have connected, still wait until <u>t</u> seconds since first
           receiver connection have passed.

       --max-wait <u>t</u>
           When not enough receivers have connected (but at least one), start anyways when <u>t</u> seconds since first
           receiver connection have passed.

       --nokbd
           Do not read start signal from keyboard, and do not display any message telling the user to press  any
           key to start.

       --start-timeout <u>sec</u>
           sender  aborts  at  start  if  it  doesn't  see  a  receiver  within  this many seconds. Furthermore,
           transmission of data needs to start within this delay. Once transmission is started, the  timeout  no
           longer applies.

       --daemon-mode
           Do  not  exit  when  done,  but instead wait for the next batch of receivers. If this option is given
           twice, udp-sender puts itself into the background, closes its standard file descriptors, and acts  as
           a real daemon.

       --pid-file <u>file</u>
           Allow  to  specify  a pid file. If given together with "--daemon-mode", udp-sender will write its pid
           into this file. If given together with "--kill", the process with the given pid will be killed.

       --kill
           Shuts down the udp-sender identified by the pid file (which also must be specified).  Kill  does  not
           interrupt an ongoing transmission, but instead waits until it is finished.

       Example:

       "udp-sender -f zozo --min-receivers 5 --min-wait 20 --max-wait 80"

       •   If  one  receiver  connects  at 18h00.00, and 4 more within the next 5 minutes, start at 18h00.20. (5
           receivers connected, but min-wait not yet passed)

       •   If one receiver connects at 18h00.00, and 3 more within the next  5  minutes,  then  a  last  one  at
           18h00.25, start right after.

       •   If  one  receiver connects at 18h00.00, then 3 more within the next 15 minutes, then no one, start at
           18h01.20. (not enough receivers, but we start anyways after max-wait).

   <b>Logging</b> <b>and</b> <b>statistics</b> <b>options</b>
       The options instruct "udp-sender" to log some additional statistics to a file:

       --stat-period <u>seconds</u>
           Every so much milliseconds, print some statistics to stderr: how much bytes sent so far log, position
           in uncompressed file (if applicable), retransmit count... By default,  this  is  printed  every  half
           second.

       --print-uncompressed-position <u>flag</u>
           By  default,  udp-sender  only prints the position in uncompressed file if the 2 following conditions
           are met:

           •   Input is piped via a compressor ("-p " option).

           •   The primary input is seekable (file or device)

           With the "--print-uncompressed-position", options, you can change this behavior:

           •   If flag is 0, uncompressed position will <b>never</b> be printed, even if above conditions are met

           •   If flag is 1, uncompressed position will <b>always</b> be printed, even if above conditions are <b>not</b> met

       --log <u>file</u>
           Logs some stuff into <u>file</u>.

       --no-progress
           Do not display progress statistics.

       --bw-period <u>seconds</u>
           Every so much seconds, log instantenous bandwidth seen during that period. Note:  this  is  different
           from  the  bandwidth  displayed  to  stderr  of  the  receiver,  which  is the average since start of
           transmission.

   <b>Tuning</b> <b>options</b> <b>(sender)</b>
       The following tuning options are all about slice size. Udpcast groups its data in  <u>slices</u>,  which  are  a
       series of blocks (UDP packets). These groups are relevant for

       •   data  retransmission:  after each slice, the server asks the receivers whether they have received all
           blocks, and if needed retransmits what has been missing

       •   forward error correction: each slice has its set of data blocks, and matching FEC blocks.

       --min-slice-size <u>size</u>
           minimum slice size (expressed in blocks). Default is 16. When dynamically adjusting slice size  (only
           in non-duplex mode), never use smaller slices than this. Ignored in duplex mode (default).

       --max-slice-size <u>size</u>
           maximum  slice  size  (expressed  in  blocks). Default is 1024. When dynamically adjusting slice size
           (only in non-duplex mode), never use larger slices than this. Ignored in duplex mode (default).

       --default-slice-size <u>size</u>
           Slice size used (starting slice size in half-duplex mode).

       --rehello-offset <u>offs</u>
           in streaming mode, how many packets before end of slice the hello packet will be transferred (default
           50). Chose larger values if you notice that  receivers  are  excessively  slow  to  pick  up  running
           transmission

   <b>Tuning</b> <b>the</b> <b>forward</b> <b>error</b> <b>correction</b>
       There are three parameters on which to act:

       redundancy
           This  influences  how  much  extra  packets  are  included  per  stripe. The higher this is, the more
           redundancy there is, which means that the transmission becomes more robust against loss. However, CPU
           time necessary is also proportional to redundancy (a factor to consider on slow PC's), and of course,
           a higher redundancy augments the amount of data to be transmitted.

       interleave
           This influences among how many stripes the data is divided.  Higher  interleave  improves  robustness
           against  burst  loss  (for  example,  64 packets in a row...). It doesn't increase robustness against
           randomly spread packet loss. <b>Note</b>: interleave bigger than 8 will force a smaller stripesize,  due  to
           the fact that slicesize is limited to 1024.

       stripesize
           How  many data blocks there are in a stripe. Due to the algorithm used, this cannot be more than 128.
           Reducing stripe size is an indirect way of augmenting (relative) redundancy,  without  incurring  the
           CPU  penalty  of  larger  (absolute)  redundancy.  However,  a  larger  absolute  redundancy is still
           preferable over a smaller stripesize, because it improves robustness against  clustered  losses.  For
           instance,  if  8/128  is  preferable  over  4/64, because with 8/128 the 8 FEC packets can be used to
           compensate for the loss of any of the 128 data packets, whereas  with  4/64,  each  group  of  4  FEC
           packets  can only be used against its own set of 64 data packets. If for instance the first 8 packets
           were lost, they would be recoverable with 8/128, but not with 4/64.

       Considering these, change parameters as follows:

       •   If you observe long stretches of lost packets, increase interleave

       •   If you observe that transfer is slowed down by CPU saturation,  decrease  redundancy  and  stripesize
           proportionnally.

       •   If   you   observe   big   <u>variations</u>  in  packet  loss  rate,  increase  redundancy  and  stripesize
           proportionnally.

       •   If you just observe high loss, but not necessarily clustered in any special way, increase  redundancy
           or decrease stripesize

       •   Be  aware that network equipment or the receiver may be dropping packets because of a bandwidth which
           is too high. Try limiting it using "max-bitrate"

       •   The receiver may also be dropping packets because it cannot write the data to disk fast  enough.  Use
           hdparm   to   optimize   disk   access   on   the   receiver.   Try  playing  with  the  settings  in
           "<a href="file:/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default">/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_default</a>" and "<a href="file:/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max">/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max</a>", i.e. setting them  to  a  higher
           value.
