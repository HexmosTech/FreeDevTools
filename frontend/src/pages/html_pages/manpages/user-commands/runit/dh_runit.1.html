</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dh_runit - install/enable runit runscripts

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_runit</b> [<u>debhelper</u> <u>options</u>] [<u>path</u> <u>options</u>] ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dh_runit</b> is a debhelper program that is responsible for installing and enabling <u>runit</u> runscripts. If a
       file named <u>debian/package.runit</u> exists, then it ensures appropriate actions are performed based on its
       content.

       For runit, each unit of supervision (or, simply speaking, program) is represented by a directory under
       <u>/etc/sv</u>, containing at least a <u>run</u> executable file. Each enabled unit of supervision is represented by a
       symbolic link under <u><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></u> (which itself is a symbolic link to <u>/etc/runit/runsvdir/default</u>)
       pointing to some directory under <u>/etc/sv</u>.

       <b>dh_runit</b> reads arguments from the command line and <u>debian/package.runit</u> in pairs, with the first item
       being the path to a file or directory and the second being a set of options.  If the first argument names
       a file, it is treated as a 'run' script to be installed at <u>/etc/sv/*<a href="file:/run">/run</a></u> as an executable file. If the
       first argument names a directory, that directory is copied as a whole to <u>/etc/sv</u>.

       Options are comma separated, like mount options. Unrecognized options are errors. The following options
       are recognized:

       <u>disable</u>
           Install  the  runscript  but  do not enable it by default.  This means that the corresponding service
           will not be started.  The service can be  enabled  by  the  system  administrator  manually  or  with
           <b><a href="../man8/update-service.8.html">update-service</a></b>(8).

       <u>name</u>=preferred-name
           By default, the name of the directory under <u>/etc/sv</u> for a given runscript is the basename of the path
           argument  naming  it.  This option allows overriding that default with an explicitly chosen directory
           name.

       <u>logscript</u>
           Install a standard <u>log/run</u> script that invokes <b><a href="../man8/svlogd.8.html">svlogd</a></b>(8) with  the  rights  of  the  dedicated  user.
           Specifying this option produces an error if the path argument names a directory that already contains
           a <u>/log/run</u> script.

       <u>onupgrade</u>=string
           This  option controls the debhelper action performed during the upgrade of the service, when runit is
           PID 1, and it takes one of the following strings as argument:

           <u>restart</u>
            restart the service in postinstall, after all files of the package are
            unpacked and the upgrade is complete. This is the same as dh_installinit
            or dh_installsystemd ' --restart-after-upgrade '.
            This is the implicit default if the 'onupgrade' option is not set.

           <u>stop</u>
            stop the service in prerm and start again in postinst. This option is useful
            if the daemon get confused by the package being upgraded while it's still
            running. This is the same as dh_installinit or dh_installsystemd
            '--no-restart-after-upgrade'.

           <u>nostop</u>
            do not stop service on upgrade. This has the side-effect of not restarting the
            service as a part of the upgrade. Use this option when the service does not
            support being restarted while it's running. Display managers (xdm, slim, ...)
            are example of non-restartible services.
            When this option is set the <b>invoke-run</b> interpreter, provided by <u>runit</u>
            package, will refrain from automatically replace the sysvinit-managed
            instance of the service with a runit-managed instance (replacement requires manual
            intervention or a system restart).
            This is the same as dh_installinit or dh_installsystemd '--no-stop-on-upgrade'.

           <u>reload</u>
            similar to nostop, but the service configuration is reloaded (HUP) during the upgrade.
            This might be useful in cases (like dbus) where the service does not support restarting
            on upgrade and where reloading the config instead of restarting makes sense.
            When this option is set the <b>invoke-run</b> interpreter, provided by <u>runit</u>
            package, will refrain to automatically replace the sysvinit-managed
            instance of the service with a runit-managed instance (replacement requires manual
            intervention or a system restart).

           The <u>onupgrade</u> option does not control whether the service will be started after the first install  of
           the  package;  by default the service is always started if it's enabled (and stopped before removal).
           To not start the service after the first install you should use the 'disable'  option.   The  upgrade
           action usually happens in postinst, however if the bin option is used, the action is performed at the
           end of the upgrade process, with a noawait trigger on runit's package side.

       <u>noscripts</u>
           With  this option dh-runit will not add its snippets to maintscripts; actions like enable or disable,
           start, stop, restart and purge the service need manual editing of maintaner scripts.

       <u>usr</u> With this option dh-runit will install the service directory under  /usr/share/runit/sv/  instead  of
           the  default  /etc/sv/.  It must be used together with the 'bin' option or dh-runit will exit with an
           error. This option is experimental, is mainly intended for a  catch-all  runscript  package  and  may
           produce a buggy package (that fails the piuparts purge test).

       <u>finish</u>
           Install a standard finish file with the service; if there is already a finish file inside the service
           directory, this option does nothing.

       <u>bin</u>=/full/path/to/bin
           The  full path to the binary that is exec'd in the runscript should be provided.  When this option is
           used, additional metafiles are written inside the service directory so  that  postinstall  and  prerm
           actions  that  are  usually performed inside maintainer scripts are performed with a trigger on runit
           package side.  When this option is used, only the postrm snippet that handles purge action is written
           while postinst and prerm snippets are skipped.  Additionally, all instances (if any) of '##bin##'  in
           the  runscript  are  automatically  replaced with the path provided with this option; this is done so
           that the path of the bin can be maintained only in the control file.  This option is experimental.

       <u>presubj</u>
           Include presubj file for reportbug into generate  package.  This  file  contains  note  that  suggest
           including  runit  maintainers  into copy of bug reports, related to runit integration. If the package
           already include it's own presubj file, that file takes precedence over runit presubj file.  This  may
           make life of package maintainer who uses another init system easier.

       <u>defaults</u>
           If you don't need other options, specify this one.

       <u>since</u>
           Since  dh-runit  2.8.15  this  option  is no longer needed and is deprecated.  It's retained only for
           backward compatibility with packages that still use it (see #942323). It's scheduled for removal with
           3.0 release.

       <u>noreplace</u>
           Since dh-runit 2.9.0 this option is deprecated and it's retained only for backward compatibility  and
           it's scheduled for removal with 3.0 release.  You can use onupgrade=nostop instead.

       <u>nofinish</u>
           This option is deprecated, does nothing and it's scheduled for removal with 3.0 release.

</pre><h4><b>SUBSTITUTION</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Packages  using  <b>dh_runit</b>  do  not  depend on <b>runit</b> but should include the <u>runit:Breaks</u> variable in their
       <u>Breaks</u> field in <u>debian/control</u> to ensure that no breakages are caused  by  a  too-old  version  of  <b>runit</b>
       package.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This section contains several example <u>package.runit</u> snippets.

         # In this case, a file is installed as a 'run' script. The directory
         # name under /etc/sv is derived from the file's basename (/etc/sv/script).
         path/to/file/to/be/installed/as/run/script defaults

         # Similar, but installs a directory as a whole. It is the package's
         # responsibility to ensure this directory contains everything required.
         path/to/directory defaults

         # Similar, but without creating a symlink under /etc/service.
         path/to/directory disable

         # Explicitly specifying a name to use for the directory under /etc/sv.
         # A standard log/run script will be created.
         path/to/directory name=my-preferred-name,logscript
