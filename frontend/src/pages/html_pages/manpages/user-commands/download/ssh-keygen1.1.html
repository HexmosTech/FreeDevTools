</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ssh-keygen</b> generates, manages and converts authentication keys for <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1).  <b>ssh-keygen</b>  can  create  keys
       for  use  by SSH protocol versions 1 and 2.  Protocol 1 should not be used and is only offered to support
       legacy devices.  It suffers from a number of cryptographic weaknesses and doesn't  support  many  of  the
       advanced features available for protocol 2.

       The  type  of  key  to  be  generated is specified with the <b>-t</b> option.  If invoked without any arguments,
       <b>ssh-keygen</b> will generate an RSA key for use in SSH protocol 2 connections.

       <b>ssh-keygen</b> is also used to generate groups for use in Diffie-Hellman group exchange  (DH-GEX).   See  the
       “MODULI GENERATION” section for details.

       Finally,  <b>ssh-keygen</b>  can  be used to generate and update Key Revocation Lists, and to test whether given
       keys have been revoked by one.  See the “KEY REVOCATION LISTS” section for details.

       Normally each user wishing to use SSH with public  key  authentication  runs  this  once  to  create  the
       authentication   key   in   <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/identity">~/.ssh/identity</a></u>,   <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_dsa">~/.ssh/id_dsa</a></u>,   <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ecdsa">~/.ssh/id_ecdsa</a></u>,   <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ed25519">~/.ssh/id_ed25519</a></u>   or
       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_rsa">~/.ssh/id_rsa</a></u>.  Additionally, the system administrator may use this to generate host keys.

       Normally this program generates the key and asks for a file in which  to  store  the  private  key.   The
       public  key  is  stored  in  a  file with the same name but “.pub” appended.  The program also asks for a
       passphrase.  The passphrase may be empty to  indicate  no  passphrase  (host  keys  must  have  an  empty
       passphrase), or it may be a string of arbitrary length.  A passphrase is similar to a password, except it
       can be a phrase with a series of words, punctuation, numbers, whitespace, or any string of characters you
       want.  Good passphrases are 10-30 characters long, are not simple sentences or otherwise easily guessable
       (English  prose  has  only  1-2  bits  of  entropy per character, and provides very bad passphrases), and
       contain a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters.   The  passphrase
       can be changed later by using the <b>-p</b> option.

       There  is no way to recover a lost passphrase.  If the passphrase is lost or forgotten, a new key must be
       generated and the corresponding public key copied to other machines.

       For RSA1 keys and keys stored in the newer OpenSSH format, there is also a comment field in the key  file
       that  is only for convenience to the user to help identify the key.  The comment can tell what the key is
       for, or whatever is useful.  The comment is initialized to “user@host” when the key is created,  but  can
       be changed using the <b>-c</b> option.

       After a key is generated, instructions below detail where the keys should be placed to be activated.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-A</b>      For  each  of the key types (rsa1, rsa, dsa, ecdsa and ed25519) for which host keys do not exist,
               generate the host keys with the default key file path, an empty passphrase, default bits for  the
               key  type,  and  default  comment.  This is used by system administration scripts to generate new
               host keys.

       <b>-a</b> <u>rounds</u>
               When saving a new-format private key (i.e. an ed25519 key or any SSH protocol 2 key when  the  <b>-o</b>
               flag  is  set),  this  option  specifies the number of KDF (key derivation function) rounds used.
               Higher numbers result in slower passphrase verification and increased resistance  to  brute-force
               password cracking (should the keys be stolen).

               When  screening  DH-GEX  candidates ( using the <b>-T</b> command).  This option specifies the number of
               primality tests to perform.

       <b>-B</b>      Show the bubblebabble digest of specified private or public key file.

       <b>-b</b> <u>bits</u>
               Specifies the number of bits in the key to create.  For RSA keys, the minimum size is  1024  bits
               and  the  default is 2048 bits.  Generally, 2048 bits is considered sufficient.  DSA keys must be
               exactly 1024 bits as specified by FIPS 186-2.  For ECDSA keys, the <b>-b</b>  flag  determines  the  key
               length  by selecting from one of three elliptic curve sizes: 256, 384 or 521 bits.  Attempting to
               use bit lengths other than these three values for ECDSA keys will  fail.   Ed25519  keys  have  a
               fixed length and the <b>-b</b> flag will be ignored.

       <b>-C</b> <u>comment</u>
               Provides a new comment.

       <b>-c</b>      Requests  changing  the  comment  in  the  private  and public key files.  This operation is only
               supported for RSA1 keys and keys stored in the newer OpenSSH format.  The program will prompt for
               the file containing the private keys, for the passphrase if the key has  one,  and  for  the  new
               comment.

       <b>-D</b> <u>pkcs11</u>
               Download  the  RSA  public  keys  provided  by  the  PKCS#11 shared library <u>pkcs11</u>.  When used in
               combination with <b>-s</b>, this option indicates that a CA key resides in  a  PKCS#11  token  (see  the
               “CERTIFICATES” section for details).

       <b>-E</b> <u>fingerprint_hash</u>
               Specifies the hash algorithm used when displaying key fingerprints.  Valid options are: “md5” and
               “sha256”.  The default is “sha256”.

       <b>-e</b>      This  option will read a private or public OpenSSH key file and print to stdout the key in one of
               the formats specified by the <b>-m</b> option.  The default export format  is  “RFC4716”.   This  option
               allows  exporting  OpenSSH  keys  for  use  by  other  programs, including several commercial SSH
               implementations.

       <b>-F</b> <u>hostname</u>
               Search for the specified <u>hostname</u> in a <u>known_hosts</u> file, listing  any  occurrences  found.   This
               option  is useful to find hashed host names or addresses and may also be used in conjunction with
               the <b>-H</b> option to print found keys in a hashed format.

       <b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>
               Specifies the filename of the key file.

       <b>-G</b> <u>output_file</u>
               Generate candidate primes for DH-GEX.  These primes must be screened for  safety  (using  the  <b>-T</b>
               option) before use.

       <b>-g</b>      Use generic DNS format when printing fingerprint resource records using the <b>-r</b> command.

       <b>-H</b>      Hash  a  <u>known_hosts</u> file.  This replaces all hostnames and addresses with hashed representations
               within the specified file; the original content is moved to a file with  a  .old  suffix.   These
               hashes  may  be  used  normally  by  <b>ssh</b> and <b>sshd</b>, but they do not reveal identifying information
               should the file's contents be disclosed.  This option will not modify existing  hashed  hostnames
               and is therefore safe to use on files that mix hashed and non-hashed names.

       <b>-h</b>      When  signing  a  key,  create  a host certificate instead of a user certificate.  Please see the
               “CERTIFICATES” section for details.

       <b>-I</b> <u>certificate_identity</u>
               Specify the key identity when signing a public key.  Please see the  “CERTIFICATES”  section  for
               details.

       <b>-i</b>      This  option will read an unencrypted private (or public) key file in the format specified by the
               <b>-m</b> option and print an OpenSSH compatible private (or public) key to stdout.  This option  allows
               importing  keys  from  other  software,  including  several  commercial SSH implementations.  The
               default import format is “RFC4716”.

       <b>-J</b> <u>num_lines</u>
               Exit after screening the specified number of lines while performing DH candidate screening  using
               the <b>-T</b> option.

       <b>-j</b> <u>start_line</u>
               Start screening at the specified line number while performing DH candidate screening using the <b>-T</b>
               option.

       <b>-K</b> <u>checkpt</u>
               Write  the  last line processed to the file <u>checkpt</u> while performing DH candidate screening using
               the <b>-T</b> option.  This will be used to skip  lines  in  the  input  file  that  have  already  been
               processed if the job is restarted.

       <b>-k</b>      Generate a KRL file.  In this mode, <b>ssh-keygen</b> will generate a KRL file at the location specified
               via  the  <b>-f</b>  flag  that  revokes  every  key  or  certificate  presented  on  the  command line.
               Keys/certificates to be revoked may be specified by public key file or using the format described
               in the “KEY REVOCATION LISTS” section.

       <b>-L</b>      Prints the contents of one or more certificates.

       <b>-l</b>      Show fingerprint of specified public key file.  Private RSA1 keys are also  supported.   For  RSA
               and  DSA  keys  <b>ssh-keygen</b> tries to find the matching public key file and prints its fingerprint.
               If combined with <b>-v</b>, a  visual  ASCII  art  representation  of  the  key  is  supplied  with  the
               fingerprint.

       <b>-M</b> <u>memory</u>
               Specify the amount of memory to use (in megabytes) when generating candidate moduli for DH-GEX.

       <b>-m</b> <u>key_format</u>
               Specify  a  key  format for the <b>-i</b> (import) or <b>-e</b> (export) conversion options.  The supported key
               formats are: “RFC4716” (RFC 4716/SSH2 public or private key), “PKCS8” (PEM PKCS8 public  key)  or
               “PEM” (PEM public key).  The default conversion format is “RFC4716”.

       <b>-N</b> <u>new_passphrase</u>
               Provides the new passphrase.

       <b>-n</b> <u>principals</u>
               Specify  one or more principals (user or host names) to be included in a certificate when signing
               a key.  Multiple principals may be specified, separated by commas.  Please see the “CERTIFICATES”
               section for details.

       <b>-O</b> <u>option</u>
               Specify a certificate option when signing a key.  This option may be  specified  multiple  times.
               Please  see  the  “CERTIFICATES”  section  for  details.   The  options  that  are valid for user
               certificates are:

               <b>clear</b>   Clear all  enabled  permissions.   This  is  useful  for  clearing  the  default  set  of
                       permissions so permissions may be added individually.

               <b>force-command</b>=<u>command</u>
                       Forces  the  execution  of  <u>command</u> instead of any shell or command specified by the user
                       when the certificate is used for authentication.

               <b>no-agent-forwarding</b>
                       Disable <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1) forwarding (permitted by default).

               <b>no-port-forwarding</b>
                       Disable port forwarding (permitted by default).

               <b>no-pty</b>  Disable PTY allocation (permitted by default).

               <b>no-user-rc</b>
                       Disable execution of <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/rc">~/.ssh/rc</a></u> by <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) (permitted by default).

               <b>no-x11-forwarding</b>
                       Disable X11 forwarding (permitted by default).

               <b>permit-agent-forwarding</b>
                       Allows <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1) forwarding.

               <b>permit-port-forwarding</b>
                       Allows port forwarding.

               <b>permit-pty</b>
                       Allows PTY allocation.

               <b>permit-user-rc</b>
                       Allows execution of <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/rc">~/.ssh/rc</a></u> by <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8).

               <b>permit-x11-forwarding</b>
                       Allows X11 forwarding.

               <b>source-address</b>=<u>address_list</u>
                       Restrict the source addresses from  which  the  certificate  is  considered  valid.   The
                       <u>address_list</u>  is  a  comma-separated  list  of  one or more address/netmask pairs in CIDR
                       format.

               At present, no options are valid for host keys.

       <b>-o</b>      Causes <b>ssh-keygen</b> to save private keys  using  the  new  OpenSSH  format  rather  than  the  more
               compatible  PEM format.  The new format has increased resistance to brute-force password cracking
               but is not supported by versions of OpenSSH prior to  6.5.   Ed25519  keys  always  use  the  new
               private key format.

       <b>-P</b> <u>passphrase</u>
               Provides the (old) passphrase.

       <b>-p</b>      Requests  changing  the  passphrase  of a private key file instead of creating a new private key.
               The program will prompt for the file containing the private key,  for  the  old  passphrase,  and
               twice for the new passphrase.

       <b>-Q</b>      Test whether keys have been revoked in a KRL.

       <b>-q</b>      Silence <b>ssh-keygen</b>.

       <b>-R</b> <u>hostname</u>
               Removes  all keys belonging to <u>hostname</u> from a <u>known_hosts</u> file.  This option is useful to delete
               hashed hosts (see the <b>-H</b> option above).

       <b>-r</b> <u>hostname</u>
               Print the SSHFP fingerprint resource record named <u>hostname</u> for the specified public key file.

       <b>-S</b> <u>start</u>
               Specify start point (in hex) when generating candidate moduli for DH-GEX.

       <b>-s</b> <u>ca_key</u>
               Certify (sign) a public key using the specified CA key.  Please see  the  “CERTIFICATES”  section
               for details.

               When  generating  a  KRL, <b>-s</b> specifies a path to a CA public key file used to revoke certificates
               directly by key ID or serial number.  See the “KEY REVOCATION LISTS” section for details.

       <b>-T</b> <u>output_file</u>
               Test DH group exchange candidate primes (generated using the <b>-G</b> option) for safety.

       <b>-t</b> <b>dsa</b> | <b>ecdsa</b> | <b>ed25519</b> | <b>rsa</b> | <b>rsa1</b>
               Specifies the type of key to create.  The possible values are “rsa1” for protocol version  1  and
               “dsa”, “ecdsa”, “ed25519”, or “rsa” for protocol version 2.

       <b>-u</b>      Update a KRL.  When specified with <b>-k</b>, keys listed via the command line are added to the existing
               KRL rather than a new KRL being created.

       <b>-V</b> <u>validity_interval</u>
               Specify  a  validity  interval  when signing a certificate.  A validity interval may consist of a
               single time, indicating that the certificate is valid beginning now and expiring at that time, or
               may consist of two times separated by a colon to indicate an explicit time interval.   The  start
               time may be specified as a date in YYYYMMDD format, a time in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS format or a relative
               time  (to  the current time) consisting of a minus sign followed by a relative time in the format
               described in the TIME FORMATS section of <u><a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html">sshd_config</a></u>(5).  The end time  may  be  specified  as  a
               YYYYMMDD date, a YYYYMMDDHHMMSS time or a relative time starting with a plus character.

               For  example:  “+52w1d”  (valid from now to 52 weeks and one day from now), “-4w:+4w” (valid from

       <b>-v</b>      Verbose mode.  Causes <b>ssh-keygen</b> to print debugging messages about its progress.  This is helpful
               for debugging moduli generation.  Multiple <b>-v</b> options increase the verbosity.  The maximum is 3.

       <b>-W</b> <u>generator</u>
               Specify desired generator when testing candidate moduli for DH-GEX.

       <b>-y</b>      This option will read a private OpenSSH format file and print an OpenSSH public key to stdout.

       <b>-z</b> <u>serial_number</u>
               Specifies a serial number to be embedded in the certificate to distinguish this certificate  from
               others from the same CA.  The default serial number is zero.

               When generating a KRL, the <b>-z</b> flag is used to specify a KRL version number.

</pre><h4><b>MODULI</b> <b>GENERATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ssh-keygen</b>  may  be  used  to  generate  groups  for the Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange (DH-GEX) protocol.
       Generating these groups is a two-step process: first, candidate primes are generated using  a  fast,  but
       memory  intensive  process.   These  candidate  primes  are  then tested for suitability (a CPU-intensive
       process).

       Generation of primes is performed using the <b>-G</b> option.  The desired length of the primes may be specified
       by the <b>-b</b> option.  For example:

             <b>#</b> <b>ssh-keygen</b> <b>-G</b> <b>moduli-2048.candidates</b> <b>-b</b> <b>2048</b>

       By default, the search for primes begins at a random point in the desired  length  range.   This  may  be
       overridden using the <b>-S</b> option, which specifies a different start point (in hex).

       Once  a  set  of  candidates  have  been  generated,  they must be screened for suitability.  This may be
       performed using the <b>-T</b> option.  In this mode <b>ssh-keygen</b> will read candidates from standard  input  (or  a
       file specified using the <b>-f</b> option).  For example:

             <b>#</b> <b>ssh-keygen</b> <b>-T</b> <b>moduli-2048</b> <b>-f</b> <b>moduli-2048.candidates</b>

       By default, each candidate will be subjected to 100 primality tests.  This may be overridden using the <b>-a</b>
       option.   The  DH  generator  value will be chosen automatically for the prime under consideration.  If a
       specific generator is desired, it may be requested using the <b>-W</b> option.  Valid generator values are 2, 3,
       and 5.

       Screened DH groups may be installed in <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/moduli">/etc/ssh/moduli</a></u>.  It is important that this file  contains  moduli
       of a range of bit lengths and that both ends of a connection share common moduli.

</pre><h4><b>CERTIFICATES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ssh-keygen</b>  supports  signing  of  keys  to  produce  certificates  that  may  be  used  for user or host
       authentication.  Certificates consist of a public key, some identity information, zero or more  principal
       (user or host) names and a set of options that are signed by a Certification Authority (CA) key.  Clients
       or  servers may then trust only the CA key and verify its signature on a certificate rather than trusting
       many user/host keys.  Note that OpenSSH certificates are a different, and much  simpler,  format  to  the
       X.509 certificates used in <u><a href="../man8/ssl.8.html">ssl</a></u>(8).

       <b>ssh-keygen</b>  supports  two  types of certificates: user and host.  User certificates authenticate users to
       servers, whereas host certificates authenticate server hosts to users.  To generate a user certificate:

             <b>$</b> <b>ssh-keygen</b> <b>-s</b> <b>/path/to/ca_key</b> <b>-I</b> <b>key_id</b> <b>/path/to/user_key.pub</b>

       The resultant certificate will be placed in <u>/path/to/user_key-cert.pub</u>.  A host certificate requires  the
       <b>-h</b> option:

             <b>$</b> <b>ssh-keygen</b> <b>-s</b> <b>/path/to/ca_key</b> <b>-I</b> <b>key_id</b> <b>-h</b> <b>/path/to/host_key.pub</b>

       The host certificate will be output to <u>/path/to/host_key-cert.pub</u>.

       It  is  possible to sign using a CA key stored in a PKCS#11 token by providing the token library using <b>-D</b>
       and identifying the CA key by providing its public half as an argument to <b>-s</b>:

             <b>$</b> <b>ssh-keygen</b> <b>-s</b> <b>ca_key.pub</b> <b>-D</b> <b>libpkcs11.so</b> <b>-I</b> <b>key_id</b> <b>user_key.pub</b>

       In all cases, <u>key_id</u> is a "key identifier" that is logged by the server when the certificate is used  for
       authentication.

       Certificates  may be limited to be valid for a set of principal (user/host) names.  By default, generated
       certificates are valid for all users or hosts.   To  generate  a  certificate  for  a  specified  set  of
       principals:

             <b>$</b> <b>ssh-keygen</b> <b>-s</b> <b>ca_key</b> <b>-I</b> <b>key_id</b> <b>-n</b> <b>user1,user2</b> <b>user_key.pub</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>ssh-keygen</b> <b>-s</b> <b>ca_key</b> <b>-I</b> <b>key_id</b> <b>-h</b> <b>-n</b> <b>host.domain</b> <b>host_key.pub</b>

       Additional  limitations on the validity and use of user certificates may be specified through certificate
       options.  A certificate option may disable features of the SSH session, may be valid only when  presented
       from  particular  source  addresses  or  may  force  the  use of a specific command.  For a list of valid
       certificate options, see the documentation for the <b>-O</b> option above.

       Finally, certificates may be defined with a validity lifetime.  The <b>-V</b>  option  allows  specification  of
       certificate  start  and end times.  A certificate that is presented at a time outside this range will not
       be considered valid.  By default, certificates are valid from Unix Epoch to the distant future.

       For certificates to be used for user or host authentication, the CA public key must be trusted by <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8)
       or <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1).  Please refer to those manual pages for details.

</pre><h4><b>KEY</b> <b>REVOCATION</b> <b>LISTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ssh-keygen</b> is able to manage OpenSSH format Key Revocation Lists (KRLs).  These binary files specify keys
       or certificates to be revoked using a compact format, taking as little as one bit per certificate if they
       are being revoked by serial number.

       KRLs may be generated using the <b>-k</b> flag.  This option reads one or more files from the command  line  and
       generates a new KRL.  The files may either contain a KRL specification (see below) or public keys, listed
       one  per  line.   Plain  public  keys  are  revoked  by  listing  their  hash  or contents in the KRL and
       certificates revoked by serial number or key ID (if the serial is zero or not available).

       Revoking keys using a KRL specification offers explicit control over the types of record used  to  revoke
       keys  and  may  be  used  to  directly  revoke certificates by serial number or key ID without having the
       complete original certificate on hand.  A KRL specification consists  of  lines  containing  one  of  the
       following directives followed by a colon and some directive-specific information.

       <b>serial</b>: <u>serial_number</u>[-<u>serial_number</u>]
               Revokes  a  certificate  with the specified serial number.  Serial numbers are 64-bit values, not
               including zero and may be expressed in  decimal,  hex  or  octal.   If  two  serial  numbers  are
               specified  separated  by a hyphen, then the range of serial numbers including and between each is
               revoked.  The CA key must have been specified on the <b>ssh-keygen</b> command line using the <b>-s</b> option.

       <b>id</b>: <u>key_id</u>
               Revokes a certificate with the specified key ID string.  The CA key must have been  specified  on
               the <b>ssh-keygen</b> command line using the <b>-s</b> option.

       <b>key</b>: <u>public_key</u>
               Revokes the specified key.  If a certificate is listed, then it is revoked as a plain public key.

       <b>sha1</b>: <u>public_key</u>
               Revokes the specified key by its SHA1 hash.

       KRLs  may be updated using the <b>-u</b> flag in addition to <b>-k</b>.  When this option is specified, keys listed via
       the command line are merged into the KRL, adding to those already there.

       It is also possible, given a KRL, to test whether it revokes a particular key (or  keys).   The  <b>-Q</b>  flag
       will  query  an  existing  KRL, testing each key specified on the command line.  If any key listed on the
       command line has been revoked (or an error encountered) then <b>ssh-keygen</b> will exit with  a  non-zero  exit
       status.  A zero exit status will only be returned if no key was revoked.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
