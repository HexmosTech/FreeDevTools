</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ssh-keygen</b> generates, manages and converts authentication keys for <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1).  <b>ssh-keygen</b>  can  create  keys
       for use by SSH protocol version 2.

       The  type  of  key  to  be  generated is specified with the <b>-t</b> option.  If invoked without any arguments,
       <b>ssh-keygen</b> will generate an Ed25519 key.

       <b>ssh-keygen</b> is also used to generate groups for use in Diffie-Hellman group exchange  (DH-GEX).   See  the
       “MODULI GENERATION” section for details.

       Finally,  <b>ssh-keygen</b>  can  be used to generate and update Key Revocation Lists, and to test whether given
       keys have been revoked by one.  See the “KEY REVOCATION LISTS” section for details.

       Normally each user wishing to use SSH with public  key  authentication  runs  this  once  to  create  the
       authentication  key  in  <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ecdsa">~/.ssh/id_ecdsa</a></u>,  <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk">~/.ssh/id_ecdsa_sk</a></u>, <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ed25519">~/.ssh/id_ed25519</a></u>, <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk">~/.ssh/id_ed25519_sk</a></u> or
       <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/id_rsa">~/.ssh/id_rsa</a></u>.  Additionally, the system administrator may use this to generate host keys.

       Normally this program generates the key and asks for a file in which  to  store  the  private  key.   The
       public  key  is  stored  in  a  file with the same name but “.pub” appended.  The program also asks for a
       passphrase.  The passphrase may be empty to  indicate  no  passphrase  (host  keys  must  have  an  empty
       passphrase), or it may be a string of arbitrary length.  A passphrase is similar to a password, except it
       can be a phrase with a series of words, punctuation, numbers, whitespace, or any string of characters you
       want.  Good passphrases are 10-30 characters long, are not simple sentences or otherwise easily guessable
       (English  prose  has  only  1-2  bits  of  entropy per character, and provides very bad passphrases), and
       contain a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and non-alphanumeric characters.   The  passphrase
       can be changed later by using the <b>-p</b> option.

       There  is no way to recover a lost passphrase.  If the passphrase is lost or forgotten, a new key must be
       generated and the corresponding public key copied to other machines.

       <b>ssh-keygen</b> will by default write keys in an OpenSSH-specific format.  This  format  is  preferred  as  it
       offers  better protection for keys at rest as well as allowing storage of key comments within the private
       key file itself.  The key comment may be useful to help identify the key.  The comment is initialized  to
       “user@host” when the key is created, but can be changed using the <b>-c</b> option.

       It  is  still  possible  for <b>ssh-keygen</b> to write the previously-used PEM format private keys using the <b>-m</b>
       flag.  This may be used when generating new keys, and existing new-format keys  may  be  converted  using
       this option in conjunction with the <b>-p</b> (change passphrase) flag.

       After a key is generated, <b>ssh-keygen</b> will ask where the keys should be placed to be activated.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-A</b>      Generate  host  keys  of  all  default key types (rsa, ecdsa, and ed25519) if they do not already
               exist.  The host keys are generated with the default key file path, an empty passphrase,  default
               bits  for the key type, and default comment.  If <b>-f</b> has also been specified, its argument is used
               as a prefix to the default path for the resulting  host  key  files.   This  is  used  by  system
               administration scripts to generate new host keys.

       <b>-a</b> <u>rounds</u>
               When  saving  a  private  key,  this option specifies the number of KDF (key derivation function,
               currently <u><a href="../man3/bcrypt_pbkdf.3.html">bcrypt_pbkdf</a></u>(3)) rounds used.  Higher numbers result in slower passphrase  verification
               and  increased  resistance  to  brute-force  password  cracking (should the keys be stolen).  The
               default is 16 rounds.

       <b>-B</b>      Show the bubblebabble digest of specified private or public key file.

       <b>-b</b> <u>bits</u>
               Specifies the number of bits in the key to create.  For RSA keys, the minimum size is  1024  bits
               and  the  default  is 3072 bits.  Generally, 3072 bits is considered sufficient.  For ECDSA keys,
               the <b>-b</b> flag determines the key length by selecting from one of three elliptic curve  sizes:  256,
               384 or 521 bits.  Attempting to use bit lengths other than these three values for ECDSA keys will
               fail.  ECDSA-SK, Ed25519 and Ed25519-SK keys have a fixed length and the <b>-b</b> flag will be ignored.

       <b>-C</b> <u>comment</u>
               Provides a new comment.

       <b>-c</b>      Requests  changing  the comment in the private and public key files.  The program will prompt for
               the file containing the private keys, for the passphrase if the key has  one,  and  for  the  new
               comment.

       <b>-D</b> <u>pkcs11</u>
               Download the public keys provided by the PKCS#11 shared library <u>pkcs11</u>.  When used in combination
               with  <b>-s</b>,  this option indicates that a CA key resides in a PKCS#11 token (see the “CERTIFICATES”
               section for details).

       <b>-E</b> <u>fingerprint_hash</u>
               Specifies the hash algorithm used when displaying key fingerprints.  Valid options are: “md5” and
               “sha256”.  The default is “sha256”.

       <b>-e</b>      This option will read a private or public OpenSSH key file and print to stdout a  public  key  in
               one  of  the  formats  specified by the <b>-m</b> option.  The default export format is “RFC4716”.  This
               option allows exporting OpenSSH keys for use by other programs, including several commercial  SSH
               implementations.

       <b>-F</b> <u>hostname</u> | <u>[hostname]:port</u>
               Search  for the specified <u>hostname</u> (with optional port number) in a <u>known_hosts</u> file, listing any
               occurrences found.  This option is useful to find hashed host names or addresses and may also  be
               used in conjunction with the <b>-H</b> option to print found keys in a hashed format.

       <b>-f</b> <u>filename</u>
               Specifies the filename of the key file.

       <b>-g</b>      Use generic DNS format when printing fingerprint resource records using the <b>-r</b> command.

       <b>-H</b>      Hash  a  <u>known_hosts</u> file.  This replaces all hostnames and addresses with hashed representations
               within the specified file; the original content is moved to a file with  a  .old  suffix.   These
               hashes  may  be  used  normally  by  <b>ssh</b> and <b>sshd</b>, but they do not reveal identifying information
               should the file's contents be disclosed.  This option will not modify existing  hashed  hostnames
               and is therefore safe to use on files that mix hashed and non-hashed names.

       <b>-h</b>      When  signing  a  key,  create  a  host  certificate  instead  of  a  user  certificate.  See the
               “CERTIFICATES” section for details.

       <b>-I</b> <u>certificate_identity</u>
               Specify the key identity when signing a public key.  See the “CERTIFICATES” section for details.

       <b>-i</b>      This option will read an unencrypted private (or public) key file in the format specified by  the
               <b>-m</b>  option and print an OpenSSH compatible private (or public) key to stdout.  This option allows
               importing keys from other  software,  including  several  commercial  SSH  implementations.   The
               default import format is “RFC4716”.

       <b>-K</b>      Download  resident  keys from a FIDO authenticator.  Public and private key files will be written
               to the current directory for each downloaded key.  If multiple FIDO authenticators are  attached,
               keys  will  be  downloaded  from  the  first touched authenticator.  See the “FIDO AUTHENTICATOR”
               section for more information.

       <b>-k</b>      Generate a KRL file.  In this mode, <b>ssh-keygen</b> will generate a KRL file at the location specified
               via the  <b>-f</b>  flag  that  revokes  every  key  or  certificate  presented  on  the  command  line.
               Keys/certificates to be revoked may be specified by public key file or using the format described
               in the “KEY REVOCATION LISTS” section.

       <b>-L</b>      Prints the contents of one or more certificates.

       <b>-l</b>      Show  fingerprint  of specified public key file.  <b>ssh-keygen</b> will try to find the matching public
               key file and prints its fingerprint.  If combined with <b>-v</b>, a visual ASCII art  representation  of
               the key is supplied with the fingerprint.

       <b>-M</b> <b>generate</b>
               Generate  candidate  Diffie-Hellman  Group  Exchange  (DH-GEX) parameters for eventual use by the
               ‘diffie-hellman-group-exchange-*’ key exchange methods.  The numbers generated by this  operation
               must be further screened before use.  See the “MODULI GENERATION” section for more information.

       <b>-M</b> <b>screen</b>
               Screen  candidate  parameters  for  Diffie-Hellman  Group  Exchange.   This will accept a list of
               candidate numbers and test that they are safe  (Sophie  Germain)  primes  with  acceptable  group
               generators.   The  results  of  this operation may be added to the <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/moduli">/etc/ssh/moduli</a></u> file.  See the
               “MODULI GENERATION” section for more information.

       <b>-m</b> <u>key_format</u>
               Specify a key format for key generation, the <b>-i</b> (import), <b>-e</b> (export) conversion options, and the
               <b>-p</b> change passphrase operation.  The latter may be used to convert between  OpenSSH  private  key
               and  PEM  private key formats.  The supported key formats are: “RFC4716” (RFC 4716/SSH2 public or
               private key), “PKCS8” (PKCS8 public or private key)  or  “PEM”  (PEM  public  key).   By  default
               OpenSSH  will  write  newly-generated  private keys in its own format, but when converting public
               keys for export the default format is “RFC4716”.  Setting a format of “PEM”  when  generating  or
               updating  a  supported private key type will cause the key to be stored in the legacy PEM private
               key format.

       <b>-N</b> <u>new_passphrase</u>
               Provides the new passphrase.

       <b>-n</b> <u>principals</u>
               Specify one or more principals (user or host names) to be included in a certificate when  signing
               a  key.   Multiple  principals  may  be  specified,  separated by commas.  See the “CERTIFICATES”
               section for details.

       <b>-O</b> <u>option</u>
               Specify a key/value option.  These are  specific  to  the  operation  that  <b>ssh-keygen</b>  has  been
               requested to perform.

               When  signing  certificates,  one  of  the  options  listed  in the “CERTIFICATES” section may be
               specified here.

               When performing moduli generation or  screening,  one  of  the  options  listed  in  the  “MODULI
               GENERATION” section may be specified.

               When  generating  FIDO  authenticator-backed keys, the options listed in the “FIDO AUTHENTICATOR”
               section may be specified.

               When performing signature-related options using the <b>-Y</b> flag, the following options are accepted:

               <b>hashalg</b>=<u>algorithm</u>
                       Selects the hash algorithm to use for hashing the message to be signed.  Valid algorithms
                       are “sha256” and “sha512.” The default is “sha512.”

               <b>print-pubkey</b>
                       Print the full public key to standard output after signature verification.

               <b>verify-time</b>=<u>timestamp</u>
                       Specifies a time to use when validating signatures instead of the current time.  The time
                       may be specified as a date or time in the YYYYMMDD[Z] or in YYYYMMDDHHMM[SS][Z]  formats.
                       Dates  and times will be interpreted in the current system time zone unless suffixed with
                       a Z character, which causes them to be interpreted in the UTC time zone.

               When generating SSHFP DNS records from public keys using the <b>-r</b> flag, the following  options  are
               accepted:

               <b>hashalg</b>=<u>algorithm</u>
                       Selects  a  hash  algorithm  to use when printing SSHFP records using the <b>-D</b> flag.  Valid
                       algorithms are “sha1” and “sha256”.  The default is to print both.

               The <b>-O</b> option may be specified multiple times.

       <b>-P</b> <u>passphrase</u>
               Provides the (old) passphrase.

       <b>-p</b>      Requests changing the passphrase of a private key file instead of creating  a  new  private  key.
               The  program  will  prompt  for  the file containing the private key, for the old passphrase, and
               twice for the new passphrase.

       <b>-Q</b>      Test whether keys have been revoked in a KRL.  If the  <b>-l</b>  option  is  also  specified  then  the
               contents of the KRL will be printed.

       <b>-q</b>      Silence <b>ssh-keygen</b>.

       <b>-R</b> <u>hostname</u> | <u>[hostname]:port</u>
               Removes  all  keys  belonging  to  the  specified  <u>hostname</u>  (with  optional  port number) from a
               <u>known_hosts</u> file.  This option is useful to delete hashed hosts (see the <b>-H</b> option above).

       <b>-r</b> <u>hostname</u>
               Print the SSHFP fingerprint resource record named <u>hostname</u> for the specified public key file.

       <b>-s</b> <u>ca_key</u>
               Certify (sign) a public key using the specified CA  key.   See  the  “CERTIFICATES”  section  for
               details.

               When  generating  a  KRL, <b>-s</b> specifies a path to a CA public key file used to revoke certificates
               directly by key ID or serial number.  See the “KEY REVOCATION LISTS” section for details.

       <b>-t</b> <b>ecdsa</b> | <b>ecdsa-sk</b> | <b>ed25519</b> | <b>ed25519-sk</b> | <b>rsa</b>
               Specifies the type of key to create.  The possible values are “ecdsa”, “ecdsa-sk”, “ed25519  (the
               default),” “ed25519-sk”, or “rsa”.

               This  flag may also be used to specify the desired signature type when signing certificates using
               an RSA CA key.  The  available  RSA  signature  variants  are  “ssh-rsa”  (SHA1  signatures,  not
               recommended), “rsa-sha2-256”, and “rsa-sha2-512” (the default for RSA keys).

       <b>-U</b>      When  used  in  combination  with <b>-s</b> or <b>-Y</b> <b>sign</b>, this option indicates that a CA key resides in a
               <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1).  See the “CERTIFICATES” section for more information.

       <b>-u</b>      Update a KRL.  When specified with <b>-k</b>, keys listed via the command line are added to the existing
               KRL rather than a new KRL being created.

       <b>-V</b> <u>validity_interval</u>
               Specify a validity interval when signing a certificate.  A validity interval  may  consist  of  a
               single time, indicating that the certificate is valid beginning now and expiring at that time, or
               may consist of two times separated by a colon to indicate an explicit time interval.

               The start time may be specified as:
               <b>•</b>   The string “always” to indicate the certificate has no specified start time.
               <b>•</b>   A date or time in the system time zone formatted as YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMM[SS].
               <b>•</b>   A date or time in the UTC time zone as YYYYMMDDZ or YYYYMMDDHHMM[SS]Z.
               <b>•</b>   A  relative  time  before  the  current system time consisting of a minus sign followed by an
                   interval in the format described in the TIME FORMATS section of <u><a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html">sshd_config</a></u>(5).
               <b>•</b>   A raw seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 00:00:00 UTC) as a hexadecimal  number  beginning  with
                   “0x”.

               The end time may be specified similarly to the start time:
               <b>•</b>   The string “forever” to indicate the certificate has no specified end time.
               <b>•</b>   A date or time in the system time zone formatted as YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMM[SS].
               <b>•</b>   A date or time in the UTC time zone as YYYYMMDDZ or YYYYMMDDHHMM[SS]Z.
               <b>•</b>   A  relative  time  after  the  current  system  time consisting of a plus sign followed by an
                   interval in the format described in the TIME FORMATS section of <u><a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html">sshd_config</a></u>(5).
               <b>•</b>   A raw seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 00:00:00 UTC) as a hexadecimal  number  beginning  with
                   “0x”.

               For example:

               +52w1d  Valid from now to 52 weeks and one day from now.

               -4w:+4w
                       Valid from four weeks ago to four weeks from now.

               20100101123000:20110101123000
                       Valid from 12:30 PM, January 1st, 2010 to 12:30 PM, January 1st, 2011.

               20100101123000Z:20110101123000Z
                       Similar, but interpreted in the UTC time zone rather than the system time zone.

               -1d:20110101
                       Valid from yesterday to midnight, January 1st, 2011.

               0x1:0x2000000000
                       Valid from roughly early 1970 to May 2033.

               -1m:forever
                       Valid from one minute ago and never expiring.

       <b>-v</b>      Verbose mode.  Causes <b>ssh-keygen</b> to print debugging messages about its progress.  This is helpful
               for debugging moduli generation.  Multiple <b>-v</b> options increase the verbosity.  The maximum is 3.

       <b>-w</b> <u>provider</u>
               Specifies  a  path  to  a library that will be used when creating FIDO authenticator-hosted keys,
               overriding the default of using the internal USB HID support.

       <b>-Y</b> <b>find-principals</b>
               Find the principal(s) associated with the public key of a signature, provided using the  <b>-s</b>  flag
               in an authorized signers file provided using the <b>-f</b> flag.  The format of the allowed signers file
               is  documented  in  the  “ALLOWED SIGNERS” section below.  If one or more matching principals are
               found, they are returned on standard output.

       <b>-Y</b> <b>match-principals</b>
               Find principal matching the principal name provided using the <b>-I</b> flag in the  authorized  signers
               file  specified  using  the  <b>-f</b>  flag.   If  one  or more matching principals are found, they are
               returned on standard output.

       <b>-Y</b> <b>check-novalidate</b>
               Checks that a signature generated using <b>ssh-keygen</b> <b>-Y</b> <b>sign</b> has a valid structure.  This does  not
               validate  if  a  signature comes from an authorized signer.  When testing a signature, <b>ssh-keygen</b>
               accepts a message on standard input and a signature namespace using <b>-n</b>.  A  file  containing  the
               corresponding  signature  must  also  be  supplied  using the <b>-s</b> flag.  Successful testing of the
               signature is signalled by <b>ssh-keygen</b> returning a zero exit status.

       <b>-Y</b> <b>sign</b>
               Cryptographically sign a file or some data using an SSH key.  When  signing,  <b>ssh-keygen</b>  accepts
               zero  or  more files to sign on the command-line - if no files are specified then <b>ssh-keygen</b> will
               sign data presented on standard input.  Signatures are written to the path of the input file with
               “.sig” appended, or to standard output if the message to be signed was read from standard input.

               The key used for signing is specified using the <b>-f</b> option and may refer to either a private  key,
               or  a  public  key  with  the  private  half available via <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1).  An additional signature
               namespace, used to prevent signature confusion across different domains of use (e.g. file signing
               vs email signing) must be provided via the <b>-n</b> flag.  Namespaces are arbitrary  strings,  and  may
               include:  “file” for file signing, “email” for email signing.  For custom uses, it is recommended
               to use names following a <a href="mailto:NAMESPACE@YOUR.DOMAIN">NAMESPACE@YOUR.DOMAIN</a> pattern to generate unambiguous namespaces.

       <b>-Y</b> <b>verify</b>
               Request to verify a signature generated using  <b>ssh-keygen</b>  <b>-Y</b>  <b>sign</b>  as  described  above.   When
               verifying  a  signature, <b>ssh-keygen</b> accepts a message on standard input and a signature namespace
               using <b>-n</b>.  A file containing the corresponding signature must also be supplied using the <b>-s</b> flag,
               along with the identity of the signer using <b>-I</b> and a list of allowed signers  via  the  <b>-f</b>  flag.
               The  format  of the allowed signers file is documented in the “ALLOWED SIGNERS” section below.  A
               file containing revoked keys can be passed using the <b>-r</b> flag.  The revocation file may be  a  KRL
               or  a  one-per-line  list  of  public  keys.   Successful verification by an authorized signer is
               signalled by <b>ssh-keygen</b> returning a zero exit status.

       <b>-y</b>      This option will read a private OpenSSH format file and print an OpenSSH public key to stdout.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>cipher</u>
               Specifies the cipher to use for encryption when writing an OpenSSH-format private key file.   The
               list of available ciphers may be obtained using "ssh -Q cipher".  The default is “aes256-ctr”.

       <b>-z</b> <u>serial_number</u>
               Specifies  a serial number to be embedded in the certificate to distinguish this certificate from
               others from the same CA.  If the <u>serial_number</u> is prefixed with a ‘+’ character, then the  serial
               number  will  be  incremented  for each certificate signed on a single command-line.  The default
               serial number is zero.

               When generating a KRL, the <b>-z</b> flag is used to specify a KRL version number.

</pre><h4><b>MODULI</b> <b>GENERATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ssh-keygen</b> may be used to generate groups  for  the  Diffie-Hellman  Group  Exchange  (DH-GEX)  protocol.
       Generating  these  groups  is a two-step process: first, candidate primes are generated using a fast, but
       memory intensive process.  These candidate primes  are  then  tested  for  suitability  (a  CPU-intensive
       process).

       Generation  of primes is performed using the <b>-M</b> <b>generate</b> option.  The desired length of the primes may be
       specified by the <b>-O</b> <b>bits</b> option.  For example:

             <b>#</b> <b>ssh-keygen</b> <b>-M</b> <b>generate</b> <b>-O</b> <b>bits=2048</b> <b>moduli-2048.candidates</b>

       By default, the search for primes begins at a random point in the desired  length  range.   This  may  be
       overridden using the <b>-O</b> <b>start</b> option, which specifies a different start point (in hex).

       Once  a  set  of  candidates  have  been  generated,  they must be screened for suitability.  This may be
       performed using the <b>-M</b> <b>screen</b> option.  In this mode <b>ssh-keygen</b> will read candidates from  standard  input
       (or a file specified using the <b>-f</b> option).  For example:

             <b>#</b> <b>ssh-keygen</b> <b>-M</b> <b>screen</b> <b>-f</b> <b>moduli-2048.candidates</b> <b>moduli-2048</b>

       By default, each candidate will be subjected to 100 primality tests.  This may be overridden using the <b>-O</b>
       <b>prime-tests</b>  option.   The  DH  generator  value  will  be  chosen  automatically  for  the  prime  under
       consideration.  If a specific generator is desired, it may be requested using the  <b>-O</b>  <b>generator</b>  option.
       Valid generator values are 2, 3, and 5.

       Screened  DH  groups may be installed in <u><a href="file:/etc/ssh/moduli">/etc/ssh/moduli</a></u>.  It is important that this file contains moduli
       of a range of bit lengths.

       A number of options are available for moduli generation and screening via the <b>-O</b> flag:

       <b>lines</b>=<u>number</u>
               Exit after screening the specified number of lines while performing DH candidate screening.

       <b>start-line</b>=<u>line-number</u>
               Start screening at the specified line number while performing DH candidate screening.

       <b>checkpoint</b>=<u>filename</u>
               Write the last line processed to the specified file  while  performing  DH  candidate  screening.
               This  will be used to skip lines in the input file that have already been processed if the job is
               restarted.

       <b>memory</b>=<u>mbytes</u>
               Specify the amount of memory to use (in megabytes) when generating candidate moduli for DH-GEX.

       <b>start</b>=<u>hex-value</u>
               Specify start point (in hex) when generating candidate moduli for DH-GEX.

       <b>generator</b>=<u>value</u>
               Specify desired generator (in decimal) when testing candidate moduli for DH-GEX.

</pre><h4><b>CERTIFICATES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ssh-keygen</b> supports signing of  keys  to  produce  certificates  that  may  be  used  for  user  or  host
       authentication.   Certificates consist of a public key, some identity information, zero or more principal
       (user or host) names and a set of options that are signed by a Certification Authority (CA) key.  Clients
       or servers may then trust only the CA key and verify its signature on a certificate rather than  trusting
       many  user/host  keys.   Note  that OpenSSH certificates are a different, and much simpler, format to the
       X.509 certificates used in <u><a href="../man8/ssl.8.html">ssl</a></u>(8).

       <b>ssh-keygen</b> supports two types of certificates: user and host.  User certificates  authenticate  users  to
       servers, whereas host certificates authenticate server hosts to users.  To generate a user certificate:

             <b>$</b> <b>ssh-keygen</b> <b>-s</b> <b>/path/to/ca_key</b> <b>-I</b> <b>key_id</b> <b>/path/to/user_key.pub</b>

       The  resultant certificate will be placed in <u>/path/to/user_key-cert.pub</u>.  A host certificate requires the
       <b>-h</b> option:

             <b>$</b> <b>ssh-keygen</b> <b>-s</b> <b>/path/to/ca_key</b> <b>-I</b> <b>key_id</b> <b>-h</b> <b>/path/to/host_key.pub</b>

       The host certificate will be output to <u>/path/to/host_key-cert.pub</u>.

       It is possible to sign using a CA key stored in a PKCS#11 token by providing the token library  using  <b>-D</b>
       and identifying the CA key by providing its public half as an argument to <b>-s</b>:

             <b>$</b> <b>ssh-keygen</b> <b>-s</b> <b>ca_key.pub</b> <b>-D</b> <b>libpkcs11.so</b> <b>-I</b> <b>key_id</b> <b>user_key.pub</b>

       Similarly,  it  is  possible  for the CA key to be hosted in a <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1).  This is indicated by the <b>-U</b>
       flag and, again, the CA key must be identified by its public half.

             <b>$</b> <b>ssh-keygen</b> <b>-Us</b> <b>ca_key.pub</b> <b>-I</b> <b>key_id</b> <b>user_key.pub</b>

       In all cases, <u>key_id</u> is a "key identifier" that is logged by the server when the certificate is used  for
       authentication.

       Certificates  may be limited to be valid for a set of principal (user/host) names.  By default, generated
       certificates are valid for all users or hosts.   To  generate  a  certificate  for  a  specified  set  of
       principals:

             <b>$</b> <b>ssh-keygen</b> <b>-s</b> <b>ca_key</b> <b>-I</b> <b>key_id</b> <b>-n</b> <b>user1,user2</b> <b>user_key.pub</b>
             <b>$</b> <b>ssh-keygen</b> <b>-s</b> <b>ca_key</b> <b>-I</b> <b>key_id</b> <b>-h</b> <b>-n</b> <b>host.domain</b> <b>host_key.pub</b>

       Additional  limitations on the validity and use of user certificates may be specified through certificate
       options.  A certificate option may disable features of the SSH session, may be valid only when  presented
       from particular source addresses or may force the use of a specific command.

       The options that are valid for user certificates are:

       <b>clear</b>   Clear  all  enabled  permissions.   This is useful for clearing the default set of permissions so
               permissions may be added individually.

       <b>critical</b>:<u>name</u>[=<u>contents</u>]
       <b>extension</b>:<u>name</u>[=<u>contents</u>]
               Includes an arbitrary certificate critical  option  or  extension.   The  specified  <u>name</u>  should
               include  a  domain suffix, e.g. “<a href="mailto:name@example.com">name@example.com</a>”.  If <u>contents</u> is specified then it is included
               as the contents of the extension/option encoded as a string, otherwise  the  extension/option  is
               created  with  no contents (usually indicating a flag).  Extensions may be ignored by a client or
               server that does not recognise them, whereas unknown critical options will cause the  certificate
               to be refused.

       <b>force-command</b>=<u>command</u>
               Forces  the  execution  of <u>command</u> instead of any shell or command specified by the user when the
               certificate is used for authentication.

       <b>no-agent-forwarding</b>
               Disable <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1) forwarding (permitted by default).

       <b>no-port-forwarding</b>
               Disable port forwarding (permitted by default).

       <b>no-pty</b>  Disable PTY allocation (permitted by default).

       <b>no-user-rc</b>
               Disable execution of <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/rc">~/.ssh/rc</a></u> by <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) (permitted by default).

       <b>no-x11-forwarding</b>
               Disable X11 forwarding (permitted by default).

       <b>permit-agent-forwarding</b>
               Allows <u><a href="../man1/ssh-agent.1.html">ssh-agent</a></u>(1) forwarding.

       <b>permit-port-forwarding</b>
               Allows port forwarding.

       <b>permit-pty</b>
               Allows PTY allocation.

       <b>permit-user-rc</b>
               Allows execution of <u><a href="file:~/.ssh/rc">~/.ssh/rc</a></u> by <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8).

       <b>permit-X11-forwarding</b>
               Allows X11 forwarding.

       <b>no-touch-required</b>
               Do not require signatures made using this key include demonstration of  user  presence  (e.g.  by
               having  the  user  touch  the  authenticator).   This  option  only  makes  sense  for  the  FIDO
               authenticator algorithms <b>ecdsa-sk</b> and <b>ed25519-sk</b>.

       <b>source-address</b>=<u>address_list</u>
               Restrict the source addresses from which the certificate is considered valid.   The  <u>address_list</u>
               is a comma-separated list of one or more address/netmask pairs in CIDR format.

       <b>verify-required</b>
               Require  signatures  made  using this key indicate that the user was first verified.  This option
               only makes sense for the FIDO authenticator algorithms <b>ecdsa-sk</b> and  <b>ed25519-sk</b>.   Currently  PIN
               authentication  is  the only supported verification method, but other methods may be supported in
               the future.

       At present, no standard options are valid for host keys.

       Finally, certificates may be defined with a validity lifetime.  The <b>-V</b>  option  allows  specification  of
       certificate  start  and end times.  A certificate that is presented at a time outside this range will not
       be considered valid.  By default, certificates are valid from the Unix Epoch to the distant future.

       For certificates to be used for user or host authentication, the CA public key must be trusted by <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8)
       or <u><a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a></u>(1).  Refer to those manual pages for details.

</pre><h4><b>FIDO</b> <b>AUTHENTICATOR</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ssh-keygen</b> is able to generate FIDO authenticator-backed keys, after which they may be used much like any
       other key type supported by OpenSSH, so long as the hardware authenticator is attached when the keys  are
       used.   FIDO  authenticators generally require the user to explicitly authorise operations by touching or
       tapping them.  FIDO keys consist of two parts: a key handle part stored in the private key file on  disk,
       and  a  per-device private key that is unique to each FIDO authenticator and that cannot be exported from
       the authenticator hardware.  These are combined by the hardware at authentication time to derive the real
       key that is used to sign authentication challenges.  Supported key types are <b>ecdsa-sk</b> and <b>ed25519-sk</b>.

       The options that are valid for FIDO keys are:

       <b>application</b>
               Override the default  FIDO  application/origin  string  of  “ssh:”.   This  may  be  useful  when
               generating  host  or  domain-specific resident keys.  The specified application string must begin
               with “ssh:”.

       <b>challenge</b>=<u>path</u>
               Specifies a path to a challenge string that will be passed to the FIDO authenticator  during  key
               generation.   The  challenge  string  may  be  used  as  part  of an out-of-band protocol for key
               enrollment (a random challenge is used by default).

       <b>device</b>  Explicitly specify a <u><a href="../man4/fido.4.html">fido</a></u>(4) device to use, rather  than  letting  the  authenticator  middleware
               select one.

       <b>no-touch-required</b>
               Indicate  that  the  generated  private  key should not require touch events (user presence) when
               making signatures.  Note that <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) will refuse such signatures by default,  unless  overridden
               via an authorized_keys option.

       <b>resident</b>
               Indicate  that  the  key handle should be stored on the FIDO authenticator itself.  This makes it
               easier to use the authenticator on multiple computers.  Resident keys may be supported  on  FIDO2
               authenticators  and typically require that a PIN be set on the authenticator prior to generation.
               Resident keys may be loaded off the authenticator using <u><a href="../man1/ssh-add.1.html">ssh-add</a></u>(1).  Storing both parts of a  key
               on  a  FIDO  authenticator  increases  the  likelihood  of an attacker being able to use a stolen
               authenticator device.

       <b>user</b>    A username to be  associated  with  a  resident  key,  overriding  the  empty  default  username.
               Specifying  a  username  may  be  useful  when  generating  multiple  resident  keys for the same
               application name.

       <b>verify-required</b>
               Indicate that this private key should require user verification for each signature.  Not all FIDO
               authenticators  support  this  option.   Currently  PIN  authentication  is  the  only  supported
               verification method, but other methods may be supported in the future.

       <b>write-attestation</b>=<u>path</u>
               May  be  used  at  key  generation  time  to  record  the  attestation  data  returned  from FIDO
               authenticators during key generation.  This information is potentially  sensitive.   By  default,

</pre><h4><b>KEY</b> <b>REVOCATION</b> <b>LISTS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ssh-keygen</b> is able to manage OpenSSH format Key Revocation Lists (KRLs).  These binary files specify keys
       or certificates to be revoked using a compact format, taking as little as one bit per certificate if they
       are being revoked by serial number.

       KRLs  may  be generated using the <b>-k</b> flag.  This option reads one or more files from the command line and
       generates a new KRL.  The files may either contain a KRL specification (see below) or public keys, listed
       one per line.  Plain public keys  are  revoked  by  listing  their  hash  or  contents  in  the  KRL  and
       certificates revoked by serial number or key ID (if the serial is zero or not available).

       Revoking  keys  using a KRL specification offers explicit control over the types of record used to revoke
       keys and may be used to directly revoke certificates by serial  number  or  key  ID  without  having  the
       complete  original  certificate  on  hand.   A  KRL specification consists of lines containing one of the
       following directives followed by a colon and some directive-specific information.

       <b>serial</b>: <u>serial_number</u>[-<u>serial_number</u>]
               Revokes a certificate with the specified serial number.  Serial numbers are  64-bit  values,  not
               including  zero  and  may  be  expressed  in  decimal,  hex  or octal.  If two serial numbers are
               specified separated by a hyphen, then the range of serial numbers including and between  each  is
               revoked.  The CA key must have been specified on the <b>ssh-keygen</b> command line using the <b>-s</b> option.

       <b>id</b>: <u>key_id</u>
               Revokes  a  certificate with the specified key ID string.  The CA key must have been specified on
               the <b>ssh-keygen</b> command line using the <b>-s</b> option.

       <b>key</b>: <u>public_key</u>
               Revokes the specified key.  If a certificate is listed, then it is revoked as a plain public key.

       <b>sha1</b>: <u>public_key</u>
               Revokes the specified key by including its SHA1 hash in the KRL.

       <b>sha256</b>: <u>public_key</u>
               Revokes the specified key by including its SHA256 hash in the KRL.   KRLs  that  revoke  keys  by
               SHA256 hash are not supported by OpenSSH versions prior to 7.9.

       <b>hash</b>: <u>fingerprint</u>
               Revokes  a key using a fingerprint hash, as obtained from a <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8) authentication log message or
               the <b>ssh-keygen</b> <b>-l</b> flag.  Only SHA256 fingerprints are supported here and resultant KRLs  are  not
               supported by OpenSSH versions prior to 7.9.

       KRLs  may be updated using the <b>-u</b> flag in addition to <b>-k</b>.  When this option is specified, keys listed via
       the command line are merged into the KRL, adding to those already there.

       It is also possible, given a KRL, to test whether it revokes a particular key (or  keys).   The  <b>-Q</b>  flag
       will  query  an  existing  KRL, testing each key specified on the command line.  If any key listed on the
       command line has been revoked (or an error encountered) then <b>ssh-keygen</b> will exit with  a  non-zero  exit
       status.  A zero exit status will only be returned if no key was revoked.

</pre><h4><b>ALLOWED</b> <b>SIGNERS</b></h4><pre>
       When  verifying  signatures,  <b>ssh-keygen</b> uses a simple list of identities and keys to determine whether a
       signature comes from an authorized source.  This "allowed signers" file uses a format patterned after the
       AUTHORIZED_KEYS FILE FORMAT described in <u><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></u>(8).  Each line of the file contains  the  following  space-
       separated  fields: principals, options, keytype, base64-encoded key.  Empty lines and lines starting with
       a ‘#’ are ignored as comments.

       The principals field is a pattern-list (see PATTERNS in <u><a href="../man5/ssh_config.5.html">ssh_config</a></u>(5)) consisting of one or  more  comma-
       separated  USER@DOMAIN  identity  patterns  that  are accepted for signing.  When verifying, the identity
       presented via the <b>-I</b> option must match a principals pattern in order for  the  corresponding  key  to  be
       considered acceptable for verification.

       The  options  (if  present)  consist  of comma-separated option specifications.  No spaces are permitted,
       except within double quotes.  The  following  option  specifications  are  supported  (note  that  option
       keywords are case-insensitive):

       <b>cert-authority</b>
               Indicates  that this key is accepted as a certificate authority (CA) and that certificates signed
               by this CA may be accepted for verification.

       <b>namespaces</b>=namespace-list
               Specifies a pattern-list of namespaces that are  accepted  for  this  key.   If  this  option  is
               present,  the  signature  namespace  embedded  in  the  signature  object  and  presented  on the
               verification command-line must match the  specified  list  before  the  key  will  be  considered
               acceptable.

       <b>valid-after</b>=timestamp
               Indicates  that the key is valid for use at or after the specified timestamp, which may be a date
               or time in the YYYYMMDD[Z] or YYYYMMDDHHMM[SS][Z] formats.  Dates and times will  be  interpreted
               in  the  current  system  time  zone  unless suffixed with a Z character, which causes them to be
               interpreted in the UTC time zone.

       <b>valid-before</b>=timestamp
               Indicates that the key is valid for use at or before the specified timestamp.

       When verifying signatures made  by  certificates,  the  expected  principal  name  must  match  both  the
       principals pattern in the allowed signers file and the principals embedded in the certificate itself.

       An example allowed signers file:

          # Comments allowed at start of line
          <a href="mailto:user1@example.com">user1@example.com</a>,<a href="mailto:user2@example.com">user2@example.com</a> ssh-rsa AAAAX1...
          # A certificate authority, trusted for all principals in a domain.
          *@example.com cert-authority ssh-ed25519 AAAB4...
          # A key that is accepted only for file signing.
          <a href="mailto:user2@example.com">user2@example.com</a> namespaces="file" ssh-ed25519 AAA41...
