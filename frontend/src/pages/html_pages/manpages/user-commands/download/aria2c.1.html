</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       aria2c - The ultra fast download utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>aria2c</b> [&lt;OPTIONS&gt;] [&lt;URI&gt;|&lt;MAGNET&gt;|&lt;TORRENT_FILE&gt;|&lt;METALINK_FILE&gt;] ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       aria2 is a utility for downloading files. The supported protocols are HTTP(S), FTP, SFTP, BitTorrent, and
       Metalink.  aria2  can  download  a file from multiple sources/protocols and tries to utilize your maximum
       download bandwidth. It supports downloading a file from HTTP(S)/FTP /SFTP  and  BitTorrent  at  the  same
       time, while the data downloaded from HTTP(S)/FTP/SFTP is uploaded to the BitTorrent swarm. Using Metalink
       chunk checksums, aria2 automatically validates chunks of data while downloading a file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Most  FTP related options are applicable to SFTP as well.  Some options are not effective against SFTP
          (e.g., <u>--ftp-pasv</u>)

   <b>Basic</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-d,</b> <b>--dir=&lt;DIR&gt;</b>
              The directory to store the downloaded file.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--input-file=&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              Downloads the URIs listed in <b>FILE</b>. You can specify multiple sources for a single entity by putting
              multiple URIs on a single line separated by the  <b>TAB</b>  character.   Additionally,  options  can  be
              specified  after  each  URI  line. Option lines must start with one or more white space characters
              (<b>SPACE</b> or <b>TAB</b>) and must only contain one option per line.  Input files can use  gzip  compression.
              When  <b>FILE</b> is specified as <b>-</b>, aria2 will read the input from <b>stdin</b>.  See the <u>Input</u> <u>File</u> subsection
              for details.  See also the <u>--deferred-input</u> option.  See also the <u>--save-session</u> option.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--log=&lt;LOG&gt;</b>
              The file name of the log file. If <b>-</b> is specified, log is written to <b>stdout</b>. If empty string("") is
              specified, or this option is omitted, no log is written to disk at all.

       <b>-j,</b> <b>--max-concurrent-downloads=&lt;N&gt;</b>
              Set the maximum number of parallel downloads for every queue item.  See also the  <u>--split</u>  option.
              Default: <b>5</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 <u>--max-concurrent-downloads</u>  limits  the  number  of  items  which  are downloaded concurrently.
                 <u>--split</u> and <u>--min-split-size</u> affect the number of connections inside each item.   Imagine  that
                 you have an input file (see <u>--input-file</u> option) like this:

                     <a href="http://example.com/foo">http://example.com/foo</a>
                     <a href="http://example.com/bar">http://example.com/bar</a>

                 Here  is  2 download items.  aria2 can download these items concurrently if the value more than
                 or equal 2 is given to <u>--max-concurrent-downloads</u>.  In each download item,  you  can  configure
                 the number of connections using <u>--split</u> and/or <u>--min-split-size</u>, etc.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--check-integrity</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Check  file integrity by validating piece hashes or a hash of entire file.  This option has effect
              only in BitTorrent, Metalink downloads with checksums or  HTTP(S)/FTP  downloads  with  <u>--checksum</u>
              option.   If  piece  hashes  are  provided,  this option can detect damaged portions of a file and
              re-download them.  If a hash of entire file is provided, hash check is only  done  when  file  has
              been  already  download.  This  is  determined  by  file  length.  If  hash  check  fails, file is
              re-downloaded from scratch.  If both piece hashes and a hash of entire  file  are  provided,  only
              piece hashes are used. Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--continue</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Continue downloading a partially downloaded file.  Use this option to resume a download started by
              a web browser or another program which downloads files sequentially from the beginning.  Currently
              this option is only applicable to HTTP(S)/FTP downloads.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help[=&lt;TAG&gt;|&lt;KEYWORD&gt;]</b>
              The help messages are classified with tags. A tag starts with <b>#</b>. For example, type <b>--help=#http</b> to
              get the usage for the options tagged with <b>#http</b>. If non-tag word is given, print the usage for the
              options  whose name includes that word.  Available Values: <b>#basic</b>, <b>#advanced</b>, <b>#http</b>, <b>#https</b>, <b>#ftp</b>,
              <b>#metalink</b>, <b>#bittorrent</b>, <b>#cookie</b>, <b>#hook</b>, <b>#file</b>, <b>#rpc</b>, <b>#checksum</b>, <b>#experimental</b>, <b>#deprecated</b>, <b>#help</b>,
              <b>#all</b> Default: <b>#basic</b>

   <b>HTTP/FTP/SFTP</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--all-proxy=&lt;PROXY&gt;</b>
              Use a proxy server for all protocols.  To override a previously defined proxy, use "".   You  also
              can override this setting and specify a proxy server for a particular protocol using <u>--http-proxy</u>,
              <u>--https-proxy</u>  and  <u>--ftp-proxy</u>  options.   This  affects  all  downloads.  The format of PROXY is
              <b>[http://][USER:PASSWORD@]HOST[:PORT]</b>.  See also <u>ENVIRONMENT</u> section.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 If  user  and  password  are  embedded  in  proxy  URI  and  they   are   also   specified   by
                 <u>--{http,https,ftp,all}-proxy-{user,passwd}</u>   options,  those  specified  later  override  prior
                 options. For example, if  you  specified  <b>http-proxy-user=myname</b>,  <b>http-proxy-passwd=mypass</b>  in
                 aria2.conf  and  you  specified <b>--http-proxy="<a href="http://proxy">http://proxy</a>"</b> on the command-line, then you'd get
                 HTTP proxy <b><a href="http://proxy">http://proxy</a></b> with user <b>myname</b> and password <b>mypass</b>.

                 Another example: if you specified  on  the  command-line  <b>--http-proxy="<a href="http://user">http://user</a>:pass@proxy"</b>
                 <b>--http-proxy-user="myname"</b> <b>--http-proxy-passwd="mypass"</b>, then you'd get HTTP proxy <b><a href="http://proxy">http://proxy</a></b>
                 with user <b>myname</b> and password <b>mypass</b>.

                 One    more    example:   if   you   specified   in   command-line   <b>--http-proxy-user="myname"</b>
                 <b>--http-proxy-passwd="mypass"</b> <b>--http-proxy="<a href="http://user">http://user</a>:pass@proxy"</b>, then you'd get  HTTP  proxy
                 <b><a href="http://proxy">http://proxy</a></b> with user <b>user</b> and password <b>pass</b>.

       <b>--all-proxy-passwd=&lt;PASSWD&gt;</b>
              Set password for <u>--all-proxy</u> option.

       <b>--all-proxy-user=&lt;USER&gt;</b>
              Set user for <u>--all-proxy</u> option.

       <b>--checksum=&lt;TYPE&gt;=&lt;DIGEST&gt;</b>
              Set  checksum.  TYPE  is hash type. The supported hash type is listed in <b>Hash</b> <b>Algorithms</b> in <b>aria2c</b>
              <b>-v</b>.  DIGEST  is  hex   digest.    For   example,   setting   sha-1   digest   looks   like   this:
              <b>sha-1=0192ba11326fe2298c8cb4de616f4d4140213838</b> This option applies only to HTTP(S)/FTP downloads.

       <b>--connect-timeout=&lt;SEC&gt;</b>
              Set  the  connect  timeout  in seconds to establish connection to HTTP/FTP/proxy server. After the
              connection is established, this option makes no effect  and  <u>--timeout</u>  option  is  used  instead.
              Default: <b>60</b>

       <b>--dry-run</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              If  <b>true</b>  is  given,  aria2  just checks whether the remote file is available and doesn't download
              data. This option has effect on HTTP/FTP download.  BitTorrent downloads are canceled if  <b>true</b>  is
              specified.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--lowest-speed-limit=&lt;SPEED&gt;</b>
              Close  connection  if download speed is lower than or equal to this value(bytes per sec).  <b>0</b> means
              aria2 does not have a lowest speed limit.  You can append <b>K</b> or <b>M</b> (1K = 1024, 1M  =  1024K).   This
              option does not affect BitTorrent downloads.  Default: <b>0</b>

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--max-connection-per-server=&lt;NUM&gt;</b>
              The maximum number of connections to one server for each download.  Default: <b>1</b>

       <b>--max-file-not-found=&lt;NUM&gt;</b>
              If  aria2  receives  "file  not  found"  status from the remote HTTP/FTP servers NUM times without
              getting a single byte, then force the download to fail. Specify <b>0</b> to  disable  this  option.  This
              options  is  effective  only  when using HTTP/FTP servers.  The number of retry attempt is counted
              toward <u>--max-tries</u>, so it should be configured too.

              Default: <b>0</b>

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--max-tries=&lt;N&gt;</b>
              Set number of tries. <b>0</b> means unlimited.  See also <u>--retry-wait</u>.  Default: <b>5</b>

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--min-split-size=&lt;SIZE&gt;</b>
              aria2 does not split less than 2*SIZE byte range.  For example, let's consider  downloading  20MiB
              file.  If  SIZE is 10M, aria2 can split file into 2 range [0-10MiB) and [10MiB-20MiB) and download
              it using 2 sources(if <u>--split</u> &gt;= 2, of course).  If SIZE is 15M, since 2*15M &gt; 20MiB,  aria2  does
              not  split  file  and  download it using 1 source.  You can append <b>K</b> or <b>M</b> (1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K).
              Possible Values: <b>1M</b> -<b>1024M</b> Default: <b>20M</b>

       <b>--netrc-path=&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              Specify the path to the netrc file.  Default: <b>$(HOME)/.netrc</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Permission of the .netrc file must be 600.  Otherwise, the file will be ignored.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--no-netrc</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Disables netrc support. netrc support is enabled by default.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 netrc file is only read at the startup if <u>--no-netrc</u> is <b>false</b>.  So if <u>--no-netrc</u> is <b>true</b> at the
                 startup, no netrc is available throughout the session.  You cannot get netrc  enabled  even  if
                 you send <u>--no-netrc=false</u> using <u>aria2.changeGlobalOption()</u>.

       <b>--no-proxy=&lt;DOMAINS&gt;</b>
              Specify  a  comma  separated  list  of host names, domains and network addresses with or without a
              subnet mask where no proxy should be used.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 For network addresses with a subnet mask, both IPv4  and  IPv6  addresses  work.   The  current
                 implementation  does not resolve the host name in an URI to compare network addresses specified
                 in <u>--no-proxy</u>. So it is only effective if URI has numeric IP addresses.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--out=&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              The file name of the downloaded file.  It is always relative  to  the  directory  given  in  <u>--dir</u>
              option.  When the <u>--force-sequential</u> option is used, this option is ignored.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 You  cannot  specify a file name for Metalink or BitTorrent downloads.  The file name specified
                 here is only used when the URIs fed to aria2 are given on the command line  directly,  but  not
                 when using <u>--input-file</u>, <u>--force-sequential</u> option.

                 Example:

                     $ aria2c -o myfile.zip "<a href="http://mirror1/file.zip">http://mirror1/file.zip</a>" "<a href="http://mirror2/file.zip">http://mirror2/file.zip</a>"

       <b>--proxy-method=&lt;METHOD&gt;</b>
              Set  the  method  to use in proxy request.  METHOD is either <b>get</b> or <b>tunnel</b>. HTTPS downloads always
              use <b>tunnel</b> regardless of this option.  Default: <b>get</b>

       <b>-R,</b> <b>--remote-time</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Retrieve timestamp of the remote file from the remote HTTP/FTP server  and  if  it  is  available,
              apply it to the local file.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--reuse-uri</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Reuse already used URIs if no unused URIs are left.  Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>--retry-wait=&lt;SEC&gt;</b>
              Set  the  seconds  to wait between retries. When <b>SEC</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>0</b>, aria2 will retry downloads when the HTTP
              server returns a 503 response. Default: <b>0</b>

       <b>--server-stat-of=&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              Specify the file name to which performance profile of the servers is saved.  You  can  load  saved
              data  using  <u>--server-stat-if</u>  option.  See  <u>Server</u>  <u>Performance</u> <u>Profile</u> subsection below for file
              format.

       <b>--server-stat-if=&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              Specify the file name to load performance profile of the servers. The loaded data will be used  in
              some  URI  selector  such  as  <b>feedback</b>.   See  also <u>--uri-selector</u> option. See <u>Server</u> <u>Performance</u>
              <u>Profile</u> subsection below for file format.

       <b>--server-stat-timeout=&lt;SEC&gt;</b>
              Specifies timeout in seconds to invalidate performance profile  of  the  servers  since  the  last
              contact to them.  Default: <b>86400</b> (24hours)

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--split=&lt;N&gt;</b>
              Download  a  file  using  N connections.  If more than N URIs are given, first N URIs are used and
              remaining URIs are used for backup.  If less than N URIs are given, those URIs are used more  than
              once  so  that N connections total are made simultaneously.  The number of connections to the same
              host is restricted by the  <u>--max-connection-per-server</u>  option.   See  also  the  <u>--min-split-size</u>
              option.  Default: <b>5</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Some  Metalinks regulate the number of servers to connect.  aria2 strictly respects them.  This
                 means that if Metalink defines the <b>maxconnections</b> attribute lower than N, then aria2  uses  the
                 value of this lower value instead of N.

       <b>--stream-piece-selector=&lt;SELECTOR&gt;</b>
              Specify  piece  selection  algorithm  used in HTTP/FTP download. A piece is a fixed length segment
              which is downloaded in parallel in a segmented download.  Default: <b>default</b>.

              <b>default</b>
                     Select a piece to reduce the number of connections established.  This is reasonable default
                     behavior because establishing a connection is an expensive operation.

              <b>inorder</b>
                     Select a piece closest to the beginning of the file. This  is  useful  for  viewing  movies
                     while  downloading.  <u>--enable-http-pipelining</u>  option may be useful to reduce re-connection
                     overhead. Note that aria2 honors <u>--min-split-size</u>  option,  so  it  will  be  necessary  to
                     specify a reasonable value to <u>--min-split-size</u> option.

              <b>random</b> Select a piece randomly. Like <b>inorder</b>, <u>--min-split-size</u> option is honored.

              <b>geom</b>   When  starting to download a file, select a piece closest to the beginning of the file like
                     <b>inorder</b>, but then exponentially increases space between pieces.  This reduces the number of
                     connections established, while at the same time downloads the beginning part  of  the  file
                     first. This is useful for viewing movies while downloading.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--timeout=&lt;SEC&gt;</b>
              Set timeout in seconds.  Default: <b>60</b>

       <b>--uri-selector=&lt;SELECTOR&gt;</b>
              Specify  URI  selection  algorithm.  The  possible  values are <b>inorder</b>, <b>feedback</b> and <b>adaptive</b>.  If
              <b>inorder</b> is given, URI is tried in the order appeared in the URI list.  If <b>feedback</b> is given, aria2
              uses download speed observed in the previous downloads and choose fastest server in the URI  list.
              This  also  effectively  skips  dead mirrors. The observed download speed is a part of performance
              profile of servers mentioned in <u>--server-stat-of</u> and <u>--server-stat-if</u>  options.   If  <b>adaptive</b>  is
              given,  selects one of the best mirrors for the first and reserved connections.  For supplementary
              ones, it returns mirrors which has not been tested yet, and if  each  of  them  has  already  been
              tested,  returns  mirrors  which  has  to  be  tested  again. Otherwise, it doesn't select anymore
              mirrors. Like <b>feedback</b>, it uses a performance profile of servers.  Default: <b>feedback</b>

   <b>HTTP</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--ca-certificate=&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              Use the certificate authorities in FILE to verify the peers.  The certificate file must be in  PEM
              format  and  can  contain  multiple  CA  certificates.   Use  <u>--check-certificate</u> option to enable
              verification.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 If   you   build   with   OpenSSL   or   the   recent   version    of    GnuTLS    which    has
                 <b>gnutls_certificate_set_x509_system_trust()</b>  function  and the library is properly configured to
                 locate the system-wide CA certificates store, aria2 will automatically load those  certificates
                 at the startup.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 <u>WinTLS</u> and <u>AppleTLS</u> do not support this option. Instead you will have to import the certificate
                 into the OS trust store.

       <b>--certificate=&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              Use  the  client  certificate in FILE. The certificate must be either in PKCS12 (.p12, .pfx) or in
              PEM format.

              PKCS12  files  must  contain  the  certificate,  a  key  and  optionally  a  chain  of  additional
              certificates. Only PKCS12 files with a blank import password can be opened!

              When using PEM, you have to specify the private key via <u>--private-key</u> as well.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 <u>WinTLS</u> does not support PEM files at the moment. Users have to use PKCS12 files.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 <u>AppleTLS</u>  users should use the KeyChain Access utility to import the client certificate and get
                 the SHA-1 fingerprint from the Information dialog corresponding to that certificate.  To  start
                 aria2c  use  <u>--certificate=&lt;SHA-1&gt;</u>.   Alternatively PKCS12 files are also supported. PEM files,
                 however, are not supported.

       <b>--check-certificate</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Verify the peer using certificates specified in <u>--ca-certificate</u> option.  Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>--http-accept-gzip</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Send <b>Accept-Encoding:</b> <b>deflate,</b> <b>gzip</b> request header and inflate response if remote server  responds
              with <b>Content-Encoding:</b> <b>gzip</b> or <b>Content-Encoding:</b> <b>deflate</b>.  Default: <b>false</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Some  server responds with <b>Content-Encoding:</b> <b>gzip</b> for files which itself is gzipped file. aria2
                 inflates them anyway because of the response header.

       <b>--http-auth-challenge</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Send HTTP authorization header only when it is requested by the server.  If  <b>false</b>  is  set,  then
              authorization  header  is  always  sent  to  the  server.  There is an exception: if user name and
              password are embedded in URI, authorization header is always sent to the server regardless of this
              option.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--http-no-cache</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Send <b>Cache-Control:</b> <b>no-cache</b> and <b>Pragma:</b> <b>no-cache</b> header to avoid cached  content.   If  <b>false</b>  is
              given,  these  headers are not sent and you can add Cache-Control header with a directive you like
              using <u>--header</u> option. Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--http-user=&lt;USER&gt;</b>

       <b>--private-key=&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              Use the private key in FILE.  The private key must be decrypted and in PEM format.   An  encrypted
              key may cause undefined behavior.  See also <u>--certificate</u> option.

       <b>--referer=&lt;REFERER&gt;</b>
              Set  an  http  referrer  (Referer).  This  affects  all  http/https downloads.  If <b>*</b> is given, the
              download URI is also used as the referrer.  This  may  be  useful  when  used  together  with  the
              <u>--parameterized-uri</u> option.

       <b>--enable-http-keep-alive</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Enable HTTP/1.1 persistent connection.  Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>--enable-http-pipelining</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Enable HTTP/1.1 pipelining.  Default: <b>false</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 There is usually no performance gain from enabling this option.

       <b>--header=&lt;HEADER&gt;</b>
              Append HEADER to HTTP request header.  You can use this option repeatedly to specify more than one
              header:

                 $ aria2c --header="X-A: b78" --header="X-B: 9J1" "<a href="http://host/file">http://host/file</a>"

       <b>--load-cookies=&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              Load  Cookies  from FILE using the Firefox3 format (SQLite3), Chromium/Google Chrome (SQLite3) and
              the Mozilla/Firefox(1.x/2.x)/Netscape format.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 If aria2 is built without libsqlite3, then it  doesn't  support  Firefox3  and  Chromium/Google
                 Chrome cookie format.

       <b>--save-cookies=&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              Save  Cookies  to FILE in Mozilla/Firefox(1.x/2.x)/ Netscape format. If FILE already exists, it is
              overwritten. Session Cookies are also saved and their expiry values are treated  as  0.   Possible
              Values: <b>/path/to/file</b>

       <b>--use-head</b> <b>[true|false]</b>

   <b>FTP/SFTP</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--ftp-user=&lt;USER&gt;</b>
              Set FTP user. This affects all URIs.  Default: <b>anonymous</b>

       <b>--ftp-passwd=&lt;PASSWD&gt;</b>
              Set FTP password. This affects all URIs.  If user name is embedded but password is missing in URI,
              aria2 tries to resolve password using .netrc. If password is found  in  .netrc,  then  use  it  as
              password. If not, use the password specified in this option.  Default: <b>ARIA2USER@</b>

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--ftp-pasv</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Use the passive mode in FTP.  If <b>false</b> is given, the active mode will be used.  Default: <b>true</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This option is ignored for SFTP transfer.

       <b>--ftp-proxy=&lt;PROXY&gt;</b>
              Use  a  proxy  server  for  FTP.   To  override  a previously defined proxy, use "".  See also the
              <u>--all-proxy</u>   option.    This   affects   all   ftp   downloads.    The   format   of   PROXY   is

       <b>--ftp-type=&lt;TYPE&gt;</b>
              Set FTP transfer type. TYPE is either <b>binary</b> or <b>ascii</b>.  Default: <b>binary</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 This option is ignored for SFTP transfer.

       <b>--ftp-reuse-connection</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Reuse connection in FTP.  Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>--ssh-host-key-md=&lt;TYPE&gt;=&lt;DIGEST&gt;</b>
              Set  checksum for SSH host public key. TYPE is hash type. The supported hash type is <b>sha-1</b> or <b>md5</b>.
              DIGEST is hex digest. For example:  <b>sha-1=b030503d4de4539dc7885e6f0f5e256704edf4c3</b>.   This  option
              can be used to validate server's public key when SFTP is used. If this option is not set, which is
              default, no validation takes place.

   <b>BitTorrent/Metalink</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--select-file=&lt;INDEX&gt;...</b>
              Set  file to download by specifying its index.  You can find the file index using the <u>--show-files</u>
              option.  Multiple indexes can be specified by using <b>,</b>, for example: <b>3,6</b>.  You can also  use  <b>-</b>  to
              specify a range: <b>1-5</b>.  <b>,</b> and <b>-</b> can be used together: <b>1-5,8,9</b>.  When used with the -M option, index
              may vary depending on the query (see <u>--metalink-*</u> options).

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 In multi file torrent, the adjacent files specified by this option may also be downloaded. This
                 is  by design, not a bug.  A single piece may include several files or part of files, and aria2
                 writes the piece to the appropriate files.

       <b>-S,</b> <b>--show-files</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Print file listing of ".torrent", ".meta4" and ".metalink" file and exit.  In case  of  ".torrent"
              file, additional information (infohash, piece length, etc) is also printed.

   <b>BitTorrent</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--bt-detach-seed-only</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Exclude seed only downloads when counting concurrent active downloads (See <u>-j</u> option).  This means
              that  if  <b>-j3</b>  is  given  and this option is turned on and 3 downloads are active and one of those
              enters seed mode, then it is excluded from active download count (thus it becomes 2), and the next
              download waiting in queue gets started. But be aware that seeding  item  is  still  recognized  as
              active download in RPC method.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--bt-enable-hook-after-hash-check</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Allow hook command invocation after hash check (see <u>-V</u> option) in BitTorrent download. By default,
              when  hash  check succeeds, the command given by <u>--on-bt-download-complete</u> is executed. To disable
              this action, give <b>false</b> to this option.  Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>--bt-enable-lpd</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Enable Local Peer Discovery.  If a private flag is set  in  a  torrent,  aria2  doesn't  use  this
              feature for that download even if <b>true</b> is given.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--bt-exclude-tracker=&lt;URI&gt;[,...]</b>
              Comma  separated  list of BitTorrent tracker's announce URI to remove. You can use special value <b>*</b>
              which matches all URIs, thus removes all announce URIs. When specifying <b>*</b> in  shell  command-line,
              don't forget to escape or quote it.  See also <u>--bt-tracker</u> option.

       <b>--bt-external-ip=&lt;IPADDRESS&gt;</b>
              Specify  the  external  IP  address  to  use  in  BitTorrent  download and DHT.  It may be sent to
              BitTorrent tracker. For DHT, this option should be set to report that local node is downloading  a
              particular  torrent.   This is critical to use DHT in a private network. Although this function is
              named <b>external</b>, it can accept any kind of IP addresses.

       <b>--bt-force-encryption</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Requires  BitTorrent  message  payload  encryption  with   arc4.    This   is   a   shorthand   of
              <u>--bt-require-crypto</u>  <u>--bt-min-crypto-level</u>=arc4.   This option does not change the option value of
              those options.  If <b>true</b> is given, deny  legacy  BitTorrent  handshake  and  only  use  Obfuscation
              handshake and always encrypt message payload.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--bt-hash-check-seed</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              If  <b>true</b>  is given, after hash check using <u>--check-integrity</u> option and file is complete, continue
              to seed file. If you want to check file and download it only when it is damaged or incomplete, set
              this option to <b>false</b>.  This option has effect only on BitTorrent download.  Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>--bt-load-saved-metadata</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Before getting torrent metadata from DHT when downloading with magnet link, first try to read file
              saved by <u>--bt-save-metadata</u> option.  If it is successful, then skip downloading metadata from DHT.
              Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--bt-lpd-interface=&lt;INTERFACE&gt;</b>
              Use given interface for Local Peer Discovery.  If  this  option  is  not  specified,  the  default
              interface  is  chosen. You can specify interface name and IP address.  Possible Values: interface,
              IP address

       <b>--bt-max-open-files=&lt;NUM&gt;</b>
              Specify maximum number of files to  open  in  multi-file  BitTorrent/Metalink  download  globally.
              Default: <b>100</b>

       <b>--bt-max-peers=&lt;NUM&gt;</b>
              Specify   the   maximum   number   of   peers   per   torrent.    <b>0</b>  means  unlimited.   See  also
              <u>--bt-request-peer-speed-limit</u> option.  Default: <b>55</b>

       <b>--bt-metadata-only</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Download metadata only. The file(s) described in metadata will not be downloaded. This option  has
              effect  only  when  BitTorrent  Magnet  URI is used. See also <u>--bt-save-metadata</u> option.  Default:
              <b>false</b>

       <b>--bt-min-crypto-level=plain|arc4</b>
              Set minimum level of encryption method.  If several encryption methods are  provided  by  a  peer,
              aria2 chooses the lowest one which satisfies the given level.  Default: <b>plain</b>

       <b>--bt-prioritize-piece=head[=&lt;SIZE&gt;],tail[=&lt;SIZE&gt;]</b>
              Try to download first and last pieces of each file first. This is useful for previewing files. The
              argument  can  contain 2 keywords: <b>head</b> and <b>tail</b>. To include both keywords, they must be separated
              by comma. These keywords can take one parameter, SIZE. For example, if <b>head=&lt;SIZE&gt;</b>  is  specified,
              pieces  in  the range of first SIZE bytes of each file get higher priority.  <b>tail=&lt;SIZE&gt;</b> means the
              range of last SIZE bytes of each file. SIZE can include <b>K</b> or <b>M</b> (1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K). If SIZE is
              omitted, SIZE=1M is used.

       <b>--bt-remove-unselected-file</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Removes the unselected files when download is  completed  in  BitTorrent.  To  select  files,  use
              <u>--select-file</u>  option.  If  it  is not used, all files are assumed to be selected. Please use this
              option with care because it will actually remove files from your disk.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--bt-require-crypto</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              If  <b>true</b>  is  given,  aria2  doesn't  accept  and  establish  connection  with  legacy  BitTorrent
              handshake(\19BitTorrent protocol).  Thus aria2 always uses Obfuscation handshake.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--bt-request-peer-speed-limit=&lt;SPEED&gt;</b>
              If  the whole download speed of every torrent is lower than SPEED, aria2 temporarily increases the
              number of peers to try for more download  speed.  Configuring  this  option  with  your  preferred
              download  speed can increase your download speed in some cases.  You can append <b>K</b> or <b>M</b> (1K = 1024,
              1M = 1024K).  Default: <b>50K</b>

       <b>--bt-save-metadata</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Save metadata as ".torrent" file. This option has effect only when BitTorrent Magnet URI is  used.
              The  file  name  is hex encoded info hash with suffix ".torrent". The directory to be saved is the
              same directory where download file is saved. If the same file  already  exists,  metadata  is  not
              saved. See also <u>--bt-metadata-only</u> option. Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--bt-seed-unverified</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Seed previously downloaded files without verifying piece hashes.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--bt-stop-timeout=&lt;SEC&gt;</b>
              Stop  BitTorrent  download  if download speed is 0 in consecutive SEC seconds. If <b>0</b> is given, this
              feature is disabled.  Default: <b>0</b>

       <b>--bt-tracker=&lt;URI&gt;[,...]</b>
              Comma separated list of additional BitTorrent tracker's announce URI. These URIs are not  affected
              by  <u>--bt-exclude-tracker</u>  option  because they are added after URIs in <u>--bt-exclude-tracker</u> option
              are removed.

       <b>--bt-tracker-connect-timeout=&lt;SEC&gt;</b>
              Set the connect timeout in seconds to establish connection to tracker.  After  the  connection  is
              established,  this  option  makes  no  effect  and  <u>--bt-tracker-timeout</u>  option  is used instead.
              Default: <b>60</b>

       <b>--bt-tracker-interval=&lt;SEC&gt;</b>
              Set the interval in seconds between tracker requests. This completely overrides interval value and
              aria2 just uses this value and ignores the min interval and interval  value  in  the  response  of
              tracker.  If <b>0</b> is set, aria2 determines interval based on the response of tracker and the download
              progress.  Default: <b>0</b>

       <b>--bt-tracker-timeout=&lt;SEC&gt;</b>
              Set timeout in seconds. Default: <b>60</b>

       <b>--dht-entry-point=&lt;HOST&gt;:&lt;PORT&gt;</b>

       <b>--dht-file-path=&lt;PATH&gt;</b>
              Change the IPv4 DHT routing  table  file  to  PATH.   Default:  <b>$HOME/.aria2/dht.dat</b>  if  present,
              otherwise <b>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/aria2/dht.dat</b>.

       <b>--dht-file-path6=&lt;PATH&gt;</b>
              Change  the  IPv6  DHT  routing  table  file  to PATH.  Default: <b>$HOME/.aria2/dht6.dat</b> if present,
              otherwise <b>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/aria2/dht6.dat</b>.

       <b>--dht-listen-addr6=&lt;ADDR&gt;</b>
              Specify address to bind socket for IPv6 DHT.  It should be a global unicast IPv6  address  of  the
              host.

       <b>--dht-listen-port=&lt;PORT&gt;...</b>
              Set  UDP  listening port used by DHT(IPv4, IPv6) and UDP tracker.  Multiple ports can be specified
              by using <b>,</b>, for example: <b>6881,6885</b>.  You can also use <b>-</b> to specify a range: <b>6881-6999</b>. <b>,</b> and <b>-</b> can
              be used together.  Default: <b>6881-6999</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>

              on. See also <u>--dht-listen-addr6</u> option.

       <b>--enable-peer-exchange</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Enable Peer Exchange extension. If a private flag is set in a torrent, this  feature  is  disabled
              for that download even if <b>true</b> is given.  Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>--follow-torrent=true|false|mem</b>
              If  <b>true</b>  or  <b>mem</b>  is  specified,  when  a  file  whose  suffix  is  <b>.torrent</b>  or  content type is
              <b>application/x-bittorrent</b> is downloaded, aria2 parses it as a  torrent  file  and  downloads  files
              mentioned in it.  If <b>mem</b> is specified, a torrent file is not written to the disk, but is just kept
              in  memory.  If <b>false</b> is specified, the <b>.torrent</b> file is downloaded to the disk, but is not parsed
              as a torrent and its contents are not downloaded.  Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>-O,</b> <b>--index-out=&lt;INDEX&gt;=&lt;PATH&gt;</b>
              Set file path for file with index=INDEX. You can  find  the  file  index  using  the  <u>--show-files</u>
              option.   PATH  is  a relative path to the path specified in <u>--dir</u> option. You can use this option
              multiple times. Using this option, you can specify the output file names of BitTorrent downloads.

       <b>--listen-port=&lt;PORT&gt;...</b>
              Set TCP port number for BitTorrent downloads.  Multiple ports can be specified by  using  <b>,</b>,   for
              example:  <b>6881,6885</b>.   You  can  also  use  <b>-</b>  to specify a range: <b>6881-6999</b>.  <b>,</b> and <b>-</b> can be used
              together: <b>6881-6889,6999</b>.  Default: <b>6881-6999</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Make sure that the specified ports are open for incoming TCP traffic.

       <b>--max-overall-upload-limit=&lt;SPEED&gt;</b>
              Set max overall upload speed in bytes/sec.  <b>0</b> means unrestricted.  You can append <b>K</b>  or  <b>M</b>  (1K  =
              1024,  1M  =  1024K).   To  limit  the  upload  speed  per torrent, use <u>--max-upload-limit</u> option.
              Default: <b>0</b>

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--max-upload-limit=&lt;SPEED&gt;</b>
              Set max upload speed per each torrent in bytes/sec.  <b>0</b> means unrestricted.  You can append <b>K</b> or  <b>M</b>
              (1K  =  1024,  1M  =  1024K).   To  limit the overall upload speed, use <u>--max-overall-upload-limit</u>
              option.  Default: <b>0</b>

       <b>--peer-id-prefix=&lt;PEER_ID_PREFIX&gt;</b>
              Specify the prefix of peer ID. The peer ID in BitTorrent is 20 byte length. If more than 20  bytes
              are specified, only first 20 bytes are used. If less than 20 bytes are specified, random byte data
              are added to make its length 20 bytes.

              Default:  <b>A2-$MAJOR-$MINOR-$PATCH-</b>,  $MAJOR,  $MINOR  and  $PATCH are replaced by major, minor and
              patch version number respectively.  For instance, aria2 version 1.18.8 has prefix ID <b>A2-1-18-8-</b>.

       <b>--peer-agent=&lt;PEER_AGENT&gt;</b>
              Specify the string used during the bitorrent extended handshake for the peer's client version.

              Default: <b>aria2/$MAJOR.$MINOR.$PATCH</b>, $MAJOR, $MINOR and $PATCH are replaced by  major,  minor  and
              patch   version   number  respectively.   For  instance,  aria2  version  1.18.8  has  peer  agent
              <b>aria2/1.18.8</b>.

       <b>--seed-ratio=&lt;RATIO&gt;</b>
              Specify share ratio. Seed completed torrents until share ratio reaches RATIO.   You  are  strongly
              encouraged  to  specify  equals  or  more  than <b>1.0</b> here.  Specify <b>0.0</b> if you intend to do seeding
              regardless of share ratio.  If <u>--seed-time</u> option is specified along  with  this  option,  seeding
              ends when at least one of the conditions is satisfied.  Default: <b>1.0</b>

       <b>--seed-time=&lt;MINUTES&gt;</b>
              Specify seeding time in (fractional) minutes. Also see the <u>--seed-ratio</u> option.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Specifying <u>--seed-time=0</u> disables seeding after download completed.

       <b>-T,</b> <b>--torrent-file=&lt;TORRENT_FILE&gt;</b>
              The  path to the ".torrent" file.  You are not required to use this option because you can specify
              ".torrent" files without <u>--torrent-file</u>.

   <b>Metalink</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--follow-metalink=true|false|mem</b>
              If <b>true</b> or <b>mem</b> is specified, when a file whose suffix is <b>.meta4</b> or <b>.metalink</b> or  content  type  of
              <b>application/metalink4+xml</b> or <b>application/metalink+xml</b> is downloaded, aria2 parses it as a metalink
              file  and downloads files mentioned in it.  If <b>mem</b> is specified, a metalink file is not written to
              the disk, but is just kept in memory.  If <b>false</b> is specified, the <b>.metalink</b> file is downloaded  to
              the disk, but is not parsed as a metalink file and its contents are not downloaded.  Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>--metalink-base-uri=&lt;URI&gt;</b>
              Specify  base  URI  to  resolve  relative  URI  in  metalink:url and metalink:metaurl element in a
              metalink file stored in local disk. If URI points to a directory, URI must end with <b>/</b>.

       <b>-M,</b> <b>--metalink-file=&lt;METALINK_FILE&gt;</b>
              The file path to ".meta4" and ".metalink" file. Reads input from <b>stdin</b> when <b>-</b> is  specified.   You
              are  not  required  to  use  this  option  because  you  can  specify  ".metalink"  files  without
              <u>--metalink-file</u>.

       <b>--metalink-language=&lt;LANGUAGE&gt;</b>
              The language of the file to download.

       <b>--metalink-location=&lt;LOCATION&gt;[,...]</b>
              The location of the preferred server.  A comma-delimited list  of  locations  is  acceptable,  for
              example, <b>jp,us</b>.

       <b>--metalink-os=&lt;OS&gt;</b>
              The operating system of the file to download.

       <b>--metalink-version=&lt;VERSION&gt;</b>
              The version of the file to download.

       <b>--metalink-preferred-protocol=&lt;PROTO&gt;</b>
              Specify  preferred  protocol.  The possible values are <b>http</b>, <b>https</b>, <b>ftp</b> and <b>none</b>.  Specify <b>none</b> to
              disable this feature.  Default: <b>none</b>

       <b>--metalink-enable-unique-protocol</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              If <b>true</b> is given and several protocols are available for a mirror in a metalink file,  aria2  uses
              one  of  them.   Use  <u>--metalink-preferred-protocol</u>  option to specify the preference of protocol.
              Default: <b>true</b>

   <b>RPC</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--enable-rpc</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Enable JSON-RPC/XML-RPC server.  It is strongly recommended  to  set  secret  authorization  token
              using <u>--rpc-secret</u> option.  See also <u>--rpc-listen-port</u> option.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--pause</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Pause  download  after  added.  This  option  is  effective  only when <u>--enable-rpc=true</u> is given.
              Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--pause-metadata</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Pause downloads created as a result of metadata download. There are 3 types of metadata  downloads
              in  aria2:  (1) downloading .torrent file. (2) downloading torrent metadata using magnet link. (3)
              downloading metalink file.  These metadata downloads will generate downloads using their metadata.
              This  option  pauses  these  subsequent  downloads.   This   option   is   effective   only   when
              <u>--enable-rpc=true</u> is given.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--rpc-allow-origin-all</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Add Access-Control-Allow-Origin header field with value <b>*</b> to the RPC response.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--rpc-certificate=&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              Use  the certificate in FILE for RPC server. The certificate must be either in PKCS12 (.p12, .pfx)
              or in PEM format.

              PKCS12  files  must  contain  the  certificate,  a  key  and  optionally  a  chain  of  additional
              certificates. Only PKCS12 files with a blank import password can be opened!

              When  using  PEM,  you  have  to  specify  the  private  key  via  <u>--rpc-private-key</u>  as well. Use
              <u>--rpc-secure</u> option to enable encryption.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 <u>WinTLS</u> does not support PEM files at the moment. Users have to use PKCS12 files.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 <u>AppleTLS</u> users should  use  the  KeyChain  Access  utility  to  first  generate  a  self-signed
                 SSL-Server  certificate,  e.g.  using  the  wizard,  and  get  the  SHA-1  fingerprint from the
                 Information dialog corresponding to that new certificate.  To start  aria2c  with  <u>--rpc-secure</u>
                 use  <u>--rpc-certificate=&lt;SHA-1&gt;</u>.   Alternatively  PKCS12  files  are  also supported. PEM files,
                 however, are not supported.

       <b>--rpc-listen-all</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Listen incoming JSON-RPC/XML-RPC requests on all network interfaces. If  false  is  given,  listen
              only on local loopback interface.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--rpc-listen-port=&lt;PORT&gt;</b>
              Specify  a  port  number  for  JSON-RPC/XML-RPC server to listen to.  Possible Values: <b>1024</b> -<b>65535</b>
              Default: <b>6800</b>

       <b>--rpc-max-request-size=&lt;SIZE&gt;</b>
              Set max size of JSON-RPC/XML-RPC request. If aria2 detects the request is more than SIZE bytes, it
              drops connection. Default: <b>2M</b>

       <b>--rpc-passwd=&lt;PASSWD&gt;</b>
              Set JSON-RPC/XML-RPC password.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 <u>--rpc-passwd</u> option will be deprecated in the future release. Migrate to <u>--rpc-secret</u> option as
                 soon as possible.

       <b>--rpc-private-key=&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              Use the private key in FILE for RPC server.  The private key must be decrypted and in PEM  format.
              Use <u>--rpc-secure</u> option to enable encryption. See also <u>--rpc-certificate</u> option.

       <b>--rpc-save-upload-metadata</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Save  the  uploaded  torrent  or metalink metadata in the directory specified by <u>--dir</u> option. The
              file name consists of SHA-1 hash hex string of metadata plus extension. For torrent, the extension
              is '.torrent'. For metalink, it is '.meta4'.  If false is given  to  this  option,  the  downloads
              added  by  <u>aria2.addTorrent()</u>  or  <u>aria2.addMetalink()</u> will not be saved by <u>--save-session</u> option.
              Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>--rpc-secret=&lt;TOKEN&gt;</b>
              Set RPC secret authorization token. Read <u>RPC</u> <u>authorization</u> <u>secret</u> <u>token</u> to know  how  this  option
              value is used.

       <b>--rpc-secure</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              RPC  transport  will be encrypted by SSL/TLS.  The RPC clients must use https scheme to access the
              server. For WebSocket client, use wss scheme. Use <u>--rpc-certificate</u> and <u>--rpc-private-key</u>  options
              to specify the server certificate and private key.

       <b>--rpc-user=&lt;USER&gt;</b>
              Set JSON-RPC/XML-RPC user.

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 <u>--rpc-user</u>  option  will be deprecated in the future release. Migrate to <u>--rpc-secret</u> option as
                 soon as possible.

   <b>Advanced</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>--allow-overwrite</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Restart download from  scratch  if  the  corresponding  control  file  doesn't  exist.   See  also
              <u>--auto-file-renaming</u> option.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--allow-piece-length-change</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              If  false  is  given, aria2 aborts download when a piece length is different from one in a control
              file.  If true is given, you can proceed but some download progress will be lost.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--always-resume</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Always resume download. If <b>true</b> is given, aria2 always tries to resume download and if  resume  is
              not  possible,  aborts  download.  If <b>false</b> is given, when all given URIs do not support resume or
              aria2 encounters  <b>N</b>  URIs  which  does  not  support  resume  (<b>N</b>  is  the  value  specified  using
              <u>--max-resume-failure-tries</u>     option),     aria2    downloads    file    from    scratch.     See
              <u>--max-resume-failure-tries</u> option. Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>--async-dns</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Enable asynchronous DNS.  Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>--async-dns-server=&lt;IPADDRESS&gt;[,...]</b>
              Comma separated list of DNS server address used in asynchronous DNS resolver. Usually asynchronous
              DNS resolver reads DNS server addresses from <b><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></b>. When this option is used,  it  uses
              DNS  servers  specified  in  this option instead of ones in <b><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></b>. You can specify both
              IPv4 and IPv6 address. This option is useful when the system does not  have  <b><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></b>  and
              user does not have the permission to create it.

       <b>--auto-file-renaming</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Rename file name if the same file already exists.  This option works only in HTTP(S)/FTP download.
              The  new  file  name  has a dot and a number(1..9999) appended after the name, but before the file
              extension, if any.  Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>--auto-save-interval=&lt;SEC&gt;</b>
              Save a control file(*.aria2) every SEC seconds.  If <b>0</b> is given, a control file is not saved during
              download. aria2 saves a control file when it stops regardless of the value.  The  possible  values
              are between <b>0</b> to <b>600</b>.  Default: <b>60</b>

       <b>--conditional-get</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Download  file  only  when the local file is older than remote file. This function only works with
              HTTP(S) downloads only.  It does not work if file size is specified in Metalink. It  also  ignores
              Content-Disposition header.  If a control file exists, this option will be ignored.  This function
              uses If-Modified-Since header to get only newer file conditionally. When getting modification time
              of  local  file,  it  uses  user supplied file name (see <u>--out</u> option) or file name part in URI if
              <u>--out</u> is not specified.  To overwrite existing  file,  <u>--allow-overwrite</u>  is  required.   Default:
              <b>false</b>

       <b>--conf-path=&lt;PATH&gt;</b>
              Change  the  configuration  file  path  to  PATH.   Default:  <b>$HOME/.aria2/aria2.conf</b>  if present,
              otherwise <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aria2/aria2.conf</b>.

       <b>--console-log-level=&lt;LEVEL&gt;</b>
              Set log level to output to console.  LEVEL is either <b>debug</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>warn</b> or <b>error</b>.  Default:
              <b>notice</b>

       <b>--content-disposition-default-utf8</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Handle quoted string in Content-Disposition header as UTF-8 instead of  ISO-8859-1,  for  example,
              the filename parameter, but not the extended version filename*.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--daemon</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Run  as  daemon.  The  current working directory will be changed to <b>/</b> and standard input, standard
              output and standard error will be redirected to <b>/dev/null</b>. Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--deferred-input</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              If <b>true</b> is given, aria2 does not read all URIs and options from  file  specified  by  <u>--input-file</u>
              option  at  startup,  but it reads one by one when it needs later. This may reduce memory usage if
              input file contains a lot of URIs to download.  If <b>false</b>  is  given,  aria2  reads  all  URIs  and
              options at startup.  Default: <b>false</b>

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 <u>--deferred-input</u> option will be disabled when <u>--save-session</u> is used together.

       <b>--disable-ipv6</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Disable  IPv6.  This  is useful if you have to use broken DNS and want to avoid terribly slow AAAA
              record lookup. Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--disk-cache=&lt;SIZE&gt;</b>
              Enable disk cache. If SIZE is <b>0</b>, the disk cache is disabled. This feature  caches  the  downloaded
              data in memory, which grows to at most SIZE bytes. The cache storage is created for aria2 instance
              and  shared  by  all downloads. The one advantage of the disk cache is reduce the disk I/O because
              the data are written in larger unit and it is reordered by  the  offset  of  the  file.   If  hash
              checking  is involved and the data are cached in memory, we don't need to read them from the disk.
              SIZE can include <b>K</b> or <b>M</b> (1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K). Default: <b>16M</b>

       <b>--download-result=&lt;OPT&gt;</b>
              This option changes the way <b>Download</b> <b>Results</b> is formatted. If OPT is <b>default</b>, print  GID,  status,
              average  download  speed and path/URI. If multiple files are involved, path/URI of first requested
              file is printed and remaining ones are omitted.  If  OPT  is  <b>full</b>,  print  GID,  status,  average
              download  speed,  percentage of progress and path/URI. The percentage of progress and path/URI are
              printed for each requested file in each  row.   If  OPT  is  <b>hide</b>,  <b>Download</b>  <b>Results</b>  is  hidden.
              Default: <b>default</b>

       <b>--dscp=&lt;DSCP&gt;</b>
              Set DSCP value in outgoing IP packets of BitTorrent traffic for QoS. This parameter sets only DSCP
              bits   in   TOS   field   of   IP   packets,  not  the  whole  field.  If  you  take  values  from
              <u><a href="file:/usr/include/netinet/ip.h">/usr/include/netinet/ip.h</a></u> divide them by 4 (otherwise values would be  incorrect,  e.g.  your  <b>CS1</b>
              class  would  turn  into  <b>CS4</b>).  If  you  take  commonly  used  values  from RFC, network vendors'
              documentation, Wikipedia or any other source, use them as they are.

       <b>--rlimit-nofile=&lt;NUM&gt;</b>
              Set the soft limit of open file descriptors.  This open will only have effect when:

                 a. The system supports it (posix)

                 b. The limit does not exceed the hard limit.

                 c. The specified limit is larger than the current soft limit.

              This is equivalent to setting nofile via ulimit, except that it will never decrease the limit.

              This option is only available on systems supporting the rlimit API.

       <b>--enable-color</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Enable color output for a terminal.  Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>--enable-mmap</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Map files into memory. This option may not work if  the  file  space  is  not  pre-allocated.  See
              <u>--file-allocation</u>.

              Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--event-poll=&lt;POLL&gt;</b>
              Specify  the  method  for  polling  events.  The possible values are <b>epoll</b>, <b>kqueue</b>, <b>port</b>, <b>poll</b> and
              <b>select</b>.  For each <b>epoll</b>, <b>kqueue</b>, <b>port</b> and <b>poll</b>, it is available if system supports it.   <b>epoll</b>  is
              available on recent Linux. <b>kqueue</b> is available on various *BSD systems including Mac OS X. <b>port</b> is
              available on Open Solaris. The default value may vary depending on the system you use.

       <b>--file-allocation=&lt;METHOD&gt;</b>
              Specify file allocation method.  <b>none</b> doesn't pre-allocate file space. <b>prealloc</b> pre-allocates file
              space  before  download begins. This may take some time depending on the size of the file.  If you
              are using newer file systems such as ext4 (with extents support), btrfs, xfs or  NTFS(MinGW  build
              only),  <b>falloc</b>  is your best choice. It allocates large(few GiB) files almost instantly. Don't use
              <b>falloc</b> with legacy file systems such as ext3 and FAT32 because it takes almost the  same  time  as
              <b>prealloc</b>  and  it  blocks aria2 entirely until allocation finishes. <b>falloc</b> may not be available if
              your system doesn't have <b><a href="../man3/posix_fallocate.3.html">posix_fallocate</a>(3)</b> function.  <b>trunc</b>  uses  <b><a href="../man2/ftruncate.2.html">ftruncate</a>(2)</b>  system  call  or
              platform-specific counterpart to truncate a file to a specified length.

              Possible Values: <b>none</b>, <b>prealloc</b>, <b>trunc</b>, <b>falloc</b> Default: <b>prealloc</b>

              <b>WARNING:</b>
                 Using  <b>trunc</b>  seemingly allocates disk space very quickly, but what it actually does is that it
                 sets file length metadata in file system, and does not allocate disk space at all.  This  means
                 that it does not help avoiding fragmentation.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 In  multi  file  torrent  downloads, the files adjacent forward to the specified files are also
                 allocated if they share the same piece.

       <b>--force-save</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Save download with <u>--save-session</u> option even if the download is completed or removed. This option
              also saves control file in that situations. This may be useful to save BitTorrent seeding which is
              recognized as completed state.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--save-not-found</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Save download with <u>--save-session</u> option even if the file was not found on the server. This option
              also saves control file in that situations.  Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>--gid=&lt;GID&gt;</b>
              Set GID manually. aria2 identifies each download by the ID called GID. The GID must be hex  string
              of 16 characters, thus [0-9a-fA-F] are allowed and leading zeros must not be stripped. The GID all
              0  is  reserved  and must not be used. The GID must be unique, otherwise error is reported and the
              download  is  not  added.   This  option  is  useful  when  restoring  the  sessions  saved  using
              <u>--save-session</u> option. If this option is not used, new GID is generated by aria2.

       <b>--hash-check-only</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              If  <b>true</b>  is given, after hash check using <u>--check-integrity</u> option, abort download whether or not
              download is complete.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--human-readable</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Print sizes and speed in human readable format  (e.g.,  1.2Ki,  3.4Mi)  in  the  console  readout.
              Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>--interface=&lt;INTERFACE&gt;</b>
              Bind  sockets  to  given  interface.  You  can  specify  interface name, IP address and host name.
              Possible Values: interface, IP address, host name

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 If an interface has multiple  addresses,  it  is  highly  recommended  to  specify  IP  address
                 explicitly.  See  also  <u>--disable-ipv6</u>.  If your system doesn't have <b><a href="../man3/getifaddrs.3.html">getifaddrs</a>(3)</b>, this option
                 doesn't accept interface name.

       <b>--keep-unfinished-download-result</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Keep unfinished download results even if doing so exceeds <u>--max-download-result</u>.  This  is  useful
              if  all  unfinished  downloads  must be saved in session file (see <u>--save-session</u> option).  Please
              keep in mind that there is no upper bound to the number of unfinished download result to keep.  If
              that is undesirable, turn this option off.  Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>--max-download-result=&lt;NUM&gt;</b>
              Set  maximum  number  of  download   result   kept   in   memory.   The   download   results   are
              completed/error/removed  downloads. The download results are stored in FIFO queue and it can store
              at most NUM download results. When queue is full  and  new  download  result  is  created,  oldest
              download  result is removed from the front of the queue and new one is pushed to the back. Setting
              big number in this option may  result  high  memory  consumption  after  thousands  of  downloads.
              Specifying  0 means no download result is kept.  Note that unfinished downloads are kept in memory
              regardless of this option value. See <u>--keep-unfinished-download-result</u> option.  Default: <b>1000</b>

       <b>--max-mmap-limit=&lt;SIZE&gt;</b>
              Set the maximum file size to enable mmap (see <u>--enable-mmap</u> option). The file size  is  determined
              by  the  sum  of all files contained in one download. For example, if a download contains 5 files,
              then file size is the total size of those files. If file size is strictly greater  than  the  size
              specified in this option, mmap will be disabled.  Default: <b>9223372036854775807</b>

       <b>--max-resume-failure-tries=&lt;N&gt;</b>
              When  used  with  <u>--always-resume=false,</u>  aria2  downloads  file from scratch when aria2 detects N
              number of URIs that does not support resume. If N is <b>0</b>, aria2 downloads file from scratch when all
              given URIs do not support resume.  See <u>--always-resume</u> option.  Default: <b>0</b>

       <b>--min-tls-version=&lt;VERSION&gt;</b>
              Specify minimum SSL/TLS version to enable.  Possible Values: <b>TLSv1.1</b>,  <b>TLSv1.2</b>,  <b>TLSv1.3</b>  Default:
              <b>TLSv1.2</b>

       <b>--multiple-interface=&lt;INTERFACES&gt;</b>
              Comma separated list of interfaces to bind sockets to. Requests will be split among the interfaces
              to  achieve  link  aggregation.  You  can  specify  interface  name,  IP  address and hostname. If
              <u>--interface</u> is used, this option  will  be  ignored.   Possible  Values:  interface,  IP  address,
              hostname

       <b>--log-level=&lt;LEVEL&gt;</b>
              Set log level to output.  LEVEL is either <b>debug</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>warn</b> or <b>error</b>.  Default: <b>debug</b>

       <b>--on-bt-download-complete=&lt;COMMAND&gt;</b>
              For  BitTorrent,  a command specified in <u>--on-download-complete</u> is called after download completed
              and seeding is over. On the other hand, this option set the command to be executed after  download
              completed  but  before  seeding.  See <u>Event</u> <u>Hook</u> for more details about COMMAND.  Possible Values:
              <b>/path/to/command</b>

       <b>--on-download-complete=&lt;COMMAND&gt;</b>
              Set the command to be executed after download completed.  See <u>Event</u> <u>Hook</u> for  more  details  about
              COMMAND.  See also <u>--on-download-stop</u> option.  Possible Values: <b>/path/to/command</b>

       <b>--on-download-error=&lt;COMMAND&gt;</b>
              Set  the  command  to  be  executed  after download aborted due to error.  See <u>Event</u> <u>Hook</u> for more
              details about COMMAND.  See also <u>--on-download-stop</u> option.  Possible Values: <b>/path/to/command</b>

       <b>--on-download-pause=&lt;COMMAND&gt;</b>
              Set the command to be executed after download was paused.  See <u>Event</u> <u>Hook</u> for more  details  about
              COMMAND.  Possible Values: <b>/path/to/command</b>

       <b>--on-download-start=&lt;COMMAND&gt;</b>
              Set  the command to be executed after download got started.  See <u>Event</u> <u>Hook</u> for more details about
              COMMAND.  Possible Values: <b>/path/to/command</b>

       <b>--on-download-stop=&lt;COMMAND&gt;</b>
              Set the command to be executed after download stopped. You can override the command to be executed
              for particular download result using <u>--on-download-complete</u> and <u>--on-download-error</u>. If  they  are
              specified,  command  specified  in  this  option is not executed.  See <u>Event</u> <u>Hook</u> for more details
              about COMMAND.  Possible Values: <b>/path/to/command</b>

       <b>--optimize-concurrent-downloads</b> <b>[true|false|&lt;A&gt;:&lt;B&gt;]</b>
              Optimizes the number of concurrent downloads according to the bandwidth available. aria2 uses  the
              download  speed  observed  in  the previous downloads to adapt the number of downloads launched in
              parallel according to the rule N = A + B Log10(speed in Mbps). The coefficients A  and  B  can  be
              customized  in  the  option  arguments with A and B separated by a colon. The default values (A=5,
              B=25) lead to using typically 5 parallel downloads on 1Mbps  networks  and  above  50  on  100Mbps
              networks.  The  number  of parallel downloads remains constrained under the maximum defined by the
              <u>--max-concurrent-downloads</u> parameter.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--piece-length=&lt;LENGTH&gt;</b>
              Set a piece length for HTTP/FTP downloads. This is the boundary when  aria2  splits  a  file.  All
              splits  occur at multiple of this length. This option will be ignored in BitTorrent downloads.  It
              will be also ignored if Metalink file contains piece hashes.  Default: <b>1M</b>

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 The possible use case of <u>--piece-length</u>  option  is  change  the  request  range  in  one  HTTP
                 pipelined request.  To enable HTTP pipelining use <u>--enable-http-pipelining</u>.

       <b>--show-console-readout</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Show console readout. Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>--stderr</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Redirect all console output that would be otherwise printed in stdout to stderr.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--summary-interval=&lt;SEC&gt;</b>
              Set  interval  in  seconds  to output download progress summary.  Setting <b>0</b> suppresses the output.
              Default: <b>60</b>

       <b>-Z,</b> <b>--force-sequential</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Fetch URIs in the command-line sequentially and download each URI in a separate session, like  the
              usual command-line download utilities.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--max-overall-download-limit=&lt;SPEED&gt;</b>
              Set  max  overall download speed in bytes/sec.  <b>0</b> means unrestricted.  You can append <b>K</b> or <b>M</b> (1K =
              1024, 1M = 1024K).  To limit the download speed per  download,  use  <u>--max-download-limit</u>  option.
              Default: <b>0</b>

       <b>--max-download-limit=&lt;SPEED&gt;</b>
              Set  max download speed per each download in bytes/sec. <b>0</b> means unrestricted.  You can append <b>K</b> or
              <b>M</b> (1K = 1024, 1M = 1024K).  To limit the overall download speed, use  <u>--max-overall-download-limit</u>
              option.  Default: <b>0</b>

       <b>--no-conf</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Disable loading aria2.conf file.

       <b>--no-file-allocation-limit=&lt;SIZE&gt;</b>
              No file allocation is made for files whose size is smaller than SIZE.  You can append <b>K</b> or <b>M</b> (1K =
              1024, 1M = 1024K).  Default: <b>5M</b>

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--parameterized-uri</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Enable  parameterized  URI  support.   You can specify set of parts: <b>http://{sv1,sv2,sv3}/foo.iso</b>.
              Also you can specify numeric sequences with  step  counter:  <b><a href="http://host/image">http://host/image</a>[000-100:2].img</b>.   A
              step  counter  can  be  omitted.   If  all  URIs do not point to the same file, such as the second
              example above, -Z option is required.  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Make aria2 quiet (no console output).  Default: <b>false</b>

       <b>--realtime-chunk-checksum</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Validate chunk of data by calculating checksum while downloading a file  if  chunk  checksums  are
              provided.  Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>--remove-control-file</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Remove  control  file  before  download. Using with <u>--allow-overwrite=true,</u> download always starts
              from scratch. This will be useful for users behind proxy server which disables resume.

       <b>--save-session=&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
              Save error/unfinished downloads to FILE on exit.  You can pass this output  file  to  aria2c  with
              <u>--input-file</u> option on restart. If you like the output to be gzipped append a .gz extension to the
              file  name.   Please  note  that downloads added by <u>aria2.addTorrent()</u> and <u>aria2.addMetalink()</u> RPC
              method and whose metadata could not be saved as a file are not  saved.   Downloads  removed  using
              <u>aria2.remove()</u>  and  <u>aria2.forceRemove()</u>  will not be saved. GID is also saved with <u>gid</u>, but there
              are some restrictions, see below.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
                 Normally, GID of the  download  itself  is  saved.  But  some  downloads  use  metadata  (e.g.,
                 BitTorrent and Metalink). In this case, there are some restrictions.

                 <b>magnet</b> <b>URI,</b> <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>download</b>
                        GID of BitTorrent metadata download is saved.

                 <b>URI</b> <b>to</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>file,</b> <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>download</b>
                        GID of torrent file download is saved.

                 <b>URI</b> <b>to</b> <b>metalink</b> <b>file,</b> <b>and</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> <b>file</b> <b>downloads</b> <b>described</b> <b>in</b> <b>metalink</b> <b>file</b>
                        GID of metalink file download is saved.

                 <b>local</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>file</b>
                        GID of torrent download is saved.

                 <b>local</b> <b>metalink</b> <b>file</b>
                        Any meaningful GID is not saved.

       <b>--save-session-interval=&lt;SEC&gt;</b>
              Save error/unfinished downloads to a file specified by <u>--save-session</u> option every SEC seconds. If
              <b>0</b> is given, file will be saved only when aria2 exits. Default: <b>0</b>

       <b>--socket-recv-buffer-size=&lt;SIZE&gt;</b>
              Set the maximum socket receive buffer in bytes.  Specifying <b>0</b> will disable this option. This value
              will  be  set  to  socket  file  descriptor  using <b>SO_RCVBUF</b> socket option with <b>setsockopt()</b> call.
              Default: <b>0</b>

       <b>--stop=&lt;SEC&gt;</b>
              Stop application after SEC seconds has passed.  If <b>0</b> is given, this feature is disabled.  Default:
              <b>0</b>

       <b>--stop-with-process=&lt;PID&gt;</b>
              Stop application when process PID is not running.  This is useful if aria2 process is forked  from
              a parent process. The parent process can fork aria2 with its own pid and when parent process exits
              for some reason, aria2 can detect it and shutdown itself.

       <b>--truncate-console-readout</b> <b>[true|false]</b>
              Truncate console readout to fit in a single line.  Default: <b>true</b>

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Print the version number, copyright and the configuration information and exit.

   <b>Notes</b> <b>for</b> <b>Options</b>
   <b>Optional</b> <b>arguments</b>
       The  options  that have its argument surrounded by square brackets([]) take an optional argument. Usually
       omitting the argument is evaluated to <b>true</b>.  If you use short form of these options(such as <b>-V</b>) and  give
       an  argument,  then the option name and its argument should be concatenated(e.g.  <b>-Vfalse</b>). If any spaces
       are inserted between the option name and the argument, the argument will be treated as  URI  and  usually
       this is not what you expect.

   <b>Units</b> <b>(K</b> <b>and</b> <b>M)</b>
       Some  options takes <b>K</b> and <b>M</b> to conveniently represent 1024 and 1048576 respectively.  aria2 detects these
       characters in case-insensitive way. In other words, <b>k</b> and <b>m</b> can be used as well as <b>K</b> and <b>M</b> respectively.

   <b>URI,</b> <b>MAGNET,</b> <b>TORRENT_FILE,</b> <b>METALINK_FILE</b>
       You can specify multiple URIs in command-line.  Unless you specify <u>--force-sequential</u>  option,  all  URIs
       must point to the same file or downloading will fail.

       You  can specify arbitrary number of BitTorrent Magnet URI. Please note that they are always treated as a
       separate download.  Both hex encoded 40 characters Info Hash and Base32 encoded 32 characters  Info  Hash
       are  supported.  The  multiple  <b>tr</b>  parameters are supported.  Because BitTorrent Magnet URI is likely to
       contain <b>&amp;</b> character, it is highly recommended to always quote URI with single(<b>'</b>) or double(<b>"</b>)  quotation.
       It   is   strongly   recommended   to  enable  DHT  especially  when  <b>tr</b>  parameter  is  missing.  See  ‐
       <u><a href="http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0009.html">http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0009.html</a></u> for more details about BitTorrent Magnet URI.

       You can also specify arbitrary number of torrent files and Metalink documents stored on  a  local  drive.
       Please  note that they are always treated as a separate download. Both Metalink4 and Metalink version 3.0
       are supported.

       You can specify both torrent file with -T option and URIs. By doing this, you can download  a  file  from
       both torrent swarm and HTTP(S)/FTP/SFTP server at the same time, while the data from HTTP(S)/FTP/SFTP are
       uploaded  to  the  torrent  swarm.   For  single file torrents, URI can be a complete URI pointing to the
       resource or if URI ends with /, name in torrent file in torrent is added. For multi-file  torrents,  name
       and path are added to form a URI for each file.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Make  sure that URI is quoted with single(<b>'</b>) or double(<b>"</b>) quotation if it contains <b>&amp;</b> or any characters
          that have special meaning in shell.

   <b>Resuming</b> <b>Download</b>
       Usually, you can resume transfer by just issuing same command (aria2c URI) if the  previous  transfer  is
       made by aria2.

       If  the  previous  transfer  is  made  by  a  browser  or wget like sequential download manager, then use
       <u>--continue</u> option to continue the transfer.

   <b>Event</b> <b>Hook</b>
       aria2 provides options to specify arbitrary command after specific event  occurred.  Currently  following
       options    are   available:   <u>--on-bt-download-complete</u>,   <u>--on-download-pause</u>,   <u>--on-download-complete</u>.
       <u>--on-download-start</u>, <u>--on-download-error</u>, <u>--on-download-stop</u>.

       aria2 passes 3 arguments to specified command when it is executed.  These arguments are: GID, the  number
       of files and file path.  For HTTP, FTP, and SFTP downloads, usually the number of files is 1.  BitTorrent
       download  can  contain  multiple files.  If number of files is more than one, file path is first one.  In
       other words, this is the value of path key of first struct whose selected key is true in the response  of
       <u>aria2.getFiles()</u>  RPC  method.   If  you  want  to  get all file paths, consider to use JSON-RPC/XML-RPC.
       Please  note  that  file  path  may  change  during  download  in  HTTP   because   of   redirection   or
       Content-Disposition header.

       Let's see an example of how arguments are passed to command:

          $ cat hook.sh
          #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
          echo "Called with [$1] [$2] [$3]"
          $ aria2c --on-download-complete hook.sh <a href="http://example.org/file.iso">http://example.org/file.iso</a>
          Called with [1] [1] [/path/to/file.iso]

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       Because  aria2  can  handle multiple downloads at once, it encounters lots of errors in a session.  aria2
       returns the following exit status based on the last error encountered.

       <b>0</b>      If all downloads were successful.

       <b>1</b>      If an unknown error occurred.

       <b>2</b>      If time out occurred.

       <b>3</b>      If a resource was not found.

       <b>4</b>      If aria2 saw the specified number of "resource not found" error.  See <u>--max-file-not-found</u> option.

       <b>5</b>      If a download aborted because download speed was too slow.  See <u>--lowest-speed-limit</u> option.

       <b>6</b>      If network problem occurred.

       <b>7</b>      If there were unfinished downloads. This error is only reported if  all  finished  downloads  were
              successful  and there were unfinished downloads in a queue when aria2 exited by pressing <b>Ctrl-C</b> by
              an user or sending TERM or INT signal.

       <b>8</b>      If remote server did not support resume when resume was required to complete download.

       <b>9</b>      If there was not enough disk space available.

       <b>10</b>     If piece length was different from one in .aria2  control  file.  See  <u>--allow-piece-length-change</u>
              option.

       <b>11</b>     If aria2 was downloading same file at that moment.

       <b>12</b>     If aria2 was downloading same info hash torrent at that moment.

       <b>13</b>     If file already existed. See <u>--allow-overwrite</u> option.

       <b>14</b>     If renaming file failed. See <u>--auto-file-renaming</u> option.

       <b>15</b>     If aria2 could not open existing file.

       <b>16</b>     If aria2 could not create new file or truncate existing file.

       <b>17</b>     If file I/O error occurred.

       <b>18</b>     If aria2 could not create directory.

       <b>19</b>     If name resolution failed.

       <b>20</b>     If aria2 could not parse Metalink document.

       <b>21</b>     If FTP command failed.

       <b>22</b>     If HTTP response header was bad or unexpected.

       <b>23</b>     If too many redirects  occurred.

       <b>24</b>     If HTTP authorization failed.

       <b>25</b>     If aria2 could not parse bencoded file (usually ".torrent" file).

       <b>26</b>     If ".torrent" file was corrupted or missing information that aria2 needed.

       <b>27</b>     If Magnet URI was bad.

       <b>28</b>     If bad/unrecognized option was given or unexpected option argument was given.

       <b>29</b>     If  the  remote  server  was  unable  to  handle  the  request  due  to a temporary overloading or
              maintenance.

       <b>30</b>     If aria2 could not parse JSON-RPC request.

       <b>31</b>     Reserved.  Not used.

       <b>32</b>     If checksum validation failed.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          An error occurred in a finished download will not be reported as exit status.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       aria2 recognizes the following environment variables.

       <b>http_proxy</b> <b>[http://][USER:PASSWORD@]HOST[:PORT]</b>
              Specify proxy server for use in HTTP.  Overrides http-proxy  value  in  configuration  file.   The
              command-line option <u>--http-proxy</u> overrides this value.

       <b>https_proxy</b> <b>[http://][USER:PASSWORD@]HOST[:PORT]</b>
              Specify  proxy  server  for use in HTTPS.  Overrides https-proxy value in configuration file.  The
              command-line option <u>--https-proxy</u> overrides this value.

       <b>ftp_proxy</b> <b>[http://][USER:PASSWORD@]HOST[:PORT]</b>
              Specify proxy server for use in FTP.   Overrides  ftp-proxy  value  in  configuration  file.   The
              command-line option <u>--ftp-proxy</u> overrides this value.

       <b>all_proxy</b> <b>[http://][USER:PASSWORD@]HOST[:PORT]</b>
              Specify  proxy  server  for  use  if no protocol-specific proxy is specified.  Overrides all-proxy
              value in configuration file.  The command-line option <u>--all-proxy</u> overrides this value.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Although aria2 accepts <b>ftp://</b> and <b>https://</b> scheme in proxy URI, it  simply  assumes  that  <b>http://</b>  is
          specified and does not change its behavior based on the specified scheme.

       <b>no_proxy</b> <b>[DOMAIN,...]</b>
              Specify  a  comma-separated  list  of  host names, domains and network addresses with or without a
              subnet mask where no proxy should be used.  Overrides the <u>no-proxy</u> value  in  configuration  file.
              The command-line option <u>--no-proxy</u> overrides this value.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>aria2.conf</b>
       By  default, aria2 checks whether the legacy path <b>$HOME/.aria2/aria2.conf</b> is present, otherwise it parses
       <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/aria2/aria2.conf</b> as its configuration file.  You can specify the path  to  configuration
       file using <u>--conf-path</u> option.  If you don't want to use the configuration file, use <u>--no-conf</u> option.

       The  configuration  file  is  a  text  file and has 1 option per each line. In each line, you can specify
       name-value pair in the format: <b>NAME=VALUE</b>, where name is the long command-line  option  name  without  <b>--</b>
       prefix.  You  can  use  same  syntax  for  the  command-line option. The lines beginning <b>#</b> are treated as
       comments:

          # sample configuration file for aria2c
          listen-port=60000
          dht-listen-port=60000
          seed-ratio=1.0
          max-upload-limit=50K
          ftp-pasv=true

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The confidential information such as user/password might be included in the configuration file. It  is
          recommended  to  change file mode bits of the configuration file (e.g., <b>chmod</b> <b>600</b> <b>aria2.conf</b>), so that
          other user cannot see the contents of the file.

       The environment variables, such as <b>${HOME}</b>, are expanded by shell.  This means that those variables  used
       in  configuration file are not expanded.  However, it is useful to <b>${HOME}</b> to refer user's home directory
       in configuration file to specify file paths.  Therefore, aria2 expands <b>${HOME}</b>  found  in  the  following
       option values to user's home directory:

       • <u>ca-certificate</u>

       • <u>certificate</u>

       • <u>dht-file-path</u>

       • <u>dht-file-path6</u>

       • <u>dir</u>

       • <u>input-file</u>

       • <u>load-cookies</u>

       • <u>log</u>

       • <u>metalink-file</u>

       • <u>netrc-path</u>

       • <u>on-bt-download-complete</u>

       • <u>on-download-complete</u>

       • <u>on-download-error</u>

       • <u>on-download-start</u>

       • <u>on-download-stop</u>

       • <u>on-download-pause</u>

       • <u>out</u>

       • <u>private-key</u>

       • <u>rpc-certificate</u>

       • <u>rpc-private-key</u>

       • <u>save-cookies</u>

       • <u>save-session</u>

       • <u>server-stat-if</u>

       • <u>server-stat-of</u>

       • <u>torrent-file</u>

       Note  that this expansion occurs even if the above options are used in the command-line.  This means that
       expansion may occur 2 times: first, shell and then aria2c.

   <b>dht.dat</b>
       Unless the legacy file paths <b>$HOME/.aria2/dht.dat</b> and  <b>$HOME/.aria2/dht6.dat</b>  are  pointing  to  existing
       files,  the  routing table of IPv4 DHT is saved to the path <b>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/aria2/dht.dat</b> and the routing
       table of IPv6 DHT is saved to the path <b>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/aria2/dht6.dat</b>.

   <b>Netrc</b>
       Netrc support is enabled by default for HTTP(S)/FTP/SFTP.  To disable netrc support,  specify  <u>--no-netrc</u>
       option.  Your .netrc file should have correct <a href="../man600/permissions.600.html">permissions</a>(600).

       If  machine  name  starts  <b>.</b>, aria2 performs domain-match instead of exact match. This is an extension of
       aria2. For example of domain match, imagine the following .netrc entry:

          machine .example.org login myid password mypasswd

       <b>aria2.example.org</b> domain-matches <b>.example.org</b> and uses <b>myid</b> and <b>mypasswd</b>.

       Some domain-match example follow: <b>example.net</b> does not domain-match <b>.example.org</b>.  <b>example.org</b>  does  not
       domain-match <b>.example.org</b> because of preceding <b>.</b>. If you want to match <b>example.org</b>, specify <b>example.org</b>.

   <b>Control</b> <b>File</b>
       aria2  uses  a  control  file  to track the progress of a download.  A control file is placed in the same
       directory as the downloading file and its file name is the file name  of  downloading  file  with  <b>.aria2</b>
       appended.   For example, if you are downloading file.zip, then the control file should be file.zip.aria2.
       (There is a exception for this naming convention.  If you are downloading a multi  torrent,  its  control
       file  is  the  "top  directory"  name of the torrent with <b>.aria2</b> appended.  The "top directory" name is a
       value of "name" key in "info" directory in a torrent file.)

       Usually a control file is deleted once download completed.  If aria2  decides  that  download  cannot  be
       resumed(for  example, when downloading a file from a HTTP server which doesn't support resume), a control
       file is not created.

       Normally if you lose a control file, you cannot resume download.  But if you have a torrent  or  metalink
       with chunk checksums for the file, you can resume the download without a control file by giving -V option
       to aria2c in command-line.

   <b>Input</b> <b>File</b>
       The  input  file  can  contain a list of URIs for aria2 to download.  You can specify multiple URIs for a
       single entity: separate URIs on a single line using the TAB character.

       Each line is treated as if it is provided in command-line  argument.   Therefore  they  are  affected  by
       <u>--force-sequential</u> and <u>--parameterized-uri</u> options.

       Since  URIs  in  the  input  file  are  directly read by aria2, they must not be quoted with single(<b>'</b>) or
       double(<b>"</b>) quotation.

       Lines starting with <b>#</b> are treated as comments and skipped.

       Additionally, the following options can be specified after each line of URIs. These optional  lines  must
       start with white space(s).

         • <u>all-proxy-passwd</u>

       These  options  have exactly same meaning of the ones in the command-line options, but it just applies to
       the URIs it belongs to.  Please note that for options in input file <b>--</b> prefix must be stripped.

       For example, the content of uri.txt is:

          <a href="http://server/file.iso">http://server/file.iso</a> <a href="http://mirror/file.iso">http://mirror/file.iso</a>
            dir=/iso_images
            out=file.img
          <a href="http://foo/bar">http://foo/bar</a>

       If aria2 is executed with <b>-i</b> <b>uri.txt</b> <b>-d</b> <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b> options, then <b>file.iso</b> is saved as <b>/iso_images/file.img</b>  and
       it is downloaded from <b><a href="http://server/file.iso">http://server/file.iso</a></b> and <b><a href="http://mirror/file.iso">http://mirror/file.iso</a></b>.  The file <b>bar</b> is downloaded from
       <b><a href="http://foo/bar">http://foo/bar</a></b> and saved as <b>/tmp/bar</b>.

       In some cases, <u>out</u> parameter has no effect.  See note of <u>--out</u> option for the restrictions.

   <b>Server</b> <b>Performance</b> <b>Profile</b>
       This  section  describes  the format of server performance profile.  The file is plain text and each line
       has several <b>NAME=VALUE</b> pair, delimited by comma.  Currently following NAMEs are recognized:

       <b>host</b>   Host name of the server. Required.

       <b>protocol</b>
              Protocol for this profile, such as ftp, http. Required.

       <b>dl_speed</b>
              The average download speed observed in the previous download in bytes per sec.  Required.

       <b>sc_avg_speed</b>
              The average download speed observed in the previous download in bytes per sec. This value is  only
              updated   if   the   download   is  done  in  single  connection  environment  and  only  used  by
              AdaptiveURISelector. Optional.

       <b>mc_avg_speed</b>
              The average download speed observed in the previous download in bytes per sec. This value is  only
              updated   if   the   download   is   done  in  multi  connection  environment  and  only  used  by
              AdaptiveURISelector. Optional.

       <b>counter</b>
              How many times the server is used. Currently this  value  is  only  used  by  AdaptiveURISelector.
              Optional.

       <b>last_updated</b>
              Last  contact  time  in GMT with this server, specified in the seconds since the Epoch(00:00:00 on
              January 1, 1970, UTC). Required.

       <b>status</b> ERROR is set when server cannot be reached or out-of-service or timeout occurred. Otherwise, OK is
              set.

       Those fields must exist in one line. The order of the fields is not significant. You can put pairs  other
       than the above; they are simply ignored.

       An example follows:

          host=localhost, protocol=http, dl_speed=32000, last_updated=1222491640, status=OK
          host=localhost, protocol=ftp, dl_speed=0, last_updated=1222491632, status=ERROR

</pre><h4><b>RPC</b> <b>INTERFACE</b></h4><pre>
       aria2  provides  JSON-RPC  over  HTTP  and  XML-RPC  over  HTTP  interfaces that offer basically the same
       functionality.  aria2 also provides JSON-RPC over WebSocket. JSON-RPC over WebSocket uses the same method
       signatures and response  format  as  JSON-RPC  over  HTTP,  but  additionally  provides  server-initiated
       notifications. See <u>JSON-RPC</u> <u>over</u> <u>WebSocket</u> section for more information.

       The  request  path  of  the  JSON-RPC interface (for both over HTTP and over WebSocket) is <b>/jsonrpc</b>.  The
       request path of the XML-RPC interface is <b>/rpc</b>.

       The WebSocket URI  for  JSON-RPC  over  WebSocket  is  <b>ws://HOST:PORT/jsonrpc</b>.  If  you  enabled  SSL/TLS
       encryption, use <b>wss://HOST:PORT/jsonrpc</b> instead.

       The  implemented  JSON-RPC is based on JSON-RPC 2.0 &lt;<u><a href="http://jsonrpc.org/specification">http://jsonrpc.org/specification</a></u>&gt;, and supports HTTP
       POST and GET (JSONP).  The WebSocket transport is an aria2 extension.

       The JSON-RPC interface  does  not  support  notifications  over  HTTP,  but  the  RPC  server  will  send
       notifications  over  WebSocket.  It  also does not support floating point numbers. The character encoding
       must be UTF-8.

       When reading the following documentation for JSON-RPC, interpret structs as JSON objects.

   <b>Terminology</b>
       GID
          The GID (or gid) is a key to manage each download. Each download will be assigned a  unique  GID.  The
          GID  is  stored as 64-bit binary value in aria2.  For RPC access, it is represented as a hex string of
          16 characters (e.g., <b>2089b05ecca3d829</b>). Normally, aria2 generates this GID for each download, but  the
          user can specify GIDs manually using the <u>--gid</u> option. When querying downloads by GID, you can specify
          only the prefix of a GID as long as it is unique among others.

   <b>RPC</b> <b>authorization</b> <b>secret</b> <b>token</b>
       As  of 1.18.4, in addition to HTTP basic authorization, aria2 provides RPC method-level authorization. In
       a future release, HTTP basic authorization will be removed and RPC method-level authorization will become
       mandatory.

       To use RPC method-level authorization, the user has to specify an RPC secret  authorization  token  using
       the  <u>--rpc-secret</u>  option.  For  each  RPC method call, the caller has to include the token prefixed with
       <b>token:</b>. Even when the <u>--rpc-secret</u> option is not used, if the first parameter in  the  RPC  method  is  a
       string  and  starts  with  <b>token:</b>,  it  will  removed from the parameter list before the request is being
       processed.

       For example, if the RPC secret authorization token is <b>$$secret$$</b>, calling <u>aria2.addUri</u> RPC  method  would
       have to look like this:

          aria2.addUri("token:$$secret$$", ["<a href="http://example.org/file">http://example.org/file</a>"])

       The  <u>system.multicall</u>  RPC  method  is  treated  specially. Since the XML-RPC specification only allows a
       single array as a parameter for this method, we don't specify the token in the call. Instead, each nested
       method call has to provide the token as the first parameter as described above.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The secret token validation in aria2 is designed to take at least a certain amount of time to mitigate
          brute-force/dictionary attacks against the RPC interface. Therefore it is recommended to prefer  Batch
          or <u>system.multicall</u> requests when appropriate.

          <u>system.listMethods</u>  and <u>system.listNotifications</u> can be executed without token. Since they just return
          available methods/notifications, they do not alter anything, they're safe without secret token.

   <b>Methods</b>
       All code examples are compatible with  the  Python  2.7  interpreter.   For  information  on  the  <u>secret</u>
       parameter, see <u>RPC</u> <u>authorization</u> <u>secret</u> <u>token</u>.

       <b>aria2.addUri([secret],</b> <b>uris[,</b> <b>options[,</b> <b>position]])</b>
              This  method  adds  a  new  download.  <u>uris</u> is an array of HTTP/FTP/SFTP/BitTorrent URIs (strings)
              pointing to the same resource.  If you mix URIs pointing to different resources, then the download
              may fail or be corrupted without aria2 complaining.  When adding BitTorrent Magnet URIs, <u>uris</u> must
              have only one element and it should be BitTorrent Magnet URI.  <u>options</u> is a struct and its members
              are pairs of option name and value.  See <u>Options</u> below for more details.  If <u>position</u> is given, it
              must be an integer starting from 0. The new download will be inserted at <u>position</u> in  the  waiting
              queue.  If  <u>position</u>  is omitted or <u>position</u> is larger than the current size of the queue, the new
              download is appended to the end of the queue.  This method returns the GID of the newly registered
              download.

              <b>JSON-RPC</b> <b>Example</b>

              The following example adds <b><a href="http://example.org/file">http://example.org/file</a></b>:

                 &gt;&gt;&gt; import urllib2, json
                 &gt;&gt;&gt; jsonreq = json.dumps({'jsonrpc':'2.0', 'id':'qwer',
                 ...                       'method':'aria2.addUri',
                 ...                       'params':[['<a href="http://example.org/file">http://example.org/file</a>']]})
                 &gt;&gt;&gt; c = urllib2.urlopen('<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:6800/jsonrpc', jsonreq)
                 &gt;&gt;&gt; c.read()
                 '{"id":"qwer","jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"2089b05ecca3d829"}'

              <b>XML-RPC</b> <b>Example</b>

              The following example adds <b><a href="http://example.org/file">http://example.org/file</a></b>:

                 &gt;&gt;&gt; import xmlrpclib
                 &gt;&gt;&gt; s = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy('<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:6800/rpc')
                 &gt;&gt;&gt; s.aria2.addUri(['<a href="http://example.org/file">http://example.org/file</a>'])
                 '2089b05ecca3d829'

              The following example adds a new download with two sources and some options:

                 &gt;&gt;&gt; s.aria2.addUri(['<a href="http://example.org/file">http://example.org/file</a>', '<a href="http://mirror/file">http://mirror/file</a>'],

                 'd2703803b52216d1'

              The following example adds a download and inserts it to the front of the queue:

                 &gt;&gt;&gt; s.aria2.addUri(['<a href="http://example.org/file">http://example.org/file</a>'], {}, 0)
                 'ca3d829cee549a4d'

       <b>aria2.addTorrent([secret],</b> <b>torrent[,</b> <b>uris[,</b> <b>options[,</b> <b>position]]])</b>
              This method adds a BitTorrent download by uploading a ".torrent" file.   If  you  want  to  add  a
              BitTorrent  Magnet  URI,  use the <u>aria2.addUri()</u> method instead.  <u>torrent</u> must be a base64-encoded
              string containing the contents of the ".torrent" file.  <u>uris</u> is an array of URIs (string). <u>uris</u> is
              used for Web-seeding.  For single file torrents, the URI can be a complete  URI  pointing  to  the
              resource;  if  URI  ends  with /, name in torrent file is added. For multi-file torrents, name and
              path in torrent are added to form a URI for each file.  <u>options</u> is a struct and  its  members  are
              pairs  of  option  name  and value.  See <u>Options</u> below for more details.  If <u>position</u> is given, it
              must be an integer starting from 0. The new download will be inserted at <u>position</u> in  the  waiting
              queue.  If  <u>position</u>  is omitted or <u>position</u> is larger than the current size of the queue, the new
              download is appended to the end of the queue.  This method returns the GID of the newly registered
              download.  If <u>--rpc-save-upload-metadata</u> is <b>true</b>, the uploaded data is saved as a  file  named  as
              the  hex  string of SHA-1 hash of data plus ".torrent" in the directory specified by <u>--dir</u> option.
              E.g. a file name might be <b>0a3893293e27ac0490424c06de4d09242215f0a6.torrent</b>.  If a  file  with  the
              same  name  already  exists,  it  is  overwritten!   If  the  file cannot be saved successfully or
              <u>--rpc-save-upload-metadata</u> is <b>false</b>,  the  downloads  added  by  this  method  are  not  saved  by
              <u>--save-session</u>.

              The following examples add local file <b>file.torrent</b>.

              as contacting BitTorrent trackers to unregister the download first.

       <b>aria2.pause([secret],</b> <b>gid)</b>
              This method pauses the download denoted by <u>gid</u> (string).  The status of  paused  download  becomes
              <b>paused</b>.   If the download was active, the download is placed in the front of waiting queue.  While
              the status is <b>paused</b>, the download  is  not  started.   To  change  status  to  <b>waiting</b>,  use  the
              <u>aria2.unpause()</u> method.  This method returns GID of paused download.

       <b>aria2.pauseAll([secret])</b>
              This  method  is  equal  to  calling <u>aria2.pause()</u> for every active/waiting download. This methods

              <b>gid</b>    GID of the download.

              <b>status</b> <b>active</b>  for  currently  downloading/seeding downloads.  <b>waiting</b> for downloads in the queue;
                     download is not started.  <b>paused</b> for paused  downloads.   <b>error</b>  for  downloads  that  were
                     stopped   because of error.  <b>complete</b> for stopped and completed downloads.  <b>removed</b> for the
                     downloads removed by user.

              <b>totalLength</b>
                     Total length of the download in bytes.

              <b>completedLength</b>
                     Completed length of the download in bytes.

              <b>uploadLength</b>
                     Uploaded length of the download in bytes.

              <b>bitfield</b>
                     Hexadecimal representation of the download progress. The highest  bit  corresponds  to  the
                     piece  at  index  0. Any set bits indicate loaded pieces, while unset bits indicate not yet
                     loaded and/or missing pieces. Any overflow bits at the end  are  set  to  zero.   When  the
                     download was not started yet, this key will not be included in the response.

              <b>downloadSpeed</b>
                     Download speed of this download measured in bytes/sec.

              <b>uploadSpeed</b>
                     Upload speed of this download measured in bytes/sec.

              <b>infoHash</b>
                     InfoHash. BitTorrent only.

              <b>numSeeders</b>

              <b>numPieces</b>
                     The number of pieces.

              <b>connections</b>
                     The number of peers/servers aria2 has connected to.

              <b>errorCode</b>
                     The  code  of  the last error for this item, if any. The value is a string. The error codes
                     are defined in the <u>EXIT</u> <u>STATUS</u> section.  This value is only available for stopped/completed
                     downloads.

              <b>errorMessage</b>
                     The (hopefully) human readable error message associated to <b>errorCode</b>.

              <b>followedBy</b>

                     <u>--follow-metalink</u> option). This value is useful to track auto-generated downloads. If there
                     are no such downloads, this key will not be included in the response.

              <b>following</b>
                     The reverse link for <b>followedBy</b>.  A download included in <b>followedBy</b> has this  object's  GID

              <b>belongsTo</b>
                     GID of a parent download. Some downloads are a part of another download.  For example, if a
                     file in a Metalink has BitTorrent resources, the downloads of ".torrent" files are parts of
                     that  parent.   If  this  download  has  no  parent,  this  key will not be included in the
                     response.

              <b>dir</b>    Directory to save files.

              <b>files</b>  Returns the list of files. The  elements  of  this  list  are  the  same  structs  used  in
                     <u>aria2.getFiles()</u> method.

              <b>bittorrent</b>
                     Struct  which  contains information retrieved from the .torrent (file). BitTorrent only. It
                     contains following keys.

                     <b>announceList</b>
                            List  of  lists  of  announce  URIs.  If  the  torrent  contains  <b>announce</b>  and   no
                            <b>announce-list</b>, <b>announce</b> is converted to the <b>announce-list</b> format.

                     <b>comment</b>
                            The comment of the torrent. <b>comment.utf-8</b> is used if available.

                     <b>creationDate</b>
                            The  creation time of the torrent. The value is an integer since the epoch, measured
                            in seconds.

                     <b>mode</b>   File mode of the torrent. The value is either <b>single</b> or <b>multi</b>.

                     <b>info</b>   Struct which contains data from Info dictionary. It contains following keys.

                            <b>name</b>   name in info dictionary. <b>name.utf-8</b> is used if available.

              <b>verifiedLength</b>
                     The number of verified number of bytes while the files are being hash  checked.   This  key
                     exists only when this download is being hash checked.

              <b>verifyIntegrityPending</b>
                     <b>true</b>  if this download is waiting for the hash check in a queue.  This key exists only when
                     this download is in the queue.

              <u>aria2.tellStatus()</u> method.

       <b>aria2.tellWaiting([secret],</b> <b>offset,</b> <b>num[,</b> <b>keys])</b>
              This method returns a list of waiting downloads, including paused ones.  <u>offset</u> is an integer  and
              specifies  the offset from the download waiting at the front.  <u>num</u> is an integer and specifies the
              max. number  of  downloads  to  be  returned.   For  the  <u>keys</u>  parameter,  please  refer  to  the
              <u>aria2.tellStatus()</u> method.

              If  <u>offset</u>  is a positive integer, this method returns downloads in the range of [<u>offset</u>, <u>offset</u> +
              <u>num</u>).

              <u>offset</u> can be a negative integer. <u>offset</u> == -1 points last  download  in  the  waiting  queue  and

              are in reversed order then.

              For  example,  imagine  three  downloads  "A","B"   and   "C"   are   waiting   in   this   order.
              <b>aria2.tellWaiting(0,</b>   <b>1)</b>   returns   <b>["A"]</b>.   <b>aria2.tellWaiting(1,</b>   <b>2)</b>   returns   <b>["B",</b>   <b>"C"]</b>.
              <b>aria2.tellWaiting(-1,</b> <b>2)</b> returns <b>["C",</b> <b>"B"]</b>.

              The response is an array of the same structs as returned by <u>aria2.tellStatus()</u> method.

       <b>aria2.tellStopped([secret],</b> <b>offset,</b> <b>num[,</b> <b>keys])</b>
              This method returns a list of stopped downloads.  <u>offset</u> is an integer and  specifies  the  offset
              from  the  least  recently  stopped  download.  <u>num</u> is an integer and specifies the max. number of
              downloads to be returned.  For the <u>keys</u> parameter, please refer to the <u>aria2.tellStatus()</u> method.

              <u>offset</u> and <u>num</u> have the same semantics as described in the <u>aria2.tellWaiting()</u> method.

              The response is an array of the same structs as returned by the <u>aria2.tellStatus()</u> method.

       <b>aria2.changePosition([secret],</b> <b>gid,</b> <b>pos,</b> <b>how)</b>
              This method changes the position of the download denoted by <u>gid</u> in the queue.  <u>pos</u> is an  integer.
              <u>how</u>  is a string. If <u>how</u> is <b>POS_SET</b>, it moves the download to a position relative to the beginning
              of the queue.  If <u>how</u> is <b>POS_CUR</b>, it moves the download to a  position  relative  to  the  current
              position. If <u>how</u> is <b>POS_END</b>, it moves the download to a position relative to the end of the queue.
              If  the  destination position is less than 0 or beyond the end of the queue, it moves the download
              to the beginning or the end of the queue respectively. The response is  an  integer  denoting  the
              resulting position.

              For      example,      if     GID#2089b05ecca3d829     is     currently     in     position     3,
              <b>aria2.changePosition('2089b05ecca3d829',</b>  <b>-1,</b>  <b>'POS_CUR')</b>  will  change   its   position   to   2.
              Additionally  <b>aria2.changePosition('2089b05ecca3d829',</b> <b>0,</b> <b>'POS_SET')</b> will change its position to 0
              (the beginning of the queue).

              The following examples move the download GID#2089b05ecca3d829 to the front of the queue.

       <b>aria2.changeUri([secret],</b> <b>gid,</b> <b>fileIndex,</b> <b>delUris,</b> <b>addUris[,</b> <b>position])</b>
              This method removes the URIs in <u>delUris</u> from and appends the URIs in <u>addUris</u> to  download  denoted
              by  <u>gid</u>.  <u>delUris</u> and <u>addUris</u> are lists of strings. A download can contain multiple files and URIs
              are attached to each file.  <u>fileIndex</u> is used to select which file to  remove/attach  given  URIs.
              <u>fileIndex</u>  is 1-based. <u>position</u> is used to specify where URIs are inserted in the existing waiting
              URI list. <u>position</u> is 0-based. When <u>position</u> is omitted, URIs are appended  to  the  back  of  the
              list.   This  method  first  executes  the removal and then the addition. <u>position</u> is the position
              after URIs are removed, not the position when this method is called.  When removing an URI, if the
              same URIs exist in download, only one of them is removed for each URI in <u>delUris</u>. In other  words,
              if there are three URIs <b><a href="http://example.org/aria2">http://example.org/aria2</a></b> and you want remove them all, you have to specify
              (at  least)  3 <b><a href="http://example.org/aria2">http://example.org/aria2</a></b> in <u>delUris</u>.  This method returns a list which contains two
              integers. The first integer is the number of URIs deleted. The second integer  is  the  number  of
              URIs added.

              The  following  examples  add  the  URI  <b><a href="http://example.org/file">http://example.org/file</a></b>  to the file whose index is <b>1</b> and

                              u'aria2.addTorrent',
                 ...

              <b>XML-RPC</b> <b>Example</b>

                 &gt;&gt;&gt; import xmlrpclib
                 &gt;&gt;&gt; s = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy('<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:6800/rpc')
                 &gt;&gt;&gt; s.system.listMethods()
                 ['aria2.addUri', 'aria2.addTorrent', ...

       <b>system.listNotifications()</b>
              This  method  returns  all  the  available  RPC notifications in an array of string.  Unlike other
              methods, this method does not require secret token.  This is safe because this method just returns
              the available notifications names.

              <b>JSON-RPC</b> <b>Example</b>

                 &gt;&gt;&gt; import urllib2, json
                 &gt;&gt;&gt; from pprint import pprint
                 &gt;&gt;&gt; jsonreq = json.dumps({'jsonrpc':'2.0', 'id':'qwer',

                              u'aria2.onDownloadPause',
                 ...

              <b>XML-RPC</b> <b>Example</b>

                 &gt;&gt;&gt; import xmlrpclib
                 &gt;&gt;&gt; s = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy('<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:6800/rpc')
                 &gt;&gt;&gt; s.system.listNotifications()
                 ['aria2.onDownloadStart', 'aria2.onDownloadPause', ...

   <b>Error</b> <b>Handling</b>
       Over JSON-RPC, aria2 returns a JSON object which contains an error code in <b>code</b> and the error message  in
       <b>message</b>.

       Over XML-RPC, aria2 returns <b>faultCode=1</b> and the error message in <b>faultString</b>.

   <b>Options</b>
       The  same options as for <u>--input-file</u> are available. See the <u>Input</u> <u>File</u> subsection for a complete list of
       options.

       In the option struct, the name element is the option name  (without  the  preceding  <b>--</b>)  and  the  value
       element is the argument as a string.

   <b>JSON-RPC</b> <b>Example</b>
          {'split':'1', 'http-proxy':'<a href="http://proxy/">http://proxy/</a>'}

   <b>XML-RPC</b> <b>Example</b>
          &lt;struct&gt;
            &lt;member&gt;
              &lt;name&gt;split&lt;/name&gt;
              &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;1&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/value&gt;
            &lt;/member&gt;
            &lt;member&gt;
              &lt;name&gt;http-proxy&lt;/name&gt;
              &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;<a href="http://proxy/">http://proxy/</a>&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/value&gt;
            &lt;/member&gt;
          &lt;/struct&gt;

       The <u>header</u> and <u>index-out</u> options are allowed multiple times on the command-line. Since the name should be
       unique  in a struct (many XML-RPC library implementations use a hash or dict for struct), a single string
       is not enough. To overcome this limitation, you may use an array as the value as well as a string.

   <b>JSON-RPC</b> <b>Example</b>
          {'header':['Accept-Language: ja', 'Accept-Charset: utf-8']}

   <b>XML-RPC</b> <b>Example</b>
          &lt;struct&gt;
            &lt;member&gt;
              &lt;name&gt;header&lt;/name&gt;
              &lt;value&gt;
                &lt;array&gt;
                  &lt;data&gt;
                    &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;Accept-Language: ja&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/value&gt;
                    &lt;value&gt;&lt;string&gt;Accept-Charset: utf-8&lt;/string&gt;&lt;/value&gt;
                  &lt;/data&gt;
                &lt;/array&gt;
              &lt;/value&gt;
            &lt;/member&gt;
          &lt;/struct&gt;

       The following example adds a download with two options: <b>dir</b> and <b>header</b>.  The <b>header</b> option  requires  two
       values, so it uses a list:

          &gt;&gt;&gt; import xmlrpclib
          &gt;&gt;&gt; s = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy('<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:6800/rpc')
          &gt;&gt;&gt; opts = dict(dir='<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>',
          ...             header=['Accept-Language: ja',
          ...                     'Accept-Charset: utf-8'])
          &gt;&gt;&gt; s.aria2.addUri(['<a href="http://example.org/file">http://example.org/file</a>'], opts)
          '1'

   <b>JSON-RPC</b> <b>using</b> <b>HTTP</b> <b>GET</b>
       The  JSON-RPC  interface  also  supports requests via HTTP GET.  The encoding scheme in GET parameters is
       based on JSON-RPC over HTTP Specification [2008-1-15(RC1)].  The encoding of GET parameters are follows:

          /jsonrpc?method=METHOD_NAME&amp;id=ID&amp;params=BASE64_ENCODED_PARAMS

       The <b>method</b> and <b>id</b> are always treated as JSON string and their encoding must be UTF-8.

       For example, The encoded string of <b>aria2.tellStatus('2089b05ecca3d829')</b> with <b>id='foo'</b> looks like this:

          /jsonrpc?method=aria2.tellStatus&amp;id=foo&amp;params=WyIyMDg5YjA1ZWNjYTNkODI5Il0%3D

       The <b>params</b> parameter is Base64-encoded JSON array which usually appears in <b>params</b> attribute  in  JSON-RPC
       request object.  In the above example, the params is <b>["2089b05ecca3d829"]</b>, therefore:

          ["2089b05ecca3d829"] --(Base64)--&gt; WyIyMDg5YjA1ZWNjYTNkODI5Il0=
                       --(Percent Encode)--&gt; WyIyMDg5YjA1ZWNjYTNkODI5Il0%3D

       The  JSON-RPC  interface  also  supports JSONP. You can specify the callback function in the <b>jsoncallback</b>
       parameter:

          /jsonrpc?method=aria2.tellStatus&amp;id=foo&amp;params=WyIyMDg5YjA1ZWNjYTNkODI5Il0%3D&amp;jsoncallback=cb

       For Batch requests, the <b>method</b> and <b>id</b> parameters must not  be  specified.   The  whole  request  must  be
       specified in the <b>params</b> parameter. For example, a Batch request:

          [{'jsonrpc':'2.0', 'id':'qwer', 'method':'aria2.getVersion'},
           {'jsonrpc':'2.0', 'id':'asdf', 'method':'aria2.tellActive'}]

       must be encoded like this:

          /jsonrpc?params=W3sianNvbnJwYyI6ICIyLjAiLCAiaWQiOiAicXdlciIsICJtZXRob2QiOiAiYXJpYTIuZ2V0VmVyc2lvbiJ9LCB7Impzb25ycGMiOiAiMi4wIiwgImlkIjogImFzZGYiLCAibWV0aG9kIjogImFyaWEyLnRlbGxBY3RpdmUifV0%3D

   <b>JSON-RPC</b> <b>over</b> <b>WebSocket</b>
       JSON-RPC  over  WebSocket  uses  same  method  signatures  and response format as JSON-RPC over HTTP. The
       supported WebSocket version is 13 which is detailed in <u>RFC</u> <u>6455</u>.

       To send a RPC request to the RPC server, send a serialized JSON string in a Text frame. The response from
       the RPC server is delivered also in a Text frame.

   <b>Notifications</b>
       The RPC server might send notifications to the client. Notifications  is  unidirectional,  therefore  the
       client  which receives the notification must not respond to it. The method signature of a notification is
       much like a normal method request but lacks the id key. The value of the params key  is  the  data  which
       this notification carries. The format of the value varies depending on the notification method. Following
       notification methods are defined.

       <b>aria2.onDownloadStart(event)</b>
              This  notification  will  be  sent when a download is started.  The <u>event</u> is of type struct and it
              contains following keys.  The value type is string.

              <b>gid</b>    GID of the download.

       <b>aria2.onDownloadPause(event)</b>
              This notification will be sent when a download is paused.  The <u>event</u> is the  same  struct  as  the
              <u>event</u> argument of <u>aria2.onDownloadStart()</u> method.

       <b>aria2.onDownloadStop(event)</b>
              This  notification  will  be  sent  when a download is stopped by the user.  The <u>event</u> is the same
              struct as the <u>event</u> argument of <u>aria2.onDownloadStart()</u> method.

       <b>aria2.onDownloadComplete(event)</b>
              This notification will be sent when a  download  is  complete.   For  BitTorrent  downloads,  this
              notification  is  sent  when  the  download is complete and seeding is over. The <u>event</u> is the same
              struct of the <u>event</u> argument of <u>aria2.onDownloadStart()</u> method.

       <b>aria2.onDownloadError(event)</b>
              This notification will be sent when a download is stopped due to an error.  The <u>event</u> is the  same
              struct as the <u>event</u> argument of <u>aria2.onDownloadStart()</u> method.

       <b>aria2.onBtDownloadComplete(event)</b>
              This  notification will be sent when a torrent download is complete but seeding is still going on.
              The <u>event</u> is the same struct as the <u>event</u> argument of <u>aria2.onDownloadStart()</u> method.

   <b>Sample</b> <b>XML-RPC</b> <b>Client</b> <b>Code</b>
       The following Ruby script adds <b><a href="http://localhost/aria2.tar.bz2">http://localhost/aria2.tar.bz2</a></b>  to  aria2c  (running  on  localhost)  with
       option <u>--dir=/downloads</u> and prints the RPC response:

          #!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?env">/usr/bin/env</a> ruby

          require 'xmlrpc/client'
          require 'pp'

          client=XMLRPC::Client.new2("<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:6800/rpc")

          options={ "dir" =&gt; "/downloads" }
          result=client.call("aria2.addUri", [ "<a href="http://localhost/aria2.tar.bz2">http://localhost/aria2.tar.bz2</a>" ], options)

          pp result

       If  you  are  a Python lover, you can use xmlrpclib (Python3 uses xmlrpc.client instead) to interact with
       aria2:

          import xmlrpclib
          from pprint import pprint

          s = xmlrpclib.ServerProxy("<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:6800/rpc")
          r = s.aria2.addUri(["<a href="http://localhost/aria2.tar.bz2">http://localhost/aria2.tar.bz2</a>"], {"dir":"/downloads"})
          pprint(r)

</pre><h4><b>MISC</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Console</b> <b>Readout</b>
       While downloading files, aria2 prints a readout to the console to show the progress of the downloads. The
       console readout looks like this:

          [#2089b0 400.0KiB/33.2MiB(1%) CN:1 DL:115.7KiB ETA:4m51s]

       This section describes what these numbers and strings mean.

       <b>#NNNNNN</b>
              The first 6 characters of the GID as a hex string. The GID is an  unique  ID  for  each  download,
              internal  to  aria2.  The  GID  is  particularly  useful when interacting with aria2 using the RPC
              interface.

       <b>X/Y(Z%)</b>
              Completed length, the total file length and its progress. If <u>--select-file</u> is used,  this  is  the
              sum of selected files.

       <b>SEED</b>   Share ratio when the aria2 is seeding a finished torrent.

       <b>CN</b>     The number of connections aria2 has established.

       <b>SD</b>     The number of seeders aria2 is connected to.

       <b>DL</b>     Download speed (bytes per second).

       <b>UL</b>     Upload speed (bytes per second) and the number of uploaded bytes.

       <b>ETA</b>    Expected time to finish the download.

       When  more  than  one download is in progress, some of the information described above will be omitted in
       order to show information for several downloads. And the overall download and upload speeds are shown  at
       the beginning of the line.

       When aria2 is allocating file space or validating checksums, it additionally prints the progress of these
       operations:

       <b>FileAlloc</b>
              GID, already allocated length and total length in bytes.

       <b>Checksum</b>
              GID, already validated length and total length in bytes.

       To   save   'dist/base-2.6.18.iso'   in    '/tmp/mydir/base.iso'    and    'dist/driver-2.6.18.iso'    in
       '/tmp/dir/driver.iso', use the following command:

          $ aria2c --dir=<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> --index-out=1=mydir/base.iso --index-out=2=dir/driver.iso file.torrent

   <b>Change</b> <b>the</b> <b>listening</b> <b>ports</b> <b>for</b> <b>incoming</b> <b>peer</b> <b>connections</b>
          $ aria2c --listen-port=7000-7001,8000 file.torrent

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Since  aria2  doesn't  configure  firewalls  or  routers  for port forwarding, it's up to you to do so
          manually.

   <b>Specify</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>seeding</b> <b>after</b> <b>torrent</b> <b>downloads</b> <b>finish</b>
          $ aria2c --seed-time=120 --seed-ratio=1.0 file.torrent

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          In the above example, the program stops seeding after 120 minutes since  download  completed  or  seed
          ratio reaches 1.0.

   <b>Throttle</b> <b>upload</b> <b>speed</b>
          $ aria2c --max-upload-limit=100K file.torrent

   <b>Enable</b> <b>IPv4</b> <b>DHT</b>
          $ aria2c --enable-dht --dht-listen-port=6881 file.torrent

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          DHT  uses  UDP. Since aria2 doesn't configure firewalls or routers for port forwarding, it's up to you
          to do it manually.

   <b>Enable</b> <b>IPv6</b> <b>DHT</b>
          $ aria2c --enable-dht6 --dht-listen-port=6881 --dht-listen-addr6=YOUR_GLOBAL_UNICAST_IPV6_ADDR

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          aria2 uses the same ports as IPv4 for IPv6.

   <b>Add</b> <b>and</b> <b>remove</b> <b>tracker</b> <b>URIs</b>
       Ignore  all  tracker  announce  URIs  defined  in  file.torrent  and  use  <b><a href="http://tracker1/announce">http://tracker1/announce</a></b>   and
       <b><a href="http://tracker2/announce">http://tracker2/announce</a></b> instead:

          $ aria2c --bt-exclude-tracker="*" --bt-tracker="<a href="http://tracker1/announce">http://tracker1/announce</a>,<a href="http://tracker2/announce">http://tracker2/announce</a>" file.torrent

   <b>More</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>HTTP</b> <b>features</b>
   <b>Load</b> <b>cookies</b>
          $ aria2c --load-cookies=cookies.txt "<a href="http://host/file.zip">http://host/file.zip</a>"

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          You can use Firefox/Mozilla/Chromium's cookie files without modification.

   <b>Resume</b> <b>download</b> <b>started</b> <b>by</b> <b>web</b> <b>browsers</b> <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>programs</b>
          $ aria2c -c -s2 "<a href="http://host/partiallydownloadedfile.zip">http://host/partiallydownloadedfile.zip</a>"

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This will only work when the initial download was not multi-segmented.

   <b>Client</b> <b>certificate</b> <b>authorization</b> <b>for</b> <b>SSL/TLS</b>
       Specify a PKCS12 file as follows:

          $ aria2c --certificate=/path/to/mycert.p12

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The  file  specified  in  <u>--certificate</u>  must  be  contain one PKCS12 encoded certificate and key. The
          password must be blank.

       Alternatively, if PEM files are supported, use a command like the following:

          $ aria2c --certificate=/path/to/mycert.pem --private-key=/path/to/mykey.pem https://host/file

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The file specified in <u>--private-key</u> must be decrypted; an encrypted key may cause undefined behavior.

   <b>Verify</b> <b>SSL/TLS</b> <b>servers</b> <b>using</b> <b>given</b> <b>CA</b> <b>certificates</b>
          $ aria2c --ca-certificate=/path/to/ca-certificates.crt --check-certificate https://host/file

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          This option is only available when aria2 was compiled against GnuTLS or OpenSSL.  WinTLS and  AppleTLS
          will  always use the system certificate store. Instead of <b>`--ca-certificate</b> install the certificate in
          that store.

   <b>RPC</b>
   <b>Encrypt</b> <b>RPC</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>with</b> <b>SSL/TLS</b>
       Specify a server PKC12 file:

          $ aria2c --enable-rpc --rpc-certificate=/path/to/server.p12 --rpc-secure

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The file specified in <u>--rpc-certificate</u> must be contain one PKCS12 encoded certificate  and  key.  The
          password must be blank.

       Alternatively, when PEM files are supported (GnuTLS and OpenSSL), specify the server certificate file and
       private key file as follows:

          $ aria2c --enable-rpc --rpc-certificate=/path/to/server.crt --rpc-private-key=/path/to/server.key --rpc-secure

   <b>And</b> <b>more</b> <b>advanced</b> <b>features</b>
   <b>Throttle</b> <b>the</b> <b>download</b> <b>speed</b>
       Per-download:

          $ aria2c --max-download-limit=100K file.metalink

       Overall:

          $ aria2c --max-overall-download-limit=100K file.metalink

   <b>Repair</b> <b>a</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>download</b>
          $ aria2c -V file.metalink

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          Repairing  damaged  downloads can be done efficiently when used with BitTorrent or Metalink with chunk
          checksums.

   <b>Drop</b> <b>connections</b> <b>if</b> <b>download</b> <b>speed</b> <b>is</b> <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>specified</b> <b>limit</b>
          $ aria2c --lowest-speed-limit=10K file.metalink

   <b>Parameterized</b> <b>URI</b> <b>support</b>
       You can specify set of parts:

          $ aria2c -P "http://{host1,host2,host3}/file.iso"

       You can specify numeric sequence:

          $ aria2c -Z -P "<a href="http://host/image">http://host/image</a>[000-100].png"

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          The -Z option is required if the URIs don't point to the same file, such as in the above example.

       You can specify step counter:

          $ aria2c -Z -P "<a href="http://host/image">http://host/image</a>[A-Z:2].png"

   <b>Verifying</b> <b>checksums</b>
          $ aria2c --checksum=sha-1=0192ba11326fe2298c8cb4de616f4d4140213837 <a href="http://example.org/file">http://example.org/file</a>

   <b>Parallel</b> <b>downloads</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>arbitrary</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>URIs,</b> <b>metalink,</b> <b>torrent</b>
          $ aria2c -j3 -Z "<a href="http://host/file1">http://host/file1</a>" file2.torrent file3.metalink

   <b>BitTorrent</b> <b>Encryption</b>
       Encrypt the whole payload using ARC4 (obfuscation):

          $ aria2c --bt-min-crypto-level=arc4 --bt-require-crypto=true file.torrent
