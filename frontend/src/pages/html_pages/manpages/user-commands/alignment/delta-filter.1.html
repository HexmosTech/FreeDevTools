       delta-filter - read a delta alignment file from either nucmer or promer and filters the alignments

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>delta-filter</b> [options]<u>&lt;deltafile&gt;</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-1</b>     1-to-1 alignment allowing for rearrangements (intersection of <b>-r</b> and <b>-q</b> alignments)

       <b>-g</b>     1-to-1 global alignment not allowing rearrangements

       <b>-h</b>     Display help information

       <b>-i</b> float
              Set the minimum alignment identity [0, 100], default 0

       <b>-l</b> int Set the minimum alignment length, default 0

       <b>-m</b>     Many-to-many alignment allowing for rearrangements (union of <b>-r</b> and <b>-q</b> alignments)

       <b>-q</b>     Maps each position of each query to its best hit in the reference, allowing for reference overlaps

       <b>-r</b>     Maps each position of each reference to its best hit in the query, allowing for query overlaps

       <b>-u</b> float      Set the minimum alignment uniqueness, i.e. percent of

              the alignment matching to unique reference AND query sequence [0, 100], default 0

       <b>-o</b> float
              Set  the  maximum alignment overlap for <b>-r</b> and <b>-q</b> options as a percent of the alignment length [0,
              100], default 100

       <b>-v</b>     Print the discarded alignments instead of those that pass filters

       <b>-b</b>     Maps duplications (XOR of <b>-r</b> and <b>-q</b> alignments, one or the other but not both)

       Reads a delta alignment file from either nucmer or  promer  and  filters  the  alignments  based  on  the
       command-line  switches,  leaving only the desired alignments which are output to stdout in the same delta
       format as the input. For multiple switches, order of operations is as follows: <b>-i</b> <b>-l</b> <b>-u</b> <b>-q</b> <b>-r</b>  <b>-g</b>  <b>-m</b>  <b>-1</b>
       <b>-b</b>.  If  an  alignment  is  excluded  by  a  preceding  operation,  it  will be ignored by the succeeding
       operations.

       An important distinction between the <b>-g</b> option and the  <b>-1</b>  and  <b>-m</b>  options  is  that  <b>-g</b>  requires  the
       alignments  to  be mutually consistent in their order, while the <b>-1</b> and <b>-m</b> options are not required to be
       mutually consistent and therefore tolerate translocations, inversions, etc.  In  general  cases,  the  <b>-m</b>
       option  is  the best choice, however <b>-1</b> can be handy for applications such as SNP finding which require a
       1-to-1 mapping. Finally, for mapping query contigs, or sequencing reads, to a reference genome,  use  <b>-q</b>.
       The  duplications  printed with the <b>-b</b> option are <b>-r</b> and <b>-q</b> alignments that are not present in the 1-to-1
       alignment. These alignments are also the difference between the <b>-1</b> and <b>-m</b> alignments

       The <b>-b</b> option originates from mugsy that provides a code copy of mummer  with  additional  patches.   The
       source can be found in SVN svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/mugsy/code/trunk
