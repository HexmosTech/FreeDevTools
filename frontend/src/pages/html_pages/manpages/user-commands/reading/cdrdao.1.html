</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>cdrdao</u> creates audio and data CD-Rs in disk-at-once (DAO) mode driven by a description file  called  <u>toc-</u>
       <u>file.</u>   In  DAO  mode it is possible to create non standard track pre-gaps that have other lengths than 2
       seconds and contain nonzero audio data. This is for example useful to divide live recordings into  tracks
       where 2 second gaps would be kind of irritating.

       Instead  of  a <u>toc-file</u> a cue file (used by a famous DOS/Windows mastering tool) may be used. See the CUE
       FILES section for more details.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The first argument must be one of the following commands:

       <b>show-toc</b>
              Print out a summary about what will be written to the CD-R.

       <b>toc-info</b>
              Prints out short toc-file summary.

       <b>toc-size</b>
              Prints total number of blocks for toc.

       <b>read-toc</b>
              Analyze each track of the inserted CD and create a <u>toc-file</u> that can be used to  make  a  more  or
              less  exact  copy of the CD.  This command does not read out the audio or data tracks, use <b>read-cd</b>
              for this purpose.

              You can specify a filename for the data file via the <b>--datafile</b> option.

       <b>read-cd</b>
              Copies all tracks of the inserted CD to an image file and creates a corresponding  <u>toc-file.</u>   The
              name of the image file defaults to "data.bin" if no <b>--datafile</b> option is given.

       <b>read-cddb</b>
              Tries  to  retrieve  title  and artist data from a CDDB server for the CD represented by the given
              toc-file. The retrieved data is added as CD-TEXT data for language 0 to the toc-file. Existing CD-
              TEXT data for language 0 will be overwritten.

       <b>show-data</b>
              Print out all samples that would be written to the CD-R. Each  line  contains  the  sample  number
              (starting  at  0)  and the decimal sample value for the left and right channel. Useful to check if
              the byte order of audio files is correct.

       <b>read-test</b>
              Check if all data can be read from the audio files that are defined in the  <u>toc-file.</u>   This  will
              also check the communication with the slave process that is responsible for writing the audio data
              to the CD-recorder. Mainly used for testing.

       <b>disk-info</b>
              Shows  information about the inserted CD-R. If the CD-R has an open session it will also print the
              start of the last and current session which is used by mkisofs to create an image for a second  or
              higher session.

       <b>discid</b> Prints out CDDB information.

       <b>msinfo</b> Shows  information required for creating multi session disks with mkisofs. The output is meant for
              processing by scripts.

       <b>drive-info</b>
              Shows drive information.

       <b>unlock</b> Tries to unlock the recorder device after a failed write or simulation run. If  you  cannot  eject
              the CD after a cdrdao run try this command.

       <b>blank</b>  Blanks  a  CD-RW.  The  CD-RW  is  minimally blanked by default. Use option <b>--blank-mode</b> to select
              another blanking mode.  Sometimes the blanking speed must be manually  reduced  for  a  successful
              blanking operation. Use option <b>--speed</b> to select another blanking speed.

       <b>scanbus</b>
              Scan for devices.

       <b>simulate</b>
              Like <b>write</b> but laser stays cold. It is a shortcut for <b>write</b> <b>--simulate.</b>

       <b>write</b>  Write the CD-R according to the specifications in the <u>toc-file.</u>

       <b>copy</b>   Performs all steps to copy a CD. The device containing the source CD must be specified with option
              <b>--source-device</b>  and  the  recorder  device  with  option  <b>--device.</b>   If  only a single device is
              available the option <b>--source-device</b> must be omitted and cdrdao will prompt  to  insert  the  CD-R
              after an image of the source CD was created.

              The  image file with name "cddata&lt;pid&gt;.bin" will be created in the current working directory if no
              <b>--datafile</b> option is given. The created image will be removed after it has been written.

              If option <b>--on-the-fly</b> is given no image file is created and the data will be directly piped  from
              the reading device to the CD recorder.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--device</b> <u>[prot:]bus,id,lun</u>
              Sets  the  SCSI  address  of  the CD-recorder in form of a bus/id/lun triple, e.g. '0,2,0' for the
              logical unit 0 of SCSI device with ID 2 on bus 0. ATAPI devices can  be  specified  by  using  the
              prefix 'ATAPI:', e.g. 'ATAPI:0,0,0'. On some systems a device node may be specified directly, e.g.
              '/dev/sg0'  on  Linux  systems.  Linux  2.6  users may also try the newer ATAPI interface with the
              'ATA:' prefix.

       <b>--source-device</b> <u>[prot:]bus,id,lun</u>
              Like above but used for the <b>copy</b> command to specify the source device.

       <b>--driver</b> <u>driver-id:option-flags</u>
              Force usage of specified driver instead of the automatically determined driver.  Available  driver
              IDs:
              cdd2600,  plextor,  plextor-scan, generic-mmc, generic-mmc-raw, ricoh-mp6200, yamaha-cdr10x, teac-
              cdr55, sony-cdu920, sony-cdu948, taiyo-yuden, toshiba.
              Specifying an illegal driver ID will give a list of available drivers.  Option flags may  be  used
              to modify the behavior of some drivers. See <b>README</b> for details.

       <b>--source-driver</b> <u>driver-id:option-flags</u>
              Like above but used for the device specified with option <b>--source-device.</b>

       <b>--speed</b> <u>value</u>
              Set the writing speed to <u>value.</u>  Default is the highest possible speed.

       <b>--blank-mode</b> <u>mode</u>
              Sets  the  blanking  mode. Available modes are <b>full</b> and <b>minimal.</b>  Please consider that the data of
              minimally blanked disks may be easily recovered. Use the <b>full</b> blanking mode for completely erasing
              all data. The default blanking mode is <b>minimal.</b>

       <b>--datafile</b> <u>file</u>
              Used for <b>read-toc,</b> <b>read-cd</b> and <b>copy.</b>  Set the default data file placed in the  toc-file  by  <b>read-</b>
              <b>toc.</b>   Use  "-"  to  indicate  STDIN.   For commands <b>read-cd</b> and <b>copy</b> it specifies the name of the
              created image file.

       <b>--read-raw</b>
              Only used for commands <b>read-cd</b> and <b>read-toc.</b>  All data sectors will be written as 2352 byte blocks
              including the sector header and L-EC data to the image  file.  The  track  mode  will  be  set  to
              MODE1_RAW or MODE2_RAW in the created <u>toc-file.</u>

       <b>--read-subchan</b> <u>mode</u>
              Used  by  commands  <b>read-cd,</b>  <b>read-toc</b>  and  <b>copy.</b>  Specifies the type of sub-channel data that is
              extracted from the source CD and written to the track image or copied to the destination CD.  Mode
              may be <b>rw</b> for reading packed R-W sub-channel data (de-interleaved and error corrected) and  <b>rw_raw</b>
              for  reading raw R-W sub-channel data (not de-interleaved, not error corrected, L-EC data included
              in the track image).  If this option is not specified no sub-channel data will be extracted.

       <b>--no-mode2-mixed</b>
              Only used for commands <b>read-cd</b> and <b>read-toc.</b>  If we have MODE2_FORM1 or MODE2_FORM2, don't extract
              it as MODE2_FORM_MIX.  <u>toc-file.</u>

       <b>--tao-source</b>
              This option indicates to the commands <u>read-toc</u> and <u>read-cd</u> that the source CD was written  in  TAO
              mode.  It  will  be  assumed  that the pre-gap length between all tracks (except between two audio
              tracks) is the standard 150 blocks plus the number of link blocks (usually 2). The number of  link
              blocks can be controlled with option <u>--tao-source-adjust.</u>

              Use  this  option  only if <u>read-toc</u> or <u>read-cd</u> give error messages in the transition areas between
              two tracks. If you use this option with pressed CDs or CDs written in DAO mode you will get  wrong
              results.

       <b>--tao-source-adjust</b> <u>link-blocks</u>
              Specifies the number of link blocks for tracks written in TAO mode. This option has only an effect
              if option <u>--tao-source</u> is given.

       <b>--fast-toc</b>
              Only  used  for  command  <b>read-toc.</b>   This  option  suppresses  the  pre-gap length and index mark
              extraction which speeds up the read-toc process. Standard 2 second pre-gaps (but no silence!) will
              be placed into the toc-file. The resulting CD will sound like the source CD. Only the CD  player's
              display will behave slightly different in the transition area between two tracks.

              This option might help, too, if read-toc fails with your drive otherwise.

       <b>--buffers</b> <u>buffer-count</u>
              Specifies the number of buffers that are allocated to avoid buffer under runs.  The minimal buffer
              count  is  fixed  to  10,  default  is 32 except on FreeBSD systems, on which default is 20.  Each
              buffer holds 1 second of audio data so that dividing <u>buffer-count</u> by the writing speed  gives  the
              maximum time for which reading of audio data may be stalled.

       <b>--multi</b>
              If  this  option  is  given  the  session  will not be closed after the audio data is successfully
              written. It is possible to append another session on such disks, e.g. to create a CD-EXTRA.

       <b>--overburn</b>
              By default cdrdao will not allow one to write more data on a medium than specified by the  current
              medium. This option allows one to ignore this condition.

       <b>--eject</b>
              Eject the CD-R after writing or write simulation.

       <b>--swap</b> Swap the byte order of all samples that are send to the CD-recorder.

       <b>--session</b> <u>session-nr</u>
              Used  for  <b>read-toc</b>  and <b>read-cd</b> to specify the session which should be processed on multi session
              CDs.

       <b>--reload</b>
              Indicates that the tray may be opened before writing without prompting the user to reset the  disk
              status after a simulation run.

       <b>--force</b>
              Forces the execution of an operation that otherwise would not be performed.

       <b>--paranoia-mode</b> <u>mode</u>
              Sets  the  correction  mode  for digital audio extraction. 0: No checking, data is copied directly
              from the drive. 1: Perform overlapped reading to avoid jitter.  2:  Like  1  but  with  additional
              checks of the read audio data. 3: Like 2 but with additional scratch detection and repair.

              The extraction speed reduces from 0 to 3.

              Default is the full paranoia mode (3).

       <b>--keepimage</b>
              If  a  CD is copied with command <u>copy</u> this option will cause that the created image is not removed
              after the copy process has finished.

       <b>--on-the-fly</b>
              Perform CD copy on the fly without creating an image file.

       <b>--with-cddb</b>
              Enables the automatic fetching of CDDB data for use as CD-TEXT data for  commands  <u>copy,</u>  <u>read-toc</u>
              and <u>read-cd.</u>

       <b>--cddb-servers</b> <u>server-list</u>
              Sets  space or ',' separated list of CDDB servers used for command <u>read-cddb</u> or for commands where
              the <u>--with-cddb</u> option is active.  A server entry may have the following forms:

       &lt;server&gt;
              Connect to &lt;server&gt;, default cddbp port (888), use cddbp protocol.

       &lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;
              Connect to &lt;server&gt;, port &lt;port&gt;, use cddbp protocol.

       &lt;server&gt;:&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;
              Connect to &lt;server&gt;, default http port (80), use http protocol, url: &lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;.

       &lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;:&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;
              Connect to &lt;server&gt;, port &lt;port&gt;, use http protocol, url: &lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;.

       &lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;:&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;:&lt;proxy-server&gt;
              Connect   to   &lt;proxy-server&gt;,   default   http   port   (80),    use    http    protocol,    url:
              http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;.

       &lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;:&lt;cgi-bin-path&gt;:&lt;proxy-server&gt;:&lt;proxy-port&gt;
              Connect to &lt;proxy-server&gt;, port &lt;proxy-port&gt;, use http protocol, url: http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;cgi-
              bin-path&gt;.

              The &lt;cgi-bin-path&gt; is usually "/~cddb/cddb.cgi".

              All  servers of the server list will be tried in the given order until a successful connection can
              be established. For http proxy servers the first successful connected http proxy  server  will  be
              used independent of the ability to connect to the target http server.

              Example: freedb.freedb.org:/~cddb/cddb.cgi

       <b>--cddb-timeout</b> <u>timeout</u>
              Sets the timeout in seconds used for connections to CDDB servers.

       <b>--cddb-directory</b> <u>directory</u>
              Specifies  the  local  CDDB  database directory where fetched CDDB records will be stored. If this
              option is not given a fetched CDDB record will not be stored locally.

       <b>--tmpdir</b> <u>directory</u>
              Specifies the directory in which to store temporary data files created from decoding MP3  and  Ogg
              Vorbis files. By default, "<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>" is used.

       <b>--keep</b> Upon exit from cdrdao, do not delete temporary WAV files created from MP3 and Ogg Vorbis files.

       <b>--save</b> Saves  some  of  the  current  options to the settings file "$HOME/.cdrdao" and exits. See section
              SETTINGS for more details.

       <b>-n</b>     Suppresses the 10 second pause before writing or simulating.

       <b>-v</b> <u>verbose-level</u>
              Sets verbose level. Levels &gt; 2 are debug levels which produce a lot of output.

</pre><h4><b>TOC</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>toc-file</u> describes what data is written to the CD-R and allows control  over  track/index  positions,
       pre-gaps  and  sub-channel information. It is a simple text file, use your favorite text editor to create
       it.

       A <u>toc-file</u> contains an optional header and a sequence of track  specifications.  Comments  starting  with
       '//' reaching until end of line can be placed anywhere.

   <b>Header</b>
       CATALOG "ddddddddddddd"
              Specifies the optional catalog number of the CD. The string must contain exactly 13 digits.

       The  following  flags  specify the type of session that will be created. It is used to create the correct
       CD-TOC format and to check the consistency of the track modes for the desired session type.  If  multiple
       flags are given the last one will take effect.

       CD_DA  The disc contains only audio tracks.

       CD_ROM The disc contains just mode 1 tracks or mode 1 and audio tracks (mixed mode CD).

       CD_ROM_XA
              The  disc contains mode 2 form 1 or mode 2 form 2 tracks. Audio tracks are allowed, too. This type
              must be used if multi session disks are created (option --multi).

       CD_TEXT { ... }
              Defines global CD-TEXT data like the album title and the used languages.  See the CD-TEXT  section
              below for the syntax of the CD-TEXT block contents.

   <b>Track</b> <b>Specification</b>
       TRACK &lt;track-mode&gt; [&lt;sub-channel-mode&gt;]
              Starts a new track, the track number is incremented by 1. The length of a track must be at least 4
              seconds.  The  block  length of the input data depends on the &lt;track-mode&gt;: AUDIO: 2352 bytes (588
              samples), MODE1: 2048 bytes, MODE1_RAW: 2352 bytes, MODE2: 2336 bytes,  MODE2_FORM1:  2048  bytes,
              MODE2_FORM2:  2324  bytes,  MODE2_FORM_MIX:  2336  bytes including the sub-header, MODE2_RAW: 2352
              bytes.  The &lt;sub-channel-mode&gt; is optional. If given it specifies the type of sub-channel data for
              each sector. RW: packed R-W sub-channel data (96 bytes, L-EC data will be generated if  required),
              RW_RAW:  raw  R-W  sub-channel  data (interleaved and L-EC data already calculated, 96 bytes). The
              block length is increased by the sub-channel data length if a &lt;sub-channel-mode&gt; is specified.  If
              the input data length is not a multiple of the block length  it will be padded with zeros.

       The following flags may follow the track start statement. They are used to  set  sub-channel  information
       for  the  current  track.  Each  flag is optional. If not given the following defaults are used: copy not
       permitted, no pre emphasis, two channel audio, no ISRC code.

       [ NO ] COPY
              Sets or clears the copy permitted flag.

       [ NO ] PRE_EMPHASIS
              Sets or clears the pre emphasis flag (only for audio tracks).

       TWO_CHANNEL_AUDIO
              Indicates that track contains two channel audio data (only for audio tracks).

       FOUR_CHANNEL_AUDIO
              Indicates that track contains four channel audio data (only for audio tracks).

       ISRC "CCOOOYYSSSSS"
              Sets ISRC code of track (only for audio tracks).
              C: country code (upper case letters or digits)
              O: owner code (upper case letters or digits)
              Y: year (digits)
              S: serial number (digits)

       An optional CD-TEXT block that defines the CD-TEXT data for  this  track  may  follow.  See  the  CD-TEXT
       section below for the syntax of the CD-TEXT block contents.

       CD_TEXT { ... }

       At  least  one of the following statements must appear to specify the data for the current track. Lengths
       and start positions may be expressed in samples (1/44100 seconds) for audio tracks or in bytes  for  data
       tracks.  It  is  also  possible  to  give  the length in blocks with the MSF format 'MM:SS:FF' specifying
       minutes, seconds and frames (0 &lt;= 'FF' &lt; 75) . A frame equals one block.

       If more than one statement is used the track will be composed by concatenating the data in the  specified
       order.

       SILENCE &lt;length&gt;
              Adds zero audio data of specified length to the current audio track.  Useful to create silent pre-
              gaps.

       ZERO &lt;length&gt;
              Adds  zero  data  to  data  tracks.  Must  be  used  to define pre- or post-gaps between tracks of
              different mode.

       [ FILE | AUDIOFILE ] "&lt;filename&gt;" &lt;start&gt; [ &lt;length&gt; ]
              Adds the audio data of specified file to the current audio track.  It  is  possible  to  select  a
              portion of an audio file with &lt;start&gt; and &lt;length&gt; which allows non destructive cutting. The first
              sample  of  an  audio  file  is addressed with &lt;start&gt; = 0. If &lt;length&gt; is omitted or set to 0 all
              audio data from &lt;start&gt; until the end of file is used.

              Audio files may have raw or WAVE format with 16 bits per sample, 44.1 kHz sampling  rate,  stereo.
              Raw  files  must  have the layout 'MSBLeft LSBLeft MSBRight LSBRight ...' (big endian byte order).
              WAVE files are expected to have little endian byte order. The option --swap reverses the  expected
              byte  order  for  all  raw and WAVE files. Only filenames with a ".wav" ending are treated as WAVE
              files, all other names are assumed to be raw audio files. Use tools like <a href="../man1/sox.1.html">sox</a>(1) to  convert  other
              file formats to supported formats.

              Specifying  a  "-"  as  filename  causes  data to be read from STDIN. Currently only raw files are
              supported from STDIN.

              If you are unsure about the byte order of your audio files try the  command  'show-data'.  If  the
              byte  order  is  correct  you  will  see  a  sequence of increasing or decreasing numbers for both
              channels. Otherwise numbers are jumping between very high and low values - high volume static.

       DATAFILE "&lt;filename&gt;" [ &lt;length&gt; ]
              Adds data from given file to the current data track. If &lt;length&gt; is omitted the actual file length
              will be used.

       FIFO "&lt;fifo path&gt;" &lt;length&gt;
              Adds data from specified FIFO path to the current audio or data track.  &lt;length&gt; must specify  the
              amount  of  data  that  will  be read from the FIFO. The value is always in terms of bytes (scalar
              value) or in terms of the block length (MSF value).

       START [ MM:SS:FF ]
              Defines the length of the pre-gap (position where index switches from 0 to 1). If the MSF value is
              omitted the current track length is used. If the current track length is not  a  multiple  of  the
              block length the pre-gap length will be rounded up to next block boundary.

              If no START statement is given the track will not have a pre-gap.

       PREGAP MM:SS:FF
              This is an alternate way to specify a pre-gap with zero audio data. It may appear before the first
              SILENCE,  ZERO or FILE statement. Either PREGAP or START can be used within a track specification.
              It is equivalent to the sequence
                SILENCE MM:SS:FF
                START
              for audio tracks or
                ZERO MM:SS:FF
                START
              for data tracks.

       Nothing prevents mixing 'DATAFILE'/'ZERO' and 'AUDIOFILE'/'SILENCE' statements within the same track. The
       results, however, are undefined.

       The end of a track specification may contain zero or more index increment statements:

       INDEX MM:SS:FF
              Increments the index number at given position within the track. The first statement will increment
              from 1 to 2. The position is relative to the real track start, not counting an existing pre-gap.

   <b>CD-TEXT</b> <b>Blocks</b>
       A CD-TEXT block may be placed in the global section to define data valid for the whole  CD  and  in  each
       track  specification  of a <u>toc-file.</u>  The global section must define a language map that is used to map a
       <u>language-number</u> to country codes. Up to 8 different languages can be defined:

       LANGUAGE_MAP { 0 : c1  1 : c2  ...  7 : c7 }
              The country code may be an integer value in the range 0..255 or one  of  the  following  countries
              (the corresponding integer value is placed in braces behind the token): EN(9, English)
              It is just necessary to define a mapping for the used languages.

       If no mapping exists for a <u>language-number</u> the data for this language will be ignored.

       For each language a language block must exist that defines the actual data for a certain language.

       LANGUAGE language-number { cd-text-item cd-text-data cd-text-item cd-text-data ... }
              Defines the CD-TEXT items for given <u>language-number</u> which must be defined in the language map.

       The <u>cd-text-data</u> may be either a string enclosed by " or binary data like
            { 0, 10, 255, ... }
       where each integer number must be in the range 0..255.
       The <u>cd-text-item</u> may be one of the following:

       TITLE  String data: Title of CD or track.

       PERFORMER
              String data.

       SONGWRITER
              String data.

       COMPOSER
              String data.

       ARRANGER
              String data.

       MESSAGE
              String data. Message to the user.

       DISC_ID
              String data: Should only appear in the global CD-TEXT block. The format is usually: XY12345

       GENRE  Mixture  of  binary  data  (genre  code) and string data. Should only appear in the global CD-TEXT
              block. Useful entries will be created by <u>gcdmaster.</u>

       TOC_INFO1
              Binary data: Optional table of contents 1. Should only appear in the global CD-TEXT block.

       TOC_INFO2
              Binary data: Optional table of contents 2. Should only appear in the global CD-TEXT block.

       UPC_EAN
              String data: This item should only appear in the global CD-TEXT block. Was always an empty  string
              on the CD-TEXT CDs I had access to.

       ISRC   String data: ISRC code of track. The format is usually: CC-OOO-YY-SSSSS

       SIZE_INFO
              Binary  data: Contains summary about all CD-TEXT data and should only appear in the global CD-TEXT
              block. The data will be automatically (re)created when the CD-TEXT data is written.

              If one of the CD-TEXT items TITLE, PERFORMER, SONGWRITER, COMPOSER, ARRANGER, ISRC is defined  for
              at  least  on  track  or in the global section it must be defined for all tracks and in the global
              section. If a DISC_ID item is defined in the global section, an ISRC entry  must  be  defined  for
              each track.

</pre><h4><b>CUE</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Cue files may be used wherever a <u>toc-file</u> is expected. The corresponding bin file is not taken  from  the
       FILE  statement  of  a cue file but constructed from the cue file name by replacing ".cue" by ".bin". The
       cue file must have exactly one FILE statement.

       Currently, following track modes are  supported:  MODE1/2048,  MODE1/2352,  MODE2/2336,  MODE2/2352.  The
       CATALOG, ISRC and POSTGAP statements are parsed but not evaluated, yet.

</pre><h4><b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Some of the command line options can be stored as settings at following locations. The files will be read
       on startup of <u>cdrdao</u> in that order:

       1. /etc/cdrdao.conf

       2. /etc/defaults/cdrdao

       3. /etc/default/cdrdao

       4. $HOME/.cdrdao

       Command  line  options will overwrite the loaded settings.  The settings file contains name - value pairs
       separated by a colon. String values must be enclosed by ". The  file  is  automatically  written  if  the
       command  line  option  <u>--save</u> is used but it is also possible to modify it manually. Following values are
       defined:

       write_device
              Device used for operations <u>simulate,</u> <u>write,</u> <u>copy,</u>  <u>blank,</u>  <u>disk-info</u>  and  <u>unlock.</u>   Corresponding
              option: <u>--device</u>

       write_driver
              Driver  (including driver options) that is used for operations <u>simulate,</u> <u>write,</u> <u>copy,</u> <u>blank,</u> <u>disk-</u>
              <u>info</u> and <u>unlock.</u>  Corresponding option: <u>--driver</u>

              <u>--source-device</u>

       read_driver
              Driver  (including  driver options) used for operations <u>read-toc,</u> <u>read-cd</u> and <u>copy.</u>  Corresponding
              option: <u>--driver</u> or <u>--source-driver</u>

       read_paranoia_mode
              Paranoia mode used for operations <u>read-cd</u> <u>and</u> <u>copy.</u>  Corresponding option: <u>--paranoia-mode</u>

       cddb_server_list
              CDDB server list for <u>read-cddb.</u>  Corresponding option: <u>--cddb-servers</u>

       cddb_timeout
              CDDB connection timeout in seconds used by <u>read-cddb.</u>  Corresponding option: <u>--cddb-timeout</u>

       cddb_directory
              Local directory where fetched CDDB records will  be  stored,  used  by  <u>read-cddb.</u>   Corresponding
