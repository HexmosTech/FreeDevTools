</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       AnimateDeskChange

              That   setting   requests   nice   animation   to  be  drawn  over  the  desktop,  during  desktop
              switching.Comment it out to speed up desktop switching.

       AppsBackingStore

              Specifies that app windows should request backing store. X-terminals and low memory systems should
              avoid this as redrawing will be quicker than pulling the saved  image  from  swap  space.  Backing
              store will always be faster than redraw on machines that have enough memory. This causes non-ICCCM
              compliance.

       AutoFocus

              Do not use. Obsolete.

       AutoRaise <u>delay</u>

              Specifies the delay in milliseconds of focus a window must attain before being raised.

       AutoReverse <u>0|1|2</u>

              Specifies  the  window  Warping  (also called alt-tabbing) style. 0 (the default) causes switching
              among windows  in  one  direction.  1  causes  a  closed  loop  switching  -  #1-&gt;#2-&gt;#3-&gt;#4  then
              #4-&gt;#3-&gt;#2-&gt;#1. 2 causes an open loop switching - #1-&gt;#2-&gt;#3-&gt;#4 then #4-&gt;#1-&gt;#2-&gt;#3 etc.

       AutoTabThroughDesks

              In conjunction with AutoReverse, this will Warp (alt-tab) through windows on all desks.

       BackingStore

              Specifies  that  decorations  should  request backing store. Refer to AppsBackingStore for further
              details.

       CenterOnCirculate

              Specifies that when Warping (alt-tabbing), the desktop page containing the  window  to  which  the
              pointer  is  moving will be automatically selected and afterstep will attempt to center the target
              window in the desktop viewport, rather than just flipping to the desktop the window resides in.

       CirculateSkipIcons

              Specifies that all icons should be skipped when Warping (alt- tabbing) between windows.

       ClickTime

              Specifies that afterstep should consider two mouse clicks made within delay milliseconds to  be  a
              double mouse click, and not two single mouse clicks. The default delay is 150 milliseconds.

       ClickToFocus

              Specifies  that the keyboard input (aka focus) stays with one window until a new window's TitleBar
              is clicked on, or gains focus through Warping or de-iconification.

              AfterStep will not switch focus following mouse pointer, but instead will switch it when window is
              explicitly clicked. This is the same as before. The only difference is  that  AfterStep  will  not
              Raise  window  automagically,  unless some other settings are set. Possible way to Raise window on
              focusing include:

              - set AutoRaise 0 in feel file ( delay of 0 )

              - bind mouse clicks to Raise or RaiseLower function in feel file.

              - set ClickToRaise flag in feel file.

       ClickToRaise

              Specifies that windows should be raised when a button is clicked  in  the  titlebar,  handle  (low
              bar),  or application area. buttons specifies the list of buttons which triggers this function. In
              AutoRaise mode this will simply raise the window if the click is before  the  delay  specified  in
              AutoRaise. In ClickToFocus mode, this will raise the window and give it focus.

       CoverAnimationSteps <u>steps</u> <u>count</u>

              CoverAnimationSteps  is  the  number  of  animation steps to take while removing blue-tinted cover
              window.

       CoverAnimationType <u>type</u>

              CoverAnimationType determines what type of animation to use  while  removing  blue-tinted  desktop
              cover - use values from 0 to 13.

       Cursor <u>cursor_number</u> <u>cursor_type</u>

              Specifies  the  <u>cursor_type</u> for the given <u>cursor_number</u> . Valid <u>cursor_numbers</u> are 0 though 10 and
              listed  in  all  the   shipped   <u>feel.name</u>   files.   The   <u>cursor_types</u>   are   listed   in   the
              /usr/include/X11/cursorfont.h file.

       CustomCursor <u>path</u>

              Adds  a custom cursor from the search paths. AfterStep searches the following paths in addition to
              the        system        Xorg/Xfree        paths:        <a href="file:~/.afterstep/desktop/cursors/">~/.afterstep/desktop/cursors/</a>         and
              $SHAREDIR/afterstep/desktop/cursors/.

              Note:  under  Xorg,  this  is  probably depreciated. Current Xorg uses the Xcursor library to load
              cursor data from a single file.

       DecorateTransients

              Specifies that transient windows (pop-up dialog boxes), which are normally not  decorated,  should
              be  given the usual title and low bars. Note: some pop-up windows and menus are not managed by the
              window manager, so do not get these decorations.

       DefaultWindowBox <u>"windowbox_name"</u>

              Window boxes are processed in order they were listed in config. If suitable windowbox could not be
              found for the window in the database file - then  windowbox  named  in  DefaultWindowBox  will  be
              forced.

       DeskAnimationSteps <u>steps</u>

              Specifies  how  many  animation  steps  should  be rendered while switching desktops/removing blue
              cover. Reduce that number to speedup animation.

       DeskAnimationType <u>value</u>

              This requests particular type of animation to be  rendered  while  switching  desktops.  Available
              values are in range of 0 to 12.

       DontMoveOff

              Specifies  that  windows  should  not  be  moved off or initially placed off of the desktop. A few
              programs will not work cor- rectly if you use this option. This  only  keeps  windows  from  being
              completely  lost  off the edge of the desktop. It insists on keeping 16 pixels on the desktop, but
              does not attempt to keep the entire window on the desk.

       DontRestoreFocus

              Will not restore focus to the recently focused application wile switching desktops.

       EdgeResistance <u>delay</u> <u>pixels</u>

              Specifies how hard it should be to change views within a desktop by moving the mouse over the edge
              of the screen, and how hard it hould be to move a window over the edge of a screen.

              The delay in milliseconds, defines how long the pointer must spend at the screen edge before  that
              view  becomes  current.  This is useful in conjunction with EdgeScroll 100 100, so the views don't
              get switched accidently.

              The pixels defines how far over the edge a window must "appear" to move before it  actually  moves
              partially off the screen.

              Note  that  with EdgeScroll 0 0, it is still possible to move or resize windows across the edge of
              the current screen. By setting the pixels parameter of  EdgeResistance  to  10000,  this  type  of
              motion  is  impossible.  However, with EdgeResistances less than 10000, but greater than 0, moving
              over pages becomes difficult but not impossible.

       EdgeScroll <u>horizontal</u> <u>vertical</u>

              Specifies the percentage of a page to scroll when the cursor hits the  edge  of  a  page.  Setting
              EdgeScroll  to 0 0 will disable scrolling. Setting this option to 100 100 will scroll whole pages.
              Set to 1000 1000, scrolling will wrap around at the edge  of  the  desktop.  Both  horizontal  and
              vertical should be positive numbers.

       FollowTitleChanges

              That  will force AfterStep to reread and merge all the hints and settings from the database files,
              whenever window changes either its name or icon name.

       Function

              Specifies a complex function definition and is covered in the built-in command/function.

              See Also: AS Function for further details.

       IconTitle

              Specifies that a title should be displayed under  an  iconified  app.  The  colors  used  are  the
              ForeColor  and  BackColor  of the ButtonTitleFocus in the look.name file. Note: less space is left
              for the app's icon, so it will be resized acordingly. Only a portion of the  icon  title  will  be
              displayed  until the icon gains focus, and then the title "box" will expand to reveal the window's
              entire name.

        <u>KeepIconWindows</u>

              Specifies that applications should be allowed to specify their own icon windows.

       Key <u>keyname</u>  <u>context</u>  <u>modifier</u>  <u>Command</u>

              Specifies a key-stroke binding definition, similar to <u>Mouse</u> . <u>keyname</u> is the  keyboard  key  name.
              Valid  <u>keyname</u>  's  are  found in the /usr/X11/include/X11/keysymdef.h file and are specified here
              without the leading "XK_". The <u>context</u> describes where the mouse is resting when  the  <u>keyname</u>  is
              pressed  and can be any combination of the following: R = Root window (main background) F = Window
              Frame (the BottomBar handle corners) S =  Window  TitleBar  or  BottomBar  I  =  Iconified  Button
              (minimized window icon) T = Window TitleBar W = Application Window A = Any of the above except for
              TitleButtons 1-10 = TitleButton number of the TitleBar [ not very useful here ]
               <u>modifier</u>  is the key-stroke combination associated with the <u>context</u> entry, to issue the <u>Command</u> .
              Valid <u>modifier</u> 's are:

                 N = No modifiers
                 C = Control
                 S = Shift
                 M = Meta
                 A = Any modifier

               <u>Command</u> can be any <b>afterstep</b>  <u>Built-in</u> command/ function, <u>Popup</u> or user defined <u>Function</u> .

              See Also: AS Function for further details.

       MenusHigh

              Specifies that any pop-up menu's submenu should appear at the top of the parent  menu  instead  of
              starting at the point in the parent window where the submenu item lies.

       Mouse <u>button</u>  <u>context</u>  <u>modifier</u>  <u>Command</u>

              Specifies a mouse binding definition. <u>button</u> is the mouse button number [0, 1, 2, or 3]. If <u>button</u>
              is  zero,  then  any  mouse  button invoked issues the <u>Command</u> . <u>context</u> describes where the mouse
              click occurred and can be any combination of the following:

                 R = Root window (main background)
                 F = Window Frame (the BottomBar handle corners)
                 S = Window TitleBar or BottomBar
                 I = Iconified Button (minimized window icon)
                 T = Window TitleBar
                 W = Application Window
                 A = Any of the above except for  TitleButtons  1-10  =  TitleButton  number  of  the  TitleBar,
              corresponds to the
                     entry in the  <u>look.name</u>  file

              The  action  to  be  taken by the defined TitleButton is defined in the <u>feel.name</u> file. Defining a
              TitleButton without having a corresponding entry in the <u>feel.name</u> file will cause the  TitleButton
              icon to be displayed, but not react when pressed.

               <u>modifier</u>  is the key-stroke combination associated with the <u>context</u> entry, to issue the <u>Command</u> .
              Valid <u>modifier</u> 's are:

                 N = No modifiers
                 C = Control
                 S = Shift
                 M = Meta
                 A = Any modifier

               <u>Command</u> can be any <b>afterstep</b>  <u>Built-in</u> command/ function, <u>Popup</u> or user defined <u>Function</u> .

              See Also: AS Function for further details.

       NoPPosition

              Species that afterstep should ignore the PPosition field when placing new windows, in other words,
              windows can't choose where to place themselves. Adherence to the PPosition field is  required  for
              some applications.

       NoSnapKey <u>key</u>

              AfterStep  now  has a feature that "snaps" windows to different desktop features, such as edges of
              other windows and edge of the screen. To disable it temorarily you can press and hold  Shift  key.
              Use this setting to request different modifier key instead of Shift.

       OpaqueMove <u>%</u>

              Specifies the maximum size window where opaque window movement should be used. % is percent of the
              total  screen area. Set to 0, all windows will be moved using the traditional rubber-band outline.
              Set to 100, all windows will be move as solid windows. The default is 5 which allows small windows
              to be moved in an opaque manner, but large windows to be moved as rubber-bands. Using this  option
              with large values can slow down video response on slower systems.

       OpaqueResize <u>%</u>

              Specifies  the maximum size window where opaque resizing should be used. % is percent of the total
              screen area. Set to 0, all windows will be resized using the traditional  rubber-band  out-  line.
              Set  to  100,  all  windows  will be resized as solid windows. The default is 5 which allows small
              windows to be resized in an opaque manner, but large windows to be resized as rubber-bands.  Using
              this option with large values can slow down video response on slower systems.

       PagingDefault <u>0|1</u>

              Specifies if Paging should be enabled (1) or disabled (0). Paging is set to enabled by default.

       PersistentMenus

              Right  now  if  you try to open a menu when its already opened - that will cause menu to close. To
              disable this behaviour and instead pop-up a menu again - use this setting.

       Popup

              Specifies a menu popup definition and is covered in the built-in command/function.

              See Also: AS Function for further details.

       RandomPlacement

              Specifies that windows  which  would  normally  require  user  inter-  vention  for  placement  be
              automagically placed in ever-so- slightly random locations.

       RecentSubmenuItems <u>number_of_items</u>

              Defines  maximum  number  of recently used submenu items to be listed under menu item. Set to 0 to
              disable feature. Default is 4.

       SaveUnders

              Specifies that afterstep frames should request saveunders. This will cause afterstep to save those
              portions of windows that are not visible to system memory.  This  can  significantly  improve  the
              performance  during  opaque  moves, but it causes a significant increase in memory usage. This can
              also cause garbled display with some applications.

       ScreenEdgeAttraction <u>distance</u>

              Defines distance from which window will be attracted to the screen edge, while being interactively
              moved/resized.

       ShadeAnimationSteps <u>steps</u>

              Defines how many steps to use to render animation when window gets shaded/unshaded.

       ShadeAnimationSteps <u>steps</u>

              Defines how many steps to use to render animation when window gets shaded/unshaded.

       SloppyFocus

              Specifies that windows retain focus until the mouse moves to another  window,  or  Warping  causes
              another window to gain focus.

              SloppyFocus has no effect if ClickToFocus is also specified.

       SmartPlacement

              Specifies  that  windows  be  placed  in  areas  that  no  other  windows  occupy,  otherwise user
              intervention becomes required for placement. Have fun, try specifying both. :-)

       StickyIcons

              Specifies that icons should stick to the  screen's  glass  and  fol-  low  it  from  desk/view  to
              desk/view.

       StubbornIconPlacement

              Specifies  that  icons  should avoid being hidden behind windows placed over the IconBox by moving
              themselves around (dancing icons).

       StubbornIcons

              Specifies that icons should uniconify to their original desk. By default, icons uniconify  to  the
              current desk.

       StubbornPlacement

              Specifies that new windows should avoid being placed over icons.

       SuppressIcons

              Specifies that no icon should be shown for any window being iconified, similar to NoIcon.

       WinListHideIcons

              When  set,  Icons  in  internal  WindowList  (  the window that pops up if you right click on root
              window) will not be shown.

       WinListSortOrder <u>0/1/2/3</u>

              Arranges WinList entries based-on the following qualifiers: 0 - circulations order (default), 1  -
              Alpha order, 2 - Stacking order (unimplemented), 3 - creation order (unimplemented).

       WindowBox <u>"windowbox_name"</u>

              WindowBox  defines  an  area  on  the screen/virtual desktop into which a window will be placed on
              startup.

              See Also: Feel WindowBox definition for further details.

       WindowEdgeAttraction <u>distance</u>

              Defines distance from which window will be attracted to  the  other  window's  edge,  while  being
              interactively moved/resized.

        <u>XorValue</u> <u>value</u>

              Specifies  the  <u>value</u> with which bits are XOR'ed when doing rubber-band window moving or resizing.
              Setting this value is a trial-and-error process.

        <u>Xzap</u> <u>number</u>

              Specifies the horizontal offset of the cursor  when  warping.  This  offset  is  relative  to  the
              upper-left corner of the window being warped to.

        <u>Yzap</u> <u>number</u>

              Specifies  the  vertical  offset  of  the  cursor  when  warping.  This  offset is relative to the
              upper-left corner of the window being warped to.
