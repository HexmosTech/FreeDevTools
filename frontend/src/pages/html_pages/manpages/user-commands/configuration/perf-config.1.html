</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       perf-config - Get and set variables in a configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>perf</u> <u>config</u> [&lt;file-option&gt;] [section.name[=value] ...]
       or
       <u>perf</u> <u>config</u> [&lt;file-option&gt;] -l | --list

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       You can manage variables in a configuration file with this command.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -l, --list
           Show current config variables, name and value, for all sections.

       --user
           For writing and reading options: write to user <u>$HOME/.perfconfig</u> file or read it.

       --system
           For writing and reading options: write to system-wide <u>$(sysconfdir)/perfconfig</u> or read it.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The perf configuration file contains many variables to change various aspects of each of its tools,
       including output, disk usage, etc. The <u>$HOME/.perfconfig</u> file is used to store a per-user configuration.
       The file <u>$(sysconfdir)/perfconfig</u> can be used to store a system-wide default configuration.

       One can disable reading config files by setting the PERF_CONFIG environment variable to /dev/null, or
       provide an alternate config file by setting that variable.

       When reading or writing, the values are read from the system and user configuration files by default, and
       options <u>--system</u> and <u>--user</u> can be used to tell the command to read from or write to only that location.

   <b>Syntax</b>
       The file consist of sections. A section starts with its name surrounded by square brackets and continues
       till the next section begins. Each variable must be in a section, and have the form <u>name</u> <u>=</u> <u>value</u>, for
       example:

           [section]
                   name1 = value1
                   name2 = value2

       Section names are case sensitive and can contain any characters except newline (double quote " and
       backslash have to be escaped as \" and \\, respectively). Section headers can’t span multiple lines.

   <b>Example</b>
       Given a $HOME/.perfconfig like this:

       # # This is the config file, and # a <u>#</u> and <u>;</u> character indicates a comment #

           [colors]
                   # Color variables
                   top = red, default
                   medium = green, default
                   normal = lightgray, default
                   selected = white, lightgray
                   jump_arrows = blue, default
                   addr = magenta, default
                   root = white, blue

           [tui]
                   # Defaults if linked with libslang
                   report = on
                   annotate = on
                   top = on

           [buildid]
                   # Default, disable using /dev/null
                   dir = <a href="file:~/.debug">~/.debug</a>

           [annotate]
                   # Defaults
                   hide_src_code = false
                   use_offset = true
                   jump_arrows = true
                   show_nr_jumps = false

           [help]
                   # Format can be man, info, web or html
                   format = man
                   autocorrect = 0

           [ui]
                   show-headers = true

           [call-graph]
                   # fp (framepointer), dwarf
                   record-mode = fp
                   print-type = graph
                   order = caller
                   sort-key = function

           [report]
                   # Defaults
                   sort_order = comm,dso,symbol
                   percent-limit = 0
                   queue-size = 0
                   children = true
                   group = true
                   skip-empty = true

       You can hide source code of annotate feature setting the config to false with

           % perf config annotate.hide_src_code=true

       If you want to add or modify several config items, you can do like

           % perf config ui.show-headers=false kmem.default=slab

       To modify the sort order of report functionality in user config file(i.e. <a href="file:~/.perfconfig">~/.perfconfig</a>), do

           % perf config --user report.sort-order=srcline

       To change colors of selected line to other foreground and background colors in system config file (i.e.
       $(sysconf)/perfconfig), do

           % perf config --system colors.selected=yellow,green

       To query the record mode of call graph, do

           % perf config call-graph.record-mode

       If you want to know multiple config key/value pairs, you can do like

           % perf config report.queue-size call-graph.order report.children

       To query the config value of sort order of call graph in user config file (i.e. <a href="file:~/.perfconfig">~/.perfconfig</a>), do

           % perf config --user call-graph.sort-order

       To query the config value of buildid directory in system config file (i.e. $(sysconf)/perfconfig), do

           % perf config --system buildid.dir

   <b>Variables</b>
       colors.*
           The variables for customizing the colors used in the output for the <u>report</u>, <u>top</u> and <u>annotate</u> in the
           TUI. They should specify the foreground and background colors, separated by a comma, for example:

               medium = green, lightgray

               If you want to use the color configured for you terminal, just leave it
               as 'default', for example:

               medium = default, lightgray

               Available colors:
               red, yellow, green, cyan, gray, black, blue,
               white, default, magenta, lightgray

       colors.top
           <u>top</u> means a overhead percentage which is more than 5%. And values of this variable specify percentage
           colors. Basic key values are foreground-color <u>red</u> and background-color <u>default</u>.

       colors.medium
           <u>medium</u> means a overhead percentage which has more than 0.5%. Default values are <u>green</u> and <u>default</u>.

       colors.normal
           <u>normal</u> means the rest of overhead percentages except <u>top</u>, <u>medium</u>, <u>selected</u>. Default values are
           <u>lightgray</u> and <u>default</u>.

       colors.selected
           This selects the colors for the current entry in a list of entries from sub-commands (top, report,
           annotate). Default values are <u>black</u> and <u>lightgray</u>.

       colors.jump_arrows
           Colors for jump arrows on assembly code listings such as <u>jns</u>, <u>jmp</u>, <u>jane</u>, etc. Default values are
           <u>blue</u>, <u>default</u>.

       colors.addr
           This selects colors for addresses from <u>annotate</u>. Default values are <u>magenta</u>, <u>default</u>.

       colors.root
           Colors for headers in the output of a sub-commands (top, report). Default values are <u>white</u>, <u>blue</u>.

       core.*, core.proc-map-timeout
           Sets a timeout (in milliseconds) for parsing <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;/maps files. Can be overridden by the
           --proc-map-timeout option on supported subcommands. The default timeout is 500ms.

       tui.<b>,</b> <b>gtk.</b>
           Subcommands that can be configured here are <u>top</u>, <u>report</u> and <u>annotate</u>. These values are booleans, for
           example:

               [tui]
                       top = true

               will make the TUI be the default for the 'top' subcommand. Those will be
               available if the required libs were detected at tool build time.

       buildid.*, buildid.dir
           Each executable and shared library in modern distributions comes with a content based identifier
           that, if available, will be inserted in a <u>perf.data</u> file header to, at analysis time find what is
           needed to do symbol resolution, code annotation, etc.

               The recording tools also stores a hard link or copy in a per-user
               directory, $HOME/.debug/, of binaries, shared libraries, <a href="file:/proc/kallsyms">/proc/kallsyms</a>
               and <a href="file:/proc/kcore">/proc/kcore</a> files to be used at analysis time.

               The buildid.dir variable can be used to either change this directory
               cache location, or to disable it altogether. If you want to disable it,
               set buildid.dir to /dev/null. The default is $HOME/.debug

       buildid-cache.*
           buildid-cache.debuginfod=URLs Specify debuginfod URLs to be used when retrieving perf.data binaries,
           it follows the same syntax as the DEBUGINFOD_URLS variable, like:

               buildid-cache.debuginfod=<a href="http://192.168.122.174">http://192.168.122.174</a>:8002

       annotate.*
           These are in control of addresses, jump function, source code in lines of assembly code from a
           specific program.

       annotate.disassemblers
           Choose the disassembler to use: "objdump", "llvm", "capstone", if not specified it will first try, if
           available, the "llvm" one, then, if it fails, "capstone", and finally the original "objdump" based
           one.

               Choosing a different one is useful when handling some feature that
               is known to be best support at some point by one of the options,
               to compare the output when in doubt about some bug, etc.

               This can be a list, in order of preference, the first one that works
               finishes the process.

       annotate.addr2line
           addr2line binary to use for file names and line numbers.

       annotate.objdump
           objdump binary to use for disassembly and annotations, including in the <u>perf</u> <u>test</u> command.

       annotate.disassembler_style
           Use this to change the default disassembler style to some other value supported by binutils, such as
           "intel", see the <u>-M</u> option help in the <u>objdump</u> man page.

       annotate.hide_src_code
           If a program which is analyzed has source code, this option lets <u>annotate</u> print a list of assembly
           code with the source code. For example, let’s see a part of a program. There’re four lines. If this
           option is <u>true</u>, they can be printed without source code from a program as below.

               │        push   %rbp
               │        mov    %rsp,%rbp
               │        sub    $0x10,%rsp
               │        mov    (%rdi),%rdx

               But if this option is 'false', source code of the part
               can be also printed as below. Default is 'false'.

               │      struct rb_node *rb_next(const struct rb_node *node)
               │      {
               │        push   %rbp
               │        mov    %rsp,%rbp
               │        sub    $0x10,%rsp
               │              struct rb_node *parent;
               │
               │              if (RB_EMPTY_NODE(node))
               │        mov    (%rdi),%rdx
               │              return n;

               This option works with tui, stdio2 browsers.

       annotate.use_offset
           Basing on a first address of a loaded function, offset can be used. Instead of using original
           addresses of assembly code, addresses subtracted from a base address can be printed. Let’s illustrate
           an example. If a base address is 0XFFFFFFFF81624d50 as below,

               ffffffff81624d50 &lt;load0&gt;

               an address on assembly code has a specific absolute address as below

               ffffffff816250b8:│  mov    0x8(%r14),%rdi

               but if use_offset is 'true', an address subtracted from a base address is printed.
               Default is true. This option is only applied to TUI.

               368:│  mov    0x8(%r14),%rdi

               This option works with tui, stdio2 browsers.

       annotate.jump_arrows
           There can be jump instruction among assembly code. Depending on a boolean value of jump_arrows,
           arrows can be printed or not which represent where do the instruction jump into as below.

               │     ┌──jmp    1333
               │     │  xchg   %ax,%ax
               │1330:│  mov    %r15,%r10
               │1333:└─→cmp    %r15,%r14

               If jump_arrow is 'false', the arrows isn't printed as below.
               Default is 'false'.

               │      ↓ jmp    1333
               │        xchg   %ax,%ax
               │1330:   mov    %r15,%r10
               │1333:   cmp    %r15,%r14

               This option works with tui browser.

       annotate.show_linenr
           When showing source code if this option is <u>true</u>, line numbers are printed as below.

               │1628         if (type &amp; PERF_SAMPLE_IDENTIFIER) {
               │     ↓ jne    508
               │1628                 data-&gt;id = *array;
               │1629                 array++;
               │1630         }

               However if this option is 'false', they aren't printed as below.
               Default is 'false'.

               │             if (type &amp; PERF_SAMPLE_IDENTIFIER) {
               │     ↓ jne    508
               │                     data-&gt;id = *array;
               │                     array++;
               │             }

               This option works with tui, stdio2 browsers.

       annotate.show_nr_jumps
           Let’s see a part of assembly code.

               │1382:   movb   $0x1,-0x270(%rbp)

               If use this, the number of branches jumping to that address can be printed as below.
               Default is 'false'.

               │1 1382:   movb   $0x1,-0x270(%rbp)

               This option works with tui, stdio2 browsers.

       annotate.show_total_period
           To compare two records on an instruction base, with this option provided, display total number of
           samples that belong to a line in assembly code. If this option is <u>true</u>, total periods are printed
           instead of percent values as below.

               302 │      mov    %eax,%eax

               But if this option is 'false', percent values for overhead are printed i.e.
               Default is 'false'.

               99.93 │      mov    %eax,%eax

               This option works with tui, stdio2, stdio browsers.

       annotate.show_nr_samples
           By default perf annotate shows percentage of samples. This option can be used to print absolute
           number of samples. Ex, when set as false:

               Percent│
                74.03 │      mov    %fs:0x28,%rax

               When set as true:

               Samples│
                    6 │      mov    %fs:0x28,%rax

               This option works with tui, stdio2, stdio browsers.

       annotate.offset_level
           Default is <u>1</u>, meaning just jump targets will have offsets show right beside the instruction. When set
           to <u>2</u> <u>call</u> instructions will also have its offsets shown, 3 or higher will show offsets for all
           instructions.

               This option works with tui, stdio2 browsers.

       annotate.demangle
           Demangle symbol names to human readable form. Default is <u>true</u>.

       annotate.demangle_kernel
           Demangle kernel symbol names to human readable form. Default is <u>true</u>.

       hist.*, hist.percentage
           This option control the way to calculate overhead of filtered entries - that means the value of this
           option is effective only if there’s a filter (by comm, dso or symbol name). Suppose a following
           example:

               Overhead  Symbols
               ........  .......
                33.33%     foo
                33.33%     bar
                33.33%     baz

               This is an original overhead and we'll filter out the first 'foo'
               entry. The value of 'relative' would increase the overhead of 'bar'
               and 'baz' to 50.00% for each, while 'absolute' would show their
               current overhead (33.33%).

       ui.*, ui.show-headers
           This option controls display of column headers (like <u>Overhead</u> and <u>Symbol</u>) in <u>report</u> and <u>top</u>. If this
           option is false, they are hidden. This option is only applied to TUI.

       call-graph.*
           The following controls the handling of call-graphs (obtained via the -g/--call-graph options).

       call-graph.record-mode
           The mode for user space can be <u>fp</u> (frame pointer), <u>dwarf</u> and <u>lbr</u>. The value <u>dwarf</u> is effective only
           if libunwind (or a recent version of libdw) is present on the system; the value <u>lbr</u> only works for
           certain cpus. The method for kernel space is controlled not by this option but by the kernel config
           (CONFIG_UNWINDER_*).

       call-graph.dump-size
           The size of stack to dump in order to do post-unwinding. Default is 8192 (byte). When using dwarf
           into record-mode, the default size will be used if omitted.

       call-graph.print-type
           The print-types can be graph (graph absolute), fractal (graph relative), flat and folded. This option
           controls a way to show overhead for each callchain entry. Suppose a following example.

               Overhead  Symbols
               ........  .......
                 40.00%  foo
                         |
                         ---foo
                            |
                            |--50.00%--bar
                            |          main
                            |
                             --50.00%--baz
                                       main

               This output is a 'fractal' format. The 'foo' came from 'bar' and 'baz' exactly
               half and half so 'fractal' shows 50.00% for each
               (meaning that it assumes 100% total overhead of 'foo').

               The 'graph' uses absolute overhead value of 'foo' as total so each of
               'bar' and 'baz' callchain will have 20.00% of overhead.
               If 'flat' is used, single column and linear exposure of call chains.
               'folded' mean call chains are displayed in a line, separated by semicolons.

       call-graph.order
           This option controls print order of callchains. The default is <u>callee</u> which means callee is printed
           at top and then followed by its caller and so on. The <u>caller</u> prints it in reverse order.

               If this option is not set and report.children or top.children is
               set to true (or the equivalent command line option is given),
               the default value of this option is changed to 'caller' for the
               execution of 'perf report' or 'perf top'. Other commands will
               still default to 'callee'.

       call-graph.sort-key
           The callchains are merged if they contain same information. The sort-key option determines a way to
           compare the callchains. A value of <u>sort-key</u> can be <u>function</u> or <u>address</u>. The default is <u>function</u>.

       call-graph.threshold
           When there’re many callchains it’d print tons of lines. So perf omits small callchains under a
           certain overhead (threshold) and this option control the threshold. Default is 0.5 (%). The overhead
           is calculated by value depends on call-graph.print-type.

       call-graph.print-limit
           This is a maximum number of lines of callchain printed for a single histogram entry. Default is 0
           which means no limitation.

       report.*, report.sort_order
           Allows changing the default sort order from "comm,dso,symbol" to some other default, for instance
           "sym,dso" may be more fitting for kernel developers.

       report.percent-limit
           This one is mostly the same as call-graph.threshold but works for histogram entries. Entries having
           an overhead lower than this percentage will not be printed. Default is <u>0</u>. If percent-limit is <u>10</u>,
           only entries which have more than 10% of overhead will be printed.

       report.queue-size
           This option sets up the maximum allocation size of the internal event queue for ordering events.
           Default is 0, meaning no limit.

       report.children
           <u>Children</u> means functions called from another function. If this option is true, <u>perf</u> <u>report</u> cumulates
           callchains of children and show (accumulated) total overhead as well as <u>Self</u> overhead. Please refer
           to the <u>perf</u> <u>report</u> manual. The default is <u>true</u>.

       report.group
           This option is to show event group information together. Example output with this turned on, notice
           that there is one column per event in the group, ref-cycles and cycles:

               # group: {ref-cycles,cycles}
               # ========
               #
               # Samples: 7K of event 'anon group { ref-cycles, cycles }'
               # Event count (approx.): 6876107743
               #
               #         Overhead  Command      Shared Object               Symbol
               # ................  .......  .................  ...................
               #
                   99.84%  99.76%  noploop  noploop            [.] main
                    0.07%   0.00%  noploop  ld-2.15.so         [.] strcmp
                    0.03%   0.00%  noploop  [kernel.kallsyms]  [k] timerqueue_del

       report.skip-empty
           This option can change default stat behavior with empty results. If it’s set true, <u>perf</u> <u>report</u> <u>--stat</u>
           will not show 0 stats.

       top.*, top.children
           Same as <u>report.children</u>. So if it is enabled, the output of <u>top</u> command will have <u>Children</u> overhead
           column as well as <u>Self</u> overhead column by default. The default is <u>true</u>.

       top.call-graph
           This is identical to <u>call-graph.record-mode</u>, except it is applicable only for <u>top</u> subcommand. This
           option ONLY setup the unwind method. To enable <u>perf</u> <u>top</u> to actually use it, the command line option
           -g must be specified.

       man.*, man.viewer
           This option can assign a tool to view manual pages when <u>help</u> subcommand was invoked. Supported tools
           are <u>man</u>, <u>woman</u> (with emacs client) and <u>konqueror</u>. Default is <u>man</u>.

               New man viewer tool can be also added using 'man.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd'
               or use different path using 'man.&lt;tool&gt;.path' config option.

       pager.*, pager.&lt;subcommand&gt;
           When the subcommand is run on stdio, determine whether it uses pager or not based on this value.
           Default is <u>unspecified</u>.

       kmem.*, kmem.default
           This option decides which allocator is to be analyzed if neither <u>--slab</u> nor <u>--page</u> option is used.
           Default is <u>slab</u>.

       record.*, record.build-id
           This option can be <u>cache</u>, <u>no-cache</u>, <u>skip</u> or <u>mmap</u>.  <u>cache</u> is to post-process data and save/update the
           binaries into the build-id cache (in <a href="file:~/.debug">~/.debug</a>). This is the default. But if this option is <u>no-cache</u>,
           it will not update the build-id cache.  <u>skip</u> skips post-processing and does not update the cache.
           <u>mmap</u> skips post-processing and reads build-ids from MMAP events.

       record.call-graph
           This is identical to <u>call-graph.record-mode</u>, except it is applicable only for <u>record</u> subcommand. This
           option ONLY setup the unwind method. To enable <u>perf</u> <u>record</u> to actually use it, the command line
           option -g must be specified.

       record.aio
           Use <u>n</u> control blocks in asynchronous (Posix AIO) trace writing mode (<u>n</u> default: 1, max: 4).

       record.debuginfod
           Specify debuginfod URL to be used when cacheing perf.data binaries, it follows the same syntax as the
           DEBUGINFOD_URLS variable, like:

               <a href="http://192.168.122.174">http://192.168.122.174</a>:8002

               If the URLs is 'system', the value of DEBUGINFOD_URLS system environment
               variable is used.

       diff.*, diff.order
           This option sets the number of columns to sort the result. The default is 0, which means sorting by
           baseline. Setting it to 1 will sort the result by delta (or other compute method selected).

       diff.compute
           This options sets the method for computing the diff result. Possible values are <u>delta</u>, <u>delta-abs</u>,
           <u>ratio</u> and <u>wdiff</u>. Default is <u>delta</u>.

       trace.*, trace.add_events
           Allows adding a set of events to add to the ones specified by the user, or use as a default one if
           none was specified. The initial use case is to add augmented_raw_syscalls.o to activate the <u>perf</u>
           <u>trace</u> logic that looks for syscall pointer contents after the normal tracepoint payload.

       trace.args_alignment
           Number of columns to align the argument list, default is 70, use 40 for the strace default, zero to
           no alignment.

       trace.no_inherit
           Do not follow children threads.

       trace.show_arg_names
           Should syscall argument names be printed? If not then trace.show_zeros will be set.

       trace.show_duration
           Show syscall duration.

       trace.show_prefix
           If set to <u>yes</u> will show common string prefixes in tables. The default is to remove the common prefix
           in things like "MAP_SHARED", showing just "SHARED".

       trace.show_timestamp
           Show syscall start timestamp.

       trace.show_zeros
           Do not suppress syscall arguments that are equal to zero.

       trace.tracepoint_beautifiers
           Use "libtraceevent" to use that library to augment the tracepoint arguments, "libbeauty", the
           default, to use the same argument beautifiers used in the strace-like sys_enter+sys_exit lines.

       ftrace.*, ftrace.tracer
           Can be used to select the default tracer when neither -G nor -F option is not specified. Possible
           values are <u>function</u> and <u>function_graph</u>.

       samples.*, samples.context
           Define how many ns worth of time to show around samples in perf report sample context browser.

       scripts.*
           Any option defines a script that is added to the scripts menu in the interactive perf browser and
           whose output is displayed. The name of the option is the name, the value is a script command line.
           The script gets the same options passed as a full perf script, in particular -i perfdata file, --cpu,
           --tid

       convert.*, convert.queue-size
           Limit the size of ordered_events queue, so we could control allocation size of perf data files
           without proper finished round events.

       stat.*, stat.big-num
           (boolean) Change the default for "--big-num". To make "--no-big-num" the default, set
           "stat.big-num=false".

       intel-pt.*, intel-pt.cache-divisor, intel-pt.mispred-all
           If set, Intel PT decoder will set the mispred flag on all branches.

       intel-pt.max-loops
           If set and non-zero, the maximum number of unconditional branches decoded without consuming any trace
           packets. If the maximum is exceeded there will be a "Never-ending loop" error. The default is 100000.

       auxtrace.*, auxtrace.dumpdir
           s390 only. The directory to save the auxiliary trace buffer can be changed using this option. Ex,
           auxtrace.dumpdir=/tmp. If the directory does not exist or has the wrong file type, the current
           directory is used.

       itrace.*, debug-log-buffer-size
           Log size in bytes to output when using the option --itrace=d+e Refer <u>itrace</u> option of <b><a href="../man1/perf-script.1.html">perf-script</a></b>(1)
           or <b><a href="../man1/perf-report.1.html">perf-report</a></b>(1). The default is 16384.

       daemon.*, daemon.base
           Base path for daemon data. All sessions data are stored under this path.

       session-&lt;NAME&gt;.*, session-&lt;NAME&gt;.run
           Defines new record session for daemon. The value is record’s command line without the <u>record</u> keyword.
