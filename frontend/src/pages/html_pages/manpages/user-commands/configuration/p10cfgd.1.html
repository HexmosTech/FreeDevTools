</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Rmtcfgd</u>  is  a  server program used to send configuration files to a Gracilis PackeTen.  It can be run in
       background or it can be run by inetd.  If <u>p10cfgd</u> is to be run  by  inetd,  add  the  following  line  to
       <u><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></u>

       rmtcfg    1236/tcp  # Remote Configuration of PackeTen

       and add the following to <u>/etc/inetd.conf</u>

       # Remote configuration service for PackeTen
       rmtcfg  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/bin/p10cfgd  p10cfgd

       <u>P10cfgd</u>  normally does not require the IP_PORT parameter. It listens for connections on IP Port 1236 as a
       default.

       The program will send on a line by line basis the file requested by the client that connects  on  the  IP
       Port.   The  only  expected  input  from  the  client is the file name.  When the file has been sent, the
       connection is closed. The requested file must be in the directory /etc/p10cfgd.

       <u>Rmtcfgd</u> maintains a log of its activity in  the  file  /var/log/p10cfgd.log.   Program  startup  and  all
       connections are logged in the file with GMT time stamps.  The file is opened in append mode.

       The  protocol used by the PackeTen is very simple.  The PackeTen opens a tcp connection to port 1236 on a
       host system. Once the connection is made, the PackeTen sends the name of the file it wants to  the  host.
       The  host  then  opens the file and sends it line by line to the PackeTen until all lines have been sent.
       The files to be transfered must be plain text files and each line must have at  least  one  character  in
       addition to the newline at the end.  <u>P10cfgd</u> replaces all blank lines with lines that contain two spaces.
       If  you  wish  to  send  a  blank line, to stop loading of part of a LocalInfo file for example, place an
       underscore '_' at the begining of the line. The entire contents of the line will be deleted and  a  blank
       line  will  be  sent  to  the  client.   At  the  end of the file, the server sends a time command ( time
       MMDDYYHHMM ) with the UTC time on the server.  This will either set the time on the  PackeTen  or  add  a
       time stamp to the LocalInfo file.  The server then closes the connection.

       The remote configuration command used on the PackeTen is
            rmtcfg &lt;server_host&gt; &lt;filename&gt; [options]
            The valid options are
                 -t  &lt;timeout in seconds&gt;  default is 60 sec
                 -p  &lt;IP port #&gt;           default is 1236
                 -i                     the file is for LocalInfo
                 -h  &lt;secondary server&gt;    if the primary does not answer

       The  rmtcfg   commands  would  be  placed in to the EEPROM on the PackeTen so that they would be executed
       during a reboot.  The information stored in the EEPROM should  include  enough  information  to  set  the
       PackeTen  up  to  allow  communications  with  the  primary and the secondary server.  This would include
       commands to set MYCALL and the IP_ADDRESS, to attach an interface to the channel with the server, routing
       information and  so  forth.   A  sample  EEPROM  configuration  for  a  PackeTen,  empire.wd0fhg.ampr.org
       [44.32.0.32], that gets its configuration from a remote system winfree.n3eua.ampr.org [44.32.0.2], over a
       9600 baud ax25 path would be:

            # first the general setup of the PackeTen
            ee hostname gw.wd0fhg
            ee sitename empire
            ee ipaddr  44.32.0.32
            ee mycall WD0FHG
            # Then we attach a 9600 ax25 interface as ax1
            ee attach sync302 1 hdx ax25 ax1 8192 256 9600 ext ext nrzi
            # and set the default route to send every thing out ax1
            ee route add default ax1 44.32.0.1
            ee password sure-thing
            #
            # Now we will ask for the remainder of the setup
            # from the server winfree.n3eua.ampr.org [44.32.0.2]
            # Note that we have a secondary server available at
            # [44.20.0.195] that would be used if winfree is down.
            # first the Local Information file
            ee com 0 rmtcfg 44.32.0.2 empire.info -i -h 44.20.0.195
            # and then the remaining configuration command file
            ee com 1 rmtcfg 44.32.0.2 empire.cfg -h 44.20.0.195
            #
            ee save
            #    end-of-eeprom setup
