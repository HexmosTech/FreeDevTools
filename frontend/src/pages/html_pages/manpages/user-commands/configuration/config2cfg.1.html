       config2cfg - Atheros Configuration File Converter

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>config2cfg</b> [<b>options</b>] <b>file</b> [<b>file</b>] [<b>...</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>config2cfg</b>  program  converts  an SDRAM configuration file used by the Windows Device Manager to the
       configuration file format used by the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.

       This program is part of the Qualcomm Atheros Powerline Toolkit.  See the <b>AMP</b> man page for an overview and
       installation instructions.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There are no options.

</pre><h4><b>EXPLANATION</b></h4><pre>
       The Windows Device Manager format consists of 64 ASCII hexadecomal  characters.   Files  usually  have  a
       <b>.config</b>  extension.   File size is at least 64 characters.  Excess characters are ignored in input.  This
       means that files can be modified using any text editor and there is no way to detect modification.   From
       a  programmin  standpoint,  ASCII-to-binary  convertion and checksum computation is required on input and
       binary-to-ASCII conversion iw required on output.

       The Atheros Powerline Toolkit format consists of 32 binary bytes plus a 4 byte (32 bit) checksum.   Files
       usually have a <b>.cfg</b> extension.  File size is always 36 characters.  The files can be edited using any hex
       editor  but  a new checksum must be computed and inserted after any change.  No conversion or computation
       is required on input or output.  Input is ready for direct insertion into a VS_SET_SDRAM message.

       Programs <b>int6k</b> and <b>int6kf</b> expect this latter format and so you can use this program determine if a  given
       file has the proper format.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>file</u>   The  filename  of  a Windows Device Manager SDRAM configuration file.  The file is re-written such
              that the  filename  is  preserved  but  the  contents  are  not.   Windows  Device  Manager  SDRAM
              configuration  files usually have a <b>.config</b> extension but the program makes no assumption based on
              filename and does not enforce any filename conventions.

       <b>-q</b>     Suppresses printing of progress messages.  There are no progress messages in this version.

       <b>-v</b>     Print additional information.  There is no additional information printed in this version.

       -<b>?</b>, --<b>help</b>
              Print program help summary on stdout.  This option takes precedence  over  other  options  on  the
              command line.

       -<b>!</b>, --<b>version</b>
              Print  program  version information on stdout.  This option takes precedence over other options on
              the command line.  Use this option when sending screen dumps to Atheros Technical Support so  that
              they know exactly which version of the Linux Toolkit you are using.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  example  reads  file  abc.cfg  and  validates  it.   The message shown indicates that the
       configuration file is the correct size and has a checksums and there are no read errors.

           &gt; chkcfg abc.cfg
           chkcfg: abc.cfg looks good

       The following example reads three files in succession and reports on each one.   You  can  suppress  good
       news with the <b>-q</b> option.

           # chkcfg abc.cfg def.cfg ghi.cfg
           chkcfg: abc.cfg looks good
           chkcfg: def.cfg is corrupt
           chkcfg: ghi.cfg looks good

       The  following  example  displays the SDRAM configuration values in all files having names that match the
       wildcard pattern <b>sdram*.cfg</b>.  We can confirm that the values inside  are  correct  for  their  filenames.
       Program output could have been sent to a file and saved for later reference.

           # chknvm -qv sdram*.cfg
           ------- sdram32.cfg -------
                   SIZE=0x02000000 (32mb)
                   CONF=0x00143188
                   TIM0=0x01E1D491
                   TIM1=0x000883D6
                   CNTRL=0x00003089
                   REF=0x00000366
                   CLOCK=0x00000001
           ------- sdram16.cfg -------
                   SIZE=0x01000000 (16mb)
                   CONF=0x00142F68
                   TIM0=0x0115124E
                   TIM1=0x000883D6
                   CNTRL=0x00003089
                   REF=0x00000493
                   CLOCK=0x00000001
