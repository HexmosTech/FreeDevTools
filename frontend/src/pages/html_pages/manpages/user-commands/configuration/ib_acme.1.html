       ib_acme - test and configuration utility for the IB ACM

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>ib_acme</u> [-f addr_format] [-s src_addr] -d dest_addr [-v] [-c] [-e] [-P] [-S svc_addr] [-C repetitions]
       <u>ib_acme</u> [-A [addr_file]] [-O [opt_file]] [-D dest_dir] [-V]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       ib_acme  provides  assistance  configuring and testing the ibacm service.  The first usage of the service
       will test that the ibacm is running and operating correctly.  The second usage model  will  automatically
       create address and configuration files for the ibacm service.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -f addr_format
              Specifies  the format of the src_addr and dest_addr parameters.  Valid address formats are: 'i' ip
              address, 'n' host name, 'l' lid, 'g' gid, and 'u' unspecified.  If the -f option  is  omitted,  an
              unspecified  address  format  is  assumed.   ib_acme  will  use getaddrinfo or other mechanisms to
              determine which format the address uses.

       -s src_addr
              Specifies the local source address of the path to resolve.   The  source  address  can  be  an  IP
              address, system network name, or LID, as indicated by the addr_format option.

       -d dest_addr
              Specifies  the  destination  address of the path to resolve.  The destination address can be an IP
              address, system network name, or LID, as indicated by the addr_format option.

       -v     Indicates that the resolved path information should be verified with the active IB SA.  Use of the
              -v option provides a sanity check that resolved path  information  is  usable  given  the  current
              cluster configuration.

       -c     Instructs the ACM service to only returned information that currently resides in its local cache.

       -e [N] Displays one (N = 1, 2, ...) or all endpoints (N = 0 or not present).

       -P [opt]
              Queries  performance  data  from the destination service.  Valid options are: "col" for outputting
              combined data in column format,  "N" (N = 1, 2, ...) for outputting data for a  specific  endpoint
              N,   "all"  for  outputting  data  for  all endpoints,  and "s" for outputting data for a specific
              endpoint with the address given by the -s option.

       -S svc_addr
              Hostname, IPv4-address or Unix-domain socket of ACM service, default: /run/ibacm.sock

       -C repetitions
              number of repetitions to perform resolution.  Used to measure performance of  ACM  cache  lookups.
              Defaults to 1.

       -A [addr_file]
              With  this  option,  the  ib_acme  utility  automatically generates the address configuration file
              ibacm_addr.cfg.  The generated file is constructed using the system host name.

       -O [opt_file]
              With this option, the ib_acme  utility  automatically  generates  the  option  configuration  file
              ibacm_opts.cfg.  The generated file is currently generated using static information.

       -D dest_dir
              Specify the destination directory for the output files.

       -V     Enables  verbose  output.   When  combined  with -A or -O options, ib_acme will display additional
              details, such as generated address information saved to the ibacm_addr.cfg file.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The ib_acme utility performs two main functions.  With the -A and -O options, it automatically  generates
       address  or  options  configuration  files.  The generated files are text based and may be edited.  These
       options are intended to provide a simple way to configure address and option information on all nodes  on
       a cluster.

       The  other function of the ib_acme utility is to test the ibacm service, including helping to verify that
       the service is usable given the current cluster  configuration.   The  ib_acme  utility  can  resolve  IP
       addresses,  network  names,  or IB LIDs into a path record.  It can then compare that path record against
       one obtained by the SA.  When used to test the ibacm service, the ib_acme utility has the side effect  of
       loading the ibacm caches.

       Multiple,  numerical destinations can be specified by adding brackets [] to the end of a base destination
       name or address.  Users may specify a list of numerical ranges inside the brackets  using  the  following
       example  as a guide: node[1-3,5,7-8].  This will result in testing node1, node2, node3, node5, node7, and
       node8.
