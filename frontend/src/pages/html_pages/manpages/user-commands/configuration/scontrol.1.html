</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       scontrol - view or modify Slurm configuration and state.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scontrol</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>...] [<u>COMMAND</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scontrol</b>  is  used  to  view  or  modify  Slurm  configuration including: job, job step, node, partition,
       reservation, and overall system configuration. Most of the commands can only be executed by user root  or
       an  Administrator.  If  an attempt to view or modify configuration information is made by an unauthorized
       user, an error message will be printed and the requested action will not occur.  If no command is entered
       on the execute line, <b>scontrol</b> will operate in an interactive mode and prompt for input. It will  continue
       prompting  for  input  and executing commands until explicitly terminated. If a command is entered on the
       execute  line,  <b>scontrol</b>  will  execute  that  command  and  terminate.  All  commands  and  options  are
       case-insensitive,  although  node  names, partition names, and reservation names are case-sensitive (node
       names "LX" and "lx" are distinct). All commands and options can be abbreviated to  the  extent  that  the
       specification is unique. A modified Slurm configuration can be written to a file using the <u>scontrol</u> <u>write</u>
       <u>config</u> command. The resulting file will be named using the convention "slurm.conf.&lt;datetime&gt;" and located
       in the same directory as the original "slurm.conf" file. The directory containing the original slurm.conf
       must be writable for this to occur.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>, <b>--all</b>
              When the <u>show</u> command is used, then display all partitions, their jobs and jobs steps. This causes
              information to be displayed about partitions that are configured as hidden and partitions that are
              unavailable to user's group.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--clusters</b>=&lt;<u>string</u>&gt;
              The  cluster to issue commands to. Only one cluster name may be specified.  Note that the <b>slurmdbd</b>
              must be up for this  option  to  work  properly,  unless  running  in  a  federation  with  either
              <b>FederationParameters=fed_display</b>   configured   or  the  <b>--federation</b>  option  set.   This  option
              implicitly sets the <b>--local</b> option.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--details</b>
              Causes the <u>show</u> command to provide additional details where available.

       <b>--federation</b>
              Report jobs from federation if a member of one.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--future</b>
              Report nodes in FUTURE state.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Print a help message describing the usage of scontrol.

       <b>--hide</b> Do not display information about hidden partitions, their jobs and job steps.  By default, neither
              partitions that are configured as hidden nor those partitions unavailable to user's group will  be
              displayed (i.e. this is the default behavior).

       <b>--json</b>, <b>--json</b>=<u>list</u>, <b>--json</b>=&lt;<u>data_parser</u>&gt;
              Dump  information  as  JSON  using  the  default  data_parser  plugin or explicit data_parser with
              parameters. All information is dumped, even if it would normally not be.  Sorting  and  formatting
              arguments  passed  to other options are ignored; however, most filtering arguments are still used.
              This option is not available for every command.  This option implicitly sets the <b>--details</b> option.

       <b>--local</b>
              Show only information local to this cluster. Ignore other clusters in the federated if a member of
              one. Overrides --federation.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--oneliner</b>
              Print information one line per record.

       <b>-Q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              Print no warning or informational messages, only fatal error messages.

       <b>--sibling</b>
              Show all sibling jobs on a federated cluster. Implies --federation.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--uid</b>=&lt;<u>uid</u>&gt;
              Attempt to update a job as user &lt;uid&gt; instead of the invoking user id.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Print detailed event logging. Multiple '<b>-v</b>'s will further increase the verbosity  of  logging.  By
              default only errors will be displayed.

       <b>-V</b> , <b>--version</b>
              Print version information and exit.

       <b>--yaml</b>, <b>--yaml</b>=<u>list</u>, <b>--yaml</b>=&lt;<u>data_parser</u>&gt;
              Dump  information  as  YAML  using  the  default  data_parser  plugin or explicit data_parser with
              parameters. All information is dumped, even if it would normally not be.  Sorting  and  formatting
              arguments  passed  to other options are ignored; however, most filtering arguments are still used.
              This option is not available for every command.  This option implicitly sets the <b>--details</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cancel_reboot</b> &lt;<u>NodeList</u>&gt;
              Cancel pending reboots on nodes. The node will be undrain'ed and the reason cleared  if  the  node
              was drained by an ASAP reboot.

       <b>create</b> &lt;<u>SPECIFICATION</u>&gt;
              Create a new node, partition, or reservation. See the full list of parameters below.

       <b>completing</b>
              Display  all jobs in a COMPLETING state along with associated nodes in either a COMPLETING or DOWN
              state.

       <b>delete</b> &lt;<u>SPECIFICATION</u>&gt;
              Delete  the  entry  with  the  specified  <u>SPECIFICATION</u>.   The  three  <u>SPECIFICATION</u>  choices  are
              <u>NodeName=&lt;nodelist&gt;</u>, <u>PartitionName=&lt;name&gt;</u> and <u>ReservationName=&lt;name&gt;</u>. Only dynamic nodes that have
              no running jobs and that are not part of a reservation can be deleted. Reservations and partitions
              should  have  no  associated  jobs  at  the time of their deletion (modify the jobs first). If the
              specified partition is in use, the request is denied.

       <b>errnumstr</b> &lt;<u>ERRNO</u>&gt;
              Given a Slurm error number, return a descriptive string.

       <b>fsdampeningfactor</b> &lt;<u>FACTOR</u>&gt;
              Set the FairShareDampeningFactor in slurmctld.

       <b>getaddrs</b> &lt;<u>NODES</u>&gt;
              Get IP addresses of &lt;<u>NODES</u>&gt; from slurmctld.

       <b>help</b>   Display a description of scontrol options and commands.

       <b>hold</b> &lt;<u>job_list</u>&gt;
              Prevent a pending job from being started (sets its priority to 0).  Use  the  <u>release</u>  command  to
              permit  the  job  to  be scheduled.  The job_list argument is a comma separated list of job IDs OR
              "jobname=" with the job's name, which will attempt to hold all jobs having that name.   Note  that
              when  a  job is held by a system administrator using the <b>hold</b> command, only a system administrator
              may release the job for execution (also see the <b>uhold</b> command). When the job is held by its owner,
              it may also be released by the job's owner.  Additionally, attempting to hold a running  job  will
              have  not  suspend  or cancel it. But, it will set the job priority to 0 and update the job reason
              field, which would hold the job if it was requeued at a later time.

       <b>notify</b> &lt;<u>job_id</u>&gt; &lt;<u>message</u>&gt;
              Send a message to standard error of the salloc or srun command or batch job  associated  with  the
              specified <u>job_id</u>.

       <b>pidinfo</b> &lt;<u>proc_id</u>&gt;
              Print  the  Slurm  job id and scheduled termination time corresponding to the supplied process id,
              <u>proc_id</u>, on the current node. This will work only with processes on node on which scontrol is run,
              and only for those processes spawned by Slurm and their descendants.

       <b>listjobs</b> [&lt;<u>NodeName</u>&gt;]
              Print jobs running on the host that runs this. This contacts any slurmstepd's running locally, and
              does not contact slurmctld

              Use &lt;<u>NodeName</u>&gt; if using --enable-multiple-slurmd.

       <b>listpids</b> [&lt;<u>job_id</u>&gt;[.&lt;<u>step_id</u>&gt;]] [&lt;<u>NodeName</u>&gt;]
              Print a listing of the process IDs in a job step (if JOBID.STEPID is provided), or all of the  job
              steps  in  a  job (if <u>job_id</u> is provided), or all of the job steps in all of the jobs on the local
              node (if <u>job_id</u> is not provided or <u>job_id</u> is "*"). This will work only with processes on the  node
              on  which  scontrol  is  run, and only for those processes spawned by Slurm and their descendants.
              Note that some Slurm configurations (<u>ProctrackType</u> value of  <u>pgid</u>)  are  unable  to  identify  all
              processes associated with a job or job step.

              Note  that the NodeName option is only really useful when you have multiple slurmd daemons running
              on the same host machine. Multiple slurmd daemons on one host are, in general, only used by  Slurm
              developers.

       <b>liststeps</b> [&lt;<u>NodeName</u>&gt;]
              Print  steps  running  on the host that runs this. This contacts any slurmstepd's running locally,
              and does not contact slurmctld

              Use &lt;<u>NodeName</u>&gt; if using --enable-multiple-slurmd.

       <b>ping</b>   Ping the primary and secondary slurmctld daemon and report if they are responding.

       <b>power</b>  {up|down} [asap|force] {ALL|&lt;<u>NodeList</u>&gt;|&lt;<u>NodeSet</u>&gt;}
              Control power state of the provided node list/set. For 'power down', the optional ASAP/FORCE  flag
              will be added to the power down request, but will otherwise be rejected for power up requests. All
              arguments  will  be  processed  insensitive  of case except for the node list/set. This subcommand
              obsoletes the prior usage of scontrol's update command:

              scontrol update NodeName=&lt;<u>nodes</u>&gt;
                              State={POWER_UP|POWER_DOWN|POWER_DOWN_ASAP|POWER_DOWN_FORCE}

              Commands:

              <b>down</b>   Will use the configured <u>SuspendProgram</u> program  to  explicitly  place  node(s)  into  power
                     saving  mode.  If  a node is already in the process of being powered down, the command will
                     only change the state  of  the  node  but  won't  have  any  effect  until  the  configured
                     <u>SuspendTimeout</u>  is  reached.  Use  of  this  command  can  be  useful in situations where a
                     <u>ResumeProgram</u>, like <u>capmc</u> in Cray machines, is stalled and one wants to restore the node to
                     "IDLE" manually. In this case rebooting the node and setting the state to "power down" will
                     cancel the previous "power up" state and the node will become "IDLE".

              <b>down</b> <b>asap</b>
                     Will drain the node(s) and mark them for power down. Currently running jobs  will  complete
                     first and no additional jobs will be allocated to the node(s).

              <b>down</b> <b>force</b>
                     Will cancel all jobs on the node(s), power them down, and reset their state to "IDLE".

              <b>up</b>     Will  use  the  configured  <u>ResumeProgram</u>  program  to explicitly move node(s) out of power
                     saving mode. If a node is already in the process of being powered up, the command will only
                     change the state of the node but won't have any effect until the  configured  <u>ResumeTimeout</u>
                     is reached.

       <b>reboot</b> [ASAP] [nextstate={RESUME|DOWN}] [reason=&lt;<u>reason</u>&gt;] {ALL|&lt;<u>NodeList</u>&gt;|&lt;<u>NodeSet</u>&gt;}
              Reboot  the  nodes  in  the  system when they become idle using the <b>RebootProgram</b> as configured in
              Slurm's slurm.conf file.  Each node will have the "REBOOT" flag added to its node state.  After  a
              node  reboots  and  the slurmd daemon starts up again, the HealthCheckProgram will run once. Then,
              the slurmd daemon will register itself with the slurmctld daemon and the  "REBOOT"  flag  will  be
              cleared.  The "ASAP" option adds the "DRAIN" flag to each node's state, preventing additional jobs
              from running on the node so it can be rebooted and returned to service "As Soon As Possible" (i.e.
              ASAP).   "ASAP"  will  also  set  the  node  reason  to "Reboot ASAP" if the "reason" option isn't
              specified and will set nextstate=UNDRAIN if nextstate isn't specified.  If the "nextstate"  option
              is  specified as "DOWN", then the node will remain in a down state after rebooting. If "nextstate"
              is specified as "RESUME", then the nodes will resume as normal and the node's reason  and  "DRAIN"
              state  will  be  cleared.   Resuming  nodes  will  be  considered  as available in backfill future
              scheduling and won't be replaced by idle nodes in a reservation.  The "reason"  option  sets  each
              node's  reason  to  a  user-defined  message.  A default reason of "reboot requested" is set if no
              other reason is set on the node.  The reason will be  appended  with:  "reboot  issued"  when  the
              reboot  is  issued;  "reboot complete" when the node registers and has a "nextstate" of "DOWN"; or
              "reboot timed out" when the node fails to register within <b>ResumeTimeout</b>.  You must specify  either
              a list of nodes or that ALL nodes are to be rebooted.

              <b>NOTE</b>:  The  reboot  request will be ignored for hosts in the following states: FUTURE, POWER_DOWN,
              POWERED_DOWN, POWERING_DOWN, REBOOT_ISSUED, REBOOT_REQUESTED

              <b>NOTE</b>: By default, this command does not prevent additional jobs from being scheduled on any  nodes
              before  reboot.   To  do  this, you can either use the "ASAP" option or explicitly drain the nodes
              beforehand.  You can alternately create an advanced reservation to prevent  additional  jobs  from
              being  initiated  on  nodes  to  be rebooted.  Pending reboots can be cancelled by using "scontrol
              cancel_reboot &lt;node&gt;" or setting the node state to "CANCEL_REBOOT".  A node will be marked  "DOWN"
              if it doesn't reboot within <b>ResumeTimeout</b>.

       <b>reconfigure</b>
              Instruct  all  slurmctld and slurmd daemons to re-read the configuration file.  This mechanism can
              be used to modify configuration parameters set in <b><a href="../man5/slurm.conf.5.html">slurm.conf</a></b>(5) without interrupting running jobs.
              Starting in 23.11, this command operates by creating new processes for the daemons,  then  passing
              control  to  the new processes when or if they start up successfully. This allows it to gracefully
              catch configuration problems and keep running with  the  previous  configuration  if  there  is  a
              problem.   This  will  <b>not</b>  be  able  to  change  the  daemons'  listening  TCP  port  settings or
              authentication mechanism.

       <b>release</b> &lt;<u>job_list</u>&gt;
              Release a previously held job to begin execution.  The job_list argument is a comma separated list
              of job IDs OR "jobname=" with the job's name, which will attempt to release all jobs  having  that
              name.  Also see <b>hold</b>.

       <b>requeue</b>  [&lt;<u>option</u>&gt;] &lt;<u>job_list</u>&gt;
              Requeue  a  running,  suspended  or  finished  Slurm  batch  job into pending state.  The job_list
              argument is a comma separated list of job IDs.  The command accepts the following option:

              <b>Incomplete</b>
                     Operate only on jobs (or tasks of a job array) which have not completed.  Specifically only
                     jobs in the following states will be requeued: CONFIGURING, RUNNING, STOPPED or SUSPENDED.

       <b>requeuehold</b> [&lt;<u>option</u>&gt;] &lt;<u>job_list</u>&gt;
              Requeue a running, suspended or finished Slurm batch job into pending state, moreover the  job  is
              put in held state (priority zero).  The job_list argument is a comma separated list of job IDs.  A
              held job can be released using scontrol to reset its priority (e.g.  "scontrol release &lt;job_id&gt;").
              The command accepts the following options:

              <b>Incomplete</b>
                     Operate only on jobs (or tasks of a job array) which have not completed.  Specifically only
                     jobs in the following states will be requeued: CONFIGURING, RUNNING, STOPPED or SUSPENDED.

              <b>State</b>=SpecialExit
                     The  "SpecialExit"  keyword  specifies  that  the  job  has  to  be  put in a special state
                     <b>JOB_SPECIAL_EXIT</b>.   The  "scontrol  show  job"  command  will  display  the   JobState   as
                     <b>SPECIAL_EXIT</b>, while the "squeue" command as <b>SE</b>.

       <b>resume</b> &lt;<u>job_list</u>&gt;
              Resume  a  previously  suspended job.  The job_list argument is a comma separated list of job IDs.
              Also see <b>suspend</b>.

              <b>NOTE</b>: A suspended job releases its CPUs for allocation  to  other  jobs.   Resuming  a  previously
              suspended  job may result in multiple jobs being allocated the same CPUs, which could trigger gang
              scheduling  with  some  configurations  or  severe   degradation   in   performance   with   other
              configurations.   Use  of the scancel command to send SIGSTOP and SIGCONT signals would stop a job
              without releasing its CPUs for allocation to other jobs and would be  a  preferable  mechanism  in
              many  cases.  If performing system maintenance you may want to use suspend/resume in the following
              way. Before suspending set all nodes to draining or set all partitions to down so that no new jobs
              can be scheduled. Then suspend jobs. Once maintenance is done resume jobs then resume nodes and/or
              set all partitions back to  up.   Use  with  caution.   Only  an  account  coordinator,  operator,
              administrator, SlurmUser, or root can resume jobs.

       <b>schedloglevel</b> &lt;<u>LEVEL</u>&gt;
              Enable  or  disable  scheduler logging.  <u>LEVEL</u> may be "0", "1", "disable" or "enable". "0" has the
              same effect as "disable". "1" has the same effect as "enable".  This value is temporary  and  will
              be  overwritten  when  the slurmctld daemon reads the slurm.conf configuration file (e.g. when the
              daemon is restarted or <b>scontrol</b> <b>reconfigure</b> is executed) if the  SlurmSchedLogLevel  parameter  is
              present.

       <b>setdebug</b> &lt;<u>LEVEL</u>&gt; [nodes=&lt;<u>NODES</u>&gt;]
              Change  the  debug  level  of  the slurmctld daemon for all active logging channels not originally
              configured off (quiet).  <u>LEVEL</u> may be an integer value between  zero  and  nine  (using  the  same
              values  as <u>SlurmctldDebug</u> in the <u>slurm.conf</u> file) or the name of the most detailed message type to
              be printed: "quiet", "fatal", "error", "info", "verbose", "debug", "debug2",  "debug3",  "debug4",
              or  "debug5".   This  value  is  temporary,  and will be overwritten whenever the daemon reads the
              slurm.conf configuration file. (Such as when the daemon is restarted or  <b>scontrol</b>  <b>reconfigure</b>  is
              executed).

              <b>nodes</b>=&lt;<u>NodeName</u>&gt;
                     If  set,  the  request  to  change debug level is sent to the slurmd processes on the nodes
                     instead of to the slurmctld. A node range expression may be used for NodeName.

       <b>setdebugflags</b> {+|-}&lt;<u>FLAG</u>&gt; [{+|-}&lt;<u>FLAG</u>&gt;] [nodes=&lt;<u>NODES</u>&gt;]
              Add or remove DebugFlags of the slurmctld daemon.  See "man slurm.conf" for a  list  of  supported
              DebugFlags.

              <b>NOTE</b>:  Changing  the value of some DebugFlags will have no effect without restarting the slurmctld
              daemon, which would set DebugFlags based upon the contents of the slurm.conf configuration file or
              the <b>SLURM_DEBUG_FLAGS</b> environment variable. The environment variable  takes  precedence  over  the
              setting in the slurm.conf.

              <b>nodes</b>=&lt;<u>NodeName</u>&gt;
                     The  argument  is  optional and if used the request to change debug level is sent to slurmd
                     instead of slurmctld. A node range expression may be used for NodeName.

       <b>show</b> &lt;<u>ENTITY</u>&gt;[=&lt;<u>ID</u>&gt;] or &lt;<u>ENTITY</u>&gt; [&lt;<u>ID</u>&gt;]
              Display the state of the specified entity with the specified identification.

              <b>aliases</b>
                     Returns all <u>NodeName</u> values associated with a given <u>NodeHostname</u> (useful to get the list of
                     virtual nodes associated with a real node in a configuration where multiple slurmd  daemons
                     execute on a single compute node).

              <b>assoc_mgr</b>
                     Displays  the  current  contents  of the slurmctld's internal cache for users, associations
                     and/or qos. The output can be filtered by different record types:

                     <b>users</b>=&lt;<u>user1</u>&gt;[...,&lt;<u>userN</u>&gt;]
                            Limit the User Records displayed to those with the specified user name(s).

                     <b>accounts</b>=&lt;<u>acct1</u>&gt;[...,&lt;<u>acctN</u>&gt;]
                            Limit the Association Records displayed to those with the specified account name(s).

                     <b>qos</b>=&lt;<u>qos1</u>&gt;[...,&lt;<u>qosN</u>&gt;]
                            Limit the QOS Records displayed to those with the specified QOS name(s).

                     <b>flags</b>={users|assoc|qos}
                            Specify the desired record type to be displayed. If  no  flags  are  specified,  all
                            record types are displayed.

              <b>bbstat</b> Displays output from the current burst buffer plugin's status tool (slurm_bb_get_status for
                     lua  or  dwstat  for  datawarp). Options following <b>bbstat</b> are passed directly to the status
                     tool by the slurmctld daemon and the response returned to the user. Equivalent to <b>dwstat</b>.

              <b>burstbuffer</b>
                     Displays the current status of the BurstBuffer plugin.

              <b>config</b> Displays parameter names from the configuration files in mixed case (e.g.  SlurmdPort=7003)
                     while derived parameters names are in upper case only (e.g. SLURM_VERSION).

              <b>daemons</b>
                     Reports which daemons should be running on this node.

              <b>dwstat</b> Displays output from the current burst buffer plugin's status tool (slurm_bb_get_status for
                     lua  or  dwstat  for  datawarp). Options following <b>dwstat</b> are passed directly to the status
                     tool by the slurmctld daemon and the response returned to the user. Equivalent to <b>bbstat</b>.

              <b>federation</b>
                     The federation name that the controller is part of and the sibling  clusters  part  of  the
                     federation will be listed.

              <b>frontend</b>
                     Shows configured frontend nodes.

              <b>hostlist</b>
                     Takes  a  list  of  host  names and prints the hostlist expression for them (the inverse of
                     <b>hostnames</b>). <b>hostlist</b> can also take the absolute pathname of  a  file  (beginning  with  the
                     character  '/')  containing a list of hostnames, or a single '-' to have it read from stdin
                     directly.  Multiple node names may be specified using simple node range  expressions  (e.g.
                     "lx[10-20]").  By  default  <b>hostlist</b>  does  not  sort the node list or make it unique (e.g.
                     tux2,tux1,tux2 = tux[2,1-2]).  If  you  wanted  a  sorted  list  use  <b>hostlistsorted</b>  (e.g.
                     tux2,tux1,tux2 = tux[1-2,2]).

              <b>hostlistsorted</b>
                     Takes  a  list  of  host names and prints a sorted (but not unique) hostlist expression for
                     them. See <b>hostlist</b>.

              <b>hostnames</b>
                     Takes an optional hostlist expression as input and writes a list of individual  host  names
                     to  standard  output (one per line). If no hostlist expression is supplied, the contents of
                     the SLURM_JOB_NODELIST environment variable is used. For example "tux[1-3]"  is  mapped  to
                     "tux1","tux2" and "tux3" (one hostname per line).

              <b>job</b>    Displays  statistics  about all jobs by default. If an optional jobid is specified, details
                     for just that job will  be  displayed.   If  the  job  does  not  specify  socket-per-node,
                     cores-per-socket or threads-per-core then it will display '*' in the ReqS:C:T=*:*:* field.

              <b>licenses</b>
                     Displays  statistics  about  all  configured  licenses (local and remote) by default. If an
                     optional license name is specified, details for just that license will be displayed.

              <b>node</b>   Displays statistics about all nodes by default.  If  an  optional  nodename  is  specified,
                     details for just that node will be displayed.

              <b>partition</b>
                     Displays  statistics  about  all  partitions  by  default. If an optional partition name is
                     specified, details for just that partition will be displayed.

              <b>reservation</b>
                     Displays statistics about all reservations by default. If an optional reservation  name  is
                     specified, details for just that reservation will be displayed.

              <b>slurmd</b> Displays statistics for the slurmd running on the current node.

              <b>step</b>   Displays  statistics  about  all  job  steps by default. If an optional jobid is specified,
                     details about steps for just that job will be displayed.  If a jobid.stepid  is  specified,
                     details  for  just  that step will be displayed.  If a container-id=&lt;<u>id</u>&gt; is specified, then
                     the first matching step with the given container-id will be displayed.

              <b>topology</b>
                     Displays information  about  the  defined  topology  layout.  If  a  switch  is  specified,
                     information  about  that switch will be shown.  If one node name is specified, all switches
                     connected to that node (and their parent switches) will be shown.  If more  than  one  node
                     name is specified, only switches that connect to all named nodes will be shown.

       <b>shutdown</b> &lt;<u>OPTION</u>&gt;
              Instruct  Slurm  daemons  to  save  current state and terminate.  By default, the Slurm controller
              (slurmctld) forwards the request all other daemons (slurmd  daemon  on  each  compute  node).   An
              <u>OPTION</u>  of  <u>slurmctld</u>  or  <u>controller</u>  results in only the slurmctld daemon being shutdown and the
              slurmd daemons remaining active.

       <b>suspend</b> &lt;<u>job_list</u>&gt;
              Suspend a running job.  The job_list argument is a comma separated  list  of  job  IDs.   Use  the
              <u>resume</u> command to resume its execution.  User processes must stop on receipt of SIGSTOP signal and
              resume  upon  receipt  of  SIGCONT  for this operation to be effective.  Not all architectures and
              configurations support job suspension.  If a suspended job is requeued, it will  be  placed  in  a
              held  state.   The  time  a  job  is suspended will not count against a job's time limit.  Only an
              account coordinator, operator, administrator, SlurmUser, or root can suspend jobs.

       <b>takeover</b> [&lt;<u>INDEX</u>&gt;]
              Instruct one of Slurm's backup controllers (slurmctld) to take over system control. By default the
              first backup controller (INDEX=1) requests control from the primary and waits for its termination.
              After that, it switches from backup mode to controller mode. If  primary  controller  can  not  be
              contacted,  it  directly  switches  to  controller  mode.  This  can be used to speed up the Slurm
              controller fail-over mechanism when the primary node is  down.   This  can  be  used  to  minimize
              disruption  if  the  computer  executing  the  primary Slurm controller is scheduled down.  (Note:
              Slurm's primary controller will take the control back at startup.)

       <b>top</b> &lt;<u>job_list</u>&gt;
              Move the specified job IDs to the top of the queue of jobs belonging to  the  identical  user  ID,
              partition  name, account, and QOS.  The job_list argument is a comma separated ordered list of job
              IDs.  Any job not matching <b>all</b> of those fields will not be effected.  Only  jobs  submitted  to  a
              single partition will be effected.  This operation changes the order of jobs by adjusting job nice
              values.   The  net effect on that user's throughput will be negligible to slightly negative.  This
              operation is disabled by default for non-privileged  (non-operator,  admin,  SlurmUser,  or  root)
              users.  This  operation  may  be  enabled  for non-privileged users by the system administrator by
              including the option "enable_user_top" in the SchedulerParameters configuration parameter.

       <b>token</b> [lifespan=&lt;<u>lifespan</u>&gt;] [username=&lt;<u>username</u>&gt;]
              Return an auth token which can be used to support JWT authentication if <u>AuthAltTypes=auth/jwt</u>  has
              been enabled on the system.  Supports two optional arguments. <b>lifespan=</b> may be used to specify the
              token's  lifespan in seconds. <b>username</b> (only available to SlurmUser/root) may be used to request a
              token for a different username. Lifespan can be set to "infinite" to have a token  that  will  not
              expire.  Sites  are suggested to use the smallest lifespan required and generate tokens more often
              instead of using longer lived tokens.

       <b>uhold</b> &lt;<u>job_list</u>&gt;
              Prevent a pending job from being started (sets its priority to 0).  The  job_list  argument  is  a
              space  separated  list  of  job IDs or job names.  Use the <u>release</u> command to permit the job to be
              scheduled.  This command is designed for a system administrator to hold a  job  so  that  the  job
              owner  may  release  it rather than requiring the intervention of a system administrator (also see
              the <b>hold</b> command).

       <b>update</b> &lt;<u>SPECIFICATION</u>&gt;
              Update job, step, node, partition, or reservation configuration per  the  supplied  specification.
              <u>SPECIFICATION</u>  is  in  the  same format as the Slurm configuration file and the output of the <u>show</u>
              command described above. It may be desirable to execute the <u>show</u> command (described above) on  the
              specific  entity  you  want to update, then use cut-and-paste tools to enter updated configuration
              values to the <u>update</u>. Note that while most configuration values can be changed using this command,
              not all can be changed using this mechanism. In particular, the hardware configuration of  a  node
              or  the  physical  addition  or removal of nodes from the cluster may only be accomplished through
              editing the Slurm configuration file and executing the <u>reconfigure</u> command (described above).

       <b>update</b> &lt;SuspendExc*&gt;[=|+=|-=]&lt;<u>LIST</u>&gt;
              Update <u>SuspendExcNodes</u>, <u>SuspendExcParts</u>, or <u>SuspendExcStates</u>.  &lt;<u>LIST</u>&gt; is either a  NodeList,  list
              of  partitions, or list of node states respectively. Use +=/-= to add/remove nodes, partitions, or
              states to/from the currently configured list. Use = to replace the current list.   SuspendExcNodes
              does  not  support "+="/"-=" when the ":" option is used, however, direct assignment "=" is always
              supported.  Consider using "scontrol show config | grep SuspendExc" to see current state of  these
              settings.

       <b>version</b>
              Display the version number of scontrol being executed.

       <b>wait_job</b> &lt;<u>job_id</u>&gt;
              Wait  until  a  job and all of its nodes are ready for use or the job has entered some termination
              state. This option is particularly useful in the Slurm Prolog or in the  batch  script  itself  if
              nodes are powered down and restarted automatically as needed.

              <b>NOTE</b>: Don't use scontrol wait_job in PrologSlurmctld or Prolog with PrologFlags=Alloc as this will
              result in a deadlock.

              <b>NOTE</b>: When using <b>wait_job</b> for an array job, use the <b>SLURM_JOB_ID</b> environment variable to reference
              the job rather than the <b>SLURM_ARRAY_JOB_ID</b> variable.

       <b>write</b> <b>batch_script</b> &lt;<u>job_id</u>&gt; [&lt;<u>optional_filename</u>&gt;]
              Write  the  batch  script  for  a  given  job_id  to a file or to stdout. The file will default to
              <u>slurm-&lt;job_id&gt;.sh</u> if the optional filename argument is not given. The script will  be  written  to
              stdout if - is given instead of a filename.  The batch script can only be retrieved by an admin or
              operator, or by the owner of the job.

       <b>write</b> <b>config</b> &lt;<u>optional_filename</u>&gt;
              Write the current configuration to a file with the naming convention of "slurm.conf.&lt;datetime&gt;" in
              the same directory as the original slurm.conf file. If a filename is given that file location with
              a .&lt;datetime&gt; suffix is created.

</pre><h4><b>INTERACTIVE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NOTE</b>: All commands listed below can be used in the interactive mode, but <u>NOT</u> on the initial command line.

       <b>all</b>    Show  all  partitions,  their  jobs  and jobs steps. This causes information to be displayed about
              partitions that are configured as hidden and partitions that are unavailable to user's group.

       <b>cluster</b> &lt;<u>CLUSTER_NAME</u>&gt;
              The cluster to issue commands to. Only one cluster name may be specified.

       <b>details</b>
              Causes the <u>show</u> command to provide additional  details  where  available.   Job  information  will
              include  CPUs  and NUMA memory allocated on each node.  Note that on computers with hyperthreading
              enabled and Slurm configured to allocate cores, each listed  CPU  represents  one  physical  core.
              Each  hyperthread  on  that  core  can be allocated a separate task, so a job's CPU count and task
              count may differ.  See the <b>--cpu-bind</b> and <b>--mem-bind</b> option descriptions in  srun  man  pages  for
              more information.  The <b>details</b> option is currently only supported for the <u>show</u> <u>job</u> command.

       <b>exit</b>   Terminate scontrol interactive session.

       <b>hide</b>   Do  not  display  partition,  job  or  jobs step information for partitions that are configured as
              hidden or partitions that are unavailable to the user's group.  This is the default behavior.

       <b>oneliner</b>
              Print information one line per record.

       <b>quiet</b>  Print no warning or informational messages, only fatal error messages.

       <b>quit</b>   Terminate the execution of scontrol.

       <b>verbose</b>
              Print detailed event logging.  This includes time-stamps on data structures, record counts, etc.

       <b>!!</b>     Repeat the last command executed.

</pre><h4><b>JOBS</b> <b>-</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>UPDATE</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       Note that update requests done by either root, SlurmUser or Administrators are  not  subject  to  certain
       restrictions.  For instance, if an Administrator changes the QOS on a pending job, certain limits such as
       the TimeLimit will not be changed automatically as changes made by  the  Administrators  are  allowed  to
       violate these restrictions.

       <b>Account</b>=&lt;<u>account</u>&gt;
              Account  name  to  be  changed  for this job's resource use.  Value may be cleared with blank data
              value, "Account=".

       <b>AdminComment</b>=&lt;<u>spec</u>&gt;
              Arbitrary descriptive string. Can only be set by a Slurm administrator.

       <b>ArrayTaskThrottle</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;
              Specify the maximum number of tasks in a job array that can execute at the  same  time.   Set  the
              count  to  zero  in  order  to  eliminate  any  limit.  The task throttle count for a job array is
              reported  as  part  of  its  ArrayTaskId  field,  preceded  with  a  percent  sign.   For  example
              "ArrayTaskId=1-10%2" indicates the maximum number of running tasks is limited to 2.

       <b>BurstBuffer</b>=&lt;<u>spec</u>&gt;
              Burst  buffer  specification to be changed for this job's resource use.  Value may be cleared with
              blank data value, "BurstBuffer=".  Format is burst buffer plugin specific.

       <b>Clusters</b>=&lt;<u>spec</u>&gt;
              Specifies the clusters that the federated job can run on.

       <b>ClusterFeatures</b>=&lt;<u>spec</u>&gt;
              Specifies features that a federated cluster must have to have a sibling job submitted to it. Slurm
              will attempt to submit a sibling job to a cluster  if  it  has  at  least  one  of  the  specified
              features.

       <b>Comment</b>=&lt;<u>spec</u>&gt;
              Arbitrary descriptive string.

       <b>Contiguous</b>={yes|no}
              Set the job's requirement for contiguous (consecutive) nodes to be allocated.  Possible values are
              "YES" and "NO".  Only the Slurm administrator or root can change this parameter.

       <b>CoreSpec</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;
              Number  of cores to reserve per node for system use.  The job will be charged for these cores, but
              be unable to use them.  Will be reported as "*" if not constrained.

       <b>CPUsPerTask</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;
              Change the CPUsPerTask job's value.

       <b>Deadline</b>=&lt;<u>time_spec</u>&gt;
              It accepts times of the form <u>HH:MM:SS</u> to specify a deadline to a job at a  specific  time  of  day
              (seconds  are  optional).   You may also specify <u>midnight</u>, <u>noon</u>, <u>elevenses</u> (11 AM), <u>fika</u> (3 PM) or
              <u>teatime</u> (4 PM) and you can have a time-of-day suffixed with <u>AM</u> or <u>PM</u> for a deadline in the morning
              or the evening.  You can specify a deadline for the job with a date of the form <u>MMDDYY</u> or <u>MM/DD/YY</u>
              or <u>MM.DD.YY</u>, or a date and time as <u>YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]</u>. You can also give  times  like  <u>now</u>  <u>+</u>
              <u>count</u>  <u>time-units</u>,  where  the time-units can be <u>seconds</u> (default), <u>minutes</u>, <u>hours</u>, <u>days</u>, or <u>weeks</u>
              and you can tell Slurm to put a deadline for tomorrow with the keyword  <u>tomorrow</u>.   The  specified
              deadline  must  be  later than the current time.  Only pending jobs can have the deadline updated.
              Only the Slurm administrator or root can change this parameter.

       <b>DelayBoot</b>=&lt;<u>time_spec</u>&gt;
              Change the time to decide whether to reboot nodes in order to satisfy job's feature  specification
              if  the  job  has been eligible to run for less than this time period. See salloc/sbatch man pages
              option --delay-boot.

       <b>Dependency</b>=&lt;<u>dependency_list</u>&gt;
              Defer job's  initiation  until  specified  job  dependency  specification  is  satisfied.  Once  a
              dependency  is  satisfied,  it  is  removed  from  the  job.   Cancel  dependency  with  an  empty
              dependency_list    (e.g.     "Dependency=").      &lt;<u>dependency_list</u>&gt;     is     of     the     form
              &lt;<u>type:job_id[:job_id][,type:job_id[:job_id]]</u>&gt;.   Many jobs can share the same dependency and these
              jobs may even belong to different  users.

              <b>after:job_id[:jobid...]</b>
                     This job can begin execution  after  the  specified  jobs  have  begun  execution  or  been
                     canceled.

              <b>afterany:job_id[:jobid...]</b>
                     This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated.

              <b>afternotok:job_id[:jobid...]</b>
                     This  job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated in some failed state
                     (non-zero exit code, node failure, timed out, etc).  This dependency must  be  added  while
                     the  specified  job is still active or within <b>MinJobAge</b> seconds after the specified job has
                     ended.

              <b>afterok:job_id[:jobid...]</b>
                     This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have successfully  executed  (ran  to
                     completion  with  an exit code of zero).  This dependency must be added while the specified
                     job is still active or within <b>MinJobAge</b> seconds after the specified job has ended.

              <b>singleton</b>
                     This job can begin execution after any previously launched jobs sharing the same  job  name
                     and user have terminated.  In other words, only one job by that name and owned by that user
                     can be running or suspended at any point in time.

       <b>EligibleTime</b>=&lt;<u>time_spec</u>&gt;
              See <u>StartTime</u>.

       <b>EndTime</b>
              The time the job is expected to terminate based on the job's time limit. When the job ends sooner,
              this field will be updated with the actual end time.

       <b>ExcNodeList</b>=&lt;<u>nodes</u>&gt;
              Set  the job's list of excluded node. Multiple node names may be specified using simple node range
              expressions (e.g. "lx[10-20]").  Value may be cleared with blank data value, "ExcNodeList=".

       <b>Extra</b>=&lt;<u>spec</u>&gt;
              An arbitrary string enclosed  in  single  or  double  quotes  if  using  spaces  or  some  special
              characters. See &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/extra_constraints.html&gt; for more details.

       <b>Features</b>=&lt;<u>features</u>&gt;
              Set  the  job's  required  node features.  The list of features may include multiple feature names
              separated   by   ampersand   (AND)   and/or   vertical   bar   (OR)   operators.    For   example:
              <b>Features="opteron&amp;video"</b>  or <b>Features="fast|faster"</b>.  In the first example, only nodes having both
              the feature "opteron" AND the feature "video" will be used.  There is no mechanism to specify that
              you want one node with feature "opteron" and another node with feature "video" in case no node has
              both features.  If only one of a set of possible options should be used for all  allocated  nodes,
              then  use  the  OR  operator  and  enclose  the  options  within  square  brackets.   For example:
              "<b>Features=[rack1|rack2|rack3|rack4]"</b> might be used to specify that all nodes must be allocated  on
              a single rack of the cluster, but any of those four racks can be used.  A request can also specify
              the  number of nodes needed with some feature by appending an asterisk and count after the feature
              name.  For example "<b>Features=graphics*4"</b> indicates that at least four allocated  nodes  must  have
              the  feature  "graphics."   Parenthesis are also supported for features to be ANDed together.  For
              example "<b>Features=[(knl&amp;a2a&amp;flat)*4&amp;haswell*2]"</b> indicates the resource allocation should include 4
              nodes with ALL of the features "knl", "a2a", and "flat" plus 2 nodes with the  feature  "haswell".
              Constraints  with  node counts may only be combined with AND operators.  Value may be cleared with
              blank data value, for example "Features=".

       <b>Gres</b>=&lt;<u>list</u>&gt;
              Specifies a comma-delimited list of generic consumable resources.  The format of each entry on the
              list is "name[:count[*cpu]]".  The name is that of the consumable  resource.   The  count  is  the
              number of those resources with a default value of 1.  The specified resources will be allocated to
              the  job  on  each  node  allocated unless "*cpu" is appended, in which case the resources will be
              allocated on a per cpu basis.  The available generic consumable resources is configurable  by  the
              system  administrator.   A  list of available generic consumable resources will be printed and the
              command  will  exit   if   the   option   argument   is   "help".    Examples   of   use   include
              "Gres=gpus:2*cpu,disk=40G" and "Gres=help".

       <b>JobId</b>=&lt;<u>job_list</u>&gt;
              Identify the job(s) to be updated.  The job_list may be a comma separated list of job IDs.  Either
              <u>JobId</u> or <u>JobName</u> is required.  If the <u>JobId</u> is equal to the <u>ArrayJobID</u> then the update will affect
              all  of the individual jobs of the array. In that case, to update the specific individual job, the
              form &lt;<u>ArrayJobID</u>&gt;_&lt;<u>ArrayTaskId</u>&gt; must be used.

       <b>Licenses</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Specification of licenses (or other resources available on all nodes of the cluster) as  described
              in salloc/sbatch/srun man pages.

       <b>MailType</b>=&lt;<u>types</u>&gt;
              Set  the  mail event types. Valid type values are NONE, BEGIN, END, FAIL, REQUEUE, ALL (equivalent
              to BEGIN, END, FAIL, REQUEUE, and STAGE_OUT), STAGE_OUT  (burst  buffer  stage  out  and  teardown
              completed),  TIME_LIMIT,  TIME_LIMIT_90 (reached 90 percent of time limit), TIME_LIMIT_80 (reached
              80 percent of time limit), TIME_LIMIT_50 (reached 50 percent of time limit) and ARRAY_TASKS  (send
              emails  for  each  array  task).  Multiple type values may be specified in a comma separated list.
              Unless the ARRAY_TASKS option is specified, mail notifications on job BEGIN, END and FAIL apply to
              a job array as a whole rather than generating individual email messages for each task in  the  job
              array.

       <b>MailUser</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Set the user to receive email notification of state changes. A blank string will set the mail user
              to the default which is the submitting user.

       <b>MinCPUsNode</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;
              Set the job's minimum number of CPUs per node to the specified value.

       <b>MinMemoryCPU</b>=&lt;<u>megabytes</u>&gt;
              Set  the  job's  minimum  real  memory  required  per allocated CPU to the specified value. Either
              <u>MinMemoryCPU</u> or <u>MinMemoryNode</u> may be set, but not both.

       <b>MinMemoryNode</b>=&lt;<u>megabytes</u>&gt;
              Set the job's minimum real memory required per node to the specified value.   Either  <u>MinMemoryCPU</u>
              or <u>MinMemoryNode</u> may be set, but not both.

       <b>MinTmpDiskNode</b>=&lt;<u>megabytes</u>&gt;
              Set  the  job's  minimum  temporary disk space required per node to the specified value.  Only the
              Slurm administrator or root can change this parameter.

       <b>TimeMin</b>=&lt;<u>timespec</u>&gt;
              Change TimeMin value which specifies the minimum time limit minutes of the job.

       <b>JobName</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Identify the name of jobs to be modified or set the job's name to the specified value.  When  used
              to  identify  jobs  to be modified, all jobs belonging to all users are modified unless the <u>UserID</u>
              option is used to identify a specific user.  Either <u>JobId</u> or <u>JobName</u> is required.

       <b>Name</b>[=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;]
              See JobName.

       <b>Nice</b>[=&lt;<u>adjustment</u>&gt;]
              Update the job with an adjusted scheduling priority within Slurm. With  no  adjustment  value  the
              scheduling  priority  is decreased by 100. A negative nice value increases the priority, otherwise
              decreases it. The adjustment range is +/- 2147483645. Only privileged users can specify a negative
              adjustment.

       <b>NodeList</b>=&lt;<u>nodes</u>&gt;
              Change the nodes allocated to a running job to shrink its size.  The specified list of nodes  must
              be  a  subset  of  the  nodes currently allocated to the job. Multiple node names may be specified
              using simple node range expressions (e.g. "lx[10-20]").  After  a  job's  allocation  is  reduced,
              subsequent  <b>srun</b> commands must explicitly specify node and task counts which are valid for the new
              allocation.

              <b>NOTE</b>: The allocated nodes of jobs with arbitrary distribution can not be updated.

       <b>NumCPUs</b>=&lt;<u>min_count</u>&gt;[-&lt;<u>max_count</u>&gt;]
              Set the job's minimum and optionally maximum count of CPUs to be allocated.

       <b>NumNodes</b>=&lt;<u>min_count</u>&gt;[-&lt;<u>max_count</u>&gt;]
              Set the job's minimum and optionally maximum count of nodes  to  be  allocated.   If  the  job  is
              already  running,  use  this  to  specify a node count less than currently allocated and resources
              previously allocated to the job will  be  relinquished.  After  a  job's  allocation  is  reduced,
              subsequent  <b>srun</b> commands must explicitly specify node and task counts which are valid for the new
              allocation. Also see the <u>NodeList</u> parameter above. This is the same as ReqNodes.

              <b>NOTE</b>: The node count of jobs with arbitrary distribution can not be updated.

       <b>NumTasks</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;
              Set the job's count of requested tasks to the specified value.  The number of tasks started  in  a
              specific  step  inside  the  allocation  may differ from this value, for instance when a different
              number of tasks is requested on step creation. This is the same as ReqProcs.

       <b>OverSubscribe</b>={yes|no}
              Set the job's ability to share compute resources (i.e. individual CPUs) with other jobs.  Possible
              values are "YES" and "NO".  This option can only be changed for pending jobs.

       <b>Partition</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Set the job's partition to the specified value.

       <b>Prefer</b>=&lt;<u>features</u>&gt;
              Set the job's preferred node features. This list is only preferred, not required like <u>Features</u> is.
              This list will override what is requested in Features.  See <u>Features</u> option above.

       <b>Priority</b>=&lt;<u>number</u>&gt;
              Set  the job's priority to the specified value.  Note that a job priority of zero prevents the job
              from ever being scheduled.  By setting a job's priority to zero it is held.  Set the priority to a
              non-zero value to permit it to run.  Explicitly setting a job's priority clears any previously set
              nice value and removes the priority/multifactor plugin's ability to manage a job's  priority.   In
              order  to  restore  the priority/multifactor plugin's ability to manage a job's priority, hold and
              then release the job.  Only the Slurm administrator or root can increase job's priority.

       <b>QOS</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Set the job's QOS (Quality Of Service) to the specified value, or comma separated list of QOS.  If
              requesting a list it will be ordered based on the priority of the QOS given with the  first  being
              the highest priority.  Value may be cleared with blank data value, "QOS=".

       <b>Reboot</b>={yes|no}
              Set  the  job's flag that specifies whether to force the allocated nodes to reboot before starting
              the job. This is only supported with some system configurations and therefore it could be silently
              ignored.

       <b>ReqCores</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;
              Change the job's requested Cores count.

       <b>ReqNodeList</b>=&lt;<u>nodes</u>&gt;
              Set the job's list of required node. Multiple node names may be specified using simple node  range
              expressions (e.g. "lx[10-20]").  Value may be cleared with blank data value, "ReqNodeList=".

       <b>ReqNodes</b>=&lt;<u>min_count</u>&gt;[-&lt;<u>max_count</u>&gt;]
              See NumNodes.

       <b>ReqProcs</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;
              See NumTasks.

       <b>ReqSockets</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;
              Change the job's requested socket count.

       <b>ReqThreads</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;
              Change the job's requested threads count.

       <b>Requeue</b>={0|1}
              Stipulates whether a job should be requeued after a node failure: 0 for no, 1 for yes.

       <b>ReservationName</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Set  the  job's  reservation  to the specified value.  Value may be cleared with blank data value,
              "ReservationName=".

       <b>ResetAccrueTime</b>
              Set the job's accrue time value to 'now' meaning it will lose  any  time  previously  accrued  for
              priority.  Helpful  if  you  have  a  large  queue  of jobs already in the queue and want to start
              limiting how many jobs can accrue time without waiting for the queue to flush out.

       <b>SiteFactor</b>=&lt;<u>account</u>&gt;
              Specify the job's admin priority factor in the range of +/-2147483645.  Only privileged users  can
              modify the value.

       <b>StdErr</b>=&lt;<u>filepath</u>&gt;
              Set  the  batch  job's stderr file path.  Value may be reset to job default with blank data value,
              "StdErr=".

              <b>NOTE</b>: By default, StdErr will be merged into StdOut.

       <b>StdIn</b>=&lt;<u>filepath</u>&gt;
              Set the batch job's stdin file path.  Value may be reset to job default  with  blank  data  value,
              "StdIn=".

              <b>NOTE</b>: By default, StdIn will be '/dev/null'.

       <b>StdOut</b>=&lt;<u>filepath</u>&gt;
              Set  the  batch  job's stdout file path.  Value may be reset to job default with blank data value,
              "StdOut=".

              <b>NOTE</b>: By default, StdOut will be based on the <u>JobId</u>.

       <b>Shared</b>={yes|no}
              See <u>OverSubscribe</u> option above.

       <b>StartTime</b>=&lt;<u>time_spec</u>&gt;
              Set the job's earliest initiation time.  It accepts times of the form <u>HH:MM:SS</u> to run a job  at  a
              specific  time  of  day  (seconds  are  optional).  (If that time is already past, the next day is
              assumed.)  You may also specify <u>midnight</u>, <u>noon</u>, <u>elevenses</u> (11 AM), <u>fika</u> (3 PM) or <u>teatime</u>  (4  PM)
              and  you  can have a time-of-day suffixed with <u>AM</u> or <u>PM</u> for running in the morning or the evening.
              You can also say what day the job will be run, by specifying a date of the form <u>MMDDYY</u> or <u>MM/DD/YY</u>
              or <u>MM.DD.YY</u>, or a date and time as <u>YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]</u>. You can also give  times  like  <u>now</u>  <u>+</u>
              <u>count</u>  <u>time-units</u>,  where  the time-units can be <u>seconds</u> (default), <u>minutes</u>, <u>hours</u>, <u>days</u>, or <u>weeks</u>
              and you can tell Slurm to run the job today with the keyword <u>today</u> and to  run  the  job  tomorrow
              with the keyword <u>tomorrow</u>.

              Notes on date/time specifications:
               -  although  the  'seconds' field of the HH:MM:SS time specification is allowed by the code, note
              that the poll time of the Slurm scheduler is not precise enough to guarantee dispatch of  the  job
              on  the  exact  second. The job will be eligible to start on the next poll following the specified
              time. The exact poll interval depends on the Slurm scheduler (e.g., 60 seconds  with  the  default
              sched/builtin).
               - if no time (HH:MM:SS) is specified, the default is (00:00:00).
               -  if  a  date is specified without a year (e.g., MM/DD) then the current year is assumed, unless
              the combination of MM/DD and HH:MM:SS has already passed for that year, in  which  case  the  next
              year is used.

       <b>Switches</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;[@&lt;<u>max-time-to-wait</u>&gt;]
              When  a  tree  topology  is  used,  this defines the maximum count of switches desired for the job
              allocation. If Slurm finds an allocation containing more switches than the  count  specified,  the
              job remain pending until it either finds an allocation with desired switch count or the time limit
              expires.  By default there is no switch count limit and no time limit delay. Set the count to zero
              in order to clean any previously set count (disabling the limit).  The job's  maximum  time  delay
              may  be  limited by the system administrator using the <b>SchedulerParameters</b> configuration parameter
              with the <b>max_switch_wait</b> parameter option.  Also see <u>wait-for-switch</u>.

       <b>wait-for-switch</b>=&lt;<u>seconds</u>&gt;
              Change max time to wait for a switch &lt;seconds&gt; secs.

       <b>TasksPerNode</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;
              Change the job's requested TasksPerNode.

       <b>ThreadSpec</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;
              Number of threads to reserve per node for system use.  The job will be charged for these  threads,
              but be unable to use them.  Will be reported as "*" if not constrained.

       <b>TimeLimit</b>=&lt;<u>time</u>&gt;
              The job's time limit.  Output format is [days-]hours:minutes:seconds or "UNLIMITED".  Input format
              (for   <b>update</b>   command)  set  is  minutes,  minutes:seconds,  hours:minutes:seconds,  days-hours,
              days-hours:minutes or days-hours:minutes:seconds.  Time resolution is one minute and second values
              are rounded up to the next minute.  If changing the time limit of a job, either specify a new time
              limit value or precede the time and equal sign with a "+" or "-" to  increment  or  decrement  the
              current  time  limit  (e.g.  "TimeLimit+=30"). In order to increment or decrement the current time
              limit, the <u>JobId</u> specification must precede the <u>TimeLimit</u> specification.  Note  that  incrementing
              or decrementing the time limit for a job array is only allowed before the job array has been split
              into more than one job record.  Only the Slurm administrator or root can increase job's TimeLimit.

       <b>UserID</b>=&lt;<u>UID</u> or <u>name</u>&gt;
              Used  with  the  <u>JobName</u> option to identify jobs to be modified.  Either a user name or numeric ID
              (UID), may be specified.

       <b>WCKey</b>=&lt;<u>key</u>&gt;
              Set the job's workload characterization key to the specified value.

       <b>WorkDir</b>=&lt;<u>directory_name</u>&gt;
              Set the job's working directory to the specified value. Note that this may only be set for jobs in
              the PENDING state, and that jobs may fail to  launch  if  they  rely  on  relative  paths  to  the
              originally submitted WorkDir.

</pre><h4><b>JOBS</b> <b>-</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>SHOW</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       The  "show" command, when used with the "job" or "job &lt;jobid&gt;" entity displays detailed information about
       a job or jobs. Much of this information may be modified using  the  "update  job"  command  as  described
       above.  However,  the  following  fields  displayed  by  the show job command are read-only and cannot be
       modified:

       <b>AllocNode:Sid</b>
              Local node and system id making the resource allocation.

       <b>BatchFlag</b>
              Jobs submitted using the sbatch command have BatchFlag set to 1. The BatchFlag will be incremented
              past 1 if the job is requeued due to a failure. Jobs submitted using other commands have BatchFlag
              set to 0 and will not be incremented.

       <b>ExitCode</b>=&lt;<u>exit</u>&gt;:&lt;<u>sig</u>&gt;
              Exit status reported for the job by the wait() function.  The  first  number  is  the  exit  code,
              typically  as set by the exit() function.  The second number of the signal that caused the process
              to terminate if it was terminated by a signal.

       <b>GroupId</b>
              The group under which the job was submitted.

       <b>JobState</b>
              The current state of the job.

       <b>NodeListIndices</b>
              The NodeIndices expose the internal indices into  the  node  table  associated  with  the  node(s)
              allocated to the job.

       <b>NtasksPerN:B:S:C</b>=&lt;<u>tasks_per_node</u>&gt;:&lt;<u>tasks_per_baseboard</u>&gt;:&lt;<u>tasks_per_socket</u>&gt;:&lt;<u>tasks_per_core</u>&gt;
              Specifies  the  number  of tasks to be started per hardware component (node, baseboard, socket and
              core).  Unconstrained values may be shown as "0" or "*".

       <b>PreemptEligibleTime</b>
              Time the job becomes eligible for preemption.  Modified  by  PreemptExemptTime,  either  from  the
              global  option  in  slurm.conf  or  the  job  QOS. This is hidden if the job has not started or if
              PreemptMode=OFF.

       <b>PreemptTime</b>
              Time at which job was signaled that it was selected for preemption.  This value is only meaningful
              for <u>PreemptMode=CANCEL</u> and <u>PreemptMode=REQUEUE</u> and for jobs in a  partition  or  QOS  that  has  a
              GraceTime value designated. This is hidden if the job has not started or if <u>PreemptMode=OFF</u>.

       <b>PreSusTime</b>
              Time the job ran prior to last suspend.

       <b>Reason</b> The  reason a job has not been started by the scheduler: e.g., waiting for "Resources". Details of
              job reason codes are found on this page: &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_reason_codes.html&gt;

       <b>ReqB:S:C:T</b>=&lt;<u>baseboard_count</u>&gt;:&lt;<u>socket_per_baseboard_count</u>&gt;:&lt;<u>core_per_socket_count</u>&gt;:&lt;<u>thread_per_core_count</u>&gt;
              Specifies the count of various hardware components requested by the job.  Unconstrained values may
              be shown as "0" or "*".

       <b>SecsPreSuspend</b>=&lt;<u>seconds</u>&gt;
              If the job is suspended, this is the run time accumulated by the job (in seconds) prior  to  being
              suspended.

       <b>Socks/Node</b>=&lt;count&gt;
              Count of desired sockets per node

       <b>SubmitTime</b>
              The  time   and   date  stamp  (in  localtime) the job was submitted.  The format of the output is
              identical to that of the EndTime field.

              <b>NOTE</b>: If a job is requeued, the submit time is reset.  To obtain the original submit  time  it  is
              necessary to use the "sacct -j &lt;job_id[.&lt;step_id&gt;]" command also designating the -D or --duplicate
              option to display all duplicate entries for a job.

       <b>SuspendTime</b>
              Time the job was last suspended or resumed.

              NOTE on information displayed for various job states: When you submit a request for the "show job"
              function  the  scontrol  process  makes  an  RPC request call to slurmctld with a REQUEST_JOB_INFO
              message type. If the state of the job is PENDING, then it returns some detail information such as:
              min_nodes, min_procs, cpus_per_task, etc. If the state is other than PENDING the code assumes that
              it is in a further state such as RUNNING, COMPLETE,  etc.  In  these  cases  the  code  explicitly
              returns  zero  for  these  values.  These  values are meaningless once the job resources have been
              allocated and the job has started.

</pre><h4><b>STEPS</b> <b>-</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>UPDATE</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       <b>StepId</b>=&lt;<u>job_id</u>&gt;[.&lt;<u>step_id</u>&gt;]
              Identify the step to be updated.  If the job_id is given, but no step_id  is  specified  then  all
              steps of the identified job will be modified.  This specification is required.

       <b>TimeLimit</b>=&lt;<u>time</u>&gt;
              The job's time limit.  Output format is [days-]hours:minutes:seconds or "UNLIMITED".  Input format
              (for   <b>update</b>   command)  set  is  minutes,  minutes:seconds,  hours:minutes:seconds,  days-hours,
              days-hours:minutes or days-hours:minutes:seconds.  Time resolution is one minute and second values
              are rounded up to the next minute.  If changing the time limit of a step,  either  specify  a  new
              time  limit value or precede the time with a "+" or "-" to increment or decrement the current time
              limit (e.g. "TimeLimit=+30"). In order to increment or  decrement  the  current  time  limit,  the
              <u>StepId</u> specification must precede the <u>TimeLimit</u> specification.

</pre><h4><b>NODES</b> <b>-</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CREATE</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       Provide  the same NodeName configuration as found in the slurm.conf. See slurm.conf man page for details.
       Only State=CLOUD and State=FUTURE nodes are allowed.

</pre><h4><b>NODES</b> <b>-</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>UPDATE</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NodeName</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Identify the node(s) to be updated. Multiple node names may be specified using simple  node  range
              expressions  (e.g.  "lx[10-20]").  Nodesets can also be specified by themselves or mixed with node
              range expressions, using a comma as a list separator. If the keyword  "ALL"  is  specified  alone,
              then  the  update will be attempted against all the nodes in the local cluster. This specification
              is required.

       <b>ActiveFeatures</b>=&lt;<u>features</u>&gt;
              Identify the feature(s) currently active on the specified node.   Any  previously  active  feature
              specification  will  be  overwritten  with  the new value.  Also see <u>AvailableFeatures</u>.  Typically
              <u>ActiveFeatures</u> will be identical to <u>AvailableFeatures</u>; however <u>ActiveFeatures</u> may be configured as
              a subset of the <u>AvailableFeatures</u>. For example, a node may be booted in  multiple  configurations.
              In  that  case,  all  possible  configurations  may  be  identified  as  <u>AvailableFeatures</u>,  while
              <u>ActiveFeatures</u> would identify the current node configuration.  When  updating  the  ActiveFeatures
              with  scontrol,  the  change  is  only  made  in  slurmctld. When using a node_features plugin the
              state/features of the node must be updated on the node such that a new node start will report  the
              updated state/features.

       <b>AvailableFeatures</b>=&lt;<u>features</u>&gt;
              Identify the feature(s) available on the specified node.  Any previously defined available feature
              specification  will  be  overwritten  with the new value.  AvailableFeatures assigned via <b>scontrol</b>
              will only persist across the restart of the slurmctld daemon with the <u>-R</u> option  and  state  files
              preserved  or  slurmctld's  receipt  of  a SIGHUP.  Update slurm.conf with any changes meant to be
              persistent across normal restarts of slurmctld or the execution of <b>scontrol</b> <b>reconfig</b>.

              <b>NOTE</b>: Available features being removed via <b>scontrol</b> must not be  active  (i.e.  remove  them  from
              <u>ActiveFeatures</u> first).

       <b>Comment</b>=&lt;<u>comment</u>&gt;
              Arbitrary descriptive string.  Use quotes to enclose a comment having more than one word

       <b>CpuBind</b>=&lt;<u>node</u>&gt;
              Specify  the  task  binding  mode to be used by default for this node.  Supported options include:
              "none", "socket", "ldom" (NUMA), "core", "thread" and "off" (remove previous binding mode).

       <b>Extra</b>=&lt;<u>comment</u>&gt;
              Arbitrary string on the node. Use quotes to enclose a  string  having  more  than  one  word.  See
              &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/extra_constraints.html&gt; for more details.

       <b>Gres</b>=&lt;<u>gres</u>&gt;
              Identify  generic  resources  to  be  associated  with  the specified node. Any previously defined
              generic resources will be overwritten with the new value.   Specifications  for  multiple  generic
              resources  should  be comma separated.  Each resource specification consists of a name followed by
              an optional colon with a numeric value  (default  value  is  one)  (e.g.  "Gres=bandwidth:10000").
              Modification of GRES count associated with specific files (e.g. GPUs) is not allowed other than to
              set  their  count  on  a node to zero.  In order to change the GRES count to another value, modify
              your slurm.conf and gres.conf files and restart daemons.  If GRES  are  associated  with  specific
              sockets,  that information will be reported For example if all 4 GPUs on a node are all associated
              with  socket  zero,  then  "Gres=gpu:4(S:0)".  If  associated  with   sockets   0   and   1   then
              "Gres=gpu:4(S:0-1)".   The information of which specific GPUs are associated with specific GPUs is
              not reported, but only available by parsing the gres.conf file.  Generic  resources  assigned  via
              <b>scontrol</b> will only persist across the restart of the slurmctld daemon with the <u>-R</u> option and state
              files  preserved  or slurmctld's receipt of a SIGHUP.  Update slurm.conf with any changes meant to
              be persistent across normal restarts of slurmctld or the execution of <b>scontrol</b> <b>reconfig</b>.

       <b>InstanceId</b>=&lt;<u>instance_id</u>&gt;
              Cloud instance ID.

       <b>InstanceType</b>=&lt;<u>instance_type</u>&gt;
              Cloud instance type.

       <b>NodeAddr</b>=&lt;<u>node</u> <u>address</u>&gt;
              Name that a node should be referred to in establishing a communications path.  This name  will  be
              used  as  an argument to the getaddrinfo() function for identification. If a node range expression
              is used to designate multiple nodes, they must exactly match the entries  in  the  <u>NodeName</u>  (e.g.
              "NodeName=lx[0-7] NodeAddr=elx[0-7]"). <u>NodeAddr</u> may also contain IP addresses.

       <b>NodeHostname</b>=&lt;<u>node</u> <u>hostname</u>&gt;
              Typically  this  would  be  the  string that "<a href="file:/bin/hostname">/bin/hostname</a> -s" returns.  It may also be the fully
              qualified domain name as returned by "<a href="file:/bin/hostname">/bin/hostname</a> -f" (e.g. "foo1.bar.com"), or any valid domain
              name associated with the host through the host database (<a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>)  or  DNS,  depending  on  the
              resolver  settings. Note that if the short form of the hostname is not used, it may prevent use of
              hostlist expressions (the numeric portion in brackets must be at the end of the  string).  A  node
              range  expression  can  be used to specify a set of nodes. If an expression is used, the number of
              nodes identified by <u>NodeHostname</u> must be identical to the number of nodes identified by <u>NodeName</u>.

       <b>Reason</b>=&lt;<u>reason</u>&gt;
              Identify the reason the node is in a "DOWN", "DRAINED", "DRAINING",  "FAILING"  or  "FAIL"  state.
              Use quotes to enclose a reason having more than one word.

       <b>ResumeAfter</b>=&lt;<u>seconds</u>&gt;
              Schedule  a node state resume after this amount of seconds, when its state is updated to "DOWN" or
              "DRAIN".  Upon state resume, the node's state will be changed from <b>DRAIN</b>, <b>DRAINING</b>, <b>DOWN</b> or <b>REBOOT</b>
              to <b>IDLE</b> and <b>NoResp</b>.  slurmctld will then attempt to  contact  slurmd  to  request  that  the  node
              register itself.

              <b>NOTE</b>: A value of -1 will unschedule the node state resume.

       <b>State</b>=&lt;<u>state</u>&gt;
              Assign one of the following states/actions to the node(s) specified by the update command.

              <b>CANCEL_REBOOT</b>
                     Cancels a pending reboot on the node (same as <u>scontrol</u> <u>cancel_reboot</u> <u>&lt;node&gt;</u>).

              <b>DOWN</b>   Stop all running and suspended jobs and make the node unavailable for new jobs.

              <b>DRAIN</b>  Indicates that no new jobs may be started on this node. Existing jobs are allowed to run to
                     completion, leaving the node in a <b>DRAINED</b> state once all the jobs have completed.

              <b>FAIL</b>   Similar  to  <b>DRAIN</b> except that some applications will seek to relinquish those nodes before
                     the job completes.

              <b>FUTURE</b> Indicates the node is not fully configured, but is expected to be available at  some  point
                     in the future.

              <b>IDLE</b>   Will  clear  <b>DOWN</b>, <b>DRAIN</b> and <b>FAIL</b> states.  Will set the state to <b>IDLE</b> and <b>NoResp</b>. slurmctld
                     will then attempt to contact slurmd  to  request  that  the  node  register  itself.   Once
                     registered,  the  node  state  will  then  remove  the  <b>NoResp</b>  flag and will resume normal
                     operations.

              <b>NoResp</b> This will set the "Not Responding" flag for a node without changing its underlying state.

              <b>RESUME</b> Not an actual node state, but will change a node state from <b>DRAIN</b>, <b>DRAINING</b>, <b>DOWN</b> or <b>REBOOT</b>
                     to <b>IDLE</b> and <b>NoResp</b>.  slurmctld will then attempt to contact slurmd to request that the node
                     register itself. Once registered, the node state will then remove the <b>NoResp</b> flag and  will
                     resume  normal operations. It will also clear the <b>POWERING_DOWN</b> state of a node and make it
                     eligible to be allocated.

              <b>UNDRAIN</b>
                     Clears the node from being drained (like <b>RESUME</b>), but will not change the node's base state
                     (e.g. <b>DOWN</b>). <b>UNDRAIN</b> requires a valid node registration before new jobs can be scheduled on
                     the node.  Setting a node <b>DOWN</b> will cause all running and suspended jobs on that node to be
                     terminated.

              While all of the above states are valid, some of them are not valid new node  states  given  their
              prior state.

              <b>NOTE</b>: The scontrol command should not be used to change node state on Cray systems. Use Cray tools
              such as <u>xtprocadmin</u> instead.

       <b>Weight</b>=&lt;<u>weight</u>&gt;
              Identify  weight  to  be  associated  with  specified nodes. This allows dynamic changes to weight
              associated with nodes, which will be used for the subsequent node  allocation  decisions.   Weight
              assigned  via  <b>scontrol</b>  will  only persist across the restart of the slurmctld daemon with the <u>-R</u>
              option and state files preserved or slurmctld's receipt of a SIGHUP.  Update slurm.conf  with  any
              changes  meant  to  be persistent across normal restarts of slurmctld or the execution of <b>scontrol</b>
              <b>reconfig</b>.

</pre><h4><b>NODES</b> <b>-</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>DELETE</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NodeName</b>=&lt;<u>nodes</u>&gt;
              Identify the node(s) to be deleted. Multiple node names may be specified using simple  node  range
              expressions  (e.g.  "lx[10-20]").  Nodesets can also be specified by themselves or mixed with node
              range expressions, using a comma as a list separator. If the keyword  "ALL"  is  specified  alone,
              then  the  update will be attempted against all the nodes in the local cluster. This specification
              is required.

</pre><h4><b>NODES</b> <b>-</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>SHOW</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       <b>AllocMem</b>
              The total memory, in MB, currently allocated by jobs on the node.

       <b>CPULoad</b>
              CPU load of a node as reported by the OS.

       <b>CPUSpecList</b>

              node daemons (slurmd, slurmstepd).

       <b>FreeMem</b>
              The total memory, in MB, currently free on the node as reported by the OS.

       <b>LastBusyTime</b>
              The  last  time  the  node was busy (i.e. last time the node had jobs on it). This time is used in
              PowerSave to determine when to suspend nodes (e.g. now - LastBusy &gt; SuspendTime).

       <b>MemSpecLimit</b>
              The combined memory limit, in megabytes, on this node for the Slurm compute node daemons  (slurmd,
              slurmstepd).

       <b>RealMemory</b>
              The total memory, in MB, on the node.

       <b>State</b>  Identify the state(s) assigned to the node with '+' delimited state flags.

              States:

              <b>ALLOCATED</b>
                     Indicates that the node has all CPUs allocated to job(s) running on the node.

              <b>DOWN</b>   The node does not have any running jobs and is unavailable for new work.

              <b>ERROR</b>  The node is in an error state. Consult the logs for more information about what caused this
                     state.

              <b>FUTURE</b> The  node  is currently not fully configured, but expected to be available at some point in
                     the indefinite future for use.

              <b>IDLE</b>   Indicates that the node is available for work but does not currently have any jobs assigned
                     to it.

              <b>MIXED</b>  Indicates that the node is in multiple states. For instance if only part  of  the  node  is
                     <b>ALLOCATED</b> and the rest of the node is <b>IDLE</b> the state will be <b>MIXED</b>.

              <b>UNKNOWN</b>
                     The node has not yet registered with the controller and its state is not known.

              Flags:

              <b>CLOUD</b>  Indicates  that the node is configured as a cloud node, to be brought up on demand, but not
                     currently running.

              <b>COMPLETING</b>
                     Indicates that the only job on the node or that all jobs on the node are in the process  of
                     completing.

              <b>DRAIN</b>  The node is not accepting any new jobs and any currently running jobs will complete.

              <b>DYNAMIC</b>
                     Slurm allows you to define multiple types of nodes in a FUTURE state.  When starting <b>slurmd</b>
                     on a node you can specify the <b>-F</b> flag to have the node match and use an existing definition
                     in your slurm.conf file. The DYNAMIC state indicates that the node was started as a Dynamic
                     Future node.

              <b>INVALID_REG</b>
                     The node did not register correctly with the controller. This happens when a node registers
                     with  less resources than configured in the slurm.conf file.  The node will clear from this
                     state with a valid registration (i.e. a slurmd restart is required).

              <b>MAINTENANCE</b>
                     The node is currently in a reservation that includes the <u>maintenance</u> flag.

              <b>NOT_RESPONDING</b>
                     Node is not responding.

              <b>PERFCTRS</b>
                     Indicates that Network Performance Counters associated with this node are in use, rendering
                     this node as not usable for any other jobs.

              <b>POWER_DOWN</b>
                     Node is pending power down.

              <b>POWERED_DOWN</b>
                     Node is currently powered down and not capable of running any jobs.

              <b>POWERING_DOWN</b>
                     Node is in the process of powering down.

              <b>POWERING_UP</b>
                     Node is in the process of powering up.

              <b>PLANNED</b>
                     The node is earmarked for a job that will start in the future.

              <b>REBOOT_ISSUED</b>
                     A reboot request has been sent to the agent configured to handle this request.

              <b>REBOOT_REQUESTED</b>
                     A request to reboot this node has been made, but hasn't been handled yet.

              <b>RESERVED</b>
                     Indicates the node is in an advanced reservation and not generally available.

       The meaning of the energy information is as follows:

              <b>CurrentWatts</b>
                     The instantaneous power consumption of the node  at  the  time  of  the  last  node  energy
                     accounting sample, in watts.

              <b>LowestJoules</b>
                     The  energy  consumed by the node between the last time it was powered on and the last time
                     it was registered by slurmd, in joules.

              <b>ConsumedJoules</b>
                     The energy consumed by the node between the last time  it  was  registered  by  the  slurmd
                     daemon and the last node energy accounting sample, in joules.

              If  the  reported  value  is  "n/s"  (not  supported),  the  node  does not support the configured
              <b>AcctGatherEnergyType</b> plugin. If the reported  value  is  zero,  energy  accounting  for  nodes  is
              disabled.

</pre><h4><b>FRONTEND</b> <b>-</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>UPDATE</b> <b>COMMAND</b></h4><pre>
       <b>FrontendName</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Identify the front end node to be updated. This specification is required.

       <b>Reason</b>=&lt;<u>reason</u>&gt;
              Identify  the  reason  the  node  is in a "DOWN" or "DRAIN" state.  Use quotes to enclose a reason
              having more than one word.

       <b>State</b>=&lt;<u>state</u>&gt;
              Identify the state to be assigned to the front end node. Possible values are  "DOWN",  "DRAIN"  or
              "RESUME".   If  you  want  to  remove a front end node from service, you typically want to set its
              state to "DRAIN".  "RESUME" is not an actual node state, but will return a "DRAINED",  "DRAINING",
              or "DOWN" front end node to service, either "IDLE" or "ALLOCATED" state as appropriate.  Setting a
              front end node "DOWN" will cause all running and suspended jobs on that node to be terminated.

</pre><h4><b>PARTITIONS</b> <b>-</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CREATE,</b> <b>UPDATE,</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DELETE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>AllocNodes</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Comma  separated list of nodes from which users can execute jobs in the partition.  Node names may
              be specified using the node range expression syntax described above.  The default value is "ALL".

       <b>AllowAccounts</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Comma-separated list of accounts which may execute jobs in the partition.  The  default  value  is
              "ALL".  This  list  is  hierarchical,  meaning  subaccounts  are included automatically.  <b>NOTE</b>: If
              AllowAccounts is used then DenyAccounts will not be enforced.  Also refer to DenyAccounts.

       <b>AllowGroups</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Identify the user groups which may use this partition.  Multiple groups  may  be  specified  in  a
              comma separated list.  To permit all groups to use the partition specify "AllowGroups=ALL".

       <b>AllowQOS</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Identify  the  QOSs  which  may  use  this  partition.   Multiple QOSs may be specified in a comma
              separated list.  To permit all QOSs to use the partition specify "AllowQOS=ALL".

       <b>Alternate</b>=&lt;<u>partition</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
              Alternate partition to be used if the state of this partition is "DRAIN" or "INACTIVE."  The value
              "NONE" will clear a previously set alternate partition.

       <b>CpuBind</b>=&lt;<u>node</u>&gt;
              Specify the task binding mode to be  used  by  default  for  this  partition.   Supported  options
              include:  "none",  "socket",  "ldom"  (NUMA),  "core", "thread" and "off" (remove previous binding
              mode).

       <b>Default</b>={yes|no}
              Specify if this partition is to be used by jobs which do not explicitly identify  a  partition  to
              use.   Possible  output  values are "YES" and "NO".  In order to change the default partition of a
              running system, use the scontrol update command and set Default=yes for  the  partition  that  you
              want to become the new default.

       <b>DefaultTime</b>=&lt;<u>time</u>&gt;
              Run  time  limit  used  for jobs that don't specify a value. If not set then MaxTime will be used.
              Format is the same as for MaxTime.

       <b>DefMemPerCPU</b>=&lt;<u>MB</u>&gt;
              Set the default memory to be allocated per CPU for jobs in this partition.   The  memory  size  is
              specified in megabytes.

       <b>DefMemPerNode</b>=&lt;<u>MB</u>&gt;
              Set  the  default  memory to be allocated per node for jobs in this partition.  The memory size is
              specified in megabytes.

       <b>DenyAccounts</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Comma-separated list of accounts which may not execute jobs in  the  partition.   By  default,  no
              accounts  are  denied  access.  This  list  is  hierarchical,  meaning  subaccounts  are  included
              automatically.  <b>NOTE</b>: If AllowAccounts is used then DenyAccounts will not be enforced.  Also refer
              to AllowAccounts.

       <b>DenyQOS</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Identify the QOSs which should be denied access to this partition.  Multiple QOSs may be specified
              in a comma separated list.

       <b>DisableRootJobs</b>={yes|no}
              Specify if jobs can be executed as user root.  Possible values are "YES" and "NO".

       <b>ExclusiveUser</b>={yes|no}
              When  enabled  nodes  will  be  exclusively  allocated  to  users.  Multiple  jobs  can   be   run
              simultaneously, but those jobs must be from a single user.

       <b>GraceTime</b>=&lt;<u>seconds</u>&gt;
              Specifies,  in  units of seconds, the preemption grace time to be extended to a job which has been
              selected for preemption.  The default value is zero, no preemption grace time is allowed  on  this
              partition or qos.  (Meaningful only for <u>PreemptMode=CANCEL</u> and <u>PreemptMode=REQUEUE</u>)

       <b>Hidden</b>={yes|no}
              Specify  if  the  partition  and  its  jobs should be hidden from view.  Hidden partitions will by
              default not be reported by Slurm APIs or commands.  Possible values are "YES" and "NO".

       <b>JobDefaults</b>=&lt;<u>specs</u>&gt;
              Specify job default values using a comma-delimited list  of  "key=value"  pairs.   Supported  keys
              include

              <b>DefCpuPerGPU</b>  Default number of CPUs per allocated GPU.

              <b>DefMemPerGPU</b>  Default memory limit (in megabytes) per allocated GPU.

       <b>MaxCPUsPerNode</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;
              Set the maximum number of CPUs that can be allocated per node to all jobs in this partition.

       <b>LLN</b>={yes|no}
              Schedule jobs on the least loaded nodes (based on the number of idle CPUs).

       <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b>=&lt;<u>MB</u>&gt;
              Set  the  maximum  memory  to be allocated per CPU for jobs in this partition.  The memory size is
              specified in megabytes.

       <b>MaxMemPerNode</b>=&lt;<u>MB</u>&gt;
              Set the maximum memory to be allocated per node for jobs in this partition.  The  memory  size  is
              specified in megabytes.

       <b>MaxNodes</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;
              Set  the  maximum  number  of  nodes  which  will be allocated to any single job in the partition.
              Specify a number, "INFINITE" or "UNLIMITED".  Changing the <u>MaxNodes</u> of a partition has  no  effect
              upon jobs that have already begun execution.

       <b>MaxTime</b>=&lt;<u>time</u>&gt;
              The  maximum  run  time  for  jobs.  Output format is [days-]hours:minutes:seconds or "UNLIMITED".
              Input format (for <b>update</b> command) is minutes, minutes:seconds, hours:minutes:seconds,  days-hours,
              days-hours:minutes or days-hours:minutes:seconds.  Time resolution is one minute and second values
              are  rounded  up  to the next minute.  Changing the <u>MaxTime</u> of a partition has no effect upon jobs
              that have already begun execution.

       <b>MinNodes</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;
              Set the minimum number of nodes which will be allocated  to  any  single  job  in  the  partition.
              Changing  the  <u>MinNodes</u>  of a partition has no effect upon jobs that have already begun execution.
              Increasing this value may prevent pending jobs from starting, even if they were submitted  without
              -N/--nodes  specification.   If  you  do  get  in that situation, updating the <u>MinNodes</u> value of a
              pending job using the scontrol command will allow that job to be scheduled.

       <b>MaxCPUsPerSocket</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;
              Set the maximum number of CPUs that can be allocated per socket to all jobs in this partition.

       <b>Nodes</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Identify the node(s) to be associated with this partition. Multiple node names  may  be  specified
              using  simple  node range expressions (e.g. "lx[10-20]").  A specification of "ALL" will associate
              all nodes.  You can add or remove nodes by adding a '+' or '-' sign before the '=' sign.  It  also
              works  to do nodes=+lx0,-lx[2-4] if you want to remove lx[2-4] and add lx0 at the same time.  Note
              that jobs may only be associated with one partition at any time.  Specify a blank  data  value  to
              remove all nodes from a partition: "Nodes=".  Changing the <u>Nodes</u> in a partition has no effect upon
              jobs that have already begun execution.

       <b>OverSubscribe</b>={yes|no|exclusive|force}[:&lt;<u>job_count</u>&gt;]
              Specify  if  compute  resources (i.e. individual CPUs) in this partition can be shared by multiple
              jobs.  Possible values are "YES", "NO", "EXCLUSIVE" and "FORCE".  An optional job count  specifies
              how many jobs can be allocated to use each resource.

       <b>OverTimeLimit</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;
              Number  of minutes by which a job can exceed its time limit before being canceled.  The configured
              job time limit is treated as a <u>soft</u> limit.  Adding <b>OverTimeLimit</b> to the <u>soft</u> limit provides a <u>hard</u>
              limit, at which point the job is canceled.  This is particularly useful for  backfill  scheduling,
              which bases upon each job's soft time limit.  A partition-specific <u>OverTimeLimit</u> will override any
              global  <u>OverTimeLimit</u>  value.   If  not  specified,  the  global  <u>OverTimeLimit</u>  value  will  take
              precedence.  May not exceed  65533  minutes.   An  input  value  of  "UNLIMITED"  will  clear  any
              previously configured partition-specific <u>OverTimeLimit</u> value.

       <b>PartitionName</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Identify the partition to be updated. This specification is required.

       <b>PowerDownOnIdle</b>
              If  set  to "YES", then nodes allocated from this partition will immediately be requested to power
              down upon becoming IDLE. A power down request prevents further scheduling to the node until it has
              been put into power save mode by <b>SuspendProgram</b>.

              Also see <b>SuspendTime</b>.

       <b>PreemptMode</b>=&lt;<u>mode</u>&gt;
              Reset the mechanism used to preempt jobs  in  this  partition  if  <u>PreemptType</u>  is  configured  to
              <u>preempt/partition_prio</u>.  The  default  preemption  mechanism  is  specified  by  the  cluster-wide
              <u>PreemptMode</u>  configuration  parameter.   Possible  values  are  "OFF",  "CANCEL",  "REQUEUE"   and
              "SUSPEND".

       <b>PriorityJobFactor</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;
              Partition  factor  used  by priority/multifactor plugin in calculating job priority. The value may
              not exceed 65533. Also see PriorityTier.

       <b>PriorityTier</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;
              Jobs submitted to a partition with a higher priority tier value will be dispatched before  pending
              jobs in partition with lower priority tier value and,  if  possible,  they  will  preempt  running
              jobs  from partitions with lower priority tier values. Note that a partition's priority tier takes
              precedence over a job's priority. The value may not exceed 65533. Also see PriorityJobFactor.

       <b>QOS</b>=&lt;<u>QOSname</u>|<u>blank</u> <u>to</u> <u>remove</u>&gt;
              Set the partition QOS with a QOS name or to remove the Partition QOS leave the option blank.

       <b>ReqResv</b>={yes|no}
              Specify if only allocation requests designating a reservation will be satisfied. This is  used  to
              restrict  partition  usage to be allowed only within a reservation.  Possible values are "YES" and
              "NO".

       <b>RootOnly</b>={yes|no}
              Specify if only allocation requests initiated by user root will be satisfied.  This can be used to
              restrict control of the partition to some meta-scheduler.  Possible values are "YES" and "NO".

       <b>Shared</b>={yes|no|exclusive|force}[:&lt;<u>job_count</u>&gt;]
              Renamed to <u>OverSubscribe</u>, see option descriptions above.

       <b>State</b>={up|down|drain|inactive}
              Specify if jobs can be allocated nodes or queued in this partition.   Possible  values  are  "UP",
              "DOWN", "DRAIN" and "INACTIVE".

              <b>UP</b>        Designates  that  new  jobs  may queued on the partition, and that jobs may be allocated
                        nodes and run from the partition.

              <b>DOWN</b>      Designates that new jobs may be queued on the partition, but  queued  jobs  may  not  be
                        allocated  nodes  and  run  from  the  partition.  Jobs already running on the partition
                        continue to run. The jobs must be explicitly canceled to force their termination.

              <b>DRAIN</b>     Designates that no new jobs may be queued on the partition (job submission requests will
                        be denied with an error message), but jobs  already  queued  on  the  partition  may  be
                        allocated nodes and run.  See also the "Alternate" partition specification.

              <b>INACTIVE</b>  Designates  that no new jobs may be queued on the partition, and jobs already queued may
                        not be allocated nodes and run.  See also the "Alternate" partition specification.

       <b>TRESBillingWeights</b>=&lt;<u>TRES</u> <u>Billing</u> <u>Weights</u>&gt;
              TRESBillingWeights is used to define the billing weights of each TRES type that will  be  used  in
              calculating  the  usage of a job. The calculated usage is used when calculating fairshare and when
              enforcing the TRES billing limit on jobs.  Updates affect new jobs and not existing jobs.  See the
              slurm.conf man page for more information.

</pre><h4><b>RESERVATIONS</b> <b>-</b> <b>SPECIFICATIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>CREATE,</b> <b>UPDATE,</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DELETE</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ReservationName</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Identify the name of the reservation to be  created,  updated,  or  deleted.   This  parameter  is
              required  for update and is the only parameter for delete.  For create, if you do not want to give
              a  reservation  name,  use  "scontrol  create  reservation  ..."  and  a  name  will  be   created
              automatically.

       <b>Accounts</b>=&lt;<u>account</u> <u>list</u>&gt;
              List  of accounts permitted to use the reserved nodes, for example "Accounts=physcode1,physcode2".
              A user in any of the specified  accounts  or  subaccounts  may  use  the  reserved  nodes.  A  new
              reservation  must  specify Users or Groups and/or Accounts.  If both Users/Groups and Accounts are
              specified, a job must match both in order to use the reservation.  Accounts  can  also  be  denied
              access  to  reservations  by  preceding all of the account names with '-'. Alternately precede the
              equal     sign     with     '-'.      For     example,     "Accounts=-physcode1,-physcode2"     or
              "Accounts-=physcode1,physcode2"  will permit any account except physcode1 and physcode2 to use the
              reservation.  You can add or remove individual accounts from an existing reservation by using  the
              update command and adding a '+' or '-' sign before the '=' sign.  If accounts are denied access to
              a  reservation (account name preceded by a '-'), then all other accounts are implicitly allowed to
              use the reservation and it is not possible to also explicitly specify allowed accounts.  Root  and
              the SlurmUser are given access to all reservations, regardless of the accounts set here.

       <b>BurstBuffer</b>=&lt;<u>buffer_spec</u>&gt;[,&lt;<u>buffer_spec</u>&gt;,...]
              Specification  of burst buffer resources which are to be reserved.  "buffer_spec" consists of four
              elements: [plugin:][type:]#[units] "plugin" is the burst  buffer  plugin  name,  currently  either
              "datawarp"  or  "generic".   If  no plugin is specified, the reservation applies to all configured
              burst buffer plugins.  "type" specifies a Cray generic burst buffer resource, for example "nodes".
              if "type" is not specified, the number is a measure of storage space.   The  "units"  may  be  "N"
              (nodes),  "K|KiB",  "M|MiB",  "G|GiB", "T|TiB", "P|PiB" (for powers of 1024) and "KB", "MB", "GB",
              "TB", "PB" (for powers of 1000).  The default units are bytes for reservations of  storage  space.
              For  example "BurstBuffer=datawarp:2TB" (reserve 2TB of storage plus 3 nodes from the Cray plugin)
              or "BurstBuffer=100GB" (reserve 100 GB of storage from all configured burst buffer plugins).  Jobs
              using this reservation are not restricted to these burst  buffer  resources,  but  may  use  these
              reserved resources plus any which are generally available.  <b>NOTE</b>: Usually Slurm interprets KB, MB,
              GB,  TB, PB units as powers of 1024, but for Burst Buffers size specifications Slurm supports both
              IEC/SI formats.  This is because the CRAY API for managing DataWarps supports both formats.

       <b>CoreCnt</b>=&lt;<u>num</u>&gt;
              This option is only supported when <u>select/cons_tres</u> is  used.  Identify  number  of  cores  to  be
              reserved.  If NodeCnt or Nodelist is used this is the total number of cores to reserve where cores
              per node is CoreCnt/NodeCnt.

       <b>Licenses</b>=&lt;<u>license</u>&gt;
              Specification  of licenses (or other resources available on all nodes of the cluster) which are to
              be reserved.  License names can be followed by a colon and  count  (the  default  count  is  one).
              Multiple  license  names should be comma separated (e.g. "Licenses=foo:4,bar").  A new reservation
              must specify one or  more  resource  to  be  included:  NodeCnt,  Nodes  and/or  Licenses.   If  a
              reservation  includes  Licenses,  but no NodeCnt or Nodes, then the option <u>Flags=LICENSE_ONLY</u> must
              also be specified.  Jobs using this reservation are not restricted to these licenses, but may  use
              these reserved licenses plus any which are generally available.

       <b>MaxStartDelay</b>[=&lt;<u>timespec</u>&gt;]
              Change  MaxStartDelay  value  which specifies the maximum time an eligible job not requesting this
              reservation can delay  a  job  requesting  it.  Default  is  none.   Valid  formats  are  minutes,
              minutes:seconds,          hours:minutes:seconds,          days-hours,          days-hours:minutes,
              days-hours:minutes:seconds. Time resolution is one minute and second values are rounded up to  the
              next minute. Output format is always [days-]hours:minutes:seconds.

       <b>NodeCnt</b>=&lt;<u>num</u>&gt;[,&lt;<u>num</u>&gt;,...]
              Identify  number  of nodes to be reserved. The number can include a suffix of "k" or "K", in which
              case the number specified is multiplied by 1024.  A new  reservation  must  specify  one  or  more
              resource to be included: NodeCnt, Nodes and/or Licenses.

       <b>Nodes</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Identify  the node(s) to be reserved. Multiple node names may be specified using simple node range
              expressions (e.g. "Nodes=lx[10-20]").  When using <b>Nodes</b> to specify more or  fewer  nodes,  <b>NodeCnt</b>
              will  be updated to honor the new number of nodes. However, when setting an empty list ("Nodes="),
              the nodelist will be filled with random nodes to fulfill the previous nodecnt and  the  <u>SPEC_NODES</u>
              flag  will  be  removed.   A  new  reservation  must  specify one or more resource to be included:
              NodeCnt,  Nodes  and/or  Licenses.  A  specification  of  "ALL"  will  reserve  all   nodes.   Set
              <u>Flags=PART_NODES</u>  and <u>PartitionName=</u> in order for changes in the nodes associated with a partition
              to also be reflected in the nodes associated with a reservation. You can add or remove nodes  from
              an  existing  reservation  by  adding  a  '+' or '-' sign before the '=' sign. It also works to do
              nodes=+lx0,-lx[2-4] if you want to remove lx[2-4] and add lx0 at the same time.

              <b>NOTE</b>: When updating a reservation, if Nodes and  Nodecnt  are  set  simultaneously,  nodecnt  will
              always  be  honored. The reservation will get a subset of nodes if nodes &gt; nodecnt, or it will add
              extra nodes to the list when nodes &lt; nodecnt.

       <b>StartTime</b>=&lt;<u>time_spec</u>&gt;
              The start time for the reservation. A new reservation must specify a start time. It accepts  times
              of  the form <u>HH:MM:SS</u> for a specific time of day (seconds are optional).  (If that time is already
              past, the next day is assumed.)  You may also specify <u>midnight</u>, <u>noon</u>, <u>elevenses</u> (11 AM),  <u>fika</u>  (3
              PM)  or  <u>teatime</u>  (4  PM) and you can have a time-of-day suffixed with <u>AM</u> or <u>PM</u> for running in the
              morning or the evening.  You can also say what day the job will be run, by specifying  a  date  of
              the  form  <u>MMDDYY</u>  or <u>MM/DD/YY</u> or <u>MM.DD.YY</u>, or a date and time as <u>YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]</u>. You can
              also give times like <u>now</u> <u>+</u> <u>count</u> <u>time-units</u>,  where  the  time-units  can  be  <u>seconds</u>  (default),
              <u>minutes</u>,  <u>hours</u>, <u>days</u>, or <u>weeks</u> and you can tell Slurm to run the job today with the keyword <u>today</u>
              and to run the job tomorrow with the keyword <u>tomorrow</u>.  You  cannot  update  the  <u>StartTime</u>  of  a
              reservation in <u>ACTIVE</u> state.

       <b>EndTime</b>=&lt;<u>time_spec</u>&gt;
              The  end time for the reservation. A new reservation must specify an end time or a duration. Valid
              formats are the same as for StartTime.

       <b>Duration</b>=&lt;<u>time</u>&gt;
              The length of a reservation. A new reservation must specify an  end  time  or  a  duration.  Valid
              formats  are  minutes,  minutes:seconds,  hours:minutes:seconds,  days-hours,  days-hours:minutes,
              days-hours:minutes:seconds, or UNLIMITED. Time resolution is one  minute  and  second  values  are
              rounded up to the next minute. Output format is always [days-]hours:minutes:seconds.

       <b>PartitionName</b>=&lt;<u>name</u>&gt;
              Partition  used  to  reserve  nodes from. This will attempt to allocate all nodes in the specified
              partition unless you request fewer resources than are available with <u>CoreCnt</u>, <u>NodeCnt</u> or <u>TRES</u>.  If
              no  partition  is  specified  at  submit  time,  this  partition  will  override the job's default
              partition. Jobs explicitly requesting a different partition will still  be  allowed  to  use  this
              reservation  as long as there are enough overlapping nodes between both partitions to allocate the
              job.

       <b>Flags</b>=&lt;<u>flags</u>&gt;
              Flags associated with the reservation.  You can add or remove individual flags  from  an  existing
              reservation by adding a '+' or '-' sign before the '=' sign. For example: Flags-=DAILY (<b>NOTE</b>: This
              shortcut is not supported for all flags).  Currently supported flags include:

              <b>ANY_NODES</b>     This  is a reservation for burst buffers and/or licenses only and not compute nodes.
                            If this flag is set, a job using this  reservation  may  use  the  associated  burst
                            buffers  and/or  licenses  plus  any  compute nodes.  If this flag is not set, a job
                            using this reservation may use only the  nodes  and  licenses  associated  with  the
                            reservation.

              <b>DAILY</b>         Repeat the reservation at the same time every day.

              <b>FLEX</b>          Permit  jobs  requesting  the  reservation to begin prior to the reservation's start
                            time, end after the reservation's end time, and  use  any  resources  inside  and/or
                            outside  of  the  reservation  regardless  of  any  constraints  possibly set in the
                            reservation. A typical use case is to prevent jobs  not  explicitly  requesting  the
                            reservation  from using those reserved resources rather than forcing jobs requesting
                            the reservation to use those resources in the time frame reserved. Another use  case
                            could  be  to  always  have  a  particular  number  of nodes with a specific feature
                            reserved for a specific account so users in this account may  use  this  nodes  plus
                            possibly other nodes without this feature.

              <b>IGNORE_JOBS</b>   Ignore currently running jobs when creating the reservation.  This can be especially
                            useful when reserving all nodes in the system for maintenance.

              <b>HOURLY</b>        Repeat the reservation at the same time every hour.

              <b>LICENSE_ONLY</b>  See <u>ANY_NODES</u>.

              <b>MAINT</b>         Maintenance  mode,  receives  special  accounting  treatment.   This  reservation is
                            permitted to use resources that are already in another reservation. The  MAINT  flag
                            behaves  similar  to STATIC_ALLOC (see below) in that it will not replace nodes once
                            they are set.

              <b>MAGNETIC</b>      This flag allows jobs to be considered for this  reservation  even  if  they  didn't
                            request it.

              <b>NO_HOLD_JOBS_AFTER</b>
                            By default, when a reservation ends the reservation request will be removed from any
                            pending  jobs  submitted  to the reservation and will be put into a held state.  Use
                            this flag to let jobs run outside of the reservation after the reservation is  gone.
                            Flag removal with '-=' is not supported.

              <b>OVERLAP</b>       This reservation can be allocated resources that are already in another reservation.
                            Flag removal with '-=' is not supported.

              <b>PART_NODES</b>    This  flag  can  be  used  to  reserve  all  nodes  within  the specified partition.
                            PartitionName and Nodes=ALL must be specified with this flag.

              <b>PURGE_COMP</b>[=&lt;<u>timespec</u>&gt;]
                            Purge the reservation if it is ever idle for timespec (no jobs associated with  it).
                            If  timespec  isn't given then 5 minutes is the default.  Valid timespec formats are
                            minutes,  minutes:seconds,  hours:minutes:seconds,  days-hours,  days-hours:minutes,
                            days-hours:minutes:seconds.  Time  resolution  is  one  minute and second values are
                            rounded up to the next minute. Output format is always [days-]hours:minutes:seconds.

              <b>REPLACE</b>       Nodes which are DOWN, DRAINED, or allocated to jobs  are  automatically  replenished
                            using idle resources.  This option can be used to maintain a constant number of idle
                            resources  available  for  pending jobs (subject to availability of idle resources).
                            This should be used with the <u>NodeCnt</u> reservation option; do  not  identify  specific
                            nodes to be included in the reservation. Flag removal with '-=' is not supported.

                            <b>NOTE</b>:  Removing a node from the cluster while in a reservation with the <u>REPLACE</u> flag
                            will not cause it to be replaced.

              <b>REPLACE_DOWN</b>  Nodes which are DOWN or DRAINED are automatically replenished using idle  resources.
                            This  is the default behavior.  This option can be used to maintain a constant sized
                            pool of resources available for  pending  jobs  (subject  to  availability  of  idle
                            resources).   This  should  be  used  with  the  <u>NodeCnt</u>  reservation option; do not
                            identify specific nodes to be included in the reservation. Flag removal with '-=' is
                            not supported.

                            <b>NOTE</b>: Removing a node from the cluster while in a reservation with the  <u>REPLACE_DOWN</u>
                            flag will not cause it to be replaced.

              <b>SPEC_NODES</b>    Reservation is for specific nodes (output only).

              <b>STATIC_ALLOC</b>  Make it so after the nodes are selected for a reservation they don't change. Without
                            this  option  when  nodes  are  selected  for  a  reservation  and one goes down the
                            reservation will select a new node to fill the spot.

              <b>TIME_FLOAT</b>    The reservation start time is relative to the current time and moves forward through
                            time (e.g. a StartTime=now+10minutes will always  be  10  minutes  in  the  future).
                            Repeating (e.g. DAILY) floating reservations are not supported. Flag cannot be added
                            to or removed from an existing reservation.

              <b>USER_DELETE</b>   Allow any user able to run in the reservation to delete it.

              <b>WEEKDAY</b>       Repeat  the  reservation  at  the  same  time  on  every  weekday  (Monday, Tuesday,
                            Wednesday, Thursday and Friday).

              <b>WEEKEND</b>       Repeat the reservation at the same time on every weekend day (Saturday and Sunday).

              <b>WEEKLY</b>        Repeat the reservation at the same time every week.

       <b>Features</b>=&lt;<u>features</u>&gt;
              Set the reservation's required node features. Multiple values may be "&amp;" separated if all features
              are required (AND operation) or separated by "|" if any of the specified features are required (OR
              operation).  Parenthesis are also supported for features to be ANDed together with counts of nodes
              having the specified features.  For example "<b>Features=[(knl&amp;a2a&amp;flat)*4&amp;haswell*2]"</b> indicates  the
              advanced reservation should include 4 nodes with ALL of the features "knl", "a2a", and "flat" plus
              2 nodes with the feature "haswell".

              Value may be cleared with blank data value, "Features=".

       <b>Groups</b>=&lt;<u>group</u> <u>list</u>&gt;
              List  of  groups  permitted  to  use  the  reserved  nodes,  for  example "Group=bio,chem".  A new
              reservation must specify Users or Groups and/or Accounts.  If both Users/Groups and  Accounts  are
              specified,  a  job  must  match  both in order to use the reservation.  Unlike users groups do not
              allow denied access to reservations.  You can add or remove individual  groups  from  an  existing
              reservation  by  using  the update command and adding a '+' or '-' sign before the '=' sign.  Root
              and the SlurmUser are given access to all reservations, regardless of the groups set here.   <b>NOTE</b>:
              Groups  and  Users are mutually exclusive in reservations, if you want to switch between the 2 you
              must update the reservation with a  group=''  or  user=''  and  fill  in  the  opposite  with  the
              appropriate setting.

       <b>Skip</b>   Used  on  a reoccurring reservation, skip to the next reservation iteration.  <b>NOTE</b>: Only available
              for update.

       <b>Users</b>=&lt;<u>user</u> <u>list</u>&gt;
              List of users permitted to use the  reserved  nodes,  for  example  "User=jones1,smith2".   A  new
              reservation  must  specify Users or Groups and/or Accounts.  If both Users/Groups and Accounts are
              specified, a job must match both in order to use the reservation.  Users can also be denied access
              to reservations by preceding all of the user names with '-'. Alternately precede  the  equal  sign
              with  '-'.   For  example,  "User=-jones1,-smith2"  or  "User-=jones1,smith2" will permit any user
              except jones1 and smith2 to use the reservation.  You can add or remove individual users  from  an
              existing reservation by using the update command and adding a '+' or '-' sign before the '=' sign.
              If  users  are  denied access to a reservation (user name preceded by a '-'), then all other users
              are implicitly allowed to use the reservation and it is not possible to  also  explicitly  specify
              allowed  users.   Root  and  the SlurmUser are given access to all reservations, regardless of the
              users set here.  <b>NOTE</b>: Groups and Users are mutually exclusive in reservations,  if  you  want  to
              switch  between  the  2 you must update the reservation with a group='' or user='' and fill in the
              opposite with the appropriate setting.

       <b>TRES</b>=&lt;<u>tres_spec</u>&gt;
              Comma-separated list of TRES required for the  reservation.  Current  supported  TRES  types  with
              reservations  are: CPU, GRES, Node, License and BB. CPU and Node follow the same format as CoreCnt
              and NodeCnt parameters respectively.  License names can be followed by an equal '=' and a count:

              License/&lt;name1&gt;=&lt;count1&gt;[,License/&lt;name2&gt;=&lt;count2&gt;,...]

              BurstBuffer can be specified in a similar way as BurstBuffer parameter.  The  only  difference  is
              that colon symbol ':' should be replaced by an equal '=' in order to follow the TRES format.

              Some examples of TRES valid specifications:

              TRES=cpu=5,bb/cray=4,license/iop1=1,license/iop2=3

              TRES=node=5k,license/iop1=2

              TRES=gres/gpu:a100=2

              Please note that CPU, Node, License and BB can override CoreCnt, NodeCnt, Licenses and BurstBuffer
              parameters respectively. Also CPU represents CoreCnt, in a reservation and will be adjusted if you
              have threads per core on your nodes.

              Note  that  a reservation that contains nodes or cores is associated with one partition, and can't
              span resources over multiple partitions.  The only exception from this is when the reservation  is
              created with explicitly requested nodes.

              Note  that  if  GRES  is  requested  those GRES must be TRES listed in AccountingStorageTRES to be
              valid.

       <b>TRESPerNode</b>=&lt;<u>tres_spec</u>&gt;
              Comma-separated list of TRES required per node for the reservation. See <b>TRES</b> above  for  supported
              types.

              TRESPerNode=gres/gpu:a100=2

              Above will allocate 2 gpu:a100 per node as specified in nodecnt.

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       Executing  <b>scontrol</b>  sends  a  remote procedure call to <b>slurmctld</b>. If enough calls from <b>scontrol</b> or other
       Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to the <b>slurmctld</b> daemon come in at  once,  it  can
       result  in  a  degradation  of  performance  of  the  <b>slurmctld</b> daemon, possibly resulting in a denial of
       service.

       Do not run <b>scontrol</b> or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure  calls  to  <b>slurmctld</b>  from
       loops  in  shell  scripts  or other programs. Ensure that programs limit calls to <b>scontrol</b> to the minimum
       necessary for the information you are trying to gather.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Some <b>scontrol</b> options may be set via environment variables. These environment variables, along with their
       corresponding options, are  listed  below.  (Note:  Command  line  options  will  always  override  these

       <b>SLURM_DEBUG_FLAGS</b>   Specify debug flags for scontrol to use. See DebugFlags in the <b><a href="../man5/slurm.conf.5.html">slurm.conf</a></b>(5) man page
                           for a full list of flags. The environment variable takes precedence over the  setting
                           in the slurm.conf.

       <b>SLURM_TIME_FORMAT</b>   Specify  the  format  used  to  report  time stamps. A value of <u>standard</u>, the default
                           value, generates output in the form "year-month-dateThour:minute:second".  A value of
                           <u>relative</u> returns only "hour:minute:second" if the current day.  For  other  dates  in
                           the  current  year  it  prints  the  "hour:minute"  preceded  by "Tomorr" (tomorrow),
                           "Ystday" (yesterday), the name of the day for the coming  week  (e.g.  "Mon",  "Tue",
                           etc.),  otherwise  the date (e.g. "25 Apr").  For other years it returns a date month
                           and year without a time (e.g.  "6 Jun 2012"). All of the time stamps use  a  24  hour
                           format.

                           A valid strftime() format can also be specified. For example, a value of "%a %T" will
                           report the day of the week and a time stamp (e.g. "Mon 12:34:56").

       <b>SLURM_TOPO_LEN</b>      Specify  the maximum size of the line when printing Topology. If not set, the default
                           value is unlimited.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       When using SlurmDBD, users who have an AdminLevel defined (Operator or Admin) and users who  are  account
       coordinators  are  given  the authority to view and modify jobs, reservations, nodes, etc., as defined in
       the following table - regardless of whether a PrivateData restriction has been defined in the  slurm.conf
       file.
