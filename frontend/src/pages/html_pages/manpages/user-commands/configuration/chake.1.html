</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>chake</b> - serverless configuration management tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>chake</b> init

       <b>chake</b> [rake arguments]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       chake is a tool that helps you manage multiple hosts without the need for a central server. Configuration
       is  managed in a local directory, which should (but doesn't need to) be under version control with <b><a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a>(1)</b>
       or any other version control system.

       Configuration is deployed to managed hosts remotely, either by invoking a configuration  management  tool
       that  will connect to them, or by first uploading the necessary configuration and them remotely running a
       tool on the hosts.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>MANAGERS.</b></h4><pre>
       chake supports the following configuration management tools:

       •   <b>itamae</b>: configuration is applied by running the itamae command line tool on the management  host;  no
           configuration needs to be uploaded to the managed hosts. See <a href="../man7/chake-itamae.7.html">chake-itamae</a>(7) for details.

       •   <b>shell</b>:  the  local  repository  is  copied  to the host, and the shell commands specified in the node
           configuration is executed from the directory where that copy is. See <a href="../man7/chake-shell.7.html">chake-shell</a>(7) for details.

       •   <b>chef</b>: the local repository is copied to the host, and <b>chef-solo</b> is executed remotely on  the  managed
           host. See <a href="../man7/chake-chef.7.html">chake-chef</a>(7) for details.

       Beyond applying configuration management recipes on the hosts, chake also provides useful tools to manage
       multiple hosts, such as listing nodes, running commands against all of them simultaneously, logging in to
       interactive shells, and others.

</pre><h4><b>CREATING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>REPOSITORY</b></h4><pre>
       $ chake init[:configmanager]

       This  will  create  an  initial  directory  structure. Some of the files are specific to your your chosen
       <b>configmanager</b>, which can be one of [SUPPORTED CONFIGURATION MANAGERS]. The following files, though,  will
       be common to any usage of chake:

       •   <b>nodes.yaml</b>:  where you will list the hosts you will be managing, and what recipes to apply to each of
           them.

       •   <b>nodes.d</b>: a directory with multiple files in the same format as nodes.yaml. All files matching  <b>*.yaml</b>
           in it will be added to the list of nodes.

       •   <b>Rakefile</b>:  Contains  just  the  <b>require</b> <b>'chake'</b> line. You can augment it with other tasks specific to
           your intrastructure.

       If you omit <u>configmanager</u>, <b>itamae</b> will be used by default.

       After the repository is created, you can call either <b>chake</b> or <b>rake</b>, as they are completely equivalent.

</pre><h4><b>MANAGING</b> <b>NODES</b></h4><pre>
       Just after you created your repository, the contents of <b>nodes.yaml</b> is the following:

           host1.mycompany.com:
             itamae:
               - roles/basic.rb

       The exact contents depends on the chosen configuration management tool.

       You can list your hosts with <b>rake</b> <b>nodes</b>:

           $ rake nodes
           host1.mycompany.com                      ssh

       To add more nodes, just append to <b>nodes.yaml</b>:

           host1.mycompany.com:
             itamae:
               - roles/basic.rb
           host2.mycompany.com:
             itamae:
               - roles/basic.rb

       And chake now knows about your new node:

           $ rake nodes
           host1.mycompany.com                      ssh
           host2.mycompany.com                      ssh

</pre><h4><b>PREPARINGS</b> <b>NODES</b> <b>TO</b> <b>BE</b> <b>MANAGED</b></h4><pre>
       Nodes have very few initial requirements to be managed with <b>chake</b>:

       •   The node must be accessible via SSH.

       •   The user you connect to the node must either be <b>root</b>, or be allowed to run <b>sudo</b> (in which  case  <b>sudo</b>
           must be installed).

       <b>A</b>  <b>note</b>  <b>on</b>  <b>password</b>  <b>prompts:</b> every time chake calls ssh on a node, you may be required to type in your
       password; every time chake calls sudo on the node, you may be require  to  type  in  your  password.  For
       managing  one or two nodes this is probably fine, but for larger numbers of nodes it is not practical. To
       avoid password prompts, you can:

       •   Configure SSH key-based authentication. This is more secure than using passwords. While  you  are  at
           it,  you  also  probably  want  disable  password authentication completely, and only allow key-based
           authentication

       •   Configure passwordless <b>sudo</b> access for the user you use to connect to your nodes.

</pre><h4><b>CHECKING</b> <b>CONNECTIVITY</b> <b>AND</b> <b>INITIAL</b> <b>HOST</b> <b>SETUP</b></h4><pre>
       To check whether hosts are correctly configured, you can use the <b>check</b> task:

           $ rake check

       That will run the the <b>sudo</b> <b>true</b> command on each host. If  that  pass  without  you  having  to  type  any
       passwords, it means that:

       •   you have SSH access to each host; and

       •   the user you are connecting as has password-less sudo correctly setup.

</pre><h4><b>APPLYING</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Note  that  by  default  all tasks that apply to all hosts will run in parallel, using rake's support for
       multitasks. If for some reason you need to prevent that, you can pass  <b>-j1</b>  (or  --jobs=1<b>)</b>  <b>in</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>rake</b>
       <b>invocation.</b> <b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>default</b> <b>rake</b> <b>will</b> <b>only</b> <b>run</b> <b>N+4</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>in</b> <b>parallel,</b> <b>where</b> <b>N</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>cores</b>
       <b>on</b>  <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> <b>it.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>N+4</b> <b>hosts</b> <b>and</b> <b>want</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>handled</b> <b>in</b>
       <b>parallel,</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b>-j<b>(or</b>--jobs`), without any number, as the last argument; with  that  rake
       will have no limit on the number of tasks to perform in parallel.

       To apply the configuration to all nodes, run

           $ rake converge

       To apply the configuration to a single node, run

           $ rake converge:$NODE

       To apply a single recipe on all nodes, run

           $ rake apply[myrecipe]

       What <b>recipe</b> is depends on the configuration manager.

       To apply a single recipe on a specific node, run

           $ rake apply:$NODE[myrecipe]

       If you don't inform a recipe in the command line, you will be prompted for one.

       To run a shell command on all nodes, run

           $ rake run The above will prompt you for a command, then execute it on all nodes.

       To pass the command to run in the command line, use the following syntax:

           $ rake run[command]

       If  the  <b>command</b>  you want to run contains spaces, or other characters that are special do the shell, you
       have to quote them, for example:

           $ rake run["cat <a href="file:/etc/hostname">/etc/hostname</a>"]

       To run a shell command on a specific node, run

           $ rake run:$NODE[command]

       As before, if you run just <b>rake</b> <b>run:$NODE</b>, you will be prompted for the command.

       To list all existing tasks, run:

           $ rake -T

</pre><h4><b>WRITING</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>MANAGEMENT</b> <b>CODE</b></h4><pre>
       As chake supports different configuration management tools, the  specifics  of  configuration  management
       code depends on the the tool you choose. See the corresponding documentation.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>NODE</b> <b>BOOTSTRAPPING</b> <b>PROCESS</b></h4><pre>
       Some  of  the  configuration management tools require some software to be installed on the managed hosts.
       When that's the case, chake acts on a node for the first time, it has to bootstrap it. The  bootstrapping
       process includes doing the following:

       •   installing and configuring the needed software

       •   setting up the hostname

</pre><h4><b>NODE</b> <b>URLS</b></h4><pre>
       The  keys  in the hash that is represented in <b>nodes.yaml</b> is a node URL. All components of the URL but the
       hostname are optional, so just listing hostnames is the simplest form of specifying your nodes. Here  are
       all the components of the node URLs:

           [connection://][username@]hostname[:port][/path]

       •   <b>connection</b>: what to use to connect to the host. <b>ssh</b> or <b>local</b> (default: <b>ssh</b>)

       •   <b>username</b>: user name to connect with (default: the username on your local workstation)

       •   <b>hostname</b>: the hostname to connect to (default: <u>none</u>)

       •   <b>port</b>: port number to connect to (default: 22)

       •   <b>/path</b>: where to store the cookbooks at the node (default: <b>/var/tmp/chef.$USERNAME</b>)

</pre><h4><b>EXTRA</b> <b>FEATURES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>HOOKS</b>
       You  can  define  rake  tasks  that  will  be  executed  before  bootstrapping  nodes,  before  uploading
       configuration management content to nodes, and before converging. To do this, you just  need  to  enhance
       the corresponding tasks:

       •   <b>bootstrap_common</b>: executed before bootstrapping nodes (even if nodes have already been bootstrapped)

       •   <b>upload_common</b>: executed before uploading content to the node

       •   <b>converge_common</b>: executed before converging (i.e. running chef)

       •   <b>connect_common</b>:  executed before doing any action that connects to any of the hosts. This can be used
           for example to generate a ssh configuration file based on the contents of the nodes definition files.

       •   <b>connect:HOSTNAME</b>: executed before doing any action that connects to <b>HOSTNAME</b>.

       Example:

           task :bootstrap_common do
             sh './scripts/pre-bootstrap-checks'
           end

   <b>ENCRYPTED</b> <b>FILES</b>
       <b>chake</b> supports encrypted files matching either <b>\*.gpg</b>  or  <b>\*.asc</b>.  There  are  two  ways  of  specicying
       per-host encrypted files:

       1.  listing them in the <b>encrypted</b> attribute in the node configuration file. Example:

           host1.mycompany.com:
             itamae:
               - roles/basic.rb
             encrypted:
               - foo.txt.asc

       2.  (deprecated)     any     files     matching     <b>\*\*/files/{default,host-#{node}}/\*.{asc,gpg}</b>    and
           <b>\*\*/files/\*.{asc,gpg}</b>, <b>if</b> <b>encrypted</b> is not defined in the node configuration.

       They will be decrypted with GnuPG before being sent to the node (for the configuration  management  tools
       that  required  files  to  be  sent),  without  the <b>\*.asc</b> or <b>\*.gpg</b> extension. You can use them to store
       passwords and other sensitive information (SSL keys, etc) in the repository together with the rest of the
       configuration.

       For configuration managers that don't require uploading files to the managed node, this  decryption  will
       happen  right  before  converging or applying single recipes, and the decrypted files will be wiped right
       after that.

       If you use this feature, make sure that you have the <b>wipe</b> program installed. This way chake will be  able
       to delete the decrypted files in a slightly more secure way, after being done with them.

   <b>REPOSITORY-LOCAL</b> <b>SSH</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       If  you  need special SSH configuration parameters, you can create a file called <b>.ssh_config</b> (or whatever
       file name you have in the <b>$CHAKE_SSH_CONFIG</b> environment variable, see below for details) in at  the  root
       of your repository, and chake will use it when calling <b>ssh</b>.

   <b>LOGGING</b> <b>IN</b> <b>TO</b> <b>A</b> <b>HOST</b>
       To  easily  login  to  one  of  your host, just run <b>rake</b> <b>login:$HOSTNAME</b>. This will automatically use the
       repository-local SSH configuration as above so you don't have to type <b>-F</b> <b>.ssh_config</b> all the time.

   <b>RUNNING</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>SSH</b> <b>INVOCATIONS</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>SOME</b> <b>PREFIX</b> <b>COMMAND</b>
       Some times, you will also want or need to prefix your SSH invocations with some prefix command  in  order
       to  e.g.  tunnel  it through some central exit node. You can do this by setting <b>$CHAKE_SSH_PREFIX</b> on your
       environment. Example:

           CHAKE_SSH_PREFIX=tsocks rake converge

       The above will make all SSH invocations to all hosts be called as <b>tsocks</b> <b>ssh</b> <b>[...]</b>

   <b>CONVERGING</b> <b>LOCAL</b> <b>HOST</b>
       If you want to manage your local workstation with chake, you can declare a local node using  the  "local"
       connection type, like this (in <b>nodes.yaml</b>):

           local://thunderbolt:
             itamae:
               - role/workstation.rb

       To  apply the configuration to the local host, you can use the conventional <b>rake</b> <b>converge:thunderbolt</b>, or
       the special target <b>rake</b> <b>local</b>.

       When converging all nodes, <b>chake</b> will skip nodes that are declared with the <b>local://</b> connection and whose
       hostname does not match the hostname in the declaration. For example:

           local://desktop:
             itamae:
               - role/workstation.rb
           local://laptop:
             itamae:
               - role/workstation.rb

       When you run <b>rake</b> <b>converge</b> on <b>desktop</b>, <b>laptop</b> will be skipped, and vice-versa.

   <b>ACCESSING</b> <b>NODE</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>FROM</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>OWN</b> <b>TASKS</b>
       It's often useful to be able to run arbitrary commands against the data you have about nodes. You can use
       the <b>Chake.nodes</b> for that. For example, if you want to geolocate each of yours hosts:

           task :geolocate do
             Chake.nodes.each do |node|
               puts "#{node.hostname}: %s" % `geoiplookup #{node.hostname}`.strip
             end
           end

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$CHAKE_SSH_CONFIG</b>
              Local SSH configuration file. Defaults to <b>.ssh_config</b>.

       <b>$CHAKE_SSH_PREFIX</b>
              Command to prefix SSH (and rsync over SSH) calls with.

       <b>$CHAKE_RSYNC_OPTIONS</b>
              extra options to pass to <b>rsync</b>. Useful to e.g. exclude large  files  from  being  upload  to  each
              server.

       <b>$CHAKE_NODES</b>
              File containing the list of servers to be managed. Default: <b>nodes.yaml</b>.

       <b>$CHAKE_NODES_D</b>
              Directory containing node definition files servers to be managed. Default: <b>nodes.d</b>.

       <b>$CHAKE_TMPDIR</b>
              Directory used to store temporary cache files. Default: <b>tmp/chake</b>.

       <b>$CHAKE_CHEF_CONFIG</b>
              Chef configuration file, relative to the root of the repository. Default: <b>config.rb</b>.
