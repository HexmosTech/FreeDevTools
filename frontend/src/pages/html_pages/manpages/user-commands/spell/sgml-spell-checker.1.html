</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sgml-spell-checker - SGML spell checker

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nsgmls</b> <b>-l</b> <u>yourdoc.sgml</u> <b>|</b> <b>sgml-spell-checker</b> [<u>option</u>] ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sgml-spell-checker</b>  is  a tool that you can use to automatically spell-check your SGML documents.  One of
       the advantages of this tool over some other SGML-aware spell checkers is that it scans your documents  in
       the form in which the SGML parser actually sees it, which means it is not line-based, system entities are
       resolved, marked sections are treated appropriately, etc.

       Also,  this  tool can be made aware of particular DTDs, in the sense that it knows not to spell-check the
       content of elements that do not represent human-language text, such as &lt;programlisting&gt; in  DocBook.   An
       exclusion list for the DocBook DTD is included, others can be added trivially.

       The  input  to  <b>sgml-spell-checker</b>  is  the text representation of your SGML document's Element Structure
       Information Set as generated by <b>nsgmls</b> (from SP or OpenSP; sometimes installed under the  name  <b>onsgmls</b>).
       In  other  words, you need to pipe the output of <b>nsgmls</b> into <b>sgml-spell-checker</b> as shown in the synopsis.
       Provide to <b>nsgmls</b> the options you need, such as <b>-c</b> to search  more  catalogs,  <b>-i</b>  to  include  a  marked
       section, or more source files.  Do not forget the <b>-l</b> option, or you won't get any file or line references
       for the misspellings.

       The  second  part  of  the  pipe  takes a couple of options; see below.  Note that if the language of the
       document does not match your system's locale settings, you need to use the <b>--language</b> option.

       The output of <b>sgml-spell-checker</b> is a list of the words that are misspelled (in the opinion  of  <b>aspell</b>),
       together  with  file  name  and line number.  Note that the line number designates where the element that
       contains the word started, not where the word actually is.  So most likely you will have to search a  few
       lines below the indicated location.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--debug</b>
              Debug mode.  Generates lots of output not of interest to the normal user.

       <b>--language=</b><u>language</u>
              Sets  the language of the document.  (The format depends on the <b>aspell</b> installation, but something
              like <b>en</b> or <b>en_US</b> should work.)  By default the language is taken from the system locale settings.

       <b>--suggestions</b>
              Shows correction suggestions for misspelled words.

       <b>--dictionary=</b><u>file</u>
              Uses an additional <b>aspell</b> dictionary file.  This option may be used multiple times.

       <b>--dtd=</b><u>dtd</u>
              Uses the exclusion list for the specified DTD (e.g., <b>docbook</b>).

       <b>--help</b> Shows a brief help, then exits.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       nsgmls -l -D . mydoc.sgml | \
       sgml-spell-checker --language=en --dtd=docbook \
          --dictionary=mydict1.aspell --dictionary=mydict2.aspell

       (You can enter this command all on one line without  the  backslashes,  or  on  several  lines  with  the
       backslashes.)

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Read  the  <b>aspell</b>  documentation about how to set up the appropriate dictionaries.  In case you're having
       trouble interpreting the <b>aspell</b> documentation, here's how to make an <b>aspell</b> dictionary file from  a  flat
       word list:

       rm -f mydict1.aspell    # aspell won't overwrite existing files
       aspell --language-tag=xx create master ./mydict1.aspell &lt; mywordlist.txt

       Watch the slashes.  <b>aspell</b> likes to see a slash in the name or it will search some default location.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  should  be  able  to identify the language from the document (e.g., &lt;book lang="de"&gt;), but
       <b>aspell</b> doesn't handle changing the language on the fly.
