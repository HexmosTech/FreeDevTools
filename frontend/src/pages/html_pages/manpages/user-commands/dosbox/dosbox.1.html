</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page briefly documents <b>dosbox</b>, an x86/DOS emulator.

       The  optional  <b>file</b>  argument  should be a DOS executable or a directory. If it is a dos executable (.com
       .exe .bat) the program will run automatically. If it is a directory, a DOS  session  will  run  with  the
       directory mounted as C:\.

       For an introduction type <u>INTRO</u> inside <b>dosbox</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A summary of options is included below.

       <b>-fullscreen</b>
              Start <b>dosbox</b> in fullscreen mode.

       <b>-startmapper</b>
              Start the internal keymapper on startup of <b>dosbox</b>. You can use it to change the keys <b>dosbox</b> uses.

       <b>-noautoexec</b>
              Skips the [autoexec] section of the loaded configuration file.

       <b>-securemode</b>
              Same  as  <b>-noautoexec</b>,  but adds <b>config.com</b>  <b>-securemode</b> at the end of <u>AUTOEXEC.BAT</u> (which in turn
              disables any changes to how the drives are mounted inside <b>dosbox</b>)

       <b>-userconf</b>
              Load the configuration file located in <a href="file:~/.dosbox.">~/.dosbox.</a> Can be combined with the <b>-conf</b> option.

       <b>-scaler</b> <u>scaler</u>
              Uses the graphical scaler specified by <u>scaler</u>.  See  the  configuration  file  for  the  available
              scalers

       <b>-forcescaler</b> <u>scaler</u>
              Similar  to  the  <b>-scaler</b>  parameter,  but tries to force usage of the specified scaler even if it
              might not fit.

       <b>-c</b> <u>command</u>
              Runs the specified <u>command</u> before running <b>file</b>.  Multiple commands can be specified. Each  <u>command</u>
              should start with <b>-c</b> though. A command can be: an Internal Program, a DOS command or an executable
              on a mounted drive.

       <b>-conf</b> <u>configfile</u>
              Start  <b>dosbox</b>  with  the options specified in <u>configfile</u>. This file has a section in which you can
              put commands you wish  to  execute  on  startup.  Multiple  <u>configfiles</u>  can  be  present  at  the
              commandline.

       <b>-lang</b> <u>langfile</u>
              Start <b>dosbox</b> with the language specified in <u>langfile</u>.

       <b>-exit</b>  <b>dosbox</b> will close itself when the DOS program specified by <b>file</b> ends.

       <b>-machine</b> <u>machinetype</u>
              Setup  <b>dosbox</b>  to  emulate  a  specific type of machine.  Valid choices are: <u>hercules,</u> <u>cga,</u> <u>tandy,</u>
              <u>pcjr,</u>  <u>ega,</u>  <u>vgaonly,</u>  <u>svga_s3(default),</u>  <u>svga_et3000,</u>  <u>svga_et4000,</u>  <u>svga_paradise,</u>   <u>vesa_nolfb,</u>
              <u>vesa_oldvbe</u>.  The machinetype has influence on both the videocard and the available soundcards.

       <b>-version</b>
              Output version information and exit. Useful for frontends.

       <b>-editconf</b> <u>program</u>
              calls  <u>program</u>  with as first parameter the configuration file.  You can specify this command more
              than once. In this case it will  move to second <u>program</u> if the first one fails to start.

       <b>-opencaptures</b> <u>program</u>
              calls <u>program</u> with as  first parameter the location of the captures folder.

       <b>-printconf</b>
              prints the location of the default configuration file.

       <b>-eraseconf,</b> <b>-resetconf</b>
              removes the default configuration file.

       <b>-erasemapper,</b> <b>-resetmapper</b>
              removes the mapperfile configured in the clean default configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>INTERNAL</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dosbox</b> supports most of the DOS commands found in command.com. In addition, the following extra  commands
       are available:

       <b>MOUNT</b>  <b>[-t</b>  <u>type</u><b>]</b>  <b>[-size</b>  <u>size</u><b>]</b> <u>driveletter</u> <u>sourcedirectory</u> <b>[-ioctl]</b> <b>[-usecd</b> <u>number</u><b>]</b> <b>[-label</b> <u>drivelabel</u><b>]</b>
              <b>[-freesize</b> <u>freesize</u><b>]</b>

       <b>MOUNT</b> <b>-cd</b>

       <b>MOUNT</b> <b>-u</b> <b>driveletter</b>

       Program to mount local directories as drives inside <b>dosbox</b>.

              <u>driveletter</u>
                     The driveletter inside dosbox (eg. C).

              <u>sourcedirectory</u>
                     The local directory you want to have inside dosbox.

              <b>-t</b> <u>type</u>
                     Type of the mounted directory. Supported are: dir (standard), floppy, cdrom.

              <b>-size</b> <u>drivesize</u>
                     Sets the size of the drive. See the examples in the README for details.

              <b>-freesize</b> <u>size_in_mb</u>
                     Sets the amount of free space available on a drive in MB's. This is a more  simple  version
                     of <b>-size</b>.

              <b>-label</b> <u>drivelabel</u>
                     Sets the name of the drive to <u>drivelabel</u>. Needed on some systems if the cd label isn't read
                     correctly.  Useful when a program can't find its cdrom. If you don't specify a label and no
                     lowlevel support is selected (<b>-usecd</b> <b>#</b> and/or <b>-ioctl/aspi</b>):

                     For win32: label is extracted from "Real Drive".

                     For Linux: label is set to NO_LABEL.

                     If you do specify a label this label will be kept as long as the drive
                            is mounted. It will not be updated !!

              <b>-ioctl</b> Forces to use ioctl commands.

              <b>-usecd</b> <u>number</u>
                     Forces to use SDL cdrom support for drive number.  <u>Number</u> can be found by <b>-cd</b>.

              <b>-cd</b>    Displays all detected cdrom drives and their numbers. Use with <b>-usecd</b>.

              <b>-u</b>     Unmounts a mounted drive. Doesn't work on virtual Drives (like Z:\)

       <b>Example:</b>

       To mount your /home/dos/dosgames directory as C drive in <b>dosbox</b>:
              mount c /home/dos/dosgames

       <b>MEM</b>

       Display the amount of free memory

       <b>CONFIG</b> <b>[-writeconf]</b> <b>[-writelang]</b> <b>file</b>

       <b>CONFIG</b> <b>-securemode</b>

       Write the current configuration or language settings to <b>file</b>, which is located on the  local  filesystem.
       Not a mounted drive in <b>dosbox</b>.

              <b>-securemode</b>
                     Switches<b>dosbox</b>  to  a  more secure mode. In this mode the internal commands <u>MOUNT</u>, <u>IMGMOUNT</u>
                     and <u>BOOT</u> won't work.  It's not possible either to create a new configfile  or  languagefile
                     in this mode.  (Warning you can only undo this mode by restarting <b>dosbox</b>.)

       The  configuration  file controls various settings of <b>dosbox</b>: The amount of emulated memory, the emulated
       soundcards and many more things. It further allows access to <u>AUTOEXEC.BAT</u>.

       The language file controls all visible output of the internal commands and the  internal  dos.   See  the
       section <b>FILES</b> for more information.

       <b>LOADFIX</b> <b>[-size]</b> <b>[programname]</b> <b>[parameters]</b>

       <b>LOADFIX</b> <b>-f</b>

       Program to reduce the amount of  memory available. Useful for old programs which don't expect much memory
       to be free.

              <b>[programname]</b>
                     The name of the program which is executed after loadfix eats up its memory.

              <b>[parameters]</b>
                     Parameters given to the <b>programname</b> executable.

              <b>-size</b>  The amount of memory to eat up (in kb). Example -32, -64 or -128

              <b>-f</b>     Frees all memory eaten up by loadfix.

       <b>RESCAN</b>

       Make  <b>dosbox</b>  reread  the directory structure. Useful if you changed something on a mounted drive outside
       <b>dosbox</b>.(CTRL-F4 does this as well!)

       <b>IMGMOUNT</b>

       A utility to mount disk images and CD‐ROM images in <b>dosbox</b>.

       Read the <b>README</b> of <b>dosbox</b> for the full and correct syntax.

       <b>BOOT</b>

       Boot will start floppy images or hard disk images independent of the operating system  emulation  offered
       by <b>dosbox</b>.  This will allow you to play booter floppies or boot to other operating systems inside <b>dosbox</b>.

       Read the <b>README</b> of <b>dosbox</b> for the full and correct syntax.

       <b>IPX</b>

       You  need  to  enable  IPX  networking in the configuration file of <b>dosbox</b>.  All of the IPX networking is
       managed through the internal <b>dosbox</b> program <b>IPXNET</b>. For help on the IPX networking  from  inside  <b>dosbox</b>,
       type <b>IPXNET</b> <b>HELP</b> and the program will list out the commands and relevant documentation.

       Read the <b>README</b> of <b>dosbox</b> for the full and correct syntax.

       <b>KEYB</b>

       Keyb can change the keyboardlayout and the codepage used inside dosbox.

       Read the <b>README</b> of <b>dosbox</b> for the full and correct syntax.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration  and  language  files  use  a  format  similar  to Windows .ini files.  If no configfile is
       specified at the commandline, a file named <b>dosbox.conf</b> (if present in  the  current  directory)  will  be
       loaded  automatically.  If a configfile is specified at the commandline that one will be used instead. If
       no configfile is specified or found in the current directory  then dosbox will load one from  <b><a href="file:~/.dosbox/">~/.dosbox/</a></b>.
       It will try to create one if there is none.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       ALT-ENTER   Go full screen and back.

       ALT-PAUSE   Pause emulation.

       CTRL-F1     Start the keymapper.

       CTRL-ALT-F5 Start/Stop creating a movie of the screen.

       CTRL-F4     Swap mounted disk‐image (Only used with imgmount). Update directory cache for all drives!

       CTRL-F5     Save a screenshot.(png)

       CTRL-F6     Start/Stop recording sound output to a wave file.

       CTRL-ALT-F7 Start/Stop recording of OPL commands.

       CTRL-ALT-F8 Start/Stop the recording of raw MIDI commands.

       CTRL-F7     Decrease frameskip.

       CTRL-F8     Increase frameskip.

       CTRL-F9     Kill dosbox.

       CTRL-F10    Capture/Release the mouse.

       CTRL-F11    Slow down emulation (Increase dosbox Cycles).

       CTRL-F12    Speed up emulation (Decrease dosbox Cycles).

       ALT-F12     Unlock speed (turbo button).

       These are the default keybindings. They can be changed in the keymapper.

       Saved/recorded  files  can be found in current_directory/capture (can be changed in the configfile).  The
       directory has to exist prior to starting <b>dosbox</b> else nothing gets saved/recorded !

       <b>Note:</b> Once you increase your <b>dosbox</b> cycles beyond your computer's maximum capacity, it will  produce  the
       same effect as slowing down the emulation.  This maximum will vary from computer to computer, there is no
       standard.

</pre><h4><b>SYSTEM</b> <b>REQUIREMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Fast  machine.  My  guess  would  be  Pentium-2  400+ to get decent emulation of games written for an 286
       machine.  For protected mode games a 1 Ghz machine is recommended and  don't  expect  them  to  run  fast
       though!! Be sure to read the next section on how to speed it up somewhat.

   <b>To</b> <b>run</b> <b>resource-demanding</b> <b>games</b>
       <b>dosbox</b>  emulates  the  CPU, the sound and graphic cards, and some other  stuff, all at the same time. You
       can overclock <b>dosbox</b> by using CTRL-F12, but you'll be limited by the power of your actual  CPU.  You  can
       see how much free time your true CPU has by various utils (top).  Once 100% of your real CPU time is used
       there  is  no further way to speed up <b>dosbox</b> unless you reduce the load generated by the non-CPU parts of
       <b>dosbox</b>.

       So:

       Close every program but <b>dosbox</b>.

       Overclock  <b>dosbox</b> until 100% of your CPU is used.(CTRL-F12)

       Since VGA emulation is the most demanding part of <b>dosbox</b> in terms of actual CPU usage, we'll start  here.
       Increase  the  number of frames skipped (in increments of one) by pressing CTRL-F8. Your CPU usage should
       decrease.  Go back one step and repeat this until the game runs fast enough for you.   Please  note  that
       this is a trade off: you lose in fluidity of video what you gain in speed.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       While  we  hope that, one day, <b>dosbox</b> will run virtually all programs ever made for the PC...  we are not
       there yet. At present, <b>dosbox</b> run on a 1.7 Gigahertz PC is roughly the equivalent  of  a  25MHz  386  PC.
       While  the  0.60  release  has  added  support  for "protected mode" allowing for more complex and recent
       programs, but note that this support is early in development and nowhere near as complete as the  support
       for  386  real-mode  games  (or  earlier).  Also note that "protected mode" games need substantially more
       resources and may require a much faster processor for you to run it properly in <b>dosbox</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Not all DOS programs work properly.  <b>dosbox</b> will exit without warning if an error occurred.
