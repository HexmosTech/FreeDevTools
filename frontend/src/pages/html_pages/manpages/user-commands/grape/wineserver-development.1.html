</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wineserver - the Wine server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wineserver</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wineserver</b>  is  a  daemon process that provides to Wine roughly the same services that the Windows kernel
       provides on Windows.

       <b>wineserver</b> is normally launched automatically when starting <b><a href="../man1/wine.1.html">wine</a></b>(1), so you shouldn't have to worry about
       it. In some cases however, it can be useful to start <b>wineserver</b> explicitly  with  different  options,  as
       explained below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b>[<u>n</u>], <b>--debug</b>[<b>=</b><u>n</u>]
              Set  the  debug level to <u>n</u>.  0 means no debugging information, 1 is the normal level, and 2 is for
              extra verbose debugging. If <u>n</u> is not specified, the default is 1. The debug output will be sent to
              stderr. <b><a href="../man1/wine.1.html">wine</a></b>(1) will automatically enable normal level debugging when starting <b>wineserver</b>  if  the
              +server option is set in the <b>WINEDEBUG</b> variable.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--foreground</b>
              Make  the server remain in the foreground for easier debugging, for instance when running it under
              a debugger.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Display a help message.

       <b>-k</b>[<u>n</u>], <b>--kill</b>[<b>=</b><u>n</u>]
              Kill the currently running <b>wineserver</b>, optionally by sending signal <u>n</u>. If no signal is  specified,
              sends  a  <b>SIGINT</b>  first and then a <b>SIGKILL</b>.  The instance of <b>wineserver</b> that is killed is selected
              based on the <b>WINEPREFIX</b> environment variable.

       <b>-p</b>[<u>n</u>], <b>--persistent</b>[<b>=</b><u>n</u>]
              Specify the <b>wineserver</b> persistence delay, i.e. the amount  of  time  that  the  server  will  keep
              running  when  all  client  processes  have  terminated. This avoids the cost of shutting down and
              starting again when programs are launched in quick succession. The timeout <u>n</u> is  in  seconds,  the
              default value is 0 seconds. If <u>n</u> is not specified, the server stays around forever.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display version information and exit.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--wait</b>
              Wait until the currently running <b>wineserver</b> terminates.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>WINEPREFIX</b>
              If set, the content of this variable is taken as the name of the directory where <b>wineserver</b> stores
              its  data  (the  default is <u>$HOME/.wine</u>). All <b>wine</b> processes using the same <b>wineserver</b> (i.e.: same
              user) share certain things like registry, shared memory and kernel objects.  By setting <b>WINEPREFIX</b>
              to different values for different Wine processes,  it  is  possible  to  run  a  number  of  truly
              independent Wine sessions.

       <b>WINESERVER</b>
              Specifies  the path and name of the <b>wineserver</b> binary that will be launched automatically by <b>wine</b>.
              If not set, <b>wine</b> will try to load <u>/usr/lib/wine-development/wineserver</u>, and if this doesn't  exist
              it will then look for a file named <u>wineserver</u> in the path and in a few other likely locations.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="file:~/.wine">~/.wine</a></b>
              Directory containing user specific data managed by <b>wine</b>.

       <b>/tmp/.wine-</b><u>uid</u>
              Directory  containing  the  server  Unix  socket  and  the lock file. These files are created in a
              subdirectory generated from the <b>WINEPREFIX</b> directory device and inode numbers.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The original author of <b>wineserver</b> is Alexandre Julliard. Many other people have contributed new  features
       and bug fixes. For a complete list, see the git commit logs.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Bugs can be reported on the <b>Wine</b> <b>bug</b> <b>tracker</b>.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wineserver</b>  is  part  of  the  Wine distribution, which is available through WineHQ, the <b>Wine</b> <b>development</b>
       <b>headquarters</b>.
