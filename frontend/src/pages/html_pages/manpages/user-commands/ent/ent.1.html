       ent - pseudorandom number sequence test

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>ent</u> [options] [file]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       ENT Logo

       <u>ent</u>  performs  a  variety  of  tests  on  the  stream  of  bytes in <u>file</u> (or standard input if no <u>file</u> is
       specified) and produces output on standard output; for example:

       Entropy = 7.980627 bits per character.

       Optimum compression would reduce the size
       of this 51768 character file by 0 percent.

       Chi square distribution for 51768 samples is 1542.26, and randomly
       would exceed this value 0.01 percent of the times.

       Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 125.93 (127.5 = random).
       Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.169834647 (error 0.90 percent).
       Serial correlation coefficient is 0.004249 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).

       The values calculated are as follows:

   <b>ENTROPY</b>
       The information density of the contents of the file, expressed as a number of  bits  per  character.  The
       results  above, which resulted from processing an image file compressed with JPEG, indicate that the file
       is extremely dense in information—essentially random. Hence, compression  of  the  file  is  unlikely  to
       reduce  its  size.  By  contrast,  the  C  source  code  of the program has entropy of about 4.9 bits per
       character, indicating that optimal compression of the file would reduce its size by  38%.  [Hamming,  pp.
       104-108]

   <b>CHI-SQUARE</b> <b>TEST</b>
       The chi-square test is the most commonly used test for the randomness of data, and is extremely sensitive
       to  errors  in pseudorandom sequence generators. The chi-square distribution is calculated for the stream
       of bytes in the file and expressed as an absolute number and a percentage which indicates how  frequently
       a  truly  random sequence would exceed the value calculated. We interpret the percentage as the degree to
       which the sequence tested is suspected of being non-random. If the percentage is greater than 99% or less
       than 1%, the sequence is almost certainly not random. If the percentage is between 99% and 95% or between
       1% and 5%, the sequence is suspect.  Percentages between 90% and 95% and 5% and 10% indicate the sequence
       is "almost suspect". Note that our JPEG file, while very dense in information,  is  far  from  random  as
       revealed by the chi-square test.

       Applying  this  test  to  the output of various pseudorandom sequence generators is interesting. The low-
       order 8 bits returned by the standard Unix <a href="../man1/rand.1.html">rand</a>(1) function, for example, yields:

       Chi square distribution for 500000 samples is 0.01, and randomly
       would exceed this value 99.99 percent of the times.

       While an improved generator [Park &amp; Miller] reports:

       Chi square distribution for 500000 samples is 212.53, and randomly
       would exceed this value 95.00 percent of the times.

       Thus, the standard Unix generator (or at least the low-order  bytes  it  returns)  is  unacceptably  non-
       random,  while  the  improved generator is much better but still sufficiently non-random to cause concern
       for demanding applications.  Contrast both of these software generators with the chi-square result  of  a
       genuine random sequence created by timing radioactive decay events[1]:

       Chi square distribution for 32768 samples is 237.05, and randomly
       would exceed this value 75.00 percent of the times.

       See  [Knuth,  pp.  35-40]  for  more  information  on  the  chi-square  test.  An  interactive chi-square
       calculator[2] is available at this site.

   <b>ARITHMETIC</b> <b>MEAN</b>
       This is simply the result of summing all the bytes (bits if the <u>-b</u> option is specified) in the  file  and
       dividing  by  the  file  length.  If the data are close to random, this should be about 127.5 (0.5 for <u>-b</u>
       option output). If the mean departs from this value, the values are consistently high or low.

   <b>MONTE</b> <b>CARLO</b> <b>VALUE</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>PI</b>
       Each successive sequence of six bytes is used as 24 bit X and Y  coordinates  within  a  square.  If  the
       distance of the randomly-generated point is less than the radius of a circle inscribed within the square,
       the six-byte sequence is considered a "hit". The percentage of hits can be used to calculate the value of
       Pi.  For  very  large  streams  (this  approximation  converges very slowly), the value will approach the
       correct value of Pi if the sequence is close to random. A 32768 byte file created  by  radioactive  decay
       yielded:

       Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.139648438 (error 0.06 percent).

   <b>SERIAL</b> <b>CORRELATION</b> <b>COEFFICIENT</b>
       This  quantity  measures  the  extent  to which each byte in the file depends upon the previous byte. For
       random sequences, this value (which can be positive or negative) will, of course, be  close  to  zero.  A
       non-random  byte  stream  such as a C program will yield a serial correlation coefficient on the order of
       0.5. Wildly predictable data such as uncompressed bitmaps will exhibit  serial  correlation  coefficients
       approaching 1. See [Knuth, pp. 64-65] for more details.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -b     The  input  is treated as a stream of bits rather than of 8-bit bytes. Statistics reported reflect
              the properties of the bitstream.

       -c     Print a table of the number of occurrences of each possible byte (or bit, if the <u>-b</u> option is also
              specified) value, and the fraction  of  the  overall  file  made  up  by  that  value.   Printable
              characters  in  the  ISO-8859-1  (Latin-1)  character  set are shown along with their decimal byte
              values. In non-terse output mode, values with zero occurrences are not printed.

       -f     Fold upper case letters to lower case before computing statistics. Folding is done  based  on  the
              ISO-8859-1 (Latin-1) character set, with accented letters correctly processed.

       -t     Terse  mode:  output is written in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format, suitable for loading into a
              spreadsheet and easily read by any programming language. See Terse Mode Output  Format  below  for
              additional details.

       -u     Print how-to-call information.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       If no <u>file</u> is specified, <u>ent</u> obtains its input from standard input.  Output is always written to standard
       output.

</pre><h4><b>TERSE</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       Terse  mode  is selected by specifying the <u>-t</u> option on the command line. Terse mode output is written in
       Comma Separated Value (CSV) format, which can be directly loaded into most spreadsheet  programs  and  is
       easily  read  by  any  programming language. Each record in the CSV file begins with a record type field,
       which identifies the content of the following fields. If the <u>-c</u> option is not specified, the  terse  mode
       output will consist of two records, as follows:

       0,File-bytes,Entropy,Chi-square,Mean,Monte-Carlo-Pi,Serial-Correlation
       1,file_length,entropy,chi_square,mean,Pi_value,correlation

       where the italicised values in the type 1 record are the numerical values for the quantities named in the
       type  0  column title record. If the_ -b_ option is specified, the second field of the type 0 record will
       be "File-bits", and the file_length field in type 1 record will be given in bits instead of bytes. If the
       <u>-c</u> option is specified, additional records are appended to  the  terse  mode  output  which  contain  the
       character counts:

       2,Value,Occurrences,Fraction
       3,v,count,fraction
       ...

       If  the  <u>-b</u>  option is specified, only two type 3 records will appear for the two bit values v=0 and v=1.
       Otherwise, 256 type 3 records are included, one for each possible byte value. The second field of a  type
       3  record  indicates  how  many  bytes  (or  bits) of value v appear in the input, and fraction gives the
       decimal fraction of the file which has value v (which is equal to the count value of this record  divided
       by the file_length field in the type 1 record).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Note  that  the "optimal compression" shown for the file is computed from the byte- or bit-stream entropy
       and thus reflects compressibility based on a reading frame of the chosen width (8-bit bytes or individual
       bits if the <u>-b</u> option is specified). Algorithms which use a larger reading frame, such as the  Lempel-Ziv
       [Lempel  &amp;  Ziv]  algorithm,  may  achieve greater compression if the file contains repeated sequences of
       multiple bytes.
