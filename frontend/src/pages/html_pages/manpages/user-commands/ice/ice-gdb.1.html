</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ice-gdb - JTAG ICE frontend for avr-gdb
       ice-insight - JTAG ICE frontend for avr-insight

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ice-gdb/ice-insight</b> [<b>--debugger</b> <u>debugger</u>] [<b>--capture</b>] [<b>--ignore-intr</b>] [<b>--external</b>] [<u>gdb_arguments</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ice-gdb</b>  (respectively  <b>ice-insight</b>)  starts <b>avr-gdb</b> (respectively <b>avr-insight</b>) and <b>avarice</b> to do on-chip
       debugging on Atmel AVR processors using their JTAG-based on-chip debug facilities, via the Atmel JTAG ICE
       pod.

       The executable for the program being debugged is downloaded to the processor unless the <b>--capture</b>  option
       is  specified. A number of extra commands are available within gdb when started, see their description in
       NEW GDB COMMANDS below. Restrictions on debugging with the JTAG ICE pod are discussed in more  detail  in
       DEBUGGING WITH JTAG ICE below.

       The  arguments  passed  to  <b>avarice</b>  include  the value of the <b>AVARICE_ARGS</b> environment variable. This is
       typically used to specify the serial port to which the JTAG ICE pod is connected by setting  <b>AVARICE_ARGS</b>
       to "-j &lt;serial port name&gt;".

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--debugger</b> <b>debugger_command</b>
              Specify  a  different  debugger  than  avr-gdb (or avr-insight). This other debugger should behave
              similarly to gdb.

       <b>--capture</b>
              Don't download the executable being debugged to the mote, just interrupt the current  program  and
              assume  that  it  matches  the  executable passed to <b>ice-gdb</b>.  This is similar to "attaching" to a
              running program within gdb.

       <b>--ignore-intr</b>
              Pass the <b>--ignore-intr</b> option to <b>avarice</b>.  The single-step commands in gdb (s, n) will then  "step
              over"  interrupt handlers (i.e., if an interrupt occurs, execution will resume for the duration of
              the interrupt).

       <b>--external</b>
              Do not start <b>avarice</b>.  Instead, <b>avr-gdb</b> will attempt to connect to an already running  <b>avarice</b>  on
              port localhost:6423.

</pre><h4><b>NEW</b> <b>GDB</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ice-restart</b>
              Restart avarice.

       <b>ice-load</b> <b>filename</b>
              Download  executable filename to the Atmel processor and start debugging it (this replaces the gdb
              <b>load</b> command).

       <b>target-ice</b>
              Connect to a copy of <b>avarice</b> running on port localhost:6423.

</pre><h4><b>DEBUGGING</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>JTAG</b> <b>ICE</b></h4><pre>
       The JTAG ICE debugging environment has a few restrictions and changes:

       •   No "soft" breakpoints,  and  only  three  hardware  breakpoints.  The  break  command  sets  hardware
           breakpoints.  The  easiest  way to deal with this restriction is to enable and disable breakpoints as
           needed.

       •   Two 1-byte hardware watchpoints (but each hardware watchpoint takes away one hardware breakpoint). If
           you set a watchpoint on a variable which takes more than one byte, execution will be abysmally  slow.
           Instead it is better to do the following:

             watch *(char *)&amp;myvariable

           which watches the least significant byte of <b>myvariable</b>.

       •   The  Atmel  AVR processors have a Harvard architecture (separate code and data buses). To distinguish
           data address 0 from code address 0, <b>avr-gdb</b> adds 0x800000 to all data addresses. Bear  this  in  mind
           when examining printed pointers, or when passing absolute addresses to gdb commands.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>AVARICE_ARGS</b>
              Extra arguments to pass to <b>avarice</b> at startup.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="../man1/gdb.1.html">gdb</a>(1), <a href="../man1/insight.1.html">insight</a>(1).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       On  Windows,  the  <b>ice-gdb</b> and <b>ice-insight</b> commands only work in the <b>cygwin</b> environment. They do not work
       with the <b>mingw</b> environment.
