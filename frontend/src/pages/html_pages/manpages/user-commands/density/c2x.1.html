</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       c2x - converts various crystal formats including density grid data

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>c2x</b> [-OPTIONS] [--FORMAT] [--OPERATION] infile [outfile]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>c2x</b>  converts primarily a CASTEP .check file to various output formats, additionally extracting densities
       (charge, spin, band or psi) and forces. It can also read CASTEP .cell files and PDB  files,  Onetep  .dat
       files,  and  several input and output files from Abinit, Quantum Espresso and VASP, with some support for
       Siesta too. It is a sort of Babel with support for gridded data and .check  files,  and  the  ability  to
       transform  cells and perform simple analysis (integration, interpolation, dipole moment calculation, band
       parity identification).

       It may have been compiled to give access to symmetry functions from spglib too.

       An input file whose name ends '.pdb' is assumed to be in pdb format, ending in '.cif' is assumed to be in
       cif format, ending in '.res' is assumed to be in shelx97, ending '.cub' or '.cube' is assumed  to  be  in
       cube  format,  ending  '.in'  is assumed to be an Abinit or Quantum Espresso input file, ending '.xml' is
       assumed to be a Quantum Espresso output file, ending in '.xsf' is assumed to be in xsf format, and ending
       in '.xv' or 'XV' is assumed to be in Siesta's  XV  format.   Input  files  ending  CHG,  CHGCAR,  POSCAR,
       CONTCAR,  LOCPOT  or  WAVECAR are assumed to be in VASP 5.x format. Input files ending in DEN, POT or WFK
       are assumed to be in Abinit format. Otherwise, if the first byte is either zero, 10 or 30 it  is  assumed
       to  be  a .check file, else it is assumed to be a .cell file. It can also read .orbitals files (which are
       identical to .check files in format), and .castep_bin files (which lack wavefunctions).  Furthermore,  it
       can  read  .chdiff  files and .cst_esp files. In these cases it needs a .cell or a .check file as well in
       order to obtain unit cell information.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a</b>     rotate as though outputing in abc format, i.e. place a along x axis, b in xy plane, and abc form a
              right hand set. Useful if one wants a dx file consistent with a pdb file. See also <b>-3</b>.

       <b>-A</b>     accumulate (sum) bands requested by <b>-b=</b> or <b>-B=</b>.

       <b>-b[=range]</b>
              include specified bands as psi (real).

       <b>-B[=range]</b>
              include specified bands as densities (psi*conjg(psi)).

       <b>-c</b>     include charge density (units electrons per cubic Angstrom).

       <b>--calc</b> evaluate next arg with arithmetic parser and exit.

       <b>--constants</b>
              report internal conversion constants and exit.

       <b>--cubic</b>
              equivalent to --simpson --tricubic

       <b>-C</b>     find "compact" (near-cubic) set of cell vectors.

       <b>-d</b>     read also a corresponding .chdiff file, and output its contents. The filename given must still  be
              that of a .cell or .check file, as a .chdiff file contains no axes.

       <b>--div</b>  replace a vector dataset with its (scalar) divergence.

       <b>-D=[x,y,z]</b>
              if  charge  density  read  (-c),  calculate  dipole moment about fractional co-ordinates x,y,z, or
              0.5,0.5,0.5 if co-ordinates not given. Assumes density has been read as eA^-3.

       <b>-Da=[x,y,z]</b>
              as above, but also report post-hoc energy correction for slab geometry for the a  axis  being  the
              non-periodic axis. Valid values of a: a, b and c.

       <b>-Dm=[x,y,z]</b>
              as  above,  but  also  report  post-hoc  energy correction for a molecule in a cubic box, or for a
              molecule in a tetragonal box if dipole moment is parallel to c.

       <b>-e</b>     read also a corresponding .cst_esp file, and output its contents. The filename given must still be
              that of a .cell or .check file, as a .cst_esp file contains no axes.

       <b>-e=tol</b> set symmetry tolerance to given number of Angstroms.

       <b>-E[=[-][mu]]</b>
              calculate electrostatic potential, assuming that an electron density has been read  (implies  -c).
              Ions  are treated as Gaussian blobs of charge of extent exp(-mu^2r^2). If the ionic charge differs
              from the atomic number, a further localised smoothing of the atomic potential occurs,  unless  the
              first character after the = is -. With -E=0, a bare Coulomb potential is used.

       <b>-f</b>     calculate first failure start of k-point set.

       <b>--fbz</b>  calculate first Brillouin zone

       <b>--fft</b>  use FFT interpolation to move gridded data between different unit cells, and with -z.

       <b>--formats</b>
              list supported formats.

       <b>--frame=N</b>
              extract  single  frame  from  series  of  time  steps. Frames are numbered from zero, and negative
              numbers represent offsets from the end of the sequence,  so  --frame=-1  will  extract  the  final
              frame.

       <b>-F</b>     calculate the potential, then its gradient, to give an electric field.

       <b>--gap</b>  print band gap in eV.

       <b>--grad</b> replace a scalar dataset with its (vector) gradient.

       <b>--grad2</b>
              replace a scalar dataset with the result of the Laplacian operator.

       <b>-H</b>     shift atoms by half a grid cell. For use with xplor data format, see below.

       <b>-i=nx,ny,nz</b>
              Fourier  interpolate onto specified grid size. New grid may be coarser or finer than original. Any
              dimension given as zero is replaced by old grid size. If reading wavefunction, any grid truncation
              is done after transforming back to real space and converting to density etc.

       <b>--ibz</b>  calculate irreducible Brillouin zone.

       <b>-I[=range]</b>
              report whether bands have inversion, and parity under inversion. If combined with -b  or  -B,  the
              last range given is used.

       <b>-k[=range]</b>
              include given kpoints for bands (default range is 1).

       <b>-l</b>     if  k-points  are  to  be  included in a .cell file, explicitly list them rather than using the MP
              generation parameters.

       <b>-L</b>     output in abc format assuming that abc describes a left-handed set  of  axes.   Do  not  use  this
              unless you understand why you should not!

       <b>-m[=a,b,c]</b>
              assume  input  is molecule, not crystal. Try to avoid outputing a cell, shift if some co-ordinates
              are negative, or if a,b,c given shift by those numbers of FFT grid cells.

       <b>-m=(a,b,c)</b>
              assume input is molecule, not crystal. Try to avoid outputing a cell, shift  atoms  by  fractional
              co-ordinates given.

       <b>-n</b>     discard  symmetry  information,  and,  if  output is XSF, discard forces. Give twice to discard k-
              points too.

       <b>-N</b>     normalise by reducing fractional coords to 0&lt;=x&lt;1. In conjunction with -m, do output a cell.

       <b>-O</b>     print band occupancies and evalues to stderr.

       <b>-P</b>     find primitive cell with own internal algorithm, not spglib.

       <b>-P=p1:p2:nn</b>
              output data as line of nn points from p1 to p2. Express p's as either fractional  co-ordinates  in
              the  form  (x,y,z),  or an atom position as, e.g., Si3 for silicon atom number 3, or simply Si for
              the first Si atom. Using a 0 (zero) for a p is equivalent to (0,0,0),  and  the  three  cell  axes
              "(0,0,0):(1,0,0):ngx+1"  (etc.)  can be specified as a, b and c. Each co-ordinate is passed to the
              arithmetic parser, so 1/3 is acceptable for a third, etc.

       <b>-P=p1:rl:nn</b>
              output data with cylindrical averaging. p1 is  the  centre  of  the  cylinder,  rl  (literal  "r",
              followed  by  a  length,  suffixed by "B" if Bohr) is the radius, and nn the number of points. The
              axis of the cylinder must be the c axis, and alpha and beta must be 90 degrees. Data are  averaged
              over c and theta.  Append "w" to number of points to weight samples by two pi times radius, or "a"
              to weight and accumulate.

       <b>-P=p1:Rl:nn</b>
              output data with spherical averaging. p1 is the centre of the sphere, Rl (literal "R", followed by
              a  length,  suffixed by "B" if Bohr) is the radius, and nn the number of points output. The number
              of points for sampling around the spherical surface is chosen to give a similar  point  separation
              to  that  along  the  line. A length of zero will set the length to the maximum possible given the
              periodicity. Data are averaged over theta and phi.  Append "w"  to  number  of  points  to  weight
              samples by four pi times radius squared, or "a" to weight and accumulate.

       <b>-q</b>     calculate post hoc energy correction for charged isolated system. Implies -c.

       <b>-q[abc]</b>
              calculate  post  hoc  energy  correction  for charged 2D system. The axis given (a, b or c) is the
              aperiodic one. Implies -c.

       <b>-Q</b>     sort the atoms on output in descending atomic order

       <b>-Q2</b>    sort the atoms on output in ascending atomic order

       <b>-r</b>     only reduced (symmetry inequivalent) atoms in cif output, or with  the  --fbz  or  --ibz  options,
              reduce k-points to the relevant zone, adjusting weights appropriately.

       <b>-R</b>     don't attempt to rescale densities, but output them raw. Charge density becomes electrons per unit
              cell  if reading from Castep, for instance.  Also do not attempt to adjust radius to maintain bond
              length on nanotube creation.

       <b>-R=x</b>   rescale grid data by factor x, not whatever factor (if any) would normally be used. If the  factor
              is suffixed by an "x", do include c2x's usual conversion factor too.

       <b>-s</b>     include spin density (scalar or vector).

       <b>--simpson</b>
              use Simpson's rule for accumulating/integrating, not trapezium rule.

       <b>--sym_list</b>
              list symmetry elements found in input, without calling SPGlib.

       <b>-S[=range]</b>
              include specified spins or spinors for bands (default range is -, and the spins are numbered 0 and
              1).

       <b>-t=(x1,y1,z1)(x2,y2,z2)[(x3,y3,z3)]</b>
              rotate  co-ordinate  system  so  that  the  first vector becomes the second. First vector given in
              relative co-ordinates. If third axis given, it is used as the rotation  axis.  Else  the  rotation
              axis will be perpendicular to the two axes given.

       <b>--tricubic</b>
              when  interpolating,  using  tricubic  (spline) interpolation in place of trilinear interpolation.
              Slower, might not preserve monotonicity, but does keep first derivative continuous.

       <b>-T=(x1,y1,z1)(x2,y2,z2)[(x3,y3,z3)]</b>
              rotate co-ordinate system so that the first vector  becomes  the  second.  All  vectors  given  in
              absolute  co-ordinates.  If  third  axis given, it is used as the rotation axis. Else the rotation
              axis will be perpendicular to the two axes given.

       <b>-u</b>     use atomic units (Bohrs) when writing .cell files and  1D  data.  Scale  densities  from  A^-3  to
              Bohr^-3 when writing .cube files.

       <b>-U</b>     scale densities from Bohr^-3 to A^-3 when reading .cube files.

       <b>-v</b>     be verbose. Far too much output can be generated if specified more than twice.

       <b>--vec2force[=[species[,species]:]r[i][f]]</b>
              convert  vector field to "forces" on each atom. Use value of vector at atom, unless =r given, when
              average over a sphere of radius r (Angstroms, unless suffixed  with  B  for  Bohr).  If  i  given,
              integrate  rather  than  average.  If f given, use finer grid for averages/integrals. The f may be
              repeated.  If species given, limit "forces" to given atomic species. See also --cubic.

       <b>--version</b>
              print version information. If preceeded by -v, also print internal conversion factors.

       <b>--vmod</b> replace vector grid data by its scalar modulus.

       <b>-w</b>     weight bands by occupancies, or sqrt(occ) if not calculating density.

       <b>-w=k</b>   weight bands by k-point weight, but not occupancy.

       <b>--widths</b>
              calculate band widths naively. Makes sense only if bands do not cross.

       <b>-W</b>     weight bands by occupancies and k-point weight, or sqrt thereof if not calculating density.

       <b>-x=(x1,x2,x3)(y1,y2,y3)(z1,z2,z3)[:n1xn2xn3]</b>
              expand unit cell to new cell specified in terms of the old cell axes. Each co-ordinate  is  passed
              to  the arithmetic parser, so '<a href="../man3/sqrt.3.html">sqrt</a>(3)/2' etc is acceptable. Optionally also specify new grid size
              for gridded data, else this is calculated automatically.

       <b>-x=ixjxk</b>
              expand cell with a trivial tiling.

       <b>-X=(x1,x2,x3)(y1,y2,y3)(z1,z2,z3)[:n1xn2xn3]</b>
              expand unit cell to new cell specified in absolute co-ordinates.  Optionally also specify new grid
              size for gridded data, else this is calculated automatically.

       <b>-X[abc]=x</b>
              change given axis/axes to new length by inserting / removing vacuum around  the  origin.  Removing
              non-existent vacuum will produce nonsense.  Length may be suffixed with B (for Bohr) or nm.

       <b>-y=i,j[:x]</b>
              make  nanotube. The input cell must have c perpendicular to the ab plane, and c as the nonperiodic
              direction of the sheet to be rolled. The circumference is then defined by the vector i*a+j*b.  The
              vector  along the tube's length found automatically, and the size of the cell perpendicular to the
              tube's length is given by the optional parameter x, which may be suffixed with B (for Bohr) or nm.

       <b>-z=p1</b>  print to stdout data at given point, and set output type to null. For specification of p1, see -P=
              option.

       <b>-Z=p1</b>  ditto, but assume that data represents an electron density in A^-3, and also output Perdew  Zunger
              81 XC energy.

       <b>-3</b>     when  moving  from a left hand set of axes to a right hand set, rather than exchanging the 2nd and
              3rd axes, preserve the 3rd and exchange the 1st and 2nd. This transformation is  required  if  the
              input  is  cartesian  and  left handed, and an abc output is requested. Specifying this flag twice
              will cause the 1st and 3rd axes to be exchanged.

</pre><h4><b>COMBINING</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options expect multiple input files to be given, and perform the specified operation.

       <b>--add</b>  Add datasets element-wise.

       <b>--diff</b> Subtract datasets element-wise.

       <b>--mask</b> Multiply datasets element-wise. Although it is assumed that one dataset will be a mask of ones and
              zeros, it need not be so.

       <b>--merge</b>
              Merge datasets. The expected use is merging an atoms-only format with  a  density-only  format  to
              create an output containing both atoms and density.

       <b>--mult</b> Alternative for --mask.

       <b>--sub</b>  Alternative for --diff.

       <b>--sum</b>  Alternative for --add.

       When merging, if files contain conflicting data, the one on the right usually has precidence.

       When  performing  operations on grids, the grids must be the same size.  The use of -i may assist. In all
       cases, the cells must be the same.

</pre><h4><b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       The following output formats are recognised. (See the output of the <b>--formats</b>  option  for  the  complete
       list. Most are also recognised for input provided that their filenames have the expected suffix.)

       <b>--abinit</b>
              Abinit .abi file (for Abinit version 9 and beyond).

       <b>--abinit8</b>
              Abinit  .in file. The output is insufficient to be a valid input file to Abinit, but can easily be
              made so.

       <b>--bands</b>
              CASTEP .bands file, no sorting of bands.

       <b>--bxsf</b> XCrysDen / FermiSurfer file for plotting Fermi surfaces. A symmetry-reduced  kpoint  set  will  be
              expanded. (Not accepted as input.)

       <b>--ccp4</b> CCP4  density  map  format.  Note no atomic positions can be recorded in this format, and c2x will
              always produce a right-hand set of axes unless the input is a lhs and the option -L is given.

       <b>--cell</b> CASTEP .cell, cartesian cell, fractional co-ordinates.

       <b>--cell_abc</b>
              CASTEP .cell, abc cell, fractional co-ordinates.

       <b>--cell_abs</b>
              CASTEP .cell, cartesian cell, absolute co-ordinates.

       <b>--cell_abc_abs</b>
              CASTEP .cell, abc cell, absolute co-ordinates.

       <b>--chgcar</b>
              VASP 5.x chgcar output.

       <b>--cif</b>  a very basic and rigid format which may be compatible with some CIF-reading software.

       <b>--cml</b>  Chemical Markup Language.

       <b>--cube</b> Gaussian cube. Atoms and at most one data set.

       <b>--dx</b>   Data Explorer. Data set only.

       <b>--denfmt</b>
              CASTEP formatted density

       <b>--elk</b>  Elk elk.in format.

       <b>--fdf</b>  Siesta. If a density has been read, a corresponding .RHO file will be written.

       <b>--gcoeff</b>
              An ASCII wavefunction coefficient representation

       <b>--gcoeff_sorted</b>
              The same, sorted by |g|

       <b>--gnu</b>  Gnuplot command file for 1D data.

       <b>--jmol_recip</b>
              Jmol output for Brillouin zones (with --fbz or --ibz only).

       <b>--npy</b>  Numpy array, single dataset, as doubles with -15, else single precision.

       <b>--null</b> Null output. Throw away all output, but still write some useful information the input to stderr.

       <b>--one</b>  Onetep .dat, very similar to .cell. Also one_abc, one_abs, and one_abc_abs.

       <b>--pdb</b>  PDB

       <b>--pdbn</b> PDB, but label the atoms with element symbol and number within that species, e.g.  C8,  H24,  Ca2,
              rather  than  just with element symbol. The whole string can contain no more than four characters,
              so * is used for the numeric part if it would not otherwise fit.

       <b>--py</b>   a python dictionary, compatible with the Atoms data structure from ASE.

       <b>--pya</b>  a python ASE Atoms data structure.

       <b>--qe</b>   Quantum Espresso. Non colinear spins not supported.

       <b>--qef</b>  Ditto, atoms in fractional co-ordinates.

       <b>--shelx</b>
              a subset of the SHELX97 format.

       <b>--vasp</b> VASP 5.x output (poscar or chg).

       <b>--verts</b>
              raw list of vertices for Brillouin zones (with  --fbz  or  --ibz  only).   Also  --verts_frac  for
              vertices in fractional coordinates.

       <b>--vmd_recip</b>
              VMD output for Brillouin zones (with --fbz or --ibz only).

       <b>--xplor</b>
              Xplor  format.  Data set only. The grid used in this format is offset by half a grid cell compared
              to Castep, and as interpolating is inexact, this program does not in this case. Also the grid axes
              are described in terms of a, b, c, alpha, beta, gamma, so information about orientation  in  space
              is  lost.  To  produce a compatible pdb file of atomic co-ordinates, specify <u>-Hc</u> when creating the
              pdb file.

       <b>--xsf</b>  XCrysDen format. Default. The only format in which multiple data sets are supported.

       <b>--xv</b>   Siesta's .XV format (positions only, velocities written as zero). Will also write a .RHO  file  if
              grid  data  have  been  read.  On  reading,  will  also  read a FORCE_STRESS if present. Note that
              FORCE_STRESS has no prefix.

       <b>--xyz</b>  XYZ format. Atoms only, no unit cell.

       Where a range is required, it can be specified as a single integer, two integers separated  by  a  hyphen
       (all  integers  in the given range), or a comma-separated list of any of these elements. Only for the xsf
       output format is a range including more than a single integer meaningful.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       If c2x has been compiled with spglib, the following spglib operations are available.

       <b>--int</b>  call spg_get_dataset() and report international symbol

       <b>--list</b> call spg_get_dataset() and list symmetry ops

       <b>--point</b>
              call spg_get_dataset() followed by spg_get_pointgroup()

       <b>--primitive</b>
              call spg_find_primitive(), equivalent to spg_standardize_cell(to_primitive=1, no_idealize=0). This
              may rotate the cell to a standardised orientation.

       <b>--primitive_nr</b>
              call spg_standardize_cell(to_primitive=1, no_idealize=1), so primitive no rotation

       <b>--refine</b>
              call spg_refine_cell()

       <b>--schoen</b>
              call spg_get_schoenflies()

       <b>--snap</b> call spg_standardize_cell() then expand back to a snapped version of the original cell

       <b>--snap_tr</b>
              ditto, but include any translation introduced by spglib

       <b>--standardise</b>
              call spg_standardize_cell(no_idealize=1)

       <b>--std_ideal</b>
              call spg_standardize_cell(no_idealize=0)

       <b>--symmetry</b> or <b>--symm</b>
              call spg_get_dataset() and keep symmetry ops

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       For the pdb formats, just the unit cell and atomic positions are read or written. For the  dx  and  xplor
       formats,  just  a  single data set is written.  For the Gaussian cube format atomic positions and at most
       one data set are recorded, and for the XCrysDen format the unit cell, atomic positions, forces,  and  any
       number of data sets are recorded.

       When  reading  a  .geom  file  and writing a format containing a single frame, the last frame is written,
       unless the --frame option is given.

       When reporting symmetry operations, all co-ordinates are fractional.

       Note that the pdb format offers a very low precision for storing co-ordinates, and, because it stores the
       unit cell in abc format, and the atoms in absolute coordinates, a rotation is likely to  be  required  to
       place  <b>a</b> on the cartesian <b>x</b> axis, etc. If so, it will be done automatically. The same is true for the abc
       varients of the cell format and for the Xplor and cif  file  formats.  This  rotation  can  be  specified
       explicitly  for  other  formats.  Additionally  the axes must form a right-handed set. If this is not the
       case, two axes will be interchanged.  By default, <b>b</b> and <b>c</b> are exchanged, but the flag <b>-3</b> will cause <b>a</b> and
       <b>b</b> to be exchanged instead.

       The cif reader reads little more than c2x's cif output. It is very basic, and will fail to read correctly
       a large number of valid cif files.  There is currently no intention to produce a proper cif reader.

       When outputting psi it is assumed that it is possible to make psi real by unwinding any phase produced by
       the k-point, and then multiplying all points by the same arbitrary complex constant. If this is  not  so,
       the  band  was  probably  nonsense  anyway.  The final choice of a factor of -1 is arbitrary. This scheme
       produces nonsense if one attempts to plot a degenerate band.

       When doing the conversions resulting from -x, a new grid will be chosen of similar density  to  the  old,
       and  the  data  interpolated  onto the new using trilinear interpolation. Extrapolating psis (rather than
       densities) is meaningless except at gamma, for the phase due to the k point is not considered.

       Densities by default are in Angstroms**-3, and psis in Angstroms**-1.5, save that .RHO files are  written
       in Bohr**-3 as expected.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To extract the charge density in xsf format

              c2x -c input.check output.xsf

       To extract the first four bands as psi at the second k-point in xsf format

              c2x -b=1-4 -k=2 input.check output.xsf

       To convert a check file to a pdb file

              c2x --pdb input.check output.pdb

       To  convert  a  cell to something containing two repeat units in the a and b directions, and one in the c
       direction

              c2x --cell -x='(2,0,0)(0,2,0)(0,0,1)' in.cell out.cell

              or, from c2x version 2.30,

              c2x --cell -x=2x2x1 in.cell out.cell

       Assuming the above cell was a 3.5A cube, the same in absolute co-ordinates

              c2x --cell -X='(7,0,0)(0,7,0)(0,0,3.5)' in.cell out.cell

       To change a cell containing one layer of bulk in the c direction  to  one  containing  four  layers,  and
       sufficient vacuum to make a total length of 30A

              c2x --cell -x=1x1x4 -Xc=30 in.cell out.cell
