</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pinto - Curate a custom repository of Perl modules

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       version 0.14

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         pinto --root=REPOSITORY_ROOT [global options] COMMAND [command options] [args]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       pinto is a tool for creating and managing a custom CPAN-like repository of Perl modules.  The purpose of
       such a repository is to provide a stable, curated stack of dependencies from which you can reliably
       build, test, and deploy your application using the standard Perl tool chain.  pinto provides various
       commands for gathering and managing distribution dependencies within the repository, so that you can
       control precisely which dependencies go into your application.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       pinto supports several commands that perform various operations on your repository, or report information
       about your repository.  To get a listing of all the available commands:

         $&gt; pinto commands

       Each command has its own options and arguments.  To get a brief summary:

         $&gt; pinto help COMMAND

       To see the complete manual for a command:

         $&gt; pinto manual COMMAND

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are available for all commands.

       --root DIRECTORY | URI
       -r DIRECTORY | URI
           Specifies the root of your repository.  This is mandatory for (almost) all commands unless you set it
           via  the "PINTO_REPOSITORY_ROOT" environment variable.  The root can be the path to a local directory
           or an equivalent "file://" URI.

           The root can also be the  URI  where  a  pintod  server  is  listening.   Depending  on  your  server
           configuration, you may need to specify the port number in the URI, which is usually 3111.

       --color
       --colour
       --no-color
       --no-colour
           Enable  or disable colorized command output.  By default, color is enabled unless the output is being
           sent to a pipe or file.  Set the "PINTO_NO_COLOR" environment variable to disable color by default.

       --password PASS
       -p PASS
           The password to use for server authentication.  This is only relevant if using a  remote  repository.
           If the PASS is "-" then you will be prompted for a password.

       --quiet
       -q  Report  only  fatal errors.  This option silently overrides the "--verbose" options.  Also suppresses
           the progress meter.

           Note: The progress meter is always suppressed when using a remote repository.  This will hopefully be
           fixed a future release.

       --username NAME
       -u NAME
           The username to user for server authentication.  This is only relevant if using a remote  repository.
           Defaults to your current login.

       --verbose
       -v  Display  more  diagnostic  messages.   This switch can be repeated multiple times for greater effect.
           Diagnostic messages are always sent to STDERR.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Each repository has a configuration file that lives inside  the  repository  at  <u>.pinto/config/pinto.ini</u>.
       This file is generated for you with default values when you create the repository.  You can influence the
       initial value for some of the properties when you run the init command.  Thereafter, you can change these
       properties by editing the configuraiton file directly.

       The following configuration parameters are supported:

       sources = URL1 [URL2 URL3 ...]
           This  is  a  space-delimited list of the URLs for the upstream repositories that this repository will
           pull archives from.  These can point to CPAN mirrors, minicpan mirrors, or stacks within other  Pinto
           repositories.   Pinto  will  search  the  source repositories in the order they are listed here.  The
           default value is "<a href="http://cpan.perl.org">http://cpan.perl.org</a> <a href="http://backpan.perl.org">http://backpan.perl.org</a>".

       target_perl_version = X.X.X
           Sets the default "target_perl_version" property for all new stacks.  Otherwise, all new  stacks  will
           target  the  version  of perl that you first used to create the repository.  You can always configure
           the target perl for each stack independently by using the props command.

       intermingle = 1 | 0
           If true, stacks will be allowed  to  "intermingle"  distributions  that  have  partially  overlapping
           packages.   This makes pinto behave like PAUSE which allows a package to remain in the index until it
           is replaced by a distribution containing the same package.  Thus, it  becomes  possible  to  have  an
           index that contains just "some" of the packages in a particular distribution.  This typically occurrs
           when a package in a prior release is absent from a subsequent release.  The default is false.

       <b>BEWARE:</b> The above configuration properties are global -- they affect every stack in the repository.  They
       also  have  a  major  affect on how the repository behaves.  For these reasons, it is generally unwise to
       change these parameters once you have established the repository and filled it with content.  If  you  do
       change  them,  be  sure  and  notify  your  team  about  it.   Each  stack  also  has some stack-specific
       configuration properties.  Those can be shown or set using the props command.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables influence the behavior of pinto.  If you have installed  pinto  as  a
       stand-alone  application  as  described  in  Pinto::Manual::Installing,  then the best place to set these
       variables is in your <u><a href="file:~/.pintorc">~/.pintorc</a></u> file.

       "PINTO_REPOSITORY_ROOT"
           Sets the default path or URL of the pinto repository, if the "--root" is not specified.  The "--root"
           is required for almost all commands.  So if you usually only work with one repository,  then  setting
           this can save you quite a bit of typing.

       "PINTO_EDITOR"
           Sets  the path to editor application that will be used to compose log messages.  If not set, defaults
           to "VISUAL" or "EDITOR".  If none of those are set, either "nano", "pico", or "vi" will be  used  (in
           that order).

       "PINTO_NO_COLOR"
       "PINTO_NO_COLOUR"
           If set to a true value, suppresses color in all command output.

       "PINTO_PALETTE"
           A  comma-separated  list  of  exactly  three  color  names.  Any name supported by Term::ANSIColor is
           allowed.  These will be the colors that pinto uses to colorize various output.  For example:

             PINTO_PALETTE='red, light blue, green on_white'

           Listing too many or too few colors will cause an exception, as will using an invalid color name.  For
           backward compatibility the variables "PINTO_COLORS" and "PINTO_COLOURS" can also be  used  (but  they
           are deprecated).

       "PINTO_USERNAME"
           Sets  the  default username when "--username" is not specified.  This is only used for authentication
           with a pintod server.  Defaults to your current shell username.

       "PINTO_AUTHOR_ID"
           Sets the default author identity when the "--author" option is not specified (currently, only used by
           the add command).  Defaults to your current shell username.  By PAUSE convention, all author id's are
           forced to uppercase.

       "PINTO_PAGER"
           Sets the path to the pager application that will be  used  to  paginate  output  from  each  command.
           Defaults to "PAGER".  If none of these are set, then no pager is used.

       "PINTO_PAGER_OPTIONS"
           Sets  the options that will be passed to the pager (if there is one).  For example, you could use the
           "-R" option to instruct "less" to pass through the colors that pinto usually displays:

             export PINTO_PAGER_OPTIONS=-R

           Most  pagers  have  their  own   environment   variables   to   control   their   default   behavior.
           "PINTO_PAGER_OPTIONS" gives you a way to set defaults that are specific to when you are using it with
           pinto.

       "PINTO_DIFF_STYLE"
           Sets  the default style for diff reports.  Valid styles are "detailed" and "concise".  The default is
           "concise".  For commands that produce diff reports, this can be  overriden  with  the  "--diff-style"
           option.  This variable only has effect when using a local repository.

       "PINTO_DEBUG"
           If  set  to 1, pinto will emit more diagnostic messages to STDERR.  If set to 2, pinto will emit even
           more diagnostic messages.  This variable only has effect when using a local repository.

       "PINTO_LOCKFILE_TIMEOUT"
           Sets the timeout (in seconds) for obtaining a lock on the  repository.   The  default  is  50.   This
           variable only has effect when using a local repository.

       "PINTO_STALE_LOCKFILE_TIMEOUT"
           Sets  the timeout (in seconds) to consider a lock on the repository stale and expire it.  The default
           is 0 (don't expire).  This variable only has effect when using a local repository.

       "PINTO_SHELL"
           Sets the path to the command pinto will use for interactive shells (like with the look  command).  If
           this is not set, pinto defaults to either "SHELL" or "COMSPEC".
