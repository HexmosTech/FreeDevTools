</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gmx</b>  <b>pdb2gmx</b>  reads a <u>.pdb</u> (or <u>.gro</u>) file, reads some database files, adds hydrogens to the molecules and
       generates coordinates in GROMACS (GROMOS), or optionally <u>.pdb</u>, format and a topology in  GROMACS  format.
       These files can subsequently be processed to generate a run input file.

       <b>gmx</b>  <b>pdb2gmx</b>  will  search  for  force  fields  by  looking  for  a <b>forcefield.itp</b> file in subdirectories
       <b>&lt;forcefield&gt;.ff</b> of the current working directory and of the GROMACS library directory  as  inferred  from
       the  path  of  the  binary  or  the  <b>GMXLIB</b> environment variable.  By default the forcefield selection is
       interactive, but you can use the <b>-ff</b> option to specify one of the short names in the list on the  command
       line instead. In that case <b>gmx</b> <b>pdb2gmx</b> just looks for the corresponding <b>&lt;forcefield&gt;.ff</b> directory.

       After  choosing  a force field, all files will be read only from the corresponding force field directory.
       If you want to modify or add a residue types, you can copy the force field  directory  from  the  GROMACS
       library  directory  to  your current working directory. If you want to add new protein residue types, you
       will need to modify <b>residuetypes.dat</b> in the library directory or copy the whole library  directory  to  a
       local  directory  and set the environment variable <b>GMXLIB</b> to the name of that directory.  Check Chapter 5
       of the manual for more information about file formats.

       Note that a <u>.pdb</u> file is nothing more than a file format, and it need not necessarily contain  a  protein
       structure.  Every kind of molecule for which there is support in the database can be converted.  If there
       is no support in the database, you can add it yourself.

       The program has limited intelligence, it reads a number of database files, that allow it to make  special
       bonds  (Cys-Cys, Heme-His, etc.), if necessary this can be done manually. The program can prompt the user
       to select which kind of LYS, ASP, GLU, CYS or HIS residue is desired.  For  Lys  the  choice  is  between
       neutral  (two  protons  on  NZ)  or  protonated  (three  protons,  default), for Asp and Glu unprotonated
       (default) or protonated, for His the proton can be either on ND1, on NE2 or on  both.  By  default  these
       selections  are  done automatically.  For His, this is based on an optimal hydrogen bonding conformation.
       Hydrogen  bonds  are  defined  based  on  a  simple  geometric  criterion,  specified  by   the   maximum
       hydrogen-donor-acceptor   angle   and  donor-acceptor  distance,  which  are  set  by  <b>-angle</b>  and  <b>-dist</b>
       respectively.

       The protonation state of N- and C-termini can be  chosen  interactively  with  the  <b>-ter</b>  flag.   Default
       termini  are  ionized  (NH3+  and  COO-), respectively.  Some force fields support zwitterionic forms for
       chains of one residue, but for polypeptides these options should NOT be selected.  The AMBER force fields
       have unique forms for the terminal residues, and these are incompatible with the <b>-ter</b> mechanism. You need
       to prefix your N- or C-terminal residue names with "N" or "C" respectively to  use  these  forms,  making
       sure  you preserve the format of the coordinate file. Alternatively, use named terminating residues (e.g.
       ACE, NME).

       The separation of chains is not entirely trivial since the markup in user-generated PDB files  frequently
       varies  and  sometimes  it  is desirable to merge entries across a TER record, for instance if you want a
       disulfide bridge or distance restraints between two protein chains or if you have a HEME group bound to a
       protein.  In such cases multiple chains should be contained in  a  single  <b>moleculetype</b>  definition.   To
       handle  this,  <b>gmx</b>  <b>pdb2gmx</b>  uses two separate options.  First, <b>-chainsep</b> allows you to choose when a new
       chemical chain should start, and termini added when applicable. This can be done based on  the  existence
       of  TER  records,  when the chain id changes, or combinations of either or both of these. You can also do
       the selection fully interactively.  In addition, there is a <b>-merge</b>  option  that  controls  how  multiple
       chains  are  merged  into  one moleculetype, after adding all the chemical termini (or not).  This can be
       turned off (no merging), all non-water chains can be merged into a single molecule, or the selection  can
       be done interactively.

       <b>gmx</b> <b>pdb2gmx</b> will also check the occupancy field of the <u>.pdb</u> file.  If any of the occupancies are not one,
       indicating that the atom is not resolved well in the structure, a warning message is issued.  When a <u>.pdb</u>
       file  does  not  originate from an X-ray structure determination all occupancy fields may be zero. Either
       way, it is up to the user to verify the correctness of the input data (read the article!).

       During processing the atoms will be reordered according to GROMACS conventions. With <b>-n</b> an index file can
       be generated that contains one group reordered in the same way. This  allows  you  to  convert  a  GROMOS
       trajectory and coordinate file to GROMOS. There is one limitation: reordering is done after the hydrogens
       are stripped from the input and before new hydrogens are added. This means that you should not use <b>-ignh</b>.

       The  <u>.gro</u>  and <b>.g96</b> file formats do not support chain identifiers. Therefore it is useful to enter a <u>.pdb</u>
       file name at the <b>-o</b> option when you want to convert a multi-chain <u>.pdb</u> file.

       The option <b>-vsite</b> removes hydrogen and fast improper dihedral motions. Angular and  out-of-plane  motions
       can  be  removed  by  changing hydrogens into virtual sites and fixing angles, which fixes their position
       relative to neighboring atoms. Additionally, all atoms in the aromatic rings of the standard amino  acids
       (i.e.  PHE, TRP, TYR and HIS) can be converted into virtual sites, eliminating the fast improper dihedral
       fluctuations in these rings (but this feature is deprecated).  <b>Note</b> that in this case all other  hydrogen
       atoms  are  also converted to virtual sites. The mass of all atoms that are converted into virtual sites,
       is added to the heavy atoms.

       Also slowing down of dihedral motion can be done with <b>-heavyh</b> done by increasing the hydrogen-mass  by  a
       factor  of  4.  This  is  also done for water hydrogens to slow down the rotational motion of water.  The
       increase in mass of the hydrogens is subtracted from the bonded (heavy) atom so that the  total  mass  of
       the  system  remains the same.  As a special case, ring-closed (or cyclic) molecules are considered.  <b>gmx</b>
       <b>pdb2gmx</b> automatically determines if a cyclic molecule is present by evaluating the distance  between  the
       terminal  atoms  of  a  given  chain.   If  this  distance  is  greater than the <b>-sb</b> ("Short bond warning
       distance", default 0.05 nm) and less than the <b>-lb</b> ("Long bond warning distance",  default  0.25  nm)  the
       molecule  is  considered to be ring closed and will be processed as such.  Please note that this does not
       detect cyclic bonds over periodic boundaries.
