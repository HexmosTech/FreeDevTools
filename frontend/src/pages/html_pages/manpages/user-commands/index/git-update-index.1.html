</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Modifies the index. Each file mentioned is updated into the index and any <u>unmerged</u> or <u>needs</u> <u>updating</u>
       state is cleared.

       See also <b><a href="../man1/git-add.1.html">git-add</a></b>(1) for a more user-friendly way to do some of the most common operations on the index.

       The way <u>git</u> <u>update-index</u> handles files it is told about can be modified using the various options:

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --add
           If a specified file isn’t in the index already then it’s added. Default behaviour is to ignore new
           files.

       --remove
           If a specified file is in the index but is missing then it’s removed. Default behavior is to ignore
           removed files.

       --refresh
           Looks at the current index and checks to see if merges or updates are needed by checking stat()
           information.

       -q
           Quiet. If --refresh finds that the index needs an update, the default behavior is to error out. This
           option makes <u>git</u> <u>update-index</u> continue anyway.

       --ignore-submodules
           Do not try to update submodules. This option is only respected when passed before --refresh.

       --unmerged
           If --refresh finds unmerged changes in the index, the default behavior is to error out. This option
           makes <u>git</u> <u>update-index</u> continue anyway.

       --ignore-missing
           Ignores missing files during a --refresh

       --cacheinfo &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;object&gt;,&lt;path&gt;, --cacheinfo &lt;mode&gt; &lt;object&gt; &lt;path&gt;
           Directly insert the specified info into the index. For backward compatibility, you can also give
           these three arguments as three separate parameters, but new users are encouraged to use a
           single-parameter form.

       --index-info
           Read index information from stdin.

       --chmod=(+|-)x
           Set the execute permissions on the updated files.

       --[no-]assume-unchanged
           When this flag is specified, the object names recorded for the paths are not updated. Instead, this
           option sets/unsets the "assume unchanged" bit for the paths. When the "assume unchanged" bit is on,
           the user promises not to change the file and allows Git to assume that the working tree file matches
           what is recorded in the index. If you want to change the working tree file, you need to unset the bit
           to tell Git. This is sometimes helpful when working with a big project on a filesystem that has a
           very slow <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a>(2) system call (e.g. cifs).

           Git will fail (gracefully) in case it needs to modify this file in the index e.g. when merging in a
           commit; thus, in case the assumed-untracked file is changed upstream, you will need to handle the
           situation manually.

       --really-refresh
           Like <b>--refresh</b>, but checks stat information unconditionally, without regard to the "assume unchanged"
           setting.

       --[no-]skip-worktree
           When one of these flags is specified, the object names recorded for the paths are not updated.
           Instead, these options set and unset the "skip-worktree" bit for the paths. See section
           "Skip-worktree bit" below for more information.

       --[no-]ignore-skip-worktree-entries
           Do not remove skip-worktree (AKA "index-only") entries even when the <b>--remove</b> option was specified.

       --[no-]fsmonitor-valid
           When one of these flags is specified, the object names recorded for the paths are not updated.
           Instead, these options set and unset the "fsmonitor valid" bit for the paths. See section "File
           System Monitor" below for more information.

       -g, --again
           Runs <u>git</u> <u>update-index</u> itself on the paths whose index entries are different from those of the <b>HEAD</b>
           commit.

       --unresolve
           Restores the <u>unmerged</u> or <u>needs</u> <u>updating</u> state of a file during a merge if it was cleared by accident.

       --info-only
           Do not create objects in the object database for all &lt;file&gt; arguments that follow this flag; just
           insert their object IDs into the index.

       --force-remove
           Remove the file from the index even when the working directory still has such a file. (Implies
           --remove.)

       --replace
           By default, when a file <b>path</b> exists in the index, <u>git</u> <u>update-index</u> refuses an attempt to add
           <b>path/file</b>. Similarly if a file <b>path/file</b> exists, a file <b>path</b> cannot be added. With --replace flag,
           existing entries that conflict with the entry being added are automatically removed with warning
           messages.

       --stdin
           Instead of taking a list of paths from the command line, read a list of paths from the standard
           input. Paths are separated by LF (i.e. one path per line) by default.

       --verbose
           Report what is being added and removed from the index.

       --index-version &lt;n&gt;
           Write the resulting index out in the named on-disk format version. Supported versions are 2, 3, and
           4. The current default version is 2 or 3, depending on whether extra features are used, such as <b>git</b>
           <b>add</b> <b>-N</b>. With <b>--verbose</b>, also report the version the index file uses before and after this command.

           Version 4 performs a simple pathname compression that reduces index size by 30%-50% on large
           repositories, which results in faster load time. Git supports it since version 1.8.0, released in
           October 2012, and support for it was added to libgit2 in 2016 and to JGit in 2020. Older versions of
           this manual page called it "relatively young", but it should be considered mature technology these
           days.

       --show-index-version
           Report the index format version used by the on-disk index file. See <b>--index-version</b> above.

       -z
           Only meaningful with <b>--stdin</b> or <b>--index-info</b>; paths are separated with NUL character instead of LF.

       --split-index, --no-split-index
           Enable or disable split index mode. If split-index mode is already enabled and <b>--split-index</b> is given
           again, all changes in $GIT_DIR/index are pushed back to the shared index file.

           These options take effect whatever the value of the <b>core.splitIndex</b> configuration variable (see <b><a href="../man1/gitconfig.1.html">git-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man1/gitconfig.1.html">config</a></b>(1)). But a warning is emitted when the change goes against the configured value, as the
           configured value will take effect next time the index is read and this will remove the intended
           effect of the option.

       --untracked-cache, --no-untracked-cache
           Enable or disable untracked cache feature. Please use <b>--test-untracked-cache</b> before enabling it.

           These options take effect whatever the value of the <b>core.untrackedCache</b> configuration variable (see
           <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)). But a warning is emitted when the change goes against the configured value, as the
           configured value will take effect next time the index is read and this will remove the intended
           effect of the option.

       --test-untracked-cache
           Only perform tests on the working directory to make sure untracked cache can be used. You have to
           manually enable untracked cache using <b>--untracked-cache</b> or <b>--force-untracked-cache</b> or the
           <b>core.untrackedCache</b> configuration variable afterwards if you really want to use it. If a test fails
           the exit code is 1 and a message explains what is not working as needed, otherwise the exit code is 0
           and OK is printed.

       --force-untracked-cache
           Same as <b>--untracked-cache</b>. Provided for backwards compatibility with older versions of Git where
           <b>--untracked-cache</b> used to imply <b>--test-untracked-cache</b> but this option would enable the extension
           unconditionally.

       --fsmonitor, --no-fsmonitor
           Enable or disable files system monitor feature. These options take effect whatever the value of the
           <b>core.fsmonitor</b> configuration variable (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)). But a warning is emitted when the change
           goes against the configured value, as the configured value will take effect next time the index is
           read and this will remove the intended effect of the option.

       --
           Do not interpret any more arguments as options.

       &lt;file&gt;
           Files to act on. Note that files beginning with <u>.</u>  are discarded. This includes <b>./file</b> and
           <b>dir/./file</b>. If you don’t want this, then use cleaner names. The same applies to directories ending <u>/</u>
           and paths with <u>//</u>

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>--REFRESH</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--refresh</b> does not calculate a new sha1 file or bring the index up to date for mode/content changes. But
       what it <b>does</b> do is to "re-match" the stat information of a file with the index, so that you can refresh
       the index for a file that hasn’t been changed but where the stat entry is out of date.

       For example, you’d want to do this after doing a <u>git</u> <u>read-tree</u>, to link up the stat index details with
       the proper files.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>--CACHEINFO</b> <b>OR</b> <b>--INFO-ONLY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--cacheinfo</b> is used to register a file that is not in the current working directory. This is useful for
       minimum-checkout merging.

       To pretend you have a file at path with mode and sha1, say:

           $ git update-index --add --cacheinfo &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;sha1&gt;,&lt;path&gt;

       <b>--info-only</b> is used to register files without placing them in the object database. This is useful for
       status-only repositories.

       Both <b>--cacheinfo</b> and <b>--info-only</b> behave similarly: the index is updated but the object database isn’t.
       <b>--cacheinfo</b> is useful when the object is in the database but the file isn’t available locally.
       <b>--info-only</b> is useful when the file is available, but you do not wish to update the object database.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>--INDEX-INFO</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--index-info</b> is a more powerful mechanism that lets you feed multiple entry definitions from the standard
       input, and designed specifically for scripts. It can take inputs of three formats:

        1. mode SP type SP sha1 TAB path

           This format is to stuff <b>git</b> <b>ls-tree</b> output into the index.

        2. mode SP sha1 SP stage TAB path

           This format is to put higher order stages into the index file and matches <u>git</u> <u>ls-files</u> <u>--stage</u>
           output.

        3. mode SP sha1 TAB path

           This format is no longer produced by any Git command, but is and will continue to be supported by
           <b>update-index</b> <b>--index-info</b>.

       To place a higher stage entry to the index, the path should first be removed by feeding a mode=0 entry
       for the path, and then feeding necessary input lines in the third format.

       For example, starting with this index:

           $ git ls-files -s
           100644 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 0       frotz

       you can feed the following input to <b>--index-info</b>:

           $ git update-index --index-info
           0 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000      frotz
           100644 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 1       frotz
           100755 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 2       frotz

       The first line of the input feeds 0 as the mode to remove the path; the SHA-1 does not matter as long as
       it is well formatted. Then the second and third line feeds stage 1 and stage 2 entries for that path.
       After the above, we would end up with this:

           $ git ls-files -s
           100644 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 1       frotz
           100755 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 2       frotz

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>“ASSUME</b> <b>UNCHANGED”</b> <b>BIT</b></h4><pre>
       Many operations in Git depend on your filesystem to have an efficient <b>lstat</b>(<b>2</b>) implementation, so that
       <b>st_mtime</b> information for working tree files can be cheaply checked to see if the file contents have
       changed from the version recorded in the index file. Unfortunately, some filesystems have inefficient
       <b>lstat</b>(<b>2</b>). If your filesystem is one of them, you can set "assume unchanged" bit to paths you have not
       changed to cause Git not to do this check. Note that setting this bit on a path does not mean Git will
       check the contents of the file to see if it has changed — it makes Git to omit any checking and assume it
       has <b>not</b> changed. When you make changes to working tree files, you have to explicitly tell Git about it by
       dropping "assume unchanged" bit, either before or after you modify them.

       In order to set "assume unchanged" bit, use <b>--assume-unchanged</b> option. To unset, use
       <b>--no-assume-unchanged</b>. To see which files have the "assume unchanged" bit set, use <b>git</b> <b>ls-files</b> <b>-v</b> (see
       <b><a href="../man1/git-ls-files.1.html">git-ls-files</a></b>(1)).

       The command looks at <b>core.ignorestat</b> configuration variable. When this is true, paths updated with <b>git</b>
       <b>update-index</b> <b>paths.</b>.. and paths updated with other Git commands that update both index and working tree
       (e.g. <u>git</u> <u>apply</u> <u>--index</u>, <u>git</u> <u>checkout-index</u> <u>-u</u>, and <u>git</u> <u>read-tree</u> <u>-u</u>) are automatically marked as "assume
       unchanged". Note that "assume unchanged" bit is <b>not</b> set if <b>git</b> <b>update-index</b> <b>--refresh</b> finds the working
       tree file matches the index (use <b>git</b> <b>update-index</b> <b>--really-refresh</b> if you want to mark them as "assume
       unchanged").

       Sometimes users confuse the assume-unchanged bit with the skip-worktree bit. See the final paragraph in
       the "Skip-worktree bit" section below for an explanation of the differences.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To update and refresh only the files already checked out:

           $ git checkout-index -n -f -a &amp;&amp; git update-index --ignore-missing --refresh

       On an inefficient filesystem with <b>core.ignorestat</b> set

               $ git update-index --really-refresh              <b>(1)</b>
               $ git update-index --no-assume-unchanged foo.c   <b>(2)</b>
               $ git diff --name-only                           <b>(3)</b>
               $ edit foo.c
               $ git diff --name-only                           <b>(4)</b>
               M foo.c
               $ git update-index foo.c                         <b>(5)</b>
               $ git diff --name-only                           <b>(6)</b>
               $ edit foo.c
               $ git diff --name-only                           <b>(7)</b>
               $ git update-index --no-assume-unchanged foo.c   <b>(8)</b>
               $ git diff --name-only                           <b>(9)</b>
               M foo.c

            <b>1.</b> forces <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a>(2) to set "assume unchanged" bits for paths that match index.
            <b>2.</b> mark the path to be edited.
            <b>3.</b> this does <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a>(2) and finds index matches the path.
            <b>4.</b> this does <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a>(2) and finds index does <b>not</b> match the path.
            <b>5.</b> registering the new version to index sets "assume unchanged" bit.
            <b>6.</b> and it is assumed unchanged.
            <b>7.</b> even after you edit it.
            <b>8.</b> you can tell about the change after the fact.
            <b>9.</b> now it checks with <a href="../man2/lstat.2.html">lstat</a>(2) and finds it has been changed.

</pre><h4><b>SKIP-WORKTREE</b> <b>BIT</b></h4><pre>
       Skip-worktree bit can be defined in one (long) sentence: Tell git to avoid writing the file to the
       working directory when reasonably possible, and treat the file as unchanged when it is not present in the
       working directory.

       Note that not all git commands will pay attention to this bit, and some only partially support it.

       The update-index flags and the read-tree capabilities relating to the skip-worktree bit predated the
       introduction of the <b><a href="../man1/git-sparse-checkout.1.html">git-sparse-checkout</a></b>(1) command, which provides a much easier way to configure and
       handle the skip-worktree bits. If you want to reduce your working tree to only deal with a subset of the
       files in the repository, we strongly encourage the use of <b><a href="../man1/git-sparse-checkout.1.html">git-sparse-checkout</a></b>(1) in preference to the
       low-level update-index and read-tree primitives.

       The primary purpose of the skip-worktree bit is to enable sparse checkouts, i.e. to have working
       directories with only a subset of paths present. When the skip-worktree bit is set, Git commands (such as
       <b>switch</b>, <b>pull</b>, <b>merge</b>) will avoid writing these files. However, these commands will sometimes write these
       files anyway in important cases such as conflicts during a merge or rebase. Git commands will also avoid
       treating the lack of such files as an intentional deletion; for example <b>git</b> <b>add</b> <b>-u</b> will not stage a
       deletion for these files and <b>git</b> <b>commit</b> <b>-a</b> will not make a commit deleting them either.

       Although this bit looks similar to assume-unchanged bit, its goal is different. The assume-unchanged bit
       is for leaving the file in the working tree but having Git omit checking it for changes and presuming
       that the file has not been changed (though if it can determine without stat’ing the file that it has
       changed, it is free to record the changes). skip-worktree tells Git to ignore the absence of the file,
       avoid updating it when possible with commands that normally update much of the working directory (e.g.
       <b>checkout</b>, <b>switch</b>, <b>pull</b>, etc.), and not have its absence be recorded in commits. Note that in sparse
       checkouts (setup by <b>git</b> <b>sparse-checkout</b> or by configuring core.sparseCheckout to true), if a file is
       marked as skip-worktree in the index but is found in the working tree, Git will clear the skip-worktree
       bit for that file.

</pre><h4><b>SPLIT</b> <b>INDEX</b></h4><pre>
       This mode is designed for repositories with very large indexes, and aims at reducing the time it takes to
       repeatedly write these indexes.

       In this mode, the index is split into two files, $GIT_DIR/index and $GIT_DIR/sharedindex.&lt;SHA-1&gt;. Changes
       are accumulated in $GIT_DIR/index, the split index, while the shared index file contains all index
       entries and stays unchanged.

       All changes in the split index are pushed back to the shared index file when the number of entries in the
       split index reaches a level specified by the splitIndex.maxPercentChange config variable (see <b><a href="../man1/gitconfig.1.html">git-</a></b>
       <b><a href="../man1/gitconfig.1.html">config</a></b>(1)).

       Each time a new shared index file is created, the old shared index files are deleted if their
       modification time is older than what is specified by the splitIndex.sharedIndexExpire config variable
       (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)).

       To avoid deleting a shared index file that is still used, its modification time is updated to the current
       time every time a new split index based on the shared index file is either created or read from.

</pre><h4><b>UNTRACKED</b> <b>CACHE</b></h4><pre>
       This cache is meant to speed up commands that involve determining untracked files such as <b>git</b> <b>status</b>.

       This feature works by recording the mtime of the working tree directories and then omitting reading
       directories and stat calls against files in those directories whose mtime hasn’t changed. For this to
       work the underlying operating system and file system must change the <b>st_mtime</b> field of directories if
       files in the directory are added, modified or deleted.

       You can test whether the filesystem supports that with the <b>--test-untracked-cache</b> option. The
       <b>--untracked-cache</b> option used to implicitly perform that test in older versions of Git, but that’s no
       longer the case.

       If you want to enable (or disable) this feature, it is easier to use the <b>core.untrackedCache</b>
       configuration variable (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)) than using the <b>--untracked-cache</b> option to <b>git</b> <b>update-index</b> in
       each repository, especially if you want to do so across all repositories you use, because you can set the
       configuration variable to <b>true</b> (or <b>false</b>) in your <b>$HOME/.gitconfig</b> just once and have it affect all
       repositories you touch.

       When the <b>core.untrackedCache</b> configuration variable is changed, the untracked cache is added to or
       removed from the index the next time a command reads the index; while when <b>--</b>[<b>no-</b>|<b>force-</b>]<b>untracked-cache</b>
       are used, the untracked cache is immediately added to or removed from the index.

       Before 2.17, the untracked cache had a bug where replacing a directory with a symlink to another
       directory could cause it to incorrectly show files tracked by git as untracked. See the "status: add a
       failing test showing a core.untrackedCache bug" commit to git.git. A workaround for that is (and this
       might work for other undiscovered bugs in the future):

           $ git -c core.untrackedCache=false status

       This bug has also been shown to affect non-symlink cases of replacing a directory with a file when it
       comes to the internal structures of the untracked cache, but no case has been reported where this
       resulted in wrong "git status" output.

       There are also cases where existing indexes written by git versions before 2.17 will reference
       directories that don’t exist anymore, potentially causing many "could not open directory" warnings to be
       printed on "git status". These are new warnings for existing issues that were previously silently
       discarded.

       As with the bug described above the solution is to one-off do a "git status" run with
       <b>core.untrackedCache=false</b> to flush out the leftover bad data.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>SYSTEM</b> <b>MONITOR</b></h4><pre>
       This feature is intended to speed up git operations for repos that have large working directories.

       It enables git to work together with a file system monitor (see <b><a href="../man1/git-fsmonitor--daemon.1.html">git-fsmonitor--daemon</a></b>(1) and the
       "fsmonitor-watchman" section of <b><a href="../man5/githooks.5.html">githooks</a></b>(5)) that can inform it as to what files have been modified. This
       enables git to avoid having to lstat() every file to find modified files.

       When used in conjunction with the untracked cache, it can further improve performance by avoiding the
       cost of scanning the entire working directory looking for new files.

       If you want to enable (or disable) this feature, it is easier to use the <b>core.fsmonitor</b> configuration
       variable (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)) than using the <b>--fsmonitor</b> option to <b>git</b> <b>update-index</b> in each repository,
       especially if you want to do so across all repositories you use, because you can set the configuration
       variable in your <b>$HOME/.gitconfig</b> just once and have it affect all repositories you touch.

       When the <b>core.fsmonitor</b> configuration variable is changed, the file system monitor is added to or removed
       from the index the next time a command reads the index. When <b>--</b>[<b>no-</b>]<b>fsmonitor</b> are used, the file system
       monitor is immediately added to or removed from the index.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The command honors <b>core.filemode</b> configuration variable. If your repository is on a filesystem whose
       executable bits are unreliable, this should be set to <u>false</u> (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)). This causes the command
       to ignore differences in file modes recorded in the index and the file mode on the filesystem if they
       differ only on executable bit. On such an unfortunate filesystem, you may need to use <u>git</u> <u>update-index</u>
       <u>--chmod=</u>.

       Quite similarly, if <b>core.symlinks</b> configuration variable is set to <u>false</u> (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)), symbolic
       links are checked out as plain files, and this command does not modify a recorded file mode from symbolic
       link to regular file.

       The command looks at <b>core.ignorestat</b> configuration variable. See <u>Using</u> <u>"assume</u> <u>unchanged"</u> <u>bit</u> section
       above.

       The command also looks at <b>core.trustctime</b> configuration variable. It can be useful when the inode change
       time is regularly modified by something outside Git (file system crawlers and backup systems use ctime
       for marking files processed) (see <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1)).

       The untracked cache extension can be enabled by the <b>core.untrackedCache</b> configuration variable (see <b><a href="../man1/gitconfig.1.html">git-</a></b>
       <b><a href="../man1/gitconfig.1.html">config</a></b>(1)).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Users often try to use the assume-unchanged and skip-worktree bits to tell Git to ignore changes to files
       that are tracked. This does not work as expected, since Git may still check working tree files against
       the index when performing certain operations. In general, Git does not provide a way to ignore changes to
       tracked files, so alternate solutions are recommended.

       For example, if the file you want to change is some sort of config file, the repository can include a
       sample config file that can then be copied into the ignored name and modified. The repository can even
       include a script to treat the sample file as a template, modifying and copying it automatically.
