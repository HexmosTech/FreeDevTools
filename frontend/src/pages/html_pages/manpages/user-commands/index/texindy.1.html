</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>texindy</b> is the LaTeX-specific command of xindy, the flexible indexing system. It takes a raw index as
       input, and produces a merged, sorted and tagged index. Merging, sorting, and tagging is controlled by
       xindy modules, with a convenient set already preloaded.

       Files with the raw index are passed as arguments. If no arguments are passed, the raw index will be read
       from standard input.

       A good introductionary description of <b>texindy</b> appears in the indexing chapter of the LaTeX Companion (2nd
       ed.)

       If you want to produce an index for LaTeX documents with special index markup, the command <b><a href="../man1/xindy.1.html">xindy</a></b>(1) is
       probably more of interest for you.

       <b>texindy</b> is an approach to merge support for the <u>make-rules</u> framework, own xindy modules (e.g., for
       special LaTeX commands in the index), and a reasonable level of MakeIndex compatibility.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       "--version" / <b>-V</b>
           output version numbers of all relevant components and exit.

       "--help" / <b>-h</b> / <b>-?</b>
           output usage message with options explanation.

       "--quiet" / <b>-q</b>
           Don't output progress messages. Output only error messages.

       "--verbose" / <b>-v</b>
           Output verbose progress messages.

       "--debug" <u>magic</u> / <b>-d</b> <u>magic</u>
           Output debug messages, this option may be specified multiple times.  <u>magic</u> determines what is output:

            magic          remark
            ------------------------------------------------------------
            script         internal progress messages of driver scripts
            keep_tmpfiles  don't discard temporary files
            markup         output markup trace, as explained in xindy manual
            level=n        log level, n is 0 (default), 1, 2, or 3

       "--out-file" <u>outfile.ind</u> / <b>-o</b> <u>outfile.ind</u>
           Output  index  to  file <u>outfile.ind</u>. If this option is not passed, the name of the output file is the
           base name of the first argument and the file extension <u>ind</u>. If the raw index is  read  from  standard
           input, this option is mandatory.

       "--log-file" <u>log.ilg</u> / <b>-t</b> <u>log.ilg</u>
           Output  log  messages  to file <u>log.ilg</u>. These log messages are independent from the progress messages
           that you can influence with "--debug" or "--verbose".

       "--language" <u>lang</u> / <b>-L</b> <u>lang</u>
           The index is sorted according to the rules of language <u>lang</u>. These  rules  are  encoded  in  a  xindy
           module created by <u>make-rules</u>.

           If  no  input  encoding is specified via "--codepage" or enforced by input markup, a xindy module for
           that language is searched with a latin, a cp, an iso, ascii, or utf8 encoding, in that order.

       "--codepage" <u>enc</u> / <b>-C</b> <u>enc</u>
           There are two different situations and use cases for this option.

           1.  Input markup is "latex" (the default).

               Then <b>texindy</b>'s raw input is assumed to be encoded  in  LaTeX  Internal  Character  Representation
               (LICR).  I.e., non-ASCII characters are encoded as command sequences. This option tells xindy the
               encoding it shall use for letter group headings. (Additionally it  specifies  the  encoding  used
               internally for sorting -- but that doesn't matter for the result.)

               Only  LICR encodings for Latin script alphabets are supported; more precisely characters that are
               in LaTeX latin1, latin2, and latin3 LICR encodings.

               Even when you specify "utf8" as codepage, only these characters will be known.  But  if  you  use
               non-Latin  alphabets,  you  probably  use (or should use) XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX and then you have a
               different input markup.

           2.  Input markup is "xelatex" or "omega".

               Then this option is ignored; codepage "utf8" is enforced.

               <b>texindy</b>'s raw input is assumed to be UTF-8 encoded, LICR is not used.

       "--module" <u>module</u> / <b>-M</b> <u>module</u>
           Load the xindy module <u>module.xdy</u>. This option may  be  specified  multiple  times.  The  modules  are
           searched   in   the   xindy   search   path  that  can  be  changed  with  the  environment  variable
           "XINDY_SEARCHPATH".

       "--input-markup" <u>input</u> / <b>-I</b> <u>input</u>
           Specifies the input markup of the raw index. Supported values for <u>input</u> are "latex",  "xelatex",  and
           "omega".

           "latex"  input  markup is the one that is emitted by default from the LaTeX kernel, or by the "index"
           macro package of David Jones, when used with standard LaTeX or pdfLaTeX. ^^-notation of  single  byte
           characters  is  supported.  Usage  of LaTeX's <u>inputenc</u> package is assumed as well, i.e., raw input is
           encoded in LICR.

           "xelatex" input markup is like "latex", but without <u>inputenc</u> usage. Raw input is  encoded  in  UTF-8.
           LuaLaTeX has the same input markup, there's no special option value for it.

           "omega"  input markup is like "latex" input markup, but with Omega's ^^-notation as encoding for non-
           ASCII characters. LICR encoding is not used then, and "utf8" is  enforced  to  be  the  codepage  for
           sorting and for output of letter group headings.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>LANGUAGES</b> <b>/</b> <b>CODEPAGES</b></h4><pre>
       The following languages are supported:

   <b>Latin</b> <b>scripts</b>
        albanian      gypsy             portuguese
        croatian      hausa             romanian

        german-duden  norwegian         vietnamese
        greek-iso     polish

       German recognizes two different sorting schemes to handle umlauts: normally, "ä" is sorted like "ae", but
       in phone books or dictionaries, it is sorted like "a". The first scheme is known as <u>DIN</u> <u>order</u>, the second
       as <u>Duden</u> <u>order</u>.

       "*-iso" language names assume that the raw index entries are in ISO 8859-9 encoding.

       "gypsy" is a northern Russian dialect.

</pre><h4><b>TEXINDY</b> <b>STANDARD</b> <b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       There is a set of <b>texindy</b> standard modules that help to process LaTeX  index  files.  Some  of  them  are
       automatically  loaded.  Some of them are loaded by default, this can be turned off with a <b>texindy</b> option.
       Others may be specified as "--module" argument to achieve a specific effect.

        xindy Module    Category  Description

   <b>Sorting</b>
        word-order      Default   A space comes before any letter in the
                                  alphabet: ``index style'' is listed before
                                  ``indexing''. Turn it off with option -l.
        letter-order    Add-on    Spaces are ignored: ``index style''
                                  is sorted after ``indexing''.
        keep-blanks     Add-on    Leading and trailing white space (blanks
                                  and tabs) are not ignored; intermediate
                                  white space is not changed.
        ignore-hyphen   Add-on    Hyphens are ignored:
                                  ``ad-hoc'' is sorted as ``adhoc''.
        ignore-punctuation Add-on All kinds of punctuation characters are
                                  ignored: hyphens, periods, commas, slashes,
                                  parentheses, and so on.
        numeric-sort    Auto      Numbers are sorted numerically, not like
                                  characters: ``V64'' appears before ``V128''.

   <b>Page</b> <b>Numbers</b>
        page-ranges     Default   Appearances on more than two consecutive
                                  pages are listed as a range: ``1--4''.
                                  Turn it off with option -r.
        ff-ranges       Add-on    Uses implicit ``ff'' notation for ranges
                                  of three pages, and explicit ranges
                                  thereafter: 2f, 2ff, 2--6.
        ff-ranges-only  Add-on    Uses only implicit ranges: 2f, 2ff.
        book-order      Add-on    Sorts page numbers with common book numbering
                                  scheme correctly -- Roman numerals first, then
                                  Arabic numbers, then others: i, 1, A.

   <b>Markup</b> <b>and</b> <b>Layout</b>
        tex             Auto      Handles basic TeX conventions.
        latex-loc-fmts  Auto      Provides LaTeX formatting commands
                                  for page number encapsulation.
        latex           Auto      Handles LaTeX conventions, both in raw
                                  index entries and output markup; implies
                                  tex.
        makeindex       Auto      Emulates the default MakeIndex input syntax
                                  and quoting behavior.
        latin-lettergroups Auto   Layout contains a single Latin letter
                                  above each group of words starting with the
                                  same letter.
        german-sty      Add-on    Handles umlaut markup of babel's german
                                  and ngerman options.

</pre><h4><b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>TO</b> <b>MAKEINDEX</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xindy</b> does not claim to be  completely  compatible  with  MakeIndex,  that  would  prevent  some  of  its
       enhancements.  That  said,  we  strive  to  deliver as much compatibility as possible. The most important
       incompatibilities are

       •   For raw index entries in LaTeX syntax, "\index{aaa|bbb}" is interpreted  differently.  For  MakeIndex
           "bbb"  is  markup  that  is output as a LaTeX tag for this page number. For <b>xindy</b>, this is a location
           attribute, an abstract identifier that will be later associated with markup that should be output for
           that attribute.

           For straight-forward usage,  when  "bbb"  is  "textbf"  or  similar,  we  supply  location  attribute
           definitions that mimic MakeIndex's behaviour.

           For  more complex usage, when "bbb" is not an identifier, no such compatibility definitions exist and
           may also not been created with current <b>xindy</b>. Such a situation is reported to exist for the  "memoir"
           LaTeX class.

           Programmers  who  know  Common  Lisp  and  Lex and want to work on a remedy should please contact the
           author.

       •   If you have an index rage and a location attribute, e.g., "\index{key\(attr}" starts the  range,  one
           needs (1) to specify that attribute in the range closing entry as well (i.e., as "\index{key\)attr}")
           and (2) one needs to declare the index attribute in an <b>xindy</b> style file.

           MakeIndex  will output the markup "\attr{page1--page2}" for such a construct. This is not possible to
           achieve  in  <b>xindy</b>,  output  will  be  "\attrMarkup{page1}--\attrMarkup{page2}".  (This  is  actually
           considered a bug, but not a high priority one.)

           The difference between MakeIndex page number tags and <b>xindy</b> location attributes was already explained
           in the previous item.

       •   The  MakeIndex  compatibility  definitions  support  only  the  default  raw  index syntax and markup
           definition. It is not possible to configure raw index parsing  or  use  a  MakeIndex  style  file  to
           describe output markup.
