       ra-index - index files for use with remembrance agent software

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ra-index</b> [--version] [-v] [-d] [-s] &lt;base-dir&gt; &lt;source1&gt; [&lt;source2&gt;] [...]  [-e &lt;excludee1&gt; [&lt;excludee2&gt;]
       [...]]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ra-index</b>  and <b>ra-retrieve</b> make up the Savant search engine, an information retrieval engine designed as a
       back-end for the Remembrance Agent (RA).  Given a collection of the user's accumulated email, usenet news
       articles, papers, saved HTML files and other text notes, the RA attempts to find  those  documents  which
       are  most  relevant  to the user's current context.  That is, it searches this collection of text for the
       documents which bear the highest word-for-word similarity to the text the user is currently  editing,  in
       the  hope  that  they  will also bear high conceptual similarity and thus be useful to the user's current
       work.  With the Emacs front-end, these suggestions are continuously displayed in a small  buffer  at  the
       bottom  of the user's window.  If a suggestion looks useful, the full text can be retrieved with a single
       command.

       The Remembrance Agent works in two stages.  First, the user's collection of  text  documents  is  indexed
       into  a  database  saved  in  a  vector  format.   After  the database is created, the other stage of the
       Remembrance Agent is run from emacs, where it periodically takes a sample of text from the working buffer
       and finds those documents from the collection that are most similar.  It summarizes the top documents  in
       a  small  emacs  window  and allows you to retrieve the entire text of any one with a keystroke.  See the
       README file for information on using the Emacs front-end.

       At its core Savant is a text-retrieval search-engine that uses a standard TF/iDF algorithm, but  it  also
       uses  a  template system to recognize different kinds of documents and extract various field information.
       For example, <b>ra-index</b> can recognize subject lines and address information from email files and file  this
       information  separately.   It can also pull apart file archives into separate documents, e.g. RMAIL files
       are indexed as separate email documents.  Finally, there are filters defined for many document  types  to
       remove extraneous information like HTML tags that might otherwise cause problems in retrieval.  These are
       all  precompiled in a template structure.  It is not currently well documented, though if anyone wants to
       play with it is all defined in the source file templates/conftemplates.c.

       The RA is primarily designed as a proactive information provider that continually gives  you  information
       that  might  be  relevant to your current environment, but Savant can also be used as a standard text and
       information retrieval search engine.

   <b>USAGE</b>
       To index, you must have a set of source text-files, and a directory Savant can put database  files  into.
       The  &lt;source&gt;  arguments may be files or directories.  If a directory is in the list, Savant will use all
       its contents, recursing into all subdirectories.  Non-text files and backup files (those appended with  ~
       or  prepended with #) are ignored.  It also ignores dot-files (those starting with .) and symbolic links.
       Any files or directories specified after the optional -e flag will be  excluded.   Savant  will  use  any
       files  it  finds  to  create  a  database in the specified base directory, which must already exist.  The
       optional -v argument (verbose) will direct Savant to keep you updated on its progress.  So for example,

            ra-index -v <a href="file:~/RA-indexes/mail">~/RA-indexes/mail</a> <a href="file:~/RMAIL">~/RMAIL</a> <a href="file:~/Rmail-files">~/Rmail-files</a> -e <a href="file:~/Rmail-files/Old-files">~/Rmail-files/Old-files</a>
       will build a database in the <a href="file:~/RA-indexes/mail">~/RA-indexes/mail</a> directory, made up of emails from my RMAIL file  plus  all
       files and subdirectories of <a href="file:~/Rmail-files">~/Rmail-files</a>, excluding files and directories in <a href="file:~/Rmail-files/Old-files.">~/Rmail-files/Old-files.</a>

       <b>ra-index</b> can build databases in any directory you like, but the emacs interface for the Remembrance Agent
       expects  a  particular structure.  For each database you want to make, you should create a directory, and
       all these directories should live in the same parent directory.  For example, for my own  use  I  have  a
       directory  <a href="file:~/RA-indexes/">~/RA-indexes/</a>,  and  within that are the directories <a href="file:~/RA-indexes/mail/">~/RA-indexes/mail/</a>, <a href="file:~/RA-indexes/papers/">~/RA-indexes/papers/</a>,
       etc. which actually contain the database files.
