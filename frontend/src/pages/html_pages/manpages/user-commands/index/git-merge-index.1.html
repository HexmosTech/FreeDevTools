</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-merge-index - Run a merge for files needing merging

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>git</u> <u>merge-index</u> [-o] [-q] &lt;merge-program&gt; (-a | ( [--] &lt;file&gt;...) )

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This looks up the &lt;file&gt;(s) in the index and, if there are any merge entries, passes the SHA-1 hash for
       those files as arguments 1, 2, 3 (empty argument if no file), and &lt;file&gt; as argument 4. File modes for
       the three files are passed as arguments 5, 6 and 7.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --
           Do not interpret any more arguments as options.

       -a
           Run merge against all files in the index that need merging.

       -o
           Instead of stopping at the first failed merge, do all of them in one shot - continue with merging
           even when previous merges returned errors, and only return the error code after all the merges.

       -q
           Do not complain about a failed merge program (a merge program failure usually indicates conflicts
           during the merge). This is for porcelains which might want to emit custom messages.

       If <u>git</u> <u>merge-index</u> is called with multiple &lt;file&gt;s (or -a) then it processes them in turn only stopping
       if merge returns a non-zero exit code.

       Typically this is run with a script calling Git’s imitation of the <u>merge</u> command from the RCS package.

       A sample script called <u>git</u> <u>merge-one-file</u> is included in the distribution.

       ALERT ALERT ALERT! The Git "merge object order" is different from the RCS <u>merge</u> program merge object
       order. In the above ordering, the original is first. But the argument order to the 3-way merge program
       <u>merge</u> is to have the original in the middle. Don’t ask me why.

       Examples:

           torvalds@ppc970:<a href="file:~/merge-test">~/merge-test</a>&gt; git merge-index cat MM
           This is MM from the original tree.              # original
           This is modified MM in the branch A.            # merge1
           This is modified MM in the branch B.            # merge2
           This is modified MM in the branch B.            # current contents

       or

           torvalds@ppc970:<a href="file:~/merge-test">~/merge-test</a>&gt; git merge-index cat AA MM
           cat: : No such file or directory
           This is added AA in the branch A.
           This is added AA in the branch B.
           This is added AA in the branch B.
           fatal: merge program failed

       where the latter example shows how <u>git</u> <u>merge-index</u> will stop trying to merge once anything has returned
       an error (i.e., <b>cat</b> returned an error for the AA file, because it didn’t exist in the original, and thus
       <u>git</u> <u>merge-index</u> didn’t even try to merge the MM thing).
