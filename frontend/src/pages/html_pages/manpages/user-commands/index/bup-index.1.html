       bup-index - print and/or update the bup filesystem index

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       bup    index    &lt;-p|-m|-s|-u|--clear|--check&gt;   [-H]   [-l]   [-x]   [--fake-valid]   [--no-check-device]
       [--fake-invalid]  [-f  <u>indexfile</u>]  [--exclude  <u>path</u>]  [--exclude-from  <u>filename</u>]  [--exclude-rx  <u>pattern</u>]
       [--exclude-rx-from <u>filename</u>] [-v] &lt;paths...&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       bup  index  manipulates  the  filesystem  index,  which  is  a cache of absolute paths and their metadata
       (attributes, SHA-1 hashes, etc.).  The bup index is similar in function to  the  <a href="../man1/git.1.html">git</a>(1)  index,  and  the
       default index can be found in $BUP_DIR/bupindex.

       Creating  a backup in bup consists of two steps: updating the index with bup index, then actually backing
       up the files (or a subset of the files) with bup save.  The separation exists for these reasons:

       1. There is more than one way to generate a list of files that need to be backed up.   For  example,  you
          might want to use <a href="../man7/inotify.7.html">inotify</a>(7) or <a href="../man7/dnotify.7.html">dnotify</a>(7).

       2. Even if you back up files to multiple destinations (for added redundancy), the file names, attributes,
          and hashes will be the same each time.  Thus, you can save the trouble of repeatedly re-generating the
          list of files for each backup set.

       3. You  may  want  to  use  the  data  tracked by bup index for other purposes (such as speeding up other
          programs that need the same information).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       At the moment, bup will ignore Linux attributes  (cf. <a href="../man1/chattr.1.html">chattr</a>(1)  and  <a href="../man1/lsattr.1.html">lsattr</a>(1))  on  some  systems  (any
       big-endian  systems  where  sizeof(long)  &lt;  sizeof(int)).   This  is  because  the Linux kernel and FUSE
       currently disagree over the type of the attr system call arguments, and so on big-endian systems  there’s
       no  way  to  get  the results without the risk of stack corruption (<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/575846/">http://lwn.net/Articles/575846/</a>).  In
       these situations, bup will  print  a  warning  the  first  time  Linux  attrs  are  relevant  during  any
       index/save/restore operation.

       bup  makes  accommodations  for the expected “worst-case” filesystem timestamp resolution – currently one
       second; examples include VFAT, ext2, ext3, small  ext4,  etc.   Since  bup  cannot  know  the  filesystem
       timestamp  resolution,  and  could  be  traversing  multiple  filesystems during any given run, it always
       assumes that the resolution may be no better than one second.

       As a practical matter, this means  that  index  updates  are  a  bit  imprecise,  and  so  bup  save  may
       occasionally  record  filesystem changes that you didn’t expect.  That’s because, during an index update,
       if bup encounters a path whose actual timestamps are more  recent  than  one  second  before  the  update
       started,  bup  will set the index timestamps for that path (mtime and ctime) to exactly one second before
       the run, – effectively capping those values.

       This ensures that no subsequent changes to those paths can result in timestamps  that  are  identical  to
       those in the index.  If that were possible, bup could overlook the modifications.

       You can see the effect of this behavior in this example (assume that less than one second elapses between
       the initial file creation and first index run):

              $ touch src/1 src/2
              # A "sleep 1" here would avoid the unexpected save.
              $ bup index src
              $ bup save -n src src  # Saves 1 and 2.
              $ date &gt; src/1
              $ bup index src
              $ date &gt; src/2         # Not indexed.
              $ bup save -n src src  # But src/2 is saved anyway.

       Strictly  speaking,  bup  should  not  notice the change to src/2, but it does, due to the accommodations
       described above.

</pre><h4><b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
       -u, --update
              recursively update the index for the given paths and their descendants.  One or more paths must be
              specified, and if a path ends with a symbolic link, the link  itself  will  be  indexed,  not  the
              target.   If  no  mode  option is given, --update is the default, and paths may be excluded by the
              --exclude, --exclude-rx, and --one-file-system options.

       -p, --print
              print the contents of the  index.   If  paths  are  given,  shows  the  given  entries  and  their
              descendants.   If  no paths are given, shows the entries starting at the current working directory
              (.).

       -m, --modified
              prints only files which are marked as modified (ie.  changed since the most recent backup) in  the
              index.  Implies -p.

       -s, --status
              prepend  a  status  code  (A,  M,  D,  or  space)  before each path.  Implies -p.  The codes mean,
              respectively, that a file is marked in the index as added, modified, deleted, or  unchanged  since
              the last backup.

       --check
              carefully  check  index  file  integrity  before  and after updating.  Mostly useful for automated
              tests.

       --clear
              clear the default index.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -H, --hash
              for each file printed, prepend the most recently recorded hash code.  The hash  code  is  normally
              generated  by  bup  save.   For  objects  which have not yet been backed up, the hash code will be
              0000000000000000000000000000000000000000.  Note that the hash code is printed even if the file  is
              known  to  be  modified or deleted in the index (ie.  the file on the filesystem no longer matches
              the recorded hash).  If this is a problem for you, use --status.

       -l, --long
              print more information about each file, in a similar format to the -l option to <a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a>(1).

       -x, --xdev, --one-file-system
              don’t cross filesystem boundaries when traversing the filesystem – though as with tar  and  rsync,
              the mount points themselves will still be indexed.  Only applicable if you’re using -u.

       --fake-valid
              mark  specified  paths  as  up-to-date even if they aren’t.  This can be useful for testing, or to
              avoid unnecessarily backing up files that you know are boring.

       --fake-invalid
              mark specified paths as not up-to-date,  forcing  the  next  “bup  save”  run  to  re-check  their
              contents.

       -f, --indexfile=<u>indexfile</u>
              use a different index filename instead of $BUP_DIR/bupindex.

       --exclude=<u>path</u>
              exclude <u>path</u> from the backup (may be repeated).

       --exclude-from=<u>filename</u>
              read  –exclude  paths from <u>filename</u>, one path per-line (may be repeated).  Ignore completely empty
              lines.

       --exclude-rx=<u>pattern</u>
              exclude   any   path   matching   <u>pattern</u>,   which   must   be   a   Python   regular   expression
              (<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/re.html">http://docs.python.org/library/re.html</a>).   The  pattern  will  be compared against the full path,
              without anchoring, so “x/y” will match “ox/yard” or “box/yards”.  To exclude the contents of <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>,
              but not the directory itself, use “^<a href="file:/tmp/.">/tmp/.</a>”.  (may be repeated)

              Examples:

              • `/foo$' - exclude any file named foo

              • `/foo/$' - exclude any directory named foo

              • `/foo/.' - exclude the content of any directory named foo

              • `^<a href="file:/tmp/.">/tmp/.</a>' - exclude root-level <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>’s content, but not <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> itself

       --exclude-rx-from=<u>filename</u>
              read –exclude-rx  patterns  from  <u>filename</u>,  one  pattern  per-line  (may  be  repeated).   Ignore
              completely empty lines.

       --no-check-device
              don’t  mark  an  entry  invalid if the device number (<a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a>(2) st_dev) changes.  This can be useful
              when indexing remote, automounted, or snapshot filesystems (LVM, Btrfs, etc.),  where  the  device
              number isn’t fixed.

       -v, --verbose
              increase log output during update (can be used more than once).  With one -v, print each directory
              as it is updated; with two -v, print each file too.
