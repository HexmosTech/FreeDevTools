</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       CMST - Connman System Tray

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Usage: cmst [options]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A QT5 based GUI front end for the Connman network daemon

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b,</b> <b>--bypass-restore-state</b>
              If  restore state is specified in the settings file this take precedence over that setting and not
              restore the state when starting.

       <b>-B,</b> <b>--bypass-start-options</b>
              Ignore completely any start options specified in the settings file.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--enable-counters</b> <b>[Experimental]</b>
              Enable the counters. Counters are disabled by default to minimize load on your system.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--disable-tray-icon</b>
              Disable  the  system  tray  icon.   May  be  needed  for  system  trays  not  compliant  with  the
              Freedesktop.org system tray specification.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Displays this help.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--icon-theme</b> <b>&lt;Icon</b> <b>Theme</b> <b>Name&gt;</b>
              Use  a specific icon theme from your system. The Icon Theme name is optional and if specified CMST
              will try to use icons from that theme.  If no name is provided and if a system wide icon theme  is
              defined  (via  your  DE) it will be used.  If the icon theme cannot be found CMST will fallback to
              using internal built in icons.

       <b>-I,</b> <b>--icon-scale</b> <b>&lt;Icon</b> <b>Scale&gt;</b>
              Scale icons and other artwork in CMST.  For High DPI moitors it may  be  necessary  to  specify  a
              scale  factor on icons and other artwork in CMST.  You may override the default using this option.
              For High DPI monitors a factor of 2 has been found to be good. The default  scale  is  1.0.  Valid
              values of scale factor are from 1.0 to 3.0.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--log-input-request</b>
              Log the Connman inputRequest for debugging purposes.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--minimized</b>
              Start the GUI minimized in the system tray.

       <b>-M,</b> <b>--disable-minimize</b>
              Disable  the  minimize  button.   Use  when  you  want  the window manager to have sole control in
              minimizing the interface.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--disable-vpn</b>
              Disable VPN support.  This will disable (grey out) the VPN tab and the VPN  editor  button.   More
              importantly  it  will  also  bypass  setting  up  a DBUS connection to connman-vpn.  If Connman is
              compiled without VPN support this option should be supplied.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Displays version information.

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--wait-time</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;</b>
              Specify the wait time in seconds before starting the system tray icon (default is 0 seconds).   If
              CMST is started and tries to create a tray icon before the system tray itself is created CMST will
              not  be able to start minimized. This sometimes happens when the program is started automatically.
              If you know the tray will exist once the system is up you may specify a wait time  and  CMST  will
              wait  that  number  of  seconds before trying to create the tray icon.  This is to give the window
              manager or panel time to create the tray before we try to place the icon there.  If  you  plan  to
              start  with  the  main dialog shown on screen there is no reason to use this option.  This is only
              intended to be used for starting minimized.

       <b>--counter-update-kb</b> <b>&lt;KB&gt;</b> <b>[Experimental]</b>
              Specify the amount of data in KB that must be transmitted before the counters update  (default  is
              1024  KB).   Connman  will  accept  this entry, but according to a comment in the Connman code the
              actual feature still needs to be implemented.

       <b>--counter-update-rate</b> <b>&lt;seconds&gt;</b> <b>[Experimental]</b>
              Specify the frequency in seconds between counter updates (default is 10 seconds).

       <b>--fake-transparency</b> <b>&lt;RRGGBB&gt;</b>
              On some systems the system tray icon background, which is transparent, will display  as  white  or
              black.   This  seems  to  be  an  issue  between QT, system tray implementations, compositing, and
              perhaps certain graphics cards.  To work around it we've implemented a fake transparency for  tray
              icons.   To  use  it specify the system tray background color with this option.  If the background
              color is provided CMST will convert the tray icon image to have the  specified  background  color.
              Color is a hex number in the format: RRGGBB.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b> <b>STABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Command  line  options  marked  <u>[Experimental]</u>  refer to some option in Connman that is currently flagged
       experimental.  These options should not be assumed to be fixed and  could  change  at  any  time.   Other
       command line options may be assumed to be fixed and should be safe to use in startup scripts.

</pre><h4><b>GUI</b> <b>INFO</b></h4><pre>
       The  GUI  contains  one  main  dialog with separate tab pages.  Program help is mainly provided through a
       "What's This" interface.  The "What's This" button in the lower left  corner  will  allow  you  to  enter
       "What's  This"  mode, click the button and then click the GUI feature, or control that you are interested
       in.  A right mouse click on a GUI feature or control will also enter "What's This" mode.

       <u>Status</u> <u>Tab</u>
              The status tab displays information about the global properties, found technologies, and services.
              Checkbox at the top right will allow you to  put  everything  in  "offline"  mode.   To  toggle  a
              technology on or off click the entry under the Powered column

       <u>Details</u> <u>Tab</u>
              The details tab will display detailed setup and connection information about a service. Select the
              service you wish to investigate in the combo box at the top.

       <u>Wireless</u> <u>Tab</u>
              The  Wireless  tab  will  display information, connect, disconnect, and edit certain properties of
              wireless services.

       <u>VPN</u> <u>Tab</u>
              The VNP tab will display information, connect and disconnect already provisioned VPN services.

       <u>Counters</u> <u>Tab</u>
              The Counters tab will display information about the Connect time, the Transmit (TX) and  Receiving
              (RX)  counters  for  the  service  currently in the "online" state. The counters are set to fairly
              course intervals to minimize system usage. Currently these interval settings are hard  coded  into
              the program.

       <u>Preferences</u> <u>Tab</u>
              The preferences tab will allow you to change some aspects of the GUI.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       For  typical  networks and access points, even hidden ones, Connman will find and automatically configure
       the network for you.  If Connman needs information, for instance a passphrase, CMST  registers  an  agent
       and  this  agent  will  prompt you for the needed information.  For most cases this "just works", however
       there are options for fine tuning the automatic configuration or creating provisioning files.

       <b>Profile</b> <b>Editor</b>
              There are a variety of connection settings that may be used to override  the  automatic  settings.
              An  editor  is  provided  to access these settings via the <b>Configuration</b> button in the lower right
              corner of the <u>Details</u> tab.  One common use is to define a static IP address  for  the  connection.
              Hidden or provisioned (see below) services cannot be edited.

       <b>802.1x</b> <b>Encrypted</b> <b>Networks</b> <b>(Eduroam</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar)</b>
              Certain  types  encrypted  networks  require a config (provisioning) file to be created before you
              first connect.  As of 2014.10.30 CMST has a provisioning editor built in, but it is considered  an
              advanced  control  and by default it is hidden.  To enable the control check the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Controls</b>
              box on the <u>Provisioning</u> tab.  The button to open the editor will appear in the lower  left  corner
              of  the  dialog.   With  this  editor  you may create, open, edit, delete and save config files to
              /var/lib/connman.  The menu at the top may be used to enter some  information  automatically,  and
              many  of  the  input  fields are validated as you enter text into them.  There are also predefined
              template files that may be used to seed the editing area.  All of this can be bypassed if you wish
              and you may cut and paste or type into the editor directly.

       <b>Creating</b> <b>and</b> <b>Editing</b> <b>VPN</b> <b>Connections</b>
              As of 2016.01.26 CMST has a VPN provisioning editor built in, but it  is  considered  an  advanced
              control and by default it is hidden.  To enable the control check the <b>Advanced</b> <b>Controls</b> box on the
              <u>Provisioning</u>  tab.   The  button  to  open  the editor will appear in the lower left corner of the
              dialog.  With  this  editor  you  may  create,  open,  edit,  delete  and  save  config  files  to
              /var/lib/connman-vpn.   The  menu  at the top may be used to enter some information automatically,
              and many of the input fields are validated as you enter text into them. The first item under  each
              menu  heading  (Provider  xxx)  will  start  a  junior wizard to walk you through entering all the
              mandatory information for each  connection  type.   For  OpenVPN  the  second  menu  item  (Import
              Configuration)  will  import  an  OpenVPN  .opvn  file.  The import will extract and save keys and
              certificates and will place the proper provisioning entries into the editor window.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       For the tray icon to display is it required that the system tray be compliant  with  the  Freedesktop.org
       systemtray specification.

       The tray icon is known to not work in the DWM system tray which appears to be a noncompliant tray.
