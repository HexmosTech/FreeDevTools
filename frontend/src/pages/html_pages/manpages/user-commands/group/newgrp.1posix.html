</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       newgrp — change to a new group

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       newgrp <b>[</b>-l<b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>group</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>newgrp</u>  utility  shall  create a new shell execution environment with a new real and effective group
       identification. Of the attributes listed in <u>Section</u> <u>2.12</u>, <u>Shell</u>  <u>Execution</u>  <u>Environment</u>,  the  new  shell
       execution environment shall retain the working directory, file creation mask, and exported variables from
       the  previous  environment  (that  is,  open files, traps, unexported variables, alias definitions, shell
       functions, and <u>set</u> options may be lost). All other aspects of the process environment that are  preserved
       by  the  <u>exec</u>  family  of functions defined in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 shall also be
       preserved by <u>newgrp</u>; whether other aspects are preserved is unspecified.

       A failure to assign the new group identifications (for example, for security or password-related reasons)
       shall not prevent the new shell execution environment from being created.

       The <u>newgrp</u> utility shall affect the supplemental groups for the process as follows:

        *  On systems where the effective group ID is normally in the supplementary group list (or whenever  the
           old effective group ID actually is in the supplementary group list):

           --  If  the  new  effective group ID is also in the supplementary group list, <u>newgrp</u> shall change the
               effective group ID.

           --  If the new effective group ID is not in the supplementary group list, <u>newgrp</u> shall  add  the  new
               effective group ID to the list, if there is room to add it.

        *  On  systems where the effective group ID is not normally in the supplementary group list (or whenever
           the old effective group ID is not in the supplementary group list):

           --  If the new effective group ID is in the supplementary group list, <u>newgrp</u> shall delete it.

           --  If the old effective group ID is not in the supplementary list, <u>newgrp</u> shall add it if  there  is
               room.

       <b>Note:</b>     The System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify whether the effective group ID of
                 a process is included in its supplementary group list.

       With  no  operands,  <u>newgrp</u>  shall change the effective group back to the groups identified in the user's
       user entry, and shall set the list of supplementary groups to that  set  in  the  user's  group  database
       entries.

       If the first argument is <b>'-'</b>, the results are unspecified.

       If  a  password is required for the specified group, and the user is not listed as a member of that group
       in the group database, the user shall be prompted to enter the correct password for that  group.  If  the
       user is listed as a member of that group, no password shall be requested.  If no password is required for
       the  specified  group, it is implementation-defined whether users not listed as members of that group can
       change to that group. Whether or not a password is required, implementation-defined system accounting  or
       security  mechanisms  may  impose  additional authorization restrictions that may cause <u>newgrp</u> to write a
       diagnostic message and suppress the changing of the group identification.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>newgrp</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>, except for the unspecified usage of <b>'-'</b>.

       The following option shall be supported:

       <b>-l</b>        (The  letter ell.) Change the environment to what would be expected if the user actually logged
                 in again.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operand shall be supported:

       <u>group</u>     A group name from the group database or a non-negative numeric group ID. Specifies the group ID
                 to which the real and effective group IDs shall be set. If  <u>group</u>  is  a  non-negative  numeric
                 string  and exists in the group database as a group name (see <u>getgrnam</u>()), the numeric group ID
                 associated with that group name shall be used as the group ID.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The file <b>/dev/tty</b> shall be used to read a single  line  of  text  for  password  checking,  when  one  is
       required.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>newgrp</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used for diagnostic messages and a prompt string for a password,  if  one  is
       required.  Diagnostic  messages  may  be written in cases where the exit status is not available. See the
       EXIT STATUS section.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       If <u>newgrp</u> succeeds in creating a new shell execution environment, whether or not the group identification
       was changed successfully, the exit status shall be the exit status of the shell. Otherwise, the following
       exit value shall be returned:

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The invoking shell may terminate.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       There is no convenient way to enter a password into the group database. Use of  group  passwords  is  not
       encouraged,  because  by  their  very  nature they encourage poor security practices. Group passwords may
       disappear in the future.

       A common implementation of <u>newgrp</u> is that the current shell uses <u>exec</u>  to  overlay  itself  with  <u>newgrp</u>,
       which  in  turn overlays itself with a new shell after changing group.  On some implementations, however,
       this may not occur and <u>newgrp</u> may be invoked as a subprocess.

       The <u>newgrp</u> command is intended only for use from an interactive terminal. It  does  not  offer  a  useful
       interface for the support of applications.

       The  exit  status  of  <u>newgrp</u>  is generally inapplicable. If <u>newgrp</u> is used in a script, in most cases it
       successfully invokes a new shell and the rest of the original shell script is bypassed when the new shell
       exits. Used interactively, <u>newgrp</u> displays diagnostic messages to indicate problems. But usage such as:

           newgrp foo
           echo $?

       is not useful because the new shell might not have access to any status <u>newgrp</u> may  have  generated  (and
       most  historical  systems  do  not  provide  this status). A zero status echoed here does not necessarily
       indicate that the user has changed to the new group successfully. Following <u>newgrp</u> with  the  <u>id</u>  command
       provides a portable means of determining whether the group change was successful or not.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Most  historical  implementations  use  one  of  the  <u>exec</u> functions to implement the behavior of <u>newgrp</u>.
       Errors detected before the <u>exec</u> leave the environment unchanged, while errors  detected  after  the  <u>exec</u>
       leave  the  user  in  a  changed  environment. While it would be useful to have <u>newgrp</u> issue a diagnostic
       message to tell the user that the environment changed, it would be inappropriate to require  this  change
       to some historical implementations.

       The  password  mechanism  is  allowed  in  the  group  database, but how this would be implemented is not
       specified.

       The <u>newgrp</u> utility was retained in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, even given the existence of the  multiple
       group permissions feature in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017, for several reasons. First, in
       some  implementations,  the  group  ownership  of  a newly created file is determined by the group of the
       directory in which the file is created, as allowed by the System Interfaces volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017;  on
       other  implementations,  the group ownership of a newly created file is determined by the effective group
       ID. On implementations of the latter type, <u>newgrp</u> allows files  to  be  created  with  a  specific  group
       ownership. Finally, many implementations use the real group ID in accounting, and on such systems, <u>newgrp</u>
       allows the accounting identity of the user to be changed.
