</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       userdbctl - Inspect users, groups and group memberships

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>userdbctl</b> [OPTIONS...] {COMMAND} [NAME...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>userdbctl</b> may be used to inspect user and groups (as well as group memberships) of the system. This
       client utility inquires user/group information provided by various system services, both operating on
       JSON user/group records (as defined by the <b>JSON</b> <b>User</b> <b>Records</b>[1] and <b>JSON</b> <b>Group</b> <b>Records</b>[2] definitions),
       and classic UNIX NSS/glibc user and group records. This tool is primarily a client to the <b>User/Group</b>
       <b>Record</b> <b>Lookup</b> <b>API</b> <b>via</b> <b>Varlink</b>[3], and may also pick up drop-in JSON user and group records from
       /etc/userdb/, /run/userdb/, /run/host/userdb/, /usr/lib/userdb/.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are understood:

       <b>--output=</b><u>MODE</u>
           Choose the output mode, takes one of "classic", "friendly", "table", "json". If "classic", an output
           very close to the format of <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> or <a href="file:/etc/group">/etc/group</a> is generated. If "friendly" a more
           comprehensive and user friendly, human readable output is generated; if "table" a minimal, tabular
           output is generated; if "json" a JSON formatted output is generated. Defaults to "friendly" if a
           user/group is specified on the command line, "table" otherwise.

           Note that most output formats do not show all available information. In particular, "classic" and
           "table" show only the most important fields. Various modes also do not show password hashes. Use
           "json" to view all fields, including any authentication fields.

           Added in version 245.

       <b>--json=</b><u>FORMAT</u>
           Selects JSON output mode (like <b>--output=json</b>) and selects the precise display mode. Takes one of
           "pretty" or "short". If "pretty", human-friendly whitespace and newlines are inserted in the output
           to make the JSON data more readable. If "short", all superfluous whitespace is suppressed.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--service=</b><u>SERVICE</u><b>[:</b><u>SERVICE...</u>], <b>-s</b> <u>SERVICE</u>:<u>SERVICE...</u>
           Controls which services to query for users/groups. Takes a list of one or more service names,
           separated by ":". See below for a list of well-known service names. If not specified all available
           services are queried at once.

           Added in version 245.

       <b>--with-nss=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           Controls whether to include classic glibc/NSS user/group lookups in the output. If <b>--with-nss=no</b> is
           used any attempts to resolve or enumerate users/groups provided only via glibc NSS is suppressed. If
           <b>--with-nss=yes</b> is specified such users/groups are included in the output (which is the default).

           Added in version 245.

       <b>--with-varlink=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           Controls whether to include Varlink user/group lookups in the output, i.e. those done via the
           <b>User/Group</b> <b>Record</b> <b>Lookup</b> <b>API</b> <b>via</b> <b>Varlink</b>[3]. If <b>--with-varlink=no</b> is used any attempts to resolve or
           enumerate users/groups provided only via Varlink are suppressed. If <b>--with-varlink=yes</b> is specified
           such users/groups are included in the output (which is the default).

           Added in version 249.

       <b>--with-dropin=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           Controls whether to include user/group lookups in the output that are defined using drop-in files in
           /etc/userdb/, /run/userdb/, /run/host/userdb/, /usr/lib/userdb/. If <b>--with-dropin=no</b> is used these
           records are suppressed. If <b>--with-dropin=yes</b> is specified such users/groups are included in the
           output (which is the default).

           Added in version 249.

       <b>--synthesize=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           Controls whether to synthesize records for the root and nobody users/groups if they aren't defined
           otherwise. By default (or "yes") such records are implicitly synthesized if otherwise missing since
           they have special significance to the OS. When "no" this synthesizing is turned off.

           Added in version 245.

       <b>-N</b>
           This option is short for <b>--with-nss=no</b> <b>--synthesize=no</b>. Use this option to show only records that are
           natively defined as JSON user or group records, with all NSS/glibc compatibility and all implicit
           synthesis turned off.

           Added in version 245.

       <b>--multiplexer=</b><u>BOOL</u>
           Controls whether to do lookups via the multiplexer service (if specified as true, the default) or do
           lookups in the client (if specified as false). Using the multiplexer service is typically preferable,
           since it runs in a locked down sandbox.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--chain</b>
           When used with the <b>ssh-authorized-keys</b> command, this will allow passing an additional command line
           after the user name that is chain executed after the lookup completed. This allows chaining multiple
           tools that show SSH authorized keys.

           Added in version 250.

       <b>--fuzzy</b>, <b>-z</b>
           When used with the <b>user</b> or <b>group</b> command, do a fuzzy string search. Any specified arguments will be
           matched against the user name, the real name of the user record, the email address, and other
           descriptive strings of the user or group record. Moreover, instead of precise matching, a substring
           match or a match allowing slight deviations in spelling is applied.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>--disposition=</b>
           When used with the <b>user</b> or <b>group</b> command, filters by disposition of the record. Takes one of
           "intrinsic", "system", "regular", "dynamic", "container". May be used multiple times, in which case
           only users matching any of the specified dispositions are shown.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>-S</b>, <b>-R</b>
           Shortcuts for <b>--disposition=intrinsic</b>, <b>--disposition=system</b>, <b>--disposition=regular</b>, respectively.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>--uid-min=</b>, <b>--uid-max=</b>
           When used with the <b>user</b> or <b>group</b> command, filters the output by UID/GID ranges. Takes numeric minimum
           resp. maximum UID/GID values. Shows only records within the specified range. When applied to the <b>user</b>
           command matches against UIDs, when applied to the <b>group</b> command against GIDs (despite the name of the
           switch). If unspecified defaults to 0 (for the minimum) and 4294967294 (for the maximum), i.e. by
           default no filtering is applied as the whole UID/GID range is covered.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>--boundaries=</b>
           When used with the <b>user</b> or <b>group</b> command, controls whether to show relevant UID/GID range boundary
           information in the tabular output. Takes a boolean. Defaults to true.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>-B</b>
           Shortcut for <b>--boundaries=no</b>.

           Added in version 257.

       <b>--no-pager</b>
           Do not pipe output into a pager.

       <b>--no-legend</b>
           Do not print the legend, i.e. column headers and the footer with hints.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
           Print a short help text and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
           Print a short version string and exit.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following commands are understood:

       <b>user</b> [<u>USER</u>...]
           List all known users records or show details of one or more specified user records. Use <b>--output=</b> to
           tweak output mode.

           Added in version 245.

       <b>group</b> [<u>GROUP</u>...]
           List all known group records or show details of one or more specified group records. Use <b>--output=</b> to
           tweak output mode.

           Added in version 245.

       <b>users-in-group</b> [<u>GROUP</u>...]
           List users that are members of the specified groups. If no groups are specified list all user/group
           memberships defined. Use <b>--output=</b> to tweak output mode.

           Added in version 245.

       <b>groups-of-user</b> [<u>USER</u>...]
           List groups that the specified users are members of. If no users are specified list all user/group
           memberships defined (in this case <b>groups-of-user</b> and <b>users-in-group</b> are equivalent). Use <b>--output=</b> to
           tweak output mode.

           Added in version 245.

       <b>services</b>
           List all services currently providing user/group definitions to the system. See below for a list of
           well-known services providing user information.

           Added in version 245.

       <b>ssh-authorized-keys</b>
           Show SSH authorized keys for this account. This command is intended to be used to allow the SSH
           daemon to pick up authorized keys from user records, see below.

           Added in version 245.

</pre><h4><b>WELL-KNOWN</b> <b>SERVICES</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>userdbctl</b> <b>services</b> command will list all currently running services that provide user or group
       definitions to the system. The following well-known services are shown among this list:

       <b>io.systemd.DynamicUser</b>
           This service is provided by the system service manager itself (i.e. PID 1) and makes all users (and
           their groups) synthesized through the <u>DynamicUser=</u> setting in service unit files available to the
           system (see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5) for details about this setting).

           Added in version 245.

       <b>io.systemd.Home</b>
           This service is provided by <b><a href="../man8/systemd-homed.service.8.html">systemd-homed.service</a></b>(8) and makes all users (and their groups) belonging
           to home directories managed by that service available to the system.

           Added in version 245.

       <b>io.systemd.Machine</b>
           This service is provided by <b><a href="../man8/systemd-machined.service.8.html">systemd-machined.service</a></b>(8) and synthesizes records for all users/groups
           used by a container that employs user namespacing.

           Added in version 246.

       <b>io.systemd.Multiplexer</b>
           This service is provided by <b><a href="../man8/systemd-userdbd.service.8.html">systemd-userdbd.service</a></b>(8) and multiplexes user/group look-ups to all
           other running lookup services. This is the primary entry point for user/group record clients, as it
           simplifies client side implementation substantially since they can ask a single service for lookups
           instead of asking all running services in parallel.  <b>userdbctl</b> uses this service preferably, too,
           unless <b>--with-nss=</b> or <b>--service=</b> are used, in which case finer control over the services to talk to
           is required.

           Added in version 245.

       <b>io.systemd.NameServiceSwitch</b>
           This service is (also) provided by <b><a href="../man8/systemd-userdbd.service.8.html">systemd-userdbd.service</a></b>(8) and converts classic NSS/glibc user and
           group records to JSON user/group records, providing full backwards compatibility. Use <b>--with-nss=no</b>
           to disable this compatibility, see above. Note that compatibility is actually provided in both
           directions: <b><a href="../man8/nss-systemd.8.html">nss-systemd</a></b>(8) will automatically synthesize classic NSS/glibc user/group records from
           all JSON user/group records provided to the system, thus using both APIs is mostly equivalent and
           provides access to the same data, however the NSS/glibc APIs necessarily expose a more reduced set of
           fields only.

           Added in version 245.

       <b>io.systemd.DropIn</b>
           This service is (also) provided by <b><a href="../man8/systemd-userdbd.service.8.html">systemd-userdbd.service</a></b>(8) and picks up JSON user/group records
           from /etc/userdb/, /run/userdb/, /run/host/userdb/, /usr/lib/userdb/.

           Added in version 249.

       Note that <b>userdbctl</b> has internal support for NSS-based lookups too. This means that if neither
       <b>io.systemd.Multiplexer</b> nor <b>io.systemd.NameServiceSwitch</b> are running look-ups into the basic user/group
       databases will still work.

</pre><h4><b>INTEGRATION</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>SSH</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>userdbctl</b> tool may be used to make the list of SSH authorized keys possibly contained in a user
       record available to the SSH daemon for authentication. For that configure the following in
       <b><a href="../man5/sshd_config.5.html">sshd_config</a></b>(5):

           ...
           AuthorizedKeysCommand /usr/bin/userdbctl ssh-authorized-keys %u
           AuthorizedKeysCommandUser root
           ...

       Sometimes it's useful to allow chain invocation of another program to list SSH authorized keys. By using
       the <b>--chain</b> such a tool may be chain executed by <b>userdbctl</b> <b>ssh-authorized-keys</b> once a lookup completes
       (regardless if an SSH key was found or not). Example:

           ...
           AuthorizedKeysCommand /usr/bin/userdbctl ssh-authorized-keys %u --chain /usr/bin/othertool %u
           AuthorizedKeysCommandUser root
           ...

       The above will first query the userdb database for SSH keys, and then chain execute <b>/usr/bin/othertool</b> to
       also be queried.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL</u>
           The maximum log level of emitted messages (messages with a higher log level, i.e. less important
           ones, will be suppressed). Takes a comma-separated list of values. A value may be either one of (in
           order of decreasing importance) <b>emerg</b>, <b>alert</b>, <b>crit</b>, <b>err</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>debug</b>, or an integer
           in the range 0...7. See <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3) for more information. Each value may optionally be prefixed with
           one of <b>console</b>, <b>syslog</b>, <b>kmsg</b> or <b>journal</b> followed by a colon to set the maximum log level for that
           specific log target (e.g.  <b>SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug,console:info</b> specifies to log at debug level
           except when logging to the console which should be at info level). Note that the global maximum log
           level takes priority over any per target maximum log levels.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_COLOR</u>
           A boolean. If true, messages written to the tty will be colored according to priority.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the terminal, because <b><a href="../man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl</a></b>(1)
           and other tools that display logs will color messages based on the log level on their own.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TIME</u>
           A boolean. If true, console log messages will be prefixed with a timestamp.

           This setting is only useful when messages are written directly to the terminal or a file, because
           <b><a href="../man1/journalctl.1.html">journalctl</a></b>(1) and other tools that display logs will attach timestamps based on the entry metadata on
           their own.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_LOCATION</u>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with a filename and line number in the source code
           where the message originates.

           Note that the log location is often attached as metadata to journal entries anyway. Including it
           directly in the message text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TID</u>
           A boolean. If true, messages will be prefixed with the current numerical thread ID (TID).

           Note that the this information is attached as metadata to journal entries anyway. Including it
           directly in the message text can nevertheless be convenient when debugging programs.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_TARGET</u>
           The destination for log messages. One of <b>console</b> (log to the attached tty), <b>console-prefixed</b> (log to
           the attached tty but with prefixes encoding the log level and "facility", see <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></b>(3), <b>kmsg</b> (log to
           the kernel circular log buffer), <b>journal</b> (log to the journal), <b>journal-or-kmsg</b> (log to the journal if
           available, and to kmsg otherwise), <b>auto</b> (determine the appropriate log target automatically, the
           default), <b>null</b> (disable log output).

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LOG_RATELIMIT_KMSG</u>
           Whether to ratelimit kmsg or not. Takes a boolean. Defaults to "true". If disabled, systemd will not
           ratelimit messages written to kmsg.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u>
           Pager to use when <b>--no-pager</b> is not given; overrides <u>$PAGER</u>. If neither <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u> nor <u>$PAGER</u> are
           set, a set of well-known pager implementations are tried in turn, including <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/more.1.html">more</a></b>(1),
           until one is found. If no pager implementation is discovered no pager is invoked. Setting this
           environment variable to an empty string or the value "cat" is equivalent to passing <b>--no-pager</b>.

           Note: if <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> is not set, <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u> (as well as <u>$PAGER</u>) will be silently
           ignored.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LESS</u>
           Override the options passed to <b>less</b> (by default "FRSXMK").

           Users might want to change two options in particular:

           <b>K</b>
               This option instructs the pager to exit immediately when Ctrl+C is pressed. To allow <b>less</b> to
               handle Ctrl+C itself to switch back to the pager command prompt, unset this option.

               If the value of <u>$SYSTEMD_LESS</u> does not include "K", and the pager that is invoked is <b>less</b>, Ctrl+C
               will be ignored by the executable, and needs to be handled by the pager.

           <b>X</b>
               This option instructs the pager to not send termcap initialization and deinitialization strings
               to the terminal. It is set by default to allow command output to remain visible in the terminal
               even after the pager exits. Nevertheless, this prevents some pager functionality from working, in
               particular paged output cannot be scrolled with the mouse.

           Note that setting the regular <u>$LESS</u> environment variable has no effect for <b>less</b> invocations by
           systemd tools.

           See <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) for more discussion.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_LESSCHARSET</u>
           Override the charset passed to <b>less</b> (by default "utf-8", if the invoking terminal is determined to be
           UTF-8 compatible).

           Note that setting the regular <u>$LESSCHARSET</u> environment variable has no effect for <b>less</b> invocations by
           systemd tools.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, the "secure" mode of the pager is enabled; if false, disabled.
           If <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> is not set at all, secure mode is enabled if the effective UID is not the
           same as the owner of the login session, see <b><a href="../man2/geteuid.2.html">geteuid</a></b>(2) and <b><a href="../man3/sd_pid_get_owner_uid.3.html">sd_pid_get_owner_uid</a></b>(3). In secure mode,
           <b>LESSSECURE=1</b> will be set when invoking the pager, and the pager shall disable commands that open or
           create new files or start new subprocesses. When <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> is not set at all, pagers which
           are not known to implement secure mode will not be used. (Currently only <b><a href="../man1/less.1.html">less</a></b>(1) implements secure
           mode.)

           Note: when commands are invoked with elevated privileges, for example under <b><a href="../man8/sudo.8.html">sudo</a></b>(8) or <b><a href="../man1/pkexec.1.html">pkexec</a></b>(1),
           care must be taken to ensure that unintended interactive features are not enabled. "Secure" mode for
           the pager may be enabled automatically as describe above. Setting <u>SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE=0</u> or not
           removing it from the inherited environment allows the user to invoke arbitrary commands. Note that if
           the <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGER</u> or <u>$PAGER</u> variables are to be honoured, <u>$SYSTEMD_PAGERSECURE</u> must be set too. It
           might be reasonable to completely disable the pager using <b>--no-pager</b> instead.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_COLORS</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. When true, <b>systemd</b> and related utilities will use colors in their output,
           otherwise the output will be monochrome. Additionally, the variable can take one of the following
           special values: "16", "256" to restrict the use of colors to the base 16 or 256 ANSI colors,
           respectively. This can be specified to override the automatic decision based on <u>$TERM</u> and what the
           console is connected to.

       <u>$SYSTEMD_URLIFY</u>
           The value must be a boolean. Controls whether clickable links should be generated in the output for
           terminal emulators supporting this. This can be specified to override the decision that <b>systemd</b> makes
           based on <u>$TERM</u> and other conditions.
