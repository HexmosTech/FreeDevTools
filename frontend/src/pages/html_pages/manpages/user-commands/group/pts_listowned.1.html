       pts_listowned - Show the Protection Database groups owned by a user or group

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pts</b> <b>listowned</b> <b>-nameorid</b> &lt;<u>user</u> <u>or</u> <u>group</u> <u>name</u> <u>or</u> <u>id</u>&gt;+
           [-cell &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;] [<b>-noauth</b>] [<b>-localauth</b>] [<b>-force</b>] [<b>-help</b>]
           [<b>-auth</b>] [<b>-encrypt</b>] [<b>-config</b> &lt;<u>config</u> <u>directory</u>&gt;]

       <b>pts</b> <b>listo</b> <b>-na</b> &lt;<u>user</u> <u>or</u> <u>group</u> <u>name</u> <u>or</u> <u>id</u>&gt;+
           [-c &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;] [<b>-no</b>] [<b>-l</b>] [<b>-f</b>] [<b>-h</b>]
           [<b>-a</b>] [<b>-e</b>] [<b>-co</b> &lt;<u>config</u> <u>directory</u>&gt;]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>pts</b> <b>listowned</b> command lists the groups owned by each user or group specified by the <b>-nameorid</b>
       argument.

       To list any <u>orphaned</u> <u>group</u>s, whose owners have themselves been deleted from the Protection Database,
       provide a value of 0 (zero) for the <b>-nameorid</b> argument. To change the owner to a user or group that still
       exists, use the <b>pts</b> <b>chown</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-nameorid</b> &lt;<u>user</u> <u>or</u> <u>group</u> <u>name</u> <u>or</u> <u>id</u>&gt;+
           Specifies  the  name  or  AFS  UID  of  each user, or the name or AFS GID of each group, for which to
           display the list of owned groups. It is acceptable to mix users and groups on the same command  line,
           as  well  as  names  and  IDs.  Precede  the  GID  of each group with a hyphen to indicate that it is
           negative.

           A value of 0 (zero) lists group entries for groups  whose  owners  no  longer  have  entries  in  the
           Protection Database.

       <b>-auth</b>
           Use  the  calling  user's  tokens  to  communicate  with the Protection Server. For more details, see
           <b><a href="../man1/pts.1.html">pts</a></b>(1).

       <b>-cell</b> &lt;<u>cell</u> <u>name</u>&gt;
           Names the cell in which to run the command. For more details, see <b><a href="../man1/pts.1.html">pts</a></b>(1).

       <b>-config</b> &lt;<u>config</u> <u>directory</u>&gt;
           Use an alternate config directory. For more details, see <b><a href="../man1/pts.1.html">pts</a></b>(1).

       <b>-encrypt</b>
           Encrypts any communication with the Protection Server. For more details, see <b><a href="../man1/pts.1.html">pts</a></b>(1).

       <b>-force</b>
           Enables the command to continue executing as far as possible when errors  or  other  problems  occur,
           rather than halting execution at the first error.

       <b>-help</b>
           Prints the online help for this command. All other valid options are ignored.

       <b>-localauth</b>
           Constructs  a  server  ticket  using  a  key  from the local <u>/etc/openafs/server/KeyFile</u> file. Do not
           combine this flag with the <b>-cell</b> or <b>-noauth</b> options. For more details, see <b><a href="../man1/pts.1.html">pts</a></b>(1).

       <b>-noauth</b>
           Assigns the unprivileged identity anonymous to the issuer. For more details, see <b><a href="../man1/pts.1.html">pts</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The first line of the output indicates the name and AFS UID or AFS GID of each user or  group  for  which
       ownership information is requested, in the following format:

          Groups owned by &lt;name&gt; (id: &lt;ID&gt;) are:

       A  list  of groups follows. The list does not include groups owned by groups that the user or group owns,
       or to which the user or group belongs. If the user or group does not own any groups, only the header line
       appears.

       The following error message appears if the issuer is not privileged to  view  ownership  information.  By
       default,  for  both user and group entries the second privacy flag is the hyphen, which denies permission
       to anyone other than the user (for a user entry) and the members of the system:administrators group.

          pts: Permission denied so failed to get owner list for &lt;name&gt; (id: &lt;ID&gt;)

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following example lists the groups owned by user terry and shows that the group "terry:friends"  does
       not own any groups:

          % pts listowned terry terry:friends
          Groups owned by terry (id: 1045) are:
            terry:friends
            terry:project1
            terry:project2
          Groups owned by terry:friends (id: -673) are:

</pre><h4><b>PRIVILEGE</b> <b>REQUIRED</b></h4><pre>
       The required privilege depends on the setting of the second privacy flag in the Protection Database entry
       of  each  user  or  group indicated by the <b>-nameorid</b> argument (use the <b>pts</b> <b>examine</b> command to display the
       flags):

       •   If it is the hyphen  and  the  <b>-nameorid</b>  argument  specifies  a  group,  only  the  members  of  the
           system:administrators group and the owner of a group can list the groups it owns.

       •   If  it  is  the  hyphen  and  the  <b>-nameorid</b>  argument  specifies  a  user,  only  the members of the
           system:administrators group and the associated user can list the groups he or she owns.

       •   If it is uppercase letter "O", anyone who can access the cell's database server machines can list the
           groups owned by this user or group.
