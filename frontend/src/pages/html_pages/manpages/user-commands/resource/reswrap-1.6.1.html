</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       reswrap - wrap icon resources into C code

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>reswrap</b> [<b>options</b>] [<b>-o</b>[<b>a</b>] <u>outfile</u>] <u>files...</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Reswrap</b>  is  a  tool  to  turn  images, text, and other resource files into C++ data arrays.  This allows
       various binary resources to be embedded in the source code, and compiled into an application.

       In development of graphical applications with FOX, it is used to embed icons  and  images  for  the  user
       interface into the executable and eliminate the need to distribute separate icon and image files.

       <b>Reswrap</b>  is  typically  invoked  as  a  part  of  the  build  process to generate C++ source files from a
       collection of icons and images and other binary resources.

       By default reswrap will interpret the <u>files</u> listed as a stream  of  raw  bytes  and  output  them  as  an
       initialized data array to stdout.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-o</b>[<b>a</b>] <u>outfile</u>
              Write  the  result into the file <u>outfile</u> instead of writing to stdout. With <b>-o</b> the <u>outfile</u> will be
              overwritten with the data from the input.  With the <b>-oa</b> option, the resulting code is appended  to
              the <u>output</u> file, allowing multiple input files to be placed into one single source file.

       <b>-h</b>     Print a short usage message.

       <b>-v</b>     Just print out the version number and license information.

       <b>-d</b>     Write data as decimal numbers instead of using the default hexadecimal numbers.

       <b>-m</b>     Read  files with MS-DOS mode (default is binary).  This replaces "\r\n" with "\n" when reading the
              resource file.

       <b>-x</b>     Write data as hexadecimal numbers (default).

       <b>-t</b>[<b>a</b>]  Write data as a text string, with each byte represented as a hexadecimal excape  sequence,  as  in
              "\x33".

              Note  that the C++ compiler appends a nul-character at the end of the text string, thus making the
              data array one character longer than the file.

              With the <b>a</b> option, printable ascii characters are passed unescaped, while special characters  like
              tabs and newlines are given the usual escape codes.

       <b>-e</b>     Places the storage modifier <u>extern</u> in front of the data array, ensuring that the data array can be
              linked  with  other  compilation  units.  Normally, constant declarations are not visible in other
              compilation units.

       <b>-i</b>     Instead of generating an array definition only write a declaration, which can  be  included  as  a
              header file.

       <b>-k</b>     This  option causes reswrap to keep the file extension, replacing the "."  with an underscore "_".
              Usage of this option is recommended as it reduces errors when using the data arrays.

       <b>-s</b>     This option suppresses comments inserted by reswrap to indicate the original file name from  which
              the data statement was generated.

       <b>-p</b> <u>prefix</u>
              Prepend  the given <u>prefix</u> in front of the name of the resource; this may be used to generate class
              names or namespace names in front of symbols.

       <b>-n</b> <u>namespace</u>
              Generate all declarations inside the given C++ <u>namespace</u> declaration.  Using a  <u>namespace</u>  may  be
              used  to ensure that declarations are only accessible within the given scope, and thus won't clash
              with symbols.

       <b>-c</b> <u>cols</u>
              Writes <u>cols</u> columns instead of the default number of columns in the data statements  generated  by
              reswrap.  The default number of columns for decimal and hex printout is 16 characters; the default
              for text string printout is 80 characters.

       <b>-u</b>     Force output as unsigned chars in text mode.

       <b>-z</b>     Output  the  size  of  the  resource  in the declaration of a resource-array.  This allows the C++
              sizeof() operator to return the correct size of the resource even for external declarations.  Note
              that in text mode, (-t option), an extra byte  is  added  to  the  size  for  the  end  of  string
              character.

       <b>-r</b> <u>name</u>
              Instead  of using a resource name based on the filename, reswrap substitutes <u>name</u> for the resource
              name used in the declaration or definition for the following resource file.  This is useful if the
              filename can not be used as an identifier, for example if the filename is a reserved word in C  or
              C++, like "while".

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       When  using  the  text  string  mode,  please remember the C compiler appends one nul-character after the
       string, making the data array one element longer than the resource file.
