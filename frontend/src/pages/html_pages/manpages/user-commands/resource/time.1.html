</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       time - run programs and summarize system resource usage

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>time</b>   [ <b>-apqvV</b> ] [ <b>-f</b> <u>FORMAT</u> ] [ <b>-o</b> <u>FILE</u> ]
              [ <b>--append</b> ] [ <b>--verbose</b> ] [ <b>--quiet</b> ] [ <b>--portability</b> ]
              [ <b>--format=</b><u>FORMAT</u> ] [ <b>--output=</b><u>FILE</u> ] [ <b>--version</b> ]
              [ <b>--help</b> ] <u>COMMAND</u> [ <u>ARGS</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>time</b> run the program <u>COMMAND</u> with any given arguments <u>ARG...</u>.  When <u>COMMAND</u> finishes, <b>time</b> displays
       information about resources used by <u>COMMAND</u> (on the standard error output, by default).  If <u>COMMAND</u> exits
       with non-zero status, <b>time</b> displays a warning message and the exit status.

       <b>time</b> determines which information to display about the resources used by the <u>COMMAND</u> from the string
       <u>FORMAT</u>.  If no format is specified on the command line, but the <b>TIME</b> environment variable is set, its
       value is used as the format.  Otherwise, a default format built into <b>time</b> is used.

       Options to <b>time</b> must appear on the command line before <u>COMMAND</u>.  Anything on the command line after
       <u>COMMAND</u> is passed as arguments to <u>COMMAND</u>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-o</b> <u>FILE,</u> <b>--output=</b><u>FILE</u>
              Write  the  resource  use statistics to <u>FILE</u> instead of to the standard error stream.  By default,
              this overwrites the file, destroying the file's previous contents.   This  option  is  useful  for
              collecting  information  on  interactive programs and programs that produce output on the standard
              error stream.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--append</b>
              Append the resource use information to the output file instead of overwriting it.  This option  is
              only useful with the `-o' or `--output' option.

       <b>-f</b> <u>FORMAT,</u> <b>--format</b> <u>FORMAT</u>
              Use <u>FORMAT</u> as the format string that controls the output of <b>time</b>.  See the below more information.

       <b>--help</b> Print a summary of the command line options and exit.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--portability</b>
              Use the following format string, for conformance with POSIX standard 1003.2:
                        real %e
                        user %U
                        sys %S

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Use  the  built-in  verbose  format,  which  displays  each  available piece of information on the
              program's resource use on its own line, with an English description of its meaning.

       <b>--quiet</b>
              Do not report the status of the program even if it is different from zero.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Print the version number of <b>time</b> and exit.

</pre><h4><b>FORMATTING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       The format string <u>FORMAT</u> controls the contents of the <b>time</b> output.  The format string can  be  set  using
       the  `-f' or `--format', `-v' or `--verbose', or `-p' or `--portability' options.  If they are not given,
       but the <u>TIME</u> environment variable is set, its value is used as the format string.  Otherwise, a  built-in
       default format is used.  The default format is:
         %Uuser %Ssystem %Eelapsed %PCPU (%Xtext+%Ddata %Mmax)k
         %Iinputs+%Ooutputs (%Fmajor+%Rminor)pagefaults %Wswaps

       The format string usually consists of `resource specifiers' interspersed with plain text.  A percent sign
       (`%')  in  the  format  string  causes the following character to be interpreted as a resource specifier,
       which is similar to the formatting characters in the <b><a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a></b>(3) function.

       A backslash (`\') introduces a `backslash escape', which is translated into a single  printing  character
       upon  output.   `\t'  outputs  a  tab character, `\n' outputs a newline, and `\\' outputs a backslash.  A
       backslash followed by any other character outputs a question mark  (`?')  followed  by  a  backslash,  to
       indicate that an invalid backslash escape was given.

       Other  text  in  the  format string is copied verbatim to the output.  <b>time</b> always prints a newline after
       printing the resource use information, so normally format strings do not end with a newline character (or
       `\n').

       There are many resource specifications.  Not all resources are measured by all versions of Unix, so  some
       of  the  values  might be reported as zero.  Any character following a percent sign that is not listed in
       the table below causes a question mark (`?') to be output, followed by that character, to  indicate  that
       an invalid resource specifier was given.

       The  resource specifiers, which are a superset of those recognized by the <b><a href="../man1/tcsh.1.html">tcsh</a></b>(1) builtin `time' command,
       are:
              %      A literal `%'.
              C      Name and command line arguments of the command being timed.
              D      Average size of the process's unshared data area, in Kilobytes.
              E      Elapsed real (wall clock) time used by the process, in [hours:]minutes:seconds.
              F      Number of major, or I/O-requiring, page faults that occurred while the process was running.
                     These are faults where the page has actually migrated out of primary memory.
              I      Number of file system inputs by the process.
              K      Average total (data+stack+text) memory use of the process, in Kilobytes.
              M      Maximum resident set size of the process during its lifetime, in Kilobytes.
              O      Number of file system outputs by the process.
              P      Percentage of the CPU that this job got.  This is just user + system times divided  by  the
                     total running time.  It also prints a percentage sign.
              R      Number  of minor, or recoverable, page faults.  These are pages that are not valid (so they
                     fault) but which have not yet been claimed by other virtual pages.  Thus the  data  in  the
                     page is still valid but the system tables must be updated.
              S      Total  number  of CPU-seconds used by the system on behalf of the process (in kernel mode),
                     in seconds.
              U      Total number of CPU-seconds that the process used directly (in user mode), in seconds.
              W      Number of times the process was swapped out of main memory.
              X      Average amount of shared text in the process, in Kilobytes.
              Z      System's page size, in bytes.  This is a per-system constant, but varies between systems.
              c      Number of times the process was context-switched  involuntarily  (because  the  time  slice
                     expired).
              e      Elapsed real (wall clock) time used by the process, in seconds.
              k      Number of signals delivered to the process.
              p      Average unshared stack size of the process, in Kilobytes.
              r      Number of socket messages received by the process.
              s      Number of socket messages sent by the process.
              t      Average resident set size of the process, in Kilobytes.
              w      Number  of  times  that  the  program  was context-switched voluntarily, for instance while
                     waiting for an I/O operation to complete.
              x      Exit status of the command.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To run the command `wc <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>' and show the default information:
            time wc <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>

       To run the command `ls -Fs' and show just the user, system, and total time:
            time -f "\t%E real,\t%U user,\t%S sys" ls -Fs

       To edit the file BORK and have `time' append the elapsed time and number of signals to  the  file  `log',
       reading the format string from the environment variable `TIME':
            export TIME="\t%E,\t%k" # If using bash or ksh
            setenv TIME "\t%E,\t%k" # If using csh or tcsh
            time -a -o log emacs bork

       Users  of  the  <b>bash</b> shell need to use an explicit path in order to run the external <b>time</b> command and not
       the shell builtin variant.  On system where <b>time</b> is installed in <u><a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a></u>, the first example would become
            <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?time">/usr/bin/time</a> wc <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>

</pre><h4><b>ACCURACY</b></h4><pre>
       The elapsed time is not collected atomically with the execution of the program; as a result,  in  bizarre
       circumstances  (if  the  <b>time</b> command gets stopped or swapped out in between when the program being timed
       exits and when <b>time</b> calculates how long it took to  run),  it  could  be  much  larger  than  the  actual
       execution time.

       When  the  running  time of a command is very nearly zero, some values (e.g., the percentage of CPU used)
       may be reported as either zero (which is wrong) or a question mark.

       Most information shown by <b>time</b> is derived from the <b><a href="../man2/wait3.2.html">wait3</a></b>(2) system call.  The numbers are only as good as
       those returned by <b><a href="../man2/wait3.2.html">wait3</a></b>(2).  On systems that do not have a <b><a href="../man2/wait3.2.html">wait3</a></b>(2) call that returns status information,
       the <b><a href="../man2/times.2.html">times</a></b>(2) system call is used instead.  However, it provides much less information than  <b><a href="../man2/wait3.2.html">wait3</a></b>(2),  so
       on those systems <b>time</b> reports the majority of the resources as zero.

       The  `%I' and `%O' values are allegedly only `real' input and output and do not include those supplied by
       caching devices.  The meaning of `real' I/O reported by `%I' and `%O' may be  muddled  for  workstations,
       especially diskless ones.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>time</b>  command  returns  when the program exits, stops, or is terminated by a signal.  If the program
       exited normally, the return value of <b>time</b> is the return value of the program it  executed  and  measured.
       Otherwise,  the  return  value  is  128 plus the number of the signal which caused the program to stop or
       terminate.
