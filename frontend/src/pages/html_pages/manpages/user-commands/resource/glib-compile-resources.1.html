</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       glib-compile-resources - GLib resource compiler

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>glib-compile-resources</b> [<u>OPTION</u>…] <u>FILE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>glib-compile-resources</b>  reads  the  resource  description  from <b>FILE</b> and the files that it references and
       creates a binary resource bundle that is suitable for use with the <b>GResource</b> API. The resulting bundle is
       then written out as-is, or as C source for linking into an application.

       The XML resource files normally have the filename extension <b>.gresource.xml</b>.  For a  detailed  description
       of the XML file format, see the <b>GResource</b> documentation &lt;https://docs.gtk.org/gio/struct.Resource.html&gt; .

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
          Print help and exit.

       <b>--version</b>
          Print program version and exit.

       <b>--target</b> <b>&lt;TARGET&gt;</b>
          Store  the  compiled  resources  in  the  file  <b>TARGET</b>.  If not specified a filename based on the <b>FILE</b>
          basename is used.

       <b>--sourcedir</b> <b>&lt;DIRECTORY&gt;</b>
          The files referenced in <b>FILE</b> are loaded from this directory. If not specified, the  current  directory
          is used. If <b>--sourcedir</b> is used more than once, the specified directories are searched in order.

       <b>--generate</b>
          Write the output file in the format selected for by its filename extension:

          <b>.c</b>
              C source

          <b>.h</b>
              C header

          <b>.gresource</b>
              resource bundle

       <b>--generate-source</b>
          Instead  of  a  writing  the  resource bundle in binary form, create a C source file that contains the
          resource bundle. This can then be compiled into an application for easy access.

       <b>--generate-header</b>
          Generate a header file for use with C code generated by <b>--generate-source</b>.

       <b>--generate-dependencies</b>
          Prints the list of files that the resource bundle references to standard output. This can be  used  to
          track dependencies in the build system. For example, the following make rule would mark <b>test.gresource</b>
          as depending on all the files that <b>test.gresource.xml</b> includes, so that it is automatically rebuilt if
          any of them change:

              test.gresource: test.gresource.xml $(shell $(GLIB_COMPILE_RESOURCES) --generate-dependencies test.gresource.xml)

          Note that this may or may not be portable to non-GNU <b>make</b>.

          Also see <b>--dependency-file</b>.

       <b>--c-name</b>
          Specify  the  prefix  used  for  the  C  identifiers  in  the  code generated by <b>--generate-source</b> and
          <b>--generate-header</b>.

       <b>--manual-register</b>
          By default, code generated by <b>--generate-source</b> uses automatic initialization of  the  resource.  This
          works  on  most  systems  by  using  the  compiler  support for constructors. However, some (uncommon)
          compilers may not support this, you can then specify <b>--manual-register</b>,  which  will  generate  custom
          register   and   unregister  functions  that  your  code  can  manually  call  at  initialization  and
          uninitialization time.

       <b>--internal</b>
          By default, code generated by <b>--generate-source</b> declares all initialization functions as  <b>extern</b>.   So
          they  are  exported unless this is prevented by a link script or other means.  Since libraries usually
          want to use the functions only internally it can be more useful to  declare  them  as  <b>G_GNUC_INTERNAL</b>
          which is what <b>--internal</b> does.

       <b>--external-data</b>
          By  default,  code  generated  by <b>--generate-source</b> embeds the resource data as a string literal. When
          <b>--external-data</b> is given, the data is only declared in the generated C file, and the data  has  to  be
          linked externally.

       <b>--dependency-file</b> <b>&lt;FILE&gt;</b>
          Write  dependencies  in the same style as <b>gcc</b> <b>-M</b> <b>-MF</b> to the given file. If <b>FILE</b> is <b>-</b>, the dependencies
          are written to the standard output. Unlike <b>--generate-dependencies</b>, this option can be  combined  with
          other <b>--generate</b> options to generate dependencies as a side-effect of generating sources.

       <b>--generate-phony-targets</b>
          When  creating a dependency file with <b>--dependency-file</b> include phony targets in the same style as <b>gcc</b>
          <b>-MP</b>. This would typically be used with <b>make</b>.

       <b>--compiler</b> <b>&lt;NAME&gt;</b>
          Generate code that is going to target the given compiler <b>NAME</b>. The current two compiler modes are <b>gcc</b>,
          for all GCC-compatible toolchains; and <b>msvc</b>, for the Microsoft Visual C Compiler. If this option isn’t
          set, then the default will be taken from the <b>CC</b> environment variable.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>XMLLINT</b>
          The full path to the <b>xmllint</b> executable. This is used to preprocess resources with the <b>xml-stripblanks</b>
          preprocessing option. If this environment variable is not set, <b>xmllint</b> is searched for in the <b>PATH</b>.

       <b>GDK_PIXBUF_PIXDATA</b>
          Deprecated since gdk-pixbuf 2.32,  as  <b>GResource</b>  supports  embedding  modern  image  formats  without
          conversion.

          The  full  path  to  the  <b>gdk-pixbuf-pixdata</b> executable. This is used to preprocess resources with the
          <b>to-pixdata</b> preprocessing option. If this  environment  variable  is  not  set,  <b>gdk-pixbuf-pixdata</b>  is
          searched for in the <b>PATH</b>.

       <b>JSON_GLIB_FORMAT</b>
          The  full  path  to  the  <b>json-glib-format</b>  executable.  This is used to preprocess resources with the
          <b>json-stripblanks</b> preprocessing option. If this environment variable is not  set,  <b>json-glib-format</b>  is
          searched for in the <b>PATH</b>.

                                                                                        <u>GLIB-COMPILE-RESOURCES</u>()
