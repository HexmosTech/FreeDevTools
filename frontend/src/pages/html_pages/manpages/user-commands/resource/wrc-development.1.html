</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wrc - Wine Resource Compiler

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wrc</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>inputfile</u>...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wrc</b> compiles resources from <u>inputfile</u> into win16 and win32 compatible binary format.

       The  source  file  is preprocessed with a builtin ANSI-C compatible preprocessor before the resources are
       compiled. See <b>PREPROCESSOR</b> below.

       <b>wrc</b> takes a series of <u>inputfile</u> as argument. The resources are read from standard input if  no  inputfile
       is  given.  If  the output file is not specified with <b>-o</b>, then <b>wrc</b> will write the output to <u>inputfile.res</u>
       with <u>.rc</u> stripped, or to <u>wrc.tab.res</u> if no inputfile was given.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b,</b> <b>--target=</b><u>cpu-manufacturer</u>[<b>-</b><u>kernel</u>]<b>-</b><u>os</u>
              Specify the target CPU and platform on  which  the  generated  code  will  be  built.  The  target
              specification is in the standard autoconf format as returned by <b>config.sub</b>.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--define</b>=<u>id</u>[<b>=</b><u>val</u>]
              Define preprocessor identifier <u>id</u> to (optionally) value <u>val</u>.  See also <b>PREPROCESSOR</b> below.

       <b>--debug</b>=<u>nn</u>
              Set  debug  level  to  <u>nn</u>.  The  value  is  a  bitmask  consisting of 1=verbose, 2=dump internals,
              4=resource parser trace, 8=preprocessor  messages,  16=preprocessor  scanner  and  32=preprocessor
              parser trace.

       <b>--endianness</b>=<u>e</u>
              Win32  only;  set  output  byte-ordering,  where  <u>e</u>  is  one of n[ative], l[ittle] or b[ig].  Only
              resources in source-form can be reordered. Native ordering depends on the system on which <b>wrc</b>  was
              built. You can see the native ordering by typing <u>wrc</u> <u>-h</u>.

       <b>-E</b>     Preprocess  only.  The  output  is  written  to standard output if no outputfile was selected. The
              output is compatible with what gcc would generate.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              Prints a summary message and exits.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--input</b>=<u>file</u>
              The name of the input file. If this option is not used, then <b>wrc</b> will  use  the  first  non-option
              argument  as  the  input  file name. If there are no non-option arguments, then <b>wrc</b> will read from
              standard input.

       <b>-I</b>, <b>--include-dir</b>=<u>path</u>
              Add <u>path</u> to include search directories. <u>path</u> may contain multiple directories, separated with ':'.
              It is allowed to specify <b>-I</b> multiple times. Include files are searched in the order in  which  the
              <b>-I</b> options were specified.
              The search is compatible with gcc, in which '&lt;&gt;' quoted filenames are searched exclusively via the
              <b>-I</b>  set  path,  whereas  the  '""'  quoted  filenames  are first tried to be opened in the current
              directory. Also resource statements with file references are located in the same way.

       <b>-J</b>, <b>--input-format</b>=<u>format</u>
              Sets the input format. Valid options are 'rc' or 'rc16'. Setting the input to 'rc16' disables  the
              recognition of win32 keywords.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>--language</b>=<u>lang</u>
              Set default language to <u>lang</u>. Default is the neutral language 0 (i.e. "LANGUAGE 0, 0").

       <b>-m16,</b> <b>-m32,</b> <b>-m64</b>
              Generate  resources  for  16-bit,  32-bit  or  64-bit platforms respectively.  The only difference
              between 32-bit and 64-bit is whether the _WIN64 preprocessor symbol is defined.

       <b>--nls-dir=</b><u>dir</u>
              Specify the directory to search for the NLS files containing the codepage mapping tables.

       <b>--nostdinc</b>
              Do not search the standard include path, look for include files only in the directories explicitly
              specified with the <b>-I</b> option.

       <b>--no-use-temp-file</b>
              Ignored for compatibility with <u>windres</u>.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>-fo</b>, <b>--output</b>=<u>file</u>
              Write output to <u>file</u>. Default is <b>inputfile.res</b> with <b>.rc</b> stripped or <b>wrc.tab.res</b> if input  is  read
              from standard input.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--output-format</b>=<u>format</u>
              Sets  the output format. The supported formats are <b>po</b>, <b>pot</b>, <b>res</b>, and <b>res16</b>.  If this option is not
              specified, the format defaults to <b>res</b>.
              In <b>po</b> mode, if an output file name is  specified  it  must  match  a  known  language  name,  like
              <b>en_US.po</b>;  only  resources  for  the  specified  language  are  output.  If no output file name is
              specified, a separate <u>.po</u> file is created for every language encountered in the input.

       <b>--pedantic</b>
              Enable pedantic warnings. Notably redefinition of #define statements can be discovered  with  this
              option.

       <b>--po-dir=</b><u>dir</u>
              Enable  the  generation  of  resource  translations  based  on  mo files loaded from the specified
              directory. That directory must follow the gettext convention, in particular it  must  contain  one
              <u>.mo</u> file for each language, and a LINGUAS file listing the available languages.

       <b>-r</b>     Ignored for compatibility with <u>rc</u>.

       <b>--preprocessor</b>=<u>program</u>
              This  option  may  be used to specify the preprocessor to use, including any leading arguments. If
              not specified, <b>wrc</b> uses its builtin processor.  To disable preprocessing, use <b>--preprocessor=cat</b>.

       <b>--sysroot=</b><u>dir</u>
              Prefix the standard include paths with <u>dir</u>.

       <b>--utf8</b>, <b>-u</b>
              Set the default codepage of the input file to UTF-8.

       <b>-U</b>, <b>--undefine</b>=<u>id</u>
              Undefine preprocessor identifier <u>id</u>.  Please note that only macros defined up to  this  point  are
              undefined by this command. However, these include the special macros defined automatically by <u>wrc</u>.
              See also <b>PREPROCESSOR</b> below.

       <b>--use-temp-file</b>
              Ignored for compatibility with <u>windres</u>.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Turns on verbose mode (equivalent to <b>-d</b> <b>1</b>).

       <b>--version</b>
              Print version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>PREPROCESSOR</b></h4><pre>
       The preprocessor is ANSI-C compatible with some of the extensions of the gcc preprocessor.

       The  preprocessor  recognizes  these  directives: #include, #define (both simple and macro), #undef, #if,
       #ifdef, #ifndef, #elif, #else, #endif, #error,  #warning,  #line,  #  (both  null-  and  line-directive),
       #pragma (ignored), #ident (ignored).

       The preprocessor sets by default several defines:
       RC_INVOKED      set to 1
       __WRC__         Major version of wrc
       __WRC_MINOR__   Minor version of wrc
       __WRC_PATCHLEVEL__   Patch level

       Win32 compilation mode also sets _WIN32 to 1.

       Special  macros  __FILE__,  __LINE__,  __TIME__  and  __DATE__  are  also  recognized and expand to their
       respective equivalent.

</pre><h4><b>LANGUAGE</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       Language, version and characteristics can be bound to all resource types that have inline data,  such  as
       RCDATA.  This is an extension to Microsoft's resource compiler, which lacks this support completely. Only
       VERSIONINFO cannot have version and characteristics attached, but languages are  propagated  properly  if
       you declare it correctly before the VERSIONINFO resource starts.

       Example:

       1 RCDATA DISCARDABLE
       LANGUAGE 1, 0
       VERSION 312
       CHARACTERISTICS 876
       {
            1, 2, 3, 4, 5, "and whatever more data you want"
            '00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08'
       }

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wrc</b>  was  written  by  Bertho  A.  Stultiens  and is a nearly complete rewrite of the first wine resource
       compiler (1994) by Martin von Loewis.  Additional resource-types were contributed by Ulrich Czekalla  and
       Albert  den Haan. Many cleanups by Dimitrie O. Paun in 2002-2003.  Bugfixes have been contributed by many
       Wine developers.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       - The preprocessor recognizes variable argument macros, but does not expand them correctly.
       - Error reporting should be more precise, as currently the column and line number reported are  those  of
       the next token.
       - Default memory options should differ between win16 and win32.

       There is no support for:
       - RT_DLGINCLUDE, RT_VXD, RT_PLUGPLAY and RT_HTML (unknown format)
       - PUSHBOX control is unsupported due to lack of original functionality.

       Fonts  are  parsed and generated, but there is no support for the generation of the FONTDIR yet. The user
       must supply the FONTDIR resource in the source to match the FONT resources.

       Bugs can be reported on the <b>Wine</b> <b>bug</b> <b>tracker</b>.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wrc</b> is  part  of  the  Wine  distribution,  which  is  available  through  WineHQ,  the  <b>Wine</b> <b>development</b>
       <b>headquarters</b>.
