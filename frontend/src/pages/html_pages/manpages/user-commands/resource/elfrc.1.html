</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       elfrc — a resource compiler for ELF systems

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>elfrc</b> [<b>-o</b> <u>filename]</u>  <u>[</u><b>-h</b> <u>filename]</u>  <u>[</u><b>-v</b> <u>]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>elfrc</b> command.

       This  manual  page  was  written for the <b>Debian</b> distribution because the original program does not have a
       manual page.

       <b>elfrc</b> is a program which can turn arbitrary files into ELF object files which can  then  be  linked  into
       your program directly and accessed via simple, user-defined symbol names.

       For instance, it's possible to embed even huge (16MB+) files directly into the executable and then access
       the data in constant time without making the compiler or linker eat loads of memory.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Here's what the arguments do:

       <b>-o</b> <u>filename</u>
                 Store resulting ELF object in <u>filename</u>. If not given, no ELF object will be generated.

       <b>-h</b> <u>filename</u>
                 Store C header file which can be used to access the resource data in <u>filename</u>. If not given, no
                 header file will be generated.

       <b>-v</b>        Be a little verbose about what's going on.

       In  any case, the most important argument is <u>resfile</u> - the path to a resource file which can be parsed by
       elfrc. If no resource file is given, or if "-" (a dash) is given, the resources will  be  read  from  the
       standard input.

       A  resource  file  is  just a plain text file, each line in the file describing a resource to be compiled
       into the ELF output. Each line is expected to three fields, separated by tab characters: the type of  the
       resource  (can  be  either 'binary' or 'text'), the symbol name (this should be a valid C identifier) and
       the path to the file to be compiled in.
