   <b>Perl</b> <b>Version</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>System</b>
       The many Perl versions available and still installed on many machines come with various subtle bugs.  We
       have tried to work around most of them, but a few remain.  We have a test suite of around 75 tests, all
       of which usually pass.  On some platforms lacking some features, notably Cygwin, a few tests are
       explicitly skipped.  This table shows with what version this has been tested where, and whether it was
       successful.  We would like to hear of your results on other platforms too!

       Note that you get a comparable overview when going to the top right CPAN tab and choosing Perl/Platform
       Version Matrix (&lt;<a href="http://matrix.cpantesters.org/">http://matrix.cpantesters.org/</a>?dist=makepp&gt;).  But they give a red bar even if only one
       out of about hundred tests fail.  And since those test are automated on screened off machines, it can be
       hard to find out or even fix what is going wrong.  Often it is something that could be worked around,
       like compiler, operating or file system particularities or wrong environment variables.

       Win There  are 4 different Perl environments on Windows, which normally extend one another when installed
           in parallel.  Here they have been tested with a minimal PATH, so  as  to  separate  them  completely.
           When using native programs, you may need to see the note under &amp;ln.

           •   <b>Cygwin</b>  fairly  closely  emulates  GNU/Linux  and gives the best results.  Perl 5.8.7 has a small
               problem with environment vars, making one test fail.  In the  long  gone  past,  parallel  builds
               didn't  work,  but  it hasn't be verified which version of Cygwin or Perl made them usable.  Perl
               5.10.1 has a problem with chmod 0 files, so they can't be used to prevent repository imports.  In
               rare cases recent Cygwin also leads <b>stat()</b> to report a symlink for an inexistent file.  This does
               not seem a Perl bug, since the same perls that were error free before, now show  this  behaviour.
               Makepp has been reorganized to much reduce this, so you may never see it.

           •   <b>MinGW</b>  stays  close to Windows, giving it only a Unixy look and feel.  It has a clever workaround
               for lack of symbolic links, namely copying instead (&amp;ln has stolen this idea).  Alas this is  not
               good  enough  for  the  <b>repository</b>  mechanism, so that isn't available, in addition to the Cygwin
               deficiencies.

           •   On <b>Strawberry</b> Perl with only native Windows most customary Unix commands (except  GNU  compilers)
               are  missing, and the "shell" is extremely primitive.  A maximal use of makepp's builtin commands
               and embedded Perl can increase makefile portability.

               While Windows programs can handle normal slashes as directory separators, this does not work  for
               command  names.   Those should always be portably written as <u>dir$/command</u>, where $/ gets replaced
               by a forward or backward slash, depending on the environment.  If you tell makepp, via the  SHELL
               variable, where to find a Unix-like Shell, you don't have these worries.

               It  cannot do smart recursive makes (but who would want them, since they are known to be a broken
               paradigm) and <b>parallel</b> builds.

           •   <b>ActiveState</b> Perl is very similar to Strawberry, as far as makepp goes,  though  it  doesn't  come
               with  GNU  compilers.   Up  to  Perl  5.8.6,  it  will rewrite Mpp/File.pm so as to have a needed
               workaround for an lstat bug.

       zOS On z/OS (alias VMS or OS/390) Unix System Services  smart  recursive  make  doesn't  work.   If  your
           compiler  is  picky about option order, you may have to write your own rules.  (To compile Perl 5.8.8
           you may have to remove the silly "(void)env;" in miniperlmain.c.  Perl 5.10.0 is not compilable on an
           Ebcdic system while 5.12.1 and 5.14.0 may have macro errors with the z/OS C compiler.)

       Nest
           Some old compilers do not like nested  comments.   Since  <u>additional_tests/2006_03_23_c_comments.test</u>
           looks  at all kinds of constellations, and verifies it's conclusions with the compiler, this test can
           fail if you do not use gcc.

   <b>File</b> <b>Systems</b>
       Various special file systems have unusual properties, giving makepp a hard time when working on them:

       NFS NFS may reorder file operations at its discretion, leading to unexpected relationships  between  time
           stamps.   This  is  relevant  for  the build info meta-data files, which makepp stores alongside each
           file.  Especially in build caches,  with  their  concurrent  access,  some  workaround  handling  was
           necessary, but it is shown by load test to work fine.

       Windows CIFS on GNU/Linux
           A  few special characters are not allowed in filenames.  Links are emulated by copying while symbolic
           linking fails.  Apparently write operations come back before they are visible on disk, which confuses
           makepp about the success of the commands it executes.  Six out of 76 tests fail due to this.  On  the
           bright  side,  timestamps  have  a  precision  of  100  nanoseconds  (though  the observed obtainable
           differences are only about a centisecond).  This is much better than most older Unix file systems  --
           alas Perl's "stat" function has no access to this very welcome precision.

       Windows Server Share on Cygwin
           The  same CIFS disk that was works so badly on Linux, passes all tests on Cygwin.  Possibly there are
           CIFS mount options that might improve something.

       Unix SMBFS from GNU/Linux
           Linking and symbolic linking fails.  No other tests fail.  I have  no  access  to  a  more  realistic
           Windows SMB server, where the situation might be different.

       VFAT on GNU/Linux
           A few special characters are not allowed in filenames.  Linking and symbolic linking fails.  The file
           permission mask and owner are mount options, while the time stamps are not settable.

       Mixed Case Sensitive &amp; Insensitive File Names
           Makepp's  file  name handling is either fully case sensitive or not, depending on the directory where
           it was invoked.  If this directory is case insensitive, but it is mounted on a path containing  upper
           case letters within the case sensitive part of the path, then makepp will trip.

           If  you  need this setup to work (e.g. the Windows host is reachable as <u>/mnt/hgfs/C</u> from Linux inside
           VMware) you will have to design your Makefile as though you were on a case sensitive file system  and
           "export MAKEPP_CASE_SENSITIVE_FILENAMES=1" before you call makepp.
