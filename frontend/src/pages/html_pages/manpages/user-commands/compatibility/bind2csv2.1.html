       bind2csv2 - convert zone files from BIND to MaraDNS compatible format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRPTION</b></h4><pre>
       MaraDNS 1.3 has BIND zone file support. This means it is possible to use BIND zone files in MaraDNS. This
       makes it easier for people to use MaraDNS in mixed DNS server environments.

       Instead of having direct BIND zone file support, MaraDNS has a script, called bind2csv2, that converts
       BIND zone files in to the "csv2" zone file format that MaraDNS 1.2 and 1.3 use. The zone files generated
       by bind2csv2 are <u>not</u> MaraDNS 1.2 compatible; MaraDNS 1.3 is needed to read zone files generated by
       bind2csv2.

       bind2csv2 is a Python script, written in version 2.2.3 of the Python interpreter. The script <u>should</u> be
       compatible with more recent versions of Python. The script assumes Python is the file /usr/bin/python on
       your system; if Python is located elsewhere on your system, please change the first line of bind2csv2.
       Naturally, you will need the Python interpreter installed on your system to use bind2csv2.  This is a
       well-known open source language supported by most modern Linux and BSD distributions.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       To use the script, enter a directory containing BIND zone files, and invoke the script thusly:

       <b>bind2csv2</b> <b>-c</b> <u>zone1</u> <u>zone2</u> <u>zone3</u>

       Substitute "zone1", "zone2", and "zone3" with a list of one or more BIND zone files you wish be converted
       in to MaraDNS 1.3 csv2 zone files.

       Once the script is run, you should have files with names like "zone1.csv2", "zone2.csv2", and
       "zone3.csv2". These files are csv2 zone files that MaraDNS will be able to parse. Copy these csv2 zone
       files to a place where MaraDNS can find the zone files.

       Should there already be a "zone1.csv2" file when bind2csv2 is run, the "zone1.csv2" file will be
       replaced.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None. Bind2csv2 can only be used as above.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       bind2csv2 is not a perfect zone file converter. In particular, bind2csv2 does not act like BIND when NS
       records have different TTLs. Please make sure all NS records in your BIND zone files have the same TTL.

       In addition, bind2csv2 also does not support all resource record types that BIND supports. Only the
       following RRs are supported by bind2csv2: A AAAA AFSDB CNAME GPOS HINFO ISDN LOC MB MD MF MG MINFO MR MX
       NS NSAP PTR PX RP RT SOA SPF SRV TXT WKS X25
