       ocaml.m4 - Autoconf macros for OCaml

</pre><h4><b>SUMMARY</b></h4><pre>
        AC_PROG_OCAML
        AC_PROG_FINDLIB
        AC_PROG_OCAMLLEX
        AC_PROG_OCAMLYACC
        AC_PROG_CAMLP4
        AC_CHECK_OCAML_PKG([name])
        AC_CHECK_OCAML_MODULE(VARIABLE,NAME,MODULE,INCLUDE-PATHS)
        AC_CHECK_OCAML_WORD_SIZE

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ocaml.m4</b> is a file containing standard, useful autoconf macros for detecting the OCaml, findlib, OCaml
       packages, and so on in your autoconf-generated ./configure scripts.

       To begin using these macros, you will need to copy the "ocaml.m4" file (usually located at
       "/usr/share/aclocal/ocaml.m4") to the autoconf macros directory in your project.  Normally this is the
       "m4/" directory in your project, but the directory can be changed using the AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR(DIR)
       directive.  If you have just created the "m4/" directory, then you may also need to do:

        aclocal -I m4

       You can then add any of the macros described below to your "configure.ac" (or "configure.in"). Almost
       every OCaml project should use "AC_PROG_OCAML" first and probably "AC_PROG_FINDLIB" right after it.

       This manual page does not describe how to use autoconf.  For that you should read the detailed autoconf
       info file ("info autoconf").

</pre><h4><b>AC_PROG_OCAML</b></h4><pre>
       This macro detects which tools of the usual OCaml toolchain are available. It defines and substitutes the
       following variables:

        OCAMLC          set to the name of the bytecode compiler
                          (eg. "ocamlc" or "ocamlc.opt"), or "no" if
                          no OCaml installation was found
        OCAMLOPT        the name of the native-code compiler, eg. "ocamlopt",
                          "ocamlopt.opt" or "no"
        OCAMLBEST       "byte" (if only the bytecode compiler is available)
                          or "opt" (if both bytecode and native code compilers
                          are available)
        OCAMLDEP        the name of the dependency resolver, eg. "ocamldep"
        OCAMLMKTOP      the name of ocamlmktop
        OCAMLMKLIB      the name of ocamlmklib
        OCAMLDOC        the name of ocamldoc
        OCAMLBUILD      the name of ocamlbuild
        OCAMLLIB        the OCaml library path (eg. C&lt;/usr/lib/ocaml/&gt;)
        OCAMLVERSION    the compiler version (eg. C&lt;3.11.0&gt;)

   <b>Detecting</b> <b>if</b> <b>OCaml</b> <b>is</b> <b>installed</b>
       Unlike old versions of these macros, "AC_PROG_OCAML" does <u>not</u> exit if no OCaml installation is detected.
       Therefore if you want to detect if OCaml is installed you have to do something like this:

        AC_PROG_OCAML
        if test "$OCAMLC" = "no"; then
          AC_MSG_ERROR([You must install the OCaml compiler])
        fi

       This behaviour and usage pattern are consistent with other macros of the "AC_PROG_*") family.

   <b>Cross-compiling</b>
       If the configure script is invoked for cross-compiling then "AC_PROG_OCAML" will detect the cross-
       compiler versions of the OCaml compiler, eg. "OCAMLC=i686-pc-mingw32-ocamlc" etc.  This happens
       automatically, and for most purposes you don't need to worry about it.

</pre><h4><b>AC_PROG_FINDLIB</b></h4><pre>
       This macro checks for the presence of the ocamlfind program (part of findlib).  It defines and
       substitutes "OCAMLFIND" to the name of the ocamlfind program, or "no" if not found.

       Note that this macro does not fail if ocamlfind is not found.  If you want to force the user to install
       findlib, you should do:

        AC_PROG_FINDLIB
        if test "$OCAMLFIND" = "no"; then
          AC_MSG_ERROR([You must install OCaml findlib (the ocamlfind command)])
        fi

       See also "AC_CHECK_OCAML_PKG".

</pre><h4><b>AC_PROG_OCAMLLEX</b></h4><pre>
       This checks for the ocamllex program and sets "OCAMLLEX" to the name of the program (eg. "ocamllex" or
       "ocamllex.opt"), or "no" if not found.

</pre><h4><b>AC_PROG_OCAMLYACC</b></h4><pre>
       This checks for the ocamlyacc program and sets "OCAMLYACC" to the name of the program, or "no" if not
       found.

</pre><h4><b>AC_PROG_CAMLP4</b></h4><pre>
       This checks for camlp4, and checks that the version matches the compiler version found previously.  It
       sets "CAMLP4" to the name of the basic camlp4 program, or "no" if not found.

       The macro also checks for other tools of the camlp4 suite like camlp4o, camlp4orf, etc. For each of them,
       a fully capitalized variable is set to the tool name (or "no" if not found); all variable are substituted
       for when filling .in files. The full list of tools and respective variable names is as follows:

        camlp4        CAMLP4
        camlp4boot    CAMLP4BOOT
        camlp4o       CAMLP4O
        camlp4of      CAMLP4OF
        camlp4oof     CAMLP4OOF
        camlp4orf     CAMLP4ORF
        camlp4prof    CAMLP4PROF
        camlp4r       CAMLP4R
        camlp4rf      CAMLP4RF

</pre><h4><b>AC_CHECK_OCAML_PKG</b></h4><pre>
       This is the main macro that can be used to detect the presence of OCaml findlib packages.  This macro
       uses ocamlfind to look up findlib packages (and thus requires that findlib itself has been installed, and
       that the package has been properly packaged with a META file etc.)  If you want to find an OCaml findlib
       package which hasn't been installed with findlib then you should try using "AC_CHECK_OCAML_MODULE"
       instead.

        AC_CHECK_OCAML_PKG([name])

       checks for an OCaml findlib package with the given name. If found, it defines and substitutes the
       variable "OCAML_PKG_name" where the "name" part is substituted for the package name by replacing all
       dashes with underscores.

       For example,

        AC_CHECK_OCAML_PKG([xml-light])

       will set "OCAML_PKG_xml_light" to either "xml-light" or "no".

       To have the configure script fail if a package is not installed, do:

        AC_CHECK_OCAML_PKG([foo])
        if test "$OCAML_PKG_foo" = "no"; then
          AC_MSG_ERROR([Please install OCaml findlib module 'foo'.])
        fi

       In your Makefile.in, use the substitution variable in conjunction with ocamlfind, eg:

        .ml.cmo:
          $(OCAMLFIND) ocamlc -package @OCAML_PKG_foo@ -c $&lt; -o $@

       Note that also in the substitution variable dashes are replaced with underscores.

   <b>Checking</b> <b>for</b> <b>alternative</b> <b>findlib</b> <b>package</b> <b>names</b>
       In the (unlikely) case where the same library corresponds to different findlib package names on different
       systems, you can improve portability by checking for the alternative names passing a second argument to
       "AC_CHECK_OCAML_PKG":

        AC_CHECK_OCAML_PKG(PKGNAME,ALTERNATIVE-NAMES)

       The behaviour is the same as before if "PKGNAME" is found. Otherwise all names in "ALTERNATIVE-NAMES" are
       tested in turn as findlib package names. If one is found, it is set as the value set by the macro and
       substituted in .in files; otherwise "no" is set.

       Note that the variable name is determined by "PKGNAME", while the value depends on the actual alternative
       name found.

       For example, to detect the camlzip findlib package, either called "zip" or "camlzip", and to store the
       found value in the "OCAML_PKG_zip" variable you can do in your configure.ac:

        AC_CHECK_OCAML_PKG(zip,camlzip)

       and have a portable Makefile.in build line such as:

        .ml.cmo:
          $(OCAMLFIND) ocamlc -package @OCAML_PKG_zip@ -c $&lt; -o $@

</pre><h4><b>AC_CHECK_OCAML_MODULE(VARIABLE,NAME,MODULE,INCLUDE-PATHS)</b></h4><pre>
       "AC_CHECK_OCAML_MODULE" is the hairier alternative to "AC_CHECK_OCAML_PKG".  You should always use
       "AC_CHECK_OCAML_PKG" and ocamlfind/findlib if possible.

       The parameters are:

       VARIABLE
           This  is the environment variable that is set.  It will either be set to the include path, or to "no"
           if the module was not found.

       NAME
           This is the name of the module we are  looking  for.   This  parameter  is  just  used  for  printing
           messages, and does not affect how the module is found.

       MODULE
           This  should be an OCaml module name, representing the module name being looked up.  You can put sub-
           modules here, eg.  "CalendarLib.Date"

       INCLUDE-PATHS
           This is the default list of include directories to search, eg.  "+calendar"

       For example, the following code will check for the OCaml Calendar module, and  will  distinguish  between
       version 1 and version 2 of this module (which have incompatible APIs).

        AC_CHECK_OCAML_PKG(calendar)
        AC_CHECK_OCAML_MODULE(is_calendar2,calendar,[CalendarLib.Date],[+calendar])

       After the above code has run, variables "OCAML_PKG_calendar" and "is_calendar2" will be set as follows:

        OCAML_PKG_calendar  is_calendar2  Result

        yes                 +calendar     Calendar v2 is installed
        yes                 no            Calendar v1 is installed
        no                  no            No Calendar module installed

</pre><h4><b>AC_CHECK_OCAML_WORD_SIZE</b></h4><pre>
       This checks the word size of the OCaml compiler, and sets "OCAML_WORD_SIZE" to either 32 or 64.
