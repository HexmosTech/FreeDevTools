</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ocaml - The OCaml interactive toplevel

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ocaml</b> [ <u>options</u> ] [ <u>object-files</u> ] [ <u>script-file</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b><a href="../man1/ocaml.1.html">ocaml</a></b>(1)  command is the toplevel system for OCaml, that permits interactive use of the OCaml system
       through a read-eval-print loop. In this mode, the system repeatedly reads  OCaml  phrases  from  standard
       input,  then  typechecks, compiles and evaluates them, then prints the inferred type and result value, if
       any.  End-of-file on standard input terminates <b><a href="../man1/ocaml.1.html">ocaml</a></b>(1).

       Input to the toplevel can span several lines. It begins after the # (sharp) prompt printed by the  system
       and  is  terminated  by ;; (a double-semicolon) followed by optional white space and an end of line.  The
       toplevel input consists in one or several toplevel phrases.

       If one or more <u>object-files</u> (ending in .cmo or .cma) are given on  the  command  line,  they  are  loaded
       silently before starting the toplevel.

       If  a  <u>script-file</u>  is  given, phrases are read silently from the file, errors printed on standard error.
       <b><a href="../man1/ocaml.1.html">ocaml</a></b>(1) exits after the execution of the last phrase.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following command-line options are recognized by <b><a href="../man1/ocaml.1.html">ocaml</a></b>(1).

       <b>-absname</b>
              Show absolute filenames in error messages.

       <b>-no-absname</b>
              Do not try to show absolute filenames in error messages.

       <b>-I</b> <u>directory</u>
              Add the given directory to the list of directories searched for  source  and  compiled  files.  By
              default, the current directory is searched first, then the standard library directory. Directories
              added  with  <b>-I</b> are searched after the current directory, in the order in which they were given on
              the command line, but before the standard library directory.

              If the given directory starts with <b>+</b>, it is taken relative to the standard library directory.  For
              instance,  <b>-I</b> <b>+compiler-libs</b>  adds  the  subdirectory <b>compiler-libs</b> of the standard library to the
              search path.

              Directories can also be added to the search path once the toplevel is running with the  <b>#directory</b>
              directive.

       <b>-init</b> <u>file</u>
              Load  the  given  file  instead of the default initialization file.  See the "Initialization file"
              section below.

       <b>-labels</b>
              Labels are not ignored in types, labels may be used in applications, and labelled  parameters  can
              be given in any order.  This is the default.

       <b>-no-app-funct</b>
              Deactivates  the  applicative  behaviour  of  functors. With this option, each functor application
              generates new types in its result and applying the same functor twice to the same argument  yields
              two incompatible structures.

       <b>-noassert</b>
              Do  not  compile  assertion  checks.   Note  that the special form <b>assert</b> <b>false</b> is always compiled
              because it is typed specially.

       <b>-noinit</b>
              Do not load any initialization file.  See the "Initialization file" section below.

       <b>-nolabels</b>
              Ignore non-optional labels in types. Labels cannot be used in applications,  and  parameter  order
              becomes strict.

       <b>-noprompt</b>
              Do not display any prompt when waiting for input.

       <b>-nopromptcont</b>
              Do  not  display  the  secondary  prompt when waiting for continuation lines in multi-line inputs.
              This should be used e.g. when running <b><a href="../man1/ocaml.1.html">ocaml</a></b>(1) in an <b><a href="../man1/emacs.1.html">emacs</a></b>(1) window.

       <b>-nostdlib</b>
              Do not include the standard library directory in the list of directories searched for  source  and
              compiled files.

       <b>-open</b> <u>module</u>
              Opens  the given module before starting the toplevel. If several <b>-open</b> options are given, they are
              processed in order, just as if the statements open! module1;; ... open! moduleN;; were input.

       <b>-ppx</b> <u>command</u>
              After parsing, pipe the abstract  syntax  tree  through  the  preprocessor  <u>command</u>.   The  module
              <b><a href="../man3/Ast_mapper.3.html">Ast_mapper</a></b>(3) implements the external interface of a preprocessor.

       <b>-principal</b>
              Check  information  path  during  type-checking,  to  make  sure  that  all types are derived in a
              principal way.  When using labelled arguments and/or polymorphic methods, this flag is required to
              ensure future versions of the compiler will be able to infer types  correctly,  even  if  internal
              algorithms change.  All programs accepted in <b>-principal</b> mode are also accepted in the default mode
              with  equivalent types, but different binary signatures, and this may slow down type checking; yet
              it is a good idea to use it once before publishing source code.

       <b>-no-principal</b>
              Do not check principality of type inference.  This is the default.

       <b>-rectypes</b>
              Allow arbitrary recursive types during type-checking.  By default, only recursive types where  the
              recursion goes through an object type are supported.

       <b>-no-rectypes</b>
              Do no allow arbitrary recursive types during type-checking.  This is the default.

       <b>-safe-string</b>
              Enforce  the  separation between types <b>string</b> and <b>bytes</b>, thereby making strings read-only. This is
              the default.

       <b>-safer-matching</b>
              Do not use type information to optimize pattern-matching.  This allows to  detect  match  failures
              even  if  a  pattern-matching  was  wrongly  assumed  to be exhaustive. This only impacts GADT and
              polymorphic variant compilation.

       <b>-short-paths</b>
              When a type is visible under several module-paths, use the shortest one when printing  the  type's
              name in inferred interfaces and error and warning messages.

       <b>-stdin</b> Read the standard input as a script file rather than starting an interactive session.

       <b>-strict-sequence</b>
              Force the left-hand part of each sequence to have type unit.

       <b>-no-strict-sequence</b>
              Left-hand part of a sequence need not have type unit.  This is the default.

       <b>-unboxed-types</b>
              When  a  type  is  unboxable  (i.e.  a record with a single argument or a concrete datatype with a
              single constructor of one argument) it will be unboxed unless annotated with <b>[@@ocaml.boxed]</b>.

       <b>-no-unboxed-types</b>
              When a type is unboxable  it will be boxed unless annotated with <b>[@@ocaml.unboxed]</b>.  This  is  the
              default.

       <b>-unsafe</b>
              Turn  bound  checking  off on array and string accesses (the <b>v.(i)</b> and <b>s.[i]</b> constructs). Programs
              compiled with <b>-unsafe</b> are therefore slightly faster,  but  unsafe:  anything  can  happen  if  the
              program accesses an array or string outside of its bounds.

       <b>-unsafe-string</b>
              Identify  the  types  <b>string</b>  and  <b>bytes</b>,  thereby  making strings writable.  This is intended for
              compatibility with old source code and should not be used with new software.

       <b>-version</b>
              Print version string and exit.

       <b>-vnum</b>  Print short version number and exit.

       <b>-no-version</b>
              Do not print the version banner at startup.

       <b>-w</b> <u>warning-list</u>
              Enable or disable warnings according to the argument <u>warning-list</u>.  See <b><a href="../man1/ocamlc.1.html">ocamlc</a></b>(1) for  the  syntax
              of the <u>warning-list</u> argument.

       <b>-warn-error</b> <u>warning-list</u>
              Mark  as  fatal  the  warnings described by the argument <u>warning-list</u>.  Note that a warning is not
              triggered (and does not trigger an error) if it is disabled by the <b>-w</b> option.  See  <b><a href="../man1/ocamlc.1.html">ocamlc</a></b>(1)  for
              the syntax of the <u>warning-list</u> argument.

       <b>-color</b> <u>mode</u>
              Enable  or  disable  colors  in compiler messages (especially warnings and errors).  The following
              modes are supported:

              <b>auto</b> use heuristics to enable colors only if the output  supports  them  (an  ANSI-compatible  tty
              terminal);

              <b>always</b> enable colors unconditionally;

              <b>never</b> disable color output.

              The  environment  variable  "OCAML_COLOR"  is considered if -color is not provided. Its values are
              auto/always/never as above.

              If -color is not provided, "OCAML_COLOR" is not set and the  environment  variable  "NO_COLOR"  is
              set,  then  color  output  is  disabled.  Otherwise,  the default setting is <b>auto,</b> and the current
              heuristic checks that the "TERM" environment variable exists and is not empty or "dumb", and  that
              isatty(stderr) holds.

       <b>-error-style</b> <u>mode</u>
              Control the way error messages and warnings are printed.  The following modes are supported:

              <b>short</b> only print the error and its location;

              <b>contextual</b> like "short", but also display the source code snippet corresponding to the location of
              the error.

              The default setting is <b>contextual.</b>

              The  environment  variable  "OCAML_ERROR_STYLE" is considered if -error-style is not provided. Its
              values are short/contextual as above.

       <b>-warn-help</b>
              Show the description of all available warning numbers.

       <b>-</b> <u>file</u> Use <u>file</u> as a script file name, even when it starts with a hyphen (-).

       <b>-help</b> or <b>--help</b>
              Display a short usage summary and exit.

</pre><h4><b>INITIALIZATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       When <b><a href="../man1/ocaml.1.html">ocaml</a></b>(1) is invoked, it will read phrases from an initialization file before giving control  to  the
       user. The file read is the first found of:

       1.     <b>.ocamlinit</b> in the current directory;

       2.     <b>XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ocaml/init.ml</b>, if <b>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b> is an absolute path;

       3.     otherwise,  on  Unix,  <b>HOME/ocaml/init.ml</b>  or,  on Windows, <b>ocaml\init.ml</b> under <b>LocalAppData</b> (e.g.
              <b>C:\Users\Bactrian\AppData\Local\ocaml\init.ml</b>);

       4.     <b>ocaml/init.ml</b> under any of the absolute paths in <b>XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</b>.  Paths  in  <b>XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</b>  are
              colon-delimited on Unix, and semicolon-delimited on Windows;

       5.     if  <b>XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</b>  contained no absolute paths, <b>/usr/xdg/ocaml/init.ml</b> on Unix or, <b>ocaml\init.ml</b>
              under  any  of   <b>LocalAppData</b>   (e.g.   <b>C:\Users\Bactrian\AppData\Local</b>),   <b>RoamingAppData</b>   (e.g.
              <b>C:\Users\Bactrian\AppData\Roaming</b>), or <b>ProgramData</b> (e.g. <b>C:\ProgramData</b>) on Windows;

       6.     <b>HOME/.ocamlinit</b>, if <b>HOME</b> is non-empty;

              You  can  specify  a  different  initialization  file  by using the <b>-init</b> <u>file</u> option, and disable
              initialization files by using the <b>-noinit</b> option.

              Note that you can also use the <b>#use</b> directive to read phrases from a file.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>OCAMLTOP_UTF_8</b>
              When printing string values, non-ascii bytes (&gt;0x7E) are printed as  decimal  escape  sequence  if
              <b>OCAMLTOP_UTF_8</b> is set to false. Otherwise they are printed unescaped.

       <b>TERM</b>   When  printing  error messages, the toplevel system attempts to underline visually the location of
              the error. It consults the TERM variable to determines the type of output terminal and look up its
              capabilities in the terminal database.
