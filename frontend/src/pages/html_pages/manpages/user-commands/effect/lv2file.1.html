</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lv2file - Apply LV2 effects to audio files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lv2file</b>
              -l|--list
              -n|--nameports <u>PLUGIN</u>
              -i <u>INFILE</u> -o <u>OUTFILE</u> [ <u>OPTIONS</u> ] <u>PLUGIN</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       lv2file  is aprogram which you can use to apply effects to your audio files without much hassle. Possible
       use cases are:
              * To apply an effect without having to open a GUI or start a project.
              * To apply effects to a large number of files, or in an automated manner.
              * A deterministic environment to debug a plugin.
              * Audio editing in a command-line only environment
       lv2file uses the LV2 plugin format (<a href="http://lv2plug.in/">http://lv2plug.in/</a>) for the effects it uses.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       lv2file follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes  (`-').   A
       summary of options is included below.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--list</b>
              List and number all available plugins.

       <b>-n</b> <b>--nameports</b> <u>PLUGIN</u>
              List all the input and control ports for the specified plugin.

       <b>-i</b> <u>FILE</u>
              Input the audio from a given FILE.  Most common sampled audio formats are supported.

       <b>-o</b> <u>FILE</u>
              Output  to  given  FILE.   If  "-" is given and "--channels" and "--rate" are both specified, then
              output will be written as raw, 32-bit floating point samples to stdout.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--channels</b> <u>CHANNELS</u>
              Specify the channel count when reading from stdin and writing to stdout.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--rate</b> <u>RATE</u>
              Specify the sample rate reading from stdin and writing to stdout.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--connect</b> <u>CHANNEL</u>:<u>PORT</u>
              Connect the channel CHANNEL in the input file to the audio  port  PORT  of  the  plugin.   If  you
              connect  multiple  channels to the same port, they will be mixed together.  The -c option is often
              not necessary, as lv2file will try to guess how you would like to connect the ports.
              It is possible to run multiple instances of a plugin using the syntax  "-c  5:2.left"  which,  for
              example, would connect the fifth channel of audio to the port labeled "left" in the second copy of
              the plugin.  You don't need to specify how many plugins to run, lv2file automatically makes enough
              according to the connections you make.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--parameters</b> <u>PORT</u>:<u>VALUE</u>
              Pass  values  to the control ports of the plugin, essentially telling the effect how to handle the
              audio.  PORT is the name of the control port, and VALUE is the value to set it  to.   For  example
              "-p volume:1" sets the effects "volume" control to 1.

              You  should  note  that because lv2file uses LV2 plugins, the VALUES will always be floating point
              numbers.  It is not possible to vary a parameter with time.  It  is  also  not  possible  to  have
              different  control  values  for multiple plugin instances.  Instead, split up the channels of your
              audio files, and process them in batches whose parameters are all the same.

       <b>[</b> <b>-m</b> <b>--mono</b> <b>]</b>
              Mix down all of the channels together and pass them to the plugin. This  will  only  work  if  the
              plugin  has  only  a  single  audio  input.  This  is  to  be  used instead of manually specifying
              connections.

       <b>[</b> <b>-b,</b> <b>--blocksize</b> <u>N</u> ]
              The size of the chunks the audio is processed in.  This  might  have  implications  for  speed  of
              processing.  <u>N</u> is measured in frames, not samples.  The default is 512.

       <b>[</b> <b>--ignore-clipping</b> <b>]</b>
              By  default,  lv2file  will check every sample for clipping and will warn the user if any clipping
              occurs.  However, if know that the effect won't produce clipping, or you don't care  if  it  does,
              you  can  use this option to turn off the check for clipping.  This will make lv2file run slightly
              faster.
