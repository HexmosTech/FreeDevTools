</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cscf - solves the Hartree-Fock equations

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The program <b>cscf</b> carries out the iterative procedure to solve the Hartree-Fock equations.

       This  program is restricted to D2h symmetry and its subgroups and the orbital occupations are required to
       be integers.  Thus, certain pure angular momentum states derived from partial  occupation  of  degenerate
       orbitals cannot be obtained with the present codes.  For example, the 2PIu (doublet PI u) state of linear
       O-N-O  derived  from  the  lowest  energy  linear  (pi u)1 configuration may only be computed as the 2B2u
       (doublet B2u) or 2B3u (doublet B 3u) component of the 2PIu  (doublet  PI  u)  state,  and  the  resulting
       spatial  wavefunction  will not have PI symmetry.  In a certain sense, however, this is desirable, as the
       energy will be a continuous function of the bending angle.  Calculating the energy of bent configurations
       as 2B2u (doublet B 2u) or 2B3u (doublet B 3u) and doing a pure  2PIu  (doublet  PI  u)  state  at  linear
       geometries results in a pronounced discontinuity.

       For  the  most part, triplet states resulting from double occupation of a doubly degenerate orbital, such
       as the 3A2 (triplet A 2) state resulting from the (e')2 or (e")2 configurations in D3h symmetry,  or  the
       3SIGMAg  (triplet  SIGMA g) state of a (pi g)2 or (pi u)2 configuration in Dinfh (D infinity h) symmetry,
       will have the  proper  spatial  symetry.   The  singlet  states  resulting  from  these  same  electronic
       configurations  are  inherently  multiconfiguration  and,  as  such,  are  not well represented by single
       configuration wavefunctions.

</pre><h4><b>CONVERGING</b> <b>CSCF</b></h4><pre>
       For difficult open shell cases, it is recommended that an appropriate closed  shell  calculation  be  run
       first  (add or remove an extra electron) and that this SCF vector then be used as a guess for the desired
       open shell wavefunction.  For TCSCF cases, it is always wise to  run  a  closed  shell  (or  perhaps  the
       appropriate triplet) SCF first and then use this as a guess for the TCSCF.

       For open shell systems, a level shift value of 0.5 to 3.0 is recommended.  Start with a high value (2.0 -
       3.0)  for  the  first  SCF  calculation and then reduce it (to 0.5 - 1.0) for subsequent runs which use a
       converged SCF vector as the starting point.

       It is extremely important to note that this version of the code no longer supports  <b>OPENTYPE.</b>   <b>One</b>  <b>must</b>
       <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>keywords</b> <b>REFERENCE</b> <b>and</b> <b>MULTP</b> <b>to</b> <b>specify</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>SCF</b> <b>needed.</b>

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>cscf</b> program searches through the default keyword path (first <b>SCF</b> and then <b>DEFAULT</b>) for the following
       keywords:

       <b>LABEL</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              This  is a character string to be included in the output.  This string is not used by the program.
              There is no default.

       <b>WFN</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              This is the type of wavefunction which is ultimately desired.  The default is <b>SCF</b>.

       <b>OPENTYPE</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>supported</b>

       <b>REFERENCE</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              This specifies the type of SCF calculation one wants to do.  It can be one of <b>RHF</b>  (for  a  closed
              shell  singlet),  <b>ROHF</b>  (for  a  restricted open shell calculation), <b>UHF</b> (for an unrestricted open
              shell calculation), <b>TWOCON</b> (for a two configuration singlet), or <b>SPECIAL</b>.  If  <b>SPECIAL</b>  is  given,
              then  alpha  and  beta  coupling coefficients must be given with the <b>ALPHA</b> and <b>BETA</b> keywords.  The
              default is <b>RHF</b>.

       <b>MULTP=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Specifies the multiplicity of the molecule.  Default is singlet.

       <b>CHARGE=</b> <u>integer</u>
              Specifies the charge of the molecule. Defauly is 0.

       <b>DOCC</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer_vector</u>
              This gives the number of doubly occupied orbitals in each irreducible representation.  There is no
              default.  If this is not given, CSCF will attempt to guess  at  the  occupations  using  the  core
              hamiltonian.

       <b>SOCC</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer_vector</u>
              This  gives the number of singly occupied orbitals in each irreducible representation. There is no
              default.

       <b>DERTYPE</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              This specifies the order of derivative that is to eventually be done.   It  is  used  by  the  <b>scf</b>
              program  to  determine  if  certain  files  are to be written and it is also used to determine the
              default convergence of the wavefunction.  The default is <b>FIRST</b>.

       <b>MAXITER</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              This gives the maximum number of iterations.  The default is 40.

       <b>CONVERGENCE</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              This specifies how tightly the wavefunction will  be  converged.   Convergence  is  determined  by
              comparing  the  RMS  change in the density matrix ("delta P") to the given value.  The convergence
              criterion is 10**(-<u>integer</u>).  The default is 7 if both <b>DERTYPE</b> <b>=</b> <b>NONE</b> and <b>WFN</b> <b>=</b> <b>SCF</b> are given  and
              10 otherwise.

       <b>LEVELSHIFT</b> <b>=</b> <u>real</u>
              This specifies the level shift. The default is 1.

       <b>DIRECT</b> <b>=</b>  <u>boolean</u>
              Specifies  whether  to  do  the SCF calculation with an integral direct technique.  The default is
              false.

       <b>PRINT_MOS</b> <b>=</b>  <u>boolean</u>
              Specifies whether to print the molecular orbitals or not.  The default is false.

       There are also a large number of less commonly used input parameters.  If you do not understand what  the
       following  options mean, then make sure that they do not appear in your input.  The defaults will work in
       the overwhelming majority of cases.  These are specified with the following keywords:

       <b>DELETE_INTS</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Integrals files will be erased if <b>WFN</b> <b>=</b> <b>SCF</b> and <b>DERTYPE</b> <b>=</b> <b>FIRST</b> or <b>DERTYPE</b> <b>=</b> <b>NONE</b>.  If you wish to
              keep integrals files then set <b>DELETE_INTS</b> = false.  The default is true.

       <b>REORDER</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              The parameter controls reordering of molecular orbitals.  If set to <b>BEFORE</b> then the guess orbitals
              from checkpoint file will be reordered. If set to <b>AFTER</b>,  converged  orbitals  will  be  reordered
              before  being  written  to the checkpoint file.  In either case <b>MOORDER</b> parameter must be given to
              specify the reordering map. The default is not to reorder orbitals.

       <b>MOORDER</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer_vector</u>
              This specifies a molecular orbital reordering vector.  It will only be used  if  <b>REORDER</b>  is  set.
              This  vector  maps  every  orbital  to  its new index, e.g. <b>MOORDER</b> <b>=</b> <b>(0</b> <b>2</b> <b>1)</b> specifies that after
              reordering orbitals 1 and 2 will be swapped. The rank of this vector is the same as the number  of
              MOs.  The  indices  are  in Pitzer order (ordered by symmetry, then by energy within each symmetry
              block), base-0.  CSCF will likely fail if the given MOORDER mixes orbitals from different  irreps.
              There is no default.

       <b>ALPHA</b> <b>=</b> <u>real_vector</u>
              If  <b>OPENTYPE</b>  <b>=</b> <b>SPECIAL</b>, then this parameter gives the alpha coupling coefficients.  The number of
              elements in this vector is MM(MM+1)/2, where MM  is  the  number  of  irreducible  representations
              containing singly occupied molecular orbitals.  There is no default.

       <b>BETA</b> <b>=</b> <u>real_vector</u>
              If  <b>OPENTYPE</b>  <b>=</b>  <b>SPECIAL</b>, then this parameter gives the beta coupling coefficients.  The number of
              elements in this vector is MM(MM+1)/2, where MM  is  the  number  of  irreducible  representations
              containing singly occupied molecular orbitals.  There is no default.

       <b>GUESS</b> <b>=</b> <u>string</u>
              This  option determines the type of initial guess at the eigenvector CSCF will use. The only valid
              option at the moment are : (1) <b>GUESS</b> <b>=</b> <b>CORE</b>, which causes it to use core  Hamiltonian  eigenvector
              to start the calculation; (2) <b>GUESS</b> <b>=</b> <b>AUTO</b> which results in an attempt to use the MO vector in the
              checkpoint  file, or resorts to core guess if there is no eigenvector in that file. The default if
              <b>AUTO</b>.

       <b>IPRINT</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              This is a print option.  The default is 0.

       <b>MO_OUT</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Prints out the orbitals with symmetry and occupations at the end of the calculation.   Default  is
              true.

       <b>ROTATE</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              The  molecular  orbitals  will  not  be  rotated  if this is false.  The rotation only affects the
              virtual orbitals for open shell systems.  This parameter must be true for correlated gradients and
              it must be false for second and higher derivatives.  The default is false if <b>WFN</b> <b>=</b>  <b>SCF</b>  and  true
              otherwise.

       <b>CHECK_ROT</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Check  the  molecular  orbital  rotation  described  above  to  ensure  that no columns of the SCF
              eigenvector matrix are swapped by the rotation.  Has no effect if <b>ROTATE</b> <b>=</b> <b>false</b>.  The default  is
              true.

       <b>CHECK_MO_ORTHOGONALITY</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              Check if the molecular orbitals are orthonormal. Useful for debugging only.  The default is false.

       <b>DIIS</b> <b>=</b> <u>boolean</u>
              This determines whether diis will be used.  The default is true.

       <b>DIISSTART</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              This gives the first iteration for which DIIS will be used.  The default is 0.

       <b>NDIIS</b> <b>=</b> <u>integer</u>
              This gives the number of error matrices to use in the diis procedure.  The default is 6 for closed
              shell, 4 for open shell, and 3 for tcscf.

       <b>DIISDAMP</b> <b>=</b> <u>real</u>
              This  gives  the damping factor for the diis procedure.  The default is 0.0 for closed shell, 0.02
              for open shell, and 0.01 for tcscf.

       <b>INCR</b> <b>=</b> <u>real</u>
              This is used in tcscf to determine how often the ci coefficients are recalculated.  A small number
              (~0.25) will cause them to be recalculated nearly every scf iteration.  The default is 0.25.

       <b>DYN_ACC</b> <b>=</b>  <u>boolean</u>
              When performing direct scf this specifies whether dynamic integral accuracy cutoffs will be  used.
              Default  is  true (use dynamic cutoffs).  Initial iterations are performed with integrals accurate
              to six digits.  After density is converged to 10^-5 or 30 iterations are completed, full  integral
              accuracy  is  used.   If  scf  convergence  problems  are experienced disabling dynamic cutoffs by
              setting this variable to false might help.

       <b>ORTHOG_ONLY</b> <b>=</b>  <u>boolean</u>
              Sometimes in CASSCF or  other  non-HF/KS  schemes  for  orbital  optimization,  it  is  useful  to
              reorthogonalize  MO's  from  other  geometries  for the current geometry so they can be used as an
              initial guess for the new MO's.  This can be performed by running CSCF with  <b>ORTHOG_ONLY</b>  <b>=</b>  <b>true</b>.
              After  the  orbitals  are  orthogonalized,  the  program  will  quit  without  performing  an  SCF
              computation.  This keyword will be ignored if there are no previous  orbitals  in  the  checkpoint
              file.  Defaults to <b>true</b> if <b>WFN</b> <b>=</b> <b>DETCAS</b>.

                                                  30 May, 1991                                           <u><a href="../man1/cscf.1.html">cscf</a></u>(1)
