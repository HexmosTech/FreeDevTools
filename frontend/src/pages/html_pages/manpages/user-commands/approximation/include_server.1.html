</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       include_server.py - conservative approximation of include dependencies for C/C++

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>include_server</b> --port <u>INCLUDE_SERVER_PORT</u> <u>[OPTIONS]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       include_server.py  starts an include server process.  This process answers queries from <b><a href="../man1/distcc.1.html">distcc</a></b>(1) clients
       about what files to include in C/C++ compilations. The include_server.py  command  itself  terminates  as
       soon as the include server has been spawned.

       The  INCLUDE_SERVER_PORT  argument  is  the  name  of  a socket used for all communication between distcc
       clients and the include server.  The <b><a href="../man1/distcc-pump.1.html">distcc-pump</a></b>(1)  command  is  responsible  for  creating  the  socket
       location,  for  passing  it  to this script, and for passing it to all distcc clients via the environment
       variable named INCLUDE_SERVER_PORT.

       The protocol used by the include server uses distcc's RPC implementation. Each distcc request consists of
       (1) the current directory and (2) the list of arguments of the compilation command.

       If the include server is able to process the request, then it answers the distcc client by sending a list
       of filepaths.  The filepaths are those of the compressed source and header files found  to  be  necessary
       for  compilation  through  include analysis.  The list also comprises symbolic links and even dummy files
       needed for the compilation server to construct an accurate replica of the parts of the filesystem  needed
       for  compilation.   In this way, a needed header file like /path/foo.h is compressed, renamed, and stored
       in a temporary location, such  as  /dev/shm/tmpiAvfGv.include_server-9368-1/path/foo.h.lzo.   The  distcc
       client  will  pass  these  files  on to a compilation server, where they will be uncompressed and mounted
       temporarily.

       If the include server is not able to process the request, then it returns the empty list  to  the  distcc
       client.

       There are two kinds of failures that relate to the include server. The include server may fail to compute
       the  includes  or  fail in other ways, see section <b>INCLUDE</b> <b>SERVER</b> <b>SYMPTOMS</b>.  Also, the compilation on the
       remove server may fail due to inadequacy of the calculated include closure, but then succeed when locally
       retried, see section <b>DISTCC</b> <b>DISCREPANCY</b> <b>SYMPTOMS</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTION</b> <b>SUMMARY</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are understood by include_server.py.

       <b>-dPAT,</b> <b>--debug_pattern=PAT</b>
              Bit vector for turning on warnings and debugging
                  1 = warnings
                  2 = trace some functions
               other powers of two: see include_server/basics.py.

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--email</b>
              Send  email  to  'distcc-pump-errors'  or  if  defined,  the   value   of   environment   variable
              DISTCC_EMAILLOG_WHOM_TO_BLAME,  when  include  server gets in trouble.  The default is to not send
              email.

       <b>--email_bound</b> <b>NUMBER</b>
              Maximal number of emails to send (in addition to a final email). Default: 3.

       <b>--no-email</b>
              Do not send email. This is the default.

       <b>--path_observation_re=RE</b>
              Issue warning message whenever a filename is resolved to a realpath that is matched by  RE,  which
              is  a  regular  expression  in Python syntax.  This is useful for finding out where files included
              actually come from. Use RE="" to find them all.  Note: warnings must be enabled with at least -d1.

       <b>--pid_file</b> <b>FILEPATH</b>
              The pid of the include server is written to file FILEPATH. This allows a script such a <b>distcc-pump</b>
              to tear down the include server.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--statistics</b>
              Print information to stdout about include analysis.

       <b>--stat_reset_triggers=LIST</b>
              Flush stat caches when the timestamp of any filepath in LIST changes or the filepath comes  in  or
              out of existence.  LIST is a colon separated string of filepaths, possibly containing simple globs
              (as  allowed by Python's glob module). Print a warning whenever such a change happens (if warnings
              are enabled). This option allows limited exceptions to distcc-pump's normal assumption that source
              files are not modified during the build.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--time</b>
              Print elapsed, user, and system time to stderr.

       <b>--unsafe_absolute_includes</b>
              Do preprocessing on the compilation server even if includes of absolute filepaths are encountered.
              Normally the include-server will fall back on local  preprocessing  if  it  detects  any  absolute
              includes.   Thus, this flag is useful for preventing such fallbacks when the absolute includes are
              a false alarm, either because the absolute include is discarded during  preprocessing  or  because
              the absolutely included file exists on the compilation servers.

              More  precisely, with --unsafe_absolute_includes absolute includes are ignored for the purposes of
              gathering the include closure.  Using this option may lead to incorrect results  because  (1)  the
              header  may  actually  be  included on the compilation server and it may not be the same as on the
              client, (2) the include directives of the header are not further analyzed.

              The option is useful for compiling code that has such hardcoded absolute locations of header files
              inside  conditional  directives  (e.g.  "#ifdef")  that  render  the  includes  irrelevant.   More
              precisely,  these  includes  must be eliminated during preprocessing for the actual configuration.
              Then the question of existence of the header file is moot and the  remote  compilation  is  sound.
              This  is  often  the case if such includes are meant for unusual configurations different from the
              actual configuration.

       <b>--no_force_dirs</b>
              Do not force the creation of all directories used in an include path.  May improve performance for
              some cases, but will break builds which use  include  structures  like  "&lt;foo/../file.h&gt;"  without
              including other files in foo/.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verify</b>
              Verify that files in CPP closure are contained in closure calculated by include processor.

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--write_include_closure</b>
              Write  a  .d_approx file which lists all the included files calculated by the include server; with
              -x, additionally write the included files as calculated by CPP to a .d_exact file.

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--exact_analysis</b>
              Use CPP instead, do not omit system headers files.

</pre><h4><b>INCLUDE</b> <b>SERVER</b> <b>SYMPTOMS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       The most likely messages and warnings to come from the include processor are listed below.

       <b>Preprocessing</b> <b>locally.</b> <b>Include</b> <b>server</b> <b>not</b> <b>covering:</b> <b>Couldn't</b> <b>determine</b> <b>default</b> <b>system</b> <b>include</b> <b>directories</b>
              To determine the default system header directories, the include server runs the compiler once  for
              each  language  needed  during  its session. This message indicates that the compiler specified to
              distcc is not present on the client.

       <b>Preprocessing</b> <b>locally.</b> <b>Include</b> <b>server</b> <b>not</b> <b>covering:</b> <b>Bailing</b> <b>out</b> <b>because</b> <b>include</b> <b>server</b> <b>spent</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b>
       <b>...s</b> <b>user</b> <b>time</b> <b>handling</b> <b>request</b>
              In uncommon situations, the include server fails to analyze very  complicated  macro  expressions.
              The distcc client will use plain distcc mode.

       <b>Warning:</b> <b>Filepath</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>relative</b> <b>but</b> <b>isn't</b>
              The  include  server  does not accept absolute filepaths, such as <a href="file:/usr/include/stdio.h">/usr/include/stdio.h</a>, in include
              directives, because there is no guarantee that this header on the compilation server machine  will
              be the same as that on the client.  The include server gives up analyzing the include closure. The
              distcc client cannot use pump-mode.

              To   overcome   this  problem  in  a  not  always  reliable  way,  set  the  environment  variable
              INCLUDE_SERVER_ARGS='--unsafe_absolute_includes' when invoking the distcc-pump script to pass  the
              --unsafe_absolute_includes option to the include server.

       <b>Warning:</b> <b>Absolute</b> <b>filepath</b> <b>...</b> <b>was</b> <b>IGNORED</b>
              The  --unsafe_absolute_includes is in use.  This situation happens under the same circumstances as
              when "Filepath must be relative but isn't" is issued, but in this case the include will provide an
              answer to the distcc client.

       <b>Warning:</b> <b>Path</b> <b>'/PATH/FILE'</b> <b>changed/came</b> <b>into</b> <b>existence/no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exists</b>
              These warnings are issued when using stat reset triggers.  Because /PATH/FILE changed, the include
              server clears its caches; the new version of the file (or the lack  of  it)  renders  the  include
              analysis  invalid.  This message can usually be ignored; it does signify a somewhat precarious use
              of files by the build system.  It is recommended to fix the build system so  that  files  are  not
              rewritten.

       <b>Warning:</b> <b>For</b> <b>translation</b> <b>unit</b> <b>...,</b> <b>lookup</b> <b>of</b> <b>file</b> <b>...</b> <b>resolved</b> <b>to</b> <b>...</b> <b>whose</b> <b>realpath</b> <b>is</b> <b>...</b>
              This  warning  occurs  with  --path_observation_re when a new realpath matching a source or header
              file is observed.

</pre><h4><b>DISTCC</b> <b>DISCREPANCY</b> <b>SYMPTOMS</b></h4><pre>
       The interactions between the build system, distcc, and the include server is  somewhat  complex.  When  a
       distcc commands receives a failing compilation from the remote server it retries the compilation locally.
       This  section  discusses  the  causes  of  discrepancies between remote and local compilation.  These are
       flagged by the demotion message:

       <b>__________Warning:</b> <b>...</b> <b>pump-mode</b> <b>compilation(s)</b> <b>failed</b> <b>on</b> <b>server,</b> <b>but</b> <b>succeeded</b> <b>locally.</b>
       <b>__________Distcc-pump</b> <b>was</b> <b>demoted</b> <b>to</b> <b>plain</b> <b>mode.</b>  <b>See</b> <b>the</b> <b>Distcc</b>  <b>Discrepancy</b>  <b>Symptoms</b>  <b>section</b>  <b>in</b>  <b>the</b>
       <b><a href="../man1/include_server.1.html">include_server</a>(1)</b> <b>man</b> <b>page.</b>

       The  distcc-pump  script  issues  this  message at the end of the build. This means that for at least one
       distcc invocation a local  compilation  succeeded  after  the  remote  compilation  failed.  Each  distcc
       invocation for which such a discrepancy occurred in turn also issues a message such as:

       <b>Warning:</b> <b>remote</b> <b>compilation</b> <b>of</b> <b>'...'</b> <b>failed,</b> <b>retried</b> <b>locally</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>result.</b>

       The  demotion  makes  subsequent  distcc invocations use plain distcc mode.  Thus preprocessing will take
       place on the local machine for the remainder of the build.  This  technique  prevents  very  slow  builds
       where all compilations end up on the local machine after failing remotely.

       Of  course,  if  the local compilations fails after the remote failures, then the distcc invocation exits
       with the non-zero status of the local compilation. The error messages printed are also those of the local
       compilation.

       The fallback behavior for  distcc-pump  mode  to  local  compilation  can  be  disabled  by  setting  the
       environment  variable  DISTCC_FALLBACK  to  0,  which makes the distcc command fail as soon as the remote
       compilation has failed. This setting is very useful for debugging why the remote compilation went  wrong,
       because now the output from the server will be printed.

       Next we discuss the possible causes of discrepancies.

       <b>The</b> <b>user</b> <b>changed</b> <b>a</b> <b>source</b> <b>or</b> <b>header</b> <b>file</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>build.</b>
              This yields inconsistent results of course.

       <b>A</b> <b>source</b> <b>or</b> <b>header</b> <b>file</b> <b>changed</b> <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>build.</b>
              The    build   system   rewrites   a   file.    For   Linux   kernel   2.6,   this   happens   for
              'include/linux/compile.h' and 'include/asm/asm-offsets.h'. This condition is fixed by letting  the
              include  server  know  that  it  must  reset  its  caches when a stat of any of the files changes.
              Practically, this is done by gathering the files in a colon-separated list and  then  setting  the
              INCLUDE_SERVER_ARGS  environment  variable  when  invoking  the pump script, so that it passes the
              <b>--stat_reset_triggers</b> option; for example,

                 INCLUDE_SERVER_ARGS="--stat_reset_triggers=include/linux/compile.h:include/asm/asm-offsets.h"

       <b>A</b> <b>header</b> <b>file</b> <b>is</b> <b>potentially</b> <b>included,</b> <b>but</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>exist,</b> <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>then</b> <b>later</b> <b>included.</b>
              This occurs when some header foo.h includes another header file trick.h, but the trick.h file  has
              not  yet been generated and the inclusion is actually ignored because of preprocessing directives.
              The include server will probe for the  existence  of  trick.h,  because  it  overapproximates  all
              possible  ways directives actually evaluate. The file trick.h is determined not to exist. If it is
              later generated, and then really included, then the include server will falsely believe  that  the
              file  still  does  not  exist.   The solution to this problem is to make the build system generate
              trick.h before the first time any header file is included that  makes  a  syntactic  reference  to
              trick.h

       <b>The</b> <b>include</b> <b>server</b> <b>was</b> <b>started</b> <b>with</b> <b>--unsafe_absolute_includes</b>.
              This  is  a  problem  if  there  are  header files locally that do not exist remotely and that are
              actually used.  Such includes are often protected by conditional directives that evaluate so  that
              are actually used on only specific and often uncommon platforms. If you are not compiling for such
              a platform, then it may be correct to use <b>--unsafe_absolute_include</b>.

       <b>The</b> <b>include</b> <b>server</b> <b>has</b> <b>calculated</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>includes.</b>
              We do not know of such a situation.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       The  exit  code  of  include_server.py is usually 0. That the include server has been started properly is
       communicated through the existence of the pid_file.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISTCC_EMAILLOG_WHOM_TO_BLAME</b> The email address to use for include server automated emails.  The  default
       is 'distcc-pump-errors' (which is an email address that probably will not exist in your domain).

       Additionally, the invocation of the compiler may use additional environment variables.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  think  you  have found a distcc bug, please see the file <u>reporting-bugs.txt</u> in the documentation
       directory for information on how to report it.

       In distcc-pump mode, the include server is unable to handle certain very complicated computed includes as
       found in parts of the Boost library. The include server will time out and distcc  will  revert  to  plain
       mode.
