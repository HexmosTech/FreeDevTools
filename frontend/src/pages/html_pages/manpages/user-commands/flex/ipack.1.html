       ipack - Manipulate Flex files containing Shapes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ipack</b> <b>-c</b> <u>SCRIPT</u>

       <b>ipack</b> <b>-x</b> <u>SCRIPT</u>

       <b>ipack</b> <b>-u</b> <u>SCRIPT</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Flex  files containing Shapes are used for the storage visual elements by the games <u>Exult</u> supports. While
       <b><a href="../man1/expack.1.html">expack</a></b>(1) can operate on such files, using <b>ipack</b> is more comfortable. It can extract images from the Flex
       file directly into PNG-format, and create or update Flex files from a list of PNG files.

       The first parameter determines the mode of operation:

       <b>-c</b> Creation
              New Flex and palette files are created according to the instructions contained in the <u>SCRIPT</u> file.

       <b>-u</b> Update
              Works like Creation, but updates an existing Flex file.

       <b>-x</b> Extraction
              The contents of the Flex file described in the <u>SCRIPT</u> file are extracted as PNG is dissected  into
              its contents, as described in this script file.

   <b>Script</b> <b>File</b> <b>Format</b>
       Empty lines, and lines starting with a pound sign (<b>#</b>) are ignored.

       The  names  of  the  associated  Flex  archive  and  palette files are given in lines containing optional
       whitespace, one of the tokens <b>archive</b> or <b>palette</b>, whitespace, and the filename.

       Other lines define one shape each, and must begin with an image slot number, followed by a slash (<b>/</b>), the
       number of frames, a colon (<b>:</b>), and finally the PNG file specification.  The numbers may be  given  either
       in  decimal,  in  octal  prefixed  with  <b>0</b>;  or  in hexadecimal prefixed with <b>0x</b>.  The file specification
       consists of the filename <u>PREFIX</u>, optionally followed by a number and direction  in  brackets,  optionally
       followed by whitespace and the word <b>flat</b>.

       Per default, each shape corresponds to a number of PNG files (one for each frame) named <u>PREFIXnn</u><b>.png</b> with
       <u>nn</u>  replaced  by  the  frame  number. If the optional bracket expression is used in the specification the
       Shape corresponds to a single PNG file instead. This file contains all frames, each of which is  8  by  8
       pixels  in  size, arranged next to each other in a rectangular grid. The number in the bracket expression
       gives the size of this grid in the direction indicated. The direction can be either <b>down</b> or <b>across</b>.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ipack</b> <b>-c</b> <b>island.scr</b>
              Creates a Flex file and a palette file as specified by <b>island.scr</b>.

       <b>ipack</b> <b>-x</b> <b>island.scr</b>
              Extracts all components described in <b>island.scr</b> from the Flex file given therein.

   <b>Example</b> <b>script</b>
       # script file for island.flx
       archive island.flx
       # put the palette into this file
       palette island.pal
       # the zeroth image has 32 frames in the files
       # zero00.png to zero31.png
       0/32:zero
       # image 5 consists of 22 frames stored in file
       # five.png in a grid 5 frames across (which means
       # 5 rows of which the last holds only 2 frames)
       5/22:five(5 across) flat
       # image 4 consists of 12 frames stored in file
       # four.png in a 3 by 4 grid
       4/12:four(4 down) flat
       # images 1 to 3 are unspecified

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Tiled Shapes are currently extracted into multiple PNG files,  not  a  single  file  as  expected  during
       Create/Update.
