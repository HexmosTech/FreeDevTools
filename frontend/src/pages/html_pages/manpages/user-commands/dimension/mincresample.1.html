</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mincresample - resamples a minc file along new spatial dimensions

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mincresample</b> [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;infile&gt; &lt;outfile&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Mincresample</u> will resample a minc file along new spatial dimensions with new voxel positions. Each volume
       in  the  input file (given by the spatial dimensions xspace, yspace and zspace) is resampled according to
       the command-line options. Non-spatial dimensions are preserved  in  their  original  order,  but  spatial
       dimensions  can  be  re-ordered  to give transverse, sagittal or coronal images. The new voxel values are
       calculated using tri-linear, tri-cubic or nearest-neighbour interpolation.

</pre><h4><b>WORLD</b> <b>COORDINATES</b></h4><pre>
       World coordinates refer to millimetric coordinates relative to some physical origin (either  the  scanner
       or  some anatomical structure). Voxel coordinates are simply the indices into the image volume of a given
       voxel.  In order to specify appropriate resampling options,  it  is  necessary  to  understand  how  MINC
       coordinate conversions work.

       Each  dimension  of  a MINC image volume is specified by name - the spatial dimensions are xspace, yspace
       and zspace. The convention is that positive xspace coordinates run from the patient's left side to  right
       side,  positive yspace coordinates run from patient posterior to anterior and positive zspace coordinates
       run from inferior to superior. For each of these spatial dimensions, the world coordinate  conversion  is
       specified by a pair of attributes: step and start. The xspace world coordinate, for example is calculated
       using  x = v*step + start, where x is the x world coordinate and v is the voxel count (starting at zero).
       Thus the magnitude of the step attribute specifies the distance between voxels and the sign of  the  step
       attribute specifies the orientation of the axis.

       There  is  a  further  twist:  MINC files are allowed to have non-orthogonal axes with the dimensions not
       perfectly aligned with the named axis.  There can be a direction_cosine attribute  that  gives  the  true
       orientation of the axis. For example, normally the xspace dimension should line up with the world x axis,
       ie. direction cosine = (1,0,0); however, it is possible to have a direction cosine of (0.9, 0.43589, 0).

       These attributes (step, start and direction_cosines) provide a conversion from voxel coordinates to world
       coordinates.   Combined  with  a  number  of  elements  or samples along an axis, they provide a complete
       description of where the output sampling should be.   However,  when  we  are  resampling  data,  we  are
       frequently  interested in a change of world coordinates: from an MRI scanner's coordinate system to a PET
       scanner's coordinate system, for example, or from a volume in its acquisition space to coordinates  in  a
       standardized space. This change of world coordinates can be specified through the use of a transformation
       (.xfm) file. Thus, in general, the resampling involves three transformations: from the input file's voxel
       coordinates  to  its world coordinates (specified by the input file), from the input world coordinates to
       the output world coordinates (specified by the transformation file), and from  the  output  file's  world
       coordinates to its voxel coordinates (specified by command-line options).

       In  general,  direction  cosines  are rarely used - axis re-orientation is specified by a change of world
       coordinates (the transformation file).  As well, resampling positions (output world to voxel  conversion)
       are  often  specified  relative to a model file (ie. resample this file so that it looks like that file).
       Although there are many options for a complete specification of the transformation, one does not  usually
       need to specify more than a few of them.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Note  that  options  can  be  specified in abbreviated form (as long as they are unique) and can be given
       anywhere on the command line.

</pre><h4><b>General</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-2</b>     Create MINC 2.0 format output files.

       <b>-clobber</b>
              Overwrite an existing file.

       <b>-noclobber</b>
              Don't overwrite an existing file (default).

       <b>-verbose</b>
              Print out progress information for each slice computed (default).

       <b>-quiet</b> Do not print out progress information.

</pre><h4><b>Resampling</b> <b>specification</b></h4><pre>
       Options that give the output sampling (all of the following except <b>-transformation</b>)  are  parsed  in  the
       order  that  they  appear on the command line. Thus a command with <b>-like</b> <b>file.mnc</b> <b>-znelements</b> <b>34</b> <b>-zstep</b> <b>2</b>
       will give a sampling like that in file in <u>file.mnc</u> but with 34 samples at 2 mm along the <u>zspace</u> axis. The
       default sampling is taken from the input file, transformed according to any transformation.

       <b>-transformation</b> <u>file.xfm</u>
              Specify  a  file  giving  the  world  coordinate   transformation   (default   is   the   identity
              transformation).

       <b>-invert_transformation</b>
              Invert the transformation before using it.

       <b>-noinvert_transformation</b>
              Do no invert the transformation (default).

       <b>-tfm_input_sampling</b>
              Transform  the  input  sampling  (using the transform specified by <b>-transformation</b>) along with the
              data and use this as the default sampling (default).

       <b>-use_input_sampling</b>
              Use the input sampling as the default sampling, as is, without  transformation,  even  though  the
              data is being transformed (old behaviour).

       <b>-like</b> <u>file.mnc</u>
              Specify  a  model  file that gives the output world to voxel transformation and number of elements
              (ie. transform this file so that it looks like that one).

       <b>-standard_sampling</b>
              Set the sampling to standard  values  (start  =  0,  step  =  1,  direction  cosines  point  along
              appropriate axes).

       <b>-spacetype</b> <u>string</u>
              Set the name of the output space (usually <b>native____</b> or <b>talairach_</b>).

       <b>-talairach</b>
              Set the name of the output space to talairach_.

       <b>-units</b> <u>string</u>
              Set the units of the output space.

       <b>-origin</b> <u>ox</u> <u>oy</u> <u>oz</u>
              Specify  the  coordinate  of  the  first  voxel.  This  is  not the same as the start value if the
              direction cosines are non-standard. As well, the start is not just a perpendicular  projection  of
              the  origin  onto  the  axis, it is a parallel projection (as in a multi-dimensional parallelogram
              projection). The conversion is handled properly by this option.

       <b>-nelements</b> <u>nx</u> <u>ny</u> <u>nz</u>
              Number of elements along each of the world dimensions.

       <b>-xnelements</b> <u>nx</u>
              Number of elements along the xspace dimension.

       <b>-ynelements</b> <u>ny</u>
              Number of elements along the yspace dimension.

       <b>-znelements</b> <u>nz</u>

              Position of centre of first voxel along each of the world dimensions.

       <b>-xstart</b> <u>xstart</u>
              Position of centre of first voxel along the xspace dimension.

       <b>-ystart</b> <u>ystart</u>
              Position of centre of first voxel along the yspace dimension.

       <b>-zstart</b> <u>zstart</u>
              Position of centre of first voxel along the zspace dimension.

       <b>-dircos</b> <u>x1</u> <u>x2</u> <u>x3</u> <u>y1</u> <u>y2</u> <u>y3</u> <u>z1</u> <u>z2</u> <u>z3</u>
              Direction cosines for each of the world axes.

       <b>-xdircos</b> <u>x1</u> <u>x2</u> <u>x3</u>

       <b>-zdircos</b> <u>z1</u> <u>z2</u> <u>z3</u>
              Direction cosines for the zspace dimension.

</pre><h4><b>Dimension</b> <b>ordering</b></h4><pre>
       The default is to preserve the original dimension order.

       <b>-transverse</b>
              Write out transverse slices.

       <b>-sagittal</b>
              Write out sagittal slices.

       <b>-coronal</b>
              Write out coronal slices.

</pre><h4><b>Output</b> <b>data</b> <b>type</b> <b>and</b> <b>range</b></h4><pre>
       The default for type, sign and valid range is to use those of the input file. If type is specified,  then
       both sign and valid range are set to the default for that type. If sign is specified, then valid range is
       set to the default for the type and sign.

       <b>-byte</b>  Store output voxels in 8-bit integer format.

       <b>-short</b> Store output voxels in 16-bit integer format.

       <b>-int</b>   Store output voxels in 32-bit integer format.

       <b>-long</b>  Superseded by <b>-int</b>.

       <b>-float</b> Store output voxels in 32-bit floating point format.

       <b>-double</b>
              Store output voxels in 64-bit floating point format.

       <b>-signed</b>
              Write  out  values  as  signed  integers  (default for short and long). Ignored for floating point
              types.

       <b>-unsigned</b>
              Write out values as unsigned integers (default for byte). Ignored for floating point types.

       <b>-range</b> <u>min</u> <u>max</u>
              specifies the valid range of output voxel values. Default is the full range for the type and sign.
              This option is ignored for floating point values.

       <b>-keep_real_range</b>
              Preserve the real minimum and maximum from the input volume, so that values are scaled in the same
              way on output. This is particularly  useful  for  resampling  label  volumes  where  interpolating
              intensity values does not make sense.

       <b>-nokeep_real_range</b>
              Recompute the real minimum and maximum for each output slice. This is the default.

</pre><h4><b>Handling</b> <b>of</b> <b>undefined</b> <b>(invalid)</b> <b>voxel</b> <b>values</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-fill</b>  Output  voxels  that fall outside of the input volume have undefined values. When the <b>-fill</b> option
              is used, these voxels are given a value that is outside of the valid range (less  than  the  valid
              minimum, if the type, sign and valid range permit) so that they can be detected by other software.
              The values of these voxels are not included in the <u>image-max</u> and <u>image-min</u> variables.

       <b>-nofill</b>
              Use  a real/physical value (not voxel value) of zero for points outside of the input volume. These
              points are included in the calculation of the <u>image-max</u> and  <u>image-min</u>  variables.   This  is  the
              default.

       <b>-fillvalue</b> <u>fillvalue</u>
              Specifies  a  real/physical  value  (not  voxel value) for points outside of the input volume. The
              points are not included in the calculation of the <u>image-max</u> and <u>image-min</u> variables.

</pre><h4><b>Interpolation</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-trilinear</b>
              Do a tri-linear interpolation between voxels. The edges of the volume are at  the  centre  of  the
              first and last voxels of a dimension. This is the default.

       <b>-tricubic</b>
              Do  a  tri-cubic  interpolation  between  voxels. The edges of the volume are at the centre of the
              first and last voxels of a dimension.

       <b>-nearest_neighbour</b>
              Do nearest neighbour interpolation between voxels (ie. find the voxel closest to the point and use
              its value). The edges of the volume are at the edge of the first and last voxels  of  a  dimension
              (centre +/- half voxel separation).

       <b>-sinc</b>  Do  renormalized  windowed-sinc  interpolation between voxels, as described by Thacker et al. JMRI
              10:582-588 (1999).

       <b>-width</b> <u>n</u>
              Specifies the half-width of the sinc interpolation kernel, in the range from 1  to  10.  The  full
              sinc  kernel width is <u>n</u> * 2 + 1, and therefore varies from 3 to 21.  The default value is 5 giving
              a full-width of 11.

       <b>-hanning</b>
              Use a Hanning window with the sinc interpolant. This is the default.

       <b>-hamming</b>
              Use a Hamming window with the sinc interpolant.

</pre><h4><b>Generic</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-help</b>  Print summary of command-line options and exit.

       <b>-version</b>
              Print the program's version number and exit.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
