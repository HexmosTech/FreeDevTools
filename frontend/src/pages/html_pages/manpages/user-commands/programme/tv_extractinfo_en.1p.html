</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tv_extractinfo_en - read English-language listings and extract info from programme descriptions.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       tv_extractinfo_en [--help] [--output FILE] [FILE...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Read XMLTV data and attempt to extract information from English-language programme descriptions, putting
       it into machine-readable form.  For example the human-readable text '(repeat)' in a programme description
       might be replaced by the XML element &lt;previously-shown&gt;.

       <b>--output</b> <b>FILE</b> write to FILE rather than standard output

       This tool also attempts to split multipart programmes into their constituents, by looking for a
       description that seems to contain lots of times and titles.  But this depends on the description
       following one particular style and is useful only for some listings sources (Ananova).

       If some text is marked with the 'lang' attribute as being some language other than English ('en'), it is
       ignored.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Trying to parse human-readable text is always error-prone, more so with the simple regexp-based approach
       used here.  But because TV listing descriptions usually conform to one of a few set styles,
       tv_extractinfo_en does reasonably well.  It is fairly conservative, trying to avoid false positives
       (extracting 'information' which isn't really there) even though this means some false negatives (failing
       to extract information and leaving it in the human-readable text).

       However, the leftover bits of text after extracting information may not form a meaningful English
       sentence, or the punctuation may be wrong.

       On the two listings sources currently supported by the XMLTV package, this program does a reasonably good
       job.  But it has not been tested with every source of anglophone TV listings.
