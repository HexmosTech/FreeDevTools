</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tv_remove_some_overlapping - Remove some overlapping programmes from XMLTV data.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       tv_remove_some_overlapping [--help] [--output FILE] [FILE...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Read one or more XMLTV files and write a file to standard output containing the same data, except that
       some 'magazine' programmes which seem to contain two or more other programmes are removed.

       For example, if 'Schools TV' runs from 10:00 to 12:00, and there are two programmes 'History' from 10:00
       to 11:00 and 'Geography' from 11:00 to 12:00 on the same channel, then 'Schools TV' could be removed.  A
       programme is removed only if there are two or more other programmes which partition its timeslot, which
       implies that it and these other programmes must have stop times specified.

       To avoid throwing away any real programmes, no programme will be discarded if it has content data other
       than title and URL.

       Filtering this tool won't remove all overlapping programmes but it will deal with the 'big magazine
       programme containing smaller programmes' data commonly seen from listings sources.

       <b>--output</b> <b>FILE</b> write to FILE rather than standard output
