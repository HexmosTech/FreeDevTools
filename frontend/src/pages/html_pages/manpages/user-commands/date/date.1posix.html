</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       date — write the date and time

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       date <b>[</b>-u<b>]</b> <b>[</b>+<u>format</u><b>]</b>

       date <b>[</b>-u<b>]</b> <u>mmddhhmm</u><b>[[</b><u>cc</u><b>]</b><u>yy</u><b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>date</u>  utility shall write the date and time to standard output or attempt to set the system date and
       time.  By default, the current date and time shall be written.  If  an  operand  beginning  with  <b>'+'</b>  is
       specified,  the output format of <u>date</u> shall be controlled by the conversion specifications and other text
       in the operand.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>date</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>12.2</u>,  <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following option shall be supported:

       <b>-u</b>        Perform  operations  as  if  the  <u>TZ</u>  environment variable was set to the string <b>"UTC0"</b>, or its
                 equivalent historical value of <b>"GMT0"</b>.  Otherwise, <u>date</u> shall use the timezone indicated by the
                 <u>TZ</u> environment variable or the system default if that variable is unset or null.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       +<u>format</u>   When the format is specified, each conversion specifier  shall  be  replaced  in  the  standard
                 output  by  its corresponding value. All other characters shall be copied to the output without
                 change. The output shall always be terminated with a &lt;newline&gt;.

                 See  the  Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>7.3.5</u>, <u>LC_TIME</u> for the conversion
                 specifier values in the POSIX locale.

   <b>Modified</b> <b>Conversion</b> <b>Specifications</b>
       Some conversion specifiers can be modified by the <b>E</b> and <b>O</b> modifier characters  to  indicate  a  different
       format  or  specification as specified in the <u>LC_TIME</u> locale description (see the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>7.3.5</u>, <u>LC_TIME</u>).  If the corresponding keyword (see  <b>era</b>,  <b>era_year</b>,  <b>era_d_fmt</b>,
       and  <b>alt_digits</b>  in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>7.3.5</u>, <u>LC_TIME</u>) is not specified
       or not supported for the current locale, the unmodified conversion specifier value shall be used.

                 Attempt  to  set  the  system  date  and time from the value given in the operand. This is only
                 possible if the user has appropriate privileges and the  system  permits  the  setting  of  the
                 system  date  and  time.  The first <u>mm</u> is the month (number); <u>dd</u> is the day (number); <u>hh</u> is the
                 hour (number, 24-hour system); the second <u>mm</u> is the minute (number); <u>cc</u> is the century  and  is
                 the  first two digits of the year (this is optional); <u>yy</u> is the last two digits of the year and
                 is optional. If century is not specified, then values in the range [69,99] shall refer to years
                 1969 to 1999 inclusive, and values in the range [00,68] shall  refer  to  years  2000  to  2068
                 inclusive. The current year is the default if <u>yy</u> is omitted.

                 <b>Note:</b>     It is expected that in a future version of this standard the default century inferred
                           from  a  2-digit  year  will  change.  (This  would apply to all commands accepting a
                           2-digit year as input.)

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>date</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>LC_TIME</u>   Determine the format and contents of date and time strings written by <u>date</u>.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>TZ</u>        Determine  the  timezone  in  which  the  time  and  date  are written, unless the <b>-u</b> option is
                 specified. If the <u>TZ</u> variable is unset or null and <b>-u</b> is not specified, an  unspecified  system
                 default timezone is used.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       When  no  formatting  operand  is  specified,  the  output  in  the  POSIX  locale shall be equivalent to
       specifying:

           date "+%a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y"

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    The date was written successfully.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Conversion specifiers are of unspecified format when not in the POSIX locale. Some of  them  can  contain
       &lt;newline&gt;  characters  in some locales, so it may be difficult to use the format shown in standard output
       for parsing the output of <u>date</u> in those locales.

       The range of values for <b>%S</b> extends from 0 to 60 seconds to accommodate the occasional leap second.

       Although certain of the conversion specifiers in the POSIX locale (such as the name  of  the  month)  are
       shown  with  initial  capital  letters,  this need not be the case in other locales. Programs using these
       fields may need to adjust the capitalization if the output is going to be used  at  the  beginning  of  a
       sentence.

       The  date string formatting capabilities are intended for use in Gregorian-style calendars, possibly with
       a different starting year (or years). The <b>%x</b> and <b>%c</b> conversion specifications, however, are intended  for
       local representation; these may be based on a different, non-Gregorian calendar.

       The  <b>%C</b>  conversion specification was introduced to allow a fallback for the <b>%EC</b> (alternative year format
       base year); it can be viewed as the base of the  current  subdivision  in  the  Gregorian  calendar.  The
       century  number  is  calculated  as the year divided by 100 and truncated to an integer; it should not be
       confused with the use of ordinal numbers for centuries (for example, ``twenty-first century''.) Both  the
       <b>%Ey</b> and <b>%y</b> can then be viewed as the offset from <b>%EC</b> and <b>%C</b>, respectively.

       The <b>E</b> and <b>O</b> modifiers modify the traditional conversion specifiers, so that they can always be used, even
       if the implementation (or the current locale) does not support the modifier.

       The  <b>E</b>  modifier  supports alternative date formats, such as the Japanese Emperor's Era, as long as these
       are based on the Gregorian calendar system. Extending the <b>E</b> modifiers to other date elements may  provide
       an  implementation-defined  extension  capable  of  supporting  other  calendar  systems,  especially  in
       combination with the <b>O</b> modifier.

       The <b>O</b> modifier supports time and date formats using the locale's alternative numerical symbols,  such  as
       Kanji or Hindi digits or ordinal number representation.

       Non-European locales, whether they use Latin digits in computational items or not, often have local forms
       of  the  digits  for  use in date formats. This is not totally unknown even in Europe; a variant of dates
       uses Roman numerals for the months: the third day of September 1991 would be  written  as  3.IX.1991.  In
       Japan,  Kanji  digits  are regularly used for dates; in Arabic-speaking countries, Hindi digits are used.
       The <b>%d</b>, <b>%e</b>, <b>%H</b>, <b>%I</b>, <b>%m</b>, <b>%S</b>, <b>%U</b>, <b>%w</b>, <b>%W</b>, and <b>%y</b> conversion specifications always return the date and  time
       field  in  Latin  digits (that is, 0 to 9). The <b>%O</b> modifier was introduced to support the use for display
       purposes of non-Latin digits. In the <u>LC_TIME</u> category in <u>localedef</u>, the optional  <b>alt_digits</b>  keyword  is
       intended for this purpose. As an example, assume the following (partial) <u>localedef</u> source:

           alt_digits  "";"I";"II";"III";"IV";"V";"VI";"VII";"VIII" \
                       "IX";"X";"XI";"XII"
           d_fmt       "%e.%Om.%Y"

       With the above date, the command:

           date "+%x"

       would yield 3.IX.1991. With the same <b>d_fmt</b>, but without the <b>alt_digits</b>, the command would yield 3.9.1991.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        1. The following are input/output examples of <u>date</u> used at arbitrary times in the POSIX locale:

               <b>$</b> date

               <b>$</b> date "+TIME: %r"
               <b>TIME:</b> <b>01:36:32</b> <b>PM</b>

        2. Examples for Denmark, where the default date and time format is <b>%a</b> <b>%d</b> <b>%b</b> <b>%Y</b> <b>%T</b> <b>%Z</b>:

               <b>HEURE:</b> <b>15:03:56</b>

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       Some of the new options for formatting are from the ISO C standard. The <b>-u</b> option was introduced to allow
       portable  access  to  Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  The string <b>"GMT0"</b> is allowed as an equivalent <u>TZ</u>
       value to be compatible with  all  of  the  systems  using  the  BSD  implementation,  where  this  option
       originated.

       The  <b>%e</b>  format  conversion  specification  (adopted  from System V) was added because the ISO C standard
       conversion specifications did not provide any way to produce the historical default  <u>date</u>  output  during
       the first nine days of any month.

       There  are  two varieties of day and week numbering supported (in addition to any others created with the
       locale-dependent <b>%E</b> and <b>%O</b> modifier characters):

        *  The historical variety in which Sunday is the first day of the week and the  weekdays  preceding  the
           first  Sunday  of  the  year are considered week 0. These are represented by <b>%w</b> and <b>%U</b>.  A variant of
           this is <b>%W</b>, using Monday as the first day of the week, but still referring to week 0.  This  view  of
           the calendar was retained because so many historical applications depend on it and the ISO C standard
           <u>strftime</u>() function, on which many <u>date</u> implementations are based, was defined in this way.

        *  The international standard, based on the ISO 8601:2004 standard where Monday is the first weekday and
           the  algorithm  for  the first week number is more complex: If the week (Monday to Sunday) containing
           January 1 has four or more days in the new year, then it is week 1; otherwise, it is week 53  of  the
           previous  year,  and  the  next  week  is  week  1.  These  are  represented  by  the  new conversion
