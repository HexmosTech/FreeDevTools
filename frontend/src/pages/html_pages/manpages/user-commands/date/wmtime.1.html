</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       wmtime - Window Maker dockapp that displays the time and date

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>wmtime</b> [ <u>OPTION</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>WMTime</b>  displays  the  time  and date and gives you some nice additional features too. It is intended for
       docking in Window Maker.

       It currently provides:

       •   the time and date;

       •   a realtime morphing interface (analog &lt;&gt; digital mode);

       •   auto-scaled and anti-aliased hands;

       •   localization, displaying the day and date in various languages;

       •   three user-defined commands to launch.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b>, <b>-digital</b>
              Display the digital clock on startup, instead of the analog clock.

       <b>-display</b> <u>display</u>
              This option specifies the X server to contact; see <u><a href="../man7x/X.7x.html">X</a>(7x)</u>.

       <b>-geometry</b> <u>geometry</u>
              This option specifies the preferred position of clock; see <u><a href="../man7x/X.7x.html">X</a>(7x)</u>.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>-noseconds</b>
              Disables the second hand.

       <b>-l</b> <u>locale</u>
              Specify locale.

       <b>-h</b>     Show help information.

       <b>-v</b>     Print the version number.

       <b>-c</b>     Set color.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>WMTime</b> window is separated into top and bottom sections.  The top section contains a  clock  and  the
       bottom section contains the date.

       The  clock  can  be toggled between analog and digital modes.  To do this, click in the bottom section of
       the window.

       WMTime can also be used to launch programs.  You may click either left, middle, or right mouse buttons in
       the top section of the window.  The pre-configured program will be launched according to the mouse button
       clicked.  (see <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b> below.)

       In order to move <b>WMTime</b>, drag on the outer edges.  These are not sensitive to mouse clicks.

</pre><h4><b>DOCKING</b> <b>IN</b> <b>WINDOW</b> <b>MANAGERS</b></h4><pre>
       Window Maker

              Window Maker users should drag and drop the <b>WMTime</b> window on the Dock.  Then, right-click  on  the
              border of the window and select “Settings...”.  Check “Start when Window Maker is started”.

       AfterStep

              AfterStep users should put the following in their <u>$HOME/.steprc</u>

                       Wharf wmtime - MaxSwallow "wmtime" wmtime &amp;

       Other window managers

              <b>WMTime</b> runs nicely as a 64x64 shaped icon on your desktop.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>WMTime</b>  can  launch three user-defined commands, triggered by left, middle and right mouse button clicks.
       You can define the commands to launch in <u>$HOME/.wmtimerc</u>

              left: xterm
              middle: xload
              right: xcalc
       If <b>WMTime</b> detects a <u>$HOME/.wmtimerc</u> file, it will launch the appropriate command when you  click  on  the
       clock.

       The system administrator can define default commands in <u>/etc/wmtimerc</u>.  The administrator may also choose
       to “fix” particular commands, making it impossible for users to change.  These commands can be defined in
       <u>/etc/wmtimerc.fixed</u>, although this isn't a nice thing to do.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/wmtimerc</u>
       <u>$HOME/.wmtimerc</u>
       <u>/etc/wmtimerc.fixed</u>
