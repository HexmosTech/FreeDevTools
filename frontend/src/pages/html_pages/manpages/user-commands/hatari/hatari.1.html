</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       hatari - Atari ST/STE/TT/Falcon emulator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hatari</b> [options] [directory|diskimage|program]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Hatari  is  an Atari ST/STE/TT/Falcon emulator for Linux and other Systems which are supported by the SDL
       (cross-platform graphics, input and sound) library.

       With Hatari one can run games, demos or applications written for Atari  ST,  STE  or  Falcon.   Atari  TT
       support  is  experimental.  Hatari supports the commonly used *.st, *.msa and *.stx disk images, and hard
       disk emulation.

       To run the emulator a TOS ROM image is needed. EmuTOS, a free  implementation  of  TOS  is  shipped  with
       Hatari.  It  boots faster than original TOS versions and doesn't need separate HD drivers, but some buggy
       (typically floppy only) programs won't work correctly with it.  For best compatibility, it is recommended
       to use a TOS ROM from a real Atari.

       As an argument, one can give either a name of a directory that should be emulated  as  a  virtual  GEMDOS
       hard  disk,  a  floppy  disk  image or an Atari program that should be autostarted.  In the last case the
       program's directory will be used as the C:  drive  from  where  this  program  will  be  started.   These
       shortcuts correspond to "-d &lt;dir&gt;", "--disk-a &lt;floppy image&gt;" and "-d &lt;dir&gt; --auto C:\&lt;program&gt;" options.

       Booting will be done from the disk image or directory that's given last on the command line, either as an
       option or an argument (and which corresponds to A: or C:).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Hatari options are split into several categories:

</pre><h4><b>General</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print command line options and terminate

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Print version information and terminate

       <b>--confirm-quit</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Whether Hatari confirms quitting

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--configfile</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Read  additional  configuration values from &lt;file&gt;, these override values read from the global and
              user configuration files

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--keymap</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Load keyboard mapping from &lt;file&gt;. "Symbolic" mapping will  be  used  as  fallback  for  keys  not
              defined there

       <b>--country</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Set  EmuTOS  ROM  country  code  on  Mega/ST/STe  machines  lacking  NVRAM,  when EmuTOS indicates
              supporting multiple ones.

              In 512k EmuTOS images, country code selects the TOS keyboard layout and screen refresh (US =  60Hz
              NTSC,  50Hz  PAL  otherwise).   In 1024k EmuTOS images (coming with Hatari binaries and supporting
              multiple languages), country code selects also TOS language.

              Alternatively, one can use "tos-lang-change" tool from EmuTOS project to modify  country  code  in
              the ROM image file itself. That works also for TOS v4

       <b>--layout</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Set  NVRAM  keyboard  layout  value. While both TT and Falcon machines have NVRAM, only TOS v4 and
              EmuTOS 512k / 1024k ROM versions support multiple layouts.

              Regardless of whether keyboard layout change is  done  through  the  ROM  country  code  or  NVRAM
              setting,  it may impact your key mappings in Hatari key mapping files, Hatari Python UI arguments,
              or key injection in your automation scripts for Hatari debugger, command FIFO or hconsole tool

       <b>--language</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Set NVRAM language value. While both TT and Falcon machines have NVRAM, only  TOS  v4  and  EmuTOS
              1024k  ROM  versions  support  multiple  languages.   Default  is  taken from the LANG environment
              variable

       <b>--fast-forward</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Fast-forward through the boring parts by running emulator at  maximum  speed.   Done  by  skipping
              frame  update  VBL waits. Upper limit for frame skipping is given with the --frameskips option and
              shown in statusbar "FS" field

       <b>--auto</b> <b>&lt;program&gt;</b>
              Autostarts given program, if TOS finds it.  Program needs to be given with full path it will  have
              under  emulation, for example "C:\DIR\PROGRAM.PRG". This is implemented by providing TOS a virtual
              INF file for the boot drive (A: or C:), which tells TOS to start the given program

</pre><h4><b>Common</b> <b>display</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-m,</b> <b>--mono</b>
              Start in monochrome mode instead of color

       <b>--monitor</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Select monitor type (x = mono/rgb/vga/tv)

       <b>--tos-res</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Select TOS resolution for color monitors (x = low/med/high/ttlow/ttmed)

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--fullscreen</b>
              Start the emulator in fullscreen mode

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--window</b>
              Start the emulator in windowed mode

       <b>--grab</b> Grab mouse (also) in windowed mode

       <b>--resizable</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Allow window resizing

       <b>--borders</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Show ST/STE/Falcon screen borders (for low/med resolution overscan demos)

       <b>--frameskips</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Skip &lt;x&gt; frames after each displayed frame to accelerate emulation (0=disabled, &gt;4 uses  automatic
              frameskip with given value as maximum)

       <b>--slowdown</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Slow down emulation by factor of x (used as multiplier for VBL wait time)

       <b>--mousewarp</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              To  keep  host  mouse  better in sync with Atari mouse pointer, center it to Hatari window on cold
              reset and resolution changes

       <b>--statusbar</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Show statusbar (with floppy leds etc etc)

       <b>--drive-led</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Show overlay drive led when statusbar isn't shown

       <b>--max-width</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Preferred / maximum Hatari screen width

       <b>--max-height</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Preferred / maximum Hatari screen height.

              Maximum width and height options are part of Hatari's Atari monitor emulation. They limit the size
              Hatari should aim for its internal SDL framebuffer, and how much of the Atari screen  borders  are
              visible.

              The  framebuffer  is  then  scaled  to the Hatari output window based on the specified Hatari zoom
              factor (see below).

              Aim of this is to have all resolutions show up in approximately same size, like on  a  real  Atari
              monitor.  Hatari's  internal  integer  scaling support sets some limits on this, so it's an expert
              option.

              Note: Only reason to change the defaults, should be limiting this  to  a  smaller  resolution  for
              performance  reasons, e.g. for video recording, or on really underpowered systems, to make monitor
              do all of the ST-low resolution scaling by forcing Hatari to ask SDL for CGA / QVGA resolution.

       <b>-z,</b> <b>--zoom</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              This option overrides max width/height options so that e.g. ST-low resolution gets always doubled,
              and all resolutions (except TT-high) have approximately the same size, like on a real CRT monitor.

              Zoom factor is then used to scale that up (or down) to the Hatari output window.  This way scaling
              results always in approximately same sized Hatari window.

              With non-integer zoom factors, linear scaling is used to smooth out the output, with integer  zoom
              factors,  scaling  is done using nearest neighboring pixels for sharper output.  This applies also
              to window resizes.

              To avoid zooming of low resolutions, use "--zoom 1 --max-width 416 --max-height 276" (if you don't
              need borders, 320x200 size is enough).   Disabling  low  resolution  doubling  like  this  is  not
              recommended  for  Falcon  emulation  because  TOS  v4  bootup  and  some  demos switch resolutions
              frequently.

       <b>--bpp</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Force internal bitdepth (x = 8/15/16/32, 0=disable)

       <b>--disable-video</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Run emulation without displaying video (audio only)

</pre><h4><b>ST/STE</b> <b>specific</b> <b>display</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--spec512</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Hatari uses this threshold to decide when to render a screen with the  slower  but  more  accurate
              Spectrum512 screen conversion functions (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 512, 0=disable)

       <b>--video-timing</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Wakeup  State for MMU/GLUE (x=ws1/ws2/ws3/ws4/random, default ws3). When powering on, the STF will
              randomly choose one of these wake up states. The state will then affect the timings  where  border
              removals  and  other  video tricks should be made, which can give different results on screen. For
              example, WS3 is known to be compatible with many demos, while WS1 can show more problems.

</pre><h4><b>TT/Falcon</b> <b>specific</b> <b>display</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       Zooming to sizes specified below is internally done  using  integer  scaling  factors.  This  means  that
       different Atari resolutions may show up with different sizes, but they are never blurry.

       <b>--desktop</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Whether  to  use desktop resolution on fullscreen to avoid issues related to resolution switching.
              Otherwise fullscreen will use a resolution that is closest to the Hatari window size.  (enabled by
              default)

       <b>--force-max</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Hatari window size is forced  to  specified  maximum  size  and  black  borders  used  when  Atari
              resolution  doesn't scale evenly to it.  This is most useful when recording videos of Falcon demos
              that change their resolution. (disabled by default)

       <b>--aspect</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Whether to do monitor aspect ratio correction (enabled by default)

</pre><h4><b>VDI</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--vdi</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Whether to use VDI screen mode.   Doesn't  work  with  TOS  v4.  TOS  v3  memory  detection  isn't
              compatible  with  larger  VDI  modes  (i.e.  you need to skip the detection at boot). Original TOS
              desktops use wrong window size in 2-plane (4 color) VDI mode when screen  height  &gt;=  400  pixels.
              Because of these issues, using EmuTOS is recommended for VDI mode

       <b>--vdi-planes</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Use extended VDI resolution with bit depth &lt;x&gt; (x = 1, 2 or 4)

       <b>--vdi-width</b> <b>&lt;w&gt;</b>
              Use extended VDI resolution with width &lt;w&gt; (320 &lt; w &lt;= 2048)

       <b>--vdi-height</b> <b>&lt;h&gt;</b>
              Use extended VDI resolution with height &lt;h&gt; (160 &lt; h &lt;= 1280)

       Because  TOS  and  popular  GEM  programs  have  problems  with  certain  screen  sizes,  Hatari enforces
       restrictions on VDI screen size.  In total VDI screen size is limited to 32-300kB, width to  multiple  of
       16/planes,  and height to multiple of 8 pixels (smaller system font height). That translates to following
       maximum standard resolutions for the VDI mode:

       <b>monochrome</b>
              FullHD (1920x1080), WUXGA (1920x1200) and QWXGA (2048x1152)

       <b>2</b> <b>plane</b> <b>mode</b> <b>(4</b> <b>colors)</b>
              HD (1280x720), WXGA (1280x768) and XGA+ (1152x864)

       <b>4</b> <b>plane</b> <b>mode</b> <b>(16-colors)</b>
              qHD (960x540), DVGA (960x640) and WSVGA (1024x600)

</pre><h4><b>Screen</b> <b>capture</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--crop</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Remove statusbar from the screen captures

       <b>--avirecord</b>
              Start AVI recording.  Note: recording will automatically stop when emulation resolution changes.

       <b>--avi-vcodec</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Select AVI video codec (x =  bmp/png).   PNG  compression  can  be  <u>much</u>  slower  than  using  the
              uncompressed BMP format, but uncompressed video content takes huge amount of space.

       <b>--png-level</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Select  PNG  compression  level  for  AVI  video (x = 0-9).  Both compression efficiency and speed
              depend on the compressed screen content. Highest compression level (9) can  be  <u>really</u>  slow  with
              some content. Levels 3-6 should compress nearly as well with clearly smaller CPU overhead.

       <b>--avi-fps</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Force AVI frame rate (x = 50/60/71/...)

       <b>--avi-file</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Use &lt;file&gt; to record AVI

       <b>--screenshot-dir</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              Save screenshots in the directory &lt;dir&gt;

</pre><h4><b>Devices</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-j,</b> <b>--joystick</b> <b>&lt;port&gt;</b>
              Emulate joystick with cursor keys in given port (0-5)

       <b>--joy&lt;port&gt;</b> <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>
              Set joystick type (none/keys/real) for given port

       <b>--printer</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Enable printer support and write data to &lt;file&gt;

       <b>--midi</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Whether to enable MIDI device support (when Hatari is built with PortMidi support)

       <b>--midi-in</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Enable MIDI support and write raw MIDI data to &lt;file&gt; (when not built with PortMidi support)

       <b>--midi-out</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Enable MIDI support and read raw MIDI data from &lt;file&gt; (when not built with PortMidi support)

       <b>--rs232-in</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Enable MFP serial port support and use &lt;file&gt; as the input device

       <b>--rs232-out</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Enable MFP serial port support and use &lt;file&gt; as the output device

       <b>--scc-a-in</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Enable  SCC  channel A serial port support and use &lt;file&gt; for the input (only for Mega-STE, TT and
              Falcon)

       <b>--scc-a-out</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Enable SCC channel A serial port support and use &lt;file&gt; for the output (only for Mega-STE, TT  and

              Enable SCC channel A LAN port support and use &lt;file&gt; for the output (only for Mega-STE and TT)

       <b>--scc-b-in</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Enable  SCC  channel B serial port support and use &lt;file&gt; for the input (only for Mega-STE, TT and
              Falcon)

       <b>--scc-b-out</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Enable SCC channel B serial port support and use &lt;file&gt; for the output (only for Mega-STE, TT  and

</pre><h4><b>Floppy</b> <b>drive</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--drive-a</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Enable/disable drive A (default is on)

       <b>--drive-b</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Enable/disable drive B (default is on)

       <b>--drive-a-heads</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Set number of heads for drive A (1=single sided, 2=double sided)

       <b>--drive-b-heads</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Set number of heads for drive B (1=single sided, 2=double sided)

       <b>--disk-a</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Set disk image for floppy drive A

       <b>--disk-b</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Set disk image for floppy drive B

       <b>--fastfdc</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              speed up FDC emulation (can cause incompatibilities)

       <b>--protect-floppy</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Write  protect  floppy  image  contents  (on/off/auto).  With  "auto"  option  write protection is
              according to the disk image file attributes

</pre><h4><b>Hard</b> <b>drive</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d,</b> <b>--harddrive</b> <b>&lt;dir&gt;</b>
              GEMDOS HD emulation.  Emulate harddrive partition(s) with &lt;dir&gt; contents.  If  directory  contains
              only  single  letter  (C-Z)  subdirectories,  each  of  these  subdirectories will be treated as a
              separate partition, otherwise the given directory itself will be assigned to drive  "C:".  In  the
              multiple  partition  case,  the  letters  used  as  the subdirectory names will determine to which
              drives/partitions they are assigned. If &lt;dir&gt; is an empty string, then  harddrive's  emulation  is
              disabled

       <b>--protect-hd</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Write  protect  harddrive  &lt;dir&gt;  contents (on/off/auto). With "auto" option the protection can be
              controlled by setting individual files attributes as it disables the file attribute  modifications
              for the GEMDOS hard disk emulation

       <b>--gemdos-case</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Specify  whether  new  dir/filenames  are  forced  to be in upper or lower case with the GEMDOS HD
              emulation. Off/upper/lower, off by default

       <b>--gemdos-time</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Specify what file modification timestamps should be used, emulation internal (atari) ones, or ones
              from the machine (host) on which the machine is running. While Atari emulation and host clocks are
              in sync at Hatari startup, they will diverge while emulation is running,  especially  if  you  use
              fast  forward.  Default is "atari".  If you modify files accessed by the Atari side, directly from
              the host side while Hatari is already running, you may want to use "host" option

       <b>--gemdos-conv</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Whether GEMDOS file names with 8-bit (non-ASCII) characters are converted between Atari  and  host
              character  sets.  On  Linux,  host  file name character set is assumed to be UTF-8. This option is
              disabled by default, in case you have transferred files from Atari  machine  without  proper  file
              name conversion (e.g. by zipping them on Atari and unzipping on PC)

       <b>--gemdos-drive</b> <b>&lt;drive&gt;</b>

              Specify TOS ROM image to use

       <b>--patch-tos</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Use  this  option  to enable/disable TOS ROM patching. Experts only! Leave this enabled unless you

</pre><h4><b>CPU/FPU/bus</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--cpulevel</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Specify CPU (680x0) to use (use x &gt;= 1 with EmuTOS or TOS &gt;= 2.06 only!)

       <b>--cpuclock</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>

</pre><h4><b>Misc</b> <b>system</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--machine</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Select machine type (x = st, megast, ste, megaste, tt or falcon)

       <b>--blitter</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Enable blitter emulation (ST only)

       <b>--dsp</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Falcon DSP emulation (x = none, dummy or emu, Falcon only)

       <b>--vme</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Hatari  doesn't  have proper MegaSTE/TT VME emulation yet, but this controls access to related SCU
              registers (MegaSTE/TT only).

              With "dummy", (no-op) access is allowed (=VME HW), otherwise TOS v2 and  v3  crash  on  bootup  on
              MegaSTE and TT.  Supports VME tracing.

              With "none", register access causes errors (=no VME HW), which is needed for Linux to boot with TT
              emulation until there's full SCU interrupt support.  No VME tracing support.

       <b>--rtc-year</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              With  the  default  value  0,  RTC date and time are taken from the host.  If application does not
              handle current dates, this can be used to change RTC year to a  more  compatible  one.   See  also
              "--gemdos-time" option.

       <b>--timer-d</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Patch redundantly high Timer-D frequency set by TOS.  This can increase Hatari speed significantly
              (especially  for  ST/e  emulation)  as the original Timer-D frequency causes large amount of extra
              interrupts to emulate.

       <b>--fast-boot</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Patch TOS and initialize the so-called "memvalid" system variables to by-pass the memory  test  of
              TOS, so that the system boots faster.

</pre><h4><b>Sound</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--mic</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Enable/disable (Falcon only) microphone

       <b>--sound</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Sound  frequency:  6000-50066.  "off"  disables  the sound and speeds up the emulation. To prevent
              extra sound artifacts, the frequency should be selected so that it either matches evenly with  the
              STE/TT/Falcon  sound  DMA  (6258,  12517, 250033, 50066 Hz) or your sound card frequencies (11025,
              22050, 44100 or 6000...48000 Hz).  Check what your sound card supports.

       <b>--sound-buffer-size</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              SDL's sound buffer size: 10-100, or 0 to use default buffer size.  By default Hatari uses  an  SDL
              buffer  size  of 1024 samples, which gives approximately 20-30 ms of sound depending on the chosen
              sound frequency. Under some OS or with not fully supported sound card, this  default  setting  can
              cause  a  bigger delay at lower frequency (nearly 0.5 sec).  In that case, you can use this option
              to force the size of the sound buffer to a fixed number of milliseconds  of  sound  (using  20  is
              often a good choice if you have such problems). Most users will not need this option.

       <b>--sound-sync</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              The  emulation  rate  is nudged by +100 or 0 or -100 micro-seconds on occasion.  This prevents the
              sound buffer from overflowing (long latency and lost samples) or underflowing (short  latency  and
              repeated samples).  The emulation rate smoothly deviates by a maximum of 0.58% until synchronized,
              while  the  emulator  continuously  generates  every sound sample and the crystal controlled sound
              system consumes every sample.
              (on|off, off=default)

       <b>--ym-mixing</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Select a method for mixing the three YM2149 voice volumes together.  "model" uses  a  mathematical
              model of the YM voices, "table" uses a lookup table of audio output voltage values measured on STF
              and "linear" just averages the 3 YM voices.

</pre><h4><b>Debug</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-W,</b> <b>--wincon</b>
              Open console window (Windows only)

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--debug</b>

              this. String given to the --lilo option is appended to the kernel command line.
              NOTE: This is Hatari (and Linux kernel) developer option to test Linux booting.  Unless  you  know
              how  your kernel is configured, and the state of specific kernel and Hatari features, don't expect
              m68k Linux to boot up successfully.

       <b>--bios-intercept</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Enable/Disable XBios command parsing. <a href="../man11/XBios.11.html">XBios</a>(11) Dbmsg call can be used to invoke Hatari  debugger.
              <a href="../man20/XBios.20.html">XBios</a>(20)  printscreen  calls produce also Hatari screenshots. <a href="../man255/XBios.255.html">XBios</a>(255) allows Atari programs to
              use Hatari debugger functionality, which allows e.g. invoking shortcuts and  Hatari  command  line
              options.  Last  one  is  deprecated  as  it gives too much control to emulated program, please use
              NatFeats and remote control APIs (--natfeats, --cmd-fifo, hconsole) instead of XBios 11 and 255.

       <b>--conout</b> <b>&lt;device&gt;</b>
              Enable console (xconout vector functions) output redirection for given &lt;device&gt; to host  terminal.
              Device  2 is for the (CON:) VT52 console, which vector function catches also EmuTOS panic messages
              and MiNT console output, not just normal BIOS console output.

       <b>--disasm</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Set disassembly options.  'uae' and 'ext' select the  disassembly  engine  to  use,  bitmask  sets

       <b>--natfeats</b> <b>&lt;bool&gt;</b>
              Enable/disable  (basic)  Native  Features  support.  EmuTOS  uses  it  for  debug output, and it's
              supported also by the Aranym emulator.   For  more  info,  see  example  code  and  readme.txt  in
              tests/natfeats/ coming with Hatari sources.

       <b>--trace</b> <b>&lt;flags&gt;</b>
              Activate debug traces, see <b>--trace</b> <b>help</b> for available (comma separated) tracing flags

       <b>--trace-file</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Save trace output to &lt;file&gt; (default=stderr)

       <b>--msg-repeat</b>
              Toggle  whether  successive repeats of identical log or trace messages will be suppressed, so that
              only their count is shown (default=suppress).  Disassembly, register and (multi-line)  AES  traces
              bypass this feature

       <b>--parse</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Parse/execute debugger commands from &lt;file&gt;

       <b>--saveconfig</b>
              Save  Hatari  configuration and exit. Hatari UI needs Hatari configuration file to start, this can
              be used to create it automatically.

       <b>--control-socket</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Hatari connects to given local socket file and reads commands  from  it.   Use  when  the  control
              process life-time is longer than Hatari's, or control process needs response from Hatari

       <b>--cmd-fifo</b> <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>
              Hatari creates the indicated FIFO file and reads commands from it.  Commands can be echoed to FIFO
              file,  and  are same as with the control socket. Hatari outputs help for unrecognized commands and
              subcommands

       <b>--log-file</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Save log output to &lt;file&gt; (default=stderr)

              Log output level (x=debug/todo/info/warn/error/fatal)

       <b>--alert-level</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Show dialog for log messages above given level

       <b>--run-vbls</b> <b>&lt;x&gt;</b>
              Exit after X VBLs.  Often used with --benchmark option

       <b>--benchmark</b>
              Start in benchmark mode.  Currently same as --fast-forward mode, except it can't  be  disabled  at
              run-time.  Allows  better  measuring  for the speed of the emulation in frames per second.  Unless
              you're specifically measuring emulator audio and screen processing speed,  disable  them  (--sound
              off/--disable-video on) to have as little OS overhead as possible

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>HANDLING</b></h4><pre>
       Hatari provides special input handling for different purposes.

</pre><h4><b>Emulated</b> <b>Atari</b> <b>ST</b> <b>joystick</b></h4><pre>
       Joystick  can  be  emulated  either  with  keyboard  or  any real joystick supported by your kernel / SDL
       library.  First joystick button acts as FIRE, second as SPACE key.

</pre><h4><b>Emulated</b> <b>Atari</b> <b>ST</b> <b>mouse</b></h4><pre>
       Middle button mouse click is interpreted as double click, this is especially useful in Fast Forward mode.

       Mouse scrollwheel will act as cursor up and down keys.

</pre><h4><b>Emulated</b> <b>Atari</b> <b>ST</b> <b>keyboard</b></h4><pre>
       Keys on the keyboard act as the normal Atari ST keys so pressing SPACE on  your  PC  will  result  in  an
       emulated  press of the SPACE key on the ST. How the PC keys are mapped to Atari key codes, can be changed
       with keyboard config file (-k option).

       The following keys have special meanings:

       <b>Alt</b>    will act as the ST's ALTERNATE key

       <b>left</b> <b>Ctrl</b>
              will act as the ST's CONTROL key

       <b>Print</b>  will emulate the ST's HELP key

       <b>Scroll</b> <b>lock</b>
              will emulate the ST's UNDO key

       <b>AltGr</b> will act as <b>Alternate</b> as well as long as you  do  not  press  it  together  with  a  Hatari  hotkey
       combination.

       The  <b>right</b>  <b>Ctrl</b>  key  is  used  as  the  fire  button of the emulated joystick when you turn on joystick
       emulation via keyboard.

       The cursor keys will act as the cursor keys on the Atari ST as long as joystick  emulation  via  keyboard
       has been turned off.

</pre><h4><b>Keyboard</b> <b>shortcuts</b> <b>during</b> <b>emulation</b></h4><pre>
       The shortcut keys can be configured in the configuration file.  The default settings are:

       <b>AltGr</b> <b>+</b> <b>a</b>
              record animation

       <b>AltGr</b> <b>+</b> <b>g</b>
              grab a screenshot

       <b>AltGr</b> <b>+</b> <b>i</b>
              boss key: leave full screen mode and iconify window

       <b>AltGr</b> <b>+</b> <b>m</b>
              (un-)lock the mouse into the window

       <b>AltGr</b> <b>+</b> <b>r</b>
              warm reset the ST (same as the reset button)

       <b>AltGr</b> <b>+</b> <b>c</b>
              cold reset the ST (same as the power switch)

       <b>AltGr</b> <b>+</b> <b>d</b>
              open dialog to select/change disk A

       <b>AltGr</b> <b>+</b> <b>s</b>
              enable/disable sound

       <b>AltGr</b> <b>+</b> <b>q</b>

              save memory snapshot

       <b>AltGr</b> <b>+</b> <b>l</b>
              load memory snapshot

       <b>AltGr</b> <b>+</b> <b>j</b>
              toggle joystick emulation via cursor keys

       <b>AltGr</b> <b>+</b> <b>F1</b>
              switch joystick type on joy port 0

       <b>AltGr</b> <b>+</b> <b>F2</b>
              switch joystick type on joy port 1

       <b>AltGr</b> <b>+</b> <b>F3</b>
              switch joystick type for joypad A

       <b>AltGr</b> <b>+</b> <b>F4</b>
              switch joystick type for joypad B

       <b>AltGr</b> <b>+</b> <b>b</b>
              toggle borders on/off

       <b>AltGr</b> <b>+</b> <b>f</b> <b>or</b> <b>F11</b>
              toggle between fullscreen and windowed mode

       <b>AltGr</b> <b>+</b> <b>o</b> <b>or</b> <b>F12</b>
              activate the Hatari options GUI
              You may need to hold SHIFT down while in windowed mode.

       <b>Pause</b>  Pauses the emulation

       <b>AltGr</b> <b>+</b> <b>Pause</b>
              Invokes the internal Hatari debugger

</pre><h4><b>Keyboard</b> <b>shortcuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>SDL</b> <b>GUI</b></h4><pre>
       There are multiple ways to interact with the SDL GUI.

       TAB  and cursor keys change the focus between UI elements. Home key moves focus to the first dialog item,
       End key to the last one.  Initially focus is on the default UI element, but focus changes are  remembered
       between dialog invocations.

       Enter and Space invoke the focused item, ESC key invokes the dialog cancel option (if there is one).

       UI element which name has an underlined character can be invoked directly by pressing Alt + key with that
       character.  Alt + arrow keys will act on dialog arrow buttons.

       Main interactions:

       <b>Options</b> <b>GUI</b> <b>main</b> <b>view</b>
              Enter accepts configuration, ESC cancels it.

       <b>Options</b> <b>GUI</b> <b>dialogs</b>
              Enter (or End + Enter if focus was moved), returns back to main view.

       <b>Fileselector</b>
              Page  up and down keys move the file list by one page, mouse wheel and Alt + cursor keys scroll it
              by one item. Enter on the focused file name selects  it.  Enter  on  the  OK  button  accepts  the
              selected file. ESC cancels the dialog/selection.

       <b>Alert</b> <b>dialogs</b>
              Enter accepts and ESC cancels the dialog.
