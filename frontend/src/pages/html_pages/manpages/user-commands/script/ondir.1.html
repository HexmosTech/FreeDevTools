</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ondir - automatically execute scripts when traversing directories at the command line

</pre><h4><b>SYNPOSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ondir</b> <b>&lt;old-directory&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;new-directory&gt;]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NOTE:</b>  <b>The</b> <b>0.2.x</b> <b>series</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>completely</b> <b>rewritten</b> <b>in</b> <b>C.</b> <b>In</b> <b>addition,</b> <b>the</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>file</b> <b>format</b> <b>is</b>
       <b>substantially</b> <b>different.</b>

       <b>ondir</b> is a program that executes a script when entering or leaving a  directory.  It  also  executes  all
       scripts in the intermediate directories between the two.

       For  example, when changing from /opt/music to <a href="file:/home">/home</a>, leave scripts for /opt/music and <a href="file:/opt">/opt</a> are executed,
       then the enter script for <a href="file:/home">/home</a> is executed.

       The scripts are defined  in  either  the  system-wide  rc  file  (/etc/ondirrc)  or  per  user  rc  files
       (<a href="file:~/.ondirrc">~/.ondirrc</a>).

       The  way  <b>ondir</b>  works  is by using auxiliary scripts that override shell builtins (cd, pushd and popd in
       BASH) to execute <b>ondir</b> whenever a user changes directory. These  scripts  are  included  in  the  section
       SCRIPTS, below.

       The  scripts are available in the source tarball and are called <b>scripts.sh</b>, <b>scripts.tcsh</b> for Bourne shell
       variants and TCSH, respectively.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>&lt;old-directory&gt;</b>
              The last directory you were in, after having changed to the new directory.

       <b>[&lt;new-directory&gt;]</b>
              The current directory. This is optional, but can be useful  when  traversing  symbolically  linked
              paths,  as  it  will  use  the logical path rather than the physical path. If left out, ondir uses
              getcwd().

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration files /etc/ondirrc and <a href="file:~/.ondirrc">~/.ondirrc</a> are in the form:

       # Comment
       [final] enter <b>&lt;path&gt;[:&lt;path&gt;[:...]]</b>
            <b>&lt;shell</b> <b>script</b> <b>body&gt;</b>
       [final] leave <b>&lt;path&gt;[:&lt;path&gt;[:...]]</b>
            <b>&lt;shell</b> <b>script</b> <b>body&gt;</b>

       Any line with leading whitespace is assumed to belong to the last valid enter or leave section.

       <b>final</b> <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>section</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>one</b> <b>executed</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b>  <b>matching</b>  <b>directory.</b>  <b>Directories</b>
       <b>further</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hierarchy</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>matched.</b>

       <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>  is  the path to match. Regular expression support has been included since version 0.2.1 thanks to
       Arvind (?). A path must match completely to be considered a match. Because : is the  path  delimiter,  it
       can not be used in any regular expressions.

       Arvind  also re-added (from version 0.1.x) support for $ONDIRWD expansion. This environment variable will
       contain the directory currently being traversed.

       A perfect example of the usefulness of this program is a users public_html directory.

       I personally set my default umask to 077, but when editing in my public_html directory I want my umask to
       be 022. To do this automatically, I would have add the following to my <a href="file:~/.ondirrc">~/.ondirrc</a>

       <b><a href="file:~/.ondirrc">~/.ondirrc</a></b>
              enter /home/athomas/public_html
                   umask 022
              leave /home/athomas/public_html
                   umask 077

       Another good example is if you have a "bin" directory in a project, but don't want to add it  permanently
       to your PATH. The following ondir scripts take care of that:

       <b><a href="file:~/.ondirrc">~/.ondirrc</a></b>
              enter /home/athomas/projects/myproject
                   PATH=$PATH:$CWD/bin
              leave /home/athomas/projects/myproject
                   PATH=`echo $PATH | sed -e "s,:$CWD/bin,,g"`

</pre><h4><b>SCRIPTS</b></h4><pre>
       On  Debian  systems  the  integration  scripts  are installed in <u>/usr/share/ondir/integration</u> to simplify
       integration into one's own shell. To enable ondir, one  needs  to  include  these  files  in  the  shells
       startup.

       When using <b>bash</b>, add the following to your <u><a href="file:~/.bashrc">~/.bashrc</a></u>:

       source /usr/share/ondir/integration/bash

       When using <b>zsh</b>, add the following to your <u><a href="file:~/.zshrc">~/.zshrc</a></u>:

       source /usr/share/ondir/integration/zsh

       When using <b>fish</b>, run the following commands:

       mkdir -p <a href="file:~/.config/fish/conf.d">~/.config/fish/conf.d</a>
       ln -s /usr/share/ondir/integration/fish \
             <a href="file:~/.config/fish/conf.d/ondir_prompt_hook.fish">~/.config/fish/conf.d/ondir_prompt_hook.fish</a>

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ondir</b> also has the ability to execute scripts in the directories being traversed. These scripts are named
       <b>.onenter</b>  and  <b>.onleave</b>.  This  ability  is disabled by default, but can be enabled by editing conf.h and
       uncommenting:

       #define USE_ONENTERLEAVE

       This functionaliy is disabled in the Debian package for security reasons.
