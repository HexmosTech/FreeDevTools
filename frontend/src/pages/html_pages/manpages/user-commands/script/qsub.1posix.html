</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       To  submit a script is to create a batch job that executes the script. A script is submitted by a request
       to a batch server. The <u>qsub</u> utility is a user-accessible batch client that submits a script.

       Upon successful completion, the <u>qsub</u> utility shall have  created  a  batch  job  that  will  execute  the
       submitted script.

       The <u>qsub</u> utility shall submit a script by sending a <u>Queue</u> <u>Job</u> <u>Request</u> to a batch server.

       The  <u>qsub</u>  utility  shall  place  the  value  of the following environment variables in the <u>Variable_List</u>
       attribute of the batch job: <u>HOME</u>, <u>LANG</u>, <u>LOGNAME</u>, <u>PATH</u>, <u>MAIL</u>, <u>SHELL</u>, and <u>TZ</u>.  The name of the  environment
       variable shall be the current name prefixed with the string PBS_O_.

       <b>Note:</b>     If  the  current  value  of  the  <u>HOME</u> variable in the environment space of the <u>qsub</u> utility is
                 <b>/aa/bb/cc</b>, then <u>qsub</u> shall place <u>PBS_O_HOME</u>=<b>/aa/bb/cc</b> in the  <u>Variable_List</u>  attribute  of  the
                 batch job.

       In addition to the variables described above, the <u>qsub</u> utility shall add the following variables with the
       indicated values to the variable list:

       <u>PBS_O_WORKDIR</u> The absolute path of the current working directory of the <u>qsub</u> utility process.

       <u>PBS_O_HOST</u>    The name of the host on which the <u>qsub</u> utility is running.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>qsub</u>  utility  shall  conform  to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u>
       <u>Syntax</u> <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

       <b>-a</b> <u>date_time</u>
                 Define the time at which a batch job becomes eligible for execution.

                 The <u>qsub</u> utility shall accept an option-argument that  conforms  to  the  syntax  of  the  <u>time</u>
                 operand of the <u>touch</u> utility.

                 <b>Note:</b>     The  server that initiates execution of the batch job will add other variables to the
                           batch job's environment; see <u>Section</u> <u>3.2.2.1</u>, <u>Batch</u> <u>Job</u> <u>Execution</u>.

                 The <u>qsub</u> utility shall set the <u>Execution_Time</u> attribute of the  batch  job  to  the  number  of
                 seconds  since  the  Epoch  that  is equivalent to the local time expressed by the value of the
                 <u>date_time</u> option-argument. The Epoch is defined in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
                 <u>Section</u> <u>3.150</u>, <u>Epoch</u>.

                 If the <b>-a</b> option is not presented to the <u>qsub</u> utility, the utility shall set the <u>Execution_Time</u>
                 attribute of the batch job to a time (number of seconds since the Epoch) that is  earlier  than
                 the time at which the utility exits.

       <b>-A</b> <u>account_string</u>
                 Define the account to which the resource consumption of the batch job should be charged.

                 The syntax of the <u>account_string</u> option-argument is unspecified.

                 The  <u>qsub</u>  utility  shall  set  the <u>Account_Name</u> attribute of the batch job to the value of the
                 <u>account_string</u> option-argument.

                 If the <b>-A</b> option is not presented to the <u>qsub</u> utility, the utility shall omit the  <u>Account_Name</u>
                 attribute from the attributes of the batch job.

       <b>-c</b> <u>interval</u>
                 Define whether the batch job should be checkpointed, and if so, how often.

                 The  <u>qsub</u>  utility  shall  accept  a  value for the interval option-argument that is one of the
                 following:

                 n         No checkpointing shall be performed on the batch job (NO_CHECKPOINT).

                 s         Checkpointing  shall  be  performed  only  when  the  batch  server  is   shut   down
                           (CHECKPOINT_AT_SHUTDOWN).

                 c         Automatic  periodic  checkpointing  shall  be  performed  at the <u>Minimum_Cpu_Interval</u>
                           attribute    of    the    batch    queue,     in     units     of     CPU     minutes
                           (CHECKPOINT_AT_MIN_CPU_INTERVAL).

                 c=<u>minutes</u> Automatic  periodic  checkpointing  shall  be performed every <u>minutes</u> of CPU time, or
                           every <u>Minimum_Cpu_Interval</u> minutes, whichever is greater. The <u>minutes</u> argument  shall
                           conform to the syntax for unsigned integers and shall be greater than zero.

                 The  <u>qsub</u>  utility  shall  set  the  <u>Checkpoint</u>  attribute of the batch job to the value of the
                 <u>interval</u> option-argument.

                 If the <b>-c</b> option is not presented to the <u>qsub</u> utility, the utility  shall  set  the  <u>Checkpoint</u>
                 attribute of the batch job to the single character <b>'u'</b> (CHECKPOINT_UNSPECIFIED).

       <b>-C</b> <u>directive_prefix</u>
                 Define the prefix that declares a directive to the <u>qsub</u> utility within the script.

                 The <u>directive_prefix</u> is not a batch job attribute; it affects the behavior of the <u>qsub</u> utility.

                 If  the  <b>-C</b>  option  is  presented  to  the <u>qsub</u> utility, and the value of the <u>directive_prefix</u>
                 option-argument is the null string, the utility shall not scan the script file for  directives.
                 If  the  <b>-C</b>  option  is  not  presented  to the <u>qsub</u> utility, then the value of the <u>PBS_DPREFIX</u>
                 environment variable is used. If the environment variable is not defined, then #PBS encoded  in
                 the portable character set is the default.

       <b>-e</b> <u>path_name</u>
                 Define the path to be used for the standard error stream of the batch job.

                 The  <u>qsub</u> utility shall accept a <u>path_name</u> option-argument which can be preceded by a host name
                 element of the form <u>hostname</u>:.

                 If the <u>path_name</u> option-argument constitutes an absolute pathname, the <u>qsub</u> utility  shall  set
                 the <u>Error_Path</u> attribute of the batch job to the value of the <u>path_name</u> option-argument.

                 If  the  <u>path_name</u>  option-argument constitutes a relative pathname and no host name element is
                 specified, the <u>qsub</u> utility shall set the <u>Error_Path</u> attribute of the batch job to the value of
                 the absolute pathname derived by  expanding  the  <u>path_name</u>  option-argument  relative  to  the
                 current directory of the process executing <u>qsub</u>.

                 If  the  <u>path_name</u>  option-argument  constitutes a relative pathname and a host name element is
                 specified, the <u>qsub</u> utility shall set the <u>Error_Path</u> attribute of the batch job to the value of
                 the <u>path_name</u> option-argument without expansion. The host name element shall be included.

                 If the <u>path_name</u> option-argument does not include a host name element, the <u>qsub</u>  utility  shall
                 prefix  the pathname with <u>hostname</u>:, where <u>hostname</u> is the name of the host upon which the <u>qsub</u>
                 utility is being executed.

                 If the <b>-e</b> option is not presented to the <u>qsub</u> utility, the utility  shall  set  the  <u>Error_Path</u>
                 attribute of the batch job to the host name and path of the current directory of the submitting
                 process and the default filename.

                 The default filename for standard error has the following format:

                     <u>job_name</u>.e<u>sequence_number</u>

       <b>-h</b>        Specify that a USER hold is applied to the batch job.

                 The  <u>qsub</u> utility shall set the value of the <u>Hold_Types</u> attribute of the batch job to the value
                 USER.

                 If the <b>-h</b> option is not presented to the <u>qsub</u> utility, the utility  shall  set  the  <u>Hold_Types</u>
                 attribute of the batch job to the value NO_HOLD.

       <b>-j</b> <u>join_list</u>
                 Define which streams of the batch job are to be merged. The <u>qsub</u> <b>-j</b> option shall accept a value
                 for  the  <u>join_list</u> option-argument that is a string of alphanumeric characters in the portable
                 character set (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>6.1</u>, <u>Portable</u> <u>Character</u>
                 <u>Set</u>).

                 The <u>qsub</u> utility shall accept a <u>join_list</u> option-argument that consists of one or more  of  the
                 characters <b>'e'</b> and <b>'o'</b>, or the single character <b>'n'</b>.

                 All  of  the  other  batch  job  output streams specified will be merged into the output stream
                 represented by the character listed first in the <u>join_list</u> option-argument.

                 For each unique character in the <u>join_list</u> option-argument, the <u>qsub</u> utility shall add a  value
                 to the <u>Join_Path</u> attribute of the batch job as follows, each representing a different batch job
                 stream to join:

                 e     The standard error of the batch job (JOIN_STD_ERROR).

                 o     The standard output of the batch job (JOIN_STD_OUTPUT).

                 An existing <u>Join_Path</u> attribute can be cleared by the following join type:

                 n     NO_JOIN

                 If  <b>'n'</b>  is specified, then no files are joined. The <u>qsub</u> utility shall consider it an error if
                 any join type other than <b>'n'</b> is combined with join type <b>'n'</b>.

                 Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of the characters <b>'e'</b>, <b>'o'</b>, or <b>'n'</b> within
                 the <u>join_list</u> option-argument. The <u>qsub</u> utility shall permit the repetition of characters,  but
                 shall not assign additional meaning to the repeated characters.

                 An  implementation  may define other join types. The conformance document for an implementation
                 shall describe any additional batch  job  streams,  how  they  are  specified,  their  internal
                 behavior, and how they affect the behavior of the utility.

                 If  the  <b>-j</b> option is not presented to the <u>qsub</u> utility, the utility shall set the value of the
                 <u>Join_Path</u> attribute of the batch job to NO_JOIN.

       <b>-k</b> <u>keep_list</u>
                 Define which output of the batch job to retain on the execution host.

                 The <u>qsub</u> <b>-k</b> option shall accept a value for the <u>keep_list</u> option-argument that is a  string  of
                 alphanumeric  characters  in  the  portable  character  set (see the Base Definitions volume of
                 POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>6.1</u>, <u>Portable</u> <u>Character</u> <u>Set</u>).

                 The <u>qsub</u> utility shall accept a <u>keep_list</u> option-argument that consists of one or more  of  the
                 characters <b>'e'</b> and <b>'o'</b>, or the single character <b>'n'</b>.

                 For  each unique character in the <u>keep_list</u> option-argument, the <u>qsub</u> utility shall add a value
                 to the <u>Keep_Files</u> attribute of the batch job as follows, each representing  a  different  batch
                 job stream to keep:

                 e     The standard error of the batch job (KEEP_STD_ERROR).

                 o     The standard output of the batch job (KEEP_STD_OUTPUT).

                 If  both  <b>'e'</b>  and  <b>'o'</b>  are  specified,  then  both files are retained. An existing <u>Keep_Files</u>
                 attribute can be cleared by the following keep type:

                 n     NO_KEEP

                 If <b>'n'</b> is specified, then no files are retained. The <u>qsub</u> utility shall consider it an error if
                 any keep type other than <b>'n'</b> is combined with keep type <b>'n'</b>.

                 Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of the characters <b>'e'</b>, <b>'o'</b>, or <b>'n'</b> within
                 the <u>keep_list</u> option-argument. The <u>qsub</u> utility shall permit the repetition of characters,  but
                 shall not assign additional meaning to the repeated characters.

                 An  implementation  may define other keep types. The conformance document for an implementation
                 shall describe any additional keep types, how they are specified, their internal behavior,  and
                 how  they  affect  the  behavior  of the utility. If the <b>-k</b> option is not presented to the <u>qsub</u>
                 utility, the utility shall set the <u>Keep_Files</u> attribute of the batch job to the value NO_KEEP.

       <b>-m</b> <u>mail_options</u>
                 Define the points in the execution of the batch job at which the batch server that manages  the
                 batch job shall send mail about a change in the state of the batch job.

                 The  <u>qsub</u>  <b>-m</b> option shall accept a value for the <u>mail_options</u> option-argument that is a string
                 of alphanumeric characters in the portable character set (see the Base  Definitions  volume  of
                 POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>6.1</u>, <u>Portable</u> <u>Character</u> <u>Set</u>).

                 The  <u>qsub</u> utility shall accept a value for the <u>mail_options</u> option-argument that is a string of
                 one or more of the characters <b>'e'</b>, <b>'b'</b>, and <b>'a'</b>, or the single character <b>'n'</b>.

                 For each unique character in the <u>mail_options</u> option-argument, the <u>qsub</u>  utility  shall  add  a
                 value  to  the  <u>Mail_Users</u> attribute of the batch job as follows, each representing a different
                 time during the life of a batch job at which to send mail:

                 e     MAIL_AT_EXIT

                 b     MAIL_AT_BEGINNING

                 a     MAIL_AT_ABORT

                 If any of these characters are duplicated in the <u>mail_options</u> option-argument,  the  duplicates
                 shall be ignored.

                 An existing <u>Mail_Points</u> attribute can be cleared by the following mail type:

                 n     NO_MAIL

                 If  <b>'n'</b> is specified, then mail is not sent. The <u>qsub</u> utility shall consider it an error if any
                 mail type other than <b>'n'</b> is combined with mail type <b>'n'</b>.

                 Strictly conforming applications shall not repeat any of the characters <b>'e'</b>, <b>'b'</b>, <b>'a'</b>,  or  <b>'n'</b>
                 within the <u>mail_options</u> option-argument.

                 The  <u>qsub</u>  utility  shall  permit the repetition of characters, but shall not assign additional
                 meaning to the repeated  characters.  An  implementation  may  define  other  mail  types.  The
                 conformance  document  for an implementation shall describe any additional mail types, how they
                 are specified, their internal behavior, and how they affect the behavior of the utility.

                 If the <b>-m</b> option is not presented to the <u>qsub</u> utility, the utility shall  set  the  <u>Mail_Points</u>
                 attribute to the value MAIL_AT_ABORT.

       <b>-M</b> <u>mail_list</u>
                 Define  the  list of users to which a batch server that executes the batch job shall send mail,
                 if the server sends mail about the batch job.

                 The syntax of the <u>mail_list</u> option-argument is unspecified.

                 If the implementation of the <u>qsub</u> utility uses a name service  to  locate  users,  the  utility
                 should accept the syntax used by the name service.

                 If  the  implementation  of  the  <u>qsub</u> utility does not use a name service to locate users, the
                 implementation should accept the following syntax for user names:

                     <u>mail_address</u><b>[</b>,,<u>mail_address</u>,, ...<b>]</b>

                 The interpretation of <u>mail_address</u> is implementation-defined.

                 The <u>qsub</u> utility shall set the <u>Mail_Users</u> attribute of the  batch  job  to  the  value  of  the
                 <u>mail_list</u> option-argument.

                 If  the  <b>-M</b>  option is not presented to the <u>qsub</u> utility, the utility shall place only the user
                 name and host name for the current process in the <u>Mail_Users</u> attribute of the batch job.

       <b>-N</b> <u>name</u>   Define the name of the batch job.

                 The <u>qsub</u> <b>-N</b> option shall accept a value for the <u>name</u> option-argument that is a string of up  to
                 15  alphanumeric  characters  in the portable character set (see the Base Definitions volume of
                 POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>6.1</u>, <u>Portable</u> <u>Character</u> <u>Set</u>) where the first character is alphabetic.

                 The <u>qsub</u> utility shall set the value of the <u>Job_Name</u> attribute of the batch job to the value of
                 the <u>name</u> option-argument.

                 If the <b>-N</b> option is not presented to the <u>qsub</u> utility,  the  utility  shall  set  the  <u>Job_Name</u>
                 attribute  of  the  batch  job  to  the  name  of  the <u>script</u> argument from which the directory
                 specification if any, has been removed.

                 If the <b>-N</b> option is not presented to the <u>qsub</u> utility, and the script  is  read  from  standard
                 input, the utility shall set the <u>Job_Name</u> attribute of the batch job to the value STDIN.

       <b>-o</b> <u>path_name</u>
                 Define the path for the standard output of the batch job.

                 The  <u>qsub</u>  utility  shall accept a <u>path_name</u> option-argument that conforms to the syntax of the
                 <u>path_name</u> element defined in the  System  Interfaces  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  which  can  be
                 preceded by a host name element of the form <u>hostname</u>:.

                 If  the  <u>path_name</u> option-argument constitutes an absolute pathname, the <u>qsub</u> utility shall set
                 the <u>Output_Path</u> attribute of the batch job  to  the  value  of  the  <u>path_name</u>  option-argument
                 without expansion.

                 If  the  <u>path_name</u>  option-argument constitutes a relative pathname and no host name element is
                 specified, the <u>qsub</u> utility shall set the  <u>Output_Path</u>  attribute  of  the  batch  job  to  the
                 pathname  derived  by  expanding  the  value  of  the <u>path_name</u> option-argument relative to the
                 current directory of the process executing the <u>qsub</u>.

                 If the <u>path_name</u> option-argument constitutes a relative pathname and a  host  name  element  is
                 specified,  the  <u>qsub</u> utility shall set the <u>Output_Path</u> attribute of the batch job to the value
                 of the <u>path_name</u> option-argument without expansion.

                 If the <u>path_name</u> option-argument does not specify a host name element, the <u>qsub</u>  utility  shall
                 prefix  the pathname with <u>hostname</u>:, where <u>hostname</u> is the name of the host upon which the <u>qsub</u>
                 utility is executing.

                 If the <b>-o</b> option is not presented to the <u>qsub</u> utility, the utility shall  set  the  <u>Output_Path</u>
                 attribute of the batch job to the host name and path of the current directory of the submitting
                 process and the default filename.

                 The default filename for standard output has the following format:

                     <u>job_name</u>.o<u>sequence_number</u>

       <b>-p</b> <u>priority</u>
                 Define  the  priority the batch job should have relative to other batch jobs owned by the batch
                 server.

                 The <u>qsub</u> utility shall set the <u>Priority</u> attribute of the batch job to the value of the <u>priority</u>
                 option-argument.

                 If the <b>-p</b> option is not presented to the <u>qsub</u> utility, the value of the <u>Priority</u>  attribute  is
                 implementation-defined.

                 The  <u>qsub</u>  utility  shall  accept a value for the <u>priority</u> option-argument that conforms to the
                 syntax for signed decimal integers, and which is not less than -1024 and not greater than 1023.

       <b>-q</b> <u>destination</u>
                 Define the destination of the batch job.

                 The destination is not a batch job attribute; it determines the batch server, and possibly  the
                 batch queue, to which the <u>qsub</u> utility batch queues the batch job.

                 The  <u>qsub</u>  utility shall submit the script to the batch server named by the <u>destination</u> option-
                 argument or the server that owns the batch queue named in the <u>destination</u> option-argument.

                 The <u>qsub</u> utility shall accept an option-argument for the <b>-q</b> option that conforms to the  syntax
                 for a destination (see <u>Section</u> <u>3.3.2</u>, <u>Destination</u>).

                 If  the <b>-q</b> option is not presented to the <u>qsub</u> utility, the <u>qsub</u> utility shall submit the batch
                 job to the default destination. The  mechanism  for  determining  the  default  destination  is
                 implementation-defined.

       <b>-r</b> <u>y</u>|<u>n</u>    Define whether the batch job is rerunnable.

                 If the value of the option-argument is <u>y</u>, the <u>qsub</u> utility shall set the <u>Rerunable</u> attribute of
                 the batch job to TRUE.

                 If the value of the option-argument is <u>n</u>, the <u>qsub</u> utility shall set the <u>Rerunable</u> attribute of
                 the batch job to FALSE.

                 If  the  <b>-r</b>  option  is  not presented to the <u>qsub</u> utility, the utility shall set the <u>Rerunable</u>
                 attribute of the batch job to TRUE.

       <b>-S</b> <u>path_name_list</u>
                 Define the pathname to the shell under which the batch job is to execute.

                 The <u>qsub</u> utility shall accept a <u>path_name_list</u> option-argument that conforms to  the  following
                 syntax:

                     <u>pathname</u><b>[</b>@<u>host</u><b>][</b>,,<u>pathname</u><b>[</b>@<u>host</u><b>]</b>,, ...<b>]</b>

                 The  <u>qsub</u>  utility  shall allow only one pathname for a given host name. The <u>qsub</u> utility shall
                 allow only one pathname that is missing a corresponding host name.

                 The <u>qsub</u> utility shall add a value to the <u>Shell_Path_List</u> attribute of the batch job  for  each
                 entry in the <u>path_name_list</u> option-argument.

                 If  the  <b>-S</b>  option  is  not  presented  to  the  <u>qsub</u>  utility,  the  utility  shall  set  the
                 <u>Shell_Path_List</u> attribute of the batch job to the null string.

                 The conformance document for an implementation shall describe the mechanism  used  to  set  the
                 default  shell  and  determine  the current value of the default shell. An implementation shall
                 provide a means for the installation to set the default shell to the login shell  of  the  user
                 under  which the batch job is to execute. See <u>Section</u> <u>3.3.3</u>, <u>Multiple</u> <u>Keyword-Value</u> <u>Pairs</u> for a
                 means of removing <u>keyword</u>=<u>value</u> (and <u>value</u>@<u>keyword</u>) pairs and other  general  rules  for  list-
                 oriented batch job attributes.

       <b>-u</b> <u>user_list</u>
                 Define the user name under which the batch job is to execute.

                 The  <u>qsub</u>  utility  shall  accept  a  <u>user_list</u>  option-argument that conforms to the following
                 syntax:

                     <u>username</u><b>[</b>@<u>host</u><b>][</b>,,<u>username</u><b>[</b>@<u>host</u><b>]</b>,, ...<b>]</b>

                 The <u>qsub</u> utility shall accept only one user name that is missing a corresponding host name. The
                 <u>qsub</u> utility shall accept only one user name per named host.

                 The <u>qsub</u> utility shall add a value to the <u>User_List</u> attribute of the batch job for  each  entry
                 in the <u>user_list</u> option-argument.

                 If  the  <b>-u</b>  option  is  not presented to the <u>qsub</u> utility, the utility shall set the <u>User_List</u>
                 attribute of the batch job to the user name from which the utility is  executing.  See  <u>Section</u>
                 <u>3.3.3</u>,  <u>Multiple</u>  <u>Keyword-Value</u> <u>Pairs</u> for a means of removing <u>keyword</u>=<u>value</u> (and <u>value</u>@<u>keyword</u>)
                 pairs and other general rules for list-oriented batch job attributes.

       <b>-v</b> <u>variable_list</u>
                 Add to the list of variables that are exported to the session leader of the batch job.

                 A <u>variable_list</u> is a set  of  strings  of  either  the  form  &lt;<u>variable</u>&gt;  or  &lt;<u>variable</u>=<u>value</u>&gt;,
                 delimited by &lt;comma&gt; characters.

                 If  the  <b>-v</b>  option  is  presented  to  the  <u>qsub</u>  utility,  the utility shall also add, to the
                 environment <u>Variable_List</u> attribute of the batch job, every variable named in  the  environment
                 <u>variable_list</u> option-argument and, optionally, values of specified variables.

                 If  a  value  is not provided on the command line, the <u>qsub</u> utility shall set the value of each
                 variable in the environment <u>Variable_List</u> attribute of the  batch  job  to  the  value  of  the
                 corresponding environment variable for the process in which the utility is executing; see <u>Table</u>
                 <u>4-19,</u> <u>Environment</u> <u>Variable</u> <u>Values</u> <u>(Utilities)</u>.

                 A  conforming  application shall not repeat a variable in the environment <u>variable_list</u> option-
                 argument.

                 The <u>qsub</u> utility shall not repeat a variable in the environment <u>Variable_List</u> attribute of  the
                 batch   job.  See  <u>Section</u>  <u>3.3.3</u>,  <u>Multiple</u>  <u>Keyword-Value</u>  <u>Pairs</u>  for  a  means  of  removing
                 <u>keyword</u>=<u>value</u> (and <u>value</u>@<u>keyword</u>) pairs and other general rules  for  list-oriented  batch  job
                 attributes.

       <b>-V</b>        Specify that all of the environment variables of the process are exported to the context of the
                 batch job.

                 The  <u>qsub</u> utility shall place every environment variable in the process in which the utility is
                 executing in the list and shall set the value of each variable in the attribute to the value of
                 that variable in the process.

       <b>-z</b>        Specify that the utility does not write the batch <u>job_identifier</u> of the created  batch  job  to
                 standard output.

                 If  the  <b>-z</b>  option  is  presented  to  the <u>qsub</u> utility, the utility shall not write the batch
                 <u>job_identifier</u> of the created batch job to standard output.

                 If the <b>-z</b> option is not presented to the <u>qsub</u> utility, the utility shall write  the  identifier
                 of the created batch job to standard output.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>qsub</u> utility shall accept a <u>script</u> operand that indicates the path to the script of the batch job.

       If  the  <u>script</u>  operand  is not presented to the <u>qsub</u> utility, or if the operand is the single-character
       string <b>'-'</b>, the utility shall read the script from standard input.

       If the script represents a partial path, the <u>qsub</u> utility shall expand the path relative to  the  current
       directory of the process executing the utility.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>qsub</u>  utility reads the script of the batch job from standard input if the script operand is omitted
       or is the single character <b>'-'</b>.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to binding the file indicated by the <u>script</u> operand to the batch job, the <u>qsub</u> utility  reads
       the script file and acts on directives in the script.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>qsub</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>Section</u>  <u>8.2</u>,  <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error.

       <u>LOGNAME</u>   Determine the login name of the user.

       <u>PBS_DPREFIX</u>
                 Determine the default prefix for directives within the script.

       <u>SHELL</u>     Determine the pathname of the preferred command language interpreter of the user.

       <u>TZ</u>        Determine the timezone used to interpret the <u>date-time</u> option-argument. If <u>TZ</u> is unset or null,
                 an unspecified default timezone shall be used.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Once created, a batch job exists until it exits, aborts, or is deleted.

       After a batch job is created by the <u>qsub</u> utility, batch servers might route, execute, modify,  or  delete
       the batch job.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>qsub</u> utility writes the batch <u>job_identifier</u> assigned to the batch job to standard output, unless the
       <b>-z</b> option is specified.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Script</b> <b>Preservation</b>
       The <u>qsub</u> utility shall make the script available to the server executing the batch job in such a way that
       the server executes the script as it exists at the time of submission.

       The  <u>qsub</u>  utility  can  send  a  copy  of the script to the server with the <u>Queue</u> <u>Job</u> <u>Request</u> or store a
       temporary copy of the script in a location specified to the server.

   <b>Option</b> <b>Specification</b>
       A script can contain directives to the <u>qsub</u> utility.

       The <u>qsub</u> utility shall scan the lines of the script for directives, skipping blank lines, until the first
       line that begins with a string other than the directive string; if directives occur on subsequent  lines,
       the utility shall ignore those directives.

       Lines are separated by a &lt;newline&gt;.  If the first line of the script begins with <b>"#!"</b> or a &lt;colon&gt; (<b>':'</b>),
       then it is skipped. The <u>qsub</u> utility shall process a line in the script as a directive if and only if the
       string  of  characters  from  the  first non-white-space character on the line until the first &lt;space&gt; or
       &lt;tab&gt; on the line match the directive prefix. If a line in the script contains a directive and the  final
       characters  of  the  line  are  &lt;backslash&gt;  and  &lt;newline&gt;, then the next line shall be interpreted as a
       continuation of that directive.

       The <u>qsub</u> utility shall process the options and option-arguments contained on the  directive  prefix  line
       using the same syntax as if the options were input on the <u>qsub</u> utility.

       The  <u>qsub</u>  utility  shall  continue  to  process  a  directive  prefix  line  until  after a &lt;newline&gt; is
       encountered. An implementation may ignore lines which, according to the syntax of  the  shell  that  will
       interpret  the  script,  are  comments.  An implementation shall describe in the conformance document the
       format of any shell comments that it will recognize.

       If an option is present in both a directive and the arguments to the  <u>qsub</u>  utility,  the  utility  shall
       ignore the option and the corresponding option-argument, if any, in the directive.

       If  an  option  that is present in the directive is not present in the arguments to the <u>qsub</u> utility, the
       utility shall process the option and the option-argument, if any.

       In order of preference, the <u>qsub</u> utility shall select the directive prefix  from  one  of  the  following
       sources:

        *  If the <b>-C</b> option is presented to the utility, the value of the <u>directive_prefix</u> option-argument

        *  If the environment variable <u>PBS_DPREFIX</u> is defined, the value of that variable

        *  The four-character string <b>"#PBS"</b> encoded in the portable character set

       If the <b>-C</b> option is present in the script file it shall be ignored.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Successful completion.

       &gt;0    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>qsub</u> utility allows users to create a batch job that will process the script specified as the operand
       of the utility.

       The  options  of  the  <u>qsub</u> utility allow users to control many aspects of the queuing and execution of a
       batch job.

       The <b>-a</b> option allows users to designate the time after which the batch job will become eligible  to  run.
       By  specifying  an  execution  time, users can take advantage of resources at off-peak hours, synchronize
       jobs with chronologically predictable events, and perhaps take advantage of off-peak pricing of computing
       time. For these reasons and others, a timing option is existing practice on  the  part  of  almost  every
       batch system, including NQS.

       The  <b>-A</b>  option  allows  users to specify the account that will be charged for the batch job. Support for
       account is not mandatory for conforming batch servers.

       The <b>-C</b> option allows users to prescribe the prefix for directives within the  script  file.  The  default
       prefix  <b>"#PBS"</b>  may  be  inappropriate  if  the  script  will  be interpreted with an alternate shell, as
       specified by the <b>-S</b> option.

       The <b>-c</b> option allows users to establish the  checkpointing  interval  for  their  jobs.  A  checkpointing
       system,  which  is not defined by this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, allows recovery of a batch job at the most
       recent checkpoint in the event of a  crash.  Checkpointing  is  typically  used  for  jobs  that  consume
       expensive  computing  time or must meet a critical schedule. Users should be allowed to make the tradeoff
       between the overhead of checkpointing and the risk to the timely completion of the batch job;  therefore,
       this  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017  provides  the checkpointing interval option. Support for checkpointing is
       optional for batch servers.

       The <b>-e</b> option allows users to redirect the standard error streams of their jobs to  a  non-default  path.
       For  example,  if  the  submitted  script generally produces a great deal of useless error output, a user
       might redirect the standard error output to the null device. Or, if the file system holding  the  default
       location (the home directory of the user) has too little free space, the user might redirect the standard
       error stream to a file in another file system.

       The  <b>-h</b>  option allows users to create a batch job that is held until explicitly released. The ability to
       create a held job is useful when some external event must complete before the batch job can execute.  For
       example, the user might submit a held job and release it when the system load has dropped.

       The  <b>-j</b>  option  allows users to merge the standard error of a batch job into its standard output stream,
       which has the advantage of showing the sequential relationship between output and error messages.

       The <b>-m</b> option allows users to designate those points in the execution of a batch job at which  mail  will
       be  sent  to  the  submitting  user,  or to the account(s) indicated by the <b>-M</b> option. By requesting mail
       notification at points of interest in the life of a job, the submitting user, or other designated  users,
       can track the progress of a batch job.

       The  <b>-N</b>  option  allows  users to associate a name with the batch job. The job name in no way affects the
       processing of the batch job, but rather serves as a mnemonic handle for users. For example, the batch job
       name can help the user distinguish between multiple jobs listed by the <u>qstat</u> utility.

       The <b>-o</b> option allows users to redirect the standard output stream. A user might,  for  example,  wish  to
       redirect  to  the  null  device the standard output stream of a job that produces copious yet superfluous
       output.

       The <b>-P</b> option allows users to designate the relative priority of a batch job for selection from a queue.

       The <b>-q</b> option allows users to specify an initial queue for the batch job. If the user specifies a routing
       queue, the batch server routes the batch job to another queue for execution or further  routing.  If  the
       user specifies a non-routing queue, the batch server of the queue eventually executes the batch job.

       The  <b>-r</b>  option  allows users to control whether the submitted job will be rerun if the controlling batch
       node fails during execution of the batch job.  The <b>-r</b> option likewise allows users to indicate whether or
       not the batch job is eligible to be rerun by the <u>qrerun</u> utility. Some  jobs  cannot  be  correctly  rerun
       because  of  changes  they  make  in  the state of databases or other aspects of their environment.  This
       volume of POSIX.1‐2017 specifies that the default, if the <b>-r</b> option is not presented to the utility, will
       be that the batch job cannot be rerun, since the result  of  rerunning  a  non-rerunnable  job  might  be
       catastrophic.

       The  <b>-S</b>  option allows users to specify the program (usually a shell) that will be invoked to process the
       script of the batch job. This option has been modified to allow a  list  of  shell  names  and  locations
       associated with different hosts.

       The  <b>-u</b>  option  is useful when the submitting user is authorized to use more than one account on a given
       host, in which case the <b>-u</b> option allows the user to  select  from  among  those  accounts.  The  option-
       argument is a list of user-host pairs, so that the submitting user can provide different user identifiers
       for  different nodes in the event the batch job is routed. The <b>-u</b> option provides a lot of flexibility to
       accommodate sites with complex account structures. Users that have the same user identifier  on  all  the
       hosts they are authorized to use will not need to use the <b>-u</b> option.

       The  <b>-V</b>  option  allows users to export all their current environment variables, as of the time the batch
       job is submitted, to the context of the processes of the batch job.

       The <b>-v</b> option allows users to export specific environment variables from their  current  process  to  the
       processes of the batch job.

       The <b>-z</b> option allows users to suppress the writing of the batch job identifier to standard output. The <b>-z</b>
       option is an existing NQS practice that has been standardized.

       Historically,  the  <u>qsub</u>  utility  has  served  the  batch job-submission function in the NQS system, the
       existing practice on which it is based. Some changes and additions have been made to the <u>qsub</u> utility  in
       this  volume  of  POSIX.1‐2017,  <u>vis-a-vis</u>  NQS,  as  a  result  of  the  growing pool of experience with
       distributed batch systems.

       The set of features of the <u>qsub</u> utility as defined in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 appears to  incorporate
       all the common existing practice on potentially conforming platforms.
