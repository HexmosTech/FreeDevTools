</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sbatch - Submit a batch script to Slurm.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sbatch</b> [<u><a href="../man0/OPTIONS.0.html">OPTIONS</a>(0)</u>...] [ : [<u>OPTIONS(N)</u>...]] <u><a href="../man0/script.0.html">script</a>(0)</u> [<u><a href="../man0/args.0.html">args</a>(0)</u>...]

       Option(s) define multiple jobs in a co-scheduled heterogeneous job.  For more details about heterogeneous
       jobs see the document
       https://slurm.schedmd.com/heterogeneous_jobs.html

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       sbatch  submits  a  batch script to Slurm. The batch script may be given to sbatch through a file name on
       the command line, or if no file name is specified, sbatch will read in a script from standard input.  The
       batch  script  may  contain options preceded with "#SBATCH" before any executable commands in the script.
       sbatch will stop processing further #SBATCH directives once the first non-comment non-whitespace line has
       been reached in the script.

       sbatch exits immediately after the script  is  successfully  transferred  to  the  Slurm  controller  and
       assigned a Slurm job ID. The batch script is not necessarily granted resources immediately, it may sit in
       the queue of pending jobs for some time before its required resources become available.

       By  default  both  standard  output and standard error are directed to a file of the name "slurm-%j.out",
       where the "%j" is replaced with the job allocation number. The file will be generated on the  first  node
       of the job allocation.  Other than the batch script itself, Slurm does no movement of user files.

       When  the  job  allocation is finally granted for the batch script, Slurm runs a single copy of the batch
       script on the first node in the set of allocated nodes.

       The following document describes the influence of various options on the allocation of cpus to  jobs  and
       tasks.
       https://slurm.schedmd.com/cpu_management.html

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       sbatch will return 0 on success or error code on failure.

</pre><h4><b>SCRIPT</b> <b>PATH</b> <b>RESOLUTION</b></h4><pre>
       The batch script is resolved in the following order:

       1. If script starts with ".", then path is constructed as: current working directory / script
       2. If script starts with a "/", then path is considered absolute.
       3. If script is in current working directory.
       4. If script can be resolved through PATH. See <b><a href="../man7/path_resolution.7.html">path_resolution</a></b>(7).

       Current working directory is the calling process working directory unless the <b>--chdir</b> argument is passed,
       which will override the current working directory.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-A</b>, <b>--account</b>=&lt;<u>account</u>&gt;
              Charge  resources  used by this job to specified account.  The <u>account</u> is an arbitrary string. The
              account name may be changed after job submission using the <b>scontrol</b> command.

       <b>--acctg-freq</b>=&lt;<u>datatype</u>&gt;=&lt;<u>interval</u>&gt;[,&lt;<u>datatype</u>&gt;=&lt;<u>interval</u>&gt;...]
              Define the job accounting and profiling sampling intervals  in  seconds.   This  can  be  used  to
              override  the  <u>JobAcctGatherFrequency</u>  parameter  in  the  slurm.conf  file. &lt;<u>datatype</u>&gt;=&lt;<u>interval</u>&gt;
              specifies the task sampling interval for the jobacct_gather plugin or a sampling  interval  for  a
              profiling  type  by the acct_gather_profile plugin. Multiple comma-separated &lt;<u>datatype</u>&gt;=&lt;<u>interval</u>&gt;
              pairs may be specified. Supported <u>datatype</u> values are:

              <b>task</b>        Sampling interval for the  jobacct_gather  plugins  and  for  task  profiling  by  the
                          acct_gather_profile plugin.
                          <b>NOTE</b>:  This  frequency is used to monitor memory usage. If memory limits are enforced,
                          the highest frequency a user can request is what is configured in the slurm.conf file.
                          It can not be disabled.

              <b>energy</b>      Sampling interval for energy profiling using the acct_gather_energy plugin.

              <b>network</b>     Sampling interval for infiniband profiling using the acct_gather_interconnect plugin.

              <b>filesystem</b>  Sampling interval for filesystem profiling using the acct_gather_filesystem plugin.

              The default value for the task sampling interval is 30 seconds.  The default value for  all  other
              intervals  is  0.  An interval of 0 disables sampling of the specified type.  If the task sampling
              interval is 0, accounting information  is  collected  only  at  job  termination  (reducing  Slurm
              interference with the job).
              Smaller (non-zero) values have a greater impact upon job performance, but a value of 30 seconds is
              not likely to be noticeable for applications having less than 10,000 tasks.

       <b>-a</b>, <b>--array</b>=&lt;<u>indexes</u>&gt;
              Submit  a  job  array,  multiple  jobs  to  be  executed  with  identical parameters.  The <u>indexes</u>
              specification identifies what array index values should be used. Multiple values may be  specified
              using  a  comma  separated  list  and/or  a  range  of  values  with a "-" separator. For example,
              "--array=0-15" or "--array=0,6,16-32".  A step function  can  also  be  specified  with  a  suffix
              containing  a colon and number. For example, "--array=0-15:4" is equivalent to "--array=0,4,8,12".
              A maximum number of simultaneously running tasks from the job array may be specified using  a  "%"
              separator.   For  example  "--array=0-15%4"  will limit the number of simultaneously running tasks
              from this job array to 4.  The minimum index value is 0.  the maximum value is one less  than  the
              configuration parameter MaxArraySize.  <b>NOTE</b>: Currently, federated job arrays only run on the local
              cluster.

       <b>--batch</b>=&lt;<u>list</u>&gt;
              Nodes  can  have <b>features</b> assigned to them by the Slurm administrator.  Users can specify which of
              these <b>features</b> are required by their batch  script  using  this  options.   For  example  a  job's
              allocation  may  include  both  Intel  Haswell  and  KNL  nodes  with features "haswell" and "knl"
              respectively.  On such a configuration the batch script would normally benefit by executing  on  a
              faster   Haswell  node.   This  would  be  specified  using  the  option  "--batch=haswell".   The
              specification can include AND and OR operators using the ampersand and  vertical  bar  separators.
              For  example:  "--batch=haswell|broadwell"  or "--batch=haswell|big_memory".  The --batch argument
              must be a subset of the job's <b>--constraint</b>=&lt;<u>list</u>&gt; argument (i.e. the job can not request only  KNL
              nodes,  but require the script to execute on a Haswell node).  If the request can not be satisfied
              from the resources allocated to the job, the batch script will execute on the first  node  of  the
              job allocation.

       <b>--bb</b>=&lt;<u>spec</u>&gt;
              Burst  buffer  specification.  The form of the specification is system dependent.  Also see <b>--bbf</b>.
              When the <b>--bb</b> option is used, Slurm parses this option and creates a temporary burst buffer script
              file that is used internally by the burst buffer plugins. See Slurm's burst buffer guide for  more
              information and examples:
              https://slurm.schedmd.com/burst_buffer.html

       <b>--bbf</b>=&lt;<u>file_name</u>&gt;
              Path  of  file  containing  burst  buffer  specification.  The form of the specification is system
              dependent.  These burst buffer directives will be inserted into the submitted batch  script.   See
              Slurm's burst buffer guide for more information and examples:
              https://slurm.schedmd.com/burst_buffer.html

       <b>-b</b>, <b>--begin</b>=&lt;<u>time</u>&gt;
              Submit  the batch script to the Slurm controller immediately, like normal, but tell the controller
              to defer the allocation of the job until the specified time.

              Time may be of the form <u>HH:MM:SS</u> to run a job at a specific time of day  (seconds  are  optional).
              (If  that  time  is  already past, the next day is assumed.)  You may also specify <u>midnight</u>, <u>noon</u>,
              <u>elevenses</u> (11 AM), <u>fika</u> (3 PM) or <u>teatime</u> (4 PM) and you can have a time-of-day suffixed  with  <u>AM</u>
              or  <u>PM</u>  for running in the morning or the evening.  You can also say what day the job will be run,
              by specifying a date of the form <u>MMDDYY</u> or <u>MM/DD/YY</u> <u>YYYY-MM-DD</u>. Combine date and  time  using  the
              following  format  <u>YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]</u>.  You  can also give times like <u>now</u> <u>+</u> <u>count</u> <u>time-units</u>,
              where the time-units can be <u>seconds</u> (default), <u>minutes</u>, <u>hours</u>, <u>days</u>, or <u>weeks</u>  and  you  can  tell
              Slurm  to  run  the  job today with the keyword <u>today</u> and to run the job tomorrow with the keyword
              <u>tomorrow</u>.  The value may be changed after job submission using the <b>scontrol</b> command.  For example:

                 --begin=16:00
                 --begin=now+1hour
                 --begin=now+60           (seconds by default)
                 --begin=2010-01-20T12:34:00

              Notes on date/time specifications:
               - Although the 'seconds' field of the HH:MM:SS time specification is allowed by  the  code,  note
              that  the  poll time of the Slurm scheduler is not precise enough to guarantee dispatch of the job
              on the exact second. The job will be eligible to start on the next poll  following  the  specified
              time.  The  exact  poll interval depends on the Slurm scheduler (e.g., 60 seconds with the default
              sched/builtin).
               - If no time (HH:MM:SS) is specified, the default is (00:00:00).
               - If a date is specified without a year (e.g., MM/DD) then the current year  is  assumed,  unless
              the  combination  of  MM/DD  and HH:MM:SS has already passed for that year, in which case the next
              year is used.

       <b>-D</b>, <b>--chdir</b>=&lt;<u>directory</u>&gt;
              Set the working directory of the batch script to <u>directory</u> before it is executed. The path can  be
              specified as full path or relative path to the directory where the command is executed.

       <b>--cluster-constraint</b>=[!]&lt;<u>list</u>&gt;
              Specifies features that a federated cluster must have to have a sibling job submitted to it. Slurm
              will  attempt  to  submit  a  sibling  job  to  a  cluster if it has at least one of the specified
              features. If the "!" option is included, Slurm will attempt to submit a sibling job to  a  cluster
              that has none of the specified features.

       <b>-M</b>, <b>--clusters</b>=&lt;<u>string</u>&gt;
              Clusters  to  issue  commands  to. Multiple cluster names may be comma separated.  The job will be
              submitted to the one cluster providing the earliest expected  job  initiation  time.  The  default
              value  is  the  current  cluster.  A  value  of  '<u>all</u>' will query to run on all clusters. Note the
              <b>--export</b> option to control  environment  variables  exported  between  clusters.   Note  that  the
              <b>slurmdbd</b>  must  be  up  for  this  option  to  work  properly, unless running in a federation with
              <b>FederationParameters=fed_display</b> configured.

       <b>--comment</b>=&lt;<u>string</u>&gt;
              An arbitrary comment enclosed in double quotes if using spaces or some special characters.

       <b>-C</b>, <b>--constraint</b>=&lt;<u>list</u>&gt;
              Nodes can have <b>features</b> assigned to them by the Slurm administrator.  Users can specify  which  of
              these  <b>features</b>  are  required  by  their  job using the constraint option. If you are looking for
              'soft' constraints please see <b>--prefer</b> for more information.  Only nodes having features  matching
              the  job  constraints  will be used to satisfy the request.  Multiple constraints may be specified
              with AND, OR, matching OR, resource counts, etc. (some operators are not supported on  all  system
              types).

              <b>NOTE</b>: Changeable features are features defined by a NodeFeatures plugin.

              Supported <b>--constraint</b> options include:

              <b>Single</b> <b>Name</b>
                     Only   nodes   which   have   the   specified   feature   will   be   used.   For  example,
                     <b>--constraint="intel"</b>

              <b>Node</b> <b>Count</b>
                     A request can specify the number of nodes needed with some feature by appending an asterisk
                     and count after  the  feature  name.   For  example,  <b>--nodes=16</b>  <b>--constraint="graphics*4"</b>
                     indicates  that  the  job requires 16 nodes and that at least four of those nodes must have
                     the feature "graphics."  If requesting more than one feature and  using  node  counts,  the
                     request must have square brackets surrounding it.

                     <b>NOTE</b>:  This option is not supported by the helpers NodeFeatures plugin.  Heterogeneous jobs
                     can be used instead.

              <b>AND</b>    Only nodes with all of specified features will be used.  The ampersand is used for  an  AND
                     operator.  For example, <b>--constraint="intel&amp;gpu"</b>

              <b>OR</b>     Only  nodes with at least one of specified features will be used.  The vertical bar is used
                     for an OR operator. If changeable features are not requested, nodes in the  allocation  can
                     have  different  features. For example, <b>salloc</b> <b>-N2</b> <b>--constraint="intel|amd"</b> can result in a
                     job allocation where one node has the intel feature and the other node has the amd feature.
                     However, if the expression contains  a  changeable  feature,  then  all  OR  operators  are
                     automatically  treated as Matching OR so that all nodes in the job allocation have the same
                     set of features. For example, <b>salloc</b> <b>-N2</b> <b>--constraint="foo|bar&amp;baz"</b> The  job  is  allocated
                     two nodes where both nodes have foo, or bar and baz (one or both nodes could have foo, bar,
                     and  baz).  The  helpers  NodeFeatures plugin will find the first set of node features that
                     matches all nodes in the job allocation; these features are set as active features  on  the
                     node   and  passed  to  RebootProgram  (see  <b><a href="../man5/slurm.conf.5.html">slurm.conf</a></b>(5))  and  the  helper  script  (see
                     <b><a href="../man5/helpers.conf.5.html">helpers.conf</a></b>(5)). In this case, the helpers plugin uses the first  of  "foo"  or  "bar,baz"
                     that match the two nodes in the job allocation.

              <b>Matching</b> <b>OR</b>
                     If  only  one of a set of possible options should be used for all allocated nodes, then use
                     the  OR  operator  and  enclose  the  options  within  square   brackets.    For   example,
                     <b>--constraint="[rack1|rack2|rack3|rack4]"</b>  might  be  used to specify that all nodes must be
                     allocated on a single rack of the cluster, but any of those four racks can be used.

              <b>Multiple</b> <b>Counts</b>
                     Specific counts of multiple resources may be  specified  by  using  the  AND  operator  and
                     enclosing      the      options      within      square     brackets.      For     example,
                     <b>--constraint="[rack1*2&amp;rack2*4]"</b> might be used to specify that two nodes must be  allocated
                     from nodes with the feature of "rack1" and four nodes must be allocated from nodes with the
                     feature "rack2".

                     <b>NOTE</b>: This construct does not support multiple Intel KNL NUMA or MCDRAM modes. For example,
                     while        <b>--constraint="[(knl&amp;quad)*2&amp;(knl&amp;hemi)*4]"</b>       is       not       supported,
                     <b>--constraint="[haswell*2&amp;(knl&amp;hemi)*4]"</b> is supported.  Specification of multiple KNL  modes
                     requires the use of a heterogeneous job.

                     <b>NOTE</b>: This option is not supported by the helpers NodeFeatures plugin.

                     <b>NOTE</b>: Multiple Counts can cause jobs to be allocated with a non-optimal network layout.

              <b>Brackets</b>
                     Brackets can be used to indicate that you are looking for a set of nodes with the different
                     requirements       contained       within       the       brackets.       For      example,
                     <b>--constraint="[(rack1|rack2)*1&amp;(rack3)*2]"</b> will get you one node with either the "rack1" or
                     "rack2" features and two nodes with the "rack3"  feature.   If  requesting  more  than  one
                     feature and using node counts, the request must have square brackets surrounding it.

                     <b>NOTE</b>: Brackets are only reserved for <b>Multiple</b> <b>Counts</b> and <b>Matching</b> <b>OR</b> syntax.  AND operators
                     require  a  count  for  each feature inside square brackets (i.e. "[quad*2&amp;hemi*1]"). Slurm
                     will only allow a single set of bracketed constraints per job.

                     <b>NOTE</b>: Square brackets are not supported by the helpers NodeFeatures plugin. Matching OR can
                     be requested without square brackets by using the vertical bar character with at least  one
                     changeable feature.

              <b>Parentheses</b>
                     Parentheses   can   be   used   to   group   like  node  features  together.  For  example,
                     <b>--constraint="[(knl&amp;snc4&amp;flat)*4&amp;haswell*1]"</b> might be used to specify that four nodes  with
                     the  features  "knl",  "snc4"  and  "flat"  plus  one  node  with the feature "haswell" are
                     required.  Parentheses can also be used to  group  operations.  Without  parentheses,  node
                     features  are  parsed strictly from left to right.  For example, <b>--constraint="foo&amp;bar|baz"</b>
                     requests nodes with foo and bar, or baz.  <b>--constraint="foo|bar&amp;baz"</b>  requests  nodes  with
                     foo   and   baz,   or   bar   and   baz   (note   how   baz  was  AND'd  with  everything).
                     <b>--constraint="foo&amp;(bar|baz)"</b> requests nodes with foo and at least one of bar or baz.  <b>NOTE</b>:
                     OR within parentheses should not be used with a KNL NodeFeatures plugin but is supported by
                     the helpers NodeFeatures plugin.

       <b>--container</b>=&lt;<u>path_to_container</u>&gt;
              Absolute path to OCI container bundle.

       <b>--container-id</b>=&lt;<u>container_id</u>&gt;
              Unique name for OCI container.

       <b>--contiguous</b>
              If set, then the allocated nodes must form a contiguous set.

              <b>NOTE</b>: If the SelectType is cons_tres this option  won't  be  honored  with  the  <b>topology/tree</b>  or
              <b>topology/3d_torus</b> plugins, both of which can modify the node ordering.

       <b>-S</b>, <b>--core-spec</b>=&lt;<u>num</u>&gt;
              Count  of Specialized Cores per node reserved by the job for system operations and not used by the
              application.  If AllowSpecResourcesUsage is enabled a job can override the  CoreSpecCount  of  all
              its allocated nodes with this option.  The overridden Specialized Cores will still be reserved for
              system  processes.   The job will get an implicit <b>--exclusive</b> allocation for the rest of the Cores
              on the nodes, resulting in the job's processes being able to use (and being charged for)  all  the
              Cores  on the nodes except for the overridden Specialized Cores.  This option can not be used with
              the <b>--thread-spec</b> option.

              <b>NOTE</b>: Explicitly setting a job's specialized core value implicitly sets the --exclusive option.

       <b>--cores-per-socket</b>=&lt;<u>cores</u>&gt;
              Restrict node selection to nodes with at least the specified  number  of  cores  per  socket.  See
              additional information under <b>-B</b> option above when task/affinity plugin is enabled.
              <b>NOTE</b>: This option may implicitly set the number of tasks (if <b>-n</b> was not specified) as one task per
              requested thread.

       <b>--cpu-freq</b>=&lt;<u>p1</u>&gt;[-<u>p2</u>][:<u>p3</u>]

              Request  that  job  steps  initiated  by  srun  commands  inside this sbatch script be run at some
              requested frequency if possible, on the CPUs selected for the step on the compute node(s).

              <b>p1</b> can be [#### | low | medium | high | highm1] which will set the frequency scaling_speed to  the
              corresponding value, and set the frequency scaling_governor to UserSpace. See below for definition
              of the values.

              <b>p1</b>  can be [Conservative | OnDemand | Performance | PowerSave] which will set the scaling_governor
              to the corresponding value. The governor has to be in  the  list  set  by  the  slurm.conf  option
              CpuFreqGovernors.

              When  <b>p2</b>  is  present, <b>p1</b> will be the minimum scaling frequency and <b>p2</b> will be the maximum scaling
              frequency. In that case the governor <b>p3</b> or CpuFreqDef cannot be UserSpace since it doesn't support
              a range.

              <b>p2</b> can be [#### | medium | high | highm1]. p2 must be greater than p1  and  is  incompatible  with
              UserSpace governor.

              <b>p3</b>  can  be [Conservative | OnDemand | Performance | PowerSave | SchedUtil | UserSpace] which will
              set the governor to the corresponding value.

              If <b>p3</b> is UserSpace, the frequency scaling_speed, scaling_max_freq  and  scaling_min_freq  will  be
              statically set to the value defined by <b>p1</b>.

              Any  requested  frequency  below  the  minimum  available frequency will be rounded to the minimum
              available frequency. In the  same  way,  any  requested  frequency  above  the  maximum  available
              frequency will be rounded to the maximum available frequency.

              The  <b>CpuFreqDef</b>  parameter  in  slurm.conf  will  be used to set the governor in absence of <b>p3</b>. If
              there's no <b>CpuFreqDef</b>, the default governor will be to use the system current governor set in each
              cpu. Specifying a range without <b>CpuFreqDef</b> or a specific governor is therefore not allowed.

              Acceptable values at present include:

              <b>####</b>          frequency in kilohertz

              <b>Low</b>           the lowest available frequency

              <b>High</b>          the highest available frequency

              <b>HighM1</b>        (high minus one) will select the next highest available frequency

              <b>Medium</b>        attempts to set a frequency in the middle of the available range

              <b>Conservative</b>  attempts to use the Conservative CPU governor

              <b>OnDemand</b>      attempts to use the OnDemand CPU governor (the default value)

              <b>Performance</b>   attempts to use the Performance CPU governor

              <b>PowerSave</b>     attempts to use the PowerSave CPU governor

              <b>UserSpace</b>     attempts to use the UserSpace CPU governor

       The following informational environment variable is set  in  the  job  step  when  <b>--cpu-freq</b>  option  is
       requested.
               SLURM_CPU_FREQ_REQ

       This environment variable can also be used to supply the value for the CPU frequency request if it is set
       when  the  'srun'  command  is  issued.  The <b>--cpu-freq</b> on the command line will override the environment
       variable value. The form on the  environment  variable  is  the  same  as  the  command  line.   See  the
       <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b> section for a description of the SLURM_CPU_FREQ_REQ variable.

       <b>NOTE</b>: This parameter is treated as a request, not a requirement.  If the job step's node does not support
       setting  the  CPU  frequency,  or  the requested value is outside the bounds of the legal frequencies, an
       error is logged, but the job step is allowed to continue.

       <b>NOTE</b>: Setting the frequency for just the CPUs of the job step implies that  the  tasks  are  confined  to
       those  CPUs.  If  task  confinement  (i.e.  the  task/affinity  TaskPlugin is enabled, or the task/cgroup
       TaskPlugin is enabled with "ConstrainCores=yes" set in cgroup.conf) is not configured, this parameter  is
       ignored.

       <b>NOTE</b>:  When  the step completes, the frequency and governor of each selected CPU is reset to the previous
       values.

       <b>NOTE</b>: When submitting jobs with the <b>--cpu-freq</b> option with linuxproc as the ProctrackType can cause  jobs
       to  run  too  quickly  before  Accounting  is  able  to  poll for job information. As a result not all of
       accounting information will be present.

       <b>--cpus-per-gpu</b>=&lt;<u>ncpus</u>&gt;
              Request that <u>ncpus</u> processors be allocated per allocated GPU.  Steps inheriting  this  value  will
              imply --exact.  Not compatible with the <b>--cpus-per-task</b> option.

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--cpus-per-task</b>=&lt;<u>ncpus</u>&gt;
              Advise  the  Slurm  controller  that ensuing job steps will require <u>ncpus</u> number of processors per
              task. Without this option, the controller will just try to allocate one processor per task.

              For instance, consider an application that has 4  tasks,  each  requiring  3  processors.  If  our
              cluster  is comprised of quad-processors nodes and we simply ask for 12 processors, the controller
              might give us only 3 nodes. However, by using the --cpus-per-task=3 options, the controller  knows
              that each task requires 3 processors on the same node, and the controller will grant an allocation
              of 4 nodes, one for each of the 4 tasks.

       <b>--deadline</b>=&lt;<u>OPT</u>&gt;
              Remove  the  job  if no ending is possible before this deadline (start &gt; (deadline - time[-min])).
              Default is no deadline. Note that if  neither  <b>DefaultTime</b>  nor  <b>MaxTime</b>  are  configured  on  the
              partition  the job is in, the job will need to specify some form of time limit (--time[-min]) if a
              deadline is to be used.

              Valid time formats are:
              HH:MM[:SS] [AM|PM]
              MMDD[YY] or MM/DD[/YY] or MM.DD[.YY]
              MM/DD[/YY]-HH:MM[:SS]
              YYYY-MM-DD[THH:MM[:SS]]]
              now[+<u>count</u>[seconds(default)|minutes|hours|days|weeks]]

       <b>--delay-boot</b>=&lt;<u>minutes</u>&gt;
              Do not reboot nodes in order to satisfied this job's feature specification if  the  job  has  been
              eligible to run for less than this time period.  If the job has waited for less than the specified
              period,  it  will  use  only  nodes which already have the specified features.  The argument is in
              units of minutes.  A default value may be set by  a  system  administrator  using  the  <b>delay_boot</b>
              option  of  the  <b>SchedulerParameters</b> configuration parameter in the slurm.conf file, otherwise the
              default value is zero (no delay).

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--dependency</b>=&lt;<u>dependency_list</u>&gt;
              Defer the start of this  job  until  the  specified  dependencies  have  been  satisfied.  Once  a
              dependency  is  satisfied,  it  is  removed  from  the  job.   &lt;<u>dependency_list</u>&gt;  is  of  the form
              &lt;<u>type:job_id[:job_id][,type:job_id[:job_id]]</u>&gt;  or   &lt;<u>type:job_id[:job_id][?type:job_id[:job_id]]</u>&gt;.
              All  dependencies must be satisfied if the "," separator is used.  Any dependency may be satisfied
              if the "?" separator is used.  Only one separator may be used. For instance:
              -d afterok:20:21,afterany:23

              means that the job can run only after a 0 return code of jobs 20 and 21 AND the completion of  job
              23. However:
              -d afterok:20:21?afterany:23
              means  that  any  of  the  conditions  (afterok:20 OR afterok:21 OR afterany:23) will be enough to
              release the job.  Many jobs can share the same dependency  and  these  jobs  may  even  belong  to
              different  users.  The  value  may  be  changed  after  job submission using the scontrol command.
              Dependencies on remote jobs are allowed in a federation.  Once a job dependency fails due  to  the
              termination  state  of a preceding job, the dependent job will never be run, even if the preceding
              job is requeued and has a different termination state in a subsequent execution.

              <b>after:job_id[[+time][:jobid[+time]...]]</b>
                     After the specified jobs start or are cancelled and 'time' in minutes  from  job  start  or
                     cancellation  happens, this job can begin execution. If no 'time' is given then there is no
                     delay after start or cancellation.

              <b>afterany:job_id[:jobid...]</b>
                     This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated.  This is the default
                     dependency type.

              <b>afterburstbuffer:job_id[:jobid...]</b>
                     This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated  and  any  associated
                     burst buffer stage out operations have completed.

              <b>aftercorr:job_id[:jobid...]</b>
                     A  task  of  this  job  array  can  begin  execution after the corresponding task ID in the
                     specified job has completed successfully (ran to completion with an exit code of zero).

              <b>afternotok:job_id[:jobid...]</b>
                     This job can begin execution after the specified jobs have terminated in some failed  state
                     (non-zero  exit  code, node failure, timed out, etc).  This job must be submitted while the
                     specified job is still active or within <b>MinJobAge</b>  seconds  after  the  specified  job  has
                     ended.

              <b>afterok:job_id[:jobid...]</b>
                     This  job  can  begin execution after the specified jobs have successfully executed (ran to
                     completion with an exit code of zero).  This job must be submitted while the specified  job
                     is still active or within <b>MinJobAge</b> seconds after the specified job has ended.

              <b>singleton</b>
                     This  job  can begin execution after any previously launched jobs sharing the same job name
                     and user have terminated.  In other words, only one job by that name and owned by that user
                     can be running or suspended at any point in time.  In a federation, a singleton  dependency
                     must  be  fulfilled on all clusters unless DependencyParameters=disable_remote_singleton is
                     used in slurm.conf.

       <b>-m</b>,
       <b>--distribution</b>={*|block|cyclic|arbitrary|plane=&lt;<u>size</u>&gt;}[:{*|block|cyclic|fcyclic}[:{*|block|cyclic|fcyclic}]][,{Pack|NoPack}]

              Specify alternate distribution methods for  remote  processes.   For  job  allocation,  this  sets
              environment  variables  that will be used by subsequent srun requests and also affects which cores
              will be selected for job allocation.

              This option controls the distribution  of  tasks  to  the  nodes  on  which  resources  have  been
              allocated, and the distribution of those resources to tasks for binding (task affinity). The first
              distribution  method  (before  the  first  ":")  controls the distribution of tasks to nodes.  The
              second distribution method (after the first ":")  controls  the  distribution  of  allocated  CPUs
              across sockets for binding to tasks. The third distribution method (after the second ":") controls
              the  distribution  of  allocated  CPUs  across  cores  for binding to tasks.  The second and third
              distributions apply only if task affinity is enabled.  The third distribution is supported only if
              the task/cgroup plugin is configured. The default value for each distribution type is specified by
              *.

              Note that with select/cons_tres, the number of CPUs allocated to  each  socket  and  node  may  be
              different.  Refer  to  https://slurm.schedmd.com/mc_support.html  for more information on resource
              allocation, distribution of tasks to nodes, and binding of tasks to CPUs.
              First distribution method (distribution of tasks across nodes):

              <b>*</b>      Use the default method for distributing tasks to nodes (block).

              <b>block</b>  The block distribution method will distribute tasks to a node such that  consecutive  tasks
                     share  a  node.  For  example,  consider an allocation of three nodes each with two cpus. A
                     four-task block distribution request will distribute those tasks to the  nodes  with  tasks
                     one  and  two  on the first node, task three on the second node, and task four on the third
                     node. Block distribution is the default behavior if the number of tasks exceeds the  number
                     of allocated nodes.

              <b>cyclic</b> The  cyclic distribution method will distribute tasks to a node such that consecutive tasks
                     are distributed over consecutive nodes (in a round-robin fashion). For example, consider an
                     allocation of three nodes each with two cpus. A four-task cyclic distribution request  will
                     distribute  those tasks to the nodes with tasks one and four on the first node, task two on
                     the second node, and  task  three  on  the  third  node.   Note  that  when  SelectType  is
                     select/cons_tres,  the  same  number  of  CPUs  may  not  be  allocated  on each node. Task
                     distribution will be round-robin among all the nodes with CPUs yet to be assigned to tasks.
                     Cyclic distribution is the default behavior if the number of tasks is no  larger  than  the
                     number of allocated nodes.

              <b>plane</b>  The  tasks  are  distributed  in  blocks  of  size  &lt;<u>size</u>&gt;.  The  size  must  be  given  or
                     SLURM_DIST_PLANESIZE must be set. The number of tasks distributed to each node is the  same
                     as for cyclic distribution, but the taskids assigned to each node depend on the plane size.
                     Additional  distribution  specifications  cannot  be  combined  with this option.  For more
                     details       (including       examples       and       diagrams),        please        see
                     https://slurm.schedmd.com/mc_support.html and https://slurm.schedmd.com/dist_plane.html

              <b>arbitrary</b>
                     The  arbitrary  method  of  distribution will allocate processes in-order as listed in file
                     designated by the environment variable SLURM_HOSTFILE. If this variable is listed  it  will
                     override  any  other method specified. If not set the method will default to block.  Inside
                     the hostfile must contain at minimum the number of hosts requested and be one per  line  or
                     comma  separated.  If  specifying  a task count (<b>-n</b>, <b>--ntasks</b>=&lt;<u>number</u>&gt;), your tasks will be
                     laid out on the nodes in the order of the file.
                     <b>NOTE</b>: The arbitrary distribution option on a job allocation only controls the nodes  to  be
                     allocated  to  the  job and not the allocation of CPUs on those nodes. This option is meant
                     primarily to control a job step's task layout in an existing job allocation  for  the  srun
                     command.
                     <b>NOTE</b>:  If  the  number  of  tasks is given and a list of requested nodes is also given, the
                     number of nodes used from that list will be reduced to match that of the number of tasks if
                     the number of nodes in the list is greater than the number of tasks.

              Second distribution method (distribution of CPUs across sockets for binding):

              <b>*</b>      Use the default method for distributing CPUs across sockets (cyclic).

              <b>block</b>  The block distribution method will distribute allocated CPUs consecutively  from  the  same
                     socket for binding to tasks, before using the next consecutive socket.

              <b>cyclic</b> The  cyclic  distribution method will distribute allocated CPUs for binding to a given task
                     consecutively from the same socket, and from the next consecutive socket for the next task,
                     in a round-robin fashion across sockets.  Tasks requiring more than one CPU will  have  all
                     of those CPUs allocated on a single socket if possible.
                     <b>NOTE</b>:  In  nodes  with  hyper-threading  enabled,  a  task not requesting full cores may be
                     distributed across sockets. This can be avoided by  specifying  <b>--ntasks-per-core=1</b>,  which
                     forces tasks to allocate full cores.

              <b>fcyclic</b>
                     The  fcyclic  distribution  method will distribute allocated CPUs for binding to tasks from
                     consecutive sockets in a round-robin fashion across the sockets.  Tasks requiring more than
                     one CPU will have each CPUs allocated in a cyclic fashion across sockets.

              Third distribution method (distribution of CPUs across cores for binding):

              <b>*</b>      Use  the  default  method  for  distributing  CPUs  across  cores  (inherited  from  second
                     distribution method).

              <b>block</b>  The  block  distribution  method will distribute allocated CPUs consecutively from the same
                     core for binding to tasks, before using the next consecutive core.

              <b>cyclic</b> The cyclic distribution method will distribute allocated CPUs for binding to a  given  task
                     consecutively  from the same core, and from the next consecutive core for the next task, in
                     a round-robin fashion across cores.

              <b>fcyclic</b>
                     The fcyclic distribution method will distribute allocated CPUs for binding  to  tasks  from
                     consecutive cores in a round-robin fashion across the cores.

              Optional control for task distribution over nodes:

              <b>Pack</b>   Rather  than evenly distributing a job step's tasks evenly across its allocated nodes, pack
                     them as tightly as possible on  the  nodes.   This  only  applies  when  the  "block"  task
                     distribution method is used.

              <b>NoPack</b> Rather than packing a job step's tasks as tightly as possible on the nodes, distribute them
                     evenly.    This   user   option   will  supersede  the  SelectTypeParameters  CR_Pack_Nodes
                     configuration parameter.

       <b>-e</b>, <b>--error</b>=&lt;<u>filename_pattern</u>&gt;
              Instruct Slurm to connect the batch script's standard error directly to the file name specified in
              the "<u>filename</u> <u>pattern</u>".  By default both standard output and standard error are  directed  to  the
              same  file.   For  job arrays, the default file name is "slurm-%A_%a.out", "%A" is replaced by the
              job ID and "%a" with the array index.  For other jobs, the default file  name  is  "slurm-%j.out",
              where  the  "%j"  is  replaced by the job ID.  See the <b>filename</b> <b>pattern</b> section below for filename
              specification options.

       <b>-x</b>, <b>--exclude</b>=&lt;<u>node_name_list</u>&gt;
              Explicitly exclude certain nodes from the resources granted to the job.

       <b>--exclusive</b>[={user|mcs|topo}]
              The job allocation can not share nodes (or topology segment  with the "=topo") with other  running
              jobs  (or  just  other users with the "=user" option or with the "=mcs" option).  If user/mcs/topo
              are not specified (i.e. the job allocation can not share nodes with other running jobs),  the  job
              is  allocated  all  CPUs  and  GRES  on all nodes in the allocation, but is only allocated as much
              memory as it requested. This is by design to support gang scheduling, because suspended jobs still
              reside in memory. To request all the memory on a node, use <b>--mem=0</b>.  The default  shared/exclusive
              behavior depends on system configuration and the partition's <b>OverSubscribe</b> option takes precedence
              over  the  job's  option.  <b>NOTE</b>: Since shared GRES (MPS) cannot be allocated at the same time as a
              sharing GRES (GPU) this option only allocates all sharing GRES and no underlying shared GRES.

              <b>NOTE</b>: This option is mutually exclusive with <b>--oversubscribe</b>.

       <b>--export</b>={[ALL,]&lt;<u>environment_variables</u>&gt;|ALL|NIL|NONE}
              Identify which environment variables  from  the  submission  environment  are  propagated  to  the
              launched application. Note that SLURM_* variables are always propagated.

              <b>--export</b>=ALL
                        Default  mode if <b>--export</b> is not specified. All of the user's environment will be loaded
                        (either from the caller's environment or from a clean environment if  <u>--get-user-env</u>  is
                        specified).

              <b>--export</b>=NIL
                        Only  SLURM_* and SPANK option variables from the user environment will be defined. User
                        must use absolute path to the binary to be executed that will  define  the  environment.
                        User can not specify explicit environment variables with "NIL".

                        Unlike  NONE,  NIL  will  not  automatically  create  a  user's  environment  using  the
                        <u>--get-user-env</u> mechanism.

              <b>--export</b>=NONE
                        Only SLURM_* and SPANK option variables from the user environment will be defined.  User
                        must  use  absolute  path to the binary to be executed that will define the environment.
                        User can not specify explicit environment variables with "NONE".   However,  Slurm  will
                        then  implicitly  attempt to load the user's environment on the node where the script is
                        being executed, as if <u>--get-user-env</u> was specified.

                        This option is particularly important for jobs that are submitted  on  one  cluster  and
                        execute  on  a different cluster (e.g. with different paths).  To avoid steps inheriting
                        environment export settings (e.g. "NONE") from sbatch command, the environment  variable
                        SLURM_EXPORT_ENV should be set to "ALL" in the job script.

              <b>--export</b>=[<u>ALL</u>,]&lt;<u>environment_variables</u>&gt;
                        Exports all SLURM_* and SPANK option environment variables along with explicitly defined
                        variables.  Multiple  environment variable names should be comma separated.  Environment
                        variable names may be specified to propagate the current value (e.g.  "--export=EDITOR")
                        or  specific  values  may  be  exported (e.g. "--export=EDITOR=/bin/emacs"). If "ALL" is
                        specified, then all user environment variables will be loaded and will  take  precedence
                        over any explicitly given environment variables.

                   Example: <b>--export</b>=EDITOR,ARG1=test
                        In  this  example, the propagated environment will only contain the variable <u>EDITOR</u> from
                        the user's environment, <u>SLURM_*</u> environment variables, and <u>ARG1</u>=test.

                   Example: <b>--export</b>=ALL,EDITOR=/bin/emacs
                        There are two possible  outcomes  for  this  example.  If  the  caller  has  the  <u>EDITOR</u>
                        environment  variable defined, then the job's environment will inherit the variable from
                        the caller's environment. If the caller doesn't have an environment variable defined for
                        <u>EDITOR</u>, then the job's environment will use the value given by <b>--export</b>.

              <b>NOTE</b>: NONE and [<u>ALL</u>,]&lt;<u>environment_variables</u>&gt; implicitly work as  if  <b>--get-user-env</b>  was  defined.
              Please see the implications of this in its respective section.

       <b>--export-file</b>={&lt;<u>filename</u>&gt;|&lt;<u>fd</u>&gt;}
              If  a  number  between 3 and OPEN_MAX is specified as the argument to this option, a readable file
              descriptor will be assumed (STDIN and STDOUT are not supported as valid  arguments).  Otherwise  a
              filename  is  assumed. Export environment variables defined in &lt;<u>filename</u>&gt; or read from &lt;<u>fd</u>&gt; to the
              job's execution environment. The content is one or more environment variable  definitions  of  the
              form  NAME=value, each separated by a null character. This allows the use of special characters in
              environment definitions.

       <b>--extra</b>=&lt;<u>string</u>&gt;
              An arbitrary string enclosed  in  single  or  double  quotes  if  using  spaces  or  some  special
              characters.

              If  <b>SchedulerParameters=extra_constraints</b> is enabled, this string is used for node filtering based
              on the <u>Extra</u> field in each node.

       <b>-B</b>, <b>--extra-node-info</b>=&lt;<u>sockets</u>&gt;[:<u>cores</u>[:<u>threads</u>]]
              Restrict node selection to nodes with at least the specified number of sockets, cores  per  socket
              and/or threads per core.
              <b>NOTE</b>:  These  options  do  not  specify  the  resource  allocation  size.  Each value specified is
              considered a minimum.  An asterisk (*) can be used as a placeholder indicating that all  available
              resources of that type are to be utilized. Values can also be specified as min-max. The individual
              levels can also be specified in separate options if desired:
                  <b>--sockets-per-node</b>=&lt;<u>sockets</u>&gt;
                  <b>--cores-per-socket</b>=&lt;<u>cores</u>&gt;
                  <b>--threads-per-core</b>=&lt;<u>threads</u>&gt;
              If  task/affinity  plugin is enabled, then specifying an allocation in this manner also results in
              subsequently launched tasks being bound to threads if the <b>-B</b>  option  specifies  a  thread  count,
              otherwise  an  option  of  <u>cores</u> if a core count is specified, otherwise an option of <u>sockets</u>.  If
              SelectType is configured to select/cons_tres, it must have a parameter of CR_Core, CR_Core_Memory,
              CR_Socket, or CR_Socket_Memory for this option to be honored.  If not specified, the scontrol show
              job will display 'ReqS:C:T=*:*:*'. This option applies to job allocations.
              <b>NOTE</b>: This option is mutually exclusive with <b>--hint</b>, <b>--threads-per-core</b> and <b>--ntasks-per-core</b>.
              <b>NOTE</b>: This option may implicitly set the number of tasks (if <b>-n</b> was not specified) as one task per
              requested thread.

       <b>--get-user-env</b>[=<u>timeout</u>][<u>mode</u>]
              This option will tell sbatch to retrieve the login environment variables for the user specified in
              the <b>--uid</b> option.  The environment variables are retrieved by running something of this sort "su -
              &lt;username&gt; -c <a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?env">/usr/bin/env</a>" and parsing the output.   Be  aware  that  any  environment  variables
              already  set  in  sbatch's  environment will take precedence over any environment variables in the
              user's login environment. Clear any environment variables before calling sbatch that  you  do  not
              want  propagated  to the spawned program.  The optional <u>timeout</u> value is in seconds. Default value
              is 8 seconds.  The optional <u>mode</u> value control the "su" options.  With a <u>mode</u> value of  "S",  "su"
              is  executed  without  the  "-"  option.   With a <u>mode</u> value of "L", "su" is executed with the "-"
              option, replicating the login environment.  If <u>mode</u> not specified, the mode established  at  Slurm
              build   time   is   used.    Example   of   use   include   "--get-user-env",  "--get-user-env=10"
              "--get-user-env=10L", and "--get-user-env=S".

              <b>NOTE</b>: The explicit or implicit use of <b>--get-user-env</b> relies in the capability  of  being  able  to
              create  PID  and  mount  namespaces.  It  is very advisable to ensure that PID and mount namespace
              creation is available and not limited (check that <b>/proc/sys/user/max_[pid|mnt]_namespaces</b>  is  not
              0).  Although  they  are not strictly mandatory for <b>--get-user-env</b> to work, they ensure that there
              are no orphan processes left after the environment is retrieved.

       <b>--gid</b>=&lt;<u>group</u>&gt;
              If <b>sbatch</b> is run as root, and the <b>--gid</b> option is used, submit the job with <u>group</u>'s  group  access
              permissions. <u>group</u> may be the group name or the numerical group ID.

       <b>--gpu-bind</b>=[verbose,]&lt;<u>type</u>&gt;
              Equivalent   to   --tres-bind=gres/gpu:[verbose,]&lt;<u>type</u>&gt;   See  <b>--tres-bind</b>  for  all  options  and
              documentation.

       <b>--gpu-freq</b>=[&lt;<u>type</u>]=<u>value</u>&gt;[,&lt;<u>type</u>=<u>value</u>&gt;][,verbose]
              Request that GPUs allocated to the job are configured with specific frequency values.  This option
              can be used to independently configure the GPU and its  memory  frequencies.   After  the  job  is
              completed,  the frequencies of all affected GPUs will be reset to the highest possible values.  In
              some cases, system power caps may override the requested values.  The field <u>type</u> can be  "memory".
              If  <u>type</u>  is  not  specified,  the GPU frequency is implied.  The <u>value</u> field can either be "low",
              "medium", "high", "highm1" or a numeric value in megahertz (MHz).  If the specified numeric  value
              is  not  possible,  a  value  as  close  as possible will be used. See below for definition of the
              values.  The <u>verbose</u> option causes current GPU frequency information to be  logged.   Examples  of
              use include "--gpu-freq=medium,memory=high" and "--gpu-freq=450".

              Supported <u>value</u> definitions:

              <b>low</b>       the lowest available frequency.

              <b>medium</b>    attempts to set a frequency in the middle of the available range.

              <b>high</b>      the highest available frequency.

              <b>highm1</b>    (high minus one) will select the next highest available frequency.

       <b>-G</b>, <b>--gpus</b>=[<u>type</u>:]&lt;<u>number</u>&gt;
              Specify  the total number of GPUs required for the job.  An optional GPU type specification can be
              supplied.  For example "--gpus=volta:3".  See  also  the  <b>--gpus-per-node</b>,  <b>--gpus-per-socket</b>  and
              <b>--gpus-per-task</b> options.
              <b>NOTE</b>: The allocation has to contain at least one GPU per node, or one of each GPU type per node if
              types are used. Use heterogeneous jobs if different nodes need different GPU types.

       <b>--gpus-per-node</b>=[<u>type</u>:]&lt;<u>number</u>&gt;
              Specify  the  number  of  GPUs  required  for  the job on each node included in the job's resource
              allocation.    An   optional   GPU   type   specification   can   be   supplied.    For    example
              "--gpus-per-node=volta:3".   Multiple  options  can  be  requested  in a comma separated list, for
              example:  "--gpus-per-node=volta:3,kepler:1".   See  also  the   <b>--gpus</b>,   <b>--gpus-per-socket</b>   and
              <b>--gpus-per-task</b> options.

       <b>--gpus-per-socket</b>=[<u>type</u>:]&lt;<u>number</u>&gt;
              Specify  the  number  of  GPUs  required for the job on each socket included in the job's resource
              allocation.    An   optional   GPU   type   specification   can   be   supplied.    For    example
              "--gpus-per-socket=volta:3".   Multiple  options  can  be requested in a comma separated list, for
              example: "--gpus-per-socket=volta:3,kepler:1".  Requires job to specify a sockets per node count (
              --sockets-per-node).  See also the <b>--gpus</b>, <b>--gpus-per-node</b> and <b>--gpus-per-task</b> options.

       <b>--gpus-per-task</b>=[<u>type</u>:]&lt;<u>number</u>&gt;
              Specify the number of GPUs required for the job on each task to be spawned in the  job's  resource
              allocation.     An   optional   GPU   type   specification   can   be   supplied.    For   example
              "--gpus-per-task=volta:1". Multiple options can be  requested  in  a  comma  separated  list,  for
              example:   "--gpus-per-task=volta:3,kepler:1".   See   also   the  <b>--gpus</b>,  <b>--gpus-per-socket</b>  and
              <b>--gpus-per-node</b> options.  This option requires an  explicit  task  count,  e.g.  -n,  --ntasks  or
              "--gpus=X  --gpus-per-task=Y"  rather  than  an  ambiguous  range of nodes with -N, --nodes.  This
              option  will  implicitly  set  --tres-bind=gres/gpu:per_task:&lt;gpus_per_task&gt;,  but  that  can   be
              overridden with an explicit --tres-bind=gres/gpu specification.

       <b>--gres</b>=&lt;<u>list</u>&gt;
              Specifies  a  comma-delimited  list of generic consumable resources.  The format for each entry in
              the list is "name[[:type]:count]".  The <u>name</u> is the type of consumable resource (e.g.  gpu).   The
              <u>type</u> is an optional classification for the resource (e.g. a100).  The <u>count</u> is the number of those
              resources  with  a  default  value  of  1.  The count can have a suffix of "k" or "K" (multiple of
              1024), "m" or "M" (multiple of 1024 x 1024), "g" or "G" (multiple of 1024 x 1024 x 1024),  "t"  or
              "T"  (multiple  of 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024), "p" or "P" (multiple of 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x
              1024).  The specified resources will be allocated to the job on each node.  The available  generic
              consumable  resources  is  configurable  by the system administrator.  A list of available generic
              consumable resources will be printed and the command will exit if the option argument  is  "help".
              Examples of use include "--gres=gpu:2", "--gres=gpu:kepler:2", and "--gres=help".

       <b>--gres-flags</b>=&lt;<u>type</u>&gt;
              Specify generic resource task binding options.

              <b>multiple-tasks-per-sharing</b>
                     Negate   <b>one-task-per-sharing</b>.   This   is   useful   if   it   is   set   by   default  in

              <b>disable-binding</b>
                     Negate <b>enforce-binding</b>. This is useful if it is set by default in <b>SelectTypeParameters</b>.

              <b>enforce-binding</b>
                     The only CPUs available to the job will be those bound to the selected GRES (i.e. the  CPUs
                     identified  in  the  gres.conf  file  will be strictly enforced). This option may result in
                     delayed initiation of a job.  For example a job requiring two GPUs  and  one  CPU  will  be
                     delayed  until  both  GPUs on a single socket are available rather than using GPUs bound to
                     separate sockets, however, the application performance may  be  improved  due  to  improved
                     communication  speed.   Requires  the  node  to be configured with more than one socket and
                     resource filtering will be performed on a per-socket basis.

       <b>-H,</b> <b>--hold</b>
              Specify the job is to be submitted in a held state (priority of zero).  A  held  job  can  now  be
              released using scontrol to reset its priority (e.g. "<u>scontrol</u> <u>release</u> <u>&lt;job_id&gt;</u>").

       <b>--ignore-pbs</b>
              Ignore all "#PBS" and "#BSUB" options specified in the batch script.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>--input</b>=&lt;<u>filename_pattern</u>&gt;
              Instruct Slurm to connect the batch script's standard input directly to the file name specified in
              the "<u>filename</u> <u>pattern</u>".

              By  default, "/dev/null" is open on the batch script's standard input and both standard output and
              standard error are directed to a file of the name "slurm-%j.out", where the "%j" is replaced  with
              the job allocation number, as described below in the <b>filename</b> <b>pattern</b> section.

       <b>-J</b>, <b>--job-name</b>=&lt;<u>jobname</u>&gt;
              Specify a name for the job allocation. The specified name will appear along with the job id number
              when  querying  running  jobs  on the system. The default is the name of the batch script, or just
              "sbatch" if the script is read on sbatch's standard input.

       <b>--kill-on-invalid-dep</b>=&lt;yes|no&gt;
              If a job has an invalid dependency and it can never run this parameter tells Slurm to terminate it
              or not. A terminated job state will be JOB_CANCELLED.  If this option is not specified the  system
              wide  behavior  applies.  By default the job stays pending with reason DependencyNeverSatisfied or
              if the kill_invalid_depend is specified in slurm.conf the job is terminated.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--licenses</b>=&lt;<u>license</u>&gt;[@<u>db</u>][:<u>count</u>][,<u>license</u>[@<u>db</u>][:<u>count</u>]...]
              Specification of licenses (or other resources available on all nodes of the cluster) which must be
              allocated to this job.  License names can be followed by a colon and count (the default  count  is
              one).  Multiple license names should be comma separated (e.g.  "--licenses=foo:4,bar").  To submit
              jobs using remote licenses, those served by the slurmdbd, specify the name of the server providing
              the licenses.  For example "--license=nastran@slurmdb:12".

              <b>NOTE</b>: When submitting heterogeneous jobs, license requests may only be made on the first component
              job.  For example "sbatch -L ansys:2 : script.sh".

       <b>--mail-type</b>=&lt;<u>type</u>&gt;
              Notify  user  by  email  when  certain event types occur.  Valid <u>type</u> values are NONE, BEGIN, END,
              FAIL, REQUEUE, ALL (equivalent to BEGIN,  END,  FAIL,  INVALID_DEPEND,  REQUEUE,  and  STAGE_OUT),
              INVALID_DEPEND  (dependency  never  satisfied),  STAGE_OUT  (burst  buffer  stage out and teardown
              completed), TIME_LIMIT, TIME_LIMIT_90 (reached 90 percent of time limit),  TIME_LIMIT_80  (reached
              80  percent of time limit), TIME_LIMIT_50 (reached 50 percent of time limit) and ARRAY_TASKS (send
              emails for each array task).  Multiple <u>type</u> values may be specified in  a  comma  separated  list.
              NONE  will  suppress  all event notifications, ignoring any other values specified.  By default no
              email notifications are sent.  The user to be notified is indicated with <b>--mail-user</b>.

              Unless the ARRAY_TASKS option is specified, mail notifications on job BEGIN, END, FAIL and REQUEUE
              apply to a job array as a whole rather than generating individual email messages for each task  in
              the job array.

       <b>--mail-user</b>=&lt;<u>user</u>&gt;
              User  to receive email notification of state changes as defined by <b>--mail-type</b>. This may be a full
              email address or a username. If a username is specified, the value from <b>MailDomain</b>  in  slurm.conf
              will be appended to create an email address.  The default value is the submitting user.

       <b>--mcs-label</b>=&lt;<u>mcs</u>&gt;
              Used only when the mcs/group plugin is enabled.  This parameter is a group among the groups of the
              user.  Default value is calculated by the Plugin mcs if it's enabled.

       <b>--mem</b>=&lt;<u>size</u>&gt;[<u>units</u>]
              Specify  the  real memory required per node.  Default units are megabytes.  Different units can be
              specified using the suffix [K|M|G|T].  Default value is <b>DefMemPerNode</b> and  the  maximum  value  is
              <b>MaxMemPerNode</b>.  If configured, both parameters can be seen using the <b>scontrol</b> <b>show</b> <b>config</b> command.
              This  parameter   would   generally   be   used   if   whole   nodes   are   allocated   to   jobs
              (<b>SelectType=select/linear</b>).   Also  see <b>--mem-per-cpu</b> and <b>--mem-per-gpu</b>.  The <b>--mem</b>, <b>--mem-per-cpu</b>
              and <b>--mem-per-gpu</b> options are mutually exclusive. If <b>--mem</b>,  <b>--mem-per-cpu</b>  or  <b>--mem-per-gpu</b>  are
              specified as command line arguments, then they will take precedence over the environment.

              <b>NOTE</b>:  A  memory size specification of zero is treated as a special case and grants the job access
              to all of the memory on each node.

              <b>NOTE</b>: Memory requests will not  be  strictly  enforced  unless  Slurm  is  configured  to  use  an
              enforcement  mechanism. See <b>ConstrainRAMSpace</b> in the <b><a href="../man5/cgroup.conf.5.html">cgroup.conf</a></b>(5) man page and <b>OverMemoryKill</b> in

       <b>--mem-bind</b>=[{quiet|verbose},]&lt;<u>type</u>&gt;
              Bind tasks to memory. Used only when the task/affinity plugin  is  enabled  and  the  NUMA  memory
              functions  are  available.   <b>Note</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>CPU</b> <b>and</b> <b>memory</b> <b>binding</b> <b>may</b> <b>differ</b> <b>on</b> <b>some</b>
              <b>architectures.</b> For example, CPU binding may be performed at  the  level  of  the  cores  within  a
              processor  while  memory  binding will be performed at the level of nodes, where the definition of
              "nodes" may differ from system to system.  By default no memory binding  is  performed;  any  task
              using  any CPU can use any memory. This option is typically used to ensure that each task is bound
              to the memory closest to its assigned CPU. <b>The</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>type</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>"none"</b> <b>or</b> <b>"local"</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b>
              <b>recommended.</b>

              <b>NOTE</b>: To have Slurm always report on the selected memory binding for all commands  executed  in  a
              shell,  you  can  enable  verbose mode by setting the SLURM_MEM_BIND environment variable value to
              "verbose".

              The following informational environment variables are set when <b>--mem-bind</b> is in use:

                 SLURM_MEM_BIND_LIST
                 SLURM_MEM_BIND_PREFER
                 SLURM_MEM_BIND_SORT
                 SLURM_MEM_BIND_TYPE
                 SLURM_MEM_BIND_VERBOSE

              See the  <b>ENVIRONMENT</b>  <b>VARIABLES</b>  section  for  a  more  detailed  description  of  the  individual
              SLURM_MEM_BIND* variables.

              Supported options include:

              <b>help</b>   show this help message

              <b>local</b>  Use memory local to the processor in use

              <b>map_mem:&lt;list&gt;</b>
                     Bind   by  setting  memory  masks  on  tasks  (or  ranks)  as  specified  where  &lt;list&gt;  is
                     &lt;numa_id_for_task_0&gt;,&lt;numa_id_for_task_1&gt;,...  The mapping is  specified  for  a  node  and
                     identical  mapping  is  applied to the tasks on every node (i.e. the lowest task ID on each
                     node is mapped to the first ID specified in the list, etc.).  NUMA IDs are  interpreted  as
                     decimal  values  unless  they  are  preceded  with  '0x'  in which case they interpreted as
                     hexadecimal values.  If the number of tasks (or ranks) exceeds the number  of  elements  in
                     this list, elements in the list will be reused as needed starting from the beginning of the
                     list.   To  simplify  support  for  large  task  counts, the lists may follow a map with an
                     asterisk and repetition  count.   For  example  "map_mem:0x0f*4,0xf0*4".   For  predictable
                     binding results, all CPUs for each node in the job should be allocated to the job.

              <b>mask_mem:&lt;list&gt;</b>
                     Bind   by  setting  memory  masks  on  tasks  (or  ranks)  as  specified  where  &lt;list&gt;  is
                     &lt;numa_mask_for_task_0&gt;,&lt;numa_mask_for_task_1&gt;,...  The mapping is specified for a node  and
                     identical  mapping  is  applied to the tasks on every node (i.e. the lowest task ID on each
                     node is mapped to the first mask specified in the  list,  etc.).   NUMA  masks  are  <b>always</b>
                     interpreted  as  hexadecimal  values.  Note that masks must be preceded with a '0x' if they
                     don't begin with [0-9] so they are seen as numerical values.  If the number  of  tasks  (or
                     ranks)  exceeds the number of elements in this list, elements in the list will be reused as
                     needed starting from the beginning of the list.  To simplify support for large task counts,
                     the lists  may  follow  a  mask  with  an  asterisk  and  repetition  count.   For  example
                     "mask_mem:0*4,1*4".   For  predictable  binding  results, all CPUs for each node in the job
                     should be allocated to the job.

              <b>no[ne]</b> don't bind tasks to memory (default)

              <b>p[refer]</b>
                     Prefer use of first specified NUMA node, but permit
                      use of other available NUMA nodes.

              <b>q[uiet]</b>
                     quietly bind before task runs (default)

              <b>rank</b>   bind by task rank (not recommended)

              <b>sort</b>   sort free cache pages (run zonesort on Intel KNL nodes)

              <b>v[erbose]</b>
                     verbosely report binding before task runs

       <b>--mem-per-cpu</b>=&lt;<u>size</u>&gt;[<u>units</u>]
              Minimum memory required per usable allocated CPU.  Default units are megabytes.  The default value
              is <b>DefMemPerCPU</b> and the maximum value is <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b> (see exception below). If  configured,  both
              parameters  can  be  seen  using  the  <b>scontrol</b>  <b>show</b>  <b>config</b>  command.   Note  that  if the job's
              <b>--mem-per-cpu</b> value exceeds the configured <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b>, then the user's limit will be treated  as
              a  memory  limit  per  task; <b>--mem-per-cpu</b> will be reduced to a value no larger than <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b>;
              <b>--cpus-per-task</b> will be set and the value of <b>--cpus-per-task</b> multiplied by the  new  <b>--mem-per-cpu</b>
              value  will  equal  the  original <b>--mem-per-cpu</b> value specified by the user.  This parameter would
              generally be used if individual processors are allocated  to  jobs  (<b>SelectType=select/cons_tres</b>).
              If resources are allocated by core, socket, or whole nodes, then the number of CPUs allocated to a
              job  may  be  higher  than  the  task  count  and  the  value  of <b>--mem-per-cpu</b> should be adjusted
              accordingly.  Also see <b>--mem</b>  and  <b>--mem-per-gpu</b>.   The  <b>--mem</b>,  <b>--mem-per-cpu</b>  and  <b>--mem-per-gpu</b>
              options are mutually exclusive.

              <b>NOTE</b>:  If  the  final  amount  of memory requested by a job can't be satisfied by any of the nodes
              configured in the partition, the job will be rejected.  This could happen if <b>--mem-per-cpu</b> is used
              with the <b>--exclusive</b> option for a job allocation and <b>--mem-per-cpu</b> times the number of CPUs  on  a
              node is greater than the total memory of that node.

              <b>NOTE</b>: This applies to <b>usable</b> allocated CPUs in a job allocation.  This is important when more than
              one  thread  per core is configured.  If a job requests --threads-per-core with fewer threads on a
              core than exist on the core (or --hint=nomultithread which implies --threads-per-core=1), the  job
              will  be  unable  to use those extra threads on the core and those threads will not be included in
              the memory per CPU calculation. But if the job has access  to  all  threads  on  the  core,  those
              threads  will  be  included  in  the memory per CPU calculation even if the job did not explicitly
              request those threads.

              In the following examples, each core has two threads.

              In this first example, two tasks can run  on  separate  hyperthreads  in  the  same  core  because
              --threads-per-core is not used. The third task uses both threads of the second core. The allocated
              memory per cpu includes all threads:

              <b>$</b> <b>salloc</b> <b>-n3</b> <b>--mem-per-cpu=100</b>
              <b>salloc:</b> <b>Granted</b> <b>job</b> <b>allocation</b> <b>17199</b>
              <b>$</b> <b>sacct</b> <b>-j</b> <b>$SLURM_JOB_ID</b> <b>-X</b> <b>-o</b> <b>jobid%7,reqtres%35,alloctres%35</b>
                <b>JobID</b>                             <b>ReqTRES</b>                           <b>AllocTRES</b>
              <b>-------</b> <b>-----------------------------------</b> <b>-----------------------------------</b>
                <b>17199</b>     <b>billing=3,cpu=3,mem=300M,node=1</b>     <b>billing=4,cpu=4,mem=400M,node=1</b>

              In this second example, because of --threads-per-core=1, each task is allocated an entire core but
              is  only  able  to  use  one  thread  per  core. Allocated CPUs includes all threads on each core.
              However, allocated memory per cpu includes only the usable thread in each core.

              <b>$</b> <b>salloc</b> <b>-n3</b> <b>--mem-per-cpu=100</b> <b>--threads-per-core=1</b>
              <b>salloc:</b> <b>Granted</b> <b>job</b> <b>allocation</b> <b>17200</b>

       <b>--mem-per-gpu</b>=&lt;<u>size</u>&gt;[<u>units</u>]
              Minimum memory required per allocated GPU.  Default units are megabytes.  Different units  can  be
              specified  using  the  suffix [K|M|G|T].  Default value is <b>DefMemPerGPU</b> and is available on both a
              global and per partition basis.  If configured, the parameters can be seen using the <b>scontrol</b> <b>show</b>
              <b>config</b> and <b>scontrol</b> <b>show</b> <b>partition</b> commands.   Also  see  <b>--mem</b>.   The  <b>--mem</b>,  <b>--mem-per-cpu</b>  and
              <b>--mem-per-gpu</b> options are mutually exclusive.

       <b>--mincpus</b>=&lt;<u>n</u>&gt;
              Specify a minimum number of logical cpus/processors per node.

       <b>--network</b>=&lt;<u>type</u>&gt;
              Specify  information  pertaining  to  the switch or network.  The interpretation of <u>type</u> is system
              dependent.  This option is supported when running Slurm on a Cray natively. It is used to  request
              using  Network  Performance  Counters.  Only one value per request is valid.  All options are case
              in-sensitive.  In this configuration supported values include:

              <b>system</b>
                    Use the system-wide network performance counters. Only nodes requested will be marked in use
                    for the job allocation. If the job does not fill up the entire system the rest of the  nodes
                    are  not  able  to  be  used  by  other  jobs  using NPC, if idle their state will appear as
                    PerfCnts. These nodes are still available for other jobs not using NPC.

              <b>blade</b> Use the blade network performance counters. Only nodes requested will be marked in  use  for
                    the  job  allocation.  If  the job does not fill up the entire blade(s) allocated to the job
                    those blade(s) are not able to be used by other jobs using NPC, if  idle  their  state  will
                    appear as PerfCnts. These nodes are still available for other jobs not using NPC.

              In all cases the job allocation request <b>must</b> <b>specify</b> <b>the</b> <b>--exclusive</b> <b>option</b>. Otherwise the request
              will be denied.

              Also  with  any  of these options steps are not allowed to share blades, so resources would remain
              idle inside an allocation if the step running on a blade does not take up all  the  nodes  on  the
              blade.

              The  <b>network</b>  option  is  also available on systems with HPE Slingshot networks. It can be used to
              request a job VNI (to be used for communication between job steps in a job). It also can  be  used
              to  override  the  default  network  resources  allocated for the job step. Multiple values may be
              specified in a comma-separated list.

              <b>tcs</b>=&lt;<u>class1</u>&gt;[:&lt;<u>class2</u>&gt;]...
                    Set of traffic classes  to  configure  for  applications.   Supported  traffic  classes  are
                    DEDICATED_ACCESS,  LOW_LATENCY,  BULK_DATA, and BEST_EFFORT. The traffic classes may also be
                    specified as TC_DEDICATED_ACCESS, TC_LOW_LATENCY, TC_BULK_DATA, and TC_BEST_EFFORT.

              <b>no_vni</b>
                    Don't allocate any VNIs for this job (even if multi-node).

              <b>job_vni</b>
                    Allocate a job VNI for this job.

              <b>single_node_vni</b>
                    Allocate a job VNI for this job, even if it is a single-node job.

              <b>adjust_limits</b>
                    If set, slurmd will set an upper bound on network resource reservations by taking  the  per-
                    NIC  maximum  resource  quantity  and  subtracting the reserved or used values (whichever is
                    higher) for any system network services; this is the default.

              <b>no_adjust_limits</b>
                    If set, slurmd will calculate network resource reservations based only upon the per-resource
                    configuration default and number of tasks in the application; it will not set an upper bound
                    on those reservation requests based on resource usage  of  already-existing  system  network
                    services.   Setting  this  will  mean  more application launches could fail based on network
                    resource exhaustion, but if the application absolutely needs a certain amount  of  resources
                    to function, this option will ensure that.

              <b>disable_rdzv_get</b>
                    Disable  rendezvous  gets  in  Slingshot  NICs,  which  can  improve performance for certain
                    applications.

              <b>def_&lt;rsrc&gt;</b>=&lt;<u>val</u>&gt;
                    Per-CPU reserved allocation for this resource.

              <b>res_&lt;rsrc&gt;</b>=&lt;<u>val</u>&gt;
                    Per-node reserved allocation for this resource.  If set, overrides the per-CPU allocation.

              <b>max_&lt;rsrc&gt;</b>=&lt;<u>val</u>&gt;
                    Maximum per-node limit for this resource.

              <b>depth</b>=&lt;<u>depth</u>&gt;
                    Multiplier for per-CPU resource allocation.  Default is the number of reserved CPUs  on  the
                    node.

              The resources that may be requested are:

              <b>txqs</b>  Transmit command queues. The default is 2 per-CPU, maximum 1024 per-node.

              <b>tgqs</b>  Target command queues. The default is 1 per-CPU, maximum 512 per-node.

              <b>eqs</b>   Event queues. The default is 2 per-CPU, maximum 2047 per-node.

              <b>cts</b>   Counters. The default is 1 per-CPU, maximum 2047 per-node.

              <b>tles</b>  Trigger list entries. The default is 1 per-CPU, maximum 2048 per-node.

              <b>ptes</b>  Portable table entries. The default is 6 per-CPU, maximum 2048 per-node.

              <b>les</b>   List entries. The default is 16 per-CPU, maximum 16384 per-node.

              <b>acs</b>   Addressing contexts. The default is 4 per-CPU, maximum 1022 per-node.

       <b>--nice</b>[=<u>adjustment</u>]
              Run  the  job  with  an  adjusted  scheduling  priority within Slurm. With no adjustment value the
              scheduling priority is decreased by 100. A negative nice value increases the  priority,  otherwise
              decreases it. The adjustment range is +/- 2147483645. Only privileged users can specify a negative
              adjustment.

       <b>-k</b>, <b>--no-kill</b>[=off]
              Do  not  automatically  terminate  a job if one of the nodes it has been allocated fails. The user
              will assume the responsibilities for fault-tolerance should a node fail.  The job allocation  will
              not  be  revoked  so the user may launch new job steps on the remaining nodes in their allocation.
              This option does not set the <b>SLURM_NO_KILL</b> environment variable.  Therefore, when  a  node  fails,
              steps  running  on  that  node  will  be  killed unless the <b>SLURM_NO_KILL</b> environment variable was
              explicitly set or srun calls within the job allocation explicitly requested --no-kill.

              Specify an optional argument of "off" to disable the  effect  of  the  <b>SBATCH_NO_KILL</b>  environment
              variable.

              By  default Slurm terminates the entire job allocation if any node fails in its range of allocated
              nodes.

       <b>--no-requeue</b>
              Specifies that the batch job should never be requeued under any circumstances  (see  note  below).
              Setting  this  option  will  prevent system administrators from being able to restart the job (for
              example, after a scheduled downtime), recover from a node failure, or be requeued upon  preemption
              by  a  higher  priority  job.   When  a  job  is  requeued, the batch script is initiated from its
              beginning.  Also see the <b>--requeue</b> option.  The <u>JobRequeue</u> configuration  parameter  controls  the
              default behavior on the cluster.

              <b>NOTE</b>:  <b>ForceRequeueOnFail</b>  if  set  as  an  option  to the PrologFlags parameter in slurm.conf can
              override this setting.

       <b>-F</b>, <b>--nodefile</b>=&lt;<u>node_file</u>&gt;
              Much like <b>--nodelist</b>, but the list is contained in a file of name <u>node</u> <u>file</u>. The node names of the
              list may also span multiple lines in the file. Duplicate node names in the file will  be  ignored.
              The order of the node names in the list is not important; the node names will be sorted by Slurm.

       <b>-w</b>, <b>--nodelist</b>=&lt;<u>node_name_list</u>&gt;
              Request a specific list of hosts.  The job will contain <u>all</u> of these hosts and possibly additional
              hosts  as needed to satisfy resource requirements.  The list may be specified as a comma-separated
              list of hosts, a range of hosts (host[1-5,7,...] for example), or a filename.  The host list  will
              be  assumed  to  be  a  filename if it contains a "/" character.  If you specify a minimum node or
              processor count larger than can be satisfied by the supplied host list, additional resources  will
              be  allocated  on  other  nodes as needed.  Duplicate node names in the list will be ignored.  The
              order of the node names in the list is not important; the node names will be sorted by Slurm.

       <b>-N</b>, <b>--nodes</b>=&lt;<u>minnodes</u>&gt;[-<u>maxnodes</u>]|&lt;<u>size_string</u>&gt;
              Request that a minimum of <u>minnodes</u> nodes be allocated to this job.  A maximum node count may  also
              be specified with <u>maxnodes</u>.  If only one number is specified, this is used as both the minimum and
              maximum   node  count.  Node  count  can  be  also  specified  as  size_string.   The  size_string
              specification identifies what nodes values should be used.  Multiple values may be specified using
              a comma separated list or with a step function by suffix containing a colon and number values with
              a "-"  separator.   For  example,  "--nodes=1-15:4"  is  equivalent  to  "--nodes=1,5,9,13".   The
              partition's  node  limits  supersede  those of the job.  If a job's node limits are outside of the
              range permitted for its associated partition, the job will be  left  in  a  PENDING  state.   This
              permits  possible  execution  at a later time, when the partition limit is changed.  If a job node
              limit exceeds the number of nodes configured in the partition, the job  will  be  rejected.   Note
              that  the  environment  variable  <b>SLURM_JOB_NUM_NODES</b>  will  be set to the count of nodes actually
              allocated to the job. See the <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>  section for more information. If  <b>-N</b>  is  not
              specified,  the default behavior is to allocate enough nodes to satisfy the requested resources as
              expressed by per-job specification options, e.g. <b>-n</b>, <b>-c</b> and <b>--gpus</b>.  The job will be allocated  as
              many  nodes as possible within the range specified and without delaying the initiation of the job.
              The node count specification may include a numeric value followed by a suffix of  "k"  (multiplies
              numeric value by 1,024) or "m" (multiplies numeric value by 1,048,576).

              <b>NOTE</b>: This option cannot be used in with arbitrary distribution.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--ntasks</b>=&lt;<u>number</u>&gt;
              sbatch  does  not launch tasks, it requests an allocation of resources and submits a batch script.
              This option advises the Slurm controller that job steps run within the allocation  will  launch  a
              maximum  of  <u>number</u>  tasks  and  to provide for sufficient resources.  The default is one task per
              node, but note that the <b>--cpus-per-task</b> option will change this default.

       <b>--ntasks-per-core</b>=&lt;<u>ntasks</u>&gt;
              Request the maximum <u>ntasks</u> be invoked on each core.  Meant to be used with  the  <b>--ntasks</b>  option.
              Related  to <b>--ntasks-per-node</b> except at the core level instead of the node level. This option will
              be inherited by srun.  Slurm may allocate more cpus than what was requested in  order  to  respect
              this option.
              <b>NOTE</b>:  This  option  is  not  supported when using <u>SelectType=select/linear</u>. This value can not be
              greater than <b>--threads-per-core</b>.

       <b>--ntasks-per-gpu</b>=&lt;<u>ntasks</u>&gt;
              Request that there are <u>ntasks</u> tasks invoked for every GPU.  This option can work in two  ways:  1)
              either  specify  <b>--ntasks</b>  in  addition,  in  which  case  a  type-less  GPU specification will be
              automatically determined to satisfy <b>--ntasks-per-gpu</b>, or 2) specify  the  GPUs  wanted  (e.g.  via
              <b>--gpus</b>  or  <b>--gres</b>)  without  specifying  <b>--ntasks</b>, and the total task count will be automatically
              determined.  The number of CPUs needed will be automatically increased if necessary to  allow  for
              any  calculated task count.  This option will implicitly set <b>--tres-bind=gres/gpu:single:&lt;ntasks&gt;</b>,
              but that can be overridden with an explicit <b>--tres-bind=gres/gpu</b> specification.   This  option  is
              not compatible with a node range (i.e. -N&lt;<u>minnodes</u>-<u>maxnodes</u>&gt;).  This option is not compatible with
              <b>--gpus-per-task</b>,  <b>--gpus-per-socket</b>,  or  <b>--ntasks-per-node</b>.   This option is not supported unless
              <u>SelectType=cons_tres</u> is configured (either directly or indirectly on Cray systems).

       <b>--ntasks-per-node</b>=&lt;<u>ntasks</u>&gt;
              Request that <u>ntasks</u> be invoked on each node.  If used  with  the  <b>--ntasks</b>  option,  the  <b>--ntasks</b>
              option  will take precedence and the <b>--ntasks-per-node</b> will be treated as a <u>maximum</u> count of tasks
              per node.  Meant to be used with the <b>--nodes</b> option.  This is  related  to  <b>--cpus-per-task</b>=<u>ncpus</u>,
              but  does  not  require  knowledge of the actual number of cpus on each node. In some cases, it is
              more convenient to be able to request that no more than a specific number of tasks be  invoked  on
              each  node.  Examples  of  this  include  submitting  a  hybrid  MPI/OpenMP app where only one MPI
              "task/rank" should be assigned to each node while allowing the OpenMP portion to  utilize  all  of
              the  parallelism  present in the node, or submitting a single setup/cleanup/monitoring job to each
              node of a pre-existing allocation as one step in a larger job script.

       <b>--ntasks-per-socket</b>=&lt;<u>ntasks</u>&gt;
              Request the maximum <u>ntasks</u> be invoked on each socket.  Meant to be used with the <b>--ntasks</b>  option.
              Related  to  <b>--ntasks-per-node</b>  except  at the socket level instead of the node level.  <b>NOTE</b>: This
              option is not supported when using <u>SelectType=select/linear</u>.

       <b>--oom-kill-step</b>[={0|1}]
              Whether to kill the entire step if an OOM event is detected in any task of a step. This overwrites
              the "OOMKillStep" setting in TaskPluginParam from slurm.conf. When unset it will use  the  setting
              in slurm.conf. When set, a value of "0" will disable killing the entire step, while a value of "1"
              will  enable  it.  This applies to the entire allocation except for the external step.  Default is
              "1" (enabled) when the option is found with no value.

       <b>--open-mode</b>={append|truncate}
              Open the output and error files using append or truncate mode as specified.  The default value  is
              specified by the system configuration parameter <u>JobFileAppend</u>.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--output</b>=&lt;<u>filename_pattern</u>&gt;
              Instruct  Slurm  to connect the batch script's standard output directly to the file name specified
              in the "<u>filename</u> <u>pattern</u>".  By default both standard output and standard error are directed to the
              same file.  For job arrays, the default file name is "slurm-%A_%a.out", "%A" is  replaced  by  the
              job  ID  and  "%a" with the array index.  For other jobs, the default file name is "slurm-%j.out",
              where the "%j" is replaced by the job ID.  See the <b>filename</b> <b>pattern</b>  section  below  for  filename
              specification options.

       <b>-O</b>, <b>--overcommit</b>
              Overcommit resources.

              When applied to a job allocation (not including jobs requesting exclusive access to the nodes) the
              resources  are  allocated as if only one task per node is requested. This means that the requested
              number of cpus per task (<b>-c</b>, <b>--cpus-per-task</b>) are allocated per node rather than being  multiplied
              by  the  number of tasks. Options used to specify the number of tasks per node, socket, core, etc.
              are ignored.

              When applied to job step allocations (the <b>srun</b>  command  when  executed  within  an  existing  job
              allocation),  this  option  can be used to launch more than one task per CPU.  Normally, <b>srun</b> will
              not allocate more than one process  per  CPU.   By  specifying  <b>--overcommit</b>  you  are  explicitly
              allowing  more  than  one  process  per  CPU.  However  no  more than <b>MAX_TASKS_PER_NODE</b> tasks are
              permitted to execute per node. <b>NOTE</b>: <b>MAX_TASKS_PER_NODE</b> is defined in the file <u>slurm.h</u> and is  not
              a variable, it is set at Slurm build time.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--oversubscribe</b>
              The  job  allocation  can  over-subscribe  resources with other running jobs.  The resources to be
              over-subscribed can be nodes, sockets, cores, and/or hyperthreads  depending  upon  configuration.
              The   default  over-subscribe  behavior  depends  on  system  configuration  and  the  partition's
              <b>OverSubscribe</b> option takes precedence over the job's  option.   This  option  may  result  in  the
              allocation  being  granted  sooner than if the --oversubscribe option was not set and allow higher
              system utilization, but  application  performance  will  likely  suffer  due  to  competition  for
              resources.  Also see the --exclusive option.

              <b>NOTE</b>: This option is mutually exclusive with <b>--exclusive</b>.

       <b>--parsable</b>
              Outputs  only  the  job  id number and the cluster name if present.  The values are separated by a
              semicolon. Errors will still be displayed.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--partition</b>=&lt;<u>partition_names</u>&gt;
              Request a specific partition for the resource allocation. If not specified, the  default  behavior
              is  to  allow  the  slurm  controller  to select the default partition as designated by the system
              administrator. If the job can use more than one partition, specify their names in a comma separate
              list and the one offering earliest initiation will be used with no regard given to  the  partition
              name  ordering  (although  higher  priority partitions will be considered first).  When the job is
              initiated, the name of the partition used will be placed first in the job record partition string.

       <b>--prefer</b>=&lt;<u>list</u>&gt;
              Nodes can have <b>features</b> assigned to them by the Slurm administrator.  Users can specify  which  of
              these  <b>features</b>  are  desired  but not required by their job using the prefer option.  This option
              operates independently from <b>--constraint</b> and will override whatever  is  set  there  if  possible.
              When  scheduling,  the  features  in  <b>--prefer</b> are tried first. If a node set isn't available with
              those features then <b>--constraint</b> is attempted.  See <b>--constraint</b> for more information, this option
              behaves the same way.

       <b>--priority</b>=&lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Request a specific job priority.  May be subject to  configuration  specific  constraints.   <u>value</u>
              should  either be a numeric value or "TOP" (for highest possible value).  Only Slurm operators and
              administrators can set the priority of a job.

       <b>--profile</b>={all|none|&lt;<u>type</u>&gt;[,&lt;<u>type</u>&gt;...]}
              Enables detailed data collection by the acct_gather_profile plugin.  Detailed data  are  typically
              time-series  that  are stored in an HDF5 file for the job or an InfluxDB database depending on the
              configured plugin.

              <b>All</b>       All data types are collected. (Cannot be combined with other values.)

              <b>None</b>      No data types are collected. This is the default.
                         (Cannot be combined with other values.)

       Valid <u>type</u> values are:

              <b>Energy</b> Energy data is collected.

              <b>Task</b>   Task (I/O, Memory, ...) data is collected.

              <b>Lustre</b> Lustre data is collected.

              <b>Network</b>
                     Network (InfiniBand) data is collected.

       <b>--propagate</b>[=<u>rlimit</u>[,<u>rlimit</u>...]]
              Allows users to specify which of the modifiable (soft) resource limits to propagate to the compute
              nodes and apply to their jobs. If no <u>rlimit</u>  is  specified,  then  all  resource  limits  will  be
              propagated.   The  following rlimit names are supported by Slurm (although some options may not be
              supported on some systems):

              <b>ALL</b>       All limits listed below (default)

              <b>NONE</b>      No limits listed below

              <b>AS</b>        The maximum address space (virtual memory) for a process.

              <b>CORE</b>      The maximum size of core file

              <b>CPU</b>       The maximum amount of CPU time

              <b>DATA</b>      The maximum size of a process's data segment

              <b>FSIZE</b>     The maximum size of files created. Note that if the user sets FSIZE  to  less  than  the
                        current size of the slurmd.log, job launches will fail with a 'File size limit exceeded'
                        error.

              <b>MEMLOCK</b>   The maximum size that may be locked into memory

              <b>NOFILE</b>    The maximum number of open files

              <b>NPROC</b>     The maximum number of processes available

              <b>RSS</b>       The  maximum resident set size. Note that this only has effect with Linux kernels 2.4.30
                        or older or BSD.

              <b>STACK</b>     The maximum stack size

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--qos</b>=&lt;<u>qos</u>&gt;
              Request a quality of service for the job, or comma separated list of QOS.  If requesting a list it
              will be ordered based on the priority of the QOS given with the first being the highest  priority.
              QOS  values can be defined for each user/cluster/account association in the Slurm database.  Users
              will be limited to  their  association's  defined  set  of  qos's  when  the  Slurm  configuration
              parameter, AccountingStorageEnforce, includes "qos" in its definition.

       <b>-Q</b>, <b>--quiet</b>
              Suppress informational messages from sbatch such as Job ID. Only errors will still be displayed.

       <b>--reboot</b>
              Force  the  allocated  nodes  to reboot before starting the job.  This is only supported with some
              system configurations and will otherwise be silently ignored. Only root, <u>SlurmUser</u> or  admins  can
              reboot nodes.

       <b>--requeue</b>
              Specifies that the batch job should be eligible for requeuing.  The job may be requeued explicitly
              by  a system administrator, after node failure, or upon preemption by a higher priority job.  When
              a job is requeued, the batch script is initiated from its beginning with the same job ID. Also see
              the <b>--no-requeue</b> option.  The <u>JobRequeue</u> configuration parameter controls the default behavior  on
              the cluster.

       <b>--reservation</b>=&lt;<u>reservation_names</u>&gt;
              Allocate  resources  for  the  job  from  the  named reservation. If the job can use more than one
              reservation, specify their  names  in  a  comma  separate  list  and  the  one  offering  earliest
              initiation.  Each  reservation will be considered in the order it was requested.  All reservations
              will be listed in  scontrol/squeue  through  the  life  of  the  job.   In  accounting  the  first
              reservation will be seen and after the job starts the reservation used will replace it.

       <b>--resv-ports</b>[=<u>count</u>]
              Reserve  communication  ports  for  this  job.  Users  can specify the number of port they want to
              reserve. The parameter MpiParams=ports=12000-12999 must be specified in <u>slurm.conf</u>. If the  number
              of  reserved  ports  is  zero  then  no ports are reserved. Used for native Cray's PMI only.  This
              option can only be used if the slurmstepd step management is enabled.  This option applies to  job
              allocations. See <b>--stepmgr</b>.

       <b>--segment</b>=&lt;<u>segment_size</u>&gt;
              When  a  block topology is used, this defines the size of the segments that will be used to create
              the job allocation.  No requirement would be placed on all segments for a job needing to be placed
              within the same higher-level block.

              <b>NOTE</b>: The segment size must always be evenly divisible by the requested node count.

              <b>NOTE</b>: The segment size must be less than or equal to the planning base block  size.  E.g.,  for  a
              system with 30 nodes as the planning base block size, "--segment 40" would be invalid

       <b>--signal</b>=[{R|B}:]&lt;<u>sig_num</u>&gt;[@<u>sig_time</u>]
              When  a  job  is  within <u>sig_time</u> seconds of its end time, send it the signal <u>sig_num</u>.  Due to the
              resolution of event handling by Slurm, the signal may be  sent  up  to  60  seconds  earlier  than
              specified.   <u>sig_num</u>  may  either be a signal number or name (e.g. "10" or "USR1").  <u>sig_time</u> must
              have an integer value between 0 and 65535.  By default, no signal is sent  before  the  job's  end
              time.   If  a <u>sig_num</u> is specified without any <u>sig_time</u>, the default time will be 60 seconds.  Use
              the "B:" option to signal only the batch shell, none of the other processes will be  signaled.  By
              default  all  job  steps will be signaled, but not the batch shell itself.  Use the "R:" option to
              allow this job to overlap with a reservation with MaxStartDelay set. If the "R:" option  is  used,
              preemption  must  be  enabled  on  the  system, and if the job is preempted it will be requeued if
              allowed otherwise the job will be canceled.  To have the signal sent at preemption  time  see  the
              <b>send_user_signal</b> <b>PreemptParameter</b>.

       <b>--sockets-per-node</b>=&lt;<u>sockets</u>&gt;
              Restrict  node  selection  to  nodes with at least the specified number of sockets. See additional
              information under <b>-B</b> option above when task/affinity plugin is enabled.
              <b>NOTE</b>: This option may implicitly set the number of tasks (if <b>-n</b> was not specified) as one task per
              requested thread.

       <b>--spread-job</b>
              Spread the job allocation over as many nodes as possible and attempt to  evenly  distribute  tasks
              across the allocated nodes.  This option disables the topology/tree plugin.

       <b>--stepmgr</b>
              Enable slurmstepd step management per-job if it isn't enabled system wide.  This enables job steps
              to  be  managed  by  a  single  extern slurmstepd associated with the job to manage steps. This is
              beneficial for jobs that submit many steps inside their allocations. <b>PrologFlags=contain</b>  must  be
              set.

       <b>--switches</b>=&lt;<u>count</u>&gt;[@<u>max-time</u>]
              When  a tree topology is used, this defines the maximum count of leaf switches desired for the job
              allocation and optionally the maximum time to wait for that number of switches. If Slurm finds  an
              allocation  containing  more  switches  than the count specified, the job remains pending until it
              either finds an allocation with desired switch count or the time limit expires.  It  there  is  no
              switch  count  limit,  there  is  no  delay  in starting the job.  Acceptable time formats include
              "minutes",  "minutes:seconds",  "hours:minutes:seconds",  "days-hours",  "days-hours:minutes"  and
              "days-hours:minutes:seconds".   The  job's  maximum  time  delay  may  be  limited  by  the system
              administrator using the  <b>SchedulerParameters</b>  configuration  parameter  with  the  <b>max_switch_wait</b>
              parameter option.  On a dragonfly network the only switch count supported is 1 since communication
              performance  will  be  highest  when a job is allocate resources on one leaf switch or more than 2
              leaf switches.  The default max-time is the max_switch_wait SchedulerParameters.

       <b>--test-only</b>
              Validate the batch script and return an estimate of when a job would be scheduled to run given the
              current job queue and all the other arguments specifying the job requirements. No job is  actually
              submitted.

       <b>--thread-spec</b>=&lt;<u>num</u>&gt;
              Count  of  specialized  threads per node reserved by the job for system operations and not used by
              the application. The application will not use  these  threads,  but  will  be  charged  for  their
              allocation.  This option can not be used with the <b>--core-spec</b> option.

              <b>NOTE</b>:  Explicitly setting a job's specialized thread value implicitly sets its --exclusive option,
              reserving entire nodes for the job.

       <b>--threads-per-core</b>=&lt;<u>threads</u>&gt;
              Restrict node selection to nodes with at least the specified number of threads per core.  In  task
              layout, use the specified maximum number of threads per core. <b>NOTE</b>: "Threads" refers to the number
              of  processing  units  on each core rather than the number of application tasks to be launched per
              core.  See additional information under <b>-B</b> option above when task/affinity plugin is enabled.
              <b>NOTE</b>: This option may implicitly set the number of tasks (if <b>-n</b> was not specified) as one task per
              requested thread.

       <b>-t</b>, <b>--time</b>=&lt;<u>time</u>&gt;
              Set a limit on the total run time of the job allocation. If the requested time limit  exceeds  the
              partition's  time  limit,  the  job  will  be left in a PENDING state (possibly indefinitely). The
              default time limit is the partition's default time limit. When the time  limit  is  reached,  each
              task  in  each  job  step  is  sent  SIGTERM  followed by SIGKILL. The interval between signals is
              specified by the Slurm configuration parameter <b>KillWait</b>. The <b>OverTimeLimit</b> configuration parameter
              may permit the job to run longer than scheduled. Time resolution is one minute and  second  values
              are rounded up to the next minute.

              A  time  limit  of  zero  requests  that no time limit be imposed. Acceptable time formats include
              "minutes",  "minutes:seconds",  "hours:minutes:seconds",  "days-hours",  "days-hours:minutes"  and
              "days-hours:minutes:seconds".

       <b>--time-min</b>=&lt;<u>time</u>&gt;
              Set  a  minimum time limit on the job allocation.  If specified, the job may have its <b>--time</b> limit
              lowered to a value no lower than <b>--time-min</b> if doing so permits the job to begin execution earlier
              than otherwise possible.  The job's time limit will not be changed  after  the  job  is  allocated
              resources.   This  is performed by a backfill scheduling algorithm to allocate resources otherwise
              reserved for higher priority jobs.  Acceptable time formats include "minutes",  "minutes:seconds",
              "hours:minutes:seconds", "days-hours", "days-hours:minutes" and "days-hours:minutes:seconds".

       <b>--tmp</b>=&lt;<u>size</u>&gt;[<u>units</u>]
              Specify  a  minimum  amount  of  temporary  disk  space  per  node.   Default units are megabytes.
              Different units can be specified using the suffix [K|M|G|T].

       <b>--tres-bind</b>=&lt;<u>tres</u>&gt;:[verbose,]&lt;<u>type</u>&gt;[+&lt;<u>tres</u>&gt;:
              [verbose,]&lt;<u>type</u>&gt;...]  Specify a list of tres with their task binding options. Currently  gres  are
              the only supported tres for this options. Specify gres as "gres/&lt;gres_name&gt;" (e.g. gres/gpu)

              Example: --tres-bind=gres/gpu:verbose,map:0,1,2,3+gres/nic:closest

              By default, most tres are not bound to individual tasks

              Supported binding <u>type</u> options for <b>gres</b>:

              <b>closest</b>   Bind  each  task to the gres(s) which are closest.  In a NUMA environment, each task may
                        be bound to more than one gres (i.e.  all gres in that NUMA environment).

              <b>map:&lt;list&gt;</b>
                        Bind  by  setting  gres  masks  on  tasks  (or  ranks)  as  specified  where  &lt;list&gt;  is
                        &lt;gres_id_for_task_0&gt;,&lt;gres_id_for_task_1&gt;,...   gres  IDs  are  interpreted  as  decimal
                        values. If the number of tasks (or ranks) exceeds the number of elements in  this  list,
                        elements  in  the list will be reused as needed starting from the beginning of the list.
                        To simplify support for large task counts, the lists may follow a map with  an  asterisk
                        and  repetition count. For example "map:0*4,1*4".  If the task/cgroup plugin is used and
                        ConstrainDevices is set in  cgroup.conf,  then  the  gres  IDs  are  zero-based  indexes
                        relative to the gress allocated to the job (e.g. the first gres is 0, even if the global
                        ID  is  3). Otherwise, the gres IDs are global IDs, and all gres on each node in the job
                        should be allocated for predictable binding results.

              <b>mask:&lt;list&gt;</b>
                        Bind  by  setting  gres  masks  on  tasks  (or  ranks)  as  specified  where  &lt;list&gt;  is
                        &lt;gres_mask_for_task_0&gt;,&lt;gres_mask_for_task_1&gt;,...  The  mapping  is specified for a node
                        and identical mapping is applied to the tasks on every node (i.e. the lowest task ID  on
                        each  node  is  mapped  to  the  first mask specified in the list, etc.). gres masks are
                        always interpreted as hexadecimal values but can be preceded with an optional  '0x'.  To
                        simplify  support for large task counts, the lists may follow a map with an asterisk and
                        repetition count.  For example "mask:0x0f*4,0xf0*4".  If the task/cgroup plugin is  used
                        and  ConstrainDevices  is  set  in cgroup.conf, then the gres IDs are zero-based indexes
                        relative to the gres allocated to the job (e.g. the first gres is 0, even if the  global
                        ID  is  3). Otherwise, the gres IDs are global IDs, and all gres on each node in the job
                        should be allocated for predictable binding results.

              <b>none</b>      Do not bind tasks to this gres (turns off  implicit  binding  from  --tres-per-task  and
                        --gpus-per-task).

              <b>per_task:&lt;gres_per_task&gt;</b>
                        Each  task  will  be bound to the number of gres specified in <u>&lt;gres_per_task&gt;</u>. Tasks are
                        preferentially assigned gres with affinity to cores in their allocation like in <u>closest</u>,
                        though they will take any gres if they are unavailable. If no affinity exists, the first
                        task will be assigned the first x number of gres on the  node  etc.   Shared  gres  will
                        prefer to bind one sharing device per task if possible.

              <b>single:&lt;tasks_per_gres&gt;</b>
                        Like <u>closest</u>, except that each task can only be bound to a single gres, even when it can
                        be  bound to multiple gres that are equally close.  The gres to bind to is determined by
                        <u>&lt;tasks_per_gres&gt;</u>, where the first <u>&lt;tasks_per_gres&gt;</u> tasks are bound  to  the  first  gres
                        available,  the  second  <u>&lt;tasks_per_gres&gt;</u>  tasks are bound to the second gres available,
                        etc.  This is basically a block distribution of tasks onto  available  gres,  where  the
                        available gres are determined by the socket affinity of the task and the socket affinity
                        of the gres as specified in gres.conf's <u>Cores</u> parameter.

                        <b>NOTE</b>: Shared gres binding is currently limited to per_task or none

       <b>--tres-per-task</b>=&lt;<u>list</u>&gt;
              Specifies  a  comma-delimited  list of trackable resources required for the job on each task to be
              spawned  in  the  job's  resource  allocation.   The  format  for  each  entry  in  the  list   is
              "trestype[/tresname]=count".   The <u>trestype</u> is the type of trackable resource requested (e.g. cpu,
              gres, license, etc).  The <u>tresname</u> is the name of the trackable resource,  as  can  be  seen  with
              <u>sacctmgr</u>  <u>show</u>  <u>tres</u>.  This  is required when it exists for tres types such as gres, license, etc.
              (e.g. gpu, gpu:a100).  In order to request a license with this  option,  the  license(s)  must  be
              defined  in  the  <b>AccountingStorageTRES</b> parameter of slurm.conf.  The <u>count</u> is the number of those
              resources.
              The count can have a suffix of
              "k" or "K" (multiple of 1024),
              "m" or "M" (multiple of 1024 x 1024),
              "g" or "G" (multiple of 1024 x 1024 x 1024),
              "t" or "T" (multiple of 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024),
              "p" or "P" (multiple of 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024 x 1024).
              Examples:
              --tres-per-task=cpu=4
              --tres-per-task=cpu=8,license/ansys=1
              --tres-per-task=gres/gpu=1
              --tres-per-task=gres/gpu:a100=2
              The specified resources will be allocated to the  job  on  each  node.   The  available  trackable
              resources are configurable by the system administrator.
              <b>NOTE</b>:  This  option  with  gres/gpu or gres/shard will implicitly set --tres-bind=per_task:(gpu or
              shard)&lt;tres_per_task&gt;; this can be overridden with an explicit --tres-bind specification.
              <b>NOTE</b>: Invalid TRES for --tres-per-task include bb,billing,energy,fs,mem,node,pages,vmem.

       <b>--uid</b>=&lt;<u>user</u>&gt;
              Attempt to submit and/or run a job as <u>user</u> instead of the invoking user id.  The  invoking  user's
              credentials  will  be used to check access permissions for the target partition. User root may use
              this option to run jobs as a normal user in a RootOnly partition for  example.  If  run  as  root,
              <b>sbatch</b>  will  drop  its permissions to the uid specified after node allocation is successful. <u>user</u>
              may be the user name or numerical user ID.

       <b>--usage</b>
              Display brief help message and exit.

       <b>--use-min-nodes</b>
              If a range of node counts is given, prefer the smaller count.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
              Increase the verbosity of sbatch's informational messages. Multiple errors will be displayed.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Display version information and exit.

       <b>-W</b>, <b>--wait</b>
              Do not exit until the submitted job terminates.  The exit code of the sbatch command will  be  the
              same  as  the  exit code of the submitted job. If the job terminated due to a signal rather than a
              normal exit, the exit code will be set to 1.  In the case of a job array, the exit  code  recorded
              will be the highest value for any task in the job array.

       <b>--wait-all-nodes</b>=&lt;<u>value</u>&gt;
              Controls  when  the  execution  of the command begins.  By default the job will begin execution as
              soon as the allocation is made.

              0    Begin execution as soon as allocation can be made.  Do not wait for all nodes to be ready for
                   use (i.e. booted).

              1    Do not begin execution until all nodes are ready for use.

       <b>--wckey</b>=&lt;<u>wckey</u>&gt;
              Specify wckey to be used with job. If TrackWCKey=no (default) in  the  slurm.conf  this  value  is
              ignored.

       <b>--wrap</b>=&lt;<u>command_string</u>&gt;
              Sbatch  will  wrap  the  specified  command  string in a simple "sh" shell script, and submit that
              script to the slurm controller. When --wrap is used, a  script  name  and  arguments  may  not  be
              specified on the command line; instead the sbatch-generated wrapper script is used.

</pre><h4><b>FILENAME</b> <b>PATTERN</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sbatch</b> allows for a filename pattern to contain one or more replacement symbols, which are a percent sign
       "%" followed by a letter (e.g. %j).

       <b>\\</b>     Do not process any of the replacement symbols.

       <b>%%</b>     The character "%".

       <b>%A</b>     Job array's master job allocation number.

       <b>%a</b>     Job array ID (index) number.

       <b>%b</b>     Job array ID (index) number modulo 10.

       <b>%J</b>     jobid.stepid of the running job. (e.g. "128.0")

       <b>%j</b>     jobid of the running job.

       <b>%N</b>     short hostname. This will create a separate IO file per node.

       <b>%n</b>     Node  identifier relative to current job (e.g. "0" is the first node of the running job) This will
              create a separate IO file per node.

       <b>%s</b>     stepid of the running job.

       <b>%t</b>     task identifier (rank) relative to current job. This will create a separate IO file per task.

       <b>%u</b>     User name.

       <b>%x</b>     Job name.

       A number placed between the percent character and format specifier may be used to zero-pad the result  in
       the  IO  filename  to  at  minimum  of  specified numbers. This number is ignored if the format specifier
       corresponds to non-numeric data (%N for example). The maximal number is 10, if a value greater than 10 is
       used the result is padding up to 10 characters.  Some examples of how the format string may be used for a
       4 task job step with a JobID of 128 and step id of 0 are included below:

       job%J.out      job128.0.out

       job%4j.out     job0128.out

       job%2j-%2t.out job128-00.out, job128-01.out, ...

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       Executing <b>sbatch</b> sends a remote procedure call to <b>slurmctld</b>. If enough calls from <b>sbatch</b> or  other  Slurm
       client  commands  that send remote procedure calls to the <b>slurmctld</b> daemon come in at once, it can result
       in a degradation of performance of the <b>slurmctld</b> daemon, possibly resulting in a denial of service.

       Do not run <b>sbatch</b> or other Slurm client commands that send remote procedure calls to <b>slurmctld</b> from loops
       in shell scripts or other programs. Ensure that programs limit calls to <b>sbatch</b> to the  minimum  necessary
       for the information you are trying to gather.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  startup,  sbatch  will  read and handle the options set in the following environment variables. The
       majority of these variables are set the same way the options are set, as defined above. For flag  options
       that  are  defined  to  expect no argument, the option can be enabled by setting the environment variable
       without a value (empty or NULL string), the string 'yes', or a non-zero number. Any other value  for  the
       environment  variable  will  result  in the option not being set.  There are a couple exceptions to these
       rules that are noted below.
       <b>NOTE</b>: Environment variables will override any options set in a batch script,  and  command  line  options
       will override any environment variables.

              pmi if Slurm was built with pmi support. Leaving the variable set may cause  problems  when  using
              external  packages  from within the job (Abaqus and Ansys have been known to have problems when it
              is set - consult the appropriate documentation for 3rd party software).

              <b>select/linear</b> plugin allocates entire nodes to jobs, so the value indicates  the  total  count  of
              CPUs  on  allocated  nodes. The <b>select/cons_tres</b> plugin allocates individual CPUs to jobs, so this
              number indicates the number of CPUs allocated to the job.

       <b>SLURM_JOB_DEPENDENCY</b>

              hardware component name.

       <b>SLURM_TOPOLOGY_ADDR_PATTERN</b>
              This  is  set  only  if  the system has the topology/tree plugin configured. The value will be set
              component types listed in  SLURM_TOPOLOGY_ADDR.  Each  component  will  be  identified  as  either
              "switch" or "node". A period is used to separate each hardware component type.

       <b>SLURM_TRES_PER_TASK</b>
              Set  to  the  value  of <b>--tres-per-task</b>. If <b>--cpus-per-task</b> or <b>--gpus-per-task</b> is specified, it is
              also set in <b>SLURM_TRES_PER_TASK</b> as if it were specified in <b>--tres-per-task</b>.

       <b>SLURMD_NODENAME</b>
              Name of the node running the job script.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Specify a batch script by filename on the command line. The batch script specifies a 1 minute time limit
       for the job.

              $ cat myscript
              #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
              #SBATCH --time=1
              srun hostname |sort

              $ sbatch -N4 myscript
              salloc: Granted job allocation 65537

              $ cat slurm-65537.out
              host1
              host2
              host3
              host4

       Pass a batch script to sbatch on standard input:

              $ sbatch -N4 &lt;&lt;EOF
              &gt; #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
              &gt; srun hostname |sort
              &gt; EOF
              sbatch: Submitted batch job 65541

              $ cat slurm-65541.out
              host1
              host2
              host3
              host4

       To create a heterogeneous job with 3 components, each allocating a unique set of nodes:

              $ sbatch -w node[2-3] : -w node4 : -w node[5-7] work.bash
              Submitted batch job 34987
