       sed - stream editor for filtering and transforming text

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       sed [-V] [--version] [--help] [-n] [--quiet] [--silent]
           [-l N] [--line-length=N] [-u] [--unbuffered]
           [-E] [-r] [--regexp-extended]
           [-e script] [--expression=script]
           [-f script-file] [--file=script-file]
           [script-if-no-other-script]
           [file...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Sed</u> is a stream editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream
       (a  file or input from a pipeline).  While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits
       (such as <u>ed</u>), <u>sed</u> works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is  consequently  more  efficient.
       But it is <u>sed</u>'s ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types
       of editors.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--quiet</b>, <b>--silent</b>

              suppress automatic printing of pattern space

       <b>--debug</b>

              annotate program execution

       <b>-e</b> script, <b>--expression</b>=<u>script</u>

              add the script to the commands to be executed

       <b>-f</b> script-file, <b>--file</b>=<u>script-file</u>

              add the contents of script-file to the commands to be executed

       <b>--follow-symlinks</b>

              follow symlinks when processing in place

       <b>-i[SUFFIX]</b>, <b>--in-place</b>[=<u>SUFFIX</u>]

              edit files in place (makes backup if SUFFIX supplied)

       <b>-l</b> N, <b>--line-length</b>=<u>N</u>

              specify the desired line-wrap length for the `l' command

       <b>--posix</b>

              disable all GNU extensions.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>-r</b>, <b>--regexp-extended</b>

              use extended regular expressions in the script (for portability use POSIX <b>-E</b>).

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--separate</b>

              consider files as separate rather than as a single, continuous long stream.

       <b>--sandbox</b>

              operate in sandbox mode (disable e/r/w commands).

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--unbuffered</b>

              load minimal amounts of data from the input files and flush the output buffers more often

       <b>-z</b>, <b>--null-data</b>

              separate lines by NUL characters

       <b>--help</b>
              display this help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       If no <b>-e</b>, <b>--expression</b>, <b>-f</b>, or <b>--file</b> option is given, then the first non-option argument is taken as the
       sed  script  to  interpret.   All  remaining  arguments  are  names of input files; if no input files are
       specified, then the standard input is read.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This is just a brief synopsis of <u>sed</u> commands to serve as a reminder to those who already know <u>sed</u>; other
       documentation (such as the texinfo document) must be consulted for fuller descriptions.

   <b>Zero-address</b> <b>``commands''</b>
       : <u>label</u>
              Label for <b>b</b> and <b>t</b> commands.

       #<u>comment</u>
              The comment extends until the next newline (or the end of a <b>-e</b> script fragment).

       }      The closing bracket of a { } block.

   <b>Zero-</b> <b>or</b> <b>One-</b> <b>address</b> <b>commands</b>
       =      Print the current line number.

       a \

       <u>text</u>   Append <u>text</u>, which has each embedded newline preceded by a backslash.

       i \

       <u>text</u>   Insert <u>text</u>, which has each embedded newline preceded by a backslash.

       q [<u>exit-code</u>]
              Immediately  quit  the  <u>sed</u> script without processing any more input, except that if auto-print is
              not disabled the current pattern space  will  be  printed.   The  exit  code  argument  is  a  GNU
              extension.

       Q [<u>exit-code</u>]
              Immediately quit the <u>sed</u> script without processing any more input.  This is a GNU extension.

       r <u>filename</u>
              Append text read from <u>filename</u>.

       R <u>filename</u>
              Append  a  line  read  from  <u>filename</u>.  Each invocation of the command reads a line from the file.
              This is a GNU extension.

   <b>Commands</b> <b>which</b> <b>accept</b> <b>address</b> <b>ranges</b>
       {      Begin a block of commands (end with a }).

       b <u>label</u>
              Branch to <u>label</u>; if <u>label</u> is omitted, branch to end of script.

       c \

       <u>text</u>   Replace the selected lines with <u>text</u>, which has each embedded newline preceded by a backslash.

       d      Delete pattern space.  Start next cycle.

       D      If pattern space contains no newline, start a normal new cycle as if the  d  command  was  issued.
              Otherwise,  delete  text  in the pattern space up to the first newline, and restart cycle with the
              resultant pattern space, without reading a new line of input.

       h H    Copy/append pattern space to hold space.

       g G    Copy/append hold space to pattern space.

       l      List out the current line in a ``visually unambiguous'' form.

       l <u>width</u>
              List out the current line in a ``visually unambiguous'' form, breaking  it  at  <u>width</u>  characters.
              This is a GNU extension.

       n N    Read/append the next line of input into the pattern space.

       p      Print the current pattern space.

       P      Print up to the first embedded newline of the current pattern space.

       s/<u>regexp</u>/<u>replacement</u>/
              Attempt  to  match  <u>regexp</u> against the pattern space.  If successful, replace that portion matched
              with <u>replacement</u>.  The <u>replacement</u> may contain the special character <b>&amp;</b> to refer to that portion of
              the pattern space which  matched,  and  the  special  escapes  \1  through  \9  to  refer  to  the
              corresponding matching sub-expressions in the <u>regexp</u>.

       t <u>label</u>
              If a s/// has done a successful substitution since the last input line was read and since the last
              t or T command, then branch to <u>label</u>; if <u>label</u> is omitted, branch to end of script.

       T <u>label</u>
              If  no  s///  has  done a successful substitution since the last input line was read and since the
              last t or T command, then branch to <u>label</u>; if <u>label</u> is omitted, branch to end of script.  This  is
              a GNU extension.

       w <u>filename</u>
              Write the current pattern space to <u>filename</u>.

       W <u>filename</u>
              Write the first line of the current pattern space to <u>filename</u>.  This is a GNU extension.

       x      Exchange the contents of the hold and pattern spaces.

       y/<u>source</u>/<u>dest</u>/
              Transliterate  the  characters  in  the  pattern space which appear in <u>source</u> to the corresponding
              character in <u>dest</u>.

</pre><h4><b>Addresses</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Sed</u> commands can be given with no addresses, in which case the command will be  executed  for  all  input
       lines; with one address, in which case the command will only be executed for input lines which match that
       address;  or  with  two  addresses,  in which case the command will be executed for all input lines which
       match the inclusive range of lines starting from the first address and continuing to the second  address.
       Three  things  to note about address ranges: the syntax is <u>addr1</u>,<u>addr2</u> (i.e., the addresses are separated
       by a comma); the line which <u>addr1</u> matched will always be accepted, even if <u>addr2</u> selects an earlier line;
       and if <u>addr2</u> is a <u>regexp</u>, it will not be tested against the line that <u>addr1</u> matched.

       After the address (or address-range), and before the command, a <b>!</b>  may be inserted, which specifies  that
       the command shall only be executed if the address (or address-range) does <b>not</b> match.

       The following address types are supported:

       <u>number</u> Match  only  the  specified line <u>number</u> (which increments cumulatively across files, unless the <b>-s</b>
              option is specified on the command line).

       <u>first</u>~<u>step</u>
              Match every <u>step</u>'th line starting with line <u>first</u>.  For example, ``sed -n 1~2p''  will  print  all
              the  odd-numbered  lines  in  the  input  stream, and the address 2~5 will match every fifth line,
              starting with the second.  <u>first</u> can be zero; in this case, <u>sed</u> operates as if it  were  equal  to
              <u>step</u>.  (This is an extension.)

       $      Match the last line.

       /<u>regexp</u>/
              Match  lines matching the regular expression <u>regexp</u>.  Matching is performed on the current pattern
              space, which can be modified with commands such as ``s///''.

       \<b>c</b><u>regexp</u><b>c</b>
              Match lines matching the regular expression <u>regexp</u>.  The <b>c</b> may be any character.

       GNU <u>sed</u> also supports some special 2-address forms:

       0,<u>addr2</u>
              Start out in "matched first address" state, until <u>addr2</u> is found.  This  is  similar  to  1,<u>addr2</u>,
              except  that  if <u>addr2</u> matches the very first line of input the 0,<u>addr2</u> form will be at the end of
              its range, whereas the 1,<u>addr2</u> form will still be at the beginning of its range.  This works  only
              when <u>addr2</u> is a regular expression.

       <u>addr1</u>,+<u>N</u>
              Will match <u>addr1</u> and the <u>N</u> lines following <u>addr1</u>.

       <u>addr1</u>,~<u>N</u>
              Will  match  <u>addr1</u>  and the lines following <u>addr1</u> until the next line whose input line number is a
              multiple of <u>N</u>.

</pre><h4><b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX.2 BREs <u>should</u> be supported, but they aren't completely because of  performance  problems.   The  <b>\n</b>
       sequence  in  a  regular  expression  matches  the newline character, and similarly for <b>\a</b>, <b>\t</b>, and other
       sequences.  The <u>-E</u> option switches to using extended regular expressions instead; it has  been  supported
       for years by GNU sed, and is now included in POSIX.
