       scriptingserviceexample — Example client script for the Scripting Service

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scriptingserviceexample</b> [ID]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scriptingserviceexample</b>  is a small shell script providing an example of how to use the scripting service
       PU and PE: it first creates a temporary directory with a name created from the given unique ID.  In  this
       directory,  an input directory is created containing two files: an example input file "my-input.data" and
       a run script "ssrun" (the run script is written by echo  commands  within  scriptingserviceexample).  The
       input  directory  is  archived by Tar/GZip and provided to scriptingclient as input file. scriptingclient
       distributes the input to a Scripting PE, which unpacks the archive and executes  "ssrun".   "ssrun"  gets
       the  name  of  an output archive as its first argument; this archive is created by the example script and
       contains an example output file "my-output.data". The output archive  is  transferred  back  to  the  PU.
       Finally, scriptingserviceexample dumps the content of "my-output.data".
       <b>scriptingserviceexample</b>  can  be  taken  as  an  example  to  do something more useful with the scripting
       service: for example, simulation input could be packaged with a script actually  executing  a  simulation
       program  on  the input and archiving the results. Then, the scripting service can be used to distribute a
       set of simulation runs to a pool of processing nodes.
       Important note on security: the scripting service does not include any security features  yet.  That  is,
       arbitrary scripts will be executed. Without modifications (for example signatures), do NOT use it outside
       of a controlled environment!

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are available:

       ID      Gives an unique identifier for the example run, for example: 1234.
