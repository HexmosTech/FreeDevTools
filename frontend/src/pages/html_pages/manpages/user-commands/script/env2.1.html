</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       env2 - Converts environment variables to various script languages.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>env2</b> -from <u>SHELL</u> -to <u>SHELL</u> [-o <u>DESTINATION_FILE</u>] <u>SOURCE_FILE</u>

       <b>env2</b> --save [FILE]

       <b>env2</b> # displays help

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Do you prefer running bash while the rest of the team runs tcsh? Or perhaps you learned csh and the
       system administrators only know ksh. What happens when they (or you) supply an initialization script to
       source? If any of these situations sounds familiar, then this may be the script for you.

       <b>env2</b> takes shell scripts of one flavor in and spits out scripts effectively equivalent in another
       dialect. We say "effectively equivalent" because it does not translate syntax such as <b>if</b>/<b>else</b> statements.
       Instead, the original (source) script is evaluated to determine what environment variables it modifies,
       and the effective values of those variables are simply expressed in the syntax of the destination
       script's dialect. Typically, this is all you really need for scripts that modify the environment.

       NOTE: If you need to the conditionals and for-loops to be used for different situations (e.g. different
       host architectures), then simply use this script repeatedly as needed.

       Future extensions may include <b>aliases</b> or &lt;functions&gt;. Supported languages currently include: <b>bash</b>, <b>csh</b>,
       <b>ksh</b>, <b>modulecmd</b>, <b>perl</b>, <b>plist</b>, <b>sh</b>, <b>tclsh</b>, <b>tcsh</b>, <b>vim</b>, <b>yaml</b>, and <b>zsh</b>.

       NOTE: The file version is identified by an internally computed SHA1 hash similar to the way <b>git</b> does
       versioning. If you get a warning message about inconsistent hash, it means that somebody modified the
       file without updating the $SHA variable.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-all</b>
           Include all variables rather than just those that changed. See <b>-diff</b>.

       <b>-clear</b>
           Resets  the  ignore  list  to  almost completely empty except for the generally dangerous environment
           list.

           See <b>-ignore</b>, <b>-reset</b>, and <b>-unsafe_clear</b>.

       <b>-diff</b>
           Only include those variables whose values are different as a result of sourcing the  specified  input
           script. This is the default action.

       <b>-from</b> DIALECT
           The dialect to translate from. If not present, then the input file is examined for a #! line. If that
           fails,  the  <b>SHELL</b> environment variable is examined. If that fails, we default to <b>bash</b> (Hey, I had to
           choose something, and <b>bash</b> is the default Linux shell of choice).

       <b>-help</b>
           This built-in documentation. Written in POD so that you can also have it in  HTML,  PDF,  RTF,  plain
           text or as a man page.

       <b>-ignore</b> VARLIST
           Comma separated list of variables to ignore. By default, <b>env2</b> starts with the list set to

            _,ENV,ENV2,OLDPWD,SHLVL

           See also <b>-clear</b>, <b>-reset</b> and <b>-unsafe_clear</b>.

       <b>-ignored</b>
           Lists  variables  that will be ignored. Useful if you are uncertain and want to clarify things before
           proceeding.

       <b>-o</b> [<u>FILE</u>]
           Specifies a <u>FILE</u> to save the results in. By default results are sent to STDOUT.  If you leave off the
           <u>FILE</u>, the filename will be "env2."<b>$SHELL</b>.

       <b>-profile</b> [<u>FILE</u>]
           Specifies a file that contains the starting environment. Defaults to  ".env2profile".   Searches  for
           the file in the current directory or $HOME if path not specified.

       <b>-reset</b>
           Resets the ignore list to a minimum set.

           See also <b>-clear</b>, <b>-ignore</b> and <b>-unsafe_clear</b>.

       <b>-save</b> [FILE]
           Saves  the  environment  in  a  perl format. By default saves to env2.pl.  Internally, this option is
           invoked as part of the conversion process and saves an intermediate file to /tmp/env2.$$.pl.

       <b>-sha1</b>
           Displays the SHA1 version identifier. Use this to see if script has been modified since last updated.

       <b>-to</b> DIALECT
           The dialect to translate to. If not supplied, the <b>SHELL</b> environment variable  is  examined.  If  that
           fails,  we  default  to  <b>bash</b> (Hey, I had to choose something, and <b>bash</b> is the default Linux shell of
           choice).

       <b>-uniq</b> <u>[PATHLIST]</u>
           Ensure that each path variable specified in <u>PATHLIST</u> contains a unique colon separated list.  Default
           is to apply this to common path variables:

            MANPATH
            PATH
            LD_LIBRARY_PATH
            DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
            PERL5LIB

       <b>-unsafe_clear</b>
           Resets the ignore list to completely empty. This is potentially dangerous because allows inclusion of
           dangerous environment variables that the user should not touch. These dangerous variables can have an
           adverse affect on operation of UNIX.

           See also <b>-clear</b>, <b>-ignore</b> and <b>-reset</b>.

       <b>--version</b>
           Display version of script.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       ENV2 environment variable contains default command-line arguments if defined.

</pre><h4><b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
       To support YAML, this script uses the CPAN YAML module.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        # Simple conversion
        env2 -from ksh -to csh -o setup.csh setup.ksh

        # Create a modules cmd for a new xyz tool version 1.0
        TOOL_SETUP=$TOOLS/vendor_dir/xyz_tool/xyz-1.0/setup.script
        MDLDIR=$TOOLS/modules/tools/xyz
        env2 -from sh -to modulecmd -o $MDLDIR/1.0 $TOOL_SETUP

        # Dynamically use a script for another shell to set environment
        eval `env2 -from ksh -to $SHELL -o setup.csh setup.ksh`
