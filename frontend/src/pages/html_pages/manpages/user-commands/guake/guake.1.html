</pre><h4><b>USER</b> <b>MANUAL</b></h4><pre>
   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>Guake?</b>
       Guake is a powerful drop-down terminal, accessible by a simple hotkey. It has been  designed  to  be  the
       swiss knife of any developer willing to increase its productivity.

   <b>Alternatives</b> <b>to</b> <b>Guake</b>
       Here  are  some  of the best terminals available on the Linux environments that bring similar features of
       Guake:

       • <u>Tilda</u>

       • <u>Tilix</u>

       • <u>Yakuake</u> (For the KDE)

       • <u>GNOME</u> <u>Terminal</u>

       • <u>Terminator</u>

   <b>Guake</b> <b>3</b> <b>Features</b>
       TBD: Long description of each feature

   <b>Single</b> <b>Hotkey</b> <b>terminal</b>
       TBD:

       • Appears when you call and disappears once you are done by pressing a predefined hotkey (F12 by default)

       • Customizable hotkeys for tab access, reorganization, background transparency, font size,...

   <b>Auto-start</b>
       Guake can now (&gt;=3.1) starts automatically on GNOME startup.

   <b>Advanced</b> <b>Tab</b> <b>Support</b>
       Guake has several modes available to manage tab. You can let guake automatically rename the tab  or  give
       you own name.

   <b>Color</b> <b>Palettes</b>
       Thanks to the Guake community, a huge number of Terminal palettes are provided out of the box.

   <b>GTK</b> <b>Theme</b>
       Guake allows you to choose a different GTK theme than your environment.

       <b>NOTE:</b>
          You need to restart Guake after changing the GTK theme.

   <b>Quick</b> <b>Open,</b> <b>hyperlink</b> <b>and</b> <b>Search</b> <b>on</b> <b>web</b>
       Guake  automatically  finds URL printed in your terminal and allow you to click on it using <b>[Ctrl]+click</b>.
       Many other terminals, if not all, does that already.

   <b>Quick-Open</b>
       [image]

       Guake is also able to find out file names and open it in your favorite code editor, such as Visual Studio
       Code, Atom or SublimText.

       Guake brings this to much more, by automatically parsing output of popular system commands such  as  <b>gcc</b>,
       Python's  traceback or <b>pytest</b> report, and allowing you to automatically open the file at the correct line
       number. Guake is even able to find the Python function name automatically when used with <b>pytest</b>.  [image]

       Even if Guake cannot parse the output, you can still ask him to open a wanted file path displayed in your
       terminal, provided the file exists at this path.  Simply  select  the  full  path  and  click  using  the
       <b>[Ctrl]+click</b>, or with the contextual menu on right click.  [image]

   <b>Contextual</b> <b>menu</b>
       Right  click  also  displays  "Search  on web" (if you have selected a text) and "Open link" (if the text
       under the cursor is a URL or if the selected text is a URL).

       Guake also supports <u>HTML-like</u> <u>anchor</u> with special characters such as:

          echo -e '\e]8;;<a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a>\aThis is a link\e]8;;\a'

   <b>HTML-like</b> <b>anchors</b>
       You may need a recent version of the VTE (Virtual Terminal Emulator) component  in  you  system  (vte  &gt;=
       0.50).

   <b>Multi</b> <b>Monitor</b>
       TBD: Multi-monitor support (open on a specified monitor, open on mouse monitor)

   <b>Hook</b> <b>points</b>
       TBD: Configure Guake startup by running a bash script when Guake starts

   <b>Save</b> <b>Terminal</b> <b>Content</b>
       TBD: Save terminal content to file

   <b>Custom</b> <b>Commands</b>
       TBD

   <b>DBus</b> <b>commands</b>
       The major features of guake are available on DBus.

   <b>Tab</b> <b>UUID</b>
       Tabs  are  uniquely identified with a UUID. Each terminal receives this UUID in the following environment
       varialbe: <b>GUAKE_TAB_UUID</b>. It can be used to rename the  tab  from  the  command  line  using  <b>--tab-index</b>
       <b>3c542bc1-7c99-4e73-8d37-e08281bd592c</b>.

   <b>Per-directory</b> <u><b>.guake.yml</b></u> <b>file</b>
       If  there is a file named <u>.guake.yml</u> in the current working directory of the shell associated with a tab,
       Guake will try to read the title from there. The current format is  very  simple  and  it  will  probably
       change in the future:

          title: "My Great Project"

   <b>Installing</b> <b>Guake</b>
   <b>System-wide</b> <b>installation</b>
       On  wayland  systems, you will need to set the hotkey for opening Guake from your window manager's global
       settings.

       For GNOME:

       1. Open Gnome Settings

       2. Go to Devices -&gt; Keyboard

       3. Scroll in the list of the keyboard shorcuts all way down to Custom Shortcuts

       4. Press + to add a custom shortcut

       5. In the Add Custom Shortcut dialog type guake-toggle for command

       6. Enter the name and specify a shortcut, then press Add

       Always prefer using your package manager to install guake.

   <b>Debian</b> <b>/</b> <b>Ubuntu</b>
       Ubuntu and Debian users will use <b>sudo</b> <b>apt</b> <b>install</b> <b>guake</b>.

       Guake also has a PPA. You can add the Guake PPA to your system by entering:

          $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxuprising/guake
          $ sudo apt-get update

       After which you will be able to install and update to the latest version of Guake on the PPA.

   <b>Fedora</b>
       Tested in Fedora 34: We can use dnf to install it.

          $ sudo dnf install guake

       Then you can open it via:

          $ guake

       To allow global 'F12' to open the guake, go to Setting &gt;&gt; Device &gt;&gt; Keyboard &gt;&gt; Scroll to bottom  &gt;&gt;  "+"
       to create a new global short cut with 'F12' keybinding and command 'guake'.

       You may notice the style may have some error. You can fix this by installing and apply custom theme.

          $ sudo dnf install arc-theme gnome-tweaks

       Then use

          $ gnome-tweaks

       to change theme to change theme to one of the yakuake will fix this.

   <b>Arch</b> <b>Linux</b>
       Guake is available on <u>community</u> repository, just use: <b>sudo</b> <b>pacman</b> <b>-S</b> <b>guake</b> to install it.

   <b>Manjaro</b>
       Manjaro users can use <b>pacman</b> <b>-S</b> <b>guake</b>.

   <b>Install</b> <b>from</b> <b>Pypi</b>
       Guake is now automatically published on Pypi.

       Please  note  the  recommended  way  is  to  install Guake using <b>pipx</b> that will put Guake in a dedicated,
       isolated environment for your local user. Ensure <b>$HOME/.local/bin</b> is in your <b>PATH</b>.

          $ python3 -m pip install --user pipx
          $ pipx install guake

       Alternatively, you can use the following command to install on a local environment:

          $ pip install --user guake

       Avoid using <b>pip</b> <b>install</b> <b>guake</b> without the <b>--user</b>, you may break your system.

       You need to ensure the following points are met in your configuration:

       • <b>$HOME/.local/bin</b> should be in your <b>$PATH</b>

       •

         <b>You</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> <b>dependencies</b> <b>installed</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>system:</b>

                • <b>gir1.2-keybinder-3.0</b>

                • <b>gir1.2-notify-0.7</b>

                • <b>gir1.2-vte-2.91</b>

                • <b>libkeybinder-3.0-0</b>

                • <b>libutempter0</b>

                • <b>python3-setuptools</b>

                • <b>python3-cairo</b>

                • <b>python3-dbus</b>

                • <b>python3-gi</b>

                • <b>python3-pip</b>

                • <b>python3</b>

   <b>Install</b> <b>from</b> <b>source</b>
       If you want to install Guake from its sources, please follow this procedure:

       •

         First, <b>DO</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>USE</b> <b>TARBALLS</b> <b>GENERATED</b> <b>BY</b> <b>GITHUB</b> on the Release Page. They
                are automatically generated and cannot be used  alone.  We  use  a  package,  namely  <b>PBR</b>,  that
                requires the full git history to work.

                Checkout the HEAD of the source tree with:

                   $ git clone https://github.com/Guake/guake.git

       •

         <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> <b>system</b> <b>dependencies</b> <b>(Python</b> <b>GTK,</b> <b>VTE,</b> <b>...)</b>
                installed for your system.  If you are unsure about the dependencies, you can run this script to
                install them:

                   $ ./scripts/bootstrap-dev-[debian, arch, fedora].sh run make

       Note: Insert your distribution in the square brackets.

       To install Guake itself, use:

          $ make
          $ sudo make install

       To uninstall, still in the source directory:

          $ make
          $ sudo make uninstall

       Tips for a complete Guake reinstallation (without system dependencies):

          $ sudo make uninstall &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install
          $ # Or use this shortcut:
          $ make reinstall  # (do not sudo it!)

   <b>Command</b> <b>Line</b> <b>Arguments</b>
       Here is the command line interface Guake provides:

          Please run guake --help to see command line interface help

   <b>D-Bus</b> <b>Interface</b>
       TBD: Describe the DBus interface, with message, how to use it. Recall how to send guake toggle command.

   <b>Frequently</b> <b>Asked</b> <b>Questions</b>
   <b>Manual</b> <b>keybinding</b>
       If  you want to trigger guake manually, for instance on system where <b>libkeybinder3</b> does not work, you can
       register the following snippet in your window manager

          dbus-send --type=method_call --dest=org.guake3.RemoteControl \
              /org/guake3/RemoteControl org.guake3.RemoteControl.show_hide

       You can use the simpler:

          guake-toggle

       Please note the command <u>guake</u> <u>-t</u> will also toggle Guake but since it initialize  a  bit  more  than  just
       necessary, it can be slower that the two previous commands.

   <b>Note</b> <b>on</b> <b>Wayland</b>
       There  are  some  reports of Guake not opening when a Wayland app or empty desktop is focused.  The issue
       has been reported on Ubuntu 17.10 LTS, Fedora 26 and Fedora 27.  For more context, see issue #1041.

       The workaround is setting a manual keybinding as described above.  On Fedora 26, for example, this can be
       accomplished by going to <u>Settings</u> <u>&gt;</u> <u>Keyboard</u> and adding a new custom shortcut to execute <b>guake-toggle</b>.

   <b>Note</b> <b>for</b> <b>Archlinux</b> <b>users</b>
       This applies to users of Archlinux based distributions too and may be of help to non Debian/Ubuntu  users
       as  well.  Currently  <b>make</b> <b>install</b> is optimized for Ubuntu, which does not mean that it cannot be used on
       other systems, but depending on your system you may have to tell <b>make</b> <b>install</b> where to install guake (the
       default for Ubuntu is <b>/usr/local/lib/python3.x/dist-packages/guake</b>).

       So on Ubuntu the following commands are equivalent:

          $ sudo make install
          $ sudo make install PREFIX=<a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a>

       On Archlinux this can be done by passing <b><a href="file:/usr">/usr</a></b> as <b>PREFIX</b>:

          $ sudo make install PREFIX=<a href="file:/usr">/usr</a>

       which changes the installation destination to <b>/usr/lib/python3.x/site-packages/guake</b>.

       Note that the install script automatically determines whether to use <b>dist-packages</b> or <b>site-packages</b>.

       For more details checkout the official PKGBUILD at <u>archlinux.org</u>, the PKGBUILD on the <u>aur</u> or this <u>gist</u>.

   <b>Why</b> <b>Guake</b> <b>crashes</b> <b>with</b> <b>Tmux</b> <b>and</b> <b>Byubu?</b>
       Tmux and Byobu can be used as shell instead of bash or zsh, but you should be sure to  disable  the  "use
       login  shell"  option.  If set, Guake will not be able to start. Use <b>dconf-editor</b> to reset this option if
       Guake cannot start again.

   <b>GTK</b> <b>3</b> <b>Port</b>
       Early 2018, Guake has been ported GTK3, thanks to the huge work of  @aichingm.   Old  releases  and  code
       depending  on  GTK2  have been put on the <u>0.8.x</u> branch of the GitHub project and will no more be actively
       maintained.

       Please note that we target to support mainly the GTK and VTE versions found by default  on  most  popular
       distribution such as Ubuntu or Arch Linux (currently: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and 17.10).

       Guake is now only compatible with Python 3.5+.

       Port  to GTK 3 and Python 3 lead naturally to skip all 1.x and 2.x version in the version of Guake: Guake
       3.

   <b>Dropped</b> <b>Features</b> <b>from</b> <b>Guake</b> <b>0.8.x</b>
       • <b>--bgimg</b> (this option has been removed from vte)

   <b>Broken</b> <b>translations</b>
       Some changes in translation system made during the Guake 3 port may have broken the  welcome  message  in
       some languages (#1209).

       Help is welcomed for updating translations in your language ! See the "Update translation" section below.

   <b>Note</b> <b>for</b> <b>maintainers</b>
       Guake  has  drastically  changed its build system with Guake 3. You may need to adapt all the integration
       scripts accordingly.

       Guake now uses <b>Pipfile</b> to store it Python dependencies (except the system dependencies such  as  PyGTK3).
       It  is  maintained and used by <u>pipenv</u> CLI tool. It is a system more advanced than using <b>requirements.txt</b>,
       but this file is still generated for  backward  compatibility  (for  example:  ReadTheDocs  only  support
       <b>requirements.txt</b> for the moment), by a tool I've developed, named <b>pipenv_to_requirements</b> (makefile target
       <b>make</b>  <b>requirements</b>).   It does generate <b>requirements.txt</b> (running dependencies), and <b>requirements-dev.txt</b>
       (build, checks and test only). From then, Guake is now a classic, canon Python  package  (with  setup.py,
       building distribution packages, ...).

       It  however requires system libraries, so cannot work isolated inside a virtualenv. If you look closer to
       the virtualenv used with <b>make</b> <b>dev</b> <b>;</b> <b>make</b> <b>run</b>, you will see it is configured to use the  system  libraries
       using <b>pew</b> <b>toggleglobalsitepackages</b>.

       If  for  any  reason  <b>pipenv</b>  does  not  work  on  your  platform, you can still install guake from these
       requirements file, but the ultimate source of truth for dependency declaration is the <b>Pipfile</b>.

         make the shortcut works under most situation.

         (#1275)

   <b>Known</b> <b>Issues</b>
       • Multiline url are sometimes not handled correctly.

       • Users of Byobu or Tmux as default shell should disable the "login shell" option (in the "Shell" panel).
         This uses an option, <b>--login</b>, that does not exist on these two tools.

   <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b>
       • Fix duplication in theme list (#1304)

       • Fix right click selection in Midnight Commander

       • Corrected  usage of <b>Vte.Regex.new_for_match</b> to fix regular expression matching (hyperlinks, quick open)
         on VTE &gt;0.50 (#1295)

       • URL with <b>'</b> (simple quote) and <b>()</b> (parenthesis) are now captured by hyperlink matcher.  This may  causes
         some  issues  with  log and so that use parenthesis <u>around</u> hyperlinks, but since parenthesis and quotes
         are valid characters inside a URL, like for instance URL created by Kibana, they deserve the  right  to
         be shown as proper url in Guake.

         User  can  still  select  the URL in the terminal if he wishes to capture the exact url, before doing a
         Ctrl+click or a right click.

         For developers, it is advised to end the URL with a character that cannot  be  used  in  URL,  such  as
         space,  tab,  new  line.  Ending  with  a dot (<b>.</b>) or a comma (<b>,</b>) will not be seen as part of the URL by
         Guake, so most logs and traces that adds a dot or a comma at the end of the URL might still work.

   <b>3.1.0</b>
   <b>Release</b> <b>Summary</b>
       This  version  of  Guake brings mostly bug fixes, and some new features like "Quick Open on selection". I
       have also reworked internally the Quick Open so that it can  automatically  open  files  from  logs  from
       pytest  and other python development tools output.  However, there might still some false positive on the
       hovering of the mouse in the terminal, the most famous being the output of <b>ls</b> <b>-l</b> which may have the mouse
       looks like it sees hyperlinks on the  terminal  everywhere.  Click  does  nothing  but  its  an  annoying

       • Allow application to capture right click (ex: Midnight commander). #1096.  It is still possible to show
         the contextual menu with Shift+right click.

   <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b>
       • delete tab even without libutempter (#1198)

       • Fix crash when changing command file #1229

       • fix <b>import</b> <b>sys</b> in <b>simplegladeapp.py</b>

       • change scope of <b>which_align</b> variable in <b>pref.py</b> (#1225)

       • Fix several issues on Quick Edit:

         • quick open freezes guake

         • support  for  systems with PCRE2 (regular expression in terminal) disabled for VTE, like Ubuntu 17.10
           and +.

           This might disable quick open and open url on direct Ctrl+click.  User can still  select  the  wanted
           url or text and Cltr+click or use contextual menu.

           See this <u>discussion</u> <u>on</u> <u>Tilix</u>, another Terminal emulator that suffurs the same issue.

         • quick open now appears in contextual menu (#1157)

         • bad  translation update on the contextual menu. This causes new strings that was hidden to appear for
           translators.

         • Fix quick open on pattern "<u>File:line</u>" line that was not opening the wanted file.

       • Fix user interface translations #1228

       • Some systems such as Ubuntu did displayed Guake with a translated interface (#1209). The locale  system
         has been reworked to fix that.

       • There  might  be  broken translations, or not up-to-date language support by Guake. A global refresh of
         all existing translations would be welcomed. Most has not been updated since the transition to Guake 3,
         so these languages support might probably be unfunctional or at least partialy localized.

       • A big thank you for all the volunteers and Guake enthousiats would often update their  own  translation
         to help guake being used world-wide.  - Help is always welcomed for updating translations !

   <b>Notes</b> <b>for</b> <b>Package</b> <b>Maintainers</b>
       • The  setup  mechanism has changed a little bit. Some maintainers used to patch the source code of Guake
         to change the pixmap, Gtk schema or locale paths directly in the <b>guake/globals.py</b> file. This was due to
         a lack of flexibility of the installation target of the <b>Makefile</b>.

         The <b>make</b> <b>install</b> target looks now a little bit more familiar, allowing distribution packager to set the
         various paths directly with make flags.

         For example:

            sudo make install \
                prefix=<a href="file:/usr">/usr</a> \
                DESTDIR=/path/for/packager \
                PYTHON_SITE_PACKAGE_NAME=site-package \
                localedir=<a href="file:/usr/share/locale">/usr/share/locale</a>

         The main overrides are:

         • <b>IMAGE_DIR</b>: where the pixmap should be installed. Default: <b>/usr/local/share/guake/pixmaps</b>

         • <b>localedir</b>: where locales should be installed. Default: <b>/usr/local/share/locale</b>

         • <b>GLADE_DIR</b>: where the Glade files should be installed. Default: <b>/usr/local/share/guake</b>

         • <b>gsettingsschemadir</b>:    where    gsettings/dconf    schema    should    be    installed.      Default:
           <b>/usr/local/share/glib-2.0/schemas/</b>

         I  invite  package  maintainers to open tickets on Github about any other difficulties encountered when
         packaging Guake.

   <b>3.0.6</b>
   <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b>
       • Hotfix of #1198 (Ctrl+D in the terminal does not close) and #1014 (guake hangs on exit)

   <b>3.0.5</b>
   <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b>
       • Apply cursor blinking to new tabs as well, not only on settings change.

       • Fix window losefocus hotkey #1080

       • Fix refocus if open #1188

       • fix preferences window header color, align the close button more nicely and change borders to margins

       • Implements a timestamp for wayland (#1215)

   <b>3.0.4</b>
   <b>New</b> <b>Features</b>
       • Add window displacement options to move guake away from the screen edges

       • User can manually enter the name of the GTK theme it wants Guake to use. Note there  is  no  Preference
         settings   yet,   one   needs   to   manually   enter   the   name   using  <b>dconf-editor</b>,  in  the  key
         <b>/apps/guake/general/gtk-theme-name</b>. Use a name matching one the folders  in  <b>/usr/share/themes</b>.  Please
         also considere this is a early adopter features and has only been tested on Ubuntu systems.  Dark theme
         preference can be se with the key <b>/apps/guake/general/gtk-prefer-dark-theme</b>.

       • Allow make install-system to be run as non root user and print a message if so.

       • Quick open can now open file under selection. Simply select a filename in the current terminal and do a
         Ctrl+click,  if the file path can be found, it will be open in your editor. It allows to virtually open
         any file path in your terminal (if they are on your local machine), but requires the user to select the
         file path first, compared to the Quick Open feature that finds file names using regular expression.

         Also notes that is it able to look in the current folder if the selected  file  name  exists,  allowing
         Ctrl+click on relative paths as well.

         Line  number  syntax is also supported: <b>filename.txt:5</b> will directly on the 5th line if your Quick Open
         is set for.

   <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b>
       • fixes issue with vertically stacked dual monitors #1162

       • Quick Open functionality is restored #1121

       • Unusable Guake with "hide on focus lose" option #1152

       • Speed up guake D-Bus communication (command line such as <b>guake</b> <b>-t</b>).

   <b>3.0.3</b>
   <b>Release</b> <b>Summary</b>
       This minor release mainly focus on fixing big problems that was remaining after the migration to GTK3.  I
       would  like to akwonledge the work of some contributors that helped testing and reporting issues on Guake
       3.0.0. Thanks a lot to @egmontkob and @aichingm.

       The Preference window has been deeply reworked and the hotkey management has been rewritten. This was one
       the the major regression in Guake 3.0.

   <b>New</b> <b>Features</b>
       • [dev env] automatically open reno slug after creation for editing

       • [dev env]: Add the possibility to terminate guake with <b>Ctrl+c</b> on terminal where Guake has been launched

       • Add "Infinite scrolling" option in "Scrolling" panel #274

       • Added hotkey for showing and focusing Guake window when it is opened or closed.  It is convenient  when
         Guake  window are overlapped with another windows and user needs to just showing it without closing and
         opening it again. #1133

   <b>Known</b> <b>Issues</b>
       • Quick Edit feature is not working (#1121)

   <b>Deprecations</b>
       • Remove visible bell feature #1081

   <b>Bug</b> <b>Fixes</b>
       • Command options do not work, crash when disabling keybinding #1111

       • Do not open Guake window upon startup #1113

       • Fix crash on increase/decrease main window height shortcut #1099

       • Resolved conflicting default shortcut for <b>Ctrl+F2</b> (now, rename current  tab  is  set  to  <b>Ctrl+Shift+R</b>)
         #1101, #1098

       • The hotkey management has been rewritten and is now fully functional

       • Rework  the  Preference  window  and  reorganize the settings. Lot of small issues has been fixed.  The
         Preference window now fits in a 1024x768 screen.

       • Fix 'Failed to execute child process "-"' - #1119

       • History size spin is fixed and now increment by 1000 steps. Default history value is now set  to  1000,
         because "1024" has no real meaning for end user. #1082

       • The  dependencies  of  the  Guake executable has been slightly better described in README.  There is an
         example for Debian/Ubuntu in the file <b>bootstrap-dev-debian.sh</b> which is the main environment where Guake
         is developed and tested.

       • Package maintainers are encouraged to  submit  their  <b>bootstrap-dev-[distribution].sh</b>,  applicable  for
         other distributions, to help users install Guake from source, and other package maintainers.

       • Code cleaning and GNOME desktop file conformance

   <b>3.0.0</b>
   <b>Release</b> <b>Summary</b>
       Guake has been ported to GTK-3 thanks to the huge work of @aichingm. This also implies Guake now uses the
       latest version of the terminal emulator component, VTE 2.91.  Guake is  now  only  working  on  Python  3
       (version  3.5  or  3.6).  Official  support  for Python 2 has been dropped.  This enables new features in
       upcoming releases, such as "find in terminal", or "split screen".

   <b>New</b> <b>Features</b>
       • Ported to GTK3:

            • cli arguments

            • D-Bus

            • context menu of the terminal, the tab bar and the tray icon

            • scrollbar of the terminal

            • <b>ctrl+d</b> on terminal

            • fix double click on the tab bar

            • fix double click on tab to rename

            • fix clipboard from context menu

            • notification module

            • keyboard shortcuts

            • preference screen

            • port <b>gconfhandler</b> to <b>gsettingshandler</b>

            • about dialog

            • pattern matching

            • <b>Guake.accel*</b> methods

       • Guake now use a brand new build system:

            • <b>pipenv</b> to manage dependencies in <u>Pipfile</u>

            • enforced code styling and checks using Pylint, Flake8, Yapf, ISort.

            • simpler release management thanks to PBR

       • [dev env] <u>reno</u> will be used to generate release notes for Guake  starting  version  3.0.0.   It  allows
         developers  to  write  the  right  chunk  that will appear in the release note directly from their Pull
         Request.

       •

         <b>Update</b> <b>Guake</b> <b>window</b> <b>title</b> <b>when:</b>

                • the active tab is renamed

                • the vte title changes

   <b>Known</b> <b>Issues</b>
       • Translation might be broken in some language, waiting  for  the  translation  file  to  be  updated  by
         volunteers

       • Resizer does not work anymore

       • Package maintainers have to rework their integration script completely

       • quick open and open link in terminal is broken

       • <b>Note</b>  <b>for</b>  <b>package</b>  <b>maintainers</b>: Guake 3 has a minor limitation regarding Glib/GTK Schemas files. Guake
         looks for the gsettings schema inside its data directory. So you will probably need install the  schema
         twice,      once      in     <b>/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/guake/data/</b>     and     once     in
         <b><a href="file:/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas">/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas</a></b> (see <u>#1064</u>).  This is planned to be fixed in Guake 3.1

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.8.1</b>
          I  started  working on Guake 1.0.0, and not in a dedicated branch. It is now in its own source folder.
          We clearly need to move to gtk3 soon, since GTK2 is being discontinued, the VTE is no more  maintained
          for GTK2-Python, and adds lot of cool features.

          So  I  am now starting to work on a complete rewrite of Guake, so don't expect 0.8.x to see lot of new
          features, unfortunately. But Guake 1.0.0 will add features such as:

              • line wrap in terminal

              • search in terminal

              • dconf/gsettings to store configuration

              • GTK3 look and feel

              • much cleaner build and translation systems

          But, this means I cannot work too much on 0.8.x. I still do some bug fixes,  and  thanks  to  external
          contributors that share the love for Guake, Guake 0.8 still moves on!

          So  don't  hesitate  to  have a look in the code to fix any bug you are experiencing and submit a Pull
          Request.

          New features:

          • a-la guake-indicator custom commands (#564) - by @Ozzyboshi!

          • Add option to allow/disallow bold font (#603) - by @helix84!

          • Clean current terminal item in contextual menu (#608) - by @Denis Subbotin

          Bug fixes:

          • Terminal widget disappears at random times (#592)

          • Typo - by @selivan, @Ruined1

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.8.0</b>
          I have been extremely busy the previous 3 months, so I have almost not worked on Guake.  I  wanted  to
          introduce in the next version some major features heavily asked, like session save and split terminal.
          They will have to wait a bit more.

          As  a  result,  most  of  the contribution are from external contributors. Thank you very much for all
          these patches!

          This releases introduces two major changes in the project, thus the minor version change.

          First, the new homepage is now online:
              <u><a href="http://guake-project.org/">http://guake-project.org/</a></u>

          As I remind you, Guake has <u>not</u> control over the old domain guake.org. So far the content is still  one

          The  second  major  change  in the project is the abandon of our internal hotkey manager <b>globalhotkey</b>,
          which was responsible for binding hotkeys globally to the window  manager.  This  piece  of  code  was
          extremely  old  and  hard  to maintain. This was also unnecessarily complexifying the build process of
          Guake. Thanks to the contribution of @jenrik, we are now  using  a  pretty  common  package  <b>keybinder</b>
          (Ubuntu: <b>python-keybinder</b>).

          Bug fixes:

          • Guake  fails  to  start  due  to a GlobalHotkey related C call fixed by replacing GlobalHotkeys with
            keybinder. Fixed by @jenrik. (#558, #510)

          • Fix icon issue with appindicator (#591)

          • swap terms correctly when moving tabs (#473, #512, #588)

          • Remove last reference to --show-hide (#587)

          • fixed and completed german translation (#585)

          • Drop duplicated man page (a526046a)

          • use full path to tray icon with libappindicator (#591)

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.7.2</b> <b>(2015.05.20)</b>
          Bug fixes:

          • Fix Ctrl+D regression (#550)

          • update Quick Open Preference Window

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.7.1</b> <b>(2015.05.18):</b>
          Some bug fixes, and cleared issues with new palette colors.

          As side note, our domain 'guake.org' has been squatted by an outsider that seems  only  interested  in
          getting  money to release the domain. Since Guake is a small project, based on 100% OpenSource spirit,
          we do not want to loose more time on this subject. The guake website will be deployed soon  on  a  new
          URL:
              <u><a href="http://guake-project.org">http://guake-project.org</a></u>

          Please  do  <b>NOT</b> use guake.org anymore, until we can retrieve it. We cannot be hold responsible for any
          content on guake.org anymore.

          Bug fixes:

          • Background and font color inversed for some color schemes (#516)

          • Guake width wrong on non-Unity Ubuntu desktop (#517)

          • Add get_gtktab_name dbus interface (#529, #530)

          • Fix issue with selection copy (#514)

          • I18n fixes and updated Polish translation (#519). Thanks a lot @piotrdrag!

          • prompt_on_close_tab option (#546) Thanks a lot @tobz1000!

          • Fix default shortcuts for move tabs

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.7.0</b> <b>(2015.05.02):</b>
          I had more time working on Guake recently, so I fixed some long term issues, and exposed some internal
          settings into the preference window.

          Thanks for the external contribution: @varemenos, @seraff and others!

          incompatibility  reports  on  new systems, such as Wayland. Port to gtk3 is still a must have, but all
          features of the VTE component does not seem to have been ported.

            in all systems.

          • lot of "componentization" of the code, in preparation to the rebase of 'gtk3' branch.

   <b>Version</b> <b>0.5.1</b> <b>(2014.11.06):</b>

       • GTK: &gt;=3.18

       • VTE: 2.91

       • <b>libkeybinder3</b>

       See full list of dependencies on the <u>Dependencies</u> page.

       The following section describes how to install these dependencies on some systems,  please  be  aware  it
       might not be applicable to yours directly.

   <b>Install</b> <b>System</b> <b>dependencies</b>
   <b>Ubuntu</b>
       Execute the following command to bootstrap all needed system dependencies:

          $ ./scripts/bootstrap-dev-debian.sh

   <b>Fedora</b>
       Execute:

          $ ./scripts/bootstrap-dev-fedora.sh

   <b>Arch</b> <b>Linux</b>
       Execute:

          $ ./scripts/bootstrap-dev-arch.sh

   <b>Setup</b> <b>development</b> <b>environment</b>
       Install the dependencies of your system and use the following commands:

          $ make dev
          $ sudo make install-schemas  # still required even for local execution

       You can force the interpreter version using the PYTHON_INTERPRETER variable:

          $ make dev PYTHON_INTERPRETER=python3.6

       Local execution of guake (without system-wide install):

          $ make run

   <b>Install</b> <b>on</b> <b>system</b>
       Use the following command to build and install on your system (in <b><a href="file:/usr/local/">/usr/local/</a></b>):

          $ make dev &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install

       You can reinstall easily in your environment (only validated for Debian/Ubuntu) with:

          $ make reinstall  # will execute `sudo`

   <b>Git</b> <b>hook</b>
       This  project uses <u>pre-commit</u> <u>&lt;https://pre-commit.com/&gt;</u> to automatically execute some codestyle tools. It
       should be automatically installed by the <b>make</b> <b>dev</b> command, you can use <b>make</b> <b>style</b> if you want to  run  it
       manually. If you want to pass more options, you can use:

          $ pipenv run pre-commit run --all-files

   <b>Hacking</b> <b>Guake</b>
   <b>Contributing</b>
       First,  be  sure to use a version of Python 3 where GTK and GObjects works in your system.  For instance,
       under Ubuntu 17.04, PyGtk and <b>python3-gi</b> does not work well if the default python 3 interpreter is forced
       to Python 3.6.

   <b>Validate</b> <b>your</b> <b>code</b>
       We are strict on code styling, with pep8 and pylint running automatically in GitHub Actions in  order  to
       reject badly shaped patches. Please use the following command to validate all python files:

          $ make style  # fix the style of python files
          $ make check  # static code analysis
          $ make test   # unit test campaign
          $ make dists  # make distribution packages

   <b>Update</b> <b>translation</b>
       Update all translation files:

          $ make update-po

       Install the translations files:

          $ sudo make install-locale

       Then use your favorite po editor, such as <b>poedit</b>.

       Start Guake with a different locale (locales should be installed):

          $ LC_ALL=fr_FR.UTF8 make run

   <b>Update</b> <b>NEWS</b>
       Update the <u>NEWS</u> file using the followng command:

          make release-note-news

       The  <b>ChangeLog</b>  files  is  not  maintained  but  instead automatically generated by PBR when building the
       distribution packages.

       Same goes for the <u>ChangeLog</u> file.

   <b>Versioning</b>
       Versioning is automatically done using git  tags.  When  a  semver  tag  is  pushed,  a  new  version  is
       automatically created by PBR.

       PBR  also  has  some  magic  to  generate  the version automatically from <b>sem-ver</b> tag found in the commit
       message. See the <b>Makefile</b>'s <b>tag-pbr</b> target.

   <b>GitHub</b> <b>Actions</b> <b>build</b>
       GitHub Actions automatically check pull requests are compiling and check for code style.

       Status of the latest build: <u>https://github.com/Guake/guake/actions</u>

   <b>Help</b> <b>for</b> <b>Package</b> <b>maintainers</b>
       This page is primarily targeted to package maintainers, willing to build and distribute  Guake  inside  a
       Linux Distribution, such as Debian, Arch, Fedora, and so on.

       It gives some information about how Guake is built.

       The major compatibility issues we experience if with the different version of VTE. We  try  to  integrate
       new  cool  VTE  features  when they are ready, and protect them with test on the version installed on the
       user's environment, but there may still be mistakes made, breaking the software for a given  environment.
       Do not hesitate to warn us for that!
