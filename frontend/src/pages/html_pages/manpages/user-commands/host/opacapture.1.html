       opacapture

       <b>(Host)</b> Captures critical system information into a zipped tar file. The resulting tar file should be sent
       to Customer Support along with any Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric problem report regarding this system.

       <b>NOTE:</b>  The  resulting  host capture file can require significant amounts of space on the host. The actual
       size varies, but sizes can be multiple megabytes. Intel recommends ensuring that adequate disk  space  is
       available on the host system.

</pre><h4><b>Syntax</b></h4><pre>
       opacapture [-d  <u>detail</u>]  <u>output_tgz_file</u>

</pre><h4><b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       --help

                 Produces full help text.

       -d <u>detail</u>

                 Captures level of detail:

                 1 (Local) Obtains local information from host. This is the default if no options are entered.

                 2 (Fabric)
                           In  addition to <u>Local</u>, also obtains basic fabric information by queries to the SM and
                           fabric error analysis using <b>opareport</b>.

                 3 (Fabric+FDB)
                           In addition to <u>Fabric</u>, also obtains the Forwarding Database (FDB), which includes the
                           switch forwarding tables from the SM and the server multicast membership.

                 4 (Analysis)
                           In addition to <u>Fabric+FDB</u>, also obtains opaallanalysis results. If opaallanalysis has
                           not yet been run, it is run as part of the capture.

              <b>NOTE:</b>
              Detail levels 2 - 4 can be used when fabric operational problems occur. If the  problem  is  node-
              specific,  detail  level 1 should be sufficient. Detail levels 2 - 4 require an operational Fabric
              Manager. Typically your support representative requests a given detail level. If  a  given  detail
              level takes excessively long or fails to be gathered, try a lower detail level.

       For  detail  levels 2 - 4, the additional information is only available on a node with Intel(R) Omni-Path
       Fabric Suite FastFabric Toolset installed. The information is gathered for every fabric specified in  the
       /etc/opa/ports file.

       <u>output_tgz_file</u>

                 Specifies  the  name  of  a  file  to  be  created  by  opacapture.  The file name specified is
                 overwritten if it already exists. Intel recommends using the  .tgz  suffix  in  the  file  name
                 supplied. If the filename given does not have a .tgz suffix, the .tgz suffix is added.
