</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       jack-dssi-host - a simple JACK host for DSSI plugins

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jack-dssi-host</b> <u>[-v]</u> <u>[-a]</u> <u>[-n]</u> <u>[-p</u> <u>&lt;projdir&gt;]</u> <u>[-c</u> <u>&lt;cname&gt;]</u> <u>[-&lt;i&gt;]</u> <u>&lt;libname&gt;[:&lt;label&gt;]</u> <u>[...]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jack-dssi-host</b>  is  a  simple  DSSI host that listens for MIDI events on an ALSA sequencer port, delivers
       them to DSSI synth plugins, and outputs the resulting audio via JACK.
       <b>jack-dssi-host</b> can host up to 16 instances of DSSI synth plugins, each of which is sequentially  assigned
       a MIDI channel from 1 to 16.  Plugin outputs (if `-a' is not specified) are connected sequentially to the
       available  JACK  physical output ports, wrapping back to the first JACK port whenever the available ports
       are exhausted.  Plugin user interfaces (UIs) are started for each instance (if '-n'  is  not  specified.)
       <b>jack-dssi-host</b> will exit when the last plugin UI has exited.
       As a special case, if <b>jack-dssi-host</b> is started with a name other than `jack-dssi-host', and if that name
       (plus  an  `.so'  suffix)  can  be  found in the DSSI_PATH search path (see <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> below) as a valid
       plugin shared library, and if no further command line arguments are given, then the first plugin in  that
       library will be loaded automatically. This provides a convenient way to run a plugin by simply symlinking
       the plugin's basename to jack-dssi-host.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v</b>     Verbose mode.

       <b>-a</b>     Disable automatic connection of outputs to JACK physical outputs.

       <b>-n</b>     Disable automatic starting of plugin user interfaces (UIs).

       <b>-p</b> <b>&lt;projdir&gt;</b>
              The project directory to pass to both plugin and UI.

       <b>-c</b> <b>&lt;cname&gt;</b>
              The client name to use for ALSA and JACK.

       <b>-&lt;i&gt;</b>   Number of instances of the following plugin to run (max 16 total, default 1).

       <b>&lt;libname&gt;</b>
              Name  of the DSSI plugin shared library (.so) to load. This may be an absolute path to the library
              file, or just the filename itself, in which case the DSSI search path is searched (see ENVIRONMENT
              below).

       <b>&lt;label&gt;</b>
              the label of the plugin to load from the library.  If this is omitted, the  first  plugin  in  the
              library is used.

       <b>[...]</b>  Optionally more instance counts, plugins and labels.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jack-dssi-host</b> <b>-2</b> <b>lib1.so</b> <b>-1</b> <b>lib2.so:fuzzy</b>
       Runs  two instances of the first plugin found in lib1.so, assigned to MIDI channels 1 and 2 and connected
       to the first available JACK outputs, and one instance of the "fuzzy" plugin in lib2.so on MIDI channel  3
       and connected to the next available JACK output.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>jack-dssi-host</b>  will  search  for plugin shared libraries in the directories specified by the environment
       variable <b>DSSI_PATH,</b> which is a colon-separated list of directories. If <b>DSSI_PATH</b> is not  set,  a  default
       search  path  of /usr/lib/dssi, /usr/local/lib/dssi, and (assuming the environment variable HOME is set,)
       $HOME/.dssi is used.
