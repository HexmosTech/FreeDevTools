       qhost - show the status of Grid Engine hosts, queues, jobs

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       <b>qhost</b> [<b>-F</b> [<u>resource_name</u><b>,</b>...]]  [<b>-help</b>] [<b>-h</b> <u>host_list</u>] [<b>-j</b>] [<b>-l</b> <u>resource</u>[<b>=</b><u>val</u>]<b>,</b>...]  [<b>-ncb</b>] [<b>-u</b> <u>user</u><b>,</b>...]
       [<b>-xml</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>qhost</u>  shows  the  current status of the available Grid Engine hosts, queues and the jobs associated with
       the queues. Selection options allow you to get information about specific hosts, queues, jobs  or  users.
       If  multiple  selections  are done a host is only displayed if all selection criteria for a host are met.
       Without any options <u>qhost</u> will display a list of all hosts without queue or job information.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-F</b> [<u>resource_name</u><b>,</b>...]
              <u>qhost</u> will present a detailed listing of the current resource availability per host  with  respect
              to  all resources (if the option argument is omitted) or with respect to those resources contained
              in the resource_name list. Please refer to the description of the <b>Full</b> <b>Format</b>  in  section  <b>OUTPUT</b>
              <b>FORMATS</b> below for further detail.

       <b>-help</b>  Prints a listing of all options.

       <b>-h</b> <u>host_list</u>
              Prints a list of all hosts contained in host_list.

       <b>-j</b>     Prints all jobs running on the queues hosted by the shown hosts. This switch calls <b>-q</b> implicitly.

       <b>-l</b> <u>resource</u>[<b>=</b><u>value</u>]<b>,</b>...
              Defines the resources to be granted by the hosts which should be included in the host list output.
              Matching  is performed on hosts based on non-mutable resource availability information only.  That
              means load  values  are  always  ignored  except  the  so-called  static  load  values  listed  in
              <u><a href="../man5/load_parameters.5.html">load_parameters</a></u>(5).   Also  consumable  utilization is ignored.  If there are multiple -l resource
              requests they will be concatenated by a logical AND: a host needs to match  all  resources  to  be
              displayed.

       <b>-ncb</b>   This  command  line switch can be used in order to get 6.2u5 compatible output with other <u><a href="../man1/qhost.1.html">qhost</a></u>(1)
              command line switches. In that  case  the  output  of  the  corresponding  command  will  suppress
              information  concerning  the execution host topology. Note that this option will be removed in the
              next major version.

       <b>-q</b>     Show information about the queues instances hosted by the displayed hosts.

       <b>-u</b> <u>user</u><b>,</b>...
              Display information only on those jobs and queues being associated with the users from  the  given
              user list.

       <b>-xml</b>   This option can be used with all other options and changes the output to XML. The used schemas are
              referenced in the XML output. The output is printed to stdout.

              If  the  <b>-xml</b>  parameter  is  combined with <b>-ncb</b> then the XML output will contain 6.2u5 compatible
              output.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       Depending on the presence or absence of the <b>-q</b> or <b>-F</b> and <b>-j</b>  option  three  output  formats  need  to  be
       differentiated.

   <b>Default</b> <b>Format</b> <b>(without</b> <b>-q,</b> <b>-F</b> <b>and</b> <b>-j)</b>
       For each host one line is printed. The output consists of consisting of

       •  the Hostname

       •  the Architecture.

       •  the  Number of processors.

       •  the Load.

       •  the Total Memory.

       •  the Used Memory.

       •  the Total Swapspace.

       •  the Used Swapspace.

       More details can be found in <u><a href="../man5/load_parameters.5.html">load_parameters</a></u>(5).

       If  the  <b>-q</b> option is supplied, each host status line also contains extra lines for every queue hosted by
       the host consisting of,

       •  the queue name,

       •  the queue type - one of B(atch), I(nteractive), or a combination thereof,

       •  the number of reserved (by  advance  reservation,  not  resource  reservation),  used  and,  available
          (according to the queue's <b>slots</b> parameter) job slots,

       •  the  state  of  the  queue  -  one  of u(nknown), a(larm), A(larm), C(alendar suspended), s(uspended),
          S(ubordinate), d(isabled), D(isabled), E(rror), (c)configuration ambiguous,  (o)rphaned,  (P)reempted,
          or  some  combinations  thereof.   See section "Full Format" in <u><a href="../man1/qstat.1.html">qstat</a></u>(1) for explanation of the status
          flags.

       If the <b>-F</b> option was used, resource availability information is printed following the host  status  line.
       For  each  resource  (as selected in an option argument to <b>-F</b> or for all resources if the option argument
       was omitted) a single line is displayed with the following format:

       •  a one letter specifier indicating whether the current resource availability  value  was  dominated  by
          either
          `<b>g</b>' - a cluster global,
          `<b>h</b>' - a host total or

       •  a second one letter specifier indicating the source for the current resource availability value, being
          one of
          `<b>l</b>' - a load value reported for the resource,
          `<b>L</b>' - a load value for the resource after administrator defined load scaling has been applied,
          `<b>c</b>' - availability derived from the consumable resources facility (see <u><a href="../man5/complexes.5.html">complexes</a></u>(5)),
          `<b>f</b>'  -  a  fixed  availability  definition  derived from a non-consumable complex attribute or a fixed
          resource limit.

       •  after a colon the name of the resource on which information is displayed.

       •  after an equal sign the current resource availability value.

       The displayed availability values and the sources from which they derive are always the minimum values of
       all possible combinations. Hence, for example, a line of the form "qf:h_vmem=4G" indicates that  a  queue
       currently  has  a maximum availability in virtual memory of 4 Gigabyte, where this value is a fixed value
       (e.g. a resource limit in the queue configuration) and it is queue dominated, i.e. the host in total  may
       have  more  virtual  memory  available than this, but the queue doesn't allow for more. Contrarily a line
       "hl:h_vmem=4G" would also indicate an upper bound of 4 Gigabyte  virtual  memory  availability,  but  the
       limit  would be derived from a load value currently reported for the host. So while the queue might allow
       for jobs with higher virtual memory requirements,  the  host  on  which  this  particular  queue  resides
       currently only has 4 Gigabyte available.

       After  the  queue  status line (in case of <b>-j</b>) a single line is printed for each job running currently in
       this queue. Each job status line contains

       •  the job ID,

       •  the job name,

       •  the job owner name,

       •  the status of the job - one of t(ransfering),  r(unning),  R(estarted),  s(uspended),  S(uspended)  or
          T(hreshold) (see the <b>Reduced</b> <b>Format</b> section for detailed information),

       •  the  start  date  and time and the function of the job (MASTER or SLAVE - only meaningful in case of a
          parallel job) and

       •  the priority of the jobs.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SGE_ROOT</b>       Specifies the location of the Grid Engine standard configuration files.

       <b>SGE_CELL</b>       If set, specifies the default Grid Engine cell. To address a Grid Engine cell  <u>qhost</u>  uses
                      (in the order of precedence):

                             The name of the cell specified in the environment variable SGE_CELL, if it is set.

                             The name of the default cell, i.e. <b>default</b>.

       <b>SGE_DEBUG_LEVEL</b>
                      If  set,  specifies  that  debug  information should be written to stderr. In addition the
                      level of detail in which debug information is generated is defined.

       <b>SGE_QMASTER_PORT</b>
                      If set, specifies the  tcp  port  on  which  <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8)  is  expected  to  listen  for
                      communication  requests.  Most installations will use a services map entry for the service
                      "sge_qmaster" instead to define that port.
