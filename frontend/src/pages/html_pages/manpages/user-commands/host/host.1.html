       host - DNS lookup utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>host</b>  [<b>-aACdlnrsTUwv</b>]  [<b>-c</b> class] [<b>-N</b> ndots] [<b>-p</b> port] [<b>-R</b> number] [<b>-t</b> type] [<b>-W</b> wait] [<b>-m</b> flag] [ [<b>-4</b>] |
       [<b>-6</b>] ] [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-V</b>] {name} [server]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>host</b> is a simple utility for performing DNS lookups. It is normally used to convert names to IP addresses
       and vice versa. When no arguments or options are given, <b>host</b> prints a short summary of  its  command-line
       arguments and options.

       <b>name</b>  is  the  domain  name  that  is  to be looked up. It can also be a dotted-decimal IPv4 address or a
       colon-delimited IPv6 address, in which case <b>host</b> by default performs a reverse lookup for  that  address.
       <b>server</b> is an optional argument which is either the name or IP address of the name server that <b>host</b> should
       query instead of the server or servers listed in <b><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-4</b>     This option specifies that only IPv4 should be used for query transport. See also the <u>-6</u> option.

       <b>-6</b>     This option specifies that only IPv6 should be used for query transport. See also the <u>-4</u> option.

       <b>-a</b>     The  <u>-a</u> ("all") option is normally equivalent to <u>-v</u> <u>-t</u> <u>ANY</u>. It also affects the behavior of the <u>-l</u>
              list zone option.

       <b>-A</b>     The <u>-A</u> ("almost all") option is equivalent to <u>-a</u>, except that RRSIG, NSEC, and NSEC3  records  are
              omitted from the output.

       <b>-c</b> <b>class</b>
              This  option  specifies  the query class, which can be used to lookup HS (Hesiod) or CH (Chaosnet)
              class resource records. The default class is IN (Internet).

       <b>-C</b>     This option indicates that <u>named</u> should check consistency,  meaning  that  <b>host</b>  queries  the  SOA
              records  for  zone  <b>name</b> from all the listed authoritative name servers for that zone. The list of
              name servers is defined by the NS records that are found for the zone.

       <b>-d</b>     This option prints debugging traces, and is equivalent to the <u>-v</u> verbose option.

       <b>-l</b>     This option tells <u>named</u> to list the zone, meaning the <b>host</b> command performs  a  zone  transfer  of
              zone <b>name</b> and prints out the NS, PTR, and address records (A/AAAA).

              Together, the <u>-l</u> <u>-a</u> options print all records in the zone.

       <b>-N</b> <b>ndots</b>
              This  option  specifies the number of dots (<b>ndots</b>) that have to be in <b>name</b> for it to be considered
              absolute. The default value is that defined using the <b>ndots</b> statement in <b><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></b>, or 1 if
              no <b>ndots</b> statement is present. Names with fewer dots are interpreted as relative  names,  and  are
              searched for in the domains listed in the <b>search</b> or <b>domain</b> directive in <b><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></b>.

       <b>-p</b> <b>port</b>
              This option specifies the port to query on the server. The default is 53.

       <b>-r</b>     This option specifies a non-recursive query; setting this option clears the RD (recursion desired)
              bit  in the query. This means that the name server receiving the query does not attempt to resolve
              <b>name</b>. The <u>-r</u> option enables <b>host</b> to mimic the behavior of a name server  by  making  non-recursive
              queries,  and  expecting  to  receive answers to those queries that can be referrals to other name
              servers.

       <b>-R</b> <b>number</b>
              This option specifies the number of retries for UDP queries. If <b>number</b> is negative  or  zero,  the
              number  of  retries  is  silently  set  to 1. The default value is 1, or the value of the <b>attempts</b>
              option in <b><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></b>, if set.

       <b>-s</b>     This option tells <u>named</u> <u>not</u> to send the query to the next nameserver if any server responds with a
              SERVFAIL response, which is the reverse of normal stub resolver behavior.

       <b>-t</b> <b>type</b>
              This option specifies the query type. The <b>type</b> argument can be any recognized query  type:  CNAME,
              NS, SOA, TXT, DNSKEY, AXFR, etc.

              When no query type is specified, <b>host</b> automatically selects an appropriate query type. By default,
              it looks for A, AAAA, and MX records. If the <u>-C</u> option is given, queries are made for SOA records.
              If  <b>name</b>  is  a  dotted-decimal IPv4 address or colon-delimited IPv6 address, <b>host</b> queries for PTR
              records.

              If a query type of IXFR is chosen, the starting serial number can be  specified  by  appending  an
              equals sign (=), followed by the starting serial number, e.g., <u>-t</u> <u>IXFR=12345678</u>.

       <b>-T,</b> <b>-U</b> This  option  specifies  TCP  or UDP. By default, <b>host</b> uses UDP when making queries; the <u>-T</u> option
              makes it use a TCP connection when querying the name server. TCP  is  automatically  selected  for
              queries  that  require it, such as zone transfer (AXFR) requests. Type <b>ANY</b> queries default to TCP,
              but can be forced to use UDP initially via <u>-U</u>.

       <b>-m</b> <b>flag</b>
              This option sets memory usage debugging: the flag can be <b>record</b>, <b>usage</b>, or <b>trace</b>.  The  <u>-m</u>  option
              can be specified more than once to set multiple flags.

       <b>-v</b>     This option sets verbose output, and is equivalent to the <u>-d</u> debug option. Verbose output can also
              be enabled by setting the <b>debug</b> option in <b><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></b>.

       <b>-V</b>     This option prints the version number and exits.

       <b>-w</b>     This option sets "wait forever": the query timeout is set to the maximum possible. See also the <u>-W</u>
              option.

       <b>-W</b> <b>wait</b>
              This options sets the length of the wait timeout, indicating that <u>named</u> should wait for up to <b>wait</b>
              seconds for a reply. If <b>wait</b> is less than 1, the wait interval is set to 1 second.

              By  default,  <b>host</b> waits for 5 seconds for UDP responses and 10 seconds for TCP connections. These
              defaults can be overridden by the <b>timeout</b> option in <b><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></b>.

              See also the <u>-w</u> option.

</pre><h4><b>IDN</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       If <b>host</b> has been built with IDN (internationalized domain  name)  support,  it  can  accept  and  display
       non-ASCII  domain names. <b>host</b> appropriately converts character encoding of a domain name before sending a
       request to a DNS server or displaying a reply from the server.  To  turn  off  IDN  support,  define  the
       <b>IDN_DISABLE</b> environment variable. IDN support is disabled if the variable is set when <b>host</b> runs.
