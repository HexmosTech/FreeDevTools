</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pdcp - copy files to groups of hosts in parallel
       rpdcp - (reverse pdcp) copy files from a group of hosts in parallel

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pdcp</b> [<u>options</u>]... src [src2...] dest
       <b>rpdcp</b> [<u>options</u>]... src [src2...] dir

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pdcp</b> is a variant of the <a href="../man1/rcp.1.html">rcp</a>(1) command.  Unlike <a href="../man1/rcp.1.html">rcp</a>(1), which copies files to a single remote host, <b>pdcp</b>
       can  copy  files  to  multiple  remote  hosts in parallel.  However, <b>pdcp</b> does not recognize files in the
       format ``rname@rhost:path,'' therefore all source files must be on the local host  machine.   Destination
       nodes  must  be  listed on the <b>pdcp</b> command line using a suitable target nodelist option (See the <u>OPTIONS</u>
       section below).  Each destination node listed must have <b>pdcp</b> installed for the copy to succeed.

       When <b>pdcp</b> receives SIGINT (ctrl-C), it lists the status of current threads.  A second SIGINT  within  one
       second  terminates  the  program.  Pending threads may be canceled by issuing ctrl-Z within one second of
       ctrl-C.  Pending threads are those that have not yet been initiated, or  are  still  in  the  process  of
       connecting to the remote host.

       Like <a href="../man1/pdsh.1.html">pdsh</a>(1), the functionality of <b>pdcp</b> may be supplemented by dynamically loadable modules. In <b>pdcp</b>, the
       modules  may  provide  a new connect protocol (replacing the standard <a href="../man1/rsh.1.html">rsh</a>(1) protocol), filtering options
       (e.g. excluding hosts that are down), and/or host selection options (e.g. <u>-a</u> selects  all  nodes  from  a
       local  config  file).   By default, <b>pdcp</b> requires at least one "rcmd" module to be loaded (to provide the
       channel for remote copy).

</pre><h4><b>REVERSE</b> <b>PDCP</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rpdcp</b> performs a reverse parallel copy.  Rather than copying files to remote hosts, files  are  retrieved
       from  remote  hosts  and  stored  locally.   All directories or files retrieved will be stored with their
       remote hostname appended to the filename.  The destination file must be a directory when this  option  is
       used.

       In  other respects, <b>rpdcp</b> is exactly like <b>pdcp</b>, and further statements regarding <b>pdcp</b> in this manual also
       apply to <b>rpdcp</b>.

</pre><h4><b>RCMD</b> <b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       The method by which <b>pdcp</b> connects to remote hosts may be selected at runtime using  the  <u>-R</u>  option  (See
       <u>OPTIONS</u>  below).   This  functionality is ultimately implemented via dynamically loadable modules, and so
       the list of available options may be different from installation to installation.  A  list  of  currently
       available  rcmd  modules  is printed when using any of the <u>-h</u>, <u>-V</u>, or <u>-L</u> options. The default rcmd module
       will also be displayed with the <u>-h</u> and <u>-V</u> options.

       A list of <u>rcmd</u> modules currently distributed with <b>pdcp</b> follows.

       rsh     Uses an internal, thread-safe implementation of BSD <a href="../man3/rcmd.3.html">rcmd</a>(3) to run commands  using  the  standard
               <a href="../man1/rsh.1.html">rsh</a>(1) protocol.

       ssh     Uses a variant of <a href="../man3/popen.3.html">popen</a>(3) to run multiple copies of the <a href="../man1/ssh.1.html">ssh</a>(1) command.

       mrsh    This  module uses the <a href="../man1/mrsh.1.html">mrsh</a>(1) protocol to execute jobs on remote hosts.  The mrsh protocol uses a
               credential based authentication, forgoing the need to allocate reserved ports. In other  aspects,
               it acts just like rsh.

       krb4    The  krb4  module  allows users to execute remote commands after authenticating with kerberos. Of
               course, the remote rshd daemons must be kerberized.

       xcpu    The xcpu module uses the xcpu service to execute remote commands.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The list of available <b>pdcp</b> options is determined at runtime by supplementing the list  of  standard  <b>pdcp</b>
       options  with  any  options provided by loaded <u>rcmd</u> and <u>misc</u> modules.  In some cases, options provided by
       modules may conflict with each other. In these cases, the modules are incompatible and the  first  module
       loaded wins.

</pre><h4><b>Standard</b> <b>target</b> <b>nodelist</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-w</b> <u>TARGETS,...</u>
              Target and or filter the specified list of hosts. Do not use with any other node selection options
              (e.g.  <u>-a</u>,  <u>-g</u>,  if  they  are  available).  No  spaces  are  allowed in the comma-separated list.
              Arguments in the <u>TARGETS</u> list may include normal host names, a range of hosts in  hostlist  format
              (See <b>HOSTLIST</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b>), or a single `-' character to read the list of hosts on stdin.

              If  a  host  or  hostlist is preceded by a `-' character, this causes those hosts to be explicitly
              excluded. If the argument is preceded by a single `^' character, it is taken to  be  the  path  to
              file  containing  a  list  of  hosts, one per line. If the item begins with a `/' character, it is
              taken  as a regular expression on which to filter the list of hosts (a regex argument may also  be
              optionally  trailed  by  another  '/',  e.g.  /node.*/). A regex or file name argument may also be
              preceeded by a minus `-' to exclude instead of include thoses hosts.

              A list of hosts may also be preceded by "user@" to  specify  a  remote  username  other  than  the
              default,  or  "rcmd_type:" to specify an alternate rcmd connection type for these hosts. When used
              together, the rcmd type must be specified first, e.g. "ssh:user1@host0" would use ssh  to  connect
              to host0 as user "user1."

       <b>-x</b> <u>host,host,...</u>
              Exclude  the  specified hosts. May be specified in conjunction with other target node list options
              such as <u>-a</u> and <u>-g</u> (when available). Hostlists may also be specified to  the  <u>-x</u>  option  (see  the
              <b>HOSTLIST</b>  <b>EXPRESSIONS</b>  section below). Arguments to <u>-x</u> may also be preceeded by the filename (`^')
              and regex ('/') characters as described above, in which case the resulting hosts are  excluded  as
              if they had been given to <b>-w</b> and preceeded with the minus `-' character.

</pre><h4><b>Standard</b> <b>pdcp</b> <b>options</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-h</u>     Output  usage  menu  and  quit. A list of available rcmd modules will be printed at the end of the
              usage message.

       <u>-q</u>     List option values and the target nodelist and exit without action.

       <u>-b</u>     Disable ctrl-C status feature so that a single ctrl-C kills parallel copy. (Batch Mode)

       <u>-r</u>     Copy directories recursively.

       <u>-p</u>     Preserve modification time and modes.

       <u>-e</u> <u>PATH</u>
              Explicitly specify path to remote <b>pdcp</b> binary instead of using the locally executed path. Can also
              be set via the environment variable PDSH_REMOTE_PDCP_PATH.

       <u>-l</u> <u>user</u>
              This option may be used to copy files as another user, subject to  authorization.  For  BSD  rcmd,
              this means the invoking user and system must be listed in the userÂ´s .rhosts file (even for root).

       <u>-t</u> <u>seconds</u>
              Set the connect timeout. Default is 10 seconds.

       <u>-f</u> <u>number</u>
              Set the maximum number of simultaneous remote copies to <u>number</u>.  The default is 32.

       <u>-R</u> <u>name</u>
              Set  rcmd module to <u>name</u>. This option may also be set via the PDSH_RCMD_TYPE environment variable.
              A list of available rcmd modules may be obtained via either the <u>-h</u> or <u>-L</u> options.

       <u>-M</u> <u>name,...</u>
              When multiple <b>misc</b> modules provide the same options to <b>pdsh</b>, the first module  initialized  "wins"
              and  subsequent  modules  are  not loaded.  The <u>-M</u> option allows a list of modules to be specified
              that will be force-initialized before all  others,  in-effect  ensuring  that  they  load  without
              conflict   (unless   they  conflict  with  eachother).  This  option  may  also  be  set  via  the
              PDSH_MISC_MODULES environment variable.

       <u>-L</u>     List info on all loaded <b>pdcp</b> modules and quit.

       <u>-d</u>     Include more complete thread status when SIGINT is received, and display connect and command  time
              statistics on stderr when done.

       <u>-V</u>     Output <b>pdcp</b> version information, along with list of currently loaded modules, and exit.

</pre><h4><b>HOSTLIST</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       As  noted  in  sections above, <b>pdcp</b> accepts ranges of hostnames in the general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...],
       where n &lt; m and l &lt; k, etc., as an alternative to explicit lists of  hosts.   This  form  should  not  be
       confused  with  regular  expression character classes (also denoted by ``[]''). For example, foo[19] does
       not represent foo1 or foo9, but rather represents a degenerate range: foo19.

       This range syntax is meant only as a convenience on  clusters  with  a  prefixNN  naming  convention  and
       specification  of  ranges  should not be considered necessary -- the list foo1,foo9 could be specified as
       such, or by the range foo[1,9].

       Some examples of range usage follow:

       Copy <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a> to foo01,foo02,...,foo05
           pdcp -w foo[01-05] <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a> <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>

       Copy <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a> to foo7,foo9,foo10
           pdcp -w foo[7,9-10] <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a> <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>

       Copy <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a> to foo0,foo4,foo5
           pdcp -w foo[0-5] -x foo[1-3] <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a> <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>

       As a reminder to the reader, some shells will interpret brackets ('['  and  ']')  for  pattern  matching.
       Depending  on  your  shell,  it  may be necessary to enclose ranged lists within quotes.  For example, in
       tcsh, the first example above should be executed as:

           pdcp -w "foo[01-05]" <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a> <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>

</pre><h4><b>ORIGIN</b></h4><pre>
       Pdsh/pdcp was originally a rewrite of IBM <a href="../man1/dsh.1.html">dsh</a>(1) by Jim Garlick &lt;<a href="mailto:garlick@llnl.gov">garlick@llnl.gov</a>&gt; on LLNL's  ASCI  Blue-
       Pacific IBM SP system.  It is now also used on Linux clusters at LLNL.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       When using <b>ssh</b> for remote execution, stderr of ssh to be folded in with that of the remote command.  When
       invoked  by pdcp, it is not possible for ssh to prompt for confirmation if a host key changes, prompt for
       passwords if RSA keys are not configured properly, etc..  Finally, the connect timeout is only adjustable
       with ssh when the underlying ssh implementation supports it, and pdsh has been built to use  the  correct
       option.
