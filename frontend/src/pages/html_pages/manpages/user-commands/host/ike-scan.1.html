</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ike-scan - Discover and fingerprint IKE hosts (IPsec VPN servers)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ike-scan</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>hosts</u>...]

       Target hosts must be specified on the command line unless the <b>--file</b> option is specified.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ike-scan</b> discovers IKE hosts and can also fingerprint them using the retransmission backoff pattern.

       <b>ike-scan</b> does two things:

       1)     Discovery:  Determine  which  hosts are running IKE.  This is done by displaying those hosts which
              respond to the IKE requests sent by <b>ike-scan.</b>

       2)     Fingerprinting: Determine which IKE implementation the hosts are using.  There are several ways to
              do this: (a) Backoff fingerprinting - recording the times of the IKE  response  packets  from  the
              target hosts and comparing the observed retransmission backoff pattern against known patterns; (b)
              vendor  id  fingerprinting  -  matching  the  vendor-specific  vendor  IDs against known vendor ID
              patterns; and (c) proprietary notify message codes.

       The retransmission backoff fingerprinting concept  is  discussed  in  more  detail  in  the  UDP  backoff
       fingerprinting  paper  which  should  be  included  in  the  ike-scan  kit as <u>udp-backoff-fingerprinting-</u>
       <u>paper.txt.</u>

       The program sends IKE Phase-1 requests to the  specified  hosts  and  displays  any  responses  that  are
       received.  It handles retry and retransmission with backoff to cope with packet loss.  It also limits the
       amount of bandwidth used by the outbound IKE packets.

       IKE  is the Internet Key Exchange protocol which is the key exchange and authentication mechanism used by
       IPsec.  Just about all modern VPN systems implement IPsec, and the vast majority of IPsec  VPNs  use  IKE
       for key exchange.

       Phase-1  has  two modes: Main Mode and Aggressive Mode.  ike-scan supports both Main and Aggressive mode,
       and uses Main Mode by default.  RFC 2409 (IKE) section 5 specifies that main mode  must  be  implemented,
       therefore all IKE implementations can be expected to support main mode.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b> <b>or</b> <b>-h</b>
              Display this usage message and exit.

       <b>--file=&lt;fn&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-f</b> <b>&lt;fn&gt;</b>
              Read  hostnames or addresses from the specified file instead of from the command line. One name or
              IP address per line.  Use "-" for standard input.

       <b>--sport=&lt;p&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-s</b> <b>&lt;p&gt;</b>
              Set UDP source port to &lt;p&gt;, default=500, 0=random.  Some IKE implementations require the client to
              use UDP source port 500 and will not talk to other ports.   Note  that  superuser  privileges  are
              normally  required to use non-zero source ports below 1024.  Also only one process on a system may
              bind to a given source port at any one time. Use of the --nat-t option changes the default  source
              port to 4500

       <b>--dport=&lt;p&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-d</b> <b>&lt;p&gt;</b>
              Set UDP destination port to &lt;p&gt;, default=500.  UDP port 500 is the assigned port number for ISAKMP
              and  this  is  the  port  used  by  most if not all IKE implementations. Use of the --nat-t option
              changes the default destination port to 4500

       <b>--retry=&lt;n&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-r</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Set total number of attempts per host to &lt;n&gt;, default=3.

       <b>--timeout=&lt;n&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-t</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Set initial per host timeout to &lt;n&gt; ms, default=500.  This timeout is for the first packet sent to
              each host.  subsequent timeouts are multiplied by the backoff factor which is set with --backoff.

       <b>--bandwidth=&lt;n&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-B</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Set desired outbound bandwidth to &lt;n&gt;, default=56000 The value is in bits per second  by  default.
              If  you  append "K" to the value, then the units are kilobits per second; and if you append "M" to
              the value, the units are megabits per second.  The "K" and "M" suffixes represent the decimal, not
              binary, multiples.  So 64K is 64000, not 65536.

       <b>--interval=&lt;n&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-i</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Set minimum packet interval to &lt;n&gt; ms.  The packet interval will be no smaller than  this  number.
              The  interval  specified is in milliseconds by default.  if "u" is appended to the value, then the
              interval is in microseconds, and if "s" is appended, the interval is in seconds.  If you  want  to
              use  up to a given bandwidth, then it is easier to use the --bandwidth option instead.  You cannot
              specify both --interval and --bandwidth because they are just different ways to  change  the  same
              underlying variable.

       <b>--backoff=&lt;b&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-b</b> <b>&lt;b&gt;</b>
              Set  timeout  backoff  factor  to  &lt;b&gt;,  default=1.50.  The per-host timeout is multiplied by this
              factor after each timeout.  So, if the number of retries is 3, the  initial  per-host  timeout  is
              500ms  and  the  backoff factor is 1.5, then the first timeout will be 500ms, the second 750ms and
              the third 1125ms.

       <b>--verbose</b> <b>or</b> <b>-v</b>
              Display verbose progress messages.  Use more than once for greater effect: 1 - Show when each pass
              is completed and when packets with invalid cookies are received.  2 - Show each  packet  sent  and
              received  and  when  hosts are removed from the list.  3 - Display the host, Vendor ID and backoff
              lists before scanning starts.

       <b>--quiet</b> <b>or</b> <b>-q</b>
              Don't decode the returned packet.  This prints less protocol information so the output  lines  are
              shorter.

       <b>--multiline</b> <b>or</b> <b>-M</b>
              Split  the payload decode across multiple lines.  With this option, the decode for each payload is
              printed on a separate line starting with a TAB.  This option makes  the  output  easier  to  read,
              especially when there are many payloads.

       <b>--lifetime=&lt;s&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-l</b> <b>&lt;s&gt;</b>
              Set IKE lifetime to &lt;s&gt; seconds, default=28800.  RFC 2407 specifies 28800 as the default, but some
              implementations  may  require  different values.  If you specify this as a a decimal integer, e.g.
              86400, then the attribute will use a 4-byte value.  If you specify it as a hex number, e.g.  0xFF,
              then  the  attribute  will  use  the  appropriate  size value (one byte for this example).  If you
              specify the string "none" then no lifetime attribute will be added  at  all.   You  can  use  this
              option  more  than  once  in  conjunction  with  the --trans options to produce multiple transform
              payloads with different lifetimes.  Each --trans option will use the previously specified lifetime
              value.

       <b>--lifesize=&lt;s&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-z</b> <b>&lt;s&gt;</b>
              Set IKE lifesize to &lt;s&gt; Kilobytes, default=0.  If you specify this as a a  decimal  integer,  e.g.
              86400,  then the attribute will use a 4-byte value.  If you specify it as a hex number, e.g. 0xFF,
              then the attribute will use the appropriate size value (one byte for this example).  You  can  use
              this  option  more than once in conjunction with the --trans options to produce multiple transform
              payloads with different lifesizes.  Each --trans option will use the previously specified lifesize
              value.

       <b>--auth=&lt;n&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-m</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Set auth. method to &lt;n&gt;, default=1 (PSK).  RFC defined values are 1 to 5.  See RFC  2409  Appendix
              A.   Checkpoint  hybrid  mode  is  64221.  GSS (Windows "Kerberos") is 65001.  XAUTH uses 65001 to
              65010.  This is not applicable to IKEv2.

       <b>--version</b> <b>or</b> <b>-V</b>
              Display program version and exit.

       <b>--vendor=&lt;v&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-e</b> <b>&lt;v&gt;</b>
              Set vendor id string to hex value &lt;v&gt;.  You can use this option more than once  to  send  multiple
              vendor ID payloads.

       <b>--trans=&lt;t&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-a</b> <b>&lt;t&gt;</b>
              Use  custom  transform &lt;t&gt; instead of default set.  You can use this option more than once to send
              an arbitrary number of custom transforms.  There are two ways to specify the  transform:  The  new
              way, where you specify the attribute/value pairs, and the old way where you specify the values for
              a  fixed  list  of attributes.  For the new method, the transform &lt;t&gt; is specified as (attr=value,
              attr=value, ...)  Where "attr" is the attribute number, and "value" is the value to assign to that
              attribute.  You can specify an arbitary number of attribute/value pairs.  See RFC 2409 Appendix  A
              for  details  of the attributes and values.  Note that brackets are special to some shells, so you
              may need to quote them, e.g. --trans="(1=1,2=2,3=3,4=4)".  For example,  --trans=(1=1,2=2,3=1,4=2)
              specifies      Enc=3DES-CBC,      Hash=SHA1,      Auth=shared     key,     DH     Group=2;     and
              --trans=(1=7,14=128,2=1,3=3,4=5) specifies Enc=AES/128, Hash=MD5, Auth=RSA sig, DH  Group=5.   For
              the  old  method,  the  transform &lt;t&gt; is specified as enc[/len],hash,auth,group.  Where enc is the
              encryption algorithm, len is the key  length  for  variable  length  ciphers,  hash  is  the  hash
              algorithm,  and  group  is  the  DH  Group.   For example, --trans=5,2,1,2 specifies Enc=3DES-CBC,
              Hash=SHA1, Auth=shared key, DH Group=2; and --trans=7/256,1,1,5 specifies  Enc=AES-256,  Hash=MD5,
              Auth=shared key, DH Group=5.  This option is not yet supported for IKEv2.

       <b>--showbackoff[=&lt;n&gt;]</b> <b>or</b> <b>-o[&lt;n&gt;]</b>
              Display  the  backoff  fingerprint  table.   Display  the  backoff  table  to  fingerprint the IKE
              implementation on the remote hosts.  The optional argument specifies time to wait in seconds after
              receiving the last packet, default=60.  If you are using the short form of the  option  (-o)  then
              the value must immediately follow the option letter with no spaces, e.g. -o25 not -o 25.

       <b>--fuzz=&lt;n&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-u</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Set  pattern  matching  fuzz  to &lt;n&gt; ms, default=500.  This sets the maximum acceptable difference
              between the observed backoff times and the reference times in the backoff patterns  file.   Larger
              values  allow  for  higher  variance but also increase the risk of false positive identifications.
              Any per-pattern-entry fuzz specifications in the patterns file will override the value set here.

       <b>--patterns=&lt;f&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-p</b> <b>&lt;f&gt;</b>
              Use IKE backoff patterns file &lt;f&gt;,  default=/usr/local/share/ike-scan/ike-backoff-patterns.   This
              specifies  the  name  of  the  file  containing IKE backoff patterns.  This file is only used when
              --showbackoff is specified.

       <b>--vidpatterns=&lt;f&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-I</b> <b>&lt;f&gt;</b>
              Use Vendor ID patterns file &lt;f&gt;, default=/usr/local/share/ike-scan/ike-vendor-ids.  This specifies
              the name of the file containing Vendor ID  patterns.   These  patterns  are  used  for  Vendor  ID
              fingerprinting.

       <b>--aggressive</b> <b>or</b> <b>-A</b>
              Use  IKE Aggressive Mode (The default is Main Mode) If you specify --aggressive, then you may also
              specify --dhgroup, --id and --idtype.  If you use custom transforms with aggressive mode with  the
              --trans  option,  note that all transforms should have the same DH Group and this should match the
              group specified with --dhgroup or the default if --dhgroup is not used.

       <b>--id=&lt;id&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-n</b> <b>&lt;id&gt;</b>
              Use &lt;id&gt; as the identification value.  This option is only applicable to  Aggressive  Mode.   &lt;id&gt;
              can  be  specified  as  a  string,  e.g.  --id=test  or  as  a hex value with a leading "0x", e.g.
              --id=0xdeadbeef.

       <b>--idtype=&lt;n&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-y</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Use identification type &lt;n&gt;.  Default  3  (ID_USER_FQDN).   This  option  is  only  applicable  to
              Aggressive Mode.  See RFC 2407 4.6.2 for details of Identification types.

       <b>--dhgroup=&lt;n&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-g</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Use  Diffie  Hellman Group &lt;n&gt;.  Default 2.  This option is only applicable to Aggressive Mode and
              IKEv2.  For both of these, it is used to determine the size of the key exchange payload.   If  you
              use  Aggressive  Mode  with  custom  transforms,  then you will normally need to use the --dhgroup
              option unless you are using the default DH  group.   Acceptable  values  are  1,2,5,14,15,16,17,18
              (MODP only).

       <b>--gssid=&lt;n&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-G</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Use  GSS  ID &lt;n&gt; where &lt;n&gt; is a hex string.  This uses transform attribute type 16384 as specified
              in draft-ietf-ipsec-isakmp-gss-auth-07.txt, although Windows-2000 has been observed to  use  32001
              as  well.   For  Windows  2000,  you'll  need  to  use  --auth=65001  to  specify  Kerberos  (GSS)
              authentication.

       <b>--random</b> <b>or</b> <b>-R</b>
              Randomise the host list.  This option randomises the order of the hosts in the host list,  so  the
              IKE probes are sent to the hosts in a random order.  It uses the Knuth shuffle algorithm.

       <b>--tcp[=&lt;n&gt;]</b> <b>or</b> <b>-T[&lt;n&gt;]</b>
              Use TCP transport instead of UDP.  This allows you to test a host running IKE over TCP.  You won't
              normally  need  this  option because the vast majority of IPsec systems only support IKE over UDP.
              The optional value &lt;n&gt; specifies the type of IKE over  TCP.   There  are  currently  two  possible
              values:  1  =  RAW  IKE over TCP as used by Checkpoint (default); 2 = Encapsulated IKE over TCP as
              used by Cisco.  If you are using the short form of the option (-T) then the value must immediately
              follow the option letter with no spaces, e.g. -T2 not -T 2.  You can only specify a single  target
              host if you use this option.

       <b>--tcptimeout=&lt;n&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-O</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Set  TCP  connect  timeout  to &lt;n&gt; seconds (default=10).  This is only applicable to TCP transport
              mode.

       <b>--pskcrack[=&lt;f&gt;]</b> <b>or</b> <b>-P[&lt;f&gt;]</b>
              Crack aggressive mode pre-shared keys.  This option outputs the  aggressive  mode  pre-shared  key
              (PSK)  parameters  for  offline  cracking using the "psk-crack" program that is supplied with ike-
              scan.  You can optionally specify a filename, &lt;f&gt;, to write the PSK parameters to.  If you do  not
              specify  a  filename then the PSK parameters are written to standard output.  If you are using the
              short form of the option (-P) then the value must immediately follow the  option  letter  with  no
              spaces,  e.g.  -Pfile  not  -P  file.   You  can only specify a single target host if you use this
              option.  This option is only applicable to IKE aggressive mode.

       <b>--nodns</b> <b>or</b> <b>-N</b>
              Do not use DNS to resolve names.  If you use this option, then all hosts must be specified  as  IP
              addresses.

       <b>--noncelen=&lt;n&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-c</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Set the nonce length to &lt;n&gt; bytes. Default=20 This option controls the length of the nonce payload
              that is sent in an aggressive mode or IKEv2 request.  Normally there is no need to use this option
              unless  you  want  to reduce the nonce size to speed up pre-shared key cracking, or if you want to
              see how a particular server handles different length nonce payloads.  RFC  2409  states  that  the
              length  of  nonce  payload  must  be  between 8 and 256 bytes, but ike-scan does not enforce this.
              Specifying a large nonce length will increase the size of the packet  sent  by  ike-scan.  A  very
              large  nonce length may cause fragmentation, or exceed the maximum IP packet size.  This option is
              only applicable to IKE aggressive mode.

       <b>--headerlen=&lt;n&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-L</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Set the length in the ISAKMP header to &lt;n&gt; bytes.  You can use this option to manually specify the
              value to be used for the ISAKMP header length.  By default, ike-scan  will  fill  in  the  correct
              value.   Use  this  option  to manually specify an incorrect length.  &lt;n&gt; can be specified as "+n"
              which sets the length to n bytes more than it should be, "-n" which sets it to n  bytes  less,  or
              "n"  which  sets  it  to  exactly  bytes.   Changing  the  header length to an incorrect value can
              sometimes disrupt VPN servers.

       <b>--mbz=&lt;n&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-Z</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Use the value &lt;n&gt; for reserved (MBZ) fields, default=0.  Specifying this option makes the outgoing
              packet non-RFC compliant, and should only be used if you want to see how a VPN server will respond
              to invalid packets.  The value of &lt;n&gt; should be in the range 0-255.

       <b>--headerver=&lt;n&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-E</b> <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Specify the ISAKMP  header  version.   The  default  is  0x10  (16)  which  corresponds  to  v1.0.
              Specifying a non-default value will make the outgoing packet non-RFC compliant, and should only be
              used if you want to see how the VPN server reacts to strange versions.  The value should be in the
              range 0-255.

       <b>--certreq=&lt;c&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-C</b> <b>&lt;c&gt;</b>
              Add  the  CertificateRequest payload &lt;c&gt;.  &lt;c&gt; should be specified as a hex value.  The first byte
              of the hex value will be  interpreted  as  the  certificate  type;  the  remaining  bytes  as  the
              certificate authority as described in RFC 2408 3.10.  The certificate types are listed in RFC 2408
              sec  3.9.   RFC  2408 states "The Certificate Request payload MUST be accepted at any point during
              the exchange"

       <b>--doi=&lt;d&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-D</b> <b>&lt;d&gt;</b>
              Set the SA DOI to &lt;d&gt;, default 1 (IPsec).  You will not normally want to change  this  unless  you
              want to see how the VPN server responds to a non-standard DOI.

       <b>--situation=&lt;s&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-S</b> <b>&lt;s&gt;</b>
              Set  the  SA Situation to &lt;d&gt;, default 1.  The meaning of the situation depends on the DOI, and is
              detailed in the appropriate DOI  document.   For  the  IPsec  DOI,  the  default  Situation  of  1
              represents  SIT_IDENTITY_ONLY.   You  will not normally want to change this unless you want to see
              how the VPN server responds to a non-standard situation.

       <b>--protocol=&lt;p&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-j</b> <b>&lt;p&gt;</b>
              Set the Proposal protocol ID to &lt;p&gt;, default 1.  The meaning of the proposal protocol  ID  depends
              on  the  DOI,  and  is  detailed  in the appropriate DOI document.  For the IPsec DOI, the default
              proposal protocol id of 1 represents PROTO_ISAKMP.  You will not  normally  want  to  change  this
              unless you want to see how the VPN server responds to a non-standard protocol ID.

       <b>--transid=&lt;t&gt;</b> <b>or</b> <b>-k</b> <b>&lt;t&gt;</b>
              Set  the  Transform ID to &lt;t&gt;, default 1.  The meaning of the transform ID depends on the DOI, and
              is detailed in the appropriate DOI document.  For the IPsec DOI, the default  transform  id  of  1
              represents  KEY_IKE.  You will not normally want to change this unless you want to see how the VPN
              server responds to a non-standard transform ID.

       <b>--spisize=&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Set the proposal SPI size to &lt;n&gt;.  Default=0 If this  is  non-zero,  then  a  random  SPI  of  the
              specified size will be added to the proposal payload.  The default of zero means no SPI.

       <b>--hdrflags=&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Set the ISAKMP header flags to &lt;n&gt;.  Default=0 The flags are detailed in RFC 2408 section 3.1

       <b>--hdrmsgid=&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Set the ISAKMP header message ID to &lt;n&gt;.  Default=0 This should be zero for IKE Phase-1.

       <b>--cookie=&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Set  the  ISAKMP initiator cookie to &lt;n&gt; The cookie value should be specified in hex.  By default,
              the cookies are automatically generated and have unique values.  If you specify this option,  then
              you  can  only specify a single target, because ike-scan requires unique cookie values to match up
              the response packets.

       <b>--exchange=&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Set the exchange type to &lt;n&gt; This option allows you to change the  exchange  type  in  the  ISAKMP
              header  to an arbitrary value.  Note that ike-scan only supports Main and Aggressive modes (values
              2 and 4 respectively).  Specifying other values will change the exchange type value in the  ISAKMP
              header,  but  will  not adjust the other payloads.  The exchange types are defined in RFC 2408 sec
              3.1.

       <b>--nextpayload=&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Set the next payload in the ISAKMP header to &lt;n&gt; Normally, the next payload is  automatically  set
              to the correct value.

       <b>--randomseed=&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Use &lt;n&gt; to seed the pseudo random number generator.  This option seeds the PRNG with the specified
              number,  which can be useful if you want to ensure that the packet data is exactly repeatable when
              it includes payloads with random data such as key exchange or nonce.   By  default,  the  PRNG  is
              seeded with an unpredictable value.

       <b>--timestamp</b>
              Display  timestamps for received packets.  This option causes a timestamp to be displayed for each
              received packet.

       <b>--sourceip=&lt;s&gt;</b>
              Set source IP address for outgoing packets to &lt;s&gt;.  This option causes the outgoing IKE packets to
              have the specified source IP address.  The address can either be an  IP  address  in  dotted  quad
              format,  or  the  string "random" which will use a different random source address for each packet
              that is sent.  If this option is used, no packets will be received This option requires raw socket
              support, and you will need superuser privileges to use this option, even if  you  specify  a  high
              source port.  This option does not work on all operating systems.

       <b>--shownum</b>
              Display  the  host  number  for  received  packets.   This displays the ordinal host number of the
              responding host before the IP address. It can be useful when sending  many  packets  to  the  same
              target IP, to see if any probes are being ignored.

       <b>--nat-t</b>
              Use RFC 3947 NAT-Traversal encapsulation.  This option adds the non-ESP marker to the beginning of
              outgoing  packets  and  strips it from received packets, as described in RFC 3947. It also changes
              the default source port to 4500 and the default destination port to 4500, which are the ports  for
              NAT-T IKE.  These port numbers can be changed with the --sport and --dport options, providing they
              are used after the --nat-t option.

       <b>--rcookie=&lt;n&gt;</b>
              Set  the  ISAKMP  responder  cookie  to  &lt;n&gt;.  This sets the responder cookie to the specified hex
              value.  By default, the responder cookie is set to zero.

       <b>--ikev2</b> <b>or</b> <b>-2</b>
              Use IKE version 2 This causes the outgoing packets to use IKEv2 format  as  defined  in  RFC  4306
              instead  of  the  default  IKEv1  format. Any packets returned are automatically decoded as IKE or
              IKEv2 depending on their payloads irrespective of this option.  The --ikev2  option  is  currently
              experimental.  It  has  not  been  extensively  tested,  and  it only supports sending the default
              proposal.
