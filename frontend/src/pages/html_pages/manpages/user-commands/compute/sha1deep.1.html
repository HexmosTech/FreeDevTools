       <b>md5deep</b> -v | -V | -h
       <b>md5deep</b>  [-m|-M|-x|-X &lt;file&gt;]  [-a|-A &lt;hash&gt;] [-f &lt;file&gt;] [-p &lt;size&gt;] [-i &lt;size&gt;] [-tnwzresS0lbkqZud] [-F
       &lt;bum&gt;] [-o &lt;fbcplsde&gt;]  [-j &lt;num&gt;] [[<b>FILES</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Computes the hashes, or message digest, for any number of  files  while  optionally  recursively  digging
       through the directory structure.  Can also take a list of known hashes and display the filenames of input
       files  whose  hashes  either do or do not match any of the known hashes.  Errors are reported to standard
       error. If no FILES are specified, reads from standard input.

       <b>-p</b> <b>&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Piecewise mode. Breaks files into chunks before  hashing.   Chunks  may  be  specified  using  IEC
              multipliers  b,  k,  m,  g, t, p, or e.  (Never let it be said that the author didn't plan ahead!)
              This mode cannot be used with the -z mode.

       <b>-i|-I</b> <b>&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Size threshold mode. Only hash files smaller than the given the  threshold.  In  -i  mode,  simply
              omits  those  files  larger than the threshold. In -I mode, displays all files, but uses asterisks
              for the hashes of files larger than the threshold.  Sizes may be specified using  IEC  multipliers
              b, k, m, g, t, p, or e.

       <b>-r</b>     Enables  recursive  mode. All subdirectories are traversed. Please note that recursive mode cannot
              be used to examine all files of a given file extension. For example, calling md5deep -r *.txt will
              examine all files in <u>directories</u> that end in .txt.

       <b>-e</b>     Displays a progress indicator and estimate of time remaining for each file being  processed.  Time
              estimates  for  files larger than 4GB are not available on Windows. This mode may not be used with
              th -p mode.

       <b>-m</b> &lt;file&gt;
              Enables matching mode. The file given should be a list of  known  hashes.   The  input  files  are
              examined  one at a time, and only those files that match the list of known hashes are output. This
              flag may be used more than once to add multiple sets of known hashes. Acceptable formats for lists
              of known hashes are plain (such as those generated by md5deep or md5sum), Hashkeeper files, iLook,
              and the National Software Reference Library (NSRL) as  produced  by  the  National  Institute  for
              Standards in Technology.
                If  standard  input  is  used with the -m flag, displays "stdin" if the input matches one of the
              hashes in the list of known hashes. If the hash does not match, the program displays no output.
               This flag may not be used in conjunction with the -x, -X, or -A flags.  See the section  "UNICODE
              SUPPORT" below.

       <b>-x</b> &lt;file&gt;
              Same  as  the -m flag above, but does negative matching. That is, only those files NOT in the list
              of known hashes are displayed.
               This flag may not be used in conjunction with the -m, -M, or -a flags.  See the section  "UNICODE
              SUPPORT" below.

       <b>-M</b> and <b>-X</b> &lt;file&gt;
              Same  as  -m  and  -x above, but displays the hash for each file that does (or does not) match the
              list of known hashes.

       <b>-a</b> &lt;hash&gt;
              Adds a single hash to the list of known hashes used for matching mode, and if not already enabled,
              enables matching mode. Adding single hashes cannot, by itself, be used  to  print  the  hashes  of
              matching  files  like  the  -M  flag does. When used in conjunction with the -w flag, the filename
              displayed is just the hash submitted on the command line.
               This flag may not be used in conjunction with the -x, -X, or -A flags.

       <b>-A</b> &lt;hash&gt;
              Same as -a above, but does negative matching.  This flag may not be used in conjunction  with  the
              -m, -M, or -A flags.

       <b>-f</b> &lt;file&gt;
              Takes a list of files to be hashed from the specified file. Each line is assumed to be a filename.
              This  flag  can  only be used once per invocation. If it's used a second time, the second instance
              will clobber the first.
              Note that you can still use other flags, such as the -m or -x modes, and submit  additional  FILES
              on the command line.

       <b>-w</b>     During  any  of  the matching modes (-m,-M,-x,or -X), displays the filename of the known hash that
              matched the input file.  See the section "UNICODE SUPPORT" below.

       <b>-t</b>     Display a timestamp in GMT with each result. On Windows this timestamp will be the file's creation
              time. On all other systems it should be the file's change time.

       <b>-n</b>     During any of the matching modes (-m,-M,-x,or -X), displays only the filenames of any known hashes
              that were not matched by any of the input files.

       <b>-s</b>     Enables silent mode. All error messages are suppressed.

       <b>-S</b>     Like silent mode, but still displays warnings on improperly formatted hashes in the list of  known
              hashes.

       <b>-z</b>     Enables file size mode. Prepends the hash with a ten digit representation of the size of each file
              processed.  If  the  file size is greater than 9999999999 bytes (about 9.3GB) the program displays
              9999999999 for the size.

       <b>-q</b>     Quiet mode. File names are omitted from the output. Each hash is  still  followed  by  two  spaces
              before the newline.

       <b>-Z</b>     Produces  output  in Triage format. Each line contains the file's size, a tab, a hash of the first
              512 bytes, a tab, the hash of the complete file, a tab, and  the  file  name.   These  values  are
              intended  in  increasing  order  of  specificity.  That  is, two files with different sizes cannot
              possibly match. This is a fast comparison and should be done first. Next, two files with different
              partial hashes cannot possibly match. This is often faster than hashing the whole  file.  Finally,
              if those two pieces align, then it's worth reading and hashing the entire file.

       <b>-0</b>     Uses  a  NULL  character  (/0) to terminate each line instead of a newline.  Useful for processing
              filenames with strange characters.

       <b>-l</b>     Enables relative file paths. Instead of printing the absolute path for  each  file,  displays  the
              relative file path as indicated on the command line. This flag may not be used in conjunction with
              the -b flag.

       <b>-b</b>     Enables  bare  mode. Strips any leading directory information from displayed filenames.  This flag
              may not be used in conjunction with the -l flag.

       <b>-k</b>     Enables asterisk mode. An asterisk is inserted in lieu of a second space between the filename  and
              the hash, just like md5sum in its binary (-b) mode.

       <b>-c</b>     Enables  comma separated values output, or CSV mode. This mode has the side effect of removing the
              10 digit size limitation from -z mode.  Also note that asterisks from -k mode  are  not  displayed
              when in CSV mode.

       <b>-o</b> &lt;bcpflsd&gt;
              Enables  expert mode. Allows the user specify which (and only which) types of files are processed.
              Directory processing is still controlled with the -r flag. The expert mode options allowed are:
              f - Regular files
              b - Block Devices
              c - Character Devices
              p - Named Pipes
              l - Symbolic Links
              s - Sockets
              d - Solaris Doors
              e - Windows PE executables

       <b>-jnn</b>   Controls multi-threading. By default the program will create one producer thread to scan the  file
              system  and one hashing thread per CPU core. Multi-threading causes output filenames to be in non-
              deterministic order, as files that take longer to hash will be delayed while they are hashed. If a
              deterministic order is required, specify <b>-j0</b> to disable multi-threading

       <b>-d</b>     Output in Digital Forensics XML (DFXML) format.

       <b>-u</b>     Quote Unicode output. For example, the snowman is shown as <b>U+C426</b>.

       <b>-F&lt;bum&gt;</b>
              Specifies the input mode that is used to read files. The default is <b>-Fb</b> (buffered I/O) which reads
              files with fopen(). Specifying <b>-Fu</b> will  use  unbuffered  I/O  and  read  the  file  with  open().
              Specifying  <b>-Fm</b>  will  use  memory-mapped  I/O  which  will be faster on some platforms, but which
              (currently) will not work with files that produce I/O errors.

       <b>-h</b>     Show a help screen and exit.

       <b>-v</b>     Show the version number and exit.

       <b>-V</b>     Show copyright information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>UNICODE</b> <b>SUPPORT</b></h4><pre>
       As of version 3.0 the program supports Unicode characters in filenames on Microsoft Windows  systems  for
       filenames  specified on the command line with globbing (e.g. *), for files specified with the <b>-f</b> of files
       to hash, and for files read from directories using the <b>-r</b> option.

       By default all program input and output should be in UTF-8.  The program automatically converts  this  to
       UTF-16 for opening files).

       On  Unix/Linux/MacOS,  you  should  use  a  terminal emulator that supports UTF-8 and UTF-8 characters in
       filenames will be properly displayed.

       On Windows, the programs do not display Unicode characters on the  console.   You  must  either  redirect
       output  to  a file and open the file with Wordpad (which can display Unicode), or you must specify the <b>-u</b>
       option to quote Unicode using standard <b>U+XXXX</b> notation.

       Currently the file name of a file containing known hashes may not be specified as a unicode filename, but
       you can specify the name using tab completion or an asterisk (e.g. md5deep -m *.txt where there  is  only
       one file with a .txt extension).

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       Returns a bit-wise value based on the success of the operation and the status of any matching operations.

       0      Success.  Note  that  the program considers itself successful even when it encounters read errors,
              permission denied errors, or finds directories when not in recursive mode.

       1      Unused hashes. Under any of the matching modes, returns this value if one or  more  of  the  known
              hashes was not matched by any of the input files.

       2      Unmatched  inputs. Under any of the matching modes, returns this value if one or more of the input
              values did not match any of the known hashes.

       64     User error, such as trying to do both positive and negative matching at the same time.

       128    Internal error, such as memory corruption or  uncaught  cycle.   All  internal  errors  should  be
              reported to the developer! See the section "Reporting Bugs" below.
