       murphi2c - translate a Murphi model to C for simulation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>murphi2c</b> <b>options</b> [<b>--output</b> <u>FILE</u>] [<u>FILE</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Murphi2C  is  a  utility bundled with the Rumur model checker. It can be used to translate a Murphi model
       into C source code for integration into a simulator.  The translation is intended  to  match  the  user's
       intuition of the C equivalent of their Murphi model. That is, the produced code is more readable and less
       micro-optimised than the model checking code produced by Rumur itself.

       The  C  translation  produced  by  Murphi2C  is  only  an approximation of the original Murphi model. For
       example, there is no equivalent of the "undefined" value in  C.   If  the  input  model  relies  on  such
       details,  the  translation will not precisely match the model. Similarly the type compatibility rules for
       Murphi and C differ, so models that use aliases or rely on type equivalence may cause Murphi2C to produce
       C code that does not compile. For such models, Murphi2C is only intended to generate an initial  skeleton
       for a C translation. You should always inspect the output C code to confirm it matches your expectations.

       See <b><a href="../man1/rumur.1.html">rumur</a>(1)</b> for more information about Rumur or Murphi.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--header</b>
              Generate a C header, as opposed to a source file.

       <b>--output</b> <u>FILE</u> or <b>-o</b> <u>FILE</u>
              Set path to write the generated C code to. Without this option, code is written to stdout.

       <b>--source</b>
              Generate a C source file, as opposed to a header. This is the default.

       <b>--value-type</b> <u>TYPE</u>
              Change  the  C  type used to represent scalar values in the emitted code. By default, <u>int</u> is used.
              Murphi2C does not validate that the type you specify is a valid C type, but simply trusts that you
              have given something that will be available when you compile the generated code.

       <b>--version</b>
              Display version information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The generated C code exposes a set of function pointers that can be overwritten by other code to  control
       the behaviour of certain events:

              // Called when a model assertion is violated. The default implementation prints
              // the message and then calls exit().
              void (*failed_assertion)(const char *message);

              // Called when a model assumption is violated. The default implementation prints
              // the message and then calls exit().
              void (*failed_assumption)(const char *message);

              // Called when an error statement is reached. The default implementation prints
              // the message and then calls exit().
              void (*error)(const char *message);

              // Called when a cover condition is hit. The default implementation does
              // nothing.  void (*cover)(const char *message);

              // Called when a liveness condition is hit. The default implementation does
              // nothing.
              void (*liveness)(const char *message);

       Murphi  records  are  translated  into  C  structs  that use native, platform-dependent member layout. An
       exception to this is if the input model performs aggregate comparisons of  record  or  array  expressions
       (using   <b>==</b>   or   <b>!=</b>).   If   this   is   the   case,   the  produced  structs  will  be  packed  (using
       <b>__attribute__((packed))</b>) to ensure they can be compared with <b>memcmp</b>.
