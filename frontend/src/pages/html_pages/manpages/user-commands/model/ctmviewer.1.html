</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ctmviewer</b> - 3D viewer for models of various file formats

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ctmviewer</b> <u>[modelfile</u> <u>[texturefile]]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ctmviewer</b> is a 3D file viewer that can load, show and save 3D model files in several different formats.

       The  program displays an interactive 3D view of the model, which can be operated with the mouse (e.g. for
       rotating and zooming).

       If the selected model file contains texture coordinate information, it is possible to  specify  which  2D
       image  file  to  use  as  a texture with the additional <u>texturefile</u> argument. If no texture file is given
       (either by the 3D model file, or by the <u>texturefile</u> argument), a standard 2D grid is used as a texture.

</pre><h4><b>GUI</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In addition to the command line arguments, <b>ctmviewer</b> offers several operations that can be performed from
       the 3D GUI display. For help, press the F1 key.

   <b>Loading</b> <b>and</b> <b>Saving</b>
       It is possible to load and save 3D model files from the program by either using the buttons in the  upper
       left corner of the 3D display, or by using the keyboard shortcuts CTRL+O (open) and CTRL+S (save).

       It is also possible to load a texture file from the program by using the Open Texture button.

   <b>Rendering</b>
       To toggle between a normal filled surface view (default) and a wire frame view, press the 'w' key.

   <b>Camera</b> <b>Control</b>
       By holding down the left mouse button and moving the mouse, the camera is rotated around the 3D model.

       By holding down the right mouse button and moving the mouse, the camera will pan left/right and up/down.

       By holding down the middle mouse button and moving the mouse, the camera will zoom in and out. It is also
       possible to use the mouse wheel (not supported on all systems) or the +/- keys to zoom in and out.

       Double click the left mouse button on a point on the model to focus the camera on that point.

       Press the 'f' key to fit the model into the screen view (re-center and re-zoom).

       Press  the  'y'  key  to  change the camera up direction to the Y axis (may be necessary if the model was
       designed in or for an environment where the Y axis is considered the up direction).

       Press the 'z' key to change the camera up direction to the Z axis (default).

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       The following 3D model file formats are supported:  OpenCTM  (.ctm),  Stanford  triangle  format  (.ply),
       Stereolitography  (.stl),  3D  Studio  (.3ds),  COLLADA  1.4/1.5  (.dae), Wavefront geometry file (.obj),
       LightWave object (.lwo), Geomview object file format (.off), VRML 2.0 - export only (.wrl).

       The following 2D image file formats are supported (texture): JPEG (.jpg), PNG (.png).

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABILITY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ctmviewer</b> is designed to be portable, and is available for several different systems, including (but  not
       limited to): Windows, Mac OS X (10.3+), Linux and OpenSolaris.

       <b>ctmviewer</b>  uses  OpenGL  for  its  accelerated  3D  display.  When the OpenGL implementation supports it,
       <b>ctmviewer</b> will use per pixel Phong shading for improved visual appearance. Otherwise <b>ctmviewer</b> will  fall
       back to classic per vertex shading.
