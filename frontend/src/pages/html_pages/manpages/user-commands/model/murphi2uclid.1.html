</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       murphi2uclid - translate a Murphi model to Uclid5

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>murphi2uclid</b> [<b>--output</b> <u>FILE</u> | <b>-o</b> <u>FILE</u>] <u>FILE</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  utility  <b>murphi2uclid</b>  is bundled with the model checker Rumur and can be used to translate a Murphi
       model into a Uclid5 model. See <b><a href="../man1/rumur.1.html">rumur</a>(1)</b> for more information about Rumur or Murphi.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--help</b> or <b>-?</b>
              Display usage information.

       <b>--module</b> <u>NAME</u> or <b>-m</b> <u>NAME</u>
              Set the name to use for the generated Uclid5 module. If you do not supply  this,  it  defaults  to
              <b>main</b>.

       <b>--numeric-type</b> <u>TYPE</u>R or <b>-n</b> <u>TYPE</u>
              Set  the  Uclid5 type used for ranges, scalarsets and numeric literals. This can be either <u>integer</u>
              or a bit-vector type, for example, <u>bv8</u>. If this option is  omitted,  either  <u>integer</u>  or  <u>bv64</u>  is
              chosen automatically based on the content of the input model.

       <b>--output</b> <u>FILE</u> or <b>-o</b> <u>FILE</u>
              Set  the  path to write the output Uclid5 model to. If this argument is omitted, output is written
              to standard out.

       <b>--quiet</b> or <b>-q</b>
              Silence warning diagnostics.

       <b>--verbose</b> <b>or</b> <b>-v</b>
              Report extra debugging information.

       <b>--version</b>
              Display version information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Translation to Uclid5 is imprecise in the case where there is no direct Uclid5 equivalent  for  a  Murphi
       concept.  For example, an <b>undefine</b> statement in Murphi has no equivalent in Uclid5. This is translated to
       a <b>havoc</b> statement. Obviously this is not exactly equivalent. However the  hope  is  that  in  real  world
       models  this achieves a similar effect. Namely, any read of an undefined variable results in the verifier
       exploring unintended behavior. To get reasonable utility out of translation of a  model  using  <b>undefine</b>,
       you will likely need an assertion-heavy model. Or, put another way, defensive programming is advised.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following Murphi concepts have no translation to Uclid5 and are rejected by murphi2uclid:

              • Aliases, in the form of declarations statements or rules

              • The <b>isundefined</b> operator

              • The modulo operator, <b>%</b>

              • The left and shift shift operators, <b>&lt;&lt;</b> and <b>&gt;&gt;</b>

              • Early return statements, with or without an expression

              • Cover properties

              • Liveness properties inside rulesets

              • Cover and liveness statements

              • A <b>clear</b> statement with a value of complex type as its argument

              • Step sizes other than 1 in <b>exists</b> or <b>forall</b> expressions

       Function calls within expressions are translated as if they were calls to uninterpreted functions. Uclid5
       does  not  support  calling  interpreted  functions  (procedures,  in  Uclid5  terminology) this way. The
       desirable  mapping  (uninterpreted  function  vs  rephrasing  the  call  site)   cannot   be   determined
       automatically.  So it is left to the user to tweak or post-process the output, as it will not be accepted
       by Uclid5 as-is.
