</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mt - control magnetic tape drive operation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mt</b> [-h] [-f device] operation [count] [arguments...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page documents the tape control program <b>mt</b>.  <b>mt</b> performs the given <u>operation</u>, which must be
       one of the tape operations listed below, on a tape drive. The commands can also be listed by running  the
       program with the <u>-h</u> option.

       Some  operations optionally take an argument or repeat count, which can be given after the operation name
       and defaults to 1. The postfix <u>k</u> , <u>M</u> , or <u>G</u> can be used to give counts in units of 1024, 1024 * 1024,  or
       1024 * 1024 * 1024, respectively.

       The  available  operations  are listed below.  Unique abbreviations are accepted.  Not all operations are
       available on all systems, or work on all types of tape drives.

       fsf    Forward space <u>count</u> files.  The tape is positioned on the first block of the next file.

       fsfm   Forward space <u>count</u> files, then backward space one record. This leaves the tape positioned at  the
              last block of the file that is count - 1 files past the current file.

       bsf    Backward space <u>count</u> files.  The tape is positioned on the last block of the previous file.

       bsfm   Backward  space <u>count</u> files, then forward space one record. This leaves the tape positioned at the
              first block of the file that is count - 1 files before the current file.

       asf    The tape is positioned at the beginning of the <u>count</u> file. Positioning is done by first  rewinding
              the tape and then spacing forward over <u>count</u> filemarks.

       fsr    Forward space <u>count</u> records.

       bsr    Backward space <u>count</u> records.

       fss    (SCSI tapes) Forward space <u>count</u> setmarks.

       bss    (SCSI tapes) Backward space <u>count</u> setmarks.

       eod, seod
              Space  to  end  of  valid data.  Used on streamer tape drives to append data to the logical end of
              tape.

       rewind Rewind the tape.

       offline, rewoffl, eject
              Rewind the tape and, if applicable, unload the tape.

       retension
              Rewind the tape, then wind it to the end of the reel, then rewind it again.

       weof, eof
              Write <u>count</u> EOF marks at current position.

       wset   (SCSI tapes) Write <u>count</u> setmarks at current position (only SCSI tape).

       erase  Erase the tape. Note that this is a long erase, which on modern  (high-capacity)  tapes  can  take
              many hours, and which usually can't be aborted.

       status Print  status  information  about  the  tape unit. (If the density code is "no translation" in the
              status output, this does not affect working of the tape drive.)

       seek   (SCSI tapes) Seek to the <u>count</u> block on the tape.  This operation is available  on  some  Tandberg
              and  Wangtek  streamers  and  some SCSI-2 tape drives. The block address should be obtained from a
              <u>tell</u> call earlier.

       tell   (SCSI tapes) Tell the current block on tape.  This operation is available  on  some  Tandberg  and
              Wangtek streamers and some SCSI-2 tape drives.

       setpartition
              (SCSI  tapes) Switch to the partition determined by <u>count.</u>  The default data partition of the tape
              is numbered zero. Switching partition is available only if enabled  for  the  device,  the  device
              supports multiple partitions, and the tape is formatted with multiple partitions.

       partseek
              (SCSI  tapes) The tape position is set to block <u>count</u> in the partition given by the argument after
              count. The default partition is zero.

       mkpartition
              (SCSI tapes) Format the tape with one (count is zero) or two partitions (count gives the  size  of
              the  second  partition in megabytes). If the count is positive, it specifies the size of partition
              1. From kernel version 4.6, if the count is negative, it specifies the size of partition  0.  With
              older  kernels,  a  negative  argument formats the tape with one partition. The tape drive must be
              able to format partitioned tapes with initiator-specified partition  size  and  partition  support
              must be enabled for the drive.

       load   (SCSI  tapes) Send the load command to the tape drive. The drives usually load the tape when a new
              cartridge is inserted. The argument <u>count</u> can usually be omitted. Some HP changers load tape n  if
              the <u>count</u> 10000 + n is given (a special function in the Linux st driver).

       lock   (SCSI tapes) Lock the tape drive door.

       unlock (SCSI tapes) Unlock the tape drive door.

       setblk (SCSI tapes) Set the block size of the drive to <u>count</u> bytes per record.

       setdensity
              (SCSI  tapes)  Set the tape density code to <u>count.</u>  The proper codes to use with each drive should
              be looked up from the drive documentation.

       densities
              (SCSI tapes) Write explanation of some common density codes to standard output.

       drvbuffer
              (SCSI tapes) Set the tape drive buffer code to <u>number.</u>  The proper value for unbuffered  operation
              is  zero  and  "normal"  buffered  operation one. The meanings of other values can be found in the
              drive documentation or, in the case of a SCSI-2 drive, from the SCSI-2 standard.

       compression
              (SCSI tapes) The compression within the drive can be switched on or off  using  the  MTCOMPRESSION
              ioctl.  Note  that  this  method  is  not  supported  by  all drives implementing compression. For
              instance, the Exabyte 8 mm drives use density codes to select compression.

       stoptions
              (SCSI tapes) Set the driver options bits for the device to the defined values.  Allowed  only  for
              the   superuser.   The   bits  can  be  set  either  by  ORing  the  option  bits  from  the  file
              <a href="file:/usr/include/linux/mtio.h">/usr/include/linux/mtio.h</a> to <u>count,</u> or by using the following keywords (as many  keywords  can  be
              used on the same line as necessary, unambiguous abbreviations allowed):

              buffer-writes  buffered writes enabled

              async-writes   asynchronous writes enabled

              read-ahead     read-ahead for fixed block size

              debug          debugging (if compiled into driver)

              two-fms        write two filemarks when file closed

              fast-eod       space directly to eod (and lose file number)

              no-wait        don't wait until rewind, etc. complete

              weof-no-wait   don't wait until writing filemarks completes

              auto-lock      automatically lock/unlock drive door

              def-writes     the block size and density are for writes

              can-bsr        drive can space backwards as well

              no-blklimits   drive doesn't support read block limits

              can-partitions drive can handle partitioned tapes

              scsi2logical   seek  and  tell  use  SCSI-2  logical  block  addresses instead of device dependent
                             addresses

              sili           Set the SILI bit is when reading in variable block mode. This may speed up  reading
                             blocks  shorter than the read byte count. Set this option only if you know that the
                             drive supports SILI and the HBA reliably returns  transfer  residual  byte  counts.
                             Requires kernel version &gt;= 2.6.26.

              sysv           enable the System V semantics

       stsetoptions
              (SCSI  tapes)  Set selected driver options bits.  The methods to specify the bits to set are given
              above in the description of <b>stoptions.</b>  Allowed only for the superuser.

       stclearoptions
              (SCSI tapes) Clear selected driver option bits.  The methods to specify  the  bits  to  clear  are
              given above in description of <b>stoptions.</b>  Allowed only for the superuser.

       stshowoptions
              (SCSI tapes) Print the currently enabled options for the device. Requires kernel version &gt;= 2.6.26
              and sysfs must be mounted at /sys.

       stwrthreshold
              (SCSI  tapes) The write threshold for the tape device is set to <u>count</u> kilobytes. The value must be
              smaller than or equal to the driver buffer size. Allowed only for the superuser.

       defblksize
              (SCSI tapes) Set the default block size of the device to <u>count</u> bytes. The value  -1  disables  the
              default  block  size.   The  block  size  set  by <u>setblk</u> overrides the default until a new tape is
              inserted.  Allowed only for the superuser.

       defdensity
              (SCSI tapes) Set the default density code. The value -1 disables the default density. The  density
              set  by  <u>setdensity</u>  overrides  the  default  until  a  new tape is inserted. Allowed only for the
              superuser.

       defdrvbuffer
              (SCSI tapes) Set the default drive buffer code. The value -1 disables  the  default  drive  buffer
              code.  The  drive buffer code set by <u>drvbuffer</u> overrides the default until a new tape is inserted.
              Allowed only for the superuser.

       defcompression
              (SCSI tapes) Set the default compression state. The value -1 disables the default compression. The
              compression state set by <u>compression</u> overrides the default until a new tape is  inserted.  Allowed
              only for the superuser.

       sttimeout
              sets  the  normal  timeout  for  the  device.  The value is given in seconds. Allowed only for the
              superuser.

       stlongtimeout
              sets the long timeout for the device. The  value  is  given  in  seconds.  Allowed  only  for  the
              superuser.

       stsetcln
              set the cleaning request interpretation parameters.

       <b>mt</b>  exits  with  a  status  of  0 if the operation succeeded, 1 if the operation or device name given was
       invalid, or 2 if the operation failed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Print version of mt.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>-t</b> The path of the tape device on  which to operate.  If neither of those options is given,  and  the
              environment  variable  <b>TAPE</b>  is  set, it is used.  Otherwise, a default device defined in the file
              <u>/usr/include/sys/mtio.h</u> is used (note that the actual path to <u>mtio.h</u>  can  vary  per  architecture
              and/or distribution).

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  argument  of  mkpartition specifies the size of the partition in megabytes. If you add a postfix, it
       applies to this definition. For example, argument 1G means 1 giga megabytes, which probably is  not  what
       the user is anticipating.
