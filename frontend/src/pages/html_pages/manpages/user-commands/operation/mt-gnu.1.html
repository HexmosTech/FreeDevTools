</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mt - control magnetic tape drive operation

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mt</b> [<b>-V</b>] [<b>-f</b> <u>device</u>] [<b>--file=</b><u>device</u>] [<b>--rsh-command=</b><u>command</u>] [<b>--version</b>] <u>operation</u> [<u>count</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual page documents the GNU version of <b>mt</b>.  <b>mt</b> performs the given <u>operation</u>, which must be one of
       the tape operations listed below, on a tape drive.

       The default tape device to operate on is taken from the file <b>/usr/include/sys/mtio.h</b> when <b>mt</b> is compiled.
       It can be overridden by giving a device file name in the environment variable <b>TAPE</b> or by a  command  line
       option (see below), which also overrides the environment variable.

       The  device  must  be  either  a  character  special file or a remote tape drive.  To use a tape drive on
       another machine as the archive, use a filename  that  starts  with  `HOSTNAME:'.   The  hostname  can  be
       preceded by a username and an `@' to access the remote tape drive as that user, if you have permission to
       do so (typically an entry in that user's `<a href="file:~/.rhosts">~/.rhosts</a>' file).

       The  available  operations  are listed below.  Unique abbreviations are accepted.  Not all operations are
       available on all systems, or work on all types of tape drives.  Some operations optionally take a  repeat
       count, which can be given after the operation name and defaults to 1.

       <b>eof</b>, <b>weof</b>
              Write <u>count</u> EOF marks at current position.

       <b>fsf</b>    Forward space <u>count</u> files.  The tape is positioned on the first block of the next file.

       <b>bsf</b>    Backward space <u>count</u> files.  The tape is positioned on the first block of the next file.

       <b>fsr</b>    Forward space <u>count</u> records.

       <b>bsr</b>    Backward space <u>count</u> records.

       <b>bsfm</b>   Backward  space <u>count</u> file marks.  The tape is positioned on the beginning-of-the-tape side of the
              file mark.

       <b>fsfm</b>   Forward space <u>count</u> file marks.  The tape is positioned on the beginning-of-the-tape side  of  the
              file mark.

       <b>asf</b>    Absolute space to file number <u>count</u>.  Equivalent to rewind followed by fsf <u>count</u>.

       <b>seek</b>   Seek to block number <u>count</u>.

       <b>eom</b>    Space to the end of the recorded media on the tape (for appending files onto tapes).

       <b>rewind</b> Rewind the tape.

       <b>offline</b>, <b>rewoffl</b>
              Rewind the tape and, if applicable, unload the tape.

       <b>status</b> Print status information about the tape unit.

       <b>retension</b>
              Rewind the tape, then wind it to the end of the reel, then rewind it again.

       <b>erase</b>  Perform  long  erase  of  tape.  If  <u>count</u>  is 0, perform short erase of tape (some devices do not
              support this).

       <b>mt</b> exits with a status of 0 if the operation succeeded, 1 if the  operation  or  device  name  given  was
       invalid, or 2 if the operation failed.

   <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>-f</b>, <b>--file=</b><u>device</u>
              Use  <u>device</u>  as  the  file  name  of the tape drive to operate on.  To use a tape drive on another
              machine, use a filename that starts with `HOSTNAME:'.  The hostname can be preceded by a  username
              and  an  `@'  to  access  the  remote  tape  drive  as  that user, if you have permission to do so
              (typically an entry in that user's `<a href="file:~/.rhosts">~/.rhosts</a>' file).

       <b>--rsh-command=</b><u>command</u>
              Notifies <b>mt</b> that it should use <u>command</u> to communicate with remote devices instead of  <b><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?ssh">/usr/bin/ssh</a></b>
              or <b>/usr/bin/rsh</b>.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
              Print the version number of <b>mt</b>.
