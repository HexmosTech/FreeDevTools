</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       oz-customize - tool to automatically modify installed operating system files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>oz-customize</b> <b>[OPTIONS]</b> <b>&lt;tdl-file&gt;</b> <b>&lt;libvirt-xml-file&gt;</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a tool to modify already installed operating systems.  Modifications typically involve installing
       additional packages.  This program can be used as a counterpart to oz-install, though it does not have to
       be used in conjunction.

       Note  that  oz-customize does the actual customization using a combination of KVM and libvirt, so both of
       these must be available (and working) for oz-customize to have a chance to succeed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b> <b>&lt;config&gt;</b>
              Get the configuration from config file <b>config</b>, instead of the default /etc/oz/oz.cfg.  If  neither
              one  exists,  Oz  will  use  sensible defaults.  The config file is in standard ini format; for an
              explanation of the sections and keys, see the <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b> section.

       <b>-d</b> <b>&lt;loglevel&gt;</b>
              Turn on debugging output to level <b>loglevel</b>.  The log levels are:

              0 - errors only (this is the default)

              1 - errors and warnings

              2 - errors, warnings, and information

              3 - all messages

              4 - all messages, prepended with the level and classname

       <b>-h</b>     Print a short help message.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The Oz configuration file  is  in  standard  INI  format  with  several  sections.   If  any  section  or
       configuration  key  is  missing,  Oz will use a sensible default.  For true/false configuration keys, the
       values of "true", "True", "yes", or "Yes" can be used to turn the option on, and "false", "False",  "no",
       or "No" can be used to turn the behavior off.  The configuration file should have the following form:

           [paths]
           output_dir = /var/lib/libvirt/images
           data_dir = /var/lib/oz
           screenshot_dir = .
           sshprivkey = /etc/oz/id_rsa-icicle-gen

           [libvirt]
           uri = qemu:///system
           type = kvm
           bridge_name = virbr0
           cpus = 1
           memory = 1024
           image_type = raw

           [cache]
           original_media = yes
           modified_media = no
           jeos = no

           [icicle]
           safe_generation = no

       The  <b>paths</b>  section  defines  the  paths that Oz will use for storing data.  The <b>output_dir</b> key describes
       where to store the images after they are built, and the <b>data_dir</b> key describes  where  to  cache  install
       media  and  use  temporary storage.  Both locations must have a decent amount of free disk space in order
       for Oz to work properly.  The <b>screenshot_dir</b> key describes where to store screenshots of failed installs.
       The <b>sshprivkey</b> key describes where the ssh keys are stored, which are required by Oz to do  customization
       of the image.

       The  <b>libvirt</b>  section allows some manipulation of how Oz uses libvirt.  The <b>uri</b> key describes the libvirt
       URI to use to do the guest installation.  The <b>type</b> key defines what type of virtualization to  use.   The
       <b>bridge_name</b>  key  defines  which  bridge  Oz  should  place the guests that it launches on.  The <b>cpus</b> key
       defines how many cpus should be used inside the virtual machine.  The <b>memory</b> key defines how much  memory
       (in  megabytes)  should be used inside the virtual machine.  The <b>image_type</b> key defines which output disk
       type should be used; this can be any value that libvirt supports.

       The <b>cache</b> section allows some manipulation of how Oz caches data.   The  caching  of  data  in  Oz  is  a
       tradeoff  between  installation  time  and  storage  space.  The <b>original_media</b> key tells Oz to cache the
       original installation media so that it does not have to download it the next time an install for the same
       operating system is requested.  The <b>modified_media</b> key tells Oz to  cache  the  oz-modified  installation
       media  so that it does not have to download and modify it the next time an install for the same operating
       system is requested.  The <b>jeos</b> key tells Oz to cache the installed operating system  after  installation.
       This can significantly speed up subsequent installation of the same operating system, with the additional
       downside of the operating system getting out-of-date with respect to security updates.  Use with care.

       The  <b>icicle</b>  section  allows  some  manipulation  of how Oz generates ICICLE output.  ICICLE is a package
       manifest that can optionally be generated at the end  of  installs.   The  <b>safe_generation</b>  key  controls
       whether  Oz  uses  a  throwaway  overlay  file  while  generating  the ICICLE.  If it is set to "no" (the
       default), then Oz will boot up the guest at the end of the install and run the  appropriate  commands  to
       generate  the  ICICLE.  If it is set to "yes", then Oz will use a throwaway overlay file while generating
       the ICICLE.  After the ICICLE is generated, Oz will delete the backing file, leaving  the  original  disk
       image pristine.
