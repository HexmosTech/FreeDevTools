</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       biogenesis - Biogenesis, an artificial life program focused on evolution

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>biogenesis</b> [RANDOM_SEED]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  imitates  the  evolutionary  processes that happens on unicellular organism populations in
       nature. It has been tried to create an example of the elemental bacterial processes, simplifying  them  a
       lot  and  presenting them in a visual and comprehensible manner. Although it is not scientifically exact,
       regular mechanisms on bacterial evolution and life can be  observed  and  it  can  be  interesting  as  a
       didactic  approximation  to  concepts  like  mutation,  evolution  or  photosynthesis.  It is also a good
       entertainment.

       The organisms that will populate this world are not representations of natural unicellular organisms, but
       an abstraction has been used to be able to look more clearly at their virtual life. These  organisms  are
       formed  by  segments  of different colors and lengths. The organism's segments color and length establish
       its properties, so that we can know what can an organism  do  only  by  looking  at  it  on  the  screen.
       Moreover,  these  segments' configuration is a representation in the world of its genetic code, which its
       descendants will inherit in an identical form, with the exception of random mutations that can happen  in
       each generation.

       Organisms that obtain beneficial mutations will be the most successful ones, on the reproductive point of
       view, and will create a large number of descendants that will propagate its genes and its mutation in the
       future.  However,  those  that  suffer  from a less appropriate mutation will not take a long time to die
       without being able to extend their species' lives longer than their own lives.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       RANDOM_SEED
              This number determines the sequence of the random numbers that will be generated. This way  it  is
              possible to recreate several times the same scenario if the same number is introduced.

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b></h4><pre>
       This  program  has  a high CPU consumption. You need to set a few parameters in order to adapt it to your
       hardware.

       These are the parameters that you should configure. Remember that  you  can  do  this  by  selecting  the
       <b>Parameters</b> option under the <b>World</b> menu.

        *  <b>OpenGL</b>:  The use of the OpenGL libraries greatly increases program's speed. This option is deselected
       by default because it doesn't work on all hardware and drivers combinations. You should try to enable  it
       and restart the program. If it crashes or doesn't work, OpenGL will be disabled next time you run it.

        *  <b>Disable</b>  <b>fbobject</b>:  Due to a bug in some graphic drivers, it may be necessary to activate this option
       for the OpenGL to work. If the first time that you try to activate them they don't work, try to  activate
       them with this option.

        *  <b>Time</b>  <b>per</b>  <b>frame</b>:  This  parameter  controls  the  speed that the program will try to reach. If it is
       consuming a lot of CPU you should raise it, and if it is not and you want the process to execute  faster,
       you should lower it.

        *  <b>Initial</b>  <b>carbon</b>  <b>dioxide</b>:  The  CO2  is  the  limiting  factor to life expansion. More CO2 means more
       organisms will populate the world, and more CPU needed to calculate their moves and  draw  them.  If  you
       change  this  parameter,  it may be a good idea to change the world size accordingly to keep the same CO2
       concentration.
