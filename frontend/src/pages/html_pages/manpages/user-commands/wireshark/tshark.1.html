</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>TShark</b> is a network protocol analyzer. It lets you capture packet data from a live network, or read
       packets from a previously saved capture file, either printing a decoded form of those packets to the
       standard output or writing the packets to a file. <b>TShark</b>'s native capture file format is <b>pcapng</b> format,
       which is also the format used by <b>Wireshark</b> and various other tools.

       Without any options set, <b>TShark</b> will work much like <b>tcpdump</b>. It will use the pcap library to capture
       traffic from the first available network interface and displays a summary line on the standard output for
       each received packet.

       When run with the <b>-r</b> option, specifying a capture file from which to read, <b>TShark</b> will again work much
       like <b>tcpdump</b>, reading packets from the file and displaying a summary line on the standard output for each
       packet read. <b>TShark</b> is able to detect, read and write the same capture files that are supported by
       <b>Wireshark</b>. The input file doesn’t need a specific filename extension; the file format and an optional
       gzip, Zstandard, or LZ4 compression will be automatically detected. Near the beginning of the DESCRIPTION
       section of <a href="../man1/wireshark.1.html">wireshark</a>(1) or https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html is a detailed
       description of the way <b>Wireshark</b> handles this, which is the same way <b>TShark</b> handles this.

       Compressed file support uses (and therefore requires) the zlib library. If the zlib library is not
       present when compiling <b>TShark</b>, it will be possible to compile it, but the resulting program will be
       unable to read compressed files. Similarly, LZ4 and ZStandard also require their respective libraries.

       When displaying packets on the standard output, <b>TShark</b> writes, by default, a summary line containing the
       fields specified by the preferences file (which are also the fields displayed in the packet list pane in
       <b>Wireshark</b>), although if it’s writing packets as it captures them, rather than writing packets from a
       saved capture file, it won’t show the "frame number" field. If the <b>-V</b> option is specified, it instead
       writes a view of the details of the packet, showing all the fields of all protocols in the packet. If the
       <b>-O</b> option is specified, it will only show the full details for the protocols specified, and show only the
       top-level detail line for all other protocols. Use the output of "<b>tshark</b> <b>-G</b> <b>protocols</b>" to find the
       abbreviations of the protocols you can specify. If the <b>-P</b> option is specified with either the <b>-V</b> or <b>-O</b>
       options, both the summary line for the entire packet and the details will be displayed.

       Packet capturing is performed with the pcap library. That library supports specifying a filter
       expression; packets that don’t match that filter are discarded. The <b>-f</b> option is used to specify a
       capture filter. The syntax of a capture filter is defined by the pcap library; this syntax is different
       from the display filter syntax described below, and the filtering mechanism is limited in its abilities.

       Display filters in <b>TShark</b>, which allow you to select which packets are to be decoded or written to a
       file, are very powerful; more fields are filterable in <b>TShark</b> than in other protocol analyzers, and the
       syntax you can use to create your filters is richer. As <b>TShark</b> progresses, expect more and more protocol
       fields to be allowed in display filters. Display filters use the same syntax as display and color filters
       in <b>Wireshark</b>; a display filter is specified with the <b>-Y</b> option.

       Display filters can be specified when capturing or when reading from a capture file. Note that capture
       filters are much more efficient than display filters, and it may be more difficult for <b>TShark</b> to keep up
       with a busy network if a display filter is specified for a live capture, so you might be more likely to
       lose packets if you’re using a display filter.

       A capture or display filter can either be specified with the <b>-f</b> or <b>-Y</b> option, respectively, in which case
       the entire filter expression must be specified as a single argument (which means that if it contains
       spaces, it must be quoted), or can be specified with command-line arguments after the option arguments,
       in which case all the arguments after the filter arguments are treated as a filter expression. If the
       filter is specified with command-line arguments after the option arguments, it’s a capture filter if a
       capture is being done (i.e., if no <b>-r</b> option was specified) and a display filter if a capture file is
       being read (i.e., if a <b>-r</b> option was specified).

       If the <b>-w</b> option is specified when capturing packets or reading from a capture file, <b>TShark</b> does not
       display packets on the standard output. Instead, it writes the packets to a capture file with the name
       specified by the <b>-w</b> option. Note that display filters are currently not supported when capturing and
       saving the captured packets.

       If you want to write the decoded form of packets to a file, run <b>TShark</b> without the <b>-w</b> option, and
       redirect its standard output to the file (do <u>not</u> use the <b>-w</b> option).

       If you want the packets to be displayed to the standard output and also saved to a file, specify the <b>-P</b>
       option in addition to the <b>-w</b> option to have the summary line displayed, specify the <b>-V</b> option in addition
       to the <b>-w</b> option to have the details of the packet displayed, and specify the <b>-O</b> option, with a list of
       protocols, to have the full details of the specified protocols and the top-level detail line for all
       other protocols to be displayed. If the <b>-P</b> option is used together with the <b>-V</b> or <b>-O</b> option, the summary
       line will be displayed along with the detail lines.

       When writing packets to a file, <b>TShark</b>, by default, writes the file in <b>pcapng</b> format, and writes all of
       the packets it sees to the output file. The <b>-F</b> option can be used to specify the format in which to write
       the file. The list of available file formats is displayed by the <b>-F</b> option without a value. However, for
       a live capture, you can only specify a file format supported by <a href="../man1/dumpcap.1.html">dumpcap</a>(1), viz. <b>pcapng</b> or <b>pcap</b>. The
       <b>--compress</b> option can be used to specify a compression method as well; the list of supported compression
       methods for writing can be displayed by the <b>--compress</b> method without an argument. If the <b>--compress</b>
       option is not given, then the desired compression method, if any, is deduced from the extension of the
       filename given as argument to the <b>-w</b> option. Compression is not supported for live capture.

       When capturing packets, <b>TShark</b> writes to the standard error an initial line listing the interfaces from
       which packets are being captured and, if packet information isn’t being displayed to the terminal, writes
       a continuous count of packets captured to the standard output. If the <b>-q</b> option is specified, neither the
       continuous count nor the packet information will be displayed; instead, at the end of the capture, a
       count of packets captured will be displayed. If the <b>-Q</b> option is specified, neither the initial line, nor
       the packet information, nor any packet counts will be displayed. If the <b>-q</b> or <b>-Q</b> option is used, the <b>-P</b>,
       <b>-V</b>, or <b>-O</b> option can be used to cause the corresponding output to be displayed even though other output
       is suppressed.

       When reading packets, the <b>-q</b> and <b>-Q</b> option will suppress the display of the packet summary or details;
       this would be used if <b>-z</b> options are specified in order to display statistics, so that only the
       statistics, not the packet information, is displayed.

       The <b>-G</b> option is a special mode that simply causes <b>TShark</b> to dump one of several types of internal
       glossaries and then exit.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -2

           Perform a two-pass analysis. This causes <b>TShark</b> to buffer output until the entire first pass is done,
           but allows it to fill in fields that require future knowledge, such as 'response in frame #' fields.
           Also permits reassembly frame dependencies to be calculated correctly. This requires the ability to
           seek backwards on the input, and as such cannot be used with live captures or when reading from a
           pipe or FIFO.

       -a|--autostop  &lt;capture autostop condition&gt;

           Specify a criterion that specifies when <b>TShark</b> is to stop writing to a capture file. The criterion is
           of the form <u>test:value</u>, where <u>test</u> is one of:

           <b>duration</b>:<u>value</u> Stop writing to a capture file after <u>value</u> seconds have elapsed. Floating point values
           (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.

           <b>files</b>:<u>value</u> Stop writing to capture files after <u>value</u> number of files were written.

           <b>filesize</b>:<u>value</u> Stop writing to a capture file after it reaches a size of <u>value</u> kB. If this option is
           used together with the <b>-b</b> option, <b>TShark</b> will stop writing to the current capture file and switch to
           the next one if filesize is reached. When reading a capture file, <b>TShark</b> will stop reading the file
           after the number of bytes read exceeds this number (the complete packet  will be read, so more bytes
           than this number may be read). Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of 2 TB, although
           you might have problems before then if the number of packets exceeds exceeds 232 (4294967296).

           <b>packets</b>:<u>value</u> switch to the next file after it contains <u>value</u> packets. This does not include any
           packets that do not pass the display filter, so it may differ from <b>-c</b>&lt;capture packet count&gt;.

       -A  &lt;user&gt;:&lt;password&gt;

           Specify a user and a password when <b>TShark</b> captures from a rpcap:// interface where authentication is
           required.

           This option is available with libpcap with enabled remote support.

       -b|--ring-buffer  &lt;capture ring buffer option&gt;

           Cause <b>TShark</b> to run in "multiple files" mode. In "multiple files" mode, <b>TShark</b> will write to several
           capture files. When the first capture file fills up, <b>TShark</b> will switch writing to the next file and
           so on.

           The created filenames are based on the filename given with the <b>-w</b> option, the number of the file and
           on the creation date and time, e.g. outfile_00001_20250714120117.pcap,
           outfile_00002_20250714120523.pcap, ...

           With the <u>files</u> option it’s also possible to form a "ring buffer". This will fill up new files until
           the number of files specified, at which point <b>TShark</b> will discard the data in the first file and
           start writing to that file and so on. If the <u>files</u> option is not set, new files filled up until one
           of the capture stop conditions match (or until the disk is full).

           The criterion is of the form <u>key:value</u>, where <u>key</u> is one of:

           <b>duration</b>:<u>value</u> switch to the next file after <u>value</u> seconds have elapsed, even if the current file is
           not completely filled up. Floating point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.

           <b>files</b>:<u>value</u> begin again with the first file after <u>value</u> number of files were written (form a ring
           buffer). This value must be less than 100000. Caution should be used when using large numbers of
           files: some filesystems do not handle many files in a single directory well. The <b>files</b> criterion
           requires either <b>duration</b>, <b>interval</b> or <b>filesize</b> to be specified to control when to go to the next
           file. It should be noted that each <b>-b</b> parameter takes exactly one criterion; to specify two
           criterion, each must be preceded by the <b>-b</b> option.

           <b>filesize</b>:<u>value</u> switch to the next file after it reaches a size of <u>value</u> kB. Note that the filesize is
           limited to a maximum value of 2 TB, although you might have problems before then if the number of
           packets exceeds exceeds 232 (4294967296).

           <b>interval</b>:<u>value</u> switch to the next file when the time is an exact multiple of <u>value</u> seconds. For
           example, use 3600 to switch to a new file every hour on the hour.

           <b>packets</b>:<u>value</u> switch to the next file after it contains <u>value</u> packets.

           <b>printname</b>:<u>filename</u> print the name of the most recently written file to <u>filename</u> after the file is
           closed. <u>filename</u> can be stdout or - for standard output, or stderr for standard error.

           <b>nametimenum</b>:<u>value</u> Choose between two save filename templates. If <u>value</u> is 1, make running file number
           part before start time part; this is the original and default behaviour (e.g.
           log_00001_20250714164426.pcap). If <u>value</u> is greater than 1, make start time part before running
           number part (e.g. log_20210828164426_00001.pcap). The latter makes alphabetical sorting order equal
           to creation time order, and keeps related multiple file sets in same directory close to each other.

           Example: <b>tshark</b> <b>-b</b> <b>filesize:1000</b> <b>-b</b> <b>files:5</b> results in a ring buffer of five files of size one
           megabyte each.

       -B|--buffer-size  &lt;capture buffer size&gt;

           Set capture buffer size (in MiB, default is 2 MiB). This is used by the capture driver to buffer
           packet data until that data can be written to disk. If you encounter packet drops while capturing,
           try to increase this size. Note that, while <b>TShark</b> attempts to set the buffer size to 2 MiB by
           default, and can be told to set it to a larger value, the system or interface on which you’re
           capturing might silently limit the capture buffer size to a lower value or raise it to a higher
           value.

           This is available on UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, with
           libpcap 1.0.0 or later, and on Windows. It is not available on UNIX-compatible systems with earlier
           versions of libpcap.

           This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first occurrence of the <b>-i</b> option, it sets
           the default capture buffer size. If used after an <b>-i</b> option, it sets the capture buffer size for the
           interface specified by the last <b>-i</b> option occurring before this option. If the capture buffer size is
           not set specifically, the default capture buffer size is used instead.

       -c  &lt;capture packet count&gt;

           Set the maximum number of packets to read when capturing live data. If reading a capture file, set
           the maximum number of packets to read. This includes any packets that do not pass the display filter,
           so it may differ from <b>-a</b> <b>packets:</b>&lt;capture packet count&gt;.

       -C  &lt;configuration profile&gt;

           Run with the given configuration profile. If used in conjucton with --global-profile, then the global
           profile with the associated name would be used.

       -D|--list-interfaces

           Print a list of the interfaces on which <b>TShark</b> can capture, and exit. For each network interface, a
           number and an interface name, possibly followed by a text description of the interface, is printed.
           The interface name or the number can be supplied to the <b>-i</b> flag to specify an interface on which to
           capture. The number can be useful on Windows systems, where the interfaces have long names that
           usually contain a GUID.

       -e  &lt;field&gt;

           Add a field to the list of fields to display if <b>-T</b> <b>ek|fields|json|pdml</b> is selected. This option can
           be used multiple times on the command line. At least one field must be provided if the <b>-T</b> <b>fields</b>
           option is selected. Column types may be used prefixed with "_ws.col."

           Example: <b>tshark</b> <b>-T</b> <b>fields</b> <b>-e</b> <b>frame.number</b> <b>-e</b> <b>ip.addr</b> <b>-e</b> <b>udp</b> <b>-e</b> <b>_ws.col.info</b>

           Fields are separated by tab characters by default. <b>-E</b> controls the format of the printed fields.
           Giving a protocol rather than a single field will print the protocol summary (subtree label) from the
           packet details as a single field. If the protocol summary contains only the protocol name (e.g.
           "Hypertext Transfer Protocol") then the protocol filter name ("http") will be printed.

       -E  &lt;field print option&gt;

           Set an option controlling the printing of fields when <b>-T</b> <b>fields</b> is selected.

           Options are:

           <b>bom=y|n</b> If <b>y</b>, prepend output with the UTF-8 byte order mark (hexadecimal ef, bb, bf). Defaults to <b>n</b>.

           <b>header=y|n</b> If <b>y</b>, print a list of the field names given using <b>-e</b> as the first line of the output; the
           field name will be separated using the same character as the field values. Defaults to <b>n</b>.

           <b>separator=/t|/s|</b>&lt;character&gt; Set the separator character to use for fields. If <b>/t</b> tab will be used
           (this is the default), if <b>/s</b>, a single space will be used. Otherwise any character that can be
           accepted by the command line as part of the option may be used.

           <b>occurrence=f|l|a</b> Select which occurrence to use for fields that have multiple occurrences. If <b>f</b> the
           first occurrence will be used, if <b>l</b> the last occurrence will be used and if <b>a</b> all occurrences will be
           used (this is the default).

           <b>aggregator=,|/s|</b>&lt;character&gt; Set the aggregator character to use for fields that have multiple
           occurrences. If <b>,</b> a comma will be used (this is the default), if <b>/s</b>, a single space will be used.
           Otherwise any character that can be accepted by the command line as part of the option may be used.

           <b>quote=d|s|n</b> Set the quote character to use to surround fields. <b>d</b> uses double-quotes, <b>s</b> single-quotes,
           <b>n</b> no quotes (the default). If the quote character appears in a field value, it will be escaped by
           being duplicated.

           <b>escape=y|n</b> If <b>y</b>, the whitespace control characters (tab, line feed, carriage return, form feed, and
           vertical tab) backspace, and the backslash will be replaced in field values by C-style escapes, e.g.
           "\n" for line feed. If <b>n</b>, field value strings will be printed as-is. Defaults to <b>y</b>.

       -f  &lt;capture filter&gt;

           Set the capture filter expression.

           This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first occurrence of the <b>-i</b> option, it sets
           the default capture filter expression. If used after an <b>-i</b> option, it sets the capture filter
           expression for the interface specified by the last <b>-i</b> option occurring before this option. If the
           capture filter expression is not set specifically, the default capture filter expression is used if
           provided.

           Pre-defined capture filter names, as shown in the GUI menu item Capture→Capture Filters, can be used
           by prefixing the argument with "predef:". Example: <b>tshark</b> <b>-f</b> <b>"predef:MyPredefinedHostOnlyFilter"</b>

       -F  &lt;file format&gt;
           Set the file format of the output capture file written using the <b>-w</b> option. The output written with
           the <b>-w</b> option is raw packet data, not text, so there is no <b>-F</b> option to request text output. The
           option <b>-F</b> without a value will list the available formats. The default is the <b>pcapng</b> format (unless
           the default has been changed in preferences.) .

       -g
           This option causes the output file(s) to be created with group-read permission (meaning that the
           output file(s) can be read by other members of the calling user’s group).

       -G  [ &lt;report type&gt; ]

           The <b>-G</b> option will cause <b>TShark</b> to dump one of several types of glossaries and then exit. If no
           glossary type is specified, then the <b>fields</b> report will be generated by default; this is deprecated
           and a future version will require the report type argument. The <b>-G</b> option must be the first option
           given. Using the report type of <b>help</b> lists all the current report types.

           The available report types include:

           <b>column-formats</b> Dumps the column formats understood by <b>TShark</b>. There is one record per line. The
           fields are tab-delimited.

           Field 1
               format string (e.g. "%rD")

           Field 2
               text description of format string (e.g. "Dest port (resolved)")

           <b>currentprefs</b>  Dumps a copy of the current preferences file to stdout.

           <b>decodes</b> Dumps the "layer type"/"decode as" associations to stdout. There is one record per line. The
           fields are tab-delimited.

           Field 1
               layer type, e.g. "tcp.port"

           Field 2
               selector in decimal

           Field 3
               "decode as" name, e.g. "http"

           <b>defaultprefs</b>  Dumps a default preferences file to stdout.

           <b>dissectors</b>  Dumps a list of registered dissectors to stdout. There is one record per line. The fields
           are tab-delimited.

           Field 1
               dissector name

           Field 2
               dissector description

           <b>dissector-tables</b>  Dumps a list of dissector tables to stdout. There is one record per line. The

               False String

       -h|--help
           Print the version number and options and exit.

       -H  &lt;input hosts file&gt;

           Read a list of entries from a "hosts" file, which will then be written to a capture file. Implies <b>-W</b>
           <b>n</b>. Can be called multiple times.

           The "hosts" file format is documented at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file).

       -i|--interface  &lt;capture interface&gt; | -

           Set the name of the network interface or pipe to use for live packet capture.

           Network interface names should match one of the names listed in "<b>tshark</b> <b>-D</b>" (described above); a
           number, as reported by "<b>tshark</b> <b>-D</b>", can also be used.

           If no interface is specified, <b>TShark</b> searches the list of interfaces, choosing the first non-loopback
           interface if there are any non-loopback interfaces, and choosing the first loopback interface if
           there are no non-loopback interfaces. If there are no interfaces at all, <b>TShark</b> reports an error and
           doesn’t start the capture.

           Pipe names should be either the name of a FIFO (named pipe) or "-" to read data from the standard
           input. On Windows systems, pipe names must be of the form "\\.\pipe\<b>pipename</b>". Data read from pipes
           must be in standard pcapng or pcap format. Pcapng data must have the same endianness as the capturing
           host.

           "TCP@&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;" causes <b>TShark</b> to attempt to connect to the specified port on the specified host
           and read pcapng or pcap data.

           This option can occur multiple times. When capturing from multiple interfaces, the capture file will
           be saved in pcapng format.

       -I|--monitor-mode

           Put the interface in "monitor mode"; this is supported only on IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi interfaces, and
           supported only on some operating systems.

           Note that in monitor mode the adapter might disassociate from the network with which it’s associated,
           so that you will not be able to use any wireless networks with that adapter. This could prevent
           accessing files on a network server, or resolving host names or network addresses, if you are
           capturing in monitor mode and are not connected to another network with another adapter.

           This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first occurrence of the <b>-i</b> option, it
           enables the monitor mode for all interfaces. If used after an <b>-i</b> option, it enables the monitor mode
           for the interface specified by the last <b>-i</b> option occurring before this option.

       -j  &lt;protocol match filter&gt;

           Protocol match filter used for ek|json|jsonraw|pdml output file types. Only the protocol’s parent
           node is included. Child nodes are only included if explicitly specified in the filter.

           Example: <b>tshark</b> <b>-T</b> <b>json</b> <b>-j</b> <b>"ip</b> <b>ip.flags</b> <b>http"</b>

       -J  &lt;protocol match filter&gt;

           Protocol top level filter used for ek|json|jsonraw|pdml output file types. The protocol’s parent node
           and all child nodes are included. Lower-level protocols must be explicitly specified in the filter.

           Example: <b>tshark</b> <b>-T</b> <b>pdml</b> <b>-J</b> <b>"tcp</b> <b>http"</b>

       -l

           Flush the standard output after the information for each packet is printed. (This is not, strictly
           speaking, line-buffered if <b>-V</b> was specified; however, it is the same as line-buffered if <b>-V</b> wasn’t
           specified, as only one line is printed for each packet, and, as <b>-l</b> is normally used when piping a
           live capture to a program or script, so that output for a packet shows up as soon as the packet is
           seen and dissected, it should work just as well as true line-buffering. We do this as a workaround
           for a deficiency in the Microsoft Visual C++ C library.) This also sets <b>--update-interval</b> to 0 ms.

           This may be useful when piping the output of <b>TShark</b> to another program, as it means that the program
           to which the output is piped will see the dissected data for a packet as soon as <b>TShark</b> sees the
           packet and generates that output, rather than seeing it only when the standard output buffer
           containing that data fills up.

       -L|--list-data-link-types
           List the data link types supported by the interface and exit. The reported link types can be used for
           the <b>-y</b> option.

       -o  &lt;preference&gt;:&lt;value&gt;

           Set a preference value, overriding the default value and any value read from a preference file. The
           argument to the option is a string of the form <u>prefname:value</u>, where <u>prefname</u> is the name of the
           preference (which is the same name that would appear in the preference file), and <u>value</u> is the value
           to which it should be set.

       -O  &lt;protocols&gt;

           Similar to the <b>-V</b> option, but causes <b>TShark</b> to only show a detailed view of the comma-separated list
           of <u>protocols</u> specified, and show only the top-level detail line for all other protocols, rather than
           a detailed view of all protocols. Use the output of "<b>tshark</b> <b>-G</b> <b>protocols</b>" to find the abbreviations
           of the protocols you can specify.

       -p|--no-promiscuous-mode

           <u>Don’t</u> put the interface into promiscuous mode. Note that the interface might be in promiscuous mode
           for some other reason; hence, <b>-p</b> cannot be used to ensure that the only traffic that is captured is
           traffic sent to or from the machine on which <b>TShark</b> is running, broadcast traffic, and multicast
           traffic to addresses received by that machine.

           This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first occurrence of the <b>-i</b> option, no
           interface will be put into the promiscuous mode. If used after an <b>-i</b> option, the interface specified
           by the last <b>-i</b> option occurring before this option will not be put into the promiscuous mode.

       -P|--print

           Decode and display the packet summary or details, even if writing raw packet data using the <b>-w</b>
           option, and even if packet output is otherwise suppressed with <b>-Q</b>.

       -q

           When capturing packets, don’t display the continuous count of packets captured that is normally shown
           when saving a capture to a file; instead, just display, at the end of the capture, a count of packets
           captured. On systems that support the SIGINFO signal, such as various BSDs, you can cause the current
           count to be displayed by typing your "status" character (typically control-T, although it might be
           set to "disabled" by default on at least some BSDs, so you’d have to explicitly set it to use it).

           When reading a capture file, or when capturing and not saving to a file, don’t print packet
           information; this is useful if you’re using a <b>-z</b> option to calculate statistics and don’t want the
           packet information printed, just the statistics.

       -Q

           When capturing packets, don’t display, on the standard error, the initial message indicating on which
           interfaces the capture is being done, the continuous count of packets captured shown when saving a
           capture to a file, and the final message giving the count of packets captured. Only true errors are
           displayed on the standard error.

           This outputs less than the <b>-q</b> option, so the interface name and total packet count and the end of a
           capture are not sent to stderr.

           When reading a capture file, or when capturing and not saving to a file, don’t print packet
           information; this is useful if you’re using a <b>-z</b> option to calculate statistics and don’t want the
           packet information printed, just the statistics.

       -r|--read-file  &lt;infile&gt;

           Read packet data from <u>infile</u>, can be any supported capture file format (including compressed files).
           It is possible to use named pipes or stdin (-) here but only with certain capture file formats (in
           particular: those that can be read without seeking backwards.)

               <b>Tip</b>

               Reading a live capture from the standard out of another process through a pipe can circumvent
               restrictions that apply to <b>TShark</b> during live capture, such as file formats or compression.

       -R|--read-filter  &lt;Read filter&gt;

           Cause the specified filter (which uses the syntax of read/display filters, rather than that of
           capture filters) to be applied during the first pass of analysis. Packets not matching the filter are
           not considered for future passes. Only makes sense with multiple passes, see <b>-2</b>. For regular
           filtering on single-pass dissect see <b>-Y</b> instead.

           Note that forward-looking fields such as 'response in frame #' cannot be used with this filter, since
           they will not have been calculated when this filter is applied.

       -s|--snapshot-length  &lt;capture snaplen&gt;

           Set the default snapshot length to use when capturing live data. No more than <u>snaplen</u> bytes of each
           network packet will be read into memory, or saved to disk. A value of 0 specifies a snapshot length
           of 262144, so that the full packet is captured; this is the default.

           This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first occurrence of the <b>-i</b> option, it sets
           the default snapshot length. If used after an <b>-i</b> option, it sets the snapshot length for the
           interface specified by the last <b>-i</b> option occurring before this option. If the snapshot length is not
           set specifically, the default snapshot length is used if provided.

       -S  &lt;separator&gt;
           Set the line separator to be printed between packets.

       -T  ek|fields|json|jsonraw|pdml|ps|psml|tabs|text

           Set the format of the output when viewing decoded packet data. The options are one of:

           <b>ek</b> Newline delimited JSON format for bulk import into Elasticsearch. It can be used with <b>-j</b> or <b>-J</b> to
           specify which protocols to include or with <b>-x</b> to include raw hex-encoded packet data. If <b>-P</b> is
           specified it will print the packet summary only, with both <b>-P</b> and <b>-V</b> it will print the packet summary
           and packet details. If neither <b>-P</b> or <b>-V</b> are used it will print the packet details only. Example of
           usage to import data into Elasticsearch:

               tshark -T ek -j "http tcp ip" -P -V -x -r file.pcap &gt; file.json
               curl -H "Content-Type: application/x-ndjson" -XPOST <a href="http://elasticsearch">http://elasticsearch</a>:9200/_bulk --data-binary "@file.json"

           Elastic requires a mapping file to be loaded as template for packets-* index in order to convert
           Wireshark types to elastic types. This file can be auto-generated with the command "tshark -G
           elastic-mapping". Since the mapping file can be huge, protocols can be selected by using the option
           --elastic-mapping-filter:

               tshark -G elastic-mapping --elastic-mapping-filter ip,udp,dns

           <b>fields</b> The values of fields specified with the <b>-e</b> option, in a form specified by the <b>-E</b> option. For
           example,

               tshark -T fields -E separator=, -E quote=d

           would generate comma-separated values (CSV) output suitable for importing into your favorite
           spreadsheet program.

           <b>json</b> JSON file format. It can be used with <b>-j</b> or <b>-J</b> to specify which protocols to include or with <b>-x</b>
           option to include raw hex-encoded packet data. Example of usage:

               tshark -T json -r file.pcap
               tshark -T json -j "http tcp ip" -x -r file.pcap

           <b>jsonraw</b> JSON file format including only raw hex-encoded packet data. It can be used with <b>-j</b> or <b>-J</b> to
           specify which protocols to include. Example of usage:

               tshark -T jsonraw -r file.pcap
               tshark -T jsonraw -j "http tcp ip" -x -r file.pcap

           <b>pdml</b> Packet Details Markup Language, an XML-based format for the details of a decoded packet. This
           information is equivalent to the packet details printed with the <b>-V</b> option. Using the <b>--color</b> option
           will add color attributes to <b>pdml</b> output. These attributes are nonstandard.

           <b>ps</b> PostScript for a human-readable one-line summary of each of the packets, or a multi-line view of
           the details of each of the packets, depending on whether the <b>-V</b> option was specified.

           <b>psml</b> Packet Summary Markup Language, an XML-based format for the summary information of a decoded
           packet. This information is equivalent to the information shown in the one-line summary printed by
           default. Using the <b>--color</b> option will add color attributes to <b>pdml</b> output. These attributes are
           nonstandard.

           <b>tabs</b> Similar to the default <b>text</b> report except the human-readable one-line summary of each packet
           will include an ASCII horizontal tab (0x09) character as a delimiter between each column.

           <b>text</b> Text of a human-readable one-line summary of each of the packets, or a multi-line view of the
           details of each of the packets, depending on whether the <b>-V</b> option was specified. This is the
           default.

       --temp-dir &lt;directory&gt;

           Specifies the directory into which temporary files (including capture files) are to be written. The
           default behavior on UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, is to use
           the environment variable <u>$TMPDIR</u> if set, and the system default, typically <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>, if it is not. On
           Windows, the <u>%TEMP%</u> environment variable is used, which typically defaults to
           <u>%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp</u>.

       -U &lt;tap name&gt;

           PDUs export, exports PDUs from infile to outfile according to the tap name given. Use <b>-Y</b> to filter.

           Enter an empty tap name "" or a tap name of ? to get a list of available names.

       -v|--version
           Print the full version information and exit.

       -V
           Cause <b>TShark</b> to print a view of the packet details.

       -w  &lt;outfile&gt; | -

           Write raw packet data to <u>outfile</u> or to the standard output if <u>outfile</u> is '-'. The <b>-F</b> and <b>--compress</b>
           options can be used to control the file format and compression method. If the latter is not given,
           then the extension may be used to deduce the desired compression algorithm, if supported, e.g. a gzip
           archive for '.gz'.

               <b>Note</b>

               <b>-w</b> provides raw packet data, not text. If you want text output you need to redirect stdout (e.g.
               using '&gt;'), don’t use the <b>-w</b> option for this.

       -W  &lt;file format option&gt;

           Save extra information in the file if the format supports it. For example,

               tshark -F pcapng -W n

           will save host name resolution records along with captured packets.

           Future versions of <b>TShark</b> may automatically change the capture format to <b>pcapng</b> as needed.

           The argument is a string that may contain the following letter:

           <b>n</b> write network address resolution information (pcapng only)

       -x
           Cause <b>TShark</b> to print a hex and ASCII dump of the packet data after printing the summary and/or
           details, if either are also being displayed.

       --hexdump &lt;hexoption&gt;

           Cause <b>TShark</b> to print a hex and ASCII dump of the packet data with the ability to select which data
           sources to dump and how to format or exclude the ASCII dump text.

           This option can be used multiple times where the data source <b>&lt;hexoption&gt;</b> is <b>all</b> or <b>frames</b> and the
           ASCII dump text <b>&lt;hexoption&gt;</b> is <b>ascii</b>, <b>delimit</b>, <b>noascii</b>.

               Example:  tshark ... --hexdump frames --hexdump delimit ...

           <b>all</b>
               Enable hexdump, generate hexdump blocks for all data sources associated with each frame. Used to
               negate earlier use of --hexdump frames. The <b>-x</b> option displays all data sources by default.

           <b>frames</b>
               Enable hexdump, generate hexdump blocks only for the frame data. Use this option to exclude, from
               hexdump output, any hexdump blocks for secondary data sources such as 'Bitstring tvb',
               'Reassembled TCP', 'De-chunked entity body', etc.

           <b>ascii</b>
               Enable hexdump, with undelimited ASCII dump text. Used to negate earlier use of --hexdump delimit
               or --hexdump noascii. The <b>-x</b> option displays undelimited ASCII dump text by default.

           <b>delimit</b>
               Enable hexdump with the ASCII dump text delimited with '|' characters. This is useful to
               unambiguously determine the last of the hex byte text and start of the ASCII dump text.

           <b>noascii</b>
               Enable hexdump without printing any ASCII dump text.

           <b>help</b>
               Display <b>--hexdump</b> specific help then exit.

           The use of <b>--hexdump</b> <b>&lt;hexoption&gt;</b> is particularly useful to generate output that can be used to create
           a pcap or pcapng file from a capture file type such as Microsoft NetMon 2.x which <b>TShark</b> and
           <b>Wireshark</b> can read but can not directly do a "Save as" nor export packets from.

           Examples:

           Generate hexdump output, with only the frame data source, with delimited ASCII dump text, with each
           frame hex block preceded by a human readable timestamp that is directly usable by the <b>text2pcap</b>
           utility:

               tshark ... --hexdump frames --hexdump delimit \
                   -P -t ad -o gui.column.format:"Time","%t" \
                   | text2pcap -n -t '%F %T.%f' - MYNEWPCAPNG

           Generate hexdump output, with only the frame data source, with no ASCII dump text, with each frame
           hex block preceded by an epoch timestamp that is directly usable by the <b>text2pcap</b> utility:

               tshark ... --hexdump frames --hexdump noascii \
                   -P -t e -o gui.column.format:"Time","%t" \
                   | text2pcap -n -t %s.%f - MYNEWPCAPNG

       -X &lt;eXtension options&gt;

           Specify an option to be passed to a <b>TShark</b> module. The eXtension option is in the form
           <u>extension_key:value</u>, where <u>extension_key</u> can be:

           <b>lua_script</b>:<u>lua_script_filename</u> tells <b>TShark</b> to load the given script in addition to the default Lua
           scripts.

           <b>lua_script</b><u>num</u>:<u>argument</u> tells <b>TShark</b> to pass the given argument to the lua script identified by 'num',
           which is the number indexed order of the 'lua_script' command. For example, if only one script was
           loaded with '-X lua_script:my.lua', then '-X lua_script1:foo' will pass the string 'foo' to the
           'my.lua' script. If two scripts were loaded, such as '-X lua_script:my.lua' and '-X
           lua_script:other.lua' in that order, then a '-X lua_script2:bar' would pass the string 'bar' to the
           second lua script, namely 'other.lua'.

           <b>read_format</b>:<u>file_format</u> tells <b>TShark</b> to use the given file format to read in the file (the file given
           in the <b>-r</b> command option). Providing no <u>file_format</u> argument, or an invalid one, will produce a list
           of available file formats to use. For example,

               tshark -r rtcp_broken.pcapng -X read_format:"MIME Files Format" -V

           will display the internal file structure  and allow access to the file-pcapng fields.

       -y|--linktype  &lt;capture link type&gt;

           Set the data link type to use while capturing packets. The values reported by <b>-L</b> are the values that
           can be used.

           This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first occurrence of the <b>-i</b> option, it sets
           the default capture link type. If used after an <b>-i</b> option, it sets the capture link type for the
           interface specified by the last <b>-i</b> option occurring before this option. If the capture link type is
           not set specifically, the default capture link type is used if provided.

       -Y|--display-filter  &lt;displaY filter&gt;

           Cause the specified filter (which uses the syntax of read/display filters, rather than that of
           capture filters) to be applied before printing a decoded form of packets or writing packets to a
           file. Packets matching the filter are printed or written to file; packets that the matching packets
           depend upon (e.g., fragments), are not printed but are written to file; packets not matching the
           filter nor depended upon are discarded rather than being printed or written.

           Use this instead of <b>-R</b> for filtering using single-pass analysis. If doing two-pass analysis (see <b>-2</b>)
           then only packets matching the read filter (if there is one) will be checked against this filter.

       -M  &lt;auto session reset&gt;

           Automatically reset internal session when reached to specified number of packets. For example,

               tshark -M 100000

           will reset session every 100000 packets.

           This feature does not support <b>-2</b> two-pass analysis

       -z  &lt;statistics&gt;

           Get <b>TShark</b> to collect various types of statistics and display the result after finishing reading the
           capture file. Use the <b>-q</b> option if you’re reading a capture file and only want the statistics
           printed, not any per-packet information.

           Statistics are calculated independently of the normal per-packet output, unaffected by the main
           display filter. However, most have their own optional <u>filter</u> parameter, and only packets that match
           that filter (and any capture filter or read filter) will be used in the calculations.

           Note that the <b>-z</b> <b>proto</b> option is different - it doesn’t cause statistics to be gathered and printed
           when the capture is complete, it modifies the regular packet summary output to include the values of
           fields specified with the option. Therefore you must not use the <b>-q</b> option, as that option would
           suppress the printing of the regular packet summary output, and must also not use the <b>-V</b> option, as
           that would cause packet detail information rather than packet summary information to be printed.

           Some of the currently implemented statistics are:

       <b>-z</b> <b>help</b>
           Display all possible values for <b>-z</b>.

           Show DHCP (BOOTP) statistics.

       <b>-z</b> diameter,avp[,<u>cmd.code</u>,<u>field</u>,<u>field</u>,<u>...</u>]

           This option enables extraction of most important diameter fields from large capture files. Exactly
           one text line for each diameter message with matched <b>diameter.cmd.code</b> will be printed.

           Empty diameter command code or '*' can be specified to match any <b>diameter.cmd.code</b>

           Example: <b>-z</b> <b>diameter,avp</b>  extract default field set from diameter messages.

           Example: <b>-z</b> <b>diameter,avp,280</b>  extract default field set from diameter DWR messages.

           Example: <b>-z</b> <b>diameter,avp,272</b>  extract default field set from diameter CC messages.

           <b>tshark</b> <b>-r</b> <b>file.cap.gz</b> <b>-q</b> <b>-z</b>
           <b>diameter,avp,272,CC-Request-Type,CC-Request-Number,Session-Id,Subscription-Id-Data,Rating-Group,Result-Code</b>

           Following fields will be printed out for each diameter message:

               "frame"        Frame number.
               "time"         Unix time of the frame arrival.
               "src"          Source address.

               "dstport"      Destination port.
               "proto"        Constant string 'diameter', which can be used for post processing of tshark output.  E.g. grep/sed/awk.
               "msgnr"        seq. number of diameter message within the frame.  E.g. '2' for the third diameter message in the same frame.
               "is_request"   '0' if message is a request, '1' if message is an answer.
               "cmd"          diameter.cmd_code, E.g. '272' for credit control messages.
               "req_frame"    Number of frame where matched request was found or '0'.
               "ans_frame"    Number of frame where matched answer was found or '0'.
               "resp_time"    response time in seconds, '0' in case if matched Request/Answer is not found in trace.  E.g. in the begin or end of capture.

           <b>-z</b> <b>diameter,avp</b> option is much faster than <b>-V</b> <b>-T</b> <b>text</b> or <b>-T</b> <b>pdml</b> options.

           <b>-z</b> <b>diameter,avp</b> option is more powerful than <b>-T</b> <b>field</b> and <b>-z</b> <b>proto,colinfo</b> options.

           Multiple diameter messages in one frame are supported.

           Several fields with same name within one diameter message are supported, e.g.
           <u>diameter.Subscription-Id-Data</u> or <u>diameter.Rating-Group</u>.

           Note: <b>tshark</b> <b>-q</b> option is recommended to suppress default <b>TShark</b> output.

       <b>-z</b> diameter,srt[,<u>filter</u>]
           Collect requests/response SRT (Service Response Time) data for Diameter. Data collected is number of
           request and response pairs of each Diameter command code, Minimum SRT, Maximum SRT, Average SRT, and
           Sum SRT. Currently no statistics are gathered on unpaired messages.

       <b>-z</b> dns,tree[,<u>filter</u>]
           Create a summary of the captured DNS packets. General information are collected such as qtype and
           qclass distribution. For some data (as qname length or DNS payload) max, min and average values are
           also displayed.

       <b>-z</b> endpoints,<u>type</u>[,<u>filter</u>]

           Create a table that lists all endpoints that could be seen in the capture. <u>type</u> specifies the

               "rsvp"      RSVP connections
               "sctp"      SCTP/IP socket pairs Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported
               "sll"       Linux "cooked mode" capture addresses
               "tcp"       TCP/IP socket pairs  Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported
               "tr"        Token Ring addresses
               "udp"       UDP/IP socket pairs  Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported

               "zbee_nwk"  ZigBee Network Layer addresses

           The table is presented with one line for each endpoint which displays the total number of
           packets/bytes and the number of packets/bytes in each direction. The table is sorted according to the
           total number of packets.

       <b>-z</b> enrp,stat[,<u>filter</u>]
           Calculate statistics on Endpoint Handlespace Redundancy Protocol (ENRP). For each message type,
           displays the number, rate, and share among all message types of both packets and bytes, and the first
           and last time that it is seen.

       <b>-z</b> expert[<u>,error|,warn|,note|,chat|,comment</u>][,<u>filter</u>]

           Collects information about all expert info, and will display them in order, grouped by severity.

           Example: <b>-z</b> <b>expert,sip</b> will show expert items of all severity for frames that match the sip protocol.

           This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

           Example: <b>-z</b> <b>"expert,note,tcp"</b> will only collect expert items for frames that include the tcp
           protocol, with a severity of note or higher.

       <b>-z</b> f1ap,tree[,<u>filter</u>]
           Calculate the distribution of F1AP packets, grouped by packet types.

       <b>-z</b> f5_tmm_dist,tree[,<u>filter</u>]
           Calculate the F5 Ethernet trailer Traffic Management Microkernel distribution. Displayed information
           is the number of packets and bytes, grouped by the TMM slot and number, whether packets are ingress
           or egress, and whether there is a flow ID and virtual server name, a flow ID without virtual server
           name, or no flow ID, along with total for all packets with F5 trailers.

       <b>-z</b> f5_virt_dist,tree[,<u>filter</u>]
           Calculate F5 Ethernet trailer Virtual Server distribution. Displayed information is the number of
           packets and bytes, grouped by the virtual server name if it exists, or by whether there is a flow ID
           or not if there is no virtual server name, as well as totals for all packets with F5 trailers.

       <b>-z</b> fc,srt[,<u>filter</u>]
           Collect requests/response SRT (Service Response Time) data for GTP. Data collected is the number of
           request/response pairs, minimum SRT, maximum SRT, average SRT, and sum SRT for each value of the Type
           field (next protocol). No statistics are gathered on unpaired messages.

       <b>-z</b> flow,<u>name</u>,<u>mode</u>[,<u>filter</u>]

           Displays the flow of data between two nodes. Output is the same as ASCII format saved from GUI.

           <u>name</u> specifies the flow name. It can be one of:

               any      All frames
               icmp     ICMP
               icmpv6   ICMPv6
               lbm_uim  UIM
               tcp      TCP

           <u>mode</u> specifies the address type. It can be one of:

               standard   Any address
               network    Network address

           Example: <b>-z</b> <b>flow,tcp,network</b> will show data flow for all TCP frames

       <b>-z</b> follow,<u>prot</u>,<u>mode</u>,<u>filter</u>[,<u>range</u>]

           Displays the contents of a TCP or UDP stream between two nodes. The data sent by the second node is
           prefixed with a tab to differentiate it from the data sent by the first node.

           <u>prot</u> specifies the transport protocol. It can be one of:

               tcp   TCP
               udp   UDP
               dccp  DCCP
               tls   TLS or SSL
               http  HTTP streams
               http2 HTTP/2 streams
               quic  QUIC streams

               <b>Note</b>

               While the usage help presents sip as an option, the proper stream filters are not implemented so
               SIP calls cannot be followed in <b>TShark</b>, only in <b>Wireshark</b>.

           <u>mode</u> specifies the output mode. It can be one of:

               ascii  ASCII output with dots for non-printable characters
               ebcdic EBCDIC output with dots for non-printable characters
               hex    Hexadecimal and ASCII data with offsets
               raw    Hexadecimal data
               utf-8  UTF-8 output with REPLACEMENT CHARACTERs for invalid sequences
               yaml   YAML format

           Since the output in <b>ascii</b>, <b>ebcdic</b>, or <b>utf-8</b> mode may contain newlines, each section of output is
           preceded by its length in bytes plus a newline. (Note that for <b>utf-8</b> this is not UTF-8 characters,
           and may be different than the length as transmitted due to the substitution of replacement characters
           for invalid sequences.)

           <u>filter</u> specifies the stream to be displayed. There are three formats:

               ip-addr0:port0,ip-addr1:port1
               stream-index
               stream-index,substream-index

           The first format specifies IP addresses and TCP, UDP, or DCCP port pairs. (TCP ports are used for
           TLS, HTTP, and HTTP2; QUIC does not support address and port matching because of connection
           migration.)

           The second format specifies stream indices, and is used for TCP, UDP, DCCP, TLS, and HTTP. (TLS and
           HTTP use TCP stream indices.)

           The third format, specifying streams and substreams, is used for HTTP/2 and QUIC due to their use of
           multiplexing. (TCP stream and HTTP/2 stream indices for HTTP/2, QUIC connection number and stream ID
           for QUIC.)

           <u>range</u> optionally specifies which "chunks" of the stream should be displayed.

           Example: <b>-z</b> <b>"follow,tcp,hex,1"</b> will display the contents of the second TCP stream (the first is
           stream 0) in "hex" format.

       <b>-z</b> icmp,srt[,<u>filter</u>]

           Compute total ICMP echo requests, replies, loss, and percent loss, as well as minimum, maximum, mean,
           median and sample standard deviation SRT statistics typical of what ping provides.

           Example: <b>-z</b> <b>icmp,srt,ip.src==1.2.3.4</b> will collect ICMP SRT statistics for ICMP echo request packets
           originating from a specific host.

           This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

       <b>-z</b> icmpv6,srt[,<u>filter</u>]

           Compute total ICMPv6 echo requests, replies, loss, and percent loss, as well as minimum, maximum,
           mean, median and sample standard deviation SRT statistics typical of what ping provides.

           Example: <b>-z</b> <b>icmpv6,srt,ipv6.src==fe80::1</b> will collect ICMPv6 SRT statistics for ICMPv6 echo request
           packets originating from a specific host.

           This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

       <b>-z</b> io,phs[,<u>filter</u>]

           Create Protocol Hierarchy Statistics listing both number of packets and bytes.

           This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

       <b>-z</b> io,stat,<u>interval</u>[,<u>filter</u>][,<u>filter</u>][,<u>filter</u>]...

           Collect packet/bytes statistics for the capture in intervals of <u>interval</u> seconds. <u>Interval</u> can be
           specified either as a whole or fractional second and can be specified with microsecond (us)
           resolution. If <u>interval</u> is 0, the statistics will be calculated over all packets.

           If one or more <u>filters</u> are specified statistics will be calculated for all filters and presented with
           one column of statistics for each filter.

           This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

           Example: <b>-z</b> <b>io,stat,1,ip.addr==1.2.3.4</b> will generate 1 second statistics for all traffic to/from host
           1.2.3.4.

           Example: <b>-z</b> <b>"io,stat,0.001,smb&amp;&amp;ip.addr==1.2.3.4"</b> will generate 1ms statistics for all SMB packets
           to/from host 1.2.3.4.

           The examples above all use the standard syntax for generating statistics which only calculates the
           number of packets and bytes in each interval.

           <b>io,stat</b> can also do much more statistics and calculate COUNT(), SUM(), MIN(), MAX(), AVG() and LOAD()
           using a slightly different filter syntax:

       -z io,stat,<u>interval</u>,"COUNT|SUM|MIN|MAX|AVG|LOAD(<u>field</u>)<u>filter</u>"

               <b>Note</b>

               One important thing to note here is that the filter is not optional and that the field that the
               calculation is based on MUST be part of the filter string or the calculation will fail.

           So: <b>-z</b> <b>io,stat,0.010,AVG(smb.time)</b> does not work. Use <b>-z</b> <b>io,stat,0.010,AVG(smb.time)smb.time</b> instead.
           Also be aware that a field can exist multiple times inside the same packet and will then be counted
           multiple times in those packets.

               <b>Note</b>

               A second important thing to note is that the system setting for decimal separator must be set to
               "."! If it is set to "," the statistics will not be displayed per filter.

           <b>COUNT</b> - Calculates the number of times that the field <u>name</u> (not its value) appears per interval in
           the filtered packet list. ''<u>field</u>'' can be any display filter name.

           Example: <b>-z</b> <b>io,stat,0.010,"COUNT(smb.sid)smb.sid"</b>

           This will count the total number of SIDs seen in each 10ms interval.

           <b>SUM</b> - Unlike COUNT, the <u>values</u> of the specified field are summed per time interval. ''<u>field</u>'' can
           only be a named integer, float, double or relative time field.

           Example: <b>tshark</b> <b>-z</b> <b>io,stat,0.010,"SUM(frame.len)frame.len"</b>

           Reports the total number of bytes that were transmitted bidirectionally in all the packets within a
           10 millisecond interval.

           <b>MIN/MAX/AVG</b> - The minimum, maximum, or average field value in each interval is calculated. The
           specified field must be a named integer, float, double or relative time field. For relative time
           fields, the output is presented in seconds with six decimal digits of precision rounded to the
           nearest microsecond.

           In the following example, the time of the first Read_AndX call, the last Read_AndX response values
           are displayed and the minimum, maximum, and average Read response times (SRTs) are calculated. NOTE:
           If the DOS command shell line continuation character, ''^'' is used, each line cannot end in a comma
           so it is placed at the beginning of each continuation line:

               tshark -o tcp.desegment_tcp_streams:FALSE -n -q -r smb_reads.cap -z io,stat,0,
               "MIN(frame.time_relative)frame.time_relative and smb.cmd==0x2e and smb.flags.response==0",

           at IP address 1.2.3.4 .

       <b>-z</b> smb,sids

           When this feature is used <b>TShark</b> will print a report with all the discovered SID and account name
           mappings. Only those SIDs where the account name is known will be presented in the table.

           For this feature to work you will need to either to enable "Edit/Preferences/Protocols/SMB/Snoop SID
           to name mappings" in the preferences or you can override the preferences by specifying <b>-o</b>
           <b>"smb.sid_name_snooping:TRUE"</b> on the <b>TShark</b> command line.

           The current method used by <b>TShark</b> to find the SID→name mapping is relatively restricted with a hope
           of future expansion.

           The data will be presented as separate tables for all normal SMB commands, all Transaction2 commands
           and all NT Transaction commands. Only those commands that are seen in the capture will have its stats
           displayed. Only the first command in a xAndX command chain will be used in the calculation. So for
           common SessionSetupAndX + TreeConnectAndX chains, only the SessionSetupAndX call will be used in the
           statistics. This is a flaw that might be fixed in the future.

           This option can be used multiple times on the command line.

           Example: <b>-z</b> <b>"smb,srt,ip.addr==1.2.3.4"</b> will only collect stats for SMB packets exchanged by the host
           at IP address 1.2.3.4 .

       <b>-z</b> smb2,srt[,<u>filter</u>]
           Collect call/reply SRT (Service Response Time) data for SMB versions 2 and 3. The data collected for
           each normal command type is the number of calls, MinSRT, MaxSRT, AvgSRT, and SumSRT. No data is
           collected on cancel or oplock break requests, or on unpaired commands. Only the first response to a
           given request is used; retransmissions are not included in the calculation.

       <b>-z</b> smpp_commands,tree[,<u>filter</u>]
           Calculate the SMPP command distribution. Displayed values are command IDs for both requests and
           responses, and status for responses.

       <b>-z</b> snmp,srt[,<u>filter</u>]
           Collect call/reply SRT (Service Response Time) data for SNMP. The data collected for each PDU type is
           the number of request/response pairs, MinSRT, MaxSRT, AvgSRT, and SumSRT. No data is collected on
           unpaired messages.

       <b>-z</b>  someip_messages,tree[,<u>filter</u>]
           Create statistic of SOME/IP messages. Messages are counted and displayed as Messages grouped by
           sender/receiver.

       <b>-z</b>  someipsd_entries,tree[,<u>filter</u>]
           Create statistic of SOME/IP-SD entries. Entries are counted and displayed as Entries grouped by
           sender/receiver.

       <b>-z</b> sv
           Print out the time since the start of the capture and sample count for each IEC 61850 Sampled Values
           packet.

       <b>-z</b> ucp_messages,tree[,<u>filter</u>]
           Calculate the message distribution of UCP packets. Displayed values are operation types for both
           operations and results, and whether results are positive or negative, with error codes displayed for
           negative results.

       <b>-z</b> wsp,stat[,<u>filter</u>]
           Count the PDU types and the status codes of reply packets for WSP packets.

       --capture-comment &lt;comment&gt;

           Add a capture comment to the output file, if supported by the output file format.

           This option may be specified multiple times. Note that Wireshark currently only displays the first
           comment of a capture file.

       --list-time-stamp-types
           List time stamp types supported for the interface. If no time stamp type can be set, no time stamp
           types are listed.

       --time-stamp-type &lt;type&gt;
           Change the interface’s timestamp method.

       --update-interval  &lt;interval&gt;
           Set the length of time in milliseconds between new packet reports during a capture. Also sets the
           granularity of file duration conditions. The default value is 100ms.

       --color
           Enable coloring of packets according to standard Wireshark color filters. On Windows colors are
           limited to the standard console character attribute colors. Other platforms require a terminal that
           handles 24-bit "true color" terminal escape sequences. See https://wiki.wireshark.org/ColoringRules
           for more information on configuring color filters.

       --no-duplicate-keys
           If a key appears multiple times in an object, only write it a single time with as value a json array
           containing all the separate values. (Only works with <b>-T</b> <b>json</b>)

       --elastic-mapping-filter &lt;protocol&gt;,&lt;protocol&gt;,...

           When generating the ElasticSearch mapping file, only put the specified protocols in it, to avoid a
           huge mapping file that can choke some software (such as Kibana). The option takes a list of wanted
           protocol abbreviations, separated by comma.

           Example: ip,udp,dns puts only those three protocols in the mapping file.

       --export-objects &lt;protocol&gt;,&lt;destdir&gt;

           Export all objects within a protocol into directory <b>destdir</b>. The available values for <b>protocol</b> can be
           listed with <b>--export-objects</b> <b>help</b>.

           The objects are directly saved in the given directory. Filenames are dependent on the dissector, but
           typically it is named after the basename of a file. Duplicate files are not overwritten, instead an
           increasing number is appended before the file extension.

           This interface is subject to change, adding the possibility to filter on files.

       --print-timers
           Output JSON containing elapsed times for each pass tshark does to process a capture file and the sum
           elapsed time for all passes. The per-pass output contains the total elapsed time and aggregate
           counters for per-packet operations (dissection and filtering).

       --compress &lt;type&gt;

           Compress the output file using the type compression format. <b>--compress</b> with no argument provides a
           list of the compression formats supported for writing. The type given takes precedence over the
           extension of <u>outfile</u>.

               <b>Note</b>

               This option only works with the <b>-r</b> option, i.e., when reading a capture file, not for live
               captures.

</pre><h4><b>DISSECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -d  &lt;layer type&gt;==&lt;selector&gt;,&lt;decode-as protocol&gt;

           Like Wireshark’s <b>Decode</b> <b>As...</b> feature, this lets you specify how a layer type should be dissected. If
           the layer type in question (for example, <b>tcp.port</b> or <b>udp.port</b> for a TCP or UDP port number) has the
           specified selector value, packets should be dissected as the specified protocol.

           <b>Example</b> <b>1.</b> <b>Decode</b> <b>As</b> <b>Port</b>

               <b>-d</b> <b>tcp.port==8888,http</b> will decode any traffic running over TCP port 8888 as HTTP.

           <b>Example</b> <b>2.</b> <b>Decode</b> <b>As</b> <b>Port</b> <b>Range</b>

               <b>-d</b> <b>tcp.port==8888-8890,http</b> will decode any traffic running over TCP ports 8888, 8889 or 8890 as
               HTTP.

           <b>Example</b> <b>3.</b> <b>Decode</b> <b>As</b> <b>Port</b> <b>Range</b> <b>via</b> <b>Length</b>

               <b>-d</b> <b>tcp.port==8888:3,http</b> will decode any traffic running over the three TCP ports 8888, 8889 or
               8890 as HTTP.

           Using an invalid selector or protocol will print out a list of valid selectors and protocol names,
           respectively.

           <b>Example</b> <b>4.</b> <b>Decode</b> <b>As</b> <b>List</b> <b>of</b> <b>Selectors</b>

               <b>-d</b> <b>.</b> is a quick way to get a list of valid selectors.

           <b>Example</b> <b>5.</b> <b>Decode</b> <b>As</b> <b>List</b> <b>of</b> <b>Values</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Selector</b>

               <b>-d</b> <b>ethertype==0x0800,.</b> is a quick way to get a list of protocols that can be selected with an
               ethertype.

       --disable-all-protocols
           Disable dissection of all protocols.

       --disable-protocol &lt;proto_name&gt;[,&lt;proto_name&gt;,...]
           Disable dissection of proto_name. Use a proto_name of <b>ALL</b> to override your chosen profile’s default
           enabled protocol list and temporarily disable all protocols.

       --disable-heuristic &lt;short_name&gt;
           Disable dissection of heuristic protocol.

       --enable-protocol &lt;proto_name&gt;[,&lt;proto_name&gt;,...]

           Enable dissection of proto_name. Use a proto_name of <b>ALL</b> to override your chosen profile’s default
           disabled protocol list and temporarily enable all protocols which are enabled by default.

           If a protocol is implicated in both <b>--disable-protocol</b> and <b>--enable-protocol</b>, the protocol is
           enabled. This allows you to temporarily disable all protocols but a list of exceptions. Example:
           <b>--disable-protocol</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>--enable-protocol</b> <b>eth,ip</b>

       --enable-heuristic &lt;short_name&gt;
           Enable dissection of heuristic protocol.

       -K  &lt;keytab&gt;

           Load kerberos crypto keys from the specified keytab file. This option can be used multiple times to
           load keys from several files.

           Example: <b>-K</b> <b>krb5.keytab</b>

       -n
           Disable network object name resolution (such as hostname, TCP and UDP port names); the <b>-N</b> option
           might override this one.

       -N  &lt;name resolving flags&gt;

           Turn on name resolving only for particular types of addresses and port numbers, with name resolving
           for other types of addresses and port numbers turned off. This option (along with <b>-n</b>) can be
           specified multiple times; the last value given overrides earlier ones. This option and <b>-n</b> override
           the options from the preferences, including preferences set via the <b>-o</b> option. If both <b>-N</b> and <b>-n</b>
           options are not present, the values from the preferences are used, which default to <b>-N</b> <b>dmN</b>.

           The argument is a string that may contain the letters:

           <b>d</b> to enable resolution from captured DNS packets

           <b>g</b> to enable IP address geolocation information lookup from configured MaxMind databases

           <b>m</b> to enable MAC address resolution

           <b>n</b> to enable network address resolution

           <b>N</b> to enable using external resolvers (e.g., DNS) for network address resolution; no effect without <b>n</b>
           also enabled.

           <b>s</b> to enable address resolution using SNI information found in captured handshake packets

           <b>t</b> to enable transport-layer port number resolution

           <b>v</b> to enable VLAN IDs to names resolution

               <b>Caution</b>

               In tshark single-pass mode, external resolution and geolocation lookup is performed
               synchronously. For live captures, which are always in single-pass mode, this makes it more
               difficult for dissection to keep up with a busy network, possibly leading to dropped packets.

       --only-protocols &lt;protocols&gt;
           Only enable dissection of these protocols, comma separated. Disable everything else.

       -t  (a|ad|adoy|d|dd|e|r|u|ud|udoy)[.[N]]|.[N]

           Set the format of the packet timestamp displayed in the default time column. The format can be one
           of:

           <b>a</b> absolute: The absolute time, as local time in your time zone, is the actual time the packet was
           captured, with no date displayed

           <b>ad</b> absolute with date: The absolute date, displayed as YYYY-MM-DD, and time, as local time in your
           time zone, is the actual time and date the packet was captured

           <b>adoy</b> absolute with date using day of year: The absolute date, displayed as YYYY/DOY, and time, as
           local time in your time zone, is the actual time and date the packet was captured

           <b>d</b> delta: The delta time is the time since the previous packet was captured

           <b>dd</b> delta_displayed: The delta_displayed time is the time since the previous displayed packet was
           captured

           <b>e</b> epoch: The time in seconds since epoch (Jan 1, 1970 00:00:00)

           <b>r</b> relative: The relative time is the time elapsed between the first packet and the current packet

           <b>u</b> UTC: The absolute time, as UTC, is the actual time the packet was captured, with no date displayed

           <b>ud</b> UTC with date: The absolute date, displayed as YYYY-MM-DD, and time, as UTC, is the actual time
           and date the packet was captured

           <b>udoy</b> UTC with date using day of year: The absolute date, displayed as YYYY/DOY, and time, as UTC, is
           the actual time and date the packet was captured

           <b>.[N]</b> Set the precision: N is the number of decimals (0 through 9). If using "." without N,
           automatically determine precision from trace.

           The default format is relative with precision based on capture format.

       -u &lt;s|hms&gt;

           Specifies how packet timestamp formats in <b>-t</b> which are relative times (i.e. relative, delta, and
           delta_displayed) are displayed. Valid choices are:

           <b>s</b> for seconds

           <b>hms</b> for hours, minutes, and seconds

           The default format is seconds.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --log-level &lt;level&gt;
           Set the active log level. Supported levels in lowest to highest order are "noisy", "debug", "info",
           "message", "warning", "critical", and "error". Messages at each level and higher will be printed, for
           example "warning" prints "warning", "critical", and "error" messages and "noisy" prints all messages.
           Levels are case insensitive.

       --log-fatal &lt;level&gt;
           Abort the program if any messages are logged at the specified level or higher. For example, "warning"
           aborts on any "warning", "critical", or "error" messages.

       --log-domains &lt;list&gt;
           Only print messages for the specified log domains, e.g. "GUI,Epan,sshdump". List of domains must be
           comma-separated. Can be negated with "!" as the first character (inverts the match).

       --log-debug &lt;list&gt;
           Force the specified domains to log at the "debug" level. List of domains must be comma-separated. Can
           be negated with "!" as the first character (inverts the match).

       --log-noisy &lt;list&gt;
           Force the specified domains to log at the "noisy" level. List of domains must be comma-separated. Can
           be negated with "!" as the first character (inverts the match).

       --log-fatal-domains &lt;list&gt;
           Abort the program if any messages are logged for the specified log domains. List of domains must be
           comma-separated.

       --log-file &lt;path&gt;
           Write log messages and stderr output to the specified file.

       <a href="../man4/wireshark-filter.4.html">wireshark-filter</a>(4) manual page.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       These files contain various <b>Wireshark</b> configuration settings.

       Preferences

           The <u>preferences</u> files contain global (system-wide) and personal preference settings. If the
           system-wide preference file exists, it is read first, overriding the default settings. If the
           personal preferences file exists, it is read next, overriding any previous values. Note: If the
           command line flag <b>-o</b> is used (possibly more than once), it will in turn override values from the
           preferences files.

           The preferences settings are in the form <u>prefname:value</u>, one per line, where <u>prefname</u> is the name of
           the preference and <u>value</u> is the value to which it should be set; white space is allowed between <b>:</b> and
           <u>value</u>. A preference setting can be continued on subsequent lines by indenting the continuation lines
           with white space. A <b>#</b> character starts a comment that runs to the end of the line:

               # Vertical scrollbars should be on right side?
               # TRUE or FALSE (case-insensitive).
               gui.scrollbar_on_right: TRUE

           The global preferences file is looked for in the <u>wireshark</u> directory under the <u>share</u> subdirectory of
           the main installation directory. On macOS, this would typically be
           <u>/Application/Wireshark.app/Contents/Resources/share</u>; on other UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux,
           \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, this would typically be <u>/usr/share/wireshark/preferences</u> for
           system-installed packages and <u>/usr/local/share/wireshark/preferences</u> for locally-installed packages;
           on Windows, this would typically be <u>C:\Program</u> <u>Files\Wireshark\preferences</u>.

           On UNIX-compatible systems, the personal preferences file is looked for in
           <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark/preferences</u>, (or, if <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark</u> does not exist while
           <u>$HOME/.wireshark</u> does exist, <u>$HOME/.wireshark/preferences</u>); this is typically
           <u>$HOME/.config/wireshark/preferences</u>. On Windows, the personal preferences file is looked for in
           <u>%APPDATA%\Wireshark\preferences</u> (or, if %APPDATA% isn’t defined, <u>%USERPROFILE%\Application</u>
           <u>Data\Wireshark\preferences</u>).

       Disabled (Enabled) Protocols

           The <u>disabled_protos</u> files contain system-wide and personal lists of protocols that have been
           disabled, so that their dissectors are never called. The files contain protocol names, one per line,
           where the protocol name is the same name that would be used in a display filter for the protocol:

               http
               tcp     # a comment

           If a protocol is listed in the global <u>disabled_protos</u> file it cannot be enabled by the user.

           The global <u>disabled_protos</u> file uses the same directory as the global preferences file.

           The personal <u>disabled_protos</u> file uses the same directory as the personal preferences file.

           The <u>disabled_protos</u> files list only protocols that are enabled by default but have been disabled;
           protocols that are disabled by default (such as some postdissectors) are not listed. There are
           analogous <u>enabled_protos</u> files for protocols that are disabled by default but have been enabled.

       Heuristic Dissectors

           The <u>heuristic_protos</u> files contain system-wide and personal lists of heuristic dissectors and
           indicate whether they are enabled or disabled. The files contain heuristic dissector unique short
           names, one per line, followed by a comma and 0 for disabled and 1 for enabled:

               quic,1
               rtcp_stun,1
               rtcp_udp,1
               rtp_stun,0
               rtp_udp,0
               tls_tcp,1

           The global <u>heuristic_protos</u> file uses the same directory as the global preferences file.

           The personal <u>heuristic_protos</u> file uses the same directory as the personal preferences file.

       Name Resolution (hosts)

           Entries in <u>hosts</u> files in the global and personal preferences directory are used to resolve IPv4 and
           IPv6 addresses before any other attempts are made to resolve them. The file has the standard <u>hosts</u>
           file syntax; each line contains one IP address and name, separated by whitespace. The personal <u>hosts</u>
           file, if present, overrides the one in the global directory.

           Capture filter name resolution is handled by libpcap on UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux,
           macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, and Npcap or WinPcap on Windows. As such the Wireshark personal <u>hosts</u>
           file will not be consulted for capture filter name resolution.

       Name Resolution (subnets)

           If an IPv4 address cannot be translated via name resolution (no exact match is found) then a partial
           match is attempted via the <u>subnets</u> file. Both the global <u>subnets</u> file and personal <u>subnets</u> files are
           used if they exist.

           Each line of this file consists of an IPv4 address, a subnet mask length separated only by a / and a
           name separated by whitespace. While the address must be a full IPv4 address, any values beyond the
           mask length are subsequently ignored.

           An example is:

           # Comments must be prepended by the # sign! 192.168.0.0/24 ws_test_network

           A partially matched name will be printed as "subnet-name.remaining-address". For example,
           "192.168.0.1" under the subnet above would be printed as "ws_test_network.1"; if the mask length
           above had been 16 rather than 24, the printed address would be "ws_test_network.0.1".

       Name Resolution (ethers)

           The <u>ethers</u> files are consulted to correlate 6-byte hardware addresses to names. First the personal
           <u>ethers</u> file is tried and if an address is not found there the global <u>ethers</u> file is tried next.

           Each line contains one hardware address and name, separated by whitespace. The digits of the hardware
           address are separated by colons (:), dashes (-) or periods (.). The same separator character must be
           used consistently in an address. The following three lines are valid lines of an <u>ethers</u> file:

               ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff          Broadcast
               c0-00-ff-ff-ff-ff          TR_broadcast
               00.00.00.00.00.00          Zero_broadcast

           The global <u>ethers</u> file is looked for in the <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u> directory on UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux,
           macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, and in the main installation directory (for example, <u>C:\Program</u>
           <u>Files\Wireshark</u>) on Windows systems.

           The personal <u>ethers</u> file is looked for in the same directory as the personal preferences file.

           Capture filter name resolution is handled by libpcap on UNIX-compatible systems and Npcap or WinPcap
           on Windows. As such the Wireshark personal <u>ethers</u> file will not be consulted for capture filter name
           resolution.

       Name Resolution (manuf)

           The <u>manuf</u> file is used to match the 3-byte vendor portion of a 6-byte hardware address with the
           manufacturer’s name; it can also contain well-known MAC addresses and address ranges specified with a
           netmask. The format of the file is similar the <u>ethers</u> files, except that entries such as:

               00:00:0C      Cisco     Cisco Systems, Inc

           can be provided, with the 3-byte OUI and both an abbreviated and long name for a vendor, and entries
           such as:

               00-00-0C-07-AC/40     All-HSRP-routers

           can be specified, with a MAC address and a mask indicating how many bits of the address must match.
           The above entry, for example, has 40 significant bits, or 5 bytes, and would match addresses from
           00-00-0C-07-AC-00 through 00-00-0C-07-AC-FF. The mask need not be a multiple of 8.

           A global <u>manuf</u> file is looked for in the same directory as the global preferences file, and a
           personal <u>manuf</u> file is looked for in the same directory as the personal preferences file.

           In earlier versions of Wireshark, official information from the IEEE Registration Authority was
           distributed in this format as the global <u>manuf</u> file. This information is now compiled in to speed
           program startup, but the internal information can be written out in this format with <b>tshark</b> <b>-G</b> <b>manuf</b>.

           In addition to the <u>manuf</u> file, another file with the same format, <u>wka</u>, is looked for in the global
           directory. This file is distributed with Wireshark, and contains data about well-known MAC adddresses
           and address ranges assembled from various non IEEE but respected sources.

       Name Resolution (services)

           The <u>services</u> file is used to translate port numbers into names. Both the global <u>services</u> file and
           personal <u>services</u> files are used if they exist.

           The file has the standard <u>services</u> file syntax; each line contains one (service) name and one
           transport identifier separated by white space. The transport identifier includes one port number and
           one transport protocol name (typically tcp, udp, or sctp) separated by a <a href="file:/.">/.</a>

           An example is:

           mydns       5045/udp     # My own Domain Name Server mydns       5045/tcp     # My own Domain Name
           Server

           In earlier versions of Wireshark, official information from the IANA Registry was distributed in this
           format as the global <u>services</u> file. This information is now compiled in to speed program startup, but
           the internal information can be written out in this format with <b>tshark</b> <b>-G</b> <b>services</b>.

       Name Resolution (ipxnets)

           The <u>ipxnets</u> files are used to correlate 4-byte IPX network numbers to names. First the global <u>ipxnets</u>
           file is tried and if that address is not found there the personal one is tried next.

           The format is the same as the <u>ethers</u> file, except that each address is four bytes instead of six.
           Additionally, the address can be represented as a single hexadecimal number, as is more common in the
           IPX world, rather than four hex octets. For example, these four lines are valid lines of an <u>ipxnets</u>
           file:

               C0.A8.2C.00              HR
               c0-a8-1c-00              CEO
               00:00:BE:EF              IT_Server1
               110f                     FileServer3

           The global <u>ipxnets</u> file is looked for in the <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u> directory on UNIX-compatible systems, such as
           Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, and in the main installation directory (for example,
           <u>C:\Program</u> <u>Files\Wireshark</u>) on Windows systems.

           The personal <u>ipxnets</u> file is looked for in the same directory as the personal preferences file.

       Name Resolution (ss7pcs)

           The <u>ss7pcs</u> file is used to translate SS7 point codes to names. It is read from the personal
           configuration directory.

           Each line in this file consists of one network indicator followed by a dash followed by a point code
           in decimal and a node name separated by whitespace. An example is:

               2-1234 MyPointCode1

       Name Resolution (vlans)

           The <u>vlans</u> file is used to translate VLAN tag IDs into names. It is read from the personal
           configuration directory.

           Each line in this file consists of one VLAN tag ID separated by whitespace from a name. An example
           is:

               123    Server-Lan
               2049   HR-Client-LAN

       Color Filters (Coloring Rules)

           The <u>colorfilters</u> files contain system-wide and personal color filters. Each line contains one filter,
           starting with the string displayed in the dialog box, followed by the corresponding display filter.
           Then the background and foreground colors are appended:

               # a comment
               @tcp@tcp@[59345,58980,65534][0,0,0]
               @udp@udp@[28834,57427,65533][0,0,0]

           The global <u>colorfilters</u> file uses the same directory as the global preferences file.

           The personal <u>colorfilters</u> file uses the same directory as the personal preferences file. It is
           written through the View:Coloring Rules dialog.

           If the global <u>colorfilters</u> file exists, it is used only if the personal <u>colorfilters</u> file does not
           exist; global and personal color filters are not merged.

       Plugins

           Wireshark looks for plugins in both a personal plugin folder and a global plugin folder.

           On UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, the global plugin
           directory is <u>lib/wireshark/plugins/</u> (on some systems substitute <u>lib64</u> for <u>lib</u>) under the main
           installation directory (for example, <u>/usr/local/lib/wireshark/plugins/</u>). The personal plugin
           directory is <u>$HOME/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins</u>.

           On macOS, if Wireshark is installed as an application bundle, the global plugin folder is instead
           <u>%APPDIR%/Contents/PlugIns/wireshark</u>.

           On Windows, the global plugin folder is <u>plugins/</u> under the main installation directory (for example,
           <u>C:\Program</u> <u>Files\Wireshark\plugins\</u>). The personal plugin folder is <u>%APPDATA%\Wireshark\plugins</u> (or,
           if %APPDATA% isn’t defined, <u>%USERPROFILE%\Application</u> <u>Data\Wireshark\plugins</u>).

           Lua plugins are stored in the plugin folders; compiled plugins are stored in subfolders of the plugin
           folders, with the subfolder name being the Wireshark minor version number (X.Y). There is another
           hierarchical level for each Wireshark plugin type (libwireshark, libwiretap and codecs). For example,
           the location for a libwireshark plugin <u>foo.so</u> (<u>foo.dll</u> on Windows) would be <u>PLUGINDIR/X.Y/epan</u>
           (libwireshark used to be called libepan; the other folder names are <u>codecs</u> and <u>wiretap</u>).

               <b>Note</b>

               On UNIX-compatible systems, Lua plugins (but not binary plugins) may also be placed in
               <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark/plugins</u>, (or, if <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark</u> does not exist while
               <u>$HOME/.wireshark</u> does exist, <u>$HOME/.wireshark/plugins</u>.)

           Note that a dissector plugin module may support more than one protocol; there is not necessarily a
           one-to-one correspondence between dissector plugin modules and protocols. Protocols supported by a
           dissector plugin module are enabled and disabled in the same way as protocols built into Wireshark.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>TShark</b> uses UTF-8 to represent strings internally. In some cases the output might not be valid. For
       example, a dissector might generate invalid UTF-8 character sequences. Programs reading <b>TShark</b> output
       should expect UTF-8 and be prepared for invalid output.

       If <b>TShark</b> detects that it is writing to a TTY on a UNIX-compatible system, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD,
       Solaris, and AIX, and the locale does not support UTF-8, output will be re-encoded to match the current
       locale.

       If <b>TShark</b> detects that it is writing to the console on Windows, dissection output will be encoded as
       UTF-16LE. Other output will be UTF-8. If extended characters don’t display properly in your terminal you
       might try setting your console code page to UTF-8 (<b>chcp</b> <b>65001</b>) and using a modern terminal application if
       possible.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       WIRESHARK_CONFIG_DIR
           This environment variable overrides the location of personal configuration files. On UNIX-compatible
           systems, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, it defaults to <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark</u>
           (or, if that directory doesn’t exist but <u>$HOME/.wireshark</u> does exist, <u>$HOME/.wireshark</u>); this is
           typically <u>$HOME/.config/wireshark</u>. On Windows, it defaults to <u>%APPDATA%\Wireshark</u> (or, if %APPDATA%
           isn’t defined, <u>%USERPROFILE%\Application</u> <u>Data\Wireshark</u>). Available since Wireshark 3.0.

       WIRESHARK_DEBUG_WMEM_OVERRIDE
           Setting this environment variable forces the wmem framework to use the specified allocator backend
           for <b>all</b> allocations, regardless of which backend is normally specified by the code. This is mainly
           useful to developers when testing or debugging. See <u>README.wmem</u> in the source distribution for
           details.

       WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY
           This environment variable causes the plugins and other data files to be loaded from the build
           directory (where the program was compiled) rather than from the standard locations. It has no effect
           when the program in question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on UNIX-compatible systems,
           such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX.

       WIRESHARK_DATA_DIR
           This environment variable causes the various data files to be loaded from a directory other than the
           standard locations. It has no effect when the program in question is running with root (or setuid)
           permissions on UNIX-compatible systems.

       WIRESHARK_EXTCAP_DIR
           This environment variable causes the various extcap programs and scripts to be run from a directory
           other than the standard locations. It has no effect when the program in question is running with root
           (or setuid) permissions on UNIX-compatible systems.

       WIRESHARK_PLUGIN_DIR
           This environment variable causes the various plugins to be loaded from a directory other than the
           standard locations. It has no effect when the program in question is running with root (or setuid)
           permissions on UNIX-compatible systems.

       ERF_RECORDS_TO_CHECK
           This environment variable controls the number of ERF records checked when deciding if a file really
           is in the ERF format. Setting this environment variable a number higher than the default (20) would
           make false positives less likely.

       IPFIX_RECORDS_TO_CHECK
           This environment variable controls the number of IPFIX records checked when deciding if a file really
           is in the IPFIX format. Setting this environment variable a number higher than the default (20) would
           make false positives less likely.

       WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_DISSECTOR_BUG
           If this environment variable is set, <b>TShark</b> will call <a href="../man3/abort.3.html">abort</a>(3) when a dissector bug is encountered.
           <a href="../man3/abort.3.html">abort</a>(3) will cause the program to exit abnormally; if you are running <b>TShark</b> in a debugger, it
           should halt in the debugger and allow inspection of the process, and, if you are not running it in a
           debugger, it will, on some OSes, assuming your environment is configured correctly, generate a core
           dump file. This can be useful to developers attempting to troubleshoot a problem with a protocol
           dissector.

       WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_TOO_MANY_ITEMS
           If this environment variable is set, <b>TShark</b> will call <a href="../man3/abort.3.html">abort</a>(3) if a dissector tries to add too many
           items to a tree (generally this is an indication of the dissector not breaking out of a loop soon
           enough). <a href="../man3/abort.3.html">abort</a>(3) will cause the program to exit abnormally; if you are running <b>TShark</b> in a debugger,
           it should halt in the debugger and allow inspection of the process, and, if you are not running it in
           a debugger, it will, on some OSes, assuming your environment is configured correctly, generate a core
           dump file. This can be useful to developers attempting to troubleshoot a problem with a protocol
           dissector.

       WIRESHARK_LOG_LEVEL
           This environment variable controls the verbosity of diagnostic messages to the console. From less
           verbose to most verbose levels can be critical, warning, message, info, debug or noisy. Levels above
           the current level are also active. Levels critical and error are always active.

       WIRESHARK_LOG_FATAL
           Sets the fatal log level. Fatal log levels cause the program to abort. This level can be set to
           Error, critical or warning. Error is always fatal and is the default.

       WIRESHARK_LOG_DOMAINS
           This environment variable selects which log domains are active. The filter is given as a
           case-insensitive comma separated list. If set only the included domains will be enabled. The default
           domain is always considered to be enabled. Domain filter lists can be preceded by '!' to invert the
           sense of the match.

       WIRESHARK_LOG_DEBUG
           List of domains with debug log level. This sets the level of the provided log domains and takes
           precedence over the active domains filter. If preceded by '!' this disables the debug level instead.

       WIRESHARK_LOG_NOISY
           Same as above but for noisy log level instead.
