</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Wireshark</b> is a GUI network protocol analyzer. It lets you interactively browse packet data from a live
       network or from a previously saved capture file. <b>Wireshark</b>'s native capture file formats are <b>pcapng</b>
       format and <b>pcap</b> format; it can read and write both formats.. <b>pcap</b> format is also the format used by
       <b>tcpdump</b> and various other tools; <b>tcpdump</b>, when using newer versions of the <b>libpcap</b> library, can also read
       some pcapng files, and, on newer versions of macOS, can read all pcapng files and can write them as well.

       <b>Wireshark</b> can also read / import the following file formats:

       There is no need to tell <b>Wireshark</b> what type of file you are reading; it will determine the file type by
       itself. <b>Wireshark</b> is also capable of reading any of these file formats if they are compressed using gzip,
       LZ4, or Zstandard, if compiled with the appropriate support. <b>Wireshark</b> recognizes this directly from the
       file; the '.gz' or other extension is not required for this purpose.

       Like other protocol analyzers, <b>Wireshark</b>'s main window shows 3 views of a packet. It shows a summary
       line, briefly describing what the packet is. A packet details display is shown, allowing you to drill
       down to exact protocol or field that you interested in. Finally, a hex dump shows you exactly what the
       packet looks like when it goes over the wire.

       In addition, <b>Wireshark</b> has some features that make it unique. It can assemble all the packets in a TCP
       conversation and show you the ASCII (or EBCDIC, or hex) data in that conversation. Display filters in
       <b>Wireshark</b> are very powerful; more fields are filterable in <b>Wireshark</b> than in other protocol analyzers,
       and the syntax you can use to create your filters is richer. As <b>Wireshark</b> progresses, expect more and
       more protocol fields to be allowed in display filters.

       Packet capturing is performed with the pcap library. The capture filter syntax follows the rules of the
       pcap library. This syntax is different from the display filter syntax.

       Compressed file support uses (and therefore requires) the zlib library. If the zlib library is not
       present, <b>Wireshark</b> will compile, but will be unable to read compressed files.

       The pathname of a capture file to be read can be specified with the <b>-r</b> option or can be specified as a
       command-line argument.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Most users will want to start <b>Wireshark</b> without options and configure it from the menus instead. Those
       users may just skip this section.

       -a|--autostop  &lt;capture autostop condition&gt;

           Specify a criterion that specifies when <b>Wireshark</b> is to stop writing to a capture file. The criterion
           is of the form <u>test:value</u>, where <u>test</u> is one of:

           <b>duration</b>:<u>value</u> Stop writing to a capture file after <u>value</u> seconds have elapsed. Floating point values
           (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.

           <b>files</b>:<u>value</u> Stop writing to capture files after <u>value</u> number of files were written.

           <b>filesize</b>:<u>value</u> Stop writing to a capture file after it reaches a size of <u>value</u> kB. If this option is
           used together with the -b option, Wireshark will stop writing to the current capture file and switch
           to the next one if filesize is reached. Note that the filesize is limited to a maximum value of 2 TB,
           although you might have problems viewing the file in the GUI before then if the number of packets
           exceeds 231 (2147483648).

           <b>packets</b>:<u>value</u> Stop writing to a capture file after it contains <u>value</u> packets. Acts the same as
           <b>-c</b>&lt;capture packet count&gt;.

       -b|--ring-buffer  &lt;capture ring buffer option&gt;

           Cause <b>Wireshark</b> to run in "multiple files" mode. In "multiple files" mode, <b>Wireshark</b> will write to
           several capture files. When the first capture file fills up, <b>Wireshark</b> will switch writing to the
           next file and so on.

           The created filenames are based on the filename given with the <b>-w</b> flag, the number of the file and on
           the creation date and time, e.g. outfile_00001_20250714120117.pcap,
           outfile_00002_20250714120523.pcap, ...

           With the <u>files</u> option it’s also possible to form a "ring buffer". This will fill up new files until
           the number of files specified, at which point <b>Wireshark</b> will discard the data in the first file and
           start writing to that file and so on. If the <u>files</u> option is not set, new files filled up until one
           of the capture stop conditions match (or until the disk is full).

           The criterion is of the form <u>key:value</u>, where <u>key</u> is one of:

           <b>duration</b>:<u>value</u> switch to the next file after <u>value</u> seconds have elapsed, even if the current file is
           not completely filled up. Floating point values (e.g. 0.5) are allowed.

           <b>files</b>:<u>value</u> begin again with the first file after <u>value</u> number of files were written (form a ring
           buffer). This value must be less than 100000. Caution should be used when using large numbers of
           files: some filesystems do not handle many files in a single directory well. The <b>files</b> criterion
           requires one of the other criteria to be specified to control when to go to the next file. It should
           be noted that each <b>-b</b> parameter takes exactly one criterion; to specify two criteria, each must be
           preceded by the <b>-b</b> option.

           <b>filesize</b>:<u>value</u> switch to the next file after it reaches a size of <u>value</u> kB. Note that the filesize is
           limited to a maximum value of 2 TB, although you might have problems viewing the file in the GUI
           before then if the number of packets exceeds 231 (2147483648).

           <b>interval</b>:<u>value</u> switch to the next file when the time is an exact multiple of <u>value</u> seconds.

           <b>packets</b>:<u>value</u> switch to the next file after it contains <u>value</u> packets.

           Example: <b>-b</b> <b>filesize:1000</b> <b>-b</b> <b>files:5</b> results in a ring buffer of five files of size one megabyte
           each.

       -B|--buffer-size  &lt;capture buffer size&gt;

           Set capture buffer size (in MiB, default is 2 MiB). This is used by the capture driver to buffer
           packet data until that data can be written to disk. If you encounter packet drops while capturing,
           try to increase this size. Note that, while <b>Wireshark</b> attempts to set the buffer size to 2 MiB by
           default, and can be told to set it to a larger value, the system or interface on which you’re
           capturing might silently limit the capture buffer size to a lower value or raise it to a higher
           value.

           This is available on UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, with
           libpcap 1.0.0 or later, and on Windows. It is not available on UNIX-compatible systems with earlier
           versions of libpcap.

           This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first occurrence of the <b>-i</b> option, it sets
           the default capture buffer size. If used after an <b>-i</b> option, it sets the capture buffer size for the
           interface specified by the last <b>-i</b> option occurring before this option. If the capture buffer size is
           not set specifically, the default capture buffer size is used instead.

       -c  &lt;capture packet count&gt;

           Set the maximum number of packets to read when capturing live data. Acts the same as <b>-a</b>
           <b>packets:</b>&lt;capture packet count&gt;.

       -C  &lt;configuration profile&gt;

           Start with the given configuration profile.

       --capture-comment &lt;comment&gt;

           When performing a capture file from the command line, with the <b>-k</b> flag, add a capture comment to the
           output file, if supported by the capture format.

           This option may be specified multiple times. Note that Wireshark currently only displays the first
           comment of a capture file.

       -D|--list-interfaces

           Print a list of the interfaces on which <b>Wireshark</b> can capture, and exit. For each network interface,
           a number and an interface name, possibly followed by a text description of the interface, is printed.
           The interface name or the number can be supplied to the <b>-i</b> flag to specify an interface on which to
           capture. The number can be useful on Windows systems, where the interfaces have long names that
           usually contain a GUID.

       --display &lt;X display to use&gt;

           Specifies the X display to use. A hostname and screen (otherhost:0.0) or just a screen (:0.0) can be
           specified. This option is not available under macOS or Windows.

       -f  &lt;capture filter&gt;

           Set the capture filter expression.

           This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first occurrence of the <b>-i</b> option, it sets
           the default capture filter expression. If used after an <b>-i</b> option, it sets the capture filter
           expression for the interface specified by the last <b>-i</b> option occurring before this option. If the
           capture filter expression is not set specifically, the default capture filter expression is used if
           provided.

           Pre-defined capture filter names, as shown in the GUI menu item Capture→Capture Filters, can be used
           by prefixing the argument with "predef:". Example: <b>-f</b> <b>"predef:MyPredefinedHostOnlyFilter"</b>

       -F  &lt;file format&gt;
           When performing a capture file from the command line, with the <b>-k</b> option, set the file format of the
           output capture file written using the <b>-w</b> option. In situations that require the <b>pcapng</b> format, such
           as capturing from multiple interfaces, this option will be overridden. The option <b>-F</b> without a value
           will list the available formats. The default is the <b>pcapng</b> format (unless the default has been
           changed in preferences.)

       This does not support every format to which Wireshark can convert a file; this is intentional for
       security reasons. Capture in a supported format and then save the file in a different format if so
       desired.

       --fullscreen

           Start Wireshark in full screen mode (kiosk mode). To exit from fullscreen mode, open the View menu
           and select the Full Screen option. Alternatively, press the F11 key (or Ctrl + Cmd + F for macOS).

       -g  &lt;packet number&gt;
           After reading in a capture file using the <b>-r</b> flag, go to the given <u>packet</u> <u>number</u>.

       -h|--help
           Print the version number and options and exit.

       -H
           Hide the capture info dialog during live packet capture.

       -i|--interface  &lt;capture interface&gt;|-

           Set the name of the network interface or pipe to use for live packet capture.

           Network interface names should match one of the names listed in "<b>wireshark</b> <b>-D</b>" (described above); a
           number, as reported by "<b>tshark</b> <b>-D</b>", can also be used.

           If no interface is specified, <b>Wireshark</b> searches the list of interfaces, choosing the first
           non-loopback interface if there are any non-loopback interfaces, and choosing the first loopback
           interface if there are no non-loopback interfaces. If there are no interfaces at all, <b>Wireshark</b>
           reports an error and doesn’t start the capture.

           Pipe names should be either the name of a FIFO (named pipe) or "-" to read data from the standard
           input. On Windows systems, pipe names must be of the form "\\.\pipe\<b>pipename</b>". Data read from pipes
           must be in standard pcapng or pcap format. Pcapng data must have the same endianness as the capturing
           host.

           "TCP@&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;" causes <b>Wireshark</b> to attempt to connect to the specified port on the specified
           host and read pcapng or pcap data.

           This option can occur multiple times. When capturing from multiple interfaces, the capture file will
           be saved in pcapng format.

       -I|--monitor-mode

           Put the interface in "monitor mode"; this is supported only on IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi interfaces, and
           supported only on some operating systems.

           Note that in monitor mode the adapter might disassociate from the network with which it’s associated,
           so that you will not be able to use any wireless networks with that adapter. This could prevent
           accessing files on a network server, or resolving host names or network addresses, if you are
           capturing in monitor mode and are not connected to another network with another adapter.

           This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first occurrence of the <b>-i</b> option, it
           enables the monitor mode for all interfaces. If used after an <b>-i</b> option, it enables the monitor mode
           for the interface specified by the last <b>-i</b> option occurring before this option.

       -j
           Use after <b>-J</b> to change the behavior when no exact match is found for the filter. With this option
           select the first packet before.

       -J  &lt;jump filter&gt;

           After reading in a capture file using the <b>-r</b> flag, jump to the packet matching the filter (display
           filter syntax). If no exact match is found the first packet after that is selected.

       -k

           Start the capture session immediately. If the <b>-i</b> flag was specified, the capture uses the specified
           interface. Otherwise, <b>Wireshark</b> searches the list of interfaces, choosing the first non-loopback
           interface if there are any non-loopback interfaces, and choosing the first loopback interface if
           there are no non-loopback interfaces; if there are no interfaces, <b>Wireshark</b> reports an error and
           doesn’t start the capture.

       -l
           Turn on automatic scrolling if the packet display is being updated automatically as packets arrive
           during a capture (as specified by the <b>-S</b> flag).

       -L|--list-data-link-types
           List the data link types supported by the interface and exit.

       --list-time-stamp-types
           List time stamp types supported for the interface. If no time stamp type can be set, no time stamp
           types are listed.

       -o  &lt;preference/recent setting&gt;

           Set a preference or recent value, overriding the default value and any value read from a
           preference/recent file. The argument to the flag is a string of the form <u>prefname:value</u>, where
           <u>prefname</u> is the name of the preference/recent value (which is the same name that would appear in the
           preference/recent file), and <u>value</u> is the value to which it should be set. Since <b>Ethereal</b> 0.10.12,
           the recent settings replaces the formerly used -B, -P and -T flags to manipulate the GUI dimensions.

           If <u>prefname</u> is "uat", you can override settings in various user access tables using the form "uat:<u>uat</u>
           <u>filename</u>:<u>uat</u> <u>record</u>". <u>uat</u> <u>filename</u> must be the name of a UAT file, e.g. <u>user_dlts</u>. <u>uat_record</u> must be
           in the form of a valid record for that file, including quotes. For instance, to specify a user DLT
           from the command line, you would use

               -o "uat:user_dlts:\"User 0 (DLT=147)\",\"cops\",\"0\",\"\",\"0\",\"\""

       -p|--no-promiscuous-mode

           <u>Don’t</u> put the interface into promiscuous mode. Note that the interface might be in promiscuous mode
           for some other reason; hence, <b>-p</b> cannot be used to ensure that the only traffic that is captured is
           traffic sent to or from the machine on which <b>Wireshark</b> is running, broadcast traffic, and multicast
           traffic to addresses received by that machine.

           This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first occurrence of the <b>-i</b> option, no
           interface will be put into the promiscuous mode. If used after an <b>-i</b> option, the interface specified
           by the last <b>-i</b> option occurring before this option will not be put into the promiscuous mode.

       -P &lt;path setting&gt;

           Special path settings usually detected automatically. This is used for special cases, e.g. starting
           Wireshark from a known location on an USB stick.

           The criterion is of the form <u>key:path</u>, where <u>key</u> is one of:

           <b>persconf</b>:<u>path</u> path of personal configuration files, like the preferences files.

           <b>persdata</b>:<u>path</u> path of personal data files, it’s the folder initially opened. After the very first
           initialization, the recent file will keep the folder last used.

       -r|--read-file  &lt;infile&gt;

           Read packet data from <u>infile</u>, can be any supported capture file format (including compressed files).
           It’s not possible to use named pipes or stdin here, unlike <b>TShark</b>! To capture from a pipe or from
           stdin use <b>-i</b> <b>-</b>.

       -R|--read-filter  &lt;read (display) filter&gt;

           When reading a capture file specified with the <b>-r</b> flag, causes the specified filter (which uses the
           syntax of display filters, rather than that of capture filters) to be applied to all packets read
           from the capture file; packets not matching the filter are discarded.

       -s|--snapshot-length  &lt;capture snaplen&gt;

           Set the default snapshot length to use when capturing live data. No more than <u>snaplen</u> bytes of each
           network packet will be read into memory, or saved to disk. A value of 0 specifies a snapshot length
           of 262144, so that the full packet is captured; this is the default.

           This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first occurrence of the <b>-i</b> option, it sets
           the default snapshot length. If used after an <b>-i</b> option, it sets the snapshot length for the
           interface specified by the last <b>-i</b> option occurring before this option. If the snapshot length is not
           set specifically, the default snapshot length is used if provided.

       -S
           Automatically update the packet display as packets are coming in.

       --temp-dir &lt;directory&gt;

           Specifies the directory into which temporary files (including capture files) are to be written. The
           default behavior on UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, is to use
           the environment variable <u>$TMPDIR</u> if set, and the system default, typically <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>, if it is not. On
           Windows, the <u>%TEMP%</u> environment variable is used, which typically defaults to
           <u>%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp</u>.

       --time-stamp-type &lt;type&gt;
           Change the interface’s timestamp method. See --list-time-stamp-types.

       --update-interval  &lt;interval&gt;
           Set the length of time in milliseconds between new packet reports during a capture. Also sets the
           granularity of file duration conditions. The default value is 100ms.

       -v|--version
           Print the full version information and exit.

       -w  &lt;outfile&gt;
           Set the default capture file name, or '-' for standard output.

       -X &lt;eXtension options&gt;

           Specify an option to be passed to an <b>Wireshark</b> module. The eXtension option is in the form
           <u>extension_key:value</u>, where <u>extension_key</u> can be:

           <b>lua_script</b>:<u>lua_script_filename</u> tells <b>Wireshark</b> to load the given script in addition to the default
           Lua scripts.

           <b>lua_script</b><u>num</u>:<u>argument</u> tells <b>Wireshark</b> to pass the given argument to the lua script identified by
           'num', which is the number indexed order of the 'lua_script' command. For example, if only one script
           was loaded with '-X lua_script:my.lua', then '-X lua_script1:foo' will pass the string 'foo' to the
           'my.lua' script. If two scripts were loaded, such as '-X lua_script:my.lua' and '-X
           lua_script:other.lua' in that order, then a '-X lua_script2:bar' would pass the string 'bar' to the
           second lua script, namely 'other.lua'.

           <b>read_format</b>:<u>file_format</u> tells <b>Wireshark</b> to use the given file format to read in the file (the file
           given in the <b>-r</b> command option).

           <b>stdin_descr</b>:<u>description</u> tells <b>Wireshark</b> to use the given description when capturing from standard
           input (<b>-i</b> <b>-</b>).

       -y|--linktype  &lt;capture link type&gt;

           If a capture is started from the command line with <b>-k</b>, set the data link type to use while capturing
           packets. The values reported by <b>-L</b> are the values that can be used.

           This option can occur multiple times. If used before the first occurrence of the <b>-i</b> option, it sets
           the default capture link type. If used after an <b>-i</b> option, it sets the capture link type for the
           interface specified by the last <b>-i</b> option occurring before this option. If the capture link type is
           not set specifically, the default capture link type is used if provided.

       -Y|--display-filter  &lt;displaY filter&gt;
           Start with the given display filter.

       -z  &lt;statistics&gt;

           Get <b>Wireshark</b> to collect various types of statistics and display the result in a window that updates

           Create a table that lists all conversations that could be seen in the capture. <u>type</u> specifies the
           conversation endpoint types for which we want to generate the statistics; currently the supported
           ones are:

               "eth"   Ethernet addresses
               "fc"    Fibre Channel addresses
               "fddi"  FDDI addresses
               "ip"    IPv4 addresses
               "ipv6"  IPv6 addresses
               "ipx"   IPX addresses
               "tcp"   TCP/IP socket pairs   Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported
               "tr"    Token Ring addresses
               "udp"   UDP/IP socket pairs   Both IPv4 and IPv6 are supported

           If the optional <u>filter</u> is specified, only those packets that match the filter will be used in the
           calculations.

           The table is presented with one line for each conversation and displays the number of packets/bytes
           in each direction as well as the total number of packets/bytes. By default, the table is sorted
           according to the total number of packets.

           These tables can also be generated at runtime by selecting the appropriate conversation type from the
           menu "Tools/Statistics/Conversation List/".

</pre><h4><b>DISSECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -d  &lt;layer type&gt;==&lt;selector&gt;,&lt;decode-as protocol&gt;

           Like Wireshark’s <b>Decode</b> <b>As...</b> feature, this lets you specify how a layer type should be dissected. If
           the layer type in question (for example, <b>tcp.port</b> or <b>udp.port</b> for a TCP or UDP port number) has the
           specified selector value, packets should be dissected as the specified protocol.

           <b>Example</b> <b>1.</b> <b>Decode</b> <b>As</b> <b>Port</b>

               <b>-d</b> <b>tcp.port==8888,http</b> will decode any traffic running over TCP port 8888 as HTTP.

       --disable-protocol &lt;proto_name&gt;[,&lt;proto_name&gt;,...]
           Disable dissection of proto_name. Use a proto_name of <b>ALL</b> to override your chosen profile’s default
           enabled protocol list and temporarily disable all protocols.

       --disable-heuristic &lt;short_name&gt;
           Disable dissection of heuristic protocol.

       --enable-protocol &lt;proto_name&gt;[,&lt;proto_name&gt;,...]

           Enable dissection of proto_name. Use a proto_name of <b>ALL</b> to override your chosen profile’s default
           disabled protocol list and temporarily enable all protocols which are enabled by default.

           If a protocol is implicated in both <b>--disable-protocol</b> and <b>--enable-protocol</b>, the protocol is
           enabled. This allows you to temporarily disable all protocols but a list of exceptions. Example:
           <b>--disable-protocol</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>--enable-protocol</b> <b>eth,ip</b>

       --enable-heuristic &lt;short_name&gt;
           Enable dissection of heuristic protocol.

       -K  &lt;keytab&gt;

           Example: <b>-K</b> <b>krb5.keytab</b>

       -n
           Disable network object name resolution (such as hostname, TCP and UDP port names); the <b>-N</b> option
           might override this one.

       -N  &lt;name resolving flags&gt;

           Turn on name resolving only for particular types of addresses and port numbers, with name resolving
           for other types of addresses and port numbers turned off. This option (along with <b>-n</b>) can be
           specified multiple times; the last value given overrides earlier ones. This option and <b>-n</b> override
           the options from the preferences, including preferences set via the <b>-o</b> option. If both <b>-N</b> and <b>-n</b>
           options are not present, the values from the preferences are used, which default to <b>-N</b> <b>dmN</b>.

           The argument is a string that may contain the letters:

           <b>d</b> to enable resolution from captured DNS packets

           <b>g</b> to enable IP address geolocation information lookup from configured MaxMind databases

           <b>m</b> to enable MAC address resolution

           <b>n</b> to enable network address resolution

           <b>ud</b> UTC with date: The absolute date, displayed as YYYY-MM-DD, and time, as UTC, is the actual time
           and date the packet was captured

           <b>udoy</b> UTC with date using day of year: The absolute date, displayed as YYYY/DOY, and time, as UTC, is
           the actual time and date the packet was captured

           <b>.[N]</b> Set the precision: N is the number of decimals (0 through 9). If using "." without N,
           automatically determine precision from trace.

           The default format is relative with precision based on capture format.

       -u &lt;s|hms&gt;

           Specifies how packet timestamp formats in <b>-t</b> which are relative times (i.e. relative, delta, and
           delta_displayed) are displayed. Valid choices are:

           <b>s</b> for seconds

           <b>hms</b> for hours, minutes, and seconds

           The default format is seconds.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTIC</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --log-level &lt;level&gt;
           Set the active log level. Supported levels in lowest to highest order are "noisy", "debug", "info",
           "message", "warning", "critical", and "error". Messages at each level and higher will be printed, for
           example "warning" prints "warning", "critical", and "error" messages and "noisy" prints all messages.
           Levels are case insensitive.

       --log-fatal &lt;level&gt;
           Abort the program if any messages are logged at the specified level or higher. For example, "warning"
           aborts on any "warning", "critical", or "error" messages.

       --log-domains &lt;list&gt;
           Only print messages for the specified log domains, e.g. "GUI,Epan,sshdump". List of domains must be
           comma-separated. Can be negated with "!" as the first character (inverts the match).

       --log-debug &lt;list&gt;
           Force the specified domains to log at the "debug" level. List of domains must be comma-separated. Can
           be negated with "!" as the first character (inverts the match).

       --log-noisy &lt;list&gt;
           Force the specified domains to log at the "noisy" level. List of domains must be comma-separated. Can
           be negated with "!" as the first character (inverts the match).

       --log-fatal-domains &lt;list&gt;
           Abort the program if any messages are logged for the specified log domains. List of domains must be
           comma-separated.

       --log-file &lt;path&gt;
           Write log messages and stderr output to the specified file.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       These files contain various <b>Wireshark</b> configuration settings.

       Preferences

           The <u>preferences</u> files contain global (system-wide) and personal preference settings. If the
           system-wide preference file exists, it is read first, overriding the default settings. If the
           personal preferences file exists, it is read next, overriding any previous values. Note: If the
           command line flag <b>-o</b> is used (possibly more than once), it will in turn override values from the
           preferences files.

           The preferences settings are in the form <u>prefname:value</u>, one per line, where <u>prefname</u> is the name of
           the preference and <u>value</u> is the value to which it should be set; white space is allowed between <b>:</b> and
           <u>value</u>. A preference setting can be continued on subsequent lines by indenting the continuation lines
           with white space. A <b>#</b> character starts a comment that runs to the end of the line:

               # Vertical scrollbars should be on right side?
               # TRUE or FALSE (case-insensitive).
               gui.scrollbar_on_right: TRUE

           The global preferences file is looked for in the <u>wireshark</u> directory under the <u>share</u> subdirectory of
           the main installation directory. On macOS, this would typically be
           <u>/Application/Wireshark.app/Contents/Resources/share</u>; on other UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux,
           \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, this would typically be <u>/usr/share/wireshark/preferences</u> for
           system-installed packages and <u>/usr/local/share/wireshark/preferences</u> for locally-installed packages;
           on Windows, this would typically be <u>C:\Program</u> <u>Files\Wireshark\preferences</u>.

           On UNIX-compatible systems, the personal preferences file is looked for in
           <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark/preferences</u>, (or, if <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark</u> does not exist while
           <u>$HOME/.wireshark</u> does exist, <u>$HOME/.wireshark/preferences</u>); this is typically
           <u>$HOME/.config/wireshark/preferences</u>. On Windows, the personal preferences file is looked for in
           <u>%APPDATA%\Wireshark\preferences</u> (or, if %APPDATA% isn’t defined, <u>%USERPROFILE%\Application</u>
           <u>Data\Wireshark\preferences</u>).

           Note: Whenever the preferences are saved by using the <u>Save</u> button in the <u>Edit:Preferences</u> dialog box,
           your personal preferences file will be overwritten with the new settings, destroying any comments and
           unknown/obsolete settings that were in the file.

       Recent

           The <u>recent</u> file contains personal settings (mostly GUI related) such as the current <b>Wireshark</b> window
           size. The file is saved at program exit and read in at program start automatically. Note: The command
           line flag <b>-o</b> may be used to override settings from this file.

           The settings in this file have the same format as in the <u>preferences</u> files, and the same directory as
           for the personal preferences file is used.

           Note: Whenever Wireshark is closed, your recent file will be overwritten with the new settings,
           destroying any comments and unknown/obsolete settings that were in the file.

       Disabled (Enabled) Protocols

           The <u>disabled_protos</u> files contain system-wide and personal lists of protocols that have been
           disabled, so that their dissectors are never called. The files contain protocol names, one per line,
           where the protocol name is the same name that would be used in a display filter for the protocol:

               http
               tcp     # a comment

           If a protocol is listed in the global <u>disabled_protos</u> file it cannot be enabled by the user. Thus it
           is not displayed in the <u>Analyze::Enabled</u> <u>Protocols</u> dialog box.

           The global <u>disabled_protos</u> file uses the same directory as the global preferences file.

           The personal <u>disabled_protos</u> file uses the same directory as the personal preferences file.

           The <u>disabled_protos</u> files list only protocols that are enabled by default but have been disabled;
           protocols that are disabled by default (such as some postdissectors) are not listed. There are
           analogous <u>enabled_protos</u> files for protocols that are disabled by default but have been enabled.

           Note: Whenever the disabled protocols list is saved by using the <u>Save</u> button in the <u>Analyze:Enabled</u>
           <u>Protocols</u> dialog box, your personal disabled protocols file will be overwritten with the new
           settings, destroying any comments that were in the file.

       Heuristic Dissectors

           The <u>heuristic_protos</u> files contain system-wide and personal lists of heuristic dissectors and
           indicate whether they are enabled or disabled. The files contain heuristic dissector unique short
           names, one per line, followed by a comma and 0 for disabled and 1 for enabled:

               quic,1
               rtcp_stun,1
               rtcp_udp,1
               rtp_stun,0
               rtp_udp,0
               tls_tcp,1

           The global <u>heuristic_protos</u> file uses the same directory as the global preferences file.

           The personal <u>heuristic_protos</u> file uses the same directory as the personal preferences file.

       Name Resolution (hosts)

           Entries in <u>hosts</u> files in the global and personal preferences directory are used to resolve IPv4 and
           IPv6 addresses before any other attempts are made to resolve them. The file has the standard <u>hosts</u>
           file syntax; each line contains one IP address and name, separated by whitespace. The personal <u>hosts</u>
           file, if present, overrides the one in the global directory.

           Capture filter name resolution is handled by libpcap on UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux,
           macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, and Npcap or WinPcap on Windows. As such the Wireshark personal <u>hosts</u>
           file will not be consulted for capture filter name resolution.

       Name Resolution (subnets)

           If an IPv4 address cannot be translated via name resolution (no exact match is found) then a partial
           match is attempted via the <u>subnets</u> file. Both the global <u>subnets</u> file and personal <u>subnets</u> files are
           used if they exist.

           Each line of this file consists of an IPv4 address, a subnet mask length separated only by a / and a
           name separated by whitespace. While the address must be a full IPv4 address, any values beyond the
           mask length are subsequently ignored.

           An example is:

           # Comments must be prepended by the # sign! 192.168.0.0/24 ws_test_network

           A partially matched name will be printed as "subnet-name.remaining-address". For example,
           "192.168.0.1" under the subnet above would be printed as "ws_test_network.1"; if the mask length
           above had been 16 rather than 24, the printed address would be "ws_test_network.0.1".

       Name Resolution (ethers)

           The <u>ethers</u> files are consulted to correlate 6-byte hardware addresses to names. First the personal
           <u>ethers</u> file is tried and if an address is not found there the global <u>ethers</u> file is tried next.

           Each line contains one hardware address and name, separated by whitespace. The digits of the hardware
           address are separated by colons (:), dashes (-) or periods (.). The same separator character must be
           used consistently in an address. The following three lines are valid lines of an <u>ethers</u> file:

               ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff          Broadcast
               c0-00-ff-ff-ff-ff          TR_broadcast
               00.00.00.00.00.00          Zero_broadcast

           The global <u>ethers</u> file is looked for in the <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u> directory on UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux,
           macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, and in the main installation directory (for example, <u>C:\Program</u>
           <u>Files\Wireshark</u>) on Windows systems.

           The personal <u>ethers</u> file is looked for in the same directory as the personal preferences file.

           Capture filter name resolution is handled by libpcap on UNIX-compatible systems and Npcap or WinPcap
           on Windows. As such the Wireshark personal <u>ethers</u> file will not be consulted for capture filter name
           resolution.

       Name Resolution (manuf)

           The <u>manuf</u> file is used to match the 3-byte vendor portion of a 6-byte hardware address with the
           manufacturer’s name; it can also contain well-known MAC addresses and address ranges specified with a
           netmask. The format of the file is similar the <u>ethers</u> files, except that entries such as:

               00:00:0C      Cisco     Cisco Systems, Inc

           can be provided, with the 3-byte OUI and both an abbreviated and long name for a vendor, and entries
           such as:

               00-00-0C-07-AC/40     All-HSRP-routers

           can be specified, with a MAC address and a mask indicating how many bits of the address must match.
           The above entry, for example, has 40 significant bits, or 5 bytes, and would match addresses from
           00-00-0C-07-AC-00 through 00-00-0C-07-AC-FF. The mask need not be a multiple of 8.

           A global <u>manuf</u> file is looked for in the same directory as the global preferences file, and a
           personal <u>manuf</u> file is looked for in the same directory as the personal preferences file.

           In earlier versions of Wireshark, official information from the IEEE Registration Authority was
           distributed in this format as the global <u>manuf</u> file. This information is now compiled in to speed
           program startup, but the internal information can be written out in this format with <b>tshark</b> <b>-G</b> <b>manuf</b>.

           In addition to the <u>manuf</u> file, another file with the same format, <u>wka</u>, is looked for in the global
           directory. This file is distributed with Wireshark, and contains data about well-known MAC adddresses
           and address ranges assembled from various non IEEE but respected sources.

       Name Resolution (services)

           The <u>services</u> file is used to translate port numbers into names. Both the global <u>services</u> file and
           personal <u>services</u> files are used if they exist.

           The file has the standard <u>services</u> file syntax; each line contains one (service) name and one
           transport identifier separated by white space. The transport identifier includes one port number and
           one transport protocol name (typically tcp, udp, or sctp) separated by a <a href="file:/.">/.</a>

           An example is:

           mydns       5045/udp     # My own Domain Name Server mydns       5045/tcp     # My own Domain Name
           Server

           In earlier versions of Wireshark, official information from the IANA Registry was distributed in this
           format as the global <u>services</u> file. This information is now compiled in to speed program startup, but
           the internal information can be written out in this format with <b>tshark</b> <b>-G</b> <b>services</b>.

       Name Resolution (ipxnets)

           The <u>ipxnets</u> files are used to correlate 4-byte IPX network numbers to names. First the global <u>ipxnets</u>
           file is tried and if that address is not found there the personal one is tried next.

           The format is the same as the <u>ethers</u> file, except that each address is four bytes instead of six.
           Additionally, the address can be represented as a single hexadecimal number, as is more common in the
           IPX world, rather than four hex octets. For example, these four lines are valid lines of an <u>ipxnets</u>
           file:

               C0.A8.2C.00              HR
               c0-a8-1c-00              CEO
               00:00:BE:EF              IT_Server1
               110f                     FileServer3

           The global <u>ipxnets</u> file is looked for in the <u><a href="file:/etc">/etc</a></u> directory on UNIX-compatible systems, such as
           Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, and in the main installation directory (for example,
           <u>C:\Program</u> <u>Files\Wireshark</u>) on Windows systems.

           The personal <u>ipxnets</u> file is looked for in the same directory as the personal preferences file.

       Name Resolution (ss7pcs)

           The <u>ss7pcs</u> file is used to translate SS7 point codes to names. It is read from the personal
           configuration directory.

           Each line in this file consists of one network indicator followed by a dash followed by a point code
           in decimal and a node name separated by whitespace. An example is:

               2-1234 MyPointCode1

       Name Resolution (vlans)

           The <u>vlans</u> file is used to translate VLAN tag IDs into names. It is read from the personal
           configuration directory.

           Each line in this file consists of one VLAN tag ID separated by whitespace from a name. An example
           is:

               123    Server-Lan
               2049   HR-Client-LAN

       Capture Filters

           The <u>cfilters</u> files contain system-wide and personal capture filters. Each line contains one filter,
           starting with the string displayed in the dialog box in quotation marks, followed by the filter
           string itself:

               "HTTP" port 80
               "DCERPC" port 135

           The global <u>cfilters</u> file uses the same directory as the global preferences file.

           The personal <u>cfilters</u> file uses the same directory as the personal preferences file. It is written
           through the Capture:Capture Filters dialog.

           If the global <u>cfilters</u> file exists, it is used only if the personal <u>cfilters</u> file does not exist;
           global and personal capture filters are not merged.

       Display Filters

           The <u>dfilters</u> files contain system-wide and personal display filters. Each line contains one filter,
           starting with the string displayed in the dialog box in quotation marks, followed by the filter
           string itself:

               "HTTP" http
               "DCERPC" dcerpc

           The global <u>dfilters</u> file uses the same directory as the global preferences file.

           The personal <u>dfilters</u> file uses the same directory as the personal preferences file. It is written
           through the Analyze:Display Filters dialog.

           If the global <u>dfilters</u> file exists, it is used only if the personal <u>dfilters</u> file does not exist;
           global and personal display filters are not merged.

       Display Filter Macros

           The <u>dmacros</u> files contain system-wide and personal display filter macros. Each line contains one
           filter, starting with the string displayed in the dialog box in quotation marks, followed by the
           macro expression itself:

               "private_ipv6" ipv6 &amp;&amp; $1 == fc00::/7
               "private_ethernet" $1[0] &amp; 0x0F == 2
               "private_ipv4" $1 == 192.168.0.0/16 or $1 == 172.16.0.0/12 or $1 == 10.0.0.0/8

           The global <u>dmacros</u> file uses the same directory as the global preferences file.

           The personal <u>dmacros</u> file uses the same directory as the personal preferences file. It is written
           through the Analyze:Display Filter Macros dialog.

           If the global <u>dmacros</u> file exists, it is used only if the personal <u>dmacros</u> file does not exist;
           global and personal display filters are not merged.

           Prior to Wireshark 4.4, a <u>dfilter_macros</u> file with a somewhat different syntax was used. That file is
           looked for at startup if a <u>dmacros</u> file is not found and used to migrate to the new format.

       Color Filters (Coloring Rules)

           The <u>colorfilters</u> files contain system-wide and personal color filters. Each line contains one filter,
           starting with the string displayed in the dialog box, followed by the corresponding display filter.
           Then the background and foreground colors are appended:

               # a comment
               @tcp@tcp@[59345,58980,65534][0,0,0]
               @udp@udp@[28834,57427,65533][0,0,0]

           The global <u>colorfilters</u> file uses the same directory as the global preferences file.

           The personal <u>colorfilters</u> file uses the same directory as the personal preferences file. It is
           written through the View:Coloring Rules dialog.

           If the global <u>colorfilters</u> file exists, it is used only if the personal <u>colorfilters</u> file does not
           exist; global and personal color filters are not merged.

       Plugins

           Wireshark looks for plugins in both a personal plugin folder and a global plugin folder.

           On UNIX-compatible systems, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, the global plugin
           directory is <u>lib/wireshark/plugins/</u> (on some systems substitute <u>lib64</u> for <u>lib</u>) under the main
           installation directory (for example, <u>/usr/local/lib/wireshark/plugins/</u>). The personal plugin
           directory is <u>$HOME/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins</u>.

           On macOS, if Wireshark is installed as an application bundle, the global plugin folder is instead
           <u>%APPDIR%/Contents/PlugIns/wireshark</u>.

           On Windows, the global plugin folder is <u>plugins/</u> under the main installation directory (for example,
           <u>C:\Program</u> <u>Files\Wireshark\plugins\</u>). The personal plugin folder is <u>%APPDATA%\Wireshark\plugins</u> (or,
           if %APPDATA% isn’t defined, <u>%USERPROFILE%\Application</u> <u>Data\Wireshark\plugins</u>).

           Lua plugins are stored in the plugin folders; compiled plugins are stored in subfolders of the plugin
           folders, with the subfolder name being the Wireshark minor version number (X.Y). There is another
           hierarchical level for each Wireshark plugin type (libwireshark, libwiretap and codecs). For example,
           the location for a libwireshark plugin <u>foo.so</u> (<u>foo.dll</u> on Windows) would be <u>PLUGINDIR/X.Y/epan</u>
           (libwireshark used to be called libepan; the other folder names are <u>codecs</u> and <u>wiretap</u>).

               <b>Note</b>

               On UNIX-compatible systems, Lua plugins (but not binary plugins) may also be placed in
               <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark/plugins</u>, (or, if <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark</u> does not exist while
               <u>$HOME/.wireshark</u> does exist, <u>$HOME/.wireshark/plugins</u>.)

           Note that a dissector plugin module may support more than one protocol; there is not necessarily a
           one-to-one correspondence between dissector plugin modules and protocols. Protocols supported by a
           dissector plugin module are enabled and disabled in the same way as protocols built into Wireshark.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       WIRESHARK_CONFIG_DIR

           This environment variable overrides the location of personal configuration files. On UNIX-compatible
           systems, such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX, it defaults to <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/wireshark</u>
           (or, if that directory doesn’t exist but <u>$HOME/.wireshark</u> does exist, <u>$HOME/.wireshark</u>); this is
           typically <u>$HOME/.config/wireshark</u>. On Windows, it defaults to <u>%APPDATA%\Wireshark</u> (or, if %APPDATA%
           isn’t defined, <u>%USERPROFILE%\Application</u> <u>Data\Wireshark</u>). Available since Wireshark 3.0.

       WIRESHARK_DEBUG_WMEM_OVERRIDE
           Setting this environment variable forces the wmem framework to use the specified allocator backend
           for <b>all</b> allocations, regardless of which backend is normally specified by the code. This is mainly
           useful to developers when testing or debugging. See <u>README.wmem</u> in the source distribution for
           details.

       WIRESHARK_RUN_FROM_BUILD_DIRECTORY
           This environment variable causes the plugins and other data files to be loaded from the build
           directory (where the program was compiled) rather than from the standard locations. It has no effect
           when the program in question is running with root (or setuid) permissions on UNIX-compatible systems,
           such as Linux, macOS, \*BSD, Solaris, and AIX.

       WIRESHARK_DATA_DIR
           This environment variable causes the various data files to be loaded from a directory other than the
           standard locations. It has no effect when the program in question is running with root (or setuid)
           permissions on UNIX-compatible systems.

       WIRESHARK_EXTCAP_DIR
           This environment variable causes the various extcap programs and scripts to be run from a directory
           other than the standard locations. It has no effect when the program in question is running with root
           (or setuid) permissions on UNIX-compatible systems.

       WIRESHARK_PLUGIN_DIR
           This environment variable causes the various plugins to be loaded from a directory other than the
           standard locations. It has no effect when the program in question is running with root (or setuid)
           permissions on UNIX-compatible systems.

       ERF_RECORDS_TO_CHECK
           This environment variable controls the number of ERF records checked when deciding if a file really
           is in the ERF format. Setting this environment variable a number higher than the default (20) would
           make false positives less likely.

       IPFIX_RECORDS_TO_CHECK
           This environment variable controls the number of IPFIX records checked when deciding if a file really
           is in the IPFIX format. Setting this environment variable a number higher than the default (20) would
           make false positives less likely.

       WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_DISSECTOR_BUG
           If this environment variable is set, <b>Wireshark</b> will call <a href="../man3/abort.3.html">abort</a>(3) when a dissector bug is
           encountered. <a href="../man3/abort.3.html">abort</a>(3) will cause the program to exit abnormally; if you are running <b>Wireshark</b> in a
           debugger, it should halt in the debugger and allow inspection of the process, and, if you are not
           running it in a debugger, it will, on some OSes, assuming your environment is configured correctly,
           generate a core dump file. This can be useful to developers attempting to troubleshoot a problem with
           a protocol dissector.

       WIRESHARK_ABORT_ON_TOO_MANY_ITEMS
           If this environment variable is set, <b>Wireshark</b> will call <a href="../man3/abort.3.html">abort</a>(3) if a dissector tries to add too
           many items to a tree (generally this is an indication of the dissector not breaking out of a loop
           soon enough). <a href="../man3/abort.3.html">abort</a>(3) will cause the program to exit abnormally; if you are running <b>Wireshark</b> in a
           debugger, it should halt in the debugger and allow inspection of the process, and, if you are not
           running it in a debugger, it will, on some OSes, assuming your environment is configured correctly,
           generate a core dump file. This can be useful to developers attempting to troubleshoot a problem with
           a protocol dissector.

       WIRESHARK_QUIT_AFTER_CAPTURE
           Cause <b>Wireshark</b> to exit after the end of the capture session. This doesn’t automatically start a
           capture; you must still use <b>-k</b> to do that. You must also specify an autostop condition, e.g. <b>-c</b> or <b>-a</b>
           <b>duration:...</b>. This means that you will not be able to see the results of the capture after it stops;
           it’s primarily useful for testing.

       WIRESHARK_LOG_LEVEL
           This environment variable controls the verbosity of diagnostic messages to the console. From less
           verbose to most verbose levels can be critical, warning, message, info, debug or noisy. Levels above
           the current level are also active. Levels critical and error are always active.

       WIRESHARK_LOG_FATAL
           Sets the fatal log level. Fatal log levels cause the program to abort. This level can be set to
           Error, critical or warning. Error is always fatal and is the default.

       WIRESHARK_LOG_DOMAINS
           This environment variable selects which log domains are active. The filter is given as a
           case-insensitive comma separated list. If set only the included domains will be enabled. The default
           domain is always considered to be enabled. Domain filter lists can be preceded by '!' to invert the
           sense of the match.

       WIRESHARK_LOG_DEBUG
           List of domains with debug log level. This sets the level of the provided log domains and takes
           precedence over the active domains filter. If preceded by '!' this disables the debug level instead.

       WIRESHARK_LOG_NOISY
           Same as above but for noisy log level instead.
