</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pro - Manage Ubuntu Pro services from Canonical

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pro</b> [-h] [--debug] [--version] &lt;command&gt; ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Ubuntu  Pro is a collection of services offered by Canonical to Ubuntu users. The Ubuntu Pro command line
       tool is used to attach a system to an Ubuntu Pro contract  to  then  enable  and  disable  services  from
       Canonical. The available commands and services are described in more detail below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Show help for pro or for the specified pro command.

       <b>--debug</b>
              Redirect all the debugging logs to the console.

       <b>--version</b>
              Show the Pro Client version and exit.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>api</b> [-h] [--show-progress] [--args [OPTIONS ...]] [--data DATA] endpoint
              Calls the Client API endpoints.

              For  a  list of all of the supported endpoints and their structure, please refer to the Pro Client
              API reference guide:

              https://canonical-ubuntu-pro-client.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/references/api/

       <b>attach</b> [-h] [--no-auto-enable] [--attach-config ATTACH_CONFIG] [--format {cli,json}] [token]
              Attach  this  machine  to   an   Ubuntu   Pro   subscription   with   a   token   obtained   from:
              https://ubuntu.com/pro/dashboard

              When  running this command without a token, it will generate a short code and prompt you to attach
              the machine to your Ubuntu Pro account using a web browser.

              The "attach-config" option can be used to provide a file with the token and optionally, a list  of
              services   to   enable   after  attaching.  To  know  more,  visit:  https://canonical-ubuntu-pro-
              client.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/howtoguides/how_to_attach_with_config_file/

              The exit code will be:

                  * 0: on successful attach
                  * 1: in case of any error while trying to attach
                  * 2: if the machine is already attached

       <b>fix</b> [-h] [--dry-run] [--no-related] security_issue
              Inspect and resolve Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and Ubuntu Security Notices (USNs)
              on this machine.

              The exit code will be:

                  * 0: the fix was successfully applied or the system is not affected
                  * 1: the fix cannot be applied
                  * 2: the fix was applied but requires a reboot before it takes effect

       <b>help</b> [-h] [--format {tabular,json,yaml}] [--all] [service]

                  * config:   Reload the config file.
                  * messages: Update APT and MOTD messages related to Pro.

              You  can  individually target any of the three specific actions, by passing the target name to the
              command. If no target is specified, all targets are refreshed.

       <b>security-status</b> [-h] [--format {json,yaml,text}] [--thirdparty | --unavailable | --esm-infra | --esm-
       apps]
              Show security updates for packages in  the  system,  including  all  available  Expanded  Security
              Maintenance (ESM) related content.

              Shows counts of how many packages are supported for security updates in the system.

              If  the  format  is  set to JSON or YAML it shows a summary of the installed packages based on the
              origin:

                  - main/restricted/universe/multiverse: Packages from the Ubuntu archive.
                  - esm-infra/esm-apps: Packages from the ESM archive.
                  - third-party: Packages installed from non-Ubuntu sources.
                  - unknown: Packages which don't have an installation source (like local
                    deb packages or packages for which the source was removed).

              The output contains basic information about Ubuntu Pro.  For  a  complete  status  on  Ubuntu  Pro
              services, run 'pro status'.

       <b>status</b> [-h] [--wait] [--format {tabular,json,yaml}] [--simulate-with-token TOKEN] [--all]
              Report current status of Ubuntu Pro services on system.

              This  shows whether this machine is attached to an Ubuntu Pro support contract. When attached, the
              report includes the specific support contract details including contract name, expiry  dates,  and
              the status of each service on this system.

              The attached status output has four columns:

                  * SERVICE: Name of the service.
                  * ENTITLED: Whether the contract to which this machine is attached
                    entitles use of this service. Possible values are: yes or no.
                  * STATUS: Whether the service is enabled on this machine. Possible
                    values are: enabled, disabled, n/a (if your contract entitles
                    you to the service, but it isn't available for this machine) or - (if
                    you aren't entitled to this service).
                  * DESCRIPTION: A brief description of the service.

              The  unattached  status  output instead has three columns. SERVICE and DESCRIPTION are the same as
              above, and there is the addition of:

                  * AVAILABLE: Whether this service would be available if this machine
                    were attached. The possible values are yes or no.

              If "simulate-with-token" is used, then the output has five columns. SERVICE,  AVAILABLE,  ENTITLED
              and DESCRIPTION are the same as mentioned above, and AUTO_ENABLED shows whether the service is set
              to be enabled when that token is attached.

              If the "all" flag is set, beta and unavailable services are also listed in the output.

       <b>system</b> [-h] {reboot-required} ...
              Output system-related information about Pro services.

           <b>reboot-required</b> [-h]
              Report the current reboot-required status for the machine.

              This command will output one of the three following states for the machine regarding reboot:

                  * no: The machine doesn't require a reboot.
                  * yes: The machine requires a reboot.
                  * yes-kernel-livepatches-applied: There are only kernel-related
                    packages that require a reboot, but Livepatch has already provided
                    patches for the current running kernel. The machine still needs a
                    reboot, but you can assess if the reboot can be performed in the
                    nearest maintenance window.

</pre><h4><b>PRO</b> <b>UPGRADE</b> <b>DAEMON</b></h4><pre>
       Ubuntu  Pro  client  sets up a daemon on supported platforms (currently on Azure and GCP) to detect if an
       Ubuntu Pro license is purchased for the machine. If an Ubuntu Pro license is detected, then  the  machine
       is  automatically  attached.   If  you  are  uninterested in Ubuntu Pro services, you can safely stop and
       disable the daemon using systemctl:

       sudo systemctl stop ubuntu-advantage.service sudo systemctl disable ubuntu-advantage.service

</pre><h4><b>TIMER</b> <b>JOBS</b></h4><pre>
       Ubuntu Pro client sets up a systemd timer to run jobs that need to be  executed  recurrently.  The  timer
       itself  ticks  every  5  minutes  on  average,  and decides which jobs need to be executed based on their
       intervals.

       Jobs are executed by the timer script if the script has not yet run successfully, or their interval since
       last successful run is already exceeded.  There is a random delay applied to the timer, to  desynchronize
       job execution time on machines spinned at the same time, avoiding multiple synchronized calls to the same
       service.

       Current jobs being checked and executed are:

       <b>update_messaging</b>
              Makes  sure  that  the  MOTD  and APT messages match the available/enabled services on the system,
              showing information about available packages or security updates.

       <b>metering</b>
              If attached, this job will ping the Canonical servers telling which services are  enabled  on  the
              machine.
