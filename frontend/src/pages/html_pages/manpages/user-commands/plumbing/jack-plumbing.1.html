       jack-plumbing - JACK Plumbing Daemon

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       jack-plumbing [options] [rule-files]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b> : Do not operate as a daemon.

       <b>-o</b> : Do not load ordinary rule files.

       <b>-q</b> : Quiet operation.

       <b>-u</b> : Set the time, in micro-seconds, that must elapse after a connection notification to indicate the end
       of a notification set (default=30000). This is an optimization switch.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       jack-plumbing maintains a set of port connection rules and manages these as clients register ports with
       JACK- Port names are implicitly bounded regular expressions and support sub-expression patterns.

       There are four rules: connect, disconnect, also-connect and connect-exclusive.

           (connect "SuperCollider:out_(.*)" "system:playback_\1")

       This connect rule ensures that whenever <a href="../man1/scsynth.1.html">scsynth</a>(1) is running any output ports it registers are connected
       to appropriate ALSA playback ports. The connect rule only makes a connection if none already exist.

           (also-connect "system:playback_1" "jack-udp-[0-9]*:in_1")

       This also-connect rule ensures that when <a href="../man1/jack-udp.1.html">jack-udp</a>(1) is running in send mode all signals that are
       ordinarily sent to the local audio interface will also be sent to the network destination. The
       also-connect aliasing applies to both the left and right hand side of connect rules.

           (connect-exclusive "SuperCollider:out_(.*)" "ardour:sc3_in_\1/in 1")

       This connect-exclusive rule ensures that if SuperCollider and an <a href="../man1/ardour.1.html">ardour</a>(1) session with appropriate
       tracks are both running that SuperCollider gets connected to ardour and disconnected from everything
       else.

       This type of connection daemon has the following advantages over both environment variables and command
       line arguments:

       •   it does not require any client connection support or logic at all

       •   it provides a uniform user interface to all clients

       •   it has a somewhat declarative style

       This type of daemon is very lightweight and non-intrusive: it requires no arguments, it runs from an
       unprivileged thread, if the rule set is empty it is a no-op, it does not write any files, it does not
       require any modification to clients or to how clients are started.

       When a set of port registrations is made it checks the modification time of the rule set files,
       <u>/etc/jack-plumbing</u> and <u><a href="file:~/.jack-plumbing">~/.jack-plumbing</a></u>, and any files specified by the user, rereads the rule set if it
       has been updated, then makes the JACK graph obey the rules.

       Any lines beginning with a semi-colon are ignored.

       The rule set is sorted, disconnect rules are applied first, then connect rules, then connect-exclusive
       rules.
