       &lt;!-- AUTOGENERATED USAGE DESCRIPTIONS --&gt;

       Note: This command is unaware of workspaces.

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Used to manage teams in organizations, and change team memberships. Does not
       handle permissions for packages.

       Teams must always be fully qualified with the organization/scope they belong to
       when operating on them, separated by a colon (<b>:</b>). That is, if you have a
       <b>newteam</b> team in an <b>org</b> organization, you must always refer to that team
       as <b>@org:newteam</b> in these commands.

       If you have two-factor authentication enabled in <b>auth-and-writes</b> mode, then
       you can provide a code from your authenticator with <b>[--otp</b> <b>&lt;otpcode&gt;]</b>.
       If you don't include this then you will be prompted.

        • create / destroy:
          Create a new team, or destroy an existing one. Note: You cannot remove the
          <b>developers</b>    team,   &lt;a   href="https://docs.npmjs.com/about-developers-team"   target="_blank"&gt;learn
          more.&lt;/a&gt;

        Here's how to create a new team <b>newteam</b> under the <b>org</b> org:
          npm team create @org:newteam

        You should see a confirming message such as: <b>+@org:newteam</b> once the new
        team has been created.

        • add:
          Add a user to an existing team.

        Adding a new user <b>username</b> to a team named <b>newteam</b> under the <b>org</b> org:
          npm team add @org:newteam username

        On success, you should see a message: <b>username</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>@org:newteam</b>

        • rm:
          Using <b>npm</b> <b>team</b> <b>rm</b> you can also remove users from a team they belong to.

        Here's an example removing user <b>username</b> from <b>newteam</b> team
        in <b>org</b> organization:
          npm team rm @org:newteam username

        Once the user is removed a confirmation message is displayed:
        <b>username</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>@org:newteam</b>

        • ls:
          If performed on an organization name, will return a list of existing teams
          under that organization. If performed on a team, it will instead return a list
          of all users belonging to that particular team.

        Here's an example of how to list all teams from an org named <b>org</b>:
          npm team ls @org

        Example listing all members of a team named <b>newteam</b>:
          npm team ls @org:newteam

</pre><h4><b>Details</b></h4><pre>
       <b>npm</b> <b>team</b> always operates directly on the current registry, configurable from
       the command line using <b>--registry=&lt;registry</b> <b>url&gt;</b>.

       You must be a <u>team</u> <u>admin</u> to create teams and manage team membership, under
       the given organization. Listing teams and team memberships may be done by
       any member of the organization.

       Organization creation and management of team admins and <u>organization</u> members
       is done through the website, not the npm CLI.

       To use teams to manage permissions on packages belonging to your organization,
       use the <b>npm</b> <b>access</b> command to grant or revoke the appropriate permissions.
