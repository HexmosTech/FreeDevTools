</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       calc - arbitrary precision calculator

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>calc</u> [<b>-c</b>] [<b>-C</b>] [<b>-d</b>]
            [<b>-D</b> <b>calc_debug[:resource_debug[:user_debug]]</b>]
            [<b>-e</b>] [<b>-f</b> <b>filename</b>] [<b>-h</b>] [<b>-i</b>] [<b>-m</b> <b>mode</b>] [<b>-O</b>]
            [<b>-p</b>] [<b>-q</b>] [<b>-s</b>] [<b>-u</b>] [<b>-v</b>] [<b>[--]</b> <b>calc_cmd</b> <b>...</b>]

       <u>#!/usr/bin/calc</u> [optional_other_flags ...] <b>-f</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c</b>     Continue reading command lines even after a scan/parse error has caused the abandonment of a line.
              Note that this option only deals with scanning and parsing of the calc language.  It does not deal
              with execution or run-time errors.

              For example:

                   calc read many_errors.cal

              will cause <b>calc</b> to abort on the first syntax error, whereas:

                   calc -c read many_errors.cal

              will  cause  <b>calc</b>  to  try  to  process each line being read despite the scan/parse errors that it
              encounters.

              By default, calc startup resource files are silently ignored if not found.  This flag will  report
              missing startup resource files unless <b>-d</b> is also given.

       <b>-C</b>     Permit the execution of custom builtin functions.  Without this flag, calling the custom() builtin
              function will simply generate an error.

              Use  of  this  flag  may  cause  <b>calc</b>  to execute functions that are non-standard and that are not
              portable.  Custom builtin functions are disabled by default for this reason.

       <b>-d</b>     Disable the printing of the opening title.  The printing of resource file debug and  informational
              messages is also disabled as if <b>config("resource_debug",</b> <b>0)</b> had been executed.

              For example:

                   calc "read qtime; <a href="../man2/qtime.2.html">qtime</a>(2)"

              will output something like:

                   qtime(utc_hr_offset) defined
                   It's nearly ten past six.

              whereas:

                   calc -d "read qtime; <a href="../man2/qtime.2.html">qtime</a>(2)"

              will just print:

                   It's nearly ten past six.

              This flag disables the reporting of missing calc startup resource files.

              This flag also disables the printing the leading tilde. For example:

                   calc 2/3

              will print:

                   ~0.66666666666666666667

              whereas:

                   calc -d 2/3

              will just print:

                   0.66666666666666666667

       <b>-D</b> calc_debug[:resource_debug[:user_debug]]
              Force    the    initial    value    of    config("calc_debug"),    config("resource_debug")    and
              config("user_debug").

              The : separated strings are interpreted as signed 32 bit integers.  After an optional leading sign
              a leading zero indicates octal conversion, and a leading ``0x'' or ``0X'' hexadecimal  conversion.
              Otherwise, decimal conversion is assumed.

              By default, <u>calc_debug</u> is 0, <u>resource_debug</u> is 3 and <u>user_debug</u> is 0.

              For more information use the following <b>calc</b> command:

                   help config

       <b>-e</b>     Ignore  any  environment  variables  on  startup.   The getenv() builtin will still return values,
              however.

       <b>-f</b> filename
              This flag is normally only with calc shell scripts.

              This flag is required when using calc in <b>shell</b> <b>script</b> <b>mode</b>.  It must be at the end of the  initial
              <b>#!</b>  line of the script, as in:

                   <u>#!/usr/bin/calc</u> [optional_other_flags ...] <b>-f</b>

              the rest of the file will be processed in <b>shell</b> <b>script</b> <b>mode</b>.

              A common flag to use, prior to the <b>-f</b> on the #! line is the <b>-q</b> flag.  For example:

                   <u>#!/usr/bin/calc</u> <b>-q</b> <b>-f</b>

              See <b>SHELL</b> <b>SCRIPT</b> <b>MODE</b> section of this man page below for details.

              While the actual form of this flag is:

                   <b>-f</b> filename

              for  systems that treat an executable that begins with <b>#!</b>  as a script, the path of the executable
              is appended by the kernel as the final argument to the exec() system call.  This  is  why  the  <b>-f</b>
              flag at the very end of the <b>#!</b>  line.

              It is possible use <b>-f</b> filename on the command line:

                   <u>calc</u> [optional_other_flags ...] <b>-f</b> filename

              This will cause calc to process lines in <b>filename</b> in <b>shell</b> <b>script</b> <b>mode</b>.

              <b>NOTE:</b> The use of <b>-f</b> does <b>NOT</b> imply <b>-q</b> and thus one would need to use

                   <u>calc</u> [optional_other_flags ...] <b>-q</b> <b>-f</b> filename

              to disable the use of calc startup files as well.

              The use of <b>-f</b> filename implies the <b>-s</b> flag.

       <b>-h</b>     Print  a help message.  This option implies <b>-q</b>.  This is equivalent to the <b>calc</b> command help help.
              The help facility is disabled unless the mode is 5 or 7.  See <b>-m</b>.

       <b>-i</b>     Become interactive if possible.  This flag will cause <b>calc</b> to drop into interactive mode after the
              <u>calc_cmd</u> arguments on the command line are evaluated.  Without this flag,  <b>calc</b>  will  exit  after
              they are evaluated.

              For example:

                   calc 2+5

              will print the value 7 and exit whereas:

                   calc -i 2+5

              will print the value 7 and prompt the user for more <b>calc</b> commands.

       <b>-m</b> mode
              This  flag  sets  the permission mode of <b>calc</b>.  It controls the ability for <b>calc</b> to open files and
              execute programs.  <u>Mode</u> may be a number from 0 to 7.

              The mode value is interpreted in a way similar to that of the <b><a href="../man1/chmod.1.html">chmod</a></b>(1) octal mode:

                   0  do not open any file, do not execute progs
                   1  do not open any file
                   2  do not open files for reading, do not execute progs
                   3  do not open files for reading
                   4  do not open files for writing, do not execute progs
                   5  do not open files for writing
                   6  do not execute any program
                   7  allow everything (default mode)

              If one wished to run <b>calc</b> from a privileged user, one might want to use <b>-m</b> 0 in an effort to  make
              <b>calc</b> somewhat more secure.

              Mode  bits  for  reading  and writing apply only on an open.  Files already open are not effected.
              Thus if one wanted to use the <b>-m</b> 0 in an effort to make  <b>calc</b>  somewhat  more  secure,  but  still
              wanted  to  read  and  write  a specific file, one might want to do in <b><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/ksh.1.html">ksh</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a></b>(1)-like
              shells:

                   calc -m 0 3&lt;a.file

              Files presented to <b>calc</b> in this way are opened in an unknown mode.  <b>Calc</b> will attempt to  read  or
              write them if directed.

              If the mode disables opening of files for reading, then the startup resource files are disabled as
              if  <b>-q</b>  was given.  The reading of key bindings is also disabled when the mode disables opening of
              files for reading.

       <b>-O</b>     Use the old classic defaults instead of the default configuration.  This flag as the  same  effect
              as executing <b>config("all",</b> <b>"oldcfg")</b> at startup time.

              NOTE:  Older  versions of calc used <b>-n</b> to setup a modified form of the default calc configuration.
              The <b>-n</b> flag currently does nothing.  Use of the <b>-n</b> flag is now deprecated  and  may  be  used  for
              something else in the future.

       <b>-p</b>     Pipe processing is enabled by use of <b>-p</b>.  For example:

                   calc -p "2^21701-1" | fizzbin

              In  pipe  mode,  <b>calc</b>  does not prompt, does not print leading tabs and does not print the initial
              header.  The <b>-p</b> flag overrides <b>-i</b>.

              When running calc as a shell script (see <b>SHELL</b> <b>SCRIPT</b> <b>MODE</b> for details), calc will close  standard
              input  (stdin)  during  startup  <b>UNLESS</b>  the  <b>-p</b>  flag is given on the command line.  When calc is
              running in <b>shell</b> <b>script</b> <b>mode</b>, shell scripts that  call  the  <b>prompt</b>(str)  builtin  will  not  work
              properly (the prompt builtin will always fail) unless the <b>-p</b> flag is given on the command line.

       <b>-q</b>     Disable the reading of the startup scripts.

              This  allows  the script to run independently of startup scripts such those managed by the <b>$CALCRC</b>
              environment variable.  For example, this will disable the use of the common calcrc  file  (usually
              <a href="file:~/.calcrc">~/.calcrc</a>).

       <b>-s</b>     By default, all <u>calc_cmd</u> args are evaluated and executed.  This flag will disable their evaluation
              and instead make them available as strings for the argv() builtin function.

       <b>-u</b>     Disable buffering of stdin and stdout.

       <b>-v</b>     Print the <b>calc</b> version number and exit.

       <b>--</b>     The  double  dash  indicates  to  calc that no more options follow.  Thus calc will ignore a later
              argument on the command line even if it starts with a dash.  This is useful when entering negative
              values on the command line as in:

                   calc -p -- -1 - -7

</pre><h4><b>CALC</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b></h4><pre>
       With no <u>calc_cmd</u> arguments, <b>calc</b> operates interactively.  If one or  more  arguments  are  given  on  the
       command  line  and  <b>-s</b>  is  NOT  given,  then  <b>calc</b>  will  read and execute them and either attempt to go
       interactive according as the <b>-i</b> flag was present or absent.

       If <b>-s</b> is given, <b>calc</b> will not evaluate any <u>calc_cmd</u> arguments but instead make them available as  strings
       to the argv() builtin function.

       Sufficiently  simple  commands with no characters like parentheses, brackets, semicolons, '*', which have
       special interpretations in UNIX shells may be  entered,  possibly  with  spaces,  until  the  terminating
       newline.  For example:

            calc 23 + 47

       will print 70.  However, command lines will have problems:

            calc 23 * 47

            calc -23 + 47

       The  first  example  above fails because the shell interprets the '*' as a file glob.  The second example
       fails because '-23' is viewed as a calc option (which it is not) and do calc objects to that it thinks of
       as an unknown option.  These cases can usually be made to work  as  expected  by  enclosing  the  command
       between quotes:

            calc '23 * 47'

            calc "print <a href="../man2/sqrt.2.html">sqrt</a>(2), <a href="../man1/exp.1.html">exp</a>(1)"

       or in parentheses and quotes to avoid leading -'s as in:

            calc '(-23 + 47)'

       One may also use a double dash to denote that calc options have ended as in:

            calc -- -23 + 47

            calc -q -- -23 + 47

       If '!' is to be used to indicate the factorial function, for shells like <b>csh</b><u>(1)</u> for which '!' followed by
       a  non-space  character is used for history substitution, it may be necessary to include a space or use a
       backslash to escape the special meaning of '!'.  For example, the command:

            print 27!^2

       may have to be replaced by:

            print 27! ^2    or      print 27\!^2

       Reading from standard input when calc is part of a pipe works as long as the -p flag is  given  to  calc.
       For example, this will print chongo was here:

            echo chongo was here | calc -p 'print fgetline(<a href="../man0/files.0.html">files</a>(0));'

       while this does not:

            echo chongo was here | calc 'print fgetline(<a href="../man0/files.0.html">files</a>(0));'

       nor will this print chongo was here:

            echo chongo was here | calc -i 'print fgetline(<a href="../man0/files.0.html">files</a>(0));'

       This  is  because without <b>-p</b>, the interactive parser, in an effort to parse interactive commands, flushes
       data on standard input.

</pre><h4><b>CALC</b> <b>STARTUP</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Normally on startup, if the environment variable <b>$CALCRC</b> is undefined and <b>calc</b> is invoked without the  <b>-q</b>
       flag,  or  if <b>$CALCRC</b> is defined and calc is invoked with <b>-e</b>, <b>calc</b> looks for a file "startup" in the calc
       resource directory <b>.calcrc</b> in the user's home directory, and <b>.calcinit</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>directory.</b>  If  one
       or  more  of  these  are  found, they are read in succession as <b>calc</b> scripts and their commands executed.
       When defined, <b>$CALCRC</b> is to contain a ':' separated list of names of files, and if calc is  then  invoked
       without  either  the  <b>-q</b> or <b>-e</b> flags, these files are read in succession and their commands executed.  No
       error condition is produced if a listed file is not found.

       If the mode specified by <b>-m</b> disables opening of files for reading, then the reading of startup  files  is
       also disabled as if <b>-q</b> was given.

</pre><h4><b>CALC</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>SEARCH</b> <b>PATH</b></h4><pre>
       If  the  environment variable <b>$CALCPATH</b> is undefined, or if it is defined and <b>calc</b> is invoked with the <b>-e</b>
       flag, when a file name not beginning with <b>/</b>, <b>~</b> or <b>./</b>, is specified as in:

            calc read myfile

       <b>calc</b> searches in succession:

            ./myfile
            ./myfile.cal
            /usr/lib/myfile
            /usr/lib/myfile.cal
            /usr/share/calc/custom/myfile
            /usr/share/calc/custom/myfile.cal

       If the file is found, the search stops and the commands in the file are executed.  It is an error  if  no
       readable  file with the specified name is found.  An alternative search path can be specified by defining
       <b>$CALCPATH</b> in the same way as PATH is defined, as a ':' separated list of directories, and  then  invoking
       <b>calc</b> without the <b>-e</b> flag.

       <b>Calc</b>  treats  all  open  files,  other  than  stdin, stdout and stderr as files available for reading and
       writing.  One may present <b>calc</b> with an already open file using <b><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/ksh.1.html">ksh</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a></b>(1)-like shells is to:

            calc 3&lt;open_file 4&lt;open_file2

       For more information use the following <b>calc</b> commands:

            help help
            help overview
            help usage
            help environment
            help config

</pre><h4><b>SHELL</b> <b>SCRIPT</b> <b>MODE</b></h4><pre>
       If the first line of an executable file begins <b>#!</b>  followed by the absolute pathname of the <b>calc</b>  program
       and the first line ends with the flag <b>-f</b> as in:

            <u>#!/usr/bin/calc</u> [optional_other_flags ...] <b>-f</b>

       the  rest  of the file will be processed in <b>shell</b> <b>script</b> <b>mode</b>.  Note that <b>-s</b> <b>-f</b> must be at the end of the
       initial ``#!'' line.  Any other optional <b>optional_other_flags</b> must come before the <b>-f</b> flag.

       In <b>shell</b> <b>script</b> <b>mode</b> the contents of the file are read and executed as if  they  were  in  a  file  being
       processed by a read command, except that a "command" beginning with '#' followed by whitespace and ending
       at  the  next  newline  is  treated as a comment.  Any optional <b>optional_other_flags</b> will be parsed first
       followed by the later lines within the script itself.

       In <b>shell</b> <b>script</b> <b>mode</b>, <b>-s</b> is always assumed.  In addition, <b>-d</b> and <b>-p</b> are automatically set if  <b>-i</b>  is  not
       given.

       <b>NOTE:</b> The use of <b>-f</b> does <b>NOT</b> imply <b>-q</b> and thus one would need to use

            <u>calc</u> [optional_other_flags ...] <b>-q</b> <b>-f</b> filename

       to disable the use of calc startup files as well.

       For example, if the file <b>/tmp/mersenne</b>:

            <u>#!/usr/bin/calc</u> <b>-q</b> <b>-f</b>

            /* setup */
            argc = argv();
            program = <a href="../man0/argv.0.html">argv</a>(0);
            stderr = <a href="../man2/files.2.html">files</a>(2);

            /* parse args */
            if (argc != 2) {
                fprintf(stderr, "usage: %s exp0, program);
                abort "must give one exponent arg";
            }
            exp = eval(<a href="../man1/argv.1.html">argv</a>(1));
            if (!isint(exp) || exp &lt; 0) {
                fprintf(stderr, "%s: exp must be non-negative integer0, program);
                abort "must give one exponent arg";
            }

            /* print the mersenne number */
            print "2^": exp : "-1 =", 2^exp-1;

       is made an executable file by:

            chmod +x /tmp/mersenne

       then the command line:

            /tmp/mersenne 127

       will print:

            2^127-1 = 170141183460469231731687303715884105727

       Note  that  because <b>-s</b> is required in <b>shell</b> <b>script</b> <b>mode</b> non-dashed args are made available as strings via
       the <b>argv</b>() builtin function.  Therefore:

            2^eval(<a href="../man1/argv.1.html">argv</a>(1))-1

       will print the decimal value of 2^n-1 whereas

            2^<a href="../man1/argv.1.html">argv</a>(1)-1

       will not.

       By default, using calc startup in <b>shell</b> <b>script</b> <b>mode</b>,  calc  will  close  standard  input  (stdin).   Thus
       builtin  functions such as <b>prompt</b>(str) will fail (return a null value).  Calc shell scripts that call the
       <b>prompt</b>(str) builtin will not work properly (the prompt builtin will always fail and return a null  value)
       unless the <b>-p</b> flag is given on the command line.

       The  following  shell  script  will  always  print "got null" because stdin will be closed by calc during
       startup:

            #!/usr/bin/calc -q -f

            # The prompt will ALWAYS FAIL and return a null value
            n = prompt("Test&gt; ");
            if (isnull(n)) {
              print("got null");
            } else {
              print("got " + n);
            }

       However the following shell script (note the <b>-p</b> before the <b>-f</b> in  the  1st  line)  will  be  interactive,
       prompt with "Test&gt; " and print the "got" result as expected:

            #!/usr/bin/calc -q -p -f

            n = prompt("Test&gt; ");
            if (isnull(n)) {
              print("got null");
            } else {
              print("got " + n);
            }

       Note in the example above, the <b>-p</b> flag must be given before the final <b>-f</b> command line flag.

</pre><h4><b>DATA</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       Fundamental  builtin  data  types  include  integers, real numbers, rational numbers, complex numbers and
       strings.

       By use of an object, one may define an arbitrarily complex data types.  One may define how  such  objects
       behave  a  wide  range  of  operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, negation,
       squaring, modulus, rounding, exponentiation, equality, comparison, printing and so on.

       For more information use the following <b>calc</b> commands:

          help types
          help obj
          show objfuncs

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       Variables in <u>calc</u> are typeless.  In other words, the fundamental type of a variable is determined by  its
       content.  Before a variable is assigned a value it has the value of zero.

       The  scope  of a variable may be global, local to a file, or local to a procedure.  Values may be grouped
       together in a matrix, or into a list that permits stack and queue style operations.

       For more information use the following <b>calc</b> commands:

          help variable
          help mat
          help list
          show globals

</pre><h4><b>INPUT/OUTPUT</b></h4><pre>
       A leading ``0x'' implies a hexadecimal value, a leading ``0b''  implies  a  binary  value,  and  a  ``0''
       followed by a digit implies an octal value.  Complex numbers are indicated by a trailing ``i'' such as in
       ``3+4i''.  Strings may be delimited by either a pair of single or double quotes.  By default, <u>calc</u> prints
       values as if they were floating point numbers.  One may change the default to print values in a number of
       modes including fractions, integers and exponentials.

       A  number  of  stdio-like  file  I/O  operations are provided.  One may open, read, write, seek and close
       files.  Filenames are subject to `` '' expansion to home directories in a way similar to that of the Korn
       or C-Shell.

       For example:

          <a href="file:~/.calcrc">~/.calcrc</a>
          ~chongo/lib/fft_multiply.cal

       For more information use the following <b>calc</b> command:

          help file

</pre><h4><b>CALC</b> <b>LANGUAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>calc</u> language is a C-like language.  The language includes commands such  as  variable  declarations,
       expressions,  tests,  labels, loops, file operations, function calls.  These commands are very similar to
       their counterparts in C.

       The language also include a number of commands particular to <u>calc</u> itself.  These include commands such as
       function definition, help, reading  in  resource  files,  dump  files  to  a  file,  error  notification,
       configuration control and status.

       For more information use the following <b>calc</b> command:

          help command
          help statement
          help expression
          help operator
          help config

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /usr/bin/calc
            calc binary

       /usr/share/doc/calc/examples/*
            calc shell scripts

       <a href="file:/usr/lib/">/usr/lib/</a>*.cal

       /usr/lib/help/*
            help files

       /usr/lib/bindings
            non-GNU-readline command line editor bindings

       /usr/include/calc/*.h
            include files for C interface use

       /usr/lib/libcalc.a
            calc binary link library

       /usr/lib/libcustcalc.a

            custom resource files

       /usr/share/calc/custhelp/*
            custom help files

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       CALCPATH
            A  :-separated list of directories used to search for calc resource filenames that do not begin with
            /, ./ or ~.

            Default value: .:./cal:<a href="file:~/.cal">~/.cal</a>:/usr/local/share/calc:/usr/share/calc:/usr/share/calc/custom

       CALCRC
            On startup (unless -h or -q was given on the command line),  <b>calc</b>  searches  for  files  along  this
            :-separated environment variable.

            Default value: ./.calcinit:<a href="file:~/.calcrc">~/.calcrc</a>:/usr/local/share/calc/startup:/usr/share/calc/startup

       CALCBINDINGS
            On  startup  (unless  <u>-h</u>  or  <u>-q</u>  was  given  on the command line, or <u>-m</u> disallows opening files for
            reading), <b>calc</b> reads key bindings from the filename specified by this environment variable.  The key
            binding file is searched for along the $CALCPATH list of directories.

            Default value: binding

            This variable is not used if calc was  compiled  with  GNU-readline  support.   In  that  case,  the
            standard readline mechanisms (see <a href="../man3/readline.3.html">readline</a>(3)) are used.

       CALCHISTFILE
            Location of the calc history file.

            Default value: <a href="file:~/.calc_history">~/.calc_history</a>

            This variable is not used if calc was compiled with GNU-readline support.

       CALCHELP
            Location of the calc help directory.

            Default value: /usr/share/calc/help

       CALCCUSTOMHELP
            Location of the calc custom help directory.

            Default value: /usr/share/calc/custhelp

</pre><h4><b>CREDIT</b></h4><pre>
       The main chunk of <b>calc</b> was written by David I. Bell.

       The <b>calc</b> primary mirror, and calc bug report processing is performed by Landon Curt Noll.

       Landon  Curt  Noll  maintains  the master reference source, performs release control functions as well as
       other calc maintenance functions.

       Thanks for suggestions and encouragement from Peter Miller, Neil Justusson, and Landon Noll.

       Thanks to Stephen Rothwell for writing the original version of hist.c which is used  to  do  the  command
       line editing.

       Thanks  to  Ernest  W.  Bowen for supplying many improvements in accuracy and generality for some numeric
       functions.  Much of this was in terms of actual code which I gratefully accepted.  Ernest  also  supplied
       the original text for many of the help files.

       Portions  of this program are derived from an earlier set of public domain arbitrarily precision routines
       which was posted to the net around 1984.  By now, there is almost no recognizable  code  left  from  that
       original source.
