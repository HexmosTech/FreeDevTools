</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       octave - A high-level interactive programming language for numerical computations.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>octave</b> [<u>options</u>]... [<u>file</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Octave  is  a  high-level  interactive  scientific  programming language.  It has a powerful mathematics-
       oriented syntax for solving problems numerically, as well as built-in 2-D/3-D plotting and  visualization
       tools.   Octave  provides an integrated development environment in either graphical or command-line form.
       Programs may also be run in batch mode to process data without interaction.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       A list of the most useful command-line options for <b>octave</b> is available by running the  following  command
       from the shell.

       <b>octave</b> <b>--help</b>

</pre><h4><b>DOCUMENTATION</b></h4><pre>
       The primary documentation for Octave is written using Texinfo, the GNU documentation system, which allows
       the same source files to be used to produce online and printed versions of the manual.

       You  can  read the built-in copy of the Octave documentation by issuing the following command from within
       <b>octave</b>.

           octave:1&gt; <b>doc</b>

       The Info files may also be read with a stand-alone program such as <b>info</b> or <b>xinfo</b>.  HTML,  Postscript,  or
       PDF  versions  of  the  documentation  are  installed on many systems as well.  The latest version of the
       documentation is available at https://docs.octave.org/latest.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The Octave project maintains a bug tracker at https://bugs.octave.org.   Before  submitting  a  new  item
       please read the instructions at https://www.octave.org/bugs.html on

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Upon  startup  Octave  looks  for  four  initialization files.  Each file may contain any number of valid
       Octave commands.

       <u>octave-home</u>/share/octave/site/m/startup/octaverc
              Site-wide initialization file which changes options for all users.  <u>octave-home</u> is  the  directory
              where Octave was installed such as <u><a href="file:/usr/local">/usr/local</a></u>.

       <u>octave-home</u>/share/octave/<u>version</u>/m/startup/octaverc
              Site-wide initialization file for Octave version <u>version</u>.

       <a href="file:~/.octaverc">~/.octaverc</a>
              User's personal initialization file.

       .octaverc
              Project-specific initialization file located in the current directory.
