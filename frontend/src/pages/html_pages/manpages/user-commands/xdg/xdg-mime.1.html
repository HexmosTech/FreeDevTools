</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xdg-mime - command line tool for querying information about file type handling and adding descriptions
       for new file types

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>xdg-mime</b> query {filetype <u>FILE</u> | default <u>mimetype</u>}

       <b>xdg-mime</b> default <u>application</u> <u>mimetype(s)</u>

       <b>xdg-mime</b> install [<b>--mode</b> <u>mode</u>] [<b>--novendor</b>] <u>mimetypes-file</u>

       <b>xdg-mime</b> uninstall [<b>--mode</b> <u>mode</u>] <u>mimetypes-file</u>

       <b>xdg-mime</b> {<b>--help</b> | <b>--manual</b> | <b>--version</b>}

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The xdg-mime program can be used to query information about file types and to add descriptions for new
       file types.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       query file
           Returns the file type of <u>FILE</u> in the form of a MIME type.

           Please note that <u>FILE</u> names starting with a - will be rejected, this can be mitigated:

           •   Pass absolute paths, i.e. by using <b>realpath</b> as a preprocessor.

           •   Prefix known relative filepaths with a “./”. For example using sed -E 's|^[^/]|./\0|' as a
               preprocessor.

           The <u>query</u> <u>file</u> option is for use inside a desktop session only. It is not recommended to use xdg-mime
           query file as root.

       query default
           Returns the default application that the desktop environment uses for opening files of type <u>mimetype</u>.
           The default application is identified by its *.desktop file.

           The value returned by this command may or may not match the application launched by <b>xdg-open</b> as
           <b>xdg-open</b> hands over to desktop specific openers most of the time which may implement their own logic.

           The <u>query</u> <u>default</u> option is for use inside a desktop session only. It is not recommended to use
           xdg-mime query default as root.

       default
           Ask the desktop environment to make <u>application</u> the default application for opening files of type
           <u>mimetype</u>. An application can be made the default for several file types by specifying multiple
           mimetypes.

           <u>application</u> is the desktop file id of the application and has the form vendor-name.desktop.
           <u>application</u> must already be installed in the desktop menu before it can be made the default handler.
           The application's desktop file must list support for all the MIME types that it wishes to be the
           default handler for.

           Requests to make an application a default handler may be subject to system policy or approval by the
           end-user. xdg-mime query can be used to verify whether an application is the actual default handler
           for a specific file type.

           <u>Security</u> <u>Note:</u> Never set a handler that will blindly execute code or commands from the file being
           handled. Such behaviour will sooner than later lead to unintended code execution i.e. through a
           curious user trying to inspect a freshly downloaded file but running it by accident.

           Keeping opening and executing separate actions helps with people protecting themselves from malware,
           the default handler is an opener, not a runner.

           The <u>default</u> option is for use inside a desktop session only. It is not recommended to use xdg-mime
           default as root.

       install
           Adds the file type descriptions provided in <u>mimetypes-file</u> to the desktop environment.
           <u>mimetypes-file</u> must be a XML file that follows the freedesktop.org Shared MIME-info Database
           specification and that has a mime-info element as its document root. For each new file type one or
           more icons with name <u>type</u>-<u>subtype</u> must be installed with the <b>xdg-icon-resource</b> command in the
           <u>mimetypes</u> context. For example the filetype application/vnd.oasis.opendocument.text requires an icon
           named application-vnd.oasis.opendocument.text to be installed (unless the file type recommends
           another icon name).

       uninstall
           Removes the file type descriptions provided in <u>mimetypes-file</u> and previously added with <b>xdg-mime</b>
           <b>install</b> from the desktop environment.  <u>mimetypes-file</u> must be a XML file that follows the
           freedesktop.org Shared MIME-info Database specification and that has a mime-info element as its
           document root.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--mode</b> <u>mode</u>
           <u>mode</u> can be <u>user</u> or <u>system</u>. In user mode the file is (un)installed for the current user only. In
           system mode the file is (un)installed for all users on the system. Usually only root is allowed to
           install in system mode.

           The default is to use system mode when called by root and to use user mode when called by a non-root
           user.

       <b>--novendor</b>
           Normally, xdg-mime checks to ensure that the <u>mimetypes-file</u> to be installed has a proper vendor
           prefix. This option can be used to disable that check.

           A vendor prefix consists of alpha characters ([a-zA-Z]) and is terminated with a dash ("-").
           Companies and organizations are encouraged to use a word or phrase, preferably the organizations
           name, for which they hold a trademark as their vendor prefix. The purpose of the vendor prefix is to
           prevent name conflicts.

       <b>--help</b>
           Show command synopsis.

       <b>--manual</b>
           Show this manual page.

       <b>--version</b>
           Show the xdg-utils version information.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       xdg-mime honours the following environment variables:

       XDG_UTILS_DEBUG_LEVEL
           Setting this environment variable to a non-zero numerical value makes xdg-mime do more verbose
           reporting on stderr. Setting a higher value increases the verbosity.

       XDG_UTILS_INSTALL_MODE
           This environment variable can be used by the user or administrator to override the installation mode.
           Valid values are <u>user</u> and <u>system</u>.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       An exit code of 0 indicates success while a non-zero exit code indicates failure. The following failure
       codes can be returned:

       <b>1</b>
           Error in command line syntax.

       <b>2</b>
           One of the files passed on the command line did not exist.

       <b>3</b>
           A required tool could not be found.

       <b>4</b>
           The action failed.

       <b>5</b>
           No permission to read one of the files passed on the command line.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
           xdg-mime query filetype /tmp/foobar.png

       Prints the MIME type of the file /tmp/foobar.png, in this case image/png

           xdg-mime query default image/png

       Prints the .desktop filename of the application which is registered to open PNG files.

           xdg-mime install shinythings-shiny.xml

       Adds a file type description for "shiny"-files. "shinythings-" is used as the vendor prefix. The file
       type description could look as follows.

           shinythings-shiny.xml:

           &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
           &lt;mime-info xmlns='<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info">http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/shared-mime-info</a>'&gt;
             &lt;mime-type type="text/x-shiny"&gt;
               &lt;comment&gt;Shiny new file type&lt;/comment&gt;
               &lt;glob pattern="*.shiny"/&gt;
               &lt;glob pattern="*.shi"/&gt;
             &lt;/mime-type&gt;
           &lt;/mime-info&gt;

       An icon for this new file type must also be installed, for example with:

           xdg-icon-resource install --context mimetypes --size 64 shiny-file-icon.png text-x-shiny
