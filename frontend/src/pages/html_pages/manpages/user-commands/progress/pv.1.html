</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pv - monitor the progress of data through a pipe

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>pv</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>FILE</u>]...

       <b>pv</b> <b>-d</b>|<b>--watchfd</b> <u>PID</u>[:<u>FD</u>] [<u>OPTION</u>]...

       <b>pv</b> <b>-R</b>|<b>--remote</b> <u>PID</u> [<u>OPTION</u>]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Show  the  progress  of  data  through  a pipeline by giving information such as time elapsed, percentage
       completed (with progress bar), current throughput rate, total data transferred, and ETA.

       Each <u>FILE</u> is copied to standard output.  With no <u>FILE</u>, or when <u>FILE</u> is “-”, standard input is read.  This
       is the same behaviour as <b><a href="../man1/cat.1.html">cat</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Display</b> <b>switches</b>
       If no display switches are specified, <b>pv</b> behaves as if “<b>--progress</b>”, “<b>--timer</b>”,  “<b>--eta</b>”,  “<b>--rate</b>”,  and
       “<b>--bytes</b>”  had  been  given.  Otherwise, only those display types that are explicitly switched on will be
       shown.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--progress</b>
              Turn the progress bar on.  If any inputs are not  files,  or  are  unreadable,  and  no  size  was
              explicitly  given  with  “<b>--size</b>”,  the  progress  bar cannot indicate how close to completion the
              transfer is, so it will just move left and right to indicate  that  data  is  moving  -  or,  with
              “<b>--gauge</b>”, the bar will indicate the current rate as a percentage of the maximum rate seen so far.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--timer</b>
              Turn the timer on.  This will display the total elapsed time that <b>pv</b> has been running for.

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--eta</b>
              Turn the ETA countdown on.  This will estimate, based on current transfer rates and the total data
              size,  how  long it will be before completion.  The countdown is prefixed with “ETA”.  This option
              will have no effect if the total data size cannot be determined.

       <b>-I,</b> <b>--fineta</b>
              Turn the ETA countdown on, but display the estimated local time at which the transfer will finish,
              instead of the amount of time remaining.  When the estimated time is more  than  6  hours  in  the
              future,  the  date  is  shown  as well.  The time is prefixed with “FIN” for finish time.  As with
              “<b>--eta</b>”, this option will have no effect if the total data size cannot be determined.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--rate</b>
              Turn the rate counter on.  This will display the current rate of data transfer.  The rate is shown
              in square brackets “[]”.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--average-rate</b>
              Turn the average rate counter on.  This will display the current average rate  of  data  transfer,
              over  the  last 30 seconds by default (see “<b>--average-rate-window</b>”).  The average rate is shown in
              brackets “()”.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--bytes</b>
              Turn the total byte counter on.  This will display the total amount of data transferred so far.

       <b>-T,</b> <b>--buffer-percent</b>
              Turn on the transfer buffer percentage display.  This will show the  percentage  of  the  transfer
              buffer  in use.  Implies “<b>--no-splice</b>”.  The transfer buffer percentage is shown in curly brackets
              “{}”.

       <b>-A</b> <u>NUM</u>, <b>--last-written</b> <u>NUM</u>
              Show the last <u>NUM</u> bytes written.  Implies “<b>--no-splice</b>”.

       <b>-F</b> <u>FORMAT</u>, <b>--format</b> <u>FORMAT</u>
              Ignore all of the above options and instead use the format string <u>FORMAT</u> to determine  the  output
              format.  See the <b>FORMATTING</b> section below.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--numeric</b>
              Numeric  output.   Instead of giving a visual indication of progress, write an integer percentage,
              one per line, on standard error, suitable for passing to a tool  such  as  <b><a href="../man1/dialog.1.html">dialog</a></b>(1).   Note  that
              “<b>--force</b>” is not required if “<b>--numeric</b>” is being used.

              Combining  “<b>--numeric</b>” with “<b>--bytes</b>” will cause the number of bytes processed so far to be output
              instead of a percentage.  Adding “<b>--line-mode</b>” as well as “<b>--bytes</b>” writes  the  number  of  lines
              instead  of bytes or a percentage.  Adding “<b>--rate</b>” adds the transfer rate to each output line (if
              “<b>--bytes</b>” is also in use, the rate comes after the byte/line count).   Adding  “<b>--timer</b>”  prefixes
              each output line with the elapsed time so far, as a decimal number of seconds.

              Combining  “<b>--numeric</b>”  with  “<b>--format</b>”  allows  for  custom  output.   The default format string
              components for “<b>--numeric</b>” are “<b>%t</b> <b>%b</b> <b>%r</b> <b>%{progress-amount-only}</b>” in that order, each  item  being
              active  or  inactive  according  to  the  rules  above  (so  the  default with no other options is
              “<b>%{progress-amount-only}</b>”.

       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              No output.  Useful if the “<b>--rate-limit</b>” option is being used on its own  to  limit  the  transfer
              rate of a pipe.

   <b>Output</b> <b>modifiers</b>
       <b>-8,</b> <b>--bits</b>
              Use  bits  instead of bytes for the byte and rate counters.  The output suffix will be “b” instead
              of “B”.

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--si</b>
              Display and interpret suffixes as multiples of 1000 rather than the default of  1024.   Note  that
              this only takes effect on options after this one, so for consistency, specify this option first.

       <b>-W,</b> <b>--wait</b>
              Wait  until  the  first  byte  has  been  transferred  before  showing any progress information or
              calculating any ETAs.  Useful if the program you are piping to or from requires extra  information
              before  it  starts,  such  as when piping data into <b><a href="../man1/gpg.1.html">gpg</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/mcrypt.1.html">mcrypt</a></b>(1) which require a passphrase
              before data can be processed.

       <b>-D</b> <u>SEC</u>, <b>--delay-start</b> <u>SEC</u>
              Wait until <u>SEC</u> seconds have passed before showing any  progress  information,  for  example  in  a
              script  where  you only want to show a progress bar if it starts taking a long time.  The value of
              <u>SEC</u> can be a decimal such as “0.5”.

       <b>-s</b> <u>SIZE</u>, <b>--size</b> <u>SIZE</u>
              Assume the total amount of data to be transferred is <u>SIZE</u> bytes when calculating  percentages  and
              ETAs.   A  suffix  of  “K”,  “M”, “G”, or “T” can be added to denote kibibytes (*1024), mebibytes,
              gibibytes, tebibytes.  If “<b>--si</b>” appears  before  this  option,  suffixes  will  denote  kilobytes
              (*1000), megabytes, and so on instead.

              If <u>SIZE</u> starts with “<b>@</b>”, the size of file whose name follows the @ will be used.

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--gauge</b>
              If  the  progress  bar is shown but the size is not known, then instead of moving the bar left and
              right to show progress, show the current transfer rate as a percentage of the maximum rate seen so
              far.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--line-mode</b>
              Instead of counting bytes, count lines (newline characters).  The progress bar will only move when
              a new line is found, and the value passed to “<b>--size</b>” will be interpreted as a line count.

              If this option is used without “<b>--size</b>”, the "total size" (in this  case,  total  line  count)  is
              calculated  by  reading  through  all  input files once before transfer starts.  If any inputs are
              pipes or non-regular files, or are unreadable, the total size will not be calculated.

       <b>-0,</b> <b>--null</b>
              Count lines as terminated with a null byte  instead  of  with  a  newline.   This  option  implies
              “<b>--line-mode</b>”.

       <b>-i</b> <u>SEC</u>, <b>--interval</b> <u>SEC</u>
              Wait <u>SEC</u> seconds between updates.  The default is to update every second.  The value of <u>SEC</u> can be
              a decimal such as “0.1”.

       <b>-m</b> <u>SEC</u>, <b>--average-rate-window</b> <u>SEC</u>
              Compute current average rate over a <u>SEC</u> seconds window for average rate and ETA calculations.  The
              default is 30 seconds.  The value must be an integer.

       <b>-w</b> <u>WIDTH</u>, <b>--width</b> <u>WIDTH</u>
              Assume  the terminal is <u>WIDTH</u> columns wide, instead of trying to work it out (or assuming 80 if it
              cannot be guessed).  If this option is used, the output width will not be adjusted if the width of
              the terminal changes while the transfer is running.

       <b>-H</b> <u>HEIGHT</u>, <b>--height</b> <u>HEIGHT</u>
              Assume the terminal is <u>HEIGHT</u> rows high, instead of trying to work it out (or assuming  25  if  it
              cannot  be guessed).  If this option is used, the output height will not be adjusted if the height
              of the terminal changes while the transfer is running.

       <b>-N</b> <u>NAME</u>, <b>--name</b> <u>NAME</u>
              Prefix the output information with <u>NAME</u>.  Useful in conjunction with  “<b>--cursor</b>”  if  you  have  a
              complicated pipeline and you want to be able to tell different parts of it apart.

       <b>-u</b> <u>STYLE</u>, <b>--bar-style</b> <u>STYLE</u>
              Change  the  default  progress  bar  style  shown  by “<b>--progress</b>”, or by the “<b>--format</b>” sequences
              “<b>%{progress}</b>” or “<b>%{progress-bar-only}</b>”, to <u>STYLE</u>.  The <u>STYLE</u> can be one of <b>plain</b>  (the  default),
              <b>block</b>, <b>granular</b>, or <b>shaded</b>.  These styles are described in the <b>FORMATTING</b> section below.

       <b>-x</b> <u>SPEC</u>, <b>--extra-display</b> <u>SPEC</u>
              As well as displaying progress to the terminal, also write it to <u>SPEC</u>.  The <u>SPEC</u> must start with a
              comma-separated  list  of  destinations,  and  can  optionally be followed by a colon and a format
              string.  The  destinations  can  be  <b>windowtitle</b>  or  <b>window</b>  for  the  xterm  window  title,  and
              <b>processtitle</b>,  <b>proctitle</b>,  <b>process</b>, or <b>proc</b> for the process title displayed by <b><a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</a></b>(1).  If a format
              string  is  not  supplied,  the  same  format  is  used  as  for  the  terminal.    For   example,
              “<b>-x</b>  <b>'window,process:%t</b>  <b>%b</b>  <b>%r'</b>” will show the elapsed time, bytes transferred, and rate, in both
              the window title and the process title.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--stats</b>
              At the end of the transfer, write an additional line showing the transfer rate  minimum,  maximum,
              mean, and standard deviation.  The values are always in bytes per second (or bits, with “<b>--bits</b>”).

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--force</b>
              Force  output.   Normally,  <b>pv</b>  will  not  output  any  visual  display if standard error is not a
              terminal.  This option forces it to do so.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--cursor</b>
              Use cursor positioning escape sequences instead of just using carriage returns.  This is useful in
              conjunction with “<b>--name</b>” if you are using multiple <b>pv</b> invocations in a single pipeline.

   <b>Data</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>modifiers</b>
       <b>-o</b> <u>FILE</u>, <b>--output</b> <u>FILE</u>
              Write data to <u>FILE</u> instead of standard output.  If the file already exists, it will be truncated.

       <b>-L</b> <u>RATE</u>, <b>--rate-limit</b> <u>RATE</u>
              Limit the transfer to a maximum of <u>RATE</u> bytes per second.  The same suffixes as  “<b>--size</b>”  can  be
              used.

       <b>-B</b> <u>BYTES</u>, <b>--buffer-size</b> <u>BYTES</u>
              Use  a  transfer  buffer  size  of  <u>BYTES</u>  bytes.  The same suffixes as “<b>--size</b>” can be used.  The
              default buffer size is the block size of the input file's  filesystem  multiplied  by  32  (512KiB
              max),  or  400KiB  if  the  block size cannot be determined.  This can be useful on platforms like
              macOS with pipelines that perform better  with  specific  buffer  sizes  such  as  1024.   Implies
              “<b>--no-splice</b>”.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>--no-splice</b>
              Never  use  <b><a href="../man2/splice.2.html">splice</a></b>(2), even if it would normally be possible.  The <b><a href="../man2/splice.2.html">splice</a></b>(2) system call is a more
              efficient way of transferring data from or to a pipe than regular <b><a href="../man2/read.2.html">read</a></b>(2) and <b><a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a></b>(2), but  means
              that  the  transfer buffer may not be used.  This prevents “<b>--buffer-percent</b>” and “<b>--last-written</b>”
              from working, cannot work with “<b>--discard</b>”, and makes “<b>--buffer-size</b>” redundant, so using  any  of
              those  options  automatically  switches  on  “<b>--no-splice</b>”.  Switching on this option results in a
              small loss of transfer efficiency.  It has no effect on systems where <b><a href="../man2/splice.2.html">splice</a></b>(2) is unavailable.

       <b>-E,</b> <b>--skip-errors</b>
              Ignore read errors by attempting to skip past the offending sections.  The corresponding parts  of
              the  output  will be null bytes.  At first only a few bytes will be skipped, but if there are many
              errors in a row then the skips will move up to chunks of 512.  This is intended to be  similar  to
              “<u>dd</u> <u>conv=sync,noerror</u>”.

              Specify “<b>--skip-errors</b>” twice to only report a read error once per file, instead of reporting each
              byte range skipped.

       <b>-Z</b> <u>BYTES</u>, <b>--error-skip-block</b> <u>BYTES</u>
              When  ignoring  read  errors with “<b>--skip-errors</b>”, instead of trying to adaptively skip by reading
              small amounts and skipping progressively larger sections until a read succeeds, move to  the  next
              file block of <u>BYTES</u> bytes as soon as an error occurs.  There may still be some shorter skips where
              the  block  being  skipped  coincides  with  the end of the transfer buffer.  The same suffixes as
              “<b>--size</b>” can be used.

              This option can only be used with “<b>--skip-errors</b>” and is intended for  use  when  reading  from  a
              block  device,  such  as “<b>--skip-errors</b> <b>--error-skip-block</b> <b>4K</b>” to skip in 4 kibibyte blocks.  This
              will speed up reads from faulty media, at the expense of potentially losing more data.

       <b>-S,</b> <b>--stop-at-size</b>
              If a size was specified with “<b>--size</b>”, stop transferring data  once  that  many  bytes  have  been
              written, instead of continuing to the end of input.

       <b>-Y,</b> <b>--sync</b>
              After every write operation, synchronise the buffer caches to disk with <b><a href="../man2/fdatasync.2.html">fdatasync</a></b>(2).  This has no
              effect  when  the  output  is a pipe.  Using “<b>--sync</b>” may improve the accuracy of the progress bar
              when writing to a slow disk.

       <b>-K,</b> <b>--direct-io</b>
              Set the <b>O_DIRECT</b> flag on all inputs and outputs, if it  is  available.   This  will  minimise  the
              effect  of  caches, at the cost of performance.  Due to memory alignment requirements, it also may
              cause read or write failures with an error  of  “Invalid  argument”,  especially  if  reading  and
              writing files across a variety of filesystems in a single <b>pv</b> call.  Use this option with caution.

       <b>-X,</b> <b>--discard</b>
              Instead  of  transferring  input  data  to  standard  output,  discard  it.  This is equivalent to
              redirecting standard  output  to  <u>/dev/null</u>,  except  that  <b><a href="../man2/write.2.html">write</a></b>(2)  is  never  called.   Implies
              “<b>--no-splice</b>”.

       <b>-U</b> <u>FILE</u>, <b>--store-and-forward</b> <u>FILE</u>
              Instead  of passing data through immediately, do it in two stages - first read all input and write
              it to <u>FILE</u>, and then once the input is exhausted, read all of <u>FILE</u> and write  it  to  the  output.
              <u>FILE</u>  remains in place afterwards, unless it is “<b>-</b>”, in which case <b>pv</b> creates a temporary file for
              this purpose, and automatically removes it afterwards.

              This can be useful if you have a pipeline which generates data (your input) quickly but you  don't
              know  the  size,  and  you  wish to pass it to some slower process, once all of the input has been
              generated and you know its size, so you can see its progress.  Note  that  when  doing  this  with
              relatively  small  amounts of data, “<b>--no-splice</b>” may be preferable so that pipe buffering doesn't
              affect the progress display.

   <b>Alternative</b> <b>operating</b> <b>modes</b>
       <b>-d</b> <u>PID</u>[<b>:</b><u>FD</u>], <b>--watchfd</b> <u>PID</u>[<b>:</b><u>FD</u>]
              Instead of transferring data, watch file descriptor <u>FD</u> of process <u>PID</u>, and show its progress.  The
              <b>pv</b> process will exit when <u>FD</u> either changes to a different file, changes read/write  mode,  or  is
              closed; other data transfer modifiers - and remote control - may not be used with this option.

              If  only  a  <u>PID</u>  is specified, then that process will be watched, and all regular files and block
              devices it opens will be shown with a progress bar.  The <b>pv</b> process will  exit  when  process  <u>PID</u>
              exits.

       <b>-R</b> <u>PID</u>, <b>--remote</b> <u>PID</u>
              Remotely  control  another instance of <b>pv</b> with process ID <u>PID</u>, making it act as though it had been
              given this instance's command line.  For example,  if  “<b>pv</b>  <b>--rate-limit</b>  <b>123K</b>”  is  running  with
              process  ID  9876,  then  running  “<b>pv</b> <b>--remote</b> <b>9876</b> <b>--rate-limit</b> <b>321K</b>” will cause process 9876 to
              start using a rate limit of 321KiB instead of 123KiB.  Note that some options  cannot  be  changed
              while running, such as “<b>--cursor</b>”, “<b>--line-mode</b>”, “<b>--force</b>”, “<b>--delay-start</b>”, “<b>--skip-errors</b>”, and
              “<b>--stop-at-size</b>”.

   <b>Other</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>-P</b> <u>FILE</u>, <b>--pidfile</b> <u>FILE</u>
              Save  the  process  ID of <b>pv</b> in <u>FILE</u>.  The file will be replaced if it already exists, and will be
              removed when <b>pv</b> exits.  While <b>pv</b> is running, <u>FILE</u> will contain a single number - the process ID of
              <b>pv</b> - followed by a newline.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Print version information on standard output and exit successfully.

</pre><h4><b>FORMATTING</b></h4><pre>
       Format strings used by “<b>--format</b>” and “<b>--extra-display</b>” can contain the following sequences:

       <b>%p</b>, <b>%{progress}</b>
              Progress bar (suffixed with a percentage if the  size  is  known).   Equivalent  to  “<b>--progress</b>”.
              Expands  to  fill the remaining space unless prefixed by a number to set the width, such as “<b>%20p</b>”
              or “<b>%20{progress}</b>”.

       <b>%{progress-bar-only}</b>
              Progress bar, without any sides, and without any percentage displayed afterwards.  Expands to fill
              the remaining space unless prefixed by a number.

       <b>%{progress-amount-only}</b>
              The percentage completion (or maximum rate, with “<b>--gauge</b>” when the size is unknown).

       <b>%{bar-plain}</b>
              Progress bar in the standard plain format, without any sides, and without any percentage displayed
              afterwards.  Expands to fill the remaining space unless prefixed by a number.

       <b>%{bar-block}</b>
              Progress bar using Unicode full blocks, without any sides, and without  any  percentage  displayed
              afterwards.   Expands to fill the remaining space unless prefixed by a number.  If UTF-8 output is
              not available, the plain format is used.

       <b>%{bar-granular}</b>
              Progress bar using Unicode full blocks, and 1/8th blocks  for  partial  fills,  providing  a  more
              granular  display.   Like  the  other  “%{bar}”  strings this shows the bar without any sides, and
              without any percentage displayed afterwards, and  expands  to  fill  the  remaining  space  unless
              prefixed by a number.  If UTF-8 output is not available, the plain format is used.

       <b>%{bar-shaded}</b>
              Progress  bar  using Unicode full blocks and shade characters - dark and medium shade are used for
              partial fills, and the light shade is used for the background.  Like the  other  “%{bar}”  strings
              this shows the bar without any sides, and without any percentage displayed afterwards, and expands
              to  fill  the  remaining space unless prefixed by a number.  If UTF-8 output is not available, the
              plain format is used.

       <b>%t</b>, <b>%{timer}</b>
              Elapsed time.  Equivalent to “<b>--timer</b>”.

       <b>%e</b>, <b>%{eta}</b>
              ETA as time remaining.  Equivalent to “<b>--eta</b>”.

       <b>%I</b>, <b>%{fineta}</b>
              ETA as local time at which the transfer will finish.  Equivalent to “<b>--fineta</b>”.

       <b>%r</b>, <b>%{rate}</b>
              Current data transfer rate.  Equivalent to “<b>--rate</b>”.

       <b>%a</b>, <b>%{average-rate}</b>
              Average data transfer rate.  Equivalent to “<b>--average-rate</b>”.

       <b>%b</b>, <b>%{bytes}</b>, <b>%{transferred}</b>
              Bytes transferred so far (or lines if “<b>--line-mode</b>” was specified).  Equivalent to “<b>--bytes</b>”.   If
              “<b>--bits</b>” was specified, “<b>%b</b>” shows the bits transferred so far, not bytes.

       <b>%T</b>, <b>%{buffer-percent}</b>
              Percentage of the transfer buffer in use.  Equivalent to “<b>--buffer-percent</b>”.  Displays “{----}” if
              the  transfer  is  being  done  with  <b><a href="../man2/splice.2.html">splice</a></b>(2),  since splicing to or from pipes does not use the
              buffer.

       <b>%nA</b>, <b>%n{last-written}</b>
              Show the last <u>n</u> bytes written (for example, “<b>%16A</b>” shows the last 16 bytes).  Shows only  dots  if
              the  transfer  is  being  done  with  <b><a href="../man2/splice.2.html">splice</a></b>(2),  since splicing to or from pipes does not use the
              buffer.

       <b>%nL</b>, <b>%n{previous-line}</b>
              Show the first <u>n</u> bytes of the most recently written line (for example, “<b>%40L</b>” shows the  first  40
              bytes).   If  no  <u>n</u> is given, then this expands to fill the available space.  Shows only spaces if
              the transfer is being done with <b><a href="../man2/splice.2.html">splice</a></b>(2).

       <b>%N</b>, <b>%{name}</b>
              Show the name prefix given by “<b>--name</b>”.  Padded to 9 characters with  spaces,  and  suffixed  with
              “:”.

       <b>%{sgr:colour,...}</b>
              Emit  ECMA-48  SGR  (Select  Graphic  Rendition)  codes  if  the  terminal supports colours, where
              <u>colour,...</u> is a comma-separated list of any of the keywords below,  or  the  numeric  values  from
              <b><a href="../man4/console_codes.4.html">console_codes</a></b>(4).  If colour support is not available, nothing is emitted.

              Supported  keywords  are:  <b>reset</b> or <b>none</b>, <b>black</b>, <b>red</b>, <b>green</b>, <b>brown</b> or <b>yellow</b>, <b>blue</b>, <b>magenta</b>, <b>cyan</b>,
              <b>white</b>, <b>fg-black</b>, <b>fg-red</b>, <b>fg-green</b>, <b>fg-brown</b> or <b>fg-yellow</b>, <b>fg-blue</b>, <b>fg-magenta</b>, <b>fg-cyan</b>,  <b>fg-white</b>,
              <b>fg-default</b>,  <b>bg-black</b>,  <b>bg-red</b>,  <b>bg-green</b>,  <b>bg-brown</b>  or  <b>bg-yellow</b>, <b>bg-blue</b>, <b>bg-magenta</b>, <b>bg-cyan</b>,
              <b>bg-white</b>, <b>bg-default</b>, <b>bold</b>, <b>dim</b>, <b>italic</b>, <b>underscore</b>  or  <b>underline</b>,  <b>blink</b>,  <b>reverse</b>,  <b>no-bold</b>  or
              <b>no-dim</b>, <b>no-italic</b>, <b>no-underscore</b> or <b>no-underline</b>, <b>no-blink</b>, <b>no-reverse</b>.

              With  colours,  the  optional  "fg-"  prefix  indicates  foreground;  a  prefix of "bg-" indicates
              background.

              For example, “<b>%{sgr:green,bold}TEXT%{sgr:reset}</b>“ will make <u>TEXT</u> bold green on supported terminals.

       <b>%%</b>     A single “%”.

       Any other contents are reproduced in the progress display as-is.

       The format string equivalent of the default display switches is “<b>%b</b> <b>%t</b> <b>%r</b> <b>%p</b> <b>%e</b>”.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Some suggested common switch combinations:

       <b>pv</b> <b>-ptebar</b>
              Show a progress bar, elapsed time, estimated completion time,  byte  counter,  average  rate,  and
              current rate.

       <b>pv</b> <b>-betlap</b>
              Show  a  progress  bar,  elapsed  time, estimated completion time, line counter, and average rate,
              counting lines instead of bytes.

       <b>pv</b> <b>-btrpg</b>
              Show the amount transferred, elapsed time, current rate, and a gauge showing the current rate as a
              percentage of the maximum rate seen - useful in a pipeline where the total size is  unknown.   (If
              the size <u>is</u> known, these options will show the percentage completion instead of the rate gauge).

       <b>pv</b> <b>-t</b>  Show only the elapsed time - useful as a simple timer, such as “<b>sleep</b> <b>10m</b> <b>|</b> <b>pv</b> <b>-t</b>”.

       <b>pv</b> <b>-pterb</b>
              The  default  behaviour:  progress bar, elapsed time, estimated completion time, current rate, and
              byte counter.

       On macOS, it may be  useful  to  specify  “<b>--buffer-size</b>  <b>1024</b>”  in  a  pipeline,  as  this  may  improve
       performance.

       To watch how quickly a file is transferred using <b><a href="../man1/nc.1.html">nc</a></b>(1):

           pv file | nc -w 1 somewhere.com 3000

       A similar example, transferring a file from another process and passing the expected size to <b>pv</b>:

           cat file | pv --size 12345 | nc -w 1 somewhere.com 3000

       To watch the progress of creating a tar.gz archive:

           tar cf - directory/ \
           | pv --size $(du -sb directory/ | awk '{print $1}') \
           | gzip -9 \
           &gt; out.tar.gz

       Taking an image of a disk, skipping errors:

           pv -EE /dev/your/disk/device &gt; disk-image.img

       Writing an image back to a disk:

           pv disk-image.img &gt; /dev/your/disk/device

       Zeroing a disk:

           pv &lt; /dev/zero &gt; /dev/your/disk/device

       Note  that if the input size cannot be calculated, and the output is a block device, then the size of the
       block device will be used and <b>pv</b> will automatically stop at that size as  if  “<b>--stop-at-size</b>”  had  been
       given.

       (Linux and macOS only): Watching file descriptor 3 opened by another process 1234:

           pv --watchfd 1234:3

       (Linux and macOS only): Watching all file descriptors used by process 1234:

           pv --watchfd 1234

       Rate-limiting the transfer between two processes in a pipeline, with no display:

           producer | pv --quiet --rate-limit 1M | consumer

       Sending logs to a processing script, showing the most recent line as part of the progress display:

           pv --format '%a %p : %L' big.log | processing-script

       Showing progress as lines of JSON data:

           pv --numeric --format '{"elapsed":%t,"bytes":%b,"rate":%r,"percentage":%{progress-amount-only}}' big.log | processing-script

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       An exit status of 1 indicates a problem with the “<b>--remote</b>” or “<b>--pidfile</b>” options.

       Any other exit status is a bitmask of the following:

        <b>2</b>   One or more files could not be accessed, <b><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></b>(2)ed, or opened.

        <b>4</b>   An input file was the same as the output file.

        <b>8</b>   Internal error with closing a file or moving to the next file.

        <b>16</b>  There was an error while transferring data from one or more input files.

        <b>32</b>  A signal was caught that caused an early exit.

        <b>64</b>  Memory allocation failed.

       A zero exit status indicates no problems.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables may affect <b>pv</b>:

       <b>HOME</b>   The current user's home directory.  This may be used by “<b>--remote</b>” to exchange messages between <b>pv</b>
              instances: if the <u>/run/user/UID/</u> directory does not exist (where <u>UID</u> is the current user ID), then
              <u>$HOME/.pv/</u> will be used instead.

       <b>TMPDIR</b>, <b>TMP</b>
              The  directory  to create per-tty lock files for the terminal when using “<b>--cursor</b>”.  If <b>TMPDIR</b> is
              set to a non-empty value, it is the directory under which lock files are created.  Otherwise,  <b>TMP</b>
              is used.  If neither are set, then <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> is used.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       In  some  versions  of <b><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/zsh.1.html">zsh</a></b>(1), the construct “<b>&lt;(pv</b> <b>filename)</b>” will not output any progress to
       the terminal when run from an interactive shell, due to the subprocess being run in  a  separate  process
       group from the one that owns the terminal.  In these cases, use “<b>--force</b>”.

       If  <b>pv</b>  is  used in a pipeline in <b>zsh</b> version 5.8, and the last command in the pipeline is based on shell
       builtins, <b>zsh</b> takes control of the terminal away from <b>pv</b>, preventing progress from being displayed.   For
       example, this will produce no progress bar:

           pv InputFile | { while read -r line; do sleep 0.1; done; }

       To  work  around  this,  put  the  last commands of the pipeline in normal brackets to force the use of a
       subshell:

           pv InputFile | ( while read -r line; do sleep 0.1; done; )

       Refer to issue #105 for full details.

       The “<b>--remote</b>” option requires that either <u><a href="file:/run/user/">/run/user/</a>&lt;uid&gt;/</u> or <u>$HOME/</u>  can  be  written  to,  for  inter-
       process communication.

       The  “<b>--size</b>”  option  has  no  effect  if  used  with “<b>--watchfd</b> <u>PID</u>” to watch all file descriptors of a
       process, but will work with “<b>--watchfd</b> <u>PID</u>:<u>FD</u>” to watch a single file descriptor.

       If the input size cannot be calculated, and the output is a block device, then <b>pv</b> will  read  the  output
       device's size, use that as if it had been passed to “<b>--size</b>”, and activate “<b>--stop-at-size</b>”.

       The  “<b>%nA</b>” and “<b>%nL</b>” format sequences may not be effective with small input files, and “<b>%nL</b>” may be a few
       lines out due to buffering within the pipeline itself.

       Numbers passed  to  “<b>--size</b>”,  “<b>--rate-limit</b>”,  “<b>--buffer-size</b>”,  and  “<b>--error-skip-block</b>”  may  all  be
       expressed  as  decimals  if  followed  by  a  suffix,  so  for  example  “<u>--size</u>  <u>1.5G</u>”  is equivalent to
       “<u>--size</u> <u>1536M</u>”.

       Numbers passed to “<b>--interval</b>” and “<b>--delay-start</b>” may be integers  or  decimals,  but  may  not  have  a
       suffix.

       Numbers  passed  to “<b>--last-written</b>”, “<b>--width</b>”, “<b>--height</b>”, “<b>--average-rate-window</b>”, and “<b>--remote</b>” must
       be integers with no suffix.
