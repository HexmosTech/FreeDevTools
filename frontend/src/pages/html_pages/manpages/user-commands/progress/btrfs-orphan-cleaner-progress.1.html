       btrfs-orphan-cleaner-progress - show progress information about background deletion of btrfs subvolumes

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>btrfs-orphan-cleaner-progress</b> [<u>args</u>] <u>mountpoint</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>btrfs-orphan-cleaner-progress</b> program shows live progress of the deletion of subvolumes that is
       happening in the background.

       Ever deleted too many subvolumes at the same time, resulting in having a kernel thread "btrfs-cleaner" go
       wild using cpu or writing to disk? There's no way to stop this process any more, but at least we can get
       a good idea what progress it is making.

       Because the needed information is retrieved using the btrfs kernel API, it has to be run as root.

       <b>btrfs-orphan-cleaner-progress</b> shows the amount of orphaned subvolumes that are waiting to be removed. If
       current one that is being processed takes more than a fraction of time, progress will be reported with 2
       minute intervals.

       Example output:
