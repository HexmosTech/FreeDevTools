</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       remake - GNU make utility to maintain groups of programs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>remake</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... [<u>TARGET</u>]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>remake</u>  utility  will determine automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
       and issue the commands to recompile them.  The manual describes the GNU implementation of <b>make</b> from which
       remake is derived, which was written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is currently  maintained
       by  Paul  Smith.   Extended  error  reporting,  debugger,  and profiling extensions were written by Rocky
       Bernstein.  Our examples show C programs, since they are very common, but you can  use  <b>remake</b>  with  any
       programming  language  whose  compiler  can be run with a shell command.  In fact, <b>remake</b> or <b>make</b> are not
       limited to programs.  You can use it to describe any task where some files must be updated  automatically
       from others whenever the others change.

       To  prepare  to  use  <b>remake</b>,  you must write a file called the <u>makefile</u> that describes the relationships
       among files in your program, and the states the commands for updating each file.  In a program, typically
       the executable file is updated from object files, which are in turn made by compiling source files.

       Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change some source files, this simple shell command:

              <b>remake</b>

       suffices to perform all necessary recompilations.  The <b>remake</b> program uses the makefile  description  and
       the  last-modification  times  of the files to decide which of the files need to be updated.  For each of
       those files, it issues the commands recorded in the makefile.

       <b>remake</b> executes commands in the <u>makefile</u> to update one or more target <u>names</u>, where <u>name</u>  is  typically  a
       program.   If  no  <b>-f</b>  option  is  present, <b>remake</b> will look for the makefiles <u>GNUmakefile</u>, <u>makefile</u>, and
       <u>Makefile</u>, in that order.

       Normally you should call your makefile either <u>makefile</u> or <u>Makefile</u>.  (We recommend  <u>Makefile</u>  because  it
       appears  prominently  near the beginning of a directory listing, right near other important files such as
       <u>README</u>.)  The first name checked, <u>GNUmakefile</u>, is not recommended for most  makefiles.   You  should  use
       this  name  if  you  have  a makefile that is specific to GNU <b>remake,</b> and will not be understood by other
       versions of <b>remake</b>.  If <u>makefile</u> is '-', the standard input is read.

       <b>remake</b> updates a target if it depends on prerequisite files that have been modified since the target  was
       last modified, or if the target does not exist.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Below  we  give options that are specific to <b>remake</b>.  For the other options, please refer to the GNU Make
       documentation

       <b>-c</b>, <b>--search-parent</b>
            if a Makefile or goal target isn't found in the current directory, <b>remake</b> will search in the  parent
            directory  for  a Makefile. On finding a parent the closest parent directory with a Makefile, <b>remake</b>
            will set its current working directory to the directory where the Makefile was found.

            In this respect the short option '-c', is like '-C' except no directory need to be specified.

       <b>-!</b>, <b>--post-mortem</b>
            Go into the debugger on an error. This is the Same as options: --debugger --debugger-stop=error

       <b>-P,</b>  <b>--profile</b> <b>[=TYPE]</b>
            Enables timing and dependency profiling output using the specified <u>TYPE</u> for formatting.  <u>TYPE</u> can be
            either <u>callgrind</u> or <u>json</u>.  If omitted, it defaults to <u>callgrind</u>.  Files  generated  using  <u>callgrind</u>
            can  be  analyzed with kcachegrind, callgrind_annotate, or gprof2dot. Files generated with <u>json</u> have
            the format specified in the <u>info</u> manual.

       <b>--profile-directory=[PATH]</b>
            Specifies the <u>PATH</u> that profiling files should be written to. Must exist before running <u>make</u>.  It is
            assumed to be a relative path to the initial directory where <u>make</u> is called, unless it begins with a
            ~ or <a href="file:/.">/.</a>

       <b>--targets</b>
            Print a list of explicitly-named targets found in read-in makefiles.

       <b>--tasks</b>
            Print a list of explicitly-named targets found in read-in makefiles which have description comments.
            A description comment is added by putting a single comment before the target that starts with '#:'.

       <b>-x,</b>  <b>--trace</b> <b>[=FLAGS]</b>
            Set trace flags If the <u>FLAGS</u> are omitted, then the behavior is the same  as  if  <b>--trace=normal</b>  was
            specified.   <u>FLAGS</u> may be <u>read</u> for tracing Makefiles read in, <u>noshell</u> which is like <u>normal</u> but shell
            tracing is disabled, or <u>full</u> for maximum tracing.

       <b>-X,</b> <b>--debugger</b> <b>[=TYPE]</b>
            Enter debugger with If the <u>TYPE</u> are omitted, then the behavior is the same as  if  <b>--debugger=normal</b>
            was  specified.   <u>TYPE</u>  may  be  <u>goal</u>  for  all tracing Makefiles read <u>preread</u> which stop before any
            Makefiles are read <u>goal</u> which stops after the goal target is built <u>normal</u> which is the same as given
            no option <u>preaction</u> which is like <u>normal</u> but shell tracing is disabled <u>full</u> for maximum tracing.  It
            is  the  same  as  giving all of the options except "normal" .  <u>fatal</u> for entering the debugger on a
            fatal error, <u>error</u> for entering the debugger on an error

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       The full documentation for <b>remake</b> is maintained as a Texinfo manual.  If the <b>info</b> and <b>remake</b> programs are
       properly installed at your site, the command

              <b>info</b> <b>remake</b>

       should give you access to the <b>remake</b> manual.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Since this is derived from GNU Make, it most of its bugs.

       See the chapter ``Problems and Bugs'' in <u>The</u> <u>GNU</u> <u>Make</u> <u>Manual</u>.

       For <b>remake</b> -specifc bugs see <u>https://github.com/rocky/remake/issues/</u>.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>GNU</u> <u>make</u> from which <u>remake</u> is derived, was written by Richard Stallman and  Roland  McGrath,  and  is
       currently maintained by Paul Smith.

       However  <u>remake</u> is the brainstorm of Rocky Bernstein. The help of others though has been, and is, greatly
       appreciated.  Michael Lord Welles however thought of the name, <u>remake</u>.
