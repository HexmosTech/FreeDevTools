</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       memcached - high-performance memory object caching system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>memcached</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents briefly the <b>memcached</b> memory object caching daemon.

       <b>memcached</b>  is  a flexible memory object caching daemon designed to alleviate database load in dynamic web
       applications by storing objects in memory.  It's based on libevent to scale to any size  needed,  and  is
       specifically optimized to avoid swapping and always use non-blocking I/O.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax. A summary of options is included below.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--unix-socket=&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Unix socket path to listen on (disables network support).

       <b>-A,</b> <b>--enable-shutdown</b>
              Enable ascii "shutdown" command.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--unix-mask=&lt;perms&gt;</b>
              Permissions (in octal format) for Unix socket created with -s option.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--listen=&lt;addr&gt;</b>
              Listen  on  &lt;addr&gt;;  default  to  INADDR_ANY.  &lt;addr&gt; may be specified as host:port.  If you don't
              specify a port number, the value you specified with -p or -U is used.  You  may  specify  multiple
              addresses  separated  by  comma  or  by  using  -l  multiple times. This is an important option to
              consider as there is no other way to secure the installation. Binding to an internal or firewalled
              network interface is suggested.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--daemon</b>
              Run memcached as a daemon.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--user=&lt;username&gt;</b>
              Assume the identity of &lt;username&gt; (only when run as root).

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--memory-limit=&lt;num&gt;</b>
              Use &lt;num&gt; MB memory max to use for object storage; the default is 64 megabytes.

       <b>-c,</b> <b>--conn-limit=&lt;num&gt;</b>
              Use &lt;num&gt; max simultaneous connections; the default is 1024.

       <b>-R,</b> <b>--max-reqs-per-event=&lt;num&gt;</b>
              This option seeks to prevent client starvation by setting a limit  to  the  number  of  sequential
              requests  the  server  will  process  from  an individual client connection. Once a connection has
              exceeded this value, the server will attempt to process I/O on other connections  before  handling
              any further request from this connection. The default value for this option is 20.

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--lock-memory</b>
              Lock  down all paged memory. This is a somewhat dangerous option with large caches, so consult the
              README and memcached homepage for configuration suggestions.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--port=&lt;num&gt;</b>
              Listen on TCP port &lt;num&gt;, the default is port 11211. 0 means off.

       <b>-U,</b> <b>--udp-port=&lt;num&gt;</b>
              Listen on UDP port &lt;num&gt;, the default is port 0, which is off.

       <b>-M,</b> <b>--disable-evictions</b>
              Disable automatic removal of items from the cache when out  of  memory.   Additions  will  not  be
              possible until adequate space is freed up.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--enable-coredumps</b>
              Raise the core file size limit to the maximum allowable.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--slab-growth-factor=&lt;factor&gt;</b>
              Use  &lt;factor&gt; as the multiplier for computing the sizes of memory chunks that items are stored in.
              A lower value may result in less wasted memory depending on the total amount of  memory  available
              and the distribution of item sizes.  The default is 1.25.

       <b>-n,</b> <b>--slab-min-size=&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Allocate  a  minimum of &lt;size&gt; bytes for the item key, value, and flags. The default is 48. If you
              have a lot of small keys and values, you can get a significant memory efficiency gain with a lower
              value. If you use a high chunk growth factor (-f option), on the  other  hand,  you  may  want  to
              increase  the  size  to  allow a bigger percentage of your items to fit in the most densely packed
              (smallest) chunks.

       <b>-C,</b> <b>--disable-cas</b>
              Disable the use of CAS (and reduce the per-item size by 8 bytes).

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Show the version of memcached and a summary of options.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Be verbose during the event loop; print out errors and warnings.

       <b>-vv</b>    Be even more verbose; same as -v but also print client commands and responses.

       <b>-vvv</b>   Be extremely verbose; same of the above and also print internal state transitions.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--license</b>
              Print memcached and libevent licenses.

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--pidfile=&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Print pidfile to &lt;filename&gt;, only used under -d option.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--threads=&lt;threads&gt;</b>
              Number of threads to use to process incoming requests. This option is only meaningful if memcached
              was compiled with thread support enabled. It is typically not useful to set this higher  than  the
              number  of CPU cores on the memcached server. Setting a high number (64 or more) of worker threads
              is not recommended. The default is 4.

       <b>-D</b> <b>&lt;char&gt;</b>
              Use &lt;char&gt; as the delimiter between key prefixes and  IDs.  This  is  used  for  per-prefix  stats
              reporting.  The default is ":" (colon). If this option is specified, stats collection is turned on
              automatically; if not, then it may be turned on by sending the "stats detail on"  command  to  the
              server.

       <b>-L,</b> <b>--enable-largepages</b>
              Try  to  use  large  memory pages (if available). Increasing the memory page size could reduce the
              number of TLB misses and improve the performance. In  order  to  get  large  pages  from  the  OS,
              memcached  will  allocate  the total item-cache in one large chunk. Only available if supported on
              your OS.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--listen-backlog=&lt;num&gt;</b>
              Set the backlog queue limit to &lt;num&gt; connections. The default is 1024.

       <b>-B,</b> <b>--protocol=&lt;proto&gt;</b>
              Specify  the  binding  protocol  to  use.   By  default,  the  server  will  autonegotiate  client
              connections.   By  using  this  option, you can specify the protocol clients must speak.  Possible
              options are "auto" (the default, autonegotiation behavior), "ascii" and "binary".

       <b>-I,</b> <b>--max-item-size=&lt;size&gt;</b>
              Adjusting this value changes the item size limit. The default value  for  this  parameter  is  1m,
              minimum is 1k, max is 1G (1024 * 1024 * 1024).

       <b>-S,</b> <b>--enable-sasl</b>
              Turn  on  SASL  authentication. This option is only meaningful if memcached was compiled with SASL
              support enabled.

       <b>-F,</b> <b>--disable-flush-all</b>
              Disables the "flush_all" command. The cmd_flush counter will increment, but clients  will  receive
              an error message and the flush will not occur.

       <b>-X,</b> <b>--disable-dumping</b>
              Disables the "stats cachedump" and "lru_crawler metadump" commands.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--extended=&lt;options&gt;</b>
              Comma separated list of extended or experimental options. See -h or wiki for up to date list.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              print version and exit
