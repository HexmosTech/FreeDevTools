       <b>swift-object-updater</b> - OpenStack Swift object updater

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>swift-object-updater</b> [CONFIG] [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose] [-o|--once]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  object  updater is responsible for updating object information in container listings.  It will check
       to see if there are any locally queued updates on the filesystem of each devices, what is also  known  as
       async pending file(s), walk each one and update the container listing.

       For example, suppose a container server is under load and a new object is put into the system. The object
       will  be immediately available for reads as soon as the proxy server responds to the client with success.
       However, the object server has not been able to update  the  object  listing  in  the  container  server.
       Therefore,  the update would be queued locally for a later update. Container listings, therefore, may not
       immediately contain the object. This is where an eventual consistency window will most likely come in  to
       play.

       In  practice,  the consistency window is only as large as the frequency at which the updater runs and may
       not even be noticed as the proxy server will route listing requests to the first container  server  which
       responds.  The  server under load may not be the one that serves subsequent listing requests â€“ one of the
       other two replicas may handle the listing.

       The options are as follows:

           -v
           --verbose
               log to console
           -o
           --once
               only run one pass of daemon
