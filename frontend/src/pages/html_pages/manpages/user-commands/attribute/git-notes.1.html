</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Adds, removes, or reads notes attached to objects, without touching the objects themselves.

       By default, notes are saved to and read from <b>refs/notes/commits</b>, but this default can be overridden. See
       the OPTIONS, CONFIGURATION, and ENVIRONMENT sections below. If this ref does not exist, it will be
       quietly created when it is first needed to store a note.

       A typical use of notes is to supplement a commit message without changing the commit itself. Notes can be
       shown by <u>git</u> <u>log</u> along with the original commit message. To distinguish these notes from the message
       stored in the commit object, the notes are indented like the message, after an unindented line saying
       "Notes (&lt;refname&gt;):" (or "Notes:" for <b>refs/notes/commits</b>).

       Notes can also be added to patches prepared with <b>git</b> <b>format-patch</b> by using the <b>--notes</b> option. Such notes
       are added as a patch commentary after a three dash separator line.

       To change which notes are shown by <u>git</u> <u>log</u>, see the "notes.displayRef" discussion in the section called
       “CONFIGURATION”.

       See the "notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;" configuration for a way to carry notes across commands that rewrite
       commits.

</pre><h4><b>SUBCOMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       list
           List the notes object for a given object. If no object is given, show a list of all note objects and
           the objects they annotate (in the format "&lt;note-object&gt; &lt;annotated-object&gt;"). This is the default
           subcommand if no subcommand is given.

       add
           Add notes for a given object (defaults to HEAD). Abort if the object already has notes (use <b>-f</b> to
           overwrite existing notes). However, if you’re using <b>add</b> interactively (using an editor to supply the
           notes contents), then - instead of aborting - the existing notes will be opened in the editor (like
           the <b>edit</b> subcommand). If you specify multiple <b>-m</b> and <b>-F</b>, a blank line will be inserted between the
           messages. Use the <b>--separator</b> option to insert other delimiters. You can use <b>-e</b> to edit and fine-tune
           the message(s) supplied from <b>-m</b> and <b>-F</b> options interactively (using an editor) before adding the
           note.

       copy
           Copy the notes for the first object onto the second object (defaults to HEAD). Abort if the second
           object already has notes, or if the first object has none (use -f to overwrite existing notes to the
           second object). This subcommand is equivalent to: <b>git</b> <b>notes</b> <b>add</b> [<b>-f</b>] <b>-C</b> <b>$</b>(<b>git</b> <b>notes</b> <b>list</b>
           <u>&lt;from-object&gt;</u>) <u>&lt;to-object&gt;</u>

           In <b>--stdin</b> mode, take lines in the format

               &lt;from-object&gt; SP &lt;to-object&gt; [ SP &lt;rest&gt; ] LF

           on standard input, and copy the notes from each &lt;from-object&gt; to its corresponding &lt;to-object&gt;. (The
           optional <u>&lt;rest&gt;</u> is ignored so that the command can read the input given to the <b>post-rewrite</b> hook.)

       append
           Append new message(s) given by <b>-m</b> or <b>-F</b> options to an existing note, or add them as a new note if one
           does not exist, for the object (defaults to HEAD). When appending to an existing note, a blank line
           is added before each new message as an inter-paragraph separator. The separator can be customized
           with the <b>--separator</b> option. Edit the notes to be appended given by <b>-m</b> and <b>-F</b> options with <b>-e</b>
           interactively (using an editor) before appending the note.

       edit
           Edit the notes for a given object (defaults to HEAD).

       show
           Show the notes for a given object (defaults to HEAD).

       merge
           Merge the given notes ref into the current notes ref. This will try to merge the changes made by the
           given notes ref (called "remote") since the merge-base (if any) into the current notes ref (called
           "local").

           If conflicts arise and a strategy for automatically resolving conflicting notes (see the "NOTES MERGE
           STRATEGIES" section) is not given, the "manual" resolver is used. This resolver checks out the
           conflicting notes in a special worktree (<b>.git/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE</b>), and instructs the user to
           manually resolve the conflicts there. When done, the user can either finalize the merge with <u>git</u>
           <u>notes</u> <u>merge</u> <u>--commit</u>, or abort the merge with <u>git</u> <u>notes</u> <u>merge</u> <u>--abort</u>.

       remove
           Remove the notes for given objects (defaults to HEAD). When giving zero or one object from the
           command line, this is equivalent to specifying an empty note message to the <b>edit</b> subcommand.

       prune
           Remove all notes for non-existing/unreachable objects.

       get-ref
           Print the current notes ref. This provides an easy way to retrieve the current notes ref (e.g. from
           scripts).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -f, --force
           When adding notes to an object that already has notes, overwrite the existing notes (instead of
           aborting).

       -m &lt;msg&gt;, --message=&lt;msg&gt;
           Use the given note message (instead of prompting). If multiple <b>-m</b> options are given, their values are
           concatenated as separate paragraphs. Lines starting with # and empty lines other than a single line
           between paragraphs will be stripped out. If you wish to keep them verbatim, use <b>--no-stripspace</b>.

       -F &lt;file&gt;, --file=&lt;file&gt;
           Take the note message from the given file. Use <u>-</u> to read the note message from the standard input.
           Lines starting with # and empty lines other than a single line between paragraphs will be stripped
           out. If you wish to keep them verbatim, use <b>--no-stripspace</b>.

       -C &lt;object&gt;, --reuse-message=&lt;object&gt;
           Take the given blob object (for example, another note) as the note message. (Use <b>git</b> <b>notes</b> <b>copy</b>
           <u>&lt;object&gt;</u> instead to copy notes between objects.). By default, message will be copied verbatim, but if
           you wish to strip out the lines starting with # and empty lines other than a single line between
           paragraphs, use with`--stripspace` option.

       -c &lt;object&gt;, --reedit-message=&lt;object&gt;
           Like <u>-C</u>, but with <b>-c</b> the editor is invoked, so that the user can further edit the note message.

       --allow-empty
           Allow an empty note object to be stored. The default behavior is to automatically remove empty notes.

       --[no-]separator, --separator=&lt;paragraph-break&gt;
           Specify a string used as a custom inter-paragraph separator (a newline is added at the end as
           needed). If <b>--no-separator</b>, no separators will be added between paragraphs. Defaults to a blank line.

       --[no-]stripspace
           Strip leading and trailing whitespace from the note message. Also strip out empty lines other than a
           single line between paragraphs. Lines starting with # will be stripped out in non-editor cases like
           <b>-m</b>, <b>-F</b> and <b>-C</b>, but not in editor case like <b>git</b> <b>notes</b> <b>edit</b>, <b>-c</b>, etc.

       --ref &lt;ref&gt;
           Manipulate the notes tree in &lt;ref&gt;. This overrides <b>GIT_NOTES_REF</b> and the "core.notesRef"
           configuration. The ref specifies the full refname when it begins with <b>refs/notes/</b>; when it begins
           with <b>notes/</b>, <b>refs/</b> and otherwise <b>refs/notes/</b> is prefixed to form a full name of the ref.

       --ignore-missing
           Do not consider it an error to request removing notes from an object that does not have notes
           attached to it.

       --stdin
           Also read the object names to remove notes from the standard input (there is no reason you cannot
           combine this with object names from the command line).

       -n, --dry-run
           Do not remove anything; just report the object names whose notes would be removed.

       -s &lt;strategy&gt;, --strategy=&lt;strategy&gt;
           When merging notes, resolve notes conflicts using the given strategy. The following strategies are
           recognized: "manual" (default), "ours", "theirs", "union" and "cat_sort_uniq". This option overrides
           the "notes.mergeStrategy" configuration setting. See the "NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES" section below for
           more information on each notes merge strategy.

       --commit
           Finalize an in-progress <u>git</u> <u>notes</u> <u>merge</u>. Use this option when you have resolved the conflicts that
           <u>git</u> <u>notes</u> <u>merge</u> stored in .git/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE. This amends the partial merge commit created by
           <u>git</u> <u>notes</u> <u>merge</u> (stored in .git/NOTES_MERGE_PARTIAL) by adding the notes in
           .git/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE. The notes ref stored in the .git/NOTES_MERGE_REF symref is updated to the
           resulting commit.

       --abort
           Abort/reset an in-progress <u>git</u> <u>notes</u> <u>merge</u>, i.e. a notes merge with conflicts. This simply removes
           all files related to the notes merge.

       -q, --quiet
           When merging notes, operate quietly.

       -v, --verbose
           When merging notes, be more verbose. When pruning notes, report all object names whose notes are
           removed.

</pre><h4><b>DISCUSSION</b></h4><pre>
       Commit notes are blobs containing extra information about an object (usually information to supplement a
       commit’s message). These blobs are taken from notes refs. A notes ref is usually a branch which contains
       "files" whose paths are the object names for the objects they describe, with some directory separators
       included for performance reasons [1].

       Every notes change creates a new commit at the specified notes ref. You can therefore inspect the history
       of the notes by invoking, e.g., <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>-p</b> <b>notes/commits</b>. Currently the commit message only records which
       operation triggered the update, and the commit authorship is determined according to the usual rules (see
       <b><a href="../man1/git-commit.1.html">git-commit</a></b>(1)). These details may change in the future.

       It is also permitted for a notes ref to point directly to a tree object, in which case the history of the
       notes can be read with <b>git</b> <b>log</b> <b>-p</b> <b>-g</b> <u>&lt;refname&gt;</u>.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>MERGE</b> <b>STRATEGIES</b></h4><pre>
       The default notes merge strategy is "manual", which checks out conflicting notes in a special work tree
       for resolving notes conflicts (<b>.git/NOTES_MERGE_WORKTREE</b>), and instructs the user to resolve the
       conflicts in that work tree. When done, the user can either finalize the merge with <u>git</u> <u>notes</u> <u>merge</u>
       <u>--commit</u>, or abort the merge with <u>git</u> <u>notes</u> <u>merge</u> <u>--abort</u>.

       Users may select an automated merge strategy from among the following using either -s/--strategy option
       or configuring notes.mergeStrategy accordingly:

       "ours" automatically resolves conflicting notes in favor of the local version (i.e. the current notes
       ref).

       "theirs" automatically resolves notes conflicts in favor of the remote version (i.e. the given notes ref
       being merged into the current notes ref).

       "union" automatically resolves notes conflicts by concatenating the local and remote versions.

       "cat_sort_uniq" is similar to "union", but in addition to concatenating the local and remote versions,
       this strategy also sorts the resulting lines, and removes duplicate lines from the result. This is
       equivalent to applying the "cat | sort | uniq" shell pipeline to the local and remote versions. This
       strategy is useful if the notes follow a line-based format where one wants to avoid duplicated lines in
       the merge result. Note that if either the local or remote version contain duplicate lines prior to the
       merge, these will also be removed by this notes merge strategy.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       You can use notes to add annotations with information that was not available at the time a commit was
       written.

           $ git notes add -m 'Tested-by: Johannes Sixt &lt;<a href="mailto:j6t@kdbg.org">j6t@kdbg.org</a>&gt;' 72a144e2
           $ git show -s 72a144e
           [...]

           Notes:
               Tested-by: Johannes Sixt &lt;<a href="mailto:j6t@kdbg.org">j6t@kdbg.org</a>&gt;

       In principle, a note is a regular Git blob, and any kind of (non-)format is accepted. You can
       binary-safely create notes from arbitrary files using <u>git</u> <u>hash-object</u>:

           $ cc *.c
           $ blob=$(git hash-object -w a.out)
           $ git notes --ref=built add --allow-empty -C "$blob" HEAD

       (You cannot simply use <b>git</b> <b>notes</b> <b>--ref=built</b> <b>add</b> <b>-F</b> <b>a.out</b> <b>HEAD</b> because that is not binary-safe.) Of
       course, it doesn’t make much sense to display non-text-format notes with <u>git</u> <u>log</u>, so if you use such
       notes, you’ll probably need to write some special-purpose tools to do something useful with them.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       core.notesRef
           Notes ref to read and manipulate instead of <b>refs/notes/commits</b>. Must be an unabbreviated ref name.
           This setting can be overridden through the environment and command line.

       Everything above this line in this section isn’t included from the <b><a href="../man1/git-config.1.html">git-config</a></b>(1) documentation. The
       content that follows is the same as what’s found there:

       notes.mergeStrategy
           Which merge strategy to choose by default when resolving notes conflicts. Must be one of <b>manual</b>,
           <b>ours</b>, <b>theirs</b>, <b>union</b>, or <b>cat_sort_uniq</b>. Defaults to <b>manual</b>. See the "NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES" section
           of <b><a href="../man1/git-notes.1.html">git-notes</a></b>(1) for more information on each strategy.

           This setting can be overridden by passing the <b>--strategy</b> option to <b><a href="../man1/git-notes.1.html">git-notes</a></b>(1).

       notes.&lt;name&gt;.mergeStrategy
           Which merge strategy to choose when doing a notes merge into refs/notes/&lt;name&gt;. This overrides the
           more general "notes.mergeStrategy". See the "NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES" section in <b><a href="../man1/git-notes.1.html">git-notes</a></b>(1) for more
           information on the available strategies.

       notes.displayRef
           Which ref (or refs, if a glob or specified more than once), in addition to the default set by
           <b>core.notesRef</b> or <b>GIT_NOTES_REF</b>, to read notes from when showing commit messages with the <u>git</u> <u>log</u>
           family of commands.

           This setting can be overridden with the <b>GIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF</b> environment variable, which must be a
           colon separated list of refs or globs.

           A warning will be issued for refs that do not exist, but a glob that does not match any refs is
           silently ignored.

           This setting can be disabled by the <b>--no-notes</b> option to the <u>git</u> <u>log</u> family of commands, or by the
           <b>--notes=</b><u>&lt;ref&gt;</u> option accepted by those commands.

           The effective value of "core.notesRef" (possibly overridden by GIT_NOTES_REF) is also implicitly
           added to the list of refs to be displayed.

       notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;
           When rewriting commits with &lt;command&gt; (currently <b>amend</b> or <b>rebase</b>), if this variable is <b>false</b>, git
           will not copy notes from the original to the rewritten commit. Defaults to <b>true</b>. See also
           "<b>notes.rewriteRef</b>" below.

           This setting can be overridden with the <b>GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF</b> environment variable, which must be a
           colon separated list of refs or globs.

       notes.rewriteMode
           When copying notes during a rewrite (see the "notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;" option), determines what to do
           if the target commit already has a note. Must be one of <b>overwrite</b>, <b>concatenate</b>, <b>cat_sort_uniq</b>, or
           <b>ignore</b>. Defaults to <b>concatenate</b>.

           This setting can be overridden with the <b>GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_MODE</b> environment variable.

       notes.rewriteRef
           When copying notes during a rewrite, specifies the (fully qualified) ref whose notes should be
           copied. May be a glob, in which case notes in all matching refs will be copied. You may also specify
           this configuration several times.

           Does not have a default value; you must configure this variable to enable note rewriting. Set it to
           <b>refs/notes/commits</b> to enable rewriting for the default commit notes.

           Can be overridden with the <b>GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF</b> environment variable. See <b>notes.rewrite.</b><u>&lt;command&gt;</u>
           above for a further description of its format.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>GIT_NOTES_REF</b>
           Which ref to manipulate notes from, instead of <b>refs/notes/commits</b>. This overrides the <b>core.notesRef</b>
           setting.

       <b>GIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF</b>
           Colon-delimited list of refs or globs indicating which refs, in addition to the default from
           <b>core.notesRef</b> or <b>GIT_NOTES_REF</b>, to read notes from when showing commit messages. This overrides the
           <b>notes.displayRef</b> setting.

           A warning will be issued for refs that do not exist, but a glob that does not match any refs is
           silently ignored.

       <b>GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_MODE</b>
           When copying notes during a rewrite, what to do if the target commit already has a note. Must be one
           of <b>overwrite</b>, <b>concatenate</b>, <b>cat_sort_uniq</b>, or <b>ignore</b>. This overrides the <b>core.rewriteMode</b> setting.

       <b>GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF</b>
           When rewriting commits, which notes to copy from the original to the rewritten commit. Must be a
           colon-delimited list of refs or globs.

           If not set in the environment, the list of notes to copy depends on the <b>notes.rewrite.</b><u>&lt;command&gt;</u> and
           <b>notes.rewriteRef</b> settings.
