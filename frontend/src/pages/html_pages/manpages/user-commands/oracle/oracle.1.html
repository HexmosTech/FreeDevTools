</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       oracle - server for the SPHINX password manager

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       oracle [init]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  SPHINX protocol only makes sense if the server (called oracle) is somewhere else than where you type
       your password, pwdsphinx comes with a server implemented in python3 which you can host off-site from your
       usual desktop/smartphone.

       The server can be started simply by running oracle it does not take any parameters.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The server can be configured by any of the following files:

       • /etc/sphinx/config

       • <a href="file:~/.sphinxrc">~/.sphinxrc</a>

       • <a href="file:~/.config/sphinx/config">~/.config/sphinx/config</a>

       • ./sphinx.cfg

       Files are parsed  in  this  order,  this  means  global  settings  can  be  overridden  by  per-user  and
       per-directory settings.

       The server can be configured by changing the variables in the [server] section of the config file.

       The  address is the IP address on which the server is listening, default is localhost - you might want to
       change that.

       The port where the server is listening is by default 2355.  Another recommended values is to use port 433
       which is allowed by most firewalls while 2355 is not.

       ssl_key and ssl_cert must be specified, they point at a traditional TLS certificate and secret key  file.
       It  is  recommended to not use self-signed certs, but to use certs that signed by CAs that are recognized
       widely by browsers and other TLS clients.

       datadir specifies the data directory where all the device “secrets” are stored, this defaults to  “data/”
       in  the  current  directory.   You might want to back up this directory from time to time to an encrypted
       medium.

       verbose enables logging to standard output.

       timeout sets the timeout for any connection the server keeps open.

       max_kids sets the number maximum requests handled in parallel.  The timeout config  variable  makes  sure
       that all handlers are recycled in predictable time.

       rl_decay specifies the number of seconds after which a ratelimit level decays to an easier difficulty.

       rl_threshold increase the difficulty of ratelimit puzzles if not decaying.

       rl_gracetime gracetime in seconds added to the expected time to solve a rate-limiting puzzle.

       ltsigkey  a  path pointing at a long-term signature private key.  This can be generated by running oracle
       init.

</pre><h4><b>Initializing</b> <b>an</b> <b>oracle</b></h4><pre>
       Given a configuration, the oracle can generate its own long-term signature key.  To  do  so,  simply  run
       oracle  init  and  it  will  store  the private key at the location pointed by the ltsigkey configuration
       value.  This operation will also output the public key, at the same location as the private key, but with
       a .pub extension.  Furthermore the public key is also  displayed  as  a  Base64  encoded  string  on  the
       standard output.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b> <b>CONSIDERATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  configuration  values  max_kids  and  timeout  can  be  used to tune how many requests are served in
       parallel and how long each request is allowed to take before it gets killed.  An attacker might  be  able
       to run a denial-of-service attack against your server, by keeping all max_kids connections “occupied”.

       Since  the  server  does  only  know about failed authorizations for management operations, but not about
       correctness of master passwords for get requests, there is no way to mitigate master password  bruteforce
       attempts aside from ratelimiting.  By tuning the configuration variables starting with rl_ it is possible
       to  configure this.  If you have clients that have less than 1G RAM, it might be possible to increase the
       difficulty to the maximum level where those devices will not be able to solve  the  ratelimting  puzzles.
       Rate-limiting  in general should not be noticeable, only if dozens of get requests are served to the same
       record.  At the highest level the solution should take about 20-40 seconds (depending on your cpu).
