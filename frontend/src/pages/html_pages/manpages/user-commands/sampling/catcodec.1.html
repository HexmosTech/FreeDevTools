</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       catcodec — An open source tool to decode/encode the sample catalogue for OpenTTD

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>catcodec</b> [<b>-d</b> <u>sample_file</u>] [<b>-e</b> <u>sample_file</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       catcodec  decodes  and  encodes  sample catalogues for OpenTTD. These sample catalogues are not much more
       than some meta-data (description and file name) and raw PCM data.

       Decoding a sample catalogue, e.g. sample.cat, results in a sample.sfo that contains the  file  names  and
       descriptions of the samples and all samples with the file name as specified in the catalogue.

       Encoding  a  sample  catalogue, e.g. sample.cat, reads sample.sfo for the file names and descriptions. It
       will then load the samples described in sample.sfo and encodes these into sample.cat.

       Generally speaking encoding a file and then decoding it  results  in  the  same  file.  Decoding  of  the
       original,  Transport  Tycoon  Deluxe,  sample  format  will  force the output to be 11025 Hz, 8 bits mono
       because the meta-data of some of the samples is incorrect or even missing.

       Only PCM WAVE files with only the format and data chunks are supported. Any  other  formats  need  to  be
       converted into this. Furthermore only 11025 Hz, 22050 Hz and 44100 Hz with 8 or 16 bits per sample single
       channel PCM WAVE files are supported.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b> <u>sample_file</u>  Decode  the  given  sample  catalogue  into its components. The <u>sample_file</u> must have the
                       extension '.cat'. For the output meta-data file the '.cat' is replaced with  '.sfo'.  The
                       actual  samples,  in  PCM  WAVE  format,  are  extracted into files using the file names,
                       including extension, as described in the catalogue or meta-data file.

                       If any of the files already exists a backup is made, by adding  '.bak',  overwriting  the
                       existing backup.

       <b>-e</b> <u>sample_file</u>  Encode  the components for the given sample file into a sample catalogue. The <u>sample_file</u>
                       must have the extension '.cat'. For the input meta-data file the '.cat' is replaced  with
                       '.sfo'. The actual samples, in PCM WAVE format, are read from files using the file names,
                       including extension, as described in the meta-data file.

                       If  the  <u>sample_file</u>  already  exists a backup is made, by adding '.bak', overwriting the
                       existing backup.
