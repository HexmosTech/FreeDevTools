</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>icedax</b> stands for InCrEdible Digital Audio eXtractor. It can retrieve  audio  tracks  (<b>CDDA</b>)  from  CDROM
       drives that are capable of reading audio data digitally to the host (see README for a list of drives).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dev=</b><u>device</u>

       <b>-D</b> <u>device</u>

       <b>-device</b> <u>device</u>
              uses  <b>device</b>  as  the  source  for CDDA reading. For example <b>/dev/cdrom</b> or <b>Bus,ID,Lun.</b>  The device
              specification can also have influence on the selection of the driver  interface  (eg.  on  Linux).
              See the <b>-I</b> option for details.

              The setting of the environment variable <b>CDDA_DEVICE</b> is overridden by this option.

       <b>-A</b> <u>auxdevice</u>

       <b>-auxdevice</b> <u>auxdevice</u>
              uses <b>auxdevice</b> as CDROM drive for ioctl usage.

       <b>-I</b> <u>interface</u>

       <b>-interface</b> <u>interface</u>
              specifies  the  interface  for  CDROM  access:  <b>generic_scsi</b>  or  (on  Linux, and FreeBSD systems)
              <b>cooked_ioctl</b>.

              Using the <b>cooked_ioctl</b> is not recommended  as  this  makes  <b>icedax</b>  mainly  depend  on  the  audio
              extraction quality of the operating system which is usually extremely bad.

       <b>-c</b> <u>channels</u>  <u>--channels</u>
              uses <b>1</b> for mono, or <b>2</b> for stereo recording, or <b>s</b> for stereo recording with both channels swapped.

       <b>-s</b>  <b>--stereo</b>
              sets to stereo recording.

       <b>-m</b>  <b>--mono</b>
              sets to mono recording.

       <b>-x</b>  <b>--max</b>
              sets maximum (CD) quality.

       <b>-b</b> <u>bits</u>  <u>--bits-per-sample</u>
              sets bits per sample per channel: <b>8</b>, <b>12</b> or <b>16</b>.

       <b>-r</b> <u>rate</u>  <u>--rate</u>
              sets rate in samples per second.  Possible values are listed with the <b>-R</b> option.

       <b>-a</b> <u>divider</u>  <u>--divider</u>
              sets rate to 44100Hz / divider.  Possible values are listed with the <b>-R</b> option.

       <b>-R</b>  <b>--dump-rates</b>
              shows a list of all sample rates and their dividers.

       <b>-P</b>  <b>sectors</b>  <b>--set-overlap</b>
              sets the initial number of overlap <u>sectors</u> for jitter correction.

       <b>-n</b> <u>sectors</u>  <u>--sectors-per-request</u>
              reads <u>sectors</u> per request.

       <b>-l</b> <u>buffers</u>  <u>--buffers-in-ring</u>
              uses a ring buffer with <u>buffers</u> total.

       <b>-t</b> <u>track+endtrack</u>  <u>--track</u>
              selects the start track and optionally the end track.

       <b>-i</b> <u>index</u>  <u>--index</u>
              selects the start index.

       <b>-o</b> <u>offset</u>  <u>--offset</u>
              starts <u>offset</u> sectors behind start track (one sector equivalents 1/75 seconds).

       <b>-O</b>  <b>audiotype</b>  <b>--output-format</b>
              can  be  <u>wav</u> (for wav files) or <u>aiff</u> (for apple/sgi aiff files) or <u>aifc</u> (for apple/sgi aifc files)
              or <u>au</u> or <u>sun</u> (for sun .au PCM files) or <u>cdr</u> or <u>raw</u>  (for  headerless  files  to  be  used  for  cd
              writers).

       <b>-C</b> <u>endianess</u>  <u>--cdrom-endianess</u>
              sets endianess of the input samples to 'little', 'big' or 'guess' to override defaults.

       <b>-E</b> <u>endianess</u>  <u>--output-endianess</u>
              sets endianess of the output samples to 'little' or 'big' to override defaults.

       <b>-d</b> <u>duration</u>  <u>--duration</u>
              sets  recording  time  in seconds or frames.  Frames (sectors) are indicated by a 'f' suffix (like

        <b>cddbp-server=servername</b>
              sets the server to be contacted for title lookups.

        <b>cddbp-port=portnumber</b>
              sets the port number to be used for title lookups.

       <b>-H</b>  <b>--no-infofile</b>
              does not write an info file and a cddb file.

       <b>-g</b>  <b>--gui</b>
              formats the output to be better parsable by gui frontends.

       <b>-M</b>  <b>count</b> <b>--md5</b>
              enables calculation of MD-5 checksum for 'count' bytes from a beginning of a track.

       <b>-S</b>  <b>speed</b> <b>--speed</b>
              sets the cdrom device to one of the selectable speeds for reading.

       <b>-q</b>  <b>--quiet</b>
              quiet operation, no screen output.

       <b>-V</b>  <b>--verbose-SCSI</b>
              enable SCSI command logging to the console. This is mainly used for debugging.

       <b>-Q</b>  <b>--silent-SCSI</b>
              suppress SCSI command error reports to the console. This is mainly used for guis.

       <b>-scanbus</b>
              Scan all SCSI devices on all SCSI busses and print the inquiry strings. This option may be used to
              find SCSI address of the CD/DVD-Recorder on a system.  The  numbers  printed  out  as  labels  are
              computed by: <b>bus</b> <b>*</b> <b>100</b> <b>+</b> <b>target</b>

       <b>--devices</b>
              Like  -scanbus  but  works  in  a more native way, respecting the device name specification on the
              current operating system. See <b><a href="../man1/wodim.1.html">wodim</a>(1)</b> for details.

       <b>-paranoia</b>
              use the paranoia library instead of icedax's routines for reading.

       <b>-h</b>  <b>--help</b>
              display version of icedax on standard output.

       Defaults depend on the
              <b>Makefile</b> and <b>environment</b> <b>variable</b> settings (currently <b>CDDA_DEVICE</b> ).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>CDDA_DEVICE</b> is used to set the device name. The device naming is compatible with  the  one  used  by  the
       wodim tool.

       <b>CDDBP_SERVER</b>
              is used for cddbp title lookups when supplied.

       <b>CDDBP_PORT</b>
              is used for cddbp title lookups when supplied.

       <b>RSH</b>    If  the <b>RSH</b> environment variable is present, the remote connection will not be created via <b><a href="../man3/rcmd.3.html">rcmd</a></b>(3)
              but by calling the program pointed to by <b>RSH</b>.  Use e.g.  <b>RSH=</b><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?ssh">/usr/bin/ssh</a> to create a secure shell
              connection.

              Note that this forces <b>icedax</b> to create a pipe to  the  <b><a href="../man1/rsh.1.html">rsh</a>(1)</b>  program  and  disallows  <b>icedax</b>  to
              directly  access  the  network  socket  to  the remote server.  This makes it impossible to set up
              performance parameters and slows  down  the  connection  compared  to  a  <b>root</b>  initiated  <b><a href="../man3/rcmd.3.html">rcmd</a>(3)</b>
              connection.

       <b>RSCSI</b>  If  the  <b>RSCSI</b>  environment  variable  is  present, the remote SCSI server will not be the program
              <b>/opt/schily/sbin/rscsi</b> but the program pointed to by <b>RSCSI</b>.  Note  that  the  remote  SCSI  server
              program  name  will  be ignored if you log in using an account that has been created with a remote
              SCSI server program as login shell.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>icedax</b> uses the following exit codes to indicate various degrees of success:

</pre><h4><b>DISCUSSION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>icedax</b> is able to read parts of an <b>audio</b>  CD  or  <b>multimedia</b>  CDROM  (containing  audio  parts)  directly
       digitally. These parts can be written to a file, a pipe, or to a sound device.

       <b>icedax</b> stands for <b>CDDA</b> to <b>WAV</b> (where <b>CDDA</b> stands for compact disc digital audio and <b>WAV</b> is a sound sample
       format  introduced by MS Windows).  It allows copying <b>CDDA</b> audio data from the CDROM drive into a file in
       <b>WAV</b> or other formats.

       The latest versions try to get higher real-time scheduling priorities to  ensure  smooth  (uninterrupted)
       operation.  These  priorities  are  available  for  super  users  and  are  higher than those of 'normal'
       processes. Thus delays are minimized.

       If your CDROM is on device <b>DEV</b> and it is loaded with an audio CD, you may simply  invoke  <b>icedax</b>  <b>dev=DEV</b>
       and it will create the sound file <b>audio.wav</b> recording the whole track beginning with track 1 in stereo at
       16 bit at 44100 Hz sample rate, if your file system has enough space free.  Otherwise recording time will
       be limited. For details see files <b>README</b> and <b>README.INSTALL</b>

</pre><h4><b>HINTS</b> <b>ON</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Options
              Most  of  the options are used to control the format of the WAV file. In the following text all of
              them are described.

       Select Device
              <b>-D</b> <u>device</u> selects the CDROM drive device to be used.  The specifier given should correspond to the
              selected interface (see below).  <b>CHANGE!</b>  For the cooked_ioctl interface this is the cdrom  device
              descriptor  as  before.   <b>The</b>  <b>SCSI</b>  <b>devices</b>  <b>used</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>generic</b> <b>SCSI</b> <b>interface</b> <b>however</b> <b>are</b> <b>now</b>
              <b>addressed</b> <b>with</b>  <b>their</b>  <b>SCSI-Bus,</b>  <b>SCSI-Id,</b>  <b>and</b>  <b>SCSI-Lun</b>  <b>instead</b>  <b>of</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>generic</b>  <b>SCSI</b>  <b>device</b>
              <b>descriptor!!!</b>  One example for a SCSI CDROM drive on bus 0 with SCSI ID 3 and lun 0 is -D0,3,0.

       Select Auxiliary device
              <b>-A</b> <u>auxdevice</u> is necessary for CD-Extra handling. For Non-SCSI-CDROM drives this is the same device
              as  given  by  -D  (see  above).  For  SCSI-CDROM drives it is the CDROM drive (SCSI) device (i.e.
              <b>/dev/sr0</b> ) corresponding to the SCSI device (i.e.  <b>0,3,0</b> ). It has to match the  device  used  for
              sampling.

       Select Interface
              <b>-I</b> <u>interface</u> selects the CDROM drive interface. For SCSI drives use generic_scsi (cooked_ioctl may
              not  yet be available for all devices): <b>generic_scsi</b> and <b>cooked_ioctl</b>.  The first uses the generic
              SCSI interface, the latter uses the ioctl of the CDROM driver. The latter variant works only  when
              the  kernel  driver  supports <b>CDDA</b> reading. This entry has to match the selected CDROM device (see
              above).

       Enable echo to soundcard
              <b>-e</b> copies audio data to the sound card while recording, so you hear it nearly simultaneously.  The
              soundcard gets the same data that is recorded. This is time critical, so it works best with the <b>-q</b>
              option.   To  use <b>icedax</b> as a pseudo CD player without recording in a file you could use <b>icedax</b> <b>-q</b>
              <b>-e</b> <b>-t2</b> <b>-d0</b> <b>-N</b> to play the whole second track. This feature reduces the recording speed to at  most
              onefold  speed.  You  cannot  make better recordings than your sound card can play (since the same
              data is used).

       Change pitch of echoed audio
              <b>-p</b> <b>percentage</b> changes the pitch of all audio echoed  to  a  sound  card.  Only  the  copy  to  the
              soundcard  is affected, the recorded audio samples in a file remain the same.  Normal pitch, which
              is the default, is given by 100%.  Lower percentages correspond to  lower  pitches,  i.e.   -p  50
              transposes  the  audio output one octave lower.  See also the script <b>pitchplay</b> as an example. This
              option was contributed by Raul Sobon.

       Select mono or stereo recording
              <b>-m</b> or <b>-c</b> <b>1</b> selects mono recording (both stereo channels are mixed), <b>-s</b> or <b>-c</b> <b>2</b>  or  <b>-c</b>  <b>s</b>  selects
              stereo recording. Parameter s will swap both sound channels.

       Select maximum quality
              <b>-x</b>  will  set  stereo,  16  bits per sample at 44.1 KHz (full CD quality).  Note that other format
              options given later can change this setting.

       Select sample quality
              <b>-b</b> <b>8</b> specifies 8 bit (1 Byte) for each sample in each channel; <b>-b</b> <b>12</b> specifies 12 bit (2 Byte) for
              each sample in each channel; <b>-b</b> <b>16</b> specifies 16 bit (2 Byte)  for  each  sample  in  each  channel
              (Ensure  that  your  sample  player or sound card is capable of playing 12-bit or 16-bit samples).
              Selecting 12 or 16 bits doubles file size.  12-bit samples are aligned to 16-bit samples, so  they
              waste some disk space.

       Select sample rate
              <b>-r</b>  <u>samplerate</u>  selects a sample rate.  <u>samplerate</u> can be in a range between 44100 and 900. Option
              <b>-R</b> lists all available rates.

       Select sample rate divider
              <b>-a</b> <u>divider</u> selects a sample rate divider.  <u>divider</u> can be  minimally  1  and  maximally  50.5  and
              everything between in steps of 0.5.  Option <b>-R</b> lists all available rates.

              To  make  the  sound  smoother at lower sampling rates, <b>icedax</b> sums over <u>n</u> samples (where <u>n</u> is the
              specific dividend). So for 22050 Hertz output we have to sum over 2 samples, for 900 Hertz we have
              to sum over 49 samples.  This cancels higher frequencies. Standard sector  size  of  an  audio  CD
              (ignoring  additional  information) is 2352 Bytes. In order to finish summing for an output sample
              at sector boundaries the rates above have to be chosen.  Arbitrary sampling rates in high  quality
              would require some interpolation scheme, which needs much more sophisticated programming.

       List a table of all sampling rates
              <b>-R</b> shows a list of all sample rates and their dividers. Dividers can range from 1 to 50.5 in steps
              of 0.5.

       Select start track and optionally end track
              <b>-t</b>  <u>n+m</u> selects <b>n</b> as the start track and optionally <b>m</b> as the last track of a range to be recorded.
              These tracks must be from the table of contents.  This sets  the  track  where  recording  begins.
              Recording  can  advance through the following tracks as well (limited by the optional end track or
              otherwise depending on recording time). Whether one file  or  different  files  are  then  created
              depends on the <b>-B</b> option (see below).

       Select start index
              <b>-i</b>  <u>n</u>  selects  the  index  to  start  recording with.  Indices other than 1 will invoke the index
              scanner, which will take some time to find the correct start position.  An  offset  may  be  given
              additionally (see below).

       Set recording time
              <b>-d</b>   <b>n</b>  sets  recording  time  to <u>n</u> seconds or set recording time for whole track if <u>n</u> is zero. In
              order to specify the duration in frames (sectors) also, the argument can  have  an  appended  'f'.
              Then  the  numerical argument is to be taken as frames (sectors) rather than seconds.  Please note
              that if track ranges are being used they define the recording time as well thus overriding any  <b>-d</b>
              option specified times.

              Recording time is defined as the time the generated sample will play (at the defined sample rate).
              Since  it's  related to the amount of generated samples, it's not the time of the sampling process
              itself (which can be less or more).  It's neither strictly coupled with the  time  information  on
              the  audio CD (shown by your hifi CD player).  Differences can occur by the usage of the <b>-o</b> option
              (see below). Notice that recording time will  be  shortened,  unless  enough  disk  space  exists.
              Recording can be aborted at anytime by pressing the break character (signal SIGQUIT).
                 .IP  "Record  all  tracks of a complete audio CD in separate files" <b>-B</b> copies each track into a
              separate file. A base name can be given. File names have an appended track number and an extension
              corresponding to the audio format. To record all audio tracks of  a  CD,  use  a  sufficient  high
              duration (i.e. -d99999).

       Set start sector offset
              <b>-o</b> <u>sectors</u> increments start sector of the track by <u>sectors</u>.  By this option you are able to skip a
              certain  amount at the beginning of a track so you can pick exactly the part you want. Each sector
              runs for 1/75 seconds, so you have very fine control. If your offset is so high that it would  not
              fit into the current track, a warning message is issued and the offset is ignored.  Recording time
              is not reduced.  (To skip introductory quiet passages automagically, use the <b>-w</b> option see below.)

       Wait for signal option
              <b>-w</b> Turning on this option will suppress all silent output at startup, reducing possibly file size.
              <b>icedax</b> will watch for any signal in the output signal and switches on writing to file.

       Find extreme samples
              <b>-F</b>  Turning on this option will display the most negative and the most positive sample value found
              during recording for both channels. This can be useful for  readjusting  the  volume.  The  values
              shown  are not reset at track boundaries, they cover the complete sampling process. They are taken
              from the original samples and have the same format (i.e. they  are  independent  of  the  selected
              output format).

       Find if input samples are in mono
              <b>-G</b>  If  this  option is given, input samples for both channels will be compared. At the end of the
              program the result is printed. Differences in the channels indicate stereo,  otherwise  when  both
              channels are equal it will indicate mono.

       Undo the pre-emphasis in the input samples
              <b>-T</b>  Some older audio CDs are recorded with a modified frequency response called pre-emphasis. This
              is found mostly in classical recordings. The correction can be seen in the flags of the  Table  Of
              Contents  often. But there are recordings, that show this setting only in the subchannels. If this
              option is given, the index scanner will be started, which reads the q-subchannel of each track. If
              pre-emphasis is indicated in the q-subchannel of a track, but not in the TOC, pre-emphasis will be
              assumed to be present, and subsequently a reverse filtering is done  for  this  track  before  the
              samples are written into the audio file.

       Set audio format
              <b>-O</b>   <b>audiotype</b>  can  be  <u>wav</u>  (for  wav files) or <u>au</u> or <u>sun</u> (for sun PCM files) or <u>cdr</u> or <u>raw</u> (for
              headerless files to be used for cd writers).  All file samples are  coded  in  linear  pulse  code
              modulation  (as  done  in  the  audio compact disc format). This holds for all audio formats.  Wav
              files are compatible to Wind*ws sound files, they have lsb,msb byte order as  being  used  on  the
              audio  cd. The default filename extension is '.wav'.  Sun type files are not like the older common
              logarithmically coded .au files, but instead as mentioned above linear PCM is used. The byte order
              is msb,lsb to be compatible. The default filename extension is '.au'.   The  AIFF  and  the  newer
              variant  AIFC  from the Apple/SGI world store their samples in bigendian format (msb,lsb). In AIFC
              no compression is used.  Finally the easiest 'format', the cdr aka raw  format.  It  is  done  per
              default  in  msb,lsb  byte order to satisfy the order wanted by most cd writers. Since there is no
              header information in this format, the sample parameters can only be  identified  by  playing  the
              samples on a soundcard or similar. The default filename extension is '.cdr' or '.raw'.

       Select cdrom drive reading speed
              <b>-S</b>   <b>speed</b>  allows  to  switch the cdrom drive to a certain level of speed in order to reduce read
              errors. The argument is transfered verbatim to the drive.  Details depend very much on  the  cdrom
              drives.   An argument of 0 for example is often the default speed of the drive, a value of 1 often
              selects single speed.

       Enable MD5 checksums
              <b>-M</b>  <b>count</b> enables calculation of MD-5 checksum for 'count' bytes from the beginning  of  a  track.
              This was introduced for quick comparisons of tracks.

       Use Monty's libparanoia for reading of sectors
              <b>-paranoia</b>  selects  an alternate way of extracting audio sectors. Monty's library is used with the
              following default options:

              PARANOIA_MODE_FULL, but without PARANOIA_MODE_NEVERSKIP

              for details see Monty's libparanoia documentation.  In this case the option <b>-P</b> has no effect.

       Do linear or overlapping reading of sectors
              (This applies unless option <b>-paranoia</b> is used.)  <b>-P</b>  <b>sectors</b> sets the given number of sectors  for
              initial  overlap  sampling  for  jitter correction. Two cases are to be distinguished. For nonzero
              values, some sectors are read twice to enable icedax's jitter correction.  If an argument of  zero
              is  given,  no  overlap  sampling  will  be  used.  For nonzero overlap sectors icedax dynamically
              adjusts the setting during sampling (like cdparanoia does).  If no  match  can  be  found,  icedax
              retries  the  read  with  an increased overlap.  If the amount of jitter is lower than the current
              overlapped samples, icedax reduces the overlap setting, resulting in a higher reading speed.   The
              argument given has to be lower than the total number of sectors per request (see option <u>-n</u> below).
              Icedax  will check this setting and issues a error message otherwise.  The case of zero sectors is
              nice on low load situations or errorfree (perfect) cdrom drives and perfect (not scratched)  audio
              cds.

       Set the transfer size
              <b>-n</b>  <b>sectors</b> will set the transfer size to the specified sectors per request.

       Set number of ring buffer elements
              <b>-l</b>  <b>buffers</b> will allocate the specified number of ring buffer elements.

       Set endianess of input samples
              <b>-C</b>   <b>endianess</b>  will  override  the  default  settings  of the input format.  Endianess can be set
              explicitly to "little" or "big" or to the automatic  endianess  detection  based  on  voting  with
              "guess".

       Set endianess of output samples
              <b>-E</b>   <b>endianess</b>  (endianess  can  be  "little"  or "big") will override the default settings of the
              output format.

       Verbose option
              <b>-v</b>  <b>itemlist</b> prints more information. A list allows selection of different information items.

              <b>disable</b> keeps quiet

              <b>toc</b> displays the table of contents

              <b>summary</b> displays a summary of recording parameters

              <b>indices</b> invokes the index scanner and displays start positions of indices

              <b>catalog</b> retrieves and displays a media catalog number

              <b>trackid</b> retrieves and displays international standard recording codes

              <b>sectors</b> displays track start positions in absolute sector notation

              To combine several requests just list the suboptions separated with commas.

       The table of contents
              The display will show the table of contents with number of tracks and  total  time  (displayed  in
              <u>mm</u>:<u>ss</u>.<u>hh</u>  format,  <u>mm</u>=minutes, <u>ss</u>=seconds, <u>hh</u>=rounded 1/100 seconds).  The following list displays
              track number and track time for each entry.  The summary gives a line  per  track  describing  the
              type of the track.

                                       <b>track</b> <b>preemphasis</b> <b>copypermitted</b> <b>tracktype</b> <b>chans</b>

              The  <b>track</b>  column  holds  the track number.  <b>preemphasis</b> shows if that track has been given a non
              linear frequency response.  NOTE: You can undo this effect with  the  <b>-T</b>  option.   <b>copy-permitted</b>
              indicates  if  this  track  is allowed to copy.  <b>tracktype</b> can be data or audio. On multimedia CDs
              (except hidden track CDs) both of them should be present.  <b>channels</b> is defined  for  audio  tracks
              only. There can be two or four channels.

       No file output
              <b>-N</b> this debugging option switches off writing to a file.

       No infofile generation
              <b>-H</b> this option switches off creation of an info file and a cddb file.

       Generation of simple output for gui frontends
              <b>-g</b>  this option switches on simple line formatting, which is needed to support gui frontends (like
              xcd-roast).

       Verbose SCSI logging
              <b>-V</b> this option switches on logging of SCSI commands. This will produce a lot of output (when  SCSI
              devices  are  being used).  This is needed for debugging purposes. The format is the same as being
              used with the cdrecord program from Joerg Schilling or the wodim tool. See there for details.

       Quiet option
              <b>-q</b> suppresses all screen output except error messages.  That reduces cpu time resources.

       Just show information option
              <b>-J</b> does not write a file, it only prints information about the disc (depending on the <b>-v</b>  option).
              This is just for information purposes.

</pre><h4><b>CDDBP</b> <b>support</b></h4><pre>
       Lookup album and track titles option
              <b>-L</b>   <b>cddbp</b>  <b>mode</b> Icedax tries to retrieve performer, album-, and track titles from a cddbp server.
              The default server right now is 'freedb.freedb.org'.  It is planned to have more control over  the
              server handling later.  The parameter defines how multiple entries are handled:

       0    interactive mode, the user chooses one of the entries.

       1    take the first entry without asking.

       Set server for title lookups
              <b>cddbp-server</b>   <b>servername</b> When using -L or --cddb, the server being contacted can be set with this
              option.

       Set portnumber for title lookups
              <b>cddbp-port</b>  <b>portnumber</b> When using -L or --cddb, the server port being contacted can  be  set  with
              this option.

</pre><h4><b>HINTS</b> <b>ON</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Don't  create samples you cannot read. First check your sample player software and sound card hardware. I
       experienced problems with very low sample rates (stereo &lt;= 1575 Hz, mono &lt;= 3675 Hz) when trying to  play
       them  with  standard  WAV  players  for  sound blaster (maybe they are not legal in <b>WAV</b> format). Most CD-
       Writers insist on audio samples in a bigendian format.  Now icedax supports the <b>-E</b>  <b>endianess</b>  option  to
       control the endianess of the written samples.

       If  your  hardware  is  fast enough to run icedax uninterrupted and your CD drive is one of the 'perfect'
       ones, you will gain speed when switching all overlap sampling off with the <b>-P</b>   <b>0</b>  option.  Further  fine
       tuning  can  be done with the <b>-n</b>  <b>sectors</b> option. You can specify how much sectors should be requested in
       one go.

       Icedax supports <b>pipes</b> now. Use a filename of <b>-</b> to let icedax output its samples to standard output.

       Conversion to other sound formats can be done using the <b>sox</b> program package (although the use of  <b>sox</b>  <b>-x</b>
       to  change  the  byte  order  of  samples should be no more necessary; see option <b>-E</b> to change the output
       byteorder).

       If you want to sample more than one track into different files in one run,  this  is  currently  possible
       with  the  <b>-B</b>  option. When recording time exceeds the track limit a new file will be opened for the next
       track.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Icedax can generate a lot of files for various purposes.

       Audio files:

       There are audio files containing samples with default extensions  These  files  are  not  generated  when
       option  (-N)  is  given. Multiple files may be written when the bulk copy option (-B) is used. Individual
       file names can be given as arguments. If the number of file  names  given  is  sufficient  to  cover  all
       included  audio  tracks,  the  file names will be used verbatim.  Otherwise, if there are less file names
       than files needed to write the included tracks, the part  of  the  file  name  before  the  extension  is
       extended with '_dd' where dd represents the current track number.

       Cddb and Cdindex files:

       If  icedax detects cd-extra or cd-text (album/track) title information, then .cddb and .cdindex files are
       generated unless suppressed by the option -H. They contain suitable formatted entries for  submission  to
       audio cd track title databases in the internet. The CDINDEX and CDDB(tm) systems are currently supported.
       For more information please visit www.musicbrainz.org and www.freedb.com.

       Inf files:

       The inf files are describing the sample files and the part from the audio cd, it was taken from. They are
       a means to transfer information to a cd burning program like wodim. For example, if the original audio cd
       had  pre-emphasis  enabled, and icedax -T did remove the pre-emphasis, then the inf file has pre-emphasis
       not set (since the audio file does not have it anymore), while the  .cddb  and  the  .cdindex  have  pre-
       emphasis set as the original does.

       <b>IMPORTANT:</b>  it is prohibited to sell copies of copyrighted material by noncopyright holders. This program
       may not be used to circumvent copyrights.  The user acknowledges this constraint when using the software.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Generation of md5 checksums is currently broken.

       Performance may not be optimal on slower systems.

       The index scanner may give timeouts.

       The resampling (rate conversion code) uses polynomial interpolation, which is not optimal.

       Icedax should use threads.

       Icedax currently cannot sample hidden audio tracks (track 1 index 0).

       disk drives and cd burners which helped a lot to develop this software.  Rammi has helped a lot with  the
       debugging  and  showed a lot of stamina when hearing 100 times the first 16 seconds of the first track of
       the Krupps CD.  Libparanoia contributed by Monty (Christopher Montgomery) <a href="mailto:xiphmont@mit.edu">xiphmont@mit.edu</a>.

       This manpage describes the program implementation of <b>icedax</b> as shipped by the  cdrkit  distribution.  See
       <b><a href="http://alioth.debian.org/projects/debburn/">http://alioth.debian.org/projects/debburn/</a></b>  for  details.  It  is  a  spinoff  from  the original program
       cdda2wav as distributed in the cdrtools package [1]. However, the cdrtools developers are not involved in
       the development of this spinoff and therefore shall not be made responsible for any problem caused by it.
       Do not try to get support for this program by contacting the original authors.

       If you have support questions, send them to

       <b><a href="mailto:debburn-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org">debburn-devel@lists.alioth.debian.org</a></b>
