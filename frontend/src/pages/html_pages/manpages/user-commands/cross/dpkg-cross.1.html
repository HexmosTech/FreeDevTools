        { [ -a | --arch ] architecture } { [ -X | --exclude ] PACKAGE }

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       dpkg-cross is a tool to install and manage libraries and header files for cross compiling. dpkg-cross
       converts native Debian packages for the target architecture to cross compiling support packages that can
       be installed on any architecture, but in different paths to avoid conflicts. It then calls dpkg to
       install the converted package. The conversion step alone can be done with the --build option. Other
       options are wrappers around corresponding dpkg functionality.

       dpkg-cross is intended to make it easier for you to keep your cross compiling libraries up-to-date, as it
       works directly on Debian packages. It saves you copying the libs and headers from a machine with your
       target  architecture, or extracting them via dpkg-deb --fsys-tarfile.

       dpkg-cross also collects and install the .shlibs files in -dev packages, which are needed by dpkg-
       shlibdeps.

</pre><h4><b>CMAKE</b></h4><pre>
       CMake cross-building support is experimental!

       CMake requires a little support from dpkg-cross to cross-build. The included cmake support file is an
       example for Linux kernels.  Use:

        rm CMakeCache.txt
        cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/etc/dpkg-cross/cmake/CMakeCross.txt

       The  main changes involve setting PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR within CMake an setting the include directories to
       locate the cross libraries installed by dpkg-cross e.g.

        #Make pkg-config look in the right place
        SET(ENV{PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR} ${CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH}/lib/pkgconfig/)
        ELSE (CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING)

       Packages using cmake may need some tweaks to debian/rules, e.g.

        ifneq ($(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE),$(DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE))
        export CC=$(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE)-gcc
        export CXX=$(DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE)-g++
        export CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/etc/dpkg-cross/cmake/CMakeCross.txt
        else
        export CC=gcc
        export CXX=g++
        endif

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       dpkg-cross follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes ('-').

        -h|--help

       Show summary of options.

        -v|--verbose

       Be more verbose.

        -q|--quiet

       Be more quiet.

        -a|--arch architecture

       Install for architecture architecture.

        -i|--install

       Install Debian packages (.deb) named on the command line. Only files in the directories <a href="file:/lib">/lib</a>, <a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a>
       and <a href="file:/usr/include">/usr/include</a> are extracted, since only they can be relevant for cross compiling. In the lib
       directories, also no subdirectories are extracted.

        -A|--convert-anyway

       Convert Debian package even if it does not provide any files useful for cross-compile environment.

        -M|--convert-multiarch

       Convert package even if it is a multiarch package. If the package is not a multiarch package, processing
       continues as normal.

        -X|--exclude PACKAGE

       Removes the specified package from the dependencies of the current package. Typically used to drop
       dependencies on packages that are not required within a cross-build environment, e.g. packages containing
       only executables or architecture independent files.

       dpkg-cross can only check the current package and information about a dependency is not available (for
       that, use xapt). By default, dpkg-cross converts all dependencies to specify the cross version of the
       dependency package.

       If you know that a particular dependency should not be converted (it provides no useful files or is
       architecture  independent), that dependency can be excluded and dpkg-cross will remove that package from
       the dependency information of the cross package. -X has replaced the use of keepdeps and removedeps in
       /etc/dpkg-cross/cross-compile.

       -X|--exclude PACKAGE needs to be repeated for each package to be excluded.

        -k|--keep-temp

       Keep the built and installed package instead of deleting it.  Requires --install.

        -b|--build

       Just build the converted Debian package, but do not install it with dpkg.

        -r|--remove

       Remove the cross compiling packages named on the command line.

        -s|--status

       Print status of the named packages.

        -l|--list

       Print short version of status of named packages or package name patterns.

        -L|--list-files

       List files belonging to the named packages.

        -u|--update

       Update current cross-installation with Debian packages found in/under the paths given as arguments. Will
       check all packages there if they are installed already as cross-compiling packages and if they are really
       updates. Those packages will be installed as with -i.

        -Q|--query

       Much like --update, but just prints available update packages and does not install them.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/dpkg-cross/cross-compile defines the default_arch for dpkg-cross:

       The default architecture for dpkg-cross is normally set by debconf.  To change the system-wide value,
       use:

        $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure dpkg-cross

       Alternatively, the default can be overridden on a per-user basis using the optional file in
       $HOME/.dpkg-cross/

</pre><h4><b>Conversion</b> <b>process</b></h4><pre>
       There is no safe way for dpkg-cross to mangle certain files in -dev packages, particularly files in
       <u><a href="file:/usr/share">/usr/share</a></u> or to determine precisely which of these files could be parsed and which cannot. Special cases
       do not help - dpkg-cross already has too many of those.

       It is not safe to leave files in the package nor is it safe to move files into arbitrary locations when
       there is no reliable and standardised way to determine the usefulness of a particular kind of file.
       Package specific config scripts cannot be supported and even build-system specific ones are not
       necessarily going to work without a lot of ongoing maintenance.

       Therefore, "dpkg-cross" is very restrictive on which files are retained in the -cross package.

   <b>Files</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>converted</b>
       All files in

        <a href="file:/usr/include/">/usr/include/</a>*

       Also <a href="file:/usr/src">/usr/src</a> and <a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a> are searched for includes - files with .h, .hh, .hpp extensions (case
       insensitive).

       Library files - *.so* and *.a and *.o files from <a href="file:/lib">/lib</a> and <a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a> (and all the multilib eqivalents
       (lib64, lib32, libo32, libhf, libx32 etc).  Other library files are not copied.  *.la files in library
       directories are also copied, and library and paths are modified there. Same for /usr/lib/pkgconfig/*.pc
       files.

       Symlinks are copied (and modified appropriately) if their destination is copied. Also, symlinks to non-
       existing shared libraries are copied (this is common case for libdevel packages)

       Directories are created only to hold some files or symlinks.  No empty directories are copied.

</pre><h4><b>Multiarch</b> <b>behaviour</b></h4><pre>
       By default &lt;dpkg-cross&gt; does nothing with packages from Debian which already support Multi-Arch - the
       package is simply copied to the current work directory, if it does not already exist. Any package
       containing a Multi-Arch: field in DEBIAN/control is skipped in this manner.

       --convert-multiarch can be specified to instead force the generation of a -&lt;arch&gt;-cross package with the
       files moved into the conventional dpkg-cross locations.

       The Multiarch spec ensures that multiarch packages will only be available from Debian mirrors once dpkg
       itself is capable of installing the packages and installing a Multiarch package means being able to
       install a 32bit multiarch package alongside a 64bit multiarch package.  Installing an armel multiarch
       package alongside an x86 multiarch package is no different to 32bit vs 64bit. (What changes is how the
       multiarch package itself handles the header files and pkg-config files.)
