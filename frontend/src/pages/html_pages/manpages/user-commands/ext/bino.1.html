       • -f, --fullscreen

</pre><h4><b>Output</b> <b>modes</b></h4><pre>
       Most output modes should be self explanatory, but there are some exceptions:

       • stereo requires OpenGL quad-buffered stereo support, typically limited to high-end graphics cards.

       • alternating  tries to mimic stereo mode by displaying the left and right frames alternating, ideally at
         display speed.  This is unreliable since Bino has no way of making sure that its output frames actually
         correspond to display output frames, but it might work, depending on your hardware and system setup.

       • hdmi-frame-pack is a special mode supported by some 3D TVs via HDMI 1.4a, where the left view is placed
         in the top part of a frame and the right view in the bottom part, and both parts  are  separated  by  a
         blank  area  that  takes  1/49  of  the  vertical  space.   To use this mode, force your display output
         resolution into either 1280x1470  (720p  3D:  720+30+720=1470;  1470/49=30)  or  1920x2205  (1080p  3D:
         1080+45+1080=2205; 2205/49=45).

       • even-odd-rows, even-odd-columns and checkerboard are for (older) 3D TVs.

</pre><h4><b>File</b> <b>Name</b> <b>Conventions</b></h4><pre>
       Bino  currently cannot detect the stereoscopic layout or the surround video mode from metadata because Qt
       does not provide that information.  It therefore has to guess.

       Bino recognizes the following hints at the last part  of  the  file  name,  just  before  the  file  name
       extension (.ext):

       • *-tb.ext, *-ab.ext: Input mode top-bottom

       • *-tbh.ext, *-abq.ext: Input mode top-bottom-half

       • *-bt.ext, *-ba.ext: Input mode bottom-top

       • *-bth.ext, *-baq.ext: Input mode bottom-top-half

       • *-lr.ext: Input mode left-right

       • *-lrh.ext, *-lrq.ext: Input mode left-right-half

       • *-rl.ext: Input mode right-left

       • *-rlh.ext, *-rlq.ext: Input mode right-left-half

       • *-2d.ext: Input mode mono

       Additionally,  if  the  number 180 or 360 is part of the file name and separated by neighboring digits or
       letters by other characters, then the corresponding surround mode is assumed.

</pre><h4><b>Scripting</b></h4><pre>
       Bino can read commands from a script file and execute them via  the  option  --read-commands  <u>scriptfile</u>.
       This works both in GUI mode and in Virtual Reality mode.

       The  script  file can also be a named pipe so that you can have arbitrary remote control interfaces write
       commands into it as they come in.

       Empty lines and comment lines (which begin with #) are ignored.  The following commands are supported:

       • open [--input <u>mode</u>] [--surround <u>mode</u>] [--video-track <u>vt</u>] [--audio-track <u>at</u>] [--subtitle-track <u>st</u>] <u>URL</u>

         Open the URL and start playing.  The options have the same meaning as the  corresponding  command  line
         options.

       • capture [--audio-input <u>ai</u>] [--video-input <u>vi</u>] [--screen-input <u>si</u>] [--window-input <u>wi</u>]

         Start  capturing camera and microphone.  The options have the same meaning as the corresponding command
         line options.

       • play

         Start playing.

       • pause

         Pause.

       • toggle-pause

         Switch between pause and play.

       • stop

         Stop playing.

       • playlist-load <u>playlist.m3u</u>

         Load the playlist.

       • playlist-next

         Switch to next playlist entry.

       • playlist-prev

         Switch to previous playlist entry.

       • playlist-wait <u>mode</u>

         Set wait mode (off, on).

       • playlist-loop <u>mode</u>

         Set loop mode (off, one, all).

       • quit

         Quit Bino.

       • set-position <u>p</u>

         Set the video position to <u>p</u>, where <u>p</u>=0 is the beginning and <u>p</u>=1 is the end.

       • seek <u>seconds</u>

         Seek the given amounts of seconds forward or, if the number of seconds is negative, backwards.

       • wait stop|<u>seconds</u>

         Wait until the video stops, or wait for the given number of seconds, before executing the next command.

       • set-mute on|off

         Set the volume mute status.

       • toggle-mute

         Switch between mute and unmute.

       • set-volume <u>vol</u>

         Set the volume level to <u>vol</u> (between 0 and 1).

       • adjust-volume <u>offset</u>

         Adjust the volume by the given amount (the final volume is clamped between 0 and 1).

       • set-output-mode <u>mode</u>

         Set the given output mode.  See the command line option --output for a list of modes.

       • set-swap-eyes on|off

         Set left/right eye swap.

       • toggle-swap-eyes

         Toggle left/right eye swap.

       • set-fullscreen on|off

         Set fullscreen mode.

       • toggle-fullscreen

         Toggle fullscreen mode.

</pre><h4><b>Slideshows</b></h4><pre>
       You can play slideshows of images (or videos) simply by making a  playlist  and  switching  on  its  <u>wait</u>
       status.   This  is  the  default whenever one or more of the files you open are images instead of videos;
       this works from the command line as well as from the GUI.

       With <u>wait</u> enabled, the next media in the playlist will only be displayed after you press the  N  key,  or
       choose Playlist/Next from the menu.

       For  automatic  media  switching based on predefined presentation times, use the scripting mode as in the
       following example:

              set-fullscreen on
              playlist-load my-slideshow.m3u
              playlist-loop on
              playlist-wait on
              playlist-next
              wait 4
              playlist-next
              wait 7
              playlist-next
              wait 5
              quit

</pre><h4><b>Virtual</b> <b>Reality</b></h4><pre>
       Bino supports all sorts of Virtual Reality environments via QVR:

       • When QVR is compiled just  with  Qt6,  CAVEs  and  powerwalls  and  similar  multi-display  setups  are
         supported, including multi-GPU and multi-host rendering.

       • When  QVR  is  compiled  with VRPN, all sorts of tracking and interaction hardware for such systems are
         supported.

       • When QVR is compiled with OpenVR, SteamVR is supported and automatically detected (e.g. HTC Vive).

       To start Bino in VR mode, use the option --vr.  Bino will then display a screen in the virtual world, and
       the video will be displayed on that screen, unless the input is a surround video (360°  or  180°),  which
       will of course be displayed all around the viewer.

       The  default  is  a 16:9 screen in a few meters distance from the viewer, but you can use the --vr-screen
       option to either define arbitrary planar screens via  their  bottom  left,  bottom  right  and  top  left
       corners,  or  to  load arbitrary screen geometry from an OBJ file.  The latter case is useful e.g. if you
       want Bino’s virtual screen to coincide with a curved physical screen.

       The --vr-screen option also accepts the special values united  and  intersected.   This  will  unite  (or
       intersect)  the  2D  geometries  of  all  VR  windows  at  runtime.   For example, use --vr-screen=united
       --qvr-config=two-screen-stereo.qvr for a two-screen stereo setup, where the left view goes on  the  first
       screen and the right view goes on the second screen.

       Bino  uses  QVRs  default navigation, which may be based on autodetected controllers such as the HTC Vive
       controllers, or on tracking and interaction hardware configured via QVR for your VR  system,  or  on  the
       mouse and WASDQE keys if nothing else is available.

       Additional  interaction  in VR mode is currently limited to the same keyboard shortcuts that also work in
       GUI mode.  That means you currently must specify the video to play on the command line, and have  no  way
       to pause, skip or seek with VR controllers.  This will be added in a future version.

                                                  May 31, 2024                                           <u><a href="../man1/Bino.1.html">Bino</a></u>(1)
