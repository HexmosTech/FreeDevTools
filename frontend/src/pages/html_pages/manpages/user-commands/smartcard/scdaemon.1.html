</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scdaemon</b> - Smartcard daemon for the GnuPG system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scdaemon</b> [<b>--homedir</b> <u>dir</u>] [<b>--options</b> <u>file</u>] [<u>options</u>] <b>--server</b>
       <b>scdaemon</b> [<b>--homedir</b> <u>dir</u>] [<b>--options</b> <u>file</u>] [<u>options</u>] <b>--daemon</b> [<u>command_line</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>scdaemon</b>  is  a  daemon to manage smartcards.  It is usually invoked by <b>gpg-agent</b> and in general not
       used directly.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Commands are not distinguished from options except for the fact that only one command is allowed.

       <b>--version</b>
              Print the program version and  licensing  information.   Note  that  you  cannot  abbreviate  this
              command.

       <b>--help,</b> <b>-h</b>
              Print  a  usage  message  summarizing  the most useful command-line options.  Note that you cannot
              abbreviate this command.

       <b>--dump-options</b>
              Print a list of all available options and commands.  Note that you cannot abbreviate this command.

       <b>--server</b>
              Run in server mode and wait for commands on the <b>stdin</b>.  The default mode is to create a socket and
              listen for commands there.

       <b>--multi-server</b>
              Run in server mode and wait for commands on the <b>stdin</b> as well as  on  an  additional  Unix  Domain
              socket.  The server command <b>GETINFO</b> may be used to get the name of that extra socket.

       <b>--daemon</b>
              Run  the program in the background.  This option is required to prevent it from being accidentally
              running in the background.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--options</b> <u>file</u>
              Reads configuration from <u>file</u> instead of  from  the  default  per-user  configuration  file.   The
              default  configuration  file  is  named  ‘<u>scdaemon.conf</u>’  and  expected  in the ‘<u>.gnupg</u>’ directory
              directly below the home directory of the user.

       <b>--homedir</b> <u>dir</u>
              Set the name of the home directory to <u>dir</u>. If this option is not used, the home directory defaults
              to ‘<u><a href="file:~/.gnupg">~/.gnupg</a></u>’.  It is only recognized when given on the command line.  It also overrides any  home
              directory  stated through the environment variable ‘<u>GNUPGHOME</u>’ or (on Windows systems) by means of
              the Registry entry <u>HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir</u>.

              On Windows systems it is possible to install GnuPG as a portable application.  In this  case  only
              this command line option is considered, all other ways to set a home directory are ignored.

       <b>-v</b>

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Outputs  additional  information  while running.  You can increase the verbosity by giving several
              verbose commands to <b>gpgsm</b>, such as ‘-vv’.

       <b>--debug-level</b> <u>level</u>
              Select the debug level for investigating problems.  <u>level</u> may be a numeric value or a keyword:

              <b>none</b>   No debugging at all.  A value of less than 1 may be used instead of the keyword.

              <b>basic</b>  Some basic debug messages.  A value between 1 and 2 may be used instead of the keyword.

              <b>advanced</b>
                     More verbose debug messages.  A value between 3 and 5 may be used instead of the keyword.

              <b>expert</b> Even more detailed messages.  A value between 6 and 8 may be used instead of the keyword.

              <b>guru</b>   All of the debug messages you can get. A value greater than 8 may be used  instead  of  the
                     keyword.  The creation of hash tracing files is only enabled if the keyword is used.

       How  these  messages  are mapped to the actual debugging flags is not specified and may change with newer
       releases of this program. They are however carefully selected to best aid in debugging.

              <b>All</b> <b>debugging</b> <b>options</b> <b>are</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>and</b>  <b>thus</b>  <b>should</b>  <b>not</b>  <b>be</b>  <b>used</b>  <b>by</b>  <b>any</b>  <b>application</b>
              <b>program.</b>  <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>says,</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> <b>used</b> <b>as</b> <b>helpers</b> <b>to</b> <b>debug</b> <b>problems.</b>

       <b>--debug</b> <u>flags</u>
              Set  debug  flags.   All  flags are or-ed and <u>flags</u> may be given in C syntax (e.g. 0x0042) or as a
              comma separated list of flag names.  To get a list of all supported flags the single  word  "help"
              can  be  used.  This  option  is only useful for debugging and the behavior may change at any time
              without notice.

       <b>--debug-all</b>
              Same as <b>--debug=0xffffffff</b>

       <b>--debug-wait</b> <u>n</u>
              When running in server mode, wait <u>n</u> seconds before entering the actual processing loop  and  print
              the pid.  This gives time to attach a debugger.

       <b>--debug-ccid-driver</b>
              Enable  debug  output  from the included CCID driver for smartcards.  Using this option twice will
              also enable some tracing of the T=1 protocol.  Note that this option may reveal sensitive data.

       <b>--debug-disable-ticker</b>
              This option disables all ticker functions like checking for card insertions.

       <b>--debug-allow-core-dump</b>
              For security reasons we won't create a core dump when the process aborts.  For debugging  purposes
              it  is  sometimes  better to allow core dump.  This option enables it and also changes the working
              directory to ‘<u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>’ when running in <b>--server</b> mode.

       <b>--debug-log-tid</b>
              This option appends a thread ID to the PID in the log output.

       <b>--debug-assuan-log-cats</b> <u>cats</u>
              Changes the active Libassuan logging categories to <u>cats</u>.   The  value  for  <u>cats</u>  is  an  unsigned
              integer  given in usual C-Syntax.  A value of 0 switches to a default category.  If this option is
              not used the categories are taken from the environment  variable  <b>ASSUAN_DEBUG</b>.   Note  that  this
              option  has  only an effect if the Assuan debug flag has also been with the option <b>--debug</b>.  For a
              list of categories see the Libassuan manual.

       <b>--no-detach</b>
              Don't detach the process from the console.  This is mainly useful for debugging.

       <b>--listen-backlog</b> <u>n</u>
              Set the size of the queue for pending connections.  The default is 64.  This option has an  effect
              only if <b>--multi-server</b> is also used.

       <b>--log-file</b> <u>file</u>
              Append  all  logging output to <u>file</u>.  This is very helpful in seeing what the agent actually does.
              Use ‘<u>socket://</u>’ to log to socket.

       <b>--pcsc-shared</b>
              Use shared mode to access the card via  PC/SC.   This  is  a  somewhat  dangerous  option  because
              Scdaemon  assumes exclusive access to the card and for example caches certain information from the
              card.  Use this option only if you know what you are doing.

       <b>--pcsc-driver</b> <u>library</u>
              Use <u>library</u> to access the smartcard reader.  The current default on Unix is  ‘<u>libpcsclite.so</u>’  and
              on Windows ‘<u>winscard.dll</u>’.  Instead of using this option you might also want to install a symbolic
              link to the default file name (e.g. from ‘<u>libpcsclite.so.1</u>’).  A Unicode file name may not be used
              on Windows.

       <b>--disable-ccid</b>
              The integrated CCID driver for CCID compliant devices can be available when libusb was detected at
              build  time, and it is used to access the smartcard reader.  If access via PC/SC driver is needed,
              please configure this option to disable CCID driver support (if any).  In GnuPG 2.2, there  was  a
              fallback  mechanism  from  CCID  driver  to  PC/SC driver.  The fallback mechanism worked, because
              scdaemon in GnuPG 2.2 only supported a single token/reader.  To support of multiple tokens/readers
              at the same time, fallback mechanism was removed.

       <b>--reader-port</b> <u>number_or_string</u>
              This option may be used to specify the port of the card terminal.  A value  of  0  refers  to  the
              first  serial  device;  add 32768 to access USB devices.  The default is 32768 (first USB device).
              PC/SC or CCID readers might need a string here; run the program in verbose mode to get a  list  of
              available readers.  The default is then the first reader found.

              To get a list of available CCID readers you may use this command:
           echo scd getinfo reader_list \
             | gpg-connect-agent --decode | awk '/^D/ {print $2}'

       <b>--card-timeout</b> <u>n</u>
              This  option  is  deprecated.   In GnuPG 2.0, it used to be used for DISCONNECT command to control
              timing issue.  Since DISCONNECT command works synchronously, it has no effect.

       <b>--enable-pinpad-varlen</b>
              Please specify this option when the card reader supports variable length input for pinpad (default
              is no).  For known readers (listed in ccid-driver.c and apdu.c), this option is not needed.   Note
              that  if  your card reader doesn't supports variable length input but you want to use it, you need
              to specify your pinpad request on your card.

       <b>--disable-pinpad</b>
              Even if a card reader features a pinpad, do not try to use it.

       <b>--deny-admin</b>
              This option disables the use  of  admin  class  commands  for  card  applications  where  this  is
              supported.   Currently  we  support  it  for  the  OpenPGP  card. This option is useful to inhibit
              accidental access to admin class command which could ultimately lock the card  through  wrong  PIN
              numbers.   Note  that  GnuPG versions older than 2.0.11 featured an <b>--allow-admin</b> option which was
              required to use such admin commands.  This option has no more effect today because the default  is
              now to allow admin commands.

       <b>--disable-application</b> <u>name</u>
              This  option  disables  the  use  of  the  card application named <u>name</u>.  This is mainly useful for
              debugging or if a application with lower priority should be used by default.

       <b>--application-priority</b> <u>namelist</u>
              This option allows one to change the order in which applications of a card a tried if no  specific
              application  was  requested.   <u>namelist</u>  is  a space or comma delimited list of application names.
              Unknown names are simply skipped.  Applications not mentioned in the list are put  in  the  former
              order at the end of the new priority list.

              To get the list of current active applications, use
             gpg-connect-agent 'scd getinfo app_list' /bye

       All  the  long  options  may  also be given in the configuration file after stripping off the two leading
       dashes.

</pre><h4><b>CARD</b> <b>APPLICATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>scdaemon</b> supports the card applications as described below.

   <b>The</b> <b>OpenPGP</b> <b>card</b> <b>application</b> <b>``openpgp''</b>

       This application is currently only used by <b>gpg</b> but may in future also be useful with  <b>gpgsm</b>.   Version  1
       and version 2 of the card is supported.

       The specifications for these cards are available at
       (<b><a href="http://g10code.com/docs/openpgp-card-1.0.pdf">http://g10code.com/docs/openpgp-card-1.0.pdf</a></b>) and
       (<b><a href="http://g10code.com/docs/openpgp-card-2.0.pdf">http://g10code.com/docs/openpgp-card-2.0.pdf</a></b>).

   <b>The</b> <b>Telesec</b> <b>NetKey</b> <b>card</b> <b>``nks''</b>

       This  is  the  main  application  of  the Telesec cards as available in Germany.  It is a superset of the
       German DINSIG card.  The card is used by <b>gpgsm</b>.

   <b>The</b> <b>DINSIG</b> <b>card</b> <b>application</b> <b>``dinsig''</b>

       This is an application as described in the German draft standard <u>DIN</u> <u>V</u> <u>66291-1</u>.  It  is  intended  to  be
       used by cards supporting the German signature law and its bylaws (SigG and SigV).

   <b>The</b> <b>PKCS#15</b> <b>card</b> <b>application</b> <b>``p15''</b>

       This is common framework for smart card applications.  It is used by <b>gpgsm</b>.

   <b>The</b> <b>Geldkarte</b> <b>card</b> <b>application</b> <b>``geldkarte''</b>

       This  is  a  simple  application  to display information of a German Geldkarte.  The Geldkarte is a small
       amount debit card application which comes with almost all German banking cards.

   <b>The</b> <b>SmartCard-HSM</b> <b>card</b> <b>application</b> <b>``sc-hsm''</b>

       This application adds read-only support for keys and  certificates  stored  on  a  (<b><a href="http://www.smartcard">http://www.smartcard</a>-</b>
       <b>hsm.com,</b> <b>SmartCard-HSM</b>).

       To  generate keys and store certificates you may use (<b>https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki/SmartCardHSM,</b>
       <b>OpenSC</b>) or the tools from (<b><a href="http://www.openscdp.org">http://www.openscdp.org</a>,</b> <b>OpenSCDP</b>).

       The SmartCard-HSM cards requires a card reader that supports Extended Length APDUs.

   <b>The</b> <b>Undefined</b> <b>card</b> <b>application</b> <b>``undefined''</b>

       This is a stub application to allow the use of the APDU command even if no supported application is found
       on the card.  This application is not used automatically but  must  be  explicitly  requested  using  the
       SERIALNO command.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
         $ scdaemon --server -v

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  a  few configuration files to control certain aspects of <b>scdaemons</b>'s operation. Unless noted,
       they are expected in the current home directory (see: [option --homedir]).

       <b>scdaemon.conf</b>
              This is the standard configuration file read by <b>scdaemon</b> on startup.  It  may  contain  any  valid
              long  option;  the  leading  two  dashes may not be entered and the option may not be abbreviated.
              This default name may be changed on the command line (see: [option --options]).

       <b>scd-event</b>
              If this file is present and executable, it will be called on every card  reader's  status  change.
              An  example  of  this  script  is  provided  with  the  source  code distribution.  This option is
              deprecated in favor of the <b>DEVINFO</b> <b>--watch</b>.

       <b>reader_</b><u>n</u><b>.status</b>
              This file is created by <b>scdaemon</b> to let other applications now about reader status  changes.   Its
              use is now deprecated in favor of ‘<u>scd-event</u>’.
