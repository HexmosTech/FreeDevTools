       rc-alert - check for installed packages with release-critical bugs

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rc-alert</b> [<u>inclusion</u> <u>options</u>] [<b>--debtags</b> [<u>tag</u>[<b>,</b><u>tag</u> ...]]] [<b>--popcon</b>] [<u>package</u> ...]
       <b>rc-alert</b> <b>--help</b>|<b>--version</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rc-alert</b>  downloads  the  list  of release-critical bugs from the Debian BTS webpages, and then outputs a
       list of packages installed on the system, or given on the command-line, which are in that list.

       If the directory <u>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/devscripts/rc-alert</u> exists or the <b>--cache</b>  option  is  given,  then  the
       (sizable)  downloaded list will be cached, and will only be downloaded again on a second invocation if it
       has changed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--cache</b>
              Force the creation of the <u>$XDG_CACHE_HOME/devscripts/rc-alert</u> cache directory.

       <b>--help</b>, <b>-h</b>
              Show a summary of options.

       <b>--version</b>, <b>-v</b>
              Show version and copyright information.

       It is also possible to filter the list of bugs reported based on the tags  and  distributions  associated
       with the package. The filtering options are:

       <b>--include-tags</b>, <b>-f</b>
              A  list  of  tags which the bug must have, in the format used for output.  For example, to include
              bugs tagged security or help wanted, use "SH".

       <b>--include-tag-op</b>, <b>-t</b>
              If set to <u>and</u>, a bug must have all of the tags specified by <b>--include-tags</b>.

       <b>--exclude-tags</b>
              A list of tags which the bug must not have, in the same format as <b>--include-tags</b>.

       <b>--exclude-tag-op</b>
              If set to <u>and</u>, a bug must have none of the tags specified by <b>--exclude-tags</b>.  By default, the  bug
              will be excluded if any tag matches.

       <b>--include-dists</b>, <b>-d</b>
              A  list of distributions which the bug must apply to, in the format used for output.  For example,
              to include bugs affecting testing or unstable, use "TU".

       <b>--include-dist-op</b>, <b>-o</b>
              If set to <u>and</u>, a bug must apply to all of the specified distributions in order to be included.

       <b>--exclude-dists</b>
              A list of distributions to which the bug must not apply, in the same format as <b>--include-dists</b>.

       <b>--exclude-dist-op</b>
              If set to <u>and</u>, a bug must apply to all of the specified distributions in order to be excluded.  By
              default the bug will be excluded if it applies to any of the listed distributions.

       It is also possible to only list bugs which have specific debtags set. Note that you need to have debtags
       installed and also that it's not mandatory for maintainers to set proper debtags. The produced list  will
       thus probably be incomplete.

       <b>--debtags</b>
              Match  packages  based  on  the listed tags. Each package is matched only if it has all the listed
              tags; in the case of multiple tags within the same facet, a package is matched if it  has  any  of
              the listed tags within the facet.

       <b>--debtags-database</b>
              Use a non-standard debtags database.  The default is <u>/var/lib/debtags/packages-tags</u>.

       Popularity-contest  collects  data  about installation and usage of Debian packages. You can additionally
       sort the bugs by the popcon rank of the related packages.

       <b>--popcon</b>
              Sort bugs by the popcon rank of the package the bug belongs to.

       <b>--pc-vote</b>
              By default, packages are sorted according to the number of people who have the package  installed.
              This  option  enables  sorting  by  the number of people regularly using the package instead. This
              option has no effect in combination with --pc-local.

       <b>--pc-local</b>
              Instead  of  requesting  remote  data  the  information  from  the  last  popcon   run   is   used
              (<u>/var/log/popularity-contest</u>).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--include-dists</b> OS
              The bug must apply to at least one of oldstable or stable

       <b>--include-dists</b> TU <b>--include-dist-op</b> and
              The bug must apply to both testing and unstable

       <b>--include-dists</b> O <b>--include-tags</b> S <b>--exclude-tags</b> +
              The bug must apply to oldstable and be tagged security but not patch

       <b>--exclude-dists</b> SOT <b>--include-tags</b> R
              The bug must apply to only unstable or experimental (or both) and be tagged unreproducible

       <b>--debtags</b> implemented-in::perl,role::plugin,implemented-in::python
              The  bug  must  apply to packages matching the specified debtags, i.e. the match will only include
              packages that have the 'role::plugin' tag and that have either of the tags  'implemented-in::perl'
              or 'implemented-in::python'.

       <b>--popcon</b> <b>--pc-local</b>
              Read <u>/var/log/popularity-contest</u> and sort bugs by your personal popcon ranking (which is basically
              the atime of your packages' binaries).

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       It is not possible to say "does not apply only to unstable"
