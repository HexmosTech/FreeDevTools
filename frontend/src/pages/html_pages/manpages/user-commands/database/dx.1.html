</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>dx</u> is the command that starts the Data Explorer Startup Window, and optionally starts the  <u>Data</u>  <u>Explorer</u>
       <u>User</u> <u>Interface</u>, <u>Data</u> <u>Explorer</u> <u>Executive</u>, <u>Data</u> <u>Explorer</u> <u>Data</u> <u>Prompter</u>, <u>Data</u> <u>Explorer</u> <u>Module</u> <u>Builder</u> or the
       <u>Data</u> <u>Explorer</u> <u>Tutorial</u>.

       The  Data Explorer Startup Window is an X windows/Motif based application which allows easy access to the
       other subsystemes of the Data Explorer visualization system.

       The <u>Data</u> <u>Explorer</u> <u>User</u> <u>Interface</u>  is  an  X  windows/Motif  based  application  that  provides  a  visual
       programming  environment  and  an  interface  to the executive.  The executive provides the computational
       tools and mechanisms to create data visualizations.  The

       <u>Data</u> <u>Explorer</u> <u>Data</u> <u>Prompter</u> is an X windows/Motif based application that helps users  import  data  in  a
       variety  of  formats,  and provides general purpose visual programs to visual imported data, leading to a
       shortened "time to first picture".

       The <u>Data</u> <u>Explorer</u> <u>Module</u> <u>Builder</u> is an X windows/Motif based application that helps users build their own
       modules to be included in a custom version of Data Explorer.

       The <u>Data</u> <u>Explorer</u> <u>Tutorial</u> is an application that helps users learn to use Data Explorer by leading  them
       through  a  sequence  of  tasks.  Users can easily skip around in the tutorial in order to concentrate on
       tasks of most use to their work.

       For a more complete  description  of  the  <u>Data</u>  <u>Explorer</u>  <u>User</u>  <u>Interface</u>  <u>and</u>  <u>Executive</u>  see  the  <b>IBM</b>
       <b>Visualization</b>  <b>Data</b>  <b>Explorer</b>  <b>User's</b>  <b>Guide</b>.   For a more complete description of the <u>Data</u> <u>Explorer</u> <u>Data</u>
       <u>Prompter</u> see the <b>IBM</b> <b>Visualization</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Explorer</b> <b>QuickStart</b> <b>Guide</b>.  For a more  thorough  description  of
       the <u>Data</u> <u>Explorer</u> <u>Module</u> <u>Builder</u> see the <b>IBM</b> <b>Visualization</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Explorer</b> <b>Programmer's</b> <b>Reference</b>.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       With no options the <u>dx</u> command starts the Startup Window, an X windows/Motif program from which the other
       parts  of  the  Data  Explorer  system  can be started.  The various command line options and environment
       variables listed below can be specified to change the default behavior.

       Options set by including them in the DXARGS environment variable are placed at the start of  the  command
       line,  followed by any options set by environment variables, followed by explicit command line arguments.
       When conflicting options are given, the last option has precedence.

       <b>-8bitcmap</b> &lt; private | shared | 0-1  | -1 &gt;
              Overrides the DX8BITCMAP environment variable (see ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES below).

       <b>-cache</b> &lt; on | off &gt;
              Turn on or off the executive caching system.  When the Data Explorer caching mechanism is  enabled
              the  Data  Explorer  executive  automatically caches the intermediate results generated during its
              visualization computations.  Unlike standard caching mechanisms, these  results  are  accessed  by
              means  of  their functional derivation.  This allows for automatic graph optimization and helps to
              avoid the recomputation of previously utilized intermediates, especially when  the  Data  Explorer
              sequencer  is  being used.  In certain rare instances, a machine with a small amount of memory may
              want to disable this caching to conserve memory and reduce paging.  Default = on.

       <b>-colors</b> &lt; colors file &gt;
              Override DXCOLORS environment variable (see ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES below).

       <b>-connect</b> &lt; host:port &gt;
              Start a distributed executive only (no user interface).

       <b>-data</b> &lt; path list &gt;
              Override DXDATA environment variable (see ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES below).

       <b>-directory</b> &lt; dir &gt;
              Cause the executive to be run in the given directory.

       <b>-display</b> &lt; display name &gt;
              Set the name of the X display to be used by the user interface and the executive.

       <b>-dxroot</b> &lt; dir &gt;
              Overrides the default dx root directory.

       <b>-echo</b> &lt; dir &gt;
              Echo the command lines without executing them.

       <b>-edit</b>  Cause the user interface to be started with the Visual Program Editor  (VPE)  window  as  the  top
              level window of the user interface (the top level window is denoted by an anchor in the upper left
              hand corner).  Also see -image, -startup,  and -menubar.

       <b>-encode</b> &lt; filename &gt;
              Encode  the  given  file  into  a  binary format with a key (which must be specified with the -key
              option). For example
                  dx -encode -key 1234567890abcdef foo.net The resulting file can only be encoded by the DX user
              interface when the same key is used. For example
                  dx -image -key 1234567890abcdef foo-e.net

       <b>-exec</b> &lt; executive executable &gt;
              Use the given file as a replacement for the executive.  This option allows a user to build and use
              his/her own custom executive.

       <b>-execonly</b>
              Start the executive in remote mode in which  it  will  then  await  a  connection  from  the  user
              interface.  The user interface is not started with this option.  Also see -script.

       <b>-execute</b>
              Execute once after the user interface has made a connection with the executive.

       <b>-execute_on_change</b>
              Cause  Data Explorer to go into execute-on-change mode at start up.  Execute-on-change mode causes
              the Visual Program to be executed any time any of  the  values  (i.e.  module  inupts,  interactor
              values...)  in the program change.

       <b>-file</b> &lt; filename &gt;
              Start  the  Data  Prompter,  Module  Builder, or Data Explorer User Interface with the header file
              filename.

       <b>-full</b>  When used with -prompter, starts the full Data Prompter.

       <b>-help</b>  Print a brief listing of options and usage for <u>dx</u>.

       <b>-highlight</b> &lt; on | off &gt;
              Turn on or off module execution highlighting.  If highlighting is turned on,  the  user  interface
              will highlight each module as it is executed.  Default = on.

       <b>-host</b> &lt; host name &gt;
              Override DXHOST environment variable (see ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES below).

       <b>-hwrender</b> &lt; gl | opengl &gt;
              Override  the  default hardware rendering choice on platforms where both are supported. Default is
              opengl. Sets the DXHWMOD environment variable to either DXhwdd.o or DXhwddOGL.o.

       <b>-image</b> Cause the user interface to be started with the image window as the top level window of  the  user
              interface.   Also,  control panels that are configured to open automatically are opened.  Also see
              -edit, -startup and -menubar.

       <b>-include</b> &lt; path list &gt;
              Override DXINCLUDE environment variable (see ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES below).

       <b>-key</b> &lt; 64bit hex &gt;
              16 character hexadecimal (64bit) number that is used to encode and decode .net files. See -encode.

       <b>-license</b> &lt; type &gt;
              Force a specific license for either the user interface or  executive.   The  following  are  valid
              values for type:

              runtime: forces a run-time license (UI or executive).

              timed: forces a timed (limited function) license (UI only).

              develop: forces a developer license (UI or executive).

       <b>-local</b> Override  the  DXHOST environment variable (if set) and cause the executive to be run on the local
              host.  In the absence of the DXHOST environment variable, this is the default.

       <b>-log</b> &lt; on | off &gt;
              Turn on or off executive logging.  If logging is on then the executive logs  output  to  the  file
              <u>dx.log</u> in the directory where the executive is executing.  Default = off.

       <b>-macros</b> &lt; path list &gt;
              Override the DXMACROS environment variable (see ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES below).

       <b>-menubar</b>
              Start Data Explorer with a menubar as the anchor window.  Also, control panels that are configured
              to open automatically are opened.  See also -image, -edit, and -startup.

       <b>-mdf</b> &lt; mdf file &gt;
              Override the DXMDF environment variable (see ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES below).

       <b>-memory</b> &lt; # of MB &gt;
              Set  the  maximum  amount  of memory, in megabytes rounded up to a two megabyte boundary, that the
              executive is able to allocate.  Default = the amount of physical memory minus 8 MB.

       <b>-metric</b>
              Have the ui use metric units when possible, for example for setting the image  size  for  printing
              postscript images.

       <b>-modules</b> &lt; pathlist &gt;
              Set the list of directories to be searched for outboard modules.

       <b>-morehelp</b>
              Displays this information

       <b>-nodeid</b>
              print  out  the  node  id  of  the  machine  that the command is run on.  The node id is used when
              generating a license.

       <b>-optimize</b> &lt; memory | precision &gt;
              Select whether to minimize memory usage or produce more color-accurate  images.   When  memory  is
              optimized,  image  objects  are  generated  with  24  bits/pixel instead of 96, and ReadImage will
              produce delayed color images if supported by the format. The default is precision.

       <b>-outboarddebug</b>
              Enable user to start outboard modules manually for debugging when they  are  called  in  a  visual
              program.

       <b>-processors</b>
              For Data Explorer SMP, sets the number of processors to use.

       <b>-program</b> &lt; programname &gt;
              Start the user interface with the visual program filename.

       <b>-prompter</b>
              Start the data prompter.

       <b>-readahead</b> &lt; on | off &gt;
              Specify whether or not the executive reads ahead in its input stream before executing the commands
              it  receives from the stream.  If this is turned off, then the executive will execute each command
              line as it is received.  This is useful for  certain  debugging  purposes,  such  as  memory  leak
              detection.  Default = on.

       <b>-script</b> [ &lt; script file &gt; ]
              Run  just  the  executive in script mode.  If a file name is provided then the executive reads and
              executes commands from the given script and then terminates.  If a file is not provided then  when
              the  executive  starts up it enters <u>interactive</u> mode where it waits for script commands.  Also see
              -execonly.

       <b>-startup</b>
              Start Data Explorer with the startup window as the initial window. This is the default.  See  also
              -image, -edit, and -menubar.

       <b>-suppress</b>
              Do not open any control panels at start-up. This is used in -image mode and -menubar mode only.

       <b>-timed</b> Start DX using a timed license.

       <b>-timing</b> &lt; on | off &gt;
              Turn  on or off the executive timing mechanism.  If enabled, then when the executive exits it will
              list on standard output or the logging file timing statistics for each module that was used during
              the course of execution.  Default = off.

       <b>-trace</b> &lt; on | off &gt;
              Turn on or off the executive trace mechanism.  When tracing  is  enabled  the  executive  displays
              informative  messages  about  the  execution sequence on either standard output or the log file if
              logging is enabled.  Default = off.

       <b>-trialkey</b>
              Determines the information necessary for generating a trialkey.

       <b>-tutor</b> Start the Data Explorer tutorial.

       <b>-uionly</b>
              Cause the user interface to be started without making a connection to an executive.

       <b>-verbose</b>
              Echo commands in the <u>dx</u> script as they are executed.

       <b>-version</b>
              Print version numbers of various executables.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables provide an alternate way to set certain of the command line  options,
       or  alter  the  default behavior of Data Explorer in some way. Options set with environment variables are
       overridden if the same option is also specified on  the  command  line.   Options  set  with  DXARGS  are
       overridden by both environment variables and explicit command line options.

       <b>DX8BITCMAP</b>
              When  Data  Explorer displays images in 8-bit windows, it makes every effort to create an accurate
              representation of the image using the default  colormap  shared  among  applications  using  8-bit
              windows.   If  the  colors required by Data Explorer are not present in the colormap and there are
              not enough free color cells available in the shared color map for their allocation, Data  Explorer
              will  find approximations among the colors that are available.  However, in certain circumstances,
              the difference between the desired color and the approximation is found to  be  too  great  to  be
              acceptable.  In such circumstances, DX will allocate a private colormap for more accurate results.
              In  this  case,  depending on your X server, you may need to move the mouse to select the Image or
              Display window in order for the correct colors to appear.  The -8bitcmap flag sets  the  level  at
              which  the  change  to  using a private colormap is made.  The value of this parameter should be a
              number between 0 and 1, or "private" or "shared", and it represents the Euclidean distance in  RGB
              color  space,  normalized to 1, for the maximum allowed discrepancy.  If you set this parameter to
              1, then a private colormap will never be used. If you set it to -1, then a private  colormap  will
              always be used. The default is 0.1.

       <b>DXARGS</b> This  contains the default set of arguments used by the <u>dx</u> script.  The arguments are prepended to
              those given to <u>dx</u> on the command line.  This variable allows for  the  <u>dx</u>  command  to  be  easily
              customized.

       <b>DXAXESMAXWIDTH</b>
              Sets  the  number  of digits in axes tick labels at which a switch to scientific notation is made.
              The default is 7.

       <b>DXCOLORS</b>
              This contains the name of an alternate  file that contains mappings of color names to red,  green,
              blue triplets in a format like that of the default color file found in /usr/lpp/dx/lib/colors.txt.

       <b>DXDATA</b> This  contains  a  colon separated list of directories in which the executive will search for data
              files.  Also see the -data option.

       <b>DXDELAYEDCOLORS</b>
              If set to anything other than 0, enables ReadImage to create delayed color images if the image  is
              a tiff format image saved in a byte-with-colormap format or a gif image.

       <b>DXEXEC</b> Specifies an executive to be run at start-up.

       <b>DXFLING</b>
              If  DXFLING is set to 1, then for hardware-rendered images, in rotation mode and execute-on-change
              mode, if you drag the mouse across the image, and release the mouse button outside the image,  the
              object  in  the image will begin to rotate, and will continue to rotate until you click inside the
              image.  The direction and speed of the mouse  motion  before  release  will  affect  the  rotation
              direction and rotation speed of the object in the window.

       <b>DXGAMMA</b>
              Sets  the  gamma correction for software-rendered images displayed to the screen using the Display
              and Image tools.  The default value is 2, except for 8-bit windows on the sgi architecture.

       <b>DXGAMMA_8BIT,</b>
              <b>DXGAMMA_12BIT,</b> <b>DXGAMMA_24BIT</b> sets the gamma correction factor for software-rendered images for the
              windows with the indicated window depth.  Overrides the value set by DXGAMMA.

       <b>DXHOST</b> This contains the name of the host machine that will run the executive.  If this is not set then a
              default of "localhost" is used, unless the local host is a PVS console in which case  the  default
              is to run the executive on the PVS.  Also see the -host, -local and -server options.

       <b>DXHWGAMMA</b>
              Sets  the  gamma correction for hardware-rendered images displayed to the screen using the Display
              and Image tools.  The default value is 2.

       <b>DXHWMOD</b>
              Specifies the name of the hardware rendering library to use  when  more  than  one  is  supported.
              Should be either DXhwdd.o or DXhwddOGL.o.

       <b>DXINCLUDE</b>
              This  contains  a  colon  separated  list  of  directories  in which the executive will search for
              "included" scripts.  Also see the -include option.

       <b>DXMACROS</b>
              This contains a colon separated list of directories in  which  the  user  interface  searches  for
              macros  that will be automatically loaded.  When running in script mode one must "include" all the
              macros by hand prior to referencing them.  Also see the -macros option.

       <b>DXMDF</b>  This contains the name of a module description file (mdf) that contains user defined modules for a
              customized version of the executive.  Also see the -mdf option.

       <b>DXMEMORY</b>
              sets the amount of memory (in megabytes) that can be used by the executive.

       <b>DXMODULES</b>
              This contains a colon separated list of directories in which the executive searches  for  outboard
              modules.  Also see the -modules option.

       <b>DX_NESTED_LOOPS</b>
              For faces, loops, and edges data, if set, allows loops other than the enclosing loop for a face to
              be  listed  first.  However,  there  is  a  consequent decrease in performance if this environment
              variable is set.

       <b>DXNO_BACKING_STORE</b>
              If set to anything, disables framebuffer readbacks.  Setting this environment variable may improve
              performance of interaction with hardware  rendered  images,  especially  for  machines  for  which
              readback  is slow. The default behavior is that framebuffer readbacks are enabled. If you set this
              environment variable, not that some interactions using the Image tool will result in a black image
              while interaction is taking place. However, if you are not using the Image tool,  it  is  strongly
              recommended that you set this environment variable.

       <b>DXPIXELTYPE</b>
              sets  the  image  type  to  either  24-bit color images or floating-point-based 96-bit images (the
              default). This affects the behavior of Render and ReadImage.  This variable can be set  to  either
              DXByte  (24  bits)  or  DXFloat  (96 bits).  Setting this variable to DXByte will result in images
              taking up less memory.

       <b>DXPROCESSORS</b>
              Sets the number of processors to be used for Data Explorer SMP.

       <b>DXRSH</b>  Specifies the remote shell command to use when connecting to other systems  (such  as  those  when
              using distributed execution). The default is the the path to rsh.

       <b>DXRSH_NOENV</b>
              Prevents the remote "invoke dxexec" script from being written with a full carbon copy of the local
              environment (only DISPLAY is set).

       <b>DXROOT</b> Specifies the top-level directory for all the files and directories needed by Data Explorer.

       <b>DXSHMEM</b>
              If  set  to  anything  other  than  -1,  forces  shared  memory  to  be  used  (if  allowed by the
              architecture).  If set to -1, (if allowed by the architecture) will  cause  the  data  segment  to
              simply be extended. Please see Appendix C of the Data Explorer User Guide for more information.

       <b>DX_SOCKET_BUFSIZE</b>
              Allows  the  user  to  specify  the size of the send and receive buffers for the socket connection
              between the UI and the exec. This value is clamped to the max allowed by the system. This can  fix
              a  problem  where  the  executive  and  UI  hang  involving  a  deadlock  situation  in the socket
              communication. The value assigned to it is passed as the parameter to  setsockopt  for  SOL_SNDBUF
              and SOL_RCVBUF. A typcial increased value may be 262144.

       <b>DX_USER_INTERACTOR_FILE</b>
              Specifies  a  file  containing  user interactors for use by the SuperviseState and SuperviseWindow
              modules.

       <b>DX_WEB_BROWSER</b>
              Under UNIX specifies the web browser to launch for viewing the HTML documentation.  Under  Windows
              and MacOS X setting this environment variable will launch the systems default web browser.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The next few examples assume that none of the DX environment variables have been set.

       1. To start both the user interface and the executive with the network named <u>cfd.net</u>:
              dx -edit -program cfd

       2. To start and execute the visual program <u>cfd.net</u> in image mode with /usr/users/me and /usr/data as data
       directories:
              dx -image -execute -data '/usr/users/me:/usr/data' cfd

       3. To run just the executive on the script named <u>f15wing</u>:

              dx -script -file f15wing

       4.  To  start the user interface and execute the user customized executive named <u>mydxexec</u> containing user
       defined modules described in <u>custom.mdf</u>:

              dx -edit -mdf custom.mdf -exec mydxexec

       5. To start the Data Prompter :

              dx -prompter

       6. To start the Module Builder :

              dx -builder
       7. To start the Tutorial :
