</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents the GNU version of <b>locate</b>.  For each given pattern,  <b>locate</b>  searches  one  or
       more  databases of file names and displays the file names that contain the pattern.  Patterns can contain
       shell-style metacharacters: `*', `?', and `[]'.  The metacharacters do not treat `/' or  `.'   specially.
       Therefore, a pattern `foo*bar' can match a file name that contains `foo3/bar', and a pattern `*duck*' can
       match  a file name that contains `lake/.ducky'.  Patterns that contain metacharacters should be quoted to
       protect them from expansion by the shell.

       If a pattern is a plain string — it contains no metacharacters — <b>locate</b> displays all file  names  in  the
       database  that  contain  that  string  anywhere.   If  a pattern does contain metacharacters, <b>locate</b> only
       displays file names that match the pattern exactly.  As a result, patterns  that  contain  metacharacters
       should  usually  begin with a `*', and will most often end with one as well.  The exceptions are patterns
       that are intended to explicitly match the beginning or end of a file name.

       The file name databases contain lists of files that were on the  system  when  the  databases  were  last
       updated.   The  system administrator can choose the file name of the default database, the frequency with
       which the databases are updated, and the directories for which they contain entries; see <b><a href="../man1/updatedb.1.html">updatedb</a></b>(1).

       If <b>locate</b>'s output is going to a terminal, unusual characters in the output are escaped in the  same  way
       as  for  the -print action of the <b>find</b> command.  If the output is not going to a terminal, file names are
       printed exactly as-is.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>-0,</u> <u>--null</u>
              Use ASCII NUL as a separator, instead of newline.

       <u>-A,</u> <u>--all</u>
              Print only names which match all non-option arguments, not those matching one or  more  non-option
              arguments.

       <u>-b,</u> <u>--basename</u>
              Results  are  considered to match if the pattern specified matches the final component of the name
              of a file as listed in the database.  This final component is usually referred  to  as  the  `base
              name'.

       <u>-c,</u> <u>--count</u>
              Instead of printing the matched filenames, just print the total number of matches we found, unless
              --<u>print</u> (-p) is also present.

       <u>-d</u> <u>path,</u> <u>--database=path</u>
              Instead of searching the default file name database, search the file name databases in <u>path</u>, which
              is  a  colon-separated  list  of  database  file names.  You can also use the environment variable
              <b>LOCATE_PATH</b> to set the list of database files to search.  The  option  overrides  the  environment
              variable  if both are used.  Empty elements in the path are taken to be synonyms for the file name
              of the default database.  A database can be supplied on stdin, using `-' as an element of <u>path</u>. If
              more than one element of <u>path</u> is `-', later instances  are  ignored  (and  a  warning  message  is
              printed).

              The  file  name  database  format  changed  starting with GNU <b>find</b> and <b>locate</b> version 4.0 to allow
              machines with different byte orderings to  share  the  databases.   This  version  of  <b>locate</b>  can
              automatically  recognize  and  read  databases  produced  for older versions of GNU <b>locate</b> or Unix
              versions of <b>locate</b> or <b>find</b>.  Support for the old locate database format will be discontinued in  a
              future release.

       <u>-e,</u> <u>--existing</u>
              Only  print  out  such  names  that  currently  exist (instead of such names that existed when the
              database was created).  Note that this may slow down the program a lot, if there are many  matches
              in  the  database.  If you are using this option within a program, please note that it is possible
              for the file to be deleted after <b>locate</b> has checked that it exists, but before you use it.

       <u>-E,</u> <u>--non-existing</u>
              Only print out such names that currently do not exist (instead of such names that existed when the
              database was created).  Note that this may slow down the program a lot, if there are many  matches
              in the database.

       <u>--help</u> Print a summary of the options to <b>locate</b> and exit.

       <u>-i,</u> <u>--ignore-case</u>
              Ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and the file names.

       <u>-l</u> <u>N,</u> <u>--limit=N</u>
              Limit  the  number  of  matches  to  N.   If a limit is set via this option, the number of results
              printed for the -c option will never be larger than this number.

       <u>-L,</u> <u>--follow</u>
              If testing for the existence of files (with the -e or -E options), consider broken symbolic  links
              to be non-existing.   This is the default.

       <u>--max-database-age</u> <u>D</u>
              Normally,  <b>locate</b>  will  issue  a warning message when it searches a database which is more than 8
              days old.  This option changes that value to something other than 8.  The effect of  specifying  a
              negative value is undefined.

       <u>-m,</u> <u>--mmap</u>
              Accepted but does nothing, for compatibility with BSD <b>locate</b>.

       <u>-P,</u> <u>-H,</u> <u>--nofollow</u>
              If  testing for the existence of files (with the -e or -E options), treat broken symbolic links as
              if they were existing files.  The -H form of this option is provided purely  for  similarity  with
              <b>find</b>; the use of -P is recommended over -H.

       <u>-p,</u> <u>--print</u>
              Print search results when they normally would not, because of the presence of --statistics (-S) or
              --count (-c).

       <u>-r,</u> <u>--regex</u>
              The  pattern specified on the command line is understood to be a regular expression, as opposed to
              a glob pattern.  The Regular expressions work in the same was as in <b>emacs</b> except for the fact that
              "." will match a newline.  GNU <b>find</b> uses the same regular expressions.  Filenames whose full paths
              match the specified regular expression are printed (or, in the case of the  -c  option,  counted).
              If  you wish to anchor your regular expression at the ends of the full path name, then as is usual
              with regular expressions, you should use the characters ^ and $ to signify this.

       <u>--regextype</u> <u>R</u>
              Use regular expression dialect R.  Supported dialects  include  `findutils-default',  `posix-awk',
              `posix-basic',  `posix-egrep',  `posix-extended',  `posix-minimal-basic',  `awk',  `ed',  `egrep',
              `emacs', `gnu-awk', `grep' and `sed'.  See the Texinfo documentation for a detailed explanation of
              these dialects.

       <u>-s,</u> <u>--stdio</u>
              Accepted but does nothing, for compatibility with BSD <b>locate</b>.

       <u>-S,</u> <u>--statistics</u>
              Print various statistics about each locate database and then exit  without  performing  a  search,
              unless  non-option  arguments  are given.  For compatibility with BSD, -S is accepted as a synonym
              for  --statistics.   However,  the  output  of  <b>locate</b>  <b>-S</b>  is  different  for  the  GNU  and  BSD
              implementations of <b>locate</b>.

       <u>--version</u>
              Print the version number of <b>locate</b> and exit.

       <u>-w,</u> <u>--wholename</u>
              Match against the whole name of the file as listed in the database.  This is the default.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>LOCATE_PATH</b>
              Colon-separated list of databases to search.  If the value has a leading or trailing colon, or has
              two colons in a row, you may get results that vary between different versions of <b>locate</b>.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>locate</b> program started life as the BSD fast find program, contributed to BSD by James A. Woods.  This
       was  described  by  his  paper  <u>Finding</u>  <u>Files</u>  <u>Fast</u>  which was published in Usenix <u>;login:</u>, Vol 8, No 1,
       February/March, 1983, pp. 8-10.   When the <b>find</b> program began to assume a default  <b>-print</b>  action  if  no
       action  was  specified,  this  changed  the interpretation of <b>find</b> <b>pattern</b>.  The BSD developers therefore
       moved the fast find functionality into <b>locate</b>.  The GNU implementation of <b>locate</b> appears  to  be  derived
       from the same code.

       Significant changes to <b>locate</b> in reverse order:
       4.3.7     Byte-order independent support for old database format
       4.3.3     locate <u>-i</u> supports multi-byte characters correctly
                 Introduced <u>--max_db_age</u>
       4.3.2     Support for the slocate database format
       4.2.22    Introduced the <u>--all</u> option
       4.2.15    Introduced the <u>--regex</u> option
       4.2.14    Introduced options <u>-L,</u> <u>-P,</u> <u>-H</u>
       4.2.12    Empty items in <b>LOCATE_PATH</b> now indicate the default database
       4.2.11    Introduced the <u>--statistics</u> option
       4.2.4     Introduced <u>--count</u> and <u>--limit</u>
       4.2.0     Glob characters cause matching against the whole file name
       4.0       Introduced the LOCATE02 database format
       3.7       Locate can search multiple databases

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>locate</b>  database  correctly  handles  filenames  containing  newlines, but only if the system's sort
       command has a working <u>-z</u> option.  If you suspect that <b>locate</b> may  need  to  return  filenames  containing
       newlines, consider using its <u>--null</u> option.
