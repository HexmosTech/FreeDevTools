</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       adplugdb - AdPlug database maintenance utility

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>adplugdb</b> [OPTION]... COMMAND [ARGUMENT]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>adplugdb</b> maintains database files in AdPlug database format. It can <b>add</b>, <b>list</b> and <b>remove</b> records within a
       central database, or <b>merge</b> a set of databases together into one single database.

       <b>adplugdb</b>  always operates on a central database file. The location of this database file is determined by
       first checking if the user has a home directory. If a home directory is present, the database  file  will
       be  located in <b><a href="file:~/.adplug/adplug.db">~/.adplug/adplug.db</a></b>. If a home directory is not present, a database file <b>adplug.db</b> will be
       looked for in the current working directory.

       A system-wide database file can be used instead, by specifying the <b>-s</b> commandline option. The system-wide
       database file is located in <b>/usr/local/com/adplug/adplug.db</b> and may only be manipulated as the superuser.
       An arbitrary database file might be used as well, by specifying the <b>-d</b> commandline  parameter.  Only  one
       database file may be manipulated at a time.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>adplugdb</b>  returns  with  a  successful  exit  status  (<b>0</b>  on  most  systems)  on successful operation. An
       unsuccessful exit status (<b>1</b> on most systems) is returned otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       Commands control the main operation mode of <b>adplugdb</b>. Commands can have a number of arguments.  Only  one
       command may be specified at a time.

       <b>add</b>    This  command  takes a list of filenames, separated by spaces, as arguments. Each file is examined
              and a record is added to the database if the file is supported by AdPlug. By default,  the  record
              will  be  of  type  <b>Plain</b>,  unless the <b>-t</b> commandline option is specified (see below). The default
              comment entry is the specified filename. If a record for a file is already  in  the  database,  it
              will be replaced by the new record.

       <b>list</b>   This  command takes an optional list of filenames or keys, separated by spaces, as arguments. Each
              file is examined and the corresponding record is looked up from  the  database  and  displayed  on
              <b>stdout</b>,  in  a  human-readable  form. If no arguments are given, all records from the database are
              displayed.

       <b>remove</b> This command takes a list of filenames or keys, separated by spaces, as arguments.  Each  file  is
              examined and the corresponding record is removed from the database.

       <b>merge</b>  This  command takes a list of database filenames, separated by spaces, as arguments. Each database
              file is loaded and the contents are merged and written to the central database file. The  database
              files  are  processed  in  the order they are specified on the commandline. Records from databases
              that were specified earlier take precedence over records from databases that were specified later.
              Records from the central database take precedence over all other records.  This  means  that  only
              additional  records from the other databases will be added to the central database and if a record
              is found that is not already in the central database, the  version  from  the  earliest  specified
              database  that  contains  this record will be taken. In no way will records ever be overwritten in
              the central database.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The order of the option commandline parameters is not important.

   <b>Database</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-d</b> <b>&lt;file&gt;</b>
              Specify an arbitrary file to use as the central database.

       <b>-s</b>     Use the system-wide database file as the central database. This option is only present if <b>adplugdb</b>
              was compiled with system-wide database file support.

       <b>-t</b> <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>
              Specify a record type to be used as the type for all newly added  records.  Each  record  needs  a
              special  type  to  be  useful  to  AdPlug's  players. The commandline help, displayed using the <b>-h</b>
              commandline option, presents a list of types that may be specified.

       <b>-c</b>     Prompt for record comment. If this option is given, the user will be prompted and asked  for  each
              newly added record's comment.

       <b>-k</b>     Specify  keys  instead  of filenames. If this option is given, all command arguments that normally
              are filenames are expected to be record keys instead. Each record in the  database  has  a  unique
              identifying  key,  generated from the corresponding file's contents. To manipulate a record entry,
              you either must have the exact same file and specify its name, or you specify  the  record's  key,
              using  this  option. Keys are specified the same way they are displayed using the <b>list</b> command, as
              CRC16:CRC32 value in hexadecimal format.

   <b>Generic</b> <b>options:</b>
       <b>-q,</b> <b>--quiet</b>
              Be more quiet.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Be more verbose.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Show summary of commandline commands, arguments and options.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Show version and author information of the program.
