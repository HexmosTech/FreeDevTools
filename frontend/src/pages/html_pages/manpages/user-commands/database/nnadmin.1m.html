</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nnadmin - nn database administration

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nnadmin</b> [ <u>commands</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>nnadmin</u>  is  a  control  program  for  the  <u><a href="../man1M/nnmaster.1M.html">nnmaster</a></u>(1M)  daemon  which  is  responsible for building and
       maintaining the database used by the <u><a href="../man1/nn.1.html">nn</a></u>(1) news reader.

       <u>nnadmin</u> allows you to display extracts from the log file, display the "raw"  contents  of  the  database,
       make  consistency  checks  on  the  database, instruct the running <u>nnmaster</u> to expire one or more groups,
       alter the options of the running <u>nnmaster</u>, and much more.

       <u>nnadmin</u> runs in two modes: interactive and non-interactive.

       In interactive mode, simple one line menus are used to show  the  available  operations  which  are  then
       selected  by  typing  the  letter  associated  with the command (normally the first letter in the command
       name).

       In non-interactive mode, the <u>commands</u> argument will  be  used  as  a  series  of  key-strokes  which  are
       interpreted exactly as if they were typed in from the keyboard in interactive mode.  For example, to stop
       the <u>nnmaster</u>, the following invocation of nnadmin can be used:
            <u>nnadmin</u> MK
       which will select the (M)aster submenu from the main menu, and then the (K)ill entry from the submenu.

       In  non-interactive mode, the menus are not displayed and the commands are not echoed!  <u>nnadmin</u> will exit
       when there are no more key-strokes to be read from the <u>commands</u> argument.  It is not possible to  specify
       a  group name in the <u>commands</u> argument, so the functionalities of <u>nnadmin</u> that relates to specific groups
       are only available in interactive mode.

       Some "dangerous" commands will require that you confirm them by following them  by  "Y"  on  the  command
       line.  The most noteable are IY (initialize database) and EY (expire all groups).  These commands will be
       marked with a <b>[Y]</b> following the command name.

       You can also invoke an interactive <u>nnadmin</u> using the <b>:admin</b> command in <u>nn</u>.

</pre><h4><b>SHELL</b> <b>ESCAPES</b></h4><pre>
       At all prompts you can hit `!' to spawn a subshell.

       The  working  directory  of  the subshell will be changed to the database directory when invoked from the
       MASTER or DUMP menus, and it will changed to the group's spool directory (if it exists) when invoked from
       the GROUP menu.

</pre><h4><b>MAIN</b> <b>MENU</b></h4><pre>
       From the main menu (identified by the <b>ADMIN</b> prompt) you can select the following operations:

       <b>C)onf</b>
              Show current configuration parameters such as directories, files, programs, network usage, etc.

       <b>E)xpire</b> <b>[Y]</b>
              Send a request to the <u>nnmaster</u> daemon to schedule (and run) expire for all groups in the database.

       <b>G)roups</b>
              Enter the GROUP submenu.

       <b>I)nit</b> <b>[Y]</b>
              Send a request to the <u>nnmaster</u> daemon to recollect all groups in the database.

       <b>L)og</b>
              Enter the LOG submenu.

       <b>M)aster</b>
              Enter the MASTER submenu.

       <b>Q)uit</b>
              Quit <u>nnadmin</u>.

       <b>S)tat</b>
              Print general statistics about the database.  See the section on Database Statistics below.

       <b>U)pdate</b>
              Update the incore copy of the database master index.

       <b>V)alidate</b>
              Make a thorough consistency check on the database.  If inconsistencies are found in a  group,  you
              will  be  asked whether a request should be sent to the <u>nnmaster</u> daemon to recollect the group (in
              non-interactive mode, requests will be sent automatically for all corrupted groups).

       <b>W)akeup</b>
              Send a wakeup signal to the <u>nnmaster</u> daemon to have it receive messages sent to  it,  perform  the
              required actions, and then collect articles as necessary.

       <b>Z</b> (silent validation)
              This  operation  is  identical to the Validate operation, expect that no output is produced during
              the consistency check; this operation is used by the <u>nnmaster</u> to execute the -<b>C</b> option.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>MASTER</b> <b>MENU</b></h4><pre>
       The master menu (identified by the <b>MASTER</b> prompt) provides access to overall database information, and to
       send control messages to the <u>nnmaster</u> daemon.

       <b>C)heck</b> In interactive mode and in verbose batch mode  (<u>nnadmin</u>  MC),  print  a  message  telling  whether
              <u>nnmaster</u>  is  running  or not.  In silent batch mode (<u>nnadmin</u> =MC) exit with a status code of 0 if
              <u>nnmaster</u> is running and 1 otherwise; this may be useful is administrative scripts.

       <b>D)ump</b>  Enter the DUMP submenu.

       <b>F)iles</b>
              Print a listing (using <u><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></u>(1)) of all the data and index files in the database.

       <b>G)roup</b>
              Print the master index entry for a single group identified by its internal group number.

       <b>K)ill</b>
              Stop the <u>nnmaster</u> when it has finished its current task.

       <b>O)ptions</b>
              Change the runtime options of the running <u>nnmaster</u> daemon.  Currently, only the value  of  the  -r
              and -e options can be modified.

       <b>S)tat</b>
              Print general statistics about the database.  See the section on Database Statistics below.

       <b>T)race</b>
              Turn the trace option -t on or off in the running <u>nnmaster</u>.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>DUMP</b> <b>MENU</b></h4><pre>
       The  dump  menu  (identified  by  the <b>DUMP</b> prompt) allows you to print the master index entry for various
       selections of groups in the database.

       <b>A)ll</b>
              Print all groups in the database.

       <b>E)mpty</b>
              Print the empty groups in the database.

       <b>H)oles</b> Print the groups where the `min' field in the active file is not the first article  saved  in  the
              database  (because  it  doesn't  exist or because it is ignored for some other reason, e.g. bad or
              old).

       <b>I)gnored</b>
              Print groups which are ignored, either in the GROUPS file  or  because  of  some  other  condition
              (mainly no spool directory).

       <b>N)on-empty</b>
              Print the non-empty groups in the database.

       <b>V)alid</b> Print the groups which are present in the active file.

       <b>in(W)alid</b>
              Print the groups in the database which are not present in the active file.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>LOG</b> <b>MENU</b></h4><pre>
       The  log  menu (identified by the <b>LOG</b> prompt) enables you the extract specific entries from the log file,
       and to truncate the log file.

       The entries in the log file share the following format:
            &lt;class&gt;: &lt;date&gt; &lt;time&gt; (&lt;user&gt;): &lt;message&gt;
       where &lt;class&gt; identifies the message class, the &lt;date&gt; and &lt;time&gt; specify when the entry  was  made,  the
       &lt;user&gt;  specifies  who  created  the entry (the letter "M" denote the <u>nnmaster</u>), and the &lt;message&gt; is the
       text of the entry.

       To extract the log file entries of a specific class, simply enter the letter identifying the class:

       <b>A</b> <b>-</b> <b>admin</b> <b>to</b> <b>master</b> <b>communication</b>
              This class of messages are related to the sending of messages  from  an  <u>nnadmin</u>  program  to  the
              <u>nnmaster</u> daemon.

       <b>B</b> <b>-</b> <b>bad</b> <b>articles</b>
              Reports about bad articles which have been ignored or removed (controlled by the -<b>b</b> and -<b>B</b> options
              to <u>nnmaster</u>).

       <b>C</b> <b>-</b> <b>collection</b> <b>statistics</b>
              Statistics about collection of new articles.  The message has the format:
                   Collect: <u>nnn</u> art, <u>ppp</u> gr, <u>ttt</u> s
              meaning that <u>nnn</u> articles in <u>ppp</u> groups were collected in <u>ttt</u> seconds (real time).

       <b>E</b> <b>-</b> <b>fatal</b> <b>errors</b>
              Fatal  errors  encountered during operation.  These errors require manual intervention to be fixed
              (some of the fatal errors occur if thing that "cannot happen" happens anyway, and may  indicate  a
              bug in the software).

       <b>M</b> <b>-</b> <b>nnmaster</b> <b>messages.</b>
              Master start/stop messages.

       <b>N</b> <b>-</b> <b>NNTP</b> <b>related</b> <b>messages</b>
              Various  messages  related  to  the  NNTP  part of the nnmaster, mostly about lost connections and
              failed attempts to connect to the NNTP server.  These messages should only appear if you use NNTP,
              and your NNTP server is down for some reason.

       <b>O</b> <b>-</b> <b>old</b> <b>articles</b>
              Reports related to ignoring (and removing) old articles when building the database (controlled  by
              the -<b>O</b> and -<b>B</b> options to <u>nnmaster</u>).

       <b>R</b> <b>-</b> <b>reports</b>
              Non-fatal error which enables the <u>nnmaster</u> to continue operation, but may prevent a user to run <u>nn</u>
              (file access problems).  Reported problems should be checked.  The most common report message will
              probably be
                   some.group: no directory
              which  indicates  that  the spool directory for that group has disappeared (most likely because it
              has been rmgroup'ed).

       <b>T</b> <b>-</b> <b>trace</b> <b>output</b>
              Messages produced as a result of using the -t option on  the  <u>nnmaster</u>.   This  is  primarily  for
              debugging purposes.

       <b>U</b> <b>-</b> <b>usage</b> <b>statistics</b>
              If  <u>nn</u> is compiled with the STATISTICS option enabled, an entry will be made in the log file every
              time a user has spent more than five minutes on news reading.  The message will have the following
              format:
                   USAGE <u>hours.minutes</u>
              Since it is possible to suspend <u>nn</u>, or leave the terminal while <u>nn</u>  is  active,  <u>nn</u>  tries  to  be
              intelligent  when  it  calculates  the usage time so it will reflect the actual time spent on news
              reading.  The usage statistics can be summarized using the <u><a href="../man1M/nnusage.1M.html">nnusage</a></u>(1M) program.

       <b>V</b> <b>-</b> <b>validation</b> <b>errors</b>
              When inconsistencies are detected in the database during validation, an entry for  each  corrupted
              group will be entered in the log file.

       <b>X</b> <b>-</b> <b>expire</b> <b>statistics</b>
              Messages similar to the Collect statistics reporting the result of running expire on the database.
              Reports  related  to  ignoring,  removing,  renumbering, and reactivation of groups are also given
              class X.

       To extract a specific entry class, <u><a href="../man1/grep.1.html">grep</a></u>(1) is used, so it may take a while on a large log file.

       There are also a few special operations on the log file:

       <b>G)roup</b>
              Extract the entries which refers to a specified group.

       <b>(1-9)</b> <b>tail</b>
              Invoke <u><a href="../man1/tail.1.html">tail</a></u>(1) to extract the last 10-90 entries in the log file.

       <b>space</b>
              Equivalent to <b>1</b> (list last 10 lines of log).

       <b>(.)</b> <b>all</b>
              Display the complete log file.

       <b>(@)</b> <b>clean</b> <b>[Y]</b>
              Move the Log file to Log.old, and create a new empty Log file.  If you want to clean out  the  old
              log file as well, simply repeat the clean operation (this will result in an empty Log.old file.)

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>GROUP</b> <b>MENU</b></h4><pre>
       When you enter the group menu (identified by the <b>GROUP</b> prompt), <u>nnadmin</u> will prompt you for the name of a
       news group, which you can enter with the usual completion feature described in the <u><a href="../man1/nn.1.html">nn</a></u>(1) manual.  You can
       then perform the following operations on the specified group:

       <b>C)lear_flag</b>
              Clear a group specific flag.  See the section on group flags below.

       <b>D)ata</b>
              Dump the contents of the data file containing the extracted article headers for the group.

       <b>E)xpire</b>
              Request the <u>nnmaster</u> to run expire on the group.

       <b>F)iles</b>
              List the files (using <u><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></u>(1)) containing the index and data for the group.

       <b>G)roup</b>
              Switch to another group.

       <b>H)eader</b>
              Dump the master index entry for the group.

       <b>R)ecollect</b>
              Request the <u>nnmaster</u> to recollect all articles in the group.

       <b>S)et_flag</b>
              Set a group specific flag.  See the section on group flags below.

       <b>V)alidate</b>
              Perform validation on the group's database information.

       <b>Z)ap</b> <b>[Y]</b>
              Remove group from news system - this will be done by running the <u>rmgroup</u> program which must reside
              in the NEWS_LIB directory.  Of course, this should be done with great caution.

</pre><h4><b>INDIVIDUAL</b> <b>GROUP</b> <b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       You  can  set  and  clear  the  following  flags for individual groups to control the future behaviour of
       <u>nnmaster</u> on that group.

       Notice that these flags will be reset to their default value  if  you  reinitialize  the  database  using
       <u>nnmaster</u> -I.  To change these flags permanently, they should be set or cleared in the GROUPS file.

       <b>A)lways_digest</b>
              Normally,  <u>nnmaster</u>  will  only attempt to split digests into individual articles if it can easily
              recognize an article as a digest.  This requires that the word "digest" appears somewhere  in  the
              subject  line,  and that one of the first few lines in the body of the article loosely matches the
              subject.  A few news groups  frequently  receives  digests  which  break  one  or  both  of  these
              requirements.   To have <u>nnmaster</u> split these digests into individual articles anyway, you can turn
              on the "always digest" flag on these news groups.   This  will  instruct  <u>nnmaster</u>  to  treat  <u>all</u>
              articles  in  the  group as digests (naturally, articles which are then found not to contain other
              articles are still treated as normal articles.)

       <b>C)ontrol</b>
              This is a special flag for the control group.  It indicates that the "Newsgroups:"  field  in  the
              article  header  cannot  be  trusted (it does not specify the groups to which the article has been
              posted.)

       <b>D)irectory</b> <b>missing</b>
              This flag indicates that the spool directory for the news group cannot be  found  (the  group  has
              probably  been  removed  with  <u><a href="../man1M/rmgroup.1M.html">rmgroup</a></u>(1M)).  It is set automatically be the <u>nnmaster</u> if it cannot
              access the directory.  When the flag is set, <u>nnmaster</u> completely ignores the group, so it  can  be
              used  to  disable  news collection in specific groups.  If you recreate the group or the directory
              manually, you must also clear this flag to have the <u>nnmaster</u> recognize the group again.

       <b>M)oderated</b>
              Indicates that the group is moderated.  This flag is normally initialized automatically  from  the
              active file, and it should not be changed lightly.

       <b>N)ever_digest</b>
              This  is  the  opposite  of the "always digest" flag; when set, the <u>nnmaster</u> will never attempt to
              split any articles in that group into subarticles.

</pre><h4><b>DATABASE</b> <b>STATISTICS</b> <b>DISPLAY</b></h4><pre>
       When you select the (S)tat operation in the main or master menus, you will get  some  general  statistics
       about the database:

       initialized
              The time when the database was last rebuild using <u>nnmaster</u> -I.

       last_scan, last_size
              The time stamp on the active file and its size the last time the <u>nnmaster</u> read it.

       no of groups
              The total number of groups in the database.

       Articles
              The  total  number  of articles in all groups.  This is not an exact number, because it will count
              split digests as a single article (making the number too small), and it may  count  some  articles
              that have been expired (making the number too large).

       Disk usage
              The total number of (1 kbyte) disk blocks occupied by the database.

</pre><h4><b>MASTER</b> <b>INDEX</b> <b>ENTRIES</b></h4><pre>
       The  master  index entries displayed when you select the (H)eader operation in the master and group menus
       contain the following information:

       <u>group_name</u>  <u>group_number</u>
              The first line of the display will show the name of the group and the internal group number  which
              is used to identify the group in the database.

       first/last art
              This is the numbers of the first and last article that are currently stored in the database.

       active info
              This is the numbers of the first and last article in the news system as read from the active file.
              They  will  normally match the numbers above, but they may differ while the <u>nnmaster</u> is working on
              the group (or it has not yet collected all the articles in the group).

       Offsets: index-&gt;..., data-&gt;...
              These values show the starting position for the next write operation on the index and data  files.
              They  are  primarily used for consistency checking and recovery after a system crash, but after an
              "expire by rewrite" operation (expire method 2) which is performed "in-situ", the data  and  index
              files may physically be longer than the actual data stored in them.

       Flags:
              This  shows  the current flags set for this group.  If no flags are set, the field is omitted from
              the display.  One extra flag which was not explained above is the BLOCKED flag; it is a  temporary
              locking flag set on a group by the <u>nnmaster</u> while it is updating the database files for that group
              to prevent <u>nn</u> clients to access that group.

</pre><h4><b>RAW</b> <b>DATABASE</b> <b>DISPLAY</b></h4><pre>
       When  you  select the (D)ata operation on the group menu, you will get a combined display of the raw data
       and index files for that group.  The index file contains a single 32 bit value for each existing  article
       number.  This value is an offset into the data file pointing to the header for the corresponding article.

       When  <u>nn</u> want to access the article from number N to the last article, it looks up the offset for article
       number N in the index file, and uses this as the starting point for reading article header information in
       the data file.  It then simply reads to the end of the  data  file  in  which  the  article  headers  for
       articles number N+1, N+2, and so on follows immediately after the header for article number N.

       The  article header information is presented in a very terse form; each of the output lines are described
       below for reference purposes:

       offset = <u>xxxx</u>    , article # = <u>nnnnn</u>   (type)
              This shows the offset into the data file and the article number.  The  offset  is  stored  in  the
              index  file  for  quick  access.   If no <u>type</u> is printed it is a normal article.  Other types are:
              "digest header" and "digest sub-article".

       xpost(<u>count</u>):  <u>nnn</u>, <u>nnn</u>, <u>nnn</u>, ...
              Cross-postings to other groups are encoded as a list of internal group numbers.

       ts=<u>nn</u> hp=<u>nn</u> fp=<u>nn</u> lp=<u>nn</u> ref=<u>nn</u>[+Re] lines=<u>nn</u>
              These values are used by <u>nn</u> to sort, present, and access an article:
              <b>ts</b> is the <u>time</u> <u>stamp</u> on the article; it is a simple encoding of the posting date and time found in
              the Date: field.
              <b>hp</b>, <b>fp</b>, and <b>lp</b> are offsets into the file containing the article text: the <u>header</u>  <u>position</u>,  <u>first</u>
              <u>text</u>  <u>position</u>,  and  <u>last</u> <u>text</u> <u>position</u>.  The first will be zero for normal articles, but not for
              articles in a split digest.  The last will be equal to the length of the file for normal articles,
              but not inside digests.
              <b>ref</b> is the number of references on the Reference: line.  If "+Re" follows the number, the  subject
              line contained a "Re:" prefix which has been removed.

       Sender(<u>length</u>): <u>name</u>
              The  name  of the sender in "ready to print" format, i.e. reduced to 16 characters as explained in
              the <u>nn</u> manual.

       Subj(<u>length</u>): <u>subject</u>
              This is the full subject line from  the  article  header  (except  for  Re:  prefixes  in  various
              formats).

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  $db,  $lib,  and  $news  used  below  are synonyms for the DB_DIRECTORY, LIB_DIRECTORY, and the news
       system's lib directories respectively.
       $db/MASTER        Database master index
       $db/GROUPS        News group names in MASTER file order
       $db/DATA/<u>nnn</u>.x    Index file for group number <u>nnn</u>
       $db/DATA/<u>nnn</u>.d    Data file for group number <u>nnn</u>
       $master/GATE      Message channel from <u>nnadmin</u> to <u>nnmaster</u>
       $master/MPID      The process id of the <u>nnmaster</u> daemon.
       $Log              The log file (truncate it regularly!)

       The MASTER file contains a record for each news group, occurring in the same sequence as the group  names
       in  the  GROUPS  file.   The  sequence  also  defines the group numbers used to identify the files in the
       database and in a few other places.

       The GATE file will be created by <u>nnadmin</u> when needed, and removed  by  <u>nnmaster</u>  when  it  has  read  it.
       Therefore,  to  send  a  message  to  the  <u>nnmaster</u> requires that you are allowed to write in the $master
       directory.

</pre><h4><b>WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The GATE file is created with the owner and modes of the user that runs <u>nnadmin</u> which may cause  problems
       if  the  owner  of the <u>nnmaster</u> process (normally "news") is not allowed to read the created GATE file (a
       "umask" of 022 is ok.)  Unless you allow ordinary users to create files in the LIB  directory  where  the
       GATE  file  resides, only the owner of the directory (normally "news") and "root" can use <u>nnadmin</u> to send
       messages to the <u>nnmaster</u>.  However, to send a wakeup signal to the master, anybody can run
            <u>nnmaster</u> -w

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The user interface is completely out of line with the rest of the <u>nn</u> family, and the way to  run  <u>nnadmin</u>
       in  the non-interactive mode is a bit bizarre.  This is not likely to change, because I believe there are
       more important things to do!
