</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Sqsh (pronounced skwish) is short for SQshelL (pronounced s-q-shell), and is intended as a replacement
       for the venerable 'isql' program supplied by Sybase. It came about due to years of frustration of trying
       to do real work with a program that was never meant to perform real work.

       Sqsh is much more than a nice prompt, it is intended to provide much of the functionality provided by a
       good shell, such as variables, aliasing, redirection, pipes, back-grounding, job control, history,
       command substitution, and dynamic configuration. Also, as a by-product of the design, it is remarkably
       easy to extend and add functionality.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options may be used to adjust some of the behavior of sqsh, however a large portion of the
       configuration options are available only through environment variables which may be set at runtime or via
       a .sqshrc file.

       Options may also be supplied in the SQSH environment variable. This variable is parsed prior to parsing
       the command line, so in most cases the command line will override the contents of the variable. Be aware
       that for options which are allowed to be supplied multiple times, such as <b>-c</b>, supplying them both in a
       variable and on the command line will be the same as supplying them multiple times on the command line.

       -a count
           Sets the maximum <u>count</u> of failures (as determined by the <b>$thresh_fail</b> variable) that may occur before
           sqsh will abort. Setting this to 0 indicates that sqsh should not exit on errors. This value defaults
           to 0 and may also be set using the <b>$thresh_exit</b> variable. See section <b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b> for details.

       -A packetsize
           Specifies  the  size  of  the network TDS packets used to communicate with the SQL server. This value
           must be between 512 and 8192, and be a multiple of  512.  Check  your  SQL  Server  configuration  to
           determine supported packet sizes. This value may also be specified at run-time using the <b>$packet_size</b>
           variable.

       -b  Suppress  the  banner  message  upon  startup.  This  is  unnecessary  in cases where stdout has been
           redirected to a file. This option may also be set via the <b>$banner</b> variable.

       -B  Turns off all buffering of stdin, stdout, and stderr. This feature allows sqsh  to  be  run  from  an
           interactive control script such as chat and expect.

       -c [cmdend]
           Internally sqsh provides the command <b>\go</b> to send a batch of SQL to the database and provides a single
           alias, <b>go</b> for this command. Each time <u>cmdend</u> is supplied a new alias for <b>\go</b> is established.

       -C sql
           Causes the <u>sql</u> command to be executed by sqsh, similar to the same behavior exhibited by the -i flag.
           This  <u>sql</u>  statement may not contain double quotes (this limitation may be lifted in a future release
           of sqsh).

       -d severity
           Sets the minimum SQL Server error severity that will be displayed to the user.  The default is 0, and
           valid ranges are from 0 to 22. This may also be set using the <b>$thresh_display</b> variable.  See  section
           <b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b>.

       -D database
           Causes  sqsh  to attempt to start with your database context set to <u>database</u> rather than your default
           database (usually master). This may also be set using the <b>$database</b> variable.

       -e  Includes each command issued to sqsh to be included in the output. This option may also  be  set  via
           the <b>$echo</b> variable (which is unrelated to the <b>\echo</b> command).

       -E editor
           Set the default editor to <u>editor</u>. This may also be set using the UNIX environment variable <b>$EDITOR</b> to
           the name of the editor desired.

       -f severity
           Sets  the  minimum  <u>severity</u>  level  considered  a  failure  by sqsh. This is the same as setting the
           <b>$thresh_fail</b> variable. See section <b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b> for details.

       -G tds_version
           Set the TDS version to use. Valid versions are 4.0, 4.2, 4.6, 4.9.5,  5.0  and  freetds  additionally
           supports  versions  7.0  and 8.0. The specified value is assigned to the variable <b>$tds_version</b>. Input
           validation is not performed by sqsh. However, when an invalid TDS version is specified,  the  default
           version  of  5.0 will be used. After a session is setup, the variable <b>$tds_version</b> will be set to the
           TDS version in effect. The variable will not be available if option -G is not used.  Meant  for  test
           and debugging purposes only.

           TDS  stands  for  Tabular Data Stream and is the communication protocol Sybase and Microsoft uses for
           Client-Server communication.

       -h  Turns off column headers and trailing "(# rows affected)" from batch output.

       -H hostname
           Sets the client hostname as reported in  sysprocesses.  This  may  also  be  set  via  the  <b>$hostname</b>
           variable.

       -i filename
           Read all input from <u>filename</u> rather than from stdin.

       -I interfaces
           When  a  connection  is established to the database, the <u>interfaces</u> file is used to turn the value of
           <b>$DSQUERY</b> into the hostname and port to which the connection will be made, by default this is  located
           in <b>$SYBASE</b>/interfaces.  This flag allows this default to be overridden.

       -J charset
           Specifies  the  character  set to be used on the client side to communicate with SQL Server. This may
           also be set using the <b>$charset</b> environment variable.

       -k keywords
           Specifies a file containing a list of keywords to be used for keyword  tab  completion,  if  readline
           support  has been compiled into sqsh. This file may also be set via the <b>$keyword_file</b> variable, which
           defaults to <b>$HOME</b>/.sqsh_words.

       -K keytab
           Kerberos support. Specify the keytab file name for DCE.

           See the Kerberos Support section below for details.

       -l debug_flags
           If sqsh has been compiled with -DDEBUG, this option may be used to turn on and off debugging options.
           See the <b>$debug</b> variable, below.

       -L var=value
           Sets the value of <b>$var</b> to <u>value</u>. This may be used to set the value of any sqsh variable  even  if  an
           explicit  command  line variable is supplied for setting the variable. The <b>-L</b> flag may be used to set
           the value of non-configuration variables as well.

       -m style
           Changes the current display style to <u>style</u>. Currently supported styles are  <b>horiz</b>,  <b>vert</b>,  <b>bcp</b>,  <b>csv</b>,
           <b>html</b>,  <b>meta</b>,  <b>pretty</b> and <b>none</b>. The current display style may also be set using the <b>$style</b> variable or
           via the <b>-m</b> flag to the <b>\go</b> command.

       -n on|off
           Enables chained transaction mode on connect (if set to on). Chained transaction mode is also known as
           "AutoCommit off" mode.

       -N appname
           Set the application name sqsh uses to identify itself to the SQL server. The application name can  be
           retrieved  from  the  server  using  the  column  <b>program_name</b>  of the master.dbo.sysprocesses table.
           Defaults to <u>sqsh-2.1.7</u>.

       -o filename
           Redirects all output to <u>filename</u> rather than stdout.

       -p  Display performance statistics upon completion of every SQL batch. This option may also be turned  on
           via the <b>$statistics</b> variable, or by supplying the <b>-p</b> flag to the <b>\go</b> command.

       -P [password | -]
           The Sybase <u>password</u> for <u>username</u> required to connect to <u>server</u> (default, NULL). The <u>password</u> may also
           be  set via <b>$password</b>. Supplying a password of '-' causes the password to be read from the first line
           of stdin.

           sqsh takes pains to hide the password from any user trying to view the command line  used  to  launch
           sqsh,  so  using <b>-P</b> should not constitute a security hole.  Alternatively, you can store your default
           password in .sqshrc file which is not readable by anyone other than yourself. (chmod 600 .sqshrc)

       -Q value
           Query timeout value (equivalent to isql's -t option). If set, will timeout a long running query. Maps
           to the <b>$query_timeout</b> variable.

           For example:

               sqsh -SASE1502 -Usa -P -Q30
               ASE1502.sa.master.1&gt; cd tix
               ASE1502.sa.tix.1&gt; select count(*) from E_TIX;
               Open Client Message
               Layer 1, Origin 2, Severity 2, Number 63
               ct_results(): user api layer: internal Client Library error:
                           Read from the server has timed out.
               ASE1502: Query or command timeout detected, command/batch cancelled
               ASE1502: The client connection has detected this 1 time(s).

           See also the <b>$max_timeout</b> variable, which controls the number of times a timeout  may  occur  on  the
           current connection before the session is aborted.

       -r [sqshrc]
           Specifies  an  alternate  <u>.sqshrc</u>  file  to  be  processed, rather than the default.  If no <u>sqshrc</u> is
           supplied following <b>-r</b>, then no initialization files are  processed.  This  flag  <b>must</b>  be  the  first
           argument supplied on the command line, all other instances will be ignored.

       -R server_principal
           Kerberos  support:  Specifies a <u>server</u> <u>principal</u> to use for network (Kerberos) authentication, if the
           server name in the interfaces file differs from the real server name.

           See the Kerberos Support section below for details.

       -s colsep
           Causes the string <u>colsep</u> to be used to delimit SQL column output columns, this defaults to " ".

       -S server | host:port[:filter]
           The name or the address of the Sybase <u>server</u>  to  connect.  The  default  of  this  is  the  external
           environment  variable  <b>$DSQUERY</b>.  If  neither  <b>-S</b> nor <b>$DSQUERY</b> is set then defaults to "SYBASE". This
           value may also be set via the internal variable <b>$DSQUERY</b>. The servername must exist in the interfaces
           or  sql.ini  file.  As  an  alternative  it  is  also  possible  to  specify  the  target  server  as
           <b>host:port[:filter]</b>  where  <u>host</u>  may  also  be  an  IP  address.  Note  that <b>filter</b> may be defined in
           $SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/config/libtcl[64].cfg. For example:

               [FILTERS]
               ssl=libsybfssl.so
               ssl64=libsybfssl64.so

       -t [filter]
           Enables filtering of command batches through an external program, <u>filter</u>, and prior to being sent  to
           the  SQL Server. If <u>filter</u> is not supplied, then <b>$filter_prog</b> is used (default is 'm4 -'). This value
           may also be set via the <b>$filter</b> and <b>$filter_prog</b> variables.

       -T value
           Specifies the login timeout (similar to isql's -l flag). If set specifies the number of seconds  <u>sqsh</u>
           will wait before timing out a login request. Maps to the <b>$login_timeout</b> variable.

       -U username
           The  Sybase <u>username</u> to connect to the database as, this defaults to the username of the user running
           <u>sqsh</u>. The <u>username</u> may also be set via the <b>$username</b> variable.

       -v  Displays the version number, <b>$version</b>, and exits.

       -V [bcdimoqru]
           Kerberos support: Specify the security options to use.

           See the Kerberos Support section below for details.

       -w width
           The maximum output <u>width</u> of a displayed result set, this defaults to your screen width in interactive
           mode.

       -X  Initiates the login connection to the server with client-side password encryption (if supported).  If
           either  SQL  Server  does not recognize this option, or if the version of CT-Lib used to compile <u>sqsh</u>
           does not support this option, then it will be  ignored.  This  option  may  also  be  set  using  the
           <b>$encryption</b> environment variable.

       -y directory
           Specifies  a  SYBASE <u>directory</u> to use other than the value of <b>$SYBASE</b> in order to find the interfaces
           file.

       -z language
           Specifies an alternate <u>language</u> to display sqsh prompts  and  messages.  Without  the  <b>-z</b>  flag,  the
           server's default language will be used. This may also be set using the <b>$language</b> variable.

       -Z [secmech|default|none]
           Kerberos support: Specify the security mechanism to use.

           See the Kerberos Support section below for details.

       args...
           If  sqsh  is run with the <b>-i</b> flag specifying an input file to be processed (rather than initiating an
           interactive session), arguments may be supplied on the command line to be passed to the  input  file.
           These  arguments  may  be  accessed  using  the variables ${0}, ${1}, ... (see the <b>Variables</b> section,
           below, for more information).

   <b>Initialization</b>
       Upon startup, sqsh initializes all internal environment variables, commands, and aliases to their default
       values, it  then  looks  in  the  system-wide  configuration  file,  /etc/sqshrc,  followed  by  a  local
       configuration  file  <b>$HOME</b>/.sqshrc (this may be overridden via the SQSHRC external environment variable).
       If this file is found it is executed just like a script would be using the <b>-i</b> flag.

       The <u>.sqshrc</u> file may contain anything that could normally be typed at the prompt, however  it  should  be
       noted  that at the time this file is read sqsh has yet to establish a connection to the database, however
       most commands that perform database activity, such as <b>\go</b> will attempt to establish a database connection
       when executed (it may also prompt you for a password  if  necessary).   Also,  if  database  activity  is
       required within this startup file, the <b>\connect</b> command (see <b>COMMANDS</b>, below) may be executed.

       After  the  <u>.sqshrc</u> file has been executed, <u>sqsh</u> then parses any command line options (thus any variables
       set in your <u>.sqshrc</u> file may be overridden by command line options). Following that, if <u>sqsh</u>  is  run  in
       interactive mode (i.e. without <b>-i</b> and if stdin is attached to a tty), it then looks for the file provided
       by  the  <b>$history</b>  variable  and  loads the contents of that file into the history buffers. (see <b>BUFFERS</b>,
       below).

       Immediately prior to establishing a connection to the database (either during startup, or by an  explicit
       <b>\connect</b>  or  <b>\reconnect</b> command), the file <b>$HOME</b>/.sqsh_session is executed. The name of this file may be
       overridden using the <b>$session</b> variable.

   <b>Command</b> <b>line</b>
       When a line is first read by <u>sqsh</u>, the first word is separated from the line.  This word is then expanded
       of all variables  (see  <b>Variable</b>  <b>Substitution</b>,  below),  followed  by  command  expansion  (see  <b>Command</b>
       <b>Substitution</b>,  below).  The  first word of the resulting string is then analyzed to see if it is either a
       valid <u>sqsh</u> command or alias.

       The <u>sqsh</u> command line follows many of  the  same  rules  as  Bourne  shell,  allowing  file  redirection,
       pipelining, command substitution, and back-grounding via the same syntax.

   <b>Comments</b>
       Any  line beginning with a <b>#</b> followed by a non-alphanumeric character (any character other than 0-9, a-z,
       A-Z, and _) causes the entire line to be ignored.  Because of the possible collision with  T-SQL  session
       specific  temp-table  names,  the  line  will  not  be ignored if the first character following the <b>#</b>, is
       alphanumeric.

   <b>Quoting</b>
       Quoting is used to prevent the interpretation of special keywords or characters to sqsh, such  as  white-
       space,  variable  expansion,  or  command substitution. There are three types of quoting, <u>escape</u>, <u>single-</u>
       <u>quotes</u>, and <u>double-quotes</u>.

       Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal interpretation of  each  character  contained
       within  the  quotes. A single quote may not appear within single quotes, even when preceded by an escape.
       For example:

           1&gt; \echo I can not expand '$username'

       outputs

           I can not expand $username

       The characters \\ are used to escape the meaning (and thus prevent the interpretation) of  the  character
       immediately following them. The \ character itself may be escaped. For example:

           1&gt; \echo I can\\'t expand '$username'

       outputs

           I can't expand $username

       The  escape  character  may also be used to escape a new-line in order to perform a line continuation, in
       this case the new-line is discarded and the continued line is  automatically  appended  to  the  previous
       line, for example:

           1&gt; \echo Hello \\
           --&gt; World!
           Hello World!

       Enclosing  characters  in  double quotes preserves the literal meaning of all characters within them with
       the exception of <b>$</b>, <b>'</b>, and <b>\\</b>. A double quote may be contained within double quotes by escaping it.

           1&gt; \echo "\\"I can't deny it, I like $username\\", she said"

       prints out

           "I can't deny it, I like gray", she said

   <b>Expansion</b>
       After a line of input has been read, <u>sqsh</u> attempts to expand the  line  of  any  aliases  (see  <b>Aliasing</b>,
       below),  following  that  it attempts to determine if the line begins with a command keyword. Once a line
       has been determined to contain a command name it has three types of expansion performed to  it:  <u>variable</u>
       <u>substitution</u>,  followed  by  <u>command</u>  <u>substitution</u>  respectively. Finally, if a tilde was provided on the
       command line, then <u>tilde</u> <u>expansion</u> will be performed and the <b>~</b> will be substituted with the corresponding
       <b>HOME</b> directory name.

           1&gt; \echo ~sybase/err.log

       may result in <u>/home/sybase/err.log</u> for example.

           1&gt; exec sp_helpdb
           2&gt; go &gt; <a href="file:~/db.log">~/db.log</a>

       may result in a file <u>/export/home/dba/db.log</u> for example, depending on the Unix login and  the  exact  OS
       you  are  using.   Following  this  expansion the command line is separated into words and the command is
       executed.

   <b>Variable</b> <b>Substitution</b>
       The character $ is used to indicate variable substitution or expansion within a word. These variables may
       be assigned values by the <b>\set</b> command like so:

           1&gt; \set name=value

       <u>name</u> may be a character or underscore followed by any combination of characters, digits,  or  underscore,
       and  may  not contain any special characters, such as (') and ("). The restriction on the first character
       being a digit is introduced because SQL allows the representation of money data types as $nn.nn  where  n
       is a digit.

       <u>value</u>  may contain anything, however if it is to include white-space, then it must be quoted (see <b>Words</b> <b>&amp;</b>
       <b>Quoting</b>, above). Note that in order to prevent the expansion of a variable use either single  quotes,  or
       two \'s, like thus:

           1&gt; \echo \\$name
           $name

       Variables may be referenced in one of two ways:

       $variable  In this manner all characters, digits, and underscores are treated as the <u>name</u> of the variable
       until another type of character is reached (either a special character, or  a  white-space).  ${variable}
       The  braces  are required only when <u>variable</u> is followed by a letter, digit, or underscore that is not to
       be interpreted as part of its name. Note that the same effect may be achieved using double quotes.

       It should be noted that because the variables are expanded prior to breaking the command line into words,
       if the contents of the variable contain white spaces, they are treated as significant by the  parser.  In
       the following example:

           1&gt; \set x="1 2 3"
           1&gt; \echo $x

       the  <b>\echo</b> command receives three arguments, "1", "2", and "3", although it looks as if only one argument
       was passed to it. This behavior is consistent with most shells (such as csh, bourne shell, etc.).

   <b>Command</b> <b>Substitution</b>
       <u>Sqsh</u> supports a second form of expansion called <u>command</u> <u>substitution</u>. This form of expansion  substitutes
       a  command  on  the  command  line  with  the  output of the external UNIX command. This expansion may be
       achieved by placing the command line to be executed in back-quotes (`). For example:

           1&gt; \set password=`/sybase/bin/getpwd $DSQUERY`
           1&gt; \echo $password
           ilikepickles

       This example, the external program <b>/sybase/bin/getpwd</b> is  executed  with  the  current  contents  of  the
       <b>$DSQUERY</b>  environment  variable,  the  entire  expression  is  then  replaced  with  the output of <b>getpwd</b>
       <b>(ilikepickles)</b> prior to executing the <b>\set</b> command. By default, the output of the substituted command  is
       first  broken into words according to the contents of the <b>$ifs</b> variable prior to assembling together back
       into the command line. So, by overriding the contents  of  <b>$ifs</b>  you  may  affect  the  behavior  of  the
       substitution process.

       For example:

           1&gt; \set ifs=":"
           1&gt; \echo `echo hello:how:are:you`
           hello how are you

       This mechanism is frequently useful for parsing input files, such as <b><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></b> into fields.

   <b>Input/Output</b> <b>Redirection</b>
       As  with standard Bourne shell (and most other shells, for that matter), a command's input and output may
       be redirected using a special notation interpreted by the shell. The following may appear anywhere on the
       command line, but only redirection that is specified <u>prior</u> to a pipe (|) actually has any effect  on  the
       behavior of internal sqsh commands (refer to <b>Pipes</b>, below).

       &lt;word
           Use  the  file  <u>word</u> as the standard input for the command. Typically very few <u>sqsh</u> commands actually
           read anything from stdin, so this will usually have no effect (see the <b>\loop</b> command).

       [n]&gt;word
           Associate the output of file descriptor <u>n</u> (stdout, by default) with file <u>word</u>. If this file does  not
           exist it is created; otherwise it is truncated to zero length.

       [n]&gt;&gt;word
           Append  the output of file descriptor <u>n</u> (stdout, by default) to file <u>word</u>, creating it if it does not
           exist.

       [m]&gt;&amp;n
           Redirect the output of file descriptor <u>m</u> (stdout by default), to same output as  file  descriptor  <u>n</u>.
           The order in which redirections are specified on the command line is significant, as the redirections
           are evaluated left-to-right.  For example:

               1&gt; select * from select /* syntax error */
               2&gt; \go &gt;/tmp/output 2&gt;&amp;1

           This  statement  first redirects the standard output of the <b>\go</b> command to the file <u>/tmp/output</u>, then
           redirects the stderr to the same file. So, when the commands fails, the error output will be found in
           the file <u>/tmp/output</u>.

           However, by changing the order of redirection, you can completely change the meaning:

               1&gt; select * from select
               2&gt; \go 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/tmp/output
               Msg 156, Level 15, State 1
               Server 'SQSH_TEST', Line 1
               Incorrect syntax near the keyword 'select'.

           In this case, error output will be sent to stdout, while what would have gone to stdout is redirected
           to <u>/tmp/output</u> (in this case <u>/tmp/output</u> will be empty).

       Please read the section on <b>Background</b> <b>Jobs</b>, below, for detailed info  on  the  interaction  between  file
       redirection and background jobs.

   <b>Pipes</b>
       A <u>pipeline</u> is a sequence of one or more commands separated by a '|', each command using the stdout of the
       preceding  program  for  its own stdin. However the first command in the <u>pipeline</u> must be a sqsh command,
       and all other commands must be external (or UNIX) programs.  Any  sqsh  command  may  be  run  through  a
       pipeline,  although  for  many  of them (such as the <b>\set</b> command) it doesn't really make any sense to do
       this. The following is an example of a <u>pipeline</u>:

           1&gt; select * from syslogins
           2&gt; \go | more

       This command causes the result set generated by the <b>\go</b> command to be sent to the <u><b>more</b></u><b>(1)</b> program,  which
       then  sends  it  to  your  screen, pausing at each screen full of data (this is the primary reason that I
       wrote sqsh).

       There are several peculiarities in the way in which sqsh deals with <u>pipelines</u> as opposed to  the  way  in
       which standard Bourne shell treats them.

       Everything  following  the  first occurrence of a pipe (|) character is broken into white-space delimited
       words, including such special shell commands as '2&gt;&amp;1' and other occurrences of pipes. If there  are  any
       variables  contained  in  these  words they are expanded following the same quoting rules as described in
       <b>Words</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>Quoting</b>, above, with the one exception that all quotes are left in place. These  words  are  then
       reassembled into a single string and shipped off to <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> for processing.

       In  short, sqsh makes no attempt to interpret what follows the first pipe, instead it is shipped off to a
       "real" shell to do the work. The rationale behind this is that I was lazy and didn't  feel  like  writing
       all  of  the  same bizarre variable handling, &amp;&amp;'ing, ||'ing, grouping, and variable expansion rules that
       Bourne shell supports, and instead I let Bourne do the dirty work.

       The advantage of this method is that you can do some very complex stuff after the pipeline, such as:

           1&gt; select * from syscolumns
           2&gt; \go | (cd <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>; compress -c &gt; sysolumns.Z)

       Not that I can think of any real reason to do this...but you can if you want to.

   <b>Background</b> <b>Jobs</b>
       Backgrounding provides a mechanism whereby you may run any sqsh  command  as  a  background  process  and
       continue working while it runs. Sqsh offers two types of backgrounding:

       Deferred
           In  this  mode  sqsh  redirects  all output of the background job to a temporary file (located in the
           directory <b>$tmp_dir</b>) while the job is running, so that the output is not intermixed with what you  are
           currently  working  on.  When  the  job  completes you are notified of the process completion and the
           output may be viewed using the <b>\show</b> command.

       Non-Deferred
           This corresponds to the common idea of a background process under UNIX. In this mode  the  output  of
           the  job  is  not  implicitly  redirected for you, and thus may become intermingled with what you are
           currently working. The mode selection you choose is selectable  via  the  <b>$defer_bg</b>  variable  (which
           defaults  to  '1',  or  'On'). Typically the only reason to not use <u>deferred</u> mode is to prevent large
           result sets from filling up your file system.

       To specify that a job be run in the background, simply append a &amp; to the end of the command line, as:

           1&gt; sp_long_arduous_proc 1, 30
           2&gt; \go &amp;
           Job #1 running [xxxx]
           1&gt;

       When sqsh encounters the &amp; on the end of the command line it spawns a child process (with a Unix  process
       id  of  <u>xxxx</u>)  then the child process calls the <b>\go</b>. <b>\go</b> command then establishes a new connection to the
       database (using the current values of the <b>$DSQUERY</b>, <b>$username</b>,  <b>$password</b>  variables)  and  executes  the
       shown  query.  While  the  job is executing the commands <b>\jobs</b>, <b>\wait</b> and <b>\kill</b> may be used to monitor or
       alter a currently running job (see section <b>COMMANDS</b>, below). When any job completes sqsh will  display  a
       notification, such as:

           1&gt; select count(*) from &lt;return&gt;
           Job #1 complete (output pending)
           2&gt;

       When  a  job completes, if it had no output, it is immediately considered terminated and will not show up
       in the current list of running jobs. However if the complete job has pending output, it will continue  to
       be displayed as a running job (with the <b>\jobs</b> command) until a <b>\show</b> is used to display the output of the
       job.   When  you  exit  your  parent  sqsh session and there are background jobs active then a message is
       shown: <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>running</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>or</b> <b>pending</b> <b>job</b> <b>output</b>.  You have to process all the jobs first before  being
       able to exit sqsh.

       There is a known bug with job backgrounding when used in conjunction with pipes, please refer to the <b>BUGS</b>
       section at the end of the manual.

   <b>Buffers</b>
       In  normal  <b>isql</b>  only  two buffers are maintained; the buffer into which you are currently typing, and a
       buffer that contains the last batch executed (this is kept around for when you run 'vi', or 'edit').

       Sqsh maintains several distinct sets of buffers:

       <b>Work</b> <b>Buffer</b>: This buffer corresponds directly to the <b>isql</b> work buffer. It is the buffer  into  which  you
       enter the current batch prior to sending it to the database.

       <b>History</b> <b>Buffer</b>: This is actually a chain of 0 or more buffers (configurable by the <b>$histsize</b> variable) of
       the  last  <b>$histsize</b>  batches  that  have  been  run.  This buffer is only maintained when sqsh is run in
       interactive mode; that is, batches executed using the <b>-i</b> flag, or executed via redirection from the  UNIX
       prompt will not be maintained in history (after all, they are already in a file somewhere).

       If  the  variable <b>$histsave</b> is True (see section <b>SPECIAL</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>) and sqsh is in interactive mode, then
       the current history buffer is written to <b>$HOME</b>/.sqsh_history when you exit. This file is then  read  back
       into sqsh the next time it is started in interactive mode.

       <b>Named</b>  <b>Buffers</b>: At any time during a session the <b>Work</b> <b>Buffer</b>, or any of the <b>History</b> <b>Buffers</b> may be copied
       into a named buffer using the <b>\buf-copy</b> command (see section <b>COMMANDS</b>, below).  These  buffers  are  lost
       when you exit (however you may use the <b>\buf-save</b> command to save named buffers to a file).

       <u>Buffer</u> <u>Short-Hand</u>

       Many  commands  allow  all of these buffers to be referenced in a short-hand fashion, very similar to the
       way that <u><b>csh</b></u><b>(1)</b> references its commands history.  Any of these shorthands may  be  used  for  any  <u>buffer</u>
       parameter described in the <b>COMMANDS</b> section:

       !.  The current work buffer.

       !!  The  last  command  executed  (note,  this  is  not  available in non-interactive mode as it does not
           maintain a history).

       !+  The next available history entry. This is a write-only buffer, so  typically  only  applies  to  such
           commands as <b>\buf-copy</b>.

       !n  Refers  to  history  #n. Each time an entry is written to history it is assigned an increasing number
           from the last entry, with this short-hand you may reference any given history.

       !buf_name
           Just for consistency this is supplied as a reference  to  named  buffer  <u>buf_name</u>,  however  <u>buf_name</u>
           without the leading '!' is also considered correct.

       buf_name
           Refers to the named buffer <u>buf_name</u>.

       <u>Variables</u>

       Variables  may  also  be  contained  within  work buffers. Under these circumstances the variables remain
       unexpanded until the buffer is sent to the database (via the <b>\go</b> command), during  which  time  they  are
       expanded  and  replaced  within  the buffer. This behavior may be altered via the <b>$expand</b> variable.  (see
       <b>Special</b> <b>Variables</b>, below).

       The following is an example of using variables within a buffer:

           1&gt; \set table_name=syscolumns
           1&gt; select count(*) from $table_name
           2&gt; \go

       This is the equivalent of performing the query:

           1&gt; select count(*) from syscolumns
           2&gt; \go

       directly. Typically this feature is useful for reusing large complex <b>where</b> clauses, or long column names.

       Quoting rules apply the same in SQL buffers as they do in command lines. That is, any variables contained
       within double quotes (") are  expanded  and  variables  contained  within  single  quotes  (')  are  left
       untouched. Thus:

           1&gt; select "$username", '$username'
           2&gt; \go

       yields the results

           ---- ---------
           gray $username

       <u>Command</u> <u>Substitution</u>

       As  with  the  command line, the output of UNIX commands may also be substituted within a SQL buffer upon
       execution (once again, only if the <b>$expand</b> variable is set to 1,  or  true).  In  this  circumstance  the
       command  contained  within  back quotes (`) is replaced with its output prior to forwarding the buffer to
       SQL server. For example:

           1&gt; select count(*) from `echo syscolumns`
           2&gt; \go

       Causes the strings 'echo syscolumns' to be replaced  by  the  word  <u>syscolumns</u>  prior  to  executing  the
       command. It should be noted that the contents of the substituted command are only executed at the time of
       the <b>\go</b> command, not when the line of SQL is input.

   <b>Flow-of-Control</b>
       New  with  version  2.0  of sqsh, is the ability to perform basic flow-of-control and functions using the
       <b>\if</b>, <b>\while</b>, <b>\do</b>, and <b>\func</b> commands.

       <u>Blocks</u> <u>&amp;</u> <u>SQL</u> <u>Buffers</u>

       All sqsh flow-of-control commands are block-based. That is, if the test expression of the command is met,
       then a block of sqsh-script will be executed.  For example, the definition of the <b>\if</b> command is:

           \if expression
               block
           \fi

       This <u>block</u> may be any number of lines of sqsh commands, SQL, or flow-of-control statements to be executed
       if the <u>expression</u> evaluates to a success condition (0).

       Each <u>block</u> has its own SQL buffer for the duration that the <u>block</u> is executed.  That  is,  the  following
       statements:

           1&gt; /*
           2&gt; ** IMPROPER USAGE OF IF BLOCK
           3&gt; */
           4&gt; select count(*) from
           5&gt; \if [ $x -gt 10 ]
           6&gt;     sysobjects
           7&gt; \else
           8&gt;     sysindexes
           9&gt; \fi
           5&gt; go

       will yield:

           Msg 102, Level 15, State 1
           Server 'bps_pro', Line 1
           Incorrect syntax near 'from'

       because  the  string 'sysobjects' or 'sysindexes' were inserted into their own SQL buffers. These buffers
       are discarded as soon as the end of the block was reached, and since a  <b>\go</b>  command  was  not  contained
       within the block, no additional errors were generated.

       Thus, the correct way to write the above expression would be:

           1&gt; /*
           2&gt; ** PROPER USAGE OF IF BLOCK
           3&gt; */
           4&gt;  \if [ $x -gt 10 ]
           5&gt;     select count(*) from sysobjects
           6&gt;     go
           7&gt; \else
           8&gt;     select count(*) from sysindexes
           9&gt;     go
           10&gt; \fi

       or, even:

           1&gt; /*
           2&gt; ** PROPER USAGE OF IF BLOCK
           3&gt; */
           4&gt;  \if [ $x -gt 10 ]
           5&gt;     \set table_name=sysobjects
           6&gt; \else
           7&gt;     \set table_name=sysindexes
           8&gt; \fi
           4&gt; select * from $table_name
           5&gt; go

       Also,  note that the line number displayed in the sqsh prompt resets to the current position in the outer
       SQL buffer after reaching the <b>\fi</b> terminator.

       <u>Expressions</u>

       All flow-of-control statements in sqsh take an <u>expression</u> to determine which <u>block</u> of  code  to  execute.
       Just  like UNIX's Bourne Shell, this <u>expression</u> is simply an operating system program that is executed by
       sqsh. If the command returns a success status (calls <u><a href="../man0/exit.0.html">exit</a></u>(0)), then it is considered successful.

       For example, with following statement:

           \while test $x -lt 10
               block
           \done

       will execute the contents of <u>block</u> while the current value of $x is less than 10. Note that 'test'  is  a
       standard  UNIX  program to perform basic string or numeric comparisons (among other things). Also, unlike
       many shells, sqsh has no built-in version of 'test'.

       Sqsh does, however, support the standard short form of 'test':

           \while [ $x -lt 10 ]
               block
           \done

       With this expression the open brace ('[') is replaced by the sqsh parser with 'test', and the close brace
       (']') is discarded.

       <u>Unsupported</u> <u>Expressions</u>

       Currently sqsh does not support the standard shell predicate  operators  '&amp;&amp;'  and  '||'.  These  can  be
       performed like so:

           \if sh -c "cmd1 &amp;&amp; cmd2"
               block
           \done

       \if statement

       The  <b>\if</b>  command  performs  conditional  execution  of a sqsh <u>block</u> based upon the outcome of a supplied
       expression:

           \if expr1
               block1
           \elif expr2
               block2
           \else
               block3
           \fi

       In this example, if expression <u>expr1</u> evaluates to true, then the block <u>block1</u> is evaluated. Otherwise, if
       the expression <u>expr2</u> evaluates to true, then block <u>block2</u> is evaluated. Finally, if all other tests  fail
       <u>block3</u> is evaluated.

       Note  that,  unlike Bourne Shell, every <b>\if</b> command must be accompanies by a trailing <b>\fi</b> statement. Also
       the sqsh parser is not terribly intelligent: The <b>\else</b> and <b>\fi</b> statements must be the  only  contents  on
       the line in which they appear, and they may not be aliased to another name.

       \while statement

       The <b>\while</b> command executes a <u>block</u> of sqsh code for the while a supplied expression remains true.

           \while expr
               block
           \done

       In this example, while the expression <u>expr</u> evaluates to true, then the block <u>block</u> is evaluated.

       The <b>\break</b> statement may be used to break out of the inner-most <b>\while</b> or <b>\for</b> loop (more on <b>\for</b> below).

       \for statement

       The <b>\for</b> command executes a <u>block</u> of sqsh code for each <u>word</u> supplied:

           \for var in word ...
               block
           \done

       For  each  <u>word</u>  supplied,  the  value  of  the variable <b>$var</b> is set to the word and the <u>block</u> of code is
       executed. Execution ends when there are no more words in the list.

       As with <b>\while</b> the <b>\break</b> statement may be used to break out of the inner-most execution loop.

       \do command

       The <b>\do</b> command is kind of a cross between a statement and a command.

       It is a form of <b>\go</b> (see below for details on the <b>\go</b> command) in which a  <u>block</u>  of  sqsh  code  may  be
       executed for each row of data returned from the query. When the <u>block</u> is executed, special sqsh variables
       #[0-9]+  (a  hash  followed  by a number) may be used to reference the values in the returned query.  For
       example the following command:

           select dbid, name from master..sysdatabases
           \do
               \echo "Checkpointing database #2, dbid #1"
               use #2
               go
               checkpoint
               go
           \done

       would cause a CHECKPOINT command to be issued in each database on the server.

       Command line options

       The <b>\do</b> command establishes a new connection to be used by the <u>block</u> of code when executed.  By  default,
       this connection is established to the current server (the current setting of <b>$DSQUERY</b>), using the current
       username  (<b>$username</b>)  and  the  current  password (<b>$password</b>). This behavior may, however, be overridden
       using command line options:

       -D database
           Establishes the connection to the database as the supplied <u>database</u>.

       -U username
           Establishes the connection to the server as the supplied <u>username</u>.

       -P password
           Establishes the connection to the server using the supplied <u>password</u>  (which  is  hopefully  a  valid
           password for the supplied <u>username</u>).

       -S server | host:port[:filter]
           Establishes the connection to the supplied <u>server</u>.

       -n  Do  not  create  a connection for use by the <b>\do</b> loop. This flag is mutually exclusive with the above
           flags. With this flag enabled, attempts to perform database commands within the <u>block</u> will generate a
           flurry of CT-Library errors.

       Column variables

       As mentioned above, the values of the columns in the current result  set  may  be  determined  using  the
       special  #[0-9]+  variables.  Thus,  the  variable #1 would contain the value of column number one of the
       current result set, and #122 could contain the value of the 122'nd column (column numbers begin at 1).

       In the case of nested <b>\do</b> loops, values in previous nesting levels may be referred to by simply appending
       an addition '#' for each previous nesting level, like so:

           select id, name from sysobjects
           \do
               select name, indid from sysindexes where id = #1
               \do
                   \echo "Table ##2 (objid ##1) has index #1"
               \done
           \done

       obviously, this isn't the way you would do this query in real life, but you get the idea.

       When expanding columns with NULL values, the column variable will expand to an empty string  ('').  Also,
       references to non-existent columns, such as #0, will result in an empty string ('').

       As  with regular sqsh variables (those referenced with a '$'), column variables will not be expanded when
       contained within single quotes.

       Aborting

       If the <b>\break</b> or <b>\return</b> commands are issued during the processing of a <b>\do</b> loop, the current query  will
       be canceled, the connection used by the loop will be closed (unless the <b>-n</b> flag was supplied) and the <b>\do</b>
       loop will abort.

       \func command

       The  <b>\func</b>  command  is used to define a reusable block of sqsh code as a function. Functions are defined
       like so:

           \func stats
               \if [ $# -ne 1 ]
                   \echo "use: stats [on | off]"
                   \return 1
               \fi
               set statistics io ${1}
               set statistics time ${1}
               go
           \done

       In this example a new function is established called <u>stats</u> that expects a single argument, either "on" or
       "off". Using this argument, <u>stats</u> will enable or disable time-based and I/O-based statistics.

       Once established, the function may be called like so:

           \call stats on

       Causing all instances of ${1} to be replaced with the first command line argument to <u>stats</u>.

       Command line options

       Currently only one command line argument is available to the <b>\func</b> command.

       -x  Causes the function to be exported as a <u>sqsh</u> command. That is, the function may be  invoked  directly
           without  requiring the <b>\call</b> command. This behavior is optional because command names can potentially
           conflict with T-SQL keywords.  When using this flag it is recommended that you  prepend  a  backslash
           (\) to your function name.

       Function variables

       As  shown  in  the  example above, several special variables are available for use within the body of the
       function. These are:

       $#  Expands to the number of arguments supplied to the function or script when invoked.

       $*  Expands to the complete list of arguments supplied to the function or script when invoked.

       ${0}..${N}
           Expands to positional arguments to the function. ${0} is the name of the function or the script  file
           being  invoked,  ${1}  is the first argument, ${2} the second and so-on, up to argument <u>N</u>. Note that,
           unlike most shells, sqsh requires that function arguments be referred  to  using  the  special  curly
           brace  syntax (${1}, rather than $1). The reason for this is that $1 is a valid MONEY value and using
           the curly braces gets rid of this ambiguity.

       $?  After the invocation of a function, this will contain its return value (see below).

       Return value

       A value may be returned from a function via the <b>\return</b> command.

       Like so:

           \return N

       Where <u>N</u> is a positive value. This return value is available to the caller of  the  function  via  the  <b>$?</b>
       variable. As convention, a return value of 0 is used to indicate a success.

       If  <b>\return</b>  is  not  explicitly called, the default return value is the current value of the <b>$?</b> variable
       (which is set to 0 upon entry of the function).  Thus, if any  SQL  statements  are  invoked  within  the
       function,  the  default  return value of <b>$?</b> will be the last error code returned during the processing of
       the SQL statement.

   <b>Kerberos</b> <b>Support</b>
       Starting with version 2.1.6, <u>sqsh</u> provides the same command line  options  as  <u>isql</u>  to  handle  Kerberos
       network authentication.

       In  version  2.1.5  experimental  Kerberos support was added using the -K and -R options. -K was merely a
       switch to set Kerberos on. In sqsh 2.1.6 a more advanced  implementation  of  network  authentication  is
       introduced, although still experimental.

       By  using  the  parameters  -K,  -R,  -V,  -Z  you can make use of your defined network security settings
       (libtcl.cfg). The named options are identical to the ones defined for <u>isql</u>.

       -K keytab_file
           Keytab_file name for DCE.

       -R server_principal
           Server principal name when servername specified in interfaces differs from the real server name.

       -V [bcdimoqru]
           Specify security options to use with the security mechanism. Each character  stands  for  a  specific
           security service.

       -Z [secmech|default|none]
           Request a security mechanism defined for Kerberos, DCE or PAM in your libtcl.cfg file. Use <b>secmech</b> to
           specify  the  name  of  a SECURITY entry or <b>default</b> for the first available entry in libtcl.cfg. <b>None</b>
           must be specified to disable network authentication or reset possible existing  values  in  variables
           <b>$secmech</b> or <b>$secure_options</b>.

       For  example, connecting to a server using Kerberos (which happens to be the default, i.e. first entry in
       libtcl.cfg [SECURITY] tab in this example):

           ~$ sqsh -SSYB1502 -Uuser1 -RFC6A1502 -Z
           \connect: Network authenticated session expires at:
                   16 Feb 2010 15:28:39 (11764 secs)
           SYB1502.user1.master.1&gt; select @@servername,@@authmech,
                                        show_sec_services();
           ----------------  -----------  ----------------------------------

                                        detectreplay detectseq

       Note that the real name of the server (@@servername) differs from the server name in the interfaces file,
       so we have to specify the principal name through the <b>-R</b> parameter.   When  you  do  not  specify  the  <b>-V</b>
       parameter  together with <b>-Z</b>, all available security options will be enabled. When <b>-V</b> is specified without
       any security service options, only option <b>u</b> for Network Authentication will be  implicitly  set  and  the
       default security mechanism will be used if <b>-Z</b> is not specified.

       When  the  connection  succeeds,  <u>sqsh</u> will store the real name of the security mechanism in the variable
       <b>$secmech</b>. For example: "\echo $secmech" may show <u>csfkrb5</u>. The parameter <b>-V</b> takes  a  list  of  characters
       from  the  possible  values of <u>bcdimoqru</u>. The option <b>u</b> enables Network Authentication, is the default and
       will allways be set when using <b>-V</b> or <b>-Z</b>, specified or not.

       Please check master.dbo.syssecmechs for  available  services.  Non-existing  or  not  supported  services
       supplied  with  <b>-V</b> are silently ignored. If you specify <b>-V</b> and/or <b>-Z</b>, <u>sqsh</u> assumes network authentication
       is tried and no password is required.

       If you have a network authenticated connection and want to \reconnect  using  normal  ASE  authentication
       with username and password, you have to reset the network authentication variables by specifying -Znone

       For example:

           [user1@linux-fc6a ~]$ sqsh -SFC6A1502 -Uuser1 -V
           \connect: Network authenticated session expires at:
                   16 Feb 2010 15:28:39 (10764 secs)
           FC6A1502.user1.master.1&gt; \echo $secmech csfkrb5
           FC6A1502.user1.master.1&gt; \reconnect -SASE1502 -Usa -Psybase
           Open Client Message
           Layer 7, Origin 9, Severity 5, Number 8
           ct_connect(): security service layer: internal security control
                       layer error:
           Consistency checks performed on the credential failed
           (minor status 0).
           FC6A1502.user1.master.1&gt; \reconnect -SASE1502 -Usa -Psybase -Znone
           ASE1502.sa.master.1&gt;

       The  first  \reconnect  fails  because  sqsh  still wants to try network authentication. However, no user
       principal for 'sa' exists and no ticket is set and thus  the  connection  fails.  The  second  <b>\reconnect</b>
       succeeds  as the -Znone option reset appropriate variables.  If the Kerberos ticket is renewed with <b>kinit</b>
       or any other client tool, the <u>sqsh</u> session must perform a <b>\reconnect</b> to refresh the  credentials  and  to
       prevent  a  premature  session  abort. With the command <b>\snace</b> you can request for the session expiration
       interval. Depending on the security services that are set, the database connection may be closed  without
       warning as soon as the ticket expires.

       See  chapter  16  "External Authentication" from the Sybase System Administration Guide volume 1 for more
       information on Kerberos network authenticationi, e.a.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Read-Eval-Print</b>
       The read-eval-print loop is the heart of the sqsh system and is responsible  for  prompting  a  user  for
       input and determining what should be done with it.  Typically this loop is for internal use only, however
       they are open to the user because there are some creative things that can be done with them.

       \loop [-i] [-n] [-e sql] [file]
           The  <b>\loop</b>  command reads input either from a file, a supplied SQL statement, or from a user (see the
           options below), determining whether the current line is a portion of a  T-SQL  statement  or  a  sqsh
           command,  and  performing  the  appropriate  action.  When  run  in an interactive mode <b>\loop</b> is also
           responsible for displaying the current prompt (see <b>$prompt</b> below).

           <b>\loop</b> completes when all input has been depleted (end-of-file is encountered) or when a command, such
           as <b>\exit</b> requests that <b>\loop</b> exit.

           -i  Normally, if <u>file</u> is supplied and does not exist, <b>\loop</b> will  return  with  an  error  condition,
               usually  causing  sqsh to exit. By supplying the <b>-i</b> flag, control will be returned to the calling
               loop as if end-of-file had been reached (that is, with no error condition).

           -n  By default, <b>\loop</b> will automatically attempt to connect to the database if a connection  has  not
               already  been  established  via the <b>\connect</b> command. The <b>-n</b> flag disables this behavior allowing
               <b>\loop</b> to process commands that do not require database support.

           -e sql
               Causes <b>\loop</b> to process the contents of <u>sql</u> as if the user had typed it  at  the  prompt  and  an
               implicit  call to <b>\go</b> is automatically appended to the statement. If multiple instances of <b>-e</b> are
               supplied, they are all sent as a single batch to the SQL Server for processing. This  option  may
               not be used in combination with a <u>file</u> name as well.

           file
               Specifies  the name of a <u>file</u> to be used as input rather than reading input from the user or from
               the <b>-e</b> flag.

       <u>Database</u> <u>Access</u>

       Given the size and complexity of sqsh (just look at the length of this man page), it is amazing  how  few
       database manipulation commands that there actually are. The following are commands that affect or use the
       current database connection:

       \connect [-A packet size] [-c] [-D db] [-G tds version} [-S srv] [-U user] [-P pass] [-I ifile] [-J
       charset] [-K keytab] [-R server_principal] [-n] [-N appname] [-Q query_timeout] [-T login_timeout] [-V
       [bcdimoqru]] [-X] [-z language] [-Z [secmech|default|none]]
           This  command  is  used  primarily  for  internal  use  to establish a connection to a database. If a
           connection is already established it has no effect, however if a connection has not been  established
           and  <b>$password</b> has not been supplied, then the password is requested and a connection is established.
           <b>\connect</b> accepts the following parameters:

           -A  Specifies the size of the network TDS packets used to communicate with the SQL server. This value
               must be between 512 and 8192, and be a multiple of 512. Check your SQL  Server  configuration  to
               determine  supported  packet  sizes.  This  value  may  also  be  specified at run-time using the
               $packet_size variable.

           -c  By default, the <b>\connect</b> command uses the contents of <b>$database</b> to determine the database context
               that should be used upon establishing the connection (this is used by <b>\reconnect</b> to preserve  the
               current database context upon reconnection). The <b>-c</b> flag suppresses this behavior and the default
               database context of login is used instead.

           -D db
               Causes  <b>\connect</b> to attempt to automatically switch the database context to <u>db</u> after establishing
               the connection.

               Using this flag is identical  to  setting  the  <b>$database</b>  variable  prior  to  establishing  the
               connection.

           -G tds version
               Set  the  TDS  version  to  use.  See the global startup parameter -G for more information on TDS
               version.

           -S srv | host:port[:filter]
               The name or address of the Sybase <u>server</u> to connect, this defaults to <b>$DSQUERY</b> if not supplied.

           -U user
               The Sybase <u>user</u> to connect to the database  as,  this  defaults  to  <b>$username</b>  variable  if  not
               supplied.

           -P pass
               The <u>password</u> for <u>user</u> required to connect to <u>server</u>. This defaults to <b>$password</b> if not supplied.

           -I ifile
               The full path of an alternate Sybase <u>interfaces</u> file to use.

           -J charset
               The name of the client character set to communicate with the server.

           -K keytab_file
               Used for DCE user authentication.

           -R principal_name
               Use  for  Kerberos  user authentication to specify the name of the server principal when the name
               differs from the <b>$DSQUERY</b> value.

               See also the discussion on Kerberos support.

           -n  Specifies that the connection must use ANSI compliant chained mode.

           -N appname
               Specify the application name the server will use for program_name in the sysprocesses table.

           -Q query_timeout
               Set a query timeout period in seconds.

           -T login_timeout
               Specifies a maximum wait time for session setup.

           -V [bcdimoqru]
               Security services used for Kerberos support and other security mechanisms.

           -X  Initiates the login connection to the server with client-side password encryption (if supported).
               If either SQL Server does not recognize this option, or if the version of CT-Lib used to  compile
               <u>sqsh</u> does not support this option, then it will be ignored. This option may also be set using the
               <b>$encryption</b> environment variable.

           -z language
               Specifies  an  alternate  language to display sqsh prompts and messages. Without the -z flag, the
               server's default language will be used. This may also be set using the $language variable.

           -Z [secmech|default|none]
               Specifies the security mechanism to use for user authentication. For example csfkrb5 for Kerberos
               support.

       \reconnect [-A packet size] [-c] [-D db] [-G tds version} [-S srv] [-U user] [-P pass] [-I ifile] [-J

       [bcdimoqru]] [-X] [-z language] [-Z [secmech|default|none]]
           The <b>\reconnect</b> command may be used to force a reconnection to the  database  using  a  new  username,
           server  name,  or  password  (if  desired). If this command fails, the current connection remains (if
           there is any), however if it succeeds then the current connection is closed and  the  new  connection
           becomes the only active one.

           All  arguments that are accepted by <b>\connect</b> are also accepted by <b>\reconnect</b> (in fact <b>\reconnect</b> uses
           <b>\connect</b> to establish the new connection).

       \run
           This command will execute a script file like <b>\loop</b> but the <b>\run</b> command will  allow  optional  script
           parameters. Furthermore the command accepts the following parameters.

           -e  Run the script file with echo on.

           -f  Suppress footers.

           -h  Suppress headers.

           -l  Suppres separator lines with pretty output style.

           -n  Disable SQL buffer variable expansion.

           -p  Report runtime statistics.

           -m style
               Specify output style {bcp|csv|horiz|html|meta|none|pretty|vert}.

           -i filename
               Required parameter to specify a filename to be run by <u>sqsh</u>.

           For example: <b>\run</b> <b>-p</b> <b>-i</b> <b><a href="file:~/tmp/runtst.sqsh">~/tmp/runtst.sqsh</a></b> <b>10</b> <b>-m</b> <b>pretty</b>

       \lcd dirname
           Local  Change  Directory.  This command takes a directory name as argument and changes the local SQSH
           context to this directory. You can use <b>\lcd</b> <b>-</b> to return back to the previous directory. If  you  exit
           <u>sqsh</u> then the shell is still in the same directory from where sqsh was started.

       \pwd
           Print Working Directory. Show the name of the current local working directory.

       \ls List  files  in  the  current  directory. Does not take any arguments and is basically a shortcut for
           <b>\shell</b> <b>ls</b>.

       \snace
           Will show the session expiration interval for a network authenticated session,  like  in  a  Kerberos
           enabled session, for example.

       \go [options] [xacts]
           Sends  the contents of the <b>Work</b> <b>Buffer</b> to the database, establishing a new connection to the database
           if one does not already exist (by calling the <b>\connect</b> above). It them displays the  results  of  the
           query  back  to stdout and returns, causing the <b>Work</b> <b>Buffer</b> to be cleared and moved to the end of the
           <b>History</b> <b>Buffer</b>.

           If the <b>Work</b> <b>Buffer</b> is empty and the <b>$repeat_batch</b> variable is set to "On", <b>\go</b> will attempt to re-run
           the last command executed (this will only work in interactive mode if history support is enabled).

           <b>\go</b> accepts the following arguments:

           -d display
               If X11 support is compiled into sqsh, and X display mode is being  used  (see  <b>-x</b>,  below),  then
               <u>display</u>  will  be  used  as  the  X  display  area for the result set. By default the environment
               variable <b>$DISPLAY</b> is assumed.

           -e  Echo the expanded SQL buffer before sending it to the server.

           -f  Turns off the display of the footer message "(%d rows affected)". Footer  messages  may  also  be
               turned off via the <b>$footers</b> variable.

           -h  Turns off all column headers. These may also be turned off via the <b>$headers</b> variable.

           -m style
               Temporarily  changes  the  display  style  to  <u>style</u>  for  the duration of the command. Currently
               supported styles are <b>horiz</b> (or <b>hor</b> or <b>horizontal</b>), <b>vert</b> (or  <b>vertical</b>),  <b>bcp</b>,  <b>csv</b>,  <b>html</b>,  <b>meta</b>,
               <b>pretty</b>  and  <b>none</b>.  The  display  style  may be permanently set via the <b>$style</b> variable or the <b>-m</b>
               command line flag.

           -l  Suppress separator lines when using the <b>-m</b> <b>pretty</b> output style. May also be turned  off  via  the
               <b>$nosepline</b> variable.

           -n  Turns  off variable expansion in the <b>Work</b> <b>Buffer</b> prior to sending it to the server, this may also
               be turned off via the <b>$expand</b> variable.

           -p  Turns on output of performance statistics when the result set has been successfully returned from
               the server. This may also be turned on  via  the  <b>-p</b>  command  line  argument  to  sqsh,  or  the
               <b>$statistics</b> variable.

           -s sec
               If  the  value  of  <u>xacts</u>  is  greater  than  1, this causes sqsh to sleep for <u>sec</u> seconds before
               executing the next  transaction.  Note  that  the  time  spent  sleeping  is  excluded  from  the
               statistical information displayed with the <b>-p</b> flag.

           -t [filter]
               Filters the command batch through an external program, <u>filter</u>, and prior to being sent to the SQL
               Server.  If <u>filter</u> is not supplied, then <b>$filter_prog</b> is used (default is 'm4 -'). This value may
               also be set via the <b>$filter</b> and <b>$filter_prog</b> variables.

           -w width
               Overrides the value of <b>$width</b> for the life of the query (see <b>$width</b> below).

           -x [xgeom]
               Turns on the X11 display filter (only if X11 support is compiled into  sqsh),  which  causes  the
               result set to be sent to a separate window. If <u>xgeom</u> is supplied, then this value will be used as
               <b>$xgeom</b> for the life of the query (see <b>$xgeom</b> below).

           -T xwin_title
               Specify the title name of the X result window to create. This will temporarily override the value
               of <b>$xwin_title</b>. Only useful to specify -T in conjunction with <b>-x</b>.

           xacts
               Specifies number of times the contents of the <b>Work</b> <b>Buffer</b> should be executed.  Note that, similar
               to  isql,  a result set will only be displayed during the final execution of the batch. Also, the
               contents of the <b>Work</b> <b>Buffer</b> are only expanded once, prior to the first execution, so the contents
               of the buffer will not change between subsequent executions.

       \bcp [bcp_options] table[:slicenumber|:partition name]
           The <b>\bcp</b> commands acts as a sort of enhanced <b>\go</b> command that redirects  the  result  set(s)  of  the
           batch to another server via the bcp protocol. While it is possible to <b>\bcp</b> the result set back to the
           current server (the <b>$DSQUERY</b> variable), this is achieved more easily via a SELECT INTO.

           The  nitty-gritty  details  of <b>\bcp</b> go like this: First the current SQL batch is expanded (unless the
           <b>$expand</b> variable is set to 0) and shipped off to the database for processing. If all goes well, a new
           connection is established to the destination database (as specified via <b>$DSQUERY</b> or the <b>-S</b>  flag)  to
           transfer the result set using bcp. Then, the output of the source database connection is bound to the
           new  bcp connection and data transfer is performed.  <b>\bcp</b> can handle multiple result sets without any
           problem (including result sets returned from stored procedures, etc.) provided that all of the result
           sets are valid for the destination table.

           The equivalent of a "bcp out" may  be  performed  using  the  <b>bcp</b>  display  style  setting  and  file
           redirection (see the <b>$style</b> variable).

           -A packet
               Specifies  the  TDS packet size used to communicate with the destination server.  If not supplied
               this defaults to the value the <b>$packet_size</b> variable, or (if that is not set), the default server
               packet size (usually 512 bytes).

           -b batch_size
               The number of records transferred in a single transaction between servers. Note that reaching the
               end of a result causes the batch to be transferred, regardless of the value  of  <u>batch_size</u>.  The
               default is the entire result set.

           -i "&lt;initialization command&gt;"
               Using the <u>-i</u> parameter you can send a SQL command to the target server that will be executed just
               before  the  bulk  copy  operation  is started. This is useful if you need to truncate the target
               table first. For example:

                   1&gt; select * from proddb..materials
                   2&gt; \bcp -SDTA -i "truncate table testdb..materials" -N -X testdb..materials

           -I ifile
               The full path of an alternate Sybase <u>interfaces</u> file to use.

           -J charset
               Specifies the default <u>charset</u> used to communicate with the  SQL  Server.  This  defaults  to  the
               current character set (the value of the <b>$charset</b> variable).

           -m maxerr
               The  maximum number of batches that may fail before <b>\bcp</b> gives up the ghost (default is 10). Note
               that this only refers to failures within a given batch.  When performing a bcp of multiple result
               sets to a server, if a given result set has, say, too many columns or bad data  types,  then  the
               entire bcp process is aborted regardless of the value of <u>maxerr</u>.

           -N  Indicates that the value for an identity column in the destination table is being supplied within
               the result set.

           -P password
               The <u>password</u> for <u>user</u> required to connect to <u>server</u>. This defaults to <b>$password</b> if not supplied.

           -S server | host:port[:filter]
               The name or address of the Sybase <u>server</u> to connect, this defaults to <b>$DSQUERY</b> if not supplied.

           -T  Transfer the data in transit without performing character set conversion at the client side.

           -U user
               The  Sybase  <u>user</u>  to  connect  to  the  database  as, this defaults to <b>$username</b> variable if not
               supplied.

           -X  Causes password negotiation with  the  destination  server  to  be  performed  using  client-side
               encryption.

           -z language
               Specifies the language setting to use.

           table[:slicenumber|:partition name]
               As  with  regular  <b>bcp</b>,  <u>table</u>  may  be  either  a fully or partially specified table name in the
               destination server. Note that since a new database  connection  is  established  during  the  bcp
               processes that the database context of the connection may not be the same as the current context,
               so  it  is  usually safest to fully specify the table name in the form database.owner.table.  For
               partitioned tables you may supply a slicenumber or a partition  name  (separate  table  name  and
               partition with a colon (:)) to bcp the data into the specified partition.

       \rpc [rpc_opt] rpc_name [[parm_opt] [@var=]value ...]
           The  <b>\rpc</b>  command  is  used to directly invoke a stored procedure call in the connected server. This
           command is particularly useful for communicating with an Open Server that does not  directly  support
           language calls.

           <b>\rpc</b> invokes the remote procedure <u>rpc_name</u> with one or more parameters that may be named (using <u>@var</u>)
           or  anonymous (by not supplying a name).  Unfortunately, due to the fact that Sybase's implementation
           of RPC's, does not directly support most implicit data type conversions (mainly between VARCHAR  (the
           string  you  supply  on the command line) and the most other data types (that the remote procedure is
           expecting), the syntax for the <b>\rpc</b> command is somewhat complex. However, in short here is how things
           work:

           As the <b>\rpc</b> command line is being parsed, <u>sqsh</u> attempts to guess the data type of the parameter <u>value</u>
           based on the format (for example if it contains only digits, it is assumed to be  an  integer),  <u>sqsh</u>
           then  performs  an  explicit data type conversion prior to calling the remote procedure call. If <u>sqsh</u>
           guesses wrong, several flags are supplied to force it to perform the  correct  data  type  conversion
           (see <b>parm_opt</b>).

       <u>Display</u> <u>Options</u>

       The  following  options may be supplied anywhere on the command line and are used to affect the manner in
       which the result set(s) returning from the remote procedure call are displayed:

       -d display
           If X support is compiled into sqsh, the value of <u>display</u> is used as the X windows  DISPLAY  variable.
           Note, this is usually supplied with the <b>-x</b> flag, below.

       -f  Turns  off the display of the footer message "(%d rows affected)". Footer messages may also be turned
           off via the <b>$footers</b> variable.

       -h  Turns off all column headers. These may also be turned off via the <b>$headers</b> variable.

       -m style
           Temporarily changes the display style to <u>style</u> for the duration of the command.  Currently  supported
           styles  are  <b>horiz</b> (or <b>hor</b> or <b>horizontal</b>), <b>vert</b> (or <b>vertical</b>), <b>bcp</b>, <b>csv</b>, <b>html</b>, <b>meta</b>, <b>pretty</b> and <b>none</b>.
           The display style may be permanently set via the <b>$style</b> variable or the <b>-m</b> command line flag.

       -r  Request to recompile the procedure prior to execution.

       -w width
           Temporarily sets the output width to <u>width</u>. The output width may be permanently set  via  the  <u>$width</u>
           variable.

       -x [xgeom]
           Sends  output to a separate X window. If <u>xgeom</u> is supplied, then the X window uses this geometry (see
           <b>$xgeom</b> for details).

       -T xwin_title
           Specify the title name of the X result window to create. This will temporarily override the value  of
           <b>$xwin_title</b>. Only useful to specify -T in conjunction with <b>-x</b>.

       <u>Parameter</u> <u>Options</u>

       The  following  options may be supplied immediately prior to specifying a parameter <u>value</u> and are used to
       affect the way in which <u>sqsh</u> interprets the contents of the <u>value</u> prior to calling the remote  procedure.
       Although  <u>sqsh</u>  will allow any combination of these parameters to be combined, it only really makes sense
       to combine the <b>-x</b> flag with any other flag.

       -b  Indicates that the <u>value</u> that is specified should be converted to VARBINARY before calling  <u>rpc_name</u>.
           This  flag  is  implicit  (i.e.  you  need not supply it) if <u>value</u> starts with "0x" and contains only
           digits.

       -c  Indicates that the <u>value</u> that is specified should be converted to VARCHAR prior to calling  <u>rpc_name</u>.
           This  flag  is  implicit  if  <u>value</u> does not match any of the implicit conversions for the other data
           types.

       -d  Indicates that the <u>value</u> that is specified should be  converted  to  double  (float)  before  calling
           <u>rpc_name</u>.  This  flag is implicit if <u>value</u> is in valid floating point notation (e.g. 0.1, .1, 1.4e10,
           or 4e10).

       -i  Indicates that the <u>value</u> that is specified should  be  converted  to  integer  (int)  before  calling
           <u>rpc_name</u>. This flag is implicit if <u>value</u> contains only digits (and, optionally, a leading sign).

       -y  Indicates that the <u>value</u> that is specified should be converted to money before calling <u>rpc_name</u>. This
           flag is implicit if <u>value</u> begins with a "$", and contains only digits and, optionally, a decimal.

       -n  Indicates  that  the  <u>value</u> that is specified should be converted to numeric before calling <u>rpc_name</u>.
           This flag is never implicit, as <u>value</u> would always match either int (<b>-i</b>) or float (<b>-d</b>); however, both
           of these types will implicitly be converted to a numeric as necessary by the procedure call.

       -u  Indicates that <u>value</u> should be ignored and treated as a NULL value, This flag is implicit if <u>value</u> is
           "".

   <b>Buffers</b>
       The following commands may be used to create, destroy, or manipulate the various buffers described in the
       <b>BUFFERS</b> section, above.

       \clear
           The <b>\clear</b> command will discard the current buffer and in contradiction with the <b>\reset</b> command, will
           not save the current buffer to the history. When sqsh is compiled with readline support, this command
           will also clear the screen.  (as ^l does.) The alias <b>clear</b> is automatically established upon startup.

       \history [-i] [-x count]
           Displays the last <b>$histsize</b> batches that have either been sent to the database via the <b>\go</b> command or
           cleared from the <b>Work</b> <b>Buffer</b> via the <b>\reset</b> command. With option <b>-i</b> also display the number of  times
           the buffer is used and the last time the buffer was used. This information may be of special interest
           when  using  the  <b>$histunique</b>  feature.  The  <b>-x</b> option may specify the number of most recent history
           entries to display instead of the total list of history entries.

       \hist-load [filename]
           Load a history file and append items to the current history list.  Use <b>$history</b>  if  no  filename  is
           specified as a parameter.

       \hist-save [filename]
           Will  save  the  current  history  buffers  to  the  <b>$history</b>  file or to the filename specified as a
           parameter.

       \redraw
           Returns a request back to the current read-eval-print loop for  it  to  redisplay  the  current  <b>Work</b>
           <b>Buffer</b>. If run from non-interactive mode, this command has no effect.

       \reset
           The <b>\reset</b> command corresponds directly to the <u>isql</u> 'reset' command, returning a request to the read-
           eval-print  loop  to  clear  the  contents  of  the  current  <b>Work</b>  <b>Buffer</b> and, if you are running in
           interactive mode, place  a  copy  of  the  buffer  into  the  <b>History</b>  <b>Buffer</b>.  The  alias  <b>reset</b>  is
           automatically established upon startup of <u>sqsh</u> for backward compatibility with <u>isql</u>.

       \buf-append dst-buffer [src-buffer]
           Appends  the  contents of <u>src-buffer</u> (defaults to !.) to the contents of <u>dst-buffer</u>, if it exists. If
           <u>dst-buffer</u> doesn't exist it is created.

       \buf-copy dst-buffer [src-buffer]
           Copies the contents of <u>src-buffer</u> (defaults to <b>!.</b>, the <b>Work</b> <b>Buffer</b>, if not supplied), to  <u>dst-buffer</u>.
           Refer to <b>BUFFERS</b> for information on buffer naming conventions.

       \buf-del [buffer|range]
           Remove  a  history  buffer from the history list. You can also specify a range list consisting of the
           first and last buffer numbers separated by a '-'. For example: "\buf-del 1-10" will delete the  first
           10  history  entries. Another example, "\buf-del 21" will only delete buffer number 21. Note that the
           history buffers will be renumbered consecutively.

       \buf-edit [-r read-buf] [-w write-buf]
           The <b>\buf-edit</b> command is used to edit the contents of a buffer and place  the  changes  into  another
           buffer.  This command may only be run while in interactive mode. If <u>read-buf</u> is not supplied then the
           buffer to be edited defaults to !., if it is not empty, otherwise it defaults to !!. If <u>write-buf</u>  is
           not supplied then the edited buffer is written back to !..

           By  default,  <b>\buf-edit</b> uses the environment variable <b>$EDITOR</b> first, followed by <b>$VISUAL</b> to determine
           which editor to use, defaulting to 'vi' if the variable is not set.

           It is important to note that as of release 1.2, <b>\buf-edit</b> is no longer able to use  the  name  of  an
           alias  to it as the name of the editor to launch. This is primarily due to the change in the behavior
           of alias (see section <b>Aliasing</b>, below, for details).

           The commands <b>edit</b> <b>vi</b> and <b>emacs</b> are automatically  established  upon  startup  of  <u>sqsh</u>  for  backward
           compatibility with <u>isql</u>.

       \buf-get buffer
           The  <b>\buf-get</b>  command is supplied as a shorthand method of running <b>\buf-copy</b> It is the equivalent of
           running:

               \buf_append !. buffer

       \buf-load [-a] filename [dst-buffer]
           Copies the contents of <u>filename</u> in <u>dst-buffer</u> (defaults to !.). If  the  <b>-a</b>  flag  is  supplied,  the
           contents  of  <u>filename</u> are appended to <u>dst-buffer</u>. Note that it is illegal to attempt to write to the
           contents of the history buffer.

       \buf-save [-a] filename [src-buffer]
           Saves the contents of <u>src-buffer</u> (defaults to !.) to  <u>filename</u>.  If  the  <b>-a</b>  flag  is  supplied  the
           contents are appended to <u>filename</u> rather than overwriting the current contents.

       \buf-show [buffer]
           Displays  the contents of the named <u>buffer</u>. If <u>buffer</u> is not supplied, then the contents of all named
           buffers are displayed. This command is slightly different from the commands above in that it is  only
           legal to supply a <b>Named</b> <b>Buffer</b> <u>buffer</u>, <b>History</b> <b>Buffers</b>, and the <b>Work</b> <b>Buffer</b> will have no results.

   <b>Variables</b>
       The  following  command(s)  are  used  to  manipulate  the contents of internal variables and environment
       variables.

       \set [-x] [name=<u>value</u> ...]
           If no arguments are supplied to <b>\set</b>  then  the  current  values  of  all  variables  are  displayed.
           Otherwise  the  variable  <u>name</u>  is  set  to  <u>value</u>.  Note  that  some internal variables (see <b>SPECIAL</b>
           <b>VARIABLES</b>) may only be set with certain <u>value</u>s,  so  this  action  may  fail,  leaving  the  previous
           contents  on  <u>name</u>  intact.  The <b>-x</b> flag causes the variable to be exported to the environment of any
           programs launched from <u>sqsh</u>.

   <b>Job</b> <b>Control</b>
       The following commands are used to view the status of, or manipulate background jobs that  are  currently
       running, these correspond roughly to the commands supplied by such shells as <u><b>csh</b></u><b>(1)</b>.

       \jobs [-i]
           Displays  the  status of any currently running jobs, including whether or not these jobs have pending
           output, how long they have been running, and when they were started. The <b>-i</b>  option  will  show  some
           additional job information. Note that the total run time of the job is determined from the moment the
           job  is  marked  complete  by the read-eval-print loop when polled, not when it actually ended and is
           flagged as terminated by the signal handler.

       \wait [job_id]
           Will pause until job designated by <u>job_id</u> completes. If <u>job_id</u> is a negative number then  <b>\wait</b>  will
           pause  until <u>any</u> pending jobs completes. If there are no jobs pending, or <u>job_id</u> does not belong to a
           running job, then an error message is displayed. Note that if multiple jobs are running, and a  <b>\wait</b>
           is  issued  for  one of them, the other jobs may not automatically get signaled when completed within
           the wait period of the specific job. The other jobs may need to get signaled with a <b>\wait</b> <b>-1</b> as  well
           to be noticed complete by <u>sqsh</u>.

       \kill job_id
           Terminates the job specified by <u>job_id</u>, throwing away any output that may be deferred for the job. If
           <u>job_id</u> is not a running job then an error message is displayed.

       \show job_id
           Displays  the deferred output of completed background job <u>job_id</u> and removes the job from the list of
           pending jobs (removing the defer file in the process).  If <u>job_id</u> is still running, or is not a valid
           complete job, then an error message is displayed. You may need to issue a <b>\wait</b> <b>job_id</b> first, to  get
           notified of actual job completion.

   <b>Aliasing</b>
       As  of  release  1.2,  <u>sqsh</u>  supports full <u>csh</u>-style command aliasing. With this feature, <u>sqsh</u> checks the
       first word of each line, <u>prior</u> <u>to</u> <u>any</u> <u>form</u> <u>of</u> <u>expansion</u>, to see if it matches the  name  of  an  existing
       alias.  If  it does, the command is reprocessed with the alias definition replacing its name. Unlike <u>csh</u>,
       however, only one form of history substitution is available within an alias: the '<b>!*</b>'  entry,  indicating
       the current line being expanded. If no history expansion is called for, the arguments on the command line
       remain unchanged.

       Like  <u>csh</u>, aliases are not recursively expanded, so it is perfectly legal to create an alias that expands
       to a command by the same name.

       The following command is used to create an alias:

       \alias [alias_name=alias_body]
           If no arguments are supplied to the <b>\alias</b> command, then the list of aliases currently in  effect  is
           displayed.  Otherwise,  it creates a new alias with a name of <u>alias_name</u> and a body of <u>alias_body</u>; if
           <u>alias_name</u> already exists, the body of the existing <u>alias_name</u> is replaced with the new definition.

           After defining the new alias,  whenever  <u>sqsh</u>  encounters  a  line  beginning  with  <u>alias_name</u>,  the
           remainder of the line is replaced with <u>alias_body</u> before any further processing is performed.

           If  the  string  '<b>!*</b>'  exists  anywhere  within  <u>alias_body</u>,  the arguments supplied to the alias are
           inserted at that point, otherwise the argument are appended to the end of the alias  definition.  For
           example:

               1&gt; \alias hi='\echo !* said hello'
               1&gt; hi Scott
               Scott said hello

           where as if the alias does not include the <b>!*</b> keyword, then it behaves like so:

               1&gt; \alias hi='\echo said hello'
               1&gt; hi Scott
               said hello Scott

           It is perfectly legal to include a <b>!*</b> more than once within a given <u>alias_body</u>. Currently there is no
           way to escape the string <b>!*</b>, if you really need this feature send me mail.

       \unalias alias_name
           Removes <u>alias_name</u>.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b>
       The left over commands.

       \exit [x]
           The  <b>\exit</b>  command  requests  that current read-eval-print loop cease processing. When the last loop
           returns, <u>sqsh</u> <u><b>exit</b></u><b>(1)</b>s. You may specify a exit code as parameter which will be stored in  <b>$exit_value</b>
           and will be used as return value to the shell upon exit of <u>sqsh</u>. (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 255).

       \abort
           Causes  all nested read-eval-print loops to abort processing, causing <u>sqsh</u> to exit with an exit value
           of 254 (see section <b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b>).

       \read [-a] [-n] [-h] var_name [&lt; filename]
           Reads a line of input from the user, placing the text of the line in the variable <u>var_name</u>. If the <b>-n</b>
           is used, then the trailing new-line is left on the line of text, and if <b>-a</b> is supplied, then the text
           of the line is appended to the existing value of <u>var_name</u>. The <b>-h</b> flag turns  off  echoing  of  typed
           characters  back  to  the  user. It is also possible to read the contents of a file using the <u>\&lt;</u> file
           redirection notation.

       \sleep seconds
           Causes <u>sqsh</u> too pause for <u>seconds</u>. This is useful within scripts  of  batches  which  need  to  pause
           briefly between batches (it was primarily useful to me for testing background jobs).

       \echo [-n] [args ...]
           Just  like  the  UNIX <u><b>echo</b></u><b>(1)</b>, this prints its arguments to stdout, followed by a new-line. If the <b>-n</b>
           flag is supplied, the newline is omitted.

       \warranty
           Displays the standard GNU warranty.

       \help [command]
           Without any arguments <b>\help</b> displays a brief list of all available commands, otherwise,  it  provides
           specific  help  for  <u>command</u>, if available. When help is requested on a specific <u>command</u>, <b>\help</b> looks
           for the file <u>$help_dir/command.hlp</u> and displays it to stdout.

       \shell [shell command]
           If <u>shell</u> <u>command</u> is not supplied then <u>sqsh</u> executes <b>$SHELL</b>. If the <b>$SHELL</b> variable has not been  set,
           then,  by default, <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> is executed.  Otherwise, if <u>shell</u> <u>command</u> is supplied then it is executed.
           The exit status of the command executed is stored in the special <b>$?</b> read-only environment variable.

       \lock
           Locks the current session until the correct password is typed. By default <b>\lock</b> attempts to  use  the
           UNIX  password  (from  <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a>  or <a href="file:/etc/shadow">/etc/shadow</a>) associated with the user running <u>sqsh</u> (if sqsh is
           linked with the crypt library), however if the <b>$lock</b> variable is set then the  contents  of  that  is
           used for validation instead.

   <b>Aliases</b>
       The  following  aliases  are  established  upon  startup of <u>sqsh</u>, and are provided primarily for backward
       compatibility with <u>isql</u>. These may be removed at any time using  the  <b>\unalias</b>  command  (either  at  the
       prompt, or within your .sqshrc file).

       !   The  <b>!</b>  alias  is  provided  as a <u><b>csh</b></u><b>(1)</b>-like history mechanism, and is an alias of <b>\buf-append</b>. With
           release 0.7, this alias is provided only for backwards compatibility with previous releases of  <u>sqsh</u>.
           See  <b>SPECIAL</b>  <b>VARIABLES</b>,  <b>$history_shorthand</b>  for  details  on  the  new shorthand mechanism (the new
           shorthand more closely resembles that of <b>csh</b>).

       clear
           An alias for the <b>\clear</b> command, which causes the contents of the current work buffer to  be  cleared
           and discarded. Also the screen will be cleared if readline is compiled into <u>sqsh</u>.

       reset
           An  alias  for the <b>\reset</b> command, which causes the contents of the current work buffer to be cleared
           and copied to history (if in interactive mode).

       exit [x]
       quit [x]
           An alias for the <b>\exit</b> <b>[x]</b> command, causes the current read-eval-print loop to complete.

       edit
       vi
       emacs
           These are provided as aliases for the <b>\buf-edit</b> command. See <b>COMMANDS-Buffers</b> for information on  the
           interactions between <b>\buf-edit</b> and aliases.

       go  Provided as an alias for the <b>\go</b> command (for obvious reasons).

       help
           An alias for the <b>\help</b> command.

       <u>In-Line</u> <u>\go</u>

       If  the  variable  <b>$semicolon_hack</b>  is  set  to  1 (on), then sqsh supports what is called an in-line <b>\go</b>
       feature. This allows the current command batch to be terminated and sent to the database in a single step
       by appending a ';' onto the end of the current work buffer. This allows

           1&gt; sp_who;

       To behave in the same manner as if you had typed:

           1&gt; sp_who
           2&gt; \go

       Likewise, anything following the semicolon is passed to the <b>\go</b> command just as if it was run as a normal
       command:

           1&gt; sp_who ; 2&gt;/dev/null | more

       Unlike most other <u>isql</u> replacements, <u>sqsh</u> attempts to be smart about the semicolons. If  a  semicolon  is
       contained  within  a  set  of  single or double quotes it will not be interpreted. This includes multiple
       quotes. For example:

           1&gt; select "This is a multiple line
           2&gt; quote; it is smart!" ;

       In the above example, only the second semicolon (the one at the end of the  line)  will  be  interpreted.
       The  variable  <b>$semicolon_cmd</b>  is  a  string  that  contains  the command that will be substituted by the
       semicolon which is <b>\go</b> by default. But you can change that to <b>\bcp</b> for example and execute:

           1&gt; select * from pubs2..titles; -S... tempdb..titles

       In sqsh-2.2.0 you can also set variable <b>$semicolon_hack2</b> to allow multiple commands on  one  line  to  be
       fired  by  a  semicolon.  If  this  option  is  set you cannot use the construct above to pass additional
       parameters to the <b>\go</b> command. But of course you can change <b>$semicolon_cmd</b> to your needs as this  command
       will be used to execute SQL batches.

           echo "exec sp_who;exec sp_helpdb;\echo Done;" | sqsh -S... -U... -P...

       In  this  example the semicolon acts as a <b>\go</b> command to a SQL buffer and as a command separator for sqsh
       commands  that  will  be  executed  in  sequence.   Note  that  <b>$semicolon_hack2</b>  takes  precedence  over
       <b>$semicolon_hack</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  several options that are configurable via the command line options to <u>sqsh</u>, however these are
       by no means complete. There are many aspects of <u>sqsh</u>'s behavior that may  only  be  modified  by  setting
       special variables. (In fact, the command line options really only set these variables for you).

   <b>Variable</b> <b>Data</b> <b>types</b>
       Next  to all of the variables that follow is the type of data with which they may be set. Any attempts to
       set the variable with a type of data that it does not accept will fail.

       string
           Any sequence characters.

       boolean
           A positive <u>boolean</u> value may be represented as either "True", "Yes", "1", or "On" (case  insensitive)
           and  a  negative boolean value may be represented as "False", "No", "0", or "Off" (case insensitive).
           However, internally the value of the variable will always be represented as either a "1" or "0".

       path
           Must be the <u>path</u> name that is readable by the <u>sqsh</u> program.

       int Must be one or more digits. Note that some variables also restrict the range of the integer.

       date-spec
           This is a string of the format used to specify dates and  times  for  the  <u><b>date</b></u><b>(1)</b>  command,  or  the
           <b><a href="../man3C/strftime.3C.html">strftime</a>(3C)</b>  and <b><a href="../man3C/cftime.3C.html">cftime</a>(3C)</b> standard C library functions. For example '%H:%M:%S' specifies a time of
           hours in 24 hour format, followed by a colon, followed by minutes, followed by a colon,  followed  by
           seconds.

       float-format
           A  string  of  the  format  <b>p.s</b>,  where <b>p</b> is the total precision of a floating point value (the total
           number of digits to be displayed, including those following the decimal) and <b>s</b> is the  scale  of  the
           value (the total number of digits following the decimal to be displayed).

       <u>Variables</u>

       The  following  variables  have special meanings within <u>sqsh</u> and the setting of these variables alter the
       behavior of the shell.

       $? (int)
           This read-only variable may contain the following return value:

           •   The most recent error number returned from the SQL Server  (@@errno)  of  severity  &gt;  10  (above
               informational messages).

           •   The exit value of a previously executed pipe command.

           •   The return value of the most recently executed sqsh function.

           •   The result of the last executed \if statement:

               0 - The test evaluated to True.
               1 - The test evaluated to False.
               2 - There was an error in the test specification.
       $# (int)
           Contains the number of arguments passed into the sqsh function or script.

       $* (string list)
           Expands to the complete list of arguments supplied to the function or script when invoked.

       ${0}...${N} (int)
           Used  to  reference  positional  function  arguments. Argument ${0} is the name of the function being
           called, ${1} is the first argument, etc.

       $$  Expands to the process ID of the current running sqsh session.

       DISPLAY
           May contain the name of the DISPLAY the X-server uses to put the XWindows result  window  when  using
           <b>\go</b> <b>-x</b>. Defaults to the <u>$DISPLAY</u> shell environment.

       appname
           Contains the name <u>sqsh</u> uses to identity itself to the server. Defaults to sqsh-2.1.7. The application
           name can be retrieved from the sysprocesses table like:
               select program_name from master.dbo.sysprocesses where spid=@@pid;

       autouse (string)
           Note: the meaning of this variable has been deprecated.

           If  <b>$autouse</b>  is set, and the <b>$database</b> variable has not been set, then this variable causes <b>\connect</b>
           to perform a "use <b>$autouse</b>" once a connection has been established.

           This variable may also be set using the <b>-D</b> command line option.

       banner (boolean)
           Turns off the banner message displayed on startup, this variable defaults to 1 and may also be turned
           off using the <b>-b</b> command line argument.

       batch_failcount (int)
           This internal variable is used to keep track of the number of batches that  have  failed  to  execute
           (essentially, the number of times that the error handler was called).

           A  batch  is  considered  failed  whenever  an  error  of  severity <b>$thresh_fail</b> is encountered. When
           <b>$batch_failcount</b> reaches <b>$thresh_exit</b> <u>sqsh</u> exits with an exit value of the total  number  of  batches
           that have failed. Setting <b>$batch_failcount</b> to the string "" will cause it to reset to zero, any other
           value may have unpredictable results.

           See <b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b> for details.

       batch_pause (boolean)
           Causes  a  "Paused.  Hit  enter to continue..." message to be displayed after each batch is executed.
           This variable, in conjunction with <b>$echo</b> is good for debugging SQL  scripts  specified  with  the  <b>-i</b>
           option.

       bcp_colsep (string)
           Used  as  a  separator between columns during BCP style output (see the <b>$style</b> configuration variable
           and the <b>-m</b> option to the <b>\go</b> command). The default setting is "|".

       bcp_rowsep (string)
           Used as a separator between rows during BCP style output (see the <b>$style</b> configuration  variable  and
           the  <b>-m</b>  option to the <b>\go</b> command). Note that, a newline ("\n") is automatically appended and should
           not be supplied.  The default setting is "|".

       bcp_trim (boolean)
           Controls whether or not BCP style output trims trailing spaces from fixed length columns. The default
           is "True".

       builddate (none)
           Read only variable specifying the date when the <u>sqsh</u> executable was compiled.

       buildtime (none)
           Read only variable specifying the time when the <u>sqsh</u> executable was compiled.

       chained (boolean)
           If set then sqsh uses the "chained" transaction mode (aka "AutoCommit off").   Setting  this  has  NO
           effect on the current connection. It can be set via the command line argument <b>-n</b>.

       charset (string)
           If  this  variable  is  set  prior  to  establishing  a  connection  with SQL Server, then during the
           connection <u>sqsh</u> will request that the server transform to  and  from  the  requested  <u>charset</u>.  After
           establishing a connection, this variable is automatically set to the current character set in use.

       clear_on_fail (boolean)
           Normally,  whenever  the  <b>\go</b>  command  is  run, <u>sqsh</u> clears the current work buffer of its contents,
           moving them to history. Setting <b>$clear_on_fail</b> to 0, leaves the  current  work  buffer  intact  if  a
           failure is encountered while sending the contents to the database. The default value is 1, or on.

       colsep (string)
           Causes  the  string  <u>colsep</u> to be used to delimit SQL column output columns, this defaults to " ", it
           may also be set via the command line argument <b>-s</b>.

       colwidth (int)
           Used to control the maximum column width displayed by the <b>pretty</b> display style (see <b>$style</b> below). If
           a row of a column exceeds this width, it will be wrapped in a relatively visually appealing manner at
           <b>$colwidth</b> characters.  Note, however, that if there is  enough  screen  width  to  hold  all  columns
           <b>$colwidth</b> may be exceeded until the width of the screen is reached.

       database (string)
           If  this  variable is set prior to establishing a connection to the SQL Server, the a "use <b>$database</b>"
           is performed immediately after the connection is established. Once a connection has been  established
           this variable will automatically be set to the current database context.

       date (date-spec)
           This  variable may be set with a date format (see the man page for <u><b>date</b></u><b>(1)</b>), and the variable expands
           to the current date in the supplied format. The default format for this variable  is  %d-%b-%y  (e.g.
           02-Feb-1996).

       datefmt (date-spec)
           This  variable  may  be  set  with  a date format similar to <b>$date</b> and is used to control the display
           format of all SQL Server DATE columns. (Similar to <b>$datetime</b>.) Note that only 63 bytes are  available
           in total for the expanded string and the remainder will be truncated.

       datetime (date-spec)
           This  variable  may  be  set with a date format similar to <b>$date</b> and <b>$time</b> and is used to control the
           display format of all SQL Server DATETIME, BIGDATETIME and SMALLDATETIME columns. Note that  only  63
           bytes are available in total for the expanded string and the remainder will be truncated.

           Note  that this features relies upon the operating system specific locale information and the setting
           of <b>$localeconv</b> for determining such things as the name of  the  month  and  day,  rather  than  going
           through  the  CT-Lib locale information. This means that the date format could potentially miss-match
           the locale as requested using the <b>-z</b> flag. For example,  if  <u>sqsh</u>  is  run  on  an  operating  system
           configured  for  US  English,  but  requests  French  as  the language of choice using <b>-z</b>, the use of
           <b>$datetime</b> will cause all date information to be displayed in US English rather than French.

           Ordinary characters defined in the variable are left in  place  without  any  conversion.  Characters
           introduced  by  a  '%'  character  are  replaced  during  display  of a column value according to the
           definitions in the <b>strftime</b> manual page.

           []  Any contained  between  a  pair  of  braces  ('['  and  ']')  will  be  removed  when  displaying
               SMALLDATETIME columns. This feature is particularly useful for removing the seconds, milliseconds
               or  microseconds  values  which  are  not  applicable  to  SMALLDATETIME  anyway. For DATETIME or
               BIGDATETIME columns, only the actual braces will be removed.

           %q  Specifies the milliseconds for DATETIME and TIME and microseconds  for  BIGDATETIME  and  BIGTIME
               data  types.  In  previous versions of sqsh the <u>%u</u> specifier was used for the millisecond part of
               the datetime datatype.  However, as <u>%u</u> is used by <b>strftime</b> to denote the day number of the  week,
               this is replaced by <u>%q</u> since sqsh-2.3. For example when using the default C locale:

                   1&gt; \set datetime='%e %b %Y %H:%M[:%S.%q]%p'
                   1&gt; select convert(bigdatetime,getdate())
                   2&gt; select convert(smalldatetime,getdate())
                   3&gt; go

       debug (string)
           If  <u>sqsh</u> has been compiled with debugging enabled (-DDEBUG), this variable may be used to control the
           amount of debugging output displayed. <b>$debug</b> may be set to a pipe (|) delimited (logical OR)  set  of
           the  following  words  to  turn on various pieces of debugging: <b>ALIAS</b>, <b>AVL</b>, <b>BCP</b>, <b>DISPLAY</b>, <b>ENV</b>, <b>ERROR</b>,
           <b>EXPAND</b>, <b>FD</b>, <b>HISTORY</b> (abbr. <b>HIST</b>), <b>JOB</b>, <b>READLINE</b> (abbr. <b>RL</b>), <b>RPC</b>, <b>SCREEN</b>, <b>SIG</b>,  <b>SIGCHLD</b>  (or  <b>SIGCLD</b>),
           <b>TDS</b> or <b>ALL</b>. Can also be set through the <u>-l</u> startup option.

       debug_tds_capture (string)
           When  <b>TDS</b> debugging is enabled and this variable is defined with a valid file name, a debugging trace
           will be logged into this file that can be analyzed with Ribo. You might need the devlib  versions  of
           the  OpenClient library to link with sqsh to be able to use this option. See for more information the
           ct_debug function in the Sybase SDK documentation.

       debug_tds_logdata (string)
           When <b>TDS</b> debugging is enabled and this variable is defined with a valid  filename,  a  debugging  log
           will be written by OpenClient with all possible debugging info (CS_DBG_ALL). See also option above.

       defer_bg (boolean)
           Normally,  when a job is run in the background (via a '&amp;' on the command line), the output of the job
           is deferred to a temporary file (located in <u>$tmp_dir</u>) until  the  user  requests  the  output  to  be
           displayed using <b>\show</b> <b>jobid</b>. This way the results of the job will not interfere with what the user is
           doing.  Setting  this  variable  to  false  will result in no deferred output files being created and
           output sent to the screen immediately

       echo (boolean)
           Setting <b>$echo</b> to on (1) causes each command submitted to the database  via  the  <b>\go</b>  command  to  be
           displayed prior to the output. This variable defaults to 0 (or off), and may also be set using the <b>-e</b>
           command line option.

       encryption (boolean)
           Setting  the  <b>$encryption</b>  variable  prior  to establishing a connection to the server will cause the
           login connection to be initiated using client-side password encryption. This variable may also be set
           using the <b>-X</b> command line option. Client-side password encryption will also occur when using  the  <b>-X</b>
           option on the <b>\connect</b>, <b>\reconnect</b> or <b>\bcp</b> commands.  Please note that the Sybase ASE setting for the
           <b>net</b>  <b>password</b>  <b>encryption</b>  <b>reqd</b>  (15.0.2)  configuration parameter may enforce you to use client side
           password encryption. <u>sqsh-2.1.9</u> supports RSA password encryption  when  the  CT-Lib  version  in  use
           supports  it.  RSA password encryption is required if the above mentioned ASE configuration parameter
           is set to <b>2</b>. Older  version  of  sqsh  only  supports  a  value  of  <b>1</b>  (CT-Lib  internal  encryption
           algorithms).

       exit_failcount (boolean)
           Settings this value to 1 causes <u>sqsh</u> to return an exit status of <b>$batch_failcount</b> rather than 0, upon
           a non-error termination. See <b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b> for details. The default value is 0.

       exit_value (int)
           When  you exit sqsh by specifying an exit code, like <b>\exit</b> <b>3</b> or using one of the aliases <b>exit</b> or <b>quit</b>
           commands, then this value is assigned to the <b>$exit_value</b> variable. You can also assign a value  using
           the  <b>\set</b>  command.  When sqsh determines this variable has a non-zero value during termination, this
           value will be used as exit code. See <b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b> for details.

       expand (boolean)
           By default when the <b>\go</b> command is executed, the contents of the current work buffer is  expanded  of
           all environment variables prior to being sent to the database for execution. By setting this variable
           to  "0", the buffer will no longer be expanded before being sent to the database. This is useful when
           you either (1) have strings in the buffer that contain a '$' and you don't want them to be  expanded,
           or  (2)  for  performance  reasons;  it  takes  time (and an extra copy of the buffer) to perform the
           variable expansion.

       filter (boolean)
           Toggles filtering of the SQL batch through an external program (defined by the <b>$filter_prog</b> variable,
           below) prior to being sent to the SQL Server. Default is '0', or 'off'.

       filter_prog (string)
           Defines the external program through which the SQL batch will be filtered prior to being sent to  the
           SQL Server. This variable is ignored if <b>$filter</b> is set to '0' or 'off'. The default is 'm4 -'.

       float (float-format)
           Defines the display format (the precision and scale) for all floating point values displayed by sqsh.
           The default is '18.6'. Note that values exceeding the defined precision are not truncated, so setting
           this value too low may cause columns in a result set to be miss-aligned.

       footers (boolean)
           Toggles the "(%d rows affected)" following a result set. The default for this variable is '1'.

       headers (boolean)
           Toggles the column headers preceding a result set. The default for this variable is '1'.

       help_dir (path)
           This  is the location of the help files used by the <b>\help</b> command, typically it defaults to something
           like /usr/local/lib/sqsh/help.

       hist_auto_save (int)
           When variable <b>$histsave</b> is on and the <b>$hist_auto_save</b> variable has a value greater than 0,  then  the
           history  will  be  automatically saved to <b>$history</b> after <b>$hist_auto_save</b> modifications of the history
           buffers. When the value is 0 (default), then no automatic history save will be performed.

       histmerge (boolean)
           When this option is on, sqsh will merge the contents of the history  on  disk  with  the  history  in
           memory before writing the history back to disk. This is to prevent data loss in the history file when
           other sqsh sessions have also written to the same history file on disk. This option is off by default
           which  will  just  overwrite  the  existing  history  file when you exit sqsh or the history is being
           automatically saved because of <b>$hist_auto_save</b> being set.

       histnum (int)
           Contains the history number that will be assigned to the current command batch as  soon  as  the  <b>\go</b>
           command  is  executed.  This  variable should be considered read-only. See also the discussion on the
           <b>$histunique</b> variable.

       history (path)
           This is the location of the history file used to store and retrieve a user's history during  start-up
           and  shutdown.  This  defaults  to  <u>$HOME/.sqsh_history</u>.   This  variable is expanded each time it is
           referenced by sqsh, much in the same  way  that  <b>$prompt</b>  is  referenced  each  time  the  prompt  is
           displayed.

       history_shorthand (boolean)
           This  variable  is  only meaningful within an interactive session. If set, it turns on the ability to
           append any named buffer or history buffer onto the current work buffer in a 'sh' history style,  such
           as  '!40'.  Be  careful  with this feature, <u>sqsh</u> is not terribly intelligent with looking for history
           shorthand, so it is possible that it may get confused (although, it is smart enough to ignore !'s  in
           quoted strings).

       histsave (boolean)
           The  value  of  this  variable  is  used  by  <u>sqsh</u> to indicate whether the history should be saved to
           <b>$history</b> prior to termination of sqsh.

       histsize (int)
           The value of this variable is used to alter the maximum number of history entries are  maintained  by
           <u>sqsh</u> (the default is 10). Note that decreasing the value of this variable causes some history entries
           to be lost.

       histunique (boolean)
           If  set,  <u>sqsh</u>  maintains  a  MRU-LRU  order of executed buffers and does not store duplicate command
           buffers. For example, observe the following situation:

               LINUX1502.user1.master.1&gt; \history
               (1) sp_who
               (2) grant role mon_role to sa_role
               (3) select * from monProcessActivity
               (4) select @@authmech,show_sec_services()
               (5) select @@servername,@@authmech,show_sec_services()
               LINUX1502.user1.master.1&gt; sp_who
               LINUX1502.user1.master.2&gt; go
               ... output omitted
               LINUX1502.user1.master.1&gt; \history
               (1) grant role mon_role to sa_role
               (2) select * from monProcessActivity
               (3) select @@authmech,show_sec_services()
               (4) select @@servername,@@authmech,show_sec_services()
               (5) sp_who

           <u>sp_who</u> is the last executed command and the buffer - originally the last in the list - is now on  top
           of  the  list.  When  an already existing buffer is reused, the value of the <b>$histnum</b> variable is not
           changed.

       hostname (string)
           Used during the connection process to indicate to SQL Server the name of the host from which <u>sqsh</u>  is
           connecting. This variable may also be set using the <b>-H</b> flag.

       ifs (string)
           The list of Internal Field Separators.

       ignoreeof (boolean)
           By  default, <u>sqsh</u> terminates if the user presses ^d (control-D) on an empty line and readline support
           is compiled in. If <b>$ignoreeof</b> is set in the sqshrc file you get a warning message instead:

               CTRL-D: Use "exit" or "quit" to leave the sqsh shell.

           This is equivalent to using "set -o ignoreeof" in the bash shell.

       interactive (boolean)
           This is a variable used internally and should probably not be altered by the user. If <b>$interactive</b> is
           '0', then the prompt is not displayed, the history is neither read nor written and some user messages
           are suppressed.

       interfaces (path)
           This is the full path name of the interfaces file, it defaults to <u>$SYBASE/interfaces</u>.

       keytab_file (string)
           Used in Kerberos and DCE user authentication security mechanisms. Corresponds  with  the  <b>-K</b>  startup
           option.

           See also the discussion on Kerberos Support.

       keyword_completion (int/string)
           This  variable  only applies if GNU Readline support has been compiled into <u>sqsh</u>. <b>$keyword_completion</b>
           is used to control the T-SQL keyword completion feature in readline, and may be set using  either  an
           integer  between  0 and 4, or one of the strings <u>none</u>, <u>lower</u>, <u>upper</u>, <u>smart</u>, or <u>exact</u>. If it is set to
           either 0 or <u>none</u>, then no keyword completion is performed (this is the default). <u>lower</u> or  1,  causes
           <u>sqsh</u>  to  complete  the  keyword  in  lowercase,  regardless of the case that the partially completed
           keyword was typed. <u>upper</u> or 2 forces completion to be performed in upper case, <u>smart</u>, or 3, bases the
           decision on case upon the first character of the partial keyword, and <u>exact</u> completes the keyword  in
           exactly  the  same  case as defined in the <u>.sqsh_words</u> (for the built-in T-SQL keywords, this will be
           lower case).  New in <u>sqsh-2.5</u> is that when regular Readline  completion  does  not  match  the  typed
           string with a keyword, then filename completion will be tried in the current directory. For example:

               SYBASE.sa.master.1&gt; \lcd $SYBASE/$SYBASE_ASE/scripts
               \lcd: local directory changed to: /opt/sybase/ASE-15_0/scripts
               SYBASE.sa.master.1&gt; \run -n -i ./instm&lt;TAB&gt;

           results in the completed filename "./instmsgs.ebf".

       keyword_dynamic (boolean)
           This  variable controls the dynamic loading of keywords in the completion list when initially logging
           in to the server or when the database context is changed using the <u>use</u> <u>database</u>  command.  When  this
           variable  is  set  to  'On'  (default  is  'Off'),  then  the  query  that  is  provided  through the
           <b>$keyword_query</b> variable is executed and the query result set is loaded into the  Readline  completion
           list.  This  will  only  work  for Sybase ASE and Microsoft SQL servers.  This variable also controls
           dynamic loading of a column list to be auto- completed by Readline. When an object name  is  followed
           by  a dot and TAB completion is requested, <u>sqsh</u> dynamically creates a list of columns that belongs to
           the object (table, view, procedure) and allows for Readline TAB completion of the column or parameter
           names. This feature is only available if GNU  Readline  support  has  been  compiled  into  <u>sqsh</u>  and
           <b>$keyword_completion</b>  is  set to a value greater than zero. In sqsh-2.4 it is also possible to use the
           object alias in the SQL buffer for auto-completion. For example when you enter the following query in
           the buffer and type the TAB key twice after the alias 'd' and the dot, a list of column names will be
           produced for the 'sysdatabases' table for further completion:

               SYBPROD.sa.tempdb.1&gt; select * from master..sysdatabases d,
               SYBPROD.sa.tempdb.2&gt;               master.dbo.sysusages u
               SYBPROD.sa.tempdb.3&gt; where d.&lt;TAB&gt;&lt;TAB&gt;
               d.audflags         d.def_remote_loc   d.durability       d.status2
               d.audflags2        d.def_remote_type  d.logptr           d.status3
               d.crdate           d.deftabaud        d.name             d.status4
               d.dbid             d.defvwaud         d.spare            d.suid
               d.defpraud         d.dumptrdate       d.status           d.version
               SYBPROD.sa.tempdb.3&gt; where d.

           This works both for the T-SQL join syntax and the ANSI inner, outer, left and right join syntax. Note
           that sqsh is now able to perform cross database auto-completion as well.

       keyword_file (string)
           If Readline support has been compiled into <u>sqsh</u>, and <u>sqsh</u> is  being  run  in  interactive  mode,  the
           contents  of this file are used for keyword tab completion by Readline rather than the default set of
           T-SQL syntactical keywords. The default is <u>$HOME/.sqsh_words</u>. When <b>$keyword_dynamic</b> is  enabled  this
           takes precedence and overrules the list loaded from <b>$keyword_file</b>.

       keyword_query (string)
           This  variable  contains  the  query  that  will be executed when a change of database is detected or
           during initial login (Msg 5701). The default query is:

               select name from sysobjects order by name

           But you can supply a different query that suits your needs even better. E.g.

               \set keyword_query="\\
                 select name from sysobjects \\
                 where type in ('U','V','P','S') \\
                 union \\
                 select name from sybsystemprocs..sysobjects \\
                 where type='P' \\
                 order by name"

           This feature is controlled by the variables <b>$keyword_completion</b>  and  <b>$keyword_dynamic</b>  and  is  only
           available if GNU Readline support has been compiled into <u>sqsh</u>.

       language (string)
           The  <b>$language</b> variable is used while establishing a connection to the server to specify the national
           language used to display system prompts and messages.  The  variable  will  automatically  track  the
           current language setting of the server. This may also be set via the <b>-z</b> flag.

       lineno (int)
           This  is  an internal variable and should not be altered by the user. It is used to maintain the line
           number that is being typed into within the current work buffer.

       linesep (string)
           Used to configure the line separator for the horizontal display style, this defaults to "\n\t".

       localeconv (boolean)
           A boolean variable that when set to true will result in the Operating System locale to  be  used  for
           displaying  all  datetime  (DATETIME,  SMALLDATETIME,  TIME,  DATE,  BIGDATETIME and BIGTIME) and the
           numeric, decimal, real, float and money/smallmoney datatypes in the result set. When this variable is
           set to false (i.e. the default), sqsh will use the  internal  C/POSIX  locale  to  determine  how  to
           display these datatypes. For example:

               ~$ export LANG=nl_NL.utf8
               ~$ locale -ck LC_TIME
               LC_TIME
               abday="zo;ma;di;wo;do;vr;za"
               day="zondag;maandag;dinsdag;woensdag;donderdag;vrijdag;zaterdag"
               abmon="jan;feb;mrt;apr;mei;jun;jul;aug;sep;okt;nov;dec"
               mon="januari;februari;maart;april;mei;juni;juli;augustus;september;oktober;
                    november;december"
               am_pm=";"
               ...

               ~$ sqsh -Llocaleconv=On -Ldatetime="%A %e %B %Y" -C"select getdate()"
                ---------------------------
                       maandag 22 juli 2013

               (1 row affected)
               ~$ sqsh -Llocaleconv=Off -Ldatetime="%A %e %B %Y" -C"select getdate()"
                ---------------------------
                        Monday 22 July 2013

               (1 row affected)

           Also,  depending  on  the  locale,  the  decimal specifier in money, numeric, decimal, float and real
           datatypes may be displayed as a <b>","</b>. Note that sqsh does not take the thousands_sep into account when
           displaying numerical data values.

       lock (string/write-only)
           Defines the password to be used by the <b>\lock</b> command. If unset or set to the string "NULL", then  the
           UNIX  password  of  the  user running <u>sqsh</u> is used instead (if possible). Note that <b>$lock</b> will always
           expand to the string "*lock*" if referenced.

       login_timeout (int)
           The number of seconds to wait when attempting to create a new connection to a data server. Default is
           0 (infinite wait). See also the <b>-T</b> command line option.

       max_timeout (int)
           Controls the number of times a query needs to reach its time-out value before the session is aborted.
           See <b>$query_timeout</b> and the <b>-Q</b> command line flag.  The following messages will be displayed  and  sqsh
           exits with value 255 when the <b>$max_timeout</b> limit is reached.

               Query or command timeout detected, session aborted
               The client connection has detected this x time(s)
               Aborting on max_timeout limit

       maxlen (int)
           Controls  the maximum amount of data that will be displayed (in any display mode) in a single column.
           This setting will automatically truncate the output of particularly large data types (such  as  TEXT)
           to the value supplied. The default setting is 32768 bytes (32KB).

       newline_go (boolean)
           This  flag is used as a horrible kludge to support an "empty" alias for the <b>\go</b> command, that is, the
           equivalent of supplying "-c ''" or just "-c"  on  the  command  line.  When  on,  an  empty  line  is
           interpreted  as  a  call  to  the  <b>\go</b>  command.  This feature is not recommended but is supplied for
           completeness.

       nosepline (boolean)
           Suppress the separator lines with the pretty output style.

       output_parms (boolean)
           Flag used to enable or disable the display of output parameter result sets  from  stored  procedures.
           The default is to enable the display.

       p2faxm (int)
           Implements  the  feature  Print  messages  to  File  (P2F).  This variable is used in conjuction with
           <b>$p2fname</b> and specifies a threshold on the number of messages per batch  that  will  be  send  to  the
           terminal  window.  If the threshold is exceeded, the remaining messages will be send to the specified
           file. The default value is NULL which disables the P2F feature. Also an assigned value of 0  disables
           this  feature.  This feature will only work in interactive mode and is to prevent an accidental flood
           of server messages scrolling over the screen.  For example:

               SYBASE.sa.tempdb.1&gt; \set p2fname=/tmp/sqsh_p2f.out
               SYBASE.sa.tempdb.1&gt; \set p2faxm=10
               SYBASE.sa.tempdb.1&gt; create clustered index keys_cx on keys(id)
               SYBASE.sa.tempdb.2&gt;   with ignore_dup_row
               SYBASE.sa.tempdb.2&gt; go
               Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '0'
               Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '1'
               Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '2'
               Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '3'
               Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '4'
               Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '5'
               Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '6'
               Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '7'
               Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '8'
               Warning: deleted duplicate row.  Primary key is '9'
               Warning: Number of printed server messages exceeds p2faxm=10 limit for current batch.
                        Remaining server messages will be printed to file: /tmp/sqsh_p2f.out

       p2fname (path)
           Contains the filename for the Print messages to File (P2F) feature described above. Default  is  NULL
           which  disables  the  P2F  feature. If a file is specified that already exists, then new data will be
           appended.

       packet_size (int)
           Defines the size of the TDS packets used to communicate with SQL. Changing the value of the  variable
           will  not  affect  the  current  connection  but  will  take effect upon the next <b>\reconnect</b> command.
           Specifying a value of NULL indicates that the default packet size is desired.

       password (string/write-only)
           This is the user's current password. A NULL password may be assigned using an explicit "NULL" string.
           For security reasons, when referenced the  <b>$password</b>  variable  will  always  expand  to  the  string
           "*password*".

       password_retry (boolean)
           When the variable is on and sqsh started in interactive mode, sqsh will ask for the password again if
           login failed. When set to 'off', sqsh will terminate immediately. Default is on.

       principal (string)
           Used  in  Kerberos user authentication as the Server principal name when it differs from the <b>$DSQUERY</b>
           name. Corresponds with the <b>-R</b> startup option.

           See also the discussion on Kerberos Support.

       prompt (string)
           This variable is used by <u>sqsh</u> to build your current prompt. Any variables  contained  within  <b>$prompt</b>
           are expanded each time the prompt is displayed. The default value for this is '${lineno}&gt; '. See also
           the discussion on color support below.

       prompt2 (string)
           This  contents  of  this  prompt are expanded and displayed during interactive use when <u>sqsh</u> requires
           additional input, such as during a line continuation. The default value is '--&gt; '.

       query_timeout (int)
           Number of seconds to wait for a query to return data. If the timeout is reached the query is  aborted
           (canceled). See also <b>$max_timeout</b> and the <b>-Q</b> command line option.

       rcfile (path)
           Contains  a  colon  (:)  delimited  list  of  sqsh  resource  (sqshrc)  files. The default setting is
           /etc/sqshrc followed by <u>$HOME/.sqshrc</u>).

       readline_histignore (string)
           If readline support has been compiled into <u>sqsh</u>, you can control which commands or statements on  the
           command  line will be filtered from the readline history file specified by <b>$readline_history</b>. It is a
           colon (:) separated string or a string containing a regular expression that is identified  by  "RE:".
           For example:

               \set readline_histignore='go:lo:mo:exit:quit:vi:!!:GO'
               or
               \set readline_histignore='"RE:^[glm]o$|^cd |^exit$|^quit$|^vi$"'

           The  regular  expression  in  the  second example starts with <u>RE:</u> and it is recommended to supply the
           string between quotes and double quotes to prevent expansion and display problems  due  to  the  pipe
           characters. The regular expression is evaluated case insensitive.

       readline_history (string)
           If  readline  support  has been compiled into <u>sqsh</u>, the contents of the readline line-by-line history
           will  be  written  to  the  file  specified  by  the  <b>$readline_history</b>  variable.  The  default   is
           <u>$HOME/.sqsh_readline</u>.

       readline_histsize (int)
           If readline support has been compiled into <u>sqsh</u>, the value of <b>$readline_histsize</b> specifies the number
           of  lines  that  are  saved in the readline line-by-line history. Setting this to a value of 0 causes
           every line to be saved. The default value is 100.

       real (float-format)
           Defines the display format (the precision and scale) for all  real  values  displayed  by  sqsh.  The
           default  is  '18.6'.  Note  that values exceeding the defined precision are not truncated, so setting
           this value too low may cause columns in a result set to be miss-aligned.

       repeat_batch (boolean)
           When set to <b>On</b> or <b>True</b>, a <b>\go</b> executed with an empty <b>SQL</b> <b>Buffer</b> will cause the previous batch  to  be
           re-executed.

       secmech (string)
           The name of the security mechanism used for user authentication. For instance csfkrb5. When using the
           <b>-Z</b>  option,  the name of the security mechanism can be specified, or when no secmech is supplied, the
           OpenClient   will   use   the    default,    i.e.    the    first    security    entry    from    the
           <u>$SYBASE/$SYBASE_OCS/config/libtcl.cfg</u>  file.  Note  that  the  name  used  must match the name of the
           corresponding secmech entry in the <u>objectid.dat</u> file. When the connection to the server is setup, the
           actual secmech name will be stored in the <b>$secmech</b> variable.

       secure_options (string)
           Describe the security options used for user authentication security mechanisms.  Corresponds  to  the
           <b>-V</b> startup option.

           See also the paragraph on Kerberos Support.

       script (string)
           If <u>sqsh</u> is run using the <b>-i</b> flag, then this variable contains the name of the script being executed.

       semicolon_cmd (string)
           When  <b>$semicolon_hack</b>  (see  below)  is  enabled,  the  contents  of this variable is executed when a
           semicolon is encountered in the <b>SQL</b> <b>Buffer</b>. This variable defaults to the string '<b>\go</b>'.

       semicolon_hack (boolean)
           Toggles on the ability to use a ';' as an in-line command terminator. This feature is not recommended
           and is only in here because enough users complained.  See section <b>COMMANDS,</b> <b>In-Line</b> <b>\go</b>.

       semicolon_hack2 (boolean)
           Toggles on the ability to use multiple ';' as an in-line command terminator.  See  section  <b>COMMANDS,</b>
           <b>In-Line</b> <b>\go</b>.

       session (string)
           The  location  of  the  session  file  that will be processed just before connecting to a server. The
           variable will be expanded so it may contain environment variables.

       SHELL (string)
           The name of the shell to be used to execute pipes and to be  used  by  the  <b>\shell</b>  command  (default
           '<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>').

       statistics (boolean)
           Setting  <b>$statistics</b>  to  1 causes timing statistics to be displayed upon the successful execution of
           every batch of SQL. This variable may also be set via the <b>-p</b> command line flag, or by supplying <b>-p</b> to
           the <b>\go</b> command.  <b>$statistics</b> defaults to 0.

       style (string)
           Selects result set display style. Currently eight styles are supported. The <b>horiz</b> (which may also  be
           defined  as  <b>hor</b>  or <b>horizontal</b>), closely resembles the output of isql, with the traditional columnar
           output.

           The <b>vert</b> (or <b>vertical</b>) style rotates the output, so that every line is represented by a  column  name
           followed by a column value. This is nice for looking at particularly wide output.

           The  <b>bcp</b>  style  displays  results  in  a format amenable to bcp'ing the result set back into another
           table. That is, every column value is separated by <b>$bcp_colsep</b> with the  final  column  separated  by
           <b>$bcp_rowsep</b>  followed  by  a  newline (\n). If <b>$bcp_colsep</b> or <b>$bcp_rowsep</b> are not defined then '|' is
           used as the default separator. Note that this output does not work well  with  COMPUTE  columns,  and
           uses  the  default  conversion methods for all data types (that is, <b>datetime</b> columns may truncate the
           millisecond).

           The <b>csv</b> display style outputs all result sets in the form of a comma separated construct.  This  mode
           is ideal to import result sets into spreadsheet programs, for instance.

           The <b>html</b> display style outputs all result sets in the form of an HTML &lt;TABLE&gt; construct. This mode is
           ideal for the use of sqsh as a CGI application.

           The <b>meta</b> display style outputs only the meta-data information associated with the result and discards
           the  actual  row  results.  This  mode  is useful for debugging the result sets generated from a full
           passthru Open Server gateway, or for those interested in what is really coming back from the server.

           The <b>pretty</b> display style generates a fluffy table-like output  using  regular  ASCII  characters  for
           borders.  This  mode  does  not  perform  any  explicit column wrapping, like the <b>horiz</b> display mode.
           However, the <b>$colwidth</b> variable can be used to control the maximum width of a  given  column  on  the
           screen.  If  the  column  exceeds  <b>$colwidth</b>  characters wide, it is wrapped in a relatively visually
           appealing manner. Note that <b>$colwidth</b> may be exceeded if there is enough screen  width  to  hold  the
           columns without wrapping.

           The <b>none</b> display style suppresses all results from being displayed (however it does actually retrieve
           result  information  from the SQL Server). This is particularly useful when used with the <b>-p</b> flag (or
           the <b>$statistics</b> variable) for gathering accurate performance statistics.

       term_title (string)
           When this variable is set, sqsh will reset the name of the current  terminal  (xterm)  window  it  is
           running  in.  Works  for xterm, rxvt, putty and MS-Windows CMD windows. The name consists of the sqsh
           startup name appended with the expanded value of the <b>$term_title</b> variable.

       thresh_display (int)
           Sets the minimum SQL Server error severity that will display a message to the user, the default is  0
           and valid ranges are between 0 and 22, inclusive.

       thresh_exit (int)
           Defines  the  maximum  number of errors of severity level <b>$thresh_fail</b> that may be encountered before
           sqsh aborts. This is useful primarily for non-interactive scripts, but is allowed on  an  interactive
           session.  Setting  <b>$thresh_exit</b>  to  a  value of 0 disables this feature. See section <b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b> for
           details.

       thresh_fail (int)
           Sets the minimum SQL Server severity level that is to be considered a failed batch. The  minimum  for
           this  value  is  0  (meaning  any  error  that is not an information message), and the maximum is 22.
           Whenever <b>$thresh_fail</b> is crossed, the variable <b>$batch_failcount</b> is incremented by 1. See section <b>EXIT</b>
           <b>STATUS</b> for details.

       time (date-spec)
           This variable may be set with a time format (see the man page for <u><b>date</b></u><b>(1)</b>), and the variable  expands
           to  the  current  time in the supplied format. The default format for this variable is %H:%M:%S (e.g.
           14:32:58).

       timefmt (date-spec)
           This variable may be set with a time format similar to <b>$time</b> and  is  used  to  control  the  display
           format  of  all  SQL Server TIME and BIGTIME columns. (Similar to <b>$datetime</b>.) Note that only 63 bytes
           are available in total for the expanded string and the remainder will be truncated.

       tmp_dir (path)
           This contains the directory to which temporary files used internally by <u>sqsh</u> are to be written. These
           files are generated either during buffer editing (the <b>\buf-edit</b> command), or to maintain output defer
           files for background jobs.  The default value for this variable is /tmp.

       usedbcheck (boolean)
           When this variable is set to 'On' (default is 'Off') and a database name  is  provided  with  the  -D
           parameter and sqsh is run in batch mode, i.e.  non-interactive, then a check will be performed if the
           specified  database  is  accessible, otherwise sqsh is aborted with exit code 254. Also the following
           error message will be shown:

           <b>sqsh:</b> <b>ERROR:</b> <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>database</b> <b>'...'</b> <b>in</b> <b>batch</b> <b>mode</b>

           This is to prevent that a SQL script is inadvertently executed in the  wrong  database,  usually  the
           default database of the login (master for example).

       username (string)
           The name of the user currently connected to the database.

       version (none)
           This read-only variable contains the current version number. (sqsh-2.1.7)

       width (int)
           The current width of the SQL output.

       xgeom (string/int)
           If  X11  support  is  compiled into <u>sqsh</u>, this value is used to configure the default window size (in
           characters) of the X display. This variable must be of the format <b>WxH</b> or just <b>W</b>, where <b>W</b> is the width
           of the window and <b>H</b> is the height of the window. If the height of the window is not supplied, then 25
           lines is assumed. If <b>$xgeom</b> is not set, then <b>$width</b> is used as the default width and  the  height  is
           assumed to be 25. If neither is set, then 80x25 is assumed.

       xwin_title (string)
           If X11 support is compiled into <u>sqsh</u> and an X11 result windows is requested by using the <b>-x</b> parameter
           of the <u>\go</u> or <u>\rpc</u> commands, then this variable will be used to set the title name of the window. Can
           be temporarily overridden with the <b>-T</b> option of the <u>\go</u> and <u>\rpc</u> commands.

   <b>Script</b> <b>Execution</b>
       As  with  most  shells, <u>sqsh</u> allows a file containing SQL and script commands to be executed directly via
       the magical UNIX <b>#!</b> convention. On most UNIX platforms, when the operating system encounters the bytes <b>#!</b>
       as the first two bytes of an executable file it will automatically pipe the file through the  interpreter
       specified  immediately  after the <b>#!</b>. For example, to create an executable <u>sqsh</u> script to run <b>sp_who</b>, you
       simply need to create a file like so:

           #!/usr/bin/sqsh -i
           sp_who
           go

       Thus, if your <b>sp_who</b> script is executed directly, it will automatically launch "<b>/usr/bin/sqsh</b> <b>-i</b>  <b>sp_who</b>"
       for you.

       And,  to  make things even more flexible, <u>sqsh</u> supports positional parameters, similar to most shells, of
       the form <b>${n}</b> which will expand to the <b>n</b>th argument to your <u>sqsh</u> script. For example:

           #!/usr/bin/sqsh -i
           sp_who ${1}
           go

       will cause the <b>sp_who</b> stored procedure to be  executed  with  an  argument  of  the  first  command  line
       parameter supplied to the <b>sp_who</b> shell script.

       Note  that positional parameters <u>must</u> be contained between braces to avoid conflicts with the T-SQL <b>money</b>
       data type (without the braces, the variable will not be expanded).

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       One of the major complaints of <u>isql</u> is that it provides no facility to detect  when  an  error  condition
       occurred  while  it  is performing processing. <u>sqsh</u> provides a rather complex, but flexible mechanism for
       returning meaningful information concerning its reason for exit in  the  form  of  an  exit  status  (see
       <u><b>exit</b></u><b>(3)</b>).

       When  <u>sqsh</u>  begins execution two handlers are associated with the current connection to the database, one
       is a message handler which is responsible for displaying the text of any SQL Server messages  or  errors,
       and  the  other  is  an  error  handler,  which  is  responsible for determining what to do with an error
       condition (bear with me, these are only loose descriptions). And, associated with each message and  error
       condition is a severity level, between 0 and 22 (informational message to fatal condition).

       Associated  with  these  two message handlers are several variables that are used to either control their
       behavior, or are used as indicators by the message handler:

       $thresh_display
           This variable is used by the message handler to determine the minimum error severity which will cause
           a message to be displayed. By default this is 0, which will display all messages (with  a  couple  of
           exceptions). Setting this to 1, for example, would suppress informational messages such as the output
           of <b>set</b> <b>showplan</b> <b>on</b>.

       $thresh_fail
           This variable is used by the error handler to determine which error severity is considered by <u>sqsh</u> to
           be  a failure. Normally, this defaults to 11 which indicates that any error, other than informational
           messages, is a failure. The next variable will explain the importance of this value.

       $batch_failcount
           This variable should be considered read-only, and contains the total number  of  times  that  batches
           have caused an error of severity <b>$thresh_fail</b> or more. The only value that is valid to explicitly set
           this  value  to, is "" (the empty string), which will reset this value to 0, any other value may have
           unpredictable results.

       $thresh_exit
           This variable is used to determine the limit at which <b>$batch_failcount</b> will cause <u>sqsh</u>  to  exit.  If
           <b>$thresh_exit</b> is 0, then this feature is disabled.  In other words, if <b>$batch_failcount</b> <b>=</b> <b>$thresh_exit</b>
           and  <b>$thresh_exit</b>  is  greater  than  0,  then  <u>sqsh</u> will exit, returning <b>$batch_failcount</b> as an exit
           status.

           Note that, unless <b>$exit_failcount</b> is set to 1, <u>sqsh</u> will exit with 0 if the total number of  failures
           does not reach <b>$thresh_exit</b>.

       $exit_failcount
           This variable is used only when <u>sqsh</u> would normally exit with a success status (0), this causes it to
           instead exit with a value of <b>$batch_failcount</b> (which may, itself, be 0).

       $exit_value
           When  this variable is non-zero, it will override the <b>$exit_failcount</b> and <b>$batch_failcount</b> values and
           just exit the value of <b>$exit_value</b>. This variable may be explicitly set using the  <b>\set</b>  command,  or
           implicitly using <b>\exit</b> <b>x</b> and its aliased counterparts.

       To  recap, here is a list of error codes that may be returned by <u>sqsh</u> upon exit, and the reason that they
       could be returned:

       - 0 -
           No error has been encountered.

       - 1...253 -
           Between 1 and 253 batches have failed (if you run more than 253 batches, the exit status of  sqsh  is
           undetermined...I may fix this in the future).

       - 254 -
           An explicit <b>\abort</b> was called, or a SIGINT (^C) was issued during a non-interactive session.

       - 255 -
           A  general  error  condition  has  occurred,  such  as  a  bad  command line argument to sqsh, memory
           allocation failure, file access error, etc.

       The following sections provide detailed examples of combinations of variable  settings  and  the  results
       produced  upon exit with certain failure conditions. It is assumed the <b>$exit_value</b> variable contains 0 in
       the next examples.

       thresh_display=0, thresh_fail=0, thresh_exit=1
           With this combination, all error messages will be displayed as they happen, and every error  will  be
           considered  an  failure condition. Upon reaching the first error, <u>sqsh</u> will abort with an exit status
           of 1, or the total number of failures (the <b>$batch_failcount</b> variable). However, if nothing goes wrong
           during the whole process, a zero is returned.

       thresh_display=0, thresh_fail=0, thresh_exit=3
           This combination will cause all error conditions to be displayed and all of them to be  considered  a
           failure  condition.  Upon  reaching  three  total  failed batches, <u>sqsh</u> will exit with a status of 3.
           However if 0, 1, or 2 batches fail, then 0 is returned.

       thresh_display=22, thresh_fail=0, thresh_exit=3
           This behaves the same as the previous example, with the exception that all  error  messages  will  be
           suppressed  from  being  displayed. This is particularly useful if you just care about the exit value
           more than the actual error.

       thresh_display=0, thresh_fail=2, thresh_exit=1
           This will cause the first error of severity 2 or higher to be displayed and cause <u>sqsh</u> to exit with a
           failure condition of 1.

       thresh_display=0, thresh_fail=0, thresh_exit=3, exit_failcount=1
           This is identical to the second example, above, however <b>sqsh</b> will return the total number of  batches
           that failed even if <b>$batch_failcount</b> does not reach 3.

       exit_value=nonzero
           This will override all conditions explained above and just exit the specific value.

</pre><h4><b>MISCELLANEOUS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Colorizing</b> <b>sqsh</b> <b>prompts</b>
       Color  codes  are  presented as a string like {1;2;3}. If sqsh encounters a { (curly brace) in the prompt
       string it will assume a color-code is supplied and will act as such. No checks will be performed  on  the
       validity  of the color-code definition itself. The color definition consists of three values separated by
       a semicolon.

       The first code defines the Color Attribute Code with possible values:  0=none  1=bold  The  second  value
       defines  the  Text Color Code: 30=black 31=red 32=green 33=yellow 34=blue 35=magenta 36=cyan 37=white The
       third value defines the Background Color Code: 40=black  41=red  42=green  43=yellow  44=blue  45=magenta
       46=cyan  47=white  The  last  color-code  for the background may be omitted.  Not all color and attribute
       combinations will present good results, depending on  your  terminal  type  and  color  scheme.  But  the
       following  values  work  OK  on  a xterm with a creamy white background color in Linux as well as rxvt in
       Cygwin with a black background window:

           Prompt: Blue text in white background "{0;34;47}"
           Command text: Yellow text             "{0;33}"
           Command text: Default text color      "{0}"

       sqsh will translate the color-codes to an actual color-code string that is  presented  to  readline:  for
       example  "\001\033[0;36;47m\002". Note that if you want to use curly brackets in your prompt, you have to
       escape colorization by specifying a double brace, like {{...}}. For example:

           \set prompt_color='{0;34;47}'
           \set text_color='{0}'
           \set prompt='$prompt_color{{$DSQUERY.$username.$database.$lineno}}&gt;$text_color '

       Color support is automatically available if sqsh is compiled and linked with readline support enabled.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Defaults:     $HOME/.sqshrc,     $HOME/.sqsh_session,     $HOME/.sqsh_history,      $HOME/.sqsh_readline,
       $HOME/.sqsh_words, $tmp_dir/sqsh-dfr.*, $tmp_dir/sqsh-edit.* These can all be modified using the internal
       <u>sqsh</u> variables described above.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  addition  of  flow-of-control  expressions  has  extended  sqsh <u>way</u> beyond the scope of its original
       design, and it is quite obvious from using the  features  they  are  hacked  in  and  are  rather  clunky
       (although  still  quite  usable).  As  a result, the processing of these expressions is rather slow (when
       compared to bourne shell), and the error reporting doesn't lend itself to debugging  large  scripts.  The
       development of 1000+ line scripts is discouraged.

       The  combination  of  backgrounding  and pipes does not work properly right now.  What happens is, when a
       background job is run that incorporates a pipe-line, <u>sqsh</u> will suspend until the job is  complete,  which
       is obviously not what you desire. To test this, try the following:

           1&gt; select * from syscolumns
           2&gt; go | grep id &amp;

       You  will  find  that you do not get your prompt back until the job completes.  The same is more ore less
       true for pipes being used with the \do command:

           1&gt; select name from master..sysdatabases
           2&gt; \do | grep syb

       This will not give you a prompt anymore until the block completes with \done.  So you are typing  the  do
       block  itself  in  the dark and there is no possiblity to edit a do block or retrieve a do block from the
       history list.  So you may have typed (hopefully without syntax errors):

           \echo #1
           \done

       After \done is processed the results will be displayed followed by a fresh prompt.
