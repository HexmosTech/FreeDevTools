</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       csepdjvu - DjVu encoder for separated data files.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>csepdjvu</b>  <b>[</b><u>options</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b><u>sepfiles</u><b>]...</b> <u>outputdjvufile</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  program creates a DjVuDocument file <u>outputdjvufile</u> from separated data files <u>sepfiles</u>.  It can read
       separated data from the standard input when given a single dash instead of the separated data file names.
       This feature is intended for pre-processing programs that push separated data into <b>csepdjvu</b> via a pipe.

       Each separated data file represents one or more page images.  When the program arguments specify multiple
       pages, all the pages are encoded and saved as a bundled multi-page document.  When the program  arguments
       specify a single page, the page is encoded and saved as a single page file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-d</b> <u>n</u>   Specify  the  resolution  information encoded into the output file expressed in dots per inch. The
              resolution information encoded in DjVu files determine how the  decoder  scales  the  image  on  a
              particular display.  Meaningful resolutions range from 25 to 6000.  The default value is 300 dpi.

       <b>-q</b> <u>n</u><b>,...,</b><u>n</u>

       <b>-q</b> <u>n</u><b>+...+</b><u>n</u>
              Specify  the  encoding  quality of the IW44 encoded background layer.  The option argument contain
              several integers (one per chunk) separated by either commas or pluses.  This option is similar  to
              option  <b>-slice</b>  of  program <b>c44</b>.  Please refer to the <b><a href="../man1/c44.1.html">c44</a></b>(1) man page for additional details.  The
              default quality specification is <b>-q</b> <b>72,83,93,103</b>.

              This option does not apply to uniformly white background that were not specified by the  separated
              data  but  are  called  for  by the DjVu specification.  Such background images always come at the
              lowest possible resolution and with a standard quality setting that ensures the color uniformity.

       <b>-t</b>     Program <b>csepdjvu</b> interprets certain comments in the separated file  to  construct  a  hidden  text
              layer  in the DjVu file. This layer records the location of each word for hiliting purposes.  This
              option reduces the file size by simply recording the location of each line.

       <b>-v</b>     Display a brief message describing each page.

       <b>-vv</b>    Display extensive informational messages during encoding.

</pre><h4><b>SEPARATED</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Each separated data file contains a concatenation of one or more separated page  images.   Each  page  is
       logically  represented  by  a foreground image with a transparent color and by a background image visible
       through the transparent pixels.  The data for each separated page  image  is  the  concatenation  of  the
       following data blocks:

       *  A  foreground  image  encoded  using either the "Color RLE format" or the "Bitonal RLE format".  These
          formats are described later in this section.

       *  An optional background image encoded as a "Portable Pixmap" (  PPM  ).   This  well  known  format  is
          summarized later in this section.  The absence of a background image simply indicates that a uniformly
          white background should be assumed.

       *  An  arbitrary  number  of  comment  lines  starting  with  character  "#" and terminated by a linefeed
          character. Comment lines whose  first  word  starts  with  a  capital  letter  have  special  meanings
          documented later in this document.

       The dimensions (width and height) of the background image must be obtained by rounding up the quotient of
       the  foreground  image  dimensions  by  an  integer  reduction  factor ranging from 1 to 12.  Assume, for
       instance, that the width of the foreground is 2507 and the reduction factor  is  3.   The  width  of  the
       background image will be the integer ratio (2507+2)/3.

   <b>Color</b> <b>RLE</b> <b>format</b>
       The  Color  RLE  format  is a simple run-length encoding scheme for color images with a limited number of
       distinct colors.  The data always begin with a text header composed  of  the  two  characters  "R6",  the
       number  of  columns,  the  number  of  rows,  and  the  number of color palette entries.  All numbers are
       expressed in decimal ASCII.  These four items are separated by blank  characters  (space,  tab,  carriage
       return,  or  linefeed)  or  by comment lines introduced by character "#".  The last number is followed by
       exactly one character which usually is a linefeed character.

       The header is followed by the color palette containing three bytes per color entry.  The bytes  represent
       the red, green, and blue components of the color.

       The  palette is followed by a collection of four bytes integers (most significant bit first) representing
       runs of pixels with an identical color.  The twelve upper bits of this integer indicate the index of  the
       run  color  in  the  palette entry.  The twenty lower bits of the integer indicate the run length.  Color
       indices greater than 0xff0 are reserved.  Color index 0xfff is used for transparent runs.   Each  row  is
       represented  by  a  sequence  of runs whose lengths add up to the image width.  Rows are encoded starting
       with the top row and progressing toward the bottom row.

   <b>Bitonal</b> <b>RLE</b> <b>format</b>
       The Bitonal RLE format is a simple run-length encoding scheme for bitonal images.  The data always  begin
       with  a  text  header composed of the two characters "R4", the number of columns, and the number of rows.
       All numbers are expressed in decimal ASCII.  These three items are separated by blank characters  (space,
       tab,  carriage  return, or linefeed) or by comment lines introduced by character "#".  The last number is
       followed by exactly one character which usually is a linefeed character.

       The rest of the file encodes a sequence of numbers  representing  the  lengths  of  alternating  runs  of
       transparent  and  black  pixels.  Lines are encoded starting with the top line and progressing toward the
       bottom line.  Each line starts with a white run. The decoder knows that a line is finished when  the  sum
       of  the  run lengths for that line is equal to the number of columns in the image.  Numbers in range 0 to
       191 are represented by a single byte in  range  0x00  to  0xbf.   Numbers  in  range  192  to  16383  are
       represented  by  a  two  byte  sequence:  the  first  byte,  in  range 0xc0 to 0xff, encodes the six most
       significant bits of the number, the second byte encodes the remaining eight  bits  of  the  number.  This
       scheme allows for runs of length zero, which are useful when a line starts with a black pixel, and when a
       very long run (whose length exceeds 16383) must be split into smaller runs.

   <b>Portable</b> <b>Pixmap</b> <b>(PPM)</b> <b>format</b>
       The  Portable  Pixmap  format is a well known format for representing color images.  Check the <b><a href="../man1/ppm.1.html">ppm</a></b>(1) man
       page for complete information.

       The data always begin with a text header composed of the two characters "P6", the number of columns,  the
       number  of  rows, and the maximal value of a color component (usually 255).  All numbers are expressed in
       decimal ASCII.  These three items are separated by blank characters  (space,  tab,  carriage  return,  or
       linefeed)  or  by  comment lines introduced by character "#".  The last number is followed by exactly one
       character which usually is a linefeed character.

       The rest of the file encodes all the pixels.  Each pixel is represented by three bytes  representing  the
       red, green and blue component of the pixel.  Pixels are ordered in left to right, top to bottom.

   <b>Comments</b> <b>in</b> <b>separated</b> <b>files</b>
       Each  page is followed by an arbitrary number of comment lines starting with character "#" and terminated
       by a linefeed character.  Certain comment lines have special meanings. In the following  constructs,  all
       the  strings are UTF-8 encoded and represent in the style of Postscript strings, that is, surrounded with
       parenthesis and using C-style escape sequences introduced by a backslash.

       *  <b>#</b> <b>T</b> <u>px</u><b>:</b><u>py</u> <u>dx</u><b>:</b><u>dy</u> <u>w</u><b>x</b><u>h</u><b>+</b><u>x</u><b>+</b><u>y</u> <b>(</b><u>string</u><b>)</b>
          Such a comment line indicates that the piece of text <u>string</u> must be associated with an  area  of  size
          <u>w</u>x<u>h</u>  at position <u>x</u>,<u>y</u> relative to the lower left corner of the page.  Integers <u>px</u>, and <u>py</u> represent the
          position of the current point on the text baseline before the text was drawn.  The  drawing  operation
          then  moves the current point by <u>dx</u>, and <u>dy</u> pixels.  When such comments are present, <b>csepdjvu</b> produces
          a hidden text layer for the corresponding pages.

       *  <b>#</b> <b>L</b> <u>w</u><b>x</b><u>h</u><b>+</b><u>x</u><b>+</b><u>y</u> <b>(</b><u>url</u><b>)</b>
          Such a comment line indicates that an hyperlink to url <u>url</u> should be associated with area of size  <u>w</u>x<u>h</u>
          at  position  <u>x</u>,<u>y</u>.   When  such comments are present, <b>csepdjvu</b> produces pages with an annotation chunk
          containing the specified hyperlinks.

       *  <b>#</b> <b>B</b> <u>count</u> <b>(</b><u>string</u><b>)</b> <b>(#</b><u>pageno</u><b>)</b>
          Such a comment line provides outline information for the document.  An outline entry  entitled  <u>string</u>
          is  associated  with  page  <u>pageno</u>.  Integer <u>count</u> indicates how many of the following outline entries
          must be attached to the current entry as subentries.  When such comments are present in the first page
          <b>csepdjvu</b> produces an navigation chunk with the specified outline.

       *  <b>#</b> <b>P</b> <b>(</b><u>string</u><b>)</b>
          Such a comment line provides a title <u>string</u> for the current page.
