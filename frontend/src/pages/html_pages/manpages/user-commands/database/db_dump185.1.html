       db_dump185 - dump DB 1.85 legacy database files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>db_dump185</b> [<b>-p</b>] [<b>-f</b> <b>output</b>] db_file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>db_dump185</u> utility reads the version 1.85 database file <u>db_file</u> and writes it to the standard output
       using a portable flat-text format understood by the <u><a href="../man1/db_load.1.html">db_load</a></u>(1) utility.  The argument <u>db_file</u> must  be  a
       file produced using the version 1.85 <u>DB</u> library functions.

       The options are as follows:

       <b>-f</b>   Write to the specified <u>file</u> instead of to the standard output.

       <b>-p</b>   If  characters  in  either the key or data items are printing characters (as defined by <u><a href="../man3/isprint.3.html">isprint</a></u>(3)),
            use printing characters in <u>file</u> to represent them.  This option permits users to use  standard  text
            editors to modify the contents of databases.

            Note,  different  systems  may  have  different  notions as to what characters are ``printing'', and
            databases dumped in this manner may be less portable to external systems.

       Dumping and reloading hash databases that use user-defined hash functions will result  in  new  databases
       that use the default hash function.  While using the default hash function may not be optimal for the new
       database, it will continue to work correctly.

       Dumping and reloading btree databases that use user-defined prefix or comparison functions will result in
       new  databases  that  use  the default prefix and comparison functions.  <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>case,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>quite</b> <b>likely</b>
       <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>database</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>damaged</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>repair</b> <b>permitting</b> <b>neither</b> <b>record</b> <b>storage</b> <b>or</b> <b>retrieval.</b>

       The only available workaround for either case is to modify the sources for the <u><a href="../man1/db_load.1.html">db_load</a></u>(1) utility to load
       the database using the correct hash, prefix and comparison functions.

       The <u>db_dump</u> utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FORMATS</b></h4><pre>
       There are two output formats used by <u>db_dump</u>.

       In both output formats, the first few lines of the  output  contain  header  information  describing  the
       underlying  access  method,  filesystem page size and other bookkeeping information.  This information is
       output in ``name=value'' pairs, where ``name'' may be any of the keywords listed in the <u><a href="../man1/db_load.1.html">db_load</a></u>(1) manual
       page, and ``value'' will be its value.  While this header information can be edited before  the  database
       is  reloaded,  there  is  rarely  any  reason  to  do so, as all of this information can be overridden by
       command-line arguments to <u>db_load</u>.

       Following the header information are the key/data pairs from the database.  If the database being  dumped
       is  of  type  <b>btree</b> or <b>hash</b>, the output will be paired lines of text, where the first line of the pair is
       the key item, and the second line of the pair is its corresponding data  item.   If  the  database  being
       dumped  is  of  type  <b>recno</b>, the output will be lines of text, where each line is a new data item for the
       database.

       If the <b>-p</b> option was specified, each output line will  consist  of  single  characters  representing  any
       characters  from  the  database  that were ``printing'', and backslash (``\'') escaped characters for any
       that were not.  Backslash characters appearing in the output mean one of two  things:  if  the  backslash
       character  precedes  another backslash character, it means that a literal backslash character occurred in
       the key or data item.  If the backslash character precedes any other character, the next  two  characters
       should  be  interpreted  as  hexadecimal  specification of a single character, e.g., ``\0a'' is a newline
       character in the ASCII character set.

       If the <b>-p</b> option was not specified, each output line will consist of paired hexadecimal values, e.g., the
       line ``726f6f74'' is the string ``root'' in the ASCII character set.

       In both output formats, a single newline character ends both the key and data items.

       The DB library is a family of groups of functions  that  provides  a  modular  programming  interface  to
       transactions  and  record-oriented  file access.  The library includes support for transactions, locking,
       logging and file page caching, as well as various indexed access methods.  Many of the functional  groups
       (e.g.,  the  file page caching functions) are useful independent of the other DB functions, although some
       functional groups are explicitly based on other functional groups (e.g., transactions and logging).

       <b>db4.3_stat</b> to distinguish between the multiple DB versions.)
