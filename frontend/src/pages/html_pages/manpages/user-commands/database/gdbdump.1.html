</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gdbdump - dump HP 100LX database into ASCII format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gdbdump</b> [<b>-noqswm</b>] <u>file</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gdbdump</b>  exports  the contents of an HP 100LX database into an ASCII form.  <u>file</u> is the name of the 100LX
       database to read; the results are written to the terminal and can be redirected or piped as needed.   The
       output format is suitable for input to many database packages as well as to <u><a href="../man1/gdbload.1.html">gdbload</a></u>(1).

   <b>Options</b>
       <b>gdbdump</b> recognizes the following options:

              <b>-n</b>     Suppress  the  first  line  of  the output, which normally contains the names of all of the
                     database fields.  Note that if this option is specified, the output is not compatible  with
                     <u><a href="../man1/gdbload.1.html">gdbload</a></u>(1).   However,  this  option  may  be  needed for compatibility with other database
                     programs trying to read the output.

              <b>-o</b>     Omit note fields from the output.  Note fields are included by default.

              <b>-q</b>     Suppress warning messages.

              <b>-s</b>     Write special characters (character codes 128-254, inclusive) directly to the output.   The
                     default is to represent such characters in \nnn notation.

              <b>-w</b>     Wrap  long  lines.   For  some  databases,  the  output line length can be larger than some
                     programs (notably <u><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></u>(1)) can handle, especially if records contain long notes.  This option
                     wraps each output line at about 75 characters, marking the end of  lines  to  be  continued
                     with a backslash (\).  <u><a href="../man1/gdbload.1.html">gdbload</a></u>(1) understands this format.

              <b>-m</b>     Write  multi-line  string (i.e. note) fields on multiple lines. Thus the quoted string will
                     span newlines. Without this option, newlines in strings will be output as  \r\n  sequences,
                     and the complete string will be subject to line wrapping if specified by the <b>-w</b> option.

   <b>Output</b> <b>Format</b> <b>Description</b>
       The  output of this program is an ASCII text file which starts with a line containing field names (unless
       <b>-n</b> was specified) and is followed by one line for each record of the database.  Note that  any  of  these
       lines may be split into multiple lines if <b>-w</b> is specified, and that newlines in strings may cause further
       splitting if specified by the <b>-m</b> option.  Each "logical" line contains all of the fields of the database,
       in  the  same  order in which their field names appeared on the first line of the output.  The fields are
       separated by commas.

       Exactly how each field appears in the output depends on its type.  Text fields, category fields, and note
       fields appear with the contents inside quote marks (").  Quote marks and backslashes within the  text  of
       the  field  are  escaped by preceding them with a backslash (\).  Newlines are printed as \n and carriage
       returns as \r, unless the <b>-m</b> option is used. Non-printing or non-ASCII characters as \nnn, where  nnn  is
       an octal character code.  (See the description of the <b>-s</b> flag, above.)

       Number fields appear as they do in the database.  Date fields appear in the format YYYYMMDD; for example,
       August  15,  1993  would  appear  as 19930815.  Time fields appear in the format HHMM, where HH is in the
       range 00-23.

       Radio buttons and check boxes appear as 1 if selected, 0 otherwise.

       All other field types, including application-defined types, are omitted from the output.

       This output format can be used as input to <u><a href="../man1/gdbload.1.html">gdbload</a></u>(1).

</pre><h4><b>WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gdbdump</b> cannot handle the application-defined records and fields in HP 100LX Appointment Book  and  World
       Time databases.  Running this program on such databases will give useful, but incomplete, output.

       Records are printed in the order stored in the file, i.e., randomly.

       This  program  cannot handle password-protected databases.  Attempts to dump password-protected databases
       will have unpredictable results.
