</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pg_dump - extract a PostgreSQL database into a script file or other archive file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>

       <b>pg_dump</b> [<u>connection-option</u>...] [<u>option</u>...] [<u>dbname</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       pg_dump is a utility for backing up a PostgreSQL database. It makes consistent backups even if the
       database is being used concurrently.  pg_dump does not block other users accessing the database (readers
       or writers).

       pg_dump only dumps a single database. To back up an entire cluster, or to back up global objects that are
       common to all databases in a cluster (such as roles and tablespaces), use <b><a href="../man1/pg_dumpall.1.html">pg_dumpall</a></b>(1).

       Dumps can be output in script or archive file formats. Script dumps are plain-text files containing the
       SQL commands required to reconstruct the database to the state it was in at the time it was saved. To
       restore from such a script, feed it to <b><a href="../man1/psql.1.html">psql</a></b>(1). Script files can be used to reconstruct the database even
       on other machines and other architectures; with some modifications, even on other SQL database products.

       The alternative archive file formats must be used with <b><a href="../man1/pg_restore.1.html">pg_restore</a></b>(1) to rebuild the database. They allow
       pg_restore to be selective about what is restored, or even to reorder the items prior to being restored.
       The archive file formats are designed to be portable across architectures.

       When used with one of the archive file formats and combined with pg_restore, pg_dump provides a flexible
       archival and transfer mechanism.  pg_dump can be used to backup an entire database, then pg_restore can
       be used to examine the archive and/or select which parts of the database are to be restored. The most
       flexible output file formats are the “custom” format (<b>-Fc</b>) and the “directory” format (<b>-Fd</b>). They allow
       for selection and reordering of all archived items, support parallel restoration, and are compressed by
       default. The “directory” format is the only format that supports parallel dumps.

       While running pg_dump, one should examine the output for any warnings (printed on standard error),
       especially in light of the limitations listed below.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following command-line options control the content and format of the output.

       <u>dbname</u>
           Specifies the name of the database to be dumped. If this is not specified, the environment variable
           <b>PGDATABASE</b> is used. If that is not set, the user name specified for the connection is used.

       <b>-a</b>
       <b>--data-only</b>
           Dump only the data, not the schema (data definitions). Table data, large objects, and sequence values
           are dumped.

           This option is similar to, but for historical reasons not identical to, specifying <b>--section=data</b>.

       <b>-b</b>
       <b>--large-objects</b>
       <b>--blobs</b> (deprecated)
           Include large objects in the dump. This is the default behavior except when <b>--schema</b>, <b>--table</b>, or
           <b>--schema-only</b> is specified. The <b>-b</b> switch is therefore only useful to add large objects to dumps
           where a specific schema or table has been requested. Note that large objects are considered data and
           therefore will be included when <b>--data-only</b> is used, but not when <b>--schema-only</b> is.

       <b>-B</b>
       <b>--no-large-objects</b>
       <b>--no-blobs</b> (deprecated)
           Exclude large objects in the dump.

           When both <b>-b</b> and <b>-B</b> are given, the behavior is to output large objects, when data is being dumped,
           see the <b>-b</b> documentation.

       <b>-c</b>
       <b>--clean</b>
           Output commands to <b>DROP</b> all the dumped database objects prior to outputting the commands for creating
           them. This option is useful when the restore is to overwrite an existing database. If any of the
           objects do not exist in the destination database, ignorable error messages will be reported during
           restore, unless <b>--if-exists</b> is also specified.

           This option is ignored when emitting an archive (non-text) output file. For the archive formats, you
           can specify the option when you call <b>pg_restore</b>.

       <b>-C</b>
       <b>--create</b>
           Begin the output with a command to create the database itself and reconnect to the created database.
           (With a script of this form, it doesn't matter which database in the destination installation you
           connect to before running the script.) If <b>--clean</b> is also specified, the script drops and recreates
           the target database before reconnecting to it.

           With <b>--create</b>, the output also includes the database's comment if any, and any configuration variable
           settings that are specific to this database, that is, any <b>ALTER</b> <b>DATABASE</b> <b>...</b> <b>SET</b> <b>...</b>  and <b>ALTER</b> <b>ROLE</b>
           <b>...</b> <b>IN</b> <b>DATABASE</b> <b>...</b> <b>SET</b> <b>...</b>  commands that mention this database. Access privileges for the database
           itself are also dumped, unless <b>--no-acl</b> is specified.

           This option is ignored when emitting an archive (non-text) output file. For the archive formats, you
           can specify the option when you call <b>pg_restore</b>.

       <b>-e</b> <u>pattern</u>
       <b>--extension=</b><u>pattern</u>
           Dump only extensions matching <u>pattern</u>. When this option is not specified, all non-system extensions
           in the target database will be dumped. Multiple extensions can be selected by writing multiple <b>-e</b>
           switches. The <u>pattern</u> parameter is interpreted as a pattern according to the same rules used by
           psql's \d commands (see Patterns), so multiple extensions can also be selected by writing wildcard
           characters in the pattern. When using wildcards, be careful to quote the pattern if needed to prevent
           the shell from expanding the wildcards.

           Any configuration relation registered by <b>pg_extension_config_dump</b> is included in the dump if its
           extension is specified by <b>--extension</b>.

               <b>Note</b>
               When <b>-e</b> is specified, pg_dump makes no attempt to dump any other database objects that the
               selected extension(s) might depend upon. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the results of a
               specific-extension dump can be successfully restored by themselves into a clean database.

       <b>-E</b> <u>encoding</u>
       <b>--encoding=</b><u>encoding</u>
           Create the dump in the specified character set encoding. By default, the dump is created in the
           database encoding. (Another way to get the same result is to set the <b>PGCLIENTENCODING</b> environment
           variable to the desired dump encoding.) The supported encodings are described in Section 23.3.1.

       <b>-f</b> <u>file</u>
       <b>--file=</b><u>file</u>
           Send output to the specified file. This parameter can be omitted for file based output formats, in
           which case the standard output is used. It must be given for the directory output format however,
           where it specifies the target directory instead of a file. In this case the directory is created by
           <b>pg_dump</b> and must not exist before.

       <b>-F</b> <u>format</u>
       <b>--format=</b><u>format</u>
           Selects the format of the output.  <u>format</u> can be one of the following:

           p
           plain
               Output a plain-text SQL script file (the default).

           c
           custom
               Output a custom-format archive suitable for input into pg_restore. Together with the directory
               output format, this is the most flexible output format in that it allows manual selection and
               reordering of archived items during restore. This format is also compressed by default.

           d
           directory
               Output a directory-format archive suitable for input into pg_restore. This will create a
               directory with one file for each table and large object being dumped, plus a so-called Table of
               Contents file describing the dumped objects in a machine-readable format that pg_restore can
               read. A directory format archive can be manipulated with standard Unix tools; for example, files
               in an uncompressed archive can be compressed with the gzip, lz4, or zstd tools. This format is
               compressed by default using gzip and also supports parallel dumps.

           t
           tar
               Output a <b>tar</b>-format archive suitable for input into pg_restore. The tar format is compatible with
               the directory format: extracting a tar-format archive produces a valid directory-format archive.
               However, the tar format does not support compression. Also, when using tar format the relative
               order of table data items cannot be changed during restore.

       <b>-j</b> <u>njobs</u>
       <b>--jobs=</b><u>njobs</u>
           Run the dump in parallel by dumping <u>njobs</u> tables simultaneously. This option may reduce the time
           needed to perform the dump but it also increases the load on the database server. You can only use
           this option with the directory output format because this is the only output format where multiple
           processes can write their data at the same time.

           pg_dump will open <u>njobs</u> + 1 connections to the database, so make sure your max_connections setting is
           high enough to accommodate all connections.

           Requesting exclusive locks on database objects while running a parallel dump could cause the dump to
           fail. The reason is that the pg_dump leader process requests shared locks (ACCESS SHARE) on the
           objects that the worker processes are going to dump later in order to make sure that nobody deletes
           them and makes them go away while the dump is running. If another client then requests an exclusive
           lock on a table, that lock will not be granted but will be queued waiting for the shared lock of the
           leader process to be released. Consequently any other access to the table will not be granted either
           and will queue after the exclusive lock request. This includes the worker process trying to dump the
           table. Without any precautions this would be a classic deadlock situation. To detect this conflict,
           the pg_dump worker process requests another shared lock using the NOWAIT option. If the worker
           process is not granted this shared lock, somebody else must have requested an exclusive lock in the
           meantime and there is no way to continue with the dump, so pg_dump has no choice but to abort the
           dump.

           To perform a parallel dump, the database server needs to support synchronized snapshots, a feature
           that was introduced in PostgreSQL 9.2 for primary servers and 10 for standbys. With this feature,
           database clients can ensure they see the same data set even though they use different connections.
           <b>pg_dump</b> <b>-j</b> uses multiple database connections; it connects to the database once with the leader
           process and once again for each worker job. Without the synchronized snapshot feature, the different
           worker jobs wouldn't be guaranteed to see the same data in each connection, which could lead to an
           inconsistent backup.

       <b>-n</b> <u>pattern</u>
       <b>--schema=</b><u>pattern</u>
           Dump only schemas matching <u>pattern</u>; this selects both the schema itself, and all its contained
           objects. When this option is not specified, all non-system schemas in the target database will be
           dumped. Multiple schemas can be selected by writing multiple <b>-n</b> switches. The <u>pattern</u> parameter is
           interpreted as a pattern according to the same rules used by psql's \d commands (see Patterns), so
           multiple schemas can also be selected by writing wildcard characters in the pattern. When using
           wildcards, be careful to quote the pattern if needed to prevent the shell from expanding the
           wildcards; see Examples below.

               <b>Note</b>
               When <b>-n</b> is specified, pg_dump makes no attempt to dump any other database objects that the
               selected schema(s) might depend upon. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the results of a
               specific-schema dump can be successfully restored by themselves into a clean database.

               <b>Note</b>
               Non-schema objects such as large objects are not dumped when <b>-n</b> is specified. You can add large
               objects back to the dump with the <b>--large-objects</b> switch.

       <b>-N</b> <u>pattern</u>
       <b>--exclude-schema=</b><u>pattern</u>
           Do not dump any schemas matching <u>pattern</u>. The pattern is interpreted according to the same rules as
           for <b>-n</b>.  <b>-N</b> can be given more than once to exclude schemas matching any of several patterns.

           When both <b>-n</b> and <b>-N</b> are given, the behavior is to dump just the schemas that match at least one <b>-n</b>
           switch but no <b>-N</b> switches. If <b>-N</b> appears without <b>-n</b>, then schemas matching <b>-N</b> are excluded from what
           is otherwise a normal dump.

       <b>-O</b>
       <b>--no-owner</b>
           Do not output commands to set ownership of objects to match the original database. By default,
           pg_dump issues <b>ALTER</b> <b>OWNER</b> or <b>SET</b> <b>SESSION</b> <b>AUTHORIZATION</b> statements to set ownership of created
           database objects. These statements will fail when the script is run unless it is started by a
           superuser (or the same user that owns all of the objects in the script). To make a script that can be
           restored by any user, but will give that user ownership of all the objects, specify <b>-O</b>.

           This option is ignored when emitting an archive (non-text) output file. For the archive formats, you
           can specify the option when you call <b>pg_restore</b>.

       <b>-R</b>
       <b>--no-reconnect</b>
           This option is obsolete but still accepted for backwards compatibility.

       <b>-s</b>
       <b>--schema-only</b>
           Dump only the object definitions (schema), not data.

           This option is the inverse of <b>--data-only</b>. It is similar to, but for historical reasons not identical
           to, specifying <b>--section=pre-data</b> <b>--section=post-data</b>.

           (Do not confuse this with the <b>--schema</b> option, which uses the word “schema” in a different meaning.)

           To exclude table data for only a subset of tables in the database, see <b>--exclude-table-data</b>.

       <b>-S</b> <u>username</u>
       <b>--superuser=</b><u>username</u>
           Specify the superuser user name to use when disabling triggers. This is relevant only if
           <b>--disable-triggers</b> is used. (Usually, it's better to leave this out, and instead start the resulting
           script as superuser.)

       <b>-t</b> <u>pattern</u>
       <b>--table=</b><u>pattern</u>
           Dump only tables with names matching <u>pattern</u>. Multiple tables can be selected by writing multiple <b>-t</b>
           switches. The <u>pattern</u> parameter is interpreted as a pattern according to the same rules used by
           psql's \d commands (see Patterns), so multiple tables can also be selected by writing wildcard
           characters in the pattern. When using wildcards, be careful to quote the pattern if needed to prevent
           the shell from expanding the wildcards; see Examples below.

           As well as tables, this option can be used to dump the definition of matching views, materialized
           views, foreign tables, and sequences. It will not dump the contents of views or materialized views,
           and the contents of foreign tables will only be dumped if the corresponding foreign server is
           specified with <b>--include-foreign-data</b>.

           The <b>-n</b> and <b>-N</b> switches have no effect when <b>-t</b> is used, because tables selected by <b>-t</b> will be dumped
           regardless of those switches, and non-table objects will not be dumped.

               <b>Note</b>
               When <b>-t</b> is specified, pg_dump makes no attempt to dump any other database objects that the
               selected table(s) might depend upon. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the results of a
               specific-table dump can be successfully restored by themselves into a clean database.

       <b>-T</b> <u>pattern</u>
       <b>--exclude-table=</b><u>pattern</u>
           Do not dump any tables matching <u>pattern</u>. The pattern is interpreted according to the same rules as
           for <b>-t</b>.  <b>-T</b> can be given more than once to exclude tables matching any of several patterns.

           When both <b>-t</b> and <b>-T</b> are given, the behavior is to dump just the tables that match at least one <b>-t</b>
           switch but no <b>-T</b> switches. If <b>-T</b> appears without <b>-t</b>, then tables matching <b>-T</b> are excluded from what
           is otherwise a normal dump.

       <b>-v</b>
       <b>--verbose</b>
           Specifies verbose mode. This will cause pg_dump to output detailed object comments and start/stop
           times to the dump file, and progress messages to standard error. Repeating the option causes
           additional debug-level messages to appear on standard error.

       <b>-V</b>
       <b>--version</b>
           Print the pg_dump version and exit.

       <b>-x</b>
       <b>--no-privileges</b>
       <b>--no-acl</b>
           Prevent dumping of access privileges (grant/revoke commands).

       <b>-Z</b> <u>level</u>
       <b>-Z</b> <u>method</u>[:<u>detail</u>]
       <b>--compress=</b><u>level</u>
       <b>--compress=</b><u>method</u>[:<u>detail</u>]
           Specify the compression method and/or the compression level to use. The compression method can be set
           to gzip, lz4, zstd, or none for no compression. A compression detail string can optionally be
           specified. If the detail string is an integer, it specifies the compression level. Otherwise, it
           should be a comma-separated list of items, each of the form keyword or keyword=value. Currently, the
           supported keywords are level and long.

           If no compression level is specified, the default compression level will be used. If only a level is
           specified without mentioning an algorithm, gzip compression will be used if the level is greater than
           0, and no compression will be used if the level is 0.

           For the custom and directory archive formats, this specifies compression of individual table-data
           segments, and the default is to compress using gzip at a moderate level. For plain text output,
           setting a nonzero compression level causes the entire output file to be compressed, as though it had
           been fed through gzip, lz4, or zstd; but the default is not to compress. With zstd compression, long
           mode may improve the compression ratio, at the cost of increased memory use.

           The tar archive format currently does not support compression at all.

       <b>--binary-upgrade</b>
           This option is for use by in-place upgrade utilities. Its use for other purposes is not recommended
           or supported. The behavior of the option may change in future releases without notice.

       <b>--column-inserts</b>
       <b>--attribute-inserts</b>
           Dump data as <b>INSERT</b> commands with explicit column names (INSERT INTO <u>table</u> (<u>column</u>, ...) VALUES ...).
           This will make restoration very slow; it is mainly useful for making dumps that can be loaded into
           non-PostgreSQL databases. Any error during restoring will cause only rows that are part of the
           problematic <b>INSERT</b> to be lost, rather than the entire table contents.

       <b>--disable-dollar-quoting</b>
           This option disables the use of dollar quoting for function bodies, and forces them to be quoted
           using SQL standard string syntax.

       <b>--disable-triggers</b>
           This option is relevant only when creating a data-only dump. It instructs pg_dump to include commands
           to temporarily disable triggers on the target tables while the data is restored. Use this if you have
           referential integrity checks or other triggers on the tables that you do not want to invoke during
           data restore.

           Presently, the commands emitted for <b>--disable-triggers</b> must be done as superuser. So, you should also
           specify a superuser name with <b>-S</b>, or preferably be careful to start the resulting script as a
           superuser.

           This option is ignored when emitting an archive (non-text) output file. For the archive formats, you
           can specify the option when you call <b>pg_restore</b>.

       <b>--enable-row-security</b>
           This option is relevant only when dumping the contents of a table which has row security. By default,
           pg_dump will set row_security to off, to ensure that all data is dumped from the table. If the user
           does not have sufficient privileges to bypass row security, then an error is thrown. This parameter
           instructs pg_dump to set row_security to on instead, allowing the user to dump the parts of the
           contents of the table that they have access to.

           Note that if you use this option currently, you probably also want the dump be in <b>INSERT</b> format, as
           the <b>COPY</b> <b>FROM</b> during restore does not support row security.

       <b>--exclude-extension=</b><u>pattern</u>
           Do not dump any extensions matching <u>pattern</u>. The pattern is interpreted according to the same rules
           as for <b>-e</b>.  <b>--exclude-extension</b> can be given more than once to exclude extensions matching any of
           several patterns.

           When both <b>-e</b> and <b>--exclude-extension</b> are given, the behavior is to dump just the extensions that
           match at least one <b>-e</b> switch but no <b>--exclude-extension</b> switches. If <b>--exclude-extension</b> appears
           without <b>-e</b>, then extensions matching <b>--exclude-extension</b> are excluded from what is otherwise a normal
           dump.

       <b>--exclude-table-and-children=</b><u>pattern</u>
           This is the same as the <b>-T</b>/<b>--exclude-table</b> option, except that it also excludes any partitions or
           inheritance child tables of the table(s) matching the <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>--exclude-table-data=</b><u>pattern</u>
           Do not dump data for any tables matching <u>pattern</u>. The pattern is interpreted according to the same
           rules as for <b>-t</b>.  <b>--exclude-table-data</b> can be given more than once to exclude tables matching any of
           several patterns. This option is useful when you need the definition of a particular table even
           though you do not need the data in it.

           To exclude data for all tables in the database, see <b>--schema-only</b>.

       <b>--exclude-table-data-and-children=</b><u>pattern</u>
           This is the same as the <b>--exclude-table-data</b> option, except that it also excludes data of any
           partitions or inheritance child tables of the table(s) matching the <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>--extra-float-digits=</b><u>ndigits</u>
           Use the specified value of <b>extra_float_digits</b> when dumping floating-point data, instead of the
           maximum available precision. Routine dumps made for backup purposes should not use this option.

       <b>--filter=</b><u>filename</u>
           Specify a filename from which to read patterns for objects to include or exclude from the dump. The
           patterns are interpreted according to the same rules as the corresponding options: <b>-t</b>/<b>--table</b>,
           <b>--table-and-children</b>, <b>-T</b>/<b>--exclude-table</b>, and <b>--exclude-table-and-children</b> for tables, <b>-n</b>/<b>--schema</b>
           and <b>-N</b>/<b>--exclude-schema</b> for schemas, <b>--include-foreign-data</b> for data on foreign servers,
           <b>--exclude-table-data</b> and <b>--exclude-table-data-and-children</b> for table data, and <b>-e</b>/<b>--extension</b> and
           <b>--exclude-extension</b> for extensions. To read from STDIN, use - as the filename. The <b>--filter</b> option
           can be specified in conjunction with the above listed options for including or excluding objects, and
           can also be specified more than once for multiple filter files.

           The file lists one object pattern per row, with the following format:

               { include | exclude } { extension | foreign_data | table | table_and_children | table_data | table_data_and_children | schema } <u>PATTERN</u>

           The first keyword specifies whether the objects matched by the pattern are to be included or
           excluded. The second keyword specifies the type of object to be filtered using the pattern:

           •   extension: extensions. This works like the <b>-e</b>/<b>--extension</b> or <b>--exclude-extension</b> option.

           •   foreign_data: data on foreign servers. This works like the <b>--include-foreign-data</b> option. This
               keyword can only be used with the include keyword.

           •   table: tables. This works like the <b>-t</b>/<b>--table</b> or <b>-T</b>/<b>--exclude-table</b> option.

           •   table_and_children: tables including any partitions or inheritance child tables. This works like
               the <b>--table-and-children</b> or <b>--exclude-table-and-children</b> option.

           •   table_data: table data of any tables matching <u>pattern</u>. This works like the <b>--exclude-table-data</b>
               option. This keyword can only be used with the exclude keyword.

           •   table_data_and_children: table data of any tables matching <u>pattern</u> as well as any partitions or
               inheritance children of the table(s). This works like the <b>--exclude-table-data-and-children</b>
               option. This keyword can only be used with the exclude keyword.

           •   schema: schemas. This works like the <b>-n</b>/<b>--schema</b> or <b>-N</b>/<b>--exclude-schema</b> option.

           Lines starting with # are considered comments and ignored. Comments can be placed after an object
           pattern row as well. Blank lines are also ignored. See Patterns for how to perform quoting in
           patterns.

           Example files are listed below in the Examples section.

       <b>--if-exists</b>
           Use DROP ... IF EXISTS commands to drop objects in <b>--clean</b> mode. This suppresses “does not exist”
           errors that might otherwise be reported. This option is not valid unless <b>--clean</b> is also specified.

       <b>--include-foreign-data=</b><u>foreignserver</u>
           Dump the data for any foreign table with a foreign server matching <u>foreignserver</u> pattern. Multiple
           foreign servers can be selected by writing multiple <b>--include-foreign-data</b> switches. Also, the
           <u>foreignserver</u> parameter is interpreted as a pattern according to the same rules used by psql's \d
           commands (see Patterns), so multiple foreign servers can also be selected by writing wildcard
           characters in the pattern. When using wildcards, be careful to quote the pattern if needed to prevent
           the shell from expanding the wildcards; see Examples below. The only exception is that an empty
           pattern is disallowed.

               <b>Note</b>
               Using wildcards in <b>--include-foreign-data</b> may result in access to unexpected foreign servers.
               Also, to use this option securely, make sure that the named server must have a trusted owner.

               <b>Note</b>
               When <b>--include-foreign-data</b> is specified, pg_dump does not check that the foreign table is
               writable. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the results of a foreign table dump can be
               successfully restored.

       <b>--inserts</b>
           Dump data as <b>INSERT</b> commands (rather than <b>COPY</b>). This will make restoration very slow; it is mainly
           useful for making dumps that can be loaded into non-PostgreSQL databases. Any error during restoring
           will cause only rows that are part of the problematic <b>INSERT</b> to be lost, rather than the entire table
           contents. Note that the restore might fail altogether if you have rearranged column order. The
           <b>--column-inserts</b> option is safe against column order changes, though even slower.

       <b>--load-via-partition-root</b>
           When dumping data for a table partition, make the <b>COPY</b> or <b>INSERT</b> statements target the root of the
           partitioning hierarchy that contains it, rather than the partition itself. This causes the
           appropriate partition to be re-determined for each row when the data is loaded. This may be useful
           when restoring data on a server where rows do not always fall into the same partitions as they did on
           the original server. That could happen, for example, if the partitioning column is of type text and
           the two systems have different definitions of the collation used to sort the partitioning column.

       <b>--lock-wait-timeout=</b><u>timeout</u>
           Do not wait forever to acquire shared table locks at the beginning of the dump. Instead fail if
           unable to lock a table within the specified <u>timeout</u>. The timeout may be specified in any of the
           formats accepted by <b>SET</b> <b>statement_timeout</b>. (Allowed formats vary depending on the server version you
           are dumping from, but an integer number of milliseconds is accepted by all versions.)

       <b>--no-comments</b>
           Do not dump comments.

       <b>--no-publications</b>
           Do not dump publications.

       <b>--no-security-labels</b>
           Do not dump security labels.

       <b>--no-subscriptions</b>
           Do not dump subscriptions.

       <b>--no-sync</b>
           By default, <b>pg_dump</b> will wait for all files to be written safely to disk. This option causes <b>pg_dump</b>
           to return without waiting, which is faster, but means that a subsequent operating system crash can
           leave the dump corrupt. Generally, this option is useful for testing but should not be used when
           dumping data from production installation.

       <b>--no-table-access-method</b>
           Do not output commands to select table access methods. With this option, all objects will be created
           with whichever table access method is the default during restore.

           This option is ignored when emitting an archive (non-text) output file. For the archive formats, you
           can specify the option when you call <b>pg_restore</b>.

       <b>--no-tablespaces</b>
           Do not output commands to select tablespaces. With this option, all objects will be created in
           whichever tablespace is the default during restore.

           This option is ignored when emitting an archive (non-text) output file. For the archive formats, you
           can specify the option when you call <b>pg_restore</b>.

       <b>--no-toast-compression</b>
           Do not output commands to set TOAST compression methods. With this option, all columns will be
           restored with the default compression setting.

       <b>--no-unlogged-table-data</b>
           Do not dump the contents of unlogged tables and sequences. This option has no effect on whether or
           not the table and sequence definitions (schema) are dumped; it only suppresses dumping the table and
           sequence data. Data in unlogged tables and sequences is always excluded when dumping from a standby
           server.

       <b>--on-conflict-do-nothing</b>
           Add ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING to <b>INSERT</b> commands. This option is not valid unless <b>--inserts</b>,
           <b>--column-inserts</b> or <b>--rows-per-insert</b> is also specified.

       <b>--quote-all-identifiers</b>
           Force quoting of all identifiers. This option is recommended when dumping a database from a server
           whose PostgreSQL major version is different from pg_dump's, or when the output is intended to be
           loaded into a server of a different major version. By default, pg_dump quotes only identifiers that
           are reserved words in its own major version. This sometimes results in compatibility issues when
           dealing with servers of other versions that may have slightly different sets of reserved words. Using
           <b>--quote-all-identifiers</b> prevents such issues, at the price of a harder-to-read dump script.

       <b>--rows-per-insert=</b><u>nrows</u>
           Dump data as <b>INSERT</b> commands (rather than <b>COPY</b>). Controls the maximum number of rows per <b>INSERT</b>
           command. The value specified must be a number greater than zero. Any error during restoring will
           cause only rows that are part of the problematic <b>INSERT</b> to be lost, rather than the entire table
           contents.

       <b>--section=</b><u>sectionname</u>
           Only dump the named section. The section name can be <b>pre-data</b>, <b>data</b>, or <b>post-data</b>. This option can be
           specified more than once to select multiple sections. The default is to dump all sections.

           The data section contains actual table data, large-object contents, and sequence values. Post-data
           items include definitions of indexes, triggers, rules, and constraints other than validated check
           constraints. Pre-data items include all other data definition items.

       <b>--serializable-deferrable</b>
           Use a serializable transaction for the dump, to ensure that the snapshot used is consistent with
           later database states; but do this by waiting for a point in the transaction stream at which no
           anomalies can be present, so that there isn't a risk of the dump failing or causing other
           transactions to roll back with a serialization_failure. See Chapter 13 for more information about
           transaction isolation and concurrency control.

           This option is not beneficial for a dump which is intended only for disaster recovery. It could be
           useful for a dump used to load a copy of the database for reporting or other read-only load sharing
           while the original database continues to be updated. Without it the dump may reflect a state which is
           not consistent with any serial execution of the transactions eventually committed. For example, if
           batch processing techniques are used, a batch may show as closed in the dump without all of the items
           which are in the batch appearing.

           This option will make no difference if there are no read-write transactions active when pg_dump is
           started. If read-write transactions are active, the start of the dump may be delayed for an
           indeterminate length of time. Once running, performance with or without the switch is the same.

       <b>--snapshot=</b><u>snapshotname</u>
           Use the specified synchronized snapshot when making a dump of the database (see Table 9.98 for more
           details).

           This option is useful when needing to synchronize the dump with a logical replication slot (see
           Chapter 47) or with a concurrent session.

           In the case of a parallel dump, the snapshot name defined by this option is used rather than taking a
           new snapshot.

       <b>--strict-names</b>
           Require that each extension (<b>-e</b>/<b>--extension</b>), schema (<b>-n</b>/<b>--schema</b>) and table (<b>-t</b>/<b>--table</b>) pattern
           match at least one extension/schema/table in the database to be dumped. This also applies to filters
           used with <b>--filter</b>. Note that if none of the extension/schema/table patterns find matches, pg_dump
           will generate an error even without <b>--strict-names</b>.

           This option has no effect on <b>--exclude-extension</b>, <b>-N</b>/<b>--exclude-schema</b>, <b>-T</b>/<b>--exclude-table</b>, or
           <b>--exclude-table-data</b>. An exclude pattern failing to match any objects is not considered an error.

       <b>--sync-method=</b><u>method</u>
           When set to fsync, which is the default, <b>pg_dump</b> <b>--format=directory</b> will recursively open and
           synchronize all files in the archive directory.

           On Linux, syncfs may be used instead to ask the operating system to synchronize the whole file system
           that contains the archive directory. See recovery_init_sync_method for information about the caveats
           to be aware of when using syncfs.

           This option has no effect when <b>--no-sync</b> is used or <b>--format</b> is not set to directory.

       <b>--table-and-children=</b><u>pattern</u>
           This is the same as the <b>-t</b>/<b>--table</b> option, except that it also includes any partitions or inheritance
           child tables of the table(s) matching the <u>pattern</u>.

       <b>--use-set-session-authorization</b>
           Output SQL-standard <b>SET</b> <b>SESSION</b> <b>AUTHORIZATION</b> commands instead of <b>ALTER</b> <b>OWNER</b> commands to determine
           object ownership. This makes the dump more standards-compatible, but depending on the history of the
           objects in the dump, might not restore properly. Also, a dump using <b>SET</b> <b>SESSION</b> <b>AUTHORIZATION</b> will
           certainly require superuser privileges to restore correctly, whereas <b>ALTER</b> <b>OWNER</b> requires lesser
           privileges.

       <b>-?</b>
       <b>--help</b>
           Show help about pg_dump command line arguments, and exit.

       The following command-line options control the database connection parameters.

       <b>-d</b> <u>dbname</u>
       <b>--dbname=</b><u>dbname</u>
           Specifies the name of the database to connect to. This is equivalent to specifying <u>dbname</u> as the
           first non-option argument on the command line. The <u>dbname</u> can be a connection string. If so,
           connection string parameters will override any conflicting command line options.

       <b>-h</b> <u>host</u>
       <b>--host=</b><u>host</u>
           Specifies the host name of the machine on which the server is running. If the value begins with a
           slash, it is used as the directory for the Unix domain socket. The default is taken from the <b>PGHOST</b>
           environment variable, if set, else a Unix domain socket connection is attempted.

       <b>-p</b> <u>port</u>
       <b>--port=</b><u>port</u>
           Specifies the TCP port or local Unix domain socket file extension on which the server is listening
           for connections. Defaults to the <b>PGPORT</b> environment variable, if set, or a compiled-in default.

       <b>-U</b> <u>username</u>
       <b>--username=</b><u>username</u>
           User name to connect as.

       <b>-w</b>
       <b>--no-password</b>
           Never issue a password prompt. If the server requires password authentication and a password is not
           available by other means such as a .pgpass file, the connection attempt will fail. This option can be
           useful in batch jobs and scripts where no user is present to enter a password.

       <b>-W</b>
       <b>--password</b>
           Force pg_dump to prompt for a password before connecting to a database.

           This option is never essential, since pg_dump will automatically prompt for a password if the server
           demands password authentication. However, pg_dump will waste a connection attempt finding out that
           the server wants a password. In some cases it is worth typing <b>-W</b> to avoid the extra connection
           attempt.

       <b>--role=</b><u>rolename</u>
           Specifies a role name to be used to create the dump. This option causes pg_dump to issue a <b>SET</b> <b>ROLE</b>
           <u>rolename</u> command after connecting to the database. It is useful when the authenticated user
           (specified by <b>-U</b>) lacks privileges needed by pg_dump, but can switch to a role with the required
           rights. Some installations have a policy against logging in directly as a superuser, and use of this
           option allows dumps to be made without violating the policy.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>PGDATABASE</b>
       <b>PGHOST</b>
       <b>PGOPTIONS</b>
       <b>PGPORT</b>
       <b>PGUSER</b>
           Default connection parameters.

       <b>PG_COLOR</b>
           Specifies whether to use color in diagnostic messages. Possible values are always, auto and never.

       This utility, like most other PostgreSQL utilities, also uses the environment variables supported by
       libpq (see Section 32.15).

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       pg_dump internally executes <b>SELECT</b> statements. If you have problems running pg_dump, make sure you are
       able to select information from the database using, for example, <b><a href="../man1/psql.1.html">psql</a></b>(1). Also, any default connection
       settings and environment variables used by the libpq front-end library will apply.

       The database activity of pg_dump is normally collected by the cumulative statistics system. If this is
       undesirable, you can set parameter <u>track_counts</u> to false via <b>PGOPTIONS</b> or the ALTER USER command.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       If your database cluster has any local additions to the template1 database, be careful to restore the
       output of pg_dump into a truly empty database; otherwise you are likely to get errors due to duplicate
       definitions of the added objects. To make an empty database without any local additions, copy from
       template0 not template1, for example:

           CREATE DATABASE foo WITH TEMPLATE template0;

       When a data-only dump is chosen and the option <b>--disable-triggers</b> is used, pg_dump emits commands to
       disable triggers on user tables before inserting the data, and then commands to re-enable them after the
       data has been inserted. If the restore is stopped in the middle, the system catalogs might be left in the
       wrong state.

       The dump file produced by pg_dump does not contain the statistics used by the optimizer to make query
       planning decisions. Therefore, it is wise to run <b>ANALYZE</b> after restoring from a dump file to ensure
       optimal performance; see Section 24.1.3 and Section 24.1.6 for more information.

       Because pg_dump is used to transfer data to newer versions of PostgreSQL, the output of pg_dump can be
       expected to load into PostgreSQL server versions newer than pg_dump's version.  pg_dump can also dump
       from PostgreSQL servers older than its own version. (Currently, servers back to version 9.2 are
       supported.) However, pg_dump cannot dump from PostgreSQL servers newer than its own major version; it
       will refuse to even try, rather than risk making an invalid dump. Also, it is not guaranteed that
       pg_dump's output can be loaded into a server of an older major version — not even if the dump was taken
       from a server of that version. Loading a dump file into an older server may require manual editing of the
       dump file to remove syntax not understood by the older server. Use of the <b>--quote-all-identifiers</b> option
       is recommended in cross-version cases, as it can prevent problems arising from varying reserved-word
       lists in different PostgreSQL versions.

       When dumping logical replication subscriptions, pg_dump will generate <b>CREATE</b> <b>SUBSCRIPTION</b> commands that
       use the connect = false option, so that restoring the subscription does not make remote connections for
       creating a replication slot or for initial table copy. That way, the dump can be restored without
       requiring network access to the remote servers. It is then up to the user to reactivate the subscriptions
       in a suitable way. If the involved hosts have changed, the connection information might have to be
       changed. It might also be appropriate to truncate the target tables before initiating a new full table
       copy. If users intend to copy initial data during refresh they must create the slot with two_phase =
       false. After the initial sync, the two_phase option will be automatically enabled by the subscriber if
       the subscription had been originally created with two_phase = true option.

       It is generally recommended to use the <b>-X</b> (<b>--no-psqlrc</b>) option when restoring a database from a
       plain-text pg_dump script to ensure a clean restore process and prevent potential conflicts with
       non-default psql configurations.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To dump a database called mydb into an SQL-script file:

           $ <b>pg_dump</b> <b>mydb</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>db.sql</b>

       To reload such a script into a (freshly created) database named newdb:

           $ <b>psql</b> <b>-X</b> <b>-d</b> <b>newdb</b> <b>-f</b> <b>db.sql</b>

       To dump a database into a custom-format archive file:

           $ <b>pg_dump</b> <b>-Fc</b> <b>mydb</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>db.dump</b>

       To dump a database into a directory-format archive:

           $ <b>pg_dump</b> <b>-Fd</b> <b>mydb</b> <b>-f</b> <b>dumpdir</b>

       To dump a database into a directory-format archive in parallel with 5 worker jobs:

           $ <b>pg_dump</b> <b>-Fd</b> <b>mydb</b> <b>-j</b> <b>5</b> <b>-f</b> <b>dumpdir</b>

       To reload an archive file into a (freshly created) database named newdb:

           $ <b>pg_restore</b> <b>-d</b> <b>newdb</b> <b>db.dump</b>

       To reload an archive file into the same database it was dumped from, discarding the current contents of
       that database:

           $ <b>pg_restore</b> <b>-d</b> <b>postgres</b> <b>--clean</b> <b>--create</b> <b>db.dump</b>

       To dump a single table named mytab:

           $ <b>pg_dump</b> <b>-t</b> <b>mytab</b> <b>mydb</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>db.sql</b>

       To dump all tables whose names start with emp in the detroit schema, except for the table named
       employee_log:

           $ <b>pg_dump</b> <b>-t</b> <b>'detroit.emp*'</b> <b>-T</b> <b>detroit.employee_log</b> <b>mydb</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>db.sql</b>

       To dump all schemas whose names start with east or west and end in gsm, excluding any schemas whose names
       contain the word test:

           $ <b>pg_dump</b> <b>-n</b> <b>'east*gsm'</b> <b>-n</b> <b>'west*gsm'</b> <b>-N</b> <b>'*test*'</b> <b>mydb</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>db.sql</b>

       The same, using regular expression notation to consolidate the switches:

           $ <b>pg_dump</b> <b>-n</b> <b>'(east|west)*gsm'</b> <b>-N</b> <b>'*test*'</b> <b>mydb</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>db.sql</b>

       To dump all database objects except for tables whose names begin with ts_:

           $ <b>pg_dump</b> <b>-T</b> <b>'ts_*'</b> <b>mydb</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>db.sql</b>

       To specify an upper-case or mixed-case name in <b>-t</b> and related switches, you need to double-quote the
       name; else it will be folded to lower case (see Patterns). But double quotes are special to the shell, so
       in turn they must be quoted. Thus, to dump a single table with a mixed-case name, you need something like

           $ <b>pg_dump</b> <b>-t</b> <b>"\"MixedCaseName\""</b> <b>mydb</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>mytab.sql</b>

       To dump all tables whose names start with mytable, except for table mytable2, specify a filter file
       filter.txt like:

           include table mytable*
           exclude table mytable2

           $ <b>pg_dump</b> <b>--filter=filter.txt</b> <b>mydb</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>db.sql</b>
