</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nfc-emulate-tag - Simple tag emulation command line demonstration tool

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nfc-emulate-tag</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nfc-emulate-tag</b> is a simple tag emulation tool that demonstrates how emulation can be done using libnfc.

       Currently,  this tool partially emulates a Mifare Mini: it is detected as Mifare Mini but internal MIFARE
       proprietary commands are not yet implemented.

       To be able to emulate a target, there are two main parts:
        - communication: handle modulation, anticollision, etc.
        - computation: process commands (input) and produce results (output).

       This demonstration tool proposes a logical structure to handle communication and  a  simple  function  to
       deal with computation.

       To  improve  the  target  capabilities,  we can now implement more allowed commands in a single function:
       target_io()

       Please note that, due to timing issues, it is very difficult to implement an  ISO14443-4  tag  this  way:
       RATS  request  expects  a quick ATS answer. By the way, even if you implement another kind of tag, timing
       issues are often the source of problems like CRC or parity errors.  The OmniKey CardMan 5321 is known  to
       be  very  large  on  timings  and  is  a  good choice if you want to experiment with this emulator with a
       tolerant reader.

</pre><h4><b>IMPORTANT</b></h4><pre>
       ACR122 devices (like touchatag, etc.) can be used by this example (with probably timing  issue),  but  if
       something  goes  wrong,  you  will  have  to  unplug/replug your device. This is not a <b>libnfc's</b> bug, this
       problem is due to ACR122's internal MCU in front of NFC chip (PN532).
