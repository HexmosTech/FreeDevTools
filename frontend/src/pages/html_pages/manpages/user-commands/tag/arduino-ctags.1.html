</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ctags - Generate tag files for source code

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ctags</b> [<b>options</b>] [<u>file(s)</u>]

       <b>etags</b> [<b>options</b>] [<u>file(s)</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>ctags</b> and <b>etags</b> programs (hereinafter collectively referred to as <b>ctags</b>, except where distinguished)
       generate an index (or "tag") file for a variety of language objects found  in  <u>file(s)</u>.   This  tag  file
       allows  these items to be quickly and easily located by a text editor or other utility. A "tag" signifies
       a language object for which an index entry is available (or, alternatively, the index entry  created  for
       that object).

       Alternatively, <b>ctags</b> can generate a cross reference file which lists, in human readable form, information
       about the various source objects found in a set of language files.

       Tag  index  files are supported by numerous editors, which allow the user to locate the object associated
       with a name appearing in a source file and jump to the file and line which defines the name. Those  known
       about at the time of this release are:

           <b><a href="../man1/Vi.1.html">Vi</a></b>(1)  and  its  derivatives (e.g. Elvis, Vim, Vile, Lemmy), <b>CRiSP</b>, <b>Emacs</b>, <b>FTE</b> (Folding Text Editor),
           <b>JED</b>, <b>jEdit</b>, <b>Mined</b>, <b>NEdit</b> (Nirvana Edit), <b>TSE</b> (The SemWare Editor), <b>UltraEdit</b>, <b>WorkSpace</b>, <b>X2</b>, <b>Zeus</b>

       <b>Ctags</b> is capable of generating different kinds of tags for  each  of  many  different  languages.  For  a
       complete list of supported languages, the names by which they are recognized, and the kinds of tags which
       are generated for each, see the <b>--list-languages</b> and <b>--list-kinds</b> options.

</pre><h4><b>SOURCE</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Unless  the  <b>--language-force</b>  option  is  specified,  the  language of each source file is automatically
       selected based upon a mapping of file names to languages. The mappings in effect for each language may be
       display using the <b>--list-maps</b> option and may be changed using the <b>--langmap</b> option.  On  platforms  which
       support  it, if the name of a file is not mapped to a language and the file is executable, the first line
       of the file is checked to see if the file is a "#!" script for a recognized language.

       By default, all other files names are ignored. This permits running <b>ctags</b> on all files in either a single
       directory (e.g. "ctags *"), or on all files in an entire source directory tree (e.g. "ctags  -R"),  since
       only those files whose names are mapped to languages will be scanned.

       [The reason that .h extensions are mapped to C++ files rather than C files is because it is common to use
       .h extensions in C++, and no harm results in treating them as C++ files.]

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Despite the wealth of available options, defaults are set so that <b>ctags</b> is most commonly executed without
       any  options  (e.g.  "ctags *", or "ctags -R"), which will create a tag file in the current directory for
       all recognized source files. The options described below are provided merely to allow custom tailoring to
       meet special needs.

       Note that spaces separating the single-letter options from their parameters are optional.

       Note also that the boolean parameters to the long form options (those beginning with "--" and that take a
       "<u>[=yes</u>|<u>no]</u>" parameter) may be omitted, in which case "<b>=</b><u>yes</u>" is implied. (e.g.  <b>--sort</b>  is  equivalent  to
       <b>--sort</b>=<u>yes</u>).  Note  further  that  "=<u>1</u>"  and  "=<u>on</u>" are considered synonyms for "=<u>yes</u>", and that "=<u>0</u>" and
       "=<u>off</u>" are considered synonyms for "=<u>no</u>".

       Some options are either ignored or useful only when used while running in etags  mode  (see  <b>-e</b>  option).
       Such options will be noted.

       Most options may appear anywhere on the command line, affecting only those files which follow the option.
       A few options, however, must appear before the first file name and will be noted as such.

       Options  taking  language  names  will  accept  those  names  in  either  upper  or  lower  case. See the
       <b>--list-languages</b> option for a complete list of the built-in language names.

       <b>-a</b>   Equivalent to <b>--append</b>.

       <b>-B</b>   Use backward searching patterns (e.g. ?pattern?). [Ignored in etags mode]

       <b>-e</b>   Enable etags mode, which will create a tag file for use with the Emacs  editor.   Alternatively,  if
            <b>ctags</b> is invoked by a name containing the string "etags" (either by renaming, or creating a link to,
            the executable), etags mode will be enabled. This option must appear before the first file name.

       <b>-f</b> <u>tagfile</u>
            Use  the  name  specified  by <u>tagfile</u> for the tag file (default is "tags", or "TAGS" when running in
            etags mode). If <u>tagfile</u> is specified as "-", then  the  tag  file  is  written  to  standard  output
            instead.  <b>Ctags</b>  will stubbornly refuse to take orders if <u>tagfile</u> exists and its first line contains
            something other than a valid tags line. This will save your neck if you mistakenly  type  "ctags  -f
            *.c", which would otherwise overwrite your first C file with the tags generated by the rest! It will
            also  refuse  to  accept a multi-character file name which begins with a '-' (dash) character, since
            this most likely means that you left out the tag file name and this option tried to  grab  the  next
            option  as  the  file  name.  If you really want to name your output tag file "-ugly", specify it as
            "./-ugly". This option must appear before the first file name. If this option is specified more than
            once, only the last will apply.

       <b>-F</b>   Use forward searching patterns (e.g. /pattern/) (default).  [Ignored in etags mode]

       <b>-h</b> <u>list</u>
            Specifies a list of file extensions, separated by periods, which are to be  interpreted  as  include
            (or  header) files. To indicate files having no extension, use a period not followed by a non-period
            character (e.g. ".", "..x", ".x."). This option only affects how the scoping of a  particular  kinds
            of  tags is interpreted (i.e. whether or not they are considered as globally visible or visible only
            within the file in which they are defined);  it  does  not  map  the  extension  to  any  particular
            language.  Any  tag  which is located in a non-include file and cannot be seen (e.g. linked to) from
            another file is considered to have file-limited (e.g. static) scope. No kind of tag appearing in  an
            include  file will be considered to have file-limited scope. If the first character in the list is a
            plus sign, then the extensions in the list will be appended to the current list; otherwise, the list
            will  replace  the  current  list.  See,  also,  the  <b>--file-scope</b>  option.  The  default  list   is
            ".h.H.hh.hpp.hxx.h++.inc.def".  To  restore  the  default  list, specify <b>-h</b> <u>default</u>. Note that if an
            extension supplied to this option is not already mapped to a particular language (see <b>SOURCE</b>  <b>FILES</b>,
            above), you will also need to use either the <b>--langmap</b> or <b>--language-force</b> option.

       <b>-I</b> <u>identifier-list</u>
            Specifies  a  list  of  identifiers which are to be specially handled while parsing C and C++ source
            files. This option is specifically provided to handle special  cases  arising  through  the  use  of
            preprocessor  macros.  When the identifiers listed are simple identifiers, these identifiers will be
            ignored during parsing of the source files. If an identifier is suffixed with a '+' character, <b>ctags</b>
            will also ignore any parenthesis-enclosed argument list which may immediately follow the  identifier
            in  the source files. If two identifiers are separated with the '=' character, the first identifiers
            is replaced by the second identifiers for parsing purposes. The list of identifiers may be  supplied
            directly  on  the  command  line  or  read  in  from  a  separate  file.  If  the first character of
            <u>identifier-list</u> is '@', '.' or a pathname separator ('/' or '´), or the first two characters specify
            a drive letter (e.g. "C:"), the parameter <u>identifier-list</u> will be interpreted  as  a  filename  from
            which  to  read  a  list of identifiers, one per input line. Otherwise, <u>identifier-list</u> is a list of
            identifiers (or identifier pairs) to be specially handled, each delimited by a either a comma or  by
            white  space  (in  which  case the list should be quoted to keep the entire list as one command line
            argument). Multiple <b>-I</b> options may be supplied.  To clear the list of ignore identifiers,  supply  a
            single dash ("-") for <u>identifier-list</u>.

            This  feature  is  useful  when preprocessor macros are used in such a way that they cause syntactic
            confusion due to their presence. Indeed, this is the best way of working around a number of problems
            caused by the presence of syntax-busting macros in source files (see <b>CAVEATS</b>, below). Some  examples
            will illustrate this point.

               int foo ARGDECL4(void *, ptr, long int, nbytes)

            In  the  above  example,  the macro "ARGDECL4" would be mistakenly interpreted to be the name of the
            function instead of the correct name of  "foo".  Specifying  <b>-I</b>  <u>ARGDECL4</u>  results  in  the  correct
            behavior.

               /* creates an RCS version string in module */
               MODULE_VERSION("$Revision: 690 $")

            In  the  above  example the macro invocation looks too much like a function definition because it is
            not followed by a semicolon (indeed, it could even be followed by a global variable definition  that
            would  look  much  like  a K&amp;R style function parameter declaration). In fact, this seeming function
            definition could possibly even cause the rest of the  file  to  be  skipped  over  while  trying  to
            complete the definition. Specifying <b>-I</b> <u>MODULE_VERSION+</u> would avoid such a problem.

               CLASS Example {
                   // your content here
               };

            The example above uses "CLASS" as a preprocessor macro which expands to something different for each
            platform.  For instance CLASS may be defined as "class __declspec(dllexport)" on Win32 platforms and
            simply "class" on UNIX.  Normally, the absence of the C++ keyword "class"  would  cause  the  source
            file to be incorrectly parsed. Correct behavior can be restored by specifying <b>-I</b> <u>CLASS=class</u>.

       <b>-L</b> <u>file</u>
            Read  from  <u>file</u>  a  list of file names for which tags should be generated.  If <u>file</u> is specified as
            "-", then file names are read from standard input. File names read using this option  are  processed
            following file names appearing on the command line. Options are also accepted in this input. If this
            option  is  specified  more than once, only the last will apply. <b>Note:</b> <u>file</u> is read in line-oriented
            mode, where a new line is the only delimiter and non-trailing white space is considered significant,
            in order that file names containing spaces  may  be  supplied  (however,  trailing  white  space  is
            stripped from lines); this can affect how options are parsed if included in the input.

       <b>-n</b>   Equivalent to <b>--excmd</b>=<u>number</u>.

       <b>-N</b>   Equivalent to <b>--excmd</b>=<u>pattern</u>.

       <b>-o</b> <u>tagfile</u>
            Equivalent to <b>-f</b> <u>tagfile</u>.

       <b>-R</b>   Equivalent to <b>--recurse</b>.

       <b>-u</b>   Equivalent to <b>--sort</b>=<u>no</u> (i.e. "unsorted").

       <b>-V</b>   Equivalent to <b>--verbose</b>.

       <b>-w</b>   This option is silently ignored for backward-compatibility with the ctags of SVR4 Unix.

       <b>-x</b>   Print a tabular, human-readable cross reference (xref) file to standard output instead of generating
            a  tag  file.  The  information contained in the output includes: the tag name; the kind of tag; the
            line number, file name, and source line (with extra white space condensed) of the file which defines
            the tag. No tag file is written and all options affecting tag file output will be  ignored.  Example
            applications  for  this  feature  are generating a listing of all functions located in a source file
            (e.g. <b>ctags</b> <b>-x</b> <b>--c-kinds</b>=<u>f</u> <u>file</u>), or generating a list of all externally  visible  global  variables
            located  in  a source file (e.g. <b>ctags</b> <b>-x</b> <b>--c-kinds</b>=<u>v</u> <b>--file-scope</b>=<u>no</u> <u>file</u>). This option must appear
            before the first file name.

       <b>--append</b>[=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>]
            Indicates whether tags generated from the specified  files  should  be  appended  to  those  already
            present  in  the  tag  file  or should replace them. This option is off by default. This option must
            appear before the first file name.

       <b>--etags-include</b>=<u>file</u>
            Include a reference to <u>file</u> in the tag file. This option may be specified as many times as  desired.
            This  supports Emacs' capability to use a tag file which "includes" other tag files. [Available only
            in etags mode]

       <b>--exclude</b>=[<u>pattern</u>]
            Add <u>pattern</u> to a list of excluded files and directories. This option may be specified as many  times
            as desired. For each file name considered by <b>ctags</b>, each <u>pattern</u> specified using this option will be
            compared  against both the complete path (e.g. some/path/base.ext) and the base name (e.g. base.ext)
            of the file, thus allowing patterns which match a given file name irrespective of its path, or match
            only a specific path. If appropriate support is  available  from  the  runtime  library  of  your  C
            compiler,  then  <u>pattern</u>  may  contain the usual shell wildcards (not regular expressions) common on
            Unix (be sure to quote the option parameter to protect the wildcards  from  being  expanded  by  the
            shell  before  being  passed  to  <b>ctags</b>; also be aware that wildcards can match the slash character,
            '/'). You can determine if shell wildcards are available on your platform by examining the output of
            the <b>--version</b> option, which will include "+wildcards"  in  the  compiled  feature  list;  otherwise,
            <u>pattern</u> is matched against file names using a simple textual comparison.

            If  <u>pattern</u> begins with the character '@', then the rest of the string is interpreted as a file name
            from which to read exclusion patterns, one per line. If <u>pattern</u>  is  empty,  the  list  of  excluded
            patterns  is  cleared.   Note  that  at program startup, the default exclude list contains "EIFGEN",
            "SCCS", "RCS", and "CVS", which are names of directories for which it is generally not desirable  to
            descend while processing the <b>--recurse</b> option.

       <b>--excmd</b>=<u>type</u>
            Determines the type of EX command used to locate tags in the source file.  [Ignored in etags mode]

            The valid values for <u>type</u> (either the entire word or the first letter is accepted) are:

            <u>number</u>   Use only line numbers in the tag file for locating tags. This has four advantages:
                     1.  Significantly reduces the size of the resulting tag file.
                     2.  Eliminates failures to find tags because the line defining the tag has changed, causing
                         the  pattern match to fail (note that some editors, such as <b>vim</b>, are able to recover in
                         many such instances).
                     3.  Eliminates finding identical matching, but incorrect, source lines (see <b>BUGS</b>, below).
                     4.  Retains separate entries in the tag file for lines which are identical in  content.  In
                         <u>pattern</u>  mode,  duplicate entries are dropped because the search patterns they generate
                         are identical, making the duplicate entries useless.

                     However, this option has one significant drawback: changes to the source  files  can  cause
                     the  line  numbers  recorded  in  the  tag file to no longer correspond to the lines in the
                     source file, causing jumps to some tags to miss the target definition by one or more lines.
                     Basically, this option is best used when the source code to which  it  is  applied  is  not
                     subject  to  change. Selecting this option type causes the following options to be ignored:
                     <b>-BF</b>.

            <u>pattern</u>  Use only search patterns for all tags, rather than the line numbers usually used for  macro
                     definitions.  This  has  the  advantage of not referencing obsolete line numbers when lines
                     have been added or removed since the tag file was generated.

            <u>mixed</u>    In this mode, patterns are generally used with a few exceptions. For C,  line  numbers  are
                     used for macro definition tags. This was the default format generated by the original <b>ctags</b>
                     and  is,  therefore, retained as the default for this option. For Fortran, line numbers are
                     used for common blocks because their corresponding source lines  are  generally  identical,
                     making pattern searches useless for finding all matches.

       <b>--extra</b>=<u>[+|-]flags</u>
            Specifies whether to include extra tag entries for certain kinds of information. The parameter <u>flags</u>
            is  a  set  of one-letter flags, each representing one kind of extra tag entry to include in the tag
            file. If <u>flags</u> is preceded by by either the '+' or '-' character, the effect of each flag  is  added
            to,  or removed from, those currently enabled; otherwise the flags replace any current settings. The
            meaning of each flag is as follows:

               <u>f</u>   Include an entry for the base file name of  every  source  file  (e.g.   "example.c"),  which
                   addresses the first line of the file.

               <u>q</u>   Include  an  extra  class-qualified  tag entry for each tag which is a member of a class (for
                   languages for which this information is extracted; currently  C++,  Eiffel,  and  Java).  The
                   actual  form  of  the  qualified tag depends upon the language from which the tag was derived
                   (using a form that is most natural for how qualified calls are specified  in  the  language).
                   For  C++,  it  is  in  the  form  "class::member";  for  Eiffel  and  Java, it is in the form
                   "class.member". This may allow easier location of a specific tags when  multiple  occurrences
                   of  a  tag  name  occur in the tag file. Note, however, that this could potentially more than
                   double the size of the tag file.

       <b>--fields</b>=<u>[+|-]flags</u>
            Specifies the available extension fields which are to be included in the entries  of  the  tag  file
            (see  <b>TAG</b>  <b>FILE</b>  <b>FORMAT</b>,  below,  for  more information). The parameter <u>flags</u> is a set of one-letter
            flags, each representing one type of  extension  field  to  include,  with  the  following  meanings
            (disabled by default unless indicated):

               <u>a</u>   Access (or export) of class members
               <u>f</u>   File-restricted scoping [enabled]
               <u>i</u>   Inheritance information
               <u>k</u>   Kind of tag as a single letter [enabled]
               <u>K</u>   Kind of tag as full name
               <u>l</u>   Language of source file containing tag
               <u>m</u>   Implementation information
               <u>n</u>   Line number of tag definition
               <u>s</u>   Scope of tag definition [enabled]
               <u>S</u>   Signature of routine (e.g. prototype or parameter list)
               <u>z</u>   Include the "kind:" key in kind field
               <u>t</u>   Type and name of a variable or typedef as "typeref:" field [enabled]

            Each  letter  or group of letters may be preceded by either '+' to add it to the default set, or '-'
            to exclude it. In the absence of any preceding '+' or '-' sign, only those kinds  explicitly  listed
            in <u>flags</u> will be included in the output (i.e. overriding the default set). This option is ignored if
            the option <b>--format</b>=<u>1</u> has been specified. The default value of this option is <u>fkst</u>.

       <b>--file-scope</b>[=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>]
            Indicates  whether tags scoped only for a single file (i.e. tags which cannot be seen outside of the
            file in which they are defined, such as "static" tags) should be included in the output. See,  also,
            the <b>-h</b> option. This option is enabled by default.

       <b>--filter</b>[=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>]
            Causes <b>ctags</b> to behave as a filter, reading source file names from standard input and printing their
            tags to standard output on a file-by-file basis. If <b>--sorted</b> is enabled, tags are sorted only within
            the  source file in which they are defined. File names are read from standard input in line-oriented
            input mode (see note for <b>-L</b> option) and only after file names listed on the command line or from any
            file supplied using the <b>-L</b> option. When this option is enabled, the options <b>-f</b>, <b>-o</b>, and <b>--totals</b> are
            ignored. This option is quite esoteric and is disabled by default. This option  must  appear  before
            the first file name.

       <b>--filter-terminator</b>=<u>string</u>
            Specifies a string to print to standard output following the tags for each file name parsed when the
            <b>--filter</b>  option is enabled. This may permit an application reading the output of ctags to determine
            when the output for each file is finished. Note that if the  file  name  read  is  a  directory  and
            <b>--recurse</b>  is enabled, this string will be printed only one once at the end of all tags found for by
            descending the directory. This string will always be separated from the last tag line for  the  file
            by its terminating newline.  This option is quite esoteric and is empty by default. This option must
            appear before the first file name.

       <b>--format</b>=<u>level</u>
            Change  the  format  of  the  output tag file. Currently the only valid values for <u>level</u> are <u>1</u> or <u>2</u>.
            Level 1 specifies the original tag  file  format  and  level  2  specifies  a  new  extended  format
            containing  extension  fields  (but  in  a manner which retains backward-compatibility with original
            <b><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></b>(1) implementations). The default level is 2. This option must appear before the first file  name.
            [Ignored in etags mode]

       <b>--help</b>
            Prints to standard output a detailed usage description, and then exits.

       <b>--if0</b>[=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>]
            Indicates  a  preference  as  to whether code within an "#if 0" branch of a preprocessor conditional
            should be examined for non-macro tags (macro tags are always included). Because the intent  of  this
            construct  is  to  disable  code, the default value of this option is <u>no</u>. Note that this indicates a
            preference only and does not guarantee skipping code within an "#if 0" branch, since  the  fall-back
            algorithm  used to generate tags when preprocessor conditionals are too complex follows all branches
            of a conditional. This option is disabled by default.

       <b>--&lt;LANG&gt;-kinds</b>=<u>[+|-]kinds</u>
            Specifies a list of language-specific kinds of tags (or kinds) to include in the output file  for  a
            particular language, where <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b> is case-insensitive and is one of the built-in language names (see
            the <b>--list-languages</b> option for a complete list). The parameter <u>kinds</u> is a group of one-letter flags
            designating kinds of tags (particular to the language) to either include or exclude from the output.
            The  specific  sets  of  flags recognized for each language, their meanings and defaults may be list
            using the <b>--list-kinds</b> option. Each letter or group of letters may be preceded by either '+' to  add
            it  to,  or '-' to remove it from, the default set. In the absence of any preceding '+' or '-' sign,
            only those kinds explicitly listed in <u>kinds</u> will be included in the  output  (i.e.   overriding  the
            default for the specified language).

            As  an  example for the C language, in order to add prototypes and external variable declarations to
            the default set of tag kinds, but exclude macros, use <b>--c-kinds</b>=<u>+px-d</u>;  to  include  only  tags  for
            functions, use <b>--c-kinds</b>=<u>f</u>.

       <b>--langdef</b>=<u>name</u>
            Defines a new user-defined language, <u>name</u>, to be parsed with regular expressions. Once defined, <u>name</u>
            may  be  used  in  other  options  taking language names. The typical use of this option is to first
            define the language, then map file names to it using <u>--langmap</u>,  then  specify  regular  expressions
            using <u>--regex-&lt;LANG&gt;</u> to define how its tags are found.

       <b>--langmap</b>=<u>map[,map[...]]</u>
            Controls  how  file names are mapped to languages (see the <b>--list-maps</b> option). Each comma-separated
            <u>map</u> consists of the language name (either a built-in or user-defined language), a colon, and a  list
            of  file  extensions  and/or  file  name  patterns.  A  file extension is specified by preceding the
            extension with a period (e.g. ".c"). A file name pattern is specified by enclosing  the  pattern  in
            parentheses  (e.g. "([Mm]akefile)"). If appropriate support is available from the runtime library of
            your C compiler, then the file name pattern may contain the usual shell wildcards common on Unix (be
            sure to quote the option parameter to protect the wildcards from being expanded by the shell  before
            being  passed  to  <b>ctags</b>).  You  can  determine if shell wildcards are available on your platform by
            examining the output of the <b>--version</b> option,  which  will  include  "+wildcards"  in  the  compiled
            feature  list;  otherwise,  the  file  name  patterns  are matched against file names using a simple
            textual comparison. When mapping a file  extension,  it  will  first  be  unmapped  from  any  other
            languages.

            If  the  first character in a map is a plus sign, then the extensions and file name patterns in that
            map will be appended to the current map for that language;  otherwise,  the  map  will  replace  the
            current  map. For example, to specify that only files with extensions of .c and .x are to be treated
            as C language files, use "<b>--langmap</b>=<u>c:.c.x</u>"; to also  add  files  with  extensions  of  .j  as  Java
            language  files,  specify  "<b>--langmap</b>=<u>c:.c.x,java:+.j</u>".  To  map  makefiles (e.g. files named either
            "Makefile", "makefile", or having the  extension  ".mak")  to  a  language  called  "make",  specify
            "<b>--langmap</b>=<u>make:([Mm]akefile).mak</u>".  To map files having no extension, specify a period not followed
            by  a  non-period character (e.g. ".", "..x", ".x."). To clear the mapping for a particular language
            (thus inhibiting automatic generation of tags for that language), specify an  empty  extension  list
            (e.g.   "<b>--langmap</b>=<u>fortran:</u>").  To  restore  the  default  language  mappings  for  all a particular
            language, supply the keyword "default" for the mapping.  To specify  restore  the  default  language
            mappings for all languages, specify "<b>--langmap</b>=<u>default</u>". Note that file extensions are tested before
            file name patterns when inferring the language of a file.

       <b>--language-force</b>=<u>language</u>
            By  default,  <b>ctags</b>  automatically selects the language of a source file, ignoring those files whose
            language cannot be determined (see <b>SOURCE</b> <b>FILES</b>, above). This option forces the  specified  <u>language</u>
            (case-insensitive;  either  built-in  or user-defined) to be used for every supplied file instead of
            automatically selecting the language based upon its extension. In addition, the special  value  <u>auto</u>
            indicates  that  the  language  should  be  automatically  selected (which effectively disables this
            option).

       <b>--languages</b>=<u>[+|-]list</u>
            Specifies the languages for which tag generation is enabled, with <u>list</u> containing a  comma-separated
            list of language names (case-insensitive; either built-in or user-defined). If the first language of
            <u>list</u>  is  not  preceded  by  either  a '+' or '-', the current list will be cleared before adding or
            removing the languages in <u>list</u>. Until a '-' is encountered, each language in the list will be  added
            to the current list. As either the '+' or '-' is encountered in the list, the languages following it
            are  added  or  removed  from the current list, respectively. Thus, it becomes simple to replace the
            current list with a new one, or to add or remove languages from the current list. The actual list of
            files for which tags will be generated depends upon the language extension mapping  in  effect  (see
            the  <b>--langmap</b> option). Note that all languages, including user-defined languages are enabled unless
            explicitly disabled using this option. Language names included in <u>list</u> may be any built-in  language
            or  one  previously  defined with <b>--langdef</b>. The default is "all", which is also accepted as a valid
            argument. See the <b>--list-languages</b> option for a complete list of the built-in language names.

       <b>--license</b>
            Prints a summary of the software license to standard output, and then exits.

       <b>--line-directives</b>[=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>]
            Specifies whether "#line" directives should be recognized.  These  are  present  in  the  output  of
            preprocessors  and  contain  the  line  number,  and  possibly the file name, of the original source
            file(s) from which the preprocessor output file was generated. When enabled, this option will  cause
            <b>ctags</b>  to  generate  tag  entries  marked  with  the  file names and line numbers of their locations
            original source file(s), instead of their actual locations in the preprocessor  output.  The  actual
            file  names  placed into the tag file will have the same leading path components as the preprocessor
            output file, since it is assumed that  the  original  source  files  are  located  relative  to  the
            preprocessor  output  file (unless, of course, the #line directive specifies an absolute path). This
            option is off by default. <b>Note:</b> This option is generally only useful when  used  together  with  the
            <b>--excmd</b>=<u>number</u>  (<b>-n</b>)  option.  Also,  you  may  have to use either the <b>--langmap</b> or <b>--language-force</b>
            option if the extension of the preprocessor output file is not known to <b>ctags</b>.

       <b>--links</b>[=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>]
            Indicates whether symbolic links (if supported) should be followed. When  disabled,  symbolic  links
            are ignored. This option is on by default.

       <b>--list-kinds</b>[=<u>language</u>|<u>all</u>]
            Lists  the  tag kinds recognized for either the specified language or all languages, and then exits.
            Each kind of tag recorded in the tag file is represented by a one-letter flag, which is also used to
            filter the tags placed into the output through use of the  <b>--&lt;LANG&gt;-kinds</b>  option.  Note  that  some
            languages  and/or tag kinds may be implemented using regular expressions and may not be available if
            regex support is not compiled into <b>ctags</b> (see  the  <b>--regex-&lt;LANG&gt;</b>  option).  Each  kind  listed  is
            enabled unless followed by "[off]".

       <b>--list-maps</b>[=<u>language</u>|<u>all</u>]
            Lists  the  file  extensions  and file name patterns which associate a file name with a language for
            either the specified language or all languages, and then exits. See the <b>--langmap</b> option, and <b>SOURCE</b>
            <b>FILES</b>, above.

       <b>--list-languages</b>
            Lists the names of the languages understood by <b>ctags</b>, and then exits.  These language names are case
            insensitive and may be used in the <b>--language-force</b>, <b>--languages</b>, <b>--&lt;LANG&gt;-kinds</b>, and <b>--regex-&lt;LANG&gt;</b>
            options.

       <b>--options</b>=<u>file</u>
            Read additional options from <u>file</u>. The file should contain one option per line. As a  special  case,
            if  <b>--options</b>=<u>NONE</u>  is  specified  as  the  first  option  on  the command line, it will disable the
            automatic reading of any configuration options from either a file or the environment (see <b>FILES</b>).

       <b>--recurse</b>[=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>]
            Recurse into directories encountered in the list of supplied files. If the list of supplied files is
            empty and no file list is specified with the <b>-L</b> option, then the current  directory  (i.e.  ".")  is
            assumed.  Symbolic  links are followed. If you don't like these behaviors, either explicitly specify
            the files or pipe the output of <b><a href="../man1/find.1.html">find</a></b>(1) into <b>ctags</b> <b>-L-</b> instead. <b>Note:</b> This option is  not  supported
            on  all  platforms  at  present.   It  is available if the output of the <b>--help</b> option includes this
            option.  See, also, the <b>--exclude</b> to limit recursion.

       <b>--regex-&lt;LANG&gt;</b>=<u>/regexp/replacement/[kind-spec/][flags]</u>
            The <u>/regexp/replacement/</u> pair define a regular expression replacement pattern, similar in  style  to
            <b>sed</b>  substitution  commands,  with  which  to  generate  tags  from source files mapped to the named
            language, <b>&lt;LANG&gt;</b>, (case-insensitive; either  a  built-in  or  user-defined  language).  The  regular
            expression, <u>regexp</u>, defines an extended regular expression (roughly that used by <b><a href="../man1/egrep.1.html">egrep</a></b>(1)), which is
            used to locate a single source line containing a tag and may specify tab characters using \t. When a
            matching line is found, a tag will be generated for the name defined by <u>replacement</u>, which generally
            will  contain  the  special back-references \1 through \9 to refer to matching sub-expression groups
            within <u>regexp</u>. The '/' separator characters shown in the parameter to the  option  can  actually  be
            replaced  by  any character. Note that whichever separator character is used will have to be escaped
            with a backslash ('´) character wherever it is used in the  parameter  as  something  other  than  a
            separator.  The  regular  expression  defined by this option is added to the current list of regular
            expressions for the specified language unless the parameter is omitted, in which  case  the  current
            list is cleared.

            Unless  modified  by  <u>flags</u>,  <u>regexp</u>  is  interpreted  as  a  Posix extended regular expression. The
            <u>replacement</u> should expand for all matching lines to a non-empty string of characters, or  a  warning
            message  will  be  reported.  An  optional  kind  specifier  for  tags  matching  <u>regexp</u>  may follow
            <u>replacement</u>, which will determine what kind of tag is reported in the "kind"  extension  field  (see
            <b>TAG</b>  <b>FILE</b>  <b>FORMAT</b>,  below). The full form of <u>kind-spec</u> is in the form of a single letter, a comma, a
            name (without spaces), a comma, a description, followed by a separator, which specify the short  and
            long  forms of the kind value and its textual description (displayed using <b>--list-kinds</b>). Either the
            kind name and/or the description may be omitted. If <u>kind-spec</u> is omitted, it defaults to  "<u>r,regex</u>".
            Finally,  <u>flags</u>  are  one  or  more  single-letter  characters  having the following effect upon the
            interpretation of <u>regexp</u>:

               <u>b</u>   The pattern is interpreted as a Posix basic regular expression.

               <u>e</u>   The pattern is interpreted as a Posix extended regular expression (default).

               <u>i</u>   The regular expression is to be applied in a case-insensitive manner.

            Note that this option is available only if <b>ctags</b> was compiled with support for regular  expressions,
            which  depends  upon your platform. You can determine if support for regular expressions is compiled
            in by examining the output of the <b>--version</b> option, which will  include  "+regex"  in  the  compiled
            feature list.

            For  more  information on the regular expressions used by <b>ctags</b>, see either the <b>regex(5,7)</b> man page,
            or the GNU info documentation for regex (e.g. "info regex").

       <b>--sort</b>[=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>|<u>foldcase</u>]
            Indicates whether the tag file should be sorted on the tag name (default  is  <u>yes</u>).  Note  that  the
            original <b><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></b>(1) required sorted tags.  The <u>foldcase</u> value specifies case insensitive (or case-folded)
            sorting.   Fast  binary  searches of tag files sorted with case-folding will require special support
            from tools using tag files, such as that found in the ctags readtags library, or Vim version 6.2  or
            higher  (using  "set  ignorecase").  This option must appear before the first file name. [Ignored in
            etags mode]

       <b>--tag-relative</b>[=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>]
            Indicates that the file paths recorded  in  the  tag  file  should  be  relative  to  the  directory
            containing the tag file, rather than relative to the current directory, unless the files supplied on
            the  command  line  are specified with absolute paths. This option must appear before the first file
            name. The default is <u>yes</u> when running in etags mode (see the <b>-e</b> option), <u>no</u> otherwise.

       <b>--totals</b>[=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>]
            Prints statistics about the source files read and the tag file written during the current invocation
            of <b>ctags</b>. This option is off by default.  This option must appear before the first file name.

       <b>--verbose</b>[=<u>yes</u>|<u>no</u>]
            Enable verbose mode. This prints out information on option processing and a brief message describing
            what action is being taken for each file considered by <b>ctags</b>. Normally, <b>ctags</b> does not read  command
            line  arguments until after options are read from the configuration files (see <b>FILES</b>, below) and the
            <b>CTAGS</b> environment variable. However, if this option is the first argument on the  command  line,  it
            will take effect before any options are read from these sources. The default is <u>no</u>.

       <b>--version</b>
            Prints  a  version  identifier  for  <b>ctags</b> to standard output, and then exits. This is guaranteed to
            always contain the string "Exuberant Ctags".

</pre><h4><b>OPERATIONAL</b> <b>DETAILS</b></h4><pre>
       As <b>ctags</b> considers each file name in turn, it tries to determine the language of the file by applying the
       following three tests in order: if the file extension has been mapped to a language,  if  the  file  name
       matches  a  shell  pattern mapped to a language, and finally if the file is executable and its first line
       specifies an interpreter using the Unix-style "#!" specification (if supported on  the  platform).  If  a
       language was identified, the file is opened and then the appropriate language parser is called to operate
       on the currently open file. The parser parses through the file and adds an entry to the tag file for each
       language object it is written to handle. See <b>TAG</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b>, below, for details on these entries.

       This  implementation  of <b>ctags</b> imposes no formatting requirements on C code as do legacy implementations.
       Older implementations of ctags tended to rely upon certain formatting assumptions in  order  to  help  it
       resolve coding dilemmas caused by preprocessor conditionals.

       In  general,  <b>ctags</b>  tries  to  be  smart  about  conditional  preprocessor directives. If a preprocessor
       conditional is encountered within a statement which defines a tag, <b>ctags</b> follows only the first branch of
       that conditional (except in the special case of "#if 0", in which case it follows only the last  branch).
       The  reason  for this is that failing to pursue only one branch can result in ambiguous syntax, as in the
       following example:

              #ifdef TWO_ALTERNATIVES
              struct {
              #else
              union {
              #endif
                  short a;
                  long b;
              }

       Both branches cannot be followed, or braces become unbalanced and <b>ctags</b> would be unable to make sense  of
       the syntax.

       If  the  application  of  this heuristic fails to properly parse a file, generally due to complicated and
       inconsistent pairing within the conditionals, <b>ctags</b> will retry the file using a different heuristic which
       does not selectively follow conditional preprocessor branches, but instead falls back to relying  upon  a
       closing  brace  ("}")  in column 1 as indicating the end of a block once any brace imbalance results from
       following a #if conditional branch.

       <b>Ctags</b> will also try to specially handle arguments lists enclosed in double sets of parentheses  in  order
       to accept the following conditional construct:

              extern void foo __ARGS((int one, char two));

       Any name immediately preceding the "((" will be automatically ignored and the previous name will be used.

       C++  operator  definitions  are  specially  handled. In order for consistency with all types of operators
       (overloaded and conversion), the operator name in the tag file will always  be  preceded  by  the  string
       "operator " (i.e. even if the actual operator definition was written as "operator&lt;&lt;").

       After creating or appending to the tag file, it is sorted by the tag name, removing identical tag lines.

</pre><h4><b>TAG</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       When not running in etags mode, each entry in the tag file consists of a separate line, each looking like
       this in the most general case:

        tag_name&lt;TAB&gt;file_name&lt;TAB&gt;ex_cmd;"&lt;TAB&gt;extension_fields

       The fields and separators of these lines are specified as follows:

           1.  tag name
           2.  single tab character
           3.  name of the file in which the object associated with the tag is located
           4.  single tab character
           5.  EX  command  used to locate the tag within the file; generally a search pattern (either /pattern/
               or ?pattern?) or line number (see <b>--excmd</b>). Tag file format 2  (see  <b>--format</b>)  extends  this  EX
               command  under  certain  circumstances  to  include  a  set of extension fields (described below)
               embedded in an EX comment immediately appended to the  EX  command,  which  leaves  it  backward-
               compatible with original <b><a href="../man1/vi.1.html">vi</a></b>(1) implementations.

       A few special tags are written into the tag file for internal purposes. These tags are composed in such a
       way  that they always sort to the top of the file.  Therefore, the first two characters of these tags are
       used a magic number to detect a tag file for purposes of determining whether a valid tag  file  is  being
       overwritten rather than a source file.

       Note  that  the  name  of  each source file will be recorded in the tag file exactly as it appears on the
       command line. Therefore, if the path you specified on the  command  line  was  relative  to  the  current
       directory, then it will be recorded in that same manner in the tag file. See, however, the <b>--tag-relative</b>
       option for how this behavior can be modified.

       Extension fields are tab-separated key-value pairs appended to the end of the EX command as a comment, as
       described  above.  These  key  value  pairs appear in the general form "<u>key</u>:<u>value</u>". Their presence in the
       lines of the tag file are controlled by the <b>--fields</b> option. The possible keys and the meaning  of  their
       values are as follows:

       <u>access</u>      Indicates the visibility of this class member, where <u>value</u> is specific to the language.

       <u>file</u>        Indicates that the tag has file-limited visibility. This key has no corresponding value.

       <u>kind</u>        Indicates  the type, or kind, of tag. Its value is either one of the corresponding one-letter
                   flags described under the various <b>--&lt;LANG&gt;-kinds</b>  options  above,  or  a  full  name.  It  is
                   permitted (and is, in fact, the default) for the key portion of this field to be omitted. The
                   optional behaviors are controlled with the <b>--fields</b> option.

       <u>implementation</u>
                   When present, this indicates a limited implementation (abstract vs. concrete) of a routine or
                   class,  where  <u>value</u>  is  specific  to  the  language  ("virtual"  or "pure virtual" for C++;
                   "abstract" for Java).

       <u>inherits</u>    When present, <u>value</u>. is a comma-separated list of classes from which this  class  is  derived
                   (i.e. inherits from).

       <u>signature</u>   When  present,  <u>value</u> is a language-dependent representation of the signature of a routine. A
                   routine signature in its complete form specifies the return type of a routine and its  formal
                   argument  list.  This  extension  field is presently supported only for C-based languages and
                   does not include the return type.

       In addition, information on the scope of the tag definition may be available, with the key portion  equal
       to  some  language-dependent  construct  name  and  its value the name declared for that construct in the
       program. This scope entry indicates the scope in which the tag was found. For example,  a  tag  generated
       for a C structure member would have a scope looking like "struct:myStruct".

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>TO</b> <b>USE</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>VI</b></h4><pre>
       Vi  will, by default, expect a tag file by the name "tags" in the current directory. Once the tag file is
       built, the following commands exercise the tag indexing feature:

       <b>vi</b> <b>-t</b> <b>tag</b>   Start vi and position the cursor at the file and line where "tag" is defined.

       <b>:ta</b> <b>tag</b>     Find a tag.

       <b>Ctrl-]</b>      Find the tag under the cursor.

       <b>Ctrl-T</b>      Return to previous location before jump to tag (not widely implemented).

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>TO</b> <b>USE</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>GNU</b> <b>EMACS</b></h4><pre>
       Emacs will, by default, expect a tag file by the name "TAGS" in the current directory. Once the tag  file
       is built, the following commands exercise the tag indexing feature:

       <b>M-x</b> <b>visit-tags-table</b> <b>&lt;RET&gt;</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>&lt;RET&gt;</b>
                 Select the tag file, "FILE", to use.

       <b>M-.</b> <b>[TAG]</b> <b>&lt;RET&gt;</b>
                 Find the first definition of TAG. The default tag is the identifier under the cursor.

       <b>M-*</b>       Pop back to where you previously invoked "M-.".

       <b>C-u</b> <b>M-.</b>   Find the next definition for the last tag.

       For more commands, see the <u>Tags</u> topic in the Emacs info document.

</pre><h4><b>HOW</b> <b>TO</b> <b>USE</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>NEDIT</b></h4><pre>
       NEdit version 5.1 and later can handle the new extended tag file format (see <b>--format</b>). To make NEdit use
       the tag file, select "File-&gt;Load Tags File". To jump to the definition for a tag, highlight the word, the
       press  Ctrl-D.  NEdit  5.1  can  can  read  multiple tag files from different directories.  Setting the X
       resource nedit.tagFile to the name of a tag file instructs NEdit to automatically load that tag  file  at
       startup time.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Because  <b>ctags</b>  is  neither a preprocessor nor a compiler, use of preprocessor macros can fool <b>ctags</b> into
       either missing tags or improperly generating inappropriate tags. Although  <b>ctags</b>  has  been  designed  to
       handle  certain  common  cases, this is the single biggest cause of reported problems. In particular, the
       use of preprocessor constructs which alter the textual syntax of C can fool <b>ctags</b>. You  can  work  around
       many such problems by using the <b>-I</b> option.

       Note  that  since  <b>ctags</b>  generates  patterns  for locating tags (see the <b>--excmd</b> option), it is entirely
       possible that the wrong line may be found by your editor if there exists another  source  line  which  is
       identical to the line containing the tag. The following example demonstrates this condition:

              int variable;

              /* ... */
              void foo(variable)
              int variable;
              {
                  /* ... */
              }

       Depending  upon  which  editor  you  use  and where in the code you happen to be, it is possible that the
       search pattern may locate the local parameter declaration in foo() before  it  finds  the  actual  global
       variable  definition,  since  the  lines (and therefore their search patterns are identical). This can be
       avoided by use of the <b>--excmd</b>=<u>n</u> option.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Ctags</b> has more options than <b><a href="../man1/ls.1.html">ls</a></b>(1).

       When parsing a C++ member  function  definition  (e.g.  "className::function"),  <b>ctags</b>  cannot  determine
       whether  the scope specifier is a class name or a namespace specifier and always lists it as a class name
       in the scope portion of the extension fields. Also, if a C++ function is defined  outside  of  the  class
       declaration  (the  usual  case),  the  access  specification  (i.e.  public,  protected,  or private) and
       implementation information (e.g. virtual, pure virtual) contained in the  function  declaration  are  not
       known when the tag is generated for the function definition. It will, however be available for prototypes
       (e.g <b>--c++-kinds</b>=<u>+p</u>).

       No qualified tags are generated for language objects inherited into a class.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>CTAGS</b>   If  this  environment  variable  exists,  it will be expected to contain a set of default options
               which are read when <b>ctags</b> starts, after the configuration files listed in <b>FILES</b>, below, are read,
               but before any command line options are read. Options appearing on the command line will override
               options specified in this variable. Only options will be read from this variable. Note  that  all
               white  space  in  this variable is considered a separator, making it impossible to pass an option
               parameter containing an embedded space. If this is a problem, use a configuration file instead.

       <b>ETAGS</b>   Similar to the <b>CTAGS</b> variable above, this variable, if found, will be read when <b>etags</b> starts.  If
               this variable is not found, <b>etags</b> will try to use <b>CTAGS</b> instead.

       <b>TMPDIR</b>  On  Unix-like  hosts  where  mkstemp()  is  available,  the  value of this variable specifies the
               directory in which to place temporary files. This can be useful if the size of a  temporary  file
               becomes  too  large  to  fit  on the partition holding the default temporary directory defined at
               compilation time.  <b>ctags</b> creates temporary files only if either (1) an emacs-style  tag  file  is
               being  generated,  (2)  the  tag  file  is  being sent to standard output, or (3) the program was
               compiled to use an internal sort algorithm to sort the tag files instead of the the sort  utility
               of  the  operating  system.  If  the  sort utility of the operating system is being used, it will
               generally observe this variable also. Note that if <b>ctags</b> is setuid, the value of TMPDIR  will  be
               ignored.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/ctags.cnf</u> <u>(on</u> <u>MSDOS,</u> <u>MSWindows</u> <u>only)</u>
       <u>/etc/ctags.conf</u>
       <u>/usr/local/etc/ctags.conf</u>
       <u>$HOME/.ctags</u>
       <u>$HOME/ctags.cnf</u> <u>(on</u> <u>MSDOS,</u> <u>MSWindows</u> <u>only)</u>
       <u>.ctags</u>
       <u>ctags.cnf</u> <u>(on</u> <u>MSDOS,</u> <u>MSWindows</u> <u>only)</u>
              If  any  of  these  configuration  files  exist, each will be expected to contain a set of default
              options which are read in the order listed when <b>ctags</b> starts, but  before  the  <b>CTAGS</b>  environment
              variable is read or any command line options are read. This makes it possible to set up site-wide,
              personal  or  project-level  defaults.  It  is  possible  to  compile  <b>ctags</b> to read an additional
              configuration file before any of those shown above, which will be indicated if the output produced
              by the  <b>--version</b>  option  lists  the  "custom-conf"  feature.  Options  appearing  in  the  <b>CTAGS</b>
              environment  variable  or on the command line will override options specified in these files. Only
              options will be read from these files. Note that the option files are read in  line-oriented  mode
              in  which  spaces  are significant (since shell quoting is not possible). Each line of the file is
              read as one command line parameter (as if it were quoted with single quotes). Therefore,  use  new
              lines to indicate separate command-line arguments.
