       opustags - Ogg Opus tag editor

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>opustags</b> <b>--help</b>
       <b>opustags</b> [<u>OPTIONS</u>] <u>INPUT</u>
       <b>opustags</b> <u>OPTIONS</u> <b>-i</b> <u>FILE</u>...
       <b>opustags</b> <u>OPTIONS</u> <b>-o</b> <u>OUTPUT</u> <u>INPUT</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>opustags</b>  can  read  and  edit  the comment header of an Ogg Opus file.  It has two modes: read-only, and
       read-write for tag editing.

       In read-only mode, only the beginning of <u>INPUT</u> is read, and the tags  are  printed  on  standard  output.
       Lines prefixed by tabs are continuation of the previous tag.  <u>INPUT</u> can either be the name of a file or <b>-</b>
       to  read from standard input.  You can use the options below to edit the tags before printing them.  This
       could be useful to preview some changes before writing them.

       In editing mode, you need to specify an output file with <b>--output</b>, or use  <b>--in-place</b>  to  overwrite  the
       input  files.  If  the output is a regular file, the result is first written to a temporary file and then
       moved to its final location on success. On error, the temporary output file is deleted.

       Tag editing can be performed with the <b>--add</b>, <b>--delete</b> and <b>--set</b> options. Options can be specified in  any
       order  and  don’t  conflict with each other.  First the specified tags are deleted, then the new tags are
       added.

       You can delete all the tags with <b>--delete-all</b>. This operation can be combined with <b>--add</b> to set new  tags
       without being bothered by the old ones.

       If  you  want to replace all the tags, you can use the <b>--set-all</b> option which will cause <b>opustags</b> to read
       tags from standard input.  The format  is  the  same  as  the  one  used  for  output:  newline-separated
       <u>FIELD=Value</u> assignment.  All the previously existing tags as deleted.

       The  Opus  format  specifications  requires  that  tags are encoded in UTF-8, so that's the only encoding
       opustags supports. If your system encoding is different, the tags are automatically converted to and from
       your system locale. When you edit an Opus file whose tags contains characters unsupported by your  system
       encoding, the original UTF-8 values will be preserved for the tags you don't explicitly modify.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Display a brief description of the options.

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--output</b> <u>FILE</u>
              Specify  the  output  file.   The  input  file  will be read, its tags edited, then written to the
              specified output file. If <u>FILE</u> is <b>-</b> then the resulting Opus  file  will  be  written  to  standard
              output.  The output file can’t be the same as the input file.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--in-place</b>
              Overwrite  the  input  file  instead of creating a separate output file. It has the same effect as
              setting <b>--output</b> to the same path as  the  input  file  and  enabling  <b>--overwrite</b>.   This  option
              conflicts with <b>--output</b>.

       <b>-y,</b> <b>--overwrite</b>
              By  default, <b>opustags</b> refuses to overwrite an already-existent file.  Use <b>-y</b> to allow overwriting.
              Note that this option is not needed when the output is a special file like <u>/dev/null</u>.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--delete</b> <u>FIELD[=VALUE]</u>
              If value is not specified, delete all the tags whose field name is <u>FIELD</u>.  Otherwise,  delete  all
              the  comments  whose  field  name is <u>FIELD</u> and value is <u>VALUE</u>.  In both cases, the field names are
              case-insensitive, and expected to be ASCII.

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--add</b> <u>FIELD=VALUE</u>
              Add a tag. Note that multiple tags with the same field name are perfectly acceptable, so  you  can
              add multiple fields with the same name, and previously existing tags will also be preserved.  When
              the <b>--delete</b> is used with the same <u>FIELD</u>, only the older tags are deleted.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--set</b> <u>FIELD=VALUE</u>
              This  option  is  provided  for  convenience.  It  delete all the fields of the same type that may
              already exist, then adds it with the wanted value.  This is strictly equivalent to <b>--delete</b>  <u>FIELD</u>
              <b>--add</b>  <u>FIELD=VALUE</u>. You can combine it with <b>--add</b> to add tags of the same type. As deletion occurs
              before adding, <b>--set</b> won’t erase the tags added with <b>--add</b>.

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--delete-all</b>
              Delete all the previously existing tags.

       <b>-S,</b> <b>--set-all</b>
              Sets the tags from scratch.  All the original tags are deleted and new ones are read from standard
              input.  Each line must specify a <u>FIELD=VALUE</u> pair and be separated with line feeds.   Empty  lines
              and lines starting with <u>#</u> are ignored.  Multiline tags must have their continuation lines prefixed
              by a single tab (in other words, every <u>\n</u> must be replaced by <u>\n\t</u>).

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--edit</b>
              Edit  tags interactively by spawning the program specified by the EDITOR environment variable. The
              allowed format is the same as <b>--set-all</b>.  If TERM and VISUAL are set, VISUAL takes precedence over
              EDITOR.

       <b>--output-cover</b> <u>FILE</u>
              Save the cover art of the input Opus file to the specified location.  If the input file  does  not
              contain  any  cover  art,  this  option  has no effect.  To allow overwriting the target location,
              specify <b>--overwrite</b>.  In the case of multiple pictures embedded in the Opus tags, only  the  first
              one  is  saved.   Note  that  the  since  the  image  format  is not fixed, you should consider an
              extension-less file name and rely on the magic number to deduce the type. opustags does not add or
              check the target file’s extension.  You can specify <b>-</b> for  standard  output,  in  which  case  the
              regular output will be suppressed.

       <b>--set-cover</b> <u>FILE</u>
              Replace  or  set  the  cover  art  to  the  specified picture.  Specify <b>-</b> to read the picture from
              standard input.  In theory, an Opus file may  contain  multiple  pictures  with  different  roles,
              though  in  practice  only  the front cover really matters. opustags can currently only handle one
              front cover and nothing else.

       <b>--vendor</b>
              Print the vendor string from the OpusTags packet and do nothing else. Standard tags operations are
              not supported when specifying this flag.

       <b>--set-vendor</b> <u>VALUE</u>
              Replace the vendor string by the specified value. This  action  can  be  performed  alongside  tag
              edition.

       <b>--raw</b>  OpusTags  metadata  should always be encoded in UTF-8, as per RFC 7845. However, some files may be
              corrupted or possibly even contain intentional binary data. In that case, --raw lets you edit that
              kind of binary data without ensuring the validity of the tags encoding. This option  may  also  be
              useful  when  your system encoding is different from UTF-8 and you wish to preserve the full UTF-8
              character set even though your system cannot display it.

       <b>-z</b>     When editing tags programmatically with  line-based  tools  like  grep  or  sed,  tags  containing
              newlines are likely to corrupt the result because these tools won’t interpret multi-line tags as a
              whole. To make automatic processing easier, <b>-z</b> delimits tags by a null byte (ASCII NUL) instead of
              line feeds. That same <b>-z</b> flag is also supported by GNU grep or GNU sed and, combined with opustags
              -z,  would  make them process the input tag-by-tag instead of line-by-line, thus supporting multi-
              line tags as well. This option also disables the TAB prefix for continuation lines  after  a  line
              feed.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       List all the tags in file foo.opus:

            opustags foo.opus

       Copy in.opus to out.opus, with the TITLE tag added:

            opustags in.opus --output out.opus --add "TITLE=Hello world!"

       Remove the previously existing ARTIST tags and add the two X and Y ARTIST tags, then display the new tags
       without writing them to the Opus file:

            opustags in.opus --add ARTIST=X --add ARTIST=Y --delete ARTIST

       Edit tags interactively in Vim:

            EDITOR=vim opustags --in-place --edit file.opus

       Replace all the tags in dest.opus with the ones from src.opus:

            opustags src.opus | opustags --in-place dest.opus --set-all

       Use GNU grep to remove all the CHAPTER* tags, with -z to support multi-line tags:

            opustags -z file.opus | grep -z -v ^CHAPTER | opustags -z --in-place file.opus --set-all

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>opustags</b> currently has the following limitations:

       •      Multiplexed streams are not supported.

       •      Control characters inside tags are printed raw rather than being escaped.

       Internally,  the  OpusTags  packet  in an Ogg Opus file may contain extra arbitrary binary data after the
       comments.  This block of data is currently not editable, but is always preserved. The  same  applies  for
       the vendor string.

       If  you need a feature not currently supported, feel free to open an issue or send an email with your use
       case.
