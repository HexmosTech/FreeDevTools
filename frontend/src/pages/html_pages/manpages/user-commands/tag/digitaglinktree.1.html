       digitaglinktree - Export tag structure of photos in digikam to the filesystem.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>digitaglinktree</b>

       <b>-l</b> <u>taglinkdir</u> | <b>-A</b> <u>archivedir</u>

       <b>-d</b> <u>database</u>

       <b>[-r</b> <u>rootdir]</u>

       <b>[-H|-f|-a|-v|-C]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>digitaglinktree</b>  will  create a linktree for all photos in a digikam database that have tags set on them.
       Tags (like eg. "family", "events", ...)  are used in digikam to create virtual folders containing  images
       that  all  have  one  or  more  tags assigned.  Please note: Photos that have no tags at all assigned are
       silently ignored by this script. The program will not modify or even touch your original  photos  managed
       by digikam.

       The  script  can  be used in two ways: If you call it using Option  -l <u>taglinkdir</u>  the script will create
       the user specified directory  <u>taglinkdir</u> and inside this directory it will  create  sub  directories  for
       digikam  tags   set  on  the  photos. Inside these subdirectories it will finally  place symbolic or hard
       links  (see -H) to photos having the tags in question.  As a result you will see the tags of your  photos
       as folders and in these folders you will find links to your original photos.

       In this way you can access the collection of all images that share a certain tag by changing directory to
       the  folder  with the tags name created by this script.  This allows you e.g. to run JAlbum a photo album
       software that needs to find the pictures to be put into a web album  in  the  filesystem  because  JAlbum
       cannot access digikams virtual folders directly.

       The second way of calling this script is the so called archive-mode by setting option  -A <u>archiveDir</u>.

       Archive  mode  is  thought  for  people  who want to archive tagged photos independently of digikams root
       directories and the photos therein.  This way you can put your photos and their tag structure  in  eg.  a
       tar  archive  and  send it  to a friend, who can look at the photos via their tag structure. In this mode
       the script creates the directory given as  parameter to -A and in this directory two more subdirectories.
       One named Photos and a second named Tags.  The Photos directory contains  hard  links  to  your  original
       photos,  and  the  Tags directory contains a subdirectory for each Tag used by any of your photos. Inside
       this subdirectory there are links (either symbolic or hard links) to the files in the  Photos  directory.
       This way the archive  directory needs nearly no additional space on your harddisk and you have an archive
       that  allows you or a friend to easily look at the photos tag structure.

       Another  benefit from using this script is that you have kind of a backup of your tag settings for all of
       your photos. The backup is simply the directory structure containing links to the  original  images  that
       wear  the tags.  This could become important if for whatever reason the digikam.db file gets corrupted or
       even lost.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
        <b>-l</b> <u>taglinkdir</u>
              Parameter  <u>taglinkdir</u> denotes a directory in which the tag structure of all your photos stored  in
              rootdir  will be exported to by creating subdirectories for each tag and placing symbolic links in
              these subdirectories that point to the original photo wearing the tags. If calling the script with
              option  -l <u>taglinkDir</u> you also have to  specify options -r  <u>rootdir</u> as well as -d <u>database</u>.

        <b>-A</b> <u>archivedirectory</u>
              <u>archivedirectory</u> denotes a directory into which the script will export the photos  and  their  tag
              structure. -A has to be used together with option  -r  <u>rootdir</u> if using digikam version &lt; 0.10, as
              well as -d <u>database</u> else the script will terminate.  Inside the archive  directory the script will
              create  a Photos and a Tags directory. It will put hard links in the  Photos directory  that point
              to your original photos. By using hard links you are independent  of changes in your digikam  root
              directory  but  on the other hand you are limited to one filesystem.  So the directory given by -r
              <u>rootdir</u> and the directory specified for -A <u>archivedir</u> have to be   one  the  same  filesystem.  If
              using  digikam  in  version  &gt;= 0.10 you cannot specify <u>-r</u> <u>rootdir</u> . Instead the root paths of all
              albums are taken from digikams database  directly.  However  still  the  requirement  holds,  that
              <u>archivedir</u>  has  to  be on the same filesystem like all the root directories containing photos you
              defined in digikam.  If one of digikams root directories is on another filesystem  this  one  will
              not  be processed, since hardlinking the photos inside the Photos directory would not work in this
              case!  The Tags subdirectory will contain links to the files in the Photos directory. This way you
              have one archive directory that is completely self contained. You can tar it, send it to a  friend
              or   just  put  it  somewhere  for  archival or backup purposes. Usually only those photos will be
              archived that have a digikam tag set on them. By  using  option  -C  however  you  can  perform  a
              complete archive. See -C for more infos.

        <b>-d</b> <u>database</u>
              <u>database</u>  is the complete path including the filename to digikams photo database which usually can
              be found in digikams root directory. The files name  is usually digikam.db .

        <b>-r</b> <u>rootdir</u>
              <u>rootdir</u> denotes the digikam base directory containing all your photos if you are using digikam  in
              a version before 0.10. If you are using digikam 0.10 or newer you must not use this option. If you
              do  it  anyway  you will see a hint that the option given will be ignored because digikams version
              0.10 database contains the root directories of all albums defined in digikam.

        <b>-C</b>    When the script is called with option -A <u>archivedir</u> only those photos will be archived (by placing
              links) in the Photos subdirectory of <u>archivedir</u> that have at least one digikam tag set. By setting
              option -C all photos will be  archived to  <u>archivedir</u> no matter if they have a  tag  set  or  not.
              Note:  This  only changes the contents of the Photos  subdirectory not of the Tags subdirectory in
              the <u>archivedir</u> directory.

        <b>-a</b>    By default the script will try to create relative symbolic links from  the  directory   <u>taglinkdir</u>
              set  by  option  -l  to  the  photo files under <u>rootdir</u> given by option -r. Using this option will
              result in  absolute symbolic links being created instead of relative ones.

        <b>-H</b>    By default the script will create soft (symbolic) links  from  the  Tag-Tree  to  the  photos.  By
              setting  option -H the script will use hard links instead. Please note that hard links can only be
              created inside one filesystem. So your photos and the Tag tree have to be one the same filesystem.
              If not you will see a warning about this problem and the script will not run.

        <b>-f</b>    In  digikam  photos  can  have  hierarchical  tags  (tags  that  have  subtags).  In   this   case
              digitaglinktree  would  by  default add a directory for the tag and a subdirectory for each of the
              subtags of this tag. By setting  <b>-f</b>  a subtag is treated like a regular tag just as its parent tag
              so digitaglinktree will create  all  subdirectories  for  tags  and  subtags  at  the  same  level
              independent of the tag - subtag hierarchy.

        <b>-Y</b>    Create  year  directory  under  each tag directory. Year information is taken from "Date taken" in
              database.

        <b>-i</b> <u>tag1,..,tagn</u>
              <u>tag1,..,tagn</u> Include only images with tags in the list. Use comma as  tag  separator.  Default  is
              "none". Use "all" to include all tags at once if you really want this. Better try a list with only
              some tags first to see how long it takes to complete.

        <b>-e</b> <u>tag1,..,tagn</u>
              <u>tag1,..,tagn</u> Exclude images with tags in the list. Use comma as tag separator. Default is "none".

        <b>-M</b> <u>level_number</u>
              <u>level_number</u>  specify the number of directory level. <u>-M</u> specifies that instead of following normal
              tag hierarchy, it creates a hierarchy combining different tags together and not  only  within  one
              tag hierarchy (for example combining Places and People tags).  You have to add tags to be included
              by  using the option -i (see above).  Depending on the level given and the number of tags you have
              included and how many photos you manage using digikam, this option may take a considerable  amount
              of  time  (possibly more than one  hour) to complete!  <u>level_number</u> of "5" seems to be the maximum
              reasonable level to start with in this mode.  Options -A -C -a -H -f not tested with this option!

        <b>-V</b>    Verbose mode.

        <b>-v</b>    Prints the scripts version number and exits.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       By default this script will run with all photo databases created by digikam version 0.10 as well as older
       version like 0.9 and 0.8. If you still have digikam version 0.7 then you have to reconfigure  the  script
       itself.

       You have to reconfigure the script by setting the path to the sqlite binary that is used by the script to
       query  the digikam database digikam.db. Since very old digikam version use sqlite in version 2, but later
       digikam versions need sqlite version 3 you have to take care to install the correct version of sqlite for
       the installed digikam version and to set the path to the correct sqlite executable in the scripts head:

       Choose

       $SQLITE="/usr/bin/sqlite3";

       for digikam version 0.8x and 0.9x and 0.10x

       $SQLITE="/usr/bin/sqlite";

       for digikam version 0.7x.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       A call to digitaglinktree is shown below:

       digiTagLinktree  -l /home/user/tags
                   -d /home/user/photos/digikam.db

       In this example we assume that you are running digikam version 0.10 or higher so that no  option  -r  was
       used  to specify the photo root dir. Instead this information will automatically be fetched from digikams
       database.

       In case you want to run the script on a digikam database that was  created  by  digikam  version  0.9  or
       earlier  you have to use -r to specify the root directory where you keep all your photos that are managed
       by digikam:

       digiTagLinktree -l /home/user/tags
                   -d /home/user/photos/digikam.db

       In this example digikams photo root denoted by -r is /home/user/photos.

       Option -l /home/user/tags tells the script that all the subdirectories and symbolic links will be  placed
       in  the directory /home/user/tags. The folder was chosen so that the tags-directory is not under digikams
       photo root. You may put the tags folder inside digikams photoroot but this is not the  preferred  method.
       Because  the  link directory contains only links this tag structure does hardly need any additional space
       on your harddisk.

       digiTagLinktree -r /home/user/photos -l /home/user/tags          -d /home/user/photos/digikam.db
                   -i People,Place
                   -M 2
                   -Y

       In this example if you have an image with the tags People/me, Place/home from 1970  it  will  create  the
       following directory (link to the image under _all directory)

       /home/user/tags/Date/1970/_all/

       /home/user/tags/Date/1970/People/me/_all/

       /home/user/tags/Date/1970/People/me/Place/home/_all/

       /home/user/tags/Date/1970/Place/home/_all/

       /home/user/tags/Date/1970/Place/home/People/me/_all/

       same starting with /Place ...  same starting with /People ...
