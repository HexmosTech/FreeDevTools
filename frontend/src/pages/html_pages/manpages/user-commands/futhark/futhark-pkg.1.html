</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       futhark-pkg - manage Futhark packages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       futhark pkg add PKGPATH [X.Y.Z]

       futhark pkg check

       futhark pkg init PKGPATH

       futhark pkg fmt

       futhark pkg remove PKGPATH

       futhark pkg sync

       futhark pkg upgrade

       futhark pkg versions

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  tool  is  used  to  modify the package manifest (<b>futhark.pkg</b>) and download the required packages it
       describes.  <b>futhark</b> <b>pkg</b> is not a build system; you will still need to compile your Futhark code with  the
       usual  compilers.   The  only  purpose  of  <b>futhark</b>  <b>pkg</b>  is  to download code (and perform other package
       management utility tasks).  This manpage is not a general introduction to package management in  Futhark;
       see the User’s Guide for that.

       The  <b>futhark</b>  <b>pkg</b>  subcommands will modify only two locations in the file system (relative to the current
       working directory): the <b>futhark.pkg</b> file, and the contents of <b>lib/</b>.  When  modifying  <b>lib/</b>,  <b>futhark</b>  <b>pkg</b>
       constructs  the  new  version in <b>lib~new/</b> and backs up the old version in <b>lib~old</b>.  If <b>futhark</b> <b>pkg</b> should
       fail for any reason, you can recover the old state by moving <b>lib~old</b> back.  These  temporary  directories
       are erased if <b>futhark</b> <b>pkg</b> finishes without errors.

       The  <b>futhark</b> <b>pkg</b> <b>sync</b> and <b>futhark</b> <b>pkg</b> <b>init</b> subcommands are the only ones that actually modifies <b>lib/</b>; the
       others modify only <b>futhark.pkg</b> and require you to manually run <b>futhark</b> <b>pkg</b> <b>sync</b> afterwards.

       Most commands take a <b>-v</b>/<b>--verbose</b> option that makes <b>futhark</b> <b>pkg</b> write running diagnostics to stderr.

       Packages must correspond to Git repositories, and all interactions are done by invoking <b>git</b>.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>futhark</b> <b>pkg</b> <b>add</b> <b>PKGPATH</b> <b>[X.Y.Z]</b>
       Add the specified package of the given minimum version as a requirement to <b>futhark.pkg</b>.  If no version is
       provided, the newest one is used.  If the package is already required in  <b>futhark.pkg</b>,  the  new  version
       requirement will replace the old one.

       Note that adding a package does not automatically download it.  Run <b>futhark</b> <b>pkg</b> <b>sync</b> to do that.

   <b>futhark</b> <b>pkg</b> <b>check</b>
       Verify that the <b>futhark.pkg</b> is valid, that all required packages are available in the indicated versions.
       This  command  does not check that these versions contain well-formed code.  If a package path is defined
       in <b>futhark.pkg</b>, also checks that <b>.fut</b> files are located at the expected location in the file system.

   <b>futhark</b> <b>pkg</b> <b>init</b> <b>PKGPATH</b>
       Create a new <b>futhark.pkg</b> defining a package with the given package path, and initially no requirements.

   <b>futhark</b> <b>pkg</b> <b>fmt</b>
       Reformat the <b>futhark.pkg</b> file, while retaining any comments.

   <b>futhark</b> <b>pkg</b> <b>remove</b> <b>PKGPATH</b>
       Remove a package from <b>futhark.pkg</b>.  Does <u>not</u> remove it from the <b>lib/</b> directory.

   <b>futhark</b> <b>pkg</b> <b>sync</b>
       Populate the <b>lib/</b> directory  with  the  packages  listed  in  <b>futhark.pkg</b>.   <b>Warning</b>:  this  will  delete
       everything  in  <b>lib/</b>  that  does  not  relate  to  a  file  listed  in  <b>futhark.pkg</b>, as well as any local
       modifications.

   <b>futhark</b> <b>pkg</b> <b>upgrade</b>
       Upgrade all package requirements in <b>futhark.pkg</b> to the newest available versions.

   <b>futhark</b> <b>pkg</b> <b>versions</b> <b>PKGPATH</b>
       Print all available versions for the given package path.

</pre><h4><b>COMMIT</b> <b>VERSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       It is possible to use <b>futhark</b> <b>pkg</b> with packages that have not yet made proper releases.  This is done via
       pseudoversions of the form <b>0.0.0-yyyymmddhhmmss+commitid</b>.  The timestamp  is  not  verified  against  the
       actual commit.  The timestamp ensures that newer commits take precedence if multiple packages depend on a
       commit  version  for  the same package.  If <b>futhark</b> <b>pkg</b> <b>add</b> is given a package with no releases, the most
       recent commit will be used.  In this case, the timestamp is merely set to the current time.

       Commit versions are awkward and fragile, and should not be relied  upon.   Issue  proper  releases  (even
       experimental 0.x version) as soon as feasible.  Released versions also always take precedence over commit
       versions, since any version number will be greater than 0.0.0.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Create a new package that will be hosted at <b>https://github.com/sturluson/edda</b>:

          futhark pkg init github.com/sturluson/edda

       Add a package dependency:

          futhark pkg add github.com/sturluson/hattatal

       Download the dependencies:

          futhark pkg sync

       And then you’re ready to start hacking!  (Except that these packages do not actually exist.)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Since  the <b>lib/</b> directory is populated with transitive dependencies as well, it is possible for a package
       to depend unwittingly on one of the dependencies  of  its  dependencies,  without  the  <b>futhark.pkg</b>  file
       reflecting this.

       There is no caching of package metadata between invocations, so the network traffic can be rather heavy.
