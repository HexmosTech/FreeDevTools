</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nvidia-persistenced - A daemon to maintain persistent software state in the NVIDIA driver.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nvidia-persistenced</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>nvidia-persistenced</b>  utility is used to enable persistent software state in the NVIDIA driver.  When
       persistence mode is enabled, the daemon prevents the driver from releasing device state when  the  device
       is not in use.  This can improve the startup time of new clients in this scenario.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Print the utility version and exit.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              Print usage information for the command line options and exit.

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Controls  how  much information is printed. By default, nvidia-persistenced will only print errors
              and warnings to syslog for unexpected events, as well as startup and shutdown notices.  Specifying
              this  flag  will  cause  nvidia-persistenced to also print notices to syslog on state transitions,
              such as when persistence mode is enabled or disabled, and informational messages  on  startup  and
              exit.

       <b>-u</b> <u>USERNAME</u><b>,</b> <b>--user=</b><u>USERNAME</u>
              Runs nvidia-persistenced with the user permissions of the user specified by the <u>USERNAME</u> argument.
              This  user must have write access to the /var/run/nvidia-persistenced directory. If this directory
              does not exist, nvidia-persistenced will attempt to create it prior to changing the  process  user
              and  group  IDs.  If  this option is not given, nvidia-persistenced will not attempt to change the
              process user ID.

       <b>-g</b> <u>GROUPNAME</u><b>,</b> <b>--group=</b><u>GROUPNAME</u>
              Runs nvidia-persistenced with the group permissions  of  the  group  specified  by  the  <u>GROUPNAME</u>
              argument.  If  both  this option and the --user option are given, this option will take precedence
              when determining the group ID to use. If this option is not given,  nvidia-persistenced  will  use
              the  primary group ID of the user specified by the --user option argument. If the --user option is
              also not given, nvidia-persistenced will not attempt to change the process group ID.

       <b>--persistence-mode,</b> <b>--no-persistence-mode</b>
              By default, nvidia-persistenced  starts  with  persistence  mode  enabled  for  all  devices.  Use
              '--no-persistence-mode' to force persistence mode off for all devices on startup.

       <b>--uvm-persistence-mode,</b> <b>--no-uvm-persistence-mode</b>
              By  default,  nvidia-persistenced  starts  with UVM persistence mode disabled for all devices. Use
              '--uvm-persistence-mode' to force UVM persistence mode on for supported  devices  on  startup.When
              UVM  persistence  mode  is  enabled, a GPU cannot enter thePCI-Express Runtime D3 (RTD3) low-power
              state. Please refer to theNVIDIA Accelerated Linux Graphics Driver  README  chapter  onPCI-Express
              Runtime  D3  (RTD3)  Power  Management. Enabling UVM persistence mode may result in additional GPU
              memory usage being reported, even when no applications are running.

       <b>--nvidia-cfg-path=</b><u>PATH</u>
              The nvidia-cfg library is used to communicate with the NVIDIA kernel module to  query  and  manage
              GPUs  in  the  system.  This  library  is  required  by  nvidia-persistenced.  This  option  tells
              nvidia-persistenced where to look for this library (in case it cannot find it on  its  own).  This
              option should normally not be needed.

</pre><h4><b>INSTALLATION</b></h4><pre>
       When  installed  by  <b>nvidia-installer</b>  ,  sample  init  scripts  to start the daemon for some of the more
       prevalent      init      systems      are      installed      as       the       compressed       tarball
       /usr/share/doc/NVIDIA_GLX-1.0/sample/nvidia-persistenced-init.tar.bz2.   These  init  scripts  should  be
       customized to the user's  distribution  and  installed  in  the  proper  location  by  the  user  to  run
       <b>nvidia-persistenced</b> on system initialization.

       Once  the  init  script  is  installed  so  that the daemon is running, users should not normally need to
       manually interact with <b>nvidia-persistenced:</b> the NVIDIA management  utilities,  such  as  <b>nvidia-smi,</b>  can
       communicate with it automatically as necessary to manage persistence mode.

       See  the  "Using  the nvidia-persistenced Utility" section of the NVIDIA Linux Graphics Driver README for
       more  background,  information  about  installing  the  <b>nvidia-persistenced</b>  utility  to  run  on  system
       initialization, and troubleshooting tips.

</pre><h4><b>PRIVILEGES</b></h4><pre>
       The  daemon does not require root privileges to run, and may safely be run as an unprivileged user, given
       that its runtime directory, /var/run/nvidia-persistenced, is created for and owned by that user prior  to
       starting  the  daemon.   <b>nvidia-persistenced</b>  also requires read and write access to the NVIDIA character
       device  files.   If  the  permissions  of  the  device  files  have  been  altered  through  any  of  the
       NVreg_DeviceFileUID,   NVreg_DeviceFile_GID,   or  NVreg_DeviceFileMode  NVIDIA  kernel  module  options,
       <b>nvidia-persistenced</b> will need to run as a suitable user.

       If the daemon is started with root privileges, the <b>--user</b> option may be used instead to indicate that the
       daemon should drop its privileges and run as the specified user after setting up its  runtime  directory.
       Using  this option may cause the daemon to be unable to remove the /var/run/nvidia-persistenced directory
       when it is killed, if the specified user does not have write permissions  to  /var/run.   In  this  case,
       directory  removal should be handled by a post-execution script.  See the sample init scripts provided in
       /usr/share/doc/NVIDIA_GLX-1.0/sample/nvidia-persistenced-init.tar.bz2 for examples of this behavior.

       The daemon indirectly utilizes <b>nvidia-modprobe</b> via the nvidia-cfg  library  to  load  the  NVIDIA  kernel
       module  and create the NVIDIA character device files after the daemon has dropped its root privileges, if
       it had any to begin with.  If <b>nvidia-modprobe</b> is not installed, the daemon  may  not  be  able  to  start
       properly if it is not run with root privileges.
