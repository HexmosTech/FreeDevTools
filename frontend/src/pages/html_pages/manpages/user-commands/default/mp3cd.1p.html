</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-s</b> <b>STAGE</b>, <b>--stage</b> <b>STAGE</b>
               Starts  processing  at  a given stage. This is used in case you had to stop processing, or a file
               was missing, or things generally blew up. It is especially useful if a burn  fails  because  then
               you  don't  have to start totally over and re-WAV the files. If you just want to perform a single
               step, use <b>--quit</b> to abort after the stage you request with <b>--stage</b>. Also see <b>--skip</b>.

               <b>clean</b>   This is the default starting stage. The temp directory is cleared  out.   A  playlist  is
                       required, since we expect to move to the <b>build</b> stage next, which requires it.

               <b>build</b>   This  stage  examines  the  playlist from the command line, and tries to create a list of
                       symlinks  from  the  given  playlist.  So  far,  "mp3cd"  can  understand  ".m3u"  files,
                       XMLPlaylist files, and lists of files.

               <b>decode</b>  All  the files are converted into WAVs. So far, "mp3cd" knows how to decode MP3, Ogg, and
                       FLAC files. (WAVs will be left as they are during this stage.)

               <b>correct</b> The WAV files are corrected to have the  correct  bitrate  and  number  of  channels,  as
                       required for an audio CD.

               <b>norm</b>    The  WAV files' volumes are normalized so any large differences in volume between records
                       will be less noticeable.

               <b>toc</b>     Generates a Table of Contents for the audio CD.

               <b>toc_ok</b>  Validates the TOC, just in case something went really wrong with the WAV files.

               <b>cdr_ok</b>  Verifies that there is a CDR ready for burning.

               <b>burn</b>    Actually performs the burn of all the WAV files to the waiting CDR.

       <b>-q</b>, <b>--quit</b>
               Aborts after one stage of processing. See <b>--stage</b>.

       <b>-t</b> <b>DIR</b>, <b>--tempdir</b> <b>DIR</b>
               Use a working directory other than "/tmp/mp3cd-<b>username</b>". This is where all the  file  processing
               occurs.  You  will  generally  need  at  least 650M free here (or more depending on the recording
               length of your destination CD).

       <b>-d</b> <b>PATH</b>, <b>--device</b> <b>PATH</b>
               Use a device path other than "/dev/cdrecorder".

       <b>-r</b> <b>TYPE</b>, <b>--driver</b> <b>TYPE</b>
               Use a CDRDAO driver other than what cdrdao automatically detects. Note that some drivers may  not
               support CD-TEXT mode. In this case, try "generic-mmc-raw".

       <b>-c</b> <b>ARGS</b>, <b>--cdrdao</b> <b>ARGS</b>
               Pass the given option string of ARGS to cdrdao during each command.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--simulate</b>
               Do not actually write to the disc but simulate the process instead.

       <b>-E</b>, <b>--no-eject</b>
               Don't eject drive after the burn.

       <b>-L</b>, <b>--no-log</b>
               Don't  redirect  output  to  "tool-output.txt". All information will instead be redirected to the
               terminal via standard output (STDOUT). This will cause a lot of low-level detail to be displayed.

       <b>-T</b>, <b>--no-cd-text</b>
               Don't attempt to write CD-TEXT tags to the audio CD. Some devices and drivers do not support this
               mode. See <b>--driver</b> for more details.

       <b>-S</b> <b>STAGES</b>, <b>--skip</b> <b>STAGES</b>
               While processing, skips the stages listed in the comma-separated list of stages given in  STAGES.
               This  would  only  be  used  if  you  really know what you're doing. For example, if the audio is
               already normalized and you didn't want to burn a CD, you could skip the normalizing  and  burning
               stages by giving "--skip norm,burn". See <b>--stage</b> and <b>--quit</b>.

       <b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b>
               Report which version of mp3cd this is.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--verbose</b>
               Shows commands as they are executed.

       <b>-h</b>, <b>--usage</b>
               Show brief usage summary.

       <b>--help</b>  Show detailed help summary.

       <b>--longhelp</b>
               Shows the full command line instructions.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This script implements the suggested methods outlined in the Linux MP3 CD Burning mini-HOWTO:
        &lt;<a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/MP3-CD-Burning/">http://tldp.org/HOWTO/MP3-CD-Burning/</a>&gt;

       This  will  burn a playlist (.m3u, XMLPlaylist or command line list) of MP3s, Oggs, FLACs, and/or WAVs to
       an audio CD. The ".m3u" format is really nothing more than a  list  of  fully  qualified  filenames.  The
       script  handles  making  the  WAVs  sane  by  resampling if needed, and normalizing the volume across all
       tracks.

       If a failure happens, earlier stages can be skipped with the '-s' flag.  The  file  "tool-output.txt"  in
       the  temp  directory  can  be  examined  to  see  what went wrong during the stage. Some things are time-
       consuming (like decoding the audio into WAVs) and if the CD burn fails, it's much nicer not  to  have  to
       start  over  from scratch. When doing this, you will not need the m3u file any more, since the files have
       already been built. See the list of stages using '-h'.

</pre><h4><b>PREREQUISITES</b></h4><pre>
       Requires "cdrdao", and that /dev/cdrecorder is a valid symlink to the /dev/sg  device  that  cdrdao  will
       use. Use .cdrdao to edit driver options. (See "man cdrdao" for details.)

       Requires "sox" to decode MP3 and check/correct WAV formats.
        <a href="http://www.spies.com/Sox/">http://www.spies.com/Sox/</a>

       Requires "normalize" to process the audio.
        <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~cvaill/normalize/">http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~cvaill/normalize/</a>

       Optionally requires "oggdec" to decode Ogg to WAV files.
        <a href="http://www.gnu.org/directory/audio/ogg/OggEnc.html/">http://www.gnu.org/directory/audio/ogg/OggEnc.html/</a>

       Optionally requires "flac" to decode flac to WAV files.
        <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/">http://flac.sourceforge.net/</a>

       Optionally requires "Config::Simple" Perl module if you want to use the .mp3cdrc file.
        <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~sherzodr/Config-Simple/">http://search.cpan.org/~sherzodr/Config-Simple/</a>

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="file:~/.mp3cdrc">~/.mp3cdrc</a></b>
               Default options can be recorded in this file. The option names are the same as their command line
               long-name.  Command  line  options will override these values. All options are run through perl's
               eval. For example:
                   tempdir: /scratch/mp3cd/$ENV{'USER'}
                   device: /dev/burner
