</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       user-session-migration - Migrate in-session user data.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>user-session-migration</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>user-session-migration</b> program can be used to migrate in-session user data when a program is evolving
       its configuration, or needing to have files moved and so on. This program is generally autostarted at the
       very beginning of the session and integrates caching capabilities.

       The  general usage is to ship an executable file in XDG_DATA_DIR/user-session-migration/scripts. This one
       will be executed the next time the user log into the session. It will executes all executable files there
       in ascii order, one after another.

       Even if the program tries to cache some timestamp and scripts to not be launched twiced (they are skipped
       on subsequent runs), the executables file should be idempotent.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--dry-run</b>
              This parameter enables to run the user-session-migration tool without really launching the scripts
              and marking them are migrated. It's generally used with --verbose for debugging purposes.

       <b>--file</b> <u>filename</u>
              This parameter, followed by a path or filename, tells  sesions-migration  to  only  consider  that
              script file and ignoring XDG_DATA_DIR. It won't log as well this special file as being migrated.

       <b>--help</b> Display a quick command help.

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Show a lot of verbose information. It can be used by the user to debug configuration issues;
