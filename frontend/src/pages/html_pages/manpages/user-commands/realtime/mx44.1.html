</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mx44 - polyphonic, multichannel midi realtime software synthesizer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mx44</b> [<u>VOICES</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>Mx44</u>  is  a  polyphonic multichannel midi realtime software synthesizer. It is written in C and hand
       optimized for the (Intel) MMX instruction set. It  runs  under  Linux,  using  any  kernel  modified  for
       realtime performance. The sourcecode is licensed under GPL.

       The core algorithm is a  4 x 4 crossmodulating matrix (phase and amplitude) with individual envelopes for
       each  oscillator.  Oscillators have individual frequency intonation, can emphasize any of the eight first
       harmonics and even do some internal crossmodulation. Envelopes can be switched between VCA and VCF  modes
       (ehrm,  actually  wawe-shaping,  but it will quack like a duck by any other name.) The sustainloop of the
       envelope can be brought into oscillation in the audible spectre as well as provide slow LFO sweeps. There
       is also a minor load of  key  and  velocity  related  modifications  for  wowie  zowie  realtime  ecstacy
       emulation.

       It  is  very  good  for  esoteric  pads and ultra electric leads. I use it all the time together with the
       Rosegarden sequencer or some of my old Atari toys (like M!). I don't think you can make it sound  like  a
       realistic grand piano though, but then again: Somebody out there, please prove me wrong. ;-)

       A  166  Mhz  Pentium  will provide you with 20 simultanious voices, whereas a 400 Mhz Pentium II can with
       ease provide you with 88 simultanious voices. My current 1.1Ghz Celery occasionally runs 200 voices  (800
       oscillators).  That  ought to be enough for most people. Write any number after the command to change the
       48 voice default.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>VOICES</u>  Sets the maximum number of voices. Default is 48.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Mx44's only data file is stored in /usr/share/mx44, and is copied to <b>$HOME</b>/.mx44/ when the user  launches
       the wrapper script. This allows users to make changes to the patches.

</pre><h4><b>SUGGESTIONS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>BUG</b> <b>REPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       Any bugs found should be reported to the upstream author and/or package maintainer.
