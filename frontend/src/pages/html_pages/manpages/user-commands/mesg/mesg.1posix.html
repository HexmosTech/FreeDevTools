</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mesg — permit or deny messages

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       mesg <b>[</b>y|n<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>mesg</u> utility shall control whether other users are allowed to send messages via <u>write</u>, <u>talk</u>, or other
       utilities  to  a  terminal  device. The terminal device affected shall be determined by searching for the
       first terminal in the sequence of devices associated with standard input, standard output,  and  standard
       error,  respectively.  With  no  arguments,  <u>mesg</u>  shall  report  the  current state without changing it.
       Processes with appropriate privileges may be able to send messages to the  terminal  independent  of  the
       current state.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported in the POSIX locale:

       <u>y</u>         Grant permission to other users to send messages to the terminal device.

       <u>n</u>         Deny permission to other users to send messages to the terminal device.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       Not used.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>mesg</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base  Definitions  volume  of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u> <u>Variables</u> for the
                 precedence  of  internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values   of   locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If  set  to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine the locale for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text  data  as  characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine  the  locale  that  should  be  used  to affect the format and contents of diagnostic
                 messages written (by <u>mesg</u>) to standard error.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       If no operand is specified, <u>mesg</u> shall display the current terminal state in an unspecified format.

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXTENDED</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The following exit values shall be returned:

        0    Receiving messages is allowed.

        1    Receiving messages is not allowed.

       &gt;1    An error occurred.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The mechanism by which the  message  status  of  the  terminal  is  changed  is  unspecified.  Therefore,
       unspecified actions may cause the status of the terminal to change after <u>mesg</u> has successfully completed.
       These  actions  may  include,  but  are  not  limited  to:  another invocation of the <u>mesg</u> utility, login
       procedures; invocation of the <u>stty</u> utility, invocation of the <u>chmod</u> utility or <u>chmod</u>() function,  and  so
       on.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       None.

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The  terminal  changed  by <u>mesg</u> is that associated with the standard input, output, or error, rather than
       the controlling terminal for the session. This is because users logged in more than once should  be  able
       to change any of their login terminals without having to stop the job running in those sessions.  This is
       not  a  security  problem  involving the terminals of other users because appropriate privileges would be
       required to affect the terminal of another user.

       The method of checking each of the first three file descriptors in sequence until a terminal is found was
       adopted from System V.

       The file <b>/dev/tty</b> is not specified for the terminal device because it was thought to be too  restrictive.
       Typical environment changes for the <u>n</u> operand are that write permissions are removed for <u>others</u> and <u>group</u>
       from  the  appropriate  device.  It  was  decided  to  leave  the  actual  description of what is done as
       unspecified because of potential differences between implementations.

       The format for standard output is unspecified because of differences between historical  implementations.
       This  output is generally not useful to shell scripts (they can use the exit status), so exact parsing of
       the output is unnecessary.

</pre><h4><b>FUTURE</b> <b>DIRECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       None.
