</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>tse3play</b>  plays TSE3MDL files and MIDI files using the TSE3 sequencer engine. It was originally developed
       as a test application for the TSE3 engine, but is now a fully featured playback application.

       <b>tse3play</b> can also convert files between the two supported formats. Whilst playing it provides text  based
       visual feedback, or can stream an English representation of the contents of the file to standard output.

       <u>MIDI</u>  <u>files</u>  are  a  standard  file  format  for  the storage of musical (song) data that can be found in
       abundance on the internet. They don't contain the actual  sounds  played,  but  instructions  on  how  to
       recreate  the song (i.e. start note/stop note commands). MIDI files are most often created by a <u>sequencer</u>
       application (akin to a word processor for music). MIDI files often have the extension .mid or .midi

       <u>TSE3MDL</u> ( <u>TSE3</u> <u>Music</u> <u>Description</u> <u>Language</u> ) files are a similar form of music file. They are  created  by
       sequencer  applications based on the TSE3 sequencer engine library. The file format contains a great deal
       more information and harnesses the full power of the TSE3 library. TSE3MDL files often have the extension
       .tse3

       The type of the input file is automatically detected by <b>tse3play</b> <b>tse3play</b> can also  load  legacy  <u>TSE2MDL</u>
       files from sequencers based on the older TSE2 sequencer library.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h, --help
              Provide help on the <b>tse3play</b> command line parameters.

       -ver, --version
              Print version number and exit.

       -v, --verbose
              Give verbose output on what <b>tse3play</b> is trying to do.

       -list, --list-ports
              Lists the port numbers available on your platform.

       -nv, --novisual
              Don't produce visual feedback (text-based output-level indicator).

       -np, --noplay
              Don't play the input file (only perform a conversion - if one is specified).

       -l, --loop
              Loop playback of the input file.

       -omidi, --out-midi &lt;filename&gt;
              Convert  the  loaded  file to MIDI. File type will be MIDI type 1 unless <b>-omidi0</b> is specified. The
              filename of the output follows this option. You can specify '-' to output on stdandard out.

       -omidi0, --out-midi-format-0
              If performing a MIDI conversion, produce an output file in MIDI type 0 format. For most cases  the
              default (type 1) is recommended.

       -omidicomp, --out-midi-compact
              Compact  the  converted  MIDI file output. This removes any redundant information in the MIDI file
              that could be removed by using MIDI running status.

       -otse3mdl, --out-tse3mdl FILENAME
              Convert the file to tse3mdl format. The filename of  the  output  follows  this  option.  You  can
              specify '-' to output on stdandard out.

       -map, --map-channel F T
              During playback, map MIDI channel F to MIDI channel T. Channel numbers start at zero.

       -m, --metronome
              During playback, produce a metronome tick.

       -r, --reset
              Send  a basic MIDI reset message at playback start and end. This will send a reset message even if
              <b>-np</b> is specified.

       -gmr, --gmreset
              Send a General MIDI reset message at playback start and end. This will send a reset  message  even
              if <b>-np</b> is specified.

       -gsr, --gsreset
              Send  a  GS reset message at playback start and end. This will send a reset message even if <b>-np</b> is
              specified.

       -xgr, --xgreset
              Send an XG reset message at playback start and end. This will send a reset message even if <b>-np</b>  is
              specified.

       -unix, --unix-scheduler
              Selects the best Unix scheduler device (either OSS or ALSA) as the MIDI output method. This is the
              default behaviour.

       -oss, --oss-scheduler
              Selects the Open Sound System interface as the MIDI output method.

       -alsa, --alsa-scheduler
              Selects  the  ALSA  interface  as  the  MIDI  output  method. This will only work if you have ALSA
              installed on your computer.

       -arts, --arts-scheduler
              Selects the aRts interface as the MIDI output method.  This  will  only  work  if  you  have  aRts
              installed on your computer.

       -stream, --stream-scheduler
              Selects  the  standard  output stream as the MIDI output method. An English interpretation of each
              MIDI command generated will appear on standard out.

       -s, --start
              Begin playback at the specified clock pulse. The pulses are divisions of quarter notes.   <b>tse3play</b>
              works to a resolution of 96 PPQN.

       -solo, --solo-track
              Play  with the specified input track 'soloed'. This will mute all the other tracks. Note that this
              option will mute the <b>input</b> track from the file, not the  specified  MIDI  channel.  Track  numbers
              start at zero.

       -sl, --sleep
              Sets  the  time period that <b>tse3play</b> returns control back to the operating system between updates.
              The parameter is a number of u-seconds. The default value is 100. Specifying a shorter  time  will
              make the real time vu bars update more responsively. A value of 0 disables the sleep.

       -stop, --no-stop
              Prevents  <b>tse3play</b>  from  exiting once playback has finished. This can be used in conjunction with
              --echo and no specified filename to make the computer act as a MIDI Thru box.

       -e, --echo
              Enable the MIDI echo facility, which is a soft MIDI Thru port. Anything received on  the  MIDI  in
              connection will be immediately echoed on the MIDI out.

       -mute, --mute-track
              Mutes the specified track in the input file. The first track is track zero.

       -pd, --patches-dir
              Specifies  the  path to the directory in which FM or GUS patch files are to be found. This is used
              by the OSS driver to load sounds into the soundcard.

       -port, --force-port
              Forces all output to the specified port.

       -fast, --fast-midi
              Tells <b>tse3play</b> to use a faster MIDI file import routine. This will make  the  MIDI  file  playback
              start  almost instantaneously (especially noticeable for very large MIDI files).  You can only use
              this if you are not converting a file.

              It has a number of possible side effects; (i) The MIDI file's last time stamp  is  trusted  to  be
              correct (it might not be) (ii) Stopping playback half way through <u>may</u> produce 'hanging notes'

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Naturally,  <b>tse3play</b>  is  completely bug free. The TSE3 library upon which it is based is also completely
       bug free. However, if you do find something goes wrong then contact the author. The program can  only  be
       improved with your feedback.
