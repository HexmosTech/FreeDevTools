</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Pcal</u> generates PostScript to produce landscape or portrait calendars for any month and year.  The
       arguments <b>month</b>, <b>year</b>, and <b>nmonths</b>, if provided, should be numeric.  The <b>month</b> value should be in the
       range 1 - 12, and the <b>year</b> value should be specified as 1 or 2 digits (in which case it will be
       interpreted as that year in the current century) or as the full 4-digit year.  If no numeric arguments
       are provided, the calendar for the current month and year will be generated.

       If one numeric argument is provided, it is interpreted as the <b>year</b> value, and calendars for the entire
       year will be generated.  Otherwise, <b>nmonths</b> months, starting with <b>month</b> and <b>year</b>, will be generated.

       For whole-year calendars (i.e. when the <b>-w</b> option is given), the command line arguments are interpreted
       somewhat differently.  By default, all months in the current year are printed, starting with January.  If
       the <b>month</b> argument alone is given, it is expected to be the desired <b>year</b> to print, and prints all of the
       months in the given year.  If both <b>month</b> and <b>year</b> are given, then 12 consecutive months are printed
       starting at the given month and year.  If the <b>month</b>, <b>year</b>, and <b>nmonths</b> arguments are all present,
       printing begins with the given month and year and <b>nmonths</b> months are printed, rounded up to the nearest
       multiple of 12.

   <b>The</b> <b>Date</b> <b>File</b> <b>(Configuration</b> <b>File)</b>
       By default, <u>pcal</u> simply prints an empty calendar.  Its real power is in its ability to place ``events''
       (and, for monthly-format PostScript calendars, Encapsulated PostScript images [e.g. photos and icons]) in
       appropriate days on the (PostScript or HTML) calendar, thus allowing the user to create personalized
       calendars.  This is achieved through the use of the ``date file'', also known as the ``configuration
       file''.

       The default date/configuration file is expected to be named <u>.calendar</u> (<u>pcal.dat</u> under MS-DOS), or
       <u>calendar</u> for compatibility with older versions.  <u>Pcal</u> will look in several places for such a file.
       First, if the environment variable <b>PCAL_DIR</b> is defined, <u>pcal</u> searches the directory indicated by that
       variable.  Next, <u>pcal</u> searches the user's home directory (as specified by the <b>HOME</b> environment variable).
       If neither <b>PCAL_DIR</b> nor <b>HOME</b> is defined, <u>pcal</u> searches the current directory instead.  Finally, if
       enabled (via the `SEARCH_PCAL_DIR' flag) when <u>pcal</u> was built, the directory where the <u>pcal</u> executable
       resides will be checked.  (This final search of the executable directory has been disabled in the version
       shipped with Debian.)  If no date file is found, an empty calendar is printed; no error is generated.

       Alternatively, the name of the date file (and, optionally, the path where it can be found) can be
       specified using the <b>-f</b> command-line option.  See the <b>OPTIONS</b> section for more details.

       Every <u>pcal</u> distribution comes with an 'examples' directory.  The `pcal-cfg.txt' file that is located
       there contains a myriad of examples of settings that can be used in your own configuration file.  Please
       check it out for lots of useful ideas.  Furthermore, that directory contains several language/country-
       specific examples (including holiday and other event definitions) in various `calendar_xx.txt' files,
       where `xx' represents the 2-letter language code (e.g. 'calendar_de.txt' is the German example file).

       If a date file is found, it will be searched for lines with leading dates matching the requested month
       and year.

       Any text following the dates found will be printed on the calendar under the appropriate day of the
       month.  Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) images are handled similarly as described in a later subsection.

       <b>troff</b>-style escape sequences \fB, \fI, \fP, and \fR may be used to set the font style to Bold, Italic,
       the previous font style, or Roman respectively.  For those more familiar with HTML, &lt;B&gt;, &lt;I&gt;, &lt;/B&gt;, and
       &lt;/I&gt; may be used instead to enable/disable Bold or Italic font styles.  The font style is reset to Roman
       after each line break.

       Using the `include' pre-processor directive (described in the section entitled `Pre-Processor
       Functionality', below), other configuration files can be processed from within an existing configuration
       file.  That is, you can `nest' configuration files as needed.

       Dates (essentially `events') in the configuration files may be expressed in any of several formats:

              • &lt;ordinal&gt; &lt;day_spec&gt; in &lt;month_spec&gt;{*} {&lt;text&gt;}

              • {&lt;ordinal&gt;} &lt;day_spec&gt; &lt;prep&gt; &lt;date_spec&gt;{*} {&lt;text&gt;}

              • &lt;date_spec&gt;{*} {&lt;text&gt;}

              • &lt;pre_defined_event&gt;{*} {&lt;text&gt;}

       Where:

            &lt;month_name&gt;     := first 3+ characters of name of month, or ``all''

                             <b>Note:</b>  <u>pcal</u>  looks  for names of the days of the week prior to names of months when
                             parsing event date specifications.  Furthermore, some languages  (e.g.  French  and
                             Finnish)  have  a  month  name  whose  first  3 letters are the same as the first 3
                             letters of one of the names of  the  days  of  the  week.   Because  of  this,  the
                             specification in such a language of any month name which collides thusly must use 4
                             or  more  letters to distinguish it from the name of the day of the week with which
                             it `collides'.

            &lt;month_spec&gt;     := &lt;month_name&gt;, or ``year''

            &lt;day_spec&gt;       := first 3+ characters of  name  of  weekday,  ``day'',  ``weekday'',  ``workday'',
                             ``holiday'',    ``nonweekday'',   ``nonworkday'',   ``nonholiday'',   ``new_moon'',
                             ``first_quarter'', ``full_moon'', or ``last_quarter''

            &lt;ordinal&gt;        := any ordinal number (``1st'', ``2nd'', etc.), ``first'' ... ``fifth'',  ``last'',
                             ``odd'', ``even'', or ``all''

            &lt;prep&gt;           :=  ``on'',  ``before'',  ``preceding'', ``after'', ``following'', ``on_or_before''
                             (``oob''),   ``on_or_after''   (``ooa''),   ``nearest'',   ``nearest_before``,   or
                             ``nearest_after``

            &lt;pre_defined_event&gt;
                             :=   ``Christmas'',   ``Thanksgiving'',  ``Easter'',  ``Good_Friday'',  ``GEaster''
                             (Orthodox Easter), ``Gstgeorge''  (Orthodox  holiday),  and  ``Gmarcus''  (Orthodox
                             holiday).

            &lt;sep&gt;            := one or more non-numeric, non-space, non-`*' characters

            &lt;month&gt;          := a numeric month (1-12)

            &lt;day&gt;            := day of month (1-31)

            &lt;year&gt;           := a numeric year

            &lt;text&gt;           :=  the  text  to be displayed for this event; if the text begins with the constant
                             string ``image:'', then it is interpreted as a  specification  of  an  Encapsulated
                             PostScript  (EPS)  image rather than as simple text; more information on specifying
                             EPS images is available in a later section of this document

       If the <b>-A</b> option (American date formats, the default) is given:

            &lt;date_spec&gt;      := &lt;month_name&gt; &lt;day&gt; | &lt;month&gt;&lt;sep&gt;&lt;day&gt;{&lt;sep&gt;&lt;year&gt;}

       If the <b>-E</b> option (European date formats) is given:

            &lt;date_spec&gt;      := &lt;day&gt; &lt;month_name&gt; | &lt;day&gt; &lt;month&gt; | &lt;day&gt;&lt;sep&gt;&lt;month&gt;{&lt;sep&gt;&lt;year&gt;}

       The ``Notes'' box (see below) uses the first of the current  month  as  the  default  date.   All  footer
       strings  use  the  first of the current month in single-month mode and the first of the starting month in
       whole-year mode.

       Any non-numeric character may separate numeric dates.  Holidays may be  flagged  by  following  the  date
       immediately  with  `*'  as  in the examples above; this will cause the date numerics to be printed in the
       color specified by the <b>-s</b> option (default = gray) and will cause the associated text  (on  monthly-format
       calendars)  to  be  placed adjacent to the numeric date in the day box rather than below the numeric date
       (as is done for all non-holiday events).  ``Each'' and ``every'' are accepted as  synonyms  for  ``all'',
       and  any word may be used in place of ``in''.  The abbreviations ``oob'' and ``ooa'' may be used in place
       of the keywords ``on_or_before'' and ``on_or_after'', respectively.  ``Nearest'' attempts  to  match  the
       specified date; if that fails, it tries the day after, then the day before, then two days after, two days
       before, and so forth until a match occurs.

       Wildcard  day  names  are  also provided.  The keyword ``weekday'' applies to any days which are normally
       printed in "logical black" - the predominant day color - on the calendar.  The keyword ``workday'' is the
       same, but does not include any holidays.  The keyword ``holiday'' includes only  those  days  flagged  as
       holidays.   The  keywords  ``nonweekday'',  ``nonworkday'',  and  ``nonholiday''  are  also recognized as
       negations of the above.  See the <b>CAVEATS</b> below for important notes on using these keywords.  Moon  phases
       may  also  appear  as  wildcards; ``nm'' is accepted as a synonym for ``new_moon'', ``1q'' and ``fq'' for
       ``first_quarter'',  ``fm''  for   ``full_moon'',   ``3q''   for   ``third_quarter'',   and   ``lq''   for
       ``last_quarter''.

       Ordinal  day  numbers  may be used to specify dates, either relative to the month or to the year.  Either
       words or numeric abbreviations may be used for ``first'' through ``fifth''; higher numbers must be  given
       using  the  numeric  equivalent  (e.g.  100th).  Negative ordinal numbers may even be used.  For example,
       ``-2nd'' means ``next to last''.

       ``Odd'' and ``even'' do not refer to the actual date; instead, ``odd'' means ``alternate,  starting  with
       the  first'', and ``even'' means ``alternate, starting with the second''.  Thus, ``odd Fridays in March''
       refers to the first, third, and (if present) fifth Fridays in March — not to those Fridays falling on odd
       dates.

       ``All'' refers to each individual month; ``year'' refers to the year as an entity.  Thus ``odd Fridays in
       all'' refers to the first, third, and fifth Friday of each month, while ``odd Fridays in year'' refers to
       the first Friday of January and every other Friday thereafter.

       ``Nearest'', ``nearest_before'', and ``nearest_after'' refer to the nearest weekday or wildcard day  with
       respect  to  the  specified date.  ``Nearest_before'' and ``nearest_after'' allow the user to specify how
       <u>pcal</u> is to disambiguate between two dates that are equally near: e.g., ``nonweekday nearest_before [Wed.]
       9/25/96'' refers to Sunday, 9/22 while ``nonweekday nearest_after 9/25/96''  refers  to  Saturday,  9/28.
       (Note  that ``nearest_before'' and ``nearest_after'' are equivalent to ``nearest'' when no such ambiguity
       exists: e.g., ``nonweekday nearest_before [Thu.] 9/26/96'' refers to Saturday, 9/28.)

       Text in the date file may use C-like escape sequences (i.e. a `\' followed by a character, 1  -  3  octal
       digits,  or  `x'  followed by 1 - 2 hexadecimal digits).  Escaped whitespace (including <b>newline</b> ) and the
       standard ANSI character escapes (`\a', `\b', `\f', `\n', `\r', `\t', `\v') are all replaced by  a  single
       blank.

       The HTML special characters `&amp;lt;' `&amp;gt;' `&amp;quot;' `&amp;amp;' `&amp;nbsp;' and `&amp;#NNN;' (NNN = any three decimal
       digits)  are  also supported.  These will be propagated intact (be sure to escape the `#' in `&amp;#NNN;') if
       the output is specified as HTML (see the <b>-H</b> flag); otherwise  they  will  be  converted  to  their  ASCII
       equivalents.   This  allows a common date file to be used regardless of whether the desired output format
       is HTML, PostScript, or Un*x <u><a href="../man1/calendar.1.html">calendar</a>(1)</u> (see the <b>-c</b> flag) input.

       Lines in the configuration file consisting of <b>year</b> <b>####</b> (where <b>####</b> is a numeric year) can be used to set
       the year for following entries.  This assumes that the following entries do not contain a year; any  date
       entries containing year information will set the remembered year to that year.

       Lines  in  the  configuration  file  consisting  of  <b>year</b>  <b>all</b> (or, alternatively, <b>year</b> <b>*</b>) direct <u>pcal</u> to
       wildcard following entries against every applicable year.  This assumes that the following entries do not
       contain a year; any date entries containing year information (or an explicit <b>year</b> <b>####</b>  entry)  will  set
       the remembered year to that year.

       Lines  in the configuration file consisting of <b>opt</b> <b>&lt;options&gt;</b> can be used to override the defaults for any
       command-line options except <b>-c</b>, <b>-e</b>, <b>-f</b>, <b>-h</b>, <b>-H</b>, <b>-u</b>, <b>-v</b>, <b>-D</b>, and <b>-U</b>.  Any options specified in this manner
       are, in turn, overridden by those specified explicitly on the command line.

       Lines in the configuration file consisting  of  <b>note{/&lt;number&gt;}</b>  <b>&lt;month&gt;</b>  can  be  used  to  place  notes
       regarding  the  entire  month  in one of the unused blocks of the calendar.  The <b>&lt;month&gt;</b> indicator may be
       either a number 1 through 12 or an alphabetic month name as described above;  ``note all'' will place the
       associated text in the notes block for each month in the current year.  <b>&lt;number&gt;</b> is an optional  positive
       or negative number specifying the empty box where the associated text is to be placed.  If positive, <u>pcal</u>
       counts  forward  from  the  first  empty  box; if negative, <u>pcal</u> counts backward from the last empty box.
       Thus, <b>``note/1''</b> places the associated text in the first empty box; <b>note/-3</b> in  the  third-to-last.   The
       default  is  -1 if no &lt;number&gt; is given (last empty box, immediately preceding the small calendars on the
       bottom row; cf.  <b>-S</b>, <b>-k</b>, and <b>-K</b>, below).  You can place several notes in the same box.  You can also  use
       more than 1 box for the various monthly notes.

       Lines  in  the configuration file consisting of <b>input-language</b> <b>XX</b> (where <b>XX</b> is the 2-letter specification
       for any of the supported languages) can be used to set the language used for interpretation of the  month
       names  and  day-of-week  names  for  the remaining event entries.  This option may be specified more than
       once, as needed, if the language used  to  describe  events  changes  within  the  file.   For  backwards
       compatibility,  the default value for `input language' if this directive is never used is 'en' (English).
       Note that this directive is distinct from the specification of 'output language' as accomplished with the
       <b>-a</b> option.

       Comments are supported in the configuration file.  Any characters following a `#' character are  ignored,
       through the end of that line, unless the `#' character is escaped by `\'.

   <b>Deleting</b> <b>Events</b>
       By  prepending  the  <u>`delete'</u> keyword to an event specification, one or more events may be deleted from a
       set of previously-specified events.

       For example, the following lines might appear in the date file:

              all Friday in all  Poker game
              delete first Friday in all  Poker game

       This results in an event labeled `Poker game' on every Friday except the first Friday of the  month.   If
       you  delete  an entry which is marked as a holiday, the `holiday' flag for that day will be recalculated.
       Any `delete' entries which don't match any pre-existing entries are silently ignored.

   <b>Format</b> <b>Specifiers</b>
       <u>Pcal</u> allows format specifiers in both the event text and footer strings (see  the  <b>-L</b>,  <b>-C</b>,  <b>-R</b>,  and  <b>-N</b>
       options  below).  Each  format  specifier  will  be replaced by a corresponding string as outlined in the
       following table:

            %a   abbreviated weekday
            %A   full weekday
            %b   abbreviated month name
            %B   full month name
            %d   day of month (1-31)
            %j   day of year (1-366)
            %l   days left in year (0-365)
            %m   month (1-12)
            %U   week number (0-53)
            %W   week number (0-53)
            %u   week number (1-54)
            %w   week number (1-54)
            %y   year w/o century (00-99)
            %Y   year w/century
            %%   `%' character

            %o   print number as ordinal
            %0   print number with leading zeroes
            %+   use following month or year
            %-   use previous month or year
            %{+N}[DWMY]    adjust date by +N days/weeks/months/years
            %{-N}[DWMY]    adjust date by -N days/weeks/months/years

       Most of these are derived from the ANSI C strftime() function,  but  the  <b>%[louwMD]</b>  and  <b>%[o0+-]</b>  format
       specifiers are specific to <u>pcal</u>.

       The  <b>%u</b>  specifier considers the week containing 1/1 (Jan 1st) as week 1 and the following logical Sunday
       (the first day of the week as printed; cf. the <b>-F</b> option below) as the start of week 2; <b>%U</b> considers  the
       first  logical  Sunday as the first day of week 1.  <b>%w</b> and <b>%W</b> behave like <b>%u</b> and <b>%U</b> respectively, but use
       the first logical Monday instead.  Note that <b>%w</b> has a different meaning from strftime().

       The <b>%o</b> format specifier prints a number as an ordinal,  with  the  appropriate  suffix  (``st'',  ``nd'',
       ``rd'',  or  ``th''  in  English)  appended.   For  example,  <b>%od</b> prints the day of the month as ``1st'',
       ``2nd'', ``3rd'', etc.

       Unlike strftime(), <u>pcal</u> defaults to printing numbers (except <b>%y</b>)  without  leading  zeroes.   If  leading
       zeroes  are  desired,  the  `0'  prefix  may  be  used.  For example, <b>%0j</b> prints the first day of year as
       ``001''.

       The <b>%+</b> and <b>%-</b> format specifiers direct <u>pcal</u>  to  substitute  the  following/previous  month/year  in  the
       following <b>[bBmyY]</b> specifier.  For example, <b>%+B</b> prints the name of the next month.

       The  <b>%{[+-]N}[DWMY]</b>  format  specifiers  do  not print anything, but instead adjust the working date by ±
       <b>N</b>days (<b>D</b>), weeks (<b>W</b>), months (<b>M</b>), or years (<b>Y</b>).  Subsequent  format  specifiers  use  the  adjusted  date
       instead  of  the  current  date.   For example, <b>%+1M</b> <b>%B</b> <b>%Y</b> adjusts the date forward by one month and then
       prints the resulting month and year (``January 1992'' in December, 1991); <b>%-2W</b> <b>%b</b>  <b>%d</b>  adjusts  the  date
       backward by two weeks and prints the resulting month and day (``Jul 26'' on August 9).

       Such date adjustments are normally cumulative; for example, <b>%+1Y%-1D</b> adjusts the date forward by one year
       and  then  backward  by  one  day.   If  <b>%D</b> or <b>%M</b> is specified alone (or if <b>N</b> is zero), <u>pcal</u> restores the
       original date.  Note that <b>%M</b> has a different meaning to the strftime() function.

       Here's a common, useful example of an event entry for the <u>pcal</u> date file which combines  the  ability  to
       adjust  working  dates  and  the ability to display ordinals.  This particular example is used to display
       text on the birthday of a person born in 1991:

              May 10 Eric's %-1991Y%oY Birthday

       That entry would result in the following text being displayed on May 10, 2005:

              Eric's 14th Birthday

   <b>Encapsulated</b> <b>PostScript</b> <b>(EPS)</b> <b>Images</b>
       For monthly PostScript calendars only, <u>pcal</u> supports the embedding of one or  more  EPS  images  (photos,
       icons, etc) into any given day of the month.  (EPS image specifications in the <u>pcal</u> date file are ignored
       for yearly PostScript calendars and for all HTML calendars.)

       In  order  to  associate  an image with a given event, you must add one or more entries to the date file.
       The event date is specified exactly as described previously for simple event  text  specification  lines.
       However,  instead  of  specifying  the  text associated with the event, you instead specify the EPS image
       filename and some additional parameters in the following format:

            image:&lt;EPS-image-filename&gt; &lt;x-scale&gt; &lt;y-scale&gt; &lt;x-delta&gt; &lt;y-delta&gt;

       Where:

            &lt;EPS-image-filename&gt;   is the filename (which can include a path)  of  the  Encapsulated  PostScript
                                   image.   <b>Note:</b>  The  EPS image filename must be preceded by the constant text
                                   `image:' in order to distinguish an EPS image specification from an  ordinary
                                   event text specification.

            &lt;x-scale&gt;              is  a  scaling factor in the horizontal dimension for the EPS image.  A value
                                   of 1.0 is nominal (i.e. no change to image scale).  Values  between  0.0  and
                                   1.0 shrink the image in the horizontal dimension while values over 1.0 expand
                                   the  image  in  the  horizontal dimension.  Generally speaking, only positive
                                   values should be used.  However, in the rare case that you find that your EPS
                                   image needs to be flipped about the vertical axis (i.e. left to  right),  you
                                   can  use  a negative value to achieve this without having to tweak the actual
                                   PostScript content within the EPS image file.  Use of a negative  value  will
                                   undoubtedly  necessitate a corresponding change to the &lt;x-delta&gt; parameter to
                                   account for the image's relocated position that occurs when it  gets  flipped
                                   "left-to-right".

            &lt;y-scale&gt;              is  a  scaling  factor  in  the vertical dimension for the EPS image.  Values
                                   between 0.0 and 1.0 shrink the image in the vertical dimension  while  values
                                   over  1.0  expand  the image in the vertical dimension.  Note that a negative
                                   value for this parameter can be useful in the less-than-rare  case  that  you
                                   find  that your EPS image needs to be flipped about the horizontal axis (i.e.
                                   top to bottom).  In such cases, you can use a  negative  &lt;y-scale&gt;  value  to
                                   achieve this without having to tweak the actual PostScript content within the
                                   EPS  image  file.   Use  of  a  negative value will undoubtedly necessitate a
                                   corresponding change to the &lt;y-delta&gt; parameter to account  for  the  image's
                                   relocated position that occurs when it gets flipped "upside down".

            &lt;x-delta&gt;              :=  a  horizontal  adjustment in typographic `points' (i.e. 72nds of an inch)
                                   for the positioning of the EPS image.  With offsets of 0 for  X  and  Y,  the
                                   image  will be printed at the extreme left edge of the box for that day, just
                                   under the numerics for that day.  Positive values move the image to the right
                                   and negative values move the image to the left.

            &lt;y-delta&gt;              := a vertical adjustment in typographic `points' (i.e. 72nds of an inch)  for
                                   the  positioning  of the EPS image.  With offsets of 0 for X and Y, the image
                                   will be printed at the extreme left edge of the box for that day, just  under
                                   the  numerics  for  that day.  Positive values move the image up and negative
                                   values move the image down.

       Here's an example of a line from the date file that associates an EPS image with an event:

            4th Thu in Nov*   Thanksgiving
            4th Thu in Nov*   image:/eps-path/turkey.eps 1.0 1.0 0 0

       You can place as many images as you want on a single day of the month by specifying repeated lines in the
       date file.  For example, these lines put icons of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln on the day of the
       U.S. ``Presidents' Day'' holiday, along with the event text:

            3rd Monday in Feb*   Presidents' Day
            3rd Monday in Feb*   image:/eps-path/washington.eps 0.08 0.08 8 0
            3rd Monday in Feb*   image:/eps-path/lincoln.eps 0.22 0.22 48 0

       Note that the icon for Lincoln is shifted to the right by 48 typographic points so as not to overlay  the
       first icon.

       The <u>pcal</u> releases come with a single EPS sample file ('eps/recycle.eps') of the ubiquitous 'recycle' icon
       (3  green  arrows  in  a triangular shape).  Such an image might be used with configuration file settings
       like this:

            second Sat in all RECYCLE!
            second Sat in all image:/eps-path/recycle.eps 0.039 0.039 34 -9

       In cases where you're displaying non-holiday event text (e.g.  someone's  birthday)  and  an  EPS  image,
       you'll  often  need  to  use  a negative `Y-delta' value on the EPS image specification line, in order to
       shift the image down so that it doesn't cover the event text, which appears just below the day's numerics
       for non-holiday events.  (Text for holiday events appears higher up, to the right of the day's  numerics,
       so there's usually no collision with the EPS image.)

       <b>Note:</b> Unfortunately, most EPS images cannot be used directly by <u>pcal</u>.

              Depending on the EPS image used and how it was created, you may have to remove or comment out some
              or  all of the PostScript `translate' commands, in order to avoid the use of illogical X-delta and
              Y-delta values when specifying the EPS image in your <u>pcal</u> date file. Most programs  that  generate
              EPS  output  (either directly or via conversion from some other graphic format) seem to have these
              `translate' commands relatively early in the EPS file.

              It may take some experimentation to get it just right.  Preview the <u>pcal</u> output using a PostScript
              viewer as you tweak the PostScript commands in the EPS image file and/or the event  entry  in  the
              <u>pcal</u> date file.

                     <b>Note:</b>  Depending  upon  what application you use to preview PostScript content, the monthly
                     calendars may not show  any  embedded  EPS  images.   Here's  a  rundown  of  some  popular
                     PostScript-viewing applications and whether they correctly display the embedded EPS images:

                            • gv (version 3.5.8) -- EPS images appear fine

                            • ggv (versions 2.4.0.1 and 2.6.1) -- EPS images appear fine

                            • older  kghostview (versions 0.13.2 [KDE 3.1.4] and 0.2.0 [KDE 3.2.3 and 3.3.2]) --
                              EPS images DO NOT APPEAR!

                            • newer kghostview (version 0.2.0 [KDE 3.4.2 and 3.5.4]) -- EPS images appear fine

       For converting non-EPS images (e.g.  photos)  to  EPS  format,  one  can  use  the  graphical  GNU  Image
       Manipulation Program, a.k.a. `The GIMP':

              <u><a href="http://www.gimp.org">http://www.gimp.org</a></u>

       For  icons/images  in  WMF format (which are popular in various 3rd-party, legacy-OS, commercial calendar
       programs), the `libwmf'/`wmf2eps' library/utility is useful for generating <u>pcal</u>-capable EPS  images.   It
       can be found at this site:

              <u><a href="http://wvware.sourceforge.net/libwmf.html">http://wvware.sourceforge.net/libwmf.html</a></u>

       For  icons/images  in  SVG  format,  the ImageMagick `convert' utility is sometimes useful for generating
       <u>pcal</u>-capable EPS images.  This suite of utilities (which includes other useful ImageMagick utilities like
       `display' and `identify') may already be available on your Linux distribution.  If not, it can  be  found
       at this site:

              <u><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org">http://www.imagemagick.org</a></u>

       For  cases  where  ImageMagick's  `convert'  utility  fails  to properly convert SVG-format images to EPS
       format, you can try the method of converting the SVG image into an intermediate format (e.g.  PNG)  using
       the `rsvg' utility.  This utility may already be available on your Linux distribution.  If not, it can be
       found at this site:

              <u><a href="http://librsvg.sourceforge.net/">http://librsvg.sourceforge.net/</a></u>

       From  the  PNG format, the image can often then be successfully converted to EPS format, using the above-
       mentioned ImageMagick `convert' utility.

       The <u>Open</u> <u>Clip</u> <u>Art</u> <u>Library</u> is a good source of freely-usable images (many of which are in SVG format)  for
       decorating your events:

              <u><a href="http://www.openclipart.org">http://www.openclipart.org</a></u>

       <b>Note:</b>  The  EPS  image  content  is not generated in the PostScript output -- only a reference to the EPS
       image filename is generated.  From a practical standpoint,  this  means  that  normally  you'll  need  to
       print/preview  the  PostScript  output of <u>pcal</u> from the same computer/setup as that which was used to run
       <u>pcal</u> in the first place.  If you want to generate a calendar with embedded EPS images that will later  be
       printed/viewed  on another machine which does not have access to those EPS images, you'll need to run the
       output through a pre-processor which will put the EPS image content into the PostScript output file.  For
       example, assuming your initial calendar output was generated to a file named `pcal.ps', on most GNU/Linux
       systems you could run this command, which uses the popular `Ghostscript' interpreter:

              gs -r300x300 -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE -sDEVICE=pswrite -sOutputFile=out.ps pcal.ps

       This would generate a PostScript file named `out.ps', at 300x300 dpi resolution, which has the actual EPS
       image content embedded within, allowing you to transport  the  `out.ps'  file  to  another  computer  for
       viewing/printing.   Of  course, the new file is substantially larger, but it's portable. Furthermore, the
       EPS images will be viewable even in PostScript-viewing applications  (see  above)  which  don't  properly
       support the display of embedded (by filename only) EPS images.

   <b>Pre-Processor</b> <b>Functionality</b>
       <u>Pcal</u> supports rudimentary <u>cpp</u>-like functionality in the date file, allowing the following constructs:

              • <b>define</b> <b>|</b> <b>undef</b>

              • <b>if{{n}def}</b> <b>...</b> <b>{elif</b> <b>...}*</b> <b>{else</b> <b>...}</b> <b>endif</b>

              • <b>include</b>

       Note that these are not preceded by `#' as they are in C.

       Symbol  names  defined  using  these  keywords (or via the <b>-D</b> option) are case-insensitive.  It is not an
       error to <b>undef</b> an undefined symbol, nor to <b>define</b> a previously-defined one.

       A symbol can be defined with just a name (e.g. ``define MY_SYM'')  or  it  can  take  on  a  value  (e.g.
       ``define  MY_SYM  SOME_VALUE'').   Use  of  symbol values is convenient for defining a starting date then
       using that symbol to reference that starting date in one or more events.  For example, these  definitions
       in the date file might be useful:

            define semester_start 8/23   # Beginning of semester
            semester_start                 Class Start
            7th  day after semester_start  1st Quiz
            14th day after semester_start  2nd Quiz
            undef semester_start

       Be  aware  that  the  substitution of symbol values for symbol names is not robust, so it's wise to use a
       symbol name that's unlikely to occur in any of your other event text.  In other words, if you defined the
       `semester_start' symbol in the example above as merely `start', then you'd get the  undesired  effect  of
       having  the  text  `Class 8/23' in your calendar on that day instead of `Class Start'!  The use of `undef
       semester_start' in the above example is optional and is really only useful to prevent any unwanted symbol
       substitutions later on, which probably won't happen unless you poorly choose your symbol  name  to  begin
       with.

       An <b>ifdef</b> alone is always <b>false</b>; an <b>ifndef</b> alone is always <b>true</b>.  <b>if</b> is accepted as a synonym for <b>ifdef</b>.

       The  name  of  the file in the <b>include</b> directive may optionally be surrounded by either "" or &lt;&gt;, both of
       which are ignored.  If the name is not an absolute path, it is taken to  be  relative  to  the  directory
       where  the  file containing the directive is located.  If the string "%y" appears in the file name, it is
       replaced by the last two digits of the current year or, if "year all" is in effect, is  expanded  to  all
       applicable years.  <u>Pcal</u> is smart enough to translate <b>~/</b> to the user's home directory.

       <u>Pcal</u>  normally  terminates  immediately if the file specified in an <b>include</b> directive does not exist.  An
       alternate form of the directive, <b>include?</b>, directs <u>pcal</u> to continue silently if the file does  not  exist
       or cannot be opened.

       In  addition  to  pre-processing  keywords,  <u>pcal</u> also accepts boolean expressions in <b>if{{n}def}</b> and <b>elif</b>
       directives.  These expressions consist of symbol names joined by the boolean operators <b>!</b>, <b>&amp;</b>, <b>^</b>, and <b>|</b>, in
       order of precedence, high to low.  Parentheses may be used to alter the precedence.  The synonyms <b>&amp;&amp;</b>  and
       <b>||</b> are accepted for <b>&amp;</b> and <b>|</b>.  A symbol name evaluates to <b>true</b> if currently defined, <b>false</b> if not; thus:

            ifdef A | B | C

       ...is <b>true</b> if any of the symbols A, B, and C is defined, and:

            ifdef A &amp; B &amp; C

       ...is <b>true</b> if they all are.  Note that <b>ifndef</b> <b>&lt;expr&gt;</b> is equivalent to <b>ifdef</b> <b>!(</b> <b>&lt;expr&gt;</b> <b>).</b>

   <b>The</b> <b>Moon</b> <b>File</b>
       If  a file of the name <u>.moon##</u> (<u>moon##.dat</u> under MS-DOS), where <b>##</b> is the last two digits of the calendar
       year, exists in the same directory as the date file (or in the directory where <u>pcal</u> resides),  <u>pcal</u>  uses
       the  information  contained within to calculate the phase of the moon.  If a) no such file exists, b) the
       <b>-e</b> flag (do not use a date file) is specified, or c) the <b>-z</b> flag (specify time zone) is  specified,  then
       <u>pcal</u> uses an algorithm to calculate the phase of the moon.

       Entries in the moon file must conform to the following syntax:

       If the <b>-A</b> option (American date formats, the default) is given:

            &lt;quarter&gt; &lt;month&gt;&lt;sep&gt;&lt;day&gt; {&lt;hour&gt;&lt;sep&gt;&lt;min&gt;}

       If the <b>-E</b> option (European date formats) is given:

            &lt;quarter&gt; &lt;day&gt;&lt;sep&gt;&lt;month&gt; {&lt;hour&gt;&lt;sep&gt;&lt;min&gt;}

       Where:

            &lt;quarter&gt; := ``nm'', ``fq'' or ``1q'', ``fm'', ``3q'' or ``lq'' (new moon,
                           first quarter, full moon, last quarter)
            &lt;hour&gt;         := number 0-23 (24-hour clock)
            &lt;min&gt;          := number 0-59

       This  file  must contain entries for all quarter moons in the year, in chronological order; if any errors
       are encountered, <u>pcal</u> will revert to using its default algorithm.

       As in the date file, comments start with `#' and run through the end of the given line.

       The moon file may optionally contain an <b>opt</b> <b>-A</b> or <b>opt</b> <b>-E</b> line to specify  the  format  of  its  own  date
       entries independently of the format used in the date file.  No other flags are legal in the moon file.

   <b>Generating</b> <b>PostScript</b> <b>Calendars</b> <b>Via</b> <b>A</b> <b>Web</b> <b>Browser</b> <b>Interface</b>
       PostScript-format <u>pcal</u> calendars can be generated and viewed from a web browser interface.

              <b>Note:</b>  This  is not to be confused with the ability to generate non-PostScript, HTML-format (using
              the <b>-H</b> command-line option) calendars, which is a different capability entirely.

       <u>Pcal</u> comes with 4 files that provide this ability: `pcal.cgi' (a Bourne shell script), `pcal.pl' (a  Perl
       equivalent of `pcal.cgi'), `pcal.html', and `pcalw.html'.

       The  CGI  file (either `pcal.cgi' or `pcal.pl') must be edited before using it. Change the definition for
       <u>`pcal='</u> (Bourne shell script) or <u>`my</u> <u>$PCAL</u> <u>='</u> (Perl  script)  to  point  to  the  location  of  the  <u>pcal</u>
       executable  file.   Change the definition for <u>`file='</u> (Bourne shell script) or <u>`my</u> <u>$FILE</u> <u>='</u> (Perl script)
       to point to the location of the <u>pcal</u> `date file' (e.g.  `.calendar'),  which  contains  the  options  for
       running  <u>pcal</u>.   Finally,  copy  the `pcal.cgi' (or `pcal.pl') file to the location where your web server
       expects to find such files (e.g. `/var/www/cgi-bin/').

       The `pcal.html' and `pcalw.html' files must also be edited.  Each one has a line like this:

              &lt;FORM ACTION="<a href="http://yourpath/cgi-bin/pcal.cgi">http://yourpath/cgi-bin/pcal.cgi</a>" METHOD=GET&gt;

       That line must be edited to point to the host and  location  of  your  CGI  script  file  (`pcal.cgi'  or
       `pcal.pl').

       Once  that's  done,  point  your  web  browser  to  the  `pcal.html'  or  `pcalw.html'  file  to generate
       monthly/yearly PostScript calendars for viewing within your web browser.

              <b>Note:</b> Depending upon what application your web browser spawns to preview PostScript  content,  the
              monthly  calendars  generated via this web browser interface may not show any embedded EPS images.
              For a rundown of some popular PostScript-viewing applications and whether they  correctly  display
              the embedded EPS images, see the section (above) entitled `Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) Images'.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-e</b>     Prints an empty calendar.  Do not print entries from a <u>.calendar</u> file even if one exists.

       <b>-f</b> <u>cal</u> Directs  <u>pcal</u>  to  use the file name <u>cal</u> as the input file in place of the default <u>.calendar</u> file.
              Note that the search rules are different when <b>-f</b> is used.  If <u>cal</u> is an absolute file  name  (i.e.
              starting with a `/'), then <u>pcal</u> attempts to open only that file.  Otherwise, <u>pcal</u> looks for <u>cal</u> in
              the  current  directory,  then in the directory indicated by the environment variable <b>PCAL_DIR</b> (if
              defined), and finally, if enabled (via the `SEARCH_PCAL_DIR' flag) when <u>pcal</u>  was  built,  in  the
              directory  where  the  <u>pcal</u>  executable  resides.   If  the  given <u>cal</u> file is not found, an error
              results.

       <b>-o</b> <u>file</u>
              Directs <u>pcal</u> to write the output to <u>file</u> instead of to stdout.

       <b>-l</b>     Causes the output to be in landscape mode (default).

              <u>Pcal</u> predefines the  symbol  `ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE'  whenever  `landscape'  page  orientation  is
              enabled.   This  can  be  useful  for providing alternate values in the configuration file for EPS
              image placement and scaling, based on the page orientation.

       <b>-p</b>     Causes the output to be in portrait mode.

              <u>Pcal</u> predefines the symbol `ORIENTATION_PORTRAIT' whenever `portrait' page orientation is enabled.
              This can be useful for providing  alternate  values  in  the  configuration  file  for  EPS  image
              placement and scaling, based on the page orientation.

       <b>-P</b>     Selects the paper size.  The following sizes are supported:

                     • letter — 8.5 x 11.0 inches

                     • legal — 8.5 x 14.0 inches

                     • a4 — 210 x 297 mm

                     • tabloid — 11.0 x 17.0 inches

              <u>Pcal</u> predefines one of the following symbols based on the current paper size:

                     • PAPERSIZE_LETTER

                     • PAPERSIZE_LEGAL

                     • PAPERSIZE_A4

                     • PAPERSIZE_TABLOID

              These  symbol  definitions  can be useful for providing alternate values in the configuration file
              for EPS image placement and scaling, based on paper size.

       <b>-j</b>     Causes the Julian date (day of year) to be printed in each calendar box.

       <b>-J</b>     Causes the Julian date and the number of days remaining in the year to be printed in each calendar
              box.

       <b>-m</b>     Causes moon icons to be printed on dates corresponding to new, half, and full moons  (the  default
              is that no moons are printed).

       <b>-M</b>     Causes moon icons to be printed on all dates (the default is that no moons are printed).

       <b>-g</b> <u>day1</u>[<u>-day2</u>] <b>|</b> <b>all</b> <b>|</b> <b>holiday</b>
              Causes  all  dates  falling  on weekday <u>day1</u> (through <u>day2</u> if specified) to be printed in the `day
              numerics color' (i.e. the color specified by the <b>-s</b> option [default = gray]); <b>-g</b>  <b>all</b>  causes  all
              weekdays  (other  than  holidays) to be printed in the `day numerics color'; <b>-g</b> <b>holiday</b> causes all
              holidays to be printed in `day numerics color'.  <u>day1</u> and  <u>day2</u>  may  wrap  around  weekends;  for
              example,  <b>-g</b>  <b>fri-sun</b>  causes  Fridays,  Saturdays, and Sundays to be printed in the `day numerics
              color'.

       <b>-O</b> <u>day1</u>[<u>-day2</u>] <b>|</b> <b>all</b> <b>|</b> <b>holiday</b>
              Similar to <b>-g</b>, but the selected days will be  printed  as  outlined  characters,  using  the  `day
              numerics color'.

       <b>-G</b> <u>day1</u>[<u>-day2</u>] <b>|</b> <b>all</b> <b>|</b> <b>holiday</b>
              Similar  to  <b>-g</b>,  but  the  selected days will be printed in the `day numerics color', outlined in
              black.

       <b>-b</b> <u>day1</u>[<u>-day2</u>] <b>|</b> <b>all</b> <b>|</b> <b>holiday</b>
              Similar to — you guessed it — <b>-g</b>, but the selected days will be printed in black.  Since black  is
              the  default for weekdays, -b is primarily used to overriding other flags (e.g., <b>-g</b> <b>all</b> <b>-b</b> <b>sat-sun</b>
              ).

           <b>Note:</b>
              The default for the above options is to  print  Saturdays,  Sundays,  and  holidays  in  the  `day
              numerics  color' and all other days in black.  For backward compatibility with earlier versions of
              <u>pcal</u>, <b>-O</b> and <b>-G</b> alone change all non-black days to the specified color.

       <b>-s</b> <u>[day_numerics_color][/empty_day_box_fill_color]</u>
              Overrides the default value(s) for the color of the numerics for each day and/or the color of  the
              fill  used  on  boxes  for  'empty'  days.   <b>Note:</b>  This  option only applies to PostScript-format
              calendars, not to HTML-format calendars.  These values may be set  independently  of  each  other.
              For  use  with  non-color  printers,  these  values should be in the range 0.0 (black) through 1.0
              (white).  The default values are 0.8 for day numerics and 0.9 for empty day boxes.  For  use  with
              color  printers, these values may optionally be specified as a set of <u>red</u>:<u>green</u>:<u>blue</u> (RGB) values,
              each of which must in the range 0.0 through 1.0.  At least one  `:'  must  be  present  for  these
              values to be recognized as RGB colors; omitted values are set to 0.0.

              This  option  may  also  be  set  semi-permanently  by  altering the makefile (`Makefile' for most
              environments, 'Makefile.DOS' for MS-DOS).

       <b>-F</b> <u>day</u> Selects weekday <u>day</u> as the first day of the week.  The given day  will  appear  in  the  left-most
              column of the calendar.  <u>day</u> may be specified either as a weekday name or, optionally, as a number
              in the range 0 (Sunday) through 6 (Saturday).

              This  option  may  also  be  set  semi-permanently  by  altering the makefile (`Makefile' for most
              environments, 'Makefile.DOS' for MS-DOS).

       <b>-A</b>     Directs <u>pcal</u> to use American date conventions ( <b>mm/dd{/yy}</b> and <b>month</b> <b>dd</b> ) when  parsing  the  date
              file.  This is the default.

              This  option  may  also  be  set  semi-permanently  by  altering the makefile (`Makefile' for most
              environments, 'Makefile.DOS' for MS-DOS).

       <b>-E</b>     Directs <u>pcal</u> to use European date conventions ( <b>dd/mm{/yy}</b> and <b>dd</b> <b>month</b> ) when  parsing  the  date
              file.

              This  option  may  also  be  set  semi-permanently  by  altering the makefile (`Makefile' for most
              environments, 'Makefile.DOS' for MS-DOS).

       <b>-X</b> <u>xtrans</u>
              Specifies the x-axis translation value for positioning the output on the  page.   Positive  values
              shift the output to the right.  Negative values shift the output to the left.

       <b>-Y</b> <u>ytrans</u>
              Specifies  the  y-axis  translation value for positioning the output on the page.  Positive values
              shift the output up.  Negative values shift the output down.

       <b>-x</b> <u>xscale</u>
              Specifies the x-axis scaling factor for the calendar size.

       <b>-y</b> <u>yscale</u>
              Specifies the y-axis scaling factor for the calendar size.

       <b>-t</b> [<u>title_font</u>][<b>/</b><u>size</u>]
              Specifies the name of a font to use for all the calendar heading text:

                     • the month name and year at the top of the calendar (for monthly-format calendars)  or  at
                       the  top of each month (for yearly-format calendars and for the small previous/next-month
                       calendars [if enabled] on monthly-format calendars)

                     • the day-of-week names

                     • the footer strings (if any)

                     • the ``Notes'' box heading (if any; for monthly calendars only)

              For monthly calendars only, the user may optionally specify the font size, which applies  only  to
              the main month/year heading.  For example, <b>pcal</b> <b>-t</b> <b>Times-Roman/54</b> sets the font to Times-Roman and
              the  month/year  point  size  to 54.  The font size may also be changed independently: <b>pcal</b> <b>-t</b> <b>/54</b>
              changes the point size to 54 without affecting the font name.

              Note: For yearly calendars, any specification of font <u>size</u> is ignored.

              This option may also be set  semi-permanently  by  altering  the  makefile  (`Makefile'  for  most
              environments, 'Makefile.DOS' for MS-DOS).

       <b>-d</b> [<u>date_font</u>][<b>/</b><u>size</u>]
              Similar  to the <b>-t</b> option, but selects the font and/or size used for the day numerics (the numbers
              inside the box for each day).

              Note: For yearly calendars, any specification of font <u>size</u> is ignored.

              This option may also be set  semi-permanently  by  altering  the  makefile  (`Makefile'  for  most
              environments, 'Makefile.DOS' for MS-DOS).

       <b>-n</b> [<u>text_font</u>][<b>/</b><u>size</u>]
              Similar  to  the  <b>-t</b>  and  <b>-d</b>  options, but selects the font and/or size used for any `event' text
              associated with each day and for any text in the monthly ``Notes'' box.

              Note: This option applies to monthly calendars only. For yearly calendars, this  option  does  not
              apply.

              This  option  may  also  be  set  semi-permanently  by  altering the makefile (`Makefile' for most
              environments, 'Makefile.DOS' for MS-DOS).

       <b>-L</b> <u>string</u>
              Causes the accompanying string to be  printed  as  a  left-justified  footer.   Format  specifiers
              denoting  the  month  and/or  year  may  appear  in  the  string;  the  appropriate values will be
              substituted upon printing.

       <b>-C</b> <u>string</u>
              Similar to <b>-L</b>, but causes the accompanying string to be printed as a centered footer.  If  the  <b>-H</b>
              flag  (generate  calendar  as HTML table) was specified, this string will be used as the title and
              heading.

       <b>-R</b> <u>string</u>
              Similar to <b>-L</b>, but causes the accompanying string to be printed as a right-justified footer.

       <b>-N</b> <u>string</u>
              Causes the accompanying string to be printed as the heading for the "Notes" box.   Note,  however,
              that <u>pcal</u> makes no attempt to ensure that it fits.

       <b>-D</b> <u>symbol</u> <u>[value]</u>
              Defines the named symbol and an optional value to be associated with that symbol, prior to reading
              the date file.

       <b>-U</b> <u>symbol</u>
              Un-defines the named symbol prior to reading the date file.

       <b>-B</b>     Causes <u>pcal</u> to leave unused calendar day boxes blank as opposed to the default behavior of filling
              them  using  the  `empty day-box fill color' (i.e. the color specified by the <b>-s</b> option [default =
              gray]).

       <b>-#</b> <u>n</u>   Causes <u>pcal</u> to print <u>n</u> copies (maximum: 100) of each output page.

       <b>-S</b>     Causes <u>pcal</u> to suppress printing the  small  calendars.   See  the  <b>CAVEATS</b>  section  for  further
              details.

       <b>-k</b>     Causes <u>pcal</u> to print the small calendars in the upper left corner (the default is to print them at
              the lower right).

       <b>-K</b>     Causes  <u>pcal</u>  to  print the small calendar for the previous month in the upper left corner and the
              next month in the lower right (the default is to print both at the lower right).

       <b>-w</b>     Causes <u>pcal</u> to print a calendar for 12 consecutive months: 3 rows / 4 columns in landscape mode, 4
              rows / 3 columns in portrait mode.  See the <b>CAVEATS</b> section for details on the use of this  option
              with other options.

              Pcal  predefines  the  symbol  <b>whole_year</b>  when the <b>-w</b> flag is in effect, allowing directives like
              `<b>ifdef</b> <b>whole_year</b>' in the configuration file.

       <b>-I</b>     Resets all parameters to the program defaults.

       <b>-c</b>     Causes <u>pcal</u> to generate a date file suitable for use as input to  the  Un*x  <u><a href="../man1/calendar.1.html">calendar</a>(1)</u>  utility.
              The normal PostScript output is suppressed.

       <b>-H</b>     Causes  <u>pcal</u>  to  generate  a  calendar  in  HTML  table  format.  The normal PostScript output is
              suppressed.

              The HTML table format does not support moon graphics,  Julian  date  information,  `day  numerics'
              color, `empty day' `box fill' color, left or right footer strings (but see the <b>-C</b> flag), alternate
              fonts/sizes, transformation and scaling factors, or embedded EPS images.

       <b>-q</b>     This  option  is  only  valid when used in conjunction with the <b>-H</b> (generate HTML-format calendar)
              option.  It generates a yearly-planner style of HTML calendar whereby a  single  column  for  each
              month is used, resulting in table that gives a quicker overview of several months.  Since there is
              less  space  for  text, only the first character of the weekday and the first 5 characters of text
              from each event for that day are printed. The day numerics for holidays are colored  red  but  the
              text  of the holiday event is not printed.  The day numerics are grey for Saturdays and bold black
              for Sundays.

       <b>-z</b> <u>time_zone</u>
              Forces <u>pcal</u> to ignore the moon file and to use its internal algorithm for moon phase calculations,
              adjusting the phase by <u>time_zone</u> hours (where <u>time_zone</u> is expressed in hours west of UTC).

              For example, New York residents (USA Eastern time zone) would use '-z 5' while on Eastern Standard
              Time (winter) and '-z 4' while on Eastern Daylight Time  (summer).   People  in  India  would  use
              '-z-5.5'.  Notice that fractional values are allowed.

              This  option  may  also  be  set  semi-permanently  by  altering the makefile (`Makefile' for most
              environments, 'Makefile.DOS' for MS-DOS).

       <b>-h</b>     Causes <u>pcal</u> to write version information, parameter usage message, and full explanation of options
              and file formats (to <u>stdout</u>) and terminate.

       <b>-u</b>     Causes <u>pcal</u> to write version information and parameter usage message (to <u>stdout</u>) and terminate.

       <b>-v</b>     Causes <u>pcal</u> to write version information only (to <u>stdout</u>) and terminate.

              Pcal predefines the symbol <b>vX_Y_Z</b>, where <b>X_Y_Z</b> denotes the current version of Pcal  (e.g.  version
              4.9.0 predefines the symbol <b>v4_9_0</b>).

       <b>-a</b> <u>output_language</u>
              Select the output language (for the names of months and days on the calendar).

              Currently,  the  following  languages  are  supported:  <b>ca</b>  (Catalan), <b>cs</b> (Czech), <b>da</b> (Danish), <b>de</b>
              (German), <b>el</b> (Greek), <b>en</b> (English), <b>eo</b> (Esperanto), <b>es</b> (Spanish), <b>et</b> (Estonian), <b>fi</b> (Finnish),  <b>fr</b>
              (French),  <b>ha</b> (Hawaiian), <b>hu</b> (Hungarian), <b>it</b> (Italian), <b>lt</b> (Lithuanian), <b>lv</b> (Latvian), <b>nl</b> (Dutch),
              <b>pl</b> (Polish), <b>pt</b> (Portuguese), <b>ro</b> (Romanian), <b>ru</b> (Russian),  <b>sk</b>  (Slovak),  <b>sv</b>  (Swedish),  and  <b>uk</b>
              (Ukrainian).  The default is <b>en</b>.

              Note that this option does <b>not</b> specify the `input language', which is the language used to process
              events in the configuration file ('English', by default, unless changed with the <u>input-language</u> <u>XX</u>
              directive).  See the section <u>The</u> <u>Date</u> <u>File</u> for more details on specifying the `input language'.

              <b>Note:</b>  In  order  to  display  diacritical  marks,  languages  other than English require that the
              characters be remapped.  Normally, no action  is  required  since  <u>pcal</u>  automatically  selects  a
              remapping  which  is  appropriate  to the selected language.  However, if you want to override the
              default remapping for a given language, you would use the <b>-r</b> option (e.g. "-r Latin1").

              Furthermore, an appropriate font should be selected as needed using the <b>-t</b> option (e.g. "-t  some-
              latin1-font-name").   Any  language  using  the  "Latin1" remapping (e.g. French, German, Italian,
              Spanish, etc) requires an ISO 8859-1 ('Latin1') font.  The Greek language requires an  ISO  8859-7
              (similar   to   ELOT-928)  font  (available  from  Angelo  Haritsis  &lt;<a href="mailto:ah@doc.ic.ac.uk">ah@doc.ic.ac.uk</a>&gt;;  also  see
              <a href="http://www.hellenic.net/fonts/">http://www.hellenic.net/fonts/</a>).  Similarly,  Russian  requires  a  KOI8-R  font  while  Ukrainian
              requires a KOI8-U font.

              <u>Pcal</u>  predefines  the  symbol <b>lang_XX</b>, where <b>XX</b> is the two-character abbreviation for the selected
              output language.

       <b>-r</b> [<u>mapping</u>]
              Specifies an 8-bit character set remapping (encoding) for printing the diacritical marks common to
              European languages.

              Note: This option is not usually needed  since  <u>pcal</u>  will  automatically  select  an  appropriate
              default character encoding (mapping) for the language for which the calendar is being generated.

              The  value  specified for <u>mapping</u> is case-insensitive and may be abbreviated to the point where it
              is still unique.  The value used may be any of the following:

                     • "none" (use built-in character set)

                     • "Latin1" (ISO 8859-1)

                     • "Latin2" (ISO 8859-2)

                     • "Latin3" (ISO 8859-3)

                     • "Latin4" (ISO 8859-4)

                     • "Cyrillic" (ISO 8859-5)

                     • "Greek" (ISO 8859-7)

                     • "Latin5" (ISO 8859-9)

                     • "Latin6" (ISO 8859-10)

                     • "Thai" (ISO 8859-11)

                     • "Latin7" (ISO 8859-13)

                     • "Latin8" (ISO 8859-14)

                     • "Latin9" (ISO 8859-15)

                     • "KOI8-R" (Russian)

                     • "KOI8-U" (Ukrainian)

                     • "Roman8"

              This option may also be set  semi-permanently  by  altering  the  makefile  (`Makefile'  for  most
              environments, 'Makefile.DOS' for MS-DOS).

       <b>-T</b> [B|I|R]
              Select  the  default typeface (Bold, Italic, or Roman) for printing date/note text.  This flag may
              be specified multiple times within the date file (via "opt") to reset the font style on the fly  —
              for example, to print all holidays in Bold.

       <b>-W</b> [left|center|right]
              Specify  the  horizontal  alignment  of the month/year heading (left, center, right) (for monthly-
              format calendars only).

       Any option taking a negative value (e.g.  <b>-Y</b> <b>-###</b>) should be specified with no space between  the  option
       and  the  (negative)  value  to  avoid  <u>pcal</u> interpreting the value as an illegal flag and aborting.  For
       example, use ` <u>-Y-50</u>' instead of ` <u>-Y</u> <u>-50</u>' on your option specification.

       Any option (except <b>-G</b> and <b>-O</b>, for  backward-compatibility)  which  normally  takes  an  argument  may  be
       specified  without  the argument in order to reset the value to the program default.  Note that while the
       <b>-D</b> option alone clears all the defined symbols, the <b>-U</b> option alone has no effect.  The <b>-</b> (or <b>--</b>  as  per
       System V) argument may be used to disambiguate command lines such as:

              <b>pcal</b> <b>-t</b> <b>9</b> <b>90</b>

       This could be written instead as one of the following:

              <b>pcal</b> <b>-t</b> <b>-</b> <b>9</b> <b>90</b>
              <b>pcal</b> <b>-t</b> <b>--</b> <b>9</b> <b>90</b>

       If  the  environment variable <b>PCAL_OPTS</b> is defined, its contents are parsed as a command line.  Flags set
       via <b>PCAL_OPTS</b> override the program defaults, but are overridden by options  set  via  <b>opt</b>  lines  in  the
       configuration file or explicitly on the command line.

   <b>Additional</b> <b>Options</b> <b>For</b> <b>Debugging</b> <b>Only</b>
       The  <b>-Z</b> flag is used to print debugging information which is of interest primarily to <u>pcal</u> hackers.  This
       flag is a "hidden" flag; it does not appear as part of the usage  message.   At  present,  the  following
       options are supported:

              • -ZD  print dates and text as read from date file

              • -ZF  print date file search paths

              • -ZM  print moon phases and identify quarters

              • -ZO  print option flags and where set

              • -ZP  print "preprocessor" debug info

              • -ZT  print dates and text as written to output file

              • -Z   turn off all debugging info

       The  subflags  may  be  combined:  e.g.  "-ZDF"  is  equivalent  to "-ZD -ZF".  All of the aforementioned
       debugging information is written to stderr.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       • The ``workday'' and ``holiday'' keywords are aware of only  those  holidays  which  have  already  been
         flagged at the point where they appear.  For example, consider January 1990:

                          January 1990
                       S  M Tu  W Th  F  S
                          1  2  3  4  5  6
                       7  8  9 10 11 12 13
                      14 15 16 17 18 19 20
                      21 22 23 24 25 26 27
                      28 29 30 31

         If the configuration file looked like this:

            workday on_or_before all 15   payday
            3rd Mon in Jan*               MLK day

         ... then <u>pcal</u> would mark the 15th as ``payday'' since at that point in the configuration file it has no
         way  of  knowing that January 15th will later be flagged as a holiday.  If the two lines were reversed,
         such that the holiday preceded the ``workday'' wildcard, then <u>pcal</u>  would  work  as  intended,  marking
         instead the 12th as ``payday''.

         Also,  beware  of  year  boundaries  which affect the handling of all of the day wildcard keywords.  In
         general, it is best to place monthly wildcards such as the example above at the end  of  each  year  to
         achieve the desired effect.

       • Only  the  positive  ordinals  may be used in conjunction with prepositions (e.g. "fourth Sunday before
         12/25").  (It could be argued that "last Sunday before 12/25" should  be  accepted  as  a  synonym  for
         "first Sunday before 12/25", but then what does "last Sunday after 12/25" mean?)

       • When  the  <b>-w</b>  and  <b>-p</b>  options  are used together, <u>pcal</u> revises the y-scale factor in order to use the
         entire portrait page; therefore, the user should avoid using use the <b>-y</b> option when using both  the  <b>-w</b>
         and <b>-p</b> options.  Use of the <b>-w</b> option in any case effectively disables the <b>-m</b>, <b>-M</b>, <b>-j</b>, and <b>-J</b> options.

       • The  output  of the <b>-c</b> option may be used as input to subsequent runs of <u>pcal</u>.  Note, however, that <b>opt</b>
         lines (except for an automatic <b>opt</b> <b>-[A|E]</b>), comments, ``note'' text, and  <b>ifdef</b>'d-out  source  will  be
         lost.

       • The  <b>-S</b>  option  interacts  with <b>note{/&lt;number&gt;}</b>; if used, it should be specified either on the command
         line or prior to the first <b>note</b> line in the date file.

       The original PostScript code to generate the calendars was written by Patrick Wood (Copyright ©  1987  by
       Patrick  Wood  of  Pipeline  Associates,  Inc.), and authorized for modification and redistribution.  The
       calendar file inclusion code was originally written in "<a href="../man1/bs.1.html">bs</a>(1)" by Bill Vogel of AT&amp;T.  Patrick's original
       PostScript was modified and enhanced several times by King Ables, Tim Tessin, Joe Wood, Jeff Mogul,  Mark

       Kantrowitz, Joe Brownlee, Andy Fyfe, Steve Grandi, Geoff Kuenning, Stefan Fronzek (1-column HTML output),
       Bill  Bogstad  (event  deletion  capability), and Bill Marr (embedded EPS images, command-line paper size
       specification, new paper sizes [legal &amp; tabloid], additional character mappings for  new  languages,  and
       various  cleanups).  The moon routines were originally written by Jef Poskanzer and Craig Leres, and were
       incorporated into <u>pcal</u> by Richard Dyson.  International language support was initially  added  by  Angelo
       Haritsis.   Additional languages were added by Andrew Rogers (Esperanto), Lars Wirzenius (Finnish), Pedro
