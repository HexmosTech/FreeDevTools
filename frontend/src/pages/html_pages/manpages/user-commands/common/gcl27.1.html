</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gcl - GCL27 Common Lisp interpreter/compiler

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gcl</b> [ <b>options</b> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  program  <u>gcl</u>  is an implementation of a subset of the Common Lisp Ansi standard.  It is written in C
       and in Common Lisp, and is highly portable.   It includes those features in the  original  definition  of
       Common Lisp, (Guy Steele version 1.), as well as some features from the proposed new standard.

       The  best  documentation is available in <u>texinfo/info</u> form, with there being three groups of information.
       <u>gcl-si</u> for basic common lisp descriptions, and features unique to <u>gcl</u>  The  <u>gcl-tk</u>  info  refers  to  the
       connection with <u>tk</u> window system, allowing all the power of the <u>tcl/tk</u> interaction system to be used from
       lisp.   The  third info file <u>gcl</u> details the Ansi standard for common lisp, to which this subset tries to
       adhere.   It is highly recommended to write programs, which will be in the intersection of gcl27 and ansi
       common lisp.  Unfortunately the Ansi standard is  huge,  and  will  require  a  substantial  effort,  and
       increase in the size of gcl, to include all of it.

       When  <u>gcl</u>  is  invoked from the shell, the variable <u>si::*command-args*</u> is set to the list of command line
       arguments.  Various <u>options</u> are understood:

       <b>-eval</b> <b>command</b>
              Call read and then eval on the <u>command</u> <u>passed</u> <u>in.</u>

       <b>--</b>     Stop processing arguments, setting si::*command-args* to a list containing the arguments after the
              <b>--</b>.

       <b>-load</b> <b>pathname</b>
              Load the file whose <u>pathname</u> is specified after <b>-load</b>.

       <b>-f</b> <b>[pathname]</b>
              Open the file following <b>-f</b> for input (or use *standard-input* if not  supplied),  skip  the  first
              line,  and  then  read and eval the rest of the forms in the file.  Replaces si::*command-args* by
              the the list starting after <b>-f</b> switch.  This can be used as with the shells to write  small  shell
              programs:

       #!/usr/local/bin/gcl.exe -f
       (format t "hello world ~a~%" (nth 1 si::*command-args*))

       The  value  <u>si::*command-args*</u>  will  have  the appropriate value.  Thus if the above 2 line file is made
       executable and called <u>foo</u> then

       tutorial% foo billy
       hello world billy

       NOTE:   On  many  systems  (eg  SunOs)  the  first  line  of  an  executable   script   file   such   as:
       #!/usr/local/bin/gcl.exe  -f  only  reads  the  first  32  characters!    So  if  your pathname where the
       executable together with the '-f' amount to more than 32 characters the  file  will  not  be  recognized.
       Also  the  executable  must  be  the  actual large binary file, [or a link to it], and not just a <u><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></u>
       script.   In latter case the <u><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></u> interpreter would get invoked on the file.

       Alternately one could invoke the file <u>foo</u> without making it executable:

       tutorial% gcl27 -f foo "from bill"
       hello world from bill

       <b>-batch</b> Do not enter the command print loop.  Useful if the other command line arguments do something.  Do
              not print the License and acknowledgement information.   Note  if  your  program  does  print  any
              License information, it must print the GCL27 header information also.

       <b>-dir</b>   Directory  where  the  executable  binary that is running is located.  Needed by save and friends.
              This gets set as si::*system-directory*

       <b>-libdir</b>
              <b>-libdir</b> <u>/d/wfs/gcl-2.0/</u>

              would mean that the files like gcl-tk/tk.o would be found by concatting the  path  to  the  libdir
              path, ie in /d/wfs/gcl-2.0/gcl-tk/tk.o

       <b>-compile</b>
              Invoke the compiler on the filename following <b>-compile</b> Other flags affect compilation.

       <b>-o-file</b>
              If nil follows <b>-o-file</b> then do not produce an <u>.o</u> file.

       <b>-c-file</b>
              If <b>-c-file</b> is specified, leave the intermediate <u>.c</u> file there.

       <b>-h-file</b>
              If <b>-h-file</b> is specified, leave the intermediate <u>.h</u> file there.

       <b>-data-file</b>
              If <b>-data-file</b> is specified, leave the intermediate <u>.data</u> file there.

       <b>-system-p</b>
              If  <b>-system-p</b> is specified then invoke <u>compile-file</u> with the <u>:system-p</u> <u>t</u> keyword argument, meaning
              that the C init function will bear a name based on the name of the file, so that it may be invoked
              by name by C code.

              This GNU package should not be confused with the proprietary program distributed  by  FRANZ,  Inc.
              Nor should it be confused with any public domain or proprietary lisp system.

              For  anything  other than program development, use of the lisp compiler is strongly recommended in
              preference to use of the interpreter, due to much higher speed.

       The GCL27 system contains C and Lisp source files to build a Common Lisp system.   CGL  is  derived  from
       Kyoto  Common LISP (<u>kcl</u>), which was written in 1984 by T. Yuasa and M. Hagiya (working under Professor R.
       Nakajima at the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences, Kyoto University).  The  AKCL  system  work
       was  begun  in  1987 by William Schelter at the University of Texas, Austin,  and continued through 1994.
       In 1994 AKCL was released as GCL27 (GNU Common Lisp) under the GNU public library license.
