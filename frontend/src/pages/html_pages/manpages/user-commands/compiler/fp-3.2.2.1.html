</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fp - Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) integrated development environment

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fp</b> <b>[options]</b> <b>[sourcefile]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  binary  is  the  integrated  development  environment of the <u>Free</u> <u>Pascal</u> <u>Compiler</u> <u>(FPC)</u> which is an
       advanced <u>Turbo</u> <u>Pascal</u> and <u>Delphi</u> <u>(7.0)</u> compatible multitarget Pascal compiler. The compiler engine is not
       based on GCC, but is completely standalone.

       The compiler uses <b><a href="../man1/LD.1.html">LD</a></b>(1) and can use <b><a href="../man1/AS.1.html">AS</a></b>(1) (see parameter -Aas),  but  also  has  its  own  binary  object
       writer.

       The  current  main  targets  are  <u>Go32V2</u>  (Dos  DJGPP  extender), <u>Freebsd,</u> <u>Linux,</u> <u>MacOS,</u> <u>MacOSX,</u> <u>MorphOS,</u>
       <u>Netware,</u> <u>OS/2</u> and <u>Win32.</u>  The other targets (M68K compilers for Atari and  Amiga)  are  either  based  on
       older versions of the compiler or are still in development.

       This  manpage  is  meant  for quick-reference only. FPC comes with a great (2000+ pages) manual, which is
       updated constantly, while this man page can be out of date.

</pre><h4><b>Usage</b></h4><pre>
       The user interface of the IDE has been designed to be similar to Turbo Pascal.  It provides the user with
       a user friendly, but rather powerful editor, an extensive on-line help system and a debugger.

       A text mode windowing system is the base of the user interface. The mouse is supported, but  most  people
       will  use  the keyboard. The user will usually open a few text editor windows in which he will design his
       program, during which he can regularly check and debug through the use of hot keys. The high speed of the
       compiler ensures that programmers can do this often and therefore allows speedy development of code.

</pre><h4><b>Help</b> <b>files</b></h4><pre>
       No help files are provided by default. The user must download  the  Free  Pascal  documentation  in  HTML
       format  and  install  it  into  the  IDE  using the Help-&gt;Files menu. Turbo Pascal .tph files can also be
       installed in this menu and can be useful for source code that ships with <b>.tph</b>files<b>as</b>documentation.

</pre><h4><b>Character</b> <b>sets</b></h4><pre>
       The IDE has been designed for VGA text mode fonts. These fonts  allow  visually  more  interresting  text
       modes than the the VT100 fonts normally used on Unix systems and also more portable, since most operating
       systems use VGA character sets for their text modes.

       When  running on a VT100 compatible terminal, some emulation will occur. Internally the IDE will think it
       is running on a VGA text mode font (most likely code page 850), while all characters will (in the case of
       code page 850) be converted to Latin-1 and VT100 alternate character set characters.

       The Linux console can do VGA fonts and therefore the IDE can be viewed as it  was  intended  on  it.  The
       Linux  console  mode supports the all of the VGA character set through the /dev/vcsa* devices and most of
       it through normal escape sequences. To prevent bad  user  experiences,  the  IDE  has  been  made  rather
       aggressive in using VGA character sets. First it will determine the actual console number you are running
       on  (even  if you run on a pty, like in Midnight Commander). Then the IDE will open the /dev/vcsa* device
       belonging to that console. If permission is denied the IDE will call the grab_vcsa utility,  which  is  a
       setuid root utility which will grant permissions to the vcsa device.

       In  case the vcsa device is not available, the IDE will send escape codes to enable the VGA font. In this
       mode a few characters in the low 32 ascii positions are unavailable, but mainly since  the  full  set  of
       line drawing characters is available the user will notice few differences.

       The  Linux  frame  buffer  device and the Free Pascal IDE are an excellent combination.  With fbdev it is
       possible to use text mode resolutions higher than the normal 80x25, which allows the programmer to see  a
       lot more code at a time.

       The Linux console allows the user to load user defined fonts. If you do this, such a font must have a VGA
       styled  layout, i.e. code page 437/850/... (Note that this does not mean your file system has to use such
       an encoding, the Linux console handles the conversion from ISO-8859-1, UTF-8 or whatever  to  the  font.)
       Since  the  default  fonts have a code page 437 layout, only users that have experimented with fonts will
       have to take care here.

       The IDE recognizes the environment variable CONSOLEFONT_CP in which you can specify the code page of  the
       console  font. Recognized values are currently "cp437" and "cp850".  If you do not set this variable code
       page 437 will be assumed. Currently, if you use code page 850 without setting the variable there won't be
       a huge impact at this time, the characters that the IDE uses exist in both code pages.

       Note: KOI8-R/KOI8-U fonts have all required characters, but the line drawing characters are  not  in  the
       right positions. We may support this in the future, but currently do not.

</pre><h4><b>Keyboard</b></h4><pre>
       Unix  keyboard  handling  is a complicated matter because not all key combinations generate escape codes,
       different terminal emulators generate different escape codes,  and  some  key  combinations  may  trigger
       actions in the X11 Window manager.

       Because  the  Free  Pascal  IDE's  user  interface  is  designed to be similar to Turbo Pascal, including
       keyboard commands, you may experience one of the above  situations.   Some  alternative  keys  have  been
       added, and perhaps more will have to be added in the future.

       When running on the Linux console, the keyboard is reprogrammed for full functionality.

       Here are some common problems you may encounter and possible work-arounds:

       <b>Problem:</b> Selecting text with shift+arrow keys does not work.

       <b>Solution:</b> Use the mouse

       <b>Solution:</b>  Use  "ctrl+k b" to mark start of block,"ctrl+k e" to mark end of block, "ctrl+k h" to hide the
       block.

       <b>Problem:</b> Cut/Copy/Paste keys do not work.

       <b>Solution:</b> Go to Options-&gt;Environment-&gt;Keyboard &amp; mouse and enable  the  Microsoft  styled  Cut/Copy/Paste
       keys.

       <b>Solution:</b> Use the menu bar.

       <b>Problem:</b> Alt key does not work.

       <b>Solution:</b>  Press  Escape  first,  then  the  key without alt. Note that this is not possible on the Linux
       console, but the Alt key does work there.

       If for whatever reason the reprogrammed Linux console keyboard is not  restored  to  the  original  state
       after  exit  (IDE  crash?),  you  can  do something like "/etc/init.d/kbd start" to reprogram it into its
       normal behaviour.
