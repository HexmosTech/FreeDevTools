</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fwb_pf - Policy compiler for OpenBSD packet filter "pf"

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fwb_pf</b> <b>[-vVx]</b> <b>[-d</b> <b>wdir]</b> <b>[-o</b> <b>output.fw]</b> <b>[-i]</b> <b>-f</b> <b>data_file.xml</b> object_name

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>fwb_pf</b>  is  a  firewall  policy  compiler component of Firewall Builder (see <a href="../man1/fwbuilder.1.html">fwbuilder</a>(1)). This compiler
       generates code  for  OpenBSD  Packet  Filter  (pf).  Compiler  reads  objects  definitions  and  firewall
       description  from  the  data  file  specified  with  "-f" option and generates pf configuration files and
       firewall activation script.

       All generated files have names that start with the name  of  the  firewall  object.  Firewall  activation
       script  has  extension ".fw" and is simple shell script that flushes current policy, loads new filter and
       nat rules and then activates pf.  PF configuration file name starts with the name of the firewall object,
       plus "-pf.conf".  NAT configuration file name also starts with the name  of  the  firewall  object,  plus
       "-nat.conf".  For  example,  if  firewall  object  has name "myfirewall", then compiler will create three
       files: "myfirewall.fw", "myfirewall-pf.conf", "myfirewall-nat.conf".

       The data file and the name of the firewall objects must be specified on the command line.  Other  command
       line parameters are optional.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -f FILE
              Specify the name of the data file to be processed.

       -o output.fw
              Specify output file name

       -d wdir
              Specify   working   directory.  Compiler  creates  firewall activation script and PF configuration
              files in this directory.  If this parameter is missing, then all  files  will  be  placed  in  the
              current working directory.

       -v     Be verbose: compiler prints diagnostic messages when it works.

       -V     Print version number and quit.

       -i     When  this  option  is  present,  the last argument on the command line is supposed to be firewall
              object ID rather than its name

       -x     Generate debugging information while working. This option is intended for debugging only  and  may
              produce lots of cryptic messages.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Support for PF has been introduced in version 1.0.1 of Firewall Builder

       Supported features:

       o      both pf.conf and nat.conf files are generated

       o      negation in policy and NAT rules

       o      grouping in "from", "to" and ports using '{' '}' syntax

       o      if  checkbox  "Scrub"  is  checked  in  the  rule options dialog, and rule's action is Accept, the
              compiler generates two (almost) identical rules: first with action 'scrub'  and  the  second  with
              action 'pass quick'

       o      stateful  inspection  in  individual  rule  can  be  turned off in rule options dialog. By default
              compiler adds "keep state" or "modulate state" to each rule with action 'pass'

       o      rule options dialog provides a choice of icmp or tcp rst replies for rules with action "Reject"

       o      compiler adds flag "allow-opts" if match on ip options is needed

       o      compiler can generate rules matching on TCP flags

       o      compiler can generate script adding ip aliases for NAT rules using addresses that do not belong to
              any interface of the firewall

       o      compiler always adds rule "block quick all" at the very bottom of the script to ensure "block  all
              by default" policy even if the policy is empty.

       o      Address ranges in both policy and NAT

       Features that are not supported (yet)

       o      custom services

       What will not be supported (at least not anytime soon)

       o      policy routing
