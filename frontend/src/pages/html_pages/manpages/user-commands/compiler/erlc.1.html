       erlc - Compiler

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>erlc</u>  program  provides  a  common  way  to run all compilers in the Erlang system. Depending on the
       extension of each input file, <u>erlc</u> invokes the appropriate compiler.  Regardless  of  which  compiler  is
       used, the same flags are used to provide parameters, such as include paths and output directory.

       The  current  working directory, <u>"."</u>, is not included in the code path when running the compiler. This is
       to avoid loading Beam files from the current working directory that could potentially be in conflict with
       the compiler or the Erlang/OTP system used by the compiler.

   <b>erlc</b> <b>flags</b> <b>file1.ext</b> <b>file2.ext...</b>
       Compiles one or more files. The files must include the extension, for example,  <u>.erl</u>  for  Erlang  source
       code, or <u>.yrl</u> for Yecc source code. <u>Erlc</u> uses the extension to invoke the correct compiler.

   <b>Generally</b> <b>Useful</b> <b>Flags</b>
       The following flags are supported:

       -I &lt;Directory&gt;
         Instructs  the  compiler to search for include files in the <u>Directory</u>. When encountering an <u>-include</u> or
         <u>-include_lib</u> directive, the compiler searches for header files in the following directories:

         •   <u>"."</u>, the current working directory of the file server

         •   The base name of the compiled file

         •   The directories specified using option <u>-I</u>; the directory specified last is searched first

       -o &lt;Directory&gt;
         The directory where the compiler is to  place  the  output  files.  Defaults  to  the  current  working
         directory.

       -D&lt;Name&gt;
         Defines a macro.

       -D&lt;Name&gt;=&lt;Value&gt;
         Defines  a macro with the specified value. The value can be any Erlang term. Depending on the platform,
         the value may need to be quoted if the shell itself  interprets  certain  characters.  On  Unix,  terms
         containing tuples and lists must be quoted. Terms containing spaces must be quoted on all platforms.

       -WError
         Makes all warnings into errors.

       -W&lt;Number&gt;
         Sets warning level to <u>Number</u>. Defaults to <u>1</u>. To turn off warnings, use <u>-W0</u>.

       -W
         Same as <u>-W1</u>. Default.

       -v
         Enables verbose output.

       -b &lt;Output_type&gt;
         Specifies  the  type of output file.  <u>Output_type</u> is the same as the file extension of the output file,
         but without the period. This option is ignored by compilers that have a single output format.

       -no-server
         Do not use the compile server.

       -server
         Use the compile server.

       -enable-feature &lt;Feature&gt;
         Enables the feature <u>feature</u> during compilation. The special feature <u>all</u>  can  be  used  to  enable  all
         features.

       -disable-feature &lt;feature&gt;
         Disables the feature <u>feature</u> during compilation. The special feature <u>all</u> can be used to disable all non
         permanent features.

       -list-features
         List  short  descriptions  of  the current configurable features. Non-configurable features (those with
         status <u>rejected</u> or <u>permanent</u>) will not be shown.

       -describe-feature &lt;feature&gt;
         Show long description and history of feature <u>feature</u>.

       -M
         Produces a Makefile rule to track header dependencies. The rule is sent to <u>stdout</u>. No  object  file  is
         produced.

       -MMD
         Generate  dependencies  as  a  side-effect.  The  object  file  will be produced as normal. This option
         overrides the option <u>-M</u>.

       -MF &lt;Makefile&gt;
         As option <u>-M</u>, except that the Makefile is written to <u>Makefile</u>. No object file is produced.

       -MD
         Same as <u>-M</u> <u>-MF</u> <u>&lt;File&gt;.Pbeam</u>.

       -MT &lt;Target&gt;
         In conjunction with option <u>-M</u> or <u>-MF</u>, changes the name of the rule emitted to <u>Target</u>.

       -MQ &lt;Target&gt;
         As option <u>-MT</u>, except that characters special to <u>make/1</u> are quoted.

       -MP
         In conjunction with option <u>-M</u> or <u>-MF</u>, adds a phony target for each dependency.

       -MG
         In conjunction with option <u>-M</u> or <u>-MF</u>, considers missing headers as generated files and adds them to the
         dependencies.

       --
         Signals that no more options will follow. The rest of the arguments is treated as  filenames,  even  if
         they start with hyphens.

       +&lt;Term&gt;
         A  flag  starting  with  a  plus  (  <u>+</u>)  rather than a hyphen is converted to an Erlang term and passed
         unchanged to the compiler. For example, option <u>export_all</u> for the Erlang compiler can be  specified  as
         follows:

                erlc +export_all file.erl

         Depending  on  the  platform,  the  value  may need to be quoted if the shell itself interprets certain
         characters. On Unix, terms containing tuples and lists must be quoted. Terms containing spaces must  be
         quoted on all platforms.

   <b>Special</b> <b>Flags</b>
       The following flags are useful in special situations, such as rebuilding the OTP system:

       -pa &lt;Directory&gt;
         Appends  <u>Directory</u>  to  the  front of the code path in the invoked Erlang emulator. This can be used to
         invoke another compiler than the default one.

       -pz &lt;Directory&gt;
         Appends <u>Directory</u> to the code path in the invoked Erlang emulator.

   <b>Supported</b> <b>Compilers</b>
       The following compilers are supported:

       .erl
         Erlang source code. It generates a <u>.beam</u> file.

         Options <u>-P</u>, <u>-E</u>, and <u>-S</u> are equivalent to <u>+'P'</u>, <u>+'E'</u>, and <u>+'S'</u>, except  that  it  is  not  necessary  to
         include the single quotes to protect them from the shell.

         Supported options: <u>-I</u>, <u>-o</u>, <u>-D</u>, <u>-v</u>, <u>-W</u>, <u>-b</u>.

       .S
         Erlang assembler source code. It generates a <u>.beam</u> file.

         Supported options: same as for <u>.erl</u>.

       .core
         Erlang core source code. It generates a <u>.beam</u> file.

         Supported options: same as for <u>.erl</u>.

       .yrl
         Yecc source code. It generates an <u>.erl</u> file.

         Use  option  <u>-I</u>  with  the  name  of  a  file  to  use  that file as a customized prologue file (option
         <u>includefile</u>).

         Supported options: <u>-o</u>, <u>-v</u>, <u>-I</u>, <u>-W</u>.

       .mib
         MIB for SNMP. It generates a <u>.bin</u> file.

         Supported options: <u>-I</u>, <u>-o</u>, <u>-W</u>.

       .bin
         A compiled MIB for SNMP. It generates a <u>.hrl</u> file.

         Supported options: <u>-o</u>, <u>-v</u>.

       .rel
         Script file. It generates a boot file.

         Use option <u>-I</u> to name directories to be searched for application files (equivalent to the <u>path</u>  in  the
         option list for <u>systools:make_script/2</u>).

         Supported option: <u>-o</u>.

       .asn1
         ASN1  file. It creates an <u>.erl</u>, <u>.hrl</u>, and <u>.asn1db</u> file from an <u>.asn1</u> file. Also compiles the <u>.erl</u> using
         the Erlang compiler unless option <u>+noobj</u> is specified.

         Supported options: <u>-I</u>, <u>-o</u>, <u>-b</u>, <u>-W</u>.

       .idl
         IC file. It runs the IDL compiler.

         Supported options: <u>-I</u>, <u>-o</u>.

   <b>Compile</b> <b>Server</b>
       The compile server can be used to potentially speed up the build of multi-file projects  by  avoiding  to
       start an Erlang system for each file to compile. Whether it will speed up the build depends on the nature
       of the project and the build machine.

       By  default,  the  compile  server is not used. It can be enabled by giving <u>erlc</u> the option <u>-server</u> or by
       setting the environment variable <u>ERLC_USE_SERVER</u> to <u>yes</u> or <u>true</u>.

       When the compile server is enabled, <u>erlc</u> will automatically use the server if it is started and start the
       server if has not already started. The server will terminate itself when it has been idle for some number
       of seconds.

       <u>erlc</u> and the compile server communicate using the Erlang distribution. The compile server is started as a
       hidden node, with a name that includes the current user. Thus, each user on  a  computer  has  their  own
       compile server.

       Using  the  compile  server  does  not always speed up the build, as the compile server sometimes must be
       restarted to ensure correctness. Here are some examples of situations that force a restart:

       •   <u>erlc</u> wants to use a different version of Erlang than the compile server is using.

       •   <u>erlc</u> wants to use different options for <u>erl</u> than the compile server was started with.  (A  change  to
           code  path  using the option <u>-pa</u> could cause different parse transforms to be loaded. To be safe, the
           compile server will be restarted when any <u>erl</u> option is changed.)

       •   If the current working directory for <u>erlc</u> is different from the working  directory  active  when  the
           compile  server  was started, <b>and</b> if the compile server has active jobs, it will be restarted as soon
           as those jobs have finished. (Build systems that build files randomly across multiple directories  in
           parallel will probably not benefit from the compile server.)

   <b>Environment</b> <b>Variables</b>
       ERLC_EMULATOR
         The  command  for  starting  the  emulator.  Defaults  to <u>erl</u> in the same directory as the <u>erlc</u> program
         itself, or, if it does not exist, <u>erl</u> in any of the directories specified in environment variable <u>PATH</u>.

       ERLC_USE_SERVER
         Allowed values are <u>yes</u> or <u>true</u> to use the compile server, and <u>no</u>  or  <u>false</u>  to  not  use  the  compile
         server. If other values are given, <u>erlc</u> will print a warning message and continue.

       ERLC_SERVER_ID
         Tells  <u>erlc</u>  to  identify  the compile server by the given name, allowing a single user to run multiple
         unrelated builds in parallel without them affecting each other, which can be useful  for  shared  build
         machines and the like. The name must be alphanumeric, and it defaults to being empty.
