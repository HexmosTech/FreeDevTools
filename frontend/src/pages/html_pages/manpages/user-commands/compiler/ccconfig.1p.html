</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       "ccconfig" will try to determine a usable configuration for Convert::Binary::C from testing a compiler
       executable. It is not necessary that the binaries generated by the compiler can be executed, so
       "ccconfig" can also be used for cross-compilers.

       This tool is still experimental, and you should neither rely on its output without checking, nor expect
       it to work in your environment.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>"--cc"</b> <b>compiler</b>
       This option allows you to explicitly specify a compiler executable. This is especially useful if you
       don't want to use your system compiler. If this options is not given, "ccconfig" tries to guess a
       compiler.

   <b>"--output-file"</b> <b>file</b>
       Write Convert::Binary::C configuration to the specified file. The default is to write the configuration
       to "stdout".

   <b>"--output-format"</b> <b>format</b>
       Specify the output format of the Convert::Binary::C configuration.  The following formats are currently
       supported:

         dumper      Output a %config hash using Data::Dumper
         require     Output in a format suitable for require

       The default is "dumper".

   <b>"--basename"</b> <b>name</b>
       Allows you to change the base name of the temporary test files.  This is used along with the various
       "-ext" options to build the filenames of C source files, preprocessor output files, object files and
       executables.

   <b>"--inc-path"</b> <b>path</b>
       This option allows you to manually set the include path of the compiler. This is useful if "ccconfig"
       cannot determine the include path automatically, most probably because it cannot parse the preprocessor
       output. This option can be specified more than once.

   <b>"--preprocess"</b> <b>rule</b>
       Using this option, you can specify a <u>rule</u> that "ccconfig" uses to run the compiler to get preprocessor
       output. Most compilers write the preprocessor output to standard output when given the "-E" option, i.e.

         cc -E foo.c

       will preprocess <u>foo.c</u> to standard output. The corresponding rule for "ccconfig" would be:

         ccconfig --preprocess='-E %c |'

       The &lt;%c&gt; will be replaced with the C source filename, and the pipe symbol signals that the result will be
       written to standard output.

       The following placeholders can be used in "ccconfig" rules:

         %c    C source file
         %o    object file
         %e    executable file
         %i    preprocessor output file

       Usually, "ccconfig" tries to figure out the correct rules on its own.

   <b>"--compile-obj"</b> <b>rule</b>
       Like "--preprocess", this option allows you to define a rule for how to compile an object file. For most
       compilers, this rule will be something like

         ccconfig --compile-obj='-c -o %o %c'

   <b>"--compile-exe"</b> <b>rule</b>
       Like "--preprocess", this option allows you to define a rule for how to compile an executable file. For
       most compilers, this rule will be something like

         ccconfig --compile-exe='-o %e %c'

       Note that it is sufficient to specify either "--compile-obj" or "--compile-exe". So if your compiler can
       only create object files, that's just fine.

   <b>"--c-ext"</b>
       This option is used along with "--basename" to build the name of a C source file. This is usually set to
       ".c".

   <b>"--pp-ext"</b>
       This option is used along with "--basename" to build the name of a preprocessor output file.

   <b>"--obj-ext"</b>
       This option is used along with "--basename" to build the name of an object file.

   <b>"--exe-ext"</b>
       This option is used along with "--basename" to build the name of an executable file.

   <b>"--nodelete"</b>
       Don't attempt to delete temporary files that have been created by the compiler. Normally, "ccconfig" will
       look for all files with the same basename as the temporary test file and delete them.

   <b>"--norun"</b>
       You can specify this option if the executables generated by your compiler cannot be run on your machine,
       i.e. if you have a cross-compiler. However, "ccconfig" will automatically find out that it cannot run the
       executables.

       When this option is set, a different set of algorithms is used to determine a couple of configuration
       settings. These algorithms are all based upon placing a special signature in the object file. They are
       less reliable that the standard algorithms, so you shouldn't use them unless you have to.

   <b>"--quiet"</b>
       Don't display anything except for the final configuration.

   <b>"--nostatus"</b>
       Hide the status indicator. Recommended if you want to redirect the script output to a file:

         ccconfig --nostatus &gt;config.pl 2&gt;ccconfig.log

   <b>"--version"</b>
       Writes the program name, version and path to standard output.

   <b>"--debug"</b>
       Generate tons of debug output. Don't use unless you know what you're doing.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Normally, a simple

         ccconfig

       without arguments is enough if you want the configuration for your system compiler. While "ccconfig" is
       running, it will write lots of status information to "stderr". When it's done, it will usually dump a
       Perl hash table to "stdout" which can be directly used as a configuration for Convert::Binary::C.

       If you want the configuration for a different compiler, or "ccconfig" cannot determine your system
       compiler automatically, use

         ccconfig -c gcc32

       if your compiler's name is "gcc32".

       If you want to pass additional options to the compiler, you can do so after a double-dash on the command
       line:

         ccconfig -- -g -DDEBUGGING

       or

         ccconfig -c gcc32 -- -ansi -fshort-enums

       If you'd like to interface with the Perl core, you may find a suitable configuration using something
       like:

         ccconfig --cc=`perl -MConfig -e 'print $Config{cc}'` \
                  -- `perl -MConfig -e 'print $Config{ccflags}'`
