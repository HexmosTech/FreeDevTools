</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gm2 - The GNU Modula-2 Compiler

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of compilation is done.  The
       following kinds of input file names are supported:

       <u>file</u><b>.mod</b>
           Modula-2  implementation  or  program  source  files.  See the <b>-fmod=</b> option if you wish to compile a
           project which uses a different source file extension.

       <u>file</u><b>.def</b>
           Modula-2 definition module source files.  Definition modules are  not  compiled  separately,  in  GNU
           Modula-2  definition  modules  are  parsed  as  required  when  program or implementation modules are
           compiled.  See the <b>-fdef=</b> option if you wish to compile a project which uses a different source  file
           extension.

       You can specify more than one input file on the <b>gm2</b> command line,

       "-g"
           create debugging information so that debuggers such as <u>gdb</u> can inspect and control executable.

       "-I"
           used  to  specify the search path for definition and implementation modules.  An example is:  "gm2 -g
           -c -I.:../../libs foo.mod".  If this option is not specified then the default  path  is  added  which
           consists of the current directory followed by the appropriate language dialect library directories.

       "-fauto-init"
           turns  on  auto initialization of pointers to NIL.  Whenever a block is created all pointers declared
           within this scope will have their addresses assigned to NIL.

       "-fbounds"
           turns on run time subrange, array index and indirection via "NIL" pointer checking.

       "-fcase"
           turns on compile time checking to check whether a "CASE" statement requires an "ELSE" clause when  on
           was not specified.

       "-fcpp"
           preprocess  the source with <b>cpp</b> <b>-lang-asm</b> <b>-traditional-cpp</b> For further details about these options If
           <b>-fcpp</b> is supplied then all definition modules and implementation modules which  are  parsed  will  be
           prepossessed by <b>cpp</b>.

       "-fdebug-builtins"
           call a real function, rather than the builtin equivalent.  This can be useful for debugging parameter
           values to a builtin function as it allows users to single step code into a real function.

       "-fdef="
           recognize  the  specified  suffix  as  a  definition module filename.  The default implementation and
           module filename suffix is <u>.def</u>.  If this option is used GNU Modula-2 will still  fall  back  to  this
           default if a requested definition module is not found.

       "-fdump-system-exports"
           display all inbuilt system items.  This is an internal command line option.

       "-fexceptions"
           turn  on  exception handling code.  By default this option is on.  Exception handling can be disabled
           by <b>-fno-exceptions</b> and no references are made to the run time exception libraries.

       "-fextended-opaque"
           allows opaque types to be implemented as any type.  This is a GNU Modula-2 extension and it  requires
           that  the implementation module defining the opaque type is available so that it can be resolved when
           compiling the module which imports the opaque type.

       "-ffloatvalue"
           turns on run time checking to check whether a floating point number is about to exceed range.

       "-fgen-module-list=<u>filename</u>"
           attempt to find all modules when linking and generate a module list.  If the <u>filename</u> is <b>-</b>  then  the
           contents  are not written and only used to force the linking of all module ctors.  This option cannot
           be used if <b>-fuse-list=</b> is enabled.

       "-findex"
           generate code to check whether array index values are out of bounds.  Array  index  checking  can  be
           disabled via <b>-fno-index</b>.

       "-fiso"
           turn on ISO standard features.  Currently this enables the ISO "SYSTEM" module and alters the default
           library search path so that the ISO libraries are searched before the PIM libraries.  It also effects
           the behavior of "DIV" and "MOD" operators.

       "-flibs="
           modifies the default library search path.  The libraries supplied are: m2pim, m2iso, m2min, m2log and
           m2cor.   These  map  onto the Programming in Modula-2 base libraries, ISO standard libraries, minimal
           library support, Logitech compatible library and Programming in Modula-2 with  coroutines.   Multiple
           libraries  can  be  specified and are comma separated with precedence going to the first in the list.
           It is not necessary to use -flibs=m2pim or -flibs=m2iso if you also specify  -fpim,  -fpim2,  -fpim3,
           -fpim4  or -fiso.  Unless you are using -flibs=m2min you should include m2pim as the they provide the
           base modules which all other dialects utilize.  The option <b>-fno-libs=-</b> disables the <b>gm2</b>  driver  from
           modifying the search and library paths.

       "-static-libgm2"
           On  systems  that provide the m2 runtimes as both shared and static libraries, this option forces the
           use of the static version.

       "-fm2-g"
           improve the debugging experience for new programmers at the expense of generating "nop"  instructions
           if  necessary to ensure single stepping precision over all code related keywords.  An example of this
           is in termination of a list of nested "IF" statements where multiple "END" keywords are mapped onto a
           sequence of "nop" instructions.

       "-fm2-lower-case"
           render keywords in error messages using lower case.

       "-fm2-pathname="
           specify the module mangled prefix name for all modules in the following include paths.

       "-fm2-pathnameI"
           for internal use only: used by the driver to copy the user facing -I option.

       "-fm2-plugin"
           insert plugin to identify run time errors at compile time (default on).

       "-fm2-prefix="
           specify the module mangled prefix name.  All exported symbols from a definition module will have  the
           prefix name.

       "-fm2-statistics"
           generates quadruple information: number of quadruples generated, number of quadruples remaining after
           optimization and number of source lines compiled.

       "-fm2-strict-type"
           experimental flag to turn on the new strict type checker.

       "-fm2-whole-program"
           compile  all implementation modules and program module at once.  Notice that you need to take care if
           you are compiling different dialect modules (particularly with the  negative  operands  to  modulus).
           But this option, when coupled together with "-O3", can deliver huge performance improvements.

       "-fmod="
           recognize  the  specified  suffix as implementation and module filenames.  The default implementation
           and module filename suffix is <u>.mod</u>.  If this option is used GNU Modula-2 will still fall back to this
           default if it needs to read an implementation module and the specified  suffixed  filename  does  not
           exist.

       "-fnil"
           generate code to detect accessing data through a "NIL" value pointer.  Dereferencing checking through
           a "NIL" pointer can be disabled by <b>-fno-nil</b>.

       "-fpim"
           turn  on  PIM standard features.  Currently this enables the PIM "SYSTEM" module and determines which
           identifiers are pervasive (declared in the base module).  If no other <b>-fpim[234]</b> switch is used  then
           division and modulus operators behave as defined in PIM4.

       "-fpim2"
           turn  on  PIM-2  standard  features.  Currently this removes "SIZE" from being a pervasive identifier
           (declared in the base module).  It places "SIZE"  in  the  "SYSTEM"  module.   It  also  effects  the
           behavior of "DIV" and "MOD" operators.

       "-fpim3"
           turn  on  PIM-3  standard  features.   Currently  this  only  effects the behavior of "DIV" and "MOD"
           operators.

       "-fpim4"
           turn on PIM-4 standard features.  Currently this  only  effects  the  behavior  of  "DIV"  and  "MOD"
           operators.

       "-fpositive-mod-floor-div"
           forces  the "DIV" and "MOD" operators to behave as defined by PIM4.  All modulus results are positive
           and the results from the division are rounded to the floor.

       "-fpthread"
           link against the pthread library.  By default this option is on.  It can be disabled by <b>-fno-pthread</b>.
           GNU Modula-2 uses the GCC pthread libraries to implement coroutines (see  the  SYSTEM  implementation
           module).

       "-frange"
           generate  code  to  check  the  assignment range, return value range set range and constructor range.
           Range checking can be disabled via <b>-fno-range</b>.

       "-freturn"
           generate code to check that functions always exit with a "RETURN" and do not fall  out  at  the  end.
           Return checking can be disabled via <b>-fno-return</b>.

       "-fruntime-modules="
           specify,  using  a  comma  separated  list, the run time modules and their order.  These modules will
           initialized first before any other modules in the application dependency.  By default  the  run  time
           modules        list        is        set        to       "m2iso:RTentity,m2iso:Storage,m2iso:SYSTEM,"
           "m2iso:M2RTS,m2iso:RTExceptions,m2iso:IOLink".  Note that these modules will only be linked into your
           executable if they are required.  Adding a long list of dependent modules will not effect the size of
           the executable it merely states the initialization order should they be required.

       "-fscaffold-dynamic"
           the option  ensures  that  <b>gm2</b>  will  generate  a  dynamic  scaffold  infrastructure  when  compiling
           implementation and program modules.  By default this option is on.  Use <b>-fno-scaffold-dynamic</b> to turn
           it off or select <b>-fno-scaffold-static</b>.

       "-fscaffold-c"
           generate a C source scaffold for the current module being compiled.

       "-fscaffold-c++"
           generate a C++ source scaffold for the current module being compiled.

       "-fscaffold-main"
           force the generation of the <b>main</b> function.  This is not necessary if the <b>-c</b> is omitted.

       "-fscaffold-static"
           the  option  ensures  that <b>gm2</b> will generate a static scaffold within the program module.  The static
           scaffold consists of sequences of calls to  all  dependent  module  initialization  and  finalization
           procedures.   The  static  scaffold  is  useful  for debugging and single stepping the initialization
           blocks of implementation modules.

       "-fshared"
           generate a shared library from the module.

       "-fsoft-check-all"
           turns on all run time checks.  This is the same as invoking GNU Modula-2 using  the  command  options
           "-fnil" "-frange" "-findex" "-fwholevalue" "-fwholediv" "-fcase" "-freturn".

       "-fsources"
           displays the path to the source of each module.  This option can be used at compile time to check the
           correct definition module is being used.

       "-fswig"
           generate a swig interface file.

       "-funbounded-by-reference"
           enable  optimization  of unbounded parameters by attempting to pass non "VAR" unbounded parameters by
           reference.  This optimization avoids the implicit copy inside the  callee  procedure.   GNU  Modula-2
           will  only allow unbounded parameters to be passed by reference if, inside the callee procedure, they
           are not written to, no address is calculated on the array and it is not passed as a "VAR"  parameter.
           Note  that  it  is possible to write code to break this optimization, therefore this option should be
           used carefully.  For example it would be possible to take the address of an array, pass  the  address
           and  the  array  to a procedure, read from the array in the procedure and write to the location using
           the address parameter.

           Due to the dangerous nature of this option it is not enabled when the <b>-O</b> option is specified.

       "-fuse-list=<u>filename</u>"
           if <b>-fscaffold-static</b> is enabled then use the file <u>filename</u> for the initialization order  of  modules.
           Whereas  if  <b>-fscaffold-dynamic</b>  is  enabled then use this file to force linking of all module ctors.
           This option cannot be used if <b>-fgen-module-list=</b> is enabled.

       "-fwholediv"
           generate code to detect whole number division by zero or modulus by zero.

       "-fwholevalue"
           generate code to detect whole number overflow and underflow.

       "-Wcase-enum"
           generate a warning if a "CASE" statement selects on an enumerated type expression and  the  statement
           is  missing  one  or  more "CASE" labels.  No warning is issued if the "CASE" statement has a default
           "ELSE" clause.  The option <b>-Wall</b> will turn on this flag.

       "-Wuninit-variable-checking"
           issue a warning if a variable is used before it is initialized.  The  checking  only  occurs  in  the
           first basic block in each procedure.  It does not check parameters, array types or set types.

       "-Wuninit-variable-checking=all,known,cond"
           issue  a warning if a variable is used before it is initialized.  The checking will only occur in the
           first basic block in each procedure if <b>known</b> is specified.  If <b>cond</b> or <b>all</b> is specified then checking
           continues into conditional branches of the flow graph.  All checking will stop when a procedure  call
           is  invoked  or  the  top  of  a  loop  is encountered.  The option <b>-Wall</b> will turn on this flag with
           <b>-Wuninit-variable-checking=known</b>.  The <b>-Wuninit-variable-checking=all</b> will increase compile time.
