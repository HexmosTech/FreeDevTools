       gm2 - The GNU Modula-2 Compiler

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of compilation is done.  The
       following kinds of input file names are supported:

       <u>file</u><b>.mod</b>
           Modula-2  implementation  or  program  source  files.  See the <b>-fmod=</b> option if you wish to compile a
           project which uses a different source file extension.

       <u>file</u><b>.def</b>
           Modula-2 definition module source files.  Definition modules are  not  compiled  separately,  in  GNU
           Modula-2  definition  modules  are  parsed  as  required  when  program or implementation modules are
           compiled.  See the <b>-fdef=</b> option if you wish to compile a project which uses a different source  file
           extension.

       You can specify more than one input file on the <b>gm2</b> command line,

       "-g"
           create debugging information so that debuggers such as <u>gdb</u> can inspect and control executables.

       "-I"
           used  to  specify the search path for definition and implementation modules.  An example is:  "gm2 -g
           -c -I.:../../libs foo.mod".  If this option is not specified then the default  path  is  added  which
           consists of the current directory followed by the appropriate language dialect library directories.

       "-fobject-path="
           used  to  specify  the  path  for  objects  during  the  linking  stage.   An  example  is:  "gm2  -g
           -fobject-path=.:../../libs/O2 -I.:../../libs foo.mod".  The combination of "-I" and  "-fobject-path="
           allows  projects  to  keep  various  styles  of objects separate from their source counterparts.  For
           example it would be possible to compile implementation modules with different levels of  optimization
           and  with/without debugging and keep them in separate directories.  If the "-fobject-path=" option is
           not specified then it is set internally by using the path as specified by the "-I"  option.   If  the
           "-I"  was  also  not  specified  then  it  uses  the current directory.  In all cases the appropriate
           language dialect library directories are appended to the end of the path.

       "-fdebug-builtins"
           call a real function, rather than the builtin equivalent.  This can be useful for debugging parameter
           values to a builtin function as it allows users to single step code into a real function.

       "-fdump-system-exports"
           display all inbuilt system items.  This is an internal command line option.

       "-fswig"
           generate a swig interface file.

       "-fshared"
           generate a shared library from the module.

       "-fmakeinit"
           generate the start up C++ code for the module, a file <b>_</b><u>m2_modulename.cpp</u>  is  created.   This  is  an
           internal command line option.

       "-fruntime-modules="
           specify,  using  a  comma  separated  list,  the runtime modules and their order.  These modules will
           initialized first before any other modules in the application dependancy.   By  default  the  runtime
           modules list is set to "Storage,SYSTEM,M2RTS,RTExceptions,IOLink".  Note that these modules will only
           be linked into your executable if they are required.  So adding a long list of dependant modules will
           not  effect  the  size  of  the  executable  it merely states the initialisation order should they be
           required.

       "-fnil"
           generate code to detect accessing data through a "NIL" value pointer.

       "-fno-nil"
           do not generate code to detect accessing data through a "NIL" value pointer.

       "-fwholediv"
           generate code to detect whole number division by zero or modulus by zero.

       "-fno-wholediv"
           do not generate code to detect whole number division by zero or modulus by zero.

       "-findex"
           generate code to check whether array index values are out of bounds.

       "-fno-index"
           do not generate code to check whether array index values are out of bounds.

       "-frange"
           generate code to check the assignment range, return value range set range and constructor range.

       "-fno-range"
           do not generate code to check the assignment range, return value  range  set  range  and  constructor
           range.

       "-freturn"
           generate code to check that functions always exit with a "RETURN" and do not fall out at the end.

       "-fcase"
           turns  on compile time checking to check whether a "CASE" statement requires an "ELSE" clause when on
           was not specified.

       "-fsoft-check-all"
           turns on all runtime checks.  This is the same as invoking GNU Modula-2  using  the  command  options
           "-fnil" "-frange" "-findex" "-fwholediv" "-fcase" "-freturn".

       "-fauto-init"
           turns on auto initialization of pointers to NIL.  Whenever a block is created all pointers declarated
           within this scope will have their addresses assigned to NIL.

       "-fno-exceptions"
           turns  off  all  generation  of  exception  handling  code  and no references are made to the runtime
           exception libraries.

       "-v"
           display all calls to subsidiary programs, such as the C preprocessor, the  GNU  Modula-2  linker  and
           compiler.

       "-fm2-statistics"
           generates quadruple information: number of quadruples generated, number of quadruples remaining after
           optimisation and number of source lines compiled.

       "-fm2-whole-program"
           compile  all implementation modules and program module at once.  Notice that you need to take care if
           you are compiling different dialect modules (particularly with the  negative  operands  to  modulus).
           But this option, when coupled together with "-O3", can deliver huge performance improvements.

       "-fm2-g"
           improve  the debugging experience for new programmers at the expense of generating "nop" instructions
           if necessary to ensure single stepping precision over all code related keywords.  An example of  this
           is in termination of a list of nested "IF" statements where multiple "END" keywords are mapped onto a
           sequence of "nop" instructions.

       "-fm2-lower-case"
           render keywords in error messages using lower case.

       "-fmakelist"
           this  option  is  only  applicable  when  linking  a  program  module.   The compiler will generate a
           <u>modulename.lst</u> file which contains a list indicating the initialisation order of  all  modules  which
           are  to  be  linked.  The  actual  link does not occur.  The GNU Modula-2 linker scans all "IMPORT"s,
           generates a list of dependencies and produces an ordered list for initialisation.  It  will  probably
           get  the order wrong if your project has cyclic dependencies, but the <u>.lst</u> file is plain text and can
           be modified if required.  Once the <u>.lst</u> file is created it can be used by the compiler to  link  your
           project via the <b>-fuselist</b> option.  It has no effect if the <b>-c</b> option is present.

       "fno-pthread"
           do  not  automatically  link  against  the  pthread  library.  This option is likely useful if gm2 is
           configured as a cross compiler targetting embedded systems.  By default GNU  Modula-2  uses  the  GCC
           pthread libraries to implement coroutines (see the SYSTEM implementation module).

       "-fuselist"
           providing  <b>gm2</b>  has been told to link the program module this option uses the file <u>modulename.lst</u> for
           the initialisation order of modules.

       "-fcpp"
           preprocess the source with <b>cpp</b> <b>-lang-asm</b> <b>-traditional-cpp</b> For further details about these options see
           If <b>-fcpp</b> is supplied then all definition modules and implementation modules which are parsed will  be
           preprocessed by <b>cpp</b>.

       "-fiso"
           turn  on ISO standard features. Currently this enables the ISO "SYSTEM" module and alters the default
           library search path so that the ISO libraries are searched before the PIM libraries.  It also effects
           the behaviour of "DIV" and "MOD" operators.  See

       "-fpim"
           turn on PIM standard features. Currently this enables the PIM "SYSTEM" module  and  determines  which
           identifiers  are  pervasive (declared in the base module). If no other <b>-fpim[234]</b> switch is used then
           division and modulus operators behave as defined in PIM4.  See

       "-fpim2"
           turn on PIM-2 standard features. Currently this removes "SIZE"  from  being  a  pervasive  identifier
           (declared  in  the  base  module).   It  places  "SIZE"  in the "SYSTEM" module.  It also effects the
           behaviour of "DIV" and "MOD" operators.  See

       "-fpim3"
           turn on PIM-3 standard features. Currently this  only  effects  the  behaviour  of  "DIV"  and  "MOD"
           operators.  See

       "-fpim4"
           turn  on  PIM-4  standard  features.  Currently  this  only  effects the behaviour of "DIV" and "MOD"
           operators.  See

       "-fpositive-mod-floor-div"
           forces the "DIV" and "MOD" operators to behave as defined by PIM4.  All modulus results are  positive
           and the results from the division are rounded to the floor.  See

       "-flibs="
           modifies the default library search path.  The libraries supplied are: m2pim, m2iso, m2min, m2log and
           m2cor.   These  map  onto the Programming in Modula-2 base libraries, ISO standard libraries, minimal
           library support, Logitech compatible library and Programming in Modula-2 with  coroutines.   Multiple
           libraries  can  be  specified and are comma separated with precidence going to the first in the list.
           It is not necessary to use -flibs=m2pim or -flibs=m2iso if you also specify  -fpim,  -fpim2,  -fpim3,
           -fpim4  or -fiso.  Unless you are using -flibs=m2min you should include m2pim as the they provide the
           base modules which all other dialects utilize.

       "-fextended-opaque"
           allows opaque types to be implemented as any type. This is a GNU Modula-2 extension and  it  requires
           that  the implementation module defining the opaque type is available so that it can be resolved when
           compiling the module which imports the opaque type.

       "-fsources"
           displays the path to the source of each module.  This option can be used at compile time to check the
           correct definition module is being used.

       "-fmodules"
           displays the path to each modules object file.  This option can only be invoked with the "-c" option.
           It is used to see the location of objects when linking occurs.

       "-fdef="
           recognise the specified suffix as a definition module filename.  The default implmentation and module
           filename suffix is <u>.def</u>.  If this option is used GNU Modula-2 will still fall back to this default if
           a requested definition module is not found.

       "-fmod="
           recognise the specified suffix as implementation and module filenames.  The default implmentation and
           module filename suffix is <u>.mod</u>.  If this option is used GNU Modula-2 will still  fall  back  to  this
           default  if  it  needs  to  read an implmentation module and the specified suffixed filename does not
           exist.

       "-fxcode"
           issues all errors and warnings in the <u>Xcode</u> format.

       "-fonlylink"
           only link the modula-2 application, do not compile the program module beforehand.

       "-funbounded-by-reference"
           enable optimization of unbounded parameters by attempting to pass non "VAR" unbounded  parameters  by
           reference.  This optimization avoids the implicit copy inside the callee procedure. GNU Modula-2 will
           only  allow  unbounded parameters to be passed by reference if, inside the callee procedure, they are
           not written to, no address is calculated on the array and it is not  passed  as  a  "VAR"  parameter.
           Note  that  it  is possible to write code to break this optimization, therefore this option should be
           used carefully.  For example it would be possible to take the address of an array, pass  the  address
           and  the  array  to a procedure, read from the array in the procedure and write to the location using
           the address parameter.

           Due to the dangerous nature of this option it is not enabled when the -O option is specified.

       "-Wverbose-unbounded"
           inform the user which non "VAR" unbounded parameters will be passed by reference.  This only produces
           output if the option <b>-funbounded-by-reference</b> is also supplied on the command line.

       "-Wstudents"
           checks for bad programming style. This option is aimed at new users of Modula-2 in that it checks for
           situations which might cause confusion and thus mistakes.  It checks whether variables  of  the  same
           name  are  declared  in different scopes and whether variables look like keywords.  Experienced users
           might find this option too aggressive.

       "-Wpedantic"
           forces the compiler to reject nested "WITH" statements referencing the same record  type.   Does  not
           allow  multiple imports of the same item from a module.  It also checks that: procedure variables are
           written to before being read; variables are not only written to but read from; variables are declared
           and used.  If the compiler encounters a variable being read before written it will terminate  with  a
           message.   It  will  check  that "FOR" loop indices are not used outside the end of this loop without
           being reset.

       "-Wpedantic-param-names"
           procedure parameter names are checked in the definition module against  their  implementation  module
           counterpart.   This  is  not  necessary  in  ISO or PIM versions of Modula-2, but it can be extremely
           useful, as long as code is intentionally written in this way.

       "-Wpedantic-cast"
           warns if the ISO system function is used and if the size of the variable is different  from  that  of
           the  type.  This  is legal in ISO Modula-2, however it can be dangerous. Some users may prefer to use
           "VAL" instead in these situations and use "CAST" exclusively for changes in  type  on  objects  which
           have the same size.

       "-Wunused-variable"
           warns if a variable has been declared and it not used.

       "-Wunused-parameter"
           warns if a parameter has been declared and it not used.

       "-Wall"
           turn on all Modula-2 warnings.
