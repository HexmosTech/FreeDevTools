       <b>mpicc</b> <b>[--showme</b> <b>|</b> <b>--showme:compile</b> <b>|</b> <b>--showme:link]</b> <b>...</b>

       <b>mpic++</b> <b>[--showme</b> <b>|</b> <b>--showme:compile</b> <b>|</b> <b>--showme:link]</b> <b>...</b>

       <b>mpicxx</b> <b>[--showme</b> <b>|</b> <b>--showme:compile</b> <b>|</b> <b>--showme:link]</b> <b>...</b>

       <b>mpijavac</b> <b>[--showme</b> <b>|</b> <b>--showme:compile</b> <b>|</b> <b>--showme:link]</b> <b>...</b>

       The following deprecated commands are also available — but <b>mpifort</b> should be used instead:

       <b>mpif77</b> <b>[--showme</b> <b>|</b> <b>--showme:compile</b> <b>|</b> <b>--showme:link]</b> <b>...</b>

       <b>mpif90</b> <b>[--showme</b> <b>|</b> <b>--showme:compile</b> <b>|</b> <b>--showme:link]</b> <b>...</b>

       On case-sensitive filesystems, the following command will also be available:

       <b>mpiCC</b> <b>[--showme</b> <b>|</b> <b>--showme:compile</b> <b>|</b> <b>--showme:link]</b> <b>...</b>

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The options below apply to all of the wrapper compilers:

       • <b>--showme</b>: This option comes in several different variants (see below). None of the variants invokes the
         underlying  compiler;  they  all  provide  information  on  how the underlying compiler would have been
         invoked had <b>--showme</b> not been used. The basic <b>--showme</b> option outputs the command line  that  would  be
         executed to compile the program.

         <b>NOTE:</b>
            If  a  non-filename argument is passed on the command line, the <b>--showme</b> option will <u>not</u> display any
            additional flags. For example, both <b>"mpicc</b> <b>--showme</b> and <b>mpicc</b> <b>--showme</b> <b>my_source.c</b> will show all the
            wrapper-supplied flags. But <b>mpicc</b> <b>--showme</b> <b>-v</b> will only show the underlying compiler name and <b>-v</b>.

       • <b>--showme:compile</b>: Output the compiler flags that would have been supplied to the underlying compiler.

       • <b>--showme:link</b>: Output the linker flags that would have been supplied to the underlying compiler.

       • <b>--showme:command</b>: Outputs the underlying compiler command (which may be one or more tokens).

       • <b>--showme:incdirs</b>: Outputs a space-delimited (but otherwise undecorated) list of  directories  that  the
         wrapper compiler would have provided to the underlying compiler to indicate where relevant header files
         are located.

       • <b>--showme:libdirs</b>:  Outputs  a  space-delimited (but otherwise undecorated) list of directories that the
         wrapper compiler would have provided to the underlying linker to indicate where relevant libraries  are
         located.

       • <b>--showme:libs</b>  Outputs  a  space-delimited  (but  otherwise undecorated) list of library names that the
         wrapper compiler would have used to link an application. For example: <b>mpi</b> <b>open-pal</b> <b>util</b>.

       • <b>--showme:version</b>: Outputs the version number of Open MPI.

       • <b>--showme:help</b>: Output a brief usage help message.

       See the man page for your underlying compiler for other options that can be passed through mpicc.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Conceptually, the role of these commands is quite simple: transparently add relevant compiler and  linker
       flags  to the user’s command line that are necessary to compile / link Open MPI programs, and then invoke
       the underlying compiler to actually perform the command.

       As such, these commands are frequently referred to as “wrapper” compilers because they  do  not  actually
       compile  or  link  applications  themselves;  they only add in command line flags and invoke the back-end
       compiler.

</pre><h4><b>BACKGROUND</b></h4><pre>
       Open MPI provides wrapper compilers for several languages:

       • <b>mpicc</b>: C

       • <b>mpic++</b>, <b>mpicxx</b> (and on systems with case-sensitive file systems, <b>mpiCC</b>): C++

         <b>NOTE:</b>
            <b>mpic++</b>, <b>mpicxx</b>, and <b>mpiCC</b> all invoke the same underlying C++ compiler with the same options. All are
            provided as compatibility with other MPI implementations.

       • <b>mpifort</b> (and its legacy/deprecated aliaes <b>mpif77</b> and <b>mpif90</b>): Fortran

       • <b>mpijavac</b>: Java

       The wrapper compilers for each of the languages are identical; they  can  be  use  interchangeably.   The
       different names are provided solely for backwards compatibility.

</pre><h4><b>FORTRAN</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       The  Fortran  wrapper  compiler  for MPI (<b>mpifort</b>, and its legacy/deprecated names <b>mpif77</b> and <b>mpif90</b>) can
       compile and link MPI applications that use any/all of the MPI Fortran bindings: <b>mpif.h</b>, the  <b>mpi</b>  module,
       and the <b>mpi_f08</b> module (assuming Open MPI was installed with support for each of these Fortran bindings).
       Specifically:  it  is  no  longer  necessary to use different wrapper compilers for applications that use
       <b>mpif.h</b> vs. applications that use the <b>mpi</b> module — just use <b>mpifort</b> for all Fortran MPI applications.

       Note, however, that the Fortran compiler  may  require  additional  command-line  options  to  enforce  a
       specific  Fortran  dialect.  For  example,  in  some  versions  of  the IBM XLF compiler, if <b>xlf90</b> is the
       underlying Fortran compiler, <b>-qfixed</b> may be necessary to compile fixed-format Fortran source files.

       Finally, note that <b>mpifort</b> will be inoperative and will return an error on use if Fortran support was not
       built into the MPI layer.

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mpicc</b> is a convenience wrappers for the underlying C  compiler.   Translation  of  an  Open  MPI  program
       requires  the  linkage  of  the  Open  MPI-specific libraries which may not reside in one of the standard
       search directories of <b><a href="../man1/ld.1.html">ld</a>(1)</b>. It also often requires the inclusion of header files what may  also  not  be
       found in a standard location.

       <b>mpicc</b>  passes its arguments to the underlying C compiler along with the <b>-I</b>, <b>-L</b> and <b>-l</b> options required by
       Open MPI programs.

       The same is true for all the other language wrapper compilers.

       The Open MPI Team <u>strongly</u> encourages using the wrapper compilers instead of attempting to  link  to  the
       Open  MPI  libraries  manually.  This  allows  the  specific implementation of Open MPI to change without
       forcing changes to linker directives in users’ Makefiles. Indeed, the specific set of flags and libraries
       used by the wrapper compilers depends on how Open MPI was configured and built;  the  values  can  change
       between different installations of the same version of Open MPI.

       Indeed,  since the wrappers are simply thin shells on top of an underlying compiler, there are very, very
       few compelling reasons <u>not</u> to use Open MPI’s wrapper compilers. When  it  is  not  possible  to  use  the
       wrappers  directly, the <b>--showme:compile</b> and <b>--showme:link</b> options should be used to determine what flags
       the wrappers would have used. For example:

          shell$ cc -c file1.c `mpicc --showme:compile`

          shell$ cc -c file2.c `mpicc --showme:compile`

          shell$ cc file1.o file2.o `mpicc --showme:link` -o my_mpi_program

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       It is possible to make the wrapper compilers  multi-lib  aware.  That  is,  the  libraries  and  includes
       specified may differ based on the compiler flags specified (for example, with the GNU compilers on Linux,
       a  different  library  path  may be used if <b>-m32</b> is seen versus <b>-m64</b> being seen). This is not the default
       behavior in a standard build, but can be activated (for example, in a binary package  providing  both  32
       and 64 bit support). <u>More</u> <u>information</u> <u>can</u> <u>be</u> <u>found</u> <u>here</u>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  strings  that  the  wrapper  compilers  insert  into the command line before invoking the underlying
       compiler are stored in a text file created by Open MPI and installed  to  <b>$pkgdata/NAME-wrapper-data.txt</b>,
       where:

       • <b>$pkgdata</b> is typically <b>$prefix/share/openmpi</b>

       • <b>$prefix</b> is the top installation directory of Open MPI

       • <b>NAME</b> is the name of the wrapper compiler (e.g., <b>$pkgdata/mpicc-wrapper-data.txt</b>)

       It  is rarely necessary to edit these files, but they can be examined to gain insight into what flags the
       wrappers are placing on the command line.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       By default, the wrappers use the compilers that  were  selected  when  Open  MPI  was  configured.  These
       compilers  were either found automatically by Open MPI’s “configure” script, or were selected by the user
       in the <b>CC</b>, <b>CXX</b>, and/or <b>FC</b>  environment  variables  before  <b>configure</b>  was  invoked.  Additionally,  other
       arguments specific to the compiler may have been selected by configure.

       These values can be selectively overridden by either editing the text files containing this configuration
       information (see the <u>FILES</u> section), or by setting selected environment variables of the form <b>ompi_value</b>.

       Valid value names are:

       • <b>CPPFLAGS</b>: Flags added when invoking the preprocessor (C or C++)

       • <b>LDFLAGS</b>: Flags added when invoking the linker (C, C++, or Fortran)

       • <b>LIBS</b>: Libraries added when invoking the linker (C, C++, or Fortran)

       • <b>CC</b>: C compiler

       • <b>CFLAGS</b>: C compiler flags

       • <b>CXX</b>: C++ compiler

       • <b>CXXFLAGS</b>: C++ compiler flags

       • <b>FC</b>: Fortran compiler

       • <b>FCFLAGS</b>: Fortran compiler flags
