</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       oshcxx -- Open SHMEM C++ wrapper compiler

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       oshcxx [-showme|-showme:compile|-showme:link] ...

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --showme
              This  option  comes  in  several different variants (see below).  None of the variants invokes the
              underlying compiler; they all provide information on how the underlying compiler would  have  been
              invoked had <u>--showme</u> not been used.  The basic <u>--showme</u> option outputs the command line that would
              be  executed  to  compile  the program.  <b>NOTE:</b> If a non-filename argument is passed on the command
              line, the <u>-showme</u> option will <u>not</u>  display  any  additional  flags.   For  example,  both  "oshcxx
              --showme" and "oshcxx --showme my_source.c" will show all the wrapper-supplied flags.  But "oshcxx
              --showme -v" will only show the underlying compiler name and "-v".

       --showme:compile
              Output the compiler flags that would have been supplied to the C++ compiler.

       --showme:link
              Output the linker flags that would have been supplied to the C++ compiler.

       --showme:command
              Outputs the underlying C++ compiler command (which may be one or more tokens).

       --showme:incdirs
              Outputs  a  space-delimited  (but  otherwise  undecorated)  list  of  directories that the wrapper
              compiler would have provided to the underlying C++ compiler  to  indicate  where  relevant  header
              files are located.

       --showme:libdirs
              Outputs  a  space-delimited  (but  otherwise  undecorated)  list  of  directories that the wrapper
              compiler would have provided to the underlying linker to indicate  where  relevant  libraries  are
              located.

       --showme:libs
              Outputs  a  space-delimited  (but  otherwise  undecorated)  list of library names that the wrapper
              compiler would have used to link an application.  For example: "mpi open-rte open-pal util".

       --showme:version
              Outputs the version number of Open MPI.

       --showme:help
              Output a brief usage help message.

       See the man page for your underlying C++ compiler for other options that can be passed through oshcxx.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Conceptually, the role of these commands is quite simple: transparently add relevant compiler and  linker
       flags  to  the  user's  command  line  that are necessary to compile / link Open SHMEM programs, and then
       invoke the underlying compiler to actually perform the command.

       As such, these commands are frequently referred to as "wrapper" compilers because they  do  not  actually
       compile  or  link  applications  themselves;  they only add in command line flags and invoke the back-end
       compiler.

   <b>Background</b>
       Open MPI is comprised of three software layers: OPAL (Open Portable Access Layer),  ORTE  (Open  Run-Time
       Environment), and OMPI (Open MPI).  There are wrapper compilers for each layer; each layer's wrapper only
       links  in the libraries relevant for that layer.  Specifically, each layer provides the following wrapper
       compilers:

       OPAL
           <u>opalcc</u> and <u>opalc++</u>

       ORTE
           <u>ortecc</u> and <u>ortec++</u>

       OMPI
           <u>mpicc</u>, <u>mpic++</u>, <u>mpicxx</u>, <u>mpiCC</u> (only on systems with case-senstive file systems), and <u>mpifort</u> (and  its
           legacy/deprecated  names <u>mpif77</u> and <u>mpif90</u>).  Note that <u>mpic++</u>, <u>mpicxx</u>, and <u>mpiCC</u> all invoke the same
           underlying C++ compiler with the same options.  All are provided  as  compatibility  with  other  MPI
           implementations.

   <b>Fortran</b> <b>Notes</b>
       The  Fortran  wrapper  compiler  for MPI (<u>mpifort</u>, and its legacy/deprecated names <u>mpif77</u> and <u>mpif90</u>) can
       compile and link MPI applications that use any/all of the MPI Fortran bindings: <u>mpif.h</u>, the  <u>mpi</u>  module,
       and the <u>mpi_f08</u> module (assuming Open MPI was installed with support for each of these Fortran bindings).
       Specifically:  it  is  no  longer  necessary to use different wrapper compilers for applications that use
       <u>mpif.h</u> vs. applications that use the <u>mpi</u> module -- just use <u>mpifort</u> for all Fortran MPI applications.

       Note, however, that the Fortran compiler  may  require  additional  command-line  options  to  enforce  a
       specific  Fortran  dialect.   For  example,  in  some  versions  of the IBM XLF compiler, if xlf90 is the
       underlying Fortran compiler, <u>-qfixed</u> may be necessary to compile fixed-format Fortran source files.

       Finally, note that <u>mpifort</u> will be inoperative and will return an error on use if Fortran support was not
       built into the MP Ilayer.

   <b>Overview</b>
       <u>oshcxx</u> is a convenience wrappers for the underlying C++ compiler.  Translation of an Open  SHMEM  program
       requires  the  linkage  of  the Open SHMEM-specific libraries which may not reside in one of the standard
       search directories of <a href="../man1/ld.1.html">ld</a>(1).  It also often requires the inclusion of header files what may also  not  be
       found in a standard location.

       <u>oshcxx</u>  passes its arguments to the underlying C++ compiler along with the -I, -L and -l options required
       by Open SHMEM programs.

       The Open SHMEM Team <u>strongly</u> encourages using the wrapper compilers instead of attempting to link to  the
       Open  SHMEM  libraries manually.  This allows the specific implementation of Open SHMEM to change without
       forcing changes to linker directives in  users'  Makefiles.   Indeed,  the  specific  set  of  flags  and
       libraries  used  by  the wrapper compilers depends on how Open SHMEM was configured and built; the values
       can change between different installations of the same version of Open SHMEM.

       Indeed, since the wrappers are simply thin shells on top of an underlying compiler, there are very,  very
       few  compelling  reasons  <u>not</u>  to  use <u>oshcxx</u>.  When it is not possible to use the wrappers directly, the
       <u>-showme:compile</u> and <u>-showme:link</u> options should be used to determine what flags the wrappers  would  have
       used.  For example:

       shell$ cc -c file1.c `mpicc -showme:compile`

       shell$ cc -c file2.c `mpicc -showme:compile`

       shell$ cc file1.o file2.o `mpicc -showme:link` -o my_mpi_program

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       It  is  possible  to  make  the  wrapper  compilers multi-lib aware.  That is, the libraries and includes
       specified may differ based on the compiler flags specified (for example, with the GNU compilers on Linux,
       a different library path may be used if -m32 is seen versus -m64 being seen).  This is  not  the  default
       behavior  in  a  standard build, but can be activated (for example, in a binary package providing both 32
       and 64 bit support).  More information can be found at:

         https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/wiki/compilerwrapper3264

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The string that the wrapper compilers insert  into  the  command  line  before  invoking  the  underlying
       compiler  are  stored  in  a  text  file  created by Open SHMEM and installed to <u>$pkgdata/oshcxx-wrapper-</u>
       <u>data.txt</u>, where <u>$pkgdata</u>  is  typically  <u>$prefix/share/openmpi</u>,  and  <u>$prefix</u>  is  the  top  installation
       directory of Open SHMEM.

       It  is  rarely  necessary  to  edit this file, but it can be examined to gain insight into what flags the
       wrappers are placing on the command line.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       By default, the wrappers use the compilers that were selected when  Open  SHMEM  was  configured.   These
       compilers  were either found automatically by Open MPI's "configure" script, or were selected by the user
       in the CC, CXX, F77, and/or FC environment variables before "configure" was invoked.  Additionally, other
       arguments specific to the compiler may have been selected by configure.

       These values can be selectively overridden by either editing the text files containing this configuration
       information (see  the  <b>FILES</b>  section),  or  by  setting  selected  environment  variables  of  the  form
       "OSHMEM_value".

       Valid value names are:

       CPPFLAGS
              Flags added when invoking the preprocessor (C or C++)

       LDFLAGS
              Flags added when invoking the linker (C, C++, or Fortran)

       LIBS   Libraries added when invoking the linker (C, C++, or Fortran)

       CC     C compiler

       CFLAGS C compiler flags

       CXX    C++ compiler

       CXXFLAGS
              C++ compiler flags

       FC     Fortran compiler

       FCFLAGS
              Fortran compiler flags
