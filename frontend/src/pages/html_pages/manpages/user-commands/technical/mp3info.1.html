</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mp3info</b>  is  a  utility  used  to  read and modify the ID3 tags in MPEG layer 3 (MP3) files.  It can also
       (optionally) display various technical attributes of the MP3 file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -a <u>artist</u>
              Specify ID3 artist name

       -c <u>comment</u>
              Specify ID3 comment

       -g <u>genre</u>
              Specify ID3 genre (use <b>-G</b> option for a list of valid genres).  You may specify either a genre name
              or a number.

       -l <u>album</u>
              Specify ID3 album name

       -n <u>track</u>
              Specify ID3 v1.1 track number

       -t <u>title</u>
              Specify ID3 track title

       -y <u>year</u>
              Specify ID3 copyright year

       -G     Display a list of valid genres and their associated numeric  codes.  These  are  the  only  values
              accepted by the <b>-g</b> switch.

       -h     Display a help page

       -x     Display technical attributes of the MP3 file

       -r a|<b>m</b>|<b>v</b>
              Report  bit  rate  of Variable Bit Rate (VBR) files as one of the following (See the section below
              entitled <b>Bit</b> <b>Rates</b> for more information):

              <b>a</b> - Average bit rate [float](Note: this option also causes the bit rates of non-VBR  files  to  be
                     displayed as floating point values).

              <b>m</b> - Median bit rate [integer]

              <b>v</b> - Simply use the word 'Variable' [string] (this is the default).

       -i     Edit ID3 tag interactively (uses curses/ncurses functions)

       -d     Delete ID3 tag (if one exists)

       -f     Force Mode: Treat all files as MP3s even if MP3 frames can't be found

       -F     Do  a  Full  scan  for  technical information (see the section <b>Speed</b> <b>Considerations</b> below for more
              information)

       <b>-p</b> <b>"</b><u>FORMAT_STRING</u><b>"</b>

              Print MP3 attributes according to <u>FORMAT_STRING</u>.  <u>FORMAT_STRING</u> is similar to a  <b><a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)</b>  format
              string  in  that it is printed verbatim except for the following conversions and escape sequences.
              Any conversion specifier may optionally include the various alignment, precision, and field  width
              modifiers  accepted  by  <b><a href="../man3/printf.3.html">printf</a>(3)</b>.   See  the  <b>EXAMPLES</b>  section below for examples of how format
              strings are used in mp3info.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Specifying MP3 files without any other options displays the existing ID3 tag (if any).

       Specifying a track number of 0 reverts an ID3 tag to 1.0 format

       Non-specified ID3 fields, if existent, will remain unchanged.

       Genres can be specified as numbers or names: <b>-g</b> <b>17</b> same as <b>-g</b> <b>Rock</b>

       Multiple word fields must be enclosed in quotes (eg: <b>-t</b> <b>"A</b> <b>title"</b>)

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Speed</b> <b>Considerations</b>
              In order to determine certain technical attributes (playing time, number of frames, number of  bad
              frames,  and  in  a few cases the bit rate) with absolute certainty, it would be necessary to read
              the entire MP3 file.  Mp3info normally tries to speed things up by reading  a  handful  of  frames
              from  various  points  in the file and estimating the statistics for the rest of the file based on
              those samples.  Usually, this results in very accurate estimates.  Audio playing times are usually
              off by no more than a second, and the number of frames is  off  by  less  than  0.1%.   Often  the
              estimates  agree  exactly with the full scans.  Nevertheless, the user may wish to ensure that she
              is getting exact information.

              One should specify the <b>-F</b> switch if one wants mp3info to read the entire MP3 file when determining
              this information.  Note that a full scan will only affect mp3info's output if  the  <b>-x</b>  switch  is
              used  or  the  <b>-p</b> switch is used with a FORMAT_SPECIFIER containing <b>%m</b>, <b>%s</b>, <b>%S</b>, <b>%u</b> or (rarely) <b>%r</b>.
              Using the <b>-F</b> switch under other conditions  will  only  slow  down  mp3info.   Also  note  that  a
              FORMAT_SPECIFIER  containing  <b>%b</b>  or a VBR MP3 file will automatically trigger a full scan even if
              the <b>-F</b> switch is not used.

              Several users have noted that the <b>%u</b> specifier used alone:

              <b>mp3info</b> <b>-p</b> <b>"%u"</b> <b>song.mp3</b>

              sometimes gives a different number of good frames than when used with the <b>%b</b> specifier:

              <b>mp3info</b> <b>-p</b> <b>"%u</b> <b>%b"</b> <b>song.mp3</b>

              This is because when you use <b>%u</b> by itself, mp3info only estimates the number of  frames  based  on
              the  bitrate  and  the size of the file.  When you use the <b>%b</b> specifier, you force mp3info to do a
              full scan of the file which guarantees an accurate count of both the good and bad frames.  If  you
              want  to  guarantee  an  accurate  count of the number of good frames when using <b>%u</b> by itself, you
              should use the <b>-F</b> option.

       <b>Bit</b> <b>Rates</b>
              MP3 files are made up of many (usually several thousand) audio blocks called  'frames'.   Each  of
              these  frames  is  encoded at a specific 'bit rate' which determines both the quality of the sound
              and the size of the frame itself.  Bit rates can range from 8 Kb/s (kilobits per  second)  to  320
              Kb/s.   Note that the MP3 specification only allows 14 discreet bit rates for an MP3 file, so, for
              instance, a stereo MP3 could have frames with bit rates of 128 Kb/s and 160 Kb/s, but  nowhere  in
              between.

              Audio  frames  with  high bit rates sound much better than those with lower bit rates, but take up
              more space.  Obviously, one would like to use a bit rate that is only high enough  to  maintain  a
              comfortable  level  of  audio quality.  Normally, all the frames in an MP3 file are encoded at the
              same bit rate.  A few MP3 files, however, are encoded such that the bit rate  may  vary  from  one
              frame to the next.  These MP3 files are called Variable Bit Rate (or VBR) files.   Since VBR files
              do  not  have one single bit rate, attempting to report the bit rate of the file as a whole can be
              problematic.  Consequently, mp3info allows you to specify how you want this value reported.

              The default is to simply print the word 'Variable' where  the  bit  rate  would  normally  appear.
              Another  option is to print the mathematical average of all the frames.  This has the advantage of
              being completely accurate, but the number printed may not correspond to one of the 14 discreet bit
              rates that would be allowed for that file.  The third alternative solves that problem by  allowing
              the bit rate to be reported as the median bit rate which is what you would get if you lined up all
              the  frames  in  the  file  by bit rate from lowest to highest and picked the frame closest to the
              middle of the line.

              For more specific usage information, see the <b>-r</b> switch and the <b>%r</b> conversion specifier  under  the
              description of <b>-p</b>'s FORMAT_SPECIFIER.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Display existing ID3 tag information (if any) in song.mp3

              <b>mp3info</b> <b>song.mp3</b>

       Set the title, author and genre of song.mp3. (All other fields unchanged)

              <b>mp3info</b> <b>-t</b> <b>"Song</b> <b>Title"</b> <b>-a</b> <b>Author</b> <b>-g</b> <b>"Rock</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>Roll"</b> <b>song.mp3</b>

       Set the album field of all MP3 files in the current directory to "The White Album"

              <b>mp3info</b> <b>-l</b> <b>"The</b> <b>White</b> <b>Album"</b> <b>*.mp3</b>

       Delete the entire ID3 tag from song1.mp3 and song2.mp3

              <b>mp3info</b> <b>-d</b> <b>song1.mp3</b> <b>song2.mp3</b>

       Delete  the  comment field from the ID3 tags of all MP3 files in the current directory. (All other fields
       unchanged)

              <b>mp3info</b> <b>-c</b> <b>""</b> <b>*.mp3</b>

       Display the Title, Artist, Album, and Year of all MP3 files in the current  directory.   We  include  the
       labels 'File', etc. and insert newlines (<b>\n</b>) to make things more readable for humans:

              <b>mp3info</b> <b>-p</b> <b>"File:</b> <b>%f\nTitle:</b> <b>%t\nArtist:</b> <b>%a\nAlbum:</b> <b>%l\nYear:</b> <b>%y\n\n"</b> <b>*.mp3</b>

       Say  you  want  to  build  a  spreadsheet  of your MP3 files.  Here's a command you might use to help you
       accomplish that.  Most spreadsheet programs will import an ASCII file and treat a given  character  as  a
       field separator.  A commonly used field separator is the tab character.  For each MP3 file in the current
       directory,  we want to output the filename, title, artist, and album on a single line and have the fields
       separated by a tab (<b>\t</b>) character.  Note that you must include a newline (<b>\n</b>) at the end  of  the  format
       string in order to get each file's information on a separate line.  Here's the command:

              <b>mp3info</b> <b>-p</b> <b>"%f\t%t\t%a\t%l\t%y\n"</b> <b>*.mp3</b>

       Some  spreadsheets  or  other  software  may  allow  importing data from flat files where each field is a
       specific width.  Here's where the format modifiers come into play.  This next command  outputs  the  same
       information  as  the  command above, but uses fixed-width fields instead of tab separators.  The filename
       field is defined as 50 characters wide, the title field is defined as 31 characters wide, and so on.

              <b>mp3info</b> <b>-p</b> <b>"%50f%31t%31a%31l%4y\n"</b> <b>*.mp3</b>

       The problem with the output of this command is that all strings  are  normally  right-  justified  within
       their fields.  This looks a little odd since most western languages read from left to right.  In order to
       make the fields left-justified, add a minus sign (<b>-</b>) in front of the field-width:

              <b>mp3info</b> <b>-p</b> <b>"%-50f%-31t%-31a%-31l%-4y\n"</b> <b>*.mp3</b>

       Now  suppose  you  just  want the running time of each MP3 file specified in minutes and seconds.  Simple
       enough:

              <b>mp3info</b> <b>-p</b> <b>"%f:</b> <b>%m:%s\n"</b> <b>*.mp3</b>

       You may notice when you do this, however, that leading zeros are not displayed in the seconds field (<b>%s</b>).
       So for instance, if you had a track four minutes and two seconds long its running time would be displayed
       as '4:2' instead of '4:02'.  In order to tell mp3info to pad an integer field with zeros, you need to use
       a field width modifier and place a zero in front of it.   The  following  command  is  the  same  as  the
       previous  one,  but it specifies that mp3info is to display the seconds field with a fixed field-width of
       two characters and to pad the field with leading zeros if necessary:

              <b>mp3info</b> <b>-p</b> <b>"%f:</b> <b>%m:%02s\n"</b> <b>*.mp3</b>

       The last trick we have to show you  is  the  precision  specifier  for  floating  point  variables.   The
       following command displays the filename and average bit rate for all MP3 files in the current directory.

              <b>mp3info</b> <b>-r</b> <b>a</b> <b>-p</b> <b>"%f</b> <b>%r\n"</b> <b>*.mp3</b>

       By  default,  the  floating  point  value  of  the average bit rate is displayed with six digits past the
       decimal point (ex: 175.654332).  If you are like me, this seems like a bit of overkill.  At most you want
       one or two digits beyond the decimal place displayed.  Or you might not want any.  The following  command
       displays the average bit rate with first two, then zero digits beyond the decimal point:

              <b>mp3info</b> <b>-r</b> <b>a</b> <b>-p</b> <b>"%f</b> <b>%.2r</b> <b>%.0r\n"</b> <b>*.mp3</b>

       If  you  wanted  to  specify  a  field width for a floating point value, you could do that by placing the
       field-width before the decimal point in the field modifier.  This command does just that -- specifying an
       average bit-rate field six characters wide that will show two digits  of  precision  beyond  the  decimal
       point:

              <b>mp3info</b> <b>-r</b> <b>a</b> <b>-p</b> <b>"%f</b> <b>%6.2r\n"</b> <b>*.mp3</b>

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There's  no  "save  and  quit"  in  interactive mode. You must fill in all the fields (even if it is with
       blanks) and let the program finish by itself.  CTRL+C does leave MP3info, but the data isn't saved.

       Using space to erase tags in interactive mode does not work correctly if  you  then  backspace  over  the
       deleted text.

       The  title,  author, album, and comment fields are limited to 30 characters.  This is a limitation of the
       ID3 1.0 tag format, not MP3Info.  If you specify the track number (with the <b>-n</b> switch), the ID3  1.0  tag
       becomes  a  1.1  tag  and  the comment field is limited to 28 characters.  This is because the difference
       between ID3 1.0 and 1.1 is that the tag number is stored in the last byte of  the  comment  field.   This
       trick "borrows" two bytes from the fixed-length comment field effectively reducing the maximum comment by
       two characters.

       Genres  cannot  be specified arbitrarily.  They must be specified from a pre-determined list (use <b>mp3info</b>
       <b>-G</b> to see that list).  Again, this is a limitation of the ID3 1.0 tag format.

       Only ID3 versions 1.0 and 1.1 are supported.  ID3V2 is a much more powerful standard and is  planned  for
       some  as-yet-undetermined  future  version.   Unfortunately, a clean implementation is a heck of a lot of
       work and I'm unbelievably lazy, so don't hold your breath.  It is probably worth noting at this juncture,
       however, that I do accept patches.  :-)

       Exit codes are somewhat haphazard and not well documented.
