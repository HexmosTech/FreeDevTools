       mSubCube - Create a subimage of a cube

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       mSubCube  [-d]  [-D3  <u>index-selection-string</u>]  [-D4 <u>index-selection-string</u>] [-a] [-h <u>hdu</u>] [-s <u>statusfile</u>]
       in.fits out.fits ra dec xsize [ysize]

       mSubCube -p [-d] [-D3 <u>index-selection-string</u>]  [-D4  <u>index-selection-string</u>]  [-h  <u>hdu</u>]  [-s  <u>statusfile</u>]
       in.fits out.fits xstartpix ystartpix xpixsize [ypixsize]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Creates  a  subimage  (or  "cutout")  of  a  FITS  file.   Note that in "normal" mode, all the parameters
       (location and size) are in degrees; in pixel (-p) mode, all of them are in pixels.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -d     Turns on debugging.

       -D3    This argument is a string (quoted if it contain spaces) defining the subset  of  indices  desired.
              The string has the form of an ordered set of comma-separated values, which each value is either an
              index  or  a  range  of  indices.  For instance, "2, 4:46, 58, 101:120" would copy dimension three
              planes 2, 4 through 46, 58 and 101 through 120 to the output cube.  Note that these numbers  refer
              to  indices in a FITS cube, so are one-offset, not zero. Attempts to go outside the available data
              result in an error.

       -D4    The same sort of thing as -D3, but for the fourth dimension.

       -a     All pixels - Force retrieval of whole image (useful to extract an entire HDU)

       -h <u>hdu</u> Operate on the specified FITS header extension (HDU)

       -s <u>statusfile</u>
              Output and errors are sent to <u>statusfile</u> instead of to stdout

       -p     Pixel mode - create subimage using pixel locations, instead of a location on the sky

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       in.fits
              Input FITS file.

       out.fits
              Path to output FITS file.

       ra     In normal mode, RA of center of output image.

       dec    In normal mode, declination of center of output image.

       xstartpix
              In pixel mode, pixel along the x-axis where the cutout image will begin

       ystartpix
              In pixel mode, pixel along the y-axis where the cutout image will begin

       xsize  In normal mode, width of output image in degrees.

       ysize  In normal mode, height of output image in degrees (default is equal to <u>xsize</u>.

       xpixsize
              In pixel mode, width of output image in pixels

       ypixsize
              In pixel mode, height of output image in pixels (default is equal to <u>xpixsize</u>

</pre><h4><b>RESULT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>[struct</b> <b>stat="OK",</b> <b>content="</b><u>blank,</u> <u>flat</u> <u>or</u> <u>normal</u><b>"]</b>

       The content keyword indicates whether all pixels where NaN  (blank),  all  pixels  were  the  same  value
       (flat), or the image appears to be normal.

</pre><h4><b>MESSAGES</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       $ mSubCube image1.fits subimage.fits 307.9 37.29 .01 .01
              [struct stat="OK", content="normal"]

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The drizzle algorithm has been implemented but has not been tested in this release.

       If a header template contains carriage returns (i.e., created/modified on a Windows machine), the cfitsio
       library  will  be  unable  to read it properly, resulting in the error: [struct stat="ERROR", status=207,
       msg="illegal character in keyword"]

       It is best for the background correction  algorithms  if  the  area  described  in  the  header  template
       completely encloses all of the input images in their entirety. If parts of input images are "chopped off"
       by  the  header  template,  the  background correction will be affected. We recommend you use an expanded
       header for the reprojection and background modeling steps, returning to  the  originally  desired  header
       size  for  the  final  coaddition.  The  default background matching assumes that there are no non-linear
       background variations in the individual images (and therefore in the overlap differences).  If  there  is
       any  uncertainty  in  this  regard, it is safer to turn on the "level only" background matching (the "-l"
       flag in mBgModel.
