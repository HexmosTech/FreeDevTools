</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xclip - command line interface to X selections (clipboard)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xclip</b> [OPTION] [FILE]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Reads  from  standard  in,  or from one or more files, and makes the data available as an X selection for
       pasting into X applications. Prints current X selection to standard out.

       <b>-i</b>, <b>-in</b>
              read text into X selection from standard input or files (default)

       <b>-o</b>, <b>-out</b>
              print the selection to standard out (generally for piping to a file or program)

       <b>-f</b>, <b>-filter</b>
              when xclip is invoked in the in mode with output level set to silent (the  defaults),  the  filter
              option will cause xclip to print the text piped to standard in back to standard out unmodified

       <b>-r</b>, <b>-rmlastnl</b>
              when  the  last  character  of the selection is a newline character, remove it. Newline characters
              that are not the last character in the selection are not affected. If the selection does  not  end
              with  a  newline  character, this option has no effect. This option is useful for copying one-line
              output of programs like <b>pwd</b> to the clipboard to paste it again into  the  command  prompt  without
              executing the line immediately due to the newline character <b>pwd</b> appends.

       <b>-l</b>, <b>-loops</b>
              number  of  X  selection  requests (pastes into X applications) to wait for before exiting, with a
              value of 0 (default) causing xclip to wait for an  unlimited  number  of  requests  until  another
              application (possibly another invocation of xclip) takes ownership of the selection

       <b>-t</b>, <b>-target</b>
              specify  a  particular  data  format using the given target atom.  With <b>-o</b> the special target atom
              name "TARGETS" can be used to get a list of valid target  atoms  for  this  selection.   For  more
              information about target atoms refer to ICCCM section 2.6.2

       <b>-d</b>, <b>-display</b>
              X  display  to use (e.g. "localhost:0"), xclip defaults to the value in $<b>DISPLAY</b> if this option is
              omitted

       <b>-h</b>, <b>-help</b>
              show quick summary of options

       <b>-selection</b>
              specify which X selection to use, options are "primary" to use XA_PRIMARY  (default),  "secondary"
              for XA_SECONDARY or "clipboard" for XA_CLIPBOARD

       <b>-version</b>
              show version information

       <b>-silent</b>
              fork into the background to wait for requests, no informational output, errors only (default)

       <b>-quiet</b> show informational messages on the terminal and run in the foreground

       <b>-verbose</b>
              provide a running commentary of what xclip is doing

       <b>-noutf8</b>
              operate  in  legacy  (i.e.  non UTF-8) mode for backwards compatibility (Use this option only when
              really necessary, as the old behavior was broken)

       xclip reads text from standard in or files and makes it available to other X applications for pasting  as
       an  X  selection (traditionally with the middle mouse button). It reads from all files specified, or from
       standard in if no files are specified. xclip can also print the contents of a selection to  standard  out
       with the <b>-o</b> option.

       xclip  was designed to allow tighter integration of X applications and command line programs. The default
       action is to silently wait  in  the  background  for  X  selection  requests  (pastes)  until  another  X
       application  places  data in the clipboard, at which point xclip exits silently. You can use the <b>-verbose</b>
       option to see if and when xclip actually receives selection requests from other X applications.

       Options can be abbreviated as long as they remain unambiguous. For example, it is possible to use  <b>-d</b>  or
       <b>-disp</b>  instead  of  <b>-display</b>. However, <b>-v</b> couldn't be used because it is ambiguous (it could be short for
       <b>-verbose</b> or <b>-version</b>), so it would be interpreted as a filename.

       Note that only the first character of the selection specified with the <b>-selection</b>  option  is  important.
       This  means  that  "p",  "sec"  and  "clip" would have the same effect as using "primary", "secondary" or
       "clipboard" respectively.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       I hate man pages without examples!

       <b>uptime</b> <b>|</b> <b>xclip</b>

       Put your uptime in the X selection. Then middle click in an X application to paste.

       <b>xclip</b> <b>-loops</b> <b>10</b> <b>-verbose</b> <b>/etc/motd</b>

       Exit after /etc/motd (message of the day) has been pasted 10 times.  Show  how  many  selection  requests
       (pastes) have been processed.

       <b>xclip</b> <b>-o</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>helloworld.c</b>

       Put the contents of the selection into a file.

       <b>xclip</b> <b>-t</b> <b>text/html</b> <b>index.html</b>

       Middle click in an X application supporting HTML to paste the contents of the given file as HTML.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DISPLAY</b>
              X display to use if none is specified with the <b>-display</b> option.
