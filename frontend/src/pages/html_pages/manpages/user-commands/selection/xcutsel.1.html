       xcutsel - interchange between cut buffer and selection

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>xcutsel</b> [ <u>-toolkitoption</u> ...] [-selection <u>selection</u>] [-cutbuffer <u>number</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>xcutsel</u> program is used to copy the current selection into a cut buffer and to make a selection that
       contains the current contents of the cut buffer.  It acts as a bridge  between  applications  that  don't
       support selections and those that do.

       By  default, <u>xcutsel</u> will use the selection named PRIMARY and the cut buffer CUT_BUFFER0.  Either or both
       of these can be overridden by command line arguments or by resources.

       An <u>xcutsel</u> window has the following buttons:

           <u>quit</u>
               When this button is pressed, <u>xcutsel</u> exits.  Any selections held  by  <u>xcutsel</u>  are  automatically
               released.

           <u>copy</u> <u>PRIMARY</u> <u>to</u> <u>0</u>
               When this button is pressed, <u>xcutsel</u> copies the current selection into the cut buffer.

           <u>copy</u> <u>0</u> <u>to</u> <u>PRIMARY</u>
               When  this  button  is  pressed, <u>xcutsel</u> converts the current contents of the cut buffer into the
               selection.

       The button labels reflect the selection and cutbuffer selected by command line  options  or  through  the
       resource database.

       When  the  ``copy  0 to PRIMARY'' button is activated, the button will remain inverted as long as <u>xcutsel</u>
       remains the owner of the selection.  This serves to remind you which client owns the  current  selection.
       Note  that  the  value  of  the  selection  remains constant; if the cutbuffer is changed, you must again
       activate the copy button to retrieve the new value when desired.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Xcutsel</u> accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options as well as the following:

       <b>-selection</b> <u>name</u>
               This option specifies the name of the selection to  use.   The  default  is  PRIMARY.   The  only
               supported  abbreviations  for  this  option are ``-select'', ``-sel'' and ``-s'', as the standard
               toolkit option ``-selectionTimeout'' has a similar name.

       <b>-cutbuffer</b> <u>number</u>
               This option specifies the cut buffer to use.  The default is cut buffer 0.

</pre><h4><b>X</b> <b>DEFAULTS</b></h4><pre>
       This program accepts all of the standard X Toolkit resource names and classes as well as:

       <b>selection</b> <b>(</b>class <b>Selection)</b>
               This resource specifies the name of the selection to use.  The default is PRIMARY.

       <b>cutBuffer</b> <b>(</b>class <b>CutBuffer)</b>
               This resource specifies the number of the cut buffer to use.  The default is 0.

</pre><h4><b>WIDGET</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       The following instance names may be used when user configuration of the labels in them is desired:

       <b>sel-cut</b> <b>(</b>class <b>Command)</b>
               This is the ``copy SELECTION to BUFFER'' button.

       <b>cut-sel</b> <b>(</b>class <b>Command)</b>
               This is the ``copy BUFFER to SELECTION'' button.

       <b>quit</b> <b>(</b>class <b>Command)</b>
               This is the ``quit'' button.

       a selection.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There is no way to change the name of the selection or the number of the cut buffer while the program  is
       running.
