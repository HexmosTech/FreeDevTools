</pre><h4><b>Fenrir</b> <b>User</b> <b>Manual</b></h4><pre>
       Fenrir is a modern command line screen reader written in Python3.

       It  has  a modular structure, a flexible based driver model, is highly configurable and easy to customize
       and extend (see Developer Manual (fenrir_development_manual)).

       Please see the following pages for the current (fenrir_current_version) and Git (fenrir_git_version) ver‐
       sion of Fenrir.

</pre><h4><b>Support</b> <b>and</b> <b>Requirements</b></h4><pre>
       Fenrir requires several drivers to interact with the operating system.

   <b>Speech</b> <b>Drivers</b>
       A speech driver is for communication with the text to speech system like  Speech-Dispatcher  (#SpeechDis‐
       patcher)  or Espeak (<a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net">http://espeak.sourceforge.net</a>).  \ See section Speech (#Speech) in ''settings.conf''
       for more information.

   <b>SpeechDispatcher</b>
       This driver is used by default.  It uses Speech-dispatcher as its backend.

       Dependencies:

       • Speech-dispatcher (installed and configured, Documentation (https///devel.freebsoft.org/speechd#sec2))

       • Python-speechd

   <b>Espeak</b>
       Uses Espeak via Python bindings.

       Dependencies:

       • Espeak or Espeak-ng

       • python-espeak (https///launchpad.net/python-espeak)

   <b>Generic</b>
       This invokes speech via a sub-process.  This is almost the same as using the  commandline.   The  perfor‐
       mance depends on the overhead of the speech synthesis application but it is really flexible.

       Dependencies:

       • Espeak or Espeak-ng

       The Requirements are flexible, they depend on the configuration in settings.conf.

   <b>Dummy</b>
       this is just for debugging, logs are output to the screen and logged as well.

   <b>Sound</b> <b>Drivers</b>
       To play sound icons and similar.\ See section Sound (#Sound) in ''settings.conf'' for more information.

   <b>Generic</b>
       This driver is used by default.

       Dependencies:

       • Sox  (<a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/">http://sox.sourceforge.net/</a>)  with opus support The Requirements are flexible, they depend on the
         configuration in settings.conf.

   <b>Gstreamer</b>
       if you prefer to use Gstreamer for sound output.

       Dependencies:

       • Gstreamer &gt;= 1.x

       • Glibc

   <b>Dummy</b>
       this is just for debugging, logs are output to the screen and logged as well.

   <b>Input</b> <b>Drivers</b>
       Input drivers are to capture keyboard shortcuts issued to the screen reader
       See section Keyboard (#Keyboard) in ''settings.conf'' for more information.

   <b>Evdev</b>
       This driver is used by default.

       Evdev is the low level input device framework for Linux.

       Dependencies:

       • python-evdev &gt;=0.6.3

       • pyudev

       • loaded uinput kernel module

       • exclusive access to the input devices Read permission to the following files and services:

       • <a href="file:/dev/input">/dev/input</a>

       • /dev/uinput

   <b>Screen</b> <b>Drivers</b>
       The job of a screen driver is to get the information of  current  screen  content.\  See  section  Screen
       (#Screen) in ''settings.conf'' for more information.

   <b>VCSA</b>
       This  driver  is used by default.  For Linux VCSA devices.  These exist on any current standard installa‐
       tion of Linux.

       Dependencie s:

       • python-dbus Read permission to the following files and services (or run as root):

       • <a href="file:/sys/devices/virtual/tty/tty0/active">/sys/devices/virtual/tty/tty0/active</a>

       • /dev/tty[1 - 64]

       • /dev/vcsa[1 - 64] (VCSA manpage (https///linux.die.net/man/4/vcsa))

       • read Logind DBUS

   <b>Braille</b> <b>Drivers</b>
       This is for Braille support.  Braille is currently a work in progress and is planned for the  Fenrir  2.0
       release.\ See section Braille (#Braille) in ''settings.conf'' for more information.

   <b>BRLTTY</b>
       This driver is used by default.  It uses BrlTTY (brltty) to communicate with with a Braille device.

       Dependencies:

       • BrlTTY  (configured and running, Documentation (<a href="http://mielke.cc/brltty/doc/Manual-BRLTTY/English/BRLT">http://mielke.cc/brltty/doc/Manual-BRLTTY/English/BRLT</a>‐
         TY.html))

       • python-brlapi   (configured,    Documentation    (<a href="http://mielke.cc/brltty/doc/Manual-BrlAPI/English/Br">http://mielke.cc/brltty/doc/Manual-BrlAPI/English/Br</a>‐
         lAPI.html)) ## Currently supported platforms

       Currently Fenrir completely supports the following Platforms:

       • Linux TTY Support for further Systems are planned.

</pre><h4><b>Installation</b></h4><pre>
       Fenrir can run without installation.  It just requires the dependencies are installed first.

       We  recommend to try it out before installation to be sure everything works and prevent yourself from ex‐
       periencing a non-talking environment.

   <b>Try</b> <b>Out</b>
       Fenrir does not require installation.  You can try it and make sure everything works before you decide to
       install.  In this way you can be sure that your system doesnt break or stop talking.  for  that  you  can
       just  grab the code and run as root ''src/fenrir/fenrir'' (in foreground) or ''src/fenrir/fenrir-daemon''
       (in background, used by systemd for autostart)

   <b>Install</b> <b>it</b>
   <b>Documented</b> <b>operating</b> <b>systems</b>
   <b>Arch</b> <b>Linux</b>
       For Arch there are PKGBUILDs in the AUR:

       • fenrir (https///aur.archlinux.org/packages/fenrir/)

       • fenrir-git (https///aur.archlinux.org/packages/fenrir-git/)

   <b>Manual</b>
       1. Download the latest stable version from the Fenrir-Project (https///linux-a11y.org/index.php?page=fen‐
          rir-screenreader) site.

       2. Unpack the archive

       3. Check  the  needed  Dependencys  by  running   check-dependencys.py   (https///github.com/chrys87/fen‐
          rir/blob/master/check-dependencies.py) script

       4. install the missing dependencies an standard installation requires the following:

           • python3 &gt;= 3.3 (and all the following is needed for python3 )

           • python3-speechd (screen)

           • python3-dbus (screen)

           • python3-evdev &gt;= 0.6.4(input)

           • python3-daemonize (background service)

           • python3-brlapi (braille)

           • python3-pyenchant (spellchecker)

           • your language for aspell (aspell-&lt;lang&gt;) (spellchecker)

           • sox (sound)

           • For  an individual installation see Support and Requirements (#Support and Requirements) or consult
             the Readme (https///github.com/chrys87/fenrir/blob/master/README.md))

       5. run "install.sh" as root

       this installs Fenrir as the following

              * Application:''/opt/fenrir''
              * Settings:''/etc/fenrir''
              * Sound Icons:''/usr/share/fenrirscreenreader/''

       to remove Fenrir just run uninstall.sh as root

   <b>Git</b>
       if you want to get the latest code you can use git to get a development snapshot:

              git clone https://github.com/chrys87/fenrir.git

   <b>Auto</b> <b>Start</b>
       To start Fenrir once: systemctl start fenrir

       To enable auto start on system boot: systemctl enable fenrir

       Using the review feature will open the review mode automatically.

       The review cursor always starts from the text cursor.  Attention: after using the review mode, the review
       cursor will stay open until you use the ''exit review'' shortcut.

       Think  when  using  clipboard operations and similar.  The review cursor is always prefered over the text
       cursor.

       Fenrir sounds a bell sound if the used review command jumps to another line or end of screen.  ####  exit

       marking

       A  mark  defines  a point of origin or end to prepare to copy or paste a block of text.  \ Examples where
       you need marks are:

       • copy to clipboard

       • set window application

       • set bookmark 1 - X #### Set mark

       How to set a mark: 1.  navigate with review or textcursor to the position you want to set the mark.   At‐
       tention:  if  a review cursor is set, that is the prefered.  If you want to use text cursor, be sure that
       you are not in review mode.  2.  press shortcut for ''set mark'' you can set two marks (begin  and  end).
       Some  commands  allow  some  simpler usecases just using the whole line if only one mark is set.  you may
       want to try this out.  #### Get text between marks

       To get the text that is currently between your marks press shortcut for  ''marked  text''.\  ####  Remove
       Marks

       You can remove all current marks by pressing the shortcut for ''remove marks''.  Changing the screen also
       removes the marks.  ### Screen Interaction

       Fenrir provides several methods to interact with the current screen.  #### forward keypress

       This  just  forwards  the next shortcut to the screen Fenrir shortcut or not.  This is useful if the cur‐
       rently pressed shortcut is also in use by Fenrir.  #### Clipboard

       Fenrir provides a clipboard with multible items represented by a list.  You navigate  throught  the  list
       and paste the selected clipboard.  ##### copy marked to clipboard

       To  copy  something to the clipboard you need to set one or two marks.  if you set one mark, the text be‐
       tween the mark and your current cursor is copied to clipboard.  Setting two marks just  copies  the  text
       between  the  marks  into  the clipboard.  If you copy something it is always placed as the first item on
       your clipboard.  ##### clear clipboard

       You can remove all items from the current clipboard by ''clear clipboard''  functionality.   #####  first
       clipboard

       This moves quick to the first item of the clipboard.  ##### last clipboard

       This moves quick to the last item of the clipboard.  ##### previous clipboard

       Go to previous item in the clipboard.  ##### next clipboard

       Go to next item on the clipboard.  ##### read current clipboard

       Read the content of the current item of the clipboard.  ##### paste clipboard

       Pass  whatever item is currently selected by first, last, prev or next clipboard commands.  if no special
       clipboard is selected the (last copied) is used.  ##### export clipboard to file

       you.  This is used by:

              * wifi-menu
              * dialog
              * alpine

   <b>Tutorial</b> <b>Mode</b>
       Fenrir provides a Tutorial mode.  When you enter tutorial mode, screen reader  commands  are  intercepted

       If you want to replace ":)" emoticons with "smile" in speech you can use this feature.  It can be toggled
       on or off.  You can define emoticons in a dictionary, please see Emoticon Dictionary.  See section Gener‐
       al (#General) in ''settings.conf'' to see how to enable or disable this feature.

   <b>Time</b>
       Announce the time at periodical increments, To track the time easily.  You can define 2 different ways of
       time announcements.  1.  periodic 2.  on fix minutes

       Example periodic, every 20 minutes "delaySec=20":

              [time]
              enabled=True
              presentTime=True
              presentDate=True
              delaySec=20
              onMinutes=
              announce=True
              interrupt=False

       Example on fix minutes in an hour.  example every quarter "delaySec=0" and "onMinutes=00,15,30,45":

              [time]
              enabled=True
              presentTime=True
              presentDate=True
              #delaySec is repected bevore onMinutes so it need to be set to 0
              delaySec=0
              onMinutes=00,15,30,45
              announce=True
              interrupt=False

   <b>Promoted</b> <b>List</b>
       Promoted Lists are a nice feature if you are away from your computer or  performing  more  longer  tasks.
       you can define a list of words which you want to hear a sound icon for after a period of inactivity.  Ex‐
       ample if the word "Chrys" appears after 120 Seconds of inactivity: [promote] enabled=True
       inactiveTimeoutSec=120  list=Chrys  See section Promote (#Promote) in ''settings.conf'' for more informa‐
       tion.  ### Punctuation

       Fenrir handles punctuation levels and names for you with several provided dictionaries.

       See levelDict See punctuationDict ## Braille

       Fenrir provides Braille support in Version &gt;= 2.0.  See section Braille (#Braille)  in  ''settings.conf''
       for more information.  ### braille flush

       If  a  message appears on the Braille device you can flush it to get back to the review- or system cursor
       ### Braille pan left

       If a line is longer than your Braille devices you can move the view (called panning) to the left.  So you
       can read stuff without the need to move the review- or system cursor.  ### Braille pan right

       If a line is longer than your Braille devices you can move the view (called panning) to  the  right.   So
       you can read stuff without the need to move the review- or system cursor.  ### braille return to cursor

       When you have finished reading the line on the Braille device using panning, the focus can be returned to
       the current used cursor by using "return to cursor" command.  ## Dictionary

       You  can  make use of different kinds of built-in dictionary's.  A dictionary has a name and list of keys
       and values separated by :===: Example: [customDict] Chrys:===:Chrys is cool lollipop:===:lolli that means
       that every instance "chrys" is displayed, speech will say Chrys is cool.  "lollipop" is spoken  as  "lol‐
       li".   Before  making  changes to a dictionary we recommend making a backup of your current dictionary in
       case future updates overwrite your local changes.  ### Punctuation

   <b>Level</b>
       The punctuation level dict contains lists with "what punctuation is spoken in what level".   the  default
       one  looks  like  this:  [levelDict]  none:===:  some:===:.-$~+*-/\@   most:===:.,:-$~+*-/@!#%^&amp;<u>()[]}{&lt;&gt;;</u>
       <u>all:===:!"#$%&amp;</u> <u>'()+,-./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\]^_`{|}~</u> <u>the</u> <u>level</u> <u>"none"</u> <u>has</u> <u>no</u> <u>values.</u>  <u>so</u>  <u>it</u>  <u>should</u>  <u>not</u>  <u>speak</u>  <u>any</u>
       <u>punctuation</u>  <u>(sadly</u> <u>this</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>respected</u> <u>by</u> <u>every</u> <u>TTS</u> <u>system)</u> <u>if</u> <u>"some"</u> <u>is</u> <u>the</u> <u>current</u> <u>level</u> <u>the</u> <u>follow‐</u>
       <u>ing</u> <u>are</u> <u>spoken:</u> <u>dot</u> <u>dash</u> <u>dollar</u> <u>tilde</u> <u>plus</u> <u>star</u> <u>slash</u> <u>backslash</u> <u>at.</u>  <u>same</u> <u>for</u> <u>most</u> <u>and</u> <u>all,</u> <u>you</u>  <u>can</u>  <u>add</u>
       <u>new</u>  <u>levels.</u>   <u>if</u> <u>you</u> <u>cycle</u> <u>punctuation</u> <u>levels</u> <u>they</u> <u>are</u> <u>recognized.</u>  <u>the</u> <u>default</u> <u>punctuation</u> <u>level</u> <u>is</u> <u>set</u>
       <u>in</u> <u>settings.conf.</u>  <u>The</u> <u>default</u> <u>is</u> <u>"some".</u>  <u>####</u> <u>Punctuation</u>

       The punctuation dictionary "[punctDict]" contains how the punctuation is  spoken.   Example:  [punctDict]
       <u>:===:line</u>
       speaks an  <u>as</u> <u>"line".</u>
       [punctDict]  <u>:===:underscore</u>  <u>speaks</u>  <u>an</u>  as underscore.  for question mark an ?  is appended to the word
       that the TTS system can announce the question correctly.
       ### Custom

       The dict "[customDict]" is just for your own use, it just replace the key with the value without any spe‐
       cial functionality.  This might be used to fix incorrectly spoken words, make words more common,  shorter
       or just for fun.  :) ### Emoticons

       The  Emoticons  dictionary "[emoticonDict]" by default contains some emoticons.  it can replace ":)" with
       "smile" or "XD" with "loool" Making chat more colorful.  A nice feature with this dictionary is that  you
       can  toggle the substitution on or off during run time or in settings.conf.  This is useful because while
       doing programming or other serious work you want to hear colons and perryns not smiles.  # Configuration

       You can configure Fenrir in the following places (ordered by priority): 1.  Commandline Parameters ''-o''
       see Set settings coption (#Set settings  coption)  2.   /etc/fenrir/settings/settings.conf  see  Settigns
       (#Settings)  3.   &lt;sourceTree&gt;/config/settings/settings.conf  see Settigns (#Settings) 4.  hard coded de‐
       faults ## Commandline Arguments

   <b>Set</b> <b>settings</b> <b>option</b>
       You can specify options that overwrite the setting.conf.  This is done with ''-o &lt;list of options&gt;  para‐
       meter.   The  list  of  options  have  the following syntax fenrir -o "section#setting=value;section#set‐
       ting=value"

       For example changing the sound driver to gstreamer and disabling Braille
       fenrir -o "sound#driver=gstreamerDriver;braille#enabled=False=False" or change the debug level to verbose
       fenrir -o "general#debugLevel=3" You can find the available sections and variables here  &lt;#Settings&gt;  See
       Syntax #settings.conf syntax (#settings.conf syntax) ### settings.conf syntax

       the  syntax  of  the settings.conf (#Settings) is quite simple and similar to a "*.ini" file, there are 4
       different elements.  1.  Sections 2.  Settings 3.  Values 4.  Comments

       A comment starts with a # and is ignored by Fenrir.  # this is a comment To group settings we  have  sec‐
       tions.  A section can look like this: [Section] A setting looks like this: settingName=Value

       Example:  sound  (#sound)  #  Turn sound on or off: enabled=True # Select the driver used to play sounds,
       choices are genericDriver and gstreamerDriver.  # Sox is default.  driver=genericDriver

   <b>Settings</b>
   <b>Sound</b>
       The sound is configured in section ''sound (#sound)''.

       Turn sound on or off: enabled=True Values: on=''True'', off=''False''

       Select the driver used to play sounds.  The genericDriver using Sox is the default.

              driver=genericDriver

       Available Drivers:

       • ''genericDriver'' using the generic driver, for Fenrir &lt;1.5 just use ''generic''

       • ''gstreamerDriver'' using the gstreamer, for Fenrir &lt;1.5 just use ''gstreamer''

       These are the pack of sounds used for sound icons.  theme=default By default we ship two sound packs.  1.
       ''default'' opus encoded, for newer Sox versions 2.  ''default-wav'' wav encoded, just for  compatibility
       Sound packs are located at /usr/share/sounds/fenrirscreenreader/

       Sound  volume  controls how loud the sounds for your selected sound pack are.  volume=1.0 Values: ''0.0''
       is quietest, ''1.0'' is loudest.

   <b>Generic</b> <b>Driver</b>
       The generic sound driver uses shell commands for play sound and frequencies.

       ''genericPlayFileCommand'' defines the command that is used to play a  sound  file.   genericPlayFileCom‐
       mand=&lt;your command for playing a file&gt; ''genericFrequencyCommand'' defines the command that is used play‐
       ing frequencies.  genericFrequencyCommand=&lt;your command for playing a frequence&gt;

       The following variables are substituted in ''genericPlayFileCommand'' and ''genericFrequencyCommand'':

       • ''fenrirVolume'' = the current volume setting

       • ''fenrirSoundFile'' = the sound file for an sound icon

       • ''fenrirFrequence'' = the frequency to play

       • ''fenrirDuration'' = the duration of the frequency

       Example  genericPlayFileCommand  (default) genericPlayFileCommand=play -q -v fenrirVolume fenrirSoundFile
       Example genericFrequencyCommand (default) genericFrequencyCommand=play -q -v fenrirVolume  -n  -c1  synth
       fenrirDuration sine fenrirFrequence ### Speech

       Speech  is  configured in section ''[speech]''.  Turn speech on or off: enabled=True Values: on=''True'',
       off=''False''

</pre><h4><b>Select</b> <b>speech</b> <b>driver,</b> <b>options</b> <b>are</b> <b>speechdDriver</b> <b>(default),</b></h4><pre>
       genericDriver or espeakDriver:

       driver=speechdDriver #driver=espeakDriver

</pre><h4><b>driver=genericDriver</b></h4><pre>
       Select the driver used to generate speech output.

              driver=speechdDriver

       Available Drivers:

       • ''genericDriver'' using the generic driver, for Fenrir &lt;1.5 this is not available

       • ''speechdDriver'' using speech-dispatcher, for Fenrir &lt;1.5 just use ''speechd''

       • ''espeakDriver'' using the espeak directly, for Fenrir &lt;1.5 just use ''espeak''

       The rate selects how fast Fenrir will speak.  rate=0.65 Values: Range Minimum:''0.0'' is  slowest,  Maxi‐
       mum:''1.0'' is fastest.

       Pitch  controls  the  pitch  of  the  voice.   pitch=0.5  Values:  Range Minimum:''0.0'' is lowest, Maxi‐
       mum:''1.0'' is highest.

       A Pitch for capital letters can be set.  capitalPitch=0.9 Values: Range Minimum:''0.0'' is lowest,  Maxi‐
       mum:''1.0'' is highest.

       The  Volume  controls  the  loudness of the voice.  volume=1.0 Values: Range Minimum:''0.0'' is quietest,
       Maximum:''1.0'' is loudest.

       Some speech drivers like speechdDriver can support various modules.  these can be set  here.   module=es‐
       peak Values: Text, Consult speech-dispatcher's configuration to see what modules are available.

       Voice  selects the varient you want to use, for example, f5 will use the female voice #5 in Espeak, or if
       using the Espeak module in Speech-dispatcher.  To find out which voices are available, consult the  docu‐
       mentation  provided  with your selected synthesizer.  voice= Values: Text, see your TTS synths documenta‐
       tion what is available.

       Select the language you want Fenrir to use.  language=english-us Values: Text, see your TTS synths  docu‐
       mentation what is available.

       Read new text as it occurs autoReadIncoming=True Values: on=''True'', off=''False''

   <b>Generic</b> <b>Driver</b>
       The generic speech driver uses shell commands for speech synthisus.

       ''genericSpeechCommand'' defines the command that is executed for creating speech The following variables
       are substituted in ''genericSpeechCommand'':

       • ''FenrirText'' = is the text that should be spoken

       • ''fenrirModule'' = may be the speech module like used in speech-dispatcher, not every TTY needs this

       • ''fenrirLanguage'' = the language to speak in

       • ''fenrirVoice'' = is the current voice that should be used

       • ''fenrirVolume'' = is replaced with the current volume

       • ''fenrirPitch'' = is replaced with the current pitch

       • ''fenrirRate'' = is replaced with the current speed (speech rate)

       Example genericSpeechCommand (default): genericSpeechCommand=espeak -a fenrirVolume -s fenrirRate -p fen‐
       rirPitch -v fenrirVoice "fenrirText"

       These are the minimum and maximum values of the TTS system used in genericSpeechCommand.  They are needed
       to calculate the abstract range in volume, rate and pitch 0.0 - 1.0.

              FenrirMinVolume=0
              fenrirMaxVolume=200
              fenrirMinPitch=0
              fenrirMaxPitch=99
              fenrirMinRate=80
              fenrirMaxRate=450

       The current volume, pitch and rate is calculated like this value = min + [volume,pitch,rate] * (min - max
       ) ### Braille

   <b>Scripting</b>
       Scripts can be in any language, bash, python,  sh  or  others.   Place  your  scripts  in  the  directory
       /usr/share/fenrirscreenreader/scripts/  (the  path  is configurable in settings.conf).  The script key is
       the applications key.  Usually this key can be found on the keyboard located just left of the right  most
       control  key.   When  you  name a script, the key name appears in the script seperated by the sequence <b>-</b>.
       So, for example, if you have a python weather script you want assigned to the script key plus the  letter
       w  you  would  name the script /usr/share/fenrirscreenreader/scripts/weather__-__key_w.py Then, to access
       the script, simply press the script key and the letter w.  Scripts must be executable.  So, make sure  to
       chmod  755  your script when you place it in the scripts directory.  The script gets some parameters from
       fenrir when it is executed.  So that information is available in your script then.

   <b>Parameterlist</b>
       Parameter   Content
       ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
       $1          Username of  the  current  logged  in
                   user

   <b>Examples</b>
       Script  that  just  speaks  the  current  username  when pressing ScriptKey + H.\ File: ''/usr/share/fen‐
       rirscreenreader/scripts/helloWorld__-__key_h.sh'': #!<a href="file:/bin/bash">/bin/bash</a> echo $1

   <b>Commands</b>
       You can place your own commands in "/usr/share/fenrirscreenreader/commands" (path is configurable in set‐
       tings.conf).  Commands are python files with a special scheme.  You can assign them to a  shortcut  using
       the  filename  without  an extension or place them in a hook trigger like OnInput or OnScreenChange.  For
       further information see  developer  guide.   Good  Examples:  "date.py"  (https///github.com/chrys87/fen‐
       rir/blob/master/src/fenrir/commands/commands/date.py)      (announce      the     Date),     "shut_up.py"
       (https///github.com/chrys87/fenrir/blob/master/src/fenrir/commands/commands/shut_up.py)  (interrupt  out‐
       put) the basic scheme for a command is as follows:

              from core import debug

              class command():
                def __init__(self):
                    pass
                def initialize(self, environment):
                    self.env = environment
                def shutdown(self):
                    pass
                def getDescription(self):
                    return _('No description found')
                def run(self):
                    pass
                def setCallback(self, callback):
                    pass

       • Template   lives  here  (https///github.com/chrys87/fenrir/blob/master/src/fenrir/commands/command_tem‐
         plate.py)

       • The class needs to have the name "command".

       • "initialize" is running once whilst loading the command.

       • "shutdown" is running on unload like the command (quit fenrir)

       • "getDescriptsion" just returns an string.  That String is used in Tutorial Mode.

       • "run" is executed when the command is invoked.  (shortcut is pressed, or trigger isn't running)

       • setCAllback is currently not used.  and has no functionality yet.

</pre><h4><b>Troubleshooting</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Fenrir</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>start</b>
        1. Have you installed all the dependencies Support and Requirements (#Support and Requirements)

        2. Try using master, a lot of changes take place there to make Fenrir compatible with  more  systems  ##
           Fenrir does not utilize the shortcuts

        3. Make sure you have python3-evdev installed

        4. Use the latest Fenrir version

        5. Make  sure that Fenrir has permission to <a href="file:/dev/input/">/dev/input/</a>* and /dev/uinput (or run it as root) ## No sound
           at all

        6. Run the script to configure Pulseaudio once as root and once as your user.  This will setup  Pulseau‐
           dio but require a restart of Pulseaudio.  The script is located in ''tools/configure_pulse.sh''

        7. Use ALSA

        8. Configure    Pulse   system   wide   (https///www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/Documenta‐
           tion/User/SystemWide/) (Not recommended)

        9. Use gstreamerDriver: change ''settings.conf'' in the section ''sound'' the line ''driver=genericDriv‐
           er'' to ''driver=gstreamerDriver''

       10. Use wave sound-icons: change ''settings.conf'' in the section ''sound'' the line ''theme=default'' to
           ''theme=default-wav''

       11. Use most current version of sox (<a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/">http://sox.sourceforge.net/</a>) with opus support

       12. Try apulse (https///github.com/i-rinat/apulse) (not tested by myself but might work).  Please give me
           feedback if you try it out.  ## You get sound-icons but no speech

       13. If you are using speech-dispatcher run "spd-conf" once as user and as root.

       14. You can test if speech-dispatcher works by invoking it as root\ ''sudo spd-say "hello world"'' ## Bu‐
           greports and feature requests

       Please    report    Bugs    and    feature    requests    to:    https://github.com/chrys87/fenrir/issues
