          ebook-polish [options] input_file [output_file]

       Polishing books is all about putting the shine of perfection onto your carefully crafted e-books.

       Polishing  tries to minimize the changes to the internal code of your e-book.  Unlike conversion, it does
       not flatten CSS, rename files, change font sizes, adjust margins, etc. Every  action  performs  only  the
       minimum set of changes needed for the desired effect.

       You should use this tool as the last step in your e-book creation process.

       Note that polishing only works on files in the AZW3 or EPUB formats.

       Whenever  you pass arguments to <b>ebook-polish</b> that have spaces in them, enclose the arguments in quotation
       marks. For example: "/some path/with spaces"

</pre><h4><b>[OPTIONS]</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--add-soft-hyphens,</b> <b>-H</b>
              Add soft hyphens to all words in the book. This allows the book to be  rendered  better  when  the
              text is justified, in readers that do not support hyphenation.

       <b>--compress-images,</b> <b>-i</b>
              Losslessly compress images in the book, to reduce the filesize, without affecting image quality.

       <b>--cover,</b> <b>-c</b>
              Path  to  a cover image. Changes the cover specified in the e-book. If no cover is present, or the
              cover is not properly identified, inserts a new cover.

       <b>--download-external-resources,</b> <b>-d</b>
              Download external resources such as images, stylesheets, etc. that point to URLs instead of  files
              in  the  book.  All  such  resources  will be downloaded and added to the book so that the book no
              longer references any external resources.

       <b>--embed-fonts,</b> <b>-e</b>
              Embed all fonts that are referenced in the document and are not already embedded. This  will  scan
              your  computer  for  the  fonts,  and  if they are found, they will be embedded into the document.
              Please ensure that you have the proper license for embedding the fonts used in this document.

       <b>--help,</b> <b>-h</b>
              show this help message and exit

       <b>--jacket,</b> <b>-j</b>
              Insert a <b>"</b>book jacket<b>"</b> page at the start of the book that contains all the book metadata  such  as
              title, tags, authors, series, comments, etc. Any previous book jacket will be replaced.

       <b>--opf,</b> <b>-o</b>
              Path to an OPF file. The metadata in the book is updated from the OPF file.

       <b>--remove-jacket</b>
              Remove a previous inserted book jacket page.

       <b>--remove-soft-hyphens</b>
              Remove soft hyphens from all text in the book.

       <b>--remove-unused-css,</b> <b>-u</b>
              Remove  all unused CSS rules from stylesheets and &lt;style&gt; tags. Some books created from production
              templates can have a large number of extra CSS rules that don<b>'</b>t match any  actual  content.  These
              extra rules can slow down readers that need to parse them all.

       <b>--smarten-punctuation,</b> <b>-p</b>
              Convert  plain  text  dashes,  ellipsis, quotes, multiple hyphens, etc. into their typographically
              correct equivalents. Note that the algorithm can sometimes generate incorrect results,  especially
              when single quotes at the start of contractions are involved.

       <b>--subset-fonts,</b> <b>-f</b>
              Subsetting  fonts  means  reducing  an embedded font to contain only the characters used from that
              font in the book. This greatly reduces the size of the font files (halving the font file sizes  is
              common).  For  example,  if the book uses a specific font for headers, then subsetting will reduce
              that font to contain only the characters present in the actual headers in the book. Or if the book
              embeds the bold and italic versions of a font, but bold and italic text  is  relatively  rare,  or
              absent  altogether,  then the bold and italic fonts can either be reduced to only a few characters
              or completely removed. The only downside to subsetting fonts is that  if,  at  a  later  date  you
              decide  to  add  more  text to your books, the newly added text might not be covered by the subset
              font.

       <b>--upgrade-book,</b> <b>-U</b>
              Upgrade the internal structures of the book, if possible. For instance, upgrades EPUB 2  books  to
              EPUB 3 books.

       <b>--verbose</b>
              Produce more verbose output, useful for debugging.

       <b>--version</b>
              show program<b>'</b>s version number and exit
