</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gamemode-simulate-game - simulate a game using gamemode

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gamemode-simulate-game</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>GameMode</b>  is  a  daemon/lib  combo  for  Linux  that  allows  games  to request a set of optimisations be
       temporarily applied to the host OS.

       The design has a clear cut abstraction between the host daemon and library (<b>gamemoded</b>  and  <b>libgamemode</b>),
       and  the  client  loaders  (<b>libgamemodeauto</b>  and  <b>gamemode_client.h</b>)  that  allows for safe usage without
       worrying about whether the daemon is installed or running. This design also means  that  while  the  host
       library  currently  relies  on systemd for exchanging messages with the daemon, it's entirely possible to
       implement other internals that still work with the same clients.

       <b>GameMode</b> was designed primarily as a stop-gap solution to problems with the Intel and AMD  CPU  powersave
       or  ondemand  governors,  but  is intended to be expanded beyond just CPU governor states, as there are a
       wealth of automation tasks one might want to apply.

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The executable starts gamemode, sleeps for 10 seconds and stops it. It will exit with zero if  everything
       works fine, else it will print an error and exit with one.

       To use this with a CI you might need to start a dbus session by hand. This can be done with:

           dbus-run-session -- gamemode-simulate-game

       Note that this might output to stderr, even if it exits with zero.
