</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gngb - emulate various Nintendo Game Boy handheld systems

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gngb</b> <u>[-h]</u> <u>|</u> <u>[options]</u> <u>&lt;romname&gt;</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gngb</b>  is an emulator program that attempts to be various forms of Nintendo Game Boy hardware.  It can run
       the various homebrew games and demos for the system as well as images of commercially-released games.

       This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution because the original program does  not
       have a manual page.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`-').
       A summary of options are included below.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b>
              print help and exit

       <b>-a,</b> <b>--autoframeskip</b>
              turn on autoframeskip.  This is useful if the emulator is running too slow.   It  will  cause  the
              emulator to drop frames every now and then to maintain a realtime emulation.

       <b>--sleep_idle</b>
              sleep  when  idle.   This  will cause the program to sleep when it has idle cycles instead of busy
              looping.  However, this can degrade emulation performance under some circumstances.

       <b>--color_filter</b>
              turn on the color filter.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--rumble</b>
              turn on the rumble simulation.  This will cause the emulated screen to shake when a rumble  effect
              is caused by the running program.

       <b>--filter=X</b>
              Set  the  filter to apply.  These only work when using standard (not YUV or GL) video output.  0 =
              none 1 = scanline 2 = scanline 50% 3 = smooth 4 = pseudo cell shading

       <b>-R,</b> <b>--res=WxH</b>
              set the screen resolution to WxH (for YUV and GL mode only).

       <b>-Y,</b> <b>--yuv</b>
              turn YUV mode on.  This utilizes the hardware YUV colorspace conversion and  scaling  features  if
              your  video card supports it.  Most video cards with Xv support can use this feature for excellent
              performance.

       <b>--yuv_type</b>
              set the type of the YUV overlay: 0 = YV12  1 = YUY2

       <b>-o,</b> <b>--opengl</b>
              turn OpenGL mode on.  This will render the gameboy screen as an OpenGL 3D texture, which  on  some
              cards  may  perform  much  better  than  the  YUV or X11 output.  This requires a 3D card with GLX
              support.

       <b>-f,</b> <b>--fullscreen</b>
              run gngb in fullscreen.  Fullscreen can be toggled during use with F9.

       <b>--fps</b>  Show frames per second counter in the upper left corner of screen.  May  be  toggled  through  the
              emulator's menu.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--sound</b>
              Enable sound.

       <b>--sample_rate=RATE</b>
              Set the sound output sample rate to RATE. (typically a multiple of 11025 Hz)

       <b>--auto_gb</b>
              Automatically  detect  the  system to emulate based on the cartridge image that is selected.  This
              should work in most cases.  If it fails, you can use one of the [ <b>-C,</b> <b>--color_gb</b> | <b>-G,</b> <b>--normal_gb</b>
              | <b>-S,</b> <b>--super_gb</b> ] options to force emulation of a Color, Normal, or Super Game Boy.

       <b>-j,</b> <b>--joy_dev=N</b>
              The default joystick is /dev/js0.  By setting N here, /dev/jsN will be used in its place.

       <b>-g,</b> <b>--gdma_cycle</b>
              This experimental option will halt the CPU during certain DMA operations.  Leave it off unless you
              are working around problems in a certain program.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>--version</b>
              Show version of program.

       Most options can be disabled with --no-OPTION (Ex: --no-sound turn sound off)

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       These are the default keys in the emulator.  These, along with  the  joystick  buttons,  may  be  changed
       through a custom <a href="../man5/gngbrc.5.html">gngbrc</a>(5) file.

       Enter          : Start
       Right Shift    : Select
       W              : B
       X              : A
       TAB            : Open menu

       F9             : fullscreen on/off
       F10            : show fps
       F11            : reset
       F12            : show keysym code

       KeyPad 1-5: Change palette
              Palette must be define in your gngbrc file (see sample_gngbrc)

       KeyPad 6  : Toggle color filter

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       There  is  some  good info in the README included in the doc directory.  The gngbrc file is documented in
       /usr/share/doc/gngb/examples/sample_gngbrc.
