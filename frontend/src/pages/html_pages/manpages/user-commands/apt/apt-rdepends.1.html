</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       apt-rdepends - performs recursive dependency listings similar to apt-cache

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       apt-rdepends [options] [<u>pkgs</u> ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>apt-rdepends</b> searches through the APT cache to find package dependencies.  <b>apt-rdepends</b> knows how to
       emulate the result of calling <b>apt-cache</b> with both <u>depends</u> and <u>dotty</u> options.

       By default, <b>apt-rdepends</b> shows a listing of each dependency a package has.  It will also look at each of
       these fulfilling packages, and recursively lists their dependencies.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b>, <b>--build-depends</b>
               Show build dependencies instead of normal package dependencies.

       <b>-d</b>, <b>--dotty</b>
               dotty  takes  a  list  of  packages  on the command line and generates output suitable for use by
               springgraph (1). The result will be a set of  nodes  and  edges  representing  the  relationships
               between  the  packages. By default the given packages will trace out all dependent packages which
               can produce a very large graph.

               Blue lines are pre-depends, green lines are conflicts, yellow lines are  suggests,  orange  lines
               are recommends, red lines are replaces, and black lines are depends.

               Caution, dotty cannot graph larger sets of packages.

       <b>-p</b>, <b>--print-state</b>
               Shows  the  state  of  each  dependency  after  each  package  version.   See  <b>--state-follow</b> and
               <b>--state-show</b> for why this is useful.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--reverse</b>
               Shows the listings of each package that depends on a package.  Furthermore, it will look at these
               dependent packages, and find their dependers.

       <b>-f</b>, <b>--follow=</b><u>DEPENDS</u>
               A comma-separated list of <u>DEPENDS</u> types to follow recursively.  By default, it only  follows  the
               <u>Depends</u> and <u>PreDepends</u> types.

               The  possible  values  for  <u>DEPENDS</u>  are:  <u>Depends</u>,  <u>PreDepends</u>, <u>Suggests</u>, <u>Recommends</u>, <u>Conflicts</u>,
               <u>Replaces</u>, and <u>Obsoletes</u>.

               In <b>--build-depends</b> mode, the possible  values  are:  <u>Build-Depends</u>,  <u>Build-Depends-Indep</u>,  <u>Build-</u>
               <u>Conflicts</u>, <u>Build-Conflicts-Indep</u>.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--show=</b><u>DEPENDS</u>
               A  comma-separated list of <u>DEPENDS</u> types to show, when displaying a listing.  By default, it only
               shows the <u>Depends</u> and <u>PreDepends</u> types.

       <b>--state-follow=</b><u>STATES</u>
       <b>--state-show=</b><u>STATES</u>
               These two options are similar to <b>--follow</b> and <b>--show</b>.  They both deal with the current state of a
               package.  By default, the value of <u>STATES</u> is  <u>Unknown</u>,  <u>NotInstalled</u>,  <u>UnPacked</u>,  <u>HalfConfigured</u>,
               <u>HalfInstalled</u>, <u>ConfigFiles</u>, and <u>Installed</u>.

               These options are useful, if you only want to only look at the dependencies between the <u>Installed</u>
               packages on your system.  You can then call:

                   apt-rdepends --state-follow=Installed libfoo

               Or if you want to only show the packages installed on your system:

                   apt-rdepends --state-follow=Installed --state-show=Installed libfoo

       <u>pkgs</u>    The list of packages on which to discover dependencies.

       <b>-v</b>, <b>--vcg</b>, <b>--xvcg</b>
               This option takes a list of packages on the command line and generates output suitable for use by
               xvcg.   The  result  will  be a set of nodes and edges representing the relationships between the
               packages. By default the given packages will trace out all dependent packages which can produce a
               very large graph.

               Blue lines are pre-depends, green lines are conflicts, yellow lines are  suggests,  orange  lines
               are recommends, red lines are replaces, and black lines are depends.

       <b>-o</b>, <b>--option=</b><u>OPTION</u>
               Set  an  APT Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary configuration option. The syntax is
               <b>-o</b> <b>Foo::Bar=bar</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>apt-rdepends</b> does not emulate <b>apt-cache</b>  perfectly.   It  does  not  display  information  about  virtual
       packages, nor does it know about virtual packages when it is in reverse dependency mode.

       <b>apt-rdepends</b> also does not know how to stop after a certain depth has been reached.

       <b>apt-rdepends</b> cannot do reverse build-dependencies.  This is really difficult, since it would have to load
       the whole cache into memory before discovering which packages depend on others to build.

       <b>apt-rdepends</b> exists.  This functionality should really reside in <b>apt-cache</b> itself.
