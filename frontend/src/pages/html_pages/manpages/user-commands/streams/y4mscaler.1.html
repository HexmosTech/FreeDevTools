       y4mscaler - Scale/crop/translate a YUV4MPEG2 stream

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>y4mscaler</b> [<u>options</u>] <u>&lt;</u> <u>Y4Mstream</u> <u>&gt;</u> <u>Y4Mstream</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>y4mscaler</b> is a general-purpose video scaler which operates on YUV4MPEG2 streams, as produced and consumed
       by the MJPEGtools such as <b>lav2yuv</b> and <b><a href="../man1/mpeg2enc.1.html">mpeg2enc</a></b>(1).

       <b>y4mscaler</b> is meant to be used in a pipeline.  Thus, input is from stdin, and output is to stdout.

       The  essential  function  of  <b>y4mscaler</b>  is to scale a specified "active" region of the input stream (the
       source) into a specified active region of the output stream (the target).  Pixels outside of  the  active
       region  of  the  source  are ignored; pixels outside of the active region of the target are filled with a
       background color.  The source may additionally have a matte applied to  it;  pixels  outside  the  source
       matte are set to a separately specified background color.

       <b>y4mscaler</b>  correctly  handles  chroma  subsampling,  and  thus  it  can  also  perform chroma subsampling
       conversions.  The YUV4MPEG2 stream format supports three varieties  of  4:2:0  subsampling,  as  well  as
       4:1:1,  4:2:2,  4:4:4, a 4:4:4 modes with an alpha channel, and a monochrome luma-only mode.  (See "NOTES
       ON CHROMA MODES AND SUBSAMPLING".)

       <b>y4mscaler</b> can perform simple interlacing conversions:  switching from  top-field-first  to  bottom-field-
       first  and  vice-versa  (by  lossily  discarding the first field), and creating a progressive stream from
       interlaced by discarding every other field (effectively halving the vertical resolution).

       The source and target are defined by many, many parameters,  but  <b>y4mscaler</b>  has  many,  many  heuristics
       built-in to automagically set them appropriately.  Most source parameters are taken from the input stream
       header.  Remaining source and target parameters which are not specified by the user are guessed in a sane
       manner.

       <b>y4mscaler</b>  includes preset parameters for a number of common target streams: DVD, VideoCD (VCD), SuperVCD
       (SVCD), associated still image formats, and DV.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To create a stream appropriate for use in an SVCD:

            y4mscaler -O preset=svcd

       To create a stream for a VideoCD (a non-interlaced format), from a  DV  source  (an  interlaced  format),
       shifting the input frame 4 pixels to the left:

            y4mscaler -I ilace=bottom-only -I active=-4+0cc -O preset=vcd

       To  take  a  widescreen NTSC DV source, and convert it to a letterboxed stream, with blue bars on the top
       and bottom:

            y4mscaler -O sar=ntsc -O bg=RGB:0,0,255

       To take a widescreen NTSC DV source, and convert it to a "fullscreen" stream (i.e. the sides are clipped,
       just like on TV):

            y4mscaler -O sar=ntsc -O infer=clip

       To take a centered, letterboxed NTSC source, and convert it to a widescreen (16:9) format stream for DVD,
       with the black bars removed:

            y4mscaler -O preset=dvd -O sar=ntsc_wide -O infer=clip

       To take the center 100x100 pixel chunk of an NTSC DV stream, surround it with a 20-pixel blue border, and
       blow that up to a full-screen SuperVCD stream:

            y4mscaler -I active=140x140+0+0cc -I matte=100x100+0+0cc -I bg=RGB:0,0,255 -O preset=svcd

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The first three options, -v, -V, and  -h,  are  simple  straightforward  options  which  take  either  no
       arguments or one numeric argument.

       <b>-v</b> <u>[0,1,2]</u>
            Set verbosity level.
             0 = warnings and errors only.
             1 = add informative messages, too (default).
             2 = add chatty debugging message, too.

       <b>-V</b>   Show version information and exit.

       <b>-h</b>   Show a help message (synopsis of options).

       The  -I,  -O, and -S options each take one argument of the form <u>parameter=value,</u> which specify parameters
       for the input, output, and scaling, respectively.  These  options  can  be  used  repeatedly  to  specify
       multiple  parameters.   The  parameter  names and values are not case-sensitive.  Definitions of the form
       "parameter=[AAA|BBB|CCC]" mean that only one of the listed keywords AAA,  BBB,  or  CCC  may  be  chosen.
       Succeeding options will override earlier ones.

       <b>-I</b> <u>input_parameter</u>
            Specify  parameters  for  the  source/input  stream.  All '-I' arguments are evaluated in order, and
            later arguments on the command-line will override earlier ones.  All '-I'  arguments  are  evaluated
            before any '-O' arguments.

            <b>active=</b><u>WxH+X+Yaa</u>
               Specify  the  active  region of the source frame, which is scaled to fit the active region of the
               target frame.  The default is the full frame.  (The "WxH" may be omitted,  and  the  region  size
               defaults  to  the  size  of of the source frame.)  W and H are width and height.  X and Y are the
               offset of the anchor point.  "aa" is  the  anchor  mode  (default:  TL);  see  "NOTES  ON  REGION
               GEOMETRY" for details.
               Example:  active=200x180+30+24cc

            <b>matte=</b><u>WxH+X+Y</u>
               Specify  a  matte  region for the source frame.  All pixels outside of this region are set to the
               source background color. The default matte is the full frame.  (The "WxH" may be omitted, and the
               region size defaults to the size of of the source frame.)  W and H are width and height.  X and Y
               are the offset of the anchor point.  "aa" is the anchor mode (default: TL); see "NOTES ON  REGION
               GEOMETRY" for details.
               Example:  matte=200x180+30+24cc

            <b>bg=</b><u>RGB:r,g,b</u>
            <b>bg=</b><u>YCBCR:y,cb,cr</u>
            <b>bg=</b><u>RGBA:r,g,b,a</u>
            <b>bg=</b><u>YCBCRA:y,cb,cr,a</u>
               Set  the  source  background  color.  Pixels outside of the source's matte region are set to this
               color. One can specify the color as either a R'G'B' or Y'CbCr triplet.  For example, the  default
               color  is black, specified as "bg=YCBCR:16,128,128" or "bg=RGB:0,0,0".  The 'A' versions will set
               the alpha (transparency) value of the color.  The alpha range is [0,255] for  RGBA  and  [16,235]
               for YCBCRA.  The default is fully-opaque (255 for RGBA, 235 for YCBCRA).

            <b>norm=</b>[<b>NTSC</b>|<b>PAL</b>|<b>SECAM</b>]
               Specify the "norm" of the source stream.  This is normally inferred from the stream header.

            <b>ilace=</b>[<b>NONE</b>|<b>TOP_FIRST</b>|<b>BOTTOM_FIRST</b>|<b>TOP_ONLY</b>|<b>BOTTOM_ONLY</b>]
               Specify  the interlacing used by the source stream.  NONE, TOP_FIRST, and BOTTOM_FIRST correspond
               to non-interlaced, top-field-first, and bottom-field-first.  These values are  normally  inferred
               from the stream header; specifying them will override the stream header.
               TOP_ONLY  and BOTTOM_ONLY specify that only the top or bottom field of each frame should be used;
               the other field is discarded.  These options can only be used with an interlaced input, and cause
               the interlaced stream to be treated as a progressive stream  with  half  the  height.   (This  is
               particularly  useful  in  creating  a  VCD  from a full-size interlaced input stream.)  These two
               special options can only be used when the source is a pure progressive stream (as  opposed  to  a
               YUV4MPEG2 "mixed-mode" stream).

            <b>chromass=</b>[<b>420JPEG</b>|<b>420MPEG2</b>|<b>420PALDV</b>|<b>444</b>|<b>422</b>|<b>411</b>|<b>mono</b>|<b>444alpha</b>]
               Specify  the  chroma subsampling mode used in the source stream.  This parameter is inferred from
               the stream header, so this keyword should almost never be used in a  source  specification.   The
               only  useful reason to specify this keyword is to override one variety of 4:2:0 with another. Any
               other use will cause processing to fail.

            <b>sar=</b><u>N:D</u>
            <b>sar=</b>[<b>NTSC</b>|<b>PAL</b>|<b>NTSC_WIDE</b>|<b>PAL_WIDE</b>]
               Specify the sample-aspect-ratio of the source stream.  The value can either be or  numeric  ratio
               (such as "10:11") or one of the keywords, which correspond to the CCIR-601 values for 4:3 or 16:9
               displays, respectively.  This parameter is usually inferred from the stream header.

       <b>-O</b> <u>output_parameter</u>
            Specify  parameters  for  the destination/output stream.  All '-O' arguments are evaluated in order,
            and later arguments on the  command-line  will  override  earlier  ones.   All  '-O'  arguments  are
            evaluated after any '-I' arguments.

            <b>size=</b><u>WxH</u>
            <b>size=SRC</b>
               Set  the  output/target  frame  size,  as width W and height H in pixels.  Use the keyword <b>SRC</b> to
               specify that the target frame size should match the source frame size.

            <b>active=</b><u>WxH+X+Yaa</u>
               Specify the active region of the target frame, into which the active region of the  source  frame
               is scaled.  The default is the full target frame.  (The "WxH" may be omitted, and the region size
               defaults  to  the  size  of of the target frame.)  W and H are width and height.  X and Y are the
               offset of the anchor point.  "aa" is  the  anchor  mode  (default:  TL);  see  "NOTES  ON  REGION
               GEOMETRY" for details.
               Example:  active=200x180+30+24cc

            <b>bg=</b><u>RGB:r,g,b</u>
            <b>bg=</b><u>YCBCR:y,cb,cr</u>
            <b>bg=</b><u>RGBA:r,g,b,a</u>
            <b>bg=</b><u>YCBCRA:y,cb,cr,a</u>
               Set  the  target  background color.  Pixels outside of the target's active region are set to this
               color. One can specify the color as either a R'G'B' or Y'CbCr triplet.  For example, the  default
               color  is black, specified as "bg=YCBCR:16,128,128" or "bg=RGB:0,0,0".  The 'A' versions will set
               the alpha (transparency) value of the color.  The alpha range is [0,255] for  RGBA  and  [16,235]
               for YCBCRA.  The default is fully-opaque (255 for RGBA, 235 for YCBCRA).

            <b>ilace=</b>[<b>NONE</b>|<b>TOP_FIRST</b>|<b>BOTTOM_FIRST</b>]
               Specify  the interlacing used by the target stream.  NONE, TOP_FIRST, and BOTTOM_FIRST correspond
               to non-interlaced, top-field-first, and bottom-field-first.  The default if to match  the  source
               stream.
               If the source and target are both interlaced, but with different modes (i.e. one is bottom-first,
               and  the  other  is top-first), then <b>y4mscaler</b> will convert one mode to the other by dropping the
               first source field.

            <b>chromass=</b>[<b>420JPEG</b>|<b>420MPEG2</b>|<b>420PALDV</b>|<b>444</b>|<b>422</b>|<b>411</b>|<b>mono</b>|<b>444alpha</b>]
               Specify the chroma subsampling mode to be used in the target stream.  The default is to match the
               source mode.  See "NOTES ON CHROMA MODES AND SUBSAMPLING" for more information.

            <b>sar=</b><u>N:D</u>
            <b>sar=</b>[<b>SRC</b>|<b>NTSC</b>|<b>PAL</b>|<b>NTSC_WIDE</b>|<b>PAL_WIDE</b>]
               Specify the sample-aspect-ratio of the source stream.  The value can either be or  numeric  ratio
               (such as "10:11") or one of the keywords, which correspond to the CCIR-601 values for 4:3 or 16:9
               displays, respectively.  The keyword <b>SRC</b> specifies that the target SAR should match the source.

            <b>scale=</b><u>N/D</u>
            <b>Xscale=</b><u>N/D</u>
            <b>Yscale=</b><u>N/D</u>
               Set  the  scaling  ratios,  as  a  fraction;  for example, scale=1/2.  "scale=" sets both X and Y
               factors simultaneously.  "Xscale=" and "Yscale=" can be used to set them independently.

            <b>infer=</b>[<b>PAD</b>|<b>CLIP</b>|<b>PRESERVE_X</b>|<b>PRESERVE_Y</b>]
               Set the mode used to infer scaling ratios from  active  regions  and  SAR's.   The  keywords  are
               mutually exclusive. The default is PAD.

            <b>infer=</b>[<b>SIMPLIFY</b>|<b>EXACT</b>]
               Set  whether  the  above heuristic uses exact ratios, or whether it is allowed to slightly adjust
               active regions to simplify the scaling ratios.  The keywords are mutually exclusive.  The default
               is SIMPLIFY.

            <b>align=</b>[<b>TL</b>|<b>TC</b>|<b>TR</b>|<b>CL</b>|<b>CC</b>|<b>CR</b>|<b>BL</b>|<b>BC</b>|<b>BR</b>]
               Set the alignment point between the source and target active regions.  The keywords specify "top-
               left", "top-center", "top-right", etc.  The specified corner or point from the source region will
               be mapped to the same spot in the target region; and cropping or padding which is applied to  the
               active  regions  will  preserve  this  mapping.  The default is CC, for "center-center", i.e. the
               source and target regions are mutually centered.   The  keywords  are  mutually  exclusive.   The
               default is CC.  See "NOTES ON SOURCE AND TARGET ALIGNMENT" for details.

            <b>preset=</b>[<b>VCD</b>|<b>CVD</b>|<b>SVCD</b>|<b>DVD</b>|<b>DVD_WIDE</b>|<b>DV</b>|<b>DV_WIDE</b>|
                    <b>SVCD_STILL_HI</b>|<b>SVCD_STILL_LO</b>|<b>VCD_STILL_HI</b>|<b>VCD_STILL_LO</b>|
                    <b>ATSC_720P</b>|<b>ATSC_1080I</b>|<b>ATSC_1080P</b>]
               Use  preset  target  parameters  for several common output formats.  Individual parameters can be
               overridden by following with more "-O" settings.  These keywords are mutually exclusive.  For the
               details of what settings these preset keywords imply, see "NOTES ON TARGET PRESETS".

               <b>VCD</b> - 352-wide VideoCD, progressive

               <b>CVD</b> - 352-wide (full-height) ChinaVideoDisc

               <b>SVCD</b> - 480-wide SuperVCD

               <b>DVD</b> - 720-wide DVD

               <b>DVD_WIDE</b> - 720-wide DVD, anamorphic pixels

               <b>DV</b> - 720-wide DV (bottom-field-first, 4:1:1)

               <b>DV_WIDE</b> - 720-wide DV, anamorphic pixels

               <b>SVCD_STILL_HI</b> - high-resolution SVCD still image

               <b>SVCD_STILL_LO</b> - low-resolution SVCD still image

               <b>VCD_STILL_HI</b> - high-resolution VCD still image

               <b>VCD_STILL_LO</b> - low-resolution SVCD still image

               <b>ATSC_1080I</b> - ATSC 1080i (interlaced HDTV)

               <b>ATSC_1080P</b> - ATSC 1080p (HDTV)

       <b>-S</b> <u>scaling_parameter</u>
            Specify parameters for the scaling engine.  All '-S' arguments are evaluated  in  order,  and  later
            arguments on the command-line will override earlier ones.

            <b>mode=MONO</b>
               Request  monochrome  scaling.   The  source  is treated as monochrome and its chroma channels are
               ignored.  The chroma channels of the output stream will be zeroed to yield a grayscale output.

            <b>mode=LINESWITCH</b>
               Request line swapping.  Effectively, the top and bottom fields within each frame will be swapped.
               This may help with malformed streams that have a messed up spatial order.  This  option  is  only
               effective on interlaced streams.

            <b>scaler=</b><u>scaler-name</u>
               Use a particular scaling engine.  The available engines are:
                'default' - Matto's Generic Scaler (the default)

            <b>option=</b><u>scaler-option</u>
               Specify  an  option  for  the  chosen  scaling  engine.   To  see  all the available options, use
               "option=help".

               For the default engine, the available <u>scaler-option</u>s select the filter kernel:

                  <b>box</b> - box filter

                  <b>linear</b> - linear interpolation

                  <b>quadratic</b> - quadratic interpolation

                  <b>cubic</b> - cubic interpolation, Mitchell-Netravali spline

                  <b>cubicCR</b> - cubic interpolation, Catmull-Rom spline

                  <b>cubicB</b> - cubic interpolation, B-spline

                  <b>cubicK4</b> - Keys 4th-order cubic

                  <b>sinc:N</b> - sinc with Lanczos window, N cycles

               To select kernels for the x  and  y  scaling  directions  independently,  use  two  kernel  names
               separated by a comma, e.g. <u>option=box,quadratic</u>.

               <b>sinc:N</b>  will  give  the  best  quality results (least aliasing), but is the slowest.  The quality
               improves with larger values of N, as does processing time.  <b>cubic</b> is generally  regarded  in  the
               graphics  world  as  the  3rd-order  cubic  spline  with the best trade-off between smoothing and
               aliasing.  <b>box</b> yields the worst quality results (most aliasing), but is the fastest.  The default
               kernel is <b>cubicK4</b>, which has a flatter passband and sharper cutoff than <b>cubic</b>.  (It requires  the
               same computational power as <b>sinc:4</b>, but produces less ringing artifacts.)

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>TARGET</b> <b>PRESETS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  table  details  the settings provided by the various target "preset=" keywords.  When two
       values are given the primary is for NTSC streams; the value in {braces} is for PAL streams.  If interlace
       value is unspecified, it is inherited from the source, otherwise  the  indicated  target  interlacing  is
       required.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>REGION</b> <b>GEOMETRY</b></h4><pre>
       Active  and  matte regions are specified using a geometry string of the form "WxH+X+Yaa".  The "WxH" part
       specifies the size of the region, as a Width and Height in pixels.  (In some  cases,  the  "WxH"  may  be
       omitted,  and the region size defaults to the full frame size.)  The "+X+Y" specifies the position of the
       region, as an offset relative to the anchor point specified by "aa".

       The "aa" code can be one of <b>TL</b>, <b>TC</b>, <b>TR</b>, <b>CL</b>, <b>CC</b>, <b>CR</b>, <b>BL</b>, <b>BC</b>, or <b>BR</b>.  These  stand  for  "top-left",  "top-
       center", ..., "bottom-center", "bottom-right".  These codes are not case-sensitive.

       The "+X+Y" specifies the offset of the region's anchor point from the frame's anchor point.  For example,
       "+20+30TL"  means  that  the  top-left  corner of the region will be offset 20 pixels to the right and 30
       pixels down from the top-left corner of the frame.

       The offset values can also be negative.  For example,  "-4+0CC"  means  that  the  center  (vertical  and
       horizontal) of the region is offset 4 pixels to the left of the center of the frame.

       The default anchoring point for geometry strings is <b>TL</b>, i.e. the top-left corner.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>SOURCE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>TARGET</b> <b>ALIGNMENT</b></h4><pre>
       Often,  the source and target active regions do not match exactly.  This happens when, using the given or
       calculated scaling ratios, the source region scales to a different size or shape than the target  region.
       In  this case, the source and target regions are mutually clipped, so that only the portion of the source
       which fits will be scaled into the target.

       Before any clipping or padding, the source and target regions are aligned so that  the  points  specified
       via the "align=aa" parameter coincide.  The "aa" code specifies an anchor point as described above.

       For  example,  "align=BC"  specifies that the bottom-center of the source region should get mapped to the
       bottom-center of the target region.  In other words, the source region will be horizontally centered  and
       vertically aligned to the bottom of the target region before clipping:

               ----------------  source
               |abcdefghijklmn|
            ---|opqrstuvwxyz01|---  target      ----------------
            |  |234567890ABCDE|  |              |234567890ABCDE|
            |  |FGHIJKLMNOPQRS|  |              |FGHIJKLMNOPQRS|
            |  |TUVWXYZabcdefg|  |              |TUVWXYZabcdefg|
            ----------------------              ----------------
                   Before                       Mutually Clipped

       If  instead "align=TR" were centered, the source would be clipped in a different place, and scaled into a
       different region of the target frame:

            ----------------------                 ----------------
            |     |abcdefghijklmn|                 |abcdefghijklmn|
            |     |opqrstuvwxyz01|                 |opqrstuvwxyz01|
            |     |234567890ABCDE|                 |234567890ABCDE|
            ------|FGHIJKLMNOPQRS|                 ----------------
         target   |TUVWXYZabcdefg| source
                  ----------------
                   Before                       Mutually Clipped

       The default alignment mode is "CC", that is, the source and target are mutually centered.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>SCALE</b> <b>FACTOR</b> <b>INFERENCE</b></h4><pre>
       If the X and Y scaling factors are not explicitly provided, <b>y4mscaler</b> will infer  the  factors  from  the
       source and target active regions and sample aspect ratios (SAR's).

       If the active regions are not compatible shape-wise (given the SAR's), the source and target regions will
       be  clipped  or  padded  according  to  one  of four policies.  The policy is selected using the "infer="
       parameter and one of the keywords <b>PAD</b>, <b>CLIP</b>, <b>PRESERVE_X</b>, or <b>PRESERVE_Y</b>.  (The default is <b>PAD</b>.)

          <b>PAD</b>
             Pick scaling factors which will pad the source, but ensure that all of  the  source  image  content
             ends up in the target.

          <b>CLIP</b>
             Pick  scaling  factors which will clip the source, but which will fill the target region as much as
             possible.

          <b>PRESERVE_X</b>
             Pick scaling factors which preserve as much of the horizontal source content as possible.

          <b>PRESERVE_Y</b>
             Pick scaling factors which preserve as much of the vertical source content as possible.

       The policy is further affected by a choice of two other keywords, <b>SIMPLIFY</b>, or <b>EXACT</b>.   (The  default  is
       <b>SIMPLIFY</b>.)

          <b>EXACT</b>
             Calculate exact scaling factors.

          <b>SIMPLIFY</b>
             Adjust the active regions and scaling factors (within 10% or so), to simplify the ratios as much as
             possible.  (For example, crop or pad slightly to achieve a ratio of 2/1 rather than 45/22.)

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>CHROMA</b> <b>MODES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SUBSAMPLING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>y4mscaler</b>  can  convert streams from one chroma subsampling mode to another.  Such conversions are always
       lossy operations, even if the overall frame is undergoing 1/1 scaling.

       <b>y4mscaler</b> will infer the source's subsampling mode from tags in the  input  stream  header.   The  target
       presets  ("preset=XXX")  will  attempt  to  set the target subsampling mode appropriately.  Otherwise, by
       default the target subsampling mode will match the source.  One can explicitly set the  subsampling  mode
       for the source and/or the target by using the "chromass=" parameter.

       <b>y4mscaler</b>  is  capable  of  reading  and writing streams in the 4:4:4, 4:2:2, 4:1:1, and 4:2:0 (all three
       varieties) subsampling modes.  The first three, however, are a relatively new addition to  the  YUV4MPEG2
       standard,  and  many MJPEGtools will fail to process them correctly, if at all.  smil2yuv and raw2yuv can
       produce native 4:1:1 streams from NTSC DV video, which can then be converted to 4:2:0 by <b>y4mscaler</b> before
       further processing by other tools.

       If the source has an alpha-channel (i.e. 444ALPHA mode) and the target does not, the alpha  channel  will
       simply  be  discarded.   On the other hand, if the target has an alpha-channel but the source does not, a
       constant alpha-channel will be created using the alpha-value of the target's background color (as set  by
       "-O bg=").  The default is fully-opaque.

       Similarly, if the target has chroma channels but the source does not (i.e. a luma-only MONO stream), then
       the chroma channels in the output will be set according to the background color.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b> <b>ON</b> <b>ANOMALOUS</b> <b>INTERLACE</b> <b>MIXTURES</b></h4><pre>
       The  YUV4MPEG2  format  allows  for  "mixed-mode  interlacing"  streams,  which  may contain a mixture of
       progressive and interlaced frames.  Each frame is tagged as temporally  interlaced  or  progressive,  and
       vertically-subsampled  frames  (4:2:0  formats)  are  further  tagged  as  spatially  interlaced  or not.
       Unfortunately, this allows for the possibility  of  <b>anomalous</b>  frames,  which  happen  to  be  temporally
       interlaced  (fields  sampled  at different times) but spatially progressive (subsampling performed across
       entire frame), or vice-versa.  The only  reasonable  thing  to  do  with  such  anomalous  frames  is  to
       vertically-upsample the chroma, essentially making to problem go away as quickly as possible.

       <b>y4mscaler</b>  will  only  process such frames if the target output format is non-vertically-subsampled (e.g.
       4:4:4, 4:2:2, etc.) and no other vertical processing is  required.   Otherwise  <b>y4mscaler</b>  will  bail  on
       processing  in  midstream  when  it  encounters  an  anomalous  frame.   If  there  is any possibility of
       encountering such an error, <b>y4mscaler</b> will print a warning when processing begins.
