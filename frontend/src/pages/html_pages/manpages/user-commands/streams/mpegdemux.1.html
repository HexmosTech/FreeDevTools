       mpegdemux - MPEG1/2 system stream demultiplexer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mpegdemux</b> <u>[options]</u> <u>[input</u> <u>[output]]</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man1/mpegdemux.1.html">mpegdemux</a></b>(1)  is  an  MPEG1/MPEG2  system stream demultiplexer. It can be used to list the contents of an
       MPEG system stream and to extract elementary streams.

       <b><a href="../man1/mpegdemux.1.html">mpegdemux</a></b>(1) has four primary modes of operation:

       scan   In this mode the MPEG system stream is scanned for elementary streams.

       list   In this mode the contents of an MPEG system stream are listed in a textual form. This is useful to
              get an overview of what's in an MPEG file

       demux  In this mode elementary streams are extracted from an MPEG system stream. The system stream packet
              structure is dissolved in the process. Typically each extracted stream is written to its own file.

       remux  This is like demux, except that the MPEG system stream structure is left intact. This  means  that
              the output is again an MPEG system stream with all but the selected elementary streams removed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-a,</b> <b>--ac3</b>
              AC3  sound  packets  in  DVD  MPEG2  streams have a 3 byte header that is neither part of the MPEG
              specification nor of the AC3 specification. When this option is used, these 3 bytes are removed to
              produce a correct AC3 stream. Note that this option applies to  all  selected  substreams  without
              checking whether they actually contain an AC3 elementary stream.

       <b>-b,</b> <b>--base-name</b> <u>name</u>
              When  demultiplexing  more than one stream, the output file names can be set using this option. To
              generate the output file name for a stream, every # character in <u>name</u> is replaced by a  hex  digit
              of the stream id. For example, to extract all video streams in one go, use something like

              $ mpegdemux -d -b video_##.m1v -s 0xc0-0xcf src.mpg

              to get files video_c0.m1v, video_c1.m1v, ...

       <b>-c</b> <b>--scan</b>
              Scan  a system stream for elementary streams. This is the default mode. All streams and substreams
              are automatically selected when using this option.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--demux</b>
              Demultiplex an MPEG system stream. The demultiplexed streams are written to the output file unless
              the <b>--base-name</b> option is used. If the <b>--base-name</b> option is not used,  only  one  stream  can  be
              demultiplexed  (if  more  streams  are  specified, they will be randomly interleaved in the output
              file).

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--no-drop</b>
              Don't drop incomplete packets in demuxing and remuxing mode.

       <b>-e,</b> <b>--no-end</b>
              Don't print end codes in listing mode. Additionally, in remuxing mode, make  sure  that  there  is
              exactly one end code at the end of the stream.

       <b>-E,</b> <b>--empty-packs</b>
              When  streams  are removed during remuxing, packs can become empty. Including these empty packs in
              the output is pointless and therefore is not done by default. Use this option to  force  inclusion
              of all packs.

       <b>-F,</b> <b>--first-pts</b>
              In  scan  mode,  in  addition  to each stream's first packet, also list the packet with the lowest
              presentation time stamp.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--no-system-headers</b>
              Don't print system headers in listing mode. Additionally, in remuxing mode,  don't  repeat  system
              headers.

       <b>-i,</b> <b>--invalid</b> <u>spec</u>
              Select  invalid  streams.  Packets  of  invalid  streams  are  not recognized as packets and their
              contents are parsed as MPEG system stream data rather than  being  skipped.  This  is  useful  for
              broken/incomplete  streams.  The  syntax for <u>spec</u> is the same as for <b>-s</b>.  Additionally, if <u>spec</u> is
              "-" then all streams that have not yet been selected by <b>-s</b> are made invalid.

       <b>-k,</b> <b>--no-packs</b>
              Don't print packs in listing mode.

       <b>-K,</b> <b>--remux-skipped</b>
              Copy bytes that are skipped while looking for a start code.

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--list</b>
              List the system headers, packs and packets in an MPEG system stream.

       <b>-m,</b> <b>--packet-max-size</b> <u>size</u>
              Set the maximum packet size to <u>size</u>. Packets in the input stream that are  larger  are  considered
              invalid.  As with the <b>-i</b> option, the packet is not simply skipped but parsed as MPEG system stream
              data.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--substream</b> <u>spec</u>
              This option selects private substreams. Whenever Private Stream 1 (0xbd) is selected using <b>-s</b>, the
              substreams within that private stream can be selected using <b>-p</b>. The syntax for <u>spec</u> is the same as
              for <b>-s</b>.

       <b>-P,</b> <b>--substream-map</b> <u>id1</u> <u>id2</u>
              Remap substream <u>id1</u> to <u>id2</u> when remuxing.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--remux</b>
              Remultiplex an MPEG system stream. The output MPEG system stream is written to  the  output  file.
              Many options control what is copied from the input to the output and what is discarded.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--streams</b> <u>spec</u>
              This option selects streams. <u>spec</u> specifies the stream IDs in the following form:

              [+|-]&lt;id&gt;[-&lt;id&gt;]{/[+|-]&lt;id&gt;[-&lt;id&gt;]}

              where  id is either a numeric stream ID or one of <b>all</b> or <b>none</b>. A "-" in front of an ID range means
              exclusion. For example the spec

              -s 0xc0-0xcf/-0xc2

              selects all video streams (0xc0 - 0xcf) except stream 0xc2.

       <b>-S,</b> <b>--stream-map</b> <u>id1</u> <u>id2</u>
              Remap stream <u>id1</u> to <u>id2</u> when remuxing.

       <b>-t,</b> <b>--no-packets</b>
              Don't print packets in listing mode.

       <b>-u,</b> <b>--spu</b>
              This option is used to extract DVD subtitles. It is necessary because the subtitle streams on  DVD
              don't  contain all the timing information (the time stamps in the packet headers are required). If
              this option is used during demultiplexing, the output files for all substreams are written in  the
              following format:

              "SPU " (4 bytes)

              PTS (8 bytes, MSB first)
              SPU packet

              PTS (8 bytes)
              SPU packet

              and so on

       <b>-x,</b> <b>--split</b>
              Split  the remuxed stream at sequence boundaries. This option is only meaningful in remuxing mode.
              It can not be used together with the <b>-e</b> option. The individual  sequences  are  written  to  files
              whose name was set with the <b>-b</b> option.

       <b>--help</b> Print usage information

       <b>--version</b>
              Print version information

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Scan a system stream for elementary streams:

       $ mpegdemux -c -v src.mpg

       List the contents of an MPEG system stream:

       $ mpegdemux -l -k -s all -p all src.mpg

       Extract the first video stream:

       $ mpegdemux -d -s 0xe0 src.mpg dst.m1v

       Extract all audio streams:

       $ mpegdemux -d -s 0xc0-0xdf -b audio_##.mpa src.mpg

       Remove the second video stream:

       $ mpegdemux -r -s all/-0xc1 -p all src.mpg dst.mpg

       Extract the first AC3 audio stream from a DVD MPEG2 system stream:

       $ mpegdemux -d -s 0xbd -p 0x80 --ac3 src.mpg dst.ac3

       Exchange the first and the second audio stream:

       $ mpegdemux -r -s all -p all -S 0xc0 0xc1 -S 0xc1 0xc0 src.mpg dst.mpg
