       y4mtopnm - Convert a YUV4MPEG2 stream to PNM images

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>y4mtopnm</b> [<u>options</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>y4mtopnm</b> converts a YUV4MPEG2 stream into a sequence of raw PPM, PGM, or PAM images.  (Technically, "pnm"
       comprises the PPM, PGM and PBM formats.  PAM is a fourth format, which can effectively contain any of the
       other three, and more.)

       Output is to stdout (but feel free to have the shell redirect to a file).

       Input  is  read from stdin, like all other YUV4MPEG2 filters and tools.  YUV4MPEG2 streams contain frames
       using the Y'CbCr colorspace (ITU-R BT.601).  For 4:4:4 (color) streams, <b>y4mtopnm</b> will convert each  pixel
       to  the  usual  R'G'B' colorspace used for computer graphics, and produce PPM images.  "MONO" (luma-only)
       streams will be converted to full-range [0,255] grayscale and output as PGM images.

       YUV4MPEG2 streams may (often!) have subsampled chroma planes, but <b>y4mtopnm</b> will not process them  (except
       in the special 'flatten' mode; see below).  Subsampled streams will need to be converted to 4:4:4 using a
       tool such as <b>y4mscaler</b>.

       If <b>y4mtopnm</b> is given a "444ALPHA" stream (4:4:4 video with an 8-bit alpha channel), the results depend on
       whether  or  not  the "-P" option is specified.  With "-P", it will produce PAM images with a TUPLTYPE of
       RGB_ALPHA, containing both color and alpha channel data.  Without "-P", it will produce pairs of PPM  and
       PGM images: a PPM for the color pixels followed by a PGM for the alpha channel data.  (Such a sequence of
       interspersed  PPM  and  PGM  images cannot be later re-processed by <b>pnmtoy4m</b>.  This feature is mostly for
       quick and easy stream debugging.)

       If multiple output images are generated, they are simply output one after another.  If you want  to  turn
       such  a  "multi-image"  stream/file  into  individual files, use <b>pnmsplit</b>.  (Some PNM filters can process
       multi-image files/streams; however, many written before June 2000 will only process the first image.)

       <b>y4mtopnm</b> and <b>pnmtoy4m</b> are inverses of each other; you can typically pipe  the  output  of  one  into  the
       other, and vice-versa (except for the "444ALPHA" case noted above and the "mixed-mode" case noted below).
       Note  that  the  colorspace  operations  can be lossy in both directions (due to range-compression and/or
       quantization).  And, when converting to PNM, information on interlacing and  sample  aspect  ratio  of  a
       stream is lost (but can be reconstructed by supplying command-line arguments to <b>pnmtoy4m</b>).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>y4mtopnm</b> accepts the following options:

       <b>-P</b>   Produce  PAM format output, instead of PPM and/or PGM.  PAM can encode a superset of PNM, but is not
            yet understood by as many graphics programs.  (Indeed, surprisingly few of the NetPBM tools seem  to
            understand it.)

       <b>-D</b>   Produce a separate output image for each field of each frame.  (Otherwise, a single image per frame,
            containing two interleaved fields, is created.)

            If  the  input  stream  is interlaced, the field-images are output in temporal order, i.e. the first
            image of a bottom-field-first stream will be the bottom-field.  If the stream is progressive or  has
            "mixed-mode"  interlacing,  then  the  temporal order is ambiguous, and the top-field will always be
            output first.

            Note that it will <u>not</u> be possible to later use <b>pnmtoy4m</b> to reconstruct a "mixed-mode" stream from  a
            sequence of PNM/PAM images.

       <b>-f</b>   Produce  a  special  'flattened'  output,  most useful for analyzing and debugging streams.  All the
            planes of a frame/field are tiled together into an enlarged PGM (or grayscale PAM) output  image  as
            follows:
                           +-----+                    +-----+
                   4:4:4   |  Y  |    4:4:4 w/alpha   |  Y  |
                           +-----+                    +-----+
                           |  Cb |                    |  Cb |
                           +-----+                    +-----+
                           |  Cr |                    |  Cr |
                           +-----+                    +-----+
                                                      |  A  |
                           +-----+                    +-----+
                   4:2:2,  |  Y  |
                   4:2:0   +--+--+                    +-----+--+--+
                           |Cb|Cr|            4:1:1   |  Y  |Cb|Cr|
                           +--+--+                    +-----+--+--+
                                        +-----+
                                 MONO   |  Y  |
                                        +-----+
            In this mode, any YUV4MPEG2 chroma format is accepted, but no upsampling or colorspace conversion is
            performed.   This is essentially just a reformatting/permutation of the original data from the input
            stream into a PGM image container.  All the other command-line  flags  continue  to  have  the  same
            effect on output.

       <b>-v</b> <u>[0,1,2]</u>
            Set verbosity level.
             0 = warnings and errors only.
             1 = add informative messages, too.
             2 = add chatty debugging message, too.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To turn the first 15 frames of an (MJPEG or DV) AVI file into individual PPM files:

            lav2yuv -f 15 your-video.avi | y4mscaler -O chromass=444 | y4mtopnm | pnmsplit - "your-video-%d.ppm"
