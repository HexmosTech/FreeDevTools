</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ssed - super sed stream editor version 3.61

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>sed</b> [<u>OPTION</u>]... <u>{script-only-if-no-other-script}</u> [<u>input-file</u>]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Sed</u> is a stream editor.  A stream editor is used to perform basic text transformations on an input stream
       (a  file or input from a pipeline).  While in some ways similar to an editor which permits scripted edits
       (such as <u>ed</u>), <u>sed</u> works by making only one pass over the input(s), and is  consequently  more  efficient.
       But it is <u>sed</u>'s ability to filter text in a pipeline which particularly distinguishes it from other types
       of editors.

       <b>-n</b>, <b>--quiet</b>, <b>--silent</b>

              suppress automatic printing of pattern space

       <b>-e</b> script, <b>--expression</b>=<u>script</u>

              add the script to the commands to be executed

       <b>-f</b> script-file, <b>--file</b>=<u>script-file</u>

              add the contents of script-file to the commands to be executed

       <b>-i[SUFFIX]</b>, <b>--in-place</b>[=<u>SUFFIX</u>]

              edit files in place (makes backup if extension supplied)

       <b>-l</b> N, <b>--line-length</b>=<u>N</u>

              specify the desired line-wrap length for the `l' command

       <b>--posix</b>

              disable all GNU extensions.

       <b>-r</b>, <b>--regexp-extended</b>

              use extended regular expressions in the script.

       <b>-R</b>, <b>--regexp-perl</b>

              use Perl 5's regular expressions syntax in the script.

       <b>-s</b>, <b>--separate</b>

              consider files as separate rather than as a single continuous long stream.

       <b>-u</b>, <b>--unbuffered</b>

              load minimal amounts of data from the input files and flush the output buffers more often

       <b>--help</b>
              display this help and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              output version information and exit

       If no <b>-e</b>, <b>--expression</b>, <b>-f</b>, or <b>--file</b> option is given, then the first non-option argument is taken as the
       sed  script  to  interpret.   All  remaining  arguments  are  names of input files; if no input files are
       specified, then the standard input is read.

       E-mail bug reports to: <a href="mailto:bonzini@gnu.org">bonzini@gnu.org</a> .   Be  sure  to  include  the  word  ``ssed''  somewhere  in  the
       ``Subject:'' field.

       based on GNU sed version 4.1

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       This is just a brief synopsis of <u>sed</u> commands to serve as a reminder to those who already know <u>sed</u>; other
       documentation (such as the texinfo document) must be consulted for fuller descriptions.

   <b>Zero-address</b> <b>``commands''</b>
       : <u>label</u>
              Label for <b>b</b> and <b>t</b> commands.

       #<u>comment</u>
              The comment extends until the next newline (or the end of a <b>-e</b> script fragment).

       }      The closing bracket of a { } block.

   <b>Zero-</b> <b>or</b> <b>One-</b> <b>address</b> <b>commands</b>
       =      Print the current line number.

       a \

       <u>text</u>   Append <u>text</u>, which has each embedded newline preceded by a backslash.

       i \

       <u>text</u>   Insert <u>text</u>, which has each embedded newline preceded by a backslash.

       q      Immediately  quit  the  <u>sed</u> script without processing any more input, except that if auto-print is
              not disabled the current pattern space will be printed.

       Q      Immediately quit the <u>sed</u> script without processing any more input.

       r <u>filename</u>
              Append text read from <u>filename</u>.

       R <u>filename</u>
              Append a line read from <u>filename</u>.

   <b>Commands</b> <b>which</b> <b>accept</b> <b>address</b> <b>ranges</b>
       {      Begin a block of commands (end with a }).

       b <u>label</u>
              Branch to <u>label</u>; if <u>label</u> is omitted, branch to end of script.

       t <u>label</u>
              If a s/// has done a successful substitution since the last input line was read and since the last
              t or T command, then branch to <u>label</u>; if <u>label</u> is omitted, branch to end of script.

       T <u>label</u>
              If no s/// has done a successful substitution since the last input line was  read  and  since  the
              last t or T command, then branch to <u>label</u>; if <u>label</u> is omitted, branch to end of script.

       c \

       <u>text</u>   Replace the selected lines with <u>text</u>, which has each embedded newline preceded by a backslash.

       d      Delete pattern space.  Start next cycle.

       D      Delete  up to the first embedded newline in the pattern space.  Start next cycle, but skip reading
              from the input if there is still data in the pattern space.

       h H    Copy/append pattern space to hold space.

       g G    Copy/append hold space to pattern space.

       x      Exchange the contents of the hold and pattern spaces.

       l      List out the current line in a ``visually unambiguous'' form.

       n N    Read/append the next line of input into the pattern space.

       p      Print the current pattern space.

       P      Print up to the first embedded newline of the current pattern space.

       s/<u>regexp</u>/<u>replacement</u>/
              Attempt to match <u>regexp</u> against the pattern space.  If successful, replace  that  portion  matched
              with <u>replacement</u>.  The <u>replacement</u> may contain the special character <b>&amp;</b> to refer to that portion of
              the  pattern  space  which  matched,  and  the  special  escapes  \1  through  \9  to refer to the
              corresponding matching sub-expressions in the <u>regexp</u>.

       w <u>filename</u>
              Write the current pattern space to <u>filename</u>.

       W <u>filename</u>
              Write the first line of the current pattern space to <u>filename</u>.

       y/<u>source</u>/<u>dest</u>/
              Transliterate the characters in the pattern space which appear  in  <u>source</u>  to  the  corresponding
              character in <u>dest</u>.

</pre><h4><b>Addresses</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Sed</u>  commands  can  be  given with no addresses, in which case the command will be executed for all input
       lines; with one address, in which case the command will only be executed for input lines which match that
       address; or with two addresses, in which case the command will be executed  for  all  input  lines  which
       match  the inclusive range of lines starting from the first address and continuing to the second address.
       Three things to note about address ranges: the syntax is <u>addr1</u>,<u>addr2</u> (i.e., the addresses  are  separated
       by a comma); the line which <u>addr1</u> matched will always be accepted, even if <u>addr2</u> selects an earlier line;
       and if <u>addr2</u> is a <u>regexp</u>, it will not be tested against the line that <u>addr1</u> matched.

       After  the address (or address-range), and before the command, a <b>!</b>  may be inserted, which specifies that
       the command shall only be executed if the address (or address-range) does <b>not</b> match.

       The following address types are supported:

       <u>number</u> Match only the specified line <u>number</u>.

       <u>first</u>~<u>step</u>
              Match every <u>step</u>'th line starting with line <u>first</u>.  For example, ``sed -n 1~2p''  will  print  all
              the  odd-numbered  lines  in  the  input  stream, and the address 2~5 will match every fifth line,
              starting with the second. (This is an extension.)

       $      Match the last line.

       /<u>regexp</u>/
              Match lines matching the regular expression <u>regexp</u>.

       \<b>c</b><u>regexp</u><b>c</b>
              Match lines matching the regular expression <u>regexp</u>.  The <b>c</b> may be any character.

       GNU <u>sed</u> also supports some special 2-address forms:

       0,<u>addr2</u>
              Start out in "matched first address" state, until <u>addr2</u> is found.  This  is  similar  to  1,<u>addr2</u>,
              except  that  if <u>addr2</u> matches the very first line of input the 0,<u>addr2</u> form will be at the end of
              its range, whereas the 1,<u>addr2</u> form will still be at the beginning of its range.

       <u>addr1</u>,+<u>N</u>
              Will match <u>addr1</u> and the <u>N</u> lines following <u>addr1</u>.

       <u>addr1</u>,~<u>N</u>
              Will match <u>addr1</u> and the lines following <u>addr1</u> until the next line whose input line  number  is  a
              multiple of <u>N</u>.

</pre><h4><b>REGULAR</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       POSIX.2  BREs  <u>should</u>  be  supported, but they aren't completely because of performance problems.  The <b>\n</b>
       sequence in a regular expression matches the newline character, and  similarly  for  <b>\a</b>,  <b>\t</b>,  and  other
       sequences.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       E-mail bug reports to <b><a href="mailto:bonzini@gnu.org">bonzini@gnu.org</a></b>.  Be sure to include the word ``sed'' somewhere in the ``Subject:''
       field.   Also,  please  include  the  output  of  ``sed  --version'' in the body of your report if at all
       possible.
