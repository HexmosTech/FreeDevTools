       wmlc - A basic WML compiler

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  a  basic  WML  compiler.  It  takes  the  WML  source  and compiles into WML bytecode ready for
       transmission to a WAP device.

       It is quite basic and has a lot of limitations, but things it can compile can be decompiled by  wmld  and
       vice versa.

       So  long  as  scripts  and  variables aren't involved, the pages compiled seem to work reasonably well in
       Nokia's WAP Toolkit and Ericsson's WAP SDK. It isn't most efficient, however, and the  bytecode  will  be
       larger than other compilers. Optimisation is Coming Soon(tm).

       In  order to compile bytecode in which simple scripts can work there needs to be a mechanism for building
       up the string table and also finding out  what  tag  is  appropriate  (other  compilers  use  WMLG_STR_T,
       WMLG_EXT_T_2  or WMLG_EXT_I_2 to specify that a variable is coming and I don't know which one to use - or
       even if it makes a difference)

       Usage: ./wmlc file.wml [output.wmlc]
