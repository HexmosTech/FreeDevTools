</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>swift-container-updater</b> - OpenStack Swift container updater

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>swift-container-updater</b> [CONFIG] [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose] [-o|--once]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The container updater is responsible for updating container information in the account database.  It will
       walk the container path in the system looking for container DBs and sending updates to the account server
       as needed as it goes along.

       There  are  times  when  account  data can not be immediately updated. This usually occurs during failure
       scenarios or periods of high load. This is where an eventual consistency window will most likely come  in
       to play.

       In  practice,  the consistency window is only as large as the frequency at which the updater runs and may
       not even be noticed as the proxy server will route listing requests to the  first  account  server  which
       responds.  The  server under load may not be the one that serves subsequent listing requests â€“ one of the
       other two replicas may handle the listing.

       The options are as follows:

           -v
           --verbose
               log to console
           -o
           --once
               only run one pass of daemon
