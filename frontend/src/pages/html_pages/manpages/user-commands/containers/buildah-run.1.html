</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       buildah-run - Run a command inside of the container.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>buildah</b> <b>run</b> [<u>options</u>] [<b>--</b>] <u>container</u> <u>command</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Launches  a  container  and  runs  the  specified  command  in  that container using the container's root
       filesystem as a root filesystem, using configuration settings inherited from the container's image or  as
       specified  using  previous  calls  to  the  <u>buildah</u>  <u>config</u>  command.   To  execute <u>buildah</u> <u>run</u> within an
       interactive shell, specify the --tty option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--add-history</b>

       Add an entry to the history which will note what command is being invoked.  Defaults to false.

       Note: You can also override the default value of --add-history by setting the BUILDAH_HISTORY environment
       variable. <b>export</b> <b>BUILDAH_HISTORY=true</b>

       <b>--cap-add</b>=<u>CAP_xxx</u>

       Add the specified capability to the set of capabilities which will be granted to the  specified  command.
       Certain  capabilities  are  granted  by default; this option can be used to add more beyond the defaults,
       which may have been modified by <b>--cap-add</b> and <b>--cap-drop</b> options used with the  <u>buildah</u>  <u>from</u>  invocation
       which created the container.

       <b>--cap-drop</b>=<u>CAP_xxx</u>

       Drop  the  specified  capability  from  the  set  of  capabilities which will be granted to the specified
       command.   The  CAP_CHOWN,  CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE,  CAP_FOWNER,  CAP_FSETID,  CAP_KILL,  CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE,
       CAP_SETFCAP, CAP_SETGID, CAP_SETPCAP, and CAP_SETUID capabilities are granted by default; this option can
       be  used  to  remove  them  from  the  defaults, which may have been modified by <b>--cap-add</b> and <b>--cap-drop</b>
       options used with the  <u>buildah</u>  <u>from</u>  invocation  which  created  the  container.  The  list  of  default
       capabilities is managed in <a href="../man5/containers.conf.5.html">containers.conf</a>(5).

       If a capability is specified to both the <b>--cap-add</b> and <b>--cap-drop</b> options, it will be dropped, regardless
       of the order in which the options were given.

       <b>--cgroupns</b> <u>how</u>

       Sets  the configuration for the cgroup namespaces for the container.  The configured value can be "" (the
       empty string) or "private" to indicate that a new cgroup namespace should be created, or it can be "host"
       to indicate that the cgroup namespace in which <b>buildah</b> itself is being run should be reused.

       <b>--contextdir</b> <u>directory</u>

       Allows setting context directory for current RUN invocation. Specifying a context  directory  causes  RUN
       context to consider context directory as root directory for specified source in <b>--mount</b> of type 'bind'.

       <b>--device</b>=<u>device</u>

       Add  a  host  device,  or devices under a directory, to the environment in which the command will be run.
       The optional <u>permissions</u> parameter can be used to specify device permissions, using any one or more of  <b>r</b>
       for read, <b>w</b> for write, and <b>m</b> for <b><a href="../man2/mknod.2.html">mknod</a></b>(2).

       Example: <b>--device=/dev/sdc:/dev/xvdc:rwm</b>.

       Note:  if  <u>host-device</u>  is a symbolic link then it will be resolved first.  The container will only store
       the major and minor numbers of the host device.

       The device to share can also  be  specified  using  a  Container  Device  Interface  (CDI)  specification
       (https://github.com/cncf-tags/container-device-interface).

       Note:  if  the  user  only  has  access  rights  via a group, accessing the device from inside a rootless
       container will fail. The <b><a href="../man1/crun.1.html">crun</a></b>(1) runtime offers a workaround for this by adding the  option  <b>--annotation</b>
       <b>run.oci.keep_original_groups=1</b>.

       <b>--env</b>, <b>-e</b> <u>env=value</u>

       Temporarily  add  a  value  (e.g.  env=<u>value</u>)  to the environment for the running process. Unlike <b>buildah</b>
       <b>config</b> <b>--env</b>, the environment will not persist to later calls to <b>buildah</b> <b>run</b> or to the built  image.  Can
       be used multiple times.

       <b>--hostname</b>

       Set the hostname inside of the running container.

       <b>--ipc</b> <u>how</u>

       Sets  the  configuration  for  the IPC namespaces for the container.  The configured value can be "" (the
       empty string) or "private" to indicate that a new IPC namespace should be created, or it can be "host" to
       indicate that the IPC namespace in which <b>buildah</b> itself is being run should be reused, or it can  be  the
       path to an IPC namespace which is already in use by another process.

       <b>--isolation</b> <u>type</u>

       Controls  what  type  of  isolation  is used for running the process.  Recognized types include <u>oci</u> (OCI-
       compatible  runtime,  the  default),  <u>rootless</u>  (OCI-compatible  runtime   invoked   using   a   modified
       configuration,  with  <u>--no-new-keyring</u> added to its <u>create</u> invocation, reusing the host's network and UTS
       namespaces, and creating private IPC, PID, mount, and  user  namespaces;  the  default  for  unprivileged
       users),  and  <u>chroot</u>  (an  internal  wrapper  that leans more toward <a href="../man1/chroot.1.html">chroot</a>(1) than container technology,
       reusing the host's control group, network, IPC, and PID namespaces, and creating private  mount  and  UTS
       namespaces, and creating user namespaces only when they're required for ID mapping).

       Note:  You  can  also  override  the  default isolation type by setting the BUILDAH_ISOLATION environment
       variable.  <b>export</b> <b>BUILDAH_ISOLATION=oci</b>

       <b>--mount</b>=<u>type=TYPE,TYPE-SPECIFIC-OPTION[,...]</u>

       Attach a filesystem mount to the container

       Current supported mount TYPES are bind, cache, secret and tmpfs. Writes to  <b>bind</b>  and  <b>tmpfs</b>  mounts  are
       discarded after the command finishes, while changes to <b>cache</b> mounts persist across uses.

          e.g.

          type=bind,source=/path/on/host,destination=/path/in/container

          type=tmpfs,tmpfs-size=512M,destination=/path/in/container

          type=cache,target=/path/in/container

          Common Options:

                 · src, source: mount source spec for bind and cache. Mandatory for bind. If `from` is specified, `src` is the subpath in the `from` field.

                 · dst, destination, target: location where the command being run should see the content being mounted.

                 · ro, read-only: (default true for `type=bind`, false for `type=tmpfs`, `type=cache`).

          Options specific to bind:

                 · bind-propagation: shared, slave, private, rshared, rslave, or rprivate(default). See also <a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount</a>(2). [[1]](#Footnote1)

                 . bind-nonrecursive: do not setup a recursive bind mount.  By default it is recursive.

                 · from: image name for the root of the source. Defaults to **--contextdir**, mandatory if **--contextdir** was not specified.

                 · z: Set shared SELinux label on mounted destination. Use if SELinux is enabled on host machine.

                 · Z: Set private SELinux label on mounted destination. Use if SELinux is enabled on host machine.

          Options specific to tmpfs:

                 · tmpfs-size: Size of the tmpfs mount in bytes. Unlimited by default in Linux.

                 · tmpfs-mode: File mode of the tmpfs in octal. (e.g. 700 or 0700.) Defaults to 1777 in Linux.

                 · tmpcopyup: Path that is shadowed by the tmpfs mount is recursively copied up to the tmpfs itself.

          Options specific to secret:

                 · id: the identifier for the secret passed into the `buildah bud --secret` or `podman build --secret` command.

          Options specific to cache:

                 · id: Distinguish this cache from other caches using this ID rather than the target mount path.

                 · mode: File mode for new cache directory in octal. Default 0755.

                 · ro, readonly: read only cache if set.

                 · uid: uid for cache directory.

                 · gid: gid for cache directory.

                 · from: stage name for the root of the source. Defaults to host cache directory.

                 · sharing: Whether other users of this cache need to wait for this command to complete (`sharing=locked`) or not (`sharing=shared`, which is the default).

                 · z: Set shared SELinux label on mounted destination. Enabled by default if SELinux is enabled on the host machine.

                 · Z: Set private SELinux label on mounted destination. Use if SELinux is enabled on host machine.

       <b>--network</b>, <b>--net</b>=<u>mode</u>

       Sets the configuration for the network namespace for the container.

       Valid <u>mode</u> values are:

              • <b>none</b>: no networking. Invalid if using <b>--dns</b>, <b>--dns-opt</b>, or <b>--dns-search</b>;

              • <b>host</b>:  use  the host network stack. Note: the host mode gives the container full access to local
                system services such as D-bus and is therefore considered insecure;

              • <b>ns:</b><u>path</u>: path to a network namespace to join;

              • <b>private</b>: create a new namespace for the container (default)

              • <b>&lt;network</b> <b>name|ID&gt;</b>: Join the network with the given name or ID, e.g. use <b>--network</b> <b>mynet</b> to  join
                the network with the name mynet. Only supported for rootful users.

              • <b>slirp4netns[:OPTIONS,...]</b>:  use  <b><a href="../man1/slirp4netns.1.html">slirp4netns</a></b>(1)  to  create  a  user  network stack. This is the
                default for rootless containers. It is possible to specify these additional  options,  they  can
                also be set with <b>network_cmd_options</b> in containers.conf:

                • <b>allow_host_loopback=true|false</b>:  Allow  slirp4netns  to reach the host loopback IP (default is
                  10.0.2.2 or the second IP from slirp4netns cidr subnet  when  changed,  see  the  cidr  option
                  below). The default is false.

                • <b>mtu=MTU</b>: Specify the MTU to use for this network. (Default is <b>65520</b>).

                • <b>cidr=CIDR</b>: Specify ip range to use for this network. (Default is <b>10.0.2.0/24</b>).

                • <b>enable_ipv6=true|false</b>: Enable IPv6. Default is true. (Required for <b>outbound_addr6</b>).

                • <b>outbound_addr=INTERFACE</b>: Specify the outbound interface slirp binds to (ipv4 traffic only).

                • <b>outbound_addr=IPv4</b>: Specify the outbound ipv4 address slirp binds to.

                • <b>outbound_addr6=INTERFACE</b>: Specify the outbound interface slirp binds to (ipv6 traffic only).

                • <b>outbound_addr6=IPv6</b>: Specify the outbound ipv6 address slirp binds to.

              • <b>pasta[:OPTIONS,...]</b>: use <b><a href="../man1/pasta.1.html">pasta</a></b>(1) to create a user-mode networking stack.
                This is only supported in rootless mode.
                By  default,  IPv4  and IPv6 addresses and routes, as well as the pod interface name, are copied
                from the host. If port forwarding isn't configured, ports are forwarded dynamically as  services
                are  bound on either side (init namespace or container namespace). Port forwarding preserves the
                original source IP address. Options described in <a href="../man1/pasta.1.html">pasta</a>(1) can be  specified  as  comma-separated
                arguments.
                In terms of <a href="../man1/pasta.1.html">pasta</a>(1) options, <b>--config-net</b> is given by default, in order to configure networking
                when  the  container  is  started,  and  <b>--no-map-gw</b> is also assumed by default, to avoid direct
                access from container to host using the gateway address. The latter can be overridden by passing
                <b>--map-gw</b> in the pasta-specific options (despite not being an actual <a href="../man1/pasta.1.html">pasta</a>(1) option).
                Also, <b>-t</b> <b>none</b> and <b>-u</b> <b>none</b> are passed to disable automatic port forwarding based on bound  ports.
                Similarly,  <b>-T</b>  <b>none</b>  and  <b>-U</b> <b>none</b> are given to disable the same functionality from container to
                host.
                Some examples:

                • <b>pasta:--map-gw</b>: Allow the container to directly reach the host using the gateway address.

                • <b>pasta:--mtu,1500</b>: Specify a 1500 bytes MTU for the <u>tap</u> interface in the container.

                • <b>pasta:--ipv4-only,-a,10.0.2.0,-n,24,-g,10.0.2.2,--dns-forward,10.0.2.3,-m,1500,--no-ndp,--no-</b>
                  <b>dhcpv6,--no-dhcp</b>,  equivalent  to  default  <a href="../man1/slirp4netns.1.html">slirp4netns</a>(1)  options:  disable   IPv6,   assign
                  <b>10.0.2.0/24</b>  to  the  <b>tap0</b>  interface  in  the  container,  with  gateway <b>10.0.2.3</b>, enable DNS
                  forwarder reachable at <b>10.0.2.3</b>, set MTU to 1500 bytes, disable NDP, DHCPv6 and DHCP support.

                • <b>pasta:-I,tap0,--ipv4-only,-a,10.0.2.0,-n,24,-g,10.0.2.2,--dns-forward,10.0.2.3,--no-ndp,--no-</b>
                  <b>dhcpv6,--no-dhcp</b>, equivalent to default <a href="../man1/slirp4netns.1.html">slirp4netns</a>(1) options with Podman overrides: same  as
                  above, but leave the MTU to 65520 bytes

                • <b>pasta:-t,auto,-u,auto,-T,auto,-U,auto</b>:  enable  automatic  port  forwarding  based on observed
                  bound ports from both host and container sides

                • <b>pasta:-T,5201</b>: enable forwarding of TCP port 5201 from container to host, using  the  loopback
                  interface instead of the tap interface for improved performance

       <b>--no-hostname</b>

       Do not create the <u><a href="file:/etc/hostname">/etc/hostname</a></u> file in the container for RUN instructions.

       By  default, Buildah manages the <u><a href="file:/etc/hostname">/etc/hostname</a></u> file, adding the container's own hostname.  When the <b>--no-</b>
       <b>hostname</b> option is set, the image's <u><a href="file:/etc/hostname">/etc/hostname</a></u> will be preserved unmodified if it exists.

       <b>--no-hosts</b>

       Do not create the <u><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></u> file in the container for RUN instructions.

       By default, Buildah manages <u><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></u>, adding the container's own IP address.  <b>--no-hosts</b> disables this,
       and the image's <u><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></u> will be preserved unmodified.

       <b>--no-pivot</b>

       Do not use pivot root to jail process inside rootfs. This should be used whenever the rootfs is on top of
       a ramdisk.

       Note: You can make this option the default by setting the BUILDAH_NOPIVOT environment  variable.   <b>export</b>
       <b>BUILDAH_NOPIVOT=true</b>

       <b>--pid</b> <u>how</u>

       Sets  the  configuration  for  the  PID namespace for the container.  The configured value can be "" (the
       empty string) or "private" to indicate that a new PID namespace should be created, or it can be "host" to
       indicate that the PID namespace in which <b>buildah</b> itself is being run should be reused, or it can  be  the
       path to a PID namespace which is already in use by another process.

       <b>--runtime</b> <u>path</u>

       The  <u>path</u>  to an alternate OCI-compatible runtime. Default is <b>runc</b>, or <b>crun</b> when machine is configured to
       use cgroups V2.

       Note: You can also override the default runtime by  setting  the  BUILDAH_RUNTIME  environment  variable.
       <b>export</b> <b>BUILDAH_RUNTIME=/usr/bin/crun</b>

       <b>--runtime-flag</b> <u>flag</u>

       Adds  global flags for the container runtime. To list the supported flags, please consult the manpages of
       the selected container runtime.  Note: Do not pass the leading <b>--</b> to the flag.  To  pass  the  runc  flag
       <b>--log-format</b> <b>json</b> to buildah run, the option given would be <b>--runtime-flag</b> <b>log-format=json</b>.

       <b>--tty</b>, <b>--terminal</b>, <b>-t</b>

       By  default  a  pseudo-TTY  is  allocated only when buildah's standard input is attached to a pseudo-TTY.
       Setting the <b>--tty</b> option to <b>true</b> will cause a pseudo-TTY to be allocated inside the container  connecting
       the  user's  "terminal"  with  the stdin and stdout stream of the container.  Setting the <b>--tty</b> option to
       <b>false</b> will prevent the pseudo-TTY from being allocated.

       <b>--user</b> <u>user</u>[:<u>group</u>]

       Set the <u>user</u> to be used for running the command in the container.  The user can be specified  as  a  user
       name  or UID, optionally followed by a group name or GID, separated by a colon (':').  If names are used,
       the container should include entries for those names in its <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u> and <u><a href="file:/etc/group">/etc/group</a></u> files.

       <b>--uts</b> <u>how</u>

       Sets the configuration for the UTS namespace for the container.  The configured  value  can  be  ""  (the
       empty string) or "private" to indicate that a new UTS namespace should be created, or it can be "host" to
       indicate  that  the UTS namespace in which <b>buildah</b> itself is being run should be reused, or it can be the
       path to a UTS namespace which is already in use by another process.

       <b>--volume</b>, <b>-v</b> <u>source</u>:<u>destination</u>:<u>options</u>

       Create a bind mount. If you specify, <b>-v</b> <b>/HOST-DIR:/CONTAINER-DIR</b>, Buildah bind mounts  <b>/HOST-DIR</b>  in  the
       host to <b>/CONTAINER-DIR</b> in the Buildah container. The <b>OPTIONS</b> are a comma delimited list and can be:

              • [rw|ro]

              • [U]

              • [z|Z]

              • [<b>[r]shared</b>|<b>[r]slave</b>|<b>[r]private</b>] [1] ⟨#Footnote1⟩

       The  <b>CONTAINER-DIR</b>  must  be an absolute path such as <b>/src/docs</b>. The <b>HOST-DIR</b> must be an absolute path as
       well. Buildah bind-mounts the <b>HOST-DIR</b> to the path you specify. For example, if you supply  <b>/foo</b>  as  the
       host  path,  Buildah  copies the contents of <b>/foo</b> to the container filesystem on the host and bind mounts
       that into the container.

       You can specify multiple  <b>-v</b> options to mount one or more mounts to a container.

       <b>Write</b> <b>Protected</b> <b>Volume</b> <b>Mounts</b>

       You can add the <b>:ro</b> or <b>:rw</b> suffix to a volume to mount it read-only or read-write mode, respectively.  By
       default, the volumes are mounted read-write.  See examples.

       <b>Chowning</b> <b>Volume</b> <b>Mounts</b>

       By  default,  Buildah  does  not  change  the  owner  and group of source volume directories mounted into
       containers. If a container is created in a new user namespace, the UID  and  GID  in  the  container  may
       correspond to another UID and GID on the host.

       The  <b>:U</b>  suffix  tells  Buildah  to  use the correct host UID and GID based on the UID and GID within the
       container, to change the owner and group of the source volume.

       <b>Labeling</b> <b>Volume</b> <b>Mounts</b>

       Labeling systems like SELinux require that proper labels are placed on  volume  content  mounted  into  a
       container.  Without a label, the security system might prevent the processes running inside the container
       from using the content. By default, Buildah does not change the labels set by the OS.

       To change a label in the container context, you can add either of two suffixes <b>:z</b> or  <b>:Z</b>  to  the  volume
       mount.  These  suffixes  tell  Buildah  to relabel file objects on the shared volumes. The <b>z</b> option tells
       Buildah that two containers share the volume content. As a result, Buildah  labels  the  content  with  a
       shared  content  label.  Shared  volume  labels allow all containers to read/write content.  The <b>Z</b> option
       tells Buildah to label the content with a private unshared label.  Only the current container can  use  a
       private volume.

       By  default  bind  mounted  volumes  are <b>private</b>. That means any mounts done inside container will not be
       visible on the host and vice versa. This behavior can be changed by specifying a volume mount propagation
       property.

       When the mount propagation policy is set to <b>shared</b>, any mounts completed inside  the  container  on  that
       volume will be visible to both the host and container. When the mount propagation policy is set to <b>slave</b>,
       one way mount propagation is enabled and any mounts completed on the host for that volume will be visible
       only  inside  of  the  container.   To  control  the  mount  propagation  property  of the volume use the
       <b>:[r]shared</b>, <b>:[r]slave</b> or <b>:[r]private</b> propagation flag. The propagation property can be specified only for
       bind mounted volumes and not for internal volumes or named volumes. For mount propagation to work on  the
       source  mount point (the mount point where source dir is mounted on) it has to have the right propagation
       properties. For shared volumes, the source mount point has to be  shared.  And  for  slave  volumes,  the
       source mount has to be either shared or slave. [1] ⟨#Footnote1⟩

       Use  <b>df</b>  <b>&lt;source-dir&gt;</b>  to  determine the source mount and then use <b>findmnt</b> <b>-o</b> <b>TARGET,PROPAGATION</b> <b>&lt;source-</b>
       <b>mount-dir&gt;</b> to determine propagation properties of source mount, if <b>findmnt</b> utility is not available,  the
       source  mount  point  can  be  determined  by looking at the mount entry in <b><a href="file:/proc/self/mountinfo">/proc/self/mountinfo</a></b>. Look at
       <b>optional</b> <b>fields</b> and see if any propagation properties are specified.  <b>shared:X</b> means the mount is <b>shared</b>,
       <b>master:X</b> means the mount is <b>slave</b> and  if  nothing  is  there  that  means  the  mount  is  <b>private</b>.  [1]
       ⟨#Footnote1⟩

       To  change  propagation properties of a mount point use the <b>mount</b> command. For example, to bind mount the
       source directory <b>/foo</b> do <b>mount</b> <b>--bind</b> <b>/foo</b> <b>/foo</b> and <b>mount</b> <b>--make-private</b> <b>--make-shared</b>  <b>/foo</b>.  This  will
       convert  /foo  into  a <b>shared</b> mount point.  The propagation properties of the source mount can be changed
       directly. For instance if <b>/</b> is the source mount for <b>/foo</b>, then use <b>mount</b> <b>--make-shared</b>  <b>/</b>  to  convert  <b>/</b>
       into a <b>shared</b> mount.

       <b>--workingdir</b> <u>directory</u>

       Temporarily  set  the  working <u>directory</u> for the running process. Unlike <b>buildah</b> <b>config</b> <b>--workingdir</b>, the
       workingdir will not persist to later calls to <b>buildah</b> <b>run</b> or the built image.

       NOTE: End parsing of options with the <b>--</b> option, so that other options  can  be  passed  to  the  command
       inside of the container.

</pre><h4><b>FOOTNOTES</b></h4><pre>
       1: The Buildah project is committed to inclusivity, a core value of open source.  The  <b>master</b>  and  <b>slave</b>
       mount  propagation  terminology  used  here  is problematic and divisive, and should be changed. However,
       these terms are currently used within the Linux kernel and must be used as-is  at  this  time.  When  the
       kernel maintainers rectify this usage, Buildah will follow suit immediately.
