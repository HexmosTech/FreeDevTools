</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cmus - C* Music Player

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       cmus [<b>options</b>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       cmus is a lightweight ncurses music player. It supports various output methods by using
       dynamically-loaded output plugins. cmus has configurable keybindings and can be controlled externally
       using <b><a href="../man1/cmus-remote.1.html">cmus-remote</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       --listen ADDR
              Listen on ADDR (UNIX socket) instead of <u>$CMUS_SOCKET</u> or <u>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cmus-socket</u>. ADDR must be
              a UNIX socket or host[:port].

              <b>WARNING</b>: Using host[:port] is insecure even with a password! It may be on a LAN if you want
              multiple users to be able to control cmus. Never expose cmus to the internet.

              NOTE: Don't use this option to run multiple instances as the same user. Doing so would corrupt the
              track metadata cache.

       --passwd PASSWD
              Set the password for TCP/IP connections. Required if listening on host[:port]. Used in conjunction
              with --listen.

       --plugins
              List available plugins and exit.

       --show-cursor
              Always display the cursor. This is useful for screen readers.

       --help
              Display usage information and exit.

       --version
              Display version information and exit.

</pre><h4><b>VIEWS</b></h4><pre>
       There are 7 views in cmus. Press keys 1-7 to change active view.

       Library view (1)
              Displays all tracks in the <b>library</b>. Tracks are sorted and displayed in a tree grouped by
              artist/album. Artist sorting is done alphabetically. Albums are sorted by year.

       Sorted library view (2)
              Displays the same content as view 1, but as a simple list automatically sorted by user criteria.

       Playlist view (3)
              Displays editable playlists with optional sorting.

       Play Queue view (4)
              Displays upcoming tracks. These tracks are played before anything else (i.e. the playlist or
              library). Once the queue is empty, playback will resume from the last position in the library.

       Browser (5)
              Displays the directory browser. In this view, music from the filesystem can be added to the
              library, active playlist, or queue.

       Filters view (6)
              Lists user-defined filters.

       Settings view (7)
              Lists keybindings, unbound commands and options. Remove bindings with <b>D</b> or <b>del</b>, change bindings
              and variables with <b>enter</b>, and toggle variables with <b>space</b>.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE</b></h4><pre>
       Everything in cmus is implemented as commands which can be typed at the command line or bound to a key.
       To enter command mode type <b>:</b>. To execute a command, press <b>ENTER</b>, and to cancel, press <b>ESC</b> or <b>CTRL-C</b>. Use
       up/down arrows to browse the command history. Use <b>TAB</b> to complete commands and parameters. You don't need
       to type the full command name if it is unambiguous (no other commands starting with the same characters).

       Examples:

              # add files, short for ':add <a href="file:~/music">~/music</a>'
              :a <a href="file:~/music">~/music</a>

              # change output plugin
              :set output_plugin=oss

              # start playing
              # you could just press 'x' which is the default
              # binding for this command
              :player-play

              # clear current view (library, playlist or play queue)
              :clear

</pre><h4><b>SEARCHING</b></h4><pre>
       Search mode works like the command mode. To enter search mode, press <b>/</b> and type the query then press
       <b>ENTER</b>. Press <b>n</b> to move to the next result or <b>N</b> for the previous one. Type <b>?</b> to search backwards.

       In views 1-4 the query is matched against the artist, album and title tags. Type <b>//WORDS</b> or <b>??WORDS</b> to
       search only artists/albums in view 1 and only titles in views 2-4. If the file doesn't have tags, words
       are compared to the filename excluding the path.

       Searching also works in views 5-7.

</pre><h4><b>PLAYLIST</b> <b>EDITING</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Selecting</b> <b>Tracks</b>
       Editing commands affect the currently marked tracks. If there are no marked tracks, the currently
       selected track (or selected artist/album in view 1) is used.

       To mark the selected track, press <b>SPACE</b>. Marked tracks appear with a gray background. You can only mark
       tracks in the list views (2-4).

   <b>Copying</b> <b>Tracks</b> <b>Between</b> <b>Views</b>
       You can copy marked or selected tracks in views 1-5.

       <b>a</b>      copy tracks to the library (1-2)

       <b>y</b>      copy tracks to the marked playlist (3)

       <b>e</b>      append tracks to the play queue (4)

       <b>E</b>      prepend tracks to the play queue (4)

   <b>Moving</b> <b>Tracks</b>
       In  views  2-4,  tracks  can  be  moved  within  the  list.  Note  that moving is disabled if the view is
       auto-sorted (see <b>lib_sort</b> and <b>pl_sort</b> options).

       Pressing <b>p</b> moves marked tracks to the position immediately after the selected track. <b>P</b> moves them to  the
       position  immediately  before  the  selected  track. If there are no marked tracks, the selected track is
       moved down (<b>p</b>) or up (<b>P</b>).

       Note that changing active filters in view 2 reloads it, losing any changes made to the track order.

   <b>Removing</b> <b>Tracks</b>
       Press <b>D</b> or <b>delete</b> to remove the marked or selected tracks in the current view (1-4). The tracks  will  be
       removed  immediately from the view without asking for confirmation. In the browser and filters views, the
       same keys are used to remove a file or filter after asking for confirmation.

</pre><h4><b>STATUS</b> <b>LINE</b></h4><pre>
       The right hand side of the status line (second row from the bottom, black  text  on  a  grey  background)
       consists of the following fields:

       aaa_mode &amp; play_sorted &amp; play_library | continue follow repeat shuffle

       NOTE:  <b>aaa_mode</b>  and  <b>play_sorted</b>  will  be  only  displayed  if  <b>play_library</b>  is <b>true</b> because these are
       meaningless when playing the playlists (view 3).

       Pressing <b>m</b>, <b>o</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>r</b> and <b>s</b> should make it easier to understand what these fields mean.

       See the CONFIGURATION OPTIONS section for more information about these options.

</pre><h4><b>KEYBINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Here's list of default keybindings. To change them, see the <b>unbind</b> and  <b>bind</b>  commands  in  the  COMMANDS
       section.

</pre><h4><b>LIBRARY</b> <b>VIEW</b> <b>SORTING</b></h4><pre>
       The library view (the tree-like one; not the sorted library view, which is configured with lib_sort - see
       <u>CONFIGURATION</u> <u>OPTIONS</u>), is sorted automatically using tags from the audio files.

       Note:  Albums  which feature various artists (e.g. samplers or compilations) are treated specially. If an
       album artist tag or the ID3v2 <b>TPE2</b> frame is set, it will  be  used  instead  of  the  real  artist  name.
       Otherwise,  cmus  determines  if  the album is a compilation (if <b>albumartist</b> or <b>artist</b> are set to <b>Various</b>
       <b>Artists</b>, <b>Various</b>, <b>VA</b>, or <b>V/A</b>; or if <b>compilation</b> or <b>partofacompilation</b> are set to a truthy  value;  or  if
       the ID3v2 <b>TCMP</b> frame is set). If so, the artist is named <b>&lt;Various</b> <b>Artists&gt;</b>.

       Note: If the filename is a URL, the artist/album tags are set to <b>&lt;Stream&gt;</b>. If it is a file, cmus sets the
       artist  and/or  album tags to <b>&lt;No</b> <b>Name&gt;</b> if they are not already set. These names will be treated the same
       way as other names for sorting.

       In general, three levels of sorting are used in the library view: the artist name, then  the  album,  and
       finally the track itself.

       First, cmus sorts alphanumerically by the value of the artist tag. If a special sorting tag is available,
       its value will be used instead.

       Next,  cmus  sorts  by  the album. Tracks are grouped by the album name, and the groups are sorted by the
       date of the first track, then alphanumerically by the name of the album. If the date header is  not  set,
       the album will be placed on top of the list.

       Finally, each album is sorted by the track <b>discnumber</b>, <b>tracknumber</b>, then filename (not the track name).

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       This  section describes cmus' commands, which can be bound to keys and mouse events, put in configuration
       files, executed in command mode, or passed to cmus-remote.

       Optional parameters are in [brackets], required parameters in &lt;angle brackets&gt; and default  key  bindings
       are (parenthesized).

       add [-l] [-p] [-q] [-Q] &lt;file|dir|url|playlist&gt;
              Adds file/dir/url/playlist to the specified view or the current view.

              -l     add to library

              -p     add to playlist

              -q     add play queue

              -Q     prepend to play queue

              Supported files are based on the loaded input plugins.

              Supported URLs: Shoutcast (<u>http://</u>...), CDDA (<u>cdda://</u>...).

              Supported playlist types: plain, .m3u, .pls.

       bind [-f] &lt;context&gt; &lt;key&gt; &lt;command&gt;
              Adds a key binding.

              -f     overwrite existing binding

              Valid  contexts:  common  (i.e.  all  views), library (1-2), playlist (3), queue (4), browser (5),
              filters (6)

              There's one context for each view. Common is a special context on which bound keys work  in  every
              view.

              You  can  override  specific  keys in common context for a view. For example <b>i</b> selects the current
              track in views 1-3 but in browser it is overridden to toggle showing of hidden files.

              When setting custom bindings in <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cmus/rc</u>, it is recommended to use the -f  option,
              or else bind may fail due to an existing binding in the autosave or system-level config files.

              Hint: You can press <b>tab</b> from command mode to expand contexts, keys, and commands.

       browser-up (<b>backspace</b>)
              Navigates  the browser view to the parent directory (5). This command only makes sense to be bound
              to the <b>browser</b> key context although it's possible to use this even if browser view is not active.

       cd [directory]
              Changes the current working directory. Also changes the directory displayed in the browser view.

       clear [-l] [-p] [-q]
              Removes all tracks from a single view.

              -l     clear library

              -p     clear playlist

              -q     clear play queue

              If a view is not specified, the current view is used.

       colorscheme &lt;name&gt;
              Changes the color scheme. Color schemes are found in  <u>/usr/share/cmus/</u>  or  <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cmus/</u>
              and have the extension <b>.theme</b>.

       echo &lt;arg&gt;...
              Displays the arguments on the command line.

              <b>{}</b> it is replaced with file name of the first selected track.

       factivate &lt;user-defined-filter&gt;...
              Selects and activates the given user defined filters (displayed in the filters view). Filter names
              are  separated  by  spaces.  This  command  is  mostly useful when bound to a key to change active
              filters quickly. If no arguments are provided, all filters are deactivated.

              Prefix a filter name with <b>!</b> to negate it.

       filter &lt;filter-expression&gt;

       smart_artist_sort (true)
              If enabled, makes the tree view sorting ignore "The" in front of artist names, preventing  artists
              starting with "The" from clumping together. Real <u>artistsort</u> tags override this option, if present.

       sort_albums_by_name (false)
              In tree view (1), albums will be sorted by name rather than date.

           Supported output plugins: pulse.

       pl_env_vars
              Comma separated list of environment variables to substitute when  saving  library/playlist  files.
              The paths must be absolute to take effect. See <u>Library</u> <u>Environment</u> <u>Variables</u>.

              Note: This option will not take full effect until cmus has been restarted.

       pl_sort () [<u>Sort</u> <u>Keys</u>]
              Sort  keys  for  the  playlist  view (3). Empty value disables sorting and enables manually moving
              tracks.

       play_library (true)
              Play tracks from the library instead of playlist.

       play_sorted (false)
              Play tracks from the library in the sorted view (2) order instead of tree  view  (1)  order.  Used
              only when play_library is true.

              Repeat after all tracks played.

       repeat_current (false)
              Repeat current track forever.

       replaygain (disabled) [track, album, track-preferred, album-preferred, smart]
              Enable  Replay  Gain.  The  smart  setting behaves like track-preferred when shuffle is on, or the
              queue is active, or when playing from a playlist. Otherwise, it behaves like album-preferred.

       replaygain_limit (true)
              Use replay gain limiting when clipping.

       replaygain_preamp (0.0)
              Replay gain preamplification in decibels.

       rewind_offset (5) [-1-9999]
              If the position of the current track is smaller  than  rewind_offset,  player_prev  jumps  to  the
              previous  track.  Otherwise,  player_prev  jumps  to  the  beginning  of  the  current  track.  If
              rewind_offset=-1, player_prev always jumps to the previous track.

       scroll_offset (2) [0-9999]
              Minimal number of screen lines to keep above and below the cursor.

       show_all_tracks (true)
              Display all tracks of the artist when the artist is selected in the  tree  view.  This  option  is
              tightly   coupled   to   the  auto_expand_albums_\  options.  "show_all_tracks  =  false"  implies
              "auto_expand_albums_* = true".

       show_hidden (false)
              Display hidden files in browser.

       show_current_bitrate (false)
              Display current bitrate in the status lines.

       show_playback_position (true)
              Display elapsed (or remaining) time in the status line. Can be disabled to e.g. not trigger tmux's
              activity monitor.

       show_remaining_time (false)
              Display remaining time instead of elapsed time.

       shuffle (off) [off, tracks, albums]

              <b>off</b>    Play all tracks in order. See also <b>lib_sort</b> and <b>pl_sort</b>.

              <b>tracks</b> Play all tracks in the library or playlist in a shuffled order.

              <b>albums</b> Play each library album to completion before  shuffling  to  the  first  track  of  another
                     library album. In playlists this option falls back to <b>tracks</b> behaviour.

              Filters  and  <b>aaa_mode</b> can be used to limit the items available for play. Note that <b>shuffle</b>=<u>albums</u>
              will have no effect with <b>aaa_mode</b>=<u>album</u>.

       skip_track_info (false)
              Don't load metadata when adding tracks. Useful when using network  file  system  and  having  huge
              amount of files. Tags can be loaded using 'update-cache' or 'win-update-cache' commands.

       softvol (false)
              Use software volume control.

              Note: You should probably set this to false when using <b>ao</b> as <b>output_plugin</b> to output to wav files.

       softvol_state (100 100)
              Used  to  save  left  and  right channel values for software volume control. Two integers in range
              0..100 separated by a space. This option is not usually changed directly since  <b>vol</b>  command  does
              same thing if <b>softvol</b> is true.

       start_view (tree) [tree, sorted, playlist, queue, browser, filters, settings]
              Specify the view that gets shown when cmus starts.

       status_display_program () [command]
              This  command, if set, is run for every status change. It can be used to display currently playing
              track      on      desktop      background       or       panel       for       example.       See
              <u>/usr/share/doc/cmus/examples/cmus-status-display</u>.

       stop_after_queue (false)
              Stop playback when end of play queue is reached.

       time_show_leading_zero (true)
              Pad durations of less than 10 minutes with a leading 0.

       tree_width_percent (33) [1-100]
              Percentage of the window width to use for left pane.

       tree_width_max (0) [0-9999]
              Restrict the size calculated from tree_width_percent. 0 disables this option.

              This affects the tree in the library view and the playlist list in the playlist view.

              Note that this value will be further constrained by the window width and/or the minimum tree size.

              For example, to set a fixed size of 60 columns:

                     set tree_width_percent=100
                     set tree_width_max=60

              Or, to be 33% wide, but at most 60 columns

                     set tree_width_percent=33
                     set tree_width_max=60

              Or, to always be 33% wide where possible (the default behavior):

                     set tree_width_percent=33
                     set tree_width_max=0

       wrap_search (true)
              Controls whether the search wraps around the end.

   <b>Colors</b>
       Color is an integer in range -1..255.

       The following color names are recognized:

       Terminal's default color, -1
              default

       Fg &amp; bg, 0..7
              black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, gray

       Fg, 8..15
              darkgray, lightred, lightgreen, lightyellow, lightblue, lightmagenta, lightcyan, white

   <b>Attributes</b>
       Attributes is a set of names "standout|bold":

       <u>default</u> does nothing, if you put it with other attributes the other attributes will be used.

       <u>standout</u> makes the text standout.

       <u>bold</u> makes the text bold.

       <u>reverse</u> reverses the text colors.

       <u>underline</u> underlines the text.

       <u>italic</u> makes the text italic (not supported on all ncurses versions).

       <u>blink</u> makes the text blink.

   <b>Format</b> <b>Strings</b>
       Format strings control display of tracks in library, playlist and play queue views.

       Note: <b>altformat_*</b> options are used when there are no tags available.

       Special Keys:

              %a  %{artist}
              %A  %{albumartist}
              %l  %{album}
              %D  %{discnumber}
              %T  %{totaldiscs}
              %n  %{tracknumber}
              %X  %{play_count}
              %t  %{title}
              %g  %{genre}
              %c  %{comment}
              %y  %{date}
              %d  %{duration}
              %f  %{path}
              %F  %{filename}
                  %{albumduration}

                  %{bitrate}
                  %{codec}
                  %{codec_profile}
                  %{rg_track_gain}
                  %{rg_track_peak}
                  %{rg_album_gain}
                  %{rg_album_peak}

                  %{label}
                  %{publisher}
                  %{work}
                  %{opus}
                  %{partnumber}
                  %{part}
                  %{subtitle}
                  %{media}
              %!
                     prior text is of lower importance and may be shortened if needed (use at most once)
              %=
                     start align right (use at most once)
              %%

              %?
                     literal <b>?</b>

       You  can  use  printf style formatting (width, alignment, padding). As an extension, the width can have a
       %-suffix, to specify a percentage of the terminal width.
       To see current value of an option type <b>:set</b> <b>option=&lt;TAB&gt;</b>.

       Note: With %{bitrate}, you'll have to append the unit yourself, as mentioned in the example below.

       You can use conditional operator <b>%{?CONDITION?A[?B]}</b>. CONDITION has the same syntax  as  <u>filters</u>,  except
       for unsupported short and simple expressions and supported keys comparison (e.g. artist=albumartist). Its
       keys are:
              format strings' special keys
              configuration options
              keyword <b>stream</b> [boolean] (returns true if track is a stream)
              keyword <b>va</b> [boolean] (returns true if track's album is compilation)
       Else part can be skipped. A and B can contain string literals in <b>"</b> or <b>'</b>. A and B can be empty.

       Examples:

              :set format_trackwin= %02n. %t %{?y?(%y)}%= %d
              :set format_current= %n. %-30t %40F (%y)%= %d
              :set format_current= %a - %l%! - %02n. %t%= %{bitrate}Kbps %g %y
              :set format_playlist= %f%= %6{rg_track_gain} dB  %8{rg_track_peak}
              :set format_playlist= %-25%a %-15%l %3n. %t%= %y %d

   <b>Sort</b> <b>Keys</b>
       Sort option (lib_sort, pl_sort) value is space separated list of the following sort keys:

              artist,  album,  title,  tracknumber,  play_count, discnumber, date, originaldate, genre, comment,
              albumartist, filename,  filemtime,  bpm,  bitrate,  codec,  media,  codec_profile,  rg_track_gain,
              rg_track_peak, rg_album_gain, rg_album_peak

       Note: Adding a '-' in front of the key will reverse the sort order.

</pre><h4><b>PLUGIN</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       dsp.alsa.device
              PCM device for ALSA plugin, usually "default".

       mixer.alsa.channel
              Mixer  channel for ALSA Plugin, usually "pcm", "master" or "headphone". To see all possible values
              run "alsamixer" or "amixer".

       mixer.alsa.device
              Mixer device for ALSA plugin, usually "default".

       mixer.pulse.restore_volume
              Restore the volume at startup using PulseAudio. Otherwise, cmus sets the  volume  to  100%,  which
              does not mix well with "flat volumes" feature of PA. Defaults to "1"; set to "0" to turn off.

       dsp.ao.buffer_size
              The  audio  buffer size; defaults to 16kB, but you may want to try bigger values if you experience
              buffer under-runs.

       dsp.ao.device_interface
              Device interface for libao plugin to request a specific  playback  device/sink/output.  This  name
              will be in a format determined by the specific driver backend.

       dsp.ao.driver
              Output  driver  for  libao  plugin. Example values: "alsa09", "esd", "irix", "oss", "sun", "aixs",
              "wav".

              Note: of the file output drivers only "wav" is supported.

       dsp.ao.wav_counter
              Counter used for making filename. Used only if <b>dsp.ao.driver</b> is "wav". For example if  this  is  1
              and <b>dsp.ao.wav_dir</b> is "/home/user" then PCM data is outputted to "/home/user/01.wav". This counter
              is incremented every time playback is stopped.

              Note:  You  probably  want  to  set <b>continue</b> to <b>false</b> (press <b>C</b>), otherwise playback is not stopped
              between tracks and all PCM data is outputted to one wav file (useful if you want to join  files).c
              Also unsetting shuffle and repeat might be good idea.

       dsp.ao.wav_dir
              Output  directory  for  libao plugin; default to the home directory. Used only if <b>dsp.ao.driver</b> is
              "wav".

       dsp.coreaudio.device
              Device for Core Audio output. Leave empty for default.

       dsp.coreaudio.enable_hog_mode
              Set hog mode for the device. The default value is false.

       dsp.coreaudio.sync_sample_rate
              Synchronize the device sample rate with the player, so no interpolation will  be  applied  to  the
              stream.

       dsp.jack.server_name
              Connect to jackd with this name. Leave empty for default.

       dsp.jack.resampling_quality
              The  re-sampling  quality.  0  is  low  quality but fast, 1 is medium quality, 2 (default) is high
              quality but more CPU  intensive.  This  option  is  only  available  if  cmus  was  compiled  with
              libsamplerate support.

       input.cdio.cddb_url
              CDDB   URL  (default:  freedb.freedb.org:8880).  Uses  HTTP  if  prefixed  with  "http://"  (e.g.:
              <a href="http://freedb.musicbrainz.org">http://freedb.musicbrainz.org</a>:80/~cddb/cddb.cgi). Set to an empty string to  disable  CDDB  lookup
              completely.

       input.*.priority
              Sets  the  priority  of the input plugin. If multiple plugins can play a file, the plugin with the
              higher priority is chosen. If the priority is 0, the plugin is disabled.

       dsp.oss.device
              PCM device for OSS plugin, usually /dev/dsp.

       mixer.oss.channel
              Mixer channel for OSS Plugin, "pcm" or "master".

       mixer.oss.device
              Mixer device for OSS plugin, usually /dev/mixer.

       dsp.roar.server
              Address of RoarAudio server. Defaults to internal defaults. Can be UNIX, TCP/IP or DECnet address.

       dsp.roar.role [music, background_music, ...]
              Role for stream. May be used by the server to apply additional defaults.

       dsp.sun.device
              PCM device for Sun plugin, usually /dev/audio.

       mixer.sun.channel
              Mixer channel for Sun Plugin, usually "master".

       mixer.sun.device
              Mixer device for Sun plugin, usually /dev/mixer.

</pre><h4><b>PLAYING</b> <b>AUDIO</b> <b>DISCS</b></h4><pre>
       If the <b>cdio</b> input plugin is enabled, CDs and CD images can be played by setting the <b>device</b>  option  to  a
       device  file (e.g. /dev/cdrom) or an image file (e.g. <a href="file:~/cd.cue">~/cd.cue</a>). Then, add a new track using the CDDA URL
       scheme:

              :add cdda://2

       To add the entire disc, use cdda:// (without track number). This only works for audio discs, not  images.
       Adding track ranges is also possible (cdda://1-3).

       To add images without changing the device option, include the image path in the URL:

              :add cdda:///path/to/cd.cue/2-5

       The  metadata  will  be  read  from  CD-Text,  and  if  not  available, looked up from a CDDB server (see
       <b>input.cdio.cddb_url</b>).

</pre><h4><b>FILTERS</b></h4><pre>
       Filters are used mostly for filtering contents of library views (1 &amp; 2). Filters do not change the actual
       library content, i.e. the <b>:save</b> command will still save all tracks to  playlist  file  whether  they  are
       visible or not.

   <b>Types</b>
       There are three types of filter expressions, each offering more expressiveness:

              <b>simple</b> <u>e.g.</u> beatles

              <b>short</b>  <u>e.g.</u> ~a beatles (!~y1960-1965 | ~d&gt;600)

              <b>long</b>   <u>e.g.</u> artist="*beatles*"&amp;album="R*"

       Simple  expressions  are  only  available  using  <b>live-filter</b>.  For  other  filter  commands  the type is
       auto-detected, so both short and long expressions can be used.

       Long expressions are lists of built-in filters or user defined filters separated with <b>&amp;</b> (and) or <b>|</b>  (or).
       Parenthesises  can  be used group subexpressions and <b>!</b> negates result of the expression following it. The
       same is true for short expressions, but they can only consist of built-in filters.  Also,  (and)-grouping
       is done implicitly.

   <b>Strings</b>
       long   <b>filename</b>, <b>artist</b>, <b>albumartist</b>, <b>album</b>, <b>title</b>, <b>genre</b>, <b>comment</b>, <b>codec</b>, <b>codec_profile</b>, <b>media</b>
              Comparators: <b>=</b> and <b>!=</b> (not equal)

       short  <b>~f</b>, <b>~a</b>, <b>~A</b>, <b>~l</b>, <b>~t</b>, <b>~g</b>, <b>~c</b>
              Comparators: none

   <b>Integers</b>
       long   <b>discnumber</b>, <b>tracknumber</b>, <b>date</b> (year), <b>originaldate</b> (year), <b>duration</b> (seconds), <b>bitrate</b>
              Comparators: <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&lt;=</b>, <b>=</b>, <b>&gt;=</b>, <b>&gt;</b>, <b>!=</b>

       short  <b>~D</b>, <b>~n</b>, <b>~y</b>, <b>~d</b>
              Comparators: <b>&lt;</b>, <b>&gt;</b>
              Ranges: <b>a-b</b> (&gt;=a&amp;&lt;=b), <b>-b</b> (&lt;=b), <b>a-</b> (&gt;=a)

   <b>Booleans</b>
       <b>tag</b> (true if track has tags), <b>stream</b> (true if track is a stream)
       For short expressions: <b>~T</b> and <b>~s</b>

   <b>Defining</b> <b>Filters</b>
       Filters can be defined with the <b>fset</b> command. User defined filters appear in the filters view (6).

       Create a new filter which name is <b>ogg</b> and value <b>filename="*.ogg"</b>
              :fset ogg=filename="*.ogg"

       Filter ogg and mp3 files from the 90s. Note the use of user defined filter <b>ogg</b>.
              :fset 90s-ogg-mp3=date&gt;=1990&amp;date&lt;2000&amp;(ogg|filename="*.mp3")

   <b>Activating</b> <b>Filters</b>
       <b>factivate</b> changes the visible contents of the library (views 1-2).

       Activate user defined filters <b>ogg</b> and <b>missing-tags</b>
              :factivate ogg missing-tags

       Like above but negate value of <b>ogg</b> filter.
              :factivate !ogg missing-tags

       Alternatively, you can filters by pressing <b>space</b> in view 6, then activate them by pressing <b>enter</b>.

   <b>Throw-away</b> <b>Filters</b>
       The  <b>live-filter</b>  and  <b>filter</b>  commands  are  useful  when you want to use a filter without saving it. It
       changes the visible contents of the library (views 1-2). <b>filter</b> unactivates all filters  in  the  filters
       view, while <b>live-filter</b> is applied in addition to all currently activated filters. It persists even after
       leaving command mode.

       Filter all rock (anything with <b>rock</b> in genre tag) music from 80s-
              :filter date&gt;=1980&amp;genre="*rock*"
              :filter ~y1980-~grock

       Filter all artists/albums/titles containing "sleepwalking"
              :live-filter sleepwalking

   <b>Selecting</b> <b>Tracks</b> <b>Matching</b> <b>a</b> <b>Filter</b>
       Mark (select) all tracks with duration less than 2 minutes
              :mark duration&lt;120

       Mark (select) all tracks which have been played at least once
              :mark play_count&gt;=1

       These commands work in views 2-4.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       cmus reads its configuration from 3 different places in the following order:

       <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cmus/autosave</u>
              This  file  is automatically created and overwritten by cmus on exit, so it should not be modified
              by hand.

       <u>/usr/share/cmus/rc</u>
              This file contains the default configuration.

              If the autosave file did exist, this file is read instead.

       <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cmus/rc</u>
              This file is the static configuration file.

              This file is read immediately after the autosave file, and is never  modified  by  cmus.  You  can
              override  auto-saved  settings  in  this file. This file is not limited to options; it can contain
              other commands too.

   <b>Color</b> <b>Schemes</b>
       Color schemes (*.theme) are located in <u>/usr/share/cmus</u> or  <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cmus</u>.  You  can  switch  them
       using the <b>:colorscheme</b> command with the basename of the theme file.

       Note:  Colors  are  not  automatically  updated  when  the theme file changes since they are saved in the
       autosave file.

   <b>Examples</b>
       Example status display scripts (see <b>status_display_program</b>) can be found in <u>/usr/share/doc/cmus/examples</u>.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       CMUS_CHARSET
              Override the character set used by cmus (default: `locale charmap`).

       CMUS_HOME
              Override the config directory (default: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cmus).

       CMUS_SOCKET
              Override the socket path (default: $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cmus-socket).

       HOME
              Full path of the user's home directory.

       http_proxy
              URI of the proxy to use for HTTP requests.

       USER
              Name of the user running cmus.

       USERNAME
              Fallback for <b>USER</b>.

   <b>Library</b> <b>Environment</b> <b>Variables</b>
       cmus supports using environment variables to allow the library, cache, and playlists to be  relocated  or
       synced.  The environment variables to use are specified using the <u>pl_env_vars</u> configuration option, which
       takes effect when exiting cmus.

       A good starting point is <u>:set</u> <u>pl_env_vars=HOME</u>. This will allow the <u>.cmus</u> directory to be shared  between
       devices or users. Additional environment variables can be appended (delimited with commas) to <u>pl_env_vars</u>
       to  redirect  specific  paths. The environment variables must contain absolute paths to be used. The last
       matching directory prefix will be used.

       If a file does not exist, it will be treated the same way as missing files usually are. If the file is in
       the cache, it will be preserved, and an error will be displayed upon playback. If the file is not in  the
       cache,  it  will  be removed from playlists and the library. There is one special exception: if a file is
       missing due to the environment variable being invalid/empty/unset, but it is still in the cache, it  will
       be preserved in the cache as-is, in addition to being preserved in the library like usual.

       When  using  <u>:save</u>/<u>:load</u>  and  in  the on-disk library/cache/playlists, the paths will be stored with the
       environment variable delimited using the character <u>\x1F</u>, which is the invisible ASCII unit separator.

       This feature can also be used to quickly move a library to a  different  location  while  preserving  all
       metadata,  playlists, and the play counts. To do this, set an environment variable for each base path you
       want to change, set  <u>pl_env_vars</u>  to  the  list  of  environment  variables,  restart  cmus,  change  the
       environment variables, restart cmus, unset <u>pl_env_vars</u>, then restart cmus again.

       If a library using <u>pl_env_vars</u> is opened with a version of cmus not supporting it, tracks referenced with
       environment  variables  will  be forgotten. To restore the on-disk files to be compatible with older cmus
       versions, just unset <u>pl_env_vars</u>, and  restart  cmus.  This  will  restore  the  paths  for  all  defined
       environment variables to their actual path.

       It is safe to change <u>pl_env_vars</u> from outside cmus since this variable is applied when cmus exits.

</pre><h4><b>D-Bus</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>(MPRIS)</b></h4><pre>
       cmus provides a D-Bus interface following the Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification (MPRIS) v2:
              https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/mpris-spec/

       It  exposes  the  <u>/org/mpris/MediaPlayer2</u>  object  path  with  the  interfaces <u>org.mpris.MediaPlayer2</u> and
       <u>org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Player</u>. The unique bus name is <u>org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.cmus</u>.

       Metadata fields follow the naming convention of the specification:
              https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/mpris-spec/metadata/
       Additionally, the <u>cmus:stream_title</u> field is exposed if appropriate.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The file exists only if you configured cmus with the maximum debug level (<b>./configure</b> <b>DEBUG=2</b>).

       After a crash, the last lines of <u><a href="file:~/cmus-debug.txt">~/cmus-debug.txt</a></u> may contain useful information.

       Feature requests and bug reports should go to the GitHub issue tracker:
              https://github.com/cmus/cmus/issues
