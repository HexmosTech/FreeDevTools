       Summary

       View current topic branches

       Summarizes the currently available topic branches.

       # Branch Display

       The branch display output by this command is organized into four columns of information; for example:

       *P nocolor
              | in repo

       repo2  |

       The  first  column contains a * if the branch is the currently checked out branch in any of the specified
       projects, or a blank if no project has the branch checked out.

       The second column contains either blank, p or P, depending upon the upload status of the branch.

              (blank): branch not yet published by repo upload

              P: all commits were published by repo upload p: only some commits were published by repo upload

       The third column contains the branch name.

       The fourth column (after the | separator) lists the projects that the branch  appears  in,  or  does  not
       appear in.  If no project list is shown, then the branch appears in all projects.
