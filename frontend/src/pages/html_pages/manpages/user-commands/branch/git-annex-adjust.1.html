</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-annex-adjust - enter an adjusted branch

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       git annex adjust <b>--unlock|--lock|--fix|--hide-missing</b> <b>[--unlock|--lock|--fix]|--unlock-present</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Enters an adjusted form of the current branch. The annexed files will be treated differently. For example
       with --unlock all annexed files will be unlocked.

       The  adjusted branch will have a name like "adjusted/master(unlocked)".  Since it's a regular git branch,
       you can use <b>git</b> <b>checkout</b> to switch back to the original branch at any time.

       This allows changing how annexed files are handled, without  making  changes  to  a  public  branch  with
       commands like <b>git-annex</b> <b>unlock</b>.

       While  in the adjusted branch, you can use git-annex and git commands as usual. Any commits that you make
       will initially only be made to the adjusted branch.

       To propagate commits from the adjusted branch back to the original branch, and to other repositories,  as
       well as to merge in changes from other repositories, run <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>sync</b>. This will propagate changes that
       you've made such as adding/deleting files, but will not propagate the adjustments made by this command.

       When  in  an  adjusted  branch,  using  <b>git</b>  <b>merge</b>  <b>otherbranch</b>  is  often  not  ideal, because merging a
       non-adjusted branch may lead to unnecessary merge conflicts, or add files in non-adjusted form. To  avoid
       those problems, use <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>merge</b> <b>otherbranch</b>.

       Re-running  this  command with the same options while inside the adjusted branch will update the adjusted
       branch as necessary (eg for <b>--hide-missing</b> and <b>--unlock-present</b>), and will also propagate commits back to
       the original branch.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--unlock</b>

              Unlock all annexed files in the adjusted branch. This allows annexed files to be modified.

              Normally, unlocking a file requires a copy to be made of its content, so that its original content
              is preserved, while the copy can be modified.  To use less space, annex.thin can be  set  to  true
              before  running  this  command;  this  makes a hard link to the content be made instead of a copy.
              (When supported by the file system.) While this can save considerable disk space, any modification
              made to a file will cause the old version of the file to be lost from the  local  repository.  So,
              enable annex.thin with care.

              When  in an adjusted unlocked branch, <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>add</b> will add files unlocked instead of the default
              behavior of adding them locked.

       <b>--lock</b> Lock all annexed files in the adjusted branch. This may be preferred  by  those  who  like  seeing
              broken symlinks when the content of an annexed file is not present.

              When in an adjusted locked branch, <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>add</b> will add files locked, as usual. However, <b>git</b> <b>add</b>
              (and  <b>git</b> <b>commit</b> <b>-a</b> etc) still add files unlocked. This is because it's not possible for those git
              commands to add files locked.

       <b>--fix</b>  Fix the symlinks to annexed files to point to the local git annex object directory.  This  can  be
              useful  if  a  repository is checked out in an unusual way that prevents the symlinks committed to
              git from pointing at the annex objects.

       <b>--hide-missing</b>
              Only include annexed files in the adjusted branch when their content is present.

              The adjusted branch is not immediately changed when content availability changes, so  if  you  <b>git</b>
              <b>annex</b> <b>drop</b> files, they will become broken links in the usual way. And when files that were missing
              are copied into the repository from elsewhere, they won't immediatly become visible in the branch.

              To  update  the  adjusted  branch to reflect changes to content availability, run <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>adjust</b>
              <b>--hide-missing</b> again. Or, to automate updates, set the <b>annex.adjustedbranchrefresh</b> config.

              Despite missing files being hidden, <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>sync</b> <b>--content</b> will still operate on them,  and  can
              be  used  to  download  missing  files  from  remotes.  It  also updates the adjusted branch after
              transferring content.

              This option can be combined with --unlock, --lock, or --fix.

       <b>--unlock-present</b>
              Unlock files whose content is present, and lock files whose content is missing. This provides  the
              benefits  of working with unlocked files, but makes it easier to see when the content of a file is
              not missing, since it will be a broken symlink.

              The adjusted branch is not immediately changed when content availability changes, so when you  <b>git</b>
              <b>annex</b>  <b>get</b>  files,  they  will remain locked.  And when you <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>drop</b> files, they will remain
              locked and so will not be broken symlinks.

              To update the adjusted branch to reflect changes to content availability,  run  <b>git</b>  <b>annex</b>  <b>adjust</b>
              <b>--unlock-present</b>  again.  Or,  to automate updates, set the <b>annex.adjustedbranchrefresh</b> config. Or
              use git-annex sync --content, which updates the branch after transferring content.

       Also the <a href="../man1/git-annex-common-options.1.html">git-annex-common-options</a>(1) can be used.
