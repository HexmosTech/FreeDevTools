</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>apulse</b> - The PulseAudio emulator for <b>ALSA</b>

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>apulse</b> &lt;program-name&gt; [program-parameters]...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The program provides an alternative partial implementation of the PulseAudio API. It consists of a loader
       script  and a number of shared libraries with the same names as from original PulseAudio, so applications
       could dynamically load them and think they are talking  to  PulseAudio.  Internally,  no  separate  sound
       mixing daemon is used. Instead, <b>apulse</b> relies on <b>ALSA</b>'s <b>dmix</b>, <b>dsnoop</b>, and <b>plug</b> plugins to handle multiple
       sound  sources and capture streams running at the same time. <b>dmix</b> plugin muxes multiple playback streams;
       <b>dsnoop</b> plugin allow  multiple  applications  to  capture  from  a  single  microphone;  and  <b>plug</b>  plugin
       transparently  converts  audio between various sample formats, sample rates and channel numbers. For more
       than a decade now, <b>ALSA</b> comes with these plugins enabled and configured by default.

       <b>apulse</b> wasn't designed to be a drop-in replacement of PulseAudio. It's pointless, since that will be just
       reimplementation of original PulseAudio, with  the  same  client-daemon  architecture,  required  by  the
       complete  feature  set.   Instead,  only  parts  of the API that are crucial to specific applications are
       implemented. That's why there is a loader script, named  <b>apulse</b>.  It  updates  value  of  LD_LIBRARY_PATH
       environment  variable  to point also to the directory where <b>apulse</b>'s libraries are installed, making them
       available to the application.

       Name comes from names of both <b>ALSA</b> and PulseAudio. As <b>aoss</b> was a compatibility layer between OSS programs
       and <b>ALSA</b>, <b>apulse</b> was designed to be compatibility layer between PulseAudio applications and <b>ALSA</b>.

</pre><h4><b>RETURN</b> <b>VALUE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>apulse</b> is a simple shell wrapper script that calls <b>exec</b> on the program given in  parameters.  Except  for
       cases when the wrapper itself fails to load, return value is the return value of that program.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Run a newer Firefox browser with fake PulseAudio:

            apulse firefox
