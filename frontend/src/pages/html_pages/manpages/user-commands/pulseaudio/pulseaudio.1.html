</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       PulseAudio is a networked low-latency sound server for Linux, POSIX and Windows systems.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-h</b> <b>|</b> <b>--help</b>
              Show help.

       <b>--version</b>
              Show version information.

       <b>--dump-conf</b>
              Load  the daemon configuration file <u>daemon.conf</u> (see below), parse remaining configuration options
              on the command line and dump the resulting daemon configuration, in a format  that  is  compatible
              with <u>daemon.conf</u>.

       <b>--dump-modules</b>
              List available loadable modules. Combine with <b>-v</b> for a more elaborate listing.

       <b>--dump-resample-methods</b>
              List available audio resamplers.

       <b>--cleanup-shm</b>
              Identify  stale  PulseAudio  POSIX shared memory segments in <u><a href="file:/dev/shm">/dev/shm</a></u> and remove them if possible.
              This is done implicitly whenever a new daemon starts up or a client tries to connect to a  daemon.
              It  should normally not be necessary to issue this command by hand. Only available on systems with
              POSIX shared memory segments implemented via a virtual  file  system  mounted  to  <u><a href="file:/dev/shm">/dev/shm</a></u>  (e.g.
              Linux).

       <b>--start</b>
              Start  PulseAudio  if  it  is  not running yet. This is different from starting PulseAudio without
              <b>--start</b> which would fail  if  PA  is  already  running.  PulseAudio  is  guaranteed  to  be  fully
              initialized when this call returns. Implies <b>--daemonize</b>.

       <b>-k</b> <b>|</b> <b>--kill</b>
              Kill an already running PulseAudio daemon of the calling user (Equivalent to sending a SIGTERM).

       <b>--check</b>
              Return  0  as  return  code when the PulseAudio daemon is already running for the calling user, or
              non-zero otherwise. Produces no output on the console except for errors to stderr.

              Note that a non-zero return value doesn't necessarily mean that PulseAudio is not usable. Even  if
              the  server  is  not  running,  it  may  get  automatically  started via PulseAudio's autospawning
              mechanism or systemd's socket activation, or the environment  might  be  such  that  checking  for
              processes  doesn't work (for example, the running server might not show up in a container, even if
              the server is accessible via a socket). Also disabling PID files with  <b>--use-pid-file=no</b>  prevents
              <b>--check</b> from detecting running servers.

              A  more  robust  check  in most situations would be to try establishing a client connection to the
              server. Unfortunately there's currently no  <b>--check-connection</b>  option  to  replace  <b>--check</b>,  but
              running "pactl info" could be a pretty good substitute.

       <b>--system</b><u>[=BOOL]</u>
              Run  as  system-wide instance instead of per-user. Please note that this disables certain features
              of PulseAudio and is generally not recommended unless the system knows no local users (e.g.  is  a
              thin  client).  This  feature  needs special configuration and a dedicated UNIX user set up. It is
              highly recommended to combine this with <b>--disallow-module-loading</b> (see below).

       <b>-D</b> <b>|</b> <b>--daemonize</b><u>[=BOOL]</u>
              Daemonize after startup, i.e. detach from the terminal.  Note  that  when  running  as  a  systemd
              service you should use <b>--daemonize=no</b> for systemd notification to work.

       <b>--fail</b><u>[=BOOL]</u>
              Fail  startup  when  any  of  the  commands specified in the startup script <u>default.pa</u> (see below)
              fails.

       <b>--high-priority</b><u>[=BOOL]</u>
              Try to acquire a high Unix nice level. This will only succeed if the calling user has  a  non-zero
              RLIMIT_NICE  resource  limit  set (on systems that support this), or we're configured to be run as
              system daemon (see <u>--system</u> above). It  is  recommended  to  enable  this,  since  it  is  only  a
              negligible security risk (see below).

       <b>--realtime</b><u>[=BOOL]</u>
              Try  to acquire a real-time scheduling for PulseAudio's I/O threads. This will only succeed if the
              calling user has a non-zero RLIMIT_RTPRIO resource limit set (on systems that  support  this),  or
              rtkit  is  available and allows PulseAudio to enable real-time scheduling, or we are configured to
              be run as system daemon (see <u>--system</u> above).

       <b>--disallow-module-loading</b><u>[=BOOL]</u>
              Disallow module loading after startup. This is a security feature since  it  disallows  additional
              module  loading during runtime and on user request. It is highly recommended when <u>--system</u> is used
              (see above). Note however, that this breaks certain features like automatic module loading on  hot
              plug.

       <b>--disallow-exit</b><u>[=BOOL]</u>
              Disallow user requested exit

       <b>--exit-idle-time</b><u>=SECS</u>
              Terminate  the  daemon  after the last client quit and this time in seconds passed. Use a negative
              value to disable this feature. Defaults to 20.

              When PulseAudio runs in the per-user mode and detects a login session,  then  any  positive  value
              will  be  reset  to  0  so  that PulseAudio will terminate immediately on logout. A positive value
              therefore has effect only in environments where there's no support for login session tracking  (or
              if  the user is logged in without a session spawned, a.k.a. lingering). A negative value can still
              be used to disable any automatic exit.

              When PulseAudio runs in the system mode, automatic exit is always disabled, so  this  option  does
              nothing.

       <b>--scache-idle-time</b><u>=SECS</u>
              Unload  autoloaded  samples from the cache when they haven't been used for the specified number of
              seconds.

       <b>--log-level</b><u>[=LEVEL]</u>
              If an argument is passed, set the log  level  to  the  specified  value,  otherwise  increase  the
              configured  verbosity  level  by  one.  The log levels are numerical from 0 to 4, corresponding to
              <u>error</u>, <u>warn</u>, <u>notice</u>, <u>info</u>, <u>debug</u>. Default log level is <u>notice</u>, i.e. all log  messages  with  lower
              log levels are printed: <u>error</u>, <u>warn</u>, <u>notice</u>.

       <b>-v</b> <b>|</b> <b>--verbose</b>
              Increase  the configured verbosity level by one (see <b>--log-level</b> above). Specify multiple times to
              increase log level multiple times.

       <b>--log-target</b><u>={auto,syslog,journal,stderr,file:PATH,newfile:PATH}</u>
              Specify the log target. If set to <u>auto</u> (which is the default), then logging is directed to  syslog
              when  <b>--daemonize</b>  is  passed,  otherwise  to STDERR. If set to <u>journal</u> logging is directed to the
              systemd journal. If set to  <u>file:PATH</u>,  logging  is  directed  to  the  file  indicated  by  PATH.
              <u>newfile:PATH</u>  is otherwise the same as file:PATH, but existing files are never overwritten. If the
              specified file already exists, a suffix is added to the file name to avoid overwriting.

       <b>--log-meta</b><u>[=BOOL]</u>
              Show source code location in log messages.

       <b>--log-time</b><u>[=BOOL]</u>
              Show timestamps in log messages.

       <b>--log-backtrace</b><u>=FRAMES</u>
              When FRAMES is greater than 0, log for each message a stack trace up to the  number  of  specified
              stack frames.

       <b>-p</b> <b>|</b> <b>--dl-search-path</b><u>=PATH</u>
              Set the search path for dynamic shared objects (plugins).

       <b>--resample-method</b><u>=METHOD</u>
              Use the specified resampler by default (See <b>--dump-resample-methods</b> above for possible values).

       <b>--use-pid-file</b><u>[=BOOL]</u>
              Create  a  PID  file. If this options is disabled it is possible to run multiple sound servers per
              user.

       <b>--no-cpu-limit</b><u>[=BOOL]</u>
              Do not install CPU load limiter  on  platforms  that  support  it.  By  default,  PulseAudio  will
              terminate  itself  when  it  notices  that  it  takes  up  too  much CPU time. This is useful as a
              protection against system lockups when real-time scheduling is used (see  below).  Disabling  this
              mechanism  is  useful  when  debugging  PulseAudio  with  tools  like  <b><a href="../man1/valgrind.1.html">valgrind</a>(1)</b> which slow down
              execution.

       <b>--disable-shm</b><u>[=BOOL]</u>
              PulseAudio clients and the server can exchange  audio  data  via  POSIX  or  memfd  shared  memory
              segments  (on systems that support this). If disabled PulseAudio will communicate exclusively over
              sockets. Please note that data transfer  via  shared  memory  segments  is  always  disabled  when
              PulseAudio is running with <b>--system</b> enabled (see above).

       <b>--enable-memfd</b><u>[=BOOL]</u>
              PulseAudio  clients and the server can exchange audio data via memfds - the anonymous Linux Kernel
              shared memory mechanism (on kernels that support this). If disabled  PulseAudio  will  communicate
              via POSIX shared memory.

       <b>-L</b> <b>|</b> <b>--load</b><u>="MODULE</u> <u>ARGUMENTS"</u>
              Load the specified plugin module with the specified arguments.

       <b>-F</b> <b>|</b> <b>--file</b><u>=FILENAME</u>
              Run  the  specified script on startup. May be specified multiple times to specify multiple scripts
              to be run in order. Combine with <b>-n</b> to disable loading  of  the  default  script  <u>default.pa</u>  (see
              below).

       <b>-C</b>     Open a command interpreter on STDIN/STDOUT after startup. This may be used to configure PulseAudio
              dynamically during runtime. Equivalent to <b>--load</b><u>=module-cli</u>.

       <b>-n</b>     Don't load default script file <u>default.pa</u> (see below) on startup. Useful in conjunction with <b>-C</b> or
              <b>--file</b>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:~/.config/pulse/daemon.conf">~/.config/pulse/daemon.conf</a></u>, <u>/etc/pulse/daemon.conf</u>: configuration settings for the PulseAudio daemon. If
       the  version  in  the  user's  home directory does not exist the global configuration file is loaded. See
       <b><a href="../man5/pulse-daemon.conf.5.html">pulse-daemon.conf</a>(5)</b> for more information.

       <u><a href="file:~/.config/pulse/default.pa">~/.config/pulse/default.pa</a></u>, <u>/etc/pulse/default.pa</u>: the default configuration script to execute  when  the
       PulseAudio  daemon  is  started.  If  the  version in the user's home directory does not exist the global
       configuration script is loaded. See <b><a href="../man5/default.pa.5.html">default.pa</a>(5)</b> for more information.

       <u><a href="file:~/.config/pulse/client.conf">~/.config/pulse/client.conf</a></u>,  <u>/etc/pulse/client.conf</u>:  configuration  settings  for   PulseAudio   client
       applications. If the version in the user's home directory does not exist the global configuration file is
       loaded. See <b><a href="../man5/pulse-client.conf.5.html">pulse-client.conf</a>(5)</b> for more information.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>SIGINT,</u> <u>SIGTERM</u>: the PulseAudio daemon will shut down (Same as <b>--kill</b>).

       <u>SIGHUP</u>: dump a long status report to STDOUT or syslog, depending on the configuration.

       <u>SIGUSR1</u>: load module-cli, allowing runtime reconfiguration via STDIN/STDOUT.

       <u>SIGUSR2</u>:  load  module-cli-protocol-unix,  allowing  runtime  reconfiguration  via  a AF_UNIX socket. See
       <b><a href="../man1/pacmd.1.html">pacmd</a>(1)</b> for more information.

</pre><h4><b>UNIX</b> <b>GROUPS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>USERS</b></h4><pre>
       Group <u>pulse-access</u>: if PulseAudio is running as a system daemon (see <b>--system</b> above) access is granted to
       members of this group when they connect via AF_UNIX sockets. If PulseAudio is running as  a  user  daemon
       this group has no meaning.

       User  <u>pulse</u>, group <u>pulse</u>: if PulseAudio is running as a system daemon (see <b>--system</b> above) and is started
       as root the daemon will drop privileges and become a normal user process using this user  and  group.  If
       PulseAudio is running as a user daemon this user and group has no meaning.

</pre><h4><b>REAL-TIME</b> <b>AND</b> <b>HIGH-PRIORITY</b> <b>SCHEDULING</b></h4><pre>
       To  minimize  the  risk  of  drop-outs during playback it is recommended to run PulseAudio with real-time
       scheduling if the underlying  platform  supports  it.  This  decouples  the  scheduling  latency  of  the
       PulseAudio  daemon from the system load and is thus the best way to make sure that PulseAudio always gets
       CPU time when it needs it to refill the hardware playback buffers. Unfortunately this can be  a  security
       risk on some systems, since PulseAudio runs as user process, and giving realtime scheduling privileges to
       a  user  always  comes  with the risk that the user misuses it to lock up the system -- which is possible
       since making a process real-time effectively disables preemption. To solve this problem, PulseAudio  uses
       rtkit to safely acquire real-time scheduling when available.

       If the risk of locking up the machine is considered too big to enable real-time scheduling, high-priority
       scheduling  can  be  enabled  instead  (i.e. negative nice level). This can be enabled by passing <b>--high-</b>
       <b>priority</b> (see above) when starting PulseAudio and may also be enabled  with  the  appropriate  option  in
       <u>daemon.conf</u>.  Negative nice levels can only be enabled when the appropriate resource limit RLIMIT_NICE is
       set (see <b><a href="../man2/setrlimit.2.html">setrlimit</a>(2)</b> for more information), possibly configured in <u><a href="file:/etc/security/limits.conf">/etc/security/limits.conf</a></u>. A resource
       limit of 31 (corresponding with nice level -11) is recommended.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The PulseAudio client libraries check for the existence of the following environment variables and change
       their local configuration accordingly:

       <u>$PULSE_SERVER</u>: the server string specifying the server to connect to when  a  client  asks  for  a  sound
       server connection and doesn't explicitly ask for a specific server. The server string is a list of server
       addresses  separated  by  whitespace  which  are  tried in turn. A server address consists of an optional
       address type specifier (unix:, tcp:, tcp4:, tcp6:), followed by a path or host address.  A  host  address
       may include an optional port number. A server address may be prefixed by a string enclosed in {}. In this
       case  the  following  server address is ignored unless the prefix string equals the local hostname or the
       machine id (<a href="file:/etc/machine-id">/etc/machine-id</a>).

       <u>$PULSE_SINK</u>: the symbolic name of the sink to connect to when a client  creates  a  playback  stream  and
       doesn't explicitly ask for a specific sink.

       <u>$PULSE_SOURCE</u>:  the  symbolic  name of the source to connect to when a client creates a record stream and
       doesn't explicitly ask for a specific source.

       <u>$PULSE_BINARY</u>: path of PulseAudio executable to run when server auto-spawning is used.

       <u>$PULSE_CLIENTCONFIG</u>: path of file that shall be read  instead  of  <u>client.conf</u>  (see  above)  for  client
       configuration.

       <u>$PULSE_COOKIE</u>:   path   of   file  that  contains  the  PulseAudio  authentication  cookie.  Defaults  to
       <u><a href="file:~/.config/pulse/cookie">~/.config/pulse/cookie</a></u>.

       These environment settings take precedence -- if set -- over the configuration settings from  <u>client.conf</u>
       (see above).
