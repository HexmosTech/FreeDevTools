</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       rccs - apply RCS commands to sets of files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rccs</b> command [ options ] [ <u>filename</u> and/or <u>directory</u> ...  ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>rccs</b>  is a perl script that tries to emulate the Berkeley <b>SCCS</b> program for <b>RCS</b>.  If your fingers know how
       to type commands to <b>SCCS</b>, just do the same thing to <b>rccs</b>.

       A subset of the <b>SCCS</b> commands are implemented, the ones that I use.  Some new commands have  been  added.
       It is easy to add more commands, see the <u>Example</u> routine at the bottom of <b>rccs</b> to see how.

       This  interface  does  not require a list of files/directories for most commands; the implied list is *,v
       and/or RCS/*,v.  Destructive commands, such as clean -f, unedit, unget, do <b>not</b> have an implied list.   In
       other words, <b>rccs</b> <b>diffs</b> is the same as <b>rccs</b> <b>diffs</b> <b>RCS</b> but <b>rccs</b> <b>unedit</b> is not the same as <b>rccs</b> <b>unedit</b> <b>RCS</b>.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       options Note  that  RCS options are typically passed through to RCS.  The options that made sense to SCCS
               commands are translated to RCS options.

       ci        Alias for delta.  Checks in files.

       clean [-e] [-f] [-d|y'message'] [files]
                 Without any arguments, this command removes all files that are read only and have an associated
                 RCS file.  With the -e argument, clean removes files that have been checked  out  writable  but
                 have not been modified.  The -d|y|m option may be combined with -e to check in the set of files
                 that  have been modified.  With the -f option, clean removes all working files, <b>including</b> files
                 that have been modified since the check out.  Be careful.

       co        Alias for get.  Checks out files.

       create [-y|d'message'] [-g] files
                 Initial check in of files to the RCS system.  The files are then checked  out  readonly  unless
                 the  -g  option  is  present.   The  -y  or  -d options may be used to set the descriptive text
                 message.  Differs from SCCS in that the original files are not preserved.

       deledit   Alias for delta followed by a get -e.

       delget    Alias for delta followed by a get.

       delta [-y|d'message'] [-q] [files]
                 Check in a delta of the file.  -q is changed to RCS' -s and means to be  quiet  about  hwat  is
                 happening.   -y'message' or -d'message' or -m'message' all get sent through to RCS as the check
                 in message.  No other arguments are translated.

       diffs [-C|c] [-r&lt;rev&gt;] [-sdiff] [files]
                 Shows changes between the working files and the RCS file.  Note that the files do not  need  to
                 be  checked  out,  only writable.  -C or -c means do a context diff.  -sdiff means do a side by
                 side diff.  The sdiff option will figure out your screen width if it knows how - see the source
                 to make this work on your system.

       edit      Alias for get -e.

       enter     Alias for create -g.

       fix       Useful if you just checked in the file and then realized you forgot something.  The fix command
                 will remove the top delta from the history and leave you with an editable working file with the
                 top delta as the contents.

       get [-e] [-p] [-k] [-s] [files]
                 Get, or check out, the file.  Without any options, get just gets the latest revision of the RCS
                 file in the working file.  With -e, check out the file writable.  With -p,  send  the  file  to
                 stdout.  With -k, supress expansion of key words.  With -s, be quiet about what is happening.

       help      Get a brief help screen of information.

       history [files]
                 Print the RCS history (my format) of the specified files.

       info [files]
                 Print the list of files being edited.

       print     Alias for a loop that prints the history of each file followed by the contents of the file.

       prs       Alias for history.

       prt       Alias for history.

       unedit    Alias for clean -f.

       unget     Alias for clean -f.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -debug    Turn on debugging.  Used when debugging <b>rccs</b> itself.

       -verbose  Be more verbose about what is happening.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       To  start  off,  add a bunch of files to RCS: rccs create -y'my program name' myprog.c myprog.h Now let's
       edit them all: rccs get -e If we didn't change anything, the following gives us a clean  directory:  rccs
       clean  -e  If  we  changed myprog.h, the following gives us a clean directory after checking in myprog.h:
       rccs clean -e -d'some message' If we want to see what we changed: rccs diffs

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       It would be nice to implement a <b>-i</b> option that prompted before each action,  especially  the  destructive
       ones.
