</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux implementation of this interface
       may differ (consult the corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the  interface
       may not be implemented on Linux.

</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       at — execute commands at a later time

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       at <b>[</b>-m<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-f <u>file</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-q <u>queuename</u><b>]</b> -t <u>time_arg</u>

       at <b>[</b>-m<b>]</b> <b>[</b>-f <u>file</u><b>]</b> <b>[</b>-q <u>queuename</u><b>]</b> <u>timespec</u>...

       at -r <u>at_job_id</u>...

       at -l -q <u>queuename</u>

       at -l <b>[</b><u>at_job_id</u>...<b>]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>at</u>  utility  shall  read  commands  from  standard input and group them together as an <u>at-job</u>, to be
       executed at a later time.

       The at-job shall be executed in a separate invocation of the shell, running in a separate  process  group
       with  no  controlling  terminal,  except  that the environment variables, current working directory, file
       creation mask, and other implementation-defined execution-time attributes in effect when the  <u>at</u>  utility
       is executed shall be retained and used when the at-job is executed.

       When  the  at-job  is submitted, the <u>at_job_id</u> and scheduled time shall be written to standard error. The
       <u>at_job_id</u> is an identifier that shall be a string consisting solely of alphanumeric  characters  and  the
       &lt;period&gt;  character. The <u>at_job_id</u> shall be assigned by the system when the job is scheduled such that it
       uniquely identifies a particular job.

       User notification and the processing of the job's standard output and standard error are described  under
       the <b>-m</b> option.

       Users  shall  be  permitted  to  use <u>at</u> if their name appears in the file <b>at.allow</b> which is located in an
       implementation-defined directory.  If that file does not exist, the file <b>at.deny</b>, which is located in  an
       implementation-defined  directory,  shall be checked to determine whether the user shall be denied access
       to <u>at</u>.  If neither file exists, only a process with appropriate privileges shall be allowed to  submit  a
       job. If only <b>at.deny</b> exists and is empty, global usage shall be permitted. The <b>at.allow</b> and <b>at.deny</b> files
       shall consist of one user name per line.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>at</u> utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>12.2</u>, <u>Utility</u> <u>Syntax</u>
       <u>Guidelines</u>.

       The following options shall be supported:

       <b>-f</b> <u>file</u>   Specify  the  pathname  of  a  file to be used as the source of the at-job, instead of standard
                 input.

       <b>-l</b>        (The letter ell.) Report all jobs scheduled for the invoking user if no <u>at_job_id</u> operands  are
                 specified.  If  <u>at_job_id</u>s  are  specified,  report only information for these jobs. The output
                 shall be written to standard output.

       <b>-m</b>        Send mail to the invoking user after the at-job has run, announcing  its  completion.  Standard
                 output  and  standard  error produced by the at-job shall be mailed to the user as well, unless
                 redirected elsewhere. Mail shall be sent even if the job produces no output.

                 If <b>-m</b> is not used, the job's standard output and standard error shall be provided to  the  user
                 by  means of mail, unless they are redirected elsewhere; if there is no such output to provide,
                 the implementation need not notify the user of the job's completion.

       <b>-q</b> <u>queuename</u>
                 Specify in which queue to schedule a job for submission. When used with the  <b>-l</b>  option,  limit
                 the  search  to  that  particular queue. By default, at-jobs shall be scheduled in queue <u>a</u>.  In
                 contrast, queue <u>b</u> shall be reserved for batch jobs; see  <u>batch</u>.   The  meanings  of  all  other
                 <u>queuename</u>s  are implementation-defined. If <b>-q</b> is specified along with either of the <b>-t</b> <u>time_arg</u>
                 or <u>timespec</u> arguments, the results are unspecified.

       <b>-r</b>        Remove the jobs with the specified <u>at_job_id</u> operands that were previously scheduled by the  <u>at</u>
                 utility.

       <b>-t</b> <u>time_arg</u>
                 Submit  the  job  to  be  run  at  the  time  specified  by the <u>time</u> option-argument, which the
                 application shall ensure has the format as specified by the <u>touch</u> <b>-t</b> <u>time</u> utility.

</pre><h4><b>OPERANDS</b></h4><pre>
       The following operands shall be supported:

       <u>at_job_id</u> The name reported by a previous invocation of the <u>at</u> utility at the time the job was scheduled.

       <u>timespec</u>  Submit the job to be run at the date and time specified.  All  of  the  <u>timespec</u>  operands  are
                 interpreted  as  if  they  were  separated by &lt;space&gt; characters and concatenated, and shall be
                 parsed as described in the grammar at the end of this section.  The  date  and  time  shall  be
                 interpreted  as  being in the timezone of the user (as determined by the <u>TZ</u> variable), unless a
                 timezone name appears as part of <u>time</u>, below.

                 In the POSIX locale, the following describes the three parts of the time specification  string.
                 All  of  the  values  from  the <u>LC_TIME</u> categories in the POSIX locale shall be recognized in a
                 case-insensitive manner.

                 <u>time</u>      The time can be specified as one,  two,  or  four  digits.  One-digit  and  two-digit
                           numbers  shall  be taken to be hours; four-digit numbers to be hours and minutes. The
                           time can alternatively be specified as two numbers separated by  a  &lt;colon&gt;,  meaning
                           <u>hour</u>:<u>minute</u>.  An  AM/PM  indication (one of the values from the <b>am_pm</b> keywords in the
                           <u>LC_TIME</u> locale category) can follow the time; otherwise, a 24-hour clock  time  shall
                           be  understood.  A  timezone  name  can  also follow to further qualify the time. The
                           acceptable timezone names are implementation-defined, except that they shall be case-
                           insensitive and the string <b>utc</b> is supported to indicate the time  is  in  Coordinated
                           Universal Time.  In the POSIX locale, the <u>time</u> field can also be one of the following
                           tokens:

                           <b>midnight</b>  Indicates the time 12:00 am (00:00).

                           <b>noon</b>      Indicates the time 12:00 pm.

                           <b>now</b>       Indicates  the  current day and time. Invoking <u>at</u> &lt;<b>now</b>&gt; shall submit an at-
                                     job  for  potentially  immediate  execution  (that  is,  subject  only   to
                                     unspecified scheduling delays).

                 <u>date</u>      An  optional <u>date</u> can be specified as either a month name (one of the values from the
                           <b>mon</b> or <b>abmon</b> keywords in the <u>LC_TIME</u> locale category) followed by a day  number  (and
                           possibly  year  number  preceded by a comma), or a day of the week (one of the values
                           from the <b>day</b> or <b>abday</b> keywords in the <u>LC_TIME</u> locale category). In the POSIX  locale,
                           two special days shall be recognized:

                           <b>today</b>     Indicates the current day.

                           <b>tomorrow</b>  Indicates the day following the current day.

                           If  no  <u>date</u>  is  given, <b>today</b> shall be assumed if the given time is greater than the
                           current time, and <b>tomorrow</b> shall be assumed if it is less. If the given month is less
                           than the current month (and no year is given), next year shall be assumed.

                 <u>increment</u> The optional <u>increment</u> shall be a number preceded by a &lt;plus-sign&gt; (<b>'+'</b>) and suffixed
                           by one of the following:  <b>minutes</b>,  <b>hours</b>,  <b>days</b>,  <b>weeks</b>,  <b>months</b>,  or  <b>years</b>.   (The
                           singular  forms  shall  also be accepted.) The keyword <b>next</b> shall be equivalent to an
                           increment number of +1. For example, the following are equivalent commands:

                               at 2pm + 1 week
                               at 2pm next week

       The following grammar describes the  precise  format  of  <u>timespec</u>  in  the  POSIX  locale.  The  general
       conventions  for  this  style  of grammar are described in <u>Section</u> <u>1.3</u>, <u>Grammar</u> <u>Conventions</u>.  This formal
       syntax shall take precedence over the preceding text syntax description. The longest  possible  token  or
       delimiter  shall  be recognized at a given point. When used in a <u>timespec</u>, white space shall also delimit
       tokens.

</pre><h4><b>STDIN</b></h4><pre>
       The standard input shall be a text file consisting of commands acceptable to the shell  command  language
       described  in  <u>Chapter</u>  <u>2</u>,  <u>Shell</u>  <u>Command</u> <u>Language</u>.  The standard input shall only be used if no <b>-f</b> <u>file</u>
       option is specified.

</pre><h4><b>INPUT</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       See the STDIN section.

       The text files <b>at.allow</b> and <b>at.deny</b>, which are located  in  an  implementation-defined  directory,  shall
       contain  zero  or  more  user  names,  one per line, of users who are, respectively, authorized or denied
       access to the <u>at</u> and <u>batch</u> utilities.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables shall affect the execution of <u>at</u>:

       <u>LANG</u>      Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the
                 Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, <u>Section</u> <u>8.2</u>, <u>Internationalization</u>  <u>Variables</u>  for  the
                 precedence   of   internationalization  variables  used  to  determine  the  values  of  locale
                 categories.)

       <u>LC_ALL</u>    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the  other  internationalization
                 variables.

       <u>LC_CTYPE</u>  Determine  the  locale  for the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters
                 (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters in arguments and input files).

       <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>
                 Determine the locale that should be used to  affect  the  format  and  contents  of  diagnostic
                 messages written to standard error and informative messages written to standard output.

       <u>NLSPATH</u>   Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of <u>LC_MESSAGES</u>.

       <u>LC_TIME</u>   Determine the format and contents for date and time strings written and accepted by <u>at</u>.

       <u>SHELL</u>     Determine  a  name of a command interpreter to be used to invoke the at-job. If the variable is
                 unset or null, <u>sh</u> shall be used. If it is set to  a  value  other  than  a  name  for  <u>sh</u>,  the
                 implementation  shall do one of the following: use that shell; use <u>sh</u>; use the login shell from
                 the user database; or any of the preceding accompanied by a warning diagnostic about which  was
                 chosen.

       <u>TZ</u>        Determine  the  timezone.  The  job  shall  be submitted for execution at the time specified by
                 <u>timespec</u> or <b>-t</b> <u>time</u> relative to  the  timezone  specified  by  the  <u>TZ</u>  variable.  If  <u>timespec</u>
                 specifies  a timezone, it shall override <u>TZ</u>.  If <u>timespec</u> does not specify a timezone and <u>TZ</u> is
                 unset or null, an unspecified default timezone shall be used.

</pre><h4><b>ASYNCHRONOUS</b> <b>EVENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Default.

</pre><h4><b>STDOUT</b></h4><pre>
       When standard input is a terminal, prompts of  unspecified  format  for  each  line  of  the  user  input
       described in the STDIN section may be written to standard output.

       In  the  POSIX  locale,  the following shall be written to the standard output for each job when jobs are
       listed in response to the <b>-l</b> option:

           "%s\t%s\n", <u>at_job_id</u>, &lt;<u>date</u>&gt;

       where <u>date</u> shall be equivalent in format to the output of:

           date +"%a %b %e %T %Y"

       The date and time written shall be adjusted so  that  they  appear  in  the  timezone  of  the  user  (as
       determined by the <u>TZ</u> variable).

</pre><h4><b>STDERR</b></h4><pre>
       In  the  POSIX  locale, the following shall be written to standard error when a job has been successfully
       submitted:

           "job %s at %s\n", <u>at_job_id</u>, &lt;<u>date</u>&gt;

       where <u>date</u> has the same format as that described  in  the  STDOUT  section.  Neither  this,  nor  warning
       messages  concerning  the  selection  of  the  command interpreter, shall be considered a diagnostic that
       changes the exit status.

       Diagnostic messages, if any, shall be written to standard error.

</pre><h4><b>CONSEQUENCES</b> <b>OF</b> <b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       The job shall not be scheduled, removed, or listed.

       <u>The</u> <u>following</u> <u>sections</u> <u>are</u> <u>informative.</u>

</pre><h4><b>APPLICATION</b> <b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       The format of the <u>at</u> command line shown here is guaranteed only for the POSIX locale. Other cultures  may
       be  supported with substantially different interfaces, although implementations are encouraged to provide
       comparable levels of functionality.

       Since the commands run in a separate shell invocation, running  in  a  separate  process  group  with  no
       controlling  terminal, open file descriptors, traps, and priority inherited from the invoking environment
       are lost.

       Some implementations do not allow substitution of different shells using <u>SHELL</u>.  System  V  systems,  for
       example, have used the login shell value for the user in <b><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></b>.  To select reliably another command
       interpreter, the user must include it as part of the script, such as:

           <b>$</b> at 1800
           myshell myscript
           EOT
           <b>job</b> <b>...</b> <b>at</b> <b>...</b>
           <b>$</b>

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
        1. This sequence can be used at a terminal:

               at -m 0730 tomorrow
               sort &lt; file &gt;outfile
               EOT

        2. This  sequence,  which  demonstrates  redirecting  standard  error  to a pipe, is useful in a command
           procedure (the sequence of output redirection specifications is significant):

               at now + 1 hour &lt;&lt;!
               diff file1 file2 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;outfile | mailx mygroup
               !

        3. To have a job reschedule itself, <u>at</u> can be invoked from within the at-job. For  example,  this  daily
           processing  script  named <b>my.daily</b> runs every day (although <u>crontab</u> is a more appropriate vehicle for
           such work):

               # my.daily runs every day
               <u>daily</u> <u>processing</u>
               at now tomorrow &lt; my.daily

        4. The spacing of the three portions of the POSIX locale <u>timespec</u> is quite flexible as long as there are
           no ambiguities. Examples of various times and operand presentation include:

               at 0815am Jan 24
               at 8 :15amjan24
               at now "+ 1day"
               at 5 pm FRIday
               at '17
                   utc+
                   30minutes'

</pre><h4><b>RATIONALE</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>at</u> utility reads from standard input the commands to be executed at a later time. It may be useful to
       redirect standard output and standard error within the specified commands.

       The <b>-t</b> <u>time</u> option was added as a new capability to support an internationalized way of specifying a time
       for execution of the submitted job.

       Early proposals added a ``jobname'' concept as a way of giving submitted jobs names that  are  meaningful
       to  the user submitting them.  The historical, system-specified <u>at_job_id</u> gives no indication of what the
       job is. Upon further reflection, it was decided that the benefit of this was  not  worth  the  change  in
       historical  interface.  The  <u>at</u>  functionality  is useful in simple environments, but in large or complex
       situations, the functionality provided by the Batch Services option is more suitable.

       The <b>-q</b> option historically has been an undocumented option, used mainly by the <u>batch</u> utility.

       The System V <b>-m</b> option was added to provide a method for informing users that an  at-job  had  completed.
       Otherwise, users are only informed when output to standard error or standard output are not redirected.

       The  behavior of <u>at</u> &lt;<b>now</b>&gt; was changed in an early proposal from being unspecified to submitting a job for
       potentially immediate execution. Historical BSD <u>at</u> implementations  support  this.  Historical  System  V
       implementations  give  an  error  in  that  case,  but  a  change to the System V versions should have no
       backwards-compatibility ramifications.

       On BSD-based systems, a <b>-u</b> <u>user</u> option has allowed those with appropriate privileges to access  the  work
       of  other  users.  Since  this  is  primarily  a  system  administration  feature  and is not universally
       implemented, it has been omitted. Similarly, a specification for  the  output  format  for  a  user  with
       appropriate privileges viewing the queues of other users has been omitted.

       The  <b>-f</b>  <u>file</u>  option  from  System  V is used instead of the BSD method of using the last operand as the
       pathname. The BSD method is ambiguous—does:

           at 1200 friday

       mean the same thing if there is a file named <b>friday</b> in the current directory?

       The <u>at_job_id</u> is composed of a limited character set in historical practice, and it is mandated  here  to
       invalidate systems that might try using characters that require shell quoting or that could not be easily
       parsed by shell scripts.

       The  <u>at</u>  utility  varies  between  System  V  and  BSD systems in the way timezones are used. On System V
       systems, the <u>TZ</u> variable affects the at-job submission times and the times displayed for the user. On BSD
       systems, <u>TZ</u>  is  not  taken  into  account.  The  BSD  behavior  is  easily  achieved  with  the  current
       specification. If the user wishes to have the timezone default to that of the system, they merely need to
       issue the <u>at</u> command immediately following an unsetting or null assignment to <u>TZ</u>.  For example:

           TZ= at noon ...

       gives the desired BSD result.

       While  the  <u>yacc</u>-like  grammar specified in the OPERANDS section is lexically unambiguous with respect to
       the digit strings, a lexical analyzer would probably be written to look for and return digit  strings  in
       those  cases.  The  parser  could  then  check  whether  the digit string returned is a valid <u>day_number</u>,
       <u>year_number</u>, and so on, based on the context.
