       execute-json-from-fifo - Read a fifo stream of POSIX commands serialized as JSON and run them.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>execute-json-from-fifo</b> <b>FIFO</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is a very simple script which executes commands passed as JSON to a given named pipe. This is useful
       when  one  needs to create a super-privileged container which is able to run commands on the host system.
       It can also be used when one needs to give a container the ability to launch commands as a non-privileged
       user on the host.

       To launch this script run:

              $ execute-json-from-fifo PATH_TO_NAMED_PIPE

       You can now send commands to the pipe. The protocol is as follows:

              {"command":["echo", "some", "command"], "stdin":"path", "stdout":"path", "stderr":"path", "cwd":"path", "env":{"ENVVAR":"value"}}

       Note: the protocol is newline delimited. So never include new-lines in the command objects.

       stdin, stdout, stderr, cwd and env are all optional.

       Passing ["exit"] to command stops the script.
