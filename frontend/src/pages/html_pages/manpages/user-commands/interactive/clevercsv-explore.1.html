       clevercsv-explore - Explore the CSV file in an interactive Python shell

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>clevercsv</u> <u>explore</u> <u>[-e</u> <u>ENCODING</u> <u>|</u> <u>--encoding=ENCODING]</u>
                         <u>[-n</u> <u>NUM_CHARS</u> <u>|</u> <u>--num-chars=NUM_CHARS]</u> <u>[-p</u> <u>|</u> <u>--pandas]</u> <u>&lt;path&gt;</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The explore command allows you to quickly explore a CSV file in an interactive Python shell. This command
       detects the dialect of the CSV file and drops you into a Python interactive shell (REPL), with the CSV
       file already loaded. Simply run:

           clevercsv explore FILE

       to start working with the file loaded as a list of lists. Alternatively, you can run:

           clevercsv explore -p FILE

       to read the file as a Pandas dataframe.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       -h, --help
           show this help message and exit

       -e, --encoding
           The file encoding of the given CSV file is automatically detected using chardet. While chardet is
           incredibly accurate, it is not perfect. In the rare cases that it makes a mistake in detecting the
           file encoding, you can override the encoding by providing it through this flag. Moreover, when you
           have a number of CSV files with a known file encoding, you can use this option to speed up the code
           generation process.

       -n, --num-chars
           On large CSV files, dialect detection can sometimes be a bit slow due to the large number of possible
           dialects to consider. To alleviate this, you can limit the number of characters to use for detection.

           One aspect to keep in mind is that CleverCSV may need to read a specific number of characters to be
           able to correctly infer the dialect. For example, in the ``imdb.csv`` file in the GitHub repository,
           the correct dialect can only be found after at least 66 lines of the file are read. Therefore, if
           there is availability to run CleverCSV on the entire file, that is generally recommended.

       -p, --pandas
           By default, this command imports the CSV file as a list of lists. By enabling this option the script
           will be written such that the file will be read as a Pandas DataFrame instead.
