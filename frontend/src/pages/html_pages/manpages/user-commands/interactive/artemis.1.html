</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       Artemis - interactive EXAFS data analysis

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Artemis</b> is a program for analyzing EXAFS data using theoretical standards from <b>Feff</b>.  <b>Artemis</b> includes
       interfaces to <b>Atoms</b> and <b>Feff</b> as well as forms for defining parameters and applying those parameters to
       the paths from the <b>Feff</b> calculation.  <b>Artemis</b> uses chi(k) as it's input.  It does not handle any data
       processing chores, such as converting raw data to mu(E) or doing background removal.  <b>Artemis</b>'s sister
       program <b>Athena</b> is the data processing program.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Artemis</b> is a graphical and interactive program written in the perl programming language, using the Tk
       display engine, the <b>Ifeffit</b> EXAFS library, and the PGPLOT plotting library.  (See below for a list of
       relevant URLs.)

       <b>Artemis</b> helps you organize all aspects of a fitting project, including running the <b>Feff</b> calculation,
       settings parameters for the Fourier transform and fitting of the data, parameterizing the paths from the
       <b>Feff</b> calculation, running the fit, and plotting the results.  The <b>Artemis</b> window is divided into three
       panels.  The largest panel is the space where most of the work happens.  Its content is model and depends
       on the state of the Data and Paths List.  This list is in the center, skinny panel.  The other skinny
       panel contains the controls the are used to specify how plots are made.

       At the top of the window are the menubar and the project bar.  The project bar displays the name of the
       current project file.  It also contains an indicator that tells you if the project has been modified
       since the last time it was saved.  Clicking on the modified indicator will save the project (just like
       C-s or the "Save project" item in the File menu).  At the bottom of the screen is the echo area, where
       <b>Artemis</b> writes all sorts of helpful messages as you use the program.

       The Data and Paths list contains a tree-like list of all of the objects that can be manipulated as you
       use <b>Artemis</b>.  When the program starts, two such items are displayed.  As you run <b>Feff</b> calculations,
       import <b>Feff</b> paths and other data sets, and run fits, more items are added to this list.  In total, there
       are five kinds of entries in this list, each of which controls a diffferent aspect of <b>Artemis</b>.  These
       five kinds of list entries are: (1) fitting parameters, (2) data, (3) fits, (4) <b>Feff</b> calculation, or (5)
       <b>Feff</b> path.  When you click on an item in the Data and Paths List, that item will be "selected" and
       "anchored".  A selected item is highlighted in orange.  An anchored item is outlined with a dashed line.
       Only one item can be anchored.  0, 1, or more items can be selected.

       The anchored item determines the mode of the large panel.  For instance, when the "Guess, Def, Set" item
       is anchored, the main panel will display a page used for setting the fitting parameters.  When a data
       item is anchored, the main panel will display a page for setting Fourier tranform parameters, the fitting
       range, and other parameters associated with the data.  Many functions in <b>Artemis</b> depend upon the mode of
       the main panel.  Some features are available only in certain modes.  Each of the modes is described in
       its own document section.  See "SECTIONS OF THE DOCUMENT".

       Plots in <b>Artemis</b> are always made using the selected items.  To plot, for example, data, a fit, and
       several individual paths, it is necessary to select each of those items.  Many other functions in <b>Artemis</b>
       also work on the set of selected items.

       Anchoring and setting paths is usually done by using the mouse in the Data and Paths List, although there
       are several other ways of changing the anchor and selection using the mouse or the keyboard.  Here is a
       list of mouse events useful in the Data and Paths List:

       <b>Left</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>button</b>
           Clicking  the  left  mouse  button will clear all selections then select and anchor the item clicked.
           The main panel will display the page apporpriate to the anchored item.

       <b>Center</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>button</b>
           Clicking the center mouse button will anchor the item clicked without changing  the  selection.   The
           main panel will display the page apporpriate to the anchored item.

       <b>Right</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>button</b>
           Clicking the right mouse button will anchor the item clicked without changing the selection.  It will
           also  post a menu of functions appopriate to the item clicked.  These menus are the same as the menus
           in the menubar at the top of the window.  The main panel will display  the  page  appopriate  to  the
           anchored item.

       C<b>ontrol</b> <b>key</b> <b>+</b> <b>left</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>button</b>
           Clicking  the  left  mouse button while holding down the control key will add the item clicked to the
           group of selected items.  The anchor is not changed.

       <b>Shift</b> <b>key</b> <b>+</b> <b>left</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>button</b>
           Clicking the left mouse button while holding down the shift key will select  all  items  between  the
           anchor and the item clicked, inclusively.  The anchor is not changed.

       <b>Left</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>button</b> <b>+</b> <b>mouse</b> <b>drag</b>
           Clicking  the left mouse button then dragging the mouse while holding down the button will select all
           items that you drag the cursor over.  The item initially clicked will be anchored and the main  panel
           will display the page appopriate to the anchored item.

       <b>Control-k,</b> <b>Control-j</b>
           Hitting  the  k  or j keys while holdong the control key will move the anchor to the previous or next
           item in the list without changing the selection.  The main panel will display the page appopriate  to
           the  anchored  item.   These  two  key sequences, behave differently when the Guess, Def, Set item is
           anchored.  See The Guess, Def, Set page for details

       <b>Control-l</b>
           Hitting the l key while holding down the control key will put focus on the Data and Path List.   This
           allows you to navigate the list using the arrow keys.

       The  color  and  font of the text in the Data and Paths List indicates the status of each item.  Any item
       written in black, upright text is an item that can be plotted.  When a data set or <b>Feff</b> path is  excluded
       from  the fit, it will be written in brown text.  The Guess, Def, Set item and the <b>Feff</b> calculation items
       are written in italic text.  The italic text indicates items that cannot be plotted.  Although these non-
       plotable items can be selected, they will be ignored when a plot is made.

</pre><h4><b>ARTEMIS:</b> <b>The</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Page</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ARTEMIS</b> - The data page

       The data page is displayed in <b>Artemis</b>'s main panel when a data item is anchored in  the  Data  and  Paths
       List.   See the main document section for an explanation of anchoring and selecting items in the Data and
       Paths List.

       The data page is divided into five sections.  At the top is a box containing the title  lines  associated
       with  these  data.   These  are read from the input data file, but can be edited at any time by the user.
       When the data are written to output files, the contents of this box are written as  headers.   Below  the
       titles  box  is the name of the data file that was imported.  Below that are four boxes containing groups
       of related controls.

   <b>Data</b> <b>toggles</b>
       This box contains three toggles that control certain aspects of the fit.  The first two are only relevant
       in a multiple data set fit.  When setting up a  project  containing  a  multiple  data  set  fit,  it  is
       sometimes  useful  to exclude an entire data set from the fit without deleting it from the project.  This
       can be done with the first toggle.  When a data set is excluded, it and all items beneath it are shown in
       brown text in the Data and Paths List to indicate that they have been excluded from the fit.

       After the fit is complete, <b>Artemis</b> wants to show off her handiwork and display a plot of the data and the
       just-finished fit.  In the case of a multiple data set fit, you might have a preference about which  data
       set gets plotting.  Click this toggle on for your prefered data set.

       The  third  toggle  tells <b>Artemis</b> to do a corefinement of the background spline when it performs the fit.
       This corefinement is, effectively, the same  operation  that  was  performed  by  <b>Athena</b>  to  remove  the
       background  from  the  data.   The "rmin" parameter serves the same purpose as <b>Athena</b>'s "rbkg" parameter.
       When the fit is performed with the  background  corefinement,  a  spline  is  used  to  fit  the  Fourier
       components  of  the  data  below "rmin" and the <b>Feff</b> paths are used to fit the Fourier components between
       "rmin" and "rmax".  The number of parameters used to determine the spline is the  number  of  independent
       points  in  that portion of the data: "2*delta_k*delta_R/pi", where "delta_k" is the range of the Fourier
       transform and "delta_R" is the range between 0  and  "rmin".   The  advantage  of  doing  the  background
       corefinement,  other  than  the  possibility  of making the fit look nicer at low R, is that correlations
       between the background parameters and the fitting parameters can be measured.

   <b>Fourier</b> <b>transform</b> <b>and</b> <b>fitting</b> <b>parameters</b>
       This box contains the controls used to set the ranges of the forward Fourier transform and  of  the  fit.
       The  fit  range is also used as the backward Fourier transform range when a plot is q space is made.  See
       "Pluck buttons" for a discussion of the little quare buttons marked with a blue x.

       Other controls are used to set the functional forms of the Fourier transform window used in k and R.  The
       widths of the sills of those functions are set usng the entry boxes labeled "dk" and "dr".

   <b>k-weight</b> <b>parameters</b>
       The controls in this box are used to set the values of k-weight to be used in the fits.  There are togles
       for turning on k-weight of 1, 2, or 3.  There is also a toggle  for  specifying  an  arbitrary  value  of
       k-weight.

       These  are  the  k-weight  values  used in the fit but not the k-weight used to plot the data.  These two
       purposes of k-weight are handled independently by <b>Artemis</b>.  See Plotting in Artemis for a  discussion  of
       the plotting k-weight controls.

       People sometimes get confused by the concept of multipl k-weights for fitting.  The prupose of choosing a
       low  or  high  value  for  k-weight is to attempt to emphasize either the low- or high-k end of the data.
       Because different regions of the data are sensitive to different kinds of parameters, one might choose  a
       low  or  high  value  to  increase  the  precision  of measurement of certain parameters.  Doing multiple
       k-weight fits is a sort of compromise -- a way of emphasizing both ends of the data in the fit.

       The fit is determined by minimizing a quantity called chi-square.  Chi-square is evaluated by summing the
       squares of the difference between the data and the theory.  Since the FT is complex, there is a real part
       and an imaginary part.  So chi-square is proporitional to:

                /                                                    \
           sum &lt;   Re[ data(R) - th(R) ]^2 + Im[ data(R) - th(R)]^2   &gt;
            R   \                                                    /

       In a multiple k-weight fit, there are simply more terms in the sum.   Let's  take  a  kw=1&amp;3  fit  as  an
       example.   This  summation  is made for the kw=1 data and theory.  <b>And</b> the summation is made for the kw=3
       data and theory.  The summations are added together and the full sum is used to evaluate chi-square.

       At the end of the day, there is only one set of guess parameters that have been  optimized  by  the  fit.
       These guess parameters along with the set parameters are used to evaluate the def parameters and the path
       parameters.   The  path  parameters  are  used  to  evaluate the exafs equation for each path.  The exafs
       equations for the paths are summed up to make the best-fit theoretical chi(k).  You have  a  data  chi(k)
       and  a best-fit chi(k).  Those can then be plotted however you like -- even using a k-weight that was not
       used in determining the fit.

   <b>Other</b> <b>parameters</b>
       The last box contains several controls that did not fit  into  theother  boxes.   There  is  a  menu  for
       selecting  the fitting space.  You can choose to fit the data in any of k, R, or q space.  The default is
       to fit in R.

       Epsilon is the uncertainty used to evaluate chi-square.  Normally it is  fine  to  let  <b>Artemis</b>  use  the
       default  value  (which  is  determined  from  the  RMS  value  of the data between 15 and 25 angstroms in
       R-space).  In some situations, you may find it useful to explicitly set a value for epsilon.

       After the fit, <b>Artemis</b> writes a log file documenting the fit.  Among the information in that log file are
       the correlations between all the fitting parameters.  You can set the  level  below  which  <b>Artemis</b>  will
       exclude a correlation from this report.

       Finally, there is a menu for selecting the path to use for phase corrected plots.  This menu contains the
       first  five  paths  from each <b>Feff</b> calculation used with the data set.  When a path is selected for phase
       corrected plots, the full phase shift of that path -- both the central atom and scattering atom  portions
       --  will  be  subtracted  from  anything  that is Fourier transformed before it is plotted.  If a path is
       selected for phase correction and you make a plot of, say, the data, the  fit,  and  several  paths,  the
       selected  phase  shift  will  be subtracted from each item before it is plotted.  Phase correction is for
       plotting only.  Fits are always done on non-phase-corrected data.

   <b>Pluck</b> <b>buttons</b>
       Several of the controls on this page a have a small button with a blue x next to them.  These are  called
       pluck  buttons  and  are  used  for grabbing values from the plot window.  When you click on one of these
       buttons, a prompt will be written to echo area asking you to click on a pointin the plot.   When  you  do
       so,  the  value  that  you  clicked  on will be inserted into the entry box adjacent to the pluck button.
       <b>Artemis</b> is careful not to let you pluck a k-value from a plot in R, or vice versa.

   <b>Context</b> <b>menus</b>
       As you pass the mouse over labels on the data page, the text under the mouse  will  change  color.   This
       color  change  is  an indication that mouse clicks will do something.  A left mouse click on one of these
       labels will cause a brief description of that parameter to be displayed in the echo area.  Many of  these
       descriptions also suggest reasonable values for the parameter.

       Clicking  the  right  mouse button on one of the labels will post a context menu of useful function.  One
       such function is restore that parameter to its default value.  If you have a muliple data  set  fit,  the
       other menu options allow you to constrain the parameter between data sets.

       The  labels  at  the  top  of  the boxes are all sensitive to the left mouse button.  The labels atop the
       Fourier transform and fit range box and the k-weights box are also sensitive to the right mouse click.

</pre><h4><b>ARTEMIS:</b> <b>Guess,</b> <b>Set,</b> <b>Def</b> <b>Parameters</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ARTEMIS</b> - Guess, set, def parameters

       This page is used to define the parameters of the fitting model.  In  <b>Artemis</b>  there  are  six  kinds  of
       parameters:

       <b>Guess</b>
           Guess  parameters  are the ones that are optimize during the course of the fit to best-fit the theory
           to the data.

       <b>Def</b> Def parameters are typically expressed as math expressions which may be functionally  dependant  upon
           other parameters.  These math expressions are updated throughout the course of the fit.  As the guess
           parameters are update, so are the def parameters.

       <b>Set</b> Set parameters are evaluated at the beginning of the fit and not updated throughout the fit.  This is
           the  main  difference  between  def  and  set  parameters.   Set  parameters  can  be numbers or math
           expressions.

       <b>Restraint</b>
           Restraints are math expressions which, like def parameters, are updated throughout the course of  the
           fit,  but  which take on a special role in the fit.  A restraint is evaluated and added in quadrature
           to the evaluation of the chi-square parameter.  A restraint, therefore, can be used to incorporate  a
           a  bias  in the fitting result towards a piece of prior knowledge about the physical system.  See the
           <b>Ifeffit</b> for a complete discussion of restraints.

       <b>Skip</b>
           Skip parameters are maintained in the project but are not used in any capacity in the fit.  The point
           of a skip parameter is to maintain but not use  a  complicated  parameter  with  a  complicated  math
           expression.

       <b>After</b>
           An  after  is  similar  to  a  def parameter in that it may be a math expression dependent upon other
           parameters.  An after is not, however, a part of the fitting model.  Instead it is a  parameter  that
           will be evaluated upon completion of the fit using the best fit values.  The list of after parameters
           will  be  reported  in  the  log  file.  Using an after parameter anywhere in your fitting model will
           result in Artemis reporting an error in the model.  Afters can depend  upon  other  afters,  but  you
           should  take care in with the order that the afters appear in the list.  The after parameters will be
           evaulated only once after the fit, thus circular or out-of-order dependencies will not be resolved.

       The Guess, Def, Set page is divided into two sections.  At the top is a listbox containing  the  list  of
       all defined parameters.  At the bottom is the edit area which contains the controls used to establish the
       parameters.

   <b>The</b> <b>parameter</b> <b>listbox</b>
       This  area  contains a four-column list of all the parameters defined in a project.  The left-most column
       counts the parameters.  The second column contains a tag identifying the  type  of  the  parameter.   The
       third  column  contains  the  parameter  name.   The  right-most  column  contains  the  parameter's math
       expression.

       Parameters are coded by color and by the tag in the second  column.   Guess  parameters  are  written  in
       purple  text and have the "g:" tag.  Def parameters are written in green text and have the "d:" tag.  Set
       parameters are written in black text and have the "s:" tag.  Restraints are written in pink text and have
       the "r:" tag.  Skip parameters are written in grey text and have no tag.  After parameters are written in
       blue-grey text and have the "a:" tag.

       There are a large number of mouse clicks and key sequences that serve a purpose in the listbox:

       1.  A left mouse click selects a parameter and displays it in the edit area.

       2.  A double click of the left mouse button selects a parameter,  displays  it  in  the  edit  area,  and
           prompts you for the parameter annotation.  See "Parameter annotations".

       3.  A  right  mouse  click selects a parameter, displays it in the edit area, and posts a contextual menu
           about that parameter.  The menu has several items in it.  The "Move" submenu is  sued  to  reposition
           the  current  parameter  in the list.  The "Make" submenu serves to change the type of the parameter.
           The "Copy" item will replicate the anchored parameter, appending a few characters to the end  of  its
           name.   The  "Build  restraint"  item  is  discussed below.  The "Annotate" menu item prompts for the
           parameter annotation.  The "Find" menu item will search through all parameter and path parameter math
           expressions and show you how that parameter is used in the project.  The "Grab"  menu  item  is  only
           enabled  for  guess  parameters  and  will insert the best-fit value from a fit as the value for that
           parameter.  Finally the "Discard" menu item will remove that parameter from the list after  prompting
           for confirmation.

       4.  Control-d will define the parameter in the edit area.

       5.  Control-g will grab the current parameters best-fit value from a fit.

       6.  Control-e will show the editing area if it is hidden.

       7.  Control-k  and  control-j  will move the selection up and down in the list.  Note that these two key-
           sequences serve to move the anchor up and down in the Data and Path List when  the  Guess,  Def,  Set
           page is not showing.

       8.  Control-n will clear the selection and focus on the parameter name entry box so that you can create a
           new parameter.

       9.  Control-y  will  prompt  you  to  then  hit any of the g, d, s, r, k or e keys to set the type of the
           parameter.  This is only way of setting the parameter type that does not involve the mouse.

   <b>Extended</b> <b>selection</b>
       Multiple items in the list of parameters can be selected using the control-click, shift-click, and click-
       drag sequences described for the Data and Paths List and for the log viewer.  Only the anchored list item
       (i.e. the one surreounded by a dashed line and displayed in the edit area) can have  its  name  and  math
       expression edited.

       The  advantage  of extended selection is that certain of the context menu options discussed above in item
       #3 can operate on many parameters at once.  By doing extended selection then  clicking  the  right  mouse
       button  somewhere  in  the selected region, the context menu will be posted with options for the group of
       selected parameters.  Currently, groups of parameters can have their types set and can  be  discarded  in
       this manner.

       If  you right-click outside the selected region, the extended selection will be cleared and the parameter
       clicked on will be anchored and selected.

   <b>The</b> <b>edit</b> <b>area</b>
       There are three rows of controls in the edit area.  The top row has two entry boxes.  The smaller one  on
       the  left  is  for  entering  the name of the parameter.  The larger one on the right is for entering the
       parameter's math expression.

       Below the entry boxes are a set of five radiobuttons for selecting the type of parameter being edited.

       At the bottom of the edit area are five buttons for acting upon the parameter being  edited.   The  "Undo
       edit"  button  clears  the entry boxes and discards whatever changes were just made.  The "New" button is
       used to define a brand new parameter.  It clears the entry boxes, unselects parameters  in  the  listbox,
       and  gives focus to entry box for entering the parameter name.  The "Grab" button becomes enabled after a
       fit is run.  It inserts the best-fit value for  a  guess  parameter.   The  "Discard"  button  deletes  a
       parameter  from  the list.  A dialog pops up confirming deletion.  Finally, the "Hide" button removes the
       edit area from view to allow more parameters to be visible in the listbox.  When the edit area is hidden,
       it is replaced by a button for restoring the edit area.

       Here are the details of the behavior of these controls:

       1.  Hitting return in the parameter name entry box defines the parameter, inserts or updates  it  in  the
           listbox,  and  puts  focus  on  the math expression entry box.  If a math expression has not yet been
           defined, the parameter will be defined as 0.

       2.  Hitting return in the math expression entry box defines the parameter, inserts or updates it  in  the
           listbox, and leaves focus on the math expression entry box.

       3.  Clicking  on any of the radiobuttons defines the the parameter, inserts or updates it in the listbox,
           and leaves the focus unchanged.

   <b>Parameter</b> <b>annotations</b>
       An annotation is a short text string that is associated with the parameter.  This string  is  written  to
       the echo area whenever the parameter is selected in the listbox on the Guess, Def, Set page.  The purpose
       of  he  annotation  is to write a little hint about the role played by the parameter in the fiting model.
       If a guess  parameters  has  no  annotation  when  a  fit  is  run,  its  annotation  will  be  generated
       automatically.   The  automatic annotation for a guess parameter is its best fit value +/- its error bar.
       The automatic annotation for a def, after, or restrain parameter is its evaluated value after the fit.

   <b>Building</b> <b>restraints</b>
       One of the items in the context menu displayed  when  right-clicking  on  a  parameter  is  for  building
       restraints based on guess or def parameters.  This tool provides a dialog for constructing one particular
       type  of  restraint  --  the type that coerces a parameter to stay within a boundries for its value.  The
       dialog prompts for a minimum and maximum  value  and  for  a  term  called  the  "amplifier".   The  math
       expression constructed is this one:

           restrain  param_res = penalty(param, min, max) * amp

       The  penalty  function  evaluates  to  0  when "param" is between "min" and "max", to abs(min-param) when
       "param" is less than "min", and to abs(param-max) when "param" is greater than "max".  This is  added  in
       quadrature to reduced chi-square as the fit is evaluated.

       The  amplifier  term  determines  the  magnitude  of the penalty.  A large value for "amp" will force the
       fitted value of "param" not to stray too far outside its bounds.  A small value will allow the  fit  more
       freedom to let "param" deviate from your initial guess.

       See  the  <b>Ifeffit</b> FAQ, question 8.1 for more discussion of restraints, including discussion of other ways
       to set restraints that do not involve the penalty() function.

       A cautionary note: restraints are not always appropriate.  As  an  example,  if  a  fit  is  returning  a
       negative value for sigma^2, it may not be appropriate to apply a stiff restraint as a way of forcing that
       sigma^2  to be a value that you expect.  Often, a negative sigma^2 is indicative of some other problem in
       the fitting model such as excessive structural disorder, a coordination number that is forced to  be  too
       small, the incorrect atomic species for a backscatterer, or some such.  Using a restraint on sigma^2 in a
       case  like  this  would  not  fix  the  problem.   Quite  the  opposite, it might foster a false sense of
       accomplishment by "fixing" the sigma^2 "problem" without actually addressing the actual  problem  in  the
       fitting model.

   <b>Highlighting</b>
       There is an option in the GDS menu for highlighting parameters.  This prompts you for a text string.  Any
       parameter  names or math expressions that match that string will be marked with a green background.  This
       is particularly useful for large parameter lists.  The text string  is  interpreted  as  a  perl  regular
       expression  and  so  any valid perl metacharacters can be used.  (This includes regular expressions using
       "(?{ code })" and other similar constructions, a practice the author of <b>Artemis</b> does not  recommend,  but
       does not prevent.)

   <b>Importing</b> <b>and</b> <b>exporting</b> <b>text</b> <b>files</b>
       For  large, complex fitting models, it may be convenient to edit the parameter list with a text editor or
       even to write a program which generates the parameters and writes them to a text file.  In that case,  it
       is  convenient  to  be  able to import and export a textual respresentation of the parameter list.  These
       files are of a simple format.  Any line like these:

          guess  a   5
          set    b   6
          def    c   a+b

       can imported to and exported from the Guess, Def, Set page via the GDS menu.  In an  imported  file,  any
       line  beginning  with  any of "guess", "def", "set", "restrain", "after", or "skip" will be imported as a
       parameter.  The second word on the line will be taken as the parameter name and the  remaining  words  on
       the line will be concatinated to form the math expression.  On export lines will follow this format:

          type name = math_expression

       Very  little error checking is performed upon import to verify that the parameter is defined sensibly, so
       use this feature with caution.

</pre><h4><b>ARTEMIS:</b> <b>ATOMS,</b> <b>The</b> <b>Crystallographic</b> <b>Front</b> <b>End</b> <b>to</b> <b>FEFF</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ARTEMIS</b> - <b>ATOMS</b>, The Crystallographic Front End to <b>FEFF</b>

       The purpose of <b>Atoms</b> is to generate a "feff.inp" file from  crystallographic  data.   The  hard  part  of
       making a "feff.inp" file is creating the long list of atomic coordinates.  <b>Atoms</b> thus makes the hard part
       of running <b>Feff</b> easy, at least for crystalline matrials.

       This  page  can  be  used  to  create input data for <b>Atoms</b> from scratch.  It will also be used to display
       crystallography data imported from an "atoms.inp" file or a CIF file.  To import an "atoms.inp"  file  or
       CIF file, use the normal file import dialog.

   <b>The</b> <b>title</b> <b>box</b>
       At  the  top  is  a text box for entering title lines identifying the crystallographic data.  These lines
       will be written to the "feff.inp" file and to the top of the <b>Feff</b> interpretation page.  This  is  a  good
       place to cite the literature reference or to provide other important information about the crystal.

   <b>Crystal</b> <b>parameters</b>
       To  the  left  side  of the page are entry boxes for entering space group, lattice constants, and lattice
       angles of the crystal.  A space group must always be provided.  <b>Atoms</b> is  very  flexible  about  how  the
       space group symbol is entered.  You can use the Hermann-Maguin or Scheonflies symbols or the index of the
       space  group  from  the International Tables.  The algorithm that interprets the symbol is insensitive to
       white space and capitalization -- "P m -3 m" and "PM-3M"  are interpreted the same.  For complete details
       about how the symbols are interpreted, see the <b>Atoms</b> docuemntation on Bruce's web site.

       Lattice constants are entered in units of Angstroms, angles are entered as  decimal  numbers  in  degrees
       (and not in arc minutes -- i.e. 89 and a half degrees is entered as 89.5 rather than 89'30").  Many space
       groups  have symmetries that make some lattice angles and constants the same.  In those situations, it is
       only necesary to fill in the essential values.  For instance, a cubic space group only requires  a  value
       for  the "a" constant.  <b>Atoms</b> will know to set the other lattice constants the same and to set the angles
       to 90 degrees.  For lower symmetry groups, you must provide all the necessary information.

       Below the lattice constants are entry boxes for "Rmax" and the shift vector and a menu for selecting  the
       absorption edge of the <b>Feff</b> calculation.  "Rmax" is the radial extent of the cluster that will be written
       to  the  "feff.inp"  file.   Some  space  groups are given in the International Tables with two different
       origins -- i.e. the origin is placed at sites  with  two  different  point  symmetries.   The  fractional
       coordinates  of  the  sites are different for the two different settings of the crystal.  In those cases,
       <b>Atoms</b> requires that you use a particular one of the two choices.  If your input data has used  the  other
       origin  choice,  it  should  be  fairly obvious.  In that case, coordination numbers and distances to the
       coordination shells will usually be obviously wrong.  When you use one of the space groups for which  two
       origin choices exist, <b>Artemis</b> will issue a warning.  If you suspect that the wrong origin choice has been
       used, insert the values for the shift vector that were reported in the warning message.

       On  occassion,  crystals are reported in the literature using origins other than the standard one used in
       the International Tables.  A famous example is germanium oxide.  Here is the crystal data for GeO2:

          title GeO2 (hexagonal)
          space p 32 2 1
          a=4.98502       c=5.64800
          rmax=6.0        core=Ge
          shift   0 0 0.66667
          atoms
            Ge    0.4513  0.0     0.0
            O     0.3969  0.3021  0.0909

       For some reason, the crystallography reference for this material uses an origin that is shifted by 2/3 in
       the z direction relative to the origin used in the International Tables.  To get <b>Atoms</b>  to  compute  this
       structure correctly, the shift vector given above must be used.

   <b>The</b> <b>atoms</b> <b>list</b>
       To  the  right  side of the page is the list of unique crystallographic sites.  As new sites are created,
       they are inserted into the list.  The sites are not edited directly, instead  the  editing  area  at  the
       bottom  of  the  screen is used and the list of all sites is displayed here.  This works much the same as
       the Guess, Def, Set page.

       To edit a site, left-click on its entry in the list.  It's element symbols,  coordinates,  and  site  tag
       will  be  displayed  in the edit area.  A right click on a site in the list will post a context menu with
       several functions that can be perfromed on that site.  You can re-order the list using  the  "Move"  menu
       item.   A  site  can  be copied and the copy added to the list using the "Copy" menu item.  The "Discard"
       menu item completely removes the site from the list.  The list supports extended  selection.   When  many
       sites  are  selected  (i.e. highlighted in yellow), the "Discard" menu item will work on all the selected
       sites.

       Sites can also be reordered using the keyboard.  "Alt-k" and "Alt-j" can be used  to  move  the  selected
       site up or down in the list.

   <b>The</b> <b>edit</b> <b>area</b>
       At  the  bottom  of  the  page  is  the  collection  of  widgets  used to actually create and edit unique
       crystallographic sites.  The element box is used to insert the two-letter element symbol  for  the  site.
       The  site will not be created if this is not a valid symbol.  The tag can be any 10-letter string used to
       identify the site.  The tag is used to differentiate sites that contain the same element.

       The boxes for the "x", "y", and "z" coordinates can be filled  with  floating  point  numbers  or  simple
       fractions.   That  is,  0.5 and "1/2" are both acceptable.  These coordinates are fractional positions in
       the unit cell and are not Cartesian coordinates.

       Once you have created all sites in your crystal, click the "Run Atoms" button.   This  will  process  the
       crystallographic data, create the "feff.inp" file, display the "feff.inp" page.

   <b>Atoms</b> <b>template</b> <b>files</b>
       The  "feff.inp"  data  that  is  generated  when  the  "Run Atoms" button is pressed is determined by the
       contents of a special template file.  <b>Artemis</b> is distributed with a  number  of  template  files  serving
       different  purposes.   The  structure of the "feff.inp" data is set by the value of the "atoms-&gt;template"
       preference.  The default value is "feff", which tells <b>Artemis</b> to  use  the  template  file  suitable  for
       running <b>Feff6</b>.

       If  you  want to run some other version of <b>Feff</b>, you should set the "atoms-&gt;template" preference variable
       to the appropriate value.  Templates are provided with <b>Artemis</b> for writing <b>Feff7</b> and <b>Feff8</b>  input  files.
       <b>Feff8</b> input files can be written which are suitable for XANES or non-self-consistent EXAFS calculations.

       Sometimes,  it  is useful to modify template files for writing out specialized "feff.inp" data.  If these
       modified template files are placed  in  "<a href="file:~/.horae/atp/">~/.horae/atp/</a>"  (unix)  or  "C:Program  Files\Ifeffit\horae\atp"
       (windows), <b>Artemis</b> will be able to find them.

   <b>Final</b> <b>note</b>
       A full explanation of how the <b>Atoms</b> algorithms works is beyond the scope of this document page.

</pre><h4><b>ARTEMIS:</b> <b>The</b> <b>FEFF</b> <b>Input</b> <b>File</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ARTEMIS</b> - The <b>FEFF</b> input file

       This  page displays the <b>Feff</b> input data, which includes some control parameters and a long list of atomic
       coordinates.  This page is no more sophisticated than a text box which serves as a primitive editor and a
       button at the bottom for running <b>Feff</b>.  Explaining <b>Feff</b> is beyond the scope of this document.

       When <b>feff</b> is finished, you will presented with a dialog asking how many paths to import.  The choices are
       none, the first path, the first 10 paths, and all paths.  The number in the third option is  configurable
       in  the  preferences  dialog.   Should  you  ever  need to rerun <b>Feff</b> after starting a project, "none" is
       usually the right answer.  The other options may result in one or more paths being defined twice  in  the
       project -- a confusing situation.

       If  <b>Feff</b>  fails to run to completion, <b>Artemis</b> will try to recognize the problem and post a suggestion for
       how to solve the problem.  If <b>Artemis</b> does not recognize your problem, explain it Bruce  so  he  can  add
       that problem to <b>Artemis</b>'s database of troubleshooting solutions.

</pre><h4><b>ARTEMIS:</b> <b>Interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>FEFF</b> <b>Calculation</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ARTEMIS</b> - Interpretation of the <b>FEFF</b> calculation

       This  page  provides  a concise overview of the <b>Feff</b> calculation.  At the top of the page is a summary of
       some of the statistics of the calculation.  Below that is a chart showing the details of each  path  from
       the calculation.  For each path, the degeneracy, the half path length and the amplitude factor are shown.
       The  last  column  shows a tokenized summary of the scattering path -- this allows you to see at a glance
       which atoms were involved in the path.

       The information and context menus available on this page allow you organize, understand,  and  manipulate
       the  paths  in  this <b>Feff</b> calculation.  Pretty much all functions involving the paths <u>except</u> writing math
       expressions for the path parameters are available on this page.

   <b>The</b> <b>interpretation</b> <b>chart</b>
       The colors and fonts used in the chart convey information:

       <b>Bold,</b> <b>black</b> <b>font</b>
           These are paths that have been imported into the project and are included in the fit.

       <b>Bold,</b> <b>brown</b> <b>font</b>
           These are paths that have been imported into the project but are excluded in the fit.

       <b>Normal,</b> <b>black</b> <b>text</b>
           These are paths that have not been imported into the project but which are available to be imported.

       <b>Normal,</b> <b>grey</b> <b>text</b>
           These are paths that are unavailable for importation into the project.  These can be  made  available
           by  re-running  the <b>Feff</b> calculation.  After the <b>Feff</b> run, it is best to choose the "import no paths"
           to avoid reimporting paths already in the project.  After  that,  these  paths  will  be  written  in
           normal, black text, indicating that they are available for import.

       <b>Light</b> <b>brown</b> <b>background</b>
           The light brown background is used to indicate single scattering paths.

       <b>Light</b> <b>blue</b> <b>background</b>
           The  light  blue  background  is  used  to indicate collinear or nearly collinear multiple scattering
           paths.

   <b>Context</b> <b>menus</b>
       There are interesting and useful context menus on every part of this page.  These menus are available  by
       right clicking.

       Right  clicking  anywhere  in  the  text  box  at the top of the page will pop up a menu with options for
       viewing files from the <b>Feff</b> calculation.

       Right clicking in the interpretation chart will post a menu of options relevant to the path on  the  line
       on  which  you  clicked.  Each of the four kinds of paths given by the four fonts described above has its
       own menu.

       For paths that are imported in the fit, the menu offers options for plotting the  path,  displaying  that
       path's page, including or excluding the path in the fit, selecting or deselecting that path for plotting,
       making  that  path  the  default for evaluation of def parameters after a fit, displaying the text of the
       file containing the path, or discarding the path.   The  choices  for  including  or  excluding  and  for
       selecting  or  deselecting depend on the state of that path in the Data and Paths List. Also some options
       might be greyed out depending on the state of that path.

       For paths that have not been imported into the project, the context menu allows you to  import  the  path
       with the option of displaying its page or leaving the display on the <b>Feff</b> interpretation.  For paths that
       are unavailable for import, a message saying so is posted when one of those lines is right-clicked.

       The  interpretation chart allows for extended selection of lines in the chart.  You can select additional
       paths by holding the control key while clicking with the left mouse button.  Holding the shift key  while
       left  clicking  selects all line between the anchor (the one outlined with a dashed line) and the one you
       click on.  You can also click and drag to select all the lines you drag over.  When more than one line is
       selected, the content of the context menu change to reflect  functionality  that  makes  sense  for  many
       paths.   Extended  selection  in the interpretation chart is therefore a good way of including/excluding,
       selecting/deselecting, or plotting a large number of paths.

       The context menu that pops up when many lines are selected may be  a  little  surprising.   Its  contents
       depend upon the state of the anchored line, which in this case is the one that you right-click on to post
       the  menu.   The  options  in  the  context  menu will be suitable to the state of the anchored selection
       regardless of the states of the other selected lines.  If you choose a menu item that does not make sense
       for some of the selected lines, those lines will be ignored.

       Here is a concrete example.  Suppose that you select a number of lines, some of which are included in the
       fit and some of which have not been imported in the fit.  If you then right click on one of the  included
       paths,  you  will  get options appropriate to included paths.  If you then ask to plot the selected paths
       along with the data, the included paths will be plotted and the imported  paths  will  be  ignored.   If,
       instead, you click on one of the paths that has not been imported yet, the context menu will give you the
       option  of importing the selected paths.  In that case, the paths that have already been imported will be
       ignored.

   <b>Trouble</b> <b>shooting</b>
       On occassion you might see that lines in the <b>Feff</b> interpretation do not properly report on  the  contents
       of the path.  When this happens, site tags are replaced by this string: "&lt;?&gt;".  There are a couple common
       reasons you might see the "&lt;?&gt;" tags:

       1.  You  have  done  some  advanced  voodoo  with <b>Feff</b>, editing the "files.dat" or "paths.dat" files then
           rerunning the last module to produce specialized output.

       2.  You have discovered a bug in the  algorithm  <b>Artemis</b>  uses  to  harvest  information  from  the  <b>Feff</b>
           calculation.   IN that case, you should send the "feff.inp" file or the <b>Artemis</b> project file to Bruce
           so he can fix the problem.

       Note that the appearance of the "&lt;?&gt;" tags is probably not an indication that <b>Feff</b> has  misbehaved.   The
       <b>Feff</b> calculation has to run to completion and generate its normal output before this problem can manifest
       itself.   The  <b>Feff</b>  calculation is almost certainly usable to analyze the data.  The <b>Feff</b> interpretation
       page is <b>Artemis</b>'s attempt to organize information  about  the  <b>Feff</b>  calculation  in  some  user-friendly
       format.  That this organizational effort failed is not necessarily an indication that <b>Feff</b> failed.

</pre><h4><b>ARTEMIS:</b> <b>The</b> <b>Path</b> <b>Page</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ARTEMIS</b> - The path page

       The  path  page is displayed whenever a <b>Feff</b> path is selected from the Data and Paths List.  This page is
       used to establish the math expressions of the path parameters for this path.

       At the top of the page is a line identifying which <b>Feff</b> calculation this path is from.   Below  that  are
       three  toggles.   One  is  used to include of inlcude or exclude the path from use in the fit.  There are
       many other ways in <b>Artemis</b> to include and exclude paths other than to use  this  toggle.   See  The  Feff
       interpretation  page  and  "artemis_menubar"  for more discussion of this.  Also Control-t is the same as
       clicking this toggle.

       The second toggle is used to specify paths that you would like plotted after a fit (or sum of  paths)  is
       finished.   By  default, the data and the fit (or sum) is plotted after the fit (or sum) and no paths are
       plotted.  Any paths selected for plotting will be added to the plot after the fit (or sum) is finished.

       The third toggle is used to set which path is the default path for evaluation of Def parameters after the
       fit.  It is possible to write math expressions  which  evaluate  differently  for  different  paths.   An
       example  might  be  a  math  expression  using  the "reff" parameter.  For any such Def parameters, it is
       necessary to tell <b>Artemis</b> which path should be used for the reporting of  those  parameters  in  the  log
       file.  The default is to use the first path listed in the Data and Paths List.

       Below  that  is  a  box  which summarizes the path.  This gives some statistics about the path as well as
       displaying a color-coded "map" of the scattering path.  The central atom is always displayed in red text.
       Other atoms are in black text.  The grey text shows the length and scattering angle of each  leg  of  the
       path.  In the case of a high-order multiple scattering path which has legs which have a non-zero Eulerian
       eta angle between them, the eta angle will be displayed as well.  If that last sentence was gibberish, it
       suffices to know that paths of that sort are almost never observable in real EXAFS data.

       At the bottom of the page is the list of path parameters.  This is the most important section of the page
       because it is here that the details of the fitting model are realized.  There is an entry box for each of
       the  various  types  of  path  parameters.  The math expression approporiate for each parameter should be
       entered in the entry box.

       When a <b>Feff</b> calculation is imported into <b>Artemis</b>, a set of automatic parameters  are  generated,  entered
       into  the  list  on  the  Guess,  Def,  Set page, and entered into the path parameetr boxes for each path
       imported.  The default behavior of <b>Artemis</b> is to generate a set of parameters appropriate for  a  simple,
       single scattering, first shell fit.  While it might be OK to immediately click the big green button, most
       fitting models will require substantial editing.

       The  right mouse button serves many important purposes on the path page.  Clicking the right mouse button
       anywhere in one of the entry boxes will highlight the word underneath the cursor and post  a  menu.   The
       entries  in  the menu are for for defining the word as a parameter on the Guess, Def, Set page.  For each
       parameter type there is the option of jumping or staying.  In either case, the parameter is  defined  and
       added  to  the  list  on  the  GDS  page.  For jumping, the GDS page is then displayed.  For staying, the
       current path page remains displayed.

       Right clicking on one of the path parameter labels will post a menu of functions related to defining path
       parameter math expressions.  The "Edit" option will pop up a dialog used for entering a  math  expression
       and then optionally exporting its value to other paths.  The "Clear" option doies just that.

       The  various  "Export"  options  are ways of constraining path parameters to be the same for other paths.
       The "Grab" options make the current path parameter the same as the path  parameter  in  the  previous  or
       following path.

       The "sigma^2" label has some additional options.  These insert the syntactically correct text appropriate
       to using either the Correlated Debye or single frequency Einstein models for the sigma^2 of the path.

       To  enable  the  display  of  spaces  for  the  "dphase",  "k_array",  "amp_array", or "phase_array" path
       parameters, you must click on the "Extended path parameters" button in the Paths menu.

</pre><h4><b>ARTEMIS:</b> <b>The</b> <b>Log</b> <b>Viewer</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ARTEMIS</b> - The log viewer

       When a fit is anchored in the Data and Paths list, the log file viewer is displayed in  the  main  panel.
       The  purpose  of this page is to examine log files from the most recent fit or from previous fits.  These
       log files can be read individually or reports can be generated based on their contents.

       When this page is displayed, each fit is entered into the list box on the left side of the page.   Double
       clicking  the  left  mouse  button  on  a fit in the listbox will display that fit's raw log file.  Right
       clicking on a fit will post a menu with choices for displaying that fit's log  file  in  raw,  quick,  or
       columnar form or for performing some other tasks related to that fit.

       Much  more  interesting  than  displaying the log files, though, is to generate reports on the log files.
       Near the top of the page is a combo box for selecting among the parameters on the Guess, Def,  Set  page.
       Choosing one, then clicking on the "Write report" button will find extract that parameters best-fit value
       and uncertainty from each log file.  This feature allows you to track the evolution of individual fitting
       parameters as you develop your fitting model.

       The  combo  box containing the names of the fitting parameters is filled using the contents of the Guess,
       Def, Set page.  Sometimes it may be useful instead to  fill  the  combo  box  with  the  parameter  names
       extracted  from  a  log  file.  This would be useful, for instance, for examining a parameter that is was
       used at one point, but is no longer on the GDS page or has been made into a skip parameter (and so is not
       included in the combo box by default).  To do this, right click on a fit and select  the  "Get  parameter
       list" item.

       Some  modifications can be made to the reports generated by the log viewer.  Clicking on the "Compute the
       average value" button tells <b>Artemis</b> to  compute  the  arithmetic  mean  and  standard  deviation  of  the
       parameter from the values extracted from the various log files.  These will be displayed in the header of
       the report.

       Clicking  on  the  "Fit  Einstein  temperature"  button  will tell <b>Artemis</b> to fit sigma^2 data to a model
       consisting of a single frequency oscillator plus a constant offset.  The report header will then  contain
       the  best  fit  values  and  uncertainties  for the characteristic temperature and constant offset.  This
       calculation will only happen is the figures of merit for the selected log files are temperatures and  the
       best  fit values for the chosen parameter are reasonable sigma^2 values.  This function makes a series of
       checks on the figures of merit and best fit values to determine if they seem to be data  appropriate  for
       this  calculation.   These  heuristics  can  be tuned by setting parameters in the logview section of the
       preferences dialog.

       The final item in the context menu that is displayed when right clicking on an item in the log files list
       is an option to restore that fitting model.  Among the information that is saved every time a fit is made
       is a complete description of the fitting model, including which data file is being fit, the complete list
       of <b>Feff</b> path used, and all fitting, data, and path parameters.  This feature allow you to revert  <b>Artemis</b>
       to  the state it was in when a past fit was made.  When you do this reversion, <b>Artemis</b> will clear out the
       contents of the Data and Paths List and then recreate the project in the form  of  the  selected  fitting
       model.   This  is  more that just a change of parameter values.  <b>Artemis</b> keeps track of all data and <b>Feff</b>
       paths used throughout the course of the  project  and  can  restore  even  fits  that  are  significantly
       different from the current fit.

</pre><h4><b>ARTEMIS:</b> <b>Plotting</b> <b>Data</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ARTEMIS</b> - Plotting data

       Plots  in  <b>Artemis</b>  are  made  using  the  selected  items in the Data and Paths List, which are the ones
       highlighted in orange.  See the main document section for an explanation of how  to  selected  items  for
       plotting.

       At the top of the plot panel are three big, red buttons.  One is for making a plot in k-space, one is for
       R-space, and the third is for q-space (i.e. back-transformed k-space).

   <b>k-Weighting</b>
       Below  the  plot  buttons  are  a  set of radiobuttons for setting the k-weight to use in the plots.  The
       k-weight chosen will be used to weight a plot in k-space or to weight data for Fourier transforming.  The
       same k-weight is used for each selected item.  The button marked "kw" needs some explanation.  When  this
       button is chosen, the k-weight to use in the plot will be determined from the data being plotted.  If the
       arbitrary k-weight enabled for the data set,the value for the arbitrary k-weight will be used, other wise
       the  smallest  k-weight value enabled will be used.  There are two reason to use the "kw" button.  One is
       to plot using your arbitrary weight.  The other is to make a plot of  two  or  more  data  sets  using  a
       different k-weight for each data set.

       Note  that  these k-weight controls are unrelated to the controls which set the k-weight used in the fit.
       K-weighting for fitting and plotting are controlled independently.

   <b>Selecting</b> <b>What</b> <b>Gets</b> <b>Plotted</b>
       Below the k-weight radiobuttons are menus for choosing which part of  the  complex  functions  chi(R)  or
       chi(q)  to  plot.   Plots  involving multiple parts of the complex functions (e.g. real+envelope) are not
       currently possible.

       Below these menus are three checkbuttons used for plotting the Fourier transform window,  the  background
       function,  and  the  residual.   If the window button is pressed, the appropriate window function will be
       plotted in any plot.  The background and residual functions are only plotted if one of the selected items
       is a fit.  The background will only be plotted if a background corefinement was made for that fit.  If  a
       fit  is  not among the selected items, the background and residual will not be plotted.  Note that a plot
       with more than one selected fit may be  quite  confusing  if  the  background  or  residual  buttons  are
       depressed since the background and residual will be plotted for each fit.

       The ranges over which the plot will be made in the three spaces are controlled by the three sets of entry
       boxes.

   <b>Extra</b> <b>Plotting</b> <b>Features</b>
       The two additional tabs in the plotting panel contain the controls for the following utilities:

       <u>Indicators</u>

       Indicators  are  vertical  bars that can be placed at user-chosen locations in k-, R-, or q-space.  These
       indicators will get displayed every time a plot is made.  The idea is that indicators are a guide to  the
       eye, drawing attention to a place of interest as the data being plotted changes.

       Indicators  selected  in either k- or q-space will be plotted in both k- and q-space, but not in R-space.
       Likewise, indicators selected in R-space will not be plotted in k- or q-space.

       Several characteristics of the indicators, including the number, the linetype, and the color, can be  set
       in the Plot section of the preferences dialog.

       The indicators play well with each of the plotting options described below.

       <u>Stacking</u>

       Stacking  refers  to  a  vertical  displacement the various traces.  This is most useful for plotting the
       various path contributions in k-space, but is sometimes useful in other kinds of plots as well.  Stacking
       requires three parameters which are set in the stacking notecard.  The first control is series  of  radio
       buttons  for  choosing  whether  stacking happens in k-space, always, or never.  If the k-space option is
       chosen, then q-space plots of the real  or  imaginary  parts  will  also  be  stacked.   (Basically,  the
       "k-space"  choice  refers  to any wiggly function of wavenumber.)  The other two controls set the initial
       offset value and the increment between staces.

       <u>Inverting</u>

       Inverting is a useful tool for displaying the path contributions  in  "|chi(R)|"  plots.   When  this  is
       selected,  the "|chi(R)|" from any paths included in the plot will be multiplied by -1 so that they stick
       down below the zero-axis.  Hopefully this kind of plot help reduce clutter while still  helping  to  show
       which paths contribut where.  The radiobuttons on this notecard allow you choose between never inverting,
       inverting "|chi(R)|", or inverting both "|chi(R)|" and "|chi(q)|".  The real and imaginary parts in R- or
       q-space are never inverted.  chi(k) is also never inverted.  Inverting is turned off whenever stacking is
       selected and would effect the current plot (i.e. you cannot stack and invert at the same time).

       <u>Data</u> <u>set</u> <u>offsets</u>

       This  feat  ure is useful for multiple data set plots.  This is similar to stacking in that the parameter
       denotes a vertical offset for use i the plot.  Each trace  associated  with  a  particular  data  set  is
       plotted  at  the  same  lavel,  but the data sets will be offset by the amount specified by this control.
       This provides a way of simultaneously visualizing all parts of a multiple data set fit.  Negative  values
       are  recommended, with a negative offset, the traces will be plotted in the same order from top to bottom
       as in the plot legend.

       Stacking is disabled when data set offsets are used.  Inverting is used with data set offsets, although I
       think this results in confusing plots.

       Palettes || Using the Data and Paths List || =head1 ARTEMIS: Editing Math Expressions

       <b>ARTEMIS</b> - Editing math expressions

       The math expression editing dialog is a way of setting path parameter math expressions for many paths  at
       once.   It  works on a given path parameter, e.g. it sets e0 or sigma^2 for many paths but does not touch
       other path parameters.  This dialog is available in two different context menus.  If you right click on a
       path parameter label on the path page and selection "Edit for many paths", then the dialog  will  pop  up
       for  editing  that  parameter.  If you right click on an entry on the <b>Feff</b> interpretation page and select
       the "Edit path parameters" cascade, then select a path parameter, the dialog will pop up for editing that
       parameter.

   <b>Operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dialog</b>
       The dialog is fairly simple.  At the top is a text entry box for typing in your math  expression.   Below
       that  are  various  radiobuttons  for specifying how to apply the math expression to the various paths in
       your project.  The options are:

       1.  Add the math expression to every path in the current <b>Feff</b> calculation.

       2.  Add the math expression to every path in the each <b>Feff</b> calculation.

       3.  Add the math expression to every path in the each <b>Feff</b> calculation associated with the  current  data
           set.

       4.  Add  the math expression to selected paths (i.e. the ones highlighted in orange in the Data and Paths
           list).

   <b>Tokens</b>
       You can write your math expressions using token.  Tokens  are  short  character  strings  which  will  be
       replaced by path-specific information as the math expression is applied to each path.  The tokens are:

       %i  The  path  index  from  the  <b>Feff</b>  calculation.   This  is  actually  computed  from  the name of the
           `feffNNNN.dat' file from the <b>Feff</b> calculation.  For instance, if the file is `feff0029.dat', then  %i
           will expand to 29.

       %I  The  path index from the <b>Feff</b> calculation, padded to fill four characters.  For instance, if the file
           is `feff0029.dat', then %I will expand to 0029.

       %r  The effective path length (or "reff") from the <b>Feff</b> calculation for the path.

       %d  The degeneracy of the path.

       %D  A template for the Debye function.  This always expands to the string  "debye(temp,thetad)"  and  may
           need  be edited after the fact to use the correct variable names.  This is offered because the author
           finds it hard to remember the order of the arguments to the Debye function.

       %E  A template for the Einstein function.  This always expands to the string "eins(temp,thetae)" and  may
           need  be edited after the fact to use the correct variable names.  This is offered because the author
           finds it hard to remember the order of the arguments to the Einstein function.

</pre><h4><b>ARTEMIS:</b> <b>Automated</b> <b>First</b> <b>Shell</b> <b>Theory</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ARTEMIS</b> - Automated first shell theory

       Sometimes thinking about a fitting model is more than a problem merits.  You just want a quick 'n'  dirty
       stab  at  the  first  shell  -- perhaps to measure the centroid of the distribution, perhaps to tell if a
       sample is 4- or 6-coordinated.  Whatever.

       <b>Artemis</b> is not extremely well suited to rapid-fire, first shell analysis.  By design,  <b>Artemis</b>  tends  to
       force the user to slow down and think hard about every step.  <b>Artemis</b> is powerful, but she ain't simple.

       The  quick  first  shell  (QFS)  theory tool is an attempt at addressing this shortcoming.  It works like
       this:

       1.  Import  some  data.   Set  the  Fourier  transform  and  fitting  parameters  to   suitable   values.
           Specifically, be sure to set the fitting range such that it encloses the first peak of the data.

       2.  Select "Quick first shell theory" from the Theory menu.  This will display the QFS dialog.

       3.  The  QFS  dialog provides spaces for selecting the parameters for a simple first shell theory.  These
           include the atomic species of the absorber and the scatterer, the absorption edge of the  experiment,
           the  approximate distance between the absorber and scatterer, and the coordination geometry to use in
           the <b>Feff</b> calculation.

           Currently the following coordination geomatries are available:

           •   4-coordinate crystal

           •   6-coordinate crystal

           •   octahedral molecule

           •   tetrahedral molecule

           •   square-planar molecule

           The QFS theory is probably not highly sensitive to the choice of coordination  geometry.   Since  the
           unknown  sample  is  probably  not  well  described  by  any of these geometries, they are all merely
           approximations for use in a quick 'n' dirty fit.

       4.  Once you have set up the parameters for the QFS theory, click the "Do it!" button.   This  will  step
           through the following without pausing:

           a.  Build an input file for the <b>Feff</b> calculation

           b.  Run <b>Feff</b>

           c.  Import the first path from the <b>Feff</b> calculation

           d.  Create  a  set of guess parameters for the amplitude, the sigma^2, the e0, and the delta R.  Also
               created are set parameters for the third and fourth cumulants, but they are set to  zero.   These
               higher  cumulant  set  parameters  are  created  to  make it easy to consider higher cumulants in
               subsequent fits merely by changing them from set to guess.

       If you have a mixed first shell, you might choose to repeat steps 2 through 4 two or more times.

       At the end of this sequence, you are left with <b>Artemis</b> in its normal state.  You may need to  adjust  the
       parameters  used  in the fit.  The QFS dialog is really just a tool for initially setting up the project.
       It in no way changes the normal operation of <b>Artemis</b>.

       If you import data from an <b>Athena</b> project file, the species of the absorber and  the  edge  will  be  set
       correctly when you start the dialog.
