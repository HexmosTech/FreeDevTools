</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       gnuplot - an interactive plotting program

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>gnuplot</b> [X11 options] [options] [file ...]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Gnuplot</b> is a command-driven interactive plotting program.

       If file names are given on the command line, gnuplot loads and executes each file in the order specified,
       and  exits  after  the  last  file  is processed.  If no files are given, <b>gnuplot</b> prompts for interactive
       commands.

       Here are some of its features:

       Plots any number of functions, built up of C operators, C math  library  functions,  and  some  things  C
       doesn't have like **, sgn(), etc.

       User-defined constants and functions.

       All  computations  performed  in  the  complex  domain.   Just  the  real part is plotted by default, but
       functions like imag() and abs() and arg() are available to override this.

       Many presentation styles for plotting user  data  from  files,  including  surface-fitting,  error  bars,
       boxplots,  histograms,  heat  maps,  and  simple  manipulation  of  image data.  There is an on-line demo
       collection at
       <u><a href="http://gnuplot.info/demo">http://gnuplot.info/demo</a></u>

       Nonlinear least-squares fitting.

       2D and 3D plots with mouse-controlled zooming, rotation, and hypertext.

       Shell escapes and command line substitution.

       Load and save capability.

       Support for a huge variety of output devices and file formats.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-p,</b> <b>--persist</b> lets plot windows survive after main gnuplot program exits.

       <b>-c</b> <b>scriptname</b> <b>ARG1</b> <b>ARG2</b> <b>...,</b> <b>load</b> <b>script</b> <b>using</b> <b>gnuplot's</b> <b>"call"</b> <b>mechanism</b> <b>and</b> <b>pass</b> <b>it</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>remainder</b>  <b>of</b>
       <b>the</b> <b>command</b> <b>line</b> <b>as</b> <b>arguments</b>

       <b>-d,</b>  <b>--default-settings</b> do not read from gnuplotrc, <a href="file:~/.gnuplot">~/.gnuplot</a>, and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnuplot/gnuplotrc on
       entry.

       <b>-e</b> <b>"command</b> <b>list"</b> executes the requested commands before loading the next input file.

       <b>-s,</b> <b>--slow</b> wait for slow font initialization rather than continuing with an error.

       <b>-h,</b> <b>--help</b> print summary of usage

       <b>-V,</b> <b>--version</b> show current version

</pre><h4><b>X11</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       For terminal type x11, <u>gnuplot</u> accepts the standard X Toolkit options and  resources  such  as  geometry,
       font,  and  background.  See  the  <a href="../man1/X.1.html">X</a>(1)  man  page for a description of common options.  For additional X
       options specific to gnuplot, type <u>help</u> <u>x11</u> on the gnuplot command line. These options have no  effect  on
       other terminal types.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       A number of shell environment variables are understood by gnuplot.  None of these are required.

       <b>GNUTERM</b>
              The  name  of  the  terminal type to be used by default.  This can be overridden by the gnuplotrc,
              .gnuplot, or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnuplot/gnuplotrc start-up files and, of course, by  later  explicit
              "set terminal" commands.

       <b>GNUHELP</b>
              The pathname of the HELP file (gnuplot.gih).

       <b>HOME</b>   The name of a directory to search for a .gnuplot file.

       <b>PAGER</b>  An output filter for help messages.

       <b>SHELL</b>  The program used for the "shell" command.

       <b>FIT_SCRIPT</b>
              Specifies a gnuplot command to be executed when a fit is interrupted---see "help fit".

       <b>FIT_LOG</b>
              The name of the logfile maintained by fit.

       <b>GNUPLOT_LIB</b>
              Additional  search  directories  for  data  and  command  files. The variable may contain a single
              directory name, or a list of directories  separated  by  ':'.  The  contents  of  GNUPLOT_LIB  are
              appended to the "loadpath" variable, but not saved with the "save" and "save set" commands.

       <b>GDFONTPATH</b>
              Several  gnuplot  terminal  drivers access TrueType fonts via the gd library.  This variable gives
              the font search path for these drivers.

       <b>GNUPLOT_DEFAULT_GDFONT</b>
              The default font for the terminal drivers that access TrueType fonts via the gd library.

       <b>GNUPLOT_FONTPATH</b>
              The font search path used by the postscript terminal. The format is the same as  for  GNUPLOT_LIB.
              The  contents  of GNUPLOT_FONTPATH are appended to the "fontpath" variable, but not saved with the
              "save" and "save set" commands.

       <b>GNUPLOT_PS_DIR</b>
              Used by the postscript driver to locate external prologue files. Depending on the  build  process,
              gnuplot contains either a builtin copy of those files or simply a default hardcoded path. Use this
              variable  to  test  the  postscript  terminal  with  custom  prologue  files. See "help postscript
              prologue".

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>gnuplotrc</u>
              When gnuplot is run, it first looks for a system-wide initialization file  named  gnuplotrc.   The
              standard location of this file expected by the program is reported by the "show loadpath" command.

       <u>.gnuplot</u>
              After  loading  the  system-wide  initialization  file,  if  any,  Gnuplot  looks  for  a  private
              initialization file in the HOME directory.   It  may  contain  any  legal  gnuplot  commands,  but
              typically  they  are  limited  to  setting  the  preferred  terminal  and  line types and defining
              frequently-used functions or variables.

       <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnuplot/gnuplotrc</u>
              After loading the other initialization files,  Gnuplot  will  check  if  there  is  a  file  named
              gnuplotrc  in  the  gnuplot  subdirectory  in  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME  (default  <a href="file:~/.config">~/.config</a>).   The  same
              restrictions as for .gnuplot apply.

       <u>fit.log</u>
              The default name of the logfile output by the "fit" command.
