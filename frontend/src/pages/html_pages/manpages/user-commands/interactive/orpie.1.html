</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       orpie - is a console-based RPN calculator with an interactive visual stack.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       orpie

</pre><h4><b>QUICK</b> <b>START</b></h4><pre>
       CAUTION:  while  this manpage should be suitable as a quick reference, it may be subject to miscellaneous
       shortcomings in typesetting. The definitive documentation is the user manual provided with Orpie  in  PDF
       format.

       This  section  describes how to use Orpie in its default configuration. After familiarizing yourself with
       the basic operations as outlined in this section, you may wish to consult the <u><a href="../man5/orpierc.5.html">orpierc</a></u>(5) manpage  to  see
       how Orpie can be configured to better fit your needs.

   <b>OVERVIEW</b>
       The interface has two panels. The left panel combines status information with context-sensitive help; the
       right  panel  represents the calculator's stack. (Note that the left panel will be hidden if Orpie is run
       in a terminal with less than 80 columns.)

       In general, you perform calculations by first entering data on to the  stack,  then  executing  functions
       that operate on the stack data. As an example, you can hit 1&lt;enter&gt;2&lt;enter&gt;+ in order to add 1 and 2.

   <b>ENTERING</b> <b>REAL</b> <b>NUMBERS</b>
       To  enter  a real number, just type the desired digits and hit enter. The space bar will begin entry of a
       scientific notation exponent. The 'n' key is used for negation. Here are some examples:

   <b>ENTERING</b> <b>COMPLEX</b> <b>NUMBERS</b>
       Orpie can represent complex numbers using  either  cartesian  (rectangular)  or  polar  coordinates.  See
       PERFORMING BASIC COMMAND OPERATIONS to see how to change the complex number display mode.

       A  complex  number  is  entered  by  first  pressing  '(', then entering the real part, then pressing ','
       followed by the imaginary part. Alternatively, you can press '(' followed  by  the  magnitude,  then  '&lt;'
       followed  by  the  phase  angle.  The  angle  will be interpreted in degrees or radians, depending on the
       current setting of the angle mode (see PERFORMING BASIC COMMAND OPERATIONS).  Examples:

   <b>ENTERING</b> <b>MATRICES</b>
       You can enter matrices by pressing '['. The elements of the matrix may then be entered  as  described  in
       the  previous  sections,  and  should be separated using ','. To start a new row of the matrix, press '['
       again. On the stack, each row of the matrix is enclosed in a set of brackets; for example, the matrix

       would appear on the stack as [[1, 2][3, 4]].

       Examples of matrix entry:

   <b>ENTERING</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>UNITS</b>
       Real and complex scalars and matrices can optionally be labeled with units. After typing in  the  numeric
       portion  of  the  data, press '_' followed by a units string. The format of units strings is described in
       the UNITS FORMATTING section.

       Examples of entering dimensioned data:

   <b>ENTERING</b> <b>EXACT</b> <b>INTEGERS</b>
       An exact integer may be entered by pressing '#' followed by the desired digits. The base of  the  integer
       will  be  assumed  to  be  the  same  as  the  current calculator base mode (see PERFORMING BASIC COMMAND
       OPERATIONS to see how to set this mode).  Alternatively, the desired base may be  specified  by  pressing
       space  and  appending  one  of  {b,  o,  d,  h},  to  represent  binary,  octal, decimal, or hexadecimal,
       respectively. On the stack, the representation of the integer will be changed to match the  current  base
       mode. Examples:

       Note  that  exact  integers  may  have  unlimited  length, and the basic arithmetic operations (addition,
       subtraction, multiplication, division) will be performed using exact arithmetic when both  arguments  are
       integers.

   <b>ENTERING</b> <b>VARIABLE</b> <b>NAMES</b>
       A  variable  name may be entered by pressing '@' followed by the desired variable name string. The string
       may contain alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores. Example:

       Orpie also supports autocompletion of variable names. The help panel  displays  a  list  of  pre-existing
       variables  that  partially  match  the  name  currently  being entered.  You can press '&lt;tab&gt;' to iterate
       through the list of matching variables.

       As a shortcut, keys &lt;f1&gt;-&lt;f4&gt; will enter the variables (``registers'') @ r01 through @ r04.

   <b>ENTERING</b> <b>PHYSICAL</b> <b>CONSTANTS</b>
       Orpie includes definitions for a number of fundamental physical constants. To  enter  a  constant,  press
       'C',  followed  by the first few letters/digits of the constant's symbol, then hit enter. Orpie offers an
       autocompletion feature for physical constants, so you only  need  to  type  enough  of  the  constant  to
       identify  it  uniquely.  A  list  of  matching constants will appear in the left panel of the display, to
       assist you in finding the desired choice.

       The following is a list of Orpie's physical constant symbols:

       All physical constants are defined in the Orpie run-configuration file; consult the <u><a href="../man5/orpierc.5.html">orpierc</a></u>(5) manpage if
       you wish to define your own constants or change the existing definitions.

   <b>ENTERING</b> <b>DATA</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>AN</b> <b>EXTERNAL</b> <b>EDITOR</b>
       Orpie can also parse input entered via an external editor. You may find this to be  a  convenient  method
       for entering large matrices. Pressing 'E' will launch the external editor, and the various data types may
       be entered as illustrated by the examples below:

       Real and complex numbers and matrices may have units appended; just add a units string such as ``_N*m/s''
       immediately following the numeric portion of the expression.

       Notice  that  the  complex matrix input parser is quite flexible; real and complex matrix elements may be
       mixed, and cartesian and polar complex formats may be mixed as well.

       Multiple stack entries may be specified in the same file,  if  they  are  separated  by  whitespace.  For
       example,  entering  (1,  2)  1.5  into the editor will cause the complex value (1, 2) to be placed on the
       stack, followed by the real value 1.5.

       The input parser will discard whitespace where possible, so feel free  to  add  any  form  of  whitespace
       between matrix rows, matrix elements, real and complex components, etc.

   <b>EXECUTING</b> <b>BASIC</b> <b>FUNCTION</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b>
       Once  some  data  has  been entered on the stack, you can apply operations to that data. For example, '+'
       will add the last two elements on the stack. By default, the following  keys  have  been  bound  to  such
       operations:

       As  a  shortcut,  function  operators  will  automatically enter any data that you were in the process of
       entering. So instead of the sequence 2&lt;enter&gt;2&lt;enter&gt;+, you could type simply 2&lt;enter&gt;2+ and  the  second
       number would be entered before the addition operation is applied.

       As  an  additional  shortcut,  any  variable  names  used  as function arguments will be evaluated before
       application of the function. In other words, it is not necessary to evaluate variables before  performing
       arithmetic operations on them.

   <b>EXECUTING</b> <b>FUNCTION</b> <b>ABBREVIATIONS</b>
       One  could  bind  nearly  all  calculator  operations  to specific keypresses, but this would rapidly get
       confusing since the PC keyboard is not labeled as nicely as a calculator keyboard is.  For  this  reason,
       Orpie includes an <u>abbreviation</u> syntax.

       To  activate  an  abbreviation,  press  '''  (quote key), followed by the first few letters/digits of the
       abbreviation, then hit enter. Orpie offers an autocompletion feature for abbreviations, so you only  need
       to  type  enough  of the operation to identify it uniquely. The matching abbreviations will appear in the
       left panel of the display, to assist you in finding the appropriate operation.

       To avoid interface conflicts, abbreviations may be entered only when the entry buffer (the bottom line of
       the screen) is empty.

       The following functions are available as abbreviations:

       Entering abbreviations can  become  tedious  when  performing  repetitive  calculations.   To  save  some
       keystrokes,  Orpie  will  automatically  bind recently-used operations with no prexisting binding to keys
       &lt;f5&gt;-&lt;f12&gt;. The current autobindings can be viewed by pressing 'h' to cycle between the various pages  of
       the help panel.

   <b>EXECUTING</b> <b>BASIC</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>OPERATIONS</b>
       In  addition  to  the  function  operations  listed in the section EXECUTING BASIC FUNCTION OPERATIONS, a
       number of basic calculator commands have been bound to single keypresses:

   <b>EXECUTING</b> <b>COMMAND</b> <b>ABBREVIATIONS</b>
       In addition to the function operations listed in the section EXECUTING FUNCTION ABBREVIATIONS, there  are
       a large number of calculator commands that have been implemented using the abbreviation syntax:

   <b>BROWSING</b> <b>THE</b> <b>STACK</b>
       Orpie  offers a <u>stack</u> <u>browsing</u> <u>mode</u> to assist in viewing and manipulating stack data. Press &lt;up&gt; to enter
       stack browsing mode; this should highlight the last stack element. You can use the up and down arrow keys
       to select different stack elements. The following keys are useful in stack browsing mode:

       The left and right scrolling option may prove useful for viewing very  lengthy  stack  entries,  such  as
       large  matrices.  The  edit option provides a convenient way to correct data after it has been entered on
       the stack.

   <b>UNITS</b> <b>FORMATTING</b>
       A units string is a list of units separated by  '*'  to  indicate  multiplication  and  '/'  to  indicate
       division.  Units  may  be  raised  to real-valued powers using the '^'character. A contrived example of a
       valid unit string would be "N*nm^2*kg/s/in^-3*GHz^2.34".

       Orpie supports the standard SI prefix set, {y, z, a, f, p, n, u, m, c, d, da, h, k, M, G, T, P, E, Z,  Y}
       (note  the  use of 'u' for micro-). These prefixes may be applied to any of the following exhaustive sets
       of units:

       Note: No, Celsius and Fahrenheit will not be supported. Because these temperature units do  not  share  a
       common zero point, their behavior is ill-defined under many operations.

       Note:  Although  the  lumen  is  defined  by  1_lm = 1_cd * sr, Orpie drops the steridian because it is a
       dimensionless unit and therefore is of questionable use to a calculator.

       All units are defined in the Orpie run-configuration file; consult the <u><a href="../man5/orpierc.5.html">orpierc</a></u>(5) manpage if you wish  to
       define your own units or change the existing definitions.
