       lwp-request - Simple command line user agent

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lwp-request</b> [<b>-afPuUsSedvhx</b>] [<b>-m</b> <u>method</u>] [<b>-b</b> <u>base</u> <u>URL</u>] [<b>-t</b> <u>timeout</u>]
                   [<b>-i</b> <u>if-modified-since</u>] [<b>-c</b> <u>content-type</u>]
                   [<b>-C</b> <u>credentials</u>] [<b>-p</b> <u>proxy-url</u>] [<b>-o</b> <u>format</u>] <u>url</u>...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program can be used to send requests to WWW servers and your local file system. The request content
       for POST, PUT and PATCH methods is read from stdin.  The content of the response is printed on stdout.
       Error messages are printed on stderr.  The program returns a status value indicating the number of URLs
       that failed.

       The options are:

       -m &lt;method&gt;
           Set which method to use for the request.  If this option is not used, then the method is derived from
           the name of the program.

       -f  Force  request  through,  even  if the program believes that the method is illegal.  The server might
           reject the request eventually.

       -b &lt;uri&gt;
           This URI will be used as the base URI for resolving all relative URIs given as argument.

       -t &lt;timeout&gt;
           Set the timeout value for the requests.  The timeout is the amount of time that the program will wait
           for a response from the remote server before it fails.  The default unit for  the  timeout  value  is
           seconds.  You might append "m" or "h" to the timeout value to make it minutes or hours, respectively.
           The default timeout is '3m', i.e. 3 minutes.

       -i &lt;time&gt;
           Set  the If-Modified-Since header in the request. If <u>time</u> is the name of a file, use the modification
           timestamp for this file. If <u>time</u> is not a file, it is parsed as  a  literal  date.  Take  a  look  at
           HTTP::Date for recognized formats.

       -c &lt;content-type&gt;
           Set  the Content-Type for the request.  This option is only allowed for requests that take a content,
           i.e. POST, PUT and PATCH.  You can force methods to take content by using the  "-f"  option  together
           with  "-c".   The  default Content-Type for POST is "application/x-www-form-urlencoded".  The default
           Content-type for the others is "text/plain".

       -p &lt;proxy-url&gt;
           Set the proxy to be used  for  the  requests.   The  program  also  loads  proxy  settings  from  the
           environment.  You can disable this with the "-P" option.

       -P  Don't load proxy settings from environment.

       -H &lt;header&gt;
           Send this HTTP header with each request. You can specify several, e.g.:

               lwp-request \
                   -H 'Referer: <a href="http://other.url/">http://other.url/</a>' \
                   -H 'Host: somehost' \
                   <a href="http://this.url/">http://this.url/</a>

       -C &lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;
           Provide  credentials  for  documents  that are protected by Basic Authentication.  If the document is
           protected and you did not specify the username and password  with  this  option,  then  you  will  be
           prompted to provide these values.

       The following options controls what is displayed by the program:

       -u  Print request method and absolute URL as requests are made.

       -U  Print request headers in addition to request method and absolute URL.

       -s  Print response status code.  This option is always on for HEAD requests.

       -S  Print  response  status chain. This shows redirect and authorization requests that are handled by the
           library.

       -e  Print response headers.  This option is always on for HEAD requests.

       -E  Print response status chain with full response headers.

       -d  Do <b>not</b> print the content of the response.

       -o &lt;format&gt;
           Process HTML content in various ways before printing it.  If the content type of the response is  not
           HTML, then this option has no effect.  The legal format values are; "text", "ps", "links", "html" and
           "dump".

           If  you  specify  the  "text"  format then the HTML will be formatted as plain "latin1" text.  If you
           specify the "ps" format then it will be formatted as Postscript.

           The "links" format will output all links found in the HTML document.  Relative links will be expanded
           to absolute ones.

           The "html" format will reformat the HTML code and the "dump" format will just dump  the  HTML  syntax
           tree.

           Note  that  the  "HTML-Tree" distribution needs to be installed for this option to work.  In addition
           the "HTML-Format" distribution needs to be installed for "-o text" or "-o ps" to work.

       -v  Print the version number of the program and quit.

       -h  Print usage message and quit.

       -a  Set text(ascii) mode for content input and output.  If this option is not  used,  content  input  and
           output is done in binary mode.

       Because  this  program  is implemented using the LWP library, it will only support the protocols that LWP
       supports.
