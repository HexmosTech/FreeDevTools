       grid-cert-request - Generate a X.509 certificate request and corresponding private key

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>grid-cert-request</b> -help | -h | -? | -usage | -version | -versions

       <b>grid-cert-request</b> [OPTIONS]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>grid-cert-request</b> program generates an X.509 Certificate Request and corresponding private key for
       the specified name, host, or service. It is intended to be used with a CA implemented using the
       <b>globus_simple_ca</b> package.

       The default behavior of <b>grid-cert-request</b> is to generate a certificate request and private key for the
       user running the command. The subject name is derived from the gecos information in the local system’s
       password database, unless the <u>-commonname</u>, <u>-cn</u>, or <u>-host</u> command-line options are used.

       By default, <b>grid-cert-request</b> writes user certificate requests and keys to the $HOME/.globus directory,
       and host and service certificate requests and keys to /etc/grid-security. This can be overridden by using
       the <u>-dir</u> command-line option.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The full set of command-line options to <b>grid-cert-request</b> are:

       <b>-help,</b> <b>-h,</b> <b>-?,</b> <b>-usage</b>
           Display the command-line options to <b>grid-cert-request</b> and exit.

       <b>-version,</b> <b>-versions</b>
           Display the version number of the <b>grid-cert-request</b> command. The second form includes more details.

       <b>-cn</b> <u>NAME</u><b>,</b> <b>-commonname</b> <u>NAME</u>
           Create a certificate request with the common name component of the subject set to <u>NAME</u>. This is used
           to create user identity certificates.

       <b>-dir</b> <u>DIRECTORY</u>
           Write the certificate request and key to files in the directory specified by <u>DIRECTORY</u>.

       <b>-prefix</b> <u>PREFIX</u>
           Use the string <u>PREFIX</u> as the base name of the certificate, certificate_request, and key files instead
           of the default. For a user certificate request, this would mean creating files
           $HOME/.globus/'PREFIX’cert_request.pem, $HOME/.globus/'PREFIX’cert.pem, and
           $HOME/.globus/'PREFIX’key.pem.

       <b>-ca</b> <u>CA-HASH</u>
           Use the certificate request configuration for the CA with the name hash <u>CA-HASH</u> instead of the
           default CA chosen by running <b>grid-default-ca</b>.

       <b>-verbose</b>
           Keep the output from the OpenSSL certificate request command visible after it completes, instead of
           clearing the screen.

       <b>-interactive,</b> <b>-int</b>
           Prompt for each component of the subject name of the request, instead of generating the common name
           from other command-line options. Note that CAs may not sign certificates for subject names that don’t
           match their signing policies.

       <b>-force</b>
           Overwrite any existing certificate request and private key with a new one.

       <b>-nopw,</b> <b>-nodes,</b> <b>-nopassphrase</b>
           Create an unencrypted private key for the certificate instead of prompting for a passphrase. This is
           the default behavior for host or service certificates, but not recommended for user certificates.

       <b>-host</b> <u>FQDN</u>
           Create a certificate request for use on a particular host. This option also causes the private key
           associated with the certificate request to be unencrypted. The <u>FQDN</u> argument to this option should be
           the fully qualified domain name of the host that will use this certificate. The subject name of the
           certificate will be derived from the <u>FQDN</u> and the service option if specified by the <u>-service</u>
           command-line option. If the host for the certificate has multiple names, then use either the <u>-dns</u> or
           <u>-ip</u> command-line options to add alternate names or addresses to the certificates.

       <b>-service</b> <u>SERVICE</u>
           Create a certificate request for a particular service on a host. The subject name of the certificate
           will be derived from the <u>FQDN</u> passed as the argument to the <u>-host</u> command-line option and the <u>SERVICE</u>
           string.

       <b>-dns</b> <u>FQDN,...</u>
           Create a certificate request containing a subjectAltName extension containing one or more host names.
           This is used when a certificate may be used by multiple virtual servers or if a host has different
           names when contacted within or outside a private network. Multiple DNS names can be included in the
           extension by separating then with a comma.

       <b>-ip</b> <u>IP-ADDRESS,...</u>
           Create a certificate request containing a subjectAltName extension containing the IP addresses named
           by the <u>IP-ADDRESS</u> strings. This is used when a certificate may be used by services listening on
           multiple networks. Multiple IP addresses can be included in the extension by separating then with a
           comma.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Create a user certificate request: % <b>grid-cert-request</b> A certificate request and private key is being
       created. You will be asked to enter a PEM pass phrase. This pass phrase is akin to your account password,
       and is used to protect your key file. If you forget your pass phrase, you will need to obtain a new
       certificate. A private key and a certificate request has been generated with the subject:

           /O=org/OU=example/OU=grid/CN=Joe User

           If the CN=Joe User is not appropriate, rerun this
           script with the -force -cn "Common Name" options.

           Your private key is stored in /home/juser/.globus/userkey.pem
           Your request is stored in /home/juser/.globus/usercert_request.pem

           Please e-mail the request to the Example CA <a href="mailto:ca@grid.example.org">ca@grid.example.org</a>
           You may use a command similar to the following:

           cat /home/juser/.globus/usercert_request.pem | mail <a href="mailto:ca@grid.example.org">ca@grid.example.org</a>

           Only use the above if this machine can send AND receive e-mail. if not, please
           mail using some other method.

               Your certificate will be mailed to you within two working days.
           If you receive no response, contact Example CA at <a href="mailto:ca@grid.example.org">ca@grid.example.org</a>

       Create a host certificate for a host with two names.

           % *grid-cert-request -host grid.example.org -dns grid.example.org,grid-internal.example.org*
           A private host key and a certificate request has been generated
           with the subject:

           /O=org/OU=example/OU=grid/CN=host/grid.example.org

           ----------------------------------------------------------

           The private key is stored in /etc/grid-security/hostkey.pem
           The request is stored in /etc/grid-security/hostcert_request.pem

           Please e-mail the request to the Example CA <a href="mailto:ca@grid.example.org">ca@grid.example.org</a>
           You may use a command similar to the following:

           cat /etc/grid-security/hostcert_request.pem | mail <a href="mailto:ca@grid.example.org">ca@grid.example.org</a>

           Only use the above if this machine can send AND receive e-mail. if not, please
           mail using some other method.
