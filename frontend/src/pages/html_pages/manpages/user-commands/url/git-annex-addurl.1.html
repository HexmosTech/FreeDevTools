</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       git-annex-addurl - add urls to annex

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       git annex addurl <b>[url</b> <b>...]</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Downloads each url to its own file, which is added to the annex.

       When  <b>yt-dlp</b>  is  installed,  it can be used to check for a video embedded in  a web page at the url, and
       that is added to the annex instead.  (However, this is disabled by default as it can be a security  risk.
       See the documentation of annex.security.allowed-ip-addresses in <a href="../man1/git-annex.1.html">git-annex</a>(1) for details.)

       Special  remotes  can  add other special handling of particular urls. For example, the bittorrent special
       remotes makes urls to torrent files (including magnet links) download the content of the  torrent,  using
       <b>aria2c</b>.

       Normally  the  filename is based on the full url, so will look like "www.example.com_dir_subdir_bigfile".
       In some cases, addurl is able to come up with a better filename based on other information.  Options  can
       also be used to get better filenames.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>--fast</b>

              Avoid  immediately  downloading  the  url.  The  url is still checked (via HEAD) to verify that it
              exists, and to get its size if possible.

       <b>--relaxed</b>
              Don't immediately download the url, and avoid storing the size of the url's  content.  This  makes
              git-annex accept whatever content is there at a future point.

              This  is  the  fastest option, but it still has to access the network to check if the url contains
              embedded media. When adding large numbers of urls, using <b>--relaxed</b> <b>--raw</b> is much faster.

       <b>--verifiable</b> <b>-V</b>
              This can be used with the <b>--fast</b> or <b>--relaxed</b> option. It improves  the  safety  of  the  resulting
              annexed  file,  by  letting its content be verified with a checksum when it is transferred between
              git-annex repositories, as well as by things like <b>git-annex</b> <b>fsck</b>.

              When used with --relaxed, content from the web will always be accepted, even if  it  has  changed,
              and the checksum recorded for later verification.

              When  used with --fast, the checksum is recorded the first time the content is downloaded from the
              web. Once a checksum has been recorded, subsequent downloads from  the  web  must  have  the  same
              checksum.

              When  addurl  was  used  without  this  option  before,  the  file it added can be converted to be
              verifiable by migrating it to the VURL backend.  For example: <b>git-annex</b> <b>migrate</b> <b>foo</b> <b>--backend=VURL</b>

       <b>--raw</b>  Prevent special handling of urls by yt-dlp, and by bittorrent and other special remotes. This will
              for example, make addurl download the .torrent file and not the contents it points to.

       <b>--no-raw</b>
              Require content pointed to by the url to be downloaded using yt-dlp or a  special  remote,  rather
              than the raw content of the url. if that cannot be done, the add will fail.

       <b>--raw-except=remote</b>
              Prevent  special  handling  of  urls by all special remotes except for the specified one. To allow
              special handling only by yt-dlp, use <b>--raw-except=web</b>.

       <b>--file=name</b>
              Use with a filename that does not yet exist to add a new file with  the  specified  name  and  the
              content downloaded from the url.

              If  the  file  already  exists,  addurl  will  record that it can be downloaded from the specified
              url(s).

       <b>--preserve-filename</b>
              When the web server (or torrent, etc) provides a  filename,  use  it  as-is,  avoiding  sanitizing
              unusual characters, or truncating it to length, or any other modifications.

              git-annex  will  still  check  the filename for safety, and if the filename has a security problem
              such as path traversal or a control character, it will refuse to add it.

       <b>--pathdepth=N</b>
              Rather than basing the filename on the whole url, this causes a path to be  constructed,  starting
              at the specified depth within the path of the url.

              For  example, adding the url <a href="http://www.example.com/dir/subdir/bigfile">http://www.example.com/dir/subdir/bigfile</a> with <b>--pathdepth=1</b> will use
              "dir/subdir/bigfile", while <b>--pathdepth=3</b> will use "bigfile".

              It can also be negative; <b>--pathdepth=-2</b> will use the last two parts of the url.

       <b>--prefix=foo</b> <b>--suffix=bar</b>
              Use to adjust the filenames that are created by addurl. For example, <b>--suffix=.mp3</b> can be used  to
              add an extension to the file.

       <b>--no-check-gitignore</b>
              By  default,  gitignores are honored and it will refuse to download an url to a file that would be
              ignored. This makes such files be added despite any ignores.

       <b>--jobs=N</b> <b>-JN</b>
              Enables parallel downloads when multiple urls are being added.  For example: <b>-J4</b>

              Setting this to "cpus" will run one job per CPU core.

       <b>--batch</b>
              Enables batch mode, in which lines containing urls to add are read from stdin.

       <b>-z</b>     Makes the <b>--batch</b> input be delimited by nulls instead of the usual newlines.

       <b>--with-files</b>
              When batch mode is enabled, makes it parse lines of the form: "$url $file"

              That adds the specified url to the specified file, downloading its content if the  file  does  not
              yet exist; the same as <b>git</b> <b>annex</b> <b>addurl</b> <b>$url</b> <b>--file</b> <b>$file</b>

       <b>--json</b> Enable  JSON  output.  This  is intended to be parsed by programs that use git-annex. Each line of
              output is a JSON object.

       <b>--json-progress</b>
              Include progress objects in JSON output.

       <b>--json-error-messages</b>
              Messages that would normally be output to standard error are included in the JSON instead.

       <b>--backend</b>
              Specifies which key-value backend to use.

       Also the <a href="../man1/git-annex-common-options.1.html">git-annex-common-options</a>(1) can be used.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       If annex.largefiles is configured, and does not match a file, git annex addurl  will  add  the  non-large
       file  directly  to  the git repository, instead of to the annex. However, this is not done when --fast or
       --relaxed is used.
