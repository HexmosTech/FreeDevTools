           Create destination directory if needed.

       <b>-r</b>
           Copy files in subdirectories

       <b>-fast</b>
           Recommended when using GridFTP servers. Use MODE E for all data transfers, including reusing data
           channels between list and transfer operations.

       <b>-t</b> <b>SECONDS</b>
           Run the transfer for this number of seconds and then end. Useful for performance testing or forced
           restart loops.

       <b>-v,</b> <b>-verbose</b>
           Display URLs being transferred

       <b>-vb,</b> <b>-verbose-perf</b>
           During the transfer, display the number of bytes transferred and the transfer rate per second. Show
           URLs being transferred

       <b>-dbg,</b> <b>-debugftp</b>
           Debug ftp connections. Prints control channel communication to stderr

       <b>-rst,</b> <b>-restart</b>
           Restart failed ftp operations.

       <b>-rst-retries</b> <b>RETRIES</b>
           The maximum number of times to retry the operation before giving up on the transfer. Use 0 for
           infinite. Default is 5.

       <b>-rst-interval</b> <b>SECONDS</b>
           The interval in seconds to wait after a failure before retrying the transfer. Use 0 for an
           exponential backoff. Default is 0.

       <b>-rst-timeout</b> <b>SECONDS</b>
           Maximum time after a failure to keep retrying. Use 0 for no timeout. Default is 0.

       <b>-stall-timeout</b> <b>SECONDS,</b> <b>-st</b> <b>SECONDS</b>
           How long before cancelling/restarting a transfer with no data movement. Set to 0 to disable. Default
           is 600 seconds.

       <b>-df</b> <b>FILENAME,</b> <b>-dumpfile</b> <b>FILENAME</b>
           Path to a file where untransferred URLs will be saved for later restarting. Resulting file is the
           same format as the -f input file. If file exists, it will be read and all other URL input will be
           ignored.

       <b>-do</b> <b>FILENAME,</b> <b>-dump-only</b> <b>FILENAME</b>
           Perform no write operations on the destination. Instead, all files that would be transferred are
           enumerated and dumped to the specified file. Resulting file is the same format as the -f input file.
           Note: if you intend to use this file as input for a future transfer, the -create-dest option will be
           required if any destination directories do not already exist.

       <b>-rp,</b> <b>-relative-paths</b>
           The path portion of ftp URLs will be interpreted as relative to the userâ€™s starting directory on the
           server. By default, all paths are root-relative. When this flag is set, the path portion of the ftp
           URL must start with %2F if it designates a root-relative path.

       <b>-s</b> <b>SUBJECT,</b> <b>-subject</b> <b>SUBJECT</b>
           Use this subject to match with both the source and dest servers.

       <b>-ss</b> <b>SUBJECT,</b> <b>-source-subject</b> <b>SUBJECT</b>

           Set data channel protection mode to SAFE

       <b>-dcpriv,</b> <b>-data-channel-private</b>
           Set data channel protection mode to PRIVATE

           <b>Warning</b>

           Despite having -dcpriv in its command line globus-url-copy will silently fall back to an unencryted
           data channel when connected to a server that does not support data channel encryption (e.g. dCache)!

       <b>-dcstack</b> <b>STACK,</b> <b>-data-channel-stack</b> <b>STACK</b>
           Set the XIO driver stack for the network on both the source and the destination. Both must be GridFTP
           servers. The stack should contain all network drivers to use, in the order specified from bottom to
           top (e.g. -dcstack tcp,gsi). If the gsi driver is not included in the stack and data channel
           authentication is enabled, it will be inserted above the transport driver in the stack.

       <b>-fsstack</b> <b>STACK,</b> <b>-file-system-stack</b> <b>STACK</b>
           Set the XIO driver stack for the disk on both the source and the destination. Both must be GridFTP

       <b>-dst-fsstack</b> <b>STACK,</b> <b>-dest-file-system-stack</b> <b>STACK</b>
           Set the XIO driver stack for the disk on the destination GridFTP server. See -fsstack above for
           description of the STACK string.

       <b>-cred</b> <b>PATH</b>
           Set the credentials to use for both ftp connections.

       <b>-src-cred</b> <b>CRED-FILE,</b> <b>-sc</b> <b>CRED-FILE</b>

       <b>-af</b> <b>FILENAME,</b> <b>-alias-file</b> <b>FILENAME</b>
           File with mapping of logical host aliases to lists of physical hosts. When used with multiple
           concurrent connections, each connection uses the next host in the list. Each line should either be an
           alias, noted with the @ symbol, or a hostname[:port]. Currently, only the aliases @source and
           @destination are valid, and they are used for every source or destination URL.

       <b>-sync</b>
           Only transfer files where the destination does not exist or differs from the source. -sync-level
           controls how to determine if files differ.

       <b>-sync-level</b> <b>number</b>
           Criteria for determining if files differ when performing a sync transfer. The default sync level is
           2. The available levels are:

           â€¢   Level 0 will only transfer if the destination does not exist.

           â€¢   Level 1 will transfer if the size of the destination does not match the size of the source.

           â€¢   Level 2 will transfer if the time stamp of the destination is older than the time stamp of the
               source.

           â€¢   Level 3 will perform a checksum of the source and destination and transfer if the checksums do
               not match. The default algorithm used for this checksum is MD5, but other algorithms can be
               specified with the <b>-algo</b> parameter.

       <b>-checksum-alg</b> <b>CHECKSUM-ALGORITHM</b>
           Set the algorithm type to use for all checksum operations during the transfer.

       <b>-verify-checksum</b>
           Perform a checksum on the source and destination after each file transfer and compare the two. If
           they do not match, fail the transfer. The default algorithm used for this checksum is MD5, but other
           algorithms can be specified with the <b>-checksum-alg</b> parameter.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The following environment variables are recognized:

       <b>GLOBUS_HOSTNAME</b>
           Overrides client hostname communicated to the server

       <b>GLOBUS_DOMAIN_NAME</b>
           Overrides client domainname communicated to the server

       <b>GLOBUS_FTP_CLIENT_DATA_IP</b>
           Overwrites client IP address communicated to the server for the data connection. Used when the
           receiver is behind a NAT and should be configured to the external address of its gateway.

       <b>GLOBUS_FTP_CLIENT_SOURCE_PASV</b>
           Configures sender side (source) instead of receiver side (destination) to open a data port and
           establishes the data connection from the receiver to the sender. By default the data connection is
           established from sender to receiver, but if the receiver is behind a NAT this doesnâ€™t work, because
           the receiver will communicate its own address instead of the external address of its gateway to the
           sender and its own address canâ€™t be reached directly from the sender.
