</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       llvm-bcanalyzer - LLVM bitcode analyzer

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>llvm-bcanalyzer</b> [<u>options</u>] [<u>filename</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>llvm-bcanalyzer</b>  command  is  a small utility for analyzing bitcode files.  The tool reads a bitcode
       file (such as generated with the <b>llvm-as</b> tool) and produces a statistical report on the contents  of  the
       bitcode  file.   The tool can also dump a low level but human readable version of the bitcode file.  This
       tool is probably not of much interest or utility except for those working directly with the bitcode  file
       format.  Most LLVM users can just ignore this tool.

       If <u>filename</u> is omitted or is <b>-</b>, then <b>llvm-bcanalyzer</b> reads its input from standard input.  This is useful
       for combining the tool into a pipeline.  Output is written to the standard output.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-nodetails</b>
              Causes  <b>llvm-bcanalyzer</b>  to abbreviate its output by writing out only a module level summary.  The
              details for individual functions are not displayed.

       <b>-dump</b>  Causes <b>llvm-bcanalyzer</b>  to  dump  the  bitcode  in  a  human  readable  format.   This  format  is
              significantly  different from LLVM assembly and provides details about the encoding of the bitcode
              file.

       <b>-verify</b>
              Causes <b>llvm-bcanalyzer</b> to verify the module produced by reading the bitcode.   This  ensures  that
              the statistics generated are based on a consistent module.

       <b>-help</b>  Print a summary of command line options.

</pre><h4><b>EXIT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       If  <b>llvm-bcanalyzer</b>  succeeds,  it  will exit with 0.  Otherwise, if an error occurs, it will exit with a
       non-zero value, usually 1.

</pre><h4><b>SUMMARY</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>DEFINITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following items are always printed by llvm-bcanalyzer.  They comprize the summary output.

</pre><h4><b>DETAILED</b> <b>OUTPUT</b> <b>DEFINITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following definitions occur only if the  -nodetails  option  was  not  given.   The  detailed  output

          The  total number of bytes saved in this function by using the Variable Bit Rate encoding scheme.  The
          percentage is relative to # of VBR Expanded Bytes.
