       uniconv - convert text to native formats through Unicode

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>uniconv</b> <b>-out</b> <u>output-file</u> [ <b>-decode</b> <u>input-encoding</u> ] [ <b>-encode</b> <u>output-encoding</u> ] [ <u>input-file</u> ] [ <u>-todos</u> ]
       [ <u>-fromdos</u> ] [ <u>-tomac</u> ] [ <u>-frommac</u> ]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>uniconv</b> program decodes scripts with a certain encoding encodes them with some other encoding.  The scipt
       is a 16,8 or 7 bit-byte stream.  The converted text  will be sent to the standard output, even in case of
       16-bit encoding methods,unless the output file is specified by the <b>-out</b> option.

       The  <b>-decode</b>  and  <b>-encode</b>  options  are optional, the default converter is utf-8.  The program reads the
       Unicode map helper files (*.my) from the  default  directory  /usr/share/data.   Simple  1-to-1  encoding
       methods  can  be  added  on  the  fly  by  adding a a my-file, or setting your yudit.datapath property in
       <a href="file:~/.yudit/yudit.properties">~/.yudit/yudit.properties</a> or /usr/share/yudit/config/yudit.properties.  By default  /usr/share/yudit/data
       and <a href="file:~/.yudit/data">~/.yudit/data</a> are searched.

       My-files  can  be created by a program called The files can be converted between dos/unix/mac line-ending
       variants with <b>-fromdos,</b> <b>-frommac,</b> <b>-todos,</b> <b>-tomac</b> options. the  default  (not  scpecified  one)  is  Unix.

</pre><h4><b>ENCODING</b></h4><pre>
       If you received this program through the Yudit distribution, then as of today you can convert between the
       encoding methods below.

       <b>utf-8</b>  Yudit  recommends  this  format  for  international  information  exchange.  ASCII text  will  get
              through  intact, while other Unicode characters will get their 8th bit set and the length  of  the
              code  will depend on how far away they are in the Unicode space.  This is the only  transformation
              format that can encode both 16-bit (ucs-2) and 31-bit (ucs-4) Unicode.

       <b>utf-8-s</b>
              Hackers  utf-8  format - it does not give an error message when a surrogate pair is decoded and it
              can encode a surrogate pair 'as is'.  This is not a  recommended  encoding  format  although  this
              format is used to encode/decode clipboard data, in order to preserve input.

       <b>utf-16</b> Although 16 is bigger than 8 this is still a compromise required by OSes like Windows that can not
              handle  ucs-4  - this encoding produces 16-bit Unicode streams.  In addition to BMP it can convert
              16 planes using the Unicode Surrogate Area.  This encoding can not convert anything above U+10FFFF
              (Plane 16).  The input byte order is recognized by the first two characters BEM  (byte-order-mark)
              U+FEFF. This format is used in Windows NT for documents like notepad .txt files.

       <b>utf-16-be</b>
              Big endian utf-16 converter.

       <b>utf-16-le</b>
              Littlen endian utf-16 converter.

       <b>utf-7</b>  This  is  the  recommended  format  for international information exchange, when 7-bit can only be
              used. It can only handle 16-bit (utf-16) Unicode, for ucs-4 (above U+10FFFF) you should use  utf-8
              encoding.

              supplementary  encoding.   Widely  used  in  Korean  MS-DOS until mid-1990's.  It can  encode  all
              Hangul syllables(11,172) of modern Korean as well as all the special symbols  and  Hanja  (Chinese

              script  as  well as all the special symbols and Hanja (Chinese ideograms used in Korea) defined in
              KS X 1001.

       <b>gb-18030</b>
              This is a  Chinese  character  encoding  format  based  upon  GB  18030.   It  encodes  the  whole
              U+0000..U+10FFFF range, while being compatible with gb-2312.

       <b>gb-2312-x11</b>
              This is a Chinese character encoding format based upon GB 2312.  It is a 7-bit encoding format.

       <b>gb-2312</b>
              This is a Chinese character encoding format based upon GB 2312.  It is an 8-bit encoding format.

       <b>big-5</b>  This  is  a  Chinese  character encoding format based upon BIG5 encoding.  It is an 8-bit encoding
              format.

       <b>hz</b>     This is a Chinese character encoding format based upon "Hanzi" encoding.  It is a  7-bit  encoding
              format.

       <b>viscii</b> This is a Vietnamese character encoding format.

       <b>ucs-2-be</b>
              This  converts 16-bit Unicode (ucs-2) streams. The format takes care of big-endian variant.  Yudit
              does not recommend this format.

       <b>ucs-2-le</b>
              This converts 16-bit Unicode (ucs-2) streams. The format  takes  care  of  little-endian  variant.
              Yudit does not recommend this format.

       <b>ucs-2</b>  This converts 16-bit Unicode (ucs-2) streams.  The input byte order is recognized by the first two
              characters BEM (byte-order-mark) U+FEFF.  Yudit does not recommend this format.

       <b>java</b>   This converts \uxxxx character escapes. When encoding, all characters above U+0080 will be escaped
              with  a  string  like  '\u0080'.  When decoding the same format is decoded but, in addition, utf-8
              format is also recognized, so it can also be used to recover  data  accidentally  saved  with  the
              wrong encoding. The U+10000..U+10FFFF area is converted to surrogates and vice versa.

       <b>java-s</b> This converts \uxxxx character escapes. When encoding, all characters above U+0080 will be escaped
              with  a  string  like  '\u0080'.  When decoding the same format is decoded but, in addition, utf-8
              format is also recognized, so it can also be used to recover  data  accidentally  saved  with  the
              wrong  encoding.  Surrogates are not treated specially during conversion - this is why it is not a
              recommended conversion.
