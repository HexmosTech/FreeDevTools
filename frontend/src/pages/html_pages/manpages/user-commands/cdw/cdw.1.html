</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cdw - front-end for cdrecord, mkisofs, growisofs, mkudffs and other tools

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       cdw [--help] [--version] [--enable-dvd-rp-dl] [--escdelay=X]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       cdw  is  a front-end for command-line tools used for burning data CD and DVD discs and for related tasks.
       The tools are: cdrecord/wodim, mkisofs/genisoimage, growisofs, dvd+rw-mediainfo, dvd+rw-format,  xorriso.
       You  can  also  use cdw to rip tracks from your audio CD to raw audio files.  Limited support for copying
       content of CD and DVD discs to image files is also provided. cdw can utilize  md5sum  program  to  verify
       correctness  of writing ISO image to CD and DVD disc. cdw can be also used to create UDF image file using
       mkudffs.

       cdw uses ncurses library to build user-friendly interface and it can be used in UNIX terminal window  and
       in terminal emulator (like konsole, rxvt or gnome-console) in X environment.

       cdw  supports  ISO9660  file  system for optical media: ISO9660 file system can be written to stand-alone
       .iso file, or burned to optical disc.  cdw also supports UDF file system: UDF file system can be  written
       to  stand-alone  .udf file. Currently there is no support for burning UDF file system directly to optical
       disc.  Other filesystem for optical media are not supported nor recognized.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>MEDIA</b></h4><pre>
       Scope of supported features depends on which tools are installed on  end  user's  system.  Full  list  of
       supported media and actions is listed below.

       CD-AUDIO
              ripping audio tracks to raw audio files

       CD-R   writing  files and ISO images (single- and multi-session) with cdrecord/wodim and xorriso; copying
              content of first session to image file on your hard disc

       CD-RW  writing files and ISO images (single- and multi-session), erasing (erasing only  TOC  or  blanking
              whole  disc)  with  cdrecord/wodim  and xorriso; copying content of first session to image file on
              your hard disc

       DVD-R, DVD+R
              writing files and ISO images (multi-session, but without closing  disc,  or  single-session)  with
              cdrecord/wodim, dvd+rw-tools and xorriso

       DVD-RW writing  files  and  ISO  images (multi-session or single-session); erasing, formatting - quick or
              slow (full) method; dvd+rw-tools only.  <b>WARNING</b>: multiple blanking may quickly render your  DVD-RW
              unusable.

       DVD+RW writing  files  and  ISO  images  (both  writing to disc from scratch and appending data), without
              closing disc; blanking disc, but takes lots of time, and you don't need to do it anyway - you  can
              always start writing to the same disc like you would write to blank disc. DVD+RW can be handled by
              both cdrecord/wodim and dvd+rw-tools. Notice that when using wodim you may encounter problems.

       DVD+R DL
              there  is  now  partial  support  for  DVD+R  DL discs: cdw can burn ISO image and files in single
              session. User has to explicitly enable it by passing "--enable-dvd-rp-dl" command line argument to
              cdw; cdw can handle DVD+R DL discs only using dvd+rw-tools; this feature is  very  incomplete  and
              possibly buggy.

              Dual-layer  media  other  than DVD+R DL are not yet supported.  DVD-RAM, Blu-ray, HD-DVD discs are
              not supported.

</pre><h4><b>MANUAL</b></h4><pre>
       You can write data discs either by using previously created ISO image file, or by  selecting  files  from
       hard drive and writing them directly to disc.  cdw provides UI elements for both actions.

       First action before creating new ISO/UDF image or writing files to disc is selecting files from your hard
       drive. You can do this by selecting "Add files" in left-hand menu. You will be presented with simple file
       selector.   Use  Up/Down arrows or Page Up/Page Down keys to move, Enter key to change current directory,
       Space key to select files or directories. Selected items will be added to list displayed in main  window.
       Use  Escape  key  to  close file selector window. The selector window shows you all files and directories
       (including hidden files) in current directory. You will see file size information for every file  on  the
       list.  You  can  also delete previously selected files from list: select "Delete files" from the menu and
       use Up/Down arrow keys to move and Delete key to delete highlighted item. Use Escape key when you  finish
       deleting files from list of selected files.

       Now  you  can  select  "Create image" from left-hand menu. cdw will display a wizard window where you can
       change most common options for creating ISO9660 or UDF image, and where you can  select  path  to  target
       image file on your hard disc.

       You  can  also  select  "Write  files to disc" to write selected files to optical disc. If you select the
       option, cdw will display a wizard dialog window, in which you can adjust most common options  related  to
       burning files to disc (for this function only ISO9660 file system is supported).

       If  you want to write ISO image file to optical disc, use "Write image to disc" option in left hand menu.
       You will be presented with file picker dialog that allows you to select existing ISO image file from your
       hard disc. After that cdw will display a  wizard  window,  where  you  can  modify  most  common  options
       available for burning a disc.

       cdw  allows  you  to verify correctness of this operation by checking a digest (e.g. md5 sum) of ISO file
       and of track written to disc.  You can request this by checking "Verify write" checkbox that will  appear
       in write wizard. Please note that this checkbox is visible only when you are writing ISO file to empty CD
       or  DVD  disc.  This  function is still experimental. Make sure that a program for calculating digests is
       installed on your machine. cdw supports following programs: md5sum sha1sum sha224sum sha256sum  sha384sum
       sha512sum

       Another  operation you can perform is erasing optical disc - CD-RW, DVD-RW (both Sequential Recording and
       Restricted Overwrite) or DVD+RW. You can do this by selecting "Erase disc" option in cdw left-hand  menu.
       Please  note  that extensive erasing of DVD-RW may render your disc unusable. In case of CD-RW and DVD-RW
       you will be asked what type of blanking you want to perform. You can choose fast mode or full mode. First
       one doesn't take too much time (in case of CD-RW it only erases table of content of  your  disc),  second
       one can be very time-consuming, depending on disc size and selected speed.

       When  you  will  attempt  to  blank DVD-RW disc, blanking wizard will display dropdown that allows you to
       choose mode (format) of DVD-RW disc: Restricted Overwrite or Sequential Recording.

       cdw can be useful when you want to copy your data CD or DVD to ISO image on your hard drive. You do  this
       by  selecting  "Read  disc" option from left-hand menu. This function allows you to copy first track from
       your data CD or DVD. Reading second and following tracks from data discs, and reading  discs  written  in
       mixed mode (one or more data tracks + audio tracks) are not supported.

       You  can  also  use  cdw  to copy your audio CD to separate files (each track will be written to separate
       file). You do this by selecting "Read disc" option from menu. cdw  can't  convert  audio  tracks  to  any
       popular  audio  format.  The  tracks  are  written  to  files  in the same format as they appear on CD (2
       channels, 44100 samples per second, 16 bit signed PCM,  little  endian  (intel)).  The  file  names  have
       following  name  format:  track_xx.raw  (where xx is track number). You can convert raw track file to wav
       file using e.g. sox command:

       <b>sox</b> <b>-c</b> <b>2</b> <b>-r</b> <b>44100</b> <b>-L</b> <b>-2</b> <b>-s</b> <b>track_name.raw</b> <b>-t</b> <b>wav</b> <b>track_name.wav</b>

       The last operation that cdw offers is verification of data. You can use it for two purposes:

              •  calculating a digest of selected file from hard disc;

              •  comparing selected file with content of first track on optical disc;  The  second  option  also
                 utilizes  digest  tool  (e.g.  md5sum),  but  may not work correctly, so it is marked in cdw as
                 "Experimental".

       cdw has Configuration window, accessed by selecting "Configuration" item in left-hand  menu.  The  window
       allows  you  to  set  up some options for tools used by cdw, and for cdw itself. Configuration window has
       following tabs (you can access them using keys F2-F6):

              •  Log and misc - contains options related to log file in which cdw logs its  operations,  and  to
                 some aspects of behavior of cdw.

              •  Tools  -  options in this tab allow you to select tools from your operating system that will be
                 used to create ISO9660 images, burn data to disc etc. You can  safely  leave  "Configure  tools
                 manually" checkbox unmarked.

              •  Audio - contains options related to ripping audio CDs.

              •  Hardware  - probably will be visited only once, when you use cdw for the first time or when you
                 change your hardware configuration.  Here you can set paths to your devices used by cdw.

              •  UDF - this tab contains only text information about requirements for creating UDF file  system.
                 There  are  no  options  available in this tab. All options for creating UDF file system can be
                 accessed through UDF image wizard.

                 All options available in Configuration window are described below, in CONFIGURATION section.

       You have to use F9 or F10 key to save any changes made in Configuration window and close the  window.  To
       close  Configuration window without saving changes use Escape key. Values from "Tools" tab are saved only
       temporarily, they aren't stored in permanent configuration file.

       You can control cdw using application's menu (visible on left side of screen), or using hotkeys.

   <b>Main</b> <b>menu</b> <b>items</b>
              •  Add files: Select files and directories that you want to write to optical disc or to ISO  image
                 on your hard disc. Press Space to select a file or directory, use Up and Down arrows to move on
                 the list, press Enter key to change directory, press Escape key to close file selection dialog.

              •  Delete  files: List of selected files is displayed on the right side of the screen. If you want
                 to delete files from the list, select this button and use Delete key to delete a file,  Up  and
                 Down arrows to move on the list or press Escape to end deleting.

              •  Write  files to disc: write selected files to optical disc that is currently in drive. You will
                 be warned if there is no disc in drive, the drive is not ready or the disc is mounted.

              •  Create image: write selected files to ISO9660 or UDF image file. The target image file  can  be
                 selected in file picker window.

              •  Write  image  to disc: write ISO image file to optical disc. The ISO image file can be selected
                 in file picker window. You will be warned if there is no disc in drive, the drive is not  ready
                 or the disc is mounted.

              •  Read  disc: Copy content of your single session data CD/DVD or audio CD to files on hard drive.
                 In case of data CD/DVD discs cdw will create correct image file on your hard disc, but only for
                 first track on disc, rest of tracks won't be read (cdw can't read them correctly). In  case  of
                 audio  CDs  cdw  will copy each audio track to separate raw audio file. You will have to recode
                 the raw audio track files in order to play them in your media player.

              •  Erase disc: Erase data (partially or fully) from rewritable disc (CD-RW, DVD-RW,  DVD+RW)  that
                 is  currently in drive. You can select mode of erasing CD-RW or DVD-RW: fast or full. You can't
                 select mode of erasing of DVD+RW.

              •  Verify data: Calculate digest of file selected from hard drive, or compare any file with  first

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  describes  Configuration  module available via "Configuration" button in left-hand menu in
       main cdw window. You have to press F9/F10 in Configuration window to save changes made in the window  and
       exit  or  press Escape key to close configuration window without saving changes. Please note that changes
       made in "Tools" tab are saved only for current session with cdw.

              •  Log and misc (first tab):

                 •  Log file path - path to file, in which cdw writes its messages and  messages  from  external
                    tools  (mkisofs,  cdrecord, growisofs, dvd+rw-mediainfo, xorriso, mkudffs, etc.). Specifying
                    this path is obligatory.

                 •  Show log after actions - show the content of log file after some  of  actions  performed  by
                    cdw.

                 •  Volume  size - size of ISO/UDF filesystem that you want to create. Most often it is equal to
                    capacity of optical disc that you want burn data to. This is a dropdown, from which you  can
                    select  one  of  preselected  values,  or  select "Custom size". Value of custom size can be
                    entered below the dropdown.

                 •  Custom size - size of ISO/UDF filesystem that you want to create.  This is the  place  where
                    you can enter nonstandard value of target ISO/UDF filesystem size.

                 •  a  checkbox  for  following  symbolic  links  in  selected  files. Read the text next to the
                    checkbox for more information.

                 •  a checkbox modifying style of navigation in file system browser  windows.  When  this  field
                    checked, you can use Left/Right keys on keyboard to move up/down in hierarchy of directories
                    in  file  system.  This  option  work  similarly  to Midnight Commander's "Lynx-like motion"
                    option.

              •  Tools (second tab):

                 First thing that you will see in this tab "Configure tools manually" checkbox, it is  unchecked
                 by  default,  and  this  is  safe default value.  In this state cdw select tools itself. If you
                 check this checkbox you will be presented with six dropdowns: first three allow you  to  select
                 tools  or  families  of  tools  intended  for specific tasks.  Remaining dropdowns allow you to
                 select paths to some tools used by cdw for some tasks. All these dropdowns are explained below.

                 •  "Tool for creating stand alone ISO9660 file" - here you select a tool used to create ISO9660
                    file saved on hard disc (stand-alone file).  Depending on configuration  of  your  software,
                    here you can find mkisofs (genisoimage) and xorriso.

                 •  "Tools for handling CDs" dropdown - here you select a tool that will be used to burn data to
                    CD/CD-RW  discs and to erase CD-RW discs.  Depending on configuration of your software, here
                    you can find cdrecord (wodim) and xorriso.

                 •  "Tools for handling DVDs" dropdown -  here you select a tool that will be used to burn  data
                    to DVD discs and to erase DVD+/-RW discs.  Depending on configuration of your software, here
                    you  can find dvd+rw-tools, cdrecord (wodim) and xorriso. Note that xorriso can be used only
                    for DVD+/-R discs.

                 •  "Path to mkisofs" dropdown - here you can select one of implementations of mkisofs installed
                    in your system (e.g. if you have mkisofs and genisoimage).

                 •  "Path to cdrecord" dropdown - here  you  can  select  one  of  implementations  of  cdrecord
                    installed in your system (e.g. if you have cdrecord and wodim).

                 •  "Digest tool" - here you can select a tool used for calculating digest (checksum) - the tool
                    is  used e.g. during verification of burning of ISO9660 file to optical disc. md5sum tool is
                    the default one, if found.

                    Remember that these settings are saved only for your current session with cdw, and that  the
                    settings will be discarded when you close cdw.

              •  Audio (third tab):

                 •  Audio  output  dir  -  path to directory, into which cdw will write raw audio tracks, ripped
                    from audio CD.

              •  Hardware (fourth tab):

                 •  "cdw should use this drive" dropdown - option allowing you to select one of detected drives,
                    or to use path to drive entered manually ("custom path");

                 •  "Custom path to drive" - field in which you can specify your own path to  a  device,  to  be
                    used when cdw can't autodetect all drives in your computer.

                 •  SCSI   device   -   parameters   describing   your   SCSI  hardware,  in  following  format:
                    scsibus,target,lun (for a SCSI-emulated IDE CDRW: 0,0,0). It is used only  by  cdrecord  and
                    you should enter appropriate value only if cdrecord has problems with device path in form of
                    '/dev/xxx'.  Otherwise  this  field should be left empty. This option hasn't been tested, so
                    use it at your own risk.

              •  UDF (fifth tab): This tab contains only basic information about what  is  required  by  cdw  to
                 create UDF file systems. Options related to UDF file system are available in UDF image wizard.

                 Notice that cdw doesn't specify (almost) any default options for mkudffs or rsync.  User has to
                 select himself the best set of options for these programs that suit his needs.

                 "-a"  option  for  rsync  is  a  good  starting  point.  If  your  version  of  rsync  supports
                 "--info=progress2" and you enter this option in rsync options field, cdw  will  show  a  better
                 progress indication.

       Command line options are following:

       -h, -- help
              displays information about invoking cdw and its options

       -v, --version
              displays cdw version and copyright information

       --enable-dvd+rp-dl
              enables very basic support for DVD+R DL discs

       --escdelay=X
              modifies delay time between pressing Escape key in cdw window and reaction to the key

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
              •  cdw.conf: Configuration file, usually stored in $HOME/.cdw/ directory.

              •  cdw.log:  Log  file,  by  default  stored  in  $HOME/.cdw/  directory. Path to this file can be
                 modified in Configuration window ("Log and misc" tab &gt; 'Log file path' field).

              •  cdw.colors: File with definition of color schemes used to customize interface of cdw.  File  is
                 stored in $HOME/.cdw/ directory.

              •  temporary  files:  cdw  uses  some small temporary files to store various information. They are
                 usually created in <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> directory. If everything goes well they are very  short-lived  and  are
                 removed as soon as they are no longer needed.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
              •  HOME  -  cdw assumes that this variable exists and is set to valid user directory. If not, then
                 user is asked to select some other 'base' directory.

              •  PATH - cdw reads this environment variable to find directories with executable files. cdw  will
                 search in these directories for some tools.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       cdw  uses  log file ($HOME/.cdw/cdw.log by default) to store information about actions performed. You can
       access this file using your file manager, or pressing 'L' key in cdw window. Read this file for any hints
       if you experience any problems.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There are still some bugs related to memory management.

       cdw is developed and tested almost exclusively on x64 GNU/Linux,  running  cdw  on  other  platforms  may
       produce some platform-specific bugs. Currently I can't verify them in any way.

       cdw  still  fails  to  detect  some problems reported by wodim/cdrecord mkisofs/genisoimage or growisofs,
       although things have improved in latest few versions. Support for xorriso is brand new, so there is a lot
       error messages printed by xorriso, that  cdw  is  unaware  of,  and  will  happily  ignore  them.  It  is
       recommended to read log file after every operation.

       Copying  data CDs to ISO image may finish with message "Problems occurred when copying tracks". This does
       not have to mean that output ISO file is corrupted: this be  a  sign  of  some  low-level  problems  when
       reading  from  optical  disc.  Similar message displayed after ripping audio CD may mean that one or more
       track files created on your hard disc is corrupted and it is caused by invalid audio CD.

       If you notice any other bugs please let me know. You can do this either using bug tracker on cdw  project
       site (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdw/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdw/</a>) or by sending me an e-mail: <a href="mailto:acerion@wp.pl">acerion@wp.pl</a>.
