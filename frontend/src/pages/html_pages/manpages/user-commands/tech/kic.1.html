</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kic</b> - an editor for integrated circuits and photolithography masks

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kic</b> <b>[-t</b> <u>&lt;tech&gt;</u><b>]</b> <b>[-d</b> <u>&lt;display&gt;</u><b>]</b> <u>[&lt;kicfile&gt;]</u>

       <u>&lt;tech&gt;</u> Information  about  layer  names  and  general  preferences  are taken from the file stored in the
              library with the name  <b>kic_tech.&lt;tech&gt;</b>  ,  e.g  with  the  option  <b>-t</b><u>abc</u>  ,  the  technology  file
              <b>kic_tech.abc</b>  is  used.  Technology files are searched in the current directory or the one defined
              with the environment variable <b>KIC_LIB_DIR</b>.

       <u>&lt;display&gt;</u>
              is the X11 display name to be used. If not given, <b>$DISPLAY</b> will be used.

       <u>&lt;kicfile&gt;</u>
              is the file that should be edited.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kic</b> is an interactive graphical editor for drawing patterns used to generate photomasks  for  lithography
       (production of integrated circuits etc).  Note from the README file accompanying the distribution:

       KIC is distributed by Whiteley Research Inc., www.wrcad.com.

       Disclaimer:   Steve  Whiteley  and  Whiteley Research Inc. don't guarantee or imply that this software is
       suitable for any purpose.  This is free public domain software, use at your own risk.

       More help is to be found in the built-in help or in the stand-alone help reader <b>kichelp</b>  (which  accesses
       the same file).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       KIC_LIB_DIR
              directory  where  technology  files,  logo font, and help texts are stored (default depends on the
              installation, probably /usr/lib/kic)

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       $KIC_LIB_DIR/kic_help.txt
              help file for <b>kichelp</b> and builtin help (formatted ASCII, can be modified)

       $KIC_LIB_DIR/kic_tech.*
              technology files

       $KIC_LIB_DIR/logofont.kic
              font for LOGO (text writing) command

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Too large files (flat of several dozens of MB) may hang the program.

       If a layer is not defined in the current technology file, the program just complains and  shows  nothing.
       The user has to add the layer manually (either with the ATTri command or in the technology file itself).

       Layer  names with less than 4 characters may not be recognized in imported files, if the layer definition
       line does not end with ';' (semicolon).

       Coordinates with resolutions below 1/10 of the unit (1um normally) cannot be generated with KIC  but  are
       displayed  correctly.  Coordinate entry (CTRL-E) is a replacement for pointing, therefore also subject to
       grid snapping (i.e, truncation).

       <b>kichelp</b> (stand-alone help reader, no manpage)

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       This manpage was written by Y.Bonetti
       [gopher://freeshell.org/1/users/yargo]
       for the Debian GNU/Linux  project,  based  on  the  KIC  sources,  its  accompanying  documentation,  and
       experience.
