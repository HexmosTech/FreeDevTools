</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dbiproxy - A proxy server for the DBD::Proxy driver

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           dbiproxy &lt;options&gt; --localport=&lt;port&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This tool is just a front end for the DBI::ProxyServer package. All it does is picking options from the
       command line and calling <b>DBI::ProxyServer::main()</b>. See DBI::ProxyServer for details.

       Available options include:

       <b>--chroot=dir</b>
           (UNIX  only)  After doing a <b>bind()</b>, change root directory to the given directory by doing a <b>chroot()</b>.
           This is useful for security, but it restricts the environment a lot. For example, you  need  to  load
           DBI  drivers in the config file or you have to create hard links to Unix sockets, if your drivers are
           using them. For example, with MySQL, a config file might contain the following lines:

               my $rootdir = '/var/dbiproxy';
               my $unixsockdir = '<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>';
               my $unixsockfile = 'mysql.sock';
               foreach $dir ($rootdir, "$rootdir$unixsockdir") {
                   mkdir 0755, $dir;
               }
               link("$unixsockdir/$unixsockfile",
                    "$rootdir$unixsockdir/$unixsockfile");
               require DBD::mysql;

               {
                   'chroot' =&gt; $rootdir,
                   ...
               }

           If you don't know <b>chroot()</b>, think of an FTP server where you can see a certain  directory  tree  only
           after logging in. See also the --group and --user options.

       <b>--configfile=file</b>
           Config  files are assumed to return a single hash ref that overrides the arguments of the new method.
           However, command line arguments in turn take precedence over the config file. See the  "CONFIGURATION
           FILE" section in the DBI::ProxyServer documentation for details on the config file.

       <b>--debug</b>
           Turn debugging mode on. Mainly this asserts that logging messages of level "debug" are created.

       <b>--facility=mode</b>
           (UNIX only) Facility to use for Sys::Syslog. The default is <b>daemon</b>.

       <b>--group=gid</b>
           After  doing  a  <b>bind()</b>, change the real and effective GID to the given.  This is useful, if you want
           your server to bind to a privileged port (&lt;1024), but don't want the server to execute as  root.  See
           also the --user option.

           GID's can be passed as group names or numeric values.

       <b>--localaddr=ip</b>
           By  default  a  daemon is listening to any IP number that a machine has. This attribute allows one to
           restrict the server to the given IP number.

       <b>--localport=port</b>
           This attribute sets the port on which the daemon is listening. It must be given somehow,  as  there's
           no default.

       <b>--logfile=file</b>
           Be default logging messages will be written to the syslog (Unix) or to the event log (Windows NT). On
           other  operating systems you need to specify a log file. The special value "STDERR" forces logging to
           stderr. See Net::Daemon::Log for details.

       <b>--mode=modename</b>
           The server can run in three different modes, depending on the environment.

           If you are running Perl 5.005 and did compile it for threads, then  the  server  will  create  a  new
           thread  for  each  connection.  The thread will execute the server's <b>Run()</b> method and then terminate.
           This mode is the default, you can force it with "--mode=threads".

           If threads are not available, but you have a working <b>fork()</b>, then the server will behave  similar  by
           creating  a  new process for each connection.  This mode will be used automatically in the absence of
           threads or if you use the "--mode=fork" option.

           Finally there's a single-connection mode: If the server has accepted a connection, he will enter  the
           <b>Run()</b>  method.  No  other  connections  are  accepted  until  the <b>Run()</b> method returns (if the client
           disconnects).  This operation mode is useful if you have neither threads nor <b>fork()</b>, for  example  on
           the Macintosh. For debugging purposes you can force this mode with "--mode=single".

       <b>--pidfile=file</b>
           (UNIX  only)  If this option is present, a PID file will be created at the given location. Default is
           to not create a pidfile.

       <b>--user=uid</b>
           After doing a <b>bind()</b>, change the real and effective UID to the given.  This is useful,  if  you  want
           your  server  to bind to a privileged port (&lt;1024), but don't want the server to execute as root. See
           also the --group and the --chroot options.

           UID's can be passed as group names or numeric values.

       <b>--version</b>
           Suppresses startup of the server; instead the version string will be printed and  the  program  exits
           immediately.
