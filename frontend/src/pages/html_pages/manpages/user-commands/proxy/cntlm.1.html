</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cntlm</b> - authenticating HTTP(S) proxy with TCP/IP tunneling and acceleration

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cntlm</b> [ <b>-AaBcDdFfgHhILlMPprSsTUuvw</b> ] [ <u>host1</u> <u>port1</u> | <u>host1</u>:<u>port1</u> ] ... <u>hostN</u> <u>portN</u>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Cntlm</b>  is  an  NTLM/NTLM SR/NTLMv2 authenticating HTTP proxy. It stands between your applications and the
       corporate proxy, adding NTLM authentication on-the-fly. You can  specify  several  "parent"  proxies  and
       Cntlm will try one after another until one works. All auth'd connections are cached and reused to achieve
       high  efficiency. Just point your apps proxy settings at Cntlm, fill in cntlm.conf (cntlm.ini) and you're
       ready to do. This is useful on Windows, but essential for non-Microsoft OS's. Proxy IP addresses  can  be
       specified via CLI (<u>host1:port1</u> to <u>hostN:portN</u>) or the configuration file.

       Another  option  is  to have <b>cntlm</b> authenticate your local web connections without any parent proxies. It
       can work in a stand-alone mode, just like Squid or ISA. By default, all requests are forwarded to  parent
       proxies,  but  the  user  can set a "NoProxy" list, a list of URL matching wild-card patterns, that route
       between direct and forward  modes.  <b>Cntlm</b>  can  also  recognize  when  all  your  corporate  proxies  are
       unavailable  and switch to stand-alone mode automatically (and then back again). Aside from <u>WWW</u> and <u>PROXY</u>
       authentication, <b>cntlm</b> provides a useful feature enabling users migrate their  laptops  between  work  and
       home  without  changing  proxy  settings  in  their  applications  (using <b>cntlm</b> all the time). <b>Cntlm</b> also
       integrates transparent TCP/IP port forwarding (tunneling). Each tunnel opens a new  listening  socket  on
       local  machine  and  and  forwards all connections to the target host behind the parent proxy. Instead of
       these SSH-like tunnels, user can also choose a limited SOCKS5 interface.

       Core <b>cntlm</b> function had been similar to the late  NTLMAPS,  but  today,  <b>cntlm</b>  has  evolved  way  beyond
       anything  any  other  application of this type can offer. The feature list below speaks for itself. <b>Cntlm</b>
       has many security/privacy features like <b>NTLMv2</b> support and  password  protection  -  it  is  possible  to
       substitute  password  hashes (which can be obtained using <b>-H</b>) in place of the actual password or to enter
       the password interactively (on start-up or via "basic" HTTP auth translation). If plaintext  password  is
       used,  it  is  automatically  hashed during the startup and all traces of it are removed from the process
       memory.

       In addition to minimal use of system resources, <b>cntlm</b> achieves higher throughput  on  a  given  link.  By
       caching authenticated connections, it acts as an HTTP accelerator; This way, the 5-way auth handshake for
       each  connection  is  transparently  eliminated, providing immediate access most of the time. <b>Cntlm</b> never
       caches a request/reply body in memory, in fact, no traffic is generated except for the exchange  of  auth
       headers  until  the  client &lt;-&gt; server connection is fully negotiated. Only then real data transfer takes
       place.  <b>Cntlm</b> is written in optimized C and easily achieves fifteen times faster responses than others.

       An example of <b>cntlm</b> compared to NTLMAPS: <b>cntlm</b> gave avg 76 kB/s with peak CPU usage of 0.3% whereas  with
       NTLMAPS  it  was avg 48 kB/s with peak CPU at 98% (Pentium M 1.8 GHz). The extreme difference in resource
       usage is one of many important benefits for laptop use. Peak memory consumption (several  complex  sites,
       50 paralell connections/threads; values are in KiB):

              VSZ   RSS CMD
             3204  1436 ./cntlm -f -c ./cntlm.conf -P pid
           411604  6264 /usr/share/ntlmaps/main.py -c /etc/ntlmaps/server.cfg

       Inherent  part of the development is profiling and memory management screening using Valgrind. The source
       distribution contains a file called <u>valgrind.txt</u>, where you can see the report confirming zero leaks,  no
       access  to  unallocated  memory,  no  usage  of  uninitialized data - all traced down to each instruction
       emulated in Valgrind's virtual CPU during a typical production lifetime of the proxy.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Most options can be pre-set in a configuration file. Specifying an option more than once is not an error,
       but <b>cntlm</b> ignores all occurences except the last one. This does not apply to  options  like <b>-L</b>,  each  of
       which  creates  a  new  instance  of some feature. <b>Cntlm</b> can be built with a hardcoded configuration file
       (e.g. /etc/cntlm.conf), which is always loaded, if possible. See <b>-c</b> option on how to override some or all
       of its settings.

       Use <b>-h</b> to see available options with short description.

       <b>-A</b> <b>IP/mask</b>    <b>(Allow)</b>
              Allow ACL rule. Together with <b>-D</b> (Deny) they are the two rules allowed in ACL policy. It  is  more
              usual to have this in a configuration file, but <b>Cntlm</b> follows the premise that you can do the same
              on the command-line as you can using the config file. When <b>Cntlm</b> receives a connection request, it
              decides  whether  to  allow  or  deny  it. All ACL rules are stored in a list in the same order as
              specified. <b>Cntlm</b> then walks the list and the first <u>IP/mask</u> rule that matches  the  request  source
              address  is  applied.  The  <u>mask</u>  can be any number from 0 to 32, where 32 is the default (that is
              exact IP match). This notation is also known as CIDR. If you want to match everything, use <b>0/0</b>  or
              an  asterix. ACLs on the command-line take precedence over those in the config file. In such case,
              you will see info about that in the log (among the list of unused options). There you can also see
              warnings about possibly incorrect subnet spec, that's when the <u>IP</u> part  has  more  bits  than  you
              declare by <u>mask</u> (e.g. 10.20.30.40/24 should be 10.20.30.0/24).

       <b>-a</b> <b>NTLMv2</b> <b>|</b> <b>NTLM2SR</b> <b>|</b> <b>NT</b> <b>|</b> <b>NTLM</b> <b>|</b> <b>LM</b>    <b>(Auth)</b>
              Authentication  type.  NTLM(v2)  comprises of one or two hashed responses, NT and LM or NTLM2SR or
              NTv2 and LMv2, which are computed from the password hash. Each response uses a  different  hashing
              algorithm;  as  new  response  types  were invented, stronger algorithms were used. When you first
              install <b>cntlm</b>, find the strongest one which works for you (preferably using <b>-M</b>).  Above  they  are
              listed  from  strongest  to  weakest.  Very old servers or dedicated HW proxies might be unable to
              process anything but LM. If none of those work, see compatibility  flags  option <b>-F</b>  or  submit  a
              Support Request.

              <b>IMPORTANT:</b>  Although  NTLMv2 is not widely adopted (i.e. enforced), it is supported on all Windows
              since NT 4.0 SP4. That's for <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b>! I strongly suggest  you  use  it  to  protect  your
              credentials   on-line.   You   should   also   replace  plaintext  <b>Password</b>  options  with  hashed
              <b>Pass[NTLMv2|NT|LM]</b> equivalents. NTLMv2 is the most and possibly the only secure authentication  of
              the NTLM family.

       <b>-B</b>    <b>(NTLMToBasic)</b>
              This  option enables "NTLM-to-basic", which allows you to use one <b>cntlm</b> for multiple users. Please
              note that all security of NTLM is lost this way. Basic auth uses just a simple encoding  algorithm
              to "hide" your credentials and it is moderately easy to sniff them.

              IMPORTANT:  HTTP  protocol  obviously  has  means  to  negotiate  authorization before letting you
              through, but TCP/IP doesn't (i.e. open port is open port). If  you  use  NTLM-to-basic  and  DON'T
              specify  some  username/password  in  the  configuration  file,  you  are bound to loose tunneling
              features, because <b>cntlm</b> alone won't know your credentials.

              Because NTLM identification has at least three parts (username, password, domain)  and  the  basic
              authentication  provides  fields for only two (username, password), you have to smuggle the domain
              part somewhere. You can set the <b>Domain</b> config/cmd-line parameter, which will then be used for  all
              users,  who  don't  specify  their  domain  as a part of the username. To do that and override the
              global  domain  setting,  use  this  instead  of  plain   username   in   the   password   dialog:
              "domain\username".

       <b>-c</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Configuration file. Command-line options, if used, override its single options or are added at the
              top of the list for multi options (tunnels, parent proxies, etc) with the exception of ACLs, which
              are completely overridden. Use <u>/dev/null</u> to disable any config file.

       <b>-D</b> <b>IP/mask</b>    <b>(Deny)</b>
              Deny ACL rule. See option <b>-A</b> above.

       <b>-d</b> <b>&lt;domain&gt;</b>    <b>(Domain)</b>
              The  domain  or  workgroup of the proxy account. This value can also be specified as a part of the
              username with <b>-u</b>.

       <b>-F</b> <b>&lt;flags&gt;</b>    <b>(Flags)</b>
              NTLM authentication flags. This option is rater delicate and I do  not  recommend  to  change  the
              default  built-in  values  unless  you  had  no  success  with  parent  proxy auth and tried magic
              autodetection (<b>-M</b>) and all possible values for the <b>Auth</b> option (<b>-a</b>). Remember that each NT/LM hash
              combination requires different flags. This option is sort of  a  complete  "manual  override"  and
              you'll have to deal with it yourself.

       <b>-f</b>     Run in console as a foreground job, do not fork into background. In this mode, all syslog messages
              will  be echoed to the console (on platforms which support syslog LOG_PERROR option). Though <b>cntlm</b>
              is primarily designed as a classic UNIX daemon with syslogd logging, it provides detailed  verbose
              mode  without  detaching  from  the  controlling  terminal;  see  <b>-v</b>.  In  any case, all error and
              diagnostic messages are always sent to the system logger.

       <b>-G</b> <b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b>    <b>(ISAScannerAgent)</b>
              User-Agent matching (case  insensitive)  for  trans-isa-scan  plugin  (see  <b>-S</b>  for  explanation).
              Positive  match  identifies requests (applications) for which the plugin should be enabled without
              considering the size of the download (see <b>-S</b>). You can use shell wildcard characters, namely  "*",
              "?"  and  "[]".  If  used  without  <b>-S</b>  or <b>ISAScannerSize</b>, the <u>max_size_in_kb</u> is internally set to
              infinity, so the plugin will be active ONLY for selected User-Agents, regardless of download size.

       <b>-g</b>    <b>(Gateway)</b>
              Gateway mode, <b>cntlm</b> listens on all network interfaces. Default is to bind just loopback. That way,
              only local processes can connect to <b>cntlm</b>. In the  gateway  mode  though,  <b>cntlm</b>  listens  on  all
              interfaces  and  is accessible to other machines on the network. Please note that with this option
              the command-line order matters when specifying proxy or  tunnel  local  (listening)  ports.  Those
              positioned before it will bind only loopback; those after will be public.
              IMPORTANT:  All  of  the above applies only to local ports for which you didn't specify any source
              address. If you did, <b>cntlm</b> tries to bind the given port only on the specified interface (or rather
              IP address).

       <b>-H</b>     Use this option to get hashes for password-less configuration. In  this  mode,  <b>cntlm</b>  prints  the
              results  and  exits.  You  can just copy &amp; paste right into the config file. You ought to use this
              option with explicit <b>-u</b> and <b>-d</b>, because some hashes include the username and domain  name  in  the
              calculation. Do see <b>-a</b> for security recommendations.

       <b>-h</b>     Display help (available options with a short description) and exit.

       <b>-I</b>     Interactive password prompt. Any password settings from the command line or config file is ignored
              and a password prompt is issued. Use this option only from shell.

       <b>-L</b> <b>[&lt;saddr&gt;:]&lt;lport&gt;:&lt;rhost&gt;:&lt;rport&gt;</b>    <b>(Tunnel)</b>
              Tunnel  definition.  The  syntax  is  the  same  as in OpenSSH's local forwarding (<b>-L</b>), with a new
              optional prefix, <u>saddr</u> - the source IP address to  bind  the  <u>lport</u>  to.  <b>Cntlm</b>  will  listen  for
              incoming  connections  on the local port <u>lport</u>, forwarding every new connection through the parent
              proxy to the <u>rhost</u>:<u>rport</u> (authenticating on the go). This option can be used  multiple  times  for
              unlimited  number  of tunnels, with or without the <u>saddr</u> option. See <b>-g</b> for the details concerning
              local port binding when <u>saddr</u> is not used.

              Please note that many corporate proxies do not allow connections to ports other than 443  (https),
              but  if you run your target service on this port, you should be safe. Connect to HTTPS is "always"
              allowed, otherwise nobody would be able to browse https:// sites. In any case, first  try  if  you
              can  establish  a connection through the tunnel, before you rely on it. This feature does the same
              job as tools like <b><a href="../man1/corkscrew.1.html">corkscrew</a>(1)</b>, but instead of communicating  over  a  terminal,  <b>cntlm</b>  keeps  it
              TCP/IP.

       <b>-l</b> <b>[&lt;saddr&gt;:]&lt;lport&gt;</b>    <b>(Listen)</b>
              Local  port  for  the <b>cntlm</b> proxy service. Use the number you have chosen here and the hostname of
              the machine running <b>cntlm</b> (possibly localhost) as  proxy  settings  in  your  browser  and/or  the
              environment.   Most  applications  (including  console)  support the notion of proxy to connect to
              other hosts. On POSIX, set the following variables to use e.g. <b><a href="../man1/wget.1.html">wget</a>(1)</b> without any  trouble  (fill
              in the actual address of <b>cntlm</b>):

                  $ export ftp_proxy=<a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:3128
                  $ export http_proxy=$ftp_proxy
                  $ export https_proxy=$ftp_proxy

              You  can  choose to run the proxy service on more than one port, in such case just use this option
              as many times as necessary. But unlike tunnel definition, <b>cntlm</b> fails to start if it  cannot  bind
              all  of  the  proxy  service ports. Proxy service port can also be bound selectively. Use <u>saddr</u> to
              pick source IP address to bind the <u>lport</u> to. This allows you, for example, to run the  service  on
              different  ports  for  subnet  A  and B and make it invisible for subnet C. See <b>-g</b> for the details
              concerning local port binding when <u>saddr</u> is not used.

       <b>-M</b> <b>&lt;testurl&gt;</b>
              Run magic NTLM dialect detection. In this mode, <b>cntlm</b> tries some  known  working  presets  against
              your  proxy.  Probe  requests  are made for the specified <u>testurl</u>, with the strongest hashes going
              first.  When finished, settings for the most secure setup are printed. Although the detection will
              tell you which and how to use <b>Auth</b>, <b>Flags</b> and password-hash options,  you  have  to  configure  at
              least  your  credentials  and  proxy  address  first.  You  can  use  <b>-I</b>  to  enter  your password
              interactively.

       <b>-N</b> <b>&lt;pattern1&gt;[,&lt;patternN]</b>    <b>(NoProxy)</b>
              Avoid parent proxy for these host names. All matching URL's will be proxied <u>directly</u> by <b>cntlm</b> as a
              stand-alone proxy. <b>Cntlm</b> supports WWW authentication in this mode, thus  allowing  you  to  access
              local  intranet  sites  with  corporate  NTLM  authentication.  Hopefully,  you  won't  need  that
              virtualized MSIE any more. :)

       <b>-O</b> <b>[&lt;saddr&gt;:]&lt;port_number&gt;</b>    <b>(SOCKS5Proxy)</b>
              Enable SOCKS5 proxy and make it listen on local port <u>port_number</u> (source IP spec is also possible,
              as with all options). By default, there will be no restrictions as to who can  use  this  service.
              Some  clients  don't even support SOCKS5 authentication (e.g. almost all browsers). If you wish to
              enforce authentication, use <b>-R</b> or its equivalent option, <b>SOCKS5User</b>. As with port tunneling, it is
              up to the parent proxy whether it will allow connection to any requested host:port.  This  feature
              can be used with <b><a href="../man1/tsocks.1.html">tsocks</a>(1)</b> to make most TCP/IP applications go thru the proxy rather than directly
              (only  outgoing  connections  will  work,  obviously). To make apps work without DNS server, it is
              important that they don't resolve themselves, but  using  SOCKS.  E.g.  Firefox  has  this  option
              available  through  URI "about:config", key name <b>network.proxy.socks_remote_dns</b>, which must be set
              to <b>true</b>. Proxy-unaware <b>tsocks</b>ified apps, will have to be configured using IP addresses to  prevent
              them from DNS resolving.

       <b>-P</b> <b>&lt;pidfile&gt;</b>
              Create  a  PID  file  <u>pidfile</u>  upon  startup.  If  the  specified file exists, it is truncated and
              overwritten.  This option is intended  for  use  with  <b><a href="../man8/start-stop-daemon.8.html">start-stop-daemon</a>(8)</b>  and  other  servicing
              mechanisms.  Please  note  that the PID file is created AFTER the process drops its privileges and
              forks. When the daemon finishes cleanly, the file is removed.

       <b>-p</b> <b>&lt;password&gt;</b>    <b>(Password,</b> <b>PassNT,</b> <b>...)</b>
              Proxy account password. <b>Cntlm</b> deletes the password from the memory, to make it invisible in  <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a>
              or  with  inspection  tools  like  <b><a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</a>(1)</b>,  but  the  preferable  way  of  setting  password is the
              configuration file.  To that end, you can use  <b>Password</b>  option  (for  plaintext,  human  readable
              format), or "encrypt" your password via <b>-H</b> and then use <b>PassNTLMv2</b>, <b>PassNT</b> and/or <b>PassLM</b>.

       <b>-R</b> <b>&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;</b>    <b>(SOCKS5User)</b>
              If  SOCKS5  proxy  is  enabled,  this  option  can  make it accessible only to those who have been
              authorized.  It can be used several times, to create a whole list of accounts  (allowed  user:pass
              combinations).

       <b>-S</b> <b>&lt;max_size_in_kb&gt;</b>    <b>(ISAScannerSize)</b>
              Enables  the  plugin  for  transparent  handling  of  the dreaded ISA AV scanner, which returns an
              interactive HTTP  page  (displaying  the  scanning  progress)  instead  of  the  file/data  you've
              requested, every time it feels like scanning the contents. This presumptuous behavior breaks every
              automated  downloader,  updater  and  basically EVERY application relying on downloads (e.g. wget,
              apt-get).

              The parameter <u>max_size_in_kb</u> allows you to choose maximum download size you wish to handle by  the
              plugin  (see  below why you might want that). If the file size is bigger than this, <b>cntlm</b> forwards
              you the interactive page, effectively disabling the plugin for that download. Zero means no limit.
              Use <b>-G</b>/<b>ISAScannerAgent</b> to  identify  applications  for  which  <u>max_size_in_kb</u>  should  be  ignored
              (forcing  the plugin). It works by matching User-Agent header and is necessary for e.g. wget, apt-
              get and yum, which would fail if the response is some HTTP page instead of requested data.

              How it works: the client asks for a file, <b>cntlm</b> detects ISA's bullshit response and waits for  the
              secret  link to ISA's cache, which comes no sooner than the file is downloaded and scanned by ISA.
              Only then can <b>cntlm</b> make the second request for the real file and forward it  along  with  correct
              headers to the client.  The client doesn't timeout while waiting for it, b/c <b>cntlm</b> is periodically
              sending  an  extra  "keepalive" header, but the user might get nervous not seeing the progress bar
              move. It's of course <b>purely</b> <b>psychological</b> matter, there's no difference if <b>cntlm</b> or  your  browser
              requests  the  scanned  file  -  you  must wait for ISA to do it's job and download then. You just
              expect to see some progress indicator move, which is all what the ISA's page does: it  shows  HTML
              countdown.

              If  the  plugin  cannot  parse the interactive page for some reason (unknown formatting, etc.), it
              quits and the page is forwarded to you - it's never "lost".

              The keepalive header is called ISA-Scanner and shows ISA's progress, e.g.:

                  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
                  ISA-Scanner: 1000 of 10000
                  ISA-Scanner: 2000 of 10000
                  ...

       <b>-r</b> <b>"&lt;name&gt;:</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;"</b>    <b>(Header)</b>
              Header substitution. Every client's request will be processed and any headers defined using <b>-r</b>  or
              in  the  configuration  file will be added to it. In case the header is already present, its value
              will be replaced.

       <b>-s</b>     Serializes all requests by not using concurrent  threads  for  proxy  (tunneling  still  works  in
              parallel). This has a horrible impact on performance and is available only for debugging purposes.
              When used with <b>-v</b>, it yields nice sequential debug log, where requests take turns.

       <b>-T</b> <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b>
              Used in combination with <b>-v</b> to save the debug output into a trace file. It should be placed as the
              first  parameter  on the command line. To prevent data loss, it never overwrites an existing file.
              You have to pick a unique name or manually delete the old file.

       <b>-U</b> <b>&lt;uid&gt;</b>
              When executed as root, do the stuff that needs such permissions (read config,  bind  ports,  etc.)
              and  then  immediately  drop  privileges and change to <u>uid</u>. This parameter can be either number or
              system username.  If you use a number, both uid and gid of the process will be set to this  value;
              if you specify a username, uid and gid will be set according to that user's uid and primary gid as
              defined  in  <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u>.  You should use the latter, possibly using a dedicated <b>cntlm</b> account. As
              with any daemon, you are <b>strongly</b> advised to run <b>cntlm</b> under a non-privileged account.

       <b>-u</b> <b>&lt;user&gt;[@&lt;domain&gt;]</b>    <b>(Username)</b>
              Proxy account/user name. Domain can be be entered as well.

       <b>-v</b>     Print debugging information. Automatically enables (<b>-f</b>).

       <b>-w</b> <b>&lt;workstation&gt;</b>    <b>(Workstation)</b>
              Workstation NetBIOS name. Do not use full qualified domain name (FQDN) here. Just the first  part.
              If  not  specified,  <b>cntlm</b> tries to get the system hostname and if that fails, uses "cntlm" - it's
              because some proxies require this field non-empty.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration file is basically an INI file, except  there  are  no  "="  between  keys  and  values.  It
       comprises  of  whitespace delimited keyword and value pairs. Apart from that, there are sections as well,
       they have the usual "[section_name]" syntax. Comment begins with a hash "#" or a semicolon ";" and can be
       anywhere in the file.  Everything after the mark up until EOL  is  a  comment.  Values  can  contain  any
       characters,  including whitespace.  You <u>can</u> use double quotes around the value to set a string containing
       special characters like spaces, pound signs, etc. No escape sequences are allowed in quoted strings.

       There are two types of keywords, <u>local</u> and <u>global</u>.  Local  options  specify  authentication  details  per
       domain (or location). Global keywords apply to all sections and proxies. They should be placed before all
       sections,  but  it's  not  necessary.  They  are:  Allow, Deny, Gateway, Listen, SOCKS5Proxy, SOCKS5User,
       NTLMToBasic, Tunnel.

       All available keywords are listed here, full descriptions are in the OPTIONS section:

       <b>Allow</b> <b>&lt;IP&gt;[/&lt;mask&gt;]</b>
              ACL allow rule, see <b>-A</b>.

       <b>Auth</b> <b>NTLMv2</b> <b>|</b> <b>NTLM2SR</b> <b>|</b> <b>NT</b> <b>|</b> <b>NTLM</b> <b>|</b> <b>LM</b>
              Select any possible combination of NTLM hashes using a single parameter.

       <b>Deny</b> <b>&lt;IP&gt;[/&lt;mask&gt;]</b>
              ACL deny rule, see <b>-A</b>.

       <b>Domain</b> <b>&lt;domain_name&gt;</b>
              Proxy account domain/workgroup name.

       <b>Flags</b> <b>&lt;flags&gt;</b>
              NTLM authentication flags. See <b>-F</b> for details.

       <b>Gateway</b> <b>yes|no</b>
              Gateway mode. In the configuration file, order doesn't matter. Gateway mode applies  the  same  to
              all tunnels.

       <b>Header</b> <b>&lt;headername:</b> <b>value&gt;</b>
              Header substitution. See <b>-r</b> for details and remember, no quoting.

       <b>ISAScannerAgent</b> <b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b>
              Wildcard-enabled  (*, ?, []) case insensitive User-Agent string matching for the trans-isa-plugin.
              If you don't define <b>ISAScannerSize</b>, it is internally set to infinity, i.e.  disabling  the  plugin
              for all downloads except those agent-matched ones. See <b>-G</b>.

       <b>ISAScannerSize</b> <b>&lt;max_size_in_kb&gt;</b>
              Enable trans-isa-scan plugin. See <b>-S</b> for more.

       <b>Listen</b> <b>[&lt;saddr&gt;:]&lt;port_number&gt;</b>
              Local port number for the <b>cntlm</b>'s proxy service. See <b>-l</b> for more.

       <b>Password</b> <b>&lt;password&gt;</b>
              Proxy  account  password. As with any other option, the value (password) can be enclosed in double
              quotes (") in case it contains special characters like spaces, pound signs, etc.

       <b>PassNTLMv2,</b> <b>PassNT,</b> <b>PassLM</b> <b>&lt;password&gt;</b>
              Hashes of the proxy account password (see <b>-H</b> and <b>-a</b>). When you want to use hashes  in  the  config
              (instead of plaintext password), each <b>Auth</b> settings requires different options:

                  Settings     |  Requires
                  -------------+-----------------
                  Auth NTLMv2  |  PassNTLMv2
                  Auth NTLM2SR |  PassNT
                  Auth NT      |  PassNT
                  Auth NTLM    |  PassNT + PassLM
                  Auth LM      |  PassLM

       <b>Proxy</b> <b>&lt;host:port&gt;</b>
              Parent  proxy,  which  requires authentication. The same as proxy on the command-line, can be used
              more than once  to  specify  an  arbitrary  number  of  proxies.  Should  one  proxy  fail,  <b>cntlm</b>
              automatically  moves  on  to  the  next  one.  The connect request fails only if the whole list of
              proxies is scanned and (for each request) and found to be invalid. Command-line  takes  precedence
              over the configuration file.

       <b>NoProxy</b> <b>&lt;pattern1&gt;,</b> <b>&lt;pattern2&gt;,</b> <b>...</b>
              Avoid parent proxy for these host names. All matching URL's will be proxied <u>directly</u> by <b>cntlm</b> as a
              stand-alone  proxy.  <b>Cntlm</b>  supports  WWW authentication in this mode, thus allowing you to access
              local  intranet  sites  with  corporate  NTLM  authentication.  Hopefully,  you  won't  need  that
              virtualized MSIE any more. :) See <b>-N</b> for more.

       <b>SOCKS5Proxy</b> <b>[&lt;saddr&gt;:]&lt;lport&gt;</b>
              Enable SOCKS5 proxy. See <b>-O</b> for more.

       <b>SOCKS5User</b> <b>&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;</b>
              Create a new SOCKS5 proxy account. See <b>-R</b> for more.

       <b>NTLMToBasic</b> <b>yes|no</b>
              Enable/disable NTLM-to-basic authenticatoin. See <b>-B</b> for more.

       <b>Tunnel</b> <b>[&lt;saddr&gt;:]&lt;lport&gt;:&lt;rhost&gt;:&lt;rport&gt;</b>
              Tunnel definition. See <b>-L</b> for more.

       <b>Username</b>
              Proxy  account  name,  without  the  possibility  to include domain name ('at' sign is interpreted
              literally).

       <b>Workstation</b> <b>&lt;hostname&gt;</b>
              The hostname of your workstation.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The optional location of the configuration file is defined in the  Makefile,  with  the  default  for  1)
       deb/rpm package, 2) traditional "make; make install" and 3) Windows installer, respectively, being:

           1) /etc/cntlm.conf
           2) /usr/local/etc/cntlm.conf
           3) %PROGRAMFILES%\Cntlm\cntlm.ini

</pre><h4><b>PORTING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Cntlm</b>  is  being  used  on  many  platforms, little and big endian machines, so users should not have any
       problems with compilation. Nowadays, <b>cntlm</b> is a standard tool in most Linux distributions and  there  are
       various  repositories for other UNIX-like systems. Personally, I release Debian Linux (deb), RedHat Linux
       (rpm) and Windows (exe) binaries, but most people get <b>cntlm</b> from their OS distributor.

       For compilation details, see README in the source  distribution.  Porting  to  any  POSIX  conforming  OS
       shouldn't  be more than a matter of a Makefile rearrangement. <b>Cntlm</b> uses strictly POSIX.1-2001 interfaces
       with ISO C99 libc and is also compliant with SUSv3. Since version 0.33, <b>cntlm</b> supports  Windows  using  a
       POSIX emulation layer called <b>Cygwin</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>To</b>  <b>report</b>  <b>a</b>  <b>bug</b>,  enable  the debug output, save it to a file and submit on-line along with a detailed
       description of the problem and how to reproduce it. Visit the home page for more.

           cntlm -T cntlmtrace.log -v -s ... the rest ...
