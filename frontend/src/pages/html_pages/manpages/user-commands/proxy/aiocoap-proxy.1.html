              [--tls-server-certificate CRT] [--tls-server-key KEY] [--register [RD-URI]] [--register-as EP[.D]]
              [--register-proxy]  [--namebased  NAME:DEST]  [--subdomainbased NAME:DEST] [--pathbased PATH:DEST]

   <b>options:</b>
       <b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b>
              show this help message and exit

       <b>--version</b>
              show program's version number and exit

   <b>mode:</b>
              Required argument for setting the operation mode

       <b>--forward</b>
              Run as forward proxy

       <b>--reverse</b>
              Run as reverse proxy

   <b>details:</b>
              Options that govern how requests go in and out

       <b>--bind</b> BIND
              Host and/or port to bind to (see <b>--help-bind</b> for details)

       <b>--credentials</b> CREDENTIALS
              JSON file pointing to credentials for the server's identity/ies.

       <b>--tls-server-certificate</b> CRT
              TLS certificate (chain) to present to connecting clients (in PEM format)

       <b>--tls-server-key</b> KEY
              TLS key to load that supports the server certificate

       <b>--register</b> [RD-URI]
              Register with a Resource directory

       <b>--register-as</b> EP[.D]
              Endpoint name (with possibly a domain after a dot) to register as

       <b>--register-proxy</b>
              Ask the RD to serve as a reverse proxy. Note that this is only practical  for  <b>--unconditional</b>  or
              <b>--pathbased</b> reverse proxies.

   <b>Rules:</b>
              Sequence  of  forwarding  rules  that,  if matched by a request, specify a forwarding destination.
              Destinations can be prefixed to change their behavior: With an  '@'  sign,  they  are  treated  as
              forward proxies. With a '!' sign, the destination is set as Uri-Host.

       <b>--namebased</b> NAME:DEST
              If Uri-Host matches NAME, route to DEST

       <b>--subdomainbased</b> NAME:DEST
              If Uri-Host is anything.NAME, route to DEST

       <b>--pathbased</b> PATH:DEST
              If a requested path starts with PATH, split that part off and route to DEST

       <b>--unconditional</b> DEST
              Route all requests not previously matched to DEST
