</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       iclass - class browser

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>iclass</b> [<b>-r</b>] [<b>-v</b>] [<b>-c</b>] <u>path</u> [<u>path...</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Iclass</u>  is  a  simple  class  browser  that  lets you navigate through C++ class hierarchies and view the
       definition of a particular class.  You can select classes from three browsers: the first shows a list  of
       all  known  classes;  the second shows the parents of the selected class, if any; and the third shows the
       children of the selected class, if any.  You can choose a name from any of these lists and tell <u>iclass</u> to
       show the definition of that class, or you can type the name of a class  explicitly  in  the  StringEditor
       labeled  ``selected class.''  The view of the class definition shows the source code from the header file
       that defines the selected class.

</pre><h4><b>ARGUMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Iclass</u> interprets arguments that specify the header files to search for  class  definitions.   Each  non-
       option  argument on the command line should specify a pathname to a header file or a directory containing
       header files.  If the pathname is a filename ending in the suffix ``.h'',  then  <u>iclass</u>  will  scan  that
       header  file.   If  the  pathname  is a directory, then it will scan every header file in that directory.
       <u>Iclass</u> will ignore filenames that do not end in the suffix ``.h'', unless the ``-c'' option is given.  In
       this case <u>iclass</u> will search both ``.h'' and ``.C'' files for class definitions.

       You may use any of the standard options accepted by InterViews programs  in  addition  to  the  following
       options:

       <b>-r</b>     Recursively scan subdirectories for additional header files when scanning a directory.

       <b>-v</b>     Verbosely print the name of every header file scanned.

       <b>-c</b>     Allow  <u>iclass</u>  to search ``.C'' files as well as ``.h'' for class definitions.  This option should
              be used carefully.  Because of the way that iclass searches for definitions, it is possible for it
              to get confused by code in a ``.C'' file and think it is a definition.   Nonetheless,  this  is  a
              useful option if there are C++ input files that contain definitions.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Iclass</u> provides pull-down menus for issuing commands.  The ``File'' menu includes the following commands:

       <b>Scan</b> <b>Files/Directories...</b>
           Prompt for additional pathnames to scan.

       <b>Clear</b> <b>Classes</b>
           Purge iclass of all classes it has scanned.

       <b>Quit</b>
           Close the window and exit.

       Commands in the ``Search'' menu include:

       <b>Forward</b> <b>Search...</b>
              Search  forward in the class definition for a match with a given regular expression, wrapping from
              the end to the beginning of the buffer if necessary.

       <b>Backward</b> <b>Search...</b>
              Search backward for a match with a given regexp.

       <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Line...</b>
              Move the cursor to the beginning of the given line, scrolling the display if necessary.

</pre><h4><b>MOUSE</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The left mouse button selects text.  Left-clicking inside a browser, StringEditor,  or  class  definition
       also  focuses  keyboard input to it, which lets it interpret subsequent keyboard commands as scrolling or
       selection operations.  Double left-clicking inside a browser is equivalent to selecting a class and  then
       pressing the ``Show'' button.

       The  middle  and  right  mouse  buttons  scroll text in different ways.  Middle-clicking lets you ``grab-
       scroll'' the text.  During grab-scrolling, the text is scrolled to follow the mouse position,  making  it
       appear  as  though  you  are dragging the text itself.  Right-clicking engages ``rate-scrolling,'' a joy-
       stick-like scrolling interface in which the scrolling rate increases as you drag the mouse away from  the
       initial click point.  For example, dragging the mouse downwards after the initial click scrolls a browser
       downwards  at  an  increasing  rate;  dragging  upwards thereafter reduces the rate until scrolling stops
       entirely at the initial click point.  Dragging up beyond this point  makes  the  browser  scroll  in  the
       reverse direction.

</pre><h4><b>KEYBOARD</b> <b>BINDINGS</b></h4><pre>
       For convenience, all menu commands have keyboard equivalents:

       <b>(^V)</b>   Scan a file or directory.

       <b>(^Q)</b>   Quit.

       <b>(^S)</b>   Search forward.

       <b>(^R)</b>   Search backward.

       <b>(^N)</b>   Go to a line.

       <u>Iclass</u> also provides keyboard commands for changing focus:

       <b>ESC</b> <b>or</b> <b>TAB</b>
              Set focus to the StringEditor showing the selected class.

       <b>CR</b>     Show  the  selected  class  (equivalent  to  pressing  the Show button) and set focus to the class
              definition.
