</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>GPIO</b>  is  a swiss army knife of a command line tool to allow the user easy access to the GPIO pins on the
       Raspberry Pi and the SPI A/D and D/A converters on the Gertboard. It's designed for  simple  testing  and
       diagnostic  purposes,  but  can be used in shell scripts for general if somewhat slow control of the GPIO
       pins.

       It can also control the IO's on the PiFace IO board and load the SPI and I2C kernel modules if required.

       Additionally, it can be used to set  the  exports  in  the  <u><a href="file:/sys/class/gpio">/sys/class/gpio</a></u>  system  directory  to  allow
       subsequent programs to use the <a href="file:/sys/class/gpio">/sys/class/gpio</a> interface without needing to be run as root.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-v</b>     Output the current version including the board revision of the Raspberry Pi.

       <b>-g</b>     Use  the  BCM_GPIO  pins numbers rather than wiringPi pin numbers.  <u>Note:</u> The BCM_GPIO pin numbers
              are always used with the export and edge commands.

       <b>-1</b>     Use the physical pin numbers rather than wiringPi pin numbers.  <u>Note:</u> that this applies to the  P1
              connector  only.  It  is  not possible to use pins on the Revision 2 P5 connector this way, and as
              with -g the BCM_GPIO pin numbers are always used with the export and edge commands.

       <b>-x</b> <b>extension</b>
              This causes the named extension to be initialised. Extensions comprise of a name  (e.g.  mcp23017)
              followed  by  a colon, then the pin-base, then more optional parameters depending on the extension
              type.  See the web page on <a href="http://wiringpi.com/the-gpio-utility/">http://wiringpi.com/the-gpio-utility/</a>

       <b>-p</b>     Use the PiFace interface board and its corresponding pin numbers. The PiFace will always appear at
              pin number 200 in the gpio command. You can assign any pin numbers you like in your  own  programs
              though.

       <b>read</b> <b>&lt;pin&gt;</b>
              Read the digital value of the given pin and print 0 or 1 to represent the respective logic levels.

       <b>write</b> <b>&lt;pin&gt;</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Write the given value (0 or 1) to the pin. You need to set the pin to output mode first.

       <b>toggle</b> <b>&lt;pin&gt;</b>
              Changes the state of a GPIO pin; 0 to 1, or 1 to 0.

              Note unlike the blink command, the pin must be in output mode first.

       <b>blink</b> <b>&lt;pin&gt;</b>
              Blinks the given pin on/off. Press Control-C to exit.

              Note: This command explicitly sets the pin to output mode.

       <b>aread</b> <b>&lt;pin&gt;</b>
              Read the analog value of the given pin. This needs to be used in conjunction with a -x flag to add
              in an extension that handles analog inputs.

              e.g. gpio -x mcp3002:200:0 aread 200

              will read the first analog input on an mcp3002 SPI ADC chip.

       <b>awrite</b> <b>&lt;pin&gt;</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Write  the  analog  value to the given pin. This needs to be used in conjunction with a -x flag to
              add in an extension that handles analog inputs.

              e.g. gpio -x mcp4802:200:0 awrite 200 128

              will write the value 128 to the first DAC port on an mcp4802 chip on the Pi's SPI bus 0.

       <b>wb</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Write the given byte to the 8 main GPIO pins. You can prefix it with 0x to specify  a  hexadecimal
              number. You need to set pins to output mode first.

       <b>readall</b>
              Output  a table of all GPIO pins values. The values represent the actual values read if the pin is
              in input mode, or the last value written if the pin is in output mode.

              The readall command is usable with an extension module (via the -x parameter), but it's unable  to
              determine pin modes or states, so will perform both a digital and analog read on each pin in-turn.

       <b>pwm</b> <b>&lt;pin&gt;</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Write a PWM value (0-1023) to the given pin. The pin needs to be put into PWM mode first.

       <b>clock</b> <b>&lt;pin&gt;</b> <b>&lt;frequency&gt;</b>
              Set the output frequency on the given pin. The pin needs to be put into clock mode first.

       <b>mode</b> <b>&lt;pin&gt;</b> <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b>
              Set  a  pin  into  <u>input</u>, <u>output</u> or <u>pwm</u> mode. Can also use the literals <u>up</u>, <u>down</u> or <u>tri</u> to set the
              internal pull-up, pull-down or tristate (off) controls.

              The ALT modes can also be set using <u>alt0</u>, <u>alt1</u>,  ... <u>alt5</u>.

       <b>unexportall</b>
              Un-Export all the GPIO pins in the <a href="file:/sys/class/gpio">/sys/class/gpio</a> directory.

       <b>exports</b>
              Print a list (if any) of all the exported GPIO pins and their current values.

       <b>export</b> Export a GPIO pin in the <u><a href="file:/sys/class/gpio">/sys/class/gpio</a></u> directory. Use like the mode command above  however  only
              <u>in</u>,  <u>out</u>, <u>high</u> and low are supported at this time. Note that the pin number is the <b>BCM_GPIO</b> number
              and not the wiringPi number. The <u>high</u> and <u>low</u> commands pre-set the output value at the  same  time
              as the export to output mode.

              Once   a   GPIO   pin   has  been  exported,  the  <b>gpio</b>  program  changes  the  ownership  of  the
              <u>/sys/class/gpio/gpioX/value</u> and if present in later kernels, the <u>/sys/class/gpio/gpioX/edge</u> pseudo
              files to that of the user running the <b>gpio</b> program. This means that you can have a small script of
              gpio exports to setup the gpio pins as your program requires without the need to run  anything  as
              root, or with the sudo command.

       <b>edge</b>   This  exports  a GPIO pin in the <u><a href="file:/sys/class/gpio">/sys/class/gpio</a></u> directory, set the direction to input and set the
              edge interrupt method to <u>none</u>, <u>rising</u>, <u>falling</u> or <u>both</u>.  Use like the  export  command  above  and
              note that <b>BCM_GPIO</b> pin number is used not not wiringPi pin numbering.

              Like  the export commands above, ownership is set to that of the calling user, allowing subsequent
              access from user programs without requiring root/sudo.

       <b>unexport</b>
              Un-Export a GPIO pin in the <a href="file:/sys/class/gpio">/sys/class/gpio</a> directory.

       <b>wfi</b> <b>&lt;pin&gt;</b> <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b>
              This set the given pin to the supplied interrupt mode: rising, falling or both then waits for  the
              interrupt to happen. It's a non-busy wait, so does not consume and CPU while it's waiting.

       <b>drive</b>  group value

              Change  the pad driver value for the given pad group to the supplied drive value. Group is 0, 1 or
              2 and value is 0-7. Do not use unless you are absolutely sure you know what you're doing.

       <b>usbp</b>   high | low

              Change the USB current limiter to high (1.2 amps)  or  low  (the  default,  600mA)  This  is  only
              applicable to the Model B+ and the Model B, v2.

       <b>pwm-bal/pwm-ms</b>
              Change the PWM mode to balanced (the default) or mark:space ratio (traditional)

       <b>pwmr</b>   Change the PWM range register. The default is 1024.

       <b>gbr</b>    channel

              This  reads  the  analog  to  digital  converter  on the Gertboard on the given channel. The board
              jumpers need to be in-place to do this operation.

       <b>gbw</b>    channel value

              This writes the supplied value to the output channel on the Gertboards  SPI  digital  to  analogue
              converter.  The board jumpers need to be in-place to do this operation.

</pre><h4><b>WiringPi</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>BCM_GPIO</b> <b>Pin</b> <b>numbering</b> <b>vs.</b> <b>Physical</b> <b>pin</b> <b>numbering</b></h4><pre>
       The quickest way to get a list of the pin differences is to run the command

       gpio readall

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>gpio</u>                  executable

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       gpio mode 4 output # Set pin 4 to output

       gpio -g mode 23 output # Set GPIO pin 23 to output (same as WiringPi pin 4)

       gpio mode 1 pwm # Set pin 1 to PWM mode

       gpio pwm 1 512 # Set pin 1 to PWM value 512 - half brightness

       gpio export 17 out # Set GPIO Pin 17 to output

       gpio export 0 in # Set GPIO Pin 0 (SDA0) to input.

       gpio -g read 0 # Read GPIO Pin 0 (SDA0)

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       When  using the <u>export</u>, <u>edge</u> or <u>unexport</u> commands, the pin numbers are <b>always</b> native BCM_GPIO numbers and
       never wiringPi pin numbers.

       As of kernels 4.1.7, a user-level GPIO access mechanism is available, however wiringPi will not use  this
       by  default  -  because  at  this time there appears to be issues when trying to program the PWM or clock
       output hardware. If you can live without PWM or GPIO clocks and you want to use the GPIO from a  non-root
       program,  then  you need to make sure that the module <u>bcm2835_gpiomem</u> is loaded at boot time. This should
       happen automatically when you enable the device tree in raspi-config. You may also need  some  additional
       information in <a href="file:/etc/udev/rules.d/">/etc/udev/rules.d/</a> to change the mode and ownership of the /dev/gpiomem file. Finally, you
       need  to  set  the  environment  variable <u>WIRINGPI_GPIOMEM</u>. This will go-away in future releases once the
       /dev/gpiomem interface is fully operational.
