       Minimum unique abbreviation of option is acceptable.  You may use double hyphens instead of single hyphen
       to denote options.  You may use white space in place of the equals sign to separate an option  name  from
       its value.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This program is part of <b><a href="../man1/Netpbm.1.html">Netpbm</a></b>(1).

       <b>pamtojpeg2k</b>  converts  the  named PBM, PGM, PPM, or PAM file, or Standard Input if no file is named, to a
       JPEG-2000 code stream (JPC) file on Standard Output.

       The JPEG-2000 specification specifies two separate formats: JP2 and JPEG-2000  code  stream  (JPC).   JP2
       represents  a  visual  image  quite specifically, whereas JPC is a more or less arbitrary array of codes.
       <b>pamtojpeg2k</b> can't produce a JP2, but the JPC image that <b>pamtojpeg2k</b> produces is very similar to a JP2  if
       the  input is a PBM, PGM, or PPM image or equivalent PAM image.  One difference is that the RGB intensity
       values in a JP2 are SRGB values, while <b>pamtojpeg2k</b> produces ITU-R Recommendation  BT.709  values.   Those
       are  very  similar,  but  not  identical.  Another difference is that a JP2 can contain extra information
       about an image that JPC cannot.

       When the input is a PAM image other than a PBM, PGM, or PPM equivalent, the JPC raster produced  contains
       whatever  the PAM raster does.  It can have any number of planes with any meanings; the planes are in the
       same order in the JPC output as in the PAM input.

       A JPC image has a "precision," which is the  number  of  bits  used  for  each  code  (in  Netpbm  lingo,
       "sample").  Actually, it has a separate precision for each component.  <b>pamtojpeg2k</b> uses for the precision
       of  every  component  the  least  number of bits that can represent the maxval of the input image.  A JPC
       image does not have an independent concept of maxval; the maxval of a JPC sample  is  the  maximum  value
       that  the  number  of  bits  specified  by  the precision can represent in pure binary code.  E.g. if the
       precision is 4, the maxval is 15.  <b>pamtojpeg2k</b> does of course scale the  sample  values  from  the  input
       maxval  to  the  output maxval.  Example: The input maxval is 99.  This means JPC precision is 7 bits and
       the JPC maxval is 127.  A sample value of 33 in the input becomes a sample value of 43 in the output.

       <b>pamtojpeg2k</b> generates the JPC output with  the  Jasper JPEG-2000 library  .   See  documentation  of  the
       library  for  details on what <b>pamtojpeg2k</b> produces.  Note that the Jasper library contains facilities for
       reading PNM images, but <b>pamtojpeg2k</b> does not use those.  It uses the Netpbm library instead.   Note  that
       the  makers  of  the Jasper library write it "JasPer," but Netpbm documentation follows standard American
       English typography rules, which don't allow that kind of capitalization.

       Use <b>jpeg2ktopam</b> to convert in the other direction.

       The program <b>jasper</b>, which is packaged with the Jasper JPEG-2000 library, also converts between  JPEG-2000
       and  PNM  formats.  Because it's packaged with the library, it may exploit it better, especially recently
       added features.  However, since it does not use the Netpbm library to read and write the Netpbm  formats,
       it doesn't do as good a job on that side.

       Another format with goals similar to those of JPEG-2000 but that allows for faster encoding and decoding,
       is JPEG-LS .  CharLS  is a package of software for using JPEG-LS.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       In  addition  to  the options common to all programs based on libnetpbm (most notably <b>-quiet</b>, see  Common
       Options ), <b>pamtojpeg2k</b> recognizes the following command line options:

   <b>Jasper</b> <b>Library</b> <b>Options</b>
       These options are identical in name  and  function  to  options  that  the  Jasper  library  JPC  encoder
       subroutine takes.  See Jasper documentation  for details.

       <b>-imgareatlx=</b><u>column</u>

       <b>-imgareatly=</b><u>row</u>

       <b>-tilegrdtlx=</b><u>column</u>

       <b>-tilegrdtly=</b><u>row</u>

       <b>-tilewidth=</b><u>columns</u>

       <b>-tileheight=</b><u>rows</u>

       <b>-prcwidth=</b><u>columns</u>

       <b>-prcheight=</b><u>rows</u>

       <b>-cblkwidth=</b><u>columns</u>

       <b>-cblkheight=</b><u>rows</u>

       <b>-mode=</b>{<b>integer</b>|<b>int</b>|<b>real</b>}

       <b>-ilyrrates=</b>[<u>realnumber</u>[,<u>realnumber</u>, ...]]

       <b>-numrlvls=</b><u>number</u>

       <b>-progression=</b>{<b>lrcp</b>|<b>rlcp</b>|<b>rpcl</b>|<b>pcrl</b>|<b>cprl</b>}

       <b>-numgbits=</b><u>number</u>

       <b>-nomct</b>

       <b>-sop</b>

       <b>-eph</b>

       <b>-lazy</b>

       <b>-termall</b>

       <b>-segsym</b>

       <b>-vcausal</b>

       <b>-pterm</b>

       <b>-resetprob</b>

       <b>-ilyrrates</b> ('intermediate layer rates') lets you control
         the compression at each layer.  The compressed image is arranged in layers,
         so if you transmit it somewhere serially, enough information to make a low
         quality image arrives soon, then later more information arrives to improve
         the quality of the image, and so on until the entire image arrives.  The
         value of this option is a list of ascending fractions, such as
         '.1,.3,.5'.  Each fraction says the size of the layers up to and
         including that layer should add up to that fraction of the size of the input
         image.  If the size of the entire image is limited by <b>-compression</b>
         or <b>-size</b>, none of these numbers may exceed that limit.

   <b>Other</b> <b>Options</b>
       <b>-compression=</b><u>ratio</u>
              <u>ratio</u>  is  a  floating point number that specifies the compression ratio.  <b>pamtojpeg2k</b> will adjust
              quality as necessary to ensure that you get this compression ratio.  E.g. 4 means the output  will
              be about one fourth the size in bytes of the input file.

              The  ratio  concerns just the raster part of the image, with the denominator being what the raster
              would take if it were encoded the most naive way possible (e.g. 3 bytes per  pixel  in  8-bit-per-
              sample  RGB).   It does, however, include metadata that is part of the compressed raster.  Because
              of that, it may not be possible to give you your requested compression ratio at any  quality.   If
              it isn't, <b>pamtojpeg2k</b> fails with a message saying so.

              If you don't specify this option, <b>pamtojpeg2k</b> gives you the best compression it can without losing
              any quality.  Because of the metadata issue described above, this may mean, for a small image, the
              image actually expands.

              This option controls the 'rate' option of the Jasper library.  Note that though the Jasper library
              takes  a compression factor, this option specifies a compression ratio.  The compression factor is
              the multiplicative inverse of (1 divided by) the compression ratio.

              You may not specify this with <b>-size</b>.

              Before Netpbm 10.61 (December 2012), the default was a compression ratio of 1, and if  <b>pamtojpeg2k</b>
              could  not  make  the  output that small, it just made it as small as it could, with zero quality.
              You know this is happening when you see the warning message, "empty layer generated."

       <b>-size=</b><u>bytes</u>
              This option specifies the maximum size in bytes you want the output image to have.  This  size  is
              all-in,  including  headers  and  trailers  and  other  metadata.   <b>pamtojpeg2k</b>  will omit as much
              information as necessary to get under this limit.

              It is possible to specify a value impossibly small, for example a value that  doesn't  even  leave
              room for the image header.  If you do this, the program fails with an explanatory message.

              This option controls the 'rate' option of the Jasper library.

              You may not specify this with <b>-compression</b>.

              This option was new in Netpbm 11.1 (December 2022).

       <b>-verbose</b>
              This option causes <b>pamtojpeg2k</b> to issue informational messages about the conversion process.

       <b>-debuglevel</b>=<u>number</u>
              This  option  controls  debug  messages from the Jasper library.  <b>pamtojpeg2k</b> passes <u>number</u> as the
              debug level to the Jasper JPC encoder.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This example compresses losslessly.

         pamtojpeg2k myimg.ppm &gt;myimg.jpc

       <b>jpeg2ktopam</b> will recreate myimg.ppm exactly.

       This example compresses the file to one tenth its original size, throwing away information as necessary.

         pamtojpeg2k -compression=10 myimg.pgm &gt;myimg.jpc

</pre><h4><b>ABOUT</b> <b>JPEG-2000</b></h4><pre>
       JPEG-2000 is a format that compresses a visual image (or a similar set of data) into a minimal number  of
       bytes  for  storage  or transmission.  In that, its goal is similar to JPEG.  It has two main differences
       from JPEG.

       One difference is that it does a much better job on most images of throwing out information in  order  to
       achieve  a smaller output.  That means when you reconstruct the image from the resulting compressed file,
       it looks a lot closer to the image you started with JPEG-2000 than with JPEG,  for  the  same  compressed
       file  size.  Or, looked at another way, with JPEG-2000 you get a much smaller file than with JPEG for the
       same image quality.

       The second difference is that with JPEG-2000, you decide how much compression you want and the compressor
       adjusts the quality to meet your requirement, whereas with JPEG, you decide how much quality you want and
       the compressor adjusts the size of the output to meet your requirement.  I.e. with JPEG-2000, the quality
       of the result depends on the compressibility of the input, but with JPEG, the <u>size</u> of the result  depends
       on the compressibility of the input.

       With  JPEG-2000,  you  can  specify  lossless compression, thus making it compete with GIF and PNG.  With
       standard JPEG, you always lose something.  (There are rumored to be variations of JPEG  around  that  are
       lossless, though).

       JPEG  is  much  older  than  JPEG-2000  and far more popular.  JPEG is one of the half dozen most popular
       graphics formats and virtually all graphics facilities understand it.  JPEG-2000 is virtually unknown.

       There is no compatibility between JPEG and JPEG-2000.  Programs that read JPEG do not automatically  read
       JPEG-2000 and vice versa.
