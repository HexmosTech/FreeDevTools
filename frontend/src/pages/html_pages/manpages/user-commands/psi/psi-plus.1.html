</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       psi-plus - Qt-based XMPP client (basic version)

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>psi-plus</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Psi</b>  <b>IM</b>  is  a  capable  XMPP  client  aimed  at  experienced  users. Its design goals are simplicity and
       stability. Psi IM is highly portable and runs on MS Windows, GNU/Linux and macOS.

       Psi IM is minimal but powerful. There are keybindings for just about  everything,  Unicode  is  supported
       throughout  and  contacts are cached offline. Security is also a major consideration, and Psi IM provides
       it for both client-to-server (TLS) and client-to-client (GnuPG, OTR, OMEMO).

       WebKit version of Psi IM has few additional features (in comparing with basic version of Psi): support of
       animated emoticons, support of (adium) themes in private chats and group chats, support of previewing  of
       images and videos in private chats and group chats, etc. But if you prefer old fashioned plain text chats
       from era of IRC heyday, then basic version of Psi IM is your obvious choice.

       In  2009  a  Psi  IM  fork  named Psi+ was started. Project purposes are: implementation of new features,
       writing of patches and plugins for transferring them to upstream. As of 2017 all active  Psi+  developers
       have  become  official Psi IM developers, but Psi+ still has a number of unique features. From developers
       point of view Psi+ is just a development branch of Psi IM which is hosted at  separate  git  repositories
       and for which rolling release development model is used.
