       db5.3_hotbackup - Create "hot backup" or "hot failover" snapshots

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>db5.3_hotbackup</b> [-cDuVv] [-d data_dir ...] [-h home] [-l log_dir] [-P password] -b backup_dir

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  db5.3_hotbackup  utility  creates  "hot  backup" or "hot failover" snapshots of Berkeley DB database
       environments.

       The db5.3_hotbackup utility performs the following steps:

              1.     If the -c option is specified, checkpoint the source home database environment, and  remove
                     any unnecessary log files.

              2.     If  the target directory for the backup does not exist, it is created with mode read-write-
                     execute for the owner.

                     If the target directory for the backup does exist and the -u option was specified, all  log
                     files in the target directory are removed; if the -u option was not specified, all files in
                     the target directory are removed.

              3.     If  the  -u option was not specified, copy application-specific files found in the database
                     environment home directory, or any directory specified using the -d option, into the target
                     directory for the backup.

              4.     Copy all log files found in the directory specified by the -l option (or  in  the  database
                     environment  home  directory, if no -l option was specified), into the target directory for
                     the backup.

              5.     Perform catastrophic recovery on the hot backup.

              6.     Remove any unnecessary log files from the hot backup.

       The db5.3_hotbackup utility does not resolve  pending  transactions  that  are  in  the  prepared  state.
       Applications  that  use DB_TXN-&gt;prepare should specify DB_RECOVER_FATAL when opening the environment, and
       run DB_ENV-&gt;txn_recover to resolve any pending transactions, when failing over to the hot backup.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-b</b>     Specify the target directory for the backup.

       <b>-c</b>     Before performing the snapshot, checkpoint the source database  environment  and  remove  any  log
              files  that  are  no  longer  required  in that environment.  <b>To</b> <b>avoid</b> <b>making</b> <b>catastrophic</b> <b>failure</b>
              <b>impossible,</b> <b>log</b> <b>file</b> <b>removal</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>log</b> <b>file</b> <b>archival.</b>

       <b>-d</b>     Specify one or more source directories that contain databases; if none is specified, the  database
              environment home directory will be searched for database files.  As database files are copied into
              a  single  backup  directory,  files named the same, stored in different source directories, could
              overwrite each other when copied into the backup directory.

       <b>-h</b>     Specify the source directory for the backup, that is, the database environment home directory.

       <b>-l</b>     Specify a source directory that contains log files; if none is specified, the database environment
              home directory will be searched for log files.

       <b>-P</b>     Specify an environment password.  Although Berkeley DB utilities  overwrite  password  strings  as
              soon  as  possible,  be aware there may be a window of vulnerability on systems where unprivileged
              users can see command-line arguments or where utilities are  not  able  to  overwrite  the  memory
              containing the command-line arguments.

       <b>-u</b>     Update  a  pre-existing  hot  backup  snapshot  by  copying in new log files.  If the <b>-u</b> option is
              specified, no databases will be copied into the target directory.

       <b>-V</b>     Write the library version number to the standard output, and exit.

       <b>-v</b>     Run in verbose mode, listing operations as they are done.

       <b>-D</b>     Use the data directories listed in the DB_CONFIG  configuration  file  in  the  source  directory.
              This option has three effects: First, if they do not already exist, the specified data directories
              will be created relative to the target directory (with mode read-write-execute owner). Second, all
              files  in  the  source  data  directories  will  be copied to the target data directories.  If the
              DB_CONFIG file specifies one or more absolute pathnames, files in those source directories will be
              copied to the top-level target directory. Third, the DB_CONFIG configuration file will  be  copied
              from  the  +source  directory  to the target directory, and subsequently used for configuration if
              recovery is run in the target directory.

       Care should be taken with the <b>-D</b> option and data directories which  are  named  relative  to  the  source
       directory  but  are  not  subdirectories (that is, the name includes the element "..")  Specifically, the
       constructed target directory names must be meaningful and  distinct  from  the  source  directory  names,
       otherwise running recovery in the target directory might corrupt the source data files.

       <b>It</b>  <b>is</b>  <b>an</b> <b>error</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>absolute</b> <b>pathnames</b> <b>for</b> <b>data</b> <b>directories</b> <b>or</b> <b>the</b> <b>log</b> <b>directory</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>mode,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b>
       <b>DB_CONFIG</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>file</b> <b>copied</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>directory</b> <b>would</b> <b>then</b> <b>point</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b>  <b>directories</b>
       <b>and</b> <b>running</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>would</b> <b>corrupt</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>data</b> <b>files.</b>

       The  db5.3_hotbackup  utility  uses  a  Berkeley  DB  environment  (as  described  for the <b>-h</b> option, the
       environment variable <b>DB_HOME</b>, or because the utility was run in a  directory  containing  a  Berkeley  DB
       environment).   In  order  to  avoid  environment  corruption  when  using  a  Berkeley  DB  environment,
       db5.3_hotbackup should always be given the chance to detach from the environment and exit gracefully.  To
       cause db5.3_hotbackup to release all environment resources and exit cleanly, send it an interrupt  signal
       (SIGINT).

       The db5.3_hotbackup utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error occurs.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>DB_HOME</b>
              If  the  <b>-h</b> option is not specified and the environment variable DB_HOME is set, it is used as the
              path of the database home, as described in DB_ENV-&gt;open.
