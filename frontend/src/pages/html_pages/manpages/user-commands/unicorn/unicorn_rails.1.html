</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       unicorn_rails - unicorn launcher for Rails 1.x and 2.x users

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       unicorn_rails [-c CONFIG_FILE] [-E RAILS_ENV] [-D] [RACKUP_FILE]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  <a href="../man1/rackup.1.html">rackup</a>(1)-like  command to launch ancient Rails (2.x and earlier) applications using Unicorn.  Rails 3
       (and later) support Rack natively, so users are encouraged to use <a href="../man1/unicorn.1.html">unicorn</a>(1) instead of <a href="../man1/unicorn_rails.1.html">unicorn_rails</a>(1).

       It is expected to be started in your Rails application root (RAILS_ROOT), but the "working_directory" di‐
       rective may be used in the CONFIG_FILE.

       The outward interface resembles <a href="../man1/rackup.1.html">rackup</a>(1), the internals and default middleware loading is designed  like
       the script/server command distributed with Rails.

       While  Unicorn takes a myriad of command-line options for compatibility with <a href="../man1/ruby.1.html">ruby</a>(1) and <a href="../man1/rackup.1.html">rackup</a>(1), it is
       recommended to stick to the few command-line options specified in the SYNOPSIS and use the CONFIG_FILE as
       much as possible.

</pre><h4><b>UNICORN</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-c,</b> <b>--config-file</b> <b>CONFIG_FILE</b>
              Path to the Unicorn-specific config file.  The config file is implemented as a Ruby DSL,  so  Ruby
              code  may  executed.  See the RDoc/ri for the <u>Unicorn::Configurator</u> class for the full list of di‐
              rectives available from the DSL.  Using an absolute path for for CONFIG_FILE is recommended as  it
              makes multiple instances of Unicorn easily distinguishable when viewing <a href="../man1/ps.1.html">ps</a>(1) output.

       <b>-D,</b> <b>--daemonize</b>
              Run daemonized in the background.  The process is detached from the controlling terminal and stdin
              is redirected to "/dev/null".  Unlike many common UNIX daemons, we do not chdir to "/" upon daemo‐
              nization  to  allow  more  control over the startup/upgrade process.  Unless specified in the CON‐
              FIG_FILE, stderr and stdout will also be redirected to "/dev/null".  Daemonization will <u>skip</u> load‐
              ing of the <u>Rails::Rack::LogTailer</u> middleware under Rails &gt;= 2.3.x.  By  default,  <a href="../man1/unicorn_rails.1.html">unicorn_rails</a>(1)
              will  create a PID file in <u>"RAILS_ROOT/tmp/pids/unicorn.pid"</u>.  You may override this by specifying
              the "pid" directive to override this Unicorn config file.

       <b>-E,</b> <b>--env</b> <b>RAILS_ENV</b>
              Run under the given RAILS_ENV.  This sets the RAILS_ENV environment variable.   Acceptable  values
              are exactly those you expect in your Rails application, typically "development" or "production".

       <b>-l,</b> <b>--listen</b> <b>ADDRESS</b>
              Listens  on  a given ADDRESS.  ADDRESS may be in the form of HOST:PORT or PATH, HOST:PORT is taken
              to mean a TCP socket and PATH is meant to be  a  path  to  a  UNIX  domain  socket.   Defaults  to
              "0.0.0.0:8080" (all addresses on TCP port 8080).  For production deployments, specifying the "lis‐
              ten" directive in CONFIG_FILE is recommended as it allows fine-tuning of socket options.

</pre><h4><b>RACKUP</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-o,</b> <b>--host</b> <b>HOST</b>
              Listen on a TCP socket belonging to HOST, default is "0.0.0.0" (all addresses).  If specified mul‐
              tiple times on the command-line, only the last-specified value takes effect.  This option only ex‐
              ists  for  compatibility  with the <a href="../man1/rackup.1.html">rackup</a>(1) command, use of "-l"/"--listen" switch is recommended
              instead.

       <b>-p,</b> <b>--port</b> <b>PORT</b>
              Listen on the specified TCP PORT, default is 8080.   If  specified  multiple  times  on  the  com‐
              mand-line,  only the last-specified value takes effect.  This option only exists for compatibility
              with the <a href="../man1/rackup.1.html">rackup</a>(1) command, use of "-l"/"--listen" switch is recommended instead.

       <b>--path</b> <b>PATH</b>
              Mounts the Rails application at the given PATH (instead of "/").  This is  equivalent  to  setting
              the RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT environment variable.  This is only supported under Rails 2.3 or later
              at the moment.

</pre><h4><b>RUBY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>-e,</b> <b>--eval</b> <b>LINE</b>
              Evaluate  a  LINE  of Ruby code.  This evaluation happens immediately as the command-line is being
              parsed.

       <b>-d,</b> <b>--debug</b>
              Turn on debug mode, the $DEBUG variable is set to true.   For  Rails  &gt;=  2.3.x,  this  loads  the
              <u>Rails::Rack::Debugger</u> middleware.

       <b>-w,</b> <b>--warn</b>
              Turn on verbose warnings, the $VERBOSE variable is set to true.

       <b>-I,</b> <b>--include</b> <b>PATH</b>
              specify  $LOAD_PATH.   PATH will be prepended to $LOAD_PATH.  The ':' character may be used to de‐
              limit multiple directories.  This  directive  may  be  used  more  than  once.   Modifications  to
              $LOAD_PATH take place immediately and in the order they were specified on the command-line.

       <b>-r,</b> <b>--require</b> <b>LIBRARY</b>
              require a specified LIBRARY before executing the application.  The "require" statement will be ex‐
              ecuted immediately and in the order they were specified on the command-line.

</pre><h4><b>RACKUP</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       This  defaults to "config.ru" in RAILS_ROOT.  It should be the same file used by <a href="../man1/rackup.1.html">rackup</a>(1) and other Rack
       launchers, it uses the <u>Rack::Builder</u> DSL.  Unlike many other Rack applications, RACKUP_FILE is completely
       <u>optional</u> for Rails, but may be used to disable some of the default middleware for performance.

       Embedded command-line options are mostly parsed for compatibility with <a href="../man1/rackup.1.html">rackup</a>(1)  but  strongly  discour‐
       aged.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       The RAILS_ENV variable is set by the aforementioned -E switch.  The RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT is set by the
       aforementioned --path switch.  Either of these variables may also be set in the shell or the Unicorn CON‐
       FIG_FILE.   All  application  or library-specific environment variables (e.g. TMPDIR, RAILS_ASSET_ID) may
       always be set in the Unicorn CONFIG_FILE in addition to the spawning shell.  When transparently upgrading
       Unicorn, all environment variables set in the old master process are inherited by the new master process.
       Unicorn only uses (and will overwrite) the UNICORN_FD environment variable internally when  doing  trans‐
       parent upgrades.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       The following UNIX signals may be sent to the master process:

       • HUP - reload config file, app, and gracefully restart all workers

       • INT/TERM - quick shutdown, kills all workers immediately

       • QUIT - graceful shutdown, waits for workers to finish their current request before finishing.

       • USR1  -  reopen  all logs owned by the master and all workers See Unicorn::Util.reopen_logs for what is
         considered a log.

       • USR2 - reexecute the running binary.  A separate QUIT should be sent to the original process  once  the
         child is verified to be up and running.

       • WINCH  -  gracefully  stops  workers  but  keep the master running.  This will only work for daemonized
         processes.

       • TTIN - increment the number of worker processes by one

       • TTOU - decrement the number of worker processes by one

       See the SIGNALS (https://yhbt.net/unicorn/SIGNALS.html) document for full description of all signals used
       by Unicorn.
