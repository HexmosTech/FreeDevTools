       firehol-nat - set up NAT and port redirections

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       { nat to-destination | dnat [to] } <u>ipaddr</u>[:<u>port</u>] [random] [persistent] [id <u>id</u>] [at <u>chain</u>] [<u>rule-params</u>]

       { nat to-source | snat [to] } <u>ipaddr</u>[:<u>port</u>] [random] [persistent] [id <u>id</u>] [at <u>chain</u>] [<u>rule-params</u>]

       { nat redirect-to | redirect [to] } <u>port</u>[-<u>range</u>] [random] [id <u>id</u>] [at <u>chain</u>] [<u>rule-params</u>]

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Destination NAT is provided by nat to-destination and its synonym dnat.

       Source NAT is provided by nat to-source and its synonym snat.

       Redirection to a port on the local host is provided by nat redirect-to and its synonym redirect.

       The <u>port</u> part of the new address is optional with SNAT and DNAT; if not specified it will not be changed.

       When  you  apply  NAT to a packet, the Linux kernel will track the changes it makes, so that when it sees
       replies the transformation will be applied in the opposite direction.  For instance if  you  changed  the
       destination  port  of  a  packet from 80 to 8080, when a reply comes back, its source is set as 80.  This
       means the original sender is not aware a transformation is happening.

       This means that NAT is only applied on the first packet of each connection (the nat FireHOL helper always
       appends state NEW to NAT statements).

       The NAT helper can be used to setup load balancing.  Check the section BALANCING below.

              <b>Note</b>

              The <u>rule-params</u> are used only to determine the traffic that will  be  matched  for  NAT  in  these
              commands, not to permit traffic to flow.

              Applying  NAT  does  not  automatically create rules to allow the traffic to pass.  You will still
              need to include client or server entries in an interface or router to allow the traffic.

              When using dnat or redirect, the transformation is in the PREROUTING chain of the  NAT  table  and
              happens before normal rules are matched, so your client or server rule should match the “modified”
              traffic.

              When using snat, the transformation is in the POSTROUTING chain of the NAT table and happens after
              normal rules are matched, so your client or server rule should match the “unmodified” traffic.

              See  the   <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Netfilter-packet-flow.svg">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Netfilter-packet-flow.svg</a>  netfilter
              flow dia‐ gram if you would like to see how network packets are processed by the kernel in detail.

       The  at  keyword allows setting a different chain to attach the rules.  For dnat and redirect the default
       is PREROUTING, but OUTPUT is also supported.  For snat the default is  POSTROUTING,  but  INPUT  is  also
       supported.

       random will randomise the port mapping involved, to ensure the ports used are not predictable.

       persistent  is  used  when  the statement is given alternatives (i.e.  many destination servers for dnat,
       many source IPs for snat, many ports for redirect).  It will attempt to keep each client on the same  nat
       map.  See below for more information about persistence.

       The nat helper takes one of the following sub-commands:

       to-destination <u>ipaddr</u>[:<u>port</u>]
              Defines  a Destination NAT (DNAT).  Commonly thought of as port-forwarding (where packets destined
              for the firewall with a given port and protocol are sent to a different IP  address  and  possibly
              port),  DNAT  is  much  more  flexible  in that any number of parameters can be matched before the
              destination information is rewritten.

              <u>ipaddr</u>[:<u>port</u>] is the destination address to be set in packets matching <u>rule-params</u>.

              If no rules are given, all forwarded traffic will be matched.  outface should not be used in  DNAT
              since the information is not available at the time the decision is made.

              <u>ipaddr</u>[:<u>port</u>]  accepts any --to-destination values that <a href="../man8/iptables.8.html">iptables</a>(8) accepts.  Run iptables -j DNAT
              --help for more information.  Multiple <u>ipaddr</u>[:<u>port</u>] may be specified by  separating  with  spaces
              and enclosing with quotes.

       to-source <u>ipaddr</u>[:<u>port</u>]
              Defines  a Source NAT (SNAT).  SNAT is similar to masquerading but is more efficient for static IP
              addresses.  You can use it to give a public IP address to a host which does not  have  one  behind
              the firewall.  See also <a href="../man5/firehol-masquerade.5.html">firehol-masquerade</a>(5).

              <u>ipaddr</u>[:<u>port</u>] is the source address to be set in packets matching <u>rule-params</u>.

              If  no  rules are given, all forwarded traffic will be matched.  inface should not be used in SNAT
              since the information is not available at the time the decision is made.

              <u>ipaddr</u>[:<u>port</u>] accepts any --to-source values that  <a href="../man8/iptables.8.html">iptables</a>(8)  accepts.   Run  iptables  -j  SNAT
              --help  for  more  information.  Multiple <u>ipaddr</u>[:<u>port</u>] may be specified by separating with spaces
              and enclosing with quotes.

       redirect-to <u>port</u>[-<u>range</u>]
              Redirect matching traffic to the local machine.  This is typically useful if you want to intercept
              some traffic and process it on the local machine.

              <u>port</u>[-<u>range</u>] is the port range (from-to) or single port that packets matching <u>rule-params</u> will  be
              redirected to.

              If  no  rules  are  given,  all  forwarded traffic will be matched.  outface should not be used in
              REDIRECT since the information is not available at the time the decision is made.

</pre><h4><b>BALANCING</b></h4><pre>
       NAT can balance multiple servers (or IPs in case of snat) when a range is specified.  This is handled  by
       the kernel.

       Example:

              dnat4 to 10.0.0.1-10.0.0.10 persistent proto tcp dst 1.1.1.1 dport 80

       In  the  above  example,  the Linux kernel will give a persistent server to all the sockets of any single
       client.

       FireHOL can also setup balancing using a  round-robin  or  weighted  average  distribution  of  requests.
       However persistent cannot be used (the Linux kernel applies persistence on a single NAT statement).

   <b>Round</b> <b>Robin</b> <b>distribution</b>
       To  enable  round robin distribution, give multiple to values, space separated and enclosed in quotes, or
       comma separated.

       Example:

               dnat4 to 10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2,10.0.0.3 proto tcp dst 1.1.1.1 port 80
               # or
               dnat4 to "10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2 10.0.0.3" proto tcp dst 1.1.1.1 port 80

       Ports can also be given per IP:

               dnat4 to 10.0.0.1:70,10.0.0.2:80,10.0.0.3:90 proto tcp dst 1.1.1.1 port 80
               # or
               dnat4 to "10.0.0.1:70 10.0.0.2:80 10.0.0.3:90" proto tcp dst 1.1.1.1 port 80

   <b>Weighted</b> <b>distribution</b>
       To enable weighted distribution, append a slash with the weight requested for each entry.

       FireHOL adds all the weights given and calculates the percentage of traffic each entry should receive.

       Example:

               dnat4 to 10.0.0.1/30,10.0.0.2/30,10.0.0.3/40 proto tcp dst 1.1.1.1 port 80
               # or
               dnat4 to "10.0.0.1/30 10.0.0.2/30 10.0.0.3/40" proto tcp dst 1.1.1.1 port 80
               # or
               dnat4 to 10.0.0.1:70/30,10.0.0.2:80/30,10.0.0.3:90/40 proto tcp dst 1.1.1.1 port 80
               # or
               dnat4 to "10.0.0.1:70/30 10.0.0.2:80/30 10.0.0.3:90/40" proto tcp dst 1.1.1.1 port 80

   <b>PERSISTENCE</b>
       The kernel supports persistence only if the NAT alternatives are contiguous (i.e. dnat to  A-B,  snat  to
       A-B,  redirect  to  1000:1010, etc).  If they are contiguous, persistence is left at the kernel.  FireHOL
       does nothing.

       If the alternatives are not contiguous, FireHOL will use the <u>recent</u> iptables module to apply  persistence
       itself.

       FireHOL supports mixed mode persistence.  For example, you can have something like this:

              dnat to A-B/70,C-D/20,F/10 persistence id mybalancer

       The above is a weighted distribution of persistence.  Group A-B will get 70%, C-D 20% and server F 10%.

       Using the above, FireHOL will apply its persistence to pick one of the groups A-B, or C-D, or F. Once the
       group  has been picked by FireHOL, the kernel will apply persistence within the group, to pick the server
       that will handle the request.

       The FireHOL persistence works like this:

       1. A packet is received that should be NATed

       2. A lookup is made using the <u>recent</u> module to find if it has been seen before.  The source IP of  packet
          is looked up.

       3. If  it  has  been  seen  before,  the connection is mapped the same way the last time was mapped.  The
          <u>recent</u> module is updated too.

       4. If it has not been seen before, the connection is mapped using the distribution method specified.  The
          <u>recent</u> module is updated too, to be ready for the next connection.

       The <u>recent</u> module has a few limitations:

       1. It has lookup tables.  We need one lookup table for each member of of the NAT.  FireHOL  uses  the  id
          parameter  and  the  definition of each alternative in the NAT statement to form a name for the lookup
          table.  These lookup tables are persistent to firewall restarts, this is why FireHOL requires from you
          to set an id.

       2. It can keep entries in its lookup tables for a given time.  FireHOL sets this to  3600  seconds.   You
          can control it by setting FIREHOL_NAT_PERSISTENCE_SECONDS.

       3. It  has  a  limit  on  the  number of entries in the lookup tables.  FireHOL cannot set this.  This is
          kernel module option.  The default is 200 entries.

                   parm:           ip_pkt_list_tot:number of packets per IP address to remember (max. 255) (uint)

           You have to consult your distribution documentation to set these.  You can find their current  values
           by  examining  files  found  in  /sys/module/xt_recent/parameters/ Unfortunately, these files are not
           writable, so to change parameters you have unload and reload the module (i.e. apply a  firewall  that
           does  not use the <u>recent</u> module, rmmod xt_recent, change the parameter, re-apply a firewall that uses
           the <u>recent</u> module).

           Normally, you will need a line in /etc/modprobe.d/netfitler.conf like this:

                  options xt_recent ip_list_tot=16384

           The number 16384 I used is  the  max  number  of  unique  client  IPs  I  expect  to  have  per  hour
           (FIREHOL_NAT_PERSISTENCE_SECONDS) for this service.

           ip_list_hash_size  is  calculated  by  kernel  when the module is loaded to be bigger and up to twice
           ip_list_tot.

       Once you have the balancer running, you can find its lookup tables in  /proc/net/xt_recent/.   There  you
       will find files starting with the <u>id</u> parameter, one file for every alternative of the NAT rule.
