</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       resolved.conf, resolved.conf.d - Network Name Resolution configuration files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           <a href="file:/etc/systemd/resolved.conf">/etc/systemd/resolved.conf</a>
           /run/systemd/resolved.conf
           /usr/local/lib/systemd/resolved.conf
           /usr/lib/systemd/resolved.conf
           /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/*.conf
           /run/systemd/resolved.conf.d/*.conf
           /usr/local/lib/systemd/resolved.conf.d/*.conf
           /usr/lib/systemd/resolved.conf.d/*.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These configuration files control local DNS and LLMNR name resolution.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>DIRECTORIES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PRECEDENCE</b></h4><pre>
       The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is necessary
       to deviate from those defaults. The main configuration file is loaded from one of the listed directories
       in order of priority, only the first file found is used: <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>, <a href="file:/run/systemd/">/run/systemd/</a>,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/ [1], <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/.">/usr/lib/systemd/.</a> The vendor version of the file contains commented out
       entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator. Local overrides can also be created by
       creating drop-ins, as described below. The main configuration file can also be edited for this purpose
       (or a copy in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> if it is shipped under <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>), however using drop-ins for local configuration is
       recommended over modifications to the main configuration file.

       In addition to the main configuration file, drop-in configuration snippets are read from
       <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/">/usr/lib/systemd/</a>*.conf.d/, /usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>*.conf.d/. Those drop-ins
       have higher precedence and override the main configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration
       subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the
       subdirectories they reside. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a
       single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of
       values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.

       When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop-ins under <a href="file:/usr/.">/usr/.</a> Files in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>
       are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files
       installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main
       configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those
       subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering. This also defines a concept
       of drop-in priorities to allow OS vendors to ship drop-ins within a specific range lower than the range
       used by users. This should lower the risk of package drop-ins overriding accidentally drop-ins defined by
       users. It is recommended to use the range 10-40 for drop-ins in <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and the range 60-90 for drop-ins in
       <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> and <a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>, to make sure that local and transient drop-ins take priority over drop-ins shipped by
       the OS vendor.

       To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
       /dev/null in the configuration directory in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>, with the same filename as the vendor configuration
       file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are available in the [Resolve] section:

       <u>DNS=</u>
           A space-separated list of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to use as system DNS servers. Each address can
           optionally take a port number separated with ":", a network interface name or index separated with
           "%", and a Server Name Indication (SNI) separated with "#". When IPv6 address is specified with a
           port number, then the address must be in the square brackets. That is, the acceptable full formats
           are "111.222.333.444:9953%ifname#example.com" for IPv4 and
           "[1111:2222::3333]:9953%ifname#example.com" for IPv6. DNS requests are sent to one of the listed DNS
           servers in parallel to suitable per-link DNS servers acquired from <b><a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.service.8.html">systemd-networkd.service</a></b>(8) or set
           at runtime by external applications. For compatibility reasons, if this setting is not specified, the
           DNS servers listed in <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> are used instead, if that file exists and any servers are
           configured in it. This setting defaults to the empty list.

           Added in version 213.

       <u>FallbackDNS=</u>
           A space-separated list of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to use as the fallback DNS servers. Please see <u>DNS=</u>
           for acceptable format of addresses. Any per-link DNS servers obtained from <b><a href="../man8/systemdnetworkd.service.8.html">systemd-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man8/systemdnetworkd.service.8.html">networkd.service</a></b>(8) take precedence over this setting, as do any servers set via <u>DNS=</u> above or
           /etc/resolv.conf. This setting is hence only used if no other DNS server information is known. If
           this option is not given, a compiled-in list of DNS servers is used instead.

           Added in version 216.

       <u>Domains=</u>
           A space-separated list of domains, optionally prefixed with "~", used for two distinct purposes
           described below. Defaults to the empty list.

           Any domains <u>not</u> prefixed with "~" are used as search suffixes when resolving single-label hostnames
           (domain names which contain no dot), in order to qualify them into fully-qualified domain names
           (FQDNs). These "search domains" are strictly processed in the order they are specified in, until the
           name with the suffix appended is found. For compatibility reasons, if this setting is not specified,
           the search domains listed in <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> with the <u>search</u> keyword are used instead, if that file
           exists and any domains are configured in it.

           The domains prefixed with "~" are called "route-only domains". All domains listed here (<u>both</u> <u>search</u>
           <u>domains</u> <u>and</u> <u>route-only</u> <u>domains</u> after removing the "~" prefix) define a search path that preferably
           directs DNS queries to this interface. This search path has an effect only when suitable per-link DNS
           servers are known. Such servers may be defined through the <u>DNS=</u> setting (see above) and dynamically
           at run time, for example from DHCP leases. If no per-link DNS servers are known, route-only domains
           have no effect.

           Use the construct "~."  (which is composed from "~" to indicate a route-only domain and "."  to
           indicate the DNS root domain that is the implied suffix of all DNS domains) to use the DNS servers
           defined for this link preferably for all domains.

           See "Protocols and Routing" in <b><a href="../man8/systemd-resolved.service.8.html">systemd-resolved.service</a></b>(8) for details of how search and route-only
           domains are used.

           Note that configuring the MulticastDNS domain "local" as search or routing domain has the effect of
           routing lookups for this domain to classic unicast DNS. This may be used to provide compatibility
           with legacy installations that use this domain in a unicast DNS context, against the IANA assignment
           of this domain to pure MulticastDNS purposes. Search and routing domains are a unicast DNS concept,
           they <u>cannot</u> be used to resolve single-label lookups via MulticastDNS.

           Added in version 229.

       <u>LLMNR=</u>
           Takes a boolean argument or "resolve". Controls Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution support (<b>RFC</b>
           <b>4795</b>[2]) on the local host. If true, enables full LLMNR responder and resolver support. If false,
           disables both. If set to "resolve", only resolution support is enabled, but responding is disabled.
           Note that <b><a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.service.8.html">systemd-networkd.service</a></b>(8) also maintains per-link LLMNR settings. LLMNR will be enabled
           on a link only if the per-link and the global setting is on.

           Added in version 216.

       <u>MulticastDNS=</u>
           Takes a boolean argument or "resolve". Controls Multicast DNS support (<b>RFC</b> <b>6762</b>[3]) on the local
           host. If true, enables full Multicast DNS responder and resolver support. If false, disables both. If
           set to "resolve", only resolution support is enabled, but responding is disabled. Note that <b><a href="../man8/systemdnetworkd.service.8.html">systemd-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man8/systemdnetworkd.service.8.html">networkd.service</a></b>(8) also maintains per-link Multicast DNS settings. Multicast DNS will be enabled on
           a link only if the per-link and the global setting is on.

           Added in version 234.

       <u>DNSSEC=</u>
           Takes a boolean argument or "allow-downgrade".

           If set to true, all DNS lookups are DNSSEC-validated locally (excluding LLMNR and Multicast DNS). If
           the response to a lookup request is detected to be invalid a lookup failure is returned to
           applications. Note that this mode requires a DNS server that supports DNSSEC. If the DNS server does
           not properly support DNSSEC all validations will fail.

           If set to "allow-downgrade", DNSSEC validation is attempted, but if the server does not support
           DNSSEC properly, DNSSEC mode is automatically disabled. Note that this mode makes DNSSEC validation
           vulnerable to "downgrade" attacks, where an attacker might be able to trigger a downgrade to
           non-DNSSEC mode by synthesizing a DNS response that suggests DNSSEC was not supported.

           If set to false, DNS lookups are not DNSSEC validated.

           Note that DNSSEC validation requires retrieval of additional DNS data, and thus results in a small
           DNS lookup time penalty.

           DNSSEC requires knowledge of "trust anchors" to prove data integrity. The trust anchor for the
           Internet root domain is built into the resolver, additional trust anchors may be defined with <b><a href="../man5/dnssectrust-anchors.d.5.html">dnssec-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man5/dnssectrust-anchors.d.5.html">trust-anchors.d</a></b>(5). Trust anchors may change at regular intervals, and old trust anchors may be
           revoked. In such a case DNSSEC validation is not possible until new trust anchors are configured
           locally or the resolver software package is updated with the new root trust anchor. In effect, when
           the built-in trust anchor is revoked and <u>DNSSEC=</u> is true, all further lookups will fail, as it cannot
           be proved anymore whether lookups are correctly signed, or validly unsigned. If <u>DNSSEC=</u> is set to
           "allow-downgrade" the resolver will automatically turn off DNSSEC validation in such a case.

           Client programs looking up DNS data will be informed whether lookups could be verified using DNSSEC,
           or whether the returned data could not be verified (either because the data was found unsigned in the
           DNS, or the DNS server did not support DNSSEC or no appropriate trust anchors were known). In the
           latter case, it is assumed that client programs employ a secondary scheme to validate the returned
           DNS data, should this be required.

           It is recommended to set <u>DNSSEC=</u> to true on systems where it is known that the DNS server supports
           DNSSEC correctly, and where software or trust anchor updates happen regularly. On other systems it is
           recommended to set <u>DNSSEC=</u> to "allow-downgrade".

           In addition to this global DNSSEC setting <b><a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.service.8.html">systemd-networkd.service</a></b>(8) also maintains per-link DNSSEC
           settings. For system DNS servers (see above), only the global DNSSEC setting is in effect. For
           per-link DNS servers the per-link setting is in effect, unless it is unset in which case the global
           setting is used instead.

           Site-private DNS zones generally conflict with DNSSEC operation, unless a negative (if the private
           zone is not signed) or positive (if the private zone is signed) trust anchor is configured for them.
           If "allow-downgrade" mode is selected, it is attempted to detect site-private DNS zones using
           top-level domains (TLDs) that are not known by the DNS root server. This logic does not work in all
           private zone setups.

           Defaults to "no".

           Added in version 229.

       <u>DNSOverTLS=</u>
           Takes a boolean argument or "opportunistic". If true all connections to the server will be encrypted.
           Note that this mode requires a DNS server that supports DNS-over-TLS and has a valid certificate. If
           the hostname was specified in <u>DNS=</u> by using the format "address#server_name" it is used to validate
           its certificate and also to enable Server Name Indication (SNI) when opening a TLS connection.
           Otherwise the certificate is checked against the server's IP. If the DNS server does not support
           DNS-over-TLS all DNS requests will fail.

           When set to "opportunistic" DNS request are attempted to send encrypted with DNS-over-TLS. If the DNS
           server does not support TLS, DNS-over-TLS is disabled. Note that this mode makes DNS-over-TLS
           vulnerable to "downgrade" attacks, where an attacker might be able to trigger a downgrade to
           non-encrypted mode by synthesizing a response that suggests DNS-over-TLS was not supported. If set to
           false, DNS lookups are send over UDP.

           Note that DNS-over-TLS requires additional data to be send for setting up an encrypted connection,
           and thus results in a small DNS look-up time penalty.

           Note that in "opportunistic" mode the resolver is not capable of authenticating the server, so it is
           vulnerable to "man-in-the-middle" attacks.

           In addition to this global <u>DNSOverTLS=</u> setting <b><a href="../man8/systemd-networkd.service.8.html">systemd-networkd.service</a></b>(8) also maintains per-link
           <u>DNSOverTLS=</u> settings. For system DNS servers (see above), only the global <u>DNSOverTLS=</u> setting is in
           effect. For per-link DNS servers the per-link setting is in effect, unless it is unset in which case
           the global setting is used instead.

           Defaults to "no".

           Added in version 239.

       <u>Cache=</u>
           Takes a boolean or "no-negative" as argument. If "yes" (the default), resolving a domain name which
           already got queried earlier will return the previous result as long as it is still valid, and thus
           does not result in a new network request. Be aware that turning off caching comes at a performance
           penalty, which is particularly high when DNSSEC is used. If "no-negative", only positive answers are
           cached.

           Note that caching is turned off by default for host-local DNS servers. See <u>CacheFromLocalhost=</u> for
           details.

           Added in version 231.

       <u>CacheFromLocalhost=</u>
           Takes a boolean as argument. If "no" (the default), and response cames from host-local IP address
           (such as 127.0.0.1 or ::1), the result would not be cached in order to avoid potential duplicate
           local caching.

           Added in version 248.

       <u>DNSStubListener=</u>
           Takes a boolean argument or one of "udp" and "tcp". If "udp", a DNS stub resolver will listen for UDP
           requests on addresses 127.0.0.53 and 127.0.0.54, port 53. If "tcp", the stub will listen for TCP
           requests on the same addresses and port. If "yes" (the default), the stub listens for both UDP and
           TCP requests. If "no", the stub listener is disabled.

           The DNS stub resolver on 127.0.0.53 provides the full feature set of the local resolver, which
           includes offering LLMNR/MulticastDNS resolution. The DNS stub resolver on 127.0.0.54 provides a more
           limited resolver, that operates in "proxy" mode only, i.e. it will pass most DNS messages relatively
           unmodified to the current upstream DNS servers and back, but not try to process the messages locally,
           and hence does not validate DNSSEC, or offer up LLMNR/MulticastDNS. (It will translate to
           DNS-over-TLS communication if needed however.)

           Note that the DNS stub listener is turned off implicitly when its listening address and port are
           already in use.

           Added in version 232.

       <u>DNSStubListenerExtra=</u>
           Takes an IPv4 or IPv6 address to listen on. The address may be optionally prefixed with a protocol
           name ("udp" or "tcp") separated with ":". If the protocol is not specified, the service will listen
           on both UDP and TCP. It may be also optionally suffixed by a numeric port number with separator ":".
           When an IPv6 address is specified with a port number, then the address must be in the square
           brackets. If the port is not specified, then the service uses port 53. Note that this is independent
           of the primary DNS stub configured with <u>DNSStubListener=</u>, and only configures <u>additional</u> sockets to
           listen on. This option can be specified multiple times. If an empty string is assigned, then the all
           previous assignments are cleared. Defaults to unset.

           Examples:

               DNSStubListenerExtra=192.168.10.10
               DNSStubListenerExtra=2001:db8:0:f102::10
               DNSStubListenerExtra=192.168.10.11:9953
               DNSStubListenerExtra=[2001:db8:0:f102::11]:9953
               DNSStubListenerExtra=tcp:192.168.10.12
               DNSStubListenerExtra=udp:2001:db8:0:f102::12
               DNSStubListenerExtra=tcp:192.168.10.13:9953
               DNSStubListenerExtra=udp:[2001:db8:0:f102::13]:9953

           Added in version 247.

       <u>ReadEtcHosts=</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. If "yes" (the default), <b>systemd-resolved</b> will read <a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>, and try to
           resolve hosts or address by using the entries in the file before sending query to DNS servers.

           Added in version 240.

       <u>ResolveUnicastSingleLabel=</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. When false (the default), <b>systemd-resolved</b> will not resolve A and AAAA
           queries for single-label names over classic DNS. Note that such names may still be resolved if search
           domains are specified (see <u>Domains=</u> above), or using other mechanisms, in particular via LLMNR or
           from /etc/hosts. When true, queries for single-label names will be forwarded to global DNS servers
           even if no search domains are defined.

           This option is provided for compatibility with configurations where <u>public</u> <u>DNS</u> <u>servers</u> <u>are</u> <u>not</u> <u>used</u>.
           Forwarding single-label names to servers not under your control is not standard-conformant, see <b>IAB</b>
           <b>Statement</b>[4], and may create a privacy and security risk.

           Added in version 246.

       StaleRetentionSec=<u>SECONDS</u>
           Takes a duration value, which determines the length of time DNS resource records can be retained in
           the cache beyond their Time To Live (TTL). This allows these records to be returned as stale records.
           By default, this value is set to zero, meaning that DNS resource records are not stored in the cache
           after their TTL expires.

           This is useful when a DNS server failure occurs or becomes unreachable. In such cases, <b><a href="../man8/systemdresolved.8.html">systemd-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man8/systemdresolved.8.html">resolved</a></b>(8) continues to use the stale records to answer DNS queries, particularly when no valid
           response can be obtained from the upstream DNS servers. However, this does not apply to NXDOMAIN
           responses, as those are still perfectly valid responses. This feature enhances resilience against DNS
           infrastructure failures and outages.

           <b>systemd-resolved</b> always attempts to reach the upstream DNS servers first, before providing the client
           application with any stale data. If this feature is enabled, cache will not be flushed when changing
           servers.

           Added in version 254.
