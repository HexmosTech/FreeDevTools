</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       oomd.conf, oomd.conf.d - Global <b>systemd-oomd</b> configuration files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           /etc/systemd/oomd.conf
           /run/systemd/oomd.conf
           /usr/local/lib/systemd/oomd.conf
           /usr/lib/systemd/oomd.conf
           /etc/systemd/oomd.conf.d/*.conf
           /run/systemd/oomd.conf.d/*.conf
           /usr/local/lib/systemd/oomd.conf.d/*.conf
           /usr/lib/systemd/oomd.conf.d/*.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These files configure the various parameters of the <b><a href="../man1/systemd.1.html">systemd</a></b>(1) userspace out-of-memory (OOM) killer,
       <b><a href="../man8/systemd-oomd.service.8.html">systemd-oomd.service</a></b>(8). See <b><a href="../man7/systemd.syntax.7.html">systemd.syntax</a></b>(7) for a general description of the syntax.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>DIRECTORIES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PRECEDENCE</b></h4><pre>
       The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is necessary
       to deviate from those defaults. The main configuration file is loaded from one of the listed directories
       in order of priority, only the first file found is used: <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>, <a href="file:/run/systemd/">/run/systemd/</a>,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/ [1], <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/.">/usr/lib/systemd/.</a> The vendor version of the file contains commented out
       entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator. Local overrides can also be created by
       creating drop-ins, as described below. The main configuration file can also be edited for this purpose
       (or a copy in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> if it is shipped under <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>), however using drop-ins for local configuration is
       recommended over modifications to the main configuration file.

       In addition to the main configuration file, drop-in configuration snippets are read from
       <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/">/usr/lib/systemd/</a>*.conf.d/, /usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>*.conf.d/. Those drop-ins
       have higher precedence and override the main configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration
       subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the
       subdirectories they reside. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a
       single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of
       values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.

       When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop-ins under <a href="file:/usr/.">/usr/.</a> Files in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>
       are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files
       installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main
       configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those
       subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering. This also defines a concept
       of drop-in priorities to allow OS vendors to ship drop-ins within a specific range lower than the range
       used by users. This should lower the risk of package drop-ins overriding accidentally drop-ins defined by
       users. It is recommended to use the range 10-40 for drop-ins in <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and the range 60-90 for drop-ins in
       <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> and <a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>, to make sure that local and transient drop-ins take priority over drop-ins shipped by
       the OS vendor.

       To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
       /dev/null in the configuration directory in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>, with the same filename as the vendor configuration
       file.

</pre><h4><b>[OOM]</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following options are available in the [OOM] section:

       <u>SwapUsedLimit=</u>
           Sets the limit for memory and swap usage on the system before <b>systemd-oomd</b> will take action. If the
           fraction of memory used and the fraction of swap used on the system are both more than what is
           defined here, <b>systemd-oomd</b> will act on eligible descendant control groups with swap usage greater
           than 5% of total swap, starting from the ones with the highest swap usage. Which control groups are
           monitored and what action gets taken depends on what the unit has configured for <u>ManagedOOMSwap=</u>.
           Takes a value specified in percent (when suffixed with "%"), permille ("â€°") or permyriad ("â€±"),
           between 0% and 100%, inclusive. Defaults to 90%.

           Added in version 247.

       <u>DefaultMemoryPressureLimit=</u>
           Sets the limit for memory pressure on the unit's control group before <b>systemd-oomd</b> will take action.
           A unit can override this value with <u>ManagedOOMMemoryPressureLimit=</u>. The memory pressure for this
           property represents the fraction of time in a 10 second window in which all tasks in the control
           group were delayed. For each monitored control group, if the memory pressure on that control group
           exceeds the limit set for longer than the duration set by <u>DefaultMemoryPressureDurationSec=</u>,
           <b>systemd-oomd</b> will act on eligible descendant control groups, starting from the ones with the most
           reclaim activity to the least reclaim activity. Which control groups are monitored and what action
           gets taken depends on what the unit has configured for <u>ManagedOOMMemoryPressure=</u>. Takes a fraction
           specified in the same way as <u>SwapUsedLimit=</u> above. Defaults to 60%.

           Added in version 247.

       <u>DefaultMemoryPressureDurationSec=</u>
           Sets the amount of time a unit's control group needs to have exceeded memory pressure limits before
           <b>systemd-oomd</b> will take action. A unit can override this value with
           <u>ManagedOOMMemoryPressureDurationSec=</u>. Memory pressure limits are defined by
           <u>DefaultMemoryPressureLimit=</u> and <u>ManagedOOMMemoryPressureLimit=</u>. Must be set to 0, or at least 1
           second. Defaults to 30 seconds when unset or 0.

           Added in version 248.

        1. ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥ðŸ§¨ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’£  Please  note  that  those  configuration  files  must  be  available  at  all times. If
           <a href="file:/usr/local/">/usr/local/</a> is a separate partition, it may not be available during early boot, and must not be  used
           for configuration.
