       ax25rtd.conf - ax25 routing daemon configuration file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/ax25/ax25rtd.conf</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  file  /etc/ax25/ax25rtd.conf  is  the configuration file for ax25rtd.  The parameters of the options
       shown here are the default values except the ones marked with (example)

       ax25-maxroutes 4096

       ip-maxroutes   4096
              The maximum size of the three lists / caches. On overflow,  ax25rtd  will  substitute  the  oldest
              entry with the new one.

       iproute2-table radio

              name  ("radio")  of  the  kernel routing table. This is an advanced routing feature. If you do not
              need it, just leave this setting as is.

              The current implementation  depends on iproute2 (anyone like to code it directly?).

              If not  set  or  empty,  routes  are  set  in  the  normal,  default,  manner.   Please  configure
              <a href="file:/etc/iproute2/rt_protos">/etc/iproute2/rt_protos</a> with

                44      ax25rtd

              and <a href="file:/etc/iproute2/rt_tables">/etc/iproute2/rt_tables</a> with

                210     radio

              where "radio" is the name of the table, (for the configuration example above).

              This option is disabled by default.

       ip-encaps-dev ipax0
              This  option  was for a patched kernel of the 2.2.x series. Multiple interfaces were aggregated to
              one interface when sending IP frames. This option is disabled by default.

       [1k2]
              This marks the beginning of per-port definitions. Note that you have to use port names as  defined
              in <a href="../man5/axports.5.html">axports</a>(5) here, anywhere else you may use the port or the device name.

       ax25-learn-routes no
              Set  this  to "yes", ax25rtd will add the routing information for every heard frame (with complete
              digipeater path) to the kernel AX.25 routing table. Note that ax25rtd's  internal  cache  will  be
              updated anyway, regardless of this option.

       ax25-learn-only-mine no
              If  you  set  it to "yes", only frames that are sent to (1) the interface callsign, (2) any of the
              listeners on this device, or (3) the callsigns specified by  ax25-more-mycalls  will  be  used  to
              update the internal cache and (depending on ax25-learn-routes) the kernel routing table.

       ax25-add-path db0ach     (example)
              This is useful on DAMA digipeaters. In this case, the DAMA master has to be used for _every_ AX.25
              connection,  thus  ax25rtd  will  add  this  digipeater(s)  to  every  target we learn that has no
              digipeater path (yet). "db0ach" is just an example here.

       ax25-more-mycalls dl1bke dl1bke-8  (example)
              You can specify more calls as calls here that belong to this interface... "dl1bke" and  "dl1bke-8"
              are examples.

       ip-learn-routes no
              If  set to "yes", ax25rtd will modify the IP routing table if it receives an IP frame (directed to
              us). This is dangerous!

              It should not screw up your routing table, though. Ax25rtd recognizes the netmask  of  the  device
              and  will  adjust  the  route  only  if it fits the netmask and the old route points to one of the
              devices ax25rtd knows about (hence an AX.25 device).

              The problems begin if you have more than one port and a user is able to hear your outgoing traffic
              on at least two of them.  Due to technical reasons ax25rtd adjusts the route  _after_  the  kernel
              has sent the reply to the received TCP frame already.  This has technical reasons.

              If the remote does the same both are switching between the two ports.

              Don't use this feature unless you know what you are doing.

              It  _should_  be  safe do enable this on one-port machines, although I strongly recommend to set a
              network route instead, i.e.:

                   route add -net 44.0.0.0 scc3

              Note that ax25rtd's internal cache will be updated anyway, regardless of this option.

       irtt &lt;irtt&gt;
              If ip-learn-routes is enabled this will assign newly added  routes  an  initial  round  trip  time
              (IRTT) for TCP. &lt;irtt&gt; is measured in msec, hence

                   irtt 10000

              sets the irtt to 10 seconds. A value of 0 disables this feature (default).

       ip-adjust-mode no
              If  you  set  this  option to "yes" ax25rtd will change the IP encapsulation mode according to the
              last received IP frame.

              The problem with this option is that the kernel AX.25 sends a received IP frame to  the  IP  layer
              regardless  if  it  was  sent in UI frame encapsulation "mode datagram (dg)" or in I frame encaps,
              hence in an AX.25 connection, "mode virtual connect (vc)". The Linux kernel will respond  to  this
              frame before ax25rtd can adjust the mode. If the remote does the same... You get the picture.

              Don't use this feature unless you know what you are doing.

       arp-add   no
              This  option, if set to "yes", changes the ARP table to the source callsign of the received frame.
              It should be harmless, just has the the effect that if it is a new entry, the Linux ARP code  will
              send one ARP request before ax25rtd has adjust the ARP table. If there was already an existing ARP
              entry  for this IP route, one IP datagram will be sent to the old address. Not really a problem, I
              hope.
