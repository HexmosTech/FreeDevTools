</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       logind.conf, logind.conf.d - Login manager configuration files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           <a href="file:/etc/systemd/logind.conf">/etc/systemd/logind.conf</a>
           /run/systemd/logind.conf
           /usr/local/lib/systemd/logind.conf
           /usr/lib/systemd/logind.conf
           /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/*.conf
           /run/systemd/logind.conf.d/*.conf
           /usr/local/lib/systemd/logind.conf.d/*.conf
           <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/logind.conf.d/">/usr/lib/systemd/logind.conf.d/</a>*.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       These files configure various parameters of the systemd login manager, <b><a href="../man8/systemd-logind.service.8.html">systemd-logind.service</a></b>(8). See
       <b><a href="../man7/systemd.syntax.7.html">systemd.syntax</a></b>(7) for a general description of the syntax.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>DIRECTORIES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PRECEDENCE</b></h4><pre>
       The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is necessary
       to deviate from those defaults. The main configuration file is loaded from one of the listed directories
       in order of priority, only the first file found is used: <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>, <a href="file:/run/systemd/">/run/systemd/</a>,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/ [1], <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/.">/usr/lib/systemd/.</a> The vendor version of the file contains commented out
       entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator. Local overrides can also be created by
       creating drop-ins, as described below. The main configuration file can also be edited for this purpose
       (or a copy in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> if it is shipped under <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>), however using drop-ins for local configuration is
       recommended over modifications to the main configuration file.

       In addition to the main configuration file, drop-in configuration snippets are read from
       <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/">/usr/lib/systemd/</a>*.conf.d/, /usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>*.conf.d/. Those drop-ins
       have higher precedence and override the main configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration
       subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the
       subdirectories they reside. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a
       single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of
       values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.

       When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop-ins under <a href="file:/usr/.">/usr/.</a> Files in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>
       are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files
       installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main
       configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those
       subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering. This also defines a concept
       of drop-in priorities to allow OS vendors to ship drop-ins within a specific range lower than the range
       used by users. This should lower the risk of package drop-ins overriding accidentally drop-ins defined by
       users. It is recommended to use the range 10-40 for drop-ins in <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and the range 60-90 for drop-ins in
       <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> and <a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>, to make sure that local and transient drop-ins take priority over drop-ins shipped by
       the OS vendor.

       To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
       /dev/null in the configuration directory in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>, with the same filename as the vendor configuration
       file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All options are configured in the [Login] section:

       <u>NAutoVTs=</u>
           Takes a positive integer. Configures how many virtual terminals (VTs) to allocate by default that,
           when switched to and are previously unused, "autovt" services are automatically spawned on. These
           services are instantiated from the template unit autovt@.service for the respective VT TTY name, for
           example, <a href="mailto:autovt@tty4.service">autovt@tty4.service</a>. By default, autovt@.service is linked to getty@.service. In other
           words, login prompts are started dynamically as the user switches to unused virtual terminals. Hence,
           this parameter controls how many login "gettys" are available on the VTs. If a VT is already used by
           some other subsystem (for example, a graphical login), this kind of activation will not be attempted.
           Note that the VT configured in <u>ReserveVT=</u> is always subject to this kind of activation, even if it is
           not one of the VTs configured with the <u>NAutoVTs=</u> directive. Defaults to 6. When set to 0, automatic
           spawning of "autovt" services is disabled.

       <u>ReserveVT=</u>
           Takes a positive integer. Identifies one virtual terminal that shall unconditionally be reserved for
           autovt@.service activation (see above). The VT selected with this option will be marked busy
           unconditionally, so that no other subsystem will allocate it. This functionality is useful to ensure
           that, regardless of how many VTs are allocated by other subsystems, one login "getty" is always
           available. Defaults to 6 (in other words, there will always be a "getty" available on Alt-F6.). When
           set to 0, VT reservation is disabled.

           Added in version 190.

       <u>KillUserProcesses=</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. Configures whether the processes of a user should be killed when the user
           logs out. If true, the scope unit corresponding to the session and all processes inside that scope
           will be terminated. If false, the scope is "abandoned", see <b><a href="../man5/systemd.scope.5.html">systemd.scope</a></b>(5), and processes are not
           killed. Defaults to "no", but see the options <u>KillOnlyUsers=</u> and <u>KillExcludeUsers=</u> below.

           In addition to session processes, user process may run under the user manager unit user@.service.
           Depending on the linger settings, this may allow users to run processes independent of their login
           sessions. See the description of <b>enable-linger</b> in <b><a href="../man1/loginctl.1.html">loginctl</a></b>(1).

           Note that setting <u>KillUserProcesses=yes</u> will break tools like <b><a href="../man1/screen.1.html">screen</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/tmux.1.html">tmux</a></b>(1), unless they are
           moved out of the session scope. See example in <b><a href="../man1/systemd-run.1.html">systemd-run</a></b>(1).

       <u>KillOnlyUsers=</u>, <u>KillExcludeUsers=</u>
           These settings take space-separated lists of usernames that override the <u>KillUserProcesses=</u> setting.
           A user name may be added to <u>KillExcludeUsers=</u> to exclude the processes in the session scopes of that
           user from being killed even if <u>KillUserProcesses=yes</u> is set. If <u>KillExcludeUsers=</u> is not set, the
           "root" user is excluded by default.  <u>KillExcludeUsers=</u> may be set to an empty value to override this
           default. If a user is not excluded, <u>KillOnlyUsers=</u> is checked next. If this setting is specified,
           only the processes in the session scopes of those users will be killed. Otherwise, users are subject
           to the <u>KillUserProcesses=yes</u> setting.

       <u>IdleAction=</u>
           Configures the action to take when the system is idle. Takes one of "ignore", "poweroff", "reboot",
           "halt", "kexec", "suspend", "hibernate", "hybrid-sleep", "suspend-then-hibernate", "sleep", and
           "lock". Defaults to "ignore".

           Note that this requires that user sessions correctly report the idle status to the system. The system
           will execute the action after all sessions report that they are idle, no idle inhibitor lock is
           active, and subsequently, the time configured with <u>IdleActionSec=</u> (see below) has expired.

           Added in version 198.

       <u>IdleActionSec=</u>
           Configures the delay after which the action configured in <u>IdleAction=</u> (see above) is taken after the
           system is idle.

           Added in version 198.

       <u>InhibitDelayMaxSec=</u>
           Specifies the maximum time a system shutdown or sleep request is delayed due to an inhibitor lock of
           type "delay" being active before the inhibitor is ignored and the operation executes anyway. Defaults
           to 5.

       <u>UserStopDelaySec=</u>
           Specifies how long to keep the user record and per-user service user@.service around for a user after
           they logged out fully. If set to zero, the per-user service is terminated immediately when the last
           session of the user has ended. If this option is configured to non-zero rapid logout/login cycles are
           sped up, as the user's service manager is not constantly restarted. If set to "infinity" the per-user
           service for a user is never terminated again after first login, and continues to run until system
           shutdown. Defaults to 10s.

           Added in version 240.

       <u>SleepOperation=</u>
           Takes a list of sleep operations. Possible values are "suspend", "hibernate", "hybrid-sleep", and
           "suspend-then-hibernate". Controls the candidate sleep operations for the "sleep" action. When
           "sleep" action is performed, the specified sleep operations are checked in a fixed order
           ("suspend-then-hibernate" → "hybrid-sleep" → "suspend" → "hibernate"), and the first one supported by
           the machine is used to put the system into sleep. Defaults to "suspend-then-hibernate suspend
           hibernate".

           Added in version 256.

       <u>HandlePowerKey=</u>, <u>HandlePowerKeyLongPress=</u>, <u>HandleRebootKey=</u>, <u>HandleRebootKeyLongPress=</u>,
       <u>HandleSuspendKey=</u>, <u>HandleSuspendKeyLongPress=</u>, <u>HandleHibernateKey=</u>, <u>HandleHibernateKeyLongPress=</u>,
       <u>HandleLidSwitch=</u>, <u>HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=</u>, <u>HandleLidSwitchDocked=</u>, <u>HandleSecureAttentionKey=</u>
           Controls how logind shall handle the system power, reboot and sleep keys and the lid switch to
           trigger actions such as system power-off, reboot or suspend. Can be one of "ignore", "poweroff",
           "reboot", "halt", "kexec", "suspend", "hibernate", "hybrid-sleep", "suspend-then-hibernate", "sleep",
           "lock", and "factory-reset", "secure-attention-key". If "ignore", <b>systemd-logind</b> will never handle
           these keys. If "lock", all running sessions will be screen-locked; otherwise, the specified action
           will be taken in the respective event. Only input devices with the "power-switch" udev tag will be
           watched for key/lid switch events.

           <u>HandlePowerKey=</u> defaults to "poweroff", <u>HandleRebootKey=</u> defaults to "reboot", <u>HandleSuspendKey=</u>
           defaults to "suspend", <u>HandleHibernateKey=</u> defaults to "hibernate", <u>HandlePowerKeyLongPress=</u> defaults
           to "ignore", <u>HandleRebootKeyLongPress=</u> defaults to "poweroff", <u>HandleSuspendKeyLongPress=</u> defaults to
           "hibernate", <u>HandleHibernateKeyLongPress=</u> defaults to "ignore".  <u>HandleLidSwitch=</u> defaults to
           "suspend".  <u>HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=</u> is completely ignored by default (for backwards
           compatibility) — an explicit value must be set before it will be used to determine behaviour.
           <u>HandleLidSwitchDocked=</u> defaults to "ignore". If the system is inserted in a docking station, or if
           more than one display is connected, the action specified by <u>HandleLidSwitchDocked=</u> occurs; if the
           system is on external power the action (if any) specified by <u>HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=</u> occurs;
           otherwise the <u>HandleLidSwitch=</u> action occurs.  <u>HandleSecureAttentionKey=</u> defaults to
           "secure-attention-key"

           A different application may disable logind's handling of system power and sleep keys and the lid
           switch by taking a low-level inhibitor lock ("handle-power-key", "handle-suspend-key",
           "handle-hibernate-key", "handle-lid-switch", "handle-reboot-key"). This is most commonly used by
           graphical desktop environments to take over suspend and hibernation handling, and to use their own
           configuration mechanisms. If a low-level inhibitor lock is taken, logind will not take any action
           when that key or switch is triggered and the <u>Handle*=</u> settings are irrelevant, except for
           <u>HandleSecureAttentionKey=</u>, which is always handled since its addition in v257.

           Added in version 184.

       <u>PowerKeyIgnoreInhibited=</u>, <u>SuspendKeyIgnoreInhibited=</u>, <u>HibernateKeyIgnoreInhibited=</u>,
       <u>LidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=</u>, <u>RebootKeyIgnoreInhibited=</u>
           Controls whether actions that <b>systemd-logind</b> takes when the power, reboot and sleep keys and the lid
           switch are triggered are subject to high-level inhibitor locks ("shutdown", "reboot", "sleep",
           "idle"). Low level inhibitor locks ("handle-power-key", "handle-suspend-key", "handle-hibernate-key",
           "handle-lid-switch", "handle-reboot-key"), are always honored, irrespective of this setting.

           These settings take boolean arguments. If "no", the inhibitor locks taken by applications are
           respected. If "yes", "shutdown", "reboot" "sleep", and "idle" inhibitor locks are ignored.
           <u>PowerKeyIgnoreInhibited=</u>, <u>SuspendKeyIgnoreInhibited=</u>, <u>HibernateKeyIgnoreInhibited=</u> and
           <u>RebootKeyIgnoreInhibited=</u> default to "no".  <u>LidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=</u> defaults to "yes". This means
           that when <b>systemd-logind</b> is handling events by itself (no low level inhibitor locks are taken by
           another application), the lid switch does not respect suspend blockers by default, but the power and
           sleep keys do.

           Added in version 190.

       <u>HoldoffTimeoutSec=</u>
           Specifies a period of time after system startup or system resume in which systemd will hold off on
           reacting to lid events. This is required for the system to properly detect any hotplugged devices so
           systemd can ignore lid events if external monitors, or docks, are connected. If set to 0, systemd
           will always react immediately, possibly before the kernel fully probed all hotplugged devices. This
           is safe, as long as you do not care for systemd to account for devices that have been plugged or
           unplugged while the system was off. Defaults to 30s.

           Added in version 220.

       <u>RuntimeDirectorySize=</u>
           Sets the size limit on the <u>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</u> runtime directory for each user who logs in. Takes a size
           in bytes, optionally suffixed with the usual K, G, M, and T suffixes, to the base 1024 (IEC).
           Alternatively, a numerical percentage suffixed by "%" may be specified, which sets the size limit
           relative to the amount of physical RAM. Defaults to 10%. Note that this size is a safety limit only.
           As each runtime directory is a tmpfs file system, it will only consume as much memory as is needed.

           Added in version 211.

       <u>RuntimeDirectoryInodesMax=</u>
           Sets the limit on number of inodes for the <u>$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR</u> runtime directory for each user who logs
           in. Takes a number, optionally suffixed with the usual K, G, M, and T suffixes, to the base 1024
           (IEC). Defaults to <u>RuntimeDirectorySize=</u> divided by 4096. Note that this size is a safety limit only.
           As each runtime directory is a tmpfs file system, it will only consume as much memory as is needed.

           Added in version 246.

       <u>InhibitorsMax=</u>
           Controls the maximum number of concurrent inhibitors to permit. Defaults to 8192 (8K).

           Added in version 230.

       <u>SessionsMax=</u>
           Controls the maximum number of concurrent user sessions to manage. Defaults to 8192 (8K). Depending
           on how the pam_systemd.so module is included in the PAM stack configuration, further login sessions
           will either be refused, or permitted but not tracked by systemd-logind.

           Added in version 230.

       <u>RemoveIPC=</u>
           Controls whether System V and POSIX IPC objects belonging to the user shall be removed when the user
           fully logs out. Takes a boolean argument. If enabled, the user may not consume IPC resources after
           the last of the user's sessions terminated. This covers System V semaphores, shared memory and
           message queues, as well as POSIX shared memory and message queues. Note that IPC objects of the root
           user and other system users are excluded from the effect of this setting. Defaults to "yes".

           Added in version 212.

       <u>StopIdleSessionSec=</u>
           Specifies a timeout in seconds, or a time span value after which systemd-logind checks the idle state
           of all sessions. Every session that is idle for longer than the timeout will be stopped. Note that
           this option does not apply to "greeter" or "lock-screen" sessions. Defaults to "infinity"
           (systemd-logind is not checking the idle state of sessions). For details about the syntax of time
           spans, see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7).

           Added in version 252.

       <u>DesignatedMaintenanceTime=</u>
           Specifies a default calendar event for scheduled shutdowns. So when using e.g. the command <b>shutdown</b>
           <b>-r</b> to reboot the system without specifying a timeout, logind would use the configured calendar event
           instead. For details about the syntax of calendar events, see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7).

           Added in version 257.
