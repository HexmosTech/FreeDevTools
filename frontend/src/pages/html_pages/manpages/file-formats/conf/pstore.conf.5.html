</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pstore.conf, pstore.conf.d - PStore configuration file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
           <a href="file:/etc/systemd/pstore.conf">/etc/systemd/pstore.conf</a>
           /run/systemd/pstore.conf
           /usr/local/lib/systemd/pstore.conf
           /usr/lib/systemd/pstore.conf
           /etc/systemd/pstore.conf.d/*.conf
           /run/systemd/pstore.conf.d/*.conf
           /usr/local/lib/systemd/pstore.conf.d/*.conf
           /usr/lib/systemd/pstore.conf.d/*.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This file configures the behavior of <b><a href="../man8/systemd-pstore.8.html">systemd-pstore</a></b>(8), a tool for archiving the contents of the
       persistent storage filesystem, <b>pstore</b>[1].

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>DIRECTORIES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PRECEDENCE</b></h4><pre>
       The default configuration is set during compilation, so configuration is only needed when it is necessary
       to deviate from those defaults. The main configuration file is loaded from one of the listed directories
       in order of priority, only the first file found is used: <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>, <a href="file:/run/systemd/">/run/systemd/</a>,
       /usr/local/lib/systemd/ [2], <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/.">/usr/lib/systemd/.</a> The vendor version of the file contains commented out
       entries showing the defaults as a guide to the administrator. Local overrides can also be created by
       creating drop-ins, as described below. The main configuration file can also be edited for this purpose
       (or a copy in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> if it is shipped under <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a>), however using drop-ins for local configuration is
       recommended over modifications to the main configuration file.

       In addition to the main configuration file, drop-in configuration snippets are read from
       <a href="file:/usr/lib/systemd/">/usr/lib/systemd/</a>*.conf.d/, /usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and <a href="file:/etc/systemd/">/etc/systemd/</a>*.conf.d/. Those drop-ins
       have higher precedence and override the main configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration
       subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of in which of the
       subdirectories they reside. When multiple files specify the same option, for options which accept just a
       single value, the entry in the file sorted last takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of
       values, entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.

       When packages need to customize the configuration, they can install drop-ins under <a href="file:/usr/.">/usr/.</a> Files in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>
       are reserved for the local administrator, who may use this logic to override the configuration files
       installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main
       configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended to prefix all filenames in those
       subdirectories with a two-digit number and a dash, to simplify the ordering. This also defines a concept
       of drop-in priorities to allow OS vendors to ship drop-ins within a specific range lower than the range
       used by users. This should lower the risk of package drop-ins overriding accidentally drop-ins defined by
       users. It is recommended to use the range 10-40 for drop-ins in <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> and the range 60-90 for drop-ins in
       <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a> and <a href="file:/run/">/run/</a>, to make sure that local and transient drop-ins take priority over drop-ins shipped by
       the OS vendor.

       To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the recommended way is to place a symlink to
       /dev/null in the configuration directory in <a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a>, with the same filename as the vendor configuration
       file.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       All options are configured in the [PStore] section:

       <u>Storage=</u>
           Controls where to archive (i.e. copy) files from the pstore filesystem. One of "none", "external",
           and "journal". When "none", the tool exits without processing files in the pstore filesystem. When
           "external" (the default), files are archived into <a href="file:/var/lib/systemd/pstore/">/var/lib/systemd/pstore/</a>, and logged into the
           journal. When "journal", pstore file contents are logged only in the journal.

           Added in version 243.

       <u>Unlink=</u>
           Controls whether or not files are removed from pstore after processing. Takes a boolean value. When
           true, a pstore file is removed from the pstore once it has been archived (either to disk or into the
           journal). When false, processing of pstore files occurs normally, but the files remain in the pstore.
           The default is true in order to maintain the pstore in a nearly empty state, so that the pstore has
           storage available for the next kernel error event.

           Added in version 243.

       The defaults for all values are listed as comments in the template <a href="file:/etc/systemd/pstore.conf">/etc/systemd/pstore.conf</a> file that is
       installed by default.

        2. ðŸ’£ðŸ’¥ðŸ§¨ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’£  Please  note  that  those  configuration  files  must  be  available  at  all times. If
           <a href="file:/usr/local/">/usr/local/</a> is a separate partition, it may not be available during early boot, and must not be  used
           for configuration.
