       <b>Service</b>
              org.bluez

       <b>Interface</b>
              org.bluez.Adapter1

       <b>Object</b> <b>path</b>
              [variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}

   <b>Methods</b>
   <b>void</b> <b>StartDiscovery()</b>
          Starts  device  discovery session which may include starting an inquiry and/or scanning procedures and
          remote device name resolving.

          Use <b>StopDiscovery</b> to release the sessions acquired.

          This process will start creating Device objects as new devices are discovered.

          During discovery RSSI delta-threshold is imposed.

          Each client can request a single device discovery session per adapter.

          Possible errors:

          <b>org.bluez.Error.NotReady</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Failed</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.InProgress</b>

   <b>void</b> <b>StopDiscovery()</b>
          Stops device discovery session started by <b>StartDiscovery</b>.

          Note that a discovery procedure is shared between all discovery sessions  thus  calling  StopDiscovery
          will  only  release  a  single session and discovery will stop when all sessions from all clients have
          finished.

          Possible errors:

          <b>org.bluez.Error.NotReady</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Failed</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.NotAuthorized</b>

   <b>void</b> <b>RemoveDevice(object</b> <b>device)</b>
          Removes the remote device object at the  given  path  including  cahed  information  such  as  bonding
          information.

          Possible errors:

          <b>org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Failed</b>

   <b>void</b> <b>SetDiscoveryFilter(dict</b> <b>filter)</b>
          Sets  the device discovery filter for the caller. When this method is called with no filter parameter,
          filter is removed.

          Possible filter values:

          <b>array{string}</b> <b>UUIDs</b>
                 Filter by service UUIDs, empty means match <u>any</u> UUID.

                 When a remote device is found that advertises any UUID from UUIDs, it will be reported if:

                 • <b>Pathloss</b> and <b>RSSI</b> are both empty.

                 • only <b>Pathloss</b> param is set, device advertise TX power, and computed  pathloss  is  less  than
                   Pathloss param.

                 • only <b>RSSI</b> param is set, and received RSSI is higher than RSSI param.

          <b>int16</b> <b>RSSI</b>
                 RSSI threshold value.

                 PropertiesChanged  signals  will  be  emitted for already existing Device objects, with updated
                 RSSI value. If one or more discovery filters have been set, the RSSI delta-threshold,  that  is
                 imposed by StartDiscovery by default, will not be applied.

          <b>uint16</b> <b>Pathloss</b>
                 Pathloss threshold value.

                 PropertiesChanged  signals  will  be  emitted for already existing Device objects, with updated
                 Pathloss value.

          <b>string</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>(Default</b> <b>"auto")</b>
                 Transport parameter determines the type of scan.

                 Possible values:

                 <b>"auto"</b> Interleaved scan, use LE, BREDR, or both, depending on what's currently enabled.

                 <b>"bredr"</b>
                        BR/EDR inquiry only.

                 <b>"le"</b>   LE scan only.

          <b>bool</b> <b>DuplicateData</b> <b>(Default</b> <b>false)</b>
                 Disables duplicate detection of advertisement data.

                 When enabled PropertiesChanged signals  will  be  generated  for  either  ManufacturerData  and
                 ServiceData everytime they are discovered.

          <b>bool</b> <b>Discoverable</b> <b>(Default</b> <b>false)</b>
                 Make  adapter  discoverable  while  discovering, if the adapter is already discoverable setting
                 this filter won't do anything.

          <b>string</b> <b>Pattern</b> <b>(Default</b> <b>none)</b>
                 Discover devices where the pattern matches either the prefix of  the  address  or  device  name
                 which is convenient way to limited the number of device objects created during a discovery.

                 When set disregards device discoverable flags.

                 Note:  The  pattern matching is ignored if there are other client that don't set any pattern as
                 it work as a logical OR, also setting empty string "" pattern will match any device found.

          <b>bool</b> <b>AutoConnect</b> <b>(Default</b> <b>false)</b>
                 Connect to discovered devices automatically if a Pattern has been set and it matches the device
                 address or name and it is connectable.

          When discovery filter is set, Device objects will be created as new devices with matching criteria are
          discovered  regardless  of  they  are  connectable  or  discoverable  which   enables   listening   to
          non-connectable and non-discoverable devices.

          When  multiple clients call SetDiscoveryFilter, their filters are internally merged, and notifications
          about new devices are sent to all clients. Therefore, each  client  must  check  that  device  updates
          actually match its filter.

          When SetDiscoveryFilter is called multiple times by the same client, last filter passed will be active
          for given client.

          SetDiscoveryFilter  can  be  called before StartDiscovery.  It is useful when client will create first
          discovery session, to ensure that proper scan will be started right after call to StartDiscovery.

          Possible errors:

          <b>org.bluez.Error.NotReady</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.NotSupported</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Failed</b>

   <b>array{string}</b> <b>GetDiscoveryFilters()</b>
          Returns available filters that can be given to <b>SetDiscoveryFilter</b>.

          Possible errors: None

   <b>object</b> <b>ConnectDevice(dict</b> <b>properties)</b> <b>[experimental]</b>
          connects to device without need of performing General Discovery.  Connection mechanism is  similar  to
          Connect  method on <b><a href="../man5/org.bluez.Device1.5.html">org.bluez.Device1</a>(5)</b> interface with exception that this method returns success when
          physical connection is established and you can specify bearer to connect with  parameter.  After  this
          method returns, services discovery will continue and any supported profile will be connected. There is
          no  need  for  calling  Connect  on  Device1 after this call. If connection was successful this method
          returns object path to created device object or device that already exist.

          Possible properties values:

          <b>string</b> <b>Address</b> <b>(Mandatory)</b>
                 The Bluetooth device address of the remote device.

          <b>string</b> <b>AddressType</b> <b>(Default</b> <b>"BR/EDR")</b>
                 The Bluetooth device Address Type. This is  address  type  that  should  be  used  for  initial
                 connection.

                 Possible values:

                 <b>"public"</b>
                        Public address

                 <b>"random"</b>
                        Random address

          Possible errors:

          <b>org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.AlreadyExists</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.NotSupported</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.NotReady</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Failed</b>

   <b>Properties</b>
   <b>string</b> <b>Address</b> <b>[readonly]</b>
          The Bluetooth device address.

   <b>string</b> <b>AddressType</b> <b>[readonly]</b>
          The  Bluetooth  Address  Type. For dual-mode and BR/EDR only adapter this defaults to "public". Single
          mode LE adapters may have either value.  With privacy enabled this contains type of  Identity  Address
          and not type of address used for connection.

          Possible values:

          <b>"public"</b>
                 Public address.

          <b>"random</b>
                 Random address.

   <b>string</b> <b>Name</b> <b>[readonly]</b>
          The Bluetooth system name (pretty hostname).

          This  property  is either a static system default or controlled by an external daemon providing access
          to the pretty hostname configuration.

   <b>string</b> <b>Alias</b> <b>[readwrite]</b>
          The Bluetooth friendly name. This value can be changed.

          In case no alias is set, it will return the system provided name.  Setting an empty  string  as  alias
          will convert it back to the system provided name.

          When resetting the alias with an empty string, the property will default back to system name.

          On  a  well configured system, this property never needs to be changed since it defaults to the system
          name and provides the pretty hostname.  Only if the local name needs to be different from  the  pretty
          hostname, this property should be used as last resort.

   <b>uint32</b> <b>Class</b> <b>[readonly]</b>
          The Bluetooth class of device.

          This  property represents the value that is either automatically configured by DMI/ACPI information or
          provided as static configuration.

   <b>boolean</b> <b>Connectable</b> <b>[readwrite]</b>
          Set an adapter to connectable or non-connectable. This is a global setting and should only be used  by
          the settings application.

          Setting  this  property  to  false will set the Discoverable property of the adapter to false as well,
          which will not be reverted if if Connectable is set back to true. If required,  the  application  will
          need to manually set Discoverable to true.

          Note that this property only affects incoming connections.

   <b>boolean</b> <b>Powered</b> <b>[readwrite]</b>
          Switch an adapter on or off. This will also set the appropriate connectable state of the controller.

          The value of this property is not persistent. After restart or unplugging of the adapter it will reset
          back to false.

   <b>string</b> <b>PowerState</b> <b>[readonly,</b> <b>experimental]</b>
          The power state of an adapter.

          The  power  state  will show whether the adapter is turning off, or turning on, as well as being on or
          off.

          Possible values:

          <b>"on"</b>   Powered on.

          <b>"off"</b>  Powered off

          <b>"off-enabling"</b>
                 Transitioning from "off" to "on".

          <b>"on-disabling"</b>
                 Transitioning from "on" to "off".

          <b>"off-blocked"</b>
                 Blocked by rfkill.

   <b>boolean</b> <b>Discoverable</b> <b>[readwrite]</b> <b>(Default:</b> <b>false)</b>
          Switch an adapter to discoverable or non-discoverable to either make it visible or hide it. This is  a
          global setting and should only be used by the settings application.

          If  the  DiscoverableTimeout  is  set  to a non-zero value then the system will set this value back to
          false after the timer expired.

          In case the adapter is switched off, setting this value will fail.

          When  changing  the  Powered  property  the  new  state  of  this  property  will  be  updated  via  a
          PropertiesChanged signal.

   <b>boolean</b> <b>Pairable</b> <b>[readwrite]</b> <b>(Default:</b> <b>true)</b>
          Switch an adapter to pairable or non-pairable. This is a global setting and should only be used by the
          settings application.

          Note that this property only affects incoming pairing requests.

   <b>uint32</b> <b>PairableTimeout</b> <b>[readwrite]</b> <b>(Default:</b> <b>0)</b>
          The  pairable  timeout in seconds. A value of zero means that the timeout is disabled and it will stay
          in pairable mode forever.

   <b>uint32</b> <b>DiscoverableTimeout</b> <b>[readwrite]</b> <b>(Default:</b> <b>180)</b>
          The discoverable timeout in seconds. A value of zero means that the timeout is disabled  and  it  will
          stay in discoverable/limited mode forever.

   <b>boolean</b> <b>Discovering</b> <b>[readonly]</b>
          Indicates that a device discovery procedure is active.

   <b>array{string}</b> <b>UUIDs</b> <b>[readonly]</b>
          List of 128-bit UUIDs that represents the available local services.

   <b>string</b> <b>Modalias</b> <b>[readonly,</b> <b>optional]</b>
