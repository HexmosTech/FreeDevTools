       org.freedesktop.portable1 - The D-Bus interface of systemd-portabled

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man8/systemd-portabled.service.8.html">systemd-portabled.service</a></b>(8) is a system service that may be used to attach, detach and inspect portable
       services. This page describes the D-Bus interface.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>MANAGER</b> <b>OBJECT</b></h4><pre>
       The service exposes the following interfaces on the Manager object on the bus:

   <b>Methods</b>
       <b>GetImage()</b> may be used to get the image object path of the image with the specified name.

       <b>ListImages()</b> returns an array of all currently known images. The structures in the array consist of the
       following fields: image name, type, read-only flag, creation time, modification time, current disk space,
       usage and image object path.

       <b>GetImageOSRelease()</b> retrieves the OS release information of an image. This method returns an array of key
       value pairs read from the <b><a href="../man5/os-release.5.html">os-release</a></b>(5) file in the image and is useful to identify the operating system
       used in a portable service.

       <b>GetImageMetadata()</b> retrieves metadata associated with an image. This method returns the image name, the
       image's <b><a href="../man5/os-release.5.html">os-release</a></b>(5) content in the form of a (streamable) array of bytes, and a list of portable units
       contained in the image, in the form of a string (unit name) and an array of bytes with the content.

       <b>GetImageMetadataWithExtensions()</b> retrieves metadata associated with an image. This method is a superset
       of <b>GetImageMetadata()</b> with the addition of a list of extensions as input parameter, which were overlaid
       on top of the main image via <b>AttachImageWithExtensions()</b>. The path of each extension and an array of
       bytes with the content of the respective extension-release file are returned, one such structure for each
       extension named in the input arguments.

       <b>GetImageState()</b> retrieves the image state as one of the following strings:

       •   detached

       •   attached

       •   attached-runtime

       •   enabled

       •   enabled-runtime

       •   running

       •   running-runtime

       <b>GetImageStateWithExtensions()</b> is a superset of <b>GetImageState()</b>, with additional support for a list of
       extensions as input parameters, which is necessary to query the state in case the image was attached in
       that particular way. The <u>flag</u> parameter is currently unused and reserved for future purposes.

       <b>AttachImage()</b> attaches a portable image to the system. This method takes an image path or name, a list of
       strings that will be used to search for unit files inside the image (partial or complete matches), a
       string indicating which portable profile to use for the image (see <u>Profiles</u> property for a list of
       available profiles), a boolean indicating whether to attach the image only for the current boot session,
       and a string representing the preferred copy mode (whether to copy the image or to just symlink it) with
       the following possible values:

       •   (empty)

       •   copy

       •   symlink

       •   mixed

       If an empty string is passed the security profile drop-ins and images will be symlinked while unit files
       will be copied, <u>copy</u> will copy, <u>symlink</u> will prefer linking if possible (e.g.: a unit has to be copied
       out of an image), and <u>mixed</u> will prefer linking the resources owned by the OS (e.g.: the portable profile
       located within the host's <a href="file:/usr/">/usr/</a> tree) but will copy the resources owned by the portable image (e.g.: the
       unit files and the images). This method returns the list of changes applied to the system (for example,
       which unit was added and is now available as a system service). Each change is represented as a triplet
       of strings: the type of change applied, the path on which it was applied, and the source (if any). The
       type of change applied will be one of the following possible values:

       •   copy

       •   symlink

       •   write

       •   mkdir

       Note that an image cannot be attached if a unit that it contains is already present on the system. Note
       that this method returns only after all the listed operations are completed, and due to the I/O involved
       it might take some time.

       In place of the image path a ".v/" versioned directory may be specified, see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.v.7.html">systemd.v</a></b>(7) for details.

       In place of the directory path a ".v/" versioned directory may be specified, see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.v.7.html">systemd.v</a></b>(7) for
       details.

       <b>AttachImageWithExtensions()</b> attaches a portable image to the system. This method is a superset of
       <b>AttachImage()</b> with the addition of a list of extensions as input parameter, which will be overlaid on top
       of the main image. When this method is used, detaching must be done by passing the same arguments via the
       <b>DetachImageWithExtensions()</b> method. For more details on this functionality, see the <u>MountImages=</u> entry on
       <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5) and <b><a href="../man8/systemd-sysext.8.html">systemd-sysext</a></b>(8).

       <b>DetachImage()</b> detaches a portable image from the system. This method takes an image path or name, and a
       boolean indicating whether the image to detach was attached only for the current boot session or
       persistently. This method returns the list of changes applied to the system (for example, which unit was
       removed and is no longer available as a system service). Each change is represented as a triplet of
       strings: the type of change applied, the path on which it was applied, and the source (if any). The type
       of change applied will be one of the following possible values:

       •   unlink

       Note that an image cannot be detached if a unit that it contains is running. Note that this method
       returns only after all the listed operations are completed, and due to the I/O involved it might take
       some time.

       <b>DetachImageWithExtensions()</b> detaches a portable image from the system. This method is a superset of
       <b>DetachImage()</b> with the addition of a list of extensions as input parameter, which were overlaid on top of
       the main image via <b>AttachImageWithExtensions()</b>.

       <b>ReattachImage()</b> combines the effects of the <b>AttachImage()</b> method and the <b>DetachImage()</b> method. The
       difference is that it is allowed to reattach an image while one or more of its units are running. The
       reattach operation will fail if no matching image is attached. The input parameters match the
       <b>AttachImage()</b> method, and the return parameters are the combination of the return parameters of the
       <b>DetachImage()</b> method (first array, units that were removed) and the <b>AttachImage()</b> method (second array,
       units that were updated or added).

       <b>ReattachImageWithExtensions()</b> reattaches a portable image to the system. This method is a superset of
       <b>ReattachImage()</b> with the addition of a list of extensions as input parameter, which will be overlaid on
       top of the main image. For more details on this functionality, see the <u>MountImages=</u> entry on
       <b><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></b>(5) and <b><a href="../man8/systemd-sysext.8.html">systemd-sysext</a></b>(8).

       <b>RemoveImage()</b> removes the image with the specified name.

       <b>MarkImageReadOnly()</b> toggles the read-only flag of an image.

       <b>SetPoolLimit()</b> sets an overall quota limit on the pool of images.

       <b>SetImageLimit()</b> sets a per-image quota limit.

       The <b>AttachImageWithExtensions()</b>, <b>DetachImageWithExtensions()</b> and <b>ReattachImageWithExtensions()</b> methods
       take in options as flags instead of booleans to allow for extendability.
       <u>SD_SYSTEMD_PORTABLE_FORCE_ATTACH</u> will bypass the safety checks that ensure the units are not running
       while the image is attached or detached.  <u>SD_SYSTEMD_PORTABLE_FORCE_EXTENSION</u> will bypass the check that
       ensures the extension-release.<u>NAME</u> file in the extension image matches the image name. They are defined
       as follows:

           #define SD_SYSTEMD_PORTABLE_RUNTIME            (<a href="../man1/UINT64_C.1.html">UINT64_C</a>(1) &lt;&lt; 0)
           #define SD_SYSTEMD_PORTABLE_FORCE_ATTACH       (<a href="../man1/UINT64_C.1.html">UINT64_C</a>(1) &lt;&lt; 1)
           #define SD_SYSTEMD_PORTABLE_FORCE_EXTENSION    (<a href="../man1/UINT64_C.1.html">UINT64_C</a>(1) &lt;&lt; 2)

   <b>Properties</b>
       <u>PoolPath</u> specifies the file system path where images are written to.

       <u>PoolUsage</u> specifies the current usage size of the image pool in bytes.

       <u>PoolLimit</u> specifies the size limit of the image pool in bytes.

       <u>Profiles</u> specifies the available runtime profiles for portable services.

   <b>Methods</b>
       The following methods implement the same operation as the respective methods on the Manager object (see
       above). However, these methods operate on the image object and hence does not take an image name
       parameter. Invoking the methods directly on the Manager object has the advantage of not requiring a
       <b>GetImage()</b> call to get the image object for a specific image name. Calling the methods on the Manager
       object is hence a round trip optimization. List of methods:

       •   GetOSRelease()

       •   GetMetadata()

       •   GetMetadataWithExtensions()

       •   GetState()

       •   Attach()

       •   AttachWithExtensions()

       •   Detach()

       •   DetachWithExtensions()

       •   Reattach()

       •   ReattachWithExtensions()

       •   Remove()

       •   MarkReadOnly()

       •   SetLimit()

   <b>Properties</b>
       <u>Name</u> specifies the image name.

       <u>Path</u> specifies the file system path where image is stored.

       <u>Type</u> specifies the image type.

       <u>ReadOnly</u> specifies whether the image is read-only.

       <u>CreationTimestamp</u> specifies the image creation timestamp.

       <u>ModificationTimestamp</u> specifies the image modification timestamp.

       <u>Usage</u> specifies the image disk usage.

       <u>Limit</u> specifies the image disk usage limit.

       <u>UsageExclusive</u> specifies the image disk usage (exclusive).

       <u>LimitExclusive</u> specifies the image disk usage limit (exclusive).
