       bootstrap - Grid Engine bootstrap file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>bootstrap</u>  contains  parameters that are needed for the startup of Grid Engine components.  It is created
       during the sge_qmaster installation.  Modifying <u>bootstrap</u> in a running system is not supported.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The paragraphs that follow provide brief descriptions of the  individual  parameters  that  comprise  the
       bootstrap configuration for a Grid Engine cluster:

   <b>admin_user</b>
       Administrative  user account used by Grid Engine for all internal file handling (status spooling, message
       logging, etc.). Can be used in cases where the root account does not have the corresponding  file  access
       permissions (e.g. on a shared file system without global root read/write access).

       As  a  parameter  set  at  installation  time,  changing <b>admin_user</b> in a running system is not supported.
       Changing it manually on a shut-down cluster is possible, but if access to the Grid Engine  spooling  area
       is interrupted, this will result in unpredictable behavior.

       The  <b>admin_user</b>  parameter has no default value, but instead it is defined during the master installation
       procedure.

   <b>default_domain</b>
       Only needed if your Grid Engine cluster covers hosts belonging to more than a single DNS domain. In  this
       case  it  can  be used if your hostname resolving yields both qualified and unqualified hostnames for the
       hosts in one of the DNS domains.  The value of <b>default_domain</b> is appended to the unqualified hostname  to
       define  a  fully  qualified hostname.  The <b>default_domain</b> parameter will have no effect if <b>ignore_fqdn</b> is
       set to "true".

       As a parameter set at installation time, changing <b>default_domain</b> in a running system  is  not  supported.
       The default for <b>default_domain</b> is "none", in which case it will not be used.

   <b>ignore_fqdn</b>
       Ignore fully qualified domain name component of hostnames. Should be set if all hosts belonging to a Grid
       Engine  cluster  are  part  of  a  single  DNS  domain. It is switched on if set to either "true" or "1".
       Switching it on may solve problems with load reports due to different  hostname  resolutions  across  the
       cluster.

       As  a  parameter set at installation time, changing <b>ignore_fqdn</b> in a running system is not supported. The
       default for <b>ignore_fqdn</b> is "true".

   <b>spooling_method</b>
       Defines how <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8) writes its configuration and the status information of a running cluster.

       The available spooling methods are <u>berkeleydb</u> and <u>classic</u>.

   <b>spooling_lib</b>
       The name of a shared library containing the <b>spooling_method</b> to be loaded at <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8) initialization
       time.  The extension characterizing a shared  library  (.so,  .sl,  .dylib  etc.)  is  not  contained  in
       <b>spooling_lib</b>.

       If  <b>spooling_method</b>  was  set to <u>berkeleydb</u> during installation, <b>spooling_lib</b> is set to <u>libspoolb</u>, and if
       <u>classic</u> was chosen as <b>spooling_method</b>, <b>spooling_lib</b> is set to <u>libspoolc</u>.

       Not all operating systems allow the dynamic loading of libraries. On these platforms a  certain  spooling
       method  (default:  berkeleydb)  is  compiled  into  the  binaries  and the parameter <b>spooling_lib</b> will be
       ignored.

   <b>spooling_params</b>
       Defines parameters of the chosen spooling method that are needed to initialize  the  spooling  framework,
       e.g. to open database files.

       The spooling parameters value for spooling method <u>berkeleydb</u> is
         [<u>rpc_server</u><b>:</b>]<u>database</u> <u>directory</u>[<b>;</b>&lt;options&gt;]
       e.g.  "/opt/sge/default/spool/qmaster/spooldb"  for  spooling  to a local filesystem, or "myhost:sge" for
       spooling over a Berkeley DB RPC server.

       <u>rpc_server</u> is obsolete since recent BDB versions don't support RPC and support has been removed from Grid
       Engine; it must be replaced if it occurs in an old configuration before an upgrade.   <u>database</u>  <u>directory</u>
       is  the  directory  containing  the  spool  files,  and  <u>options</u>  is  a list of options for the database.
       Currently the only valid value for <u>options</u> is  <b>private</b>,  which  means  to  open  the  database  with  the
       DB_PRIVATE  flag  to  specify  that  it  is  only accessed by a single process.  This allows the <u>database</u>
       <u>directory</u> to be on an NFSv3 filesystem (as opposed to an NFSv4 one, which is otherwise necessary), but it
       is unsafe to access it with any other  program.   In  particular,  this  means  that  the  backup  script
       (inst_sge  -bup),  similar scripts using the DB utilities, <u>spooledit</u> etc., must not be used while qmaster
       is running with berkeleydb spooling.

       For spooling method <u>classic</u> the spooling parameters take the form &lt;common_dir&gt;;&lt;qmaster spool dir&gt;,  e.g.
       /sge/default/common;/sge/default/spool/qmaster

   <b>binary_path</b>
       The  directory  path  where  the Grid Engine binaries reside. It is used within Grid Engine components to
       locate and startup other Grid Engine programs.

       The path name given here is searched for binaries as well as any directory below with  a  directory  name
       equal  to  the  current  operating  system  architecture.  Therefore,  /usr/SGE/bin  will  work  for  all
       architectures, if the corresponding binaries are located in subdirectories named aix51, lx-amd64, lx-x86,
       hp11, hp11-64, sol-amd64, sol-sparc etc.

       The default location for the binary path is &lt;sge_root&gt;<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>

   <b>qmaster_spool_dir</b>
       The location where the master spool directory resides. Only the <u><a href="../man8/sge_qmaster.8.html">sge_qmaster</a></u>(8) and <u><a href="../man8/sge_shadowd.8.html">sge_shadowd</a></u>(8) need to
       have access to this directory.  The master spool directory - in particular the job_scripts directory  and
       the  messages  log  file - may become quite large, depending on the size of the cluster and the number of
       jobs. Be sure to allocate enough disk space and regularly clean off the log files,  e.g.  via  a  <u><a href="../man8/cron.8.html">cron</a></u>(8)
       job.

       As a parameter set at installation time, changing <b>qmaster_spool_dir</b> in a running system is not supported.

       The default location for the master spool directory is &lt;sge_root&gt;/&lt;cell&gt;/spool/qmaster.

   <b>security_mode</b>
       The  security  mode  defines  the  set  of  security features the installed cluster is using, as a comma-
       separated list.

       Possible security mode settings are "none", "afs",  "dce",  "kerberos",  "csp",  "munge"  (no  additional
       security, AFS, DCE/GSSAPI, Kerberos/GSSAPI, X.509 certificate-based security, and MUNGE authentication
       ⟨<a href="http://munge.googlecode.com/">http://munge.googlecode.com/</a>⟩).  Their availability depends on how Grid Engine was built/installed.

       The  "dce"  and "kerberos" methods are nearly equivalent, calling the GSSAPI security modules in the same
       way, whether they were built for Kerberos/GSSAPI or  DCE/GSSAPI,  except  that  "dce"  runs  the  program
       <u>$SGE_ROOT/utilbin/$ARCH/starter_cred</u>  as  a  wrapper  for the shepherd unless <b>NO_SECURITY</b> is specified in
       <b>execd_params</b> in <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5).

       Only the CSP and MUNGE methods are currently properly functional and safe (from the point of view of  not
       exposing  credentials  generally).   Both  provide user authentication, preventing impersonation of other
       users.  CSP requires certificates to be generated for each user and available on each host which the user
       can access; it is appropriate for a loosely coupled system, e.g. including desktop systems,  particularly
       as it protects the communication stream as well as providing authentication.  MUNGE is appropriate in the
       security  domain  of  a  tightly  coupled  system,  such  as  a normal cluster, and allows operation with
       <b>enforce_user=auto</b> (see <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5);) it requires the <u>munged</u> daemon to be running on  each  host,  with  a
       shared secret and doesn't encrypt the communication.

       <b>NB.</b>   Do  not  use  AFS  security  without some means of user authentication, otherwise it is possible to
       submit jobs as another user and steal their credential from a job running on the same node.

   <b>listener_threads</b>
       The number of listener threads (defaults set by installation).   Increasing  this  and/or  <b>worker_threads</b>
       (below)  to use additional cores/hardware threads on the master host may improve performance in demanding
       cases.

   <b>worker_threads</b>
       The number of qmaster worker threads (defaults set by installation).

   <b>scheduler_threads</b>
       The number of qmaster scheduler threads (allowed: 0-1, default  set  by  installation:  1,  off:  0;  see
       <u><a href="../man1/qconf.1.html">qconf</a></u>(1) -kt/-at option).

   <b>jvm_threads</b>
       The number of JVM threads (allowed: 0-1, default set by installation, off: 0).
