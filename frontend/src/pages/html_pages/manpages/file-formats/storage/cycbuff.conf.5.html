       cycbuff.conf - Configuration file for INN CNFS storage method

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This file defines the cyclical buffers that make up the storage pools for CNFS (Cyclic News File System).
       Some options controlling the behavior of the CNFS storage system can also be set here.  <u>cycbuff.conf</u> is
       required if the CNFS (Cyclic News File System) storage method is used.  INN will look for it in <u>pathetc</u>
       (as set in <u>inn.conf</u>).

       CNFS stores articles in logical objects called <u>metacycbuffs</u>.  Each metacycbuff is in turn composed of one
       or more physical buffers called <u>cycbuffs</u>.  As articles are written to the metacycbuff, each article is
       written to the next cycbuff in the list in a round-robin fashion (unless "sequential" mode is specified,
       in which case each cycbuff is filled before moving on to the next).  This is so that you can distribute
       the individual cycbuffs across multiple physical disks and balance the load between them.  Note that in
       order to use any cycbuff larger than 2 GB on 32-bit platforms (and some very rare 64-bit platforms that
       define a 32-bit <u>off_t</u> type), you need to build INN with the <b>--enable-largefiles</b> option.

       For information about how to configure INN to use CNFS, see <a href="../man5/storage.conf.5.html">storage.conf</a>(5).

       Blank lines and lines beginning with a hash sign ("#") are ignored.  All other lines must be of one of
       the following forms:

           cycbuffupdate:&lt;interval&gt;
           refreshinterval:&lt;interval&gt;
           cycbuff:&lt;name&gt;:&lt;file&gt;:&lt;size&gt;
           metacycbuff:&lt;name&gt;:&lt;buffer&gt;[,&lt;buffer&gt;,...][:&lt;mode&gt;]

       (where items enclosed in [] are optional).  Order is mostly not significant, but all <u>cycbuff</u> lines must
       occur before all <u>metacycbuff</u> lines.  Long lines can be continued on the next line by ending the line with
       a backslash ("\").

       <u>cycbuffupdate</u>:&lt;interval&gt;
           Sets  the number of articles written before the cycbuff header is written back to disk to &lt;interval&gt;.
           Under most operating systems, the header doesn't have to be written to disk for the updated  data  to
           be  available  to  other  processes on the same system that are reading articles out of CNFS, but any
           accesses to the CNFS cycbuffs over NFS will only see the data  present  at  the  last  write  of  the
           header.   After a system crash, all updates since the last write of the CNFS header may be lost.  The
           default value, if this line is omitted, is "25", meaning that the header is  written  to  disk  after
           every 25 articles stored in that cycbuff.

       <u>refreshinterval</u>:&lt;interval&gt;
           Sets  the interval (in seconds) between re-reads of the cycbuff header to &lt;interval&gt;.  This primarily
           affects <b>nnrpd</b> and controls the frequency with which it updates its knowledge of the current  contents
           of the CNFS cycbuffs.  The default value, if this line is omitted, is "30".

       <u>cycbuff</u>:&lt;name&gt;:&lt;file&gt;:&lt;size&gt;
           Configures  a particular CNFS cycbuff.  &lt;name&gt; is a symbolic name for the buffer, to be used later in
           a metacycbuff line.  It must be no longer than seven characters.  &lt;file&gt; is  the  full  path  to  the
           buffer  file  or block device, and must be no longer than 63 characters.  &lt;size&gt; is the length of the
           buffer in kilobytes (1 KB  is  1024  bytes).   If  &lt;file&gt;  is  not  a  block  device,  it  should  be
           &lt;size&gt; * 1024 bytes long.

           If you're trying to stay under 2 GB, keep your sizes below "2097152".

           Note that CNFSv4 supports files and partitions up to 16 TB.

       <u>metacycbuff</u>:&lt;name&gt;:&lt;buffer&gt;[,&lt;buffer&gt;,...][:&lt;mode&gt;]
           Specifies  a  collection  of  CNFS  buffers  that  make up a single logical storage location from the
           perspective of INN.  Metacycbuffs are referred to in <u>storage.conf</u> as storage locations for  articles,
           so  in  order  to actually put articles in a cycbuff, it has to be listed as part of some metacycbuff
           which is then referenced in <u>storage.conf</u>.

           &lt;name&gt; is the symbolic name of the metacycbuff, referred to in the options: field of  "cnfs"  entries
           in <u>storage.conf</u>.  It must be no longer than eight characters.  &lt;buffer&gt; is the name of a cycbuff (the
           &lt;name&gt; part of a cycbuff line), and any number of cycbuffs may be specified, separated by commas.

           If  there  is  more  than  one  cycbuff  in a metacycbuff, there are two ways that INN can distribute
           articles between the cycbuffs.  The default mode, "INTERLEAVE", stores the articles in  each  cycbuff
           in a round-robin fashion, one article per cycbuff in the order listed.  If the cycbuffs are of wildly
           different  sizes,  this  can  cause some of them to roll over much faster than others, and it may not
           give the best performance depending on your disk  layout.   The  other  storage  mode,  "SEQUENTIAL",
           instead  writes to each cycbuff in turn until that cycbuff is full and then moves on to the next one,
           returning to the first and starting a new cycle when the last one is full.  To specify a mode  rather
           than leaving it at the default, add a colon and the mode ("INTERLEAVE" or "SEQUENTIAL") at the end of
           the metacycbuff line.

       <b>innd</b>  only reads <u>cycbuff.conf</u> on startup, so if you change anything in this file and want <b>innd</b> to pick up
       the changes, you have to use "ctlinnd xexec innd"; "ctlinnd reload all ''" is not sufficient.

       When articles are stored, the cycbuff into which they're stored is saved as part of  the  article  token.
       In  order  for  INN  to  retrieve  articles  from a cycbuff, that cycbuff must be listed in <u>cycbuff.conf</u>.
       However, if INN should not write to a cycbuff, it doesn't need to be  (and  shouldn't  be)  listed  in  a
       metacycbuff.

       This  provides  an  easy  way  to  retire a cycbuff.  Just remove it from its metacycbuff, leaving in the
       cycbuff line, and restart <b>innd</b> (with, for example, "ctlinnd xexec innd").  No new articles  will  be  put
       into the cycbuff, but neither will any articles expire from it.  After you no longer need the articles in
       the  cycbuff,  just  remove  it entirely from <u>cycbuff.conf</u>.  Then all of the articles will appear to have
       been deleted to INN, and the next nightly expire run will clean up any remaining references to them.

       Adding a new cycbuff just requires creating it (see below),  adding  a  cycbuff  line,  adding  it  to  a
       metacycbuff,  and then restarting <b>innd</b>.  Similarly, changing the allocation of an existing cycbuff from a
       metacycbuff to another one just requires modifying the two metacycbuffs accordingly, and then  restarting
       <b>innd</b>.  (Only the cycbuff is noted noted in the storage API tokens.)

</pre><h4><b>CREATING</b> <b>CYCBUFFS</b></h4><pre>
       When  creating  a  new  cycbuff,  there  are  two different methods for creating the buffers in which the
       articles will be stored.

       1.  Create a large file on top of a regular file system.  The easiest way to do  this  is  probably  with
           <a href="../man1/dd.1.html">dd</a>(1), using a command like:

               dd if=/dev/zero of=/path/to/cycbuff bs=1024 count=&lt;size&gt;

           where  &lt;size&gt; is the size from the cycbuff line in <u>cycbuff.conf</u>.  <u>INSTALL</u> contains a script that will
           generate these commands for you from your <u>cycbuff.conf</u> file.

           This is the simplest method, but has the disadvantage that very large files on regular  file  systems
           can  be  fairly  slow to access, particularly at the end of the file, and INN incurs unnecessary file
           system overhead when accessing the cycbuff.

       2.  Use block devices directly.  If your operating system allows you to  call  mmap()  on  block  devices
           (Solaris  and  recent versions of Linux do, FreeBSD at last report does not), this is the recommended
           method since you can avoid all of the native file system overhead.

           Note that some OSes do not support files larger than 2 GB, which will limit the size you can  make  a
           single  cycbuff, but you can still combine many cycbuffs into each metacycbuff.  Very old versions of
           Linux (before 2.4 kernels, that raised the limit to 2 TB) are known to have this limitation;  FreeBSD
           does  not.  Some OSes that support large files don't support direct access to block devices for large
           partitions (Solaris prior to Solaris 7, or not running in 64-bit mode, is in this category); on those
           OSes, if you want cycbuffs over 2 GB, you'll have to use regular  files.   If  in  doubt,  keep  your
           cycbuffs smaller than 2 GB.

           Partition  the  disk  to make each partition equal to or smaller than 2 GB.  If you're using Solaris,
           set up your partitions to avoid the first cylinder of the disk (or otherwise the cycbuff header  will
           overwrite  the disk partition table and render the cycbuffs inaccessible).  Then, create device files
           for each block device you're going to use.

           It's not recommended to use the block device files in  <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u>,  since  the  news  system  doesn't  have
           permission  to  write  to  them  and  changing  the permissions of the system device files may affect
           something else.  Instead, use <a href="../man1/mknod.1.html">mknod</a>(1) to create a new  set  of  block  devices  (in  somewhere  like
           <u>pathspool</u>/cycbuffs  that's  only writable by the news user).  To do this, run "ls -Ll" on the devices
           in <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u> that correspond to the block devices that you want  to  use.   The  major  and  minor  device
           numbers  are  in  the  fifth and sixth columns (right before the date), respectively.  Then run mknod
           like:

               mknod &lt;file&gt; b &lt;major&gt; &lt;minor&gt;

           where &lt;file&gt; is the path to the device to create (matching the &lt;file&gt; part of the cycbuff  line)  and
           &lt;major&gt; and &lt;minor&gt; are the major and minor device numbers as discovered above.

           Here's a short script to do this when given the path to the system device file as an argument:

               #!<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
               base=`echo "$1" | sed 's%.*/%%'`
               major=`ls -Ll "$1" | awk '{print $5}' | tr -d ,`
               minor=`ls -Ll "$1" | awk '{print $6}`
               mkdir -p &lt;pathspool in inn.conf&gt;/cycbuffs
               mknod &lt;pathspool&gt;/cycbuffs/"$base" b "$major" "$minor"
               chown news:news &lt;pathspool&gt;/cycbuffs/"$base"
               chmod 644 &lt;pathspool&gt;/cycbuffs/"$base"

           Make sure that the created files are owned by the news user and news group, as specified at configure
           time  (the  default being "news" for both).  Also make sure that the permissions on the devices allow
           the news user to read and write, and if you want other users on the system to be able to  use  <b>sm</b>  to
           retrieve articles, make sure they're world-readable.

       Once  you  have everything configured properly and you start <b>innd</b>, you should see messages in <u>news.notice</u>
       that look like:

           innd: CNFS: no magic cookie found for cycbuff ONE, initializing

       where "ONE" will be whatever you called your cycbuff.
