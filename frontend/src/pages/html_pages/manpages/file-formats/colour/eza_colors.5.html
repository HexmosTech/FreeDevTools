</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       eza_colors — customising the file and UI colours of eza

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       The  EZA_COLORS environment variable can be used to customise the colours that eza uses to highlight file
       names, file metadata, and parts of the UI.

       You can use the dircolors program to generate a script that sets the variable from an input file,  or  if
       you don’t mind editing long strings of text, you can just type it out directly.  These variables have the
       following structure:

       • A list of key-value pairs separated by `=', such as `*.txt=32'.

       • Multiple ANSI formatting codes are separated by `;', such as `*.txt=32;1;4'.

       • Finally, multiple pairs are separated by `:', such as `*.txt=32:*.mp3=1;35'.

       The  key half of the pair can either be a two-letter code or a file glob, and anything that’s not a valid
       code will be treated as a glob, including keys that happen to be two letters long.

       For backwards compatibility EXA_COLORS environment variables is checked if EZA_COLORS is unset.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       EZA_COLORS="uu=0:gu=0"
              Disable the “current user” highlighting

       EZA_COLORS="da=32"
              Turn the date column green

       EZA_COLORS="Vagrantfile=1;4;33"
              Highlight Vagrantfiles

       EZA_COLORS="*.zip=38;5;125"
              Override the existing zip colour

       EZA_COLORS="*.md=38;5;121:*.log=38;5;248"
              Markdown files a shade of green, log files a shade of grey

</pre><h4><b>LIST</b> <b>OF</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       LS_COLORS can use these ten codes:

       di     directories

       ex     executable files

       fi     regular files

       pi     named pipes

       so     sockets

       cd     character devices

       ln     symlinks

       or     symlinks with no target

       Values in EXA_COLORS override those given in LS_COLORS,  so  you  don’t  need  to  re-write  an  existing
       LS_COLORS variable with proprietary extensions.

</pre><h4><b>LIST</b> <b>OF</b> <b>STYLES</b></h4><pre>
       Unlike  some  versions  of ls, the given ANSI values must be valid colour codes: eza won’t just print out
       whichever characters are given.

       The codes accepted by eza are:

       1      for bold

       2      for dimmed

       3      for italic

       4      for underline

       31     for red text

       32     for green text

       33     for yellow text

       34     for blue text

       35     for purple text

       36     for cyan text

       37     for white text

       90     for dark gray text

       91     for bright red text

       92     for bright green text

       93     for bright yellow text

       94     for bright blue text

       95     for bright purple text

       96     for bright cyan text

       97     for bright text

       38;5;nnn
              for a colour from 0 to 255 (replace the nnn part)

       Many terminals will treat bolded text as a different colour, or at least provide the option to.

       eza provides its own built-in set of file extension mappings that cover a  large  range  of  common  file
       extensions,  including  documents, archives, media, and temporary files.  Any mappings in the environment
       variables will override this default set: running eza with LS_COLORS="*.zip=32" will turn zip files green
       but leave the colours of other compressed files alone.

       You can also disable this built-in  set  entirely  by  including  a  reset  entry  at  the  beginning  of
       EZA_COLORS.    So   setting   EZA_COLORS="reset:*.txt=31"   will   highlight  only  text  files;  setting
       EZA_COLORS="reset" will highlight nothing.
