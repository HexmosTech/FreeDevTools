       firewalld.zones - firewalld zones

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>zone?</b>
       A network zone defines the level of trust for network connections. This is a one to many relation, which
       means that a connection can only be part of one zone, but a zone can be used for many network
       connections.

       The zone defines the firewall features that are enabled in this zone:

       <b>Intra</b> <b>Zone</b> <b>Forwarding</b>

           Allows packets received by a zone to be forwarded to other interfaces or sources within the same
           zone, even if the zone's target is not <u>ACCEPT</u>.

       <b>Predefined</b> <b>services</b>

           A service is a combination of port and/or protocol entries. Optionally netfilter helper modules can
           be added and also a IPv4 and IPv6 destination address.

       <b>Ports</b> <b>and</b> <b>protocols</b>

           Definition of <u>tcp</u>, <u>udp</u>, <u>sctp</u> or <u>dccp</u> ports, where ports can be a single port or a port range.

       <b>ICMP</b> <b>blocks</b>

           Blocks selected Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) messages. These messages are either
           information requests or created as a reply to information requests or in error conditions.

       <b>ICMP</b> <b>block</b> <b>inversion</b>

           Changes how ICMP messages are handled. When enabled, all ICMP message types are blocked, <u>except</u> for
           those in the ICMP block list.

       <b>Masquerading</b>

           The addresses of a private network are mapped to and hidden behind a public IP address. This is a
           form of address translation.

       <b>Forward</b> <b>ports</b>

           A forward port is either mapped to the same port on another host or to another port on the same host
           or to another port on another host.

       <b>Rich</b> <b>language</b> <b>rules</b>

           The rich language extends the elements (service, port, icmp-block, masquerade, forward-port and
           source-port) with additional source and destination addresses, logging, actions and limits for logs
           and actions. It can also be used for host or network white and black listing (for more information,
           please have a look at <b><a href="../man5/firewalld.richlanguage.5.html">firewalld.richlanguage</a></b>(5)).

       For more information on the zone file format, please have a look at <b><a href="../man5/firewalld.zone.5.html">firewalld.zone</a></b>(5).

   <b>Which</b> <b>zones</b> <b>are</b> <b>available?</b>
       Here are the zones provided by firewalld sorted according to the default trust level of the zones from
       untrusted to trusted:

       drop
           Any incoming network packets are dropped, there is no reply. Only outgoing network connections are
           possible.

       block
           Any incoming network connections are rejected with an <u>icmp-host-prohibited</u> message for IPv4 and
           <u>icmp6-adm-prohibited</u> for IPv6. Only network connections initiated within this system are possible.

       public
           For use in public areas. You do not trust the other computers on networks to not harm your computer.
           Only selected incoming connections are accepted.

       external
           For use on external networks with masquerading enabled especially for routers. You do not trust the
           other computers on networks to not harm your computer. Only selected incoming connections are
           accepted.

       dmz
           For computers in your demilitarized zone that are publicly-accessible with limited access to your
           internal network. Only selected incoming connections are accepted.

       work
           For use in work areas. You mostly trust the other computers on networks to not harm your computer.
           Only selected incoming connections are accepted.

       home
           For use in home areas. You mostly trust the other computers on networks to not harm your computer.
           Only selected incoming connections are accepted.

       internal
           For use on internal networks. You mostly trust the other computers on the networks to not harm your
           computer. Only selected incoming connections are accepted.

       trusted
           All network connections are accepted.

   <b>Which</b> <b>zone</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>used?</b>
       A public WIFI network connection for example should be mainly untrusted, a wired home network connection
       should be fairly trusted. Select the zone that best matches the network you are using.

   <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>configure</b> <b>or</b> <b>add</b> <b>zones?</b>
       To configure or add zones you can either use one of the firewalld interfaces to handle and change the
       configuration: These are the graphical configuration tool firewall-config, the command line tool
       <b>firewall-cmd</b> or the D-Bus interface. Or you can create or copy a zone file in one of the configuration
       directories.  <u>/usr/lib/firewalld/zones</u> is used for default and fallback configurations and
       <u>/etc/firewalld/zones</u> is used for user created and customized configuration files.

   <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>or</b> <b>change</b> <b>a</b> <b>zone</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>connection?</b>
       The zone is stored into the ifcfg of the connection with <b>ZONE=</b> option. If the option is missing or empty,
       the default zone set in firewalld is used.

       If the connection is controlled by NetworkManager, you can also use <b>nm-connection-editor</b> to change the
       zone.

       For the addition or change of interfaces that are not under control of NetworkManager: firewalld tries to
       change the ZONE setting in the ifcfg file, if an ifcfg file exists that is using the interface.

       Only for the removal of interfaces that are not under control of NetworkManager: firewalld is not trying
       to change the ZONE setting in the ifcfg file. This is needed to make sure that an ifdown of the interface
       will not result in a reset of the zone setting to the default zone. Only the zone binding is then removed
       in firewalld then.
