       midicsv - MIDI Comma-Separated Value (CSV) file format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>midicsv</b>  and  <b>csvmidi</b>  programs permit you to intertranslate standard MIDI files and comma-separated
       value (CSV) files.  These CSV files preserve all information in the MIDI file, and  may  be  loaded  into
       spreadsheet  and  database  programs  or  easily  manipulated  with text processing tools.  This document
       describes the CSV representation of MIDI files written by <b>midicsv</b>  and  read  by  <b>csvmidi</b>.   Readers  are
       assumed  to understand the structure, terminology, and contents of MIDI files-please refer to a MIDI file
       reference for details.

</pre><h4><b>RECORD</b> <b>STRUCTURE</b></h4><pre>
       Each record in the CSV representation of a MIDI contains at least three fields:

       <b>Track</b>     Numeric field identifying the track to which this record belongs.   Tracks  of  MIDI  data  are
                 numbered  starting  at  1.   Track  0 is reserved for file header, information, and end of file
                 records.

       <b>Time</b>      Absolute time, in terms of MIDI clocks, at which this event occurs.  Meta-events for which time
                 is not meaningful (for example, song title, copyright information, etc.) have an absolute  time
                 of 0.

       <b>Type</b>      Name  identifying  the type of the record.  Record types are text consisting of upper and lower
                 case letters and the underscore (``_''), contain no embedded spaces, and are  not  enclosed  in
                 quotes.   <b>csvmidi</b> ignores upper/lower case in the <b>Type</b> field; the specifications ``<b>Note_on_c</b>'',
                 ``<b>Note_On_C</b>'', and ``<b>NOTE_ON_C</b>'' are considered identical.

       Records in the CSV file are sorted first by the track number, then by time.  Out of order records will be
       discarded with an error message from <b>csvmidi</b>.  Following the three required fields are  parameter  fields
       which  depend  upon  the  <b>Type</b>;  some  <b>Type</b>s  take  no parameters.  Each <b>Type</b> and its parameter fields is
       discussed below.

       Any line with an initial nonblank character of ``<b>#</b>'' or ``<b>;</b>'' is ignored; either delimiter may be used to
       introduce comments in a CSV file.  Only full-line comments are permitted; you cannot use these delimiters
       to terminate scanning of a regular data record.  Completely blank lines are ignored.

   <b>File</b> <b>Structure</b> <b>Records</b>
       <b>0,</b> <b>0,</b> <b>Header</b><u>,</u> <u>format,</u> <u>nTracks,</u> <u>division</u>
            The first record of a CSV MIDI file is always the <b>Header</b> record.  Parameters are  <u>format</u>:  the  MIDI
            file type (0, 1, or 2), <u>nTracks</u>: the number of tracks in the file, and <u>division</u>: the number of clock
            pulses per quarter note.  The <b>Track</b> and <b>Time</b> fields are always zero.

       <b>0,</b> <b>0,</b> <b>End_of_file</b>
            The  last  record in a CSV MIDI file is always an <b>End_of_file</b> record.  Its <b>Track</b> and <b>Time</b> fields are
            always zero.

       <u>Track,</u> <b>0,</b> <b>Start_track</b>
            A <b>Start_track</b> record marks the start of a new track, with the <u>Track</u> field giving the  track  number.
            All  records  between  the  <b>Start_track</b>  record  and the matching <b>End_track</b> will have the same <u>Track</u>
            field.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>End_track</b>
            An <b>End_track</b> marks the end of events for the specified  <u>Track</u>.   The  <u>Time</u>  field  gives  the  total
            duration of the track, which will be identical to the <u>Time</u> in the last event before the <b>End_track</b>.

   <b>File</b> <b>Meta-Events</b>
       The following events occur within MIDI tracks and specify various kinds of information and actions.  They
       may  appear  at any time within the track.  Those which provide general information for which time is not
       relevant usually appear at the start of the track with <b>Time</b> zero, but this is not a requirement.

       Many of these meta-events include a text string  argument.   Text  strings  are  output  in  CSV  records
       enclosed  in ASCII double quote (") characters.  Quote characters embedded within strings are represented
       by two consecutive quotes.  Non-graphic characters in the  ISO  8859/1  Latin  1  set  are  output  as  a
       backslash  followed  by  their  three  digit  octal character code.  Two consecutive backslashes denote a
       literal backslash in the string.  Strings in MIDI files can be extremely long, theoretically as  many  as
       2**28-1  characters;  programs which process MIDI CSV files should take care to avoid buffer overflows or
       truncation resulting from lines containing long string items.  All meta-events which take a text argument
       are identified by a suffix of ``<b>_t</b>''.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Title_t,</b> <b>"</b><u>Text</u><b>"</b>
              The <u>Text</u> specifies the title of the track or sequence.  The first <b>Title</b> meta-event  in  a  type  0
              MIDI  file,  or  in the first track of a type 1 file gives the name of the work.  Subsequent <b>Title</b>
              meta-events in other tracks give the names of those tracks.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Copyright_t,</b> <b>"</b><u>Text</u><b>"</b>
              The <u>Text</u> specifies copyright information for the sequence.  This is usually placed at  time  0  of
              the first track in the sequence.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Instrument_name_t,</b> <b>"</b><u>Text</u><b>"</b>
              The  <u>Text</u> names the instrument intended to play the contents of this track, This is usually placed
              at time 0 of the track.  Note that this meta-event is simply a description; MIDI synthesisers  are
              not  required  (and  rarely  if  ever)  respond  to it.  This meta-event is particularly useful in
              sequences prepared for synthesisers which do not conform to the General  MIDI  patch  set,  as  it
              documents  the intended instrument for the track when the sequence is used on a synthesiser with a
              different patch set.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Marker_t,</b> <b>"</b><u>Text</u><b>"</b>
              The  <u>Text</u>  marks  a  point  in  the  sequence  which  occurs  at  the  given  <u>Time</u>,  for   example
              "Third Movement".

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Cue_point_t,</b> <b>"</b><u>Text</u><b>"</b>
              The  <u>Text</u>  identifies  synchronisation  point  which  occurs  at  the specified <u>Time</u>, for example,
              "Door slams".

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Lyric_t,</b> <b>"</b><u>Text</u><b>"</b>
              The <u>Text</u> gives a lyric intended to be sung at the given <u>Time</u>.  Lyrics are often broken  down  into
              separate syllables to time-align them more precisely with the sequence.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Text_t,</b> <b>"</b><u>Text</u><b>"</b>
              This  meta-event  supplies  an arbitrary <u>Text</u> string tagged to the <u>Track</u> and <u>Time</u>.  It can be used
              for textual information which doesn't fall into one of the more specific categories given above.

       <u>Track,</u> <b>0,</b> <b>Sequence_number,</b> <u>Number</u>
              This meta-event specifies a sequence <u>Number</u> between 0 and 65535, used to arrange  multiple  tracks
              in a type 2 MIDI file, or to identify the sequence in which a collection of type 0 or 1 MIDI files
              should  be  played.  The <b>Sequence_number</b> meta-event should occur at <b>Time</b> zero, at the start of the
              track.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>MIDI_port,</b> <u>Number</u>
              This meta-event specifies that subsequent events in the <b>Track</b> should be sent to  MIDI  port  (bus)
              <u>Number</u>,  between  0  and  255.   This meta-event usually appears at the start of a track with <b>Time</b>
              zero, but may appear within a track should the need arise to change the port while  the  track  is
              being played.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Channel_prefix,</b> <u>Number</u>
              This meta-event specifies the MIDI channel that subsequent meta-events and <b>System_exclusive</b> events
              pertain to.  The channel <u>Number</u> specifies a MIDI channel from 0 to 15.  In fact, the <u>Number</u> may be
              as  large  as  255,  but  the  consequences  of  specifying  a  channel number greater than 15 are
              undefined.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Time_signature,</b> <u>Num,</u> <u>Denom,</u> <u>Click,</u> <u>NotesQ</u>
              The time signature, metronome click rate, and number of 32nd notes per MIDI quarter note (24  MIDI
              clock times) are given by the numeric arguments.  <u>Num</u> gives the numerator of the time signature as
              specified on sheet music.  <u>Denom</u> specifies the denominator as a negative power of two, for example
              2  for  a  quarter  note,  3  for  an eighth note, etc.  <u>Click</u> gives the number of MIDI clocks per
              metronome click, and <u>NotesQ</u> the number of 32nd notes in the nominal MIDI quarter note time  of  24
              clocks (8 for the default MIDI quarter note definition).

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Key_signature,</b> <u>Key,</u> <u>Major/Minor</u>
              The  key  signature is specified by the numeric <u>Key</u> value, which is 0 for the key of C, a positive
              value for each sharp above C, or a negative value for each flat below C,  thus  in  the  inclusive
              range -7 to 7.  The <u>Major/Minor</u> field is a quoted string which will be <b>"major"</b> for a major key and
              <b>"minor"</b> for a minor key.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Tempo,</b> <u>Number</u>
              The  tempo is specified as the <u>Number</u> of microseconds per quarter note, between 1 and 16777215.  A
              value of 500000 corresponds to 120 quarter notes ("beats")  per  minute.   To  convert  beats  per
              minute to a <b>Tempo</b> <u>value</u>, take the quotient from dividing 60,000,000 by the beats per minute.

       <u>Track,</u> <b>0,</b> <b>SMPTE_offset,</b> <u>Hour,</u> <u>Minute,</u> <u>Second,</u> <u>Frame,</u> <u>FracFrame</u>
              This  meta-event,  which  must occur with a zero <b>Time</b> at the start of a track, specifies the SMPTE
              time code at which it should start playing.  The <u>FracFrame</u> field gives the fractional  frame  time
              (0 to 99).

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Sequencer_specific,</b> <u>Length,</u> <u>Data,</u> <u>...</u>
              The  <b>Sequencer_specific</b>  meta-event  is used to store vendor-proprietary data in a MIDI file.  The
              <u>Length</u> can be any value between 0 and 2**28-1, specifying the number of <u>Data</u> bytes (between 0  and
              255)  which  follow.  <b>Sequencer_specific</b> records may be very long; programs which process MIDI CSV
              files should be careful to protect against buffer overflows and truncation of these records.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Unknown_meta_event,</b> <u>Type,</u> <u>Length,</u> <u>Data,</u> <u>...</u>
              If  <b>midicsv</b>  encounters  a  meta-event  with  a  code  not  defined  by  the  standard  MIDI  file
              specification,  it outputs an unknown meta-event record in which <u>Type</u> gives the numeric meta-event
              type code, <u>Length</u> the number of data bytes in the meta-event, which can be any value between 0 and
              2**28-1, followed by the <u>Data</u> bytes.  Since meta-events include their own length, it  is  possible
              to  parse them even if their type and meaning are unknown.  <b>csvmidi</b> will reconstruct unknown meta-
              events with the same type code and content as in the original MIDI file.

   <b>Channel</b> <b>Events</b>
       These events are the ``meat and potatoes'' of MIDI files: the actual notes and modifiers that command the
       instruments to play the music.  Each has a MIDI channel number as its first argument, followed by  event-
       specific  parameters.   To  permit programs which process CSV files to easily distinguish them from meta-
       events, names of channel events all have a suffix of ``<b>_c</b>''.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Note_on_c,</b> <u>Channel,</u> <u>Note,</u> <u>Velocity</u>
              Send a command to play the specified <u>Note</u> (Middle C is defined as <u>Note</u> number 60; all other  notes
              are  relative  in the MIDI specification, but most instruments conform to the well-tempered scale)
              on the given <u>Channel</u> with <u>Velocity</u> (0 to 127).  A <b>Note_on_c</b> event with <u>Velocity</u> zero is equivalent
              to a <b>Note_off_c</b>.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Note_off_c,</b> <u>Channel,</u> <u>Note,</u> <u>Velocity</u>
              Stop playing the specified <u>Note</u> on the given <u>Channel</u>.  The <u>Velocity</u> should be zero, but you  never
              know what you'll find in a MIDI file.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Pitch_bend_c,</b> <u>Channel,</u> <u>Value</u>
              Send  a pitch bend command of the specified <u>Value</u> to the given <u>Channel</u>.  The pitch bend <u>Value</u> is a
              14 bit unsigned integer and hence must be in the inclusive range from 0 to 16383.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Control_c,</b> <u>Channel,</u> <u>Control_num,</u> <u>Value</u>
              Set the controller <u>Control_num</u> on the given <u>Channel</u> to the specified <u>Value</u>.  <u>Control_num</u> and <u>Value</u>
              must be in the inclusive range 0 to 127.  The assignment of <u>Control_num</u> values to effects  differs
              from  instrument to instrument.  The General MIDI specification defines the meaning of controllers
              1 (modulation), 7 (volume), 10 (pan), 11 (expression), and 64 (sustain), but not  all  instruments
              and  patches  respond  to these controllers.  Instruments which support those capabilities usually
              assign reverberation to controller 91 and chorus to controller 93.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Program_c,</b> <u>Channel,</u> <u>Program_num</u>
              Switch the specified <u>Channel</u> to program (patch) <u>Program_num</u>, which must be between 0 and 127.  The
              program or patch selects which instrument and associated settings that channel will emulate.   The
              General  MIDI  specification  provides a standard set of instruments, but synthesisers are free to
              implement other sets of instruments and many permit the user to create custom patches  and  assign
              them to program numbers.

              Apparently  due  to instrument manufacturers' skepticism about musicians' ability to cope with the
              number zero, many instruments number patches from 1 to 128 rather than the 0 to  127  used  within
              MIDI  files.   When interpreting <u>Program_num</u> values, note that they may be one less than the patch
              numbers given in an instrument's documentation.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Channel_aftertouch_c,</b> <u>Channel,</u> <u>Value</u>
              When a key is held down after being pressed, some synthesisers send the pressure, repeatedly if it
              varies, until the key is released, but do  not  distinguish  pressure  on  different  keys  played
              simultaneously  and  held  down.   This is referred to as ``monophonic'' or ``channel'' aftertouch
              (the latter indicating it applies to the <u>Channel</u> as a whole, not individual note numbers  on  that
              channel).   The pressure <u>Value</u> (0 to 127) is typically taken to apply to the last note played, but
              instruments are not guaranteed to behave in this manner.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>Poly_aftertouch_c,</b> <u>Channel,</u> <u>Note,</u> <u>Value</u>
              Polyphonic synthesisers (those capable of  playing  multiple  notes  simultaneously  on  a  single
              channel), often provide independent aftertouch for each note.  This event specifies the aftertouch
              pressure <u>Value</u> (0 to 127) for the specified <u>Note</u> on the given <u>Channel</u>.

   <b>System</b> <b>Exclusive</b> <b>Events</b>
       System  Exclusive  events  permit  storing vendor-specific information to be transmitted to that vendor's
       products.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>System_exclusive,</b> <u>Length,</u> <u>Data,</u> <u>...</u>
              The <u>Length</u> bytes of <u>Data</u> (0 to 255) are sent at the specified <u>Time</u> to the MIDI channel defined  by
              the  most  recent  <b>Channel_prefix</b>  event  on  the <u>Track</u>, as a System Exclusive message.  Note that
              <u>Length</u> can be any value between 0 and 2**28-1.  Programs which process MIDI CSV  files  should  be
              careful to protect against buffer overflows and truncation of these records.

       <u>Track,</u> <u>Time,</u> <b>System_exclusive_packet,</b> <u>Length,</u> <u>Data,</u> <u>...</u>
              The  <u>Length</u> bytes of <u>Data</u> (0 to 255) are sent at the specified <u>Time</u> to the MIDI channel defined by
              the most recent <b>Channel_prefix</b> event on the <u>Track</u>.  The <u>Data</u> bytes are simply blasted out  to  the
              MIDI  bus  without  any  prefix.   This message is used by MIDI devices which break up long system
              exclusive message into small packets, spaced  out  in  time  to  avoid  overdriving  their  modest
              microcontrollers.   Note  that  <u>Length</u>  can  be  any  value between 0 and 2**28-1.  Programs which
              process MIDI CSV files should be careful to protect against buffer  overflows  and  truncation  of
              these records.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  CSV  representation of a MIDI file is simply a text-oriented encoding of its contents.  If the input
       to <b>midicsv</b> contains errors which violate the MIDI  standard,  the  resulting  CSV  file  will  faithfully
       replicate  these  errors.   Similarly,  the  CSV  input to <b>csvmidi</b> must not only consist of records which
       conform to the syntax given in this document, the input as a whole must also be  a  <u>semantically</u>  correct
       MIDI  file.   Programs which wish to use <b>csvmidi</b> to generate MIDI files from scratch should be careful to
       conform to the structure required of MIDI  files.   When  in  doubt,  use  <b>midicsv</b>  to  dump  a  sequence
       comparable to the one your program will create and use its structure as a template for your own.
