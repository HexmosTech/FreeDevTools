</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ups.conf - UPS definitions for Network UPS Tools

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This file is read by the driver controller <b><a href="../man8/upsdrvctl.8.html">upsdrvctl</a></b>(8), the UPS drivers which use the common core (see
       <b><a href="../man8/nutupsdrv.8.html">nutupsdrv</a></b>(8)), <b><a href="../man8/nut-driver-enumerator.8.html">nut-driver-enumerator</a></b>(8), and the NUT data server <b><a href="../man8/upsd.8.html">upsd</a></b>(8). The file begins with global
       directives, and then each UPS has a section which contains a number of directives that set parameters for
       that UPS.

       A UPS section begins with the name of the UPS in brackets, and continues until the next UPS name in
       brackets or until EOF. The name "default" is used internally in <b><a href="../man8/upsd.8.html">upsd</a></b>(8), so you can’t use it in this
       file.

       You must define the <u>driver</u> and <u>port</u> elements for each entry. Anything after that in a section is
       optional. A simple example might look like this:

           [myups]
                   driver = blazer_ser
                   port = /dev/ttyS0
                   desc = "Web server UPS"

       A slightly more complicated version includes some extras for the hardware-specific part of the driver:

           [bigups]
                   driver = apcsmart
                   port = /dev/cua00
                   cable = 940-0095B
                   sdtype = 2
                   desc = "Database server UPS"

       In this case, the <b><a href="../man8/apcsmart.8.html">apcsmart</a></b>(8) driver will receive variables called "cable" and "sdtype" which have
       special meanings. See the man pages of your driver(s) to learn which variables are supported and what
       they do.

       Here is another example, when connecting a serial UPS on Windows:

           [windows-ups]
                   driver = mge-shut
                   port = "\\\\.\\COM10"
                   desc = "UPS on a Windows machine"

</pre><h4><b>IMPORTANT</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       •   Contents of this file should be pure ASCII (character codes not in range would be ignored with a
           warning message).

       •   Balance the run-time user permissions to access the file (and perhaps the directory it is in) for
           only upsd and the drivers to be able to read it; write access is not needed. It is common to use
           chown root:nut and chmod 640 to set up acceptable file permissions.

           •   Packages (and build recipes) typically prepare one set of user and group accounts for NUT. Custom
               builds with minimal configuration might even use nobody:nogroup or similar, which is inherently
               insecure.

           •   On systems with extra security concerns, NUT drivers, data server should run as separate user
               accounts which would be members of one same group for shared access to local Unix socket files
               and the directory they are in, as well for reading ups.conf, but different groups for other
               configuration file access. This would need some daemons to use customized user, group,
               RUN_AS_USER and/or RUN_AS_GROUP settings to override the single built-in value.

           •   Note that the monitoring, logging, etc. clients are networked-only. They do not need access to
               these files and directories, and can run as an independent user and group altogether.

           •   Keep in mind the security of also any backup copies of this file, e.g. the archive files it might
               end up in.

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>DIRECTIVES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>chroot</b>
           Optional. The driver will <a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot</a>(2) to this directory during initialization. This can be useful when
           securing systems.

       <b>driverpath</b>
           Optional. Path name of the directory in which the UPS driver executables reside. If you don’t specify
           this, the programs look in a built-in default directory, which is often /usr/local/ups/bin.

       <b>statepath</b>
           Optional. Path name of the directory in which the UPS drivers should place their state sockets for
           local communication with upsd data server, rather than the default location that was compiled into
           the program, which is often /var/state/ups.

           Note that the drivers must use the same path as upsd, so the data server would prefer this setting
           from ups.conf global section, if present, over its own in upsd.conf.

           Environment variable NUT_STATEPATH set by caller can override this setting.

       <b>maxstartdelay</b>
           Optional. Same as the UPS field of the same name, but this is the default for UPSes that don’t have
           the field.

       <b>maxretry</b>
           Optional. Specify the number of attempts to start the driver(s), in case of failure, before giving
           up. A delay of <u>retrydelay</u> is inserted between each attempt. Caution should be taken when using this
           option, since it can impact the time taken by your system to start.

           The default is 1 attempt.

       <b>nowait</b>
           Optional. Specify to upsdrvctl to not wait at all for the driver(s) to execute the request command.

           The default (omission) is to wait.

           It can be overridden by NUT_IGNORE_NOWAIT environment variable (e.g. used to work around certain
           issues with systemd otherwise).

       <b>retrydelay</b>
           Optional. Specify the delay between each restart attempt of the driver(s), as specified by <u>maxretry</u>.
           Caution should be taken when using this option, since it can impact the time taken by your system to
           start.

           The default is 5 seconds.

       <b>pollinterval</b>
           Optional. The status of the UPS will be refreshed after a maximum delay which is controlled by this
           setting. This is normally 2 seconds. This setting may be useful if the driver is creating too much of
           a load on your monitoring system or network.

           Note that some drivers (such as <b><a href="../man8/usbhid-ups.8.html">usbhid-ups</a></b>(8), <b><a href="../man8/snmp-ups.8.html">snmp-ups</a></b>(8) and <b><a href="../man8/nutdrv_qx.8.html">nutdrv_qx</a></b>(8)) also have an option
           called <b>pollfreq</b> which controls how frequently some of the less critical parameters are polled.
           Details are provided in the respective driver man pages.

       <b>synchronous</b>
           Optional. The drivers work by default in asynchronous mode initially but can fall back to synchronous
           mode if writes to server socket failed (i.e <b>synchronous=auto</b>). This means that all data are pushed by
           the driver on the communication socket to upsd (Unix socket on Unix, Named pipe on Windows) without
           waiting for these data to be actually consumed. With some HW, such as ePDUs, that can produce a lot
           of data, asynchronous mode may cause some congestion, resulting in the socket to be full, and the
           driver to appear as not connected. In such case, the driver will provide the following debug message:

               write XX bytes to socket Y failed

           By enabling the <u>synchronous</u> flag (value = <u>yes</u>), the driver will wait for data to be consumed by upsd,
           prior to publishing more. This can be enabled either globally or per driver.

           The default of <u>auto</u> acts like <u>no</u> (i.e. asynchronous mode) for backward compatibility of the driver
           behavior, until communications fail with a "Resource temporarily unavailable" condition, which
           happens when the driver has many data points to send in a burst, and the server can not handle that
           quickly enough so the buffer fills up.

       <b>user</b>
           Optional. Overrides the compiled-in default unprivileged username for all NUT device drivers. See the
           discussion of the -u option in <b><a href="../man8/nutupsdrv.8.html">nutupsdrv</a></b>(8) for details.

       <b>group</b>
           Optional. Overrides the compiled-in (and/or global-section) default unprivileged group name for all
           NUT device drivers, used for the socket file access. See the discussion of the -g option in
           <b><a href="../man8/nutupsdrv.8.html">nutupsdrv</a></b>(8) for details. This may be specifically useful for ensuring access to dynamic device
           filesystem nodes, such as USB (or serial-over-USB) hot-plug support, or with device filesystems
           re-generated by an OS for every reboot.

       <b>debug_min</b> <u>INTEGER</u>
           Optional. Specify a minimum debug level for all driver daemons, e.g. for troubleshooting a
           deployment, without impacting foreground or background running mode directly. Command-line option -D
           can only increase this verbosity level.

       <b>LIBUSB_DEBUG</b> <u>INTEGER</u>
           Optional. For run-time troubleshooting of USB-capable NUT drivers, you can specify verbosity of
           LibUSB specific debugging as a numeric value such as 4 ("All messages are emitted"). Should not have
           any practical impact on other NUT drivers.

           For more details, including the currently supported values for your version of the library, see e.g.:

</pre><h4><b>UPS</b> <b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>driver</b>
           Required. This specifies which program will be monitoring this UPS. You need to specify the one that
           is compatible with your hardware. See <b><a href="../man8/nutupsdrv.8.html">nutupsdrv</a></b>(8) for more information on drivers in general and
           pointers to the man pages of specific drivers.

       <b>port</b>
           Required. This is the serial port where the UPS is connected. On a Linux system, the first serial
           port usually is <u>/dev/ttyS0</u>. On FreeBSD and similar systems, it probably will be <u>/dev/cuaa0</u>. On
           Windows, the first serial port will be "\\\\.\\COM1" (note the escaped slashes).

       <b>user</b>
           Optional. Overrides the compiled-in (and/or global-section) default unprivileged username for a
           particular NUT device driver. See the discussion of the -u option in <b><a href="../man8/nutupsdrv.8.html">nutupsdrv</a></b>(8) for details. This
           may be specifically useful for ensuring access to dynamic device filesystem nodes, such as USB (or
           serial-over-USB) hot-plug support, or with device filesystems re-generated by an OS for every reboot.

       <b>group</b>
           Optional. Overrides the compiled-in (and/or global-section) default unprivileged group name for a
           particular NUT device driver, used for the socket file access. See the discussion of the -g option in
           <b><a href="../man8/nutupsdrv.8.html">nutupsdrv</a></b>(8) for details. This may be specifically useful for ensuring access to dynamic device
           filesystem nodes, such as USB (or serial-over-USB) hot-plug support, or with device filesystems
           re-generated by an OS for every reboot.

       <b>sdorder</b>
           Optional. When you have multiple UPSes on your system, you usually need to turn them off in a certain
           order. upsdrvctl shuts down all the 0s, then the 1s, 2s, and so on. To exclude a UPS from the
           shutdown sequence, set this to -1.

           The default value for this parameter is 0.

       <b>sdcommands</b>
           Optional. Comma-separated list of instant command name(s) to send to the UPS when you request its
           shutdown.

           Default logic is built into each driver (where supported) and can be referenced here as the
           shutdown.default value.

           The primary use-case is for devices whose drivers "natively" support trying several commands, but the
           built-in order of those calls a command that is mis-handled by the specific device model (so the
           handling is reported as successful and the loop stops, but nothing happens as far as the load
           power-down is concerned).

           Another use-case is differentiation of automated power-off scenarios where the UPS and its load
           should stay "OFF" (e.g. by building emergency power-off) vs. those where the load should return to
           work automatically when it is safe to do so. NOTE: This would <b>currently</b> need editing of ups.conf for
           such cases before nutshutdown sees the file; but could be better automated in future NUT releases.

               <b>Note</b>
               User-provided commands may be something other than actual shutdown, e.g. a beeper to test that
               the INSTCMD happened such and when expected, and the device was contacted, without impacting the
               load fed by the UPS.

       <b>allow_killpower</b>
           Optional. This allows you to request driver.killpower instant command, to immediately call the
           driver-specific default implementation of upsdrv_shutdown() method, for same effect as when a NUT
           driver is started with -k command-line flag. This option can be toggled with <b><a href="../man8/upsrw.8.html">upsrw</a></b>(8) as
           driver.flag.allow_killpower during run-time.

       <b>desc</b>
           Optional. This allows you to set a brief description that upsd will provide to clients that ask for a
           list of connected equipment.

       <b>nolock</b>
           Optional. When you specify this, the driver skips the port locking routines every time it starts.
           This may allow other processes to seize the port if you start more than one accidentally.

           You should only use this if your system won’t work without it.

           This may be needed on Mac OS X systems.

       <b>ignorelb</b>
           Optional. When you specify this, the driver ignores a low battery condition flag that is reported by
           the UPS (some devices will switch off almost immediately after setting this flag, or will report this
           as soon as the mains fails). Instead it will use either of the following conditions to determine when
           the battery is low:

               battery.charge &lt; battery.charge.low
               battery.runtime &lt; battery.runtime.low

           The idea is to set the battery.charge.low and/or battery.runtime.low levels in <b>ups.conf</b> to a value
           that gives enough time to cleanly shutdown your system:

               override.battery.charge.low = 30
               override.battery.runtime.low = 180

           In order for this to work, your UPS should be able to (reliably) report charge and/or runtime
           remaining on battery. Use with caution!

       <b>maxstartdelay</b>
           Optional. This can be set as a global variable above your first UPS definition and it can also be set
           in a UPS section. This value controls how long upsdrvctl will wait for the driver to finish starting.
           This keeps your system from getting stuck due to a broken driver or UPS.

           Note that after this time upsdrvctl would just move along with its business (whether retrying the
           same driver if maxretry&gt;1, or trying another driver if starting them all, or just eventually exit);
           however, each such most recently started "stuck" driver process may be further initializing in the
           background, and might even succeed eventually.

           They would not be actively killed by upsdrvctl after this timeout expires.

           The default is 75 seconds.

       <b>maxretry</b>
           Optional. This can be set as a global variable above your first UPS definition and it can also be set
           in a UPS section. See explanation above, in the global section.

       <b>retrydelay</b>
           Optional. This can be set as a global variable above your first UPS definition and it can also be set
           in a UPS section. See explanation above, in the global section.

       <b>synchronous</b>
           Optional. Same as the global directive of the same name, but this is for a specific device.

       <b>usb_set_altinterface</b>[=<u>altinterface</u>]
           Optional. Force the USB code to call <a href="../man0/usb_set_altinterface.0.html">usb_set_altinterface</a>(0), as was done in NUT 2.7.2 and earlier.
           This should not be necessary, since the default for bAlternateSetting (as shown in lsusb) is zero on
           all USB devices seen to date. However, this redundant call to usb_set_altinterface() prevents certain
           UPSes from working on Mac OS X. If your UPS requires explicitly setting the alternate interface,
           include this flag, and email the nut-upsdev list with details about your UPS and operating system.

       <b>usb_config_index</b>, <b>usb_hid_rep_index</b>, <b>usb_hid_desc_index</b>, <b>usb_hid_ep_in</b>, <b>usb_hid_ep_out</b>
           Optional. Force use of specific interface, endpoint, descriptor index etc. numbers, rather than
           defaulting to 0 (rarely other values in certain drivers for some devices known to use non-zero
           numbers). Specified as a hexadecimal number.

           As a rule of thumb for usb_hid_desc_index discovery, you can see larger wDescriptorLength values
           (roughly 600+ bytes) in reports of lsusb or similar tools.

       <b>default.&lt;variable&gt;</b>
           Optional. Set a default value for &lt;variable&gt; which is used in case the UPS doesn’t provide a value,
           but will be overwritten if a value is available from the UPS:

               default.input.voltage.nominal = 230

           The above will report the nominal input voltage to be 230, unless the UPS tells us differently.

       <b>override.&lt;variable&gt;</b>
           Optional. Set a value for &lt;value&gt; that overrides any value that may be read from the UPS. Used for
           overriding values from the UPS that are clearly wrong (some devices report wrong values for battery
           voltage for instance):

               override.battery.voltage.nominal = 12

           Use with caution! This will only change the appearance of the variable to the outside world,
           internally in the UPS the original value is used.

       All other fields are passed through to the hardware-specific part of the driver. See those manuals for
       the list of what is allowed.

       <b>debug_min</b> <u>INTEGER</u>
           Optional. Specify a minimum debug level for this driver daemon, e.g. for troubleshooting a
           deployment, without impacting foreground or background running mode directly. If the global debug_min
           is also set, this driver-level setting overrides it. Command-line option -D can only increase this
           verbosity level.

       <b>LIBUSB_DEBUG</b> <u>INTEGER</u>
           Optional. For run-time troubleshooting of USB-capable NUT drivers, you can specify verbosity of
           LibUSB specific debugging as a numeric value such as 4 ("All messages are emitted").
