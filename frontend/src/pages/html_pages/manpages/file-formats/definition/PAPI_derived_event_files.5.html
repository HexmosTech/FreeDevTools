       PAPI_derived_event_files - Describes derived event definition file syntax.

</pre><h4><b>Derived</b> <b>Events</b></h4><pre>
       PAPI provides the ability to define events whose value will be derived from multiple native events. The
       list of native events to be used in a derived event and a formula which describes how to use them is
       provided in an event definition file. The PAPI team provides an event definition file which describes all
       of the supported PAPI preset events. PAPI also allows a user to provide an event definition file that
       describes a set of user defined events which can extend the events PAPI normally supports.

       This page documents the syntax of the commands which can appear in an event definition file.

   <b>General</b> <b>Rules:</b>
       • Blank lines are ignored.
       • Lines that begin with '#' are comments (they are also ignored).
       • Names shown inside &lt; &gt; below represent values that must be provided by the user.
       • If a user provided value contains white space, it must be protected with quotes.
   <b>Commands:</b>
       <b>CPU,&lt;pmuName&gt;</b>
           Specifies  a PMU name which controls if the PRESET and EVENT commands that follow this line should be
           processed. Multiple CPU commands can be entered without PRESET or  EVENT  commands  between  them  to
           provide  a  list  of  PMU  names  to which the derived events that follow will apply. When a PMU name
           provided in the list matches a PMU name known to the running system, the events which follow will  be
           created.  If  none  of the PMU names provided in the list match a PMU name on the running system, the
           events which follow will be ignored. When a new CPU command follows either a PRESET or EVENT command,
           the PMU list is rebuilt.

       <b>PRESET,&lt;eventName&gt;,&lt;derivedType&gt;,&lt;eventAttr&gt;,LDESC,"&lt;longDesc&gt;",SDESC,"&lt;shortDesc&gt;",NOTE,"&lt;note&gt;"</b>
           Declare a PAPI preset derived event.

       <b>EVENT,&lt;eventName&gt;,&lt;derivedType&gt;,&lt;eventAttr&gt;,LDESC,"&lt;longDesc&gt;",SDESC,"&lt;shortDesc&gt;",NOTE,"&lt;note&gt;"</b>
           Declare a user defined derived event.

       <b>Where:</b>

       <b>pmuName:</b>
           The PMU which the following events should apply to. A list of PMU names supported by your system  can
           be obtained by running papi_component_avail on your system.

       <b>eventName:</b>
           Specifies  the name used to identify this derived event. This name should be unique within the events
           on your system.

       <b>derivedType:</b>
           Specifies the kind of derived event being defined (see 'Derived Types' below).

       <b>eventAttr:</b>
           Specifies a formula and a list of base events that are used to compute the derived events value.  The
           syntax of this field depends on the 'derivedType' specified above (see 'Derived Types' below).

       <b>longDesc:</b>
           Provides the long description of the event.

       <b>shortDesc:</b>
           Provides the short description of the event.

       <b>note:</b>
           Provides an event note.

       <b>baseEvent</b> <b>(used</b> <b>below):</b>
           Identifies  an  event on which this derived event is based. This may be a native event (possibly with
           event masks), an already known preset event, or an already known user event.
   <b>Notes:</b>
       The PRESET command has traditionally been used in the PAPI provided preset  definition  file.  The  EVENT
       command  is  intended to be used in user defined event definition files. The code treats them the same so
       they are interchangeable and they can both be used in either event definition file.
   <b>Derived</b> <b>Types:</b>
       This describes values allowed in the 'derivedType' field of the PRESET and EVENT commands. It also  shows
       the syntax of the 'eventAttr' field for each derived type supported by these commands. All of the derived
       events provide a list of one or more events which the derived event is based on (baseEvent). Some derived
       events  provide  a formula that specifies how to compute the derived events value using the baseEvents in
       the list. The following derived types are supported, the syntax of the  'eventAttr'  parameter  for  each
       derived event type is shown in parentheses.

       <b>NOT_DERIVED</b> <b>(&lt;baseEvent&gt;):</b>
           This derived type defines an alias for the existing event 'baseEvent'.

       <b>DERIVED_ADD</b> <b>(&lt;baseEvent1&gt;,&lt;baseEvent2&gt;):</b>
           This  derived  type  defines  a new event that will be the sum of two other events. It has a value of
           'baseEvent1' plus 'baseEvent2'.

       <b>DERIVED_PS</b> <b>(PAPI_TOT_CYC,&lt;baseEvent1&gt;):</b>
           This derived type defines a new event that will  report  the  number  of  'baseEvent1'  events  which
           occurred  per  second.  It has a value of ((('baseEvent1' * cpu_max_mhz) * 1000000 ) / PAPI_TOT_CYC).
           The user must provide PAPI_TOT_CYC as the first event of two events in the event  list  for  this  to
           work correctly.

       <b>DERIVED_ADD_PS</b> <b>(PAPI_TOT_CYC,&lt;baseEvent1&gt;,&lt;baseEvent2&gt;):</b>
           This  derived  type defines a new event that will add together two event counters and then report the
           number which occurred per second. It has a value of (((('baseEvent1' + baseEvent2) *  cpu_max_mhz)  *
           1000000  )  / PAPI_TOT_CYC). The user must provide PAPI_TOT_CYC as the first event of three events in
           the event list for this to work correctly.

       <b>DERIVED_CMPD</b> <b>(&lt;baseEvent1&gt;,&lt;baseEvent2):</b>
           This derived type works much like the NOT_DERIVED type. It is rarely used and it looks like the  code
           just  returns  a  single value returned from the kernel. There is no calculation done to compute this
           events value. Not sure why multiple input events seem to be needed to use this event type.

       <b>DERIVED_SUB</b> <b>(&lt;baseEvent1&gt;,&lt;baseEvent2&gt;):</b>
           This derived type defines a new event that will be the difference between two other events. It has  a
           value of 'baseEvent1' minus 'baseEvent2'.

       <b>DERIVED_POSTFIX</b> <b>(&lt;pfFormula&gt;,&lt;baseEvent1&gt;,&lt;baseEvent2&gt;,</b> <b>...</b> <b>,&lt;baseEventn&gt;):</b>
           This  derived  type  defines  a  new event whose value is computed from several native events using a
           postfix (reverse polish notation) formula. Its value is the result of processing the postfix formula.
           The 'pfFormula' is of the form 'N0|N1|N2|5|*|+|-|' where the '|' acts as a token  separator  and  the
           tokens  N0,  N1,  and  N2  are  place  holders  that represent baseEvent0, baseEvent1, and baseEvent2
           respectively.

       <b>DERIVED_INFIX</b> <b>(&lt;ifFormula&gt;,&lt;baseEvent1&gt;,&lt;baseEvent2&gt;,</b> <b>...</b> <b>,&lt;baseEventn&gt;):</b>
           This derived type defines a new event whose value is computed from several  native  events  using  an
           infix  (algebraic  notation)  formula.  Its  value is the result of processing the infix formula. The
           'ifFormula' is of the form 'N0-(N1+(N2*5))' where the tokens N0, N1, and N2 are  place  holders  that
           represent baseEvent0, baseEvent1, and baseEvent2 respectively.
   <b>Example:</b>
       In the following example, the events PAPI_SP_OPS, USER_SP_OPS, and ALIAS_SP_OPS will all measure the same
       events  and return the same value. They just demonstrate different ways to use the PRESET and EVENT event
       definition commands.

       • # The following lines define pmu names that all share the following events
       • CPU nhm
       • CPU nhm-ex
       • # Events which should be defined for either of the above pmu types

       • EVENT,ALIAS_SP_OPS,NOT_DERIVED,PAPI_SP_OPS,LDESC,'Alias for preset event PAPI_SP_OPS'
       • # End of event definitions for above pmu names and start of a section for a new pmu name.
