       sane-net - SANE network backend

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-net</b>  library  implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to image
       acquisition devices through a network connection.  This makes it possible to control devices attached  to
       a remote host and also provides a means to grant users access to protected resources.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              <u>host</u>:<u>device</u>

       Where  <u>host</u> is the name (or IP address) of the (remote) host and <u>device</u> is the name of the device on this
       host that should be addressed.  If the device name does not contain a colon (:), then the  entire  string
       is  treated  as  the <u>device</u> string for the default host.  The default host is the host listed last in the
       configuration file (see below).

       An IPv6 address can be specified enclosed in square brackets:

              <u>[::1]</u>:<u>device</u>

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>net.conf</u> file contains both backend options and a list of host names (or IP addresses) that should be
       contacted for scan requests. Anything that isn't one of the options listed below will be  treated  as  an
       host name.

       <b>connect_timeout</b> <b>=</b> <b>nsecs</b>
              Timeout  (in  seconds)  for  the  initial connection to the <b><a href="../man8/saned.8.html">saned</a></b>(8) server. This will prevent the
              backend from blocking for several minutes trying to  connect  to  an  unresponsive  <b><a href="../man8/saned.8.html">saned</a></b>(8)  host
              (network  outage,  host  down, ...). The environment variable <b>SANE_NET_TIMEOUT</b> can also be used to
              specify the timeout at runtime.

       Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.  Note that IPv6 addresses in  this  file
       do not need to be enclosed in square brackets.  A sample configuration file is shown below:

              scan-server.somedomain.firm
              192.168.0.1
              # this is a comment
              localhost
              ::1

       The  above  list  of  hosts  can be extended at run-time using environment variable <b>SANE_NET_HOSTS</b>.  This
       environment variable is a colon-separated list of hostnames or IP addresses that should be  contacted  in
       addition to the hosts mentioned in the configuration file.  For example, a user could set the environment
       variable to the string:

              new.scanner.com:[::1]:192.168.0.2:scanner.univ.edu

       To  request  that  hosts  <u>new.scanner.com</u>  ,  <u>[::1]</u>  ,  <u>192.168.0.2</u> and <u>scanner.univ.edu</u> are contacted in
       addition to the hosts listed above.

       For this backend to function  properly,  it  is  also  necessary  to  define  the  <b>sane-port</b>  service  in
       <u><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></u> using a line of the following form:

              sane-port 6566/tcp # SANE network scanner daemon

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/sane.d/net.conf</u>
              The backend configuration file (see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-net.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-net.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              This  environment  variable  specifies  the list of directories that may contain the configuration
              file.  On *NIX systems, the directories are separated by a  colon  (`:'),  under  OS/2,  they  are
              separated  by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file is searched
              in two default directories: first, the current working directory (".") and  then  in  <u>/etc/sane.d</u>.
              If  the  value  of  the environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then the
              default directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting
              <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories <u>tmp/config</u>, <u>.</u>, and <u>/etc/sane.d</u> being
              searched (in this order).

       <b>SANE_NET_HOSTS</b>
              A colon-separated list of host names or IP addresses to be contacted by this backend.

       <b>SANE_NET_TIMEOUT</b>
              Number of seconds to wait for a response from the  <b><a href="../man8/saned.8.html">saned</a></b>(8)  server  for  the  initial  connection
              request.

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_NET</b>
              If  the  library  was  compiled with debug support enabled, this environment variable controls the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 128 requests  all  debug  output  to  be  printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If <b><a href="../man8/saned.8.html">saned</a></b>(8) has timed out, the net backend may loop with authorization requests.
