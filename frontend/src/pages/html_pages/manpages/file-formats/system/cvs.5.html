</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>cvs</b> is a system for providing source control to hierarchical collections of source directories.  Commands
       and procedures for using <b>cvs</b> are described in <b>cvs</b>(<b>1</b>).

       <b>cvs</b> manages <u>source</u> <u>repositories</u>, the directories containing  master  copies  of  the  revision-controlled
       files,  by copying particular revisions of the files to (and modifications back from) developers' private
       <u>working</u> <u>directories</u>.  In terms of file structure, each individual source repository is an immediate  sub‐
       directory of <b>$CVSROOT</b>.

       The files described here are supporting files; they do not have to exist for <b>cvs</b> to operate, but they al‐
       low you to make <b>cvs</b> operation more flexible.

       You  can  use  the `modules' file to define symbolic names for collections of source maintained with <b>cvs</b>.
       If there is no `modules' file, developers must specify complete path  names  (absolute,  or  relative  to
       <b>$CVSROOT</b>) for the files they wish to manage with <b>cvs</b> commands.

       You  can  use  the `commitinfo' file to define programs to execute whenever `<b>cvs</b> <b>commit</b>' is about to exe‐
       cute.  These programs are used for ``pre-commit'' checking to verify that the modified,  added,  and  re‐
       moved  files  are  really ready to be committed.  Some uses for this check might be to turn off a portion
       (or all) of the source repository from a particular person or group.  Or, perhaps,  to  verify  that  the
       changed files conform to the site's standards for coding practice.

       You can use the `cvswrappers' file to record <b>cvs</b> wrapper commands to be used when checking files into and
       out  of  the  repository.   Wrappers allow the file or directory to be processed on the way in and out of
       CVS.  The intended uses are many, one possible use would be to reformat a  C  file  before  the  file  is
       checked in, so all of the code in the repository looks the same.

       You  can  use the `loginfo' file to define programs to execute after any <b>commit</b>, which writes a log entry
       for changes in the repository.  These logging programs might be used to append the log message to a file.
       Or send the log message through electronic mail to a group of developers.  Or, perhaps, post the log mes‐
       sage to a particular newsgroup.

       You can use the `taginfo' file to define programs to execute after any <b>tag</b>or<b>rtag</b> operation.   These  pro‐
       grams might be used to append a message to a file listing the new tag name and the programmer who created
       it, or send mail to a group of developers, or, perhaps, post a message to a particular newsgroup.

       You can use the `rcsinfo' file to define forms for log messages.

       You  can  use  the `editinfo' file to define a program to execute for editing/validating `<b>cvs</b> <b>commit</b>' log
       entries.  This is most useful when used with a `rcsinfo' forms specification, as it can verify  that  the
       proper fields of the form have been filled in by the user committing the change.

       You can use the `cvsignore' file to specify the default list of files to ignore during <b>update</b>.

       You  can  use  the `history' file to record the <b>cvs</b> commands that affect the repository.  The creation of
       this file enables history logging.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>modules</b>
              The `modules' file records your definitions of names for collections of source code.  <b>cvs</b> will use
              these definitions if you use <b>cvs</b> to check in a  file  with  the  right  format  to  `<b>$CVSROOT/CVS‐</b>
              <b>ROOT/modules,v</b>'.

              The `modules' file may contain blank lines and comments (lines beginning with `<b>#</b>') as well as mod‐
              ule  definitions.   Long lines can be continued on the next line by specifying a backslash (``\'')
              as the last character on the line.

              A <u>module</u> <u>definition</u> is a single line of the `modules' file, in either of  two  formats.   In  both
              cases, <u>mname</u> represents the symbolic module name, and the remainder of the line is its definition.

              <u>mname</u> <b>-a</b> <u>aliases</u>...
              This  represents  the simplest way of defining a module <u>mname</u>.  The `<b>-a</b>' flags the definition as a
              simple alias: <b>cvs</b> will treat any use of <u>mname</u> (as a command argument) as  if  the  list  of  names
              <u>aliases</u> had been specified instead.  <u>aliases</u> may contain either other module names or paths.  When
              you  use  paths in <u>aliases</u>, `<b>cvs</b> <b>checkout</b>' creates all intermediate directories in the working di‐
              rectory, just as if the path had been specified explicitly in the <b>cvs</b> arguments.

              <u>mname</u> [ <u>options</u> ] <u>dir</u> [ <u>files</u>... ] [ <b>&amp;</b><u>module</u>... ]

              In the simplest case, this form of module definition reduces to `<u>mname</u> <u>dir</u>'.  This defines all the
              files in directory <u>dir</u> as module <u>mname</u>.  <u>dir</u> is a relative path (from <b>$CVSROOT</b>) to a directory  of
              source  in  one  of the source repositories.  In this case, on <b>checkout</b>, a single directory called
              <u>mname</u> is created as a working directory; no intermediate directory levels  are  used  by  default,
              even if <u>dir</u> was a path involving several directory levels.

              By explicitly specifying <u>files</u> in the module definition after <u>dir</u>, you can select particular files
              from  directory  <u>dir</u>.   The sample definition for <b>modules</b> is an example of a module defined with a
              single file from a particular directory.  Here is another example:

              <b>m4test</b>  <b>unsupported/gnu/m4</b> <b>foreach.m4</b> <b>forloop.m4</b>

              With this definition, executing `<b>cvs</b> <b>checkout</b> <b>m4test</b>'  will  create  a  single  working  directory
              `m4test'  containing  the two files listed, which both come from a common directory several levels
              deep in the <b>cvs</b> source repository.

              A module definition can refer to other modules by including `<b>&amp;</b><u>module</u>' in its definition.  <b>checkout</b>
              creates a subdirectory for each such <u>module</u>, in your working directory.
              <u>New</u> <u>in</u> <b>cvs</b> <u>1.3;</u> avoid this feature if sharing module definitions with older versions of <b>cvs</b>.

              Finally, you can use one or more of the following <u>options</u> in module definitions:

              `<b>-d</b> <u>name</u>', to name the working directory something other than the module name.
              <u>New</u> <u>in</u> <b>cvs</b> <u>1.3;</u> avoid this feature if sharing module definitions with older versions of <b>cvs</b>.

              `<b>-i</b> <u>prog</u>' allows you to specify a program <u>prog</u> to run whenever files in a  module  are  committed.
              <u>prog</u>  runs with a single argument, the full pathname of the affected directory in a source reposi‐
              tory.   The `commitinfo', `loginfo', and `editinfo' files provide other ways to call a program  on
              <b>commit</b>.

              `<b>-o</b>  <u>prog</u>' allows you to specify a program <u>prog</u> to run whenever files in a module are checked out.
              <u>prog</u> runs with a single argument, the module name.

              `<b>-e</b> <u>prog</u>' allows you to specify a program <u>prog</u> to run whenever files in  a  module  are  exported.
              <u>prog</u> runs with a single argument, the module name.

              `<b>-t</b> <u>prog</u>' allows you to specify a program <u>prog</u> to run whenever files in a module are tagged.  <u>prog</u>
              runs with two arguments:  the module name and the symbolic tag specified to <b>rtag</b>.

              `<b>-u</b>  <u>prog</u>'  allows you to specify a program <u>prog</u> to run whenever `<b>cvs</b> <b>update</b>' is executed from the
              top-level directory of the checked-out module.  <u>prog</u> runs with a single argument, the full path to
              the source repository for this module.

       <b>commitinfo</b>, <b>loginfo</b>, <b>rcsinfo</b>, <b>editinfo</b>
              These files all specify programs to call at different points in the `<b>cvs</b>  <b>commit</b>'  process.   They
              have a common structure.  Each line is a pair of fields: a regular expression, separated by white‐
              space  from a filename or command-line template.  Whenever one of the regular expression matches a
              directory name in the repository, the rest of the line is used.  If the line begins with a <b>#</b> char‐
              acter, the entire line is considered a comment and is ignored.  Whitespace between the  fields  is
              also ignored.

              For  `loginfo', the rest of the line is a command-line template to execute.  The templates can in‐
              clude not only a program name, but whatever list of arguments you wish.  If you write  `<b>%s</b>'  some‐
              where on the argument list, <b>cvs</b> supplies, at that point, the list of files affected by the <b>commit</b>.
              The  first entry in the list is the relative path within the source repository where the change is
              being made.  The remaining arguments list the files that are being modified, added, or removed  by
              this <b>commit</b> invocation.

              For  `taginfo',  the rest of the line is a command-line template to execute.  The arguments passed
              to the command are, in order, the <u>tagname</u> <u>,</u> <u>operation</u> (i.e.  <b>add</b> for `tag', <b>mov</b> for `tag -F',  and
              <b>del</b> for `tag -d`), <u>repository</u> <u>,</u> and any remaining are pairs of <b>filename</b> <b>revision</b> <b>.</b>  A non-zero ex‐
              it of the filter program will cause the tag to be aborted.

              For  `commitinfo',  the  rest of the line is a command-line template to execute.  The template can
              include not only a program name, but whatever list of arguments you wish.  The full  path  to  the
              current source repository is appended to the template, followed by the file names of any files in‐
              volved in the commit (added, removed, and modified files).

              For  `rcsinfo', the rest of the line is the full path to a file that should be loaded into the log
              message template.

              For `editinfo', the rest of the line is a command-line template to execute.  The template can  in‐
              clude not only a program name, but whatever list of arguments you wish.  The full path to the cur‐
              rent log message template file is appended to the template.

              You  can use one of two special strings instead of a regular expression: `<b>ALL</b>' specifies a command
              line template that must always be executed, and `<b>DEFAULT</b>' specifies a command line template to use
              if no regular expression is a match.

              The `commitinfo' file contains commands to execute <u>before</u> any other <b>commit</b> activity, to allow  you
              to  check any conditions that must be satisfied before <b>commit</b> can proceed.  The rest of the <b>commit</b>
              will execute only if all selected commands from this file exit with exit status <b>0</b>.

              The `rcsinfo' file allows you to specify <u>log</u> <u>templates</u> for the <b>commit</b> logging session; you can use
              this to provide a form to edit when filling out the <b>commit</b> log.  The field after the  regular  ex‐
              pression,  in  this  file,  contains filenames (of files containing the logging forms) rather than
              command templates.

              The `editinfo' file allows you to execute a script <u>before</u> <u>the</u> <u>commit</u> <u>starts</u>, but after the log in‐
              formation is recorded.  These "edit" scripts can verify information recorded in the log file.   If
              the edit script exits with a non-zero exit status, the commit is aborted.

              The  `loginfo'  file contains commands to execute <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>end</u> of a commit.  The text specified as a
              commit log message is piped through the command; typical uses include sending mail, filing an  ar‐
              ticle in a newsgroup, or appending to a central file.

       <b>cvsignore</b>, <b>.cvsignore</b>
              The default list of files (or <b>sh</b>(<b>1</b>) file name patterns) to ignore during `<b>cvs</b> <b>update</b>'.  At startup
              time,  <b>cvs</b>  loads  the compiled in default list of file name patterns (see <b>cvs</b>(<b>1</b>)).  Then the per-
              repository list included in <b>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvsignore</b> is loaded, if it exists.  Then the per-user
              list is loaded from `$HOME/.cvsignore'.  Finally, as <b>cvs</b> traverses through  your  directories,  it
              will  load  any per-directory `.cvsignore' files whenever it finds one.  These per-directory files
              are only valid for exactly the directory that contains them, not for any sub-directories.

       <b>history</b>
              Create this file in <b>$CVSROOT/CVSROOT</b> to enable history logging (see the description of `<b>cvs</b> <b>histo‐</b>
              <b>ry</b>').
