       lexnames - List of WordNet lexicographer file names and numbers

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       During  WordNet  development synsets are organized into forty-five lexicographer files based on syntactic
       category and logical groupings.  <b><a href="../man1WN/grind.1WN.html">grind</a></b>(1WN) processes these files and produces a  database  suitable  for
       use  with  the  WordNet library, interface code, and other applications.  The format of the lexicographer
       files is described in <b><a href="../man5WN/wninput.5WN.html">wninput</a></b>(5WN).

       A file number corresponds to each lexicographer file.  File numbers are encoded in several parts  of  the
       WordNet  system  as  an efficient way to indicate a lexicographer file name.  The file <b>lexnames</b> lists the
       mapping between file names and numbers, and can be used by programs or end users to correlate the two.

   <b>File</b> <b>Format</b>
       Each line in <b>lexnames</b> contains 3 tab separated fields, and is terminated with a newline  character.   The
       first  field  is the two digit decimal integer file number.  (The first file in the list is numbered <b>00</b>.)
       The second field is the name of the lexicographer file that is represented by that number, and the  third
       field  is an integer that indicates the syntactic category of the synsets contained in the file.  This is
       simply a shortcut  for  programs  and  scripts,  since  the  syntactic  category  is  also  part  of  the
       lexicographer file's name.

   <b>Syntactic</b> <b>Category</b>
       The syntactic category field is encoded as follows:

              <b>1</b>    NOUN
              <b>2</b>    VERB
              <b>3</b>    ADJECTIVE
              <b>4</b>    ADVERB

       The  names  of the lexicographer files and their corresponding file numbers are listed below along with a
