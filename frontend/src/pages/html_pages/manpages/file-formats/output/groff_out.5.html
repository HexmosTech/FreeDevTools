</pre><h4><b>Name</b></h4><pre>
       groff_out - GNU <u>roff</u> intermediate output format

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       The  fundamental  operation  of  the <u><a href="../man1/troff.1.html">troff</a></u>(1) formatter is the translation of the <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7) input language
       into a series of instructions concerned primarily with placing glyphs or geometric  objects  at  specific
       positions  on  a  rectangular  page.   In  the  following  discussion,  the  term  <u>command</u> refers to this
       intermediate output language, never to the <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7)  language  intended  for  use  by  document  authors.
       Intermediate  output  commands  comprise  several  categories:  glyph  output; font, color, and text size
       selection; motion of the printing position; page advancement; drawing of geometric primitives; and device
       control commands, a catch-all for other operations.  The last  includes  directives  to  start  and  stop
       output, identify the intended output device, and embed URL hyperlinks in supported output formats.

       Because  the  front-end  command <u><a href="../man1/groff.1.html">groff</a></u>(1) is a wrapper that normally runs the <u>troff</u> formatter to generate
       intermediate output and an output driver (“postprocessor”) to consume it, users normally do not encounter
       this language.  The <u>groff</u> program's <b>-Z</b> option inhibits postprocessing such that this intermediate  output
       is sent to the standard output stream as when <u>troff</u> is run manually.

       <u>groff</u>'s  intermediate  output  facilitates  the development of output drivers and other postprocessors by
       offering a common programming interface.  It is an extension of the page description  language  developed
       by  Brian  Kernighan  for AT&amp;T device-independent <u>troff</u> circa 1980.  Where a distinction is necessary, we
       will say “<u>troff</u> output” to describe the output of GNU <u>troff</u>, and  “intermediate  output”  to  denote  the
       language  accepted  by  the parser implemented in <u>groff</u>'s internal C++ library used by most of its output
       drivers.

</pre><h4><b>Language</b> <b>concepts</b></h4><pre>
       During the run of <u>troff</u>, the <u>roff</u> input is cracked down to the information on what has to be  printed  at
       what  position  on  the  intended device.  So the language of the <u>intermediate</u> <u>output</u> format can be quite
       small.  Its only elements are commands with or without arguments.  In this document, the  term  “command”
       always  refers  to  the  <u>intermediate</u>  <u>output</u>  language,  never  to  the  <u>roff</u> language used for document
       formatting.  There  are  commands  for  positioning  and  text  writing,  for  drawing,  and  for  device
       controlling.

   <b>Separation</b>
       <u>Classical</u>  <u>troff</u>  <u>output</u>  had  strange  requirements on whitespace.  The <u>groff</u> output parser, however, is
       smart about whitespace by making it maximally optional.  The whitespace characters, i.e., the <u>tab</u>, <u>space</u>,
       and <u>newline</u> characters, always have a syntactical meaning.  They  are  never  printable  because  spacing
       within the output is always done by positioning commands.

       Any  sequence of <u>space</u> or <u>tab</u> characters is treated as a single <u>syntactical</u> <u>space</u>.  It separates commands
       and arguments, but is only required when there would occur a clashing between the command  code  and  the
       arguments  without  the  space.   Most often, this happens when variable length command names, arguments,
       argument lists, or command clusters meet.  Commands and arguments with a known, fixed length need not  be
       separated by <u>syntactical</u> <u>space</u>.

       A  line  break  is  a  syntactical element, too.  Every command argument can be followed by whitespace, a
       comment, or a newline character.  Thus a <u>syntactical</u>  <u>line</u>  <u>break</u>  is  defined  to  consist  of  optional
       <u>syntactical</u> <u>space</u> that is optionally followed by a comment, and a newline character.

       The  normal commands, those for positioning and text, consist of a single letter taking a fixed number of
       arguments.  For historical reasons, the parser allows stacking of such commands on  the  same  line,  but
       fortunately, in <u>groff</u> <u>intermediate</u> <u>output</u>, every command with at least one argument is followed by a line
       break, thus providing excellent readability.

       The  other  commands — those for drawing and device controlling — have a more complicated structure; some
       recognize long command names, and some take a variable number of arguments.  So all <b>D</b> and <b>x</b> commands were
       designed to request a <u>syntactical</u> <u>line</u> <u>break</u> after their last argument.  Only one command, ‘<b>x</b> <b>X</b>’  has  an
       argument  that can stretch over several lines, all other commands must have all of their arguments on the
       same line as the command, i.e., the arguments may not be split by a line break.

       Lines containing only spaces and/or a comment are treated as empty and ignored.

   <b>Argument</b> <b>units</b>
       Some commands accept integer arguments  that  represent  measurements,  but  the  scaling  units  of  the
       formatter's  language  are  never  used.   Most  commands assume a scaling unit of “<b>u</b>” (basic units), and
       others use “<b>z</b>” (scaled points); These are defined by the parameters specified in the device's <u>DESC</u>  file;
       see  <u><a href="../man5/groff_font.5.html">groff_font</a></u>(5)  and,  for more on scaling units, <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7) and <u>Groff:</u> <u>The</u> <u>GNU</u> <u>Implementation</u> <u>of</u> <u>troff</u>,
       the <u>groff</u> Texinfo manual.  Color-related commands use dimensionless integers.

       Note that single characters can have the eighth bit set, as can the names of fonts and special characters
       (this is, glyphs).  The names of glyphs and fonts can be of arbitrary length.  A  glyph  that  is  to  be
       printed will always be in the current font.

       A  string  argument  is  always  terminated by the next whitespace character (space, tab, or newline); an
       embedded <b>#</b> character is regarded as part of the argument, not as the beginning of a comment command.   An
       integer  argument  is  already  terminated by the next non-digit character, which then is regarded as the
       first character of the next argument or command.

   <b>Document</b> <b>parts</b>
       A correct <u>intermediate</u> <u>output</u> document consists of two parts, the <u>prologue</u> and the <u>body</u>.

       The task of the <u>prologue</u> is to set the general device parameters using three exactly specified  commands.
       The <u>groff</u> <u>prologue</u> is guaranteed to consist of the following three lines (in that order):

              <b>x</b> <b>T</b> <u>device</u>
              <b>x</b> <b>res</b> <u>n</u> <u>h</u> <u>v</u>
              <b>x</b> <b>init</b>

       with  the  arguments  set as outlined in subsection “Device Control Commands” below.  However, the parser
       for the <u>intermediate</u> <u>output</u> format is able to swallow additional whitespace and comments as well.

       The <u>body</u> is the main section for processing the document data.  Syntactically, it is a  sequence  of  any
       commands  different  from  the  ones used in the <u>prologue</u>.  Processing is terminated as soon as the first
       <b>x</b> <b>stop</b> command is encountered; the last line of any <u>groff</u> <u>intermediate</u>  <u>output</u>  always  contains  such  a
       command.

       Semantically,  the  <u>body</u>  is page oriented.  A new page is started by a <b>p</b> command.  Positioning, writing,
       and drawing commands are always done within the current page, so  they  cannot  occur  before  the  first
       <b>p</b>  command.   Absolute  positioning  (by  the <b>H</b> and <b>V</b> commands) is done relative to the current page, all
       other positioning is done relative to the current location within this page.

</pre><h4><b>Command</b> <b>reference</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes all <u>intermediate</u> <u>output</u> commands, the classical commands  as  well  as  the  <u>groff</u>
       extensions.

   <b>Comment</b> <b>command</b>
       <b>#</b><u>anything</u>⟨line-break⟩
              A  comment.   Ignore any characters from the <b>#</b> character up to the next newline.  Each comment can
              be preceded by arbitrary <u>syntactical</u> <u>space</u>; every command can be terminated by a comment.

   <b>Simple</b> <b>commands</b>
       The commands in this subsection have a command code consisting of a  single  character,  taking  a  fixed
       number  of  arguments.   Most  of them are commands for positioning and text writing.  These commands are
       smart about whitespace.  Optionally, <u>syntactical</u> <u>space</u> can be inserted before,  after,  and  between  the
       command  letter  and  its  arguments.  All of these commands are stackable, i.e., they can be preceded by
       other simple commands or followed by arbitrary other commands on the same line.  A separating <u>syntactical</u>
       <u>space</u> is necessary only when two integer arguments would clash or if the preceding argument ends  with  a
       string argument.

       <b>C</b> <u>id</u>⟨white-space⟩
              Typeset  the  glyph of the special character <u>id</u>.  Trailing syntactical space is necessary to allow
              special character names of arbitrary length.  The drawing position is not advanced.

       <b>c</b> <u>c</u>    Typeset the glyph of the ordinary character character <u>c</u>.  The drawing position is not advanced.

       <b>f</b> <u>n</u>    Select the font mounted at position <u>n</u>.  <u>n</u> cannot be negative.

       <b>H</b> <u>n</u>    Horizontally move the drawing position to <u>n</u> basic units from the left edge of the page.  <u>n</u>  cannot
              be negative.

       <b>h</b> <u>n</u>    Move  the drawing position right <u>n</u> basic units.  AT&amp;T <u>troff</u> allowed negative <u>n;</u> GNU <u>troff</u> does not
              produce such values, but <u>groff</u>'s output driver library handles them.

       <b>m</b> <u>scheme</u> [<u>component</u> ...]
              Select the stroke color using the <u>component</u>s in the color space  <u>scheme</u>.   Each  <u>component</u>  is  an
              integer between 0 and 65536.  The quantity of components and their meanings vary with each <u>scheme</u>.
              This command is a <u>groff</u> extension.

              <b>mc</b> <u>cyan</u> <u>magenta</u> <u>yellow</u>
                     Use the CMY color scheme with components cyan, magenta, and yellow.

              <b>md</b>     Use the default color (no components; black in most cases).

              <b>mg</b> <u>gray</u>
                     Use a grayscale color scheme with a component ranging between 0 (black) and 65536 (white).

              <b>mk</b> <u>cyan</u> <u>magenta</u> <u>yellow</u> <u>black</u>
                     Use the CMYK color scheme with components cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.

              <b>mr</b> <u>red</u> <u>green</u> <u>blue</u>
                     Use the RGB color scheme with components red, green, and blue.

       <b>N</b> <u>n</u>    Typeset  the  glyph  with index <u>n</u> in the current font.  <u>n</u> is normally a non-negative integer.  The
              drawing position is not advanced.  The <b>html</b> and <b>xhtml</b> devices use this command with negative <u>n</u>  to
              produce unbreakable space; the absolute value of <u>n</u> is taken and interpreted in basic units.

       <b>n</b> <u>b</u> <u>a</u>  Indicate  a  break.  No action is performed; the command is present to make the output more easily
              parsed.  The integers <u>b</u> and <u>a</u> describe the vertical space amounts  before  and  after  the  break,
              respectively.   GNU <u>troff</u> issues this command but <u>groff</u>'s output driver library ignores it.  See <b>v</b>
              and <b>V</b>.

       <b>p</b> <u>n</u>    Begin a new page, setting its number to <u>n</u>.  Each page is independent, even from  those  using  the
              same  number.   The  vertical drawing position is set to 0.  All positioning, writing, and drawing
              commands are interpreted in the context of a page, so a <b>p</b> command must precede them.

       <b>s</b> <u>n</u>    Set type size to <u>n</u> scaled points (unit <b>z</b> in GNU <u>troff</u>).   AT&amp;T  <u>troff</u>  used  unscaled  points  (<b>p</b>)
              instead; see section “Compatibility” below.

       <b>t</b> <u>xyz</u>...⟨white-space⟩
       <b>t</b> <u>xyz</u>... <u>dummy-arg</u>⟨white-space⟩
              Typeset  word  <u>xyz</u>; that is, set a sequence of ordinary glyphs named <u>x</u>, <u>y</u>, <u>z</u>, ..., terminated by a
              space or newline; an optional second integer argument is ignored (this  allows  the  formatter  to
              generate an even number of arguments).  Each glyph is set at the current drawing position, and the
              position  is  then  advanced  horizontally by the glyph's width.  A glyph's width is read from its
              metrics in the font description file, scaled to the current type size, and rounded to  a  multiple
              of the horizontal motion quantum.  Use the <b>C</b> command to emplace glyphs of special characters.  The
              <b>t</b>  command  is  a  <u>groff</u>  extension  and  is  output only for devices whose <u>DESC</u> file contains the
              <b>tcommand</b> directive; see <u><a href="../man5/groff_font.5.html">groff_font</a></u>(5).

       <b>u</b> <u>n</u> <u>xyz</u>...
       <b>u</b> <u>xyz</u>... <u>dummy-arg</u>⟨white-space⟩
              Typeset word <u>xyz</u> with track kerning.  As <b>t</b>, but after placing each glyph, the drawing position  is
              further  advanced horizontally by <u>n</u> basic units.  The <b>u</b> command is a <u>groff</u> extension and is output
              only for devices whose <u>DESC</u> file contains the <b>tcommand</b> directive; see <u><a href="../man5/groff_font.5.html">groff_font</a></u>(5).

       <b>V</b> <u>n</u>    Vertically move the drawing position to <u>n</u> basic units from the top edge of the page.  <u>n</u> cannot  be
              negative.

       <b>v</b> <u>n</u>    Move  the  drawing position down <u>n</u> basic units.  AT&amp;T <u>troff</u> allowed negative <u>n;</u> GNU <u>troff</u> does not
              produce such values, but <u>groff</u>'s output driver library handles them.

       <b>w</b>      Indicate an inter-word space.  No action is performed; the command is present to make  the  output
              more  easily  parsed.   Only  adjustable,  breakable  inter-word  spaces are thus described; those
              resulting from <b>\~</b> or horizontal motion escape sequences are not.  GNU <u>troff</u>  issues  this  command
              but <u>groff</u>'s output driver library ignores it.  See <b>h</b> and <b>H</b>.

   <b>Graphics</b> <b>commands</b>
       Each  graphics  or drawing command in the <u>intermediate</u> <u>output</u> starts with the letter <b>D</b> followed by one or
       two characters that specify a subcommand; this is followed by a  fixed  or  variable  number  of  integer
       arguments  that  are  separated  by a single space character.  A <b>D</b> command may not be followed by another
       command on the same line (apart from a comment), so each <b>D</b> command is terminated by  a  <u>syntactical</u>  <u>line</u>
       <u>break</u>.

       <u>troff</u>  output follows the classical spacing rules (no space between command and subcommand, all arguments
       are preceded by a single space character), but the parser  allows  optional  space  between  the  command
       letters and makes the space before the first argument optional.  As usual, each space can be any sequence
       of tab and space characters.

       Some  graphics  commands  can  take  a  variable  number  of  arguments.  In this case, they are integers
       representing a size measured in basic units <b>u</b>.  The <u>h</u> arguments  stand  for  horizontal  distances  where
       positive  means  right, negative left.  The <u>v</u> arguments stand for vertical distances where positive means
       down, negative up.  All these distances are offsets relative to the current location.

       Unless indicated otherwise, each graphics command directly corresponds  to  a  similar  <u>groff</u>  <b>\D</b>  escape
       sequence; see <u><a href="../man7/groff.7.html">groff</a></u>(7).

       Unknown  <b>D</b>  commands  are  assumed to be device-specific.  Its arguments are parsed as strings; the whole
       information is then sent to the postprocessor.

       In the following command reference, the syntax element <u>⟨line-break⟩</u> means a  <u>syntactical</u>  <u>line</u>  <u>break</u>  as
       defined in subsection “Separation” above.

       <b>D~</b> <u>h1</u> <u>v1</u> <u>h2</u> <u>v2</u> ... <u>hn</u> <u>vn</u>⟨line-break⟩
              Draw B-spline from current position to offset (<u>h1</u>, <u>v1</u>), then to offset (<u>h2</u>, <u>v2</u>) if given, etc., up
              to (<u>hn</u>, <u>vn</u>). This command takes a variable number of argument pairs; the current position is moved
              to the terminal point of the drawn curve.

       <b>Da</b> <u>h1</u> <u>v1</u> <u>h2</u> <u>v2</u>⟨line-break⟩
              Draw arc from current position to (<u>h1</u>, <u>v1</u>)+(<u>h2</u>, <u>v2</u>) with center at (<u>h1</u>, <u>v1</u>); then move the current
              position to the final point of the arc.

       <b>DC</b> <u>d</u>⟨line-break⟩
       <b>DC</b> <u>d</u> <u>dummy-arg</u>⟨line-break⟩
              Draw  a  solid circle using the current fill color with diameter <u>d</u> (integer in basic units <b>u</b>) with
              leftmost point at the current position; then move the current position to the rightmost  point  of
              the circle.  An optional second integer argument is ignored (this allows the formatter to generate
              an even number of arguments).  This command is a <u>groff</u> extension.

       <b>Dc</b> <u>d</u>⟨line-break⟩
              Draw  circle  line  with  diameter <u>d</u> (integer in basic units <b>u</b>) with leftmost point at the current
              position; then move the current position to the rightmost point of the circle.

       <b>DE</b> <u>h</u> <u>v</u>⟨line-break⟩
              Draw a solid ellipse in the current fill color with a horizontal diameter  of  <u>h</u>  and  a  vertical
              diameter  of  <u>v</u>  (both integers in basic units <b>u</b>) with the leftmost point at the current position;
              then move to the rightmost point of the ellipse.  This command is a <u>groff</u> extension.

       <b>De</b> <u>h</u> <u>v</u>⟨line-break⟩
              Draw an outlined ellipse with a horizontal diameter of <u>h</u>  and  a  vertical  diameter  of  <u>v</u>  (both
              integers in basic units <b>u</b>) with the leftmost point at current position; then move to the rightmost
              point of the ellipse.

       <b>DF</b> <u>color-scheme</u> [<u>component</u> ...]⟨line-break⟩
              Set  fill color for solid drawing objects using different color schemes; the analogous command for
              setting the color of text, line graphics, and the outline of graphic  objects  is  <b>m</b>.   The  color
              components are specified as integer arguments between 0 and 65536.  The number of color components
              and their meaning vary for the different color schemes.  These commands are generated by the <u>groff</u>
              escape  sequences <b>\D'F</b> ...<b>'</b>  and <b>\M</b> (with no other corresponding graphics commands).  This command
              is a <u>groff</u> extension.

              <b>DFc</b> <u>cyan</u> <u>magenta</u> <u>yellow</u>⟨line-break⟩
                     Set fill color for solid drawing objects using the CMY color scheme,  having  the  3  color
                     components cyan, magenta, and yellow.

              <b>DFd</b> ⟨line-break⟩
                     Set  fill  color  for  solid drawing objects to the default fill color value (black in most
                     cases).  No component arguments.

              <b>DFg</b> <u>gray</u>⟨line-break⟩
                     Set fill color for solid drawing objects to the shade of gray given  by  the  argument,  an
                     integer between 0 (black) and 65536 (white).

              <b>DFk</b> <u>cyan</u> <u>magenta</u> <u>yellow</u> <u>black</u>⟨line-break⟩
                     Set  fill  color  for solid drawing objects using the CMYK color scheme, having the 4 color
                     components cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.

              <b>DFr</b> <u>red</u> <u>green</u> <u>blue</u>⟨line-break⟩
                     Set fill color for solid drawing objects using the RGB color scheme,  having  the  3  color
                     components red, green, and blue.

       <b>Df</b> <u>n</u>⟨line-break⟩
              The argument <u>n</u> must be an integer in the range -32767 to 32767.

              0≤<u>n</u>≤1000
                     Set  the color for filling solid drawing objects to a shade of gray, where 0 corresponds to
                     solid white, 1000 (the default) to solid black,  and  values  in  between  to  intermediate
                     shades of gray; this is obsoleted by command <b>DFg</b>.

              <u>n</u>&lt;0 or <u>n</u>&gt;1000
                     Set  the  filling  color  to  the  color  that is currently being used for the text and the
                     outline, see command <b>m</b>.  For example, the command sequence

                            mg 0 0 65536
                            Df -1

                     sets all colors to blue.

              This command is a <u>groff</u> extension.

       <b>Dl</b> <u>h</u> <u>v</u>⟨line-break⟩
              Draw line from current position to offset (<u>h</u>, <u>v</u>) (integers in basic units  <b>u</b>);  then  set  current
              position to the end of the drawn line.

       <b>Dp</b> <u>h1</u> <u>v1</u> <u>h2</u> <u>v2</u> ... <u>hn</u> <u>vn</u>⟨line-break⟩
              Draw a polygon line from current position to offset (<u>h1</u>, <u>v1</u>), from there to offset (<u>h2</u>, <u>v2</u>), etc.,
              up  to offset (<u>hn</u>, <u>vn</u>), and from there back to the starting position.  For historical reasons, the
              position is changed by adding the sum of all arguments with odd index to  the  current  horizontal
              position  and the even ones to the vertical position.  Although this doesn't make sense it is kept
              for compatibility.  This command is a <u>groff</u> extension.

       <b>DP</b> <u>h1</u> <u>v1</u> <u>h2</u> <u>v2</u> ... <u>hn</u> <u>vn</u>⟨line-break⟩
              The same macro as the corresponding <b>Dp</b> command with the same arguments, but draws a solid  polygon
              in  the  current  fill color rather than an outlined polygon.  The position is changed in the same
              way as with <b>Dp</b>.  This command is a <u>groff</u> extension.

       <b>Dt</b> <u>n</u>⟨line-break⟩
              Set the current line thickness to <u>n</u> (an integer in basic units  <b>u</b>)  if  <u>n</u>&gt;0;  if  <u>n</u>=0  select  the
              smallest  available line thickness; otherwise, the line thickness is made proportional to the type
              size, which is the default.  For historical reasons, the horizontal position is changed by  adding
              the  argument  to  the  current  horizontal  position, while the vertical position is not changed.
              Although this doesn't make sense,  it  is  kept  for  compatibility.   This  command  is  a  <u>groff</u>
              extension.

   <b>Device</b> <b>control</b> <b>commands</b>
       Each device control command starts with the letter <b>x</b> followed by a space character (optional or arbitrary
       space/tab  in  <u>groff</u>)  and  a  subcommand  letter  or  word; each argument (if any) must be preceded by a
       <u>syntactical</u> <u>space</u>.  All <b>x</b> commands are terminated by a <u>syntactical</u> <u>line</u> <u>break</u>; no device control  command
       can be followed by another command on the same line (except a comment).

       The  subcommand  is  basically a single letter, but to increase readability, it can be written as a word,
       i.e., an arbitrary sequence of characters terminated by the next tab, space, or newline  character.   All
       characters  of  the  subcommand  word  but  the first are simply ignored.  For example, <u>troff</u> outputs the
       initialization command <b>x</b> <b>i</b> as <b>x</b> <b>init</b> and  the  resolution  command  <b>x</b> <b>r</b>  as  <b>x</b> <b>res</b>.   But  writings  like
       <b>x</b> <b>i_like_groff</b> and <b>x</b> <b>roff_is_groff</b> are accepted as well to mean the same commands.

       In the following, the syntax element <u>⟨line-break⟩</u> means a <u>syntactical</u> <u>line</u> <u>break</u> as defined in subsection
       “Separation” above.

       <b>xF</b> <u>name</u>⟨line-break⟩
              (<u>Filename</u> control command)
              Use  <u>name</u>  as  the  intended  name  for  the  current  file  in error reports.  This is useful for
              remembering the original file name when <u>groff</u> uses an internal piping mechanism.  The  input  file
              is not changed by this command.  This command is a <u>groff</u> extension.

       <b>xf</b> <u>n</u> <u>s</u>⟨line-break⟩
              (<u>font</u> control command)
              Mount font position <u>n</u> (a non-negative integer) with font named <u>s</u> (a text word); see <u><a href="../man5/groff_font.5.html">groff_font</a></u>(5).

       <b>xH</b> <u>n</u>⟨line-break⟩
              (<u>Height</u> control command)
              Set  character height to <u>n</u> (a positive integer in scaled points <b>z</b>).  <u>Classical</u> <u>troff</u> used the unit
              points (<b>p</b>) instead; see section “Compatibility” below.

       <b>xi</b> ⟨line-break⟩
              (<u>init</u> control command)
              Initialize device.  This is the third command of the <u>prologue</u>.

       <b>xp</b> ⟨line-break⟩
              (<u>pause</u> control command)
              Parsed but ignored.  The classical documentation reads <u>pause</u> <u>device,</u> <u>can</u> <u>be</u> <u>restarted</u>.

       <b>xr</b> <u>n</u> <u>h</u> <u>v</u>⟨line-break⟩
              (<u>resolution</u> control command)
              Resolution is <u>n</u>, while <u>h</u> is the minimal horizontal motion,  and  <u>v</u>  the  minimal  vertical  motion
              possible with this device; all arguments are positive integers in basic units <b>u</b> per inch.  This is
              the second command of the <u>prologue</u>.

       <b>xS</b> <u>n</u>⟨line-break⟩
              (<u>Slant</u> control command)
              Set slant to <u>n</u> degrees (an integer in basic units <b>u</b>).

       <b>xs</b> ⟨line-break⟩
              (<u>stop</u> control command)
              Terminates  the  processing  of  the  current file; issued as the last command of any <u>intermediate</u>
              <u>troff</u> <u>output</u>.

       <b>xt</b> ⟨line-break⟩
              (<u>trailer</u> control command)
              Generate trailer information, if any.  In <b>groff</b>, this is currently ignored.

       <b>xT</b> <u>xxx</u>⟨line-break⟩
              (<u>Typesetter</u> control command)
              Set the name of the output driver to <u>xxx</u>, a sequence of non-whitespace  characters  terminated  by
              whitespace.   The  possible  names  correspond  to  those of <u>groff</u>'s <b>-T</b> option.  This is the first
              command of the prologue.

       <b>xu</b> <u>n</u>⟨line-break⟩
              (<u>underline</u> control command)
              Configure underlining of spaces.  If <u>n</u> is 1,  start  underlining  of  spaces;  if  <u>n</u>  is  0,  stop
              underlining  of spaces.  This is needed for the <b>cu</b> request in <b>nroff</b> mode and is ignored otherwise.
              This command is a <u>groff</u> extension.

       <b>xX</b> <u>anything</u>⟨line-break⟩
              (<u>X-escape</u> control command)
              Send string <u>anything</u> uninterpreted to the device.  If the line following this command starts  with
              a  <b>+</b>  character  this line is interpreted as a continuation line in the following sense.  The <b>+</b> is
              ignored, but a newline character is sent instead to the device, the  rest  of  the  line  is  sent
              uninterpreted.  The same applies to all following lines until the first character of a line is not
              a  <b>+</b>  character.   This command is generated by the <u>groff</u> escape sequence <b>\X</b>.  The line-continuing
              feature is a <u>groff</u> extension.

   <b>Obsolete</b> <b>command</b>
       In <u>classical</u> <u>troff</u> output, emitting a single glyph was  mostly  done  by  a  very  strange  command  that
       combined  a  horizontal  move  and  the  printing  of  a  glyph.   It  didn't have a command code, but is
       represented by a 3-character argument consisting of exactly 2 digits and a character.

       <u>ddc</u>    Move right <u>dd</u> (exactly two decimal digits) basic units <b>u</b>,  then  print  glyph  with  single-letter
              name <u>c</u>.

              In <u>groff</u>, arbitrary <u>syntactical</u> <u>space</u> around and within this command is allowed to be added.  Only
              when  a  preceding  command on the same line ends with an argument of variable length a separating
              space is obligatory.  In <u>classical</u> <u>troff</u>, large clusters of these and other  commands  were  used,
              mostly without spaces; this made such output almost unreadable.

       For  modern high-resolution devices, this command does not make sense because the width of the glyphs can
       become much larger than two decimal digits.  In <u>groff</u>, it is used only for output  to  the  <b>X75</b>,  <b>X75-12</b>,
       <b>X100</b>,  and  <b>X100-12</b> devices.  For others, the commands <b>t</b> and <b>u</b> provide greater functionality and superior
       troubleshooting capacity.

</pre><h4><b>Postprocessing</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>roff</u> postprocessors are programs that have the task to translate the <u>intermediate</u> <u>output</u> into actions
       that are sent to a device.  A device can be some piece of hardware such as a printer, or a software  file
       format suitable for graphical or text processing.  The <u>groff</u> system provides powerful means that make the
       programming of such postprocessors an easy task.

       There is a library function that parses the <u>intermediate</u> <u>output</u> and sends the information obtained to the
       device  via  methods  of  a class with a common interface for each device.  So a <u>groff</u> postprocessor must
       only redefine the methods of this class.  For details, see the reference in section “Files” below.

</pre><h4><b>Example</b></h4><pre>
       This section presents the <u>intermediate</u> <u>output</u> generated from the same input for three different  devices.
       The input is the sentence <u>hell</u> <u>world</u> fed into <u>groff</u> on the command line.

       • High-resolution device <u>ps</u>

         shell&gt; <b>echo</b> <b>"hell</b> <b>world"</b> <b>|</b> <b>groff</b> <b>-Z</b> <b>-T</b> <b>ps</b>

         x T ps
         x res 72000 1 1
         x init
         p1
         x font 5 TR
         f5
         s10000
         V12000
         H72000

         n12000 0
         x trailer
         V792000
         x stop

       This output can be fed into the postprocessor <u><a href="../man1/grops.1.html">grops</a></u>(1) to get its representation as a PostScript file, or
       <u><a href="../man1/gropdf.1.html">gropdf</a></u>(1) to output directly to PDF.

       • Low-resolution device <u>latin1</u>

         This  is  similar  to  the high-resolution device except that the positioning is done at a minor scale.
         Some comments (lines starting with <u>#</u>) were added for clarification; they  were  not  generated  by  the
         formatter.

         <b>shell&gt;</b> "hell world" | groff -Z -T latin1

         <u>#</u> <u>prologue</u>
         x T latin1
         x res 240 24 40
         x init
         <u>#</u> <u>begin</u> <u>a</u> <u>new</u> <u>page</u>

         x font 1 R
         f1
         s10
         <u>#</u> <u>initial</u> <u>positioning</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>page</u>

         <u>#</u> <u>write</u> <u>text</u> <u>'hell'</u>
         thell
         <u>#</u> <u>inform</u> <u>about</u> <u>a</u> <u>space,</u> <u>and</u> <u>do</u> <u>it</u> <u>by</u> <u>a</u> <u>horizontal</u> <u>jump</u>
         wh24
         <u>#</u> <u>write</u> <u>text</u> <u>'world'</u>
         tworld
         <u>#</u> <u>announce</u> <u>line</u> <u>break,</u> <u>but</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing</u> <u>because</u> <u>...</u>
         n40 0
         <u>#</u> <u>...</u> <u>the</u> <u>end</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>document</u> <u>has</u> <u>been</u> <u>reached</u>
         x trailer
         V2640
         x stop

       This output can be fed into the postprocessor <u><a href="../man1/grotty.1.html">grotty</a></u>(1) to get a formatted text document.

       • Classical style output

         As a computer monitor has a very low resolution compared to modern printers the <u>intermediate</u> <u>output</u> for
         the X devices can use the jump-and-write command with its 2-digit displacements.

         <b>shell&gt;</b> "hell world" | groff -Z -T X100

         x T X100
         x res 100 1 1
         x init
         p1
         x font 5 TR
         f5
         s10
         V16
         H100
         <u>#</u> <u>write</u> <u>text</u> <u>with</u> <u>old-style</u> <u>jump-and-write</u> <u>command</u>
         ch07e07l03lw06w11o07r05l03dh7
         n16 0
         x trailer
         V1100
         x stop

       This output can be fed into the postprocessor <u><a href="../man1x/xditview.1x.html">xditview</a></u>(1x) or <u><a href="../man1/gxditview.1.html">gxditview</a></u>(1) for displaying in X.

       Due  to  the  obsolete  jump-and-write  command,  the  text  clusters  in the classical output are almost
       unreadable.

</pre><h4><b>Compatibility</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>intermediate</u> <u>output</u> language of the <u>classical</u> <u>troff</u> was first documented in [CSTR  #97].   The  <u>groff</u>
       <u>intermediate</u> <u>output</u> format is compatible with this specification except for the following features.

       • The classical quasi device independence is not yet implemented.

       • The  old  hardware  was  very  different  from  what  we  use  today.   So  the  <u>groff</u> devices are also
         fundamentally different from the ones in <u>classical</u> <u>troff</u>.  For example, the classical PostScript device
         was called <u>post</u> and had a resolution of 720 units per inch, while <u>groff</u>'s <u>ps</u> device has a resolution of
         72000 units per inch.  Maybe, by implementing some rescaling mechanism similar to the  classical  quasi
         device independence, these could be integrated into modern <u>groff</u>.

       • The  B-spline  command  <b>D~</b>  is  correctly  handled  by  the <u>intermediate</u> <u>output</u> parser, but the drawing
         routines aren't implemented in some of the postprocessor programs.

       • The argument of the commands <b>s</b> and <b>x</b> <b>H</b> has the implicit unit scaled point <b>z</b> in <u>groff</u>,  while  <u>classical</u>
         <u>troff</u>  had  point  (<b>p</b>).   This  isn't  an  incompatibility,  but a compatible extension, for both units
         coincide for all devices without a <u>sizescale</u> parameter, including all  classical  and  the  <u>groff</u>  text
         devices.   The few <u>groff</u> devices with a sizescale parameter either did not exist, had a different name,
         or seem to have had a different resolution.  So conflicts with classical devices are very unlikely.

       • The position changing after the commands <b>Dp</b>, <b>DP</b>, and <b>Dt</b> is illogical, but as old versions of groff used
         this feature it is kept for compatibility reasons.

       The differences between <u>groff</u> and <u>classical</u> <u>troff</u> are documented in <u><a href="../man7/groff_diff.7.html">groff_diff</a></u>(7).
