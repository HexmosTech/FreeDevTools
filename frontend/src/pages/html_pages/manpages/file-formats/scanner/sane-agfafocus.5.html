</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sane-agfafocus - SANE backend for AGFA Focus flatbed scanners

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-agfafocus</b>  library  implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
       AGFA Focus flatbed scanners. At present, the following scanners are supported from this backend:

              AGFA Focus GS Scanner (6 bit gray scale) (untested)
              AGFA Focus Lineart Scanner (lineart) (untested)
              AGFA Focus II (8 bit gray scale) (untested)
              AGFA Focus Color (24 bit color 3-pass)
              AGFA Focus Color Plus (24 bit color 3-pass)

              Siemens S9036 (8 bit gray scale) (untested)

       The driver supports line art, 6bpp and 8bpp gray, 18bpp and 24bpp color scans.

       If you own a scanner other than the ones listed above that works with this backend, please let us know by
       sending the scanner's model name, SCSI id, and firmware revision  to  <u><a href="mailto:sane-devel@alioth-lists.debian.net">sane-devel@alioth-lists.debian.net</a></u>.
       Have a look at <u><a href="http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html">http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html</a></u> concerning subscription to sane-devel.

       All of these scanners are pre-SCSI-2, and do not even report properly to SCSI Inquiry.  This is typically
       evident in SCSI bus scans, where the scanner will come up with only garbage as vendor and models strings.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              <u>special</u>

       where  <u>special</u>  is  the  path-name  for  the  special device that corresponds to a SCSI scanner. For SCSI
       scanners, the special device name must be a generic SCSI device or a symlink to  such  a  device.   Under
       Linux, such a device name could be <u>/dev/sga</u> or <u>/dev/sge</u>, for example.  See <b><a href="../man5/sane-scsi.5.html">sane-scsi</a></b>(5) for details.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The contents of the <u>agfafocus.conf</u> file is a list of device names that correspond to AGFA Focus scanners.
       Empty  lines  and  lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.  A sample configuration file is shown
       below:

              /dev/scanner
              # this is a comment
              /dev/sge

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/sane.d/agfafocus.conf</u>
              The backend configuration file (see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).

       <u>/usr/lib/libsane-agfafocus.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/libsane-agfafocus.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              This environment variable specifies the list of directories that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.   On  *NIX  systems,  the  directories  are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are
              separated by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file is  searched
              in  two  default  directories: first, the current working directory (".") and then in <u>/etc/sane.d</u>.
              If the value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separator  character,  then  the
              default directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting
              <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories <u>tmp/config</u>, <u>.</u>, and <u>/etc/sane.d</u> being
              searched (in this order).

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_AGFAFOCUS</b>
              If  the  library  was  compiled with debug support enabled, this environment variable controls the
              debug level for this backend. E.g., a value of 128  requests  all  debug  output  to  be  printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.  <b>SANE_DEBUG_AGFAFOCUS</b> values:

              Number  Remark
               0       print important errors (printed each time)
               1       print errors
               2       print sense
               3       print warnings
               4       print scanner-inquiry
               5       print information
               6       print less important information
               7       print called procedures
               8       print reader_process messages
               10      print called sane-init-routines
               11      print called sane-procedures
               12      print sane infos
               13      print sane option-control messages

</pre><h4><b>MISSING</b> <b>FUNCTIONALITY</b></h4><pre>
       Uploading  of dither matrices and tonecurves has been implemented, but so far has not proven to be useful
       for anything.  For this reason these options have been disabled.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The scanners that do not support disconnect have problems with SCSI timeouts if the SCSI bus gets loaded,
       eg. if you do a kernel build at the same time as scanning.  To see if your scanner  supports  disconnect,
       run <u>SANE_DEBUG_AGFAFOCUS=128</u> <u>scanimage</u> <u>-L</u> in a terminal and look for the "disconnect:" line.

</pre><h4><b>DEBUG</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  have  problems  with  SANE  not detecting your scanner, make sure the Artec backend is disabled.
       Somehow, this backend causes at least my scanner not to respond correctly to SCSI inquiry commands.

       If you encounter a bug please set the  environment  variable  <b>SANE_DEBUG_AGFAFOCUS</b>  to  128  and  try  to
       regenerate the problem. Then send me a report with the log attached.

       If  you  encounter  a  SCSI  bus error or trimmed and/or displaced images please also set the environment
       variable <b>SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_SCSI</b> to 128 before sending me the report.

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       <b>More</b> <b>scanners?</b>

              The AGFA ACS and ARCUS scanners are similar to the FOCUS scanners.  The driver could  probably  be
              extended  to  support  these  scanners  without  too  many  changes.  I do not have access to such
              scanners, and cannot add support for it.  However, if you are in possession of such a  scanner,  I
              could be helpful in adding support for these scanners.

              The  AGFA  HORIZON  scanners are SCSI-2 scanners, and it would probably be easier to support these
              scanners in a SCSI-2 compliant backend.
