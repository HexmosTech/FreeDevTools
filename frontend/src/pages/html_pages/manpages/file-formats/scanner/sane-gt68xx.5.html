</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sane-gt68xx - SANE backend for GT-68XX based USB flatbed scanners

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-gt68xx</b>  library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to USB
       flatbed scanners based on the Grandtech GT-6801 and GT-6816 chips.  A list of supported scanners  can  be
       found on the gt68xx backend homepage: <u><a href="http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/gt68xx-backend/">http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/gt68xx-backend/</a></u>.

       This  is  BETA software. Especially if you test new or untested scanners, keep your hand at the scanner's
       plug and unplug it, if the head bumps at the end of the scan area.

       If you own a scanner other than the ones listed on the gt68xx homepage  that  works  with  this  backend,
       please let me know this by sending the scanner's exact model name and the USB vendor and device ids (e.g.
       from  <b><a href="../man1/sane-find-scanner.1.html">sane-find-scanner</a></b>(1)  or  syslog) to me. Even if the scanner's name is only slightly different from
       the models already listed as supported, please let me know.

       If you own a scanner that isn't detected by the gt68xx backend but has a GT-6801 or GT-6816 chipset,  you
       can    try    to    add   it   to   the   backend.   Have   a   look   at   the   following   web   page:
       <u><a href="http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/gt68xx-backend/adding.html">http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/gt68xx-backend/adding.html</a></u>

</pre><h4><b>LIBUSB</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       Please use libusb-0.1.8 or later. Without libusb or with older libusb versions all kinds of  trouble  can
       be  expected.  The  scanner  should be found by <b><a href="../man1/sane-find-scanner.1.html">sane-find-scanner</a></b>(1) without further actions. For setting
       permissions and general USB information, look at <b><a href="../man5/sane-usb.5.html">sane-usb</a></b>(5).

</pre><h4><b>FIRMWARE</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       You need a firmware file for your scanner. That's a small file containing software that will be  uploaded
       to the scanner's memory. It's usually named *.usb, e.g.  <u>PS1fw.usb</u>.  It comes on the installation CD that
       was  provided  by  the  manufacturer, but it may be packaged together with the installation program in an
       .exe file. For Mustek scanners, the file can be downloaded from the gt68xx backend  homepage.  For  other
       scanners,  check  the  CD  for  .usb files. If you only find *.cab files, try <b><a href="../man1/cabextract.1.html">cabextract</a></b>(1) to unpack. If
       everything else fails, you must install the Windows driver and get the firmware from  there  (usually  in
       the  <u>windows/system</u>  or <u>system32</u> directories). Put that firmware file into <u>/usr/share/sane/gt68xx/</u>.  Make
       sure that it's readable by everyone.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The contents of the <u>gt68xx.conf</u> file is a list of usb  lines  containing  vendor  and  product  ids  that
       correspond  to USB scanners. The file can also contain option lines.  Empty lines and lines starting with
       a hash mark (#) are ignored.  The scanners are autodetected by <b>usb</b> <b>vendor_id</b> <b>product_id</b> statements  which
       are  already  included  into  <u>gt68xx.conf</u>.   "vendor_id"  and  "product_id"  are hexadecimal numbers that
       identify the scanner.

       The <b>override</b>, <b>firmware</b>, <b>vendor</b>, <b>model</b>, and <b>afe</b> options must be placed after the <b>usb</b> line they refer to.

       Option <b>override</b> is used to override the default model parameters. That's necessary for some scanners that
       use the same vendor/product ids but are different. For these scanners there  are  already  commented  out
       override  lines in the configuration file.  <b>override</b> <b>mustek-scanexpress-1200-ub-plus</b> is necessary for the
       Mustek Scanexpress 1200 UB Plus, the Medion/Lifetec/Tevion LT 9452, and the Trust Compact Scan USB 19200.
       <b>override</b> <b>artec-ultima-2000</b> is used for the Artec Ultima 2000, the  Boeder  SmartScan  Slim  Edition,  the
       Medion/  Lifetec/ Tevion/ Cytron MD/LT 9385, the Medion/ Lifetec/ Tevion MD 9458, and the Trust Flat Scan
       USB 19200.  <b>override</b> <b>mustek-bearpaw-2400-cu</b> is necessary for the Mustek BearPaw 2400 CU and  the  Fujitsu
       1200CUS. The <b>override</b> option must be the first one after the <b>usb</b> line.

       Option  <b>firmware</b>  selects  the name and path of the firmware file. It's only necessary if the default (or
       override) doesn't work. The default firmware directory  is  <u>/usr/share/sane/gt68xx/</u>.   You  may  need  to
       create this directory. If you want to place the firmware files at a different path, use a <b>firmware</b> line.

       The  <b>vendor</b>  and  <b>model</b> options are not absolutely necessary but for convenience. Quite a lot of scanners
       from different manufacturers share the same vendor/product ids so you can set the "correct" name here.

       The <b>afe</b> option allows one to set custom offset and gain values for the Analog FrontEnd  of  the  scanner.
       This  option  can be either used to select the AFE values if automatic coarse calibration is disabled, or
       to make automatic coarse calibration faster. For the latter usage, enable debug level 3 (see below), scan
       an image and look for debug line string with "afe". Copy this line to <u>gt68xx.conf</u>.  The  option  has  six
       parameters: red offset, red gain, green offset, green gain, blue offset, and blue gain.

       A sample configuration file is shown below:

              usb 0x05d8 0x4002
              override "mustek-scanexpress-1200-ub-plus"
              firmware "/opt/gt68xx/SBfw.usb"
              vendor "Trust"
              model "Compact Scan USB 19200"
              afe 0x20 0x02 0x22 0x03 0x1f 0x04

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/sane.d/gt68xx.conf</u>
              The backend configuration file (see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-gt68xx.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-gt68xx.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              This  environment  variable  specifies  the list of directories that may contain the configuration
              file.  On *NIX systems, the directories are separated by a  colon  (`:'),  under  OS/2,  they  are
              separated  by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file is searched
              in two default directories: first, the current working directory (".") and  then  in  <u>/etc/sane.d</u>.
              If  the  value  of  the environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then the
              default directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting
              <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories <u>tmp/config</u>, <u>.</u>, and <u>/etc/sane.d</u> being
              searched (in this order).

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_GT68XX</b>
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this  environment  variable  controls  the
              debug  level  for  this backend.  Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output. If the
              debug level is set to 1 or higher, some debug options become available that are  normally  hidden.
              Handle them with care.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_GT68XX=4

       The original gt68xx driver was written by Sergey Vlasov, Andreas Nowack, and David Stevenson. Thanks  for
       sending patches and answering questions to them and all the other contributors.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The first few lines of the image are garbage for the 2400 TA Plus.

       Interpolation should be used instead of just copying data, when the X- and Y-resolution differ.

       Support for buttons is missing.

       More     detailed     bug    information    is    available    at    the    gt68xx    backend    homepage
       <u><a href="http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/gt68xx-backend/">http://www.meier-geinitz.de/sane/gt68xx-backend/</a></u>.
