       sane-sp15c - SANE backend for Fujitsu ScanPartner 15C flatbed scanner

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-sp15c</b>  library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend which provides access to the
       Fujitsu flatbed scanners.  At present, the following scanner is known to work with these backend:

              Vendor:  Model:           Rev:
              -------- ---------------- -----
              FCPA     ScanPartner 15C  1.01

       The ScanPartner 15C driver supports lineart (1-bit), halftone (1-bit), grayscale (4-bit and  8-bit),  and
       color (3 x 8-bit) scanning.

       Other  scanners  in  these  families  may  work.   The  ScanPartner  15C seems to be a repackaging of the
       ScanPartner 600C.  People are encouraged to try these driver with the other scanners and to  contact  the
       author with test results.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       A  modest  effort has been made to expose the standard options to the API.  This allows frontends such as
       <b><a href="../man1/xscanimage.1.html">xscanimage</a></b>(1) to set scanning region,  resolution,  bit-depth  (and  color),  and  enable  the  automatic
       document feeder.

       Randolph Bentson &lt;<u><a href="mailto:bentson@holmsjoen.com">bentson@holmsjoen.com</a></u>&gt;, with credit to the unnamed author of the coolscan driver

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Testing limited to a Linux 2.2.5 kernel
       Can't  quite get the scan page/minute performance in ADF modes.  This may be due to limited system buffer
       size.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       I'm sure there are plenty, and not too well hidden, but I haven't seen them yet.
       Both scanners claim to have separate control of resolution in X and Y directions.  I  confess  I  haven't
       tested this yet.  I have found that <b><a href="../man1/xsane.1.html">xsane</a></b>(1) doesn't even display this capability.
       Threshold settings on the SP15C don't seem to affect the results of lineart mode scans.
       It  might  be  possible to merge these two drivers without much effort since the SP15C driver was derived
       from the M3096G driver.  They were split so as to keep the second driver development  from  breaking  the
       working first driver.  Watch this space for changes.
