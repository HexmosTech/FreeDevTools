</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sane-mustek_pp - SANE backend for Mustek parallel port flatbed scanners

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-mustek_pp</b>  library  implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
       Mustek parallel port flatbed scanners and OEM versions.

       There are 2 classes of Mustek parallel port scanners: regular <b>CCD</b> (cold cathode device) scanners and  <b>CIS</b>
       (contact image sensor) scanners.

       The current version of this backend supports both CCD type scanners and CIS type scanners.

       The following scanners might work with this backend:

       (*)    Calibration  problems existed with earlier version of this driver. They seem to be solved now.

       (**)    Problems  have  been  reported  in the past for the MD/LT9850 type (striped scans, head moving in
              wrong direction at some resolutions). It is not known whether the current version  of  the  driver
              still has these problems.

       <b>IF</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>HEAR</b> <b>LOUD</b> <b>CLICKING</b> <b>NOISES,</b> <b>IMMEDIATELY</b> <b>UNPLUG</b> <b>THE</b> <b>SCANNER</b> <b>!</b>  (This holds for any type of scanner).

       (***)  Possibly, the engine_delay parameter has to be set to 1 ms for accurate engine movements.

       Please note that this backend is still under construction. Certain models are currently not supported and
       some may never be because the communication protocol is still unknown (eg., SE 12000 P).

       Some scanners work faster when <b>EPP/ECP</b> is enabled in the BIOS. EPP mode however may lead to hard-locks on
       some  Linux  systems. If that is the case for you, you can either disable ECP/EPP in your BIOS or disable
       it in the backend itself (see GLOBAL OPTIONS).

       Note that the backend needs to run as root or has to have appropriate access rights to  <u>/dev/parport*</u>  if
       libieee1284  support  is  compiled  in.  To  allow user access to the scanner run the backend through the
       network interface (see <b><a href="../man8/saned.8.html">saned</a></b>(8) and <b><a href="../man5/sane-net.5.html">sane-net</a></b>(5)).  Note also that the backend <u>does</u>  <u>not</u>  support  <u>parport</u>
       <u>sharing</u>, i.e. if you try printing while scanning, your computer may crash. To enable parport sharing, you
       have  to  enable  <b><a href="../man3/libieee1284.3.html">libieee1284</a></b>(3)  at compile time.  You may also have to enable the backend explicitly in
       your <u>dll.conf</u>.  Just remove the hash mark in the line "mustek_pp".

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>DEFINITION</b></h4><pre>
       This backend allows multiple devices being defined and  configured  via  the  <u>mustek_pp.conf</u>  file  (even
       simultaneously,  provided  that they are connected to different parallel ports). Please make sure to edit
       this file <b>before</b> you use the backend.

       A device can be defined as follows:

              <u>scanner</u> <u>&lt;name&gt;</u> <u>&lt;port</u> <u>name&gt;</u> <u>&lt;driver&gt;</u>

       where

       <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> is an arbitrary name for the device, optionally enclosed by double quotes, for  instance  "LifeTec
              9350".

       <b>&lt;port</b>  <b>name&gt;</b>  is  the  name of the parallel port to which the device is connected. In case libieee1284 is
              used for communication with the port <u>(default</u> <u>setup)</u>, valid port names are <b>parport0</b>, <b>parport1</b>, and
              <b>parport2</b>.

       In case the backend is configured for raw IO <u>(old</u> <u>setup)</u>, port addresses have to be used instead of  port
       names:  <b>0x378</b>, <b>0x278</b>, or <b>0x3BC</b>.  The mapping of parallel ports (lp0, lp1, and lp2) to these addresses can
       be different for different Linux kernel versions. For instance, if you are using a Kernel 2.2.x or better
       and you have only one parallel port, this port is named lp0 regardless of the base address. However, this
       backend requires the base address of your port. If you are not sure which port your scanner is  connected
       to, have a look at your <u>/etc/conf.modules</u>, <u>/etc/modules.conf</u> and/or <u><a href="file:/proc/ioports">/proc/ioports</a></u>.

       If you are unsure which port to use, you can use the magic value <b>*</b> to probe for your scanner.

       <b>&lt;driver&gt;</b> is the driver to use for this device. Currently available drivers are:

              <b>cis600</b>   : for 600 CP, 96 CP &amp; OEM versions
              <b>cis1200</b>  : for 1200 CP &amp; OEM versions
              <b>cis1200+</b> : for 1200 CP+ &amp; OEM versions
              <b>ccd300</b>   : for 600 IIIE P &amp; OEM version

              <b>Choosing</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>driver</b> <b>can</b> <b>damage</b> <b>your</b> <b>scanner!</b>
              Especially,  using  the  1200CP settings on a 600CP can be harmful. If the scanner starts making a
              loud noise, turn it off immediately !!!

       Using the cis600 driver on a 1200CP or a 1200CP+ is probably not  dangerous.  The  cis1200+  driver  also
       works for the 1200CP, and using the cis1200 driver on a 1200CP+ will typically result in scans that cover
       only half of the width of the scan area (also not dangerous).

       If unsure about the exact model of your OEM version, check the optical resolution in the manual or on the
       box:  the  600CP  has  a maximum optical resolution of 300x600 DPI, whereas the 1200CP and 1200CP+ have a
       maximum optical resolution of 600x1200 DPI.

       Examples:

              scanner "LifeTec 9350" 0x378 cis1200

              scanner Mustek_600CP 0x378 cis600

              scanner Mustek_600IIIEP * ccd300

       If in doubt which port you have to use, or  whether  your  scanner  is  detected  at  all,  you  can  use
       <u>sane-find-scanner</u> <u>-p</u> to probe all configured ports.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  contents  of  the  <u>mustek_pp.conf</u>  file  is  a  list  of  device definitions and device options that
       correspond to Mustek scanners.  Empty lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.  Options
       have the following format:

              <u>option</u> <u>&lt;name&gt;</u> <u>[&lt;value&gt;]</u>

       Depending  on  the  nature of the option, a value may or may not be present.  Options always apply to the
       scanner definition that precedes them. There are no global options. Options are also driver-specific: not
       all drivers support all possible options.

   <b>Common</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>bw</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Black/white discrimination value to be used during lineart scanning. Pixel values below this value
              are assumed to be black, values above are assumed to be white.
              Default value: 127
              Minimum:         0
              Maximum:       255

              Example:  option bw 150

   <b>CIS</b> <b>driver</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>top_adjust</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Vertical adjustment of the origin, expressed in millimeter (floating point).  This option  can  be
              used  to  calibrate  the position of the origin, within certain limits. Note that CIS scanners are
              probably temperature sensitive, and that a certain inaccuracy may be hard to avoid. Differences in
              offset between runs in the order of 1 to 2 mm are not unusual.
              Default value: 0.0
              Minimum:      -5.0
              Maximum:       5.0

              Example:  option top_adjust -2.5

       <b>slow_skip</b>
              Turns fast skipping to the start of the scan region off. When the region to scan does not start at
              the origin, the driver will try to move the scanhead to the start of the scan area at the  fastest
              possible  speed.  On  some  models,  this  may  not  work,  resulting in large inaccuracies (up to
              centimeters).  By setting this option, the driver is forced to use normal speed  during  skipping,
              which  can  circumvent  the  accuracy  problems.  Currently,  there  are no models for which these
              inaccuracy problems are known to occur.

              By default, fast skipping is used.

              Example:  option slow_skip

       <b>engine_delay</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Under normal circumstances, it is sufficient for the driver to wait for the scanner signaling that
              the engine is stable, before a new engine command can  be  transmitted.  In  rare  cases,  certain
              scanners  and/or  parallel port chipsets appear to prevent reliable detection of the engine state.
              As a result, engine commands are transmitted too soon and the movement of the scanner head becomes
              unreliable. Inaccuracies ranging up to 10  cm  over  the  whole  vertical  scan  range  have  been
              reported.  To  work  around  this  problem,  the engine_delay option can be set. If it is set, the
              driver waits an additional amount of time after every engine command, equal  to  the  engine_delay
              parameter,  expressed  in milliseconds. It practice an engine_delay of 1 ms is usually sufficient.
              The maximum delay is 100 ms.

              Note that every additional ms of delay can add up  to  14  seconds  to  the  total  scanning  time
              (highest resolution), so an as small as possible value is preferred.

              Default value:   0
              Minimum:         0
              Maximum:       100

              Example:  option engine_delay 1

   <b>CCD</b> <b>driver</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>top</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              Number of scanlines to skip to the start of the scan area. The number can be any positive integer.
              Values known to me are 47 and 56.

              Default value: 47
              Minimum:       0
              Maximum:       none

              Example:  option top 56

       <b>waitbank</b> <b>&lt;value&gt;</b>
              The  number  of  usecs to wait for a bank change. You should not touch this value actually. May be
              any positive integer

              Default value: 700
              Minimum:       0
              Maximum:       none

              Example:  option waitbank 700

       A sample configuration file is shown below:

       #
       # LifeTec/Medion 9350 on port 0x378
       #
       scanner "LifeTec 9350" 0x378 cis1200

       # Some calibration options (examples!).
       option bw 127
       option top_skip -0.8

       #
       # A Mustek 600CP on port 0x3BC
       #
       scanner "Mustek 600CP" 0x3BC cis600

       # Some calibration options (examples!).
       option bw 120
       option top_skip 1.2

       #
       # A Mustek 1200CP+ on port 0x278
       #
       scanner "Mustek 1200CP plus" 0x278 cis1200+

       # Some calibration options (examples!).
       option bw 130
       option top_skip 0.2

       #
       # A Mustek 600 III EPP on port parport0
       #
       scanner "Mustek 600 III EPP" parport0 ccd300

       # Some calibration options (examples!).
       option bw 130
       option top 56

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       You can control the overall behaviour of the <b>sane-stek_pp</b> backend by global  options  which  precede  any
       scanner definition in the <u>mustek_pp.conf</u> file.

       Currently, there is only one global option:

   <b>Global</b> <b>options</b>
       <b>no_epp</b> Disable  parallel  port  mode EPP: works around a known bug in the Linux parport code. Enable this
              option, if the backend hangs when trying to access the parallel port in EPP mode.

              Default value: use EPP

              Example:  option no_epp

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/sane.d/mustek_pp.conf</u>
              The backend configuration file (see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-mustek_pp.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-mustek_pp.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              This environment variable specifies the list of directories that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.   On  *NIX  systems,  the  directories  are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are
              separated by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file is  searched
              in  two  default  directories: first, the current working directory (".") and then in <u>/etc/sane.d</u>.
              If the value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separator  character,  then  the
              default directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting
              <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories <u>tmp/config</u>, <u>.</u>, and <u>/etc/sane.d</u> being
              searched (in this order).

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_PP</b>
              If  the  library  was  compiled with debug support enabled, this environment variable controls the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 128 requests  all  debug  output  to  be  printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

              level   debug output
              --------------------------------------
               0      nothing
               1      errors
               2      warnings &amp; minor errors
               3      additional information
               4      debug information
               5      code flow (not supported yet)
               6      special debug information

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_SANEI_PA4S2</b>
              This  variable  sets the debug level for the SANE interface for the Mustek chipset A4S2. Note that
              enabling this will spam your terminal with some million lines of debug output.

              level   debug output
              ----------------------------
               0      nothing
               1      errors
               2      warnings
               3      things nice to know

</pre><h4><b>BUG</b> <b>REPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       If something doesn't work, please contact us (Jochen for the CCD scanners, Eddy for  the  CIS  scanners).
       But we need some information about your scanner to be able to help you...

       <u>SANE</u> <u>version</u>
              Run <u>scanimage</u> <u>-V</u> to determine this.

       <u>the</u> <u>backend</u> <u>version</u> <u>and</u> <u>your</u> <u>scanner</u> <u>hardware</u>
              Run  <u>SANE_DEBUG_MUSTEK_PP=128</u>  <u>scanimage</u>  <u>-L</u>  as  root.  If  you  don't  get  any  output from the
              <b>sane-mustek_pp</b> backend, make sure a line "mustek_pp" is included into  your  <u>/etc/sane.d/dll.conf</u>.
              If  your  scanner  isn't  detected,  make  sure  you've  defined  the  right  port address in your
              <u>mustek_pp.conf</u>.

       <u>the</u> <u>name</u> <u>of</u> <u>your</u> <u>scanner/vendor</u> <u>also</u> <u>a</u> <u>worthy</u> <u>information.</u> <u>Please</u> <u>also</u> <u>include</u> <u>the</u>
              optical resolution and lamp type of your scanner, both can be found in the manual of your scanner.

       <u>any</u> <u>further</u> <u>comments</u>
              if you have comments about the documentation (what could be done better), or you  think  I  should
              know something, please include it.
