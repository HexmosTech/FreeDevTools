</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sane-epson2 - SANE backend for EPSON scanners

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>sane-epson2</b> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to Epson
       flatbed  scanners.   This  library  supports  a  similar set of scanners as the sane-epson driver but was
       developed to support a wider range of connections to the scanner; include network access.

       Because <b>sane-epson</b> and <b>sane-epson2</b> drivers support many of the same devices,  if  one  driver  gives  you
       problems  you  may  try disabling it to try the other.  This can be done by removing the driver name from
       the <u>dll.conf</u> or perhaps by commenting out the options in <u>epson.conf</u> or <u>epson2.conf.</u>

       At present, the following scanners are known to work with this backend:

       For other scanners the software  may or may not work.  Please send mail to the sane-backend mailing  list
       to report success with scanners not on the list or problems with scanners that are listed.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  options  the  backend  supports can either be selected through command line options to programs like
       <b><a href="../man1/scanimage.1.html">scanimage</a></b>(1) or through GUI elements in programs like <b><a href="../man1/xscanimage.1.html">xscanimage</a></b>(1) or <b><a href="../man1/xsane.1.html">xsane</a></b>(1).

       Valid command line options and their syntax can be listed by using

              scanimage --help -d epson2

       Not all devices support all options.

       <u>Scan</u> <u>Mode</u>
              The <b>--mode</b> switch selects the basic mode of operation of the scanner. Valid  choices  are  Binary,
              Gray  and Color.  The Binary mode is black and white only, Gray will produce 256 levels of gray or
              more depending on the scanner and Color means 24 bit color mode or more depending on the  scanner.
              Some  scanners will internally use 36 bit color, their external interface however may only support
              24 bits.

              The <b>--depth</b> option selects the bit depth the scanner is using. This option is only  available  for
              scanners  that  support  more than one bit depth. Older scanners will always transfer the image in
              8bit mode. Newer scanners allow one to select either 8 bits, 12 or 14 bits per color channel.  For
              a  color  scan  this  means an effective color depth of 36 or 42 bits over all three channels. The
              valid choices depend on the scanner model.

              The <b>--halftoning</b> switch selects the mode that is used in Binary mode. Valid  options  are  "None",
              "Halftone  A  (Hard  Tone)",  "Halftone  B (Soft Tone)", "Halftone C (Net Screen)", "Dither A (4x4
              Bayer)", "Dither B (4x4 Spiral)", "Dither C (4x4 Net Screen)", "Dither D (8x4 Net Screen)",  "Text
              Enhanced Technology", "Download pattern A", and "Download pattern B".

              The  <b>--dropout</b>  switch selects the so called dropout color. Valid options are None, Red, Green and
              Blue. The default is None. The dropout color is used for monochrome scanning and selects the color
              that is not scanned. This can be used to e.g. scan an original with a colored background.

              The <b>--brightness</b> switch controls the brightness of the scan. Valid options are integer values from
              -3 to 3. The default is 0. The larger the brightness value, the brighter the image gets. If a user
              defined table for the gamma correction is selected, the brightness parameter is not available.

              The <b>--sharpness</b> switch sets the sharpness of the image data. Valid options are integer values from
              -2 to 2, with -2 meaning "Defocus", -1 "Defocus slightly", 0 "Normal", 1 "Sharpen slightly" and  2
              "Sharpen".

              The  <b>--gamma-correction</b> switch controls the scanner's internal gamma correction. Valid options are
              "Default", "User defined", "High density printing"  "Low  density  printing"  and  "High  contrast
              printing".

              The  <b>--color-correction</b>  switch  controls  the scanner's internal color correction function. Valid
              options are "No Correction", "Impact-dot printers", "Thermal  printers",  "Ink-jet  printers"  and
              "CRT monitors". The default is "CRT monitors".

              The  <b>--resolution</b>  switch  selects the resolution for a scan. Some EPSON scanners will scan in any
              resolution between the lowest and highest possible value. The list reported by the scanner can  be
              displayed using the "--help -d epson" parameters to <b><a href="../man1/scanimage.1.html">scanimage</a></b>(1).

              The <b>--threshold</b> switch selects the minimum brightness to get a white point.

              The <b>--mirror</b> option controls the way the image is scanned. By reading the image data from right to
              left the image is mirrored. Valid options are "yes" and "no". The default is "no".

              The  <b>--auto-area-segmentation</b>  switch  activates  the  automatic  area segmentation for monochrome
              scans. The scanner will try to determine which areas are text and which contain images. The  image
              areas  will  be  halftoned,  and  the text will be improved. Valid options are "yes" and "no". The
              default is "yes".

              The <b>--red-gamma-table</b> parameter can be used to download a user defined gamma  table  for  the  red
              channel. The valid options are the same as for --gamma-table.

              The <b>--green-gamma-table</b> parameter can be used to download a user defined gamma table for the green
              channel. The valid options are the same as for --gamma-table.

              The  <b>--blue-gamma-table</b>  parameter can be used to download a user defined gamma table for the blue
              channel. The valid options are the same as for --gamma-table.

              The <b>--wait-for-button</b> parameter can be used to wait until the button on the scanner is pressed  to
              actually start the scan process.

              The  color  correction  coefficients  <b>--cct-1</b>  <b>--cct-2</b>  <b>--cct-3</b>  <b>...</b>  <b>--cct-9</b>  will  install color
              correction coefficients for the user defined color correction. Values are specified as integers in
              the range -127..127.

              The <b>--preview</b> option requests a preview scan. The frontend software automatically  selects  a  low
              resolution. Valid options are "yes" and "no". The default is "no".

              The  geometry options <b>-l</b> <b>-t</b> <b>-x</b> <b>-y</b> control the scan area: <b>-l</b> sets the top left x coordinate, <b>-t</b> the
              top left y coordinate, <b>-x</b> selects the width and <b>-y</b> the height of the scan area. All parameters are
              specified in millimeters.

              The <b>--source</b> option selects the scan source. Valid options depend on the  installed  options.  The
              default is "Flatbed".

              The <b>--auto-eject</b> option will eject a page after scanning from the document feeder.

              The <b>--film-type</b> option will select the film type for scans with the transparency unit. This option
              is  only  activated  if  the TPU is selected as scan source. Valid options are "Negative Film" and
              "Positive Film".

              The <b>--focus-position</b> option selects the focus position for all scans.  Valid  options  are  "Focus
              2.5mm above glass" and "Focus on glass". The focus on the 2.5mm point above the glass is necessary
              for scans with the transparency unit, so that the scanner can focus on the film if one of the film
              holders  is  used.   This option is only functional for selected scanners, all other scanners will
              ignore this option.

              The <b>--bay</b> option selects which bay to scan.

              The <b>--eject</b> option ejects the sheet in the ADF.

              The <b>--adf-mode</b> option select the ADF mode (simplex/duplex).

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration file <u>/etc/sane.d/epson2.conf</u>  specifies  the  device(s)  that  the  backend  will  use.
       Possible connection types are:

       <b>SCSI</b>   This  is the default, and if nothing else is specified the backend software will open a given path
              as SCSI device. More information about valid syntax for SCSI devices can be found in <b><a href="../man5/sane-scsi.5.html">sane-scsi</a></b>(5).
              Usually SCSI scanners are configured with a line "scsi EPSON" in this file. In some cases  it  may
              be necessary to only use the string "scsi" (e.g. for the GT-6500).

       <b>PIO</b> <b>-</b> <b>Parallel</b> <b>Interface</b>
              The  parallel  interface can be configured in two ways: An integer value starting at the beginning
              of a line will be interpreted as the IO address of the parallel port. To make it  clearer  that  a
              configured IO address is a parallel port the port address can be preceded by the string "PIO". The
              PIO  connection  does  not  use a special device file in the <u><a href="file:/dev">/dev</a></u> directory. The IO address can be
              specified in hex mode (prefixed with "0x").

       <b>USB</b>    For USB scanners not automatically detect, their VENDOR and PRODUCT ID can be  specified  manually
              in  the  config  file.   More  information  about  valid  syntax  for  USB devices can be found in
              <b><a href="../man5/sane-usb.5.html">sane-usb</a></b>(5).

       <b>Network</b>
              Network scanners can be auto-discovered if <b>autodiscovery</b> is specified after <b>net</b>  keyword.   An  IP
              address to connect to can also be used.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-epson2.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-epson2.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_DEBUG_EPSON2</b>
              If  the  library  was  compiled with debug support enabled, this environment variable controls the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 128 requests  all  debug  output  to  be  printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_EPSON2_SCSI</b>
              If  the  library  was  compiled with debug support enabled, this environment variable controls the
              SCSI related debug level for this backend.  Only a value of 2 is supported.

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_EPSON2_NET</b>
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this  environment  variable  controls  the
              network  related  debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 128 requests all debug output to
              be printed.  Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

       <b>SANE_EPSON2_CMD_LVL</b>
              This allows one to override the function or command level that the  backend  uses  to  communicate
              with the scanner. The function level a scanner supports is determined during the initialization of
              the  device.  If the backend does not recognize the function level reported by the scanner it will
              default to function level B3. Valid function levels are A1, A2, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, D1
              and F5. Use this feature only if you know what you are doing!

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man5/sane-scsi.5.html">sane-scsi</a></b>(5), <b><a href="../man5/sane-usb.5.html">sane-usb</a></b>(5), <b><a href="../man1/scanimage.1.html">scanimage</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/xscanimage.1.html">xscanimage</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/xsane.1.html">xsane</a></b>(1)

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       None :-) At least none are currently known.

</pre><h4><b>UNSUPPORTED</b> <b>DEVICES</b></h4><pre>
       The backend may be used with Epson scanners that are not yet listed under the list of supported  devices.
       A scanner that is not recognized may default to the function level B3, which means that not all functions
       that the scanner may be capable of are accessible.

       If  the  scanner  is  not  even  recognized  as an Epson scanner this is probably because the device name
       reported by the scanner is not in the correct  format.  Please  send  this  information  to  the  backend
       maintainer  (email  address  is in the AUTHOR section of this man page or in the AUTHORS file of the SANE
       distribution).

</pre><h4><b>AUTHOR</b></h4><pre>
       The package is written by Alessandro Zummo and is based on previous work done by Karl Hienz Kremer in the
       epson package as well as based on work by Christian Bucher and Kazuhiro Sasayama.
