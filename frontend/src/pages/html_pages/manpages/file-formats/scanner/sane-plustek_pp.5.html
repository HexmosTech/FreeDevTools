       sane-plustek_pp - SANE backend for Plustek parallel port flatbed scanners

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-plustek_pp</b>  library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
       Plustek ASIC 9600[1/3] and P9800[1/3] based parallel port flatbed scanners.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>DEVICES</b></h4><pre>
       At present, the following scanners should work with this backend:

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       This backend's default device is:

              <u>0x378</u>

       This "default device" will be used if no configuration file can be found. It is the base address  of  the
       parallel port on i386 machines.

       As the backend supports up to four devices, it is possible to specify them in the configuration file

              <u>/etc/sane.d/plustek_pp.conf</u>

       See this file for examples.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       This   section   describes   the   backend's  configuration  file  entries.   The  file  is  located  at:
       <u>/etc/sane.d/plustek_pp.conf</u>

       For a proper setup, you will need at least two entries:

              <u>[direct]</u>
              <u>device</u> <u>0x378</u>

       <u>direct</u> tells the backend, that the following devicename (here <u>0x378</u>) has to be  interpreted  as  parallel
       port  scanner  device.  In  fact it is the address to use. Alternatively you can use <u>/dev/parport0</u> if the
       backend has been compiled with libieee1284 support.

       Further options:

       option warmup t
              <u>t</u> specifies the warmup period in seconds

       option lampOff t
              <u>t</u> is the time in seconds for switching off the lamps in standby mode

       option lOffonEnd b
              <u>b</u> specifies the behaviour when closing the backend, 1 --&gt; switch lamps off, 0 --&gt;  do  not  change
              lamp status

       option mov m
              <u>m</u> is the model override switch, which only works in direct mode.

              <u>m</u> = 0  default: no override

              <u>m</u> = 1  OpticPro 9630PL override (works if OP9630 has been detected) forces legal size (14")

              <u>m</u> = 2  Primax 4800Direct override (works if OP600 has been detected) swaps red/green color

              <u>m</u> = 3  OpticPro   9636   override   (works   if   OP9636  has  been  detected)  disables  backends
                     transparency/negative capabilities

              <u>m</u> = 4  OpticPro  9636P  override  (works  if  OP9636  has   been   detected)   disables   backends
                     transparency/negative capabilities

              <u>m</u> = 5  OpticPro A3I override (works if OP12000 has been detected) enables A3 scanning

              <u>m</u> = 6  OpticPro 4800P override (works if OP600 has been detected) swaps red/green color

              <u>m</u> = 7  Primax 4800Direct 30bit override (works if OP4830 has been detected)

       See the <u>plustek_pp.conf</u> file for examples.

</pre><h4><b>PARALLEL</b> <b>PORT</b> <b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
       The  current driver works best, when the parallel port has been set to EPP-mode. When detecting any other
       mode such as ECP or PS/2 the driver tries to set to a faster, supported mode. If this fails, it will  use
       the  SPP  mode, as this mode should work with all Linux supported parallel ports. If in doubt, enter your
       BIOS and set it to any mode except ECP.

       Former Plustek scanner models (4830, 9630) supplied a ISA parallel port adapter card. This  card  is  <b>not</b>
       supported by the driver.

       The  ASIC  96001/3  based  models  have  sometimes  trouble  with high resolution modes. If you encounter
       sporadic corrupted images (parts duplicated or shifted horizontally) kill all other  applications  before
       scanning and (if sufficient memory available) disable swapping.

       See the <u>plustek_pp.conf</u> file for examples.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/sane.d/plustek_pp.conf</u>
              The backend configuration file

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-plustek_pp.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-plustek_pp.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              This  environment  variable  specifies  the list of directories that may contain the configuration
              file.  On *NIX systems, the directories are separated by a  colon  (`:'),  under  OS/2,  they  are
              separated  by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file is searched
              in two default directories: first, the current working directory (".") and  then  in  <u>/etc/sane.d</u>.
              If  the  value  of  the environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then the
              default directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting
              <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories <u>tmp/config</u>, <u>.</u>, and <u>/etc/sane.d</u> being
              searched (in this order).

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_PLUSTEK_PP</b>
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this  environment  variable  controls  the
              debug level for this backend.  Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_PLUSTEK_PP=10

</pre><h4><b>CONTACT</b> <b>AND</b> <b>BUG-REPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       Please send any information and bug-reports to:
       <b>SANE</b> <b>Mailing</b> <b>List</b>

       Additional    info    and    hints    can    be    obtained    from    our   mailing-List   archive   at:
       <u><a href="http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html">http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html</a></u>.

       To obtain debug messages from the backend,  please  set  the  environment-variable  <b>SANE_DEBUG_PLUSTEK_PP</b>
       before calling your favorite SANE frontend (e.g.  <b><a href="../man1/xscanimage.1.html">xscanimage</a></b>(1)):

       <u>export</u> <u>SANE_DEBUG_PLUSTEK_PP=20</u> <u>;</u> <u>xscanimage</u>

       The value controls the verbosity of the output.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>BUGS</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>RESTRICTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       * The Halftoning works, but the quality is poor

       * Printers (especially HP models) will start to print during scanning. This in fact is a problem to other
       printers too, using bidirectional protocol (see www.plustek.com (TAIWAN) page for further details)

       *  The  driver  does  not  support  these manic scalings up to 16 times the physical resolution. The only
       scaling is done on resolutions between the physical resolution of the CCD-sensor and  the  stepper  motor
       i.e.  you have a 600x1200 dpi scanner and you are scanning using 800dpi, so scaling is necessary, because
       the sensor only delivers 600dpi but the motor is capable to perform 800dpi steps.

       * On some devices, the pictures seems bluish

       <u>ASIC</u> <u>98001</u> <u>based</u> <u>models:</u>

       * The 300dpi transparency and negative mode does not work correctly.

       * There is currently no way to distinguish a model with and without transparency unit.

       * The scanned images seem to be too dark (P9636T)

       <u>ASIC</u> <u>96003/1</u> <u>based</u> <u>models:</u>

       * 30bit mode is currently not supported.

       * On low end systems under heavy system load the driver may  lose  data,  which  can  result  in  picture
       corruption or cause the sensor to hit the scan bed.

       * The scanning speed on 600x1200 dpi models is slow.

       * The scanning quality of the A3I is poor.

                                                   14 Jul 2008                                <u><a href="../man5/sane-plustek_pp.5.html">sane-plustek_pp</a></u>(5)
