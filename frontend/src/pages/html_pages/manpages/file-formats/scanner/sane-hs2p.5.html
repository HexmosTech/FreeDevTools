</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sane-hs2p - SANE backend for Ricoh SCSI flatbed/ADF scanners

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-hs2p</b>  library  implements  a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to the
       Ricoh IS450 family of scanners. Should also work with the IS420, IS410, and IS430 scanners, but these are
       untested.  Please contact the maintainer or the sane-devel mailing list if you own such a scanner.

       This backend is alpha-quality. It may have bugs and some scanners haven't been tested at all. Be  careful
       and pull the plug if the scanner causes unusual noise.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              <u>special</u>

       Where  <u>special</u>  is  the  path-name for the special device that corresponds to a SCSI scanner. The program
       <b><a href="../man1/sane-find-scanner.1.html">sane-find-scanner</a></b>(1) helps to find out the correct device. Under Linux,  such  a  device  name  could  be
       <u>/dev/sg0</u> or <u>/dev/sga</u>, for example.  See <b><a href="../man5/sane-scsi.5.html">sane-scsi</a></b>(5) for details.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  contents  of  the  <u>hs2p.conf</u> file is a list of device names that correspond to SCSI scanners.  Empty
       lines and lines starting with a hash  mark  (#)  are  ignored.   See  <b><a href="../man5/sane-scsi.5.html">sane-scsi</a></b>(5)  on  details  of  what
       constitutes a valid device name.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/sane.d/hs2p.conf</u>
              The backend configuration file (see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hs2p.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hs2p.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              This  environment  variable  specifies  the list of directories that may contain the configuration
              file.  On *NIX systems, the directories are separated by a  colon  (`:'),  under  OS/2,  they  are
              separated  by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file is searched
              in two default directories: first, the current working directory (".") and  then  in  <u>/etc/sane.d</u>.
              If  the  value  of  the environment variable ends with the directory separator character, then the
              default directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting
              <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories <u>tmp/config</u>, <u>.</u>, and <u>/etc/sane.d</u> being
              searched (in this order).

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_HS2P</b>
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this  environment  variable  controls  the
              debug  level  for  this  backend.   A value of 255 prints all debug output.  Smaller values reduce
              verbosity.

</pre><h4><b>CURRENT</b> <b>STATUS</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>sane-hs2p</b> backend is now in version 1.00. All major scanning-related features are  supported,  except
       for  those  features  requiring  the  optional  IPU.  Scanning from the flatbed or ADF (either simplex or
       duplex) is supported. Lineart, halftone, 4-bit gray, and 8-bit gray are supported. Pre-set  gamma  tables
       and  halftone patterns are supported, as well as brightness, threshold, contrast.  Also supported is scan
       wait mode, binary and gray filtering, negative scanning, and absolute or relative white setting. Printing
       with the optional endorser also is supported.

</pre><h4><b>PLANNED</b> <b>FUNCTIONALITY</b></h4><pre>
       This scanner can scan from the ADF in continuous simplex  mode.   Surprisingly,  many  scanners  scan  an
       entire document from the ADF into memory before ejecting the sheet. Thus if the document is too long, the
       scanner  cannot  hold the entire image data in memory.  But if the scanner would send its image data when
       its memory got full, and then read the  next  buffer's  worth  of  data,  continuous  scanning  could  be
       achieved.

</pre><h4><b>MISSING</b> <b>FUNCTIONALITY</b></h4><pre>
       The  SCSI  commands  for  uploading  (2AH)  or downloading (28H) custom halftone patterns (02H) and gamma
       vectors (03H) should work, but require implementing the SANE Option-Value  code  to  allow  the  user  to
       create the tables to be uploaded to the scanner. No support for Maintenance Data (80H) is planned as this
       functionality  is more suited to a stand-alone utility to be used by a technician when replacing the lamp
       or ADF unit. Nor is support for reading or changing IPU (93H) parameters and adjustments  planned,  since
       my IS450 lacks such a unit. The 31-byte Auto Photo/Letter struct and 21-byte Dynamic threshold struct are
       documented in the <u>hs2p-scsi.h</u> file should someone wish to use their IPU for image data processing.
