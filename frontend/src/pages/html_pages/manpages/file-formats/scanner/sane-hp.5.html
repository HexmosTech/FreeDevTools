       sane-hp - SANE backend for HP ScanJet scanners

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-hp</b>  library  implements  a  SANE  (Scanner  Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to HP
       ScanJet scanners which support SCL (Scanner Control Language by HP).  The following  scanners  are  known
       positively to work with this backend:

              Model:         Product id:     Interface:
              ----------     -----------     ----------
              ScanJet Plus   C9195A          HP Parallel Interface Card
              ScanJet IIc    C1750A 3226     SCSI
              ScanJet IIcx   C2500A 3332     SCSI
              ScanJet IIp    C1790A          SCSI
              ScanJet 3C     C2520A 3503     SCSI

              ScanJet 5100C  C5190A          parallel port
              ScanJet 5200C  C7190A 3846     parallel port/USB
              ScanJet 6100C  C2520A 3644     SCSI
              ScanJet 6200C  C6270A 3828     SCSI/USB
              ScanJet 6250C  C6270A 3828     SCSI/USB
              ScanJet 6300C  C7670A          SCSI/USB
              ScanJet 6350C  C7670A          SCSI/USB
              ScanJet 6390C  C7670A          SCSI/USB
              PhotoSmart     C5100A R029,R030,R032    SCSI

       Support  for  models  5100C/5200C  connected to the parallel port requires the ppSCSI driver available at
       <u><a href="http://cyberelk.net/tim/parport/ppscsi.html">http://cyberelk.net/tim/parport/ppscsi.html</a></u> and <u><a href="http://penguin-breeder.org/kernel/download/">http://penguin-breeder.org/kernel/download/</a></u>.

       Support for models 5200C/62X0C/63X0C connected to USB requires libusb. See <b><a href="../man5/sane-usb.5.html">sane-usb</a></b>(5) for more details.

       The <b>sane-hp</b> backend no longer supports OfficeJet multi-function peripherals.  For these devices  use  the
       external  "hplip"  packages  available at: <u>https://developers.hp.com/hp-linux-imaging-and-printing/</u>.  For
       information about the previous hpoj driver, see: <u><a href="http://hpoj.sourceforge.net/">http://hpoj.sourceforge.net/</a></u>.

       Because Hewlett-Packard does no longer produce scanners that support SCL  (beside  the  OfficeJets),  the
       above  list  of  supported  scanners  is  complete.   Other  HP scanners are not supported by the <b>sane-hp</b>
       backend, but might be supported by another one. See <u><a href="http://www.sane-project.org/">http://www.sane-project.org/</a></u>.  You can also watch the
       sane-devel mailing list at <u><a href="http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html">http://www.sane-project.org/mailing-lists.html</a></u>.

       More    details     about     the     hp     backend     can     be     found     on     its     homepage
       <u><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070206115546/http">http://web.archive.org/web/20070206115546/http</a>://www.kirchgessner.net/sane.html</u>.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              <u>special</u>

       Where  <u>special</u>  is  the  UNIX path-name for the special device that corresponds to the scanner.  For SCSI
       scanners the special device name must be a generic SCSI device or a symlink  to  such  a  device.   Under
       Linux, such a device name could be <u>/dev/sga</u> or <u>/dev/sg2</u>, for example. If the special device name contains
       "usb", "uscanner" or "ugen", it is assumed that the scanner is connected by USB.  For the HP ScanJet Plus
       the  special  device  name  must  be  the device that corresponds to the parallel interface card that was
       shipped with the scanner. That is <u>/dev/hpscan</u>.   A  special  driver  is  required  for  this  card.   See
       <u><a href="ftp://rvs.ctrl-c.liu.se/pub/wingel/hpscan">ftp://rvs.ctrl-c.liu.se/pub/wingel/hpscan</a></u>    for    details.   If   the   link   does   not   work,   try
       <u><a href="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/scanners">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/patches/scanners</a></u>.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The contents of the <u>hp.conf</u> file is a list of options and device names  that  correspond  to  HP  ScanJet
       scanners.   Empty  lines  and  lines  starting  with  a  hash  mark (#) are ignored. See <b><a href="../man5/sane-scsi.5.html">sane-scsi</a></b>(5) and
       <b><a href="../man5/sane-usb.5.html">sane-usb</a></b>(5) on details of what constitutes a valid device name.

       Options specified in front of the first line that contains a device name are defaults  for  all  devices.
       Options  specified  below  a  line  that contains a device name apply just to the most recently mentioned
       device.

       Supported options are <b>connect-scsi</b>, <b>connect-device</b>, <b>enable-image-buffering</b>, and <b>dumb-read</b>.

       Option <b>connect-scsi</b> specifies that the scanner is connected to  the  system  by  SCSI.   Input/output  is
       performed  using  SCSI-commands.  This  is  the  default.   But  if your SCSI device name contains "usb",
       "uscanner" or "ugen", option connect-scsi must be specified. Otherwise it is assumed that the scanner  is
       connected by USB.

       Option  <b>connect-device</b>  specifies  that  the  scanner  is  connected  to  the system by a special device.
       Input/output is performed by <b>read</b>()/<b>write</b>()-operations on the device. This option must  be  used  for  HP
       ScanJet   Plus   or  scanners  connected  to  USB  which  are  accessed  through  a  named  device  (e.g.
       <u>/dev/usb/scanner0</u>).  For device names that contain "usb", "uscanner" or "ugen", it is  not  necessary  to
       specify option connect-device.

       Option <b>enable-image-buffering</b> stores the scanned image in memory before passing it to the frontend. Could
       be used in case of forward/backward moving scanner lamp.

       Option  <b>dumb-read</b>  can be used to work around problems with "Error during device I/O". These problems may
       occur with certain SCSI-to-USB converters or Buslogic SCSI cards.  The option should not be used for SCSI
       devices which are working correctly.  Otherwise startup of frontends and  changing  parameters  might  be
       slower.

       A sample configuration file is shown below:

              /dev/scanner
              # this is a comment
              /dev/hpscan
              option connect-device

       <u>/dev/scanner</u> is typically a symlink to the actual SCSI scanner device.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/sane.d/hp.conf</u>
              The backend configuration file (see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hp.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-hp.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

       <u>$HOME/.sane/calib-hp:&lt;device&gt;.dat</u>
              Calibration  data  for  HP  PhotoSmart  PhotoScanner  that  is  retrieved  from  the scanner after
              calibration. The data is uploaded to the scanner at start of the backend if it is  in  media  mode
              'print media' or if the media mode is changed to 'print media'.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              This  environment  variable  specifies  the list of directories that may contain the configuration
              file.  On *NIX systems, the directories are separated by a  colon  (`:'),  under  OS/2,  they  are
              separated  by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file is searched
              in two default directories: first, the current working directory (<u>.</u>)  and then in <u>/etc/sane.d</u>.  If
              the value of the environment variable ends  with  the  directory  separator  character,  then  the
              default directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories.  For example, setting
              <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories <u>tmp/config</u>, <u>.</u>, and <u>/etc/sane.d</u> being
              searched (in this order).

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_HP</b>
              If  the  library  was  compiled with debug support enabled, this environment variable controls the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 128 requests  all  debug  output  to  be  printed.
              Smaller levels reduce verbosity.

       <b>SANE_HOME_HP</b>
              Only used for OS/2 and along with use of HP PhotoSmart PhotoScanner.  Must be set to the directory
              where the directory <u>.sane</u> is located. Is used to save and read the calibration file.

       <b>SANE_HP_KEEPOPEN_SCSI</b>

       <b>SANE_HP_KEEPOPEN_USB</b>

       <b>SANE_HP_KEEPOPEN_DEVICE</b>
              For each type of connection (connect-scsi, connect-usb, connect-device) it can be specified if the
              connection  to  the  device  should  be kept open ("1") or not ("0").  Usually the connections are
              closed after an operation is performed.  Keeping connection open to  SCSI-devices  can  result  in
              errors  during  device  IO  when  the  scanner  has  not been used for some time. By default, USB-
              connections are kept open. Other connections are closed.

       <b>SANE_HP_RDREDO</b>
              Specifies number of retries for read operation before returning an EOF error.  Only supported  for
              non-SCSI devices. Default: 1 retry. Time between retries is 0.1 seconds.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>HP</b> <b>PhotoSmart</b> <b>PhotoScanner</b>
              In  media  mode  'slide'  and 'negative', scan resolutions are rounded to multiple of 300 dpi. The
              scanner does not scale the data correctly on other resolutions. Some newer models  (firmware  code
              R030  and  later) do not support adjustment of contrast/intensity level and tone map.  The backend
              will simulate this by software, but only for gray and 24 bit color.

       <b>Automatic</b> <b>Document</b> <b>Feeder</b> <b>(ADF)</b>
              For use of the ADF with <b><a href="../man1/xscanimage.1.html">xscanimage</a></b>(1), first place paper in the ADF and then  change  option  scan
              source  to  'ADF'.  Press  'change  document'  to load a sheet. Then press 'scan' to start a scan.
              Maybe it is sufficient to press 'scan' without 'change document' for repeated scans.  The  use  of
              the  preview  window  is not recommended when working with the ADF.  Setting a window to scan from
              ADF is not supported with <b><a href="../man1/xscanimage.1.html">xscanimage</a></b>(1).  Try <b><a href="../man1/xsane.1.html">xsane</a></b>(1).

       <b>Immediate</b> <b>actions</b>
              Some actions in <b><a href="../man1/xscanimage.1.html">xscanimage</a></b>(1) (i.e. unload, select media, calibrate) have an immediate  effect  on
              the scanner without starting a scan.  These options can not be used with <b><a href="../man1/scanimage.1.html">scanimage</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>TODO</b></h4><pre>
       <b>HP</b> <b>PhotoSmart</b> <b>PhotoScanner</b>
              PhotoScanners   with   firmware   release   R030   and   up   have   no   firmware   support   for
              contrast/brightness/gamma table. In the current backend this is simulated by software on  24  bits
              data.  Simulation on 30 bits should give better results.

       <b>Data</b> <b>widths</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>8</b> <b>bits</b>
              Custom gamma table does not work.

       <b>Parallel</b> <b>scanner</b> <b>support</b>
              Beside  the  ScanJet  Plus  which came with its own parallel interface card, currently only the HP
              ScanJet 5100C/5200C  are  supported.   These  scanners  are  using  an  internal  parallel-to-SCSI
              converter which is supported by the ppSCSI-driver (see above).
