</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sane-microtek2 - SANE backend for Microtek scanners with SCSI-2 command set

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sane-microtek2</b>  library  implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to
       Microtek scanners with a SCSI-2 command set.  This backend can be considered alpha to beta. Some  scanner
       models are reported to work well, others not.

       There   exists   a   different  backend  for  Microtek  scanners  with  SCSI-1  command  set.   Refer  to
       <b><a href="../man5/sane-microtek.5.html">sane-microtek</a></b>(5) for details.

       And there is partial progress for the ScanMaker 3600.  See <u><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sm3600">http://sourceforge.net/projects/sm3600</a></u>.

       At present, the following scanners are known positively to work with this backend:

       If you own a Microtek scanner other than the ones listed above, it may or may not work with SANE! Because
       equal scanners are sold under different names in different countries your model may be equivalent to  one
       of the above.

       The     parport     scanners    work    with    the    ppscsi    +    onscsi    kernel    modules.    See
       <u><a href="http://cyberelk.net/tim/parport/ppscsi.html">http://cyberelk.net/tim/parport/ppscsi.html</a></u> and <u><a href="http://penguin-breeder.org/kernel/download/">http://penguin-breeder.org/kernel/download/</a></u>.

       The USB scanners work with the microtek kernel module. You may have to add the vendor and model codes  to
       microtek.c if they aren't yet listed there.

       Both parport and USB scanners need the generic SCSI support, so check if you have loaded the scsi_mod and
       sg modules!

       If  you  try  your  scanner  for  the  first  time keep an eye on it. If it gets commands that it doesn't
       understand the scanhead may go beyond the scan area.  The scanner then makes strange noises. In this case
       immediately switch off the scanner or disconnect its power cable to prevent damages!

       If your scanner is a different one than the models mentioned above and it  is  working  please  tell  the
       author  about it. It would be nice if you add a logfile to this information (creation of the logfile: see
       below).

       If your scanner is not working properly you also should create a logfile and send it to  the  author.  He
       will use the information to improve the backend and possibly make your scanner work.

       How to create the logfile?

       - put the line
              "option dump 2" into your <u>microtek2.conf</u> file or change the existing "option dump" to "2"

       - in a terminal (bash) type
              "export SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK2=30" and then
              "scanimage -l0 -t0 -x100 -y20 2&gt;scan.log &gt;sout.pnm"
              You  get  two  files:  scan.log  contains the logfile and sout.pnm the scanned image (if there was
              scanned something). Zip them before sending.

</pre><h4><b>FRONTEND</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       This backend dynamically enables the options for the frontend, that  are  supported  by  the  scanner  in
       dependence of the scanning-mode and other options.  Not supported options are disabled.

       The following options are supported by the <b>sane-microtek2</b> driver:

       Color, grayscale, halftone and lineart scans.

       Highlight,  midtone,  shadow,  contrast,  brightness,  exposure time control, gamma correction, threshold
       (dependent of the scan mode and the scanner capabilities)

       Transparency media adapter, automatic document feeder

       Additional options can be enabled or disabled in the <u>microtek2.conf</u> file. See the  configuration  section
       of this manpage.

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       This backend expects device names of the form:

              <u>special</u>

       Where  <u>special</u> is the UNIX path-name for the special device that corresponds to the scanner.  The special
       device name must be a generic SCSI device or a symlink to such a device.  Under Linux, such a device name
       could be <u>/dev/sga</u> or <u>/dev/sge</u> for example.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration file for this backend resides in <u>/etc/sane.d/microtek2.conf</u>.

       Its contents is a list of device names that correspond to Microtek scanners with SCSI-2 interface.  Empty
       lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.

       The configuration file may also contain options. Global options that are valid for all devices are placed
       above  the  device names. Device-specific options are placed under the device name. Note that, except for
       option dump &lt;n&gt; and option strip-height &lt;n&gt;, the entry  in  the  <u>microtek2.conf</u>  file  only  enables  the
       corresponding option for being showed in the frontend. There, in the frontend, you can switch the options
       on and off.  Currently the following options are supported:

              option dump &lt;n&gt;
              option strip-height &lt;n&gt;
              option no-backtrack-option &lt;on/off&gt;
              option lightlid-35 &lt;on/off&gt;
              option toggle-lamp &lt;on/off&gt;
              option lineart-autoadjust &lt;on/off&gt;
              option backend-calibration &lt;on/off&gt;
              option colorbalance-adjust &lt;on/off&gt;

       <u>option</u>  <u>dump</u>  <u>&lt;n&gt;</u> enables printing of additional information about the SCSI commands that are sent to the
       scanner to stderr. This option is primarily useful for debugging purpose. This option has to be a  global
       option and is best placed at the top of the <u>microtek2.conf</u> file.

       If  n=1  the  contents  of the command blocks and the results for the INQUIRY and READ SCANNER ATTRIBUTES
       command are printed to stderr.

       If n=2 the contents of the command blocks for all other SCSI commands are printed to stderr, too. If  n=3
       the contents of the gamma table is printed, too. If n=4 all scan data is additionally printed to stderr.

       The default is n=1.

       <u>option</u>  <u>strip-height</u>  <u>&lt;n&gt;</u>  , where &lt;n&gt; is a floating point number, limits the amount of data that is read
       from the scanner with one read command.  The unit is inch and &lt;n&gt; defaults to 1.0, if this option is  not
       set  in  the configuration file. If less than &lt;n&gt; inch of data fit into the SCSI buffer, then the smaller
       value is used and this option has no effect.

       If your system has a big SCSI buffer and you want to make use of the whole buffer, increase the value for
       &lt;n&gt;. For example, if &lt;n&gt; is set to 14.0, no restrictions apply for scanners with a letter,  legal  or  A4
       sized scan area.

       The  following  options  enable  or  disable  additional frontend options. If an option is set to &lt;on&gt; an
       appropriate option will appear in the frontend.

       <u>option</u> <u>no-backtrack-option</u> <u>&lt;on/off&gt;</u> prevents the scanner head from  moving  backwards  between  the  read
       commands.  This speeds up scanning. Try it.

       <u>option</u>  <u>lightlid-35</u>  <u>&lt;on/off&gt;</u>  If you use the LightLid-35 transparency adapter you get an advanced option
       which switches off the flatbed lamp during the scan.

       <u>option</u> <u>toggle-lamp</u> <u>&lt;on/off&gt;</u> You get a button in the frontend where you can switch on and off the  flatbed
       lamp.

       <u>option</u>  <u>lineart-autoadjust</u>  <u>&lt;on/off&gt;</u>  You  can  tell the backend to try to determine a good value for the
       lineart threshold.

       <u>option</u> <u>backend-calibration</u> <u>&lt;on/off&gt;</u> Some scanners (e.g. Phantom 330CX and 636CX) need to have  calibrated
       the data by the backend. Try this option if you see vertical stripes in your pictures.

       <u>option</u>  <u>colorbalance-adjust</u>  <u>&lt;on/off&gt;</u> Some scanners (e.g. Phantom 330CX and 636CX) need to have corrected
       the color balance. If this option is enabled you get advanced options where you can balance  the  colors.
       And you will have a button to use the values that the firmware of the scanner provides.

       A sample configuration file is shown below:

              option dump 1
              option strip-height 1.0
              /dev/scanner
              option no-backtrack-option on
              # this is a comment
              /dev/sge
              option lightlid-35 on

       This  backend  also  supports  the new configuration file format which makes it easier to detect scanners
       under Linux. If you have only one scanner it would be best to use the following  configuration  file  for
       this backend:

              option dump 1
              option strip-height 14.0
              option no-backtrack-option on
              option backend-calibration on
              option lightlid-35 on
              option toggle-lamp on
              option lineart-autoadjust on
              option colorbalance-adjust off
              scsi * * Scanner

       In this case all SCSI-Scanners should be detected automatically because of the

       scsi * * Scanner

       line.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/sane.d/microtek2.conf</u>
              The backend configuration file.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-microtek2.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-microtek2.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK2</b>
              If  the  library  was  compiled with debug support enabled, this environment variable controls the
              debug level for this backend.  E.g., a value of 255 requests  all  debug  output  to  be  printed.
              Smaller  levels  reduce  verbosity.  To see error messages on stderr set <b>SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK2</b> to 1
              (Remark: The whole debugging levels should be better revised).
              E.g. just say:
              export SANE_DEBUG_MICROTEK2=128
