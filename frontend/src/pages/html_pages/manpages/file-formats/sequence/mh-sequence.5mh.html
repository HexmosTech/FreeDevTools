       mh-sequence - sequence specification for nmh message system

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  sequence  (or  sequence set) is a symbolic name representing a message or collection of messages.  <b>nmh</b>
       has several internally defined sequences, as well as allowing users to define their own sequences.

   <b>Message</b> <b>Specification</b> <b>and</b> <b>Pre-Defined</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Sequences</b>
       Most <b>nmh</b> commands accept a `msg' or `msgs' specification, where `msg' indicates one  message  and  `msgs'
       indicates one or more messages.  To designate a message, you may use either its number (e.g., 1, 10, 234)
       or one of these “reserved” message names:

            <b>first</b>  the first message in the folder
            <b>last</b>   the last message in the folder
            <b>cur</b>    the most recently accessed message
            <b>prev</b>   the message numerically preceding “cur”
            <b>next</b>   the message numerically following “cur”

       In  commands  that  take  a  `msg'  argument, the default is “cur”.  As a shorthand, “.” is equivalent to
       “cur”.

       For example: In a folder containing five messages numbered 5, 10, 94, 177  and  325,  “first”  is  5  and
       “last” is 325.  If “cur” is 94, then “prev” is 10 and “next” is 177.

       The  word  `msgs' indicates that one or more messages may be specified.  Such a specification consists of
       one message designation or of several message designations, as separate arguments.  A message designation
       consists either of a message name as defined above, or a message range.

       A message range is specified as “name1-name2” or “name:n”, where `name', `name1' and `name2' are  message
       names, and `n' is an integer.

       The  specification  “name1-name2”  designates  all  currently  existing  messages from `name1' to `name2'
       inclusive.  The “reserved” message name “all” is a shorthand for the message range “first-last”.

       The specification “name:n” designates up to `n' messages.  These messages start with `name' if `name'  is
       a  message  number or one of the reserved names “first” “cur”, or “next”, The messages end with `name' if
       `name' is “prev” or “last”.  The interpretation of `n' may be overridden by preceding `n' with a plus  or
       minus  sign;  `+n'  always means up to `n' messages starting with `name', and `-n' always means up to `n'
       messages ending with `name'.

       Substituting `=' for `:' (i.e., “name=n”) will reduce the selection from a range of up to  `n'  messages,
       to  a selection of just the `n'th message.  So for example, while “name:-3” selects the 3 messages ending
       with `name', “name=-3” selects just the 2nd previous message.  It is an error if  the  requested  message
       does not exist (i.e., there aren't enough messages in the folder).

       In  commands  which  accept  a  `msgs' argument, the default is either “cur” or “all”, depending on which
       makes more sense for each command (see the individual man pages for details).  Repeated specifications of
       the same message have the same effect as a single specification of the message.

       There is also a special “reserved” message name “new” which is used by the <b>mhpath</b> command.

   <b>User-Defined</b> <b>Message</b> <b>Sequences</b>
       In addition to the “reserved” (pre-defined) message names given above, <b>nmh</b> supports user-defined sequence
       names.  User-defined sequences allow the <b>nmh</b> user a tremendous amount of power in dealing with groups  of
       messages  in  the  same  folder by allowing the user to bind a group of messages to a meaningful symbolic
       name.

       The name used to denote a message sequence must consist of an alphabetic character followed  by  zero  or
       more alphanumeric characters, and can not be one of the “reserved” message names above.  After defining a
       sequence, it can be used wherever an <b>nmh</b> command expects a `msg' or `msgs' argument.

       Some  forms of message ranges are allowed with user-defined sequences.  The specification “name:n” may be
       used, and it designates up to the first `n' messages (or last `n' messages for `-n') which  are  elements
       of the user-defined sequence `name'.

       The  specifications “name:next” and “name:prev” may also be used, and they designate the next or previous
       message (relative to the current message) which is an element of the user-defined sequence  `name'.   The
       specifications  “name:first” and “name:last” are equivalent to “name:1” and “name:-1”, respectively.  The
       specification “name:cur” is not allowed (use just “cur” instead).  The  syntax  of  these  message  range
       specifications is subject to change in the future.

       Single  messages (as opposed to ranges) may also be selected by substituting `=' for `:', as in “name=n”.
       This will reduce the selection from being a range of up to `n' messages, to being a selection of just the
       `n'th message.  So while “seq:5” selects the first 5 messages of sequence `seq', “seq=5” selects just the
       5th message of the sequence.  It is an error if the requested message does not exist (i.e., there  aren't
       at least `n' messages in the sequence).

       User-defined  sequence  names  are  specific  to  each  folder.  They are defined using the <b>pick</b> and <b>mark</b>
       commands.

   <b>Public</b> <b>and</b> <b>Private</b> <b>User-Defined</b> <b>Sequences</b>
       There are two varieties of user-defined sequences: public and private.  Public sequences of a folder  are
       accessible  to  any  <b>nmh</b>  user  that  can  read  that  folder.   They are kept in each folder in the file
       determined by the “mh-sequences”  profile  entry  (default  is  <u>.mh_sequences</u>).   Private  sequences  are
       accessible only to the <b>nmh</b> user that defined those sequences and are kept in the user's <b>nmh</b> context file.

       In  general,  the  commands that create sequences (such as <b>pick</b> and <b>mark</b>) will create public sequences if
       the folder for which the sequences are being defined is writable by the <b>nmh</b>  user.   For  most  commands,
       this can be overridden by using the switches <b>-public</b> and <b>-private</b>.  But if the folder is read-only, or if
       the “mh-sequences” profile entry is defined but empty, then <u>private</u> sequences will be created instead.

   <b>Sequence</b> <b>Negation</b>
       <b>Nmh</b> provides the ability to select all messages not elements of a user-defined sequence.  To do this, the
       user  should  define  the entry “Sequence-Negation” in the <b>nmh</b> profile file; its value may be any string.
       This string is then used to preface an existing user-defined  sequence  name.   This  specification  then
       refers  to those messages not elements of the specified sequence name.  For example, if the profile entry
       is:

            Sequence-Negation: not

       then any time an <b>nmh</b> command is given “notfoo” as a `msg' or `msgs' argument,  it  would  substitute  all
       messages that are not elements of the sequence “foo”.

       Obviously,  the  user  should  beware  of  defining sequences with names that begin with the value of the
       “Sequence-Negation” profile entry.

   <b>The</b> <b>Previous</b> <b>Sequence</b>
       <b>Nmh</b> provides the ability to remember the `msgs' or `msg' argument last given  to  an  <b>nmh</b>  command.   The
       entry  “Previous-Sequence”  should  be defined in the <b>nmh</b> profile; its value should be a sequence name or
       multiple sequence names, as separate arguments.  If this entry is defined, when an <b>nmh</b> command  finishes,
       it  will define the sequence(s) named in the value of this entry to be those messages that were specified
       to the command.  Hence, a profile entry of

            Previous-Sequence: pseq

       directs any <b>nmh</b> command that accepts a `msg' or `msgs' argument to define the sequence  “pseq”  as  those
       messages when it finishes.

       <b>Note</b>:  there  can be a performance penalty in using the “Previous-Sequence” facility.  If it is used, <b>all</b>
       <b>nmh</b> programs have to write the sequence information to the <u>.mh_sequences</u> file for the  folder  each  time
       they run.  If the “Previous-Sequence” profile entry is not included, only <b>pick</b> and <b>mark</b> will write to the
       <b>.mh_sequences</b> file.

   <b>The</b> <b>Unseen</b> <b>Sequence</b>
       Finally,  many users like to indicate which messages have not been previously seen by them.  The commands
       <b>flist</b>, <b>inc</b>, <b>mhshow</b>, <b>rcvstore</b>, and  <b>show</b>  honor  the  profile  entry  “Unseen-Sequence”  to  support  this
       activity.   This  entry  in  the <u>.mh_profile</u> should be defined as one or more sequence names, as separate
       arguments.  If there is a value for “Unseen-Sequence” in the profile,  then  whenever  new  messages  are
       placed  in  a  folder  (using  <b>inc</b> or <b>rcvstore</b>), the new messages will also be added to all the sequences
       named in this profile entry.  For example, a profile entry of

            Unseen-Sequence: unseen

       directs <b>inc</b> to add new messages to the sequence “unseen”.  Unlike the behavior of the “Previous-Sequence”
       entry in the profile, however, the sequence(s) will <u>not</u> be zeroed by <b>inc</b>.

       Similarly, whenever <b>show</b>, <b>mhshow</b>, <b>next</b>, or <b>prev</b> displays a message, that message will be removed from any
       sequences named by the “Unseen-Sequence” entry in the profile.

   <b>Sequence</b> <b>File</b> <b>Format</b>
       The sequence file format is based on the RFC 5322  message  format.   Each  line  of  the  sequence  file
       corresponds  to one sequence.  The line starts with the sequence name followed by a `:', then followed by
       a space-separated list of message numbers that  correspond  to  messages  that  are  part  of  the  named
       sequence.  A contiguous range of messages can be represented as “lownum-highnum”.

       <b>Sample</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>file</b>

            work: 3 6 8 22-33 46
            unseen: 47 49-51 54
            cur: 46

       <b>Nmh</b>  commands  that modify the sequence file will silently remove sequences for nonexistent messages when
       the sequence file is updated.  The exception to this is the “cur” sequence, which is allowed to point  to
       a nonexistent message.

   <b>Sequence</b> <b>File</b> <b>Locking</b>
       The  “datalocking”  profile  entry  controls  the  type of locking used when reading and writing sequence
       files.  The locking mechanisms supported are detailed in  <u><a href="../man5/mh-profile.5.html">mh-profile</a></u>(5).   This  protects  sequence  file
       integrity  when multiple <b>nmh</b> commands are run simultaneously.  <b>Nmh</b> commands that modify the sequence file
       use transactional locks; the lock is held from the time the sequence file is read  until  it  it  written
       out.   This ensures that modifications to the sequence file will not be lost if multiple commands are run
       simultaneously.  Long-running <b>nmh</b> commands, such as <b>inc</b> and <b>pick</b>, will release the sequence  lock  during
       the  bulk of their runtime and reread the sequence file after their processing is complete to reduce lock
       contention time.

       Note: Currently transactional locks are only supported for public sequences; private sequences  will  not
       get corrupted, but the possibility exists that two <b>nmh</b> commands run simultaneously that add messages to a
       private sequence could result in one command's messages not appearing on the requested sequence.
