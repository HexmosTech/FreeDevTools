</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       deb-src-symbols - Debian's extended shared library template file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>debian/</b><u>package</u><b>.symbols.</b><u>arch</u>, <b>debian/symbols.</b><u>arch</u>, <b>debian/</b><u>package</u><b>.symbols</b>, <b>debian/symbols</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The symbol file templates are shipped in Debian source packages, and its format is a superset of the
       symbols files shipped in binary packages, see <b><a href="../man5/deb-symbols.5.html">deb-symbols</a></b>(5).

   <b>Comments</b>
       Comments are supported in template symbol files.  Any line with ‘#’ as the first character is a comment
       except if it starts with ‘#include’ (see section "Using includes").  Lines starting with ‘#MISSING:’ are
       special comments documenting symbols that have disappeared.

   <b>Using</b> <b>#PACKAGE#</b> <b>substitution</b>
       In some rare cases, the name of the library varies between architectures.  To avoid hardcoding the name
       of the package in the symbols file, you can use the marker <u>#PACKAGE#</u>.  It will be replaced by the real
       package name during installation of the symbols files.  Contrary to the <u>#MINVER#</u> marker, <u>#PACKAGE#</u> will
       never appear in a symbols file inside a binary package.

   <b>Using</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>tags</b>
       Symbol tagging is useful for marking symbols that are special in some way.  Any symbol can have an
       arbitrary number of tags associated with it.  While all tags are parsed and stored, only some of them are
       understood by <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> and trigger special handling of the symbols.  See subsection "Standard
       symbol tags" for reference of these tags.

       Tag specification comes right before the symbol name (no whitespace is allowed in between).  It always
       starts with an opening bracket <b>(</b>, ends with a closing bracket <b>)</b> and must contain at least one tag.
       Multiple tags are separated by the <b>|</b> character.  Each tag can optionally have a value which is separated
       form the tag name by the <b>=</b> character.  Tag names and values can be arbitrary strings except they cannot
       contain any of the special <b>)</b> <b>|</b> <b>=</b> characters.  Symbol names following a tag specification can optionally
       be quoted with either <b>'</b> or <b>"</b> characters to allow whitespaces in them.  However, if there are no tags
       specified for the symbol, quotes are treated as part of the symbol name which continues up until the
       first space.

         (tag1=i am marked|tag name with space)"tagged quoted symbol"@Base 1.0
         (optional)tagged_unquoted_symbol@Base 1.0 1
         untagged_symbol@Base 1.0

       The first symbol in the example is named <u>tagged</u> <u>quoted</u> <u>symbol</u> and has two tags: <u>tag1</u> with value <u>i</u> <u>am</u>
       <u>marked</u> and <u>tag</u> <u>name</u> <u>with</u> <u>space</u> that has no value.  The second symbol named <u>tagged_unquoted_symbol</u> is only
       tagged with the tag named <u>optional</u>.  The last symbol is an example of the normal untagged symbol.

       Since symbol tags are an extension of the <b><a href="../man5/deb-symbols.5.html">deb-symbols</a></b>(5) format, they can only be part of the symbols
       files used in source packages (those files should then be seen as templates used to build the symbols
       files that are embedded in binary packages).  When <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> is called without the <b>-t</b> option, it
       will output symbols files compatible to the <b><a href="../man5/deb-symbols.5.html">deb-symbols</a></b>(5) format: it fully processes symbols according
       to the requirements of their standard tags and strips all tags from the output.  On the contrary, in
       template mode (<b>-t</b>) all symbols and their tags (both standard and unknown ones) are kept in the output and
       are written in their original form as they were loaded.

   <b>Standard</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>tags</b>
       <b>optional</b>
           A  symbol  marked  as  optional  can disappear from the library at any time and that will never cause
           <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> to fail.  However, disappeared optional symbols will continuously appear  as  MISSING
           in the diff in each new package revision.  This behavior serves as a reminder for the maintainer that
           such  a symbol needs to be removed from the symbol file or readded to the library.  When the optional
           symbol, which was previously declared as MISSING, suddenly reappears in the next revision, it will be
           upgraded back to the “existing” status with its minimum version unchanged.

           This tag is useful for symbols which are private where their disappearance do not cause ABI breakage.
           For example, most of C++ template instantiations fall into this category.  Like any other  tag,  this
           one  may  also  have  an  arbitrary  value: it could be used to indicate why the symbol is considered
           optional.

       <b>arch=</b><u>architecture-list</u>
       <b>arch-bits=</b><u>architecture-bits</u>
       <b>arch-endian=</b><u>architecture-endianness</u>
           These tags allow one to restrict the set of architectures where the symbol is supposed to exist.  The
           <b>arch-bits</b> and <b>arch-endian</b> tags are supported since dpkg 1.18.0.  When the  symbols  list  is  updated
           with  the  symbols  discovered  in  the  library,  all arch-specific symbols which do not concern the
           current host architecture are treated as if they did not exist.  If an arch-specific symbol  matching
           the  current  host  architecture does not exist in the library, normal procedures for missing symbols
           apply and it may cause <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> to fail.  On the other hand, if the  arch-specific  symbol  is
           found  when  it was not supposed to exist (because the current host architecture is not listed in the
           tag or does not match the endianness and bits), it is made arch neutral (i.e. the arch, arch-bits and
           arch-endian tags are dropped and the symbol will appear in the diff due to this change),  but  it  is
           not considered as new.

           When  operating  in  the default non-template mode, among arch-specific symbols only those that match
           the current host architecture are written to the symbols file.  On the  contrary,  all  arch-specific
           symbols (including those from foreign arches) are always written to the symbol file when operating in
           template mode.

           The  format  of  <u>architecture-list</u>  is  the  same  as  the  one  used  in  the <b>Build-Depends</b> field of
           <u>debian/control</u> (except the enclosing square brackets []).  For example, the  first  symbol  from  the
           list  below will be considered only on arm64, any-amd64 and riscv64 architectures, the second only on
           linux architectures, while the third one anywhere except on armel.

             (arch=arm64 any-amd64 riscv64)arch_specific_symbol@Base 1.0
             (arch=linux-any)linux_specific_symbol@Base 1.0
             (arch=!armel)symbol_armel_does_not_have@Base 1.0

           The <u>architecture-bits</u> is either <b>32</b> or <b>64</b>.

             (arch-bits=32)32bit_specific_symbol@Base 1.0
             (arch-bits=64)64bit_specific_symbol@Base 1.0

           The <u>architecture-endianness</u> is either <b>little</b> or <b>big</b>.

             (arch-endian=little)little_endian_specific_symbol@Base 1.0
             (arch-endian=big)big_endian_specific_symbol@Base 1.0

           Multiple restrictions can be chained.

             (arch-bits=32|arch-endian=little)32bit_le_symbol@Base 1.0

       <b>allow-internal</b>
           dpkg-gensymbols has a list of internal symbols that should not appear in symbols files  as  they  are
           usually  only  side-effects  of  implementation details of the toolchain (since dpkg 1.20.1).  If for
           some reason, you really want one of those symbols to be included in the symbols file, you should  tag
           the  symbol  with  <b>allow-internal</b>.   It  can be necessary for some low level toolchain libraries like
           “libgcc”.

       <b>ignore-blacklist</b>
           A deprecated alias for <b>allow-internal</b> (since dpkg 1.20.1, supported since dpkg 1.15.3).

       <b>c++</b> Denotes <u>c++</u> symbol pattern.  See "Using symbol patterns" subsection below.

       <b>symver</b>
           Denotes <u>symver</u> (symbol version) symbol pattern.  See "Using symbol patterns" subsection below.

       <b>regex</b>
           Denotes <u>regex</u> symbol pattern.  See "Using symbol patterns" subsection below.

   <b>Using</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>patterns</b>
       Unlike a standard symbol specification, a pattern may cover  multiple  real  symbols  from  the  library.
       <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> will attempt to match each pattern against each real symbol that does <u>not</u> have a specific
       symbol  counterpart  defined  in  the symbol file.  Whenever the first matching pattern is found, all its
       tags and properties will be used as a basis specification  of  the  symbol.   If  none  of  the  patterns
       matches, the symbol will be considered as new.

       A  pattern  is  considered  lost  if  it  does not match any symbol in the library.  By default this will
       trigger a <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> failure under <b>-c1</b> or higher level.  However, if the failure is  undesired,  the
       pattern  may  be marked with the <u>optional</u> tag.  Then if the pattern does not match anything, it will only
       appear in the diff as MISSING.  Moreover, like any symbol, the pattern may be  limited  to  the  specific
       architectures  with  the  <u>arch</u>  tag.   Please  refer  to "Standard symbol tags" subsection above for more
       information.

       Patterns are an extension of the  <b><a href="../man5/deb-symbols.5.html">deb-symbols</a></b>(5)  format  hence  they  are  only  valid  in  symbol  file
       templates.   Pattern  specification  syntax  is  not  any  different  from  the one of a specific symbol.
       However, symbol name part of the specification serves as an expression to be matched against <u>name@version</u>
       of the real symbol.  In order to distinguish among different pattern types, a pattern will  typically  be
       tagged with a special tag.

       At the moment, <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> supports three basic pattern types:

       <b>c++</b> This  pattern  is denoted by the <u>c++</u> tag.  It matches only C++ symbols by their demangled symbol name
           (as emitted by c++<b><a href="../man1/filt.1.html">filt</a></b>(1) utility).  This pattern is very handy for matching  symbols  which  mangled
           names  might  vary  across  different architectures while their demangled names remain the same.  One
           group of such symbols is <u>non-virtual</u> <u>thunks</u> which have  architecture  specific  offsets  embedded  in
           their  mangled  names.   A  common  instance of this case is a virtual destructor which under diamond
           inheritance needs a non-virtual thunk symbol.  For example, even if  _ZThn8_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base  on
           32-bit architectures will probably be _ZThn16_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base on 64-bit ones, it can be matched
           with a single <u>c++</u> pattern:

            libdummy.so.1 libdummy1 #MINVER#
             [...]
             (c++)"non-virtual thunk to NSB::ClassD::~ClassD()@Base" 1.0
             [...]

           The demangled name above can be obtained by executing the following command:

             $ echo '_ZThn8_N3NSB6ClassDD1Ev@Base' | c++filt

           Please  note  that while mangled name is unique in the library by definition, this is not necessarily
           true for demangled names.  A couple of distinct real symbols may have the same demangled  name.   For
           example, that's the case with non-virtual thunk symbols in complex inheritance configurations or with
           most  constructors  and  destructors  (since  g++  typically  generates  two  real symbols for them).
           However, as these collisions happen on the ABI level, they should not degrade quality of  the  symbol
           file.

       <b>symver</b>
           This  pattern  is  denoted by the <u>symver</u> tag.  Well maintained libraries have versioned symbols where
           each version corresponds to the upstream version where the symbol got added.  If that's the case, you
           can use a <u>symver</u> pattern to match any symbol associated to the specific version.  For example:

            libc.so.6 libc6 #MINVER#
             (symver)GLIBC_2.0 2.0
             [...]
             (symver)GLIBC_2.7 2.7
             <a href="mailto:access@GLIBC_2.0">access@GLIBC_2.0</a> 2.2

           All symbols associated with versions GLIBC_2.0 and GLIBC_2.7 will lead to minimal version of 2.0  and
           2.7  respectively  with  the  exception  of  the  symbol <a href="mailto:access@GLIBC_2.0">access@GLIBC_2.0</a>.  The latter will lead to a
           minimal dependency on libc6 version 2.2 despite being in the scope of the "(symver)GLIBC_2.0" pattern
           because specific symbols take precedence over patterns.

           Please note that while old style wildcard patterns (denoted by "*@version" in the symbol name  field)
           are  still  supported, they have been deprecated by new style syntax "(symver|optional)version".  For
           example, "*@GLIBC_2.0 2.0" should be written as "(symver|optional)GLIBC_2.0 2.0" if the same behavior
           is needed.

       <b>regex</b>
           Regular expression patterns are denoted by the <u>regex</u> tag.  They match by the perl regular  expression
           specified  in  the  symbol  name  field.   A regular expression is matched as it is, therefore do not
           forget to start it with the <u>^</u> character or it may match any part  of  the  real  symbol  <u>name@version</u>
           string.  For example:

            libdummy.so.1 libdummy1 #MINVER#
             (regex)"^mystack_.*@Base$" 1.0
             (regex|optional)"private" 1.0

           Symbols  like  "mystack_new@Base",  "mystack_push@Base", "mystack_pop@Base", etc., will be matched by
           the first pattern while "ng_mystack_new@Base" would not.  The second pattern will match  all  symbols
           having the string "private" in their names and matches will inherit <u>optional</u> tag from the pattern.

       Basic  patterns  listed  above can be combined where it makes sense.  In that case, they are processed in
       the order in which the tags are specified.  For example, both:

         (c++|regex)"^NSA::ClassA::Private::privmethod\d\(int\)@Base" 1.0
         (regex|c++)N3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod\dEi@Base 1.0

       will          match          symbols           "_ZN3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod1Ei@Base"           and
       "_ZN3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod2Ei@Base".   When  matching the first pattern, the raw symbol is first
       demangled as C++ symbol, then the demangled name is matched against the regular expression.  On the other
       hand, when matching the second pattern, regular expression is matched against the raw symbol  name,  then
       the  symbol is tested if it is C++ one by attempting to demangle it.  A failure of any basic pattern will
       result    in    the    failure     of     the     whole     pattern.      Therefore,     for     example,
       "__N3NSA6ClassA7Private11privmethod\dEi@Base"  will  not match either of the patterns because it is not a
       valid C++ symbol.

       In general, all patterns are divided into two groups: aliases (basic <u>c++</u> and <u>symver</u>) and generic patterns
       (<u>regex</u>, all combinations of multiple basic patterns).  Matching of basic  alias-based  patterns  is  fast
       (<a href="../man1/O.1.html">O</a>(1))  while  generic  patterns  are O(N) (N - generic pattern count) for each symbol.  Therefore, it is
       recommended not to overuse generic patterns.

       When multiple patterns match the same real symbol, aliases (first <u>c++</u>, then <u>symver</u>)  are  preferred  over
       generic  patterns.   Generic patterns are matched in the order they are found in the symbol file template
       until the first success.  Please note, however, that manual reordering of template file  entries  is  not
       recommended because <b>dpkg-gensymbols</b> generates diffs based on the alphanumerical order of their names.

   <b>Using</b> <b>includes</b>
       When  the set of exported symbols differ between architectures, it may become inefficient to use a single
       symbol file.  In those cases, an include directive may prove to be useful in a couple of ways:

       •   You  can  factorize  the  common  part  in  some  external  file  and  include  that  file  in   your
           <u>package</u>.symbols.<u>arch</u> file by using an include directive like this:

            #include "I&lt;packages&gt;.symbols.common"

       •   The include directive may also be tagged like any symbol:

            (tag|...|tagN)#include "file-to-include"

           As  a  result, all symbols included from <u>file-to-include</u> will be considered to be tagged with <u>tag</u> ...
           <u>tagN</u> by default.  You can use this feature to create a common  <u>package</u>.symbols  file  which  includes
           architecture specific symbol files:

             common_symbol1@Base 1.0
            (arch-bits=64)#include "package.symbols.64-bit"
            (arch-bits=32)#include "package.symbols.32-bit"
             common_symbol2@Base 1.0

       The  symbols  files  are  read  line  by  line,  and include directives are processed as soon as they are
       encountered.  This means that the content of the included file can override  any  content  that  appeared
       before  the include directive and that any content after the directive can override anything contained in
       the included file.  Any symbol (or even another #include directive) in  the  included  file  can  specify
       additional  tags or override values of the inherited tags in its tag specification.  However, there is no
       way for the symbol to remove any of the inherited tags.

       An included file can repeat the header line containing the SONAME of  the  library.   In  that  case,  it
       overrides  any  header  line  previously read.  However, in general it's best to avoid duplicating header
       lines.  One way to do it is the following:

        #include "libsomething1.symbols.common"
         arch_specific_symbol@Base 1.0
