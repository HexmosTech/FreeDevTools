</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sources.list - List of configured APT data sources

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The source list <a href="file:/etc/apt/sources.list">/etc/apt/sources.list</a> and the files contained in <a href="file:/etc/apt/sources.list.d/">/etc/apt/sources.list.d/</a> are designed to
       support any number of active sources and a variety of source media. The files list one source per line
       (one-line style) or contain multiline stanzas defining one or more sources per stanza (deb822 style),
       with the most preferred source listed first (in case a single version is available from more than one
       source). The information available from the configured sources is acquired by <b>apt-get</b> <b>update</b> (or by an
       equivalent command from another APT front-end).

       If multiple source lists are used, the most-preferred sources are those listed in <a href="file:/etc/apt/sources.list">/etc/apt/sources.list</a>,
       followed by each file in <a href="file:/etc/apt/sources.list.d/">/etc/apt/sources.list.d/</a> in lexicographic order: for example,
       00-high-preference.list is more-preferred than 50-middle-preference.sources which is more-preferred than
       z-low-preference.list.

</pre><h4><b>SOURCES.LIST.D</b></h4><pre>
       The <a href="file:/etc/apt/sources.list.d">/etc/apt/sources.list.d</a> directory provides a way to add sources.list entries in separate files. Two
       different file formats are allowed as described in the next two sections. Filenames need to have either
       the extension .list or .sources depending on the contained format. The filenames may only contain letters
       (a-z and A-Z), digits (0-9), underscore (_), hyphen (-) and period (.) characters. Otherwise APT will
       print a notice that it has ignored a file, unless that file matches a pattern in the
       Dir::Ignore-Files-Silently configuration list - in which case it will be silently ignored.

       The suggested filename for new systems is <a href="file:/etc/apt/sources.list.d/">/etc/apt/sources.list.d/</a><u>vendor</u>.sources, where <u>vendor</u> is the
       result of <b>dpkg-vendor</b> <b>--query</b> <b>Vendor</b> <b>|</b> <b>tr</b> <b>A-Z</b> <b>a-z</b>, in deb822-style format. For example, Ubuntu uses
       /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu.sources.

</pre><h4><b>ONE-LINE-STYLE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Files in this format have the extension .list. Each line specifying a source starts with a type (e.g.
       deb-src) followed by options and arguments for this type. Individual entries cannot be continued onto a
       following line. Empty lines are ignored, and a # character anywhere on a line marks the remainder of that
       line as a comment. Consequently an entry can be disabled by commenting out the entire line. If options
       should be provided they are separated by spaces and all of them together are enclosed by square brackets
       ([]) included in the line after the type separated from it with a space. If an option allows multiple
       values these are separated from each other with a comma (,). An option name is separated from its
       value(s) by an equals sign (=). Multivalue options also have -= and += as separators, which instead of
       replacing the default with the given value(s) modify the default value(s) to remove or include the given
       values.

       This is the traditional format and supported by all apt versions. Note that not all options as described
       below are supported by all apt versions. Note also that some older applications parsing this format on
       their own might not expect to encounter options as they were uncommon before the introduction of
       multi-architecture support.

       This format is deprecated and may eventually be removed, but not before 2029.

</pre><h4><b>DEB822-STYLE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Files in this format have the extension .sources. The format is similar in syntax to other files used by
       Debian and its derivatives, such as the metadata files that apt will download from the configured sources
       or the debian/control file in a Debian source package. Individual entries are separated by an empty line;
       additional empty lines are ignored, and a # character at the start of the line marks the entire line as a
       comment. An entry can hence be disabled by commenting out each line belonging to the stanza, but it is
       usually easier to add the field "Enabled: no" to the stanza to disable the entry. Removing the field or
       setting it to yes re-enables it. Options have the same syntax as every other field: A field name
       separated by a colon (:) and optionally spaces from its value(s). Note especially that multiple values
       are separated by whitespaces (like spaces, tabs and newlines), not by commas as in the one-line format.
       Multivalue fields like Architectures also have Architectures-Add and Architectures-Remove to modify the
       default value rather than replacing it.

       This is a new format supported by apt itself since version 1.1. Previous versions ignore such files with
       a notice message as described earlier. It is intended to make this format gradually the default format,
       deprecating the previously described one-line-style format, as it is easier to create, extend and modify
       for humans and machines alike especially if a lot of sources and/or options are involved. Developers who
       are working with and/or parsing apt sources are highly encouraged to add support for this format and to
       contact the APT team to coordinate and share this work. Users can freely adopt this format already, but
       may encounter problems with software not supporting the format yet.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>DEB</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DEB-SRC</b> <b>TYPES:</b> <b>GENERAL</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The deb type references a typical two-level Debian archive, distribution/component. The distribution is
       generally a suite name like stable or testing or a codename like trixie or forky while component is one
       of main, contrib, non-free or non-free-firmware. The deb-src type references a Debian distribution's
       source code in the same form as the deb type. A deb-src line is required to fetch source indexes.

       The format for two one-line-style entries using the deb and deb-src types is:

           deb [ option1=value1 option2=value2 ] uri suite [component1] [component2] [...]
           deb-src [ option1=value1 option2=value2 ] uri suite [component1] [component2] [...]

       Alternatively the equivalent entry in deb822 style looks like this:

                Types: deb deb-src
                URIs: uri
                Suites: suite
                Components: [component1] [component2] [...]
                option1: value1
                option2: value2

       The URI for the deb type must specify the base of the Debian distribution, from which APT will find the
       information it needs.  suite can specify an exact path, in which case the components must be omitted and
       suite must end with a slash (/). This is useful for the case when only a particular sub-directory of the
       archive denoted by the URI is of interest. If suite does not specify an exact path, at least one
       component must be present.

       suite may also contain a variable, $(ARCH) which expands to the Debian architecture (such as amd64 or
       armel) used on the system. This permits architecture-independent sources.list files to be used. In
       general this is only of interest when specifying an exact path; APT will automatically generate a URI
       with the current architecture otherwise.

       Especially in the one-line-style format since only one distribution can be specified per line it may be
       necessary to have multiple lines for the same URI, if a subset of all available distributions or
       components at that location is desired. APT will sort the URI list after it has generated a complete set
       internally, and will collapse multiple references to the same Internet host, for instance, into a single
       connection, so that it does not inefficiently establish a connection, close it, do something else, and
       then re-establish a connection to that same host. APT also parallelizes connections to different hosts to
       more effectively deal with sites with low bandwidth.

       It is important to list sources in order of preference, with the most preferred source listed first.
       Typically this will result in sorting by speed from fastest to slowest (CD-ROM followed by hosts on a
       local network, followed by distant Internet hosts, for example).

       As an example, the sources for your distribution could look like this in the deprecated one-line-style
       format:

           deb [signed-by=<a href="file:/usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg">/usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg</a>] <a href="http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu">http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu</a> plucky main restricted
           deb [signed-by=<a href="file:/usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg">/usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg</a>] <a href="http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu">http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu</a> plucky-security main restricted
           deb [signed-by=<a href="file:/usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg">/usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg</a>] <a href="http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu">http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu</a> plucky-updates main restricted

       or like this in deb822 style format:

           Types: deb
           URIs: <a href="http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu">http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu</a>
           Suites: plucky plucky-updates
           Components: main restricted
           Signed-By: <a href="file:/usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg">/usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg</a>

           Types: deb
           URIs: <a href="http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu">http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu</a>
           Suites: plucky-security
           Components: main restricted
           Signed-By: <a href="file:/usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg">/usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-archive-keyring.gpg</a>

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>DEB</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DEB-SRC</b> <b>TYPES:</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Each source entry can have options specified to modify which source is accessed and how data is acquired
       from it. Format, syntax and names of the options vary between the one-line-style and deb822-style formats
       as described, but they both have the same options available. For simplicity we list the deb822 field name
       and provide the one-line name in brackets. Remember that besides setting multivalue options explicitly,
       there is also the option to modify them based on the default, but we aren't listing those names
       explicitly here. Unsupported options are silently ignored by all APT versions.

       •   <b>Include</b> (<b>include</b>) is a multivalue option defining which packages should be used from this repository.
           Others are not parsed.

       •   <b>Exclude</b> (<b>exclude</b>) is a multivalue option defining which packages should not be used from this
           repository. They will not be parsed. This option is mutually exclusive with <b>Include</b>.

       •   <b>Architectures</b> (<b>arch</b>) is a multivalue option defining for which architectures information should be
           downloaded. If this option isn't set the default is all architectures as defined by the
           <b>APT::Architectures</b> config option.

       •   <b>Languages</b> (<b>lang</b>) is a multivalue option defining for which languages information such as translated
           package descriptions should be downloaded. If this option isn't set the default is all languages as
           defined by the <b>Acquire::Languages</b> config option.

       •   <b>Targets</b> (<b>target</b>) is a multivalue option defining which download targets apt will try to acquire from
           this source. If not specified, the default set is defined by the <b>Acquire::IndexTargets</b> configuration
           scope (targets are specified by their name in the Created-By field). Additionally, targets can be
           enabled or disabled by using the Identifier field as an option with a boolean value instead of using
           this multivalue option.

       •   <b>PDiffs</b> (<b>pdiffs</b>) is a yes/no value which controls if APT should try to use PDiffs to update old
           indexes instead of downloading the new indexes entirely. The value of this option is ignored if the
           repository doesn't announce the availability of PDiffs. Defaults to the value of the option with the
           same name for a specific index file defined in the <b>Acquire::IndexTargets</b> scope, which itself defaults
           to the value of configuration option <b>Acquire::PDiffs</b> which defaults to yes.

       •   <b>By-Hash</b> (<b>by-hash</b>) can have the value yes, no or force and controls if APT should try to acquire
           indexes via a URI constructed from a hashsum of the expected file instead of using the well-known
           stable filename of the index. Using this can avoid hashsum mismatches, but requires a supporting
           mirror. A yes or no value activates/disables the use of this feature if this source indicates support
           for it, while force will enable the feature regardless of what the source indicates. Defaults to the
           value of the option of the same name for a specific index file defined in the <b>Acquire::IndexTargets</b>
           scope, which itself defaults to the value of configuration option <b>Acquire::By-Hash</b> which defaults to
           yes.

       Furthermore, there are options which if set affect <u>all</u> sources with the same URI and Suite, so they have
       to be set on all such entries and can not be varied between different components. APT will try to detect
       and error out on such anomalies.

       •   <b>Allow-Insecure</b> (<b>allow-insecure</b>), <b>Allow-Weak</b> (<b>allow-weak</b>) and <b>Allow-Downgrade-To-Insecure</b>
           (<b>allow-downgrade-to-insecure</b>) are boolean values which all default to no. If set to yes they
           circumvent parts of <b><a href="../man8/apt-secure.8.html">apt-secure</a></b>(8) and should therefore not be used lightly!

       •   <b>Trusted</b> (<b>trusted</b>) is a tri-state value which defaults to APT deciding if a source is considered
           trusted or if warnings should be raised before e.g. packages are installed from this source. This
           option can be used to override that decision. The value yes tells APT always to consider this source
           as trusted, even if it doesn't pass authentication checks. It disables parts of <b><a href="../man8/apt-secure.8.html">apt-secure</a></b>(8), and
           should therefore only be used in a local and trusted context (if at all) as otherwise security is
           breached. The value no does the opposite, causing the source to be handled as untrusted even if the
           authentication checks passed successfully. The default value can't be set explicitly.

       •   <b>Signed-By</b> (<b>signed-by</b>) is an option to require a repository to pass <b><a href="../man8/apt-secure.8.html">apt-secure</a></b>(8) verification with a
           certain set of keys rather than all trusted keys apt has configured. It is specified as a list of
           absolute paths to keyring files (have to be accessible and readable for the _apt system user, so
           ensure everyone has read-permissions on the file) and fingerprints of keys to select from these
           keyrings. The recommended locations for keyrings are <a href="file:/usr/share/keyrings">/usr/share/keyrings</a> for keyrings managed by
           packages, and <a href="file:/etc/apt/keyrings">/etc/apt/keyrings</a> for keyrings managed by the system operator. If no keyring files are
           specified the default is the trusted.gpg keyring and all keyrings in the trusted.gpg.d/ directory. If
           no fingerprint is specified all keys in the keyrings are selected. A fingerprint will accept also all
           signatures by a subkey of this key, if this isn't desired an exclamation mark (!) can be appended to
           the fingerprint to disable this behaviour. The option defaults to the value of the option with the
           same name if set in the previously acquired Release file of this repository (only fingerprints can be
           specified there through). Otherwise all keys in the trusted keyrings are considered valid signers for
           this repository. The option may also be set directly to an embedded GPG public key block. Special
           care is needed to encode the empty line with leading spaces and ".":

                -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
       •   <b>Check-Valid-Until</b> (<b>check-valid-until</b>) is a yes/no value which controls if APT should try to detect
           replay attacks. A repository creator can declare a time until which the data provided in the
           repository should be considered valid, and if this time is reached, but no new data is provided, the
           data is considered expired and an error is raised. Besides increasing security, as a malicious
           attacker can't send old data forever to prevent a user from upgrading to a new version, this also
           helps users identify mirrors which are no longer updated. However, some repositories such as historic
           archives are not updated any more by design, so this check can be disabled by setting this option to
           no. Defaults to the value of configuration option <b>Acquire::Check-Valid-Until</b> which itself defaults to
           yes.

       •   <b>Valid-Until-Min</b> (<b>valid-until-min</b>) and <b>Valid-Until-Max</b> (<b>valid-until-max</b>) can be used to raise or lower
           the time period in seconds in which the data from this repository is considered valid. -Max can be
           especially useful if the repository provides no Valid-Until field on its Release file to set your own
           value, while -Min can be used to increase the valid time on seldom updated (local) mirrors of a more
           frequently updated but less accessible archive (which is in the sources.list as well) instead of
           disabling the check entirely. Default to the value of the configuration options
           <b>Acquire::Min-ValidTime</b> and <b>Acquire::Max-ValidTime</b> which are both unset by default.

       •   <b>Check-Date</b> (<b>check-date</b>) is a yes/no value which controls if APT should consider the machine's time
           correct and hence perform time related checks, such as verifying that a Release file is not from the
           future. Disabling it also disables the <b>Check-Valid-Until</b> option mentioned above.

       •   <b>Date-Max-Future</b> (<b>date-max-future</b>) controls how far from the future a repository may be. Default to
           the value of the configuration option <b>Acquire::Max-FutureTime</b> which is 10 seconds by default.

       •   <b>InRelease-Path</b> (<b>inrelease-path</b>) determines the path to the InRelease file, relative to the normal
           position of an InRelease file. By default, this option is unset and APT will try to fetch an
           InRelease or, if that fails, a Release file and its associated Release.gpg file. By setting this
           option, the specified path will be tried instead of the InRelease file, and the fallback to Release
           files will be disabled.

       •   <b>Snapshot</b> (<b>snapshot</b>) allows selecting an earlier version of the archive from the snapshot service.
           Supported values are: enable (default) to allow selecting a snapshot with the <b>--snapshot</b> option, ID,
           or disable to exclude the repository.

           Snapshot IDs are usually timestamps in the form of YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ, such as 20220102T030405Z which
           is the January 2nd, 2022 at 03:04:05 UTC, servers may however support additional types of IDs, and
           APT does not perform any checks so far.

</pre><h4><b>URI</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       The currently recognized URI types are:

       <b>http</b> (<b><a href="../man1/apt-transport-http.1.html">apt-transport-http</a></b>(1))
           The http scheme specifies an HTTP server for an archive and is the most commonly used method. The URI
           can directly include login information if the archive requires it, but the use of <b><a href="../man5/apt_auth.conf.5.html">apt_auth.conf</a></b>(5)
           should be preferred. The method also supports SOCKS5 and HTTP(S) proxies either configured via
           apt-specific configuration or specified by the environment variable <b>http_proxy</b> in the format
           (assuming an HTTP proxy requiring authentication) <u><a href="http://user">http://user</a>:pass@server:port/</u>. The authentication
           details for proxies can also be supplied via <b><a href="../man5/apt_auth.conf.5.html">apt_auth.conf</a></b>(5).

           Note that these forms of authentication are insecure as the whole communication with the remote
           server (or proxy) is not encrypted so a sufficiently capable attacker can observe and record login as
           well as all other interactions. The attacker can <u>not</u> modify the communication through as APT's data
           security model is independent of the chosen transport method. See <b><a href="../man8/apt-secure.8.html">apt-secure</a></b>(8) for details.

       <b>https</b> (<b><a href="../man1/apt-transport-https.1.html">apt-transport-https</a></b>(1))
           The https scheme specifies an HTTPS server for an archive and is very similar in use and available
           options to the http scheme. The main difference is that the communication between apt and server (or
           proxy) is encrypted. Note that the encryption does not prevent an attacker from knowing which server
           (or proxy) apt is communicating with and deeper analysis can potentially still reveal which data was
           downloaded. If this is a concern the Tor-based schemes mentioned further below might be a suitable
           alternative.

       <b>mirror</b>, <b>mirror+</b><u>scheme</u> (<b><a href="../man1/apt-transport-mirror.1.html">apt-transport-mirror</a></b>(1))
           The mirror scheme specifies the location of a mirrorlist. By default the scheme used for the location
           is http, but any other scheme can be used via <b>mirror+</b><u>scheme</u>. The mirrorlist itself can contain many
           different URIs for mirrors the APT client can transparently pick, choose and fallback between
           intended to help both with distributing the load over the available mirrors and ensuring that clients
           can acquire data even if some configured mirrors are not available.

       <b>file</b>
           The file scheme allows an arbitrary directory in the file system to be considered an archive. This is
           useful for NFS mounts and local mirrors or archives.

       <b>cdrom</b>
           The cdrom scheme allows APT to use a local CD-ROM, DVD or USB drive with media swapping. Use the <b><a href="../man8/aptcdrom.8.html">apt-</a></b>

       <b>copy</b>
           The copy scheme is identical to the file scheme except that packages are copied into the cache
           directory instead of used directly at their location. This is useful for people using removable media
           to copy files around with APT.

       adding more recognizable URI types
           APT can be extended with more methods shipped in other optional packages, which should follow the
           naming scheme apt-transport-<u>method</u>. For instance, the APT team also maintains the package
           apt-transport-tor, which provides access methods for HTTP and HTTPS URIs routed via the Tor network.

       Uses the archive stored locally (or NFS mounted) at /home/apt/debian for stable/main, stable/contrib,
       stable/non-free and stable/non-free-firmware.

           deb file:/home/apt/debian stable main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

           Types: deb
           URIs: file:/home/apt/debian
           Suites: stable
           Components: main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

       As above, except this uses the unstable (development) distribution.

           deb file:/home/apt/debian unstable main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

           Types: deb
           URIs: file:/home/apt/debian
           Suites: unstable
           Components: main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

       Sources specification for the above.

           deb-src file:/home/apt/debian unstable main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

           Types: deb-src
           URIs: file:/home/apt/debian
           Suites: unstable
           Components: main contrib non-free non-free-firmware

       The first line gets package information for the architectures in APT::Architectures while the second
       always retrieves amd64 and armel.

           deb <a href="http://deb.debian.org/debian">http://deb.debian.org/debian</a> trixie main
           deb [ arch=amd64,armel ] <a href="http://deb.debian.org/debian">http://deb.debian.org/debian</a> trixie main

           Suites: trixie
           Components: main
           Architectures: amd64 armel

       Uses HTTP to access the archive at archive.debian.org, and uses only the hamm/main area.

           deb <a href="http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive">http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive</a> hamm main

           Types: deb
           URIs: <a href="http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive">http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive</a>
           Suites: hamm
           Components: main

       Uses HTTPS to access the archive at deb.debian.org, under the debian directory, and uses only the
       trixie/contrib area.

           deb https://deb.debian.org/debian trixie contrib

           Types: deb
           URIs: https://deb.debian.org/debian
           Suites: trixie
           Components: contrib

       Uses HTTPS to access the archive at deb.debian.org, under the debian directory, and uses only the
       unstable/contrib area. If this line appears as well as the one in the previous example in sources.list a
       single HTTPS session will be used for both resource lines.

           deb https://deb.debian.org/debian unstable contrib

           Types: deb
           URIs: https://deb.debian.org/debian
           Suites: unstable
           Components: contrib

       Uses HTTP to access the archive at ftp.tlh.debian.org, under the universe directory, and uses only files
       found under unstable/binary-i386 on i386 machines, unstable/binary-amd64 on amd64, and so forth for other
       supported architectures. [Note this example only illustrates how to use the substitution variable;
       official debian archives are not structured like this]

           deb <a href="http://ftp.tlh.debian.org/universe">http://ftp.tlh.debian.org/universe</a> unstable/binary-$(ARCH)/

           Types: deb
           URIs: <a href="http://ftp.tlh.debian.org/universe">http://ftp.tlh.debian.org/universe</a>
           Suites: unstable/binary-$(ARCH)/

       Uses HTTP to get binary packages as well as sources from the stable, testing and unstable suites and the
       components main and contrib.

           deb <a href="http://deb.debian.org/debian">http://deb.debian.org/debian</a> stable main contrib
