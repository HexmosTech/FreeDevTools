       VLLog - Traces Volume Location Server operations

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>VLLog</u> file records a trace of Volume Location (VL) Server (<b>vlserver</b> process) operations on the local
       machine and describes any error conditions it encounters.

       If the <u>VLLog</u> file does not already exist in the <u>/var/log/openafs</u> directory when the VL Server starts, the
       server process creates it and writes initial start-up messages to it.

       The file is in ASCII format. Administrators listed in the <u>/etc/openafs/server/UserList</u> file can use the
       <b>bos</b> <b>getlog</b> command to display its contents. Alternatively, log onto the server machine and use a text
       editor or a file display command such as the UNIX <b>cat</b> command. By default, the mode bits on the <u>VLLog</u>
       file grant the required "r" (read) permission to all users.

       The VL Server records operations only as it completes them, and cannot recover from failures by reviewing
       the file. The log contents are useful for administrative evaluation of process failures and other
       problems.

       The VL Server can record messages at several levels of detail. By default, it records only very
       rudimentary messages.  The initial level of detail logged by the VL Server can be set by using the <b>-d</b>
       command line option (possibly multiple times) when it is started.

       To increase the level of detail logged by a running VL Server, issue the following command while logged
       onto the database server machine as the local superuser "root".

          # kill -TSTP &lt;vlserver_pid&gt;

       where &lt;vlserver_pid&gt; is the process ID of the vlserver process, as reported in the output from the
       standard UNIX <b>ps</b> command. To increase to the second and third levels of detail, repeat the command.

       To disable logging, issue the following command.

          # kill -HUP &lt;vlserver_pid&gt;

       To decrease the level of logging, first completely disable it and then issue the "kill -TSTP" command as
       many times as necessary to reach the desired level.
