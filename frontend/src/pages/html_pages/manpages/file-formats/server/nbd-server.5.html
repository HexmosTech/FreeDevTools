</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/nbd-server/config - configuration file for nbd-server

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/nbd-server/config</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This file allows to configure the nbd-server.

       While  <u>/etc/nbd-server/config</u> is the default configuration file, this can be varied with the <b>-C</b> option to
       <b><a href="../man1/nbd-server.1.html">nbd-server</a></b>(1).

       The configuration file consists of section header lines, comment lines, and option lines.

       A section header is a unique name that is enclosed in square brackets ("[" and  "]").  A  section  header
       denotes  the  beginning  of a section; a section continues until the next section or the end of the file,
       whichever is first. The first section in the configuration file must be called <b>generic</b>, and is  used  for
       global  options that apply to more than one export. This section must always be present, even if it holds
       no options. Every other section defines one export; the names of these sections are not important, except
       that you should take care to make sure that each section name is unique. The section name is used as  the
       name  for the export in case the client connects with a name rather than a port to specify an export, and
       must therefore be unique.

       A comment line is a line that starts with optional whitespace,  followed  by  a  pound  sign  ("#"),  and
       continues until the end of the line. Comments may <b>not</b> be used on option lines or section header lines.

       An  option  line is a line that starts with an option name, followed by an equals sign ("="), followed by
       the option value. An option can be of type string, of type integer, or of type boolean. The  value  of  a
       boolean  option can be denoted with either true or false (so not yes, no, on, off, 1, or 0). All booleans
       default to false unless specified otherwise. No value may be quoted; always  enter  it  directly.  For  a
       string option, leading whitespace is stripped (but trailing whitespace is not).

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>SECTION</b> <b>[GENERIC]</b></h4><pre>
       <b>allowlist</b>
              Optional; boolean

              Whether  to  allow  the client to fetch a list of exports from this server. If enabled, the client
              can run <b>nbd-client</b> <b>-l</b> to get a list of exports on this server.

       <b>cacertfile</b>
              Optional; string

              If this option is set, it should contain a path to a PEM format  X.509  CA  certificate  used  for
              validating  client  certificates  supplied  by  the  client. If this option is not set then client
              certificates will not be checked.

       <b>certfile</b>
              Optional; string

              If this option is set, it should contain a path to a PEM format X.509 public certificate used  for
              TLS  negotiation  with the client. If <b>keyfile</b> is set but <b>certfile</b> is not set, then the server will
              attempt to read the certificate from the path specified by <b>keyfile</b>.

       <b>force_tls</b>
              Optional; boolean.

              Switch the server to FORCEDTLS mode.

              Note: this is  <b>not</b>  the  same  as  enabling  the  force_tls  option  for  each  and  every  export
              individually.   The  latter  will allow certain options to be issued during negotiation (e.g., the
              "list exports" option, even if that would return an  empty  result  set),  whereas  enabling  this
              option  will  disallow  the  use  of  <b>any</b>  option  to be issued during negotiation, apart from the
              STARTTLS option itself (to switch the transport to TLS).

              Using FORCEDTLS mode should result in a safer environment,  as  the  server  will  not  allow  any
              communication  to  take  place unless and until TLS has been negotiated. However, it also makes it
              impossible to set up a nonencrypted export for the benefit of older clients, or for  clients  that
              want to swap and not deadlock.

              Using  this  parameter  without  also  specifying  a value for the other TLS-related parameters is
              possible, but silly.

       <b>group</b>  Optional; string.

              The name of the group this server must run as. If this parameter is not specified, then nbd-server
              will not attempt to change its GID (so the GID it runs as will be the primary group  of  the  user
              who  starts  nbd-server).  If  it  is specified, then nbd-server will change its GID after opening
              ports, but before accepting connections or opening files.

       <b>includedir</b>
              Optional; string

              The argument should be a directory containing files with the '.conf' extension; these  files  will
              be  parsed  as  if  they  were part of the configuration file. Note that these extra configuration
              files cannot contain a [generic] section; any configuration that should go in the generic  section
              must be placed in the main configuration file.

              If  this argument is not specified, then no directory will be searched. If it is specified but the
              directory does not exist, then nbd-server will exit with an appropriate error message;  if  it  is
              specified but the given directory is empty, nbd-server will continue (unless no exports whatsoever
              have been configured, in which case it will exit with an appropriate error message)

       <b>keyfile</b>
              Optional; string

              If  this  option  is  set, it should contain a path to a PEM format X.509 private key used for TLS
              negotiation with the client. This option must be set to enable TLS.

       <b>listenaddr</b>
              Optional; string

              If this option is set, it should contain a comma-separated lis of the local IP addresses on  which
              we  should  listen  to <b><a href="../man8/nbd-client.8.html">nbd-client</a></b>(8) connections. If it is not set, <b>nbd-server</b> will listen to "::,
              0.0.0.0", which causes nbd-server to listen to all local IPv4 and  IPv6  addresses.  To  limit  to
              IPv6, specify the address as "::". To limit to IPv4, specify as "0.0.0.0".

       <b>max_threads</b>
              Optional; integer; default 4

              Since  NBD  3.12,  nbd-server  will  read  requests in a main thread, but do the handling of these
              requests, and the sending of the reply, in a number of separate worker threads, which  are  shared
              among all exports. With this parameter, you can configure the number of these worker threads.

              The default should be reasonable for a dual-core single-disk server. You might want to increase it
              if you have a powerful server that does little else than serving NBD.

       <b>oldstyle</b>
              Optional; boolean

              In  versions  of nbd-server between 2.9.17 and 3.9.1, when this option was set to true, nbd-server
              would export all exports on a separate port with the old (pre-2.9.17) handshake protocol. In  that
              case, the 'port' option for individual exports was mandatory.

              Since  version 3.10 of nbd-server, however, this option is no longer supported, and any attempt to
              use it will result in nbd-server exiting with an appropriate error message.

       <b>port</b>   Optional; string

              The port on which to listen for new-style nbd-client connections.  If  not  specified,  the  IANA-
              assigned port of 10809 is used.

       <b>splice</b> Optional; boolean

              Allow  the  server  to  use  the splice() system call to handle read or write calls when possible.
              Using splice can speed up handling of such calls significantly. Unfortunately,  splice  cannot  be
              used in combination with TLS or the copyonwrite mode, and will only work for requests smaller than
              1MiB.

              To  handle  these situations, the server will exit with an appropriate error message if splice and
              copyonwrite are both enabled for an export; it will silently ignore the splice option  if  TLS  is
              enabled,  falling back on normal reads and writes; and it will similarly fall back on normal reads
              when the request size exceeds 1MiB.

       <b>user</b>   Optional; string.

              The name of the user this server must run as. If this parameter is not specified, then  nbd-server
              will not attempt to change its UID (so the UID it runs as will be the user who starts nbd-server).
              If  it is specified, then nbd-server will change its UID after opening ports, but before accepting
              connections or opening files.

       <b>unixsock</b>
              Optional; string

              Path for a UNIX domain socket.

              If specified, the server will listen on a  UNIX  domain  socket  with  the  specified  name.  Only
              newstyle  negotiation  is  supported  on UNIX domain sockets. If a UNIX domain socket is, then the
              server will not listen for TCP connections.

       <b>duallisten</b>
              Optional; boolean

              If true, and <b>unixsock</b> is specified, the the server will listen on both the configured UNIX  domain
              socket and any configured TCP or SDP socket.  Defaults to false.

       <b>tlsprio</b>
              Optional; string; default NORMAL:-VERS-TLS-ALL:+VERS-TLS1.2:%SERVER_PRECEDENCE

              This option allows to configure the GnuTLS priority string, which is used to select the algorithms
              which  GnuTLS will allow to be negotiated with the client. The NBD STARTTLS specification requires
              that clients and servers require TLS1.2 or higher by default, so the default string  disables  all
              older versions of the TLS protocol.

              Not  all  versions  of GnuTLS support the %SERVER_PRECEDENCE flag, which exists to signal that the
              server should pay no attention to the algorithm preferences selected  by  the  client.  If  you're
              using  an  older  version of GnuTLS (e.g., 2.12), it may be necessary to specify a priority string
              that does not include the %SERVER_PRECEDENCE flag.

              For an explanation of the possible values of this option, see the "Priority  strings"  chapter  in
              the GnuTLS documentation.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>EXPORT</b> <b>SECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>authfile</b>
              Optional; string; default empty

              The  name  of  the  authorization  file for this export. This file should contain one line per IP-
              address, or per network (which must be specified in CIDR-style <u>network</u><b>/</b><u>masklen</u>).  Empty lines  are
              skipped, as is any content behind a hashmark ('#') on any line.

              If  the  file  does  not  exist, everyone is allowed to connect.  If the file exists but is empty,
              nobody is allowed to connect. Otherwise, <b>nbd-server</b> will only allow clients to connect  whose  IP-
              adres is listed in this file.

              Corresponds  to  the  <b>-l</b>  option on the command line. However, note that for the command line, the
              default is <u>/etc/nbd-server/allow</u>.

       <b>copyonwrite</b>
              Optional; boolean.

              Whether this is a copy-on-write export. If it is, then any writes  to  this  export  will  not  be
              written  to  the  master  file,  but to a separate file which will be removed upon disconnect. The
              result of using this option is that nbd-server will be somewhat slower, and that any  writes  will
              be lost upon disconnect.

              Corresponds to the <b>-c</b> option on the command line

       <b>cowdir</b> Optional; string.

              Specifies  where  to write copy-on-write diff files. If this option is absent, copy-on-write files
              will be written in the same directory as the base export file. Useful for exporting files in copy-
              on-write mode from a directory that the user running nbd-server has no write access to.

              If the copy-on-write mode is not active, this option has no effect.

       <b>exportname</b>
              Required; string.

              The name of the file (or block device) that will be exported. This must be a fully-qualified  path
              and  filename;  relative  paths  are  not allowed. If used in conjunction with the <b>temporary</b>, this
              specifies a template for the temporary file concerned,  and  thus  can  be  used  to  control  the
              directory it is created in. If the file does not exist, but <b>filesize</b> is set, then the file will be
              created.

              Note  that  <b>nbd-server</b>  will  only  try  to find and open the exported file when a client actually
              connects; as a result, <b>nbd-server</b> must be able to open and read this file <b>after</b>  changing  to  the
              user  and  group  that  have been specified by use of the <b>user</b> and <b>group</b> options; also, <b>nbd-server</b>
              will only detect errors in this option upon connection of a client.

              When specified on the command line, this should be the second argument.

              <b>Note:</b> this is <b>not</b> the "exportname" as defined in the protocol document, and which is the name that
              <b>nbd-client</b> needs to pass to select the correct export; the section name is used for that. The name
              of the file to be exported is called the exportname  in  the  configuration  file  for  historical
              reasons, and cannot easily be changed.

       <b>filesize</b>
              Optional; integer; default autodetected.

              Disable  autodetection  of  file  or block device size, and forcibly specify a size. Sizes must be
              specified in bytes. If the <b>multifile</b> option is in effect, this option specifies the  size  of  the
              <b>entire</b>  export,  not  of individual files. If the file is not present, a single file is created of
              this size.

              When specified on the command line, this should be the third argument.

       <b>flush</b>  Optional; boolean.

              When this option is enabled, <b>nbd-server</b> will inform the client that it supports and desires to  be
              sent  flush  requests when the elevator layer receives them. Receipt of a flush request will cause
              an fdatasync() (or, if the sync option is set, an fsync()) on the backend storage. This  increases
              reliability  in  the  case  of an unclean shutdown at the expense of a degradation of performance.
              This option will have no effect unless supported by the client.

       <b>force_tls</b>
              Optional; boolean.

              Require the use of TLS for this export to be available.

              When this option has been enabled for an export, clients that do not negotiate TLS  will  not  see
              the export when they request a list of exports, and will not be able to connect to it.

              Enabling  this  option  when  TLS credentials have not been configured in the [generic] section is
              possible, but silly.

       <b>fua</b>    Optional; boolean.

              When this option is enabled, <b>nbd-server</b> will inform the client that it supports and desires to  be
              sent  fua  (force  unit access) commands when the elevator layer receives them. Receipt of a force
              unit access command will cause the specified  command  to  be  synced  to  backend  storage  using
              sync_file_range()  if  supported, or fdatasync() otherwise. This increases reliability in the case
              of an unclean shutdown at the expense of a degradation of performance. This option  will  have  no
              effect unless supported by the client.

       <b>listenaddr</b>
              Optional; string

              Ignored, kept for compatibility with the obsolete 'oldstyle' global parameter.

       <b>maxconnections</b>
              Optional; integer

              If specified, then it limits the number of opened connections for this export.

       <b>multifile</b>
              Optional; boolean.

              If   this   option   is  set  to  true,  then  <b>nbd-server</b>  will  search  for  files  of  the  form
              <u>exportname</u>.<u>integer</u>, with <u>exportname</u> being the filename that would otherwise have been used  (after
              name transformation for virtualization, if any, has been performed) and <u>integer</u> an integer number,
              starting with 0 and ending when no more files can be found.

              The  size  of  the  individual  files  will  be autodetected, <b>even</b> if the <b>filesize</b> option has been
              specified.

              Corresponds to the <b>-m</b> option on the command line.

       <b>treefiles</b>
              Optional; boolean.

              If  this  option  is  set  to  true,  then  <b>nbd-server</b>  will  search  for  files   of   the   form
              <u>exportname</u>/<u>TREEXXXX</u>/.../<u>FILEXXXX</u>,  with  <u>exportname</u>  being  the filename that would otherwise have
              been used (after name transformation for virtualization, if any, has been performed) and  <u>TREEXXXX</u>
              and <u>FILEXXXX</u> being autogenerated directory and path names for individual block files.

              Files and directories are automatically created.  Files will be deleted if the corresponding block
              gets marked as unused.  The size of the individual block files is fixed to 4096 bytes.  There will
              be  at  most  1024 files/subdirectories per folder.  An apropriate nesting level of subdirectories
              will be created to create a filesystem of <b>filesize</b> bytes in total forming a virtual block device.

              This feature is useful to provide a virtual block device on an underlying filesystem that does not
              handle large files well, for example fuse/ftpfs, davfs or other network filesytems.

              This feature is mutually exclusive with the <b>-m</b> and will take precedence if both are given.   There
              is  no corresponding command line option, since command line control is considered deprecated. You
              can however specify a custom config file  with  the  <b>-C</b>  option.   The  <b>filesize</b>  option  <b>must</b>  be
              specified when using this feature!

       <b>postrun</b>
              Optional; string

              If  specified, then it is assumed to be a command that will be ran when a client has disconnected.
              This can be useful to clean up whatever <b>prerun</b> has set up, to log something, or similar.

              If the literal string '%s' is present in the command, it will be replaced by the  file  name  that
              has just been closed.

              In contrast to the <b>prerun</b> option, the exit state of <b>postrun</b> is <b>ignored</b>.

       <b>prerun</b> Optional; string

              If  specified,  then  this command will be ran after a client has connected to the server (and has
              been accepted), but before the server starts serving. If the command contains the  literal  string
              '%s',  then  this  string  will  be replaced by the filename of the file which nbd-server wants to
              export.

              This is useful to create export files on the fly, or to verify that a file can be used for export,
              to write something to a log file, or similar.

              If the command runs with a nonzero exit status, then nbd-server will assume the export will  fail,
              and refuse to serve it.

       <b>readonly</b>
              Optional; boolean.

              Disallow  writes to the device. If this option is specified, <b>nbd-server</b> will issue an error to any
              client that tries to write to the device.

              Use of this option in conjunction with <b>copyonwrite</b> is possible, but silly.

              Corresponds to the <b>-r</b> option on the command line.

       <b>rotational</b>
              Optional; boolean.

              When this option is enabled, <b>nbd-server</b> will inform the client that it would  prefer  it  to  send
              requests  in elevator (i.e., optimized) order, perhaps because it has a backing store and no local
              elevator. By default, the client uses QUEUE_FLAG_NONROT, which effectively restricts the  function
              of  the  elevator  to block merges. By specifying this flag on the server, the client will not use
              QUEUE_FLAG_NONROT, meaning the client elevator  will  perform  normal  elevator  ordering  of  I/O
              requests. Note that even when the backing store is on rotating media, it is not normally necessary
              to  specify this flag, as the server's elevator algorithm will be used. This flag is only required
              where the server will not be using an elevator  algorithm  or  where  the  elevator  algorithm  is
              effectively  neutered  (e.g.  with  the  sync  option set). This option will have no effect unless
              supported by the client.

       <b>sdp</b>    Optional; boolean.

              When this option is enabled, <b>nbd-server</b> will use the Socket Direct Protocol  (SDP)  to  serve  the
              export, rather than just IP. This is faster, but requires special hardware (usually something like
              InfiniBand) and support in the kernel.

              Additionally,  support  for  this  option  must be enabled at compile time, using the <b>--enable-sdp</b>
              option to the <b>configure</b> script. If this option is found in a  configuration  file  and  <b>nbd-server</b>
              does not have support for SDP, then <b>nbd-server</b> will exit with an error message.

       <b>sparse_cow</b>
              Optional; boolean.

              When  this  option  is  enabled,  <b>nbd-server</b>  will use sparse files to implement the copy-on-write
              option; such files take up less space then they appear to, which allows <b>nbd-server</b> to  handle  the
              file as if it was just as large as the block device it's for.

              If  this option is disabled, <b>nbd-server</b> will map every newly written block to the end of the copy-
              on-write file, which means that <b>nbd-server</b> will have to <a href="../man2/lseek.2.html">lseek</a>(2) to the right position after every
              4096-byte block.

              Using this option may be faster when much is being written during a connection.

       <b>sync</b>   Optional; boolean.

              When this option is enabled, <b>nbd-server</b> will call an fsync() after  every  write  to  the  backend
              storage.  Calling fsync() increases reliability in case of an unclean shutdown of nbd-server; but,
              depending on the file system used on the nbd-server side, may degrade performance. The use of this
              option isn't always necessary; e.g., on ext3  filesystems,  it  is  recommended  that  it  is  <b>not</b>
              enabled,  since  it  seriously  reduces  performance  on  ext3  filesystems  while not importantly
              impacting reliability.

       <b>temporary</b>
              Optional; boolean.

              Create a temporary export with a name based on exportname (this can be used to set the directory).
              A unique filename is created, which is unlinked as soon as it is created, and therefore the export
              will not persist between invocations of <b>nbd-server</b>. Set the size of the file  using  the  <b>filesize</b>
              option. This option is incompatible with the <b>multifile</b> option.

              When specified on the command line, this should be the third argument.

       <b>timeout</b>
              Optional; integer; default 0

              How  many seconds a connection may be idle for this export. When a connection is idle for a longer
              time, <b>nbd-server</b> will forcibly disconnect the connection. If you specify 0 (the default),  then  a
              connection may be idle forever.

              Corresponds to the <b>-a</b> option on the command line

       <b>transactionlog</b>
              Optional; string

              If  specified,  then  this  pathname is used to generate a transaction log. A transaction log is a
              binary file consisting of the requests sent to  and  the  replies  received  by  the  server,  but
              excluding any data (so, for a write command, it records the offset and length of the write but not
              the  data  written). It is therefore relatively safe to distribute to a third party. Note that the
              transaction log does not include the negotiation sequence. Transaction logs are mainly useful  for
              debugging.  The  program <b>nbd-tester-client</b> distributed with the source to this program can reply a
              transaction log against a server and perform a data integrity test. Note that the transaction  log
              is  written  to  for every client opened. If it is necessary to maintain separate transaction logs
              for each client, the <b>prerun</b> script should rename the transaction log (which will  just  have  been
              opened in order to avoid transaction logs overwriting eachother. This action should be race-free.

       <b>trim</b>   Optional; boolean

              When  this  option is activated, the server announces it supports the NBD_CMD_TRIM command for the
              export. This command allows the server to discard the data from the disk, but does not require  it
              to.

       <b>virtstyle</b>
              Optional; string; default "ipliteral"

              Defines  the  style  of  virtualization.  Virtualization allows one to create one export that will
              serve a different file depending on the IP address that  is  connecting.  When  virtualization  is
              active,  the  <u>exportname</u> parameter needs to contain the string '%s'; this will then be replaced by
              the IP address of the client connecting, in accordance with the option selected here.  The  result
              of this transformation is then used as the filename to be opened.

              When  a  client connects over a UNIX domain socket, the literal string "unix" is used in lieu of a
              client IP address.

              There are four types of virtualization that <b>nbd-server</b> supports:

              <b>none</b>   No virtualization. Will attempt to open the filename as it was written, even if it contains
                     '%s' in the name.

              <b>ipliteral</b>
                     The %s is replaced by the IP address of the connecting host is used as-is.  For IPv4,  this
                     is done in dotted-quad notation; for IPv6, in hexadecimal form with leading zeros omitted.

                     As  an  example,  if  a  client  connects from 192.168.1.100 and <b>exportname</b> is specified as
                     <u>/export/%s</u>, then nbd-server will attempt to serve <u>/export/192.168.1.100</u>. For IPv6,  with  a
                     client      connecting     from     2001:6f8:32f::39,     the     filename     would     be
                     <u>/export/2001:6f8:32f:0:0:0:0:39</u>

              <b>iphash</b> Same as above, except that <b>nbd-server</b> will replace the dots in the IP  address  by  forward
                     slashes ('/'); in the same example, <b>nbd-server</b> would open <u>/export/192/168/1/100</u> instead.

                     Since  there  are no dots in most IPv6 addresses, the effect of using this option when IPv6
                     is in use is indistinguishable from the ipliteral option. It was  thought  that  having  to
                     create an eight-deep directory structure would not be as useful.

              <b>cidrhash</b>
                     This  option  requires  one  to  add a space and a number after it. <b>nbd-server</b> will use the
                     number as a network mask in CIDR style, and use that as a hash cutoff point. In  the  above
                     example,  if  <b>virtstyle</b> has been specified as cidrhash 16, then <b>nbd-server</b> will try to open
                     <u>/export/192.168.0.0/192.168.1.100</u>; if <b>virtstyle</b> were specified as cidrhash  26,  then  <b>nbd-</b>
                     <b>server</b> will try to open <u>/export/192.168.1.64/192.168.1.100</u>.

                     For   IPv6,   in   the   above   example,   with   cidrhash   42,  the  filename  would  be
                     <u>/export/2001:32f:6c0:0:0:0:0:0/2001:32f:6f8:0:0:0:0:39</u>.

       <b>tlsonly</b>
              Optional; boolean.

              When this option is enabled, <b>nbd-server</b> will only serve the export using  the  TLS  extension.  If
              this  option  is  not  supplied, TLS is optional, unless <b>tlsonly</b> is set in the generic section. In
              order for TLS to work at all, the <b>keyfile</b> option must be specified in the generic section.

       <b>waitfile</b>
              Optional; string.

              When this option is set, <b>nbd-server</b> will allow writes to this export, but  not  reads,  until  the
              server  is sent a SIGUSR1 command. Any writes to the export will be stored in a diff file with the
              same algorithm as for the copy-on-write option. In particular, this means that the  <b>cowdir</b>  option
              is in effect for this option, too.

              The backend file (as per the exportname parameter) need not exist until the SIGUSR1 signal is sent
              to the server.

              Once  SIGUSR1  is  received,  <b>nbd-server</b>  will  open  the  main export file, and start merging all
              outstanding writes into it. Once this operation finishes, the diff file will be removed,  and  the
              server will allow normal use of the export.

              This allows the out-of-band live migration of an export from one server to another.

              Note that this option cannot be combined with the copy-on-write option itself.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       A simple <b>nbd-server</b> configuration file would look like this:

             [generic]
             [export]
                 exportname = /export/blkdev

       For increased security, one might want to create an authorization file, and set the UID and  GID  to  run
       as:

             [generic]
                 user = nbd
                 group = nbd
             [export]
                 exportname = /export/blkdev
                 authfile = /etc/nbd-server/allow

       With /etc/nbd-server/allow containing the following:

             127.0.0.1
             192.168.0.0/8
