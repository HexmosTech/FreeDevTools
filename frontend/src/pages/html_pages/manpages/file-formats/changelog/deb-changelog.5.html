</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       deb-changelog - dpkg source packages' changelog file format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>debian/changelog</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Changes in the packaged version of a project are explained in the changelog file <u>debian/changelog</u>.  This
       includes modifications made in the source package compared to the upstream one as well as other changes
       and updates to the package.

       The format of the <u>debian/changelog</u> allows the package building tools to discover which version of the
       package is being built and find out other release-specific information.

       That format is a series of entries like this:

        <u>package</u> (<u>version</u>) <u>distributions</u>; <u>metadata</u>
                 [optional blank line(s), stripped]
         * <u>change-details</u>
           <u>more-change-details</u>
                 [blank line(s), included in <b><a href="../man1/dpkg-parsechangelog.1.html">dpkg-parsechangelog</a></b>(1) output]
         * <u>even-more-change-details</u>
                 [optional blank line(s), stripped]
         -- <u>maintainer-name</u> &lt;<u>email-address</u>&gt;  <u>date</u>

       <u>package</u> and <u>version</u> are the source package name and version number.  <u>version</u> is delimited by parenthesis
       U+00028 ‘<b>(</b>’ and U+0029 ‘<b>)</b>’.

       <u>distributions</u> lists one or more space-separated distributions where this version should be installed when
       it is uploaded; it is copied to the <b>Distribution</b> field in the <u>.changes</u> file.  <u>distributions</u> must be
       terminated by a semicolon (U+003B ‘<b>;</b>’).

       <u>metadata</u> lists zero or more comma-separated <u>keyword</u>=<u>value</u> items.  Each keyword can contain only minus and
       case insensitive alphanumeric characters, as they need to be mapped to <b><a href="../man5/deb822.5.html">deb822</a></b>(5) field names.  The only
       <u>keyword</u>s currently supported by <b>dpkg</b> are:

       <b>urgency</b>
           Its value is used for the <b>Urgency</b> field in the <u>.changes</u> file for the upload.

       <b>binary-only</b>
           With  a <b>yes</b> value, it is used to denote that this changelog entry is for a binary-only non-maintainer
           upload (an automatic binary rebuild with the only change being the changelog entry).

       The change details may in fact be any series of lines starting with at least two spaces  (U+0020  <b>SPACE</b>),
       but  conventionally each change starts with an asterisk and a separating space and continuation lines are
       indented so as to bring them in line with the start of the text above.  Blank lines may be used  here  to
       separate groups of changes, if desired.

       If  this upload resolves bugs recorded in the distribution bug tracking system, they may be automatically
       closed on the inclusion of this package into the distribution archive by including the string:

           <b>Closes:</b> <b>#</b><u>nnnnn</u>

       in the change details, where <b>#</b><u>nnnnn</u> is the bug number.  The exact Perl regular expression is:

           <b>/closes:\s*(?:bug)?\#?\s?\d+(?:,\s*(?:bug)?\#?\s?\d+)*/i</b>

       That is, the string should consist of the word <b>closes:</b> followed by a comma-separated list of bug numbers.
       Bug numbers may be preceded by the word <b>bug</b> and/or a <b>#</b> sign, as in "Closes: 42,  bug#43,  #44,  bug  45".
       The words <b>closes:</b> and <b>bug</b> are not case sensitive.  The list of bug numbers may span multiple lines.

       This  information is conveyed via the <b>Closes</b> field in the <u>.changes</u> file.  Where, depending on the archive
       maintenance software, all the bug numbers listed might get automatically closed.

       The maintainer name and email address used in the changelog should be  the  details  of  the  person  who
       prepared  this  release  of the package.  They are <b>not</b> necessarily those of the uploader or usual package
       maintainer.  The information here will be copied to the <b>Changed-By</b> field in the <u>.changes</u> file,  and  then
       later  might  be  used  to  send an acknowledgment when the upload has been installed in the distribution
       archive.

       The <u>date</u> has the following format (compatible and with the same semantics of RFC2822 and RFC5322, or what
       «date -R» generates):

           <u>day-of-week</u><b>,</b> <u>dd</u> <u>month</u> <u>yyyy</u> <u>hh</u><b>:</b><u>mm</u><b>:</b><u>ss</u> <b>+</b><u>zzzz</u>

       where:

       <u>day-of-week</u>
           Is one of: <b>Mon</b>, <b>Tue</b>, <b>Wed</b>, <b>Thu</b>, <b>Fri</b>, <b>Sat</b>, <b>Sun</b>.

       <u>dd</u>  Is a one- or  two-digit  day  of  the  month  (<b>01</b>-<b>31</b>),  where  the  leading  zero  is  optional,  but
           conventionally does not get omitted.

       <u>month</u>
           Is one of: <b>Jan</b>, <b>Feb</b>, <b>Mar</b>, <b>Apr</b>, <b>May</b>, <b>Jun</b>, <b>Jul</b>, <b>Aug</b>, <b>Sep</b>, <b>Oct</b>, <b>Nov</b>, <b>Dec</b>.

       <u>yyyy</u>
           Is the four-digit year (e.g. 2010).

       <u>hh</u>  Is the two-digit hour (<b>00</b>-<b>23</b>).

       <u>mm</u>  Is the two-digit minutes (<b>00</b>-<b>59</b>).

       <u>ss</u>  Is the two-digit seconds (<b>00</b>-<b>60</b>).

       [<b>+-</b>]<u>zzzz</u>
           Is  the time zone offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  ‘<b>+</b>’ indicates that the time is ahead
           of (i.e., east of) UTC and ‘<b>-</b>’ indicates that the time is behind (i.e., west of) UTC.  The first  two
           digits  indicate  the  hour  difference  from  UTC  and  the  last  two digits indicate the number of
           additional minutes difference from UTC.  The last two digits must be in the range <b>00</b>-<b>59</b>.

       The first “title” line with the package name must start at the left hand margin.  The “trailer” line with
       the maintainer and date details must be preceded by exactly one space  (U+0020  <b>SPACE</b>).   The  maintainer
       details  and  the date must be separated by exactly two spaces (U+0020 <b>SPACE</b>).  Each part of the <u>date</u> can
       be separated by one or more spaces (U+0020 <b>SPACE</b>), except after the comma where it can  be  separated  by
       zero or more spaces (U+0020 <b>SPACE</b>).

       Any  line  that  consists  entirely  (i.e.,  no  leading  whitespace) of <b>#</b> or <b>/*</b> <b>*/</b> style comments or RCS
       keywords.

       Vim modelines or Emacs local variables, and ancient changelog entries with other formats at  the  end  of
       the  file  should  be accepted and preserved on output, but their contents might be otherwise ignored and
       parsing stopped at that point.

       The entire changelog must be encoded in UTF-8.

         [ Guillem Jover ]
         * Handle empty minimum versions when initializing dependency versions,
           as the code is mapping the minimum version 0 to '' to avoid outputting
           useless versions. Regression introduced in dpkg 1.17.17. Closes: #764929

         [ Updated programs translations ]
         * Catalan (Guillem Jover).

         [ Updated dselect translations ]
         * Catalan (Guillem Jover).
