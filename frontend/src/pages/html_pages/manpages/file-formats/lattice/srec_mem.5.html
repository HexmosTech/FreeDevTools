</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       srec_mem - Lattice Memory Initialization format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  Lattice Memory Initialization format (.mem), by Lattice Semiconductor, file is an ASCII text file that
       consists of a header followed by lines of memory data.

   <b>Syntax</b>
       The data must be in one of the  following  formats:  Bin  (binary),  Hex  (hexadecimal),  or  Address‐Hex
       (described below).

       For  hexadecimal  values,  both  upper  and  lower case can be used.  If the data has fewer bits than the
       specified data width, the most significant bits are filled with 0.  Any address  not  specified  will  be
       filled with 0.

       Comments  can be added at any point after the header (defined below) by starting the comment with a pound
       sign (#) or two slashes (//).  The comment then includes everything to the end of the line.  Comments may
       be added to any of the data, but never add comments to the header.

   <b>Header</b>
       A .mem file starts with a header, which declares the file format,  memory  size,  and  address  and  data
       display radix for Memory Generator.  The syntax of the header is:
              #Format=Bin | Hex | AddrHex
              #Depth=1 <u>to</u> 65536
              #Width=1 <u>to</u> 256
              #AddrRadix=<u>index‐number</u>
              #DataRadix=<u>index‐number</u>
              #Data
       The <u>index‐number</u> can be one of the following numbers.  AddrRadix and DataRadix can have different values.
              Binary: 0
              Octal: 1
              Decimal: 2
              Hexadecimal: 3

       For  example, the following header says the .mem file is using the binary format for a 32x8 memory.  When
       displayed in Memory Generator, the address will be shown in hexadecimal and the data  will  be  shown  in
       binary.
              #Format=Bin
              #Depth=32
              #Width=8
              #AddrRadix=3
              #DataRadix=0
              #Data

   <b>Bin</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hex</b> <b>Formats</b>
       The  data  is  represented in binary or hexadecimal format.  Each line of data specifies the contents for
       one memory location, starting with address 0.  That is, the first line is for address 0, the second  line
       is  for  address  1,  and  so on.  For each line, the data is interpreted as least significant bit on the
       right.

       For example, in the Bin format, the following lines will initialize address 0 to “00011011”, address 1 to
       “11111010” (assuming it is a 32x8 memory).
              # for a 32x8 memory
              11011
              11111010

       In the Hex format, the following lines will initialize address 0 to “003B”, address 1 to “FB0A” (assuming
       it is a 32x16 memory).
              # for a 32x16 memory
              3B
              FB0A

   <b>AddrHex</b>
       The data is represented in hexadecimal format.  Each line consists of an address followed by a colon  and
       then any number of data words, separated by spaces:
              <u>address</u><b>:</b> <u>data</u> <u>data&gt;</u> <u>data</u>...
       The data will be applied starting at &lt;address&gt; and filling in sequentially from there.

       For example:
              A0:03 F3 3E 4F
              B2:3B 9F
       will  initialize  A0  with 03, A1 with F3, A2 with 3E, A3 with 4F, B2 with 3B, and B3 with 9F.  The other
       addresses will be initialized to 0.  So A4 through B1 will be set to 0.

   <b>Size</b> <b>Multiplier</b>
       The size multiplier depends on the width selected.  As files grow larger,  their  size  multipliers  will
       approach those in the table, from above.
       Width   Linux   Windows
         8     2.96     3.0
        16     2.47     2.5
        32     2.25     2.28
        64     2.13     2.15

   <b>Byte</b> <b>Order</b>
       This format is implicitly big‐endian.  Use a -byte‐swap filter if you need something different.
