</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dsc - Debian source package control file format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>filename</u><b>.dsc</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Each Debian source package is composed of a .dsc control file, which contains a number of fields, in
       <b><a href="../man5/deb822.5.html">deb822</a></b>(5) format.

       Each field begins with a tag, such as <b>Source</b> or <b>Binary</b> (case insensitive), followed by a colon, and the
       body of the field (case sensitive unless stated otherwise).  Fields are delimited only by field tags.  In
       other words, field text may be multiple lines in length, but the installation tools will generally join
       lines when processing the body of the field (except in case of the multiline fields <b>Package-List</b>, <b>Files</b>,
       <b>Checksums-Sha1</b> and <b>Checksums-Sha256</b>, see below).

       The control data might be enclosed in an OpenPGP ASCII Armored signature, as specified in RFC9580.

</pre><h4><b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Format:</b> <u>format-version</u> (required)
           The  value  of this field declares the format version of the source package.  The field value is used
           by programs acting on a source package to interpret the list of  files  in  the  source  package  and
           determine  how  to  unpack  it.  The syntax of the field value is a numeric major revision (“0-9”), a
           period (“.”), a numeric minor revision (“0-9”), and then an  optional  subtype  after  whitespace  (“
           \t”),  which  if  specified  is  a lowercase alphanumeric (“a-z0-9”) word in parentheses (“()”).  The
           subtype is optional in the syntax but may be mandatory for particular source format revisions.

           The source formats currently supported by <b>dpkg</b> are <b>1.0</b>, <b>2.0</b>, <b>3.0</b> <b>(native)</b>, <b>3.0</b>  <b>(quilt)</b>,  <b>3.0</b>  <b>(git)</b>,
           <b>3.0</b> <b>(bzr)</b> and <b>3.0</b> <b>(custom)</b>.  See <b><a href="../man1/dpkg-source.1.html">dpkg-source</a></b>(1) for their description.

       <b>Source:</b> <u>source-name</u> (required)
           The  value  of  this  field  determines  the package name, and is used to generate file names by most
           installation tools.

       <b>Binary:</b> <u>binary-package-list</u>
           This folded field lists binary packages which this source package can produce, separated by commas.

           This field has now been superseded by the <b>Package-List</b> field, which gives  enough  information  about
           what   binary  packages  are  produced  on  which  architecture,  build-profile  and  other  involved
           restrictions.

       <b>Architecture:</b> <u>arch-list</u> (recommended)
           A list of architectures and architecture wildcards separated by spaces  which  specify  the  type  of
           hardware  this package can be compiled for.  Common architecture names and architecture wildcards are
           <b>amd64</b>, <b>armel</b>, <b>i386</b>, <b>linux-any</b>, <b>any-amd64</b>, etc.

           Note that the <b>all</b> value is meant for packages that are architecture independent, and <b>any</b> for packages
           that are architecture dependent.  The list may include (or consist solely of) the special value  <b>all</b>.
           When  the  list  contains  the architecture wildcard <b>any</b>, the only other value allowed in the list is
           <b>all</b>.

           The field value is generally generated from <b>Architecture</b> fields from in  the  <u>debian/control</u>  in  the
           source package.

       <b>Version:</b> <u>version-string</u> (required)
           Typically,  this is the original package's version number in whatever form the program's author uses.
           It may also include a Debian revision number (for non-native packages).  The exact format and sorting
           algorithm are described in <b><a href="../man7/deb-version.7.html">deb-version</a></b>(7).

       <b>Origin:</b> <u>name</u>
           The name of the distribution this package is originating from.

       <b>Maintainer:</b> <u>fullname-email</u> (recommended)
           Should be in the format “Joe Bloggs &lt;<a href="mailto:jbloggs@foo.com">jbloggs@foo.com</a>&gt;”, and is typically the person who  created  the
           package, as opposed to the author of the software that was packaged.

       <b>Uploaders:</b> <u>fullname-email-list</u>
           Lists  all  the names and email addresses of co-maintainers of the package, in the same format as the
           <b>Maintainer</b> field.  Multiple co-maintainers should be separated by a comma.

       <b>Description</b> <u>short-description</u>
        <u>long-description</u>
           The format for the source package description is a short brief summary on the first line  (after  the
           <b>Description</b> field).  The following lines should be used as a longer, more detailed description.  Each
           line  of  the  long  description must be preceded by a space, and blank lines in the long description
           must contain a single ‘<b>.</b>’ following the preceding space.

       <b>Homepage:</b> <u>url</u>
           The upstream project home page <u>url</u>.

       <b>Standards-Version:</b> <u>version-string</u> (recommended)
           This documents the most recent version of the distribution policy  standards  this  package  complies
           with.

       <b>Vcs-Browser:</b> <u>url</u>
           The <u>url</u> of a web interface to browse the Version Control System repository.

       <b>Vcs-Arch:</b> <u>url</u>
       <b>Vcs-Bzr:</b> <u>url</u>
       <b>Vcs-Cvs:</b> <u>url</u>
       <b>Vcs-Darcs:</b> <u>url</u>
       <b>Vcs-Git:</b> <u>url</u>
       <b>Vcs-Hg:</b> <u>url</u>
       <b>Vcs-Mtn:</b> <u>url</u>
       <b>Vcs-Svn:</b> <u>url</u>
           These  fields declare the <u>url</u> of the Version Control System repository used to maintain this package.
           See <b><a href="../man5/deb-src-control.5.html">deb-src-control</a></b>(5) for more details.

       <b>Testsuite:</b> <u>name-list</u>
           This field declares that the source package contains the specified  test  suites.   The  value  is  a
           comma-separated  list of test suites.  If the <b>autopkgtest</b> value is present, a <u>debian/tests/control</u> is
           expected to be present, if the file is present but not the value, then <b>dpkg-source</b> will automatically
           add it, preserving previous values.

       <b>Testsuite-Triggers:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           This  field  declares  the  comma-separated  union  of  all  test  dependencies  (<b>Depends</b>  fields  in
           <u>debian/tests/control</u>  file),  with  all restrictions removed, and OR dependencies flattened (that is,
           converted to separate AND relationships), except for binaries generated by this  source  package  and
           its meta-dependency equivalent <b>@</b>.

           <b>Rationale</b>:  this  field  is  needed  because  otherwise to be able to get the test dependencies, each
           source package would need to be unpacked.

       <b>Build-Depends:</b> <u>package-list</u>
       <b>Build-Depends-Arch:</b> <u>package-list</u>
       <b>Build-Depends-Indep:</b> <u>package-list</u>
       <b>Build-Conflicts:</b> <u>package-list</u>
       <b>Build-Conflicts-Arch:</b> <u>package-list</u>
       <b>Build-Conflicts-Indep:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           These fields declare relationships between the source package and packages used to  build  it.   They
           are discussed in the <b><a href="../man5/deb-src-control.5.html">deb-src-control</a></b>(5) manual page.

       <b>Package-List:</b>
        <u>package</u> <u>package-type</u> <u>section</u> <u>priority</u> <u>key-value-list</u>
           This multiline field contains a list of binary packages generated by this source package.

           The <u>package</u> is the binary package name.

           The <u>package-type</u> is the binary package type, usually <b>deb</b>, another common value is <b>udeb</b>.

           The  <u>section</u>  and <u>priority</u> match the binary package fields of the same name, or if omitted default to
           <b>unknown</b> and <b>optional</b> respectively (since dpkg 1.22.13).

           The <u>key-value-list</u> is a space separated <u>key</u><b>=</b><u>value</u> list, and the currently known optional keys are:

           <b>arch</b>
               The architecture restriction from the binary package <b>Architecture</b> field, with spaces converted to
               ‘,’.

           <b>profile</b>
               The normalized build-profile restriction formula from the  binary  package  <b>Build-Profile</b>  field,
               with ORs converted to ‘+’ and ANDs to ‘,’.

           <b>protected</b>
               If  the binary package is protected, this key will contain the value of the <b>Protected</b> field, that
               is a <b>yes</b> value.

               Supported since dpkg 1.20.1.

           <b>essential</b>
               If the binary package is essential, this key will contain the value of the <b>Essential</b> field,  that
               is a <b>yes</b> value.

       <b>Files:</b> (required, weak)
       <b>Checksums-Sha1:</b> (required, weak)
       <b>Checksums-Sha256:</b> (required, strong)
        <u>checksum</u> <u>size</u> <u>filename</u>
           These  multiline  fields contain a list of files with a checksum and size for each one.  These fields
           have the same syntax and differ only in the  checksum  algorithm  used:  MD5  for  <b>Files</b>,  SHA-1  for
           <b>Checksums-Sha1</b> and SHA-256 for <b>Checksums-Sha256</b>.

           The  first  line of the field value (the part on the same line as the field name followed by a colon)
           is always empty.  The content of the field is expressed as continuation lines,  one  line  per  file.
           Each line consists of the checksum, a space, the file size, a space, and the file name.

           These  fields list all files that make up the source package.  The list of files in these fields must
           match the list of files in the other related fields.

           <b>Note</b>: The MD5 and SHA-1 checksums are considered weak, and should never be assumed to  be  sufficient
           for secure verification.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>Format</b>  field  conflates  the format for the <b>.dsc</b> file itself and the format of the extracted source
       package.
