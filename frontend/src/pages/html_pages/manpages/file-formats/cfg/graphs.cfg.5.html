       graphs.cfg - Configuration of the showgraph CGI

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$XYMONHOME/etc/graphs.cfg</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man1/showgraph.cgi.1.html">showgraph.cgi</a>(1)</u> uses the configuration file $XYMONHOME/etc/graphs.cfg to build graphs from the RRD files
       collected by Xymon.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Each  definition  of  a  graph  type  begins with a "[SERVICE]" indicator, this is the name passed as the
       "service" parameter to <u><a href="../man1/showgraph.cgi.1.html">showgraph.cgi</a>(1).</u>  If the service name passed to showgraph.cgi is  not  found,  it
       will  attempt  to  match  the  service  name to a graph via the TEST2RRD environment variable. So calling
       showgraph.cgi with "service=cpu" or "service=la" will end up producing the same graph.

       A graph definition needs to have a TITLE and a YAXIS setting. These are texts shown as the title  of  the
       graph, and the YAXIS heading respectively.  (The X-axis is always time-based).

       If a fixed set of RRD files are used for the graph, you just write those in the RRDtool definitions. Note
       that  Xymon  keeps all RRD files for a host in a separate directory per host, so you need not worry about
       the hostname being part of the RRD filename.

       For graphs that use multiple RRD files as  input,  you  specify  a  filename  pattern  in  the  FNPATTERN
       statement,  and optionally a pattern of files to exclude from the graph with EXFNPATTERN (see "[tcp]" for
       an example).  When FNPATTERN is used, you can use "@RRDFN@" in the RRDtool definitions to  pick  up  each
       filename.  "@RRDIDX@"  is  an  index  (starting at 0) for each file in the set. "@RRDPARAM@" contains the
       first word extracted from the pattern of files (see e.g. "[memory]" how this is used). "@COLOR@" picks  a
       new color for each graph automatically.

       The remainder of the lines in each definition are passed directly to the RRDtool rrd_graph() routine.

       The following is an example of how the "la" (cpu) graph is defined. This is a simple definition that uses
       a single RRD-file, la.rrd:

       [la]
               TITLE CPU Load
               YAXIS Load
               DEF:avg=la.rrd:la:AVERAGE
               CDEF:la=avg,100,/
               AREA:la#00CC00:CPU Load Average
               GPRINT:la:LAST:  %5.1lf (cur)
               GPRINT:la:MAX:  %5.1lf (max)
               GPRINT:la:MIN:  %5.1lf (min)
               GPRINT:la:AVERAGE:  %5.1lf (avg)\n

       Here  is an example of a graph that uses multiple RRD-files, determined automatically at run-time via the
       FNPATTERN setting. Note how it uses the @RRDIDX@ to define a unique RRD parameter per input-file, and the
       @COLOR@ and @RRDPARAM@ items to pick unique colors and a matching text for the graph legend:

       [disk]
               FNPATTERN disk(.*).rrd
               TITLE Disk Utilization
               YAXIS % Full
               DEF:p@RRDIDX@=@RRDFN@:pct:AVERAGE
               LINE2:p@RRDIDX@#@COLOR@:@RRDPARAM@
               -u 100
               -l 0
               GPRINT:p@RRDIDX@:LAST:  %5.1lf (cur)
               GPRINT:p@RRDIDX@:MAX:  %5.1lf (max)
               GPRINT:p@RRDIDX@:MIN:  %5.1lf (min)
               GPRINT:p@RRDIDX@:AVERAGE:  %5.1lf (avg)\n

</pre><h4><b>ADVANCED</b> <b>GRAPH</b> <b>TITLES</b></h4><pre>
       Normally the title of a graph is a static text defined in the graphs.cfg  file.  However,  there  may  be
       situations  where  you  want  to  use  different  titles  for  the  same  type of graph, e.g.  if you are
       incorporating RRD files from MRTG into Xymon. In that case you can setup the TITLE definition so that  it
       runs a custom script to determine the graph title. Like this:

            TITLE exec:/usr/local/bin/graphitle

       The <b>/usr/local/bin/graphtitle</b> command is then called with the hostname, the graphtype, the period string,
       and  all  of the RRD files used as parameters. The script must generate one line of output, which is then
       used as the title of the graph. Each of the RRD pathname parameters will be enclosed in double quotes.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>TEST2RRD</b> Maps service names to graph definitions.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Most of the RRD graph definitions shipped with Xymon  have  been  ported  from  the  definitions  in  the
       <b>larrd-grapher.cgi</b> CGI from LARRD 0.43c.
