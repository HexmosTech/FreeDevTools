       slapd-perl - Perl backend to slapd

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/ldap/slapd.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Perl  backend to <b><a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd</a></b>(8) works by embedding a <b><a href="../man1/perl.1.html">perl</a></b>(1) interpreter into <b><a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd</a></b>(8).  Any perl database
       section of the configuration file <b><a href="../man5/slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf</a></b>(5) must then specify what Perl module to  use.   <b>Slapd</b>  then
       creates a new Perl object that handles all the requests for that particular instance of the backend.

       You will need to create a method for each one of the following actions:

         * new        # creates a new object,
         * search     # performs the ldap search,
         * compare    # does a compare,
         * modify     # modifies an entry,
         * add        # adds an entry to backend,
         * modrdn     # modifies an entry's rdn,
         * delete     # deletes an ldap entry,
         * config     # module-specific config directives,
         * init       # called after backend is initialized.

       Unless  otherwise  specified,  the  methods  return the result code which will be returned to the client.
       Unimplemented actions can just return unwillingToPerform (53).

       <b>new</b>    This method is called when the configuration file encounters a <b>perlmod</b> line.  The module  in  that
              line is then effectively `use'd into the perl interpreter, then the <b>new</b> method is called to create
              a  new  object.  Note that multiple instances of that object may be instantiated, as with any perl
              object.  The <b>new</b> method receives the class name as argument.

       <b>search</b> This method is called when a search request comes from a client.  It arguments are as follows:
                * object reference
                * base DN
                * scope
                * alias dereferencing policy
                * size limit
                * time limit
                * filter string
                * attributes only flag (1 for yes)
                * list of attributes to return (may be empty)

       Return value: (resultcode, ldif-entry, ldif-entry, ...)

       <b>compare</b>
              This method is called when a compare request comes from a client.  Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * dn
                * attribute assertion string

       <b>modify</b> This method is called when a modify request comes from a client.  Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * dn
                * a list formatted as follows
                  ({ "ADD" | "DELETE" | "REPLACE" },
                   attributetype, value...)...

       <b>add</b>    This method is called when a add request comes from a client.  Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * entry in string format

       <b>modrdn</b> This method is called when a modrdn request comes from a client.  Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * dn
                * new rdn
                * delete old dn flag (1 means yes)

       <b>delete</b> This method is called when a delete request comes from a client.  Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * dn

       <b>config</b> This method is called once for each perlModuleConfig line in the <b><a href="../man5/slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf</a></b>(5) configuration file.
              Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * array of arguments on line

       Return value: nonzero if this is not a valid option.

       <b>init</b>   This method is called after backend is initialized.  Its argument is as follows.
                * object reference

       Return value: nonzero if initialization failed.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       These <b>slapd.conf</b> options apply to the PERL backend database.  That is, they must follow a "database perl"
       line and come before any subsequent "backend" or "database" lines.  Other database options are  described
       in the <b><a href="../man5/slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf</a></b>(5) manual page.

       <b>perlModulePath</b> <b>/path/to/libs</b>
              Add the path to the @INC variable.

       <b>perlModule</b> <b>ModName</b>
              `Use' the module name ModName from ModName.pm

       <b>filterSearchResults</b>
              Search  results  are  candidates that need to be filtered (with the filter in the search request),
              rather than search results to be returned directly to the client.

       <b>perlModuleConfig</b> <b>&lt;arguments&gt;</b>
              Invoke the module's config method with the given arguments.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       There is an example Perl module `SampleLDAP' in the slapd/back-perl/ directory  in  the  OpenLDAP  source
       tree.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b> <b>CONTROL</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>perl</b>  backend  does  not honor any of the access control semantics described in <b><a href="../man5/slapd.access.5.html">slapd.access</a></b>(5); all
       access control is delegated to the underlying PERL scripting.  Only <b>read</b> <b>(=r)</b> access to the <b>entry</b> pseudo-
       attribute and to the other attribute values of the entries returned by the <b>search</b> operation  is  honored,
       which is performed by the frontend.

</pre><h4><b>WARNING</b></h4><pre>
       The  interface  of  this  backend  to  the  perl  module  MAY  change.   Any suggestions would greatly be
       appreciated.

       Note: in previous versions, any unrecognized lines in  the  slapd.conf  file  were  passed  to  the  perl
       module's  config  method. This behavior is deprecated (but still allowed for backward compatibility), and
       the perlModuleConfig directive should instead  be  used  to  invoke  the  module's  config  method.  This
       compatibility feature will be removed at some future date.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>

              default slapd configuration file
