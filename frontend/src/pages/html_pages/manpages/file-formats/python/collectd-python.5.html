       collectd-python - Documentation of collectd's "python plugin"

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         LoadPlugin python
         # ...
         &lt;Plugin python&gt;
           ModulePath "/path/to/your/python/modules"
           LogTraces true
           Interactive false
           Import "spam"

           &lt;Module spam&gt;
             spam "wonderful" "lovely"
           &lt;/Module&gt;
         &lt;/Plugin&gt;

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The "python plugin" embeds a Python-interpreter into collectd and provides an interface to collectd's
       plugin system. This makes it possible to write plugins for collectd in Python. This is a lot more
       efficient than executing a Python-script every time you want to read a value with the "exec plugin" (see
       <b><a href="../man5/collectd-exec.5.html">collectd-exec</a></b>(5)) and provides a lot more functionality, too.

       The minimum required Python version is <u>2.6</u>.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>LoadPlugin</b> <u>Plugin</u>
           Loads the Python plugin <u>Plugin</u>.

       <b>Encoding</b> <u>Name</u>
           The  default  encoding  for  Unicode  objects  you  pass to collectd. If you omit this option it will
           default to <b>ascii</b> on <u>Python</u> <u>2</u>. On <u>Python</u> <u>3</u> it will always be <b>utf-8</b>, as this function was  removed,  so
           this  will  be  silently  ignored.  These defaults are hardcoded in Python and will ignore everything
           else, including your locale.

       <b>ModulePath</b> <u>Name</u>
           Prepends <u>Name</u> to <b>sys.path</b>. You won't be able to import any scripts you wrote unless they are  located
           in  one  of the directories in this list. Please note that it only has effect on plugins loaded after
           this option. You can use multiple <b>ModulePath</b> lines to add more than one directory.

       <b>LogTraces</b> <u>bool</u>
           If a Python script throws an exception it will be logged by collectd with the name of  the  exception
           and  the  message.  If you set this option to true it will also log the full stacktrace just like the
           default output of an interactive  Python  interpreter.  This  does  not  apply  to  the  CollectError
           exception,  which will never log a stacktrace.  This should probably be set to false most of the time
           but is very useful for development and debugging of new modules.

       <b>Interactive</b> <u>bool</u>
           This option will cause the module to launch an interactive Python interpreter  that  reads  from  and
           writes  to  the terminal. Note that collectd will terminate right after starting up if you try to run
           it as a daemon while this option is enabled so make sure to start collectd with the <b>-f</b> option.

           The <b>collectd</b> module is <u>not</u> imported into the interpreter's globals. You have to do  it  manually.  Be
           sure to read the help text of the module, it can be used as a reference guide during coding.

           This  interactive  session will behave slightly differently from a daemonized collectd script as well
           as from a normal Python interpreter:

           •   <b>1.</b> collectd will try to import the <b>readline</b> module to give you a  decent  way  of  entering  your
               commands. The daemonized collectd won't do that.

           •   <b>2.</b> Python will be handling <u>SIGINT</u>. Pressing <u>Ctrl+C</u> will usually cause collectd to shut down. This
               would  be  problematic  in  an  interactive  session,  therefore  Python  will  be handling it in
               interactive sessions. This allows you to use <u>Ctrl+C</u> to  interrupt  Python  code  without  killing
               collectd.  This  also means you can catch <u>KeyboardInterrupt</u> exceptions which does not work during
               normal operation.

               To quit collectd send <u>EOF</u> (press <u>Ctrl+D</u> at the beginning of a new line).

           •   <b>3.</b> collectd handles <u>SIGCHLD</u>. This means that Python won't be able to determine the return code of
               spawned processes with <b>system()</b>, <b>popen()</b> and subprocess. This will result  in  Python  not  using
               external  programs like less to display help texts. You can override this behavior with the <b>PAGER</b>
               environment variable, e.g. <u>export</u> <u>PAGER=less</u> before starting collectd.  Depending on your version
               of Python this might or might not result in an <b>OSError</b> exception which can be ignored.

               If you really need to spawn new processes from Python you can register an init callback and reset
               the action for SIGCHLD to the default behavior. Please note that this <u>will</u> break the exec plugin.
               Do not even load the exec plugin if you intend to do this!

               There is an example script located in <b>contrib/python/getsigchld.py</b>  to do  this.  If  you  import
               this  from <u>collectd.conf</u> SIGCHLD will be handled normally and spawning processes from Python will
               work as intended.

       <b>Import</b> <u>Name</u>
           Imports the python script <u>Name</u> and loads it into the collectd python process. If your  python  script
           is  not  found,  be  sure  its directory exists in python's <b>sys.path</b>. You can prepend to the <b>sys.path</b>
           using the <b>ModulePath</b> configuration option.

       &lt;<b>Module</b> <u>Name</u>&gt; block
           This block may be used to pass on configuration settings to a Python module.   The  configuration  is
           converted  into  an  instance  of  the  <b>Config</b>  class which is passed to the registered configuration
           callback. See below for details about the <b>Config</b> class and how to register callbacks.

           The <u>name</u> identifies the callback.

</pre><h4><b>STRINGS</b></h4><pre>
       There are a lot of places where strings are sent from collectd to Python and from Python to collectd. How
       exactly this works depends on whether byte or unicode strings or Python2 or Python3 are used.

       Python2 has <u>str</u>, which is just bytes, and <u>unicode</u>. Python3 has <u>str</u>, which is a unicode object, and <u>bytes</u>.

       When passing strings from Python to collectd all of these object are supported in all places, however <u>str</u>
       should be used if possible. These strings must not contain a NUL byte. Ignoring this  will  result  in  a
       <u>TypeError</u>  exception.   If  a byte string was used it will be used as is by collectd. If a unicode object
       was used it will be encoded using the default encoding (see above). If this is not possible  Python  will
       raise a <u>UnicodeEncodeError</u> exception.

       When  passing  strings  from  collectd to Python the behavior depends on the Python version used. Python2
       will always receive a <u>str</u> object. Python3 will usually receive a <u>str</u> object as well, however the original
       string will be decoded to unicode using the default encoding. If this fails because the string is  not  a
       valid sequence for this encoding a <u>bytes</u> object will be returned instead.

</pre><h4><b>WRITING</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>OWN</b> <b>PLUGINS</b></h4><pre>
       Writing  your  own plugins is quite simple. collectd manages plugins by means of <b>dispatch</b> <b>functions</b> which
       call the appropriate <b>callback</b> <b>functions</b> registered by the plugins. Any plugin basically consists  of  the
       implementation  of  these  callback  functions  and  initializing code which registers the functions with
       collectd. See the section "EXAMPLES" below for a really basic example. The following  types  of  <b>callback</b>
       <b>functions</b> are known to collectd (all of them are optional):

       configuration functions
           These  are  called  during  configuration  if an appropriate <b>Module</b> block has been encountered. It is
           called once for each <b>Module</b> block which matches the  name  of  the  callback  as  provided  with  the
           <b>register_config</b> method - see below.

           Python  thread  support  has not been initialized at this point so do not use any threading functions
           here!

       init functions
           These are called once after loading the module and before any calls to the read and write  functions.
           It  should  be used to initialize the internal state of the plugin (e. g. open sockets, ...). This is
           the earliest point where you may use threads.

       read functions
           These are used to collect the actual  data.  It  is  called  once  per  interval  (see  the  <b>Interval</b>
           configuration option of collectd). Usually it will call <b>plugin_dispatch_values</b> to dispatch the values
           to  collectd  which  will pass them on to all registered <b>write</b> <b>functions</b>. If this function throws any
           kind of exception the plugin will be skipped for an  increasing  amount  of  time  until  it  returns
           normally again.

       write functions
           These  are used to write the dispatched values. It is called once for every value that was dispatched
           by any plugin.

       flush functions
           These are used to flush internal caches of plugins. It is usually triggered by  the  user  only.  Any
           plugin which caches data before writing it to disk should provide this kind of callback function.

       log functions
           These are used to pass messages of plugins or the daemon itself to the user.

       notification function
           These  are used to act upon notifications. In general, a notification is a status message that may be
           associated with a data instance.  Usually, a notification is generated by the daemon if a  configured
           threshold  has  been exceeded (see the section "THRESHOLD CONFIGURATION" in <b><a href="../man5/collectd.conf.5.html">collectd.conf</a></b>(5) for more
           details), but any plugin may dispatch notifications as well.

       shutdown functions
           These are called once before the daemon shuts down. It should be used to clean up  the  plugin  (e.g.
           close sockets, ...).

       Any  function  (except  log  functions)  may  throw an exception in case of errors. The exception will be
       passed on to the user using collectd's logging mechanism. If a log callback throws an exception  it  will
       be printed to standard error instead.

       See  the  documentation  of the various <b>register_</b> methods in the section "FUNCTIONS" below for the number
       and types of arguments passed to each <b>callback</b> <b>function</b>. This  section  also  explains  how  to  register
       <b>callback</b> <b>functions</b> with collectd.

       To  enable  a  module, copy it to a place where Python can find it (i. e. a directory listed in <b>sys.path</b>)
       just as any other Python plugin and add an appropriate <b>Import</b> option to  the  configuration  file.  After
       restarting collectd you're done.

</pre><h4><b>CLASSES</b></h4><pre>
       The following complex types are used to pass values between the Python plugin and collectd:

   <b>CollectdError</b>
       This  is  an exception. If any Python script raises this exception it will still be treated like an error
       by collectd but it will be logged as a warning  instead  of  an  error  and  it  will  never  generate  a
       stacktrace.

        class CollectdError(Exception)

       Basic  exception  for collectd Python scripts.  Throwing this exception will not cause a stacktrace to be
       logged, even if LogTraces is enabled in the config.

   <b>Signed</b>
       The Signed class is just a long. It has all its methods and behaves exactly like any other  long  object.
       It is used to indicate if an integer was or should be stored as a signed or unsigned integer object.

        class Signed(long)

       This  is  a  long  by  another name. Use it in meta data dicts to choose the way it is stored in the meta
       data.

   <b>Unsigned</b>
       The Unsigned class is just a long. It has all its methods and behaves exactly like any other long object.
       It is used to indicate if an integer was or should be stored as a signed or unsigned integer object.

        class Unsigned(long)

       This is a long by another name. Use it in meta data dicts to choose the way it  is  stored  in  the  meta
       data.

   <b>Config</b>
       The  Config  class  is  an  object  which  keeps  the information provided in the configuration file. The
       sequence of children keeps one entry for each configuration option. Each such  entry  is  another  Config
       instance, which may nest further if nested blocks are used.

        class Config(object)

       This  represents  a  piece  of collectd's config file. It is passed to scripts with config callbacks (see
       <b>register_config</b>) and is of little use if created somewhere else.

       It has no methods beyond the bare minimum and only exists for its data members.

       Data descriptors defined here:

       parent
           This represents the parent of this node. On the root node of the config tree it will be None.

       key This is the keyword of this item, i.e. the first word of any given line in the config file.  It  will
           always be a string.

       values
           This  is  a  tuple (which might be empty) of all value, i.e. words following the keyword in any given
           line in the config file.

           Every item in this tuple will be either a string, a float or a boolean, depending on the contents  of
           the configuration file.

       children
           This  is  a  tuple of child nodes. For most nodes this will be empty. If this node represents a block
           instead of a single line of the config file it will contain all nodes in this block.

   <b>PluginData</b>
       This should not be used directly but it is the base class for both Values and Notification. It is used to
       identify the source of a value or notification.

        class PluginData(object)

       This is an internal class that is the base for Values and Notification. It is pretty  useless  by  itself
       and was therefore not exported to the collectd module.

       Data descriptors defined here:

       host
           The hostname of the host this value was read from. For dispatching this can be set to an empty string
           which means the local hostname as defined in collectd.conf.

       plugin
           The  name  of  the  plugin  that  read  the  data. Setting this member to an empty string will insert
           "python" upon dispatching.

       plugin_instance
           Plugin instance string. May be empty.

       time
           This is the Unix timestamp of the time this value was read. For dispatching values this can be set to
           zero which means "now". This means the time the value is actually dispatched, not the time it was set
           to 0.

       type
           The type of this value. This type has to be defined in your <u>types.db</u>.  Attempting to set  it  to  any
           other  value  will  raise  a  <u>TypeError</u>  exception.   Assigning a type is mandatory, calling dispatch
           without doing so will raise a <u>RuntimeError</u> exception.

       type_instance
           Type instance string. May be empty.

   <b>Values</b>
       A Value is an object which features a sequence of values. It is based on the <u>PluginData</u> type and uses its
       members to identify the values.

        class Values(PluginData)

       A Values object used for dispatching values to collectd and receiving values from write callbacks.

       Method resolution order:

       Values
       PluginData
       object

       Methods defined here:

       <b>dispatch</b>([type][, values][, plugin_instance][, type_instance][, plugin][, host][, time][, interval]) -&gt;
       None.
           Dispatch this instance to the collectd process. The object has  members  for  each  of  the  possible
           arguments  for this method. For a detailed explanation of these parameters see the member of the same
           same.

           If you do not submit a parameter the value saved in its member will be submitted. If you do provide a
           parameter it will be used instead, without altering the member.

       <b>write</b>([destination][, type][, values][, plugin_instance][, type_instance][, plugin][, host][, time][,
       interval]) -&gt; None.
           Write this instance to a single plugin or all plugins if "destination" is omitted. This  will  bypass
           the  main  collectd  process  and  all  filtering  and  caching.  Other than that it works similar to
           "dispatch". In most cases "dispatch" should be used instead of "write".

       Data descriptors defined here:

       interval
           The interval is the timespan in seconds between two submits for the same data source. This value  has
           to  be  a positive integer, so you can't submit more than one value per second. If this member is set
           to a non-positive value, the default value as specified in the config file  will  be  used  (default:
           10).

           If  you submit values more often than the specified interval, the average will be used. If you submit
           less values, your graphs will have gaps.

       values
           These are the actual values that get dispatched to collectd. It has to be  a  sequence  (a  tuple  or
           list) of numbers. The size of the sequence and the type of its content depend on the type member your
           <u>types.db</u> file. For more information on this read the <b><a href="../man5/types.db.5.html">types.db</a></b>(5) manual page.

           If the sequence does not have the correct size upon dispatch a <u>RuntimeError</u> exception will be raised.
           If the content of the sequence is not a number, a <u>TypeError</u> exception will be raised.

       meta
           These  are  the  meta  data  for this Value object.  It has to be a dictionary of numbers, strings or
           bools. All keys must be strings. <u>int</u> and &lt;long&gt; objects will be dispatched as signed integers  unless
           they  are  between  2**63 and 2**64-1, which will result in a unsigned integer.  You can force one of
           these storage classes by using the classes  <b>collectd.Signed</b>  and  <b>collectd.Unsigned</b>.  A  meta  object
           received by a write callback will always contain <b>Signed</b> or <b>Unsigned</b> objects.

   <b>Notification</b>
       A  notification  is  an  object  defining  the  severity  and message of the status message as well as an
       identification of a data instance by means of the members of <u>PluginData</u> on which it is based.

       class Notification(PluginData) The Notification class is a wrapper around the collectd notification.   It
       can  be  used  to  notify  other  plugins about bad stuff happening. It works similar to Values but has a
       severity and a message instead of interval and time.  Notifications can be dispatched at any time and can
       be received with register_notification.

       Method resolution order:

       Notification
       PluginData
       object

       Methods defined here:

       <b>dispatch</b>([type][, message][, plugin_instance][, type_instance][, plugin][, host][, time][, severity][,
       meta]) -&gt; None.  Dispatch a notification.
           Dispatch this instance to the collectd process. The object has  members  for  each  of  the  possible
           arguments  for this method. For a detailed explanation of these parameters see the member of the same
           same.

           If you do not submit a parameter the value saved in its member will be submitted. If you do provide a
           parameter it will be used instead, without altering the member.

       Data descriptors defined here:

       message
           Some kind of description of what's going on and why this Notification was generated.

       severity
           The severity of this notification. Assign or compare to <u>NOTIF_FAILURE</u>, <u>NOTIF_WARNING</u> or <u>NOTIF_OKAY</u>.

       meta
           These are the meta data for the Notification object.  It has to be a dictionary of  numbers,  strings
           or bools. All keys must be strings. <u>int</u> and <u>long</u> objects will be dispatched as signed integers unless
           they  are  between  2**63 and 2**64-1, which will result in a unsigned integer.  One of these storage
           classes can be forced by using the classes  <b>collectd.Signed</b>  and  <b>collectd.Unsigned</b>.  A  meta  object
           received by a notification callback will always contain <b>Signed</b> or <b>Unsigned</b> objects.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following functions provide the C-interface to Python-modules.

       <b>register_*</b>(<u>callback</u>[, <u>data</u>][, <u>name</u>]) -&gt; identifier
           There  are  eight  different  register functions to get callback for eight different events. With one
           exception all of them are called as shown above.

           •   <u>callback</u> is a callable object that will be called every time the event is triggered.

           •   <u>data</u> is an optional object that will be passed back to the callback function  every  time  it  is
               called. If you omit this parameter no object is passed back to your callback, not even None.

           •   <u>name</u>  is  an  optional identifier for this callback. The default name is <b>python</b>.<u>module</u>. <u>module</u> is
               taken from the <b>__module__</b> attribute of your callback function.  Every  callback  needs  a  unique
               identifier,  so  if  you want to register the same callback multiple times in the same module you
               need to specify a name here. Otherwise it's safe to ignore this parameter.

           •   <u>identifier</u> is the full identifier assigned to this callback.

           These functions are called in the various stages of the daemon (see the  section  "WRITING  YOUR  OWN
           PLUGINS" above) and are passed the following arguments:

           register_config
               The  only  argument  passed is a <u>Config</u> object. See above for the layout of this data type.  Note
               that you cannot receive the whole config files this way, only <b>Module</b>  blocks  inside  the  Python
               configuration  block.  Additionally  you  will only receive blocks where your callback identifier
               matches <b>python.</b><u>blockname</u>.

           register_init
               The callback will be called without arguments.

           register_read(callback[, interval][, data][, name]) -&gt; <u>identifier</u>
               This function takes an additional parameter: <u>interval</u>. It specifies the time between calls to the
               callback function.

               The callback will be called without arguments.

           register_shutdown
               The callback will be called without arguments.

           register_write
               The callback function will be called with one argument passed, which will be a <u>Values</u> object. For
               the layout of <u>Values</u> see above.  If this callback function throws an exception the next call will
               be delayed by an increasing interval.

           register_flush
               Like <b>register_config</b> is important for this callback because it determines what flush requests the
               plugin will receive.

               The arguments passed are <u>timeout</u> and <u>identifier</u>. <u>timeout</u> indicates  that  only  data  older  than
               <u>timeout</u> seconds is to be flushed. <u>identifier</u> specifies which values are to be flushed.

           register_log
               The  arguments  are  <u>severity</u>  and  <u>message</u>.  The  severity is an integer and small for important
               messages and high for less important messages. The least important level is <b>LOG_DEBUG</b>,  the  most
               important  level  is  <b>LOG_ERR</b>.  In  between  there  are (from least to most important): <b>LOG_INFO</b>,
               <b>LOG_NOTICE</b>, and <b>LOG_WARNING</b>. <u>message</u> is simply a string <b>without</b> a newline at the end.

               If this callback throws an exception it will <b>not</b> be logged. It will just be printed to <b>sys.stderr</b>
               which usually means silently ignored.

           register_notification
               The only argument passed is a <u>Notification</u> object. See above for the layout of this data type.

       <b>unregister_*</b>(<u>identifier</u>) -&gt; None
           Removes a callback or data-set from collectd's internal list of callback functions. Every  <u>register_*</u>
           function  has  an  <u>unregister_*</u>  function.   <u>identifier</u> is either the string that was returned by the
           register function or a callback function. The identifier will be constructed in the same way  as  for
           the register functions.

       <b>get_dataset</b>(<u>name</u>) -&gt; <u>definition</u>
           Returns  the  definition  of  a  dataset  specified  by  <u>name</u>.  <u>definition</u>  is a list of tuples, each
           representing one data source. Each tuple has 4 values:

           name
               A string, the name of the data source.

           type
               A string that is equal to either of the variables <b>DS_TYPE_COUNTER</b>, <b>DS_TYPE_GAUGE</b>,  <b>DS_TYPE_DERIVE</b>
               or <b>DS_TYPE_ABSOLUTE</b>.

           min A float or None, the minimum value.

           max A float or None, the maximum value.

       <b>flush</b>(<u>plugin[,</u> <u>timeout][,</u> <u>identifier])</u> <u>-</u> None
           Flush  one  or  all  plugins.  <u>timeout</u>  and the specified <u>identifiers</u> are passed on to the registered
           flush-callbacks. If omitted, the timeout defaults to -1. The identifier  defaults  to  None.  If  the
           <b>plugin</b> argument has been specified, only named plugin will be flushed.

       <b>error</b>, <b>warning</b>, <b>notice</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>debug</b>(<u>message</u>)
           Log a message with the specified severity.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Any Python module will start similar to:

         import collectd

       A very simple read function might look like:

         import random

         def read(data=None):
           vl = collectd.Values(type='gauge')
           vl.plugin='python.spam'
           vl.dispatch(values=[random.random() * 100])

       A very simple write function might look like:

         def write(vl, data=None):
           for i in vl.values:
             print "%s (%s): %f" % (vl.plugin, vl.type, i)

       To register those functions with collectd:

         collectd.register_read(read)
         collectd.register_write(write)

       See  the  section  "CLASSES" above for a complete documentation of the data types used by the read, write
       and match functions.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       •   collectd is heavily multi-threaded. Each collectd thread accessing the Python plugin will  be  mapped
           to  a  Python interpreter thread. Any such thread will be created and destroyed transparently and on-
           the-fly.

           Hence, any plugin has to be thread-safe if it provides several entry points from collectd  (i. e.  if
           it  registers  more  than  one  callback  or if a registered callback may be called more than once in
           parallel).

       •   The Python thread module is initialized just before calling the init callbacks.  This means you  must
           not  use  Python's  threading module prior to this point. This includes all config and possibly other
           callback as well.

       •   The python plugin exports the internal API of collectd which is considered unstable  and  subject  to
           change  at  any  time.  We try hard to not break backwards compatibility in the Python API during the
           life cycle of one major release.  However, this cannot be guaranteed at  all  times.  Watch  out  for
           warnings dispatched by the python plugin after upgrades.

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       •   Not  all  aspects of the collectd API are accessible from Python. This includes but is not limited to
           filters.
