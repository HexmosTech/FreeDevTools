</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       weston.ini - configuration file for <b>Weston</b> - the reference Wayland compositor

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Weston</b> obtains configuration from its command line parameters and the configuration file described here.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Weston</b>  uses  a configuration file called <u>weston.ini</u> for its setup.  The <u>weston.ini</u> configuration file is
       searched for in one of the following places when the server is started:

           <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/weston.ini</b>   (if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set)
           <b>$HOME/.config/weston.ini</b>      (if $HOME is set)
           <b>weston/weston.ini</b> <b>in</b> <b>each</b>
               <b>$XDG_CONFIG_DIR</b>           (if $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS is set)
           <b>/etc/xdg/weston/weston.ini</b>    (if $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS is not set)

       where environment variable <b>$HOME</b> is the user's home directory, and <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b> is the user  specific
       configuration  directory,  and  <b>$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS</b>  is  a  colon <b>':'</b> delimited listed of configuration base
       directories, such as <b>/etc/xdg-foo:<a href="file:/etc/xdg">/etc/xdg</a></b>.

       The <u>weston.ini</u> file is composed of a number of sections which may be present in any order, or omitted  to
       use default configuration values. Each section has the form:

           <b>[</b><u>SectionHeader</u><b>]</b>
           Key1=Value1
           Key2=Value2
               ...

       The spaces are significant.  Comment lines are ignored:

           <u>#comment</u>

       The section headers are:

           <b>core</b>           The core modules and options
           <b>libinput</b>       Input device configuration
           <b>shell</b>          Desktop customization
           <b>launcher</b>       Add launcher to the panel
           <b>output</b>         Output configuration
           <b>input-method</b>   Onscreen keyboard input
           <b>keyboard</b>       Keyboard layouts
           <b>terminal</b>       Terminal application options
           <b>xwayland</b>       XWayland options
           <b>screen-share</b>   Screen sharing options
           <b>autolaunch</b>     Autolaunch options

       Possible  value  types  are  string, signed and unsigned 32-bit integer, and boolean. Strings must not be
       quoted, do not support any escape sequences, and run till the end of the line. Integers can be  given  in
       decimal  (e.g.  123),  octal  (e.g.  0173),  and hexadecimal (e.g. 0x7b) form. Boolean values can be only
       'true' or 'false'.

</pre><h4><b>CORE</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>core</b> section is used to select the startup compositor modules and general options.

       <b>shell=</b><u>desktop</u>
              specifies a shell to load (string). This can be used to load your own  implemented  shell  or  one
              with Weston as default. Available shells in the <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/weston</u> directory are:

                 <b>desktop</b>
                 <b>fullscreen</b>
                 <b>ivi</b>
                 <b>kiosk</b>

       <b>xwayland=</b><u>true</u>
              ask Weston to load the XWayland module (boolean).

       <b>modules=</b><u>screen-share.so</u>
              specifies   the   modules   to   load   (string,   comma  separated).  Available  modules  in  the
              <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/weston</u> directory are:

                 <b>screen-share.so</b>

       <b>backend=</b><u>headless</u>
              overrides defaults backend. Available backends are:

                 <b>drm</b>
                 <b>headless</b>
                 <b>rdp</b>
                 <b>pipewire</b>
                 <b>vnc</b>
                 <b>wayland</b>
                 <b>x11</b>

       <b>repaint-window=</b><u>N</u>
              Set the approximate length of the repaint window in milliseconds. The repaint window  is  used  to
              control and reduce the output latency for clients. If the window is longer than the output refresh
              period,  the  repaint  will be done immediately when the previous repaint finishes, not processing
              client requests in between. If the repaint window is too short, the compositor may miss the target
              vertical blank, increasing output latency. The default value is 7 milliseconds. The allowed  range
              is  from -10 to 1000 milliseconds. Using a negative value will force the compositor to always miss
              the target vblank.

       <b>idle-time=</b><u>seconds</u>
              sets Weston's idle timeout in seconds. This idle timeout is the time after which Weston will enter
              an "inactive" mode and screen will fade to black. A value of 0 disables the timeout.

              <u>Important</u> : This option may also be set via Weston's  '-i'  command  line  option  and  will  take
              precedence  over  the  current  .ini  option.  This means that if both weston.ini and command line
              define this idle-timeout time, the one specified in the command-line will be used.  On  the  other
              hand, if none of these sets the value, default idle timeout will be set to 300 seconds.

       <b>require-input=</b><u>true</u>
              require an input device for launch

       <b>require-outputs=</b><u>any</u>
              configures the behavior if Weston fails to configure and enable outputs.

              Depending  on  the  use-case, it may preferable to ensure that Weston only starts if it can enable
              all available outputs, or that it ignores failed outputs. The possible options are:

                 <b>all-found</b>    all available outputs must be enabled
                 <b>any</b>          start if any output could be enabled
                 <b>none</b>         start even if no output was enabled

       <b>wait-for-debugger=</b><u>true</u>
              Raises SIGSTOP before initializing the compositor. This allows the user to attach with a  debugger
              and  continue  execution by sending SIGCONT. This is useful for debugging a crash on start-up when
              it would be inconvenient to launch weston directly from a debugger. Boolean,  defaults  to  <b>false</b>.
              There is also a command line option to do the same.

       <b>remoting=</b><u>remoting-plugin.so</u>
              specifies  a  plugin  for  remote  output  to  load  (string).  This  can be used to load your own
              implemented remoting plugin or one with Weston as  default.  Available  remoting  plugins  in  the
              <b>__</b><u>libweston_modules_dir</u><b>__</b> directory are:

                 <b>remoting-plugin.so</b>

       <b>renderer=</b><u>auto</u>
              Selects  a  renderer  to  use  for  internal composition when required, or <b>auto</b> to select the most
              appropriate renderer. Available renderers are:

                 <b>auto</b>
                 <b>gl</b>
                 <b>noop</b>
                 <b>pixman</b>
       Not all backends support all renderers.

       <b>use-pixman=</b><u>true</u>
              Deprecated in favour of the <b>renderer=</b> option.  Enables pixman-based rendering for all  outputs  on
              backends  that support it.  Boolean, defaults to <b>false</b>.  There is also a command line option to do
              the same.

       <b>color-management=</b><u>true</u>
              Enables color management and requires using GL-renderer.  Boolean, defaults to <b>false</b>.

              <u>TENTATIVE,</u> <u>EXPERIMENTAL,</u> <u>WORK</u> <u>IN</u> <u>PROGRESS:</u> Color management  enables  the  use  of  ICC  files  to
              describe  monitor  color behavior, Wayland protocol extensions for clients to describe their color
              spaces and perform monitor profiling, and tone mapping required to enable HDR  video  modes.  This
              extended  functionality comes at the cost of heavier image processing and sometimes a loss of some
              hardware off-loading features like composite-bypass.

       <b>output-decorations=</b><u>true</u>
              For headless-backend with GL-renderer only: draws  output  window  decorations,  similar  to  what
              wayland-backend  does for floating output windows.  Boolean, defaults to <b>false</b>.  These decorations
              cannot normally be screenshot. This option is useful for the Weston test suite only.

</pre><h4><b>LIBINPUT</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>libinput</b> section is used to configure input devices when using the libinput input device backend. The
       defaults are determined by libinput and vary according to what is most sensible for any given device.

       Available configuration are:

       <b>enable-tap=</b><u>false</u>
              Enables tap to click on touchpad devices.

       <b>tap-and-drag=</b><u>false</u>
              For touchpad devices with <b>enable-tap</b> enabled. If the user taps, then taps a second time, this time
              holding, the virtual mouse button stays down for as long as the user keeps  their  finger  on  the
              touchpad, allowing the user to click and drag with taps alone.

       <b>tap-and-drag-lock=</b><u>false</u>
              For  touchpad  devices with <b>enable-tap</b> and <b>tap-and-drag</b> enabled.  In the middle of a tap-and-drag,
              if the user releases the touchpad for less than a certain number of milliseconds, then touches  it
              again, the virtual mouse button will remain pressed and the drag can continue.

       <b>disable-while-typing=</b><u>true</u>
              For  devices that may be accidentally triggered while typing on the keyboard, causing a disruption
              of the typing.  Disables them while the keyboard is in use.

       <b>middle-button-emulation=</b><u>false</u>
              For pointer devices with left and right buttons, but no middle button.   When  enabled,  a  middle
              button event is emitted when the left and right buttons are pressed simultaneously.

       <b>left-handed=</b><u>false</u>
              Configures  the device for use by left-handed people. Exactly what this option does depends on the
              device. For pointers with left and right buttons, the buttons are swapped. On tablets, the  tablet
              is logically turned upside down, because it will be physically turned upside down.

       <b>rotation=</b><u>n</u>
              Changes  the direction of the logical north, rotating it <u>n</u> degrees clockwise away from the default
              orientation, where <u>n</u> is a whole number between 0 and 359 inclusive. Needed for trackballs, mainly.
              Allows the user to orient the trackball sideways, for example.

       <b>accel-profile=</b><u>{flat,adaptive}</u>
              Set the pointer acceleration profile. The pointer's screen speed is proportional to  the  physical
              speed  with  a  certain  constant  of proportionality.  Call that constant alpha. <u>flat</u> keeps alpha
              fixed. See <b>accel-speed</b>.  <u>adaptive</u> causes alpha to increase with physical speed,  giving  the  user
              more  control  when  the  speed  is  slow, and more reach when the speed is high.  <u>adaptive</u> is the
              default.

       <b>accel-speed=</b><u>v</u>
              If <b>accel-profile</b> is set to <u>flat</u>, it simply sets the value of alpha.  If <b>accel-profile</b>  is  set  to
              <u>adaptive</u>,  the  effect  is  more complicated, but generally speaking, it will change the pointer's
              speed.  <u>v</u> is normalised and must lie in the range [-1, 1]. The exact mapping between <u>v</u>  and  alpha
              is hardware-dependent, but higher values cause higher cursor speeds.

       <b>natural-scroll=</b><u>false</u>
              Enables  natural  scrolling,  mimicking  the  behaviour of touchscreen scrolling.  That is, if the
              wheel, finger, or fingers are moved down, the surface is scrolled up instead of down,  as  if  the
              finger, or fingers were in contact with the surface being scrolled.

       <b>scroll-method=</b><u>{two-finger,edge,button,none}</u>
              Sets  the  scroll method. <u>two-finger</u> scrolls with two fingers on a touchpad. <u>edge</u> scrolls with one
              finger on the right edge of a touchpad.  <u>button</u> scrolls when the pointer is moved while a  certain
              button is pressed. See <b>scroll-button</b>. <u>none</u> disables scrolling altogether.

       <b>scroll-button=</b><u>{BTN_LEFT,BTN_RIGHT,BTN_MIDDLE,...}</u>
              For  devices  with  <b>scroll-method</b> set to <u>button</u>. Specifies the button that will trigger scrolling.
              See <a href="file:/usr/include/linux/input-event-codes.h">/usr/include/linux/input-event-codes.h</a> for the complete list of possible values.

       <b>touchscreen_calibrator=</b><u>true</u>
              Advertise the touchscreen calibrator interface to all clients.  This  is  a  potential  denial-of-
              service  attack  vector,  so  it should only be enabled on trusted userspace. Boolean, defaults to
              <b>false</b>.

              The interface is required  for  running  touchscreen  calibrator  applications.  It  provides  the
              application raw touch events, bypassing the normal touch handling.  It also allows the application
              to upload a new calibration into the compositor.

              Even  though  this  option  is  listed  in  the  libinput  section,  it  does  affect  all  Weston
              configurations regardless of the used backend. If the backend does not use libinput, the interface
              can still be advertised, but it will not list any devices.

       <b>calibration_helper=</b><u><a href="file:/bin/echo">/bin/echo</a></u>
              An optional calibration helper program to permanently save a new touchscreen calibration.  String,
              defaults to unset.

              The given program will be executed with seven arguments when a calibrator application requests the
              server  to take a new calibration matrix into use.  The program is executed synchronously and will
              therefore block Weston for its duration. If the program exit status is non-zero, Weston  will  not
              apply  the new calibration. If the helper is unset or the program exit status is zero, Weston will
              use the new calibration immediately.

              The program is invoked as:

                 <u>calibration_helper</u> <u>syspath</u> <u>m1</u> <u>m2</u> <u>m3</u> <u>m4</u> <u>m5</u> <u>m6</u>

              where <u>syspath</u> is the udev sys path for the device and <u>m1</u>  through <u>m6</u> are  the  calibration  matrix
              elements  in  libinput's  <b>LIBINPUT_CALIBRATION_MATRIX</b>  udev  property  format.  The sys path is an
              absolute path and starts with the sys mount point.

</pre><h4><b>SHELL</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>shell</b> section is used to customize the compositor. Some keys may not be handled  by  different  shell
       plugins.

       The entries that can appear in this section are:

       <b>client=</b><u>/usr/libexec/weston-desktop-shell</u>
              specifies  the path for the shell client to run.  It is possible to pass arguments and environment
              variables to the program, for example, 'ENVFOO=bar ENVBAR=baz /path/to/program --arg  anotherarg',
              with entries that are space-separated but with no support for quoting.  If no client was specified
              then <u>weston-desktop-shell</u> is launched (string).

       <b>background-image=</b><u>file</u>
              sets the path for the background image file (string).

       <b>background-type=</b><u>tile</u>
              determines  how the background image is drawn (string). Can be <b>centered</b>, <b>scale</b>, <b>scale-crop</b> or <b>tile</b>
              (default).  Centered shows the image once centered. If the image is smaller than the  output,  the
              rest  of the surface will be in background color. If the image size does fit the output it will be
              cropped left and right, or top and bottom.  Scale means scaled to fit the  output  precisely,  not
              preserving  aspect ratio.  Scale-crop preserves aspect ratio, scales the background image just big
              enough to cover the output, and centers it. The image ends up cropped from left and right, or  top
              and  bottom,  if  the aspect ratio does not match the output. Tile repeats the background image to
              fill the output.

       <b>background-color=</b><u>0xAARRGGBB</u>
              sets the color of the background (unsigned integer). The hexadecimal  digit  pairs  are  in  order
              alpha, red, green, and blue.

       <b>clock-format=</b><u>format</u>
              sets the panel clock format (string). Can be <b>none</b>, <b>minutes</b>, <b>seconds</b>, <b>minutes-24h</b>, <b>seconds-24h</b>.  By
              default, minutes format is used.

       <b>panel-color=</b><u>0xAARRGGBB</u>
              sets  the  color  of  the  panel  (unsigned  integer).  The  hexadecimal  digit pairs are in order
              transparency, red, green, and blue. Examples:

                 <b>0xffff0000</b>    Red
                 <b>0xff00ff00</b>    Green
                 <b>0xff0000ff</b>    Blue
                 <b>0x00ffffff</b>    Fully transparent

       <b>panel-position=</b><u>top</u>
              sets the position of the panel (string). Can be <b>top,</b> <b>bottom,</b> <b>left,</b> <b>right,</b> <b>none.</b>

       <b>locking=</b><u>true</u>
              enables screen locking (boolean).

       <b>animation=</b><u>zoom</u>
              sets the effect used for opening new windows (string). Can be <b>zoom,</b> <b>fade,</b> <b>none.</b>   By  default,  no
              animation is used.

       <b>close-animation=</b><u>fade</u>
              sets  the  effect  used  when  closing  windows (string). Can be <b>fade,</b> <b>none.</b>  By default, the fade
              animation is used.

       <b>startup-animation=</b><u>fade</u>
              sets the effect used by desktop-shell when starting up (string). Can be <b>fade,</b> <b>none.</b>   By  default,
              the fade animation is used.

       <b>focus-animation=</b><u>dim-layer</u>
              sets  the effect used with the focused and unfocused windows. Can be <b>dim-layer,</b> <b>none.</b>  By default,
              no animation is used.

       <b>allow-zap=</b><u>true</u>
              whether the shell should quit when the Ctrl-Alt-Backspace key combination is pressed

       <b>binding-modifier=</b><u>ctrl</u>
              sets the modifier key used for common  bindings  (string),  such  as  moving  surfaces,  resizing,
              rotating,  switching,  closing and setting the transparency for windows, controlling the backlight
              and zooming the  desktop.  See  <b><a href="../man7/weston-bindings.7.html">weston-bindings</a></b>(7).   Possible  values:  none,  ctrl,  alt,  super
              (default)

       <b>cursor-theme=</b><u>theme</u>
              sets the cursor theme (string).

       <b>cursor-size=</b><u>24</u>
              sets the cursor size (unsigned integer).

</pre><h4><b>LAUNCHER</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       There can be multiple launcher sections, one for each launcher.

       <b>icon=</b><u>icon</u>
              sets the path to icon image (string). Svg images are not currently supported.

       <b>displayname=</b><u>displayname</u>
              sets the display name of the launcher that appears in the tooltip.

       <b>path=</b><u>program</u>
              sets the path to the program that is run by clicking on this launcher (string).  It is possible to
              pass arguments and environment variables to the program. For example:

                  path=GDK_BACKEND=wayland gnome-terminal --full-screen

</pre><h4><b>OUTPUT</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       There  can be multiple output sections, each corresponding to one output. It is currently only recognized
       by the drm and x11 backends.

       <b>name=</b><u>name</u>
              sets a name for the output (string). The backend uses the name to identify  the  output.  All  X11
              output names start with a letter X.  All Wayland output names start with the letters WL.  Examples
              of usage:

                 <b>LVDS1</b>    DRM backend, Laptop internal panel no.1
                 <b>VGA1</b>     DRM backend, VGA connector no.1
                 <b>X1</b>       X11 backend, X window no.1
                 <b>WL1</b>      Wayland backend, Wayland window no.1

              See <b><a href="../man7/weston-drm.7.html">weston-drm</a>(7)</b> for more details.

       <b>mode=</b><u>mode</u>
              sets the output mode (string). The mode parameter is handled differently depending on the backend.
              On  the  X11 backend, it just sets the WIDTHxHEIGHT of the weston window.  The DRM backend accepts
              different modes, along with an option of a modeline string.

              See <b><a href="../man7/weston-drm.7.html">weston-drm</a>(7)</b> for examples of modes-formats supported by DRM backend.

       <b>transform=</b><u>normal</u>
              How you have rotated your monitor from its normal orientation (string).  The transform key can  be
              one of the following 8 strings:

                 <b>normal</b>               Normal output.
                 <b>rotate-90</b>            90 degrees clockwise.
                 <b>rotate-180</b>           Upside down.
                 <b>rotate-270</b>           90 degrees counter clockwise.
                 <b>flipped</b>              Horizontally flipped
                 <b>flipped-rotate-90</b>    Flipped and 90 degrees clockwise
                 <b>flipped-rotate-180</b>   Flipped and upside down
                 <b>flipped-rotate-270</b>   Flipped and 90 degrees counter clockwise

       <b>scale=</b><u>factor</u>
              The  scaling  multiplier  applied  to the entire output, in support of high resolution ("HiDPI" or
              "retina") displays, that roughly  corresponds  to  the  pixel  ratio  of  the  display's  physical
              resolution  to  the logical resolution.  Applications that do not support high resolution displays
              typically appear tiny and unreadable. Weston will scale the output of such  applications  by  this
              multiplier,  to make them readable. Applications that do support their own output scaling can draw
              their content in high resolution, in which case they avoid compositor  scaling.  Weston  will  not
              scale the output of such applications, and they are not affected by this multiplier.

              An  integer,  1  by default, typically configured as 2 or higher when needed, denoting the scaling
              multiplier for the output.

       <b>icc_profile=</b><u>file</u>
              If option <b>color-management</b> is true, load the given ICC file as  the  output  color  profile.  This
              works only on DRM, headless, wayland, and x11 backends, and for remoting and pipewire outputs.

       <b>seat=</b><u>name</u>
              The  logical  seat name that this output should be associated with. If this is set then the seat's
              input will be confined to the output that has the seat set on it. The  expectation  is  that  this
              functionality  will  be  used  in  a multiheaded environment with a single compositor for multiple
              output and input configurations. The default seat is called "default" and will always be  present.
              This seat can be constrained like any other.

       <b>allow_hdcp=</b><u>true</u>
              Allows HDCP support for this output. If set to true, HDCP can be tried for the content-protection,
              provided  by  the  backends,  on  this  output.  By default, HDCP support is always allowed for an
              output. The content-protection can actually be realized, only if the hardware  (source  and  sink)
              support  HDCP,  and  the backend has the implementation of content-protection protocol. Currently,
              HDCP is supported by drm-backend.

       <b>content-type=</b><u>content_type</u>
              The type of the content being primarily displayed to this output.  Can  be  "no  data"  (default),
              "graphics", "photo", "cinema" or "game".

       <b>app-ids=</b><u>app-id[,app_id]*</u>
              A comma separated list of the IDs of applications to place on this output.  These IDs should match
              the  application  IDs  as  set  with  the  xdg_shell.set_app_id request. Currently, this option is
              supported by kiosk-shell.

       <b>colorimetry-mode=</b><u>default</u>
              Sets the colorimetry mode on the output. The colorimetry mode together with the  EOTF  mode  below
              define  the  color  encoding  used  in the video signal. The colorimetry mode is used for choosing
              between the default sink defined colorimetry (intended to be described by EDID), and  standardised
              other encodings that support wide color gamut (WCG).

              The  display  driver,  the  graphics card, and the video sink (monitor) need to support the chosen
              mode, otherwise the result is undefined or fails.

              The mode can be one of the following strings:

                 <b>default</b>              default (RGB) colorimetry, video sink dependant
                 <b>bt2020cycc</b>           Rec. ITU-R BT.2020 constant luminance YCbCr
                 <b>bt2020ycc</b>            Rec. ITU-R BT.2020 non-constant luminance YCbCr
                 <b>bt2020rgb</b>            Rec. ITU-R BT.2020 RGB
                 <b>p3d65</b>                SMPTE ST 2113 DCI-P3 RGB D65
                 <b>p3dci</b>                SMPTE ST 2113 DCI-P3 RGB Theater
                 <b>ictcp</b>                Rec. ITU-R BT.2100 ICtCp

              Defaults to <b>default</b>. Non-default modes require <b>color-management=true</b>.

              Note: The operating system might not honor the choice between RGB and YCbCr, that may be picked by
              a Linux display driver automatically.

       <b>eotf-mode=</b><u>sdr</u>
              Sets the EOTF mode on the output. This is used for choosing between standard dynamic  range  (SDR)
              mode  and  the  various high dynamic range (HDR) modes. The display driver, the graphics card, and
              the video sink (monitor) need to support the chosen mode, otherwise the result is undefined.   The
              mode can be one of the following strings:

                 <b>sdr</b>                  traditional gamma, SDR
                 <b>hdr-gamma</b>            traditional gamma, HDR
                 <b>st2084</b>               SMPTE ST 2084, a.k.a Perceptual Quantizer
                 <b>hlg</b>                  Hybrid Log-Gamma (ITU-R BT.2100)

              Defaults to <b>sdr</b>. Non-SDR modes require <b>color-management=true</b>.

       <b>color_characteristics=</b><u>name</u>
              Sets   the   basic   output   color   characteristics   by   loading   the   parameters  from  the
              <b>color_characteristics</b> section with the key <b>name=</b><u>name</u> . If an ICC profile  is  also  set,  the  ICC
              profile takes precedence.

       <b>mirror-of=</b><u>ouput_name</u>
              Makes  the  remote  output  overlap  (mirror) the native output identified by the mirror-of value.
              This is useful for sharing or mirroring a native DRM output.  The output mirroring the DRM  native
              one,  will  inherit  the same video modeline as the DRM native one, including the refresh rate and
              scale of the native output.  Note that depending on the remote backend,  automatic  output  resize
              will  be disabled when mirroring is in effect. Mirroring a DRM native output to another DRM native
              output is yet not supported, being intended only for remote outputs.

              NOTE: The native outputs created by the DRM backend using  the  'clone-of'  are  for  cloning  the
              outputs, and not sharing or mirroring. See also <b><a href="../man7/weston-drm.7.html">weston-drm</a>(7).</b>

</pre><h4><b>INPUT-METHOD</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>path=</b><u>/usr/libexec/weston-keyboard</u>
              sets  the  path of the on screen keyboard input method (string).  It is possible to pass arguments
              and environment variables to the program, for  example,  'ENVFOO=bar  ENVBAR=baz  /path/to/program
              --arg anotherarg', with entries that are space-separated but with no support for quoting.

       <b>overlay-keyboard=</b><u>false</u>
              sets weston-keyboard as overlay panel.

       <b>keymap_variant=</b><u>euro,,intl</u>
              sets the comma separated list of keyboard layout variants (string). The number of variants must be
              the same as the number of layouts above. See the Layouts section in <b><a href="../man7/xkeyboard-config.7.html">xkeyboard-config</a>(7).</b>

       <b>keymap_options=</b><u>grp:alt_shift_toggle,grp_led:scroll</u>
              sets the keymap options (string). See the Options section in <b><a href="../man7/xkeyboard-config.7.html">xkeyboard-config</a>(7).</b>

       <b>repeat-rate=</b><u>40</u>

       <b>vt-switching=</b><u>true</u>
              Whether to allow the use of Ctrl+Alt+Fn key combinations to  switch  away  from  the  compositor's
              virtual console.

</pre><h4><b>TERMINAL</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       Contains  settings for the weston terminal application (weston-terminal). It allows to customize the font
       and shell of the command line interface.

       <b>font=</b><u>DejaVu</u> <u>Sans</u> <u>Mono</u>
              sets the font of the terminal (string). For a good experience it is recommended to  use  monospace
              fonts. In case the font is not found, the default one is used.

       <b>font-size=</b><u>14</u>
              sets the size of the terminal font (unsigned integer).

       <b>term=</b><u>xterm-256color</u>

              sets the command to start a fullscreen-shell server for screen sharing (string).

       <b>start-on-startup=</b><u>false</u>
              If  set to true, start screen sharing of all outputs available on Weston startup.  Set to false by
              default.  Set to false by default. When using this option make  sure  you  enable  --no-config  to
              avoid  re-loading  the screen-share module and implictly trigger screen-sharing for the RDP output
              already  performing  the  screen  share.  Alternatively,  you  could  also  supply   a   different
              configuration  file,  by using --config /path/to/config/file, and make sure that the configuration
              file doesn't load the screen-share module.

</pre><h4><b>AUTOLAUNCH</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>path=</b><u><a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?echo">/usr/bin/echo</a></u>
              Path to an executable file to run after startup. This file is executed in parallel to  Weston,  so
              it does not have to immediately exit. Defaults to empty.

       <b>watch=</b><u>false</u>
              If set to true, quit Weston after the auto-launched executable exits. Set to false by default.

</pre><h4><b>COLOR_CHARACTERISTICS</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       Each  <b>color_characteristics</b>  section  records  one set of basic display or monitor color characterisation
       parameters. The parameters are defined in CTA-861-H specification as Static Metadata Type 1, and they can
       also be found in EDID. The parameters are divided into groups. Each group must be given either  fully  or
       not at all.

       Each  section should be named with <b>name</b> key by which it can be referenced from other sections. A metadata
       section is just a collection of parameter values and does nothing on its own. It has an effect only  when
       referenced from elsewhere.

       See <b>output</b> section key <b>color_characteristics</b>.

       <b>name=</b><u>name</u>
              An  arbitrary  name  for  this  section.  You  can choose any name you want as long as it does not
              contain the colon (<b>:</b>) character. Names with at least one colon are reserved.

   <b>Primaries</b> <b>group</b>
       <b>red_x=</b><u>x</u>
       <b>red_y=</b><u>y</u>
       <b>green_x=</b><u>x</u>
       <b>green_y=</b><u>y</u>
       <b>blue_x=</b><u>x</u>
       <b>blue_y=</b><u>y</u>
              The CIE 1931 xy chromaticity coordinates of the display primaries.  These  floating  point  values
              must reside between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.

   <b>White</b> <b>point</b> <b>group</b>
       <b>white_x=</b><u>x</u>
       <b>white_y=</b><u>y</u>
              The  CIE 1931 xy chromaticity coordinates of the display white point.  These floating point values
              must reside between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive.

   <b>Independent</b> <b>parameters</b>
       Each parameter listed here has its own group and therefore can be given alone.

       <b>max_L=</b><u>L</u>
              Display's desired maximum content luminance (peak) <u>L</u> cd/m², a floating point value  in  the  range
              0.0–100000.0.

       <b>min_L=</b><u>L</u>
              Display's  desired  minimum  content  luminance  <u>L</u>  cd/m²,  a  floating  point  value in the range
              0.0–100000.0.

       <b>maxFALL=</b><u>L</u>
              Display's desired maximum frame-average light level <u>L</u> cd/m², a floating point value in  the  range
              0.0–100000.0.
