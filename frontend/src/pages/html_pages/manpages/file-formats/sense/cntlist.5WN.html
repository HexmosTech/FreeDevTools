       cntlist - file listing number of times each tagged sense occurs in a semantic concordance, sorted most to
       least frequently tagged

       cntlist.rev  - file listing number of times each tagged sense occurs in a semantic concordance, sorted by
       sense key

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A cntlist file for a semantic concordance lists the number of times each semantically tagged sense occurs
       in the concordance and its sense number in the WordNet database.  Each line in the file corresponds to  a
       sense  in the WordNet database to which at least one semantic tag points.  Only senses that are tagged in
       a concordance are in the concordance's cntlist file.

   <b>WordNet</b> <b>Database</b> <u><b>cntlist</b></u> <b>File</b>
       In the WordNet database, words are assigned sense numbers based  on  frequency  of  use  in  semantically
       tagged  corpora.   The cntlist file used by <b><a href="../man1WN/grind.1WN.html">grind</a></b>(1WN) to build the WordNet database and assign the sense
       numbers is a union of the cntlist files  from  the  various  semantic  concordances  that  were  formerly
       released by Princeton University.  This combined cntlist file is provided with the WordNet package and is
       found in the <b>WNSEARCHDIR</b> directory.

       The  <u>cntlist.rev</u>  file is used at run-time by the WordNet library code and browser interfaces to print in
       the output display the number of times each sense has been tagged.

   <b>File</b> <b>Format</b>
       Each line in a cntlist file contains information for one sense.  The file is ordered from most  to  least
       frequently  tagged  sense.   The  fields  are  separated by one space, and each line is terminated with a
       newline character.  Senses having the same <u>tag_cnt</u> value are listed in reverse alphabetical order of  the
       <u>lemma</u> field of the <u>sense_key</u>.

       Each line in <b>cntlist</b> is of the form:

              <u>tag_cnt</u>  <u>sense_key</u>  <u>sense_number</u>

       where  <u>tag_cnt</u>  is  the  decimal  number  of  times  the  sense  is  tagged in the corresponding semantic
       concordance.  <u>sense_key</u> is a WordNet sense encoding  and  <u>sense_number</u>  is  a  WordNet  sense  number  as
       described in

       The <u>cntlist.rev</u> file contains the same fields described above, in the following order:

              <u>sense_key</u>  <u>sense_number</u>  <u>tag_cnt</u>

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       Princeton no longer maintains or releases the Semantic Concordance files.  The <u>cntlist</u> file used to order
       the  senses  in WordNet 3.0 was generated from the Semantic Concordance files at the point that they were
       last updated in 2001.  In general, the order of senses presented usually reflects  what  the  user  would
       expect, however sense ordering is now less reliable than in prior releases and should not be construed as
       an accurate indicator of frequency of use.
