</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>nebula.yml</b> - nebula configuration files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration file for <a href="../man1/nebula.1.html">nebula</a>(1) are written in YAML. Each section is described below:

   <b>pki</b>
       The PKI section defines the location of credentials

       ca
                Path to the CA certificate

       cert
                Path to this node's certificate file

       key
                Path to this node's key file

   <b>static_host_map</b>
       The  static  host  map defines a set of hosts with fixed IP addresses on the internet. Multiple addresses
       may be defined and Nebula will try each when establishing a tunnel.

   <b>lighthouse</b>
       The lighthouse section allows the entablement  and  configuration  of  lighthouse  behavior.  In  Nebula,
       lighthouses are nodes with ip fixed addresses which other nodes can use to located each other.

       am_lighthouse
              Enables  lighthouse  behavior on this node. Should ONLY be true on nodes you have configured to be
              lighthouses on your network.

       interval
              Number of seconds between updates from this node to a lighthouse. When a  lighthouse  receives  an
              update, it sends information about its current IP address to each node.

       hosts  A  list  of  lighthouse  nodes  this  node  should  report  to  and query from. Should be empty on
              lighthouse nodes.

       serve_dns
              Starts a DNS listener which responds to various queries (VAGUE) and be delegated for resolution.

   <b>listen</b>
       Control the port and interface on which nebula listens.

       host   Set the ip to which nebula binds

       port   Set the port to which nebula binds

   <b>punchy</b>
       punch  Continue to punch inbound/outbound at a regular interval  to  avoid  expiration  of  firewall  NAT
              mapping

       respond
              Configure  the node to reach out and connect to you if your hole punching fails. This is extremely
              useful if one node is behind a difficult NAT, such as a symmetric NAT.

       delay  Delay a punch response for misbehaving NATs, default is 1 second, respond must  be  true  to  take
              effect

   <b>cipher</b>
       Choose  between  the  available  ciphers  for  your  network.  Options are "chachapoly" or "aes." Must be
       identical across all nodes on a network.

   <b>sshd</b>
       SSHD can expose information and administrative function via ssh

       enabled
              If true, this enables SSHD administration

       listen Host and port to listen on. (Port 22 is not allowed.)

       host_key
              A file containing a list of authorized public keys

       authorized_users
              A list of users each with an array of keys

   <b>tun</b>
       disabled
              When tun is disabled, a lighthouse can be started without a local  run  interface  (and  therefore
              without root)

       dev    The name of the device

       drop_local_broadcast
              Toggles forwarding of local broadcast packets, the address of which depends on the ip/mask encoded
              in the pki.cert

       drop_multicast
              Drop the forwarding of multicast packets

       tx_queue
              Sets  the  transmit  queue length. (If you notice lots of transmit drops on the tun it may help to
              raise this number. Defaults to 500.

       mtu    Default MTU for every packet, safe setting is (and the default) 1300 for internet based traffic.

       unsafe_routes
              Unsafe routes allows you to route traffic over nebula to non-nebula nodes. Unsafe routes should be
              avoided unless you have hosts/services that cannot run nebula.

   <b>logging</b>
       Configure logging

       level  Configure the logging level. Must be one of panic, fatal, error, warning, info, or debug.

       format Either json or text

       disable_timestamp
              Disables timestamp logging. Useful when redirected into to a logging system which appends  a  time
              stamp. Defaults to false.

   <b>stats</b>
       Enable a statistics exporter.

       type   Type of statistics exporter. Either "prometheus" or "graphite"

       interval
              Interval to provide updates for either graphite or prometheus.

       prefix Prefix for graphite

       protocol
              Protocol for graphite

       host   Listener for graphite

       listen IP and port to bind the prometheus listener

       path   Path on which metrics are supplied in prometheus

       namespace
              Prometheus namespace

       subsystem
              Prometheus subsystem

       message_metrics
              Enables counter metrics for meta packets. (e.g. message.tx.handshake)

       lighthouse_metrics
              Enables detailed counter metrics for lighthouse packets (e.g. lighthouse.rx.HostQuery)

   <b>handshakes</b>
       Handshakes are sent to all known addresses at each interval with a linear back off.

       try_interval
              Nebula  waits  try_interval after the first attempt, 2 * try_interval on the second attempt, until
              the handshake is older than timeout. This allows you to control this interval.

       retries
              Number of retries before timing out

       trigger_buffer
              Size of the buffer channel for  quickly  sending  handshakes  after  receiving  the  response  for
              lighthouse queries

   <b>firewall</b>
       The  firewall  is  default deny. There is no way to write a deny rule. Rules are comprised of a protocol,
       port, and one or more of host, group, or CIDR. Logical evaluation is roughly: port AND proto AND  (ca_sha
       OR ca_name) AND (host OR group OR groups OR CIDR)

       outbound
              Section containing rules which apply to traffic send from this node. See the rules section.

       inbound
              Section  containing rules which apply to traffic send to this node from other hosts. See the rules
              section.

   <b>rules</b>
       Rules are written in the outbound and inbound sections described above.

       proto
                Protocol. One of "any", "tcp", "udp", or "icmp"

       host
                "any" or literal hostname

       group
                "any" or literal group name

       groups
                Same as group but accepts a list of values. Certificate has to contain all groups to pass.

       cidr
                a CIDR, "0.0.0.0/0" is any

       ca_name
                An issuing CA name

       ca_sum
                An issuing CA shasum

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       There is a example configuration file in the FILES section below.

       Configuration files placed in /etc/nebula can take advantage  of  the  built-in  systemd  templates.  For
       example, if you have a nebula configuration /etc/nebula/office.yml

         [#] systemctl enable <a href="mailto:nebula@office.service">nebula@office.service</a>

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/nebula
              Contains   configuration   files  for  <a href="../man1/nebula.1.html">nebula</a>(1).  This  provides  a  designated  place  to  store
              configuration data and  credentials.  Configuration  files  placed  in  this  directory  can  take
              advantage of the provided systemd template unit.

              See this example configuration file.
