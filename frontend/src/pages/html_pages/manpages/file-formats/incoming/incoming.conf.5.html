       incoming.conf - Configuration of incoming news feeds

</pre><h4><b>IN</b> <b>A</b> <b>NUTSHELL</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>incoming.conf</u> file configures from which remote peers <b>innd</b> accepts NNTP feeds.

       A common entry to allow "news.server.com" as an incoming peer is:

           peer news.server.com {
               hostname: "news.server.com"
           }

       The port used for incoming feeds is the one <b>innd</b> is listening on (usually port 119 or 433).

       Peer entries are read in the order they appear in the configuration file.  The first peer entry with a
       <u>hostname</u> value matching the incoming connection will be used to grant access to the remote peer.
       Subsequent entries will be discarded.

       After any changes, run "inncheck" to perform basic syntax checks, and reload this configuration file with
       the following command:

           ctlinnd reload incoming.conf 'new peer'

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The file <u>pathetc</u>/incoming.conf consists of three types of entries: key/value, peer and group.  Comments
       are from the hash character "#" to the end of the line.  Blank lines are ignored.  All key/value entries
       within each type must not be duplicated.  Key/value entries are a keyword immediately followed by a
       colon, at least one blank and a value.  For example:

           max-connections: 10

       A legal key does not contains blanks, colons, nor "#".  There are three different types of values:
       integers, booleans, and strings.  Integers are as to be expected.  A boolean value is either "true",
       "yes", "on", "false", "no" or "off" (case is not significant).  A string value is any other sequence of
       characters.  If the string needs to contain whitespace, then it must be quoted with double quotes.

       Peer entries look like:

           peer &lt;name&gt; {
               # body
           }

       The word "peer" is required.  &lt;name&gt; is a label for this peer.  It is any string valid as a key.  The
       body of a peer entry contains some number of key/value entries.

       Group entries look like:

           group &lt;name&gt; {
               # body
           }

       The word "group" is required.  &lt;name&gt; is any string valid as a key.  The body of a group entry contains
       any number of the three types of entries.  So key/value pairs can be defined inside a group, and peers
       can be nested inside a group, and other groups can be nested inside a group.  Key/value entries that are
       defined outside of all peer and group entries are said to be at global scope.  Global key/value entries
       act as defaults for peers.  When <b>innd</b> looks for a specific value in a peer entry (for example, the
       maximum number of connections to allow), if the value is not defined in the peer entry, then the
       enclosing groups are examined for the entry (starting at the closest enclosing group).  If there are no
       enclosing groups, or the enclosing groups don't define the key/value, then the value at global scope is
       used.  A small example could be:

           # Global value applied to all peers that have no value of their own.
           max-connections: 5

           # A peer definition.
           peer uunet {
               hostname: usenet1.uu.net
           }

           peer vixie {
               hostname: gw.home.vix.com
               max-connections: 10        # Override global value.
           }

           # A group of two peers which can open more connections than normal.
           group fast-sites {
               max-connections: 15

               # Another peer.  The max-connections value from the
               # fast-sites group scope is used.
               peer data.ramona.vix.com {
                   hostname: data.ramona.vix.com
               }

               peer bb.home.vix.com {
                   hostname: bb.home.vix.com
                   max-connections: 20    # He can really cook.
              }
           }

       Given the above configuration file, the defined peers would have the following values for the <u>max-</u>
       <u>connections</u> key.

           uunet                  5
           vixie                 10
           data.ramona.vix.com   15
           bb.home.vix.com       20

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       The following keys are allowed:

       <u>hold-time</u>
           This  key  requires  a  positive  integer  value.   It  defines  the hold time before closing, if the
           connection is over <u>max-connections</u>.  A value of zero specifies immediate close.  The default is "0".

       <u>hostname</u>
           This key requires a string value.  It is a list of hostnames separated by a  comma.   A  hostname  is
           either  a  fully  qualified domain name that resolves to the IPv4 or IPv6 address of the peer, or the
           dotted-quad IP address of the peer for IPv4, or the colon-separated IP address of the peer for  IPv6.
           If this key is not present in a peer block, the hostname defaults to the label of the peer.

       <u>identd</u>
           This  key  requires  a  string value.  It is used if you wish to require a peer's user name retrieved
           through <a href="../man8/identd.8.html">identd</a>(8) match the specified string.  Note  that  currently  <b>innd</b>  does  not  implement  any
           timeout  in  <b>identd</b> callbacks, so enabling this option may cause <b>innd</b> to hang if the remote peer does
           not respond to ident callbacks in a reasonable timeframe.  The default is an empty string, that is to
           say no ident daemon.

       <u>ignore</u>
           This key requires a boolean value.  Setting this entry to true causes <b>innd</b> to  answer  negatively  to
           proposals from the remote peer to send you articles.  The default is false.

           More  technically, if <u>ignore</u> is true, <b>innd</b> will refuse every Message-ID proposed to be sent via CHECK
           or IHAVE by this peer, thus behaving as though it already has the article.  A complete  article  sent
           by  this  peer  via  TAKETHIS  (because  it does not first query with CHECK, or it does not take into
           account the refusal response code from a previous CHECK) will still be accepted.

       <u>list</u>
           This key requires a boolean value.  It defines whether a peer is allowed to issue LIST commands.  The
           default is true, that is to say it can.

       <u>max-connections</u>
           This key requires a positive integer value.  It defines the maximum number of connections allowed.  A
           value of zero specifies an unlimited number of maximum connections ("unlimited" or "none" can be used
           as synonyms).  The default is "0".

       <u>password</u>
           This key requires a string value.  It is used if you wish to require a peer to supply a password  via
           AUTHINFO USER/PASS.  The default is an empty string, that it to say no password is expected.

           Note  that  <b>innd</b>  will  accept  any  username  provided  by  the  remote peer as long as the password
           corresponds.  (As the username is mandatory in the authentication protocol, <b>innd</b> expects one but does
           nothing with it.)

       <u>patterns</u>
           This key requires a string value.  It is a list of <a href="../man5/newsfeeds.5.html">newsfeeds</a>(5)-style list of newsgroups which are to
           be accepted from this host.  The default is the string "*", that is to say all groups are accepted.

       <u>resendid</u>
           This key requires a boolean value.  When set to true, <b>innd</b> asks the remote peer  to  retry  later  to
           send  the  proposed  article (which happens when another peer has already offered to send it, but has
           not yet), using "431" (response to CHECK, in streaming mode) or "436"  (response  to  IHAVE  in  non-
           streaming  mode) codes.  When set to false, <b>innd</b> does not ask any new attempt (which will lead to the
           loss of an article in case the other peer does not send it), using "438" (response to CHECK) or "435"
           (response to IHAVE) codes.  The deferral feature can be useful for peers that resend  messages  right
           away,  as  <b>innfeed</b> does.  The default is true: the deferral feature is used so that the peer receives
           "431" and "436" codes, and therefore resends the article later.

       <u>skip</u>
           This key requires a boolean value.  Setting this entry causes this peer to be skipped.   The  default
           is false.

       <u>streaming</u>
           This  key  requires  a boolean value.  It defines whether streaming commands (CHECK and TAKETHIS) are
           allowed from this peer.  The default is true.

       <u>xbatch</u>
           This key requires a boolean value.  It defines whether a peer is allowed to  issue  XBATCH  commands.
           The default is false, that is to say it cannot.
