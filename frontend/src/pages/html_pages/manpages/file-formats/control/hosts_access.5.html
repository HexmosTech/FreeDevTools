</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       hosts_access - format of host access control files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page describes a simple access control language that is based on client (host name/address,
       user name), and server (process name, host name/address) patterns.  Examples are given at  the  end.  The
       impatient reader is encouraged to skip to the EXAMPLES section for a quick introduction.

       The  extended  version of the access control language is described in the <u><a href="../man5/hosts_options.5.html">hosts_options</a></u>(5) document. <b>Note</b>
       <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>language</b> <b>supersedes</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> <u>shell_command</u> <b>as</b> <b>documented</b> <b>below.</b>

       In the following text, <u>daemon</u> is the process name of a network daemon process, and  <u>client</u>  is  the  name
       and/or  address  of  a  host  requesting service. Network daemon process names are specified in the inetd
       configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b> <b>CONTROL</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The access control software consults two files. The search stops at the first match:

       •      Access will be granted when a (daemon,client) pair matches an entry in the <u><a href="file:/etc/hosts.allow">/etc/hosts.allow</a></u> file.

       •      Otherwise,  access  will  be  denied  when  a  (daemon,client)  pair  matches  an  entry  in   the
              <u><a href="file:/etc/hosts.deny">/etc/hosts.deny</a></u> file.

       •      Otherwise, access will be granted.

       A  non-existing  access  control file is treated as if it were an empty file. Thus, access control can be
       turned off by providing no access control files.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b> <b>CONTROL</b> <b>RULES</b></h4><pre>
       Each access control file consists of zero or more lines of text.  These lines are processed in  order  of
       appearance. The search terminates when a match is found.

       •      A  newline  character is ignored when it is preceded by a backslash character. This permits you to
              break up long lines so that they are easier to edit.

       •      Blank lines or lines that begin with a `#´ character are ignored.   This  permits  you  to  insert
              comments and whitespace so that the tables are easier to read.

       •      All other lines should satisfy the following format, things between [] being optional:

                 daemon_list : client_list [ : shell_command ]

       <u>daemon_list</u>  is  a  list  of  one or more daemon process names (argv[0] values) or server port numbers or
       wildcards (see below).

       <u>client_list</u> is a list of one or more host names, host addresses, patterns or wildcards (see  below)  that
       will be matched against the client host name or address.

       The  more  complex  forms  <u>daemon@host</u>  and  <u>user@host</u>  are  explained in the sections on server endpoint
       patterns and on client username lookups, respectively.

       List elements should be separated by blanks and/or commas.

       With the exception of NIS (YP) netgroup lookups, all access control checks are case insensitive.

</pre><h4><b>PATTERNS</b></h4><pre>
       The access control language implements the following patterns:

       •      A string that begins with a `.´ character. A host name is matched if the last  components  of  its
              name  match  the  specified  pattern.   For  example,  the pattern `.tue.nl´ matches the host name
              `wzv.win.tue.nl´.

       •      A string that ends with a `.´ character. A host address is matched if  its  first  numeric  fields
              match the given string.  For example, the pattern `131.155.´ matches the address of (almost) every
              host on the Eindhoven University network (131.155.x.x).

       •      A  string  that  begins  with an `@´ character is treated as an NIS (formerly YP) netgroup name. A
              host name is matched if it is a host member of the specified netgroup. Netgroup  matches  are  not
              supported  for  daemon process names or for client user names.  On Debian systems, support for NIS
              netgroups has been disabled since package version 7.6.q-33.

       •      An expression of the form `n.n.n.n/m.m.m.m´ is interpreted as a  `net/mask´  pair.  An  IPv4  host
              address  is  matched  if  `net´  is  equal  to  the bitwise AND of the address and the `mask´. For
              example, the net/mask pattern `131.155.72.0/255.255.254.0´ matches  every  address  in  the  range
              `131.155.72.0´ through `131.155.73.255´.  `255.255.255.255´ is not a valid mask value, so a single
              host can be matched just by its IP.

       •      An  expression  of  the form `n.n.n.n/mm' is interpreted as a `net/masklength' pair, where `mm' is
              the number of consecutive `1' bits in the netmask applied to the `n.n.n.n' address.

       •      An expression of the form `[n:n:n:n:n:n:n:n]/m´ is interpreted as  a  `[net]/prefixlen´  pair.  An
              IPv6  host address is matched if `prefixlen´ bits of `net´ is equal to the `prefixlen´ bits of the
              address. For example, the [net]/prefixlen pattern `[3ffe:505:2:1::]/64´ matches every  address  in
              the range `3ffe:505:2:1::´ through `3ffe:505:2:1:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff´.

       •      A  string  that  begins  with a `/´ character is treated as a file name. A host name or address is
              matched if it matches any host name or address pattern listed in the named file. The  file  format
              is  zero or more lines with zero or more host name or address patterns separated by whitespace.  A
              file name pattern can be used anywhere a host name or address pattern can be used.

       •      Wildcards `*´ and `?´ can be used to match hostnames or IP addresses.   This  method  of  matching
              cannot be used in conjunction with `net/mask´ matching, hostname matching beginning with `.´ or IP
              address matching ending with `.´.

</pre><h4><b>WILDCARDS</b></h4><pre>
       The access control language supports explicit wildcards:

       ALL    The universal wildcard, always matches.

       LOCAL  Matches any host whose name does not contain a dot character.

       UNKNOWN
              Matches  any  user  whose name is unknown, and matches any host whose name <u>or</u> address are unknown.
              This pattern should be used with care: host names may be unavailable due to temporary name  server
              problems.  A  network address will be unavailable when the software cannot figure out what type of
              network it is talking to.

       KNOWN  Matches any user whose name is known, and matches any host whose name <u>and</u> address are known.  This
              pattern  should  be  used  with  care:  host names may be unavailable due to temporary name server
              problems.  A network address will be unavailable when the software cannot figure out what type  of
              network it is talking to.

       PARANOID
              Matches  any  host  whose  name  does  not  match its address.  When tcpd is built with -DPARANOID
              (default mode), it drops requests from such clients even before  looking  at  the  access  control
              tables.  Build without -DPARANOID when you want more control over such requests.

</pre><h4><b>OPERATORS</b></h4><pre>
       EXCEPT Intended  use is of the form: `list_1 EXCEPT list_2´; this construct matches anything that matches
              <u>list_1</u> unless it matches <u>list_2</u>.   The  EXCEPT  operator  can  be  used  in  daemon_lists  and  in
              client_lists.  The  EXCEPT operator can be nested: if the control language would permit the use of
              parentheses, `a EXCEPT b EXCEPT c´ would parse as `(a EXCEPT (b EXCEPT c))´.

</pre><h4><b>SHELL</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       If the first-matched access control rule contains a shell command, that command is subjected to %&lt;letter&gt;
       substitutions (see next section).  The result is executed by a <u><a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a></u> child process with standard input,
       output and error connected to <u>/dev/null</u>.  Specify an `&amp;´ at the end of the command if you do not want  to
       wait until it has completed.

       Shell  commands should not rely on the PATH setting of the inetd.  Instead, they should use absolute path
       names, or they should begin with an explicit PATH=whatever statement.

       The <u><a href="../man5/hosts_options.5.html">hosts_options</a></u>(5) document describes an alternative language that uses the shell command  field  in  a
       different and incompatible way.

</pre><h4><b>%</b> <b>EXPANSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following expansions are available within shell commands:

       %a (%A)
              The client (server) host address.

       %c     Client  information:  user@host,  user@address,  a host name, or just an address, depending on how
              much information is available.

       %d     The daemon process name (argv[0] value).

       %h (%H)
              The client (server) host name or address, if the host name is unavailable.

       %n (%N)
              The client (server) host name (or "unknown" or "paranoid").

       %r (%R)
              The clients (servers) port number (or "0").

       %p     The daemon process id.

       %s     Server information: daemon@host, daemon@address, or just a daemon  name,  depending  on  how  much
              information is available.

       %u     The client user name (or "unknown").

       %%     Expands to a single `%´ character.

       Characters in % expansions that may confuse the shell are replaced by underscores.

</pre><h4><b>SERVER</b> <b>ENDPOINT</b> <b>PATTERNS</b></h4><pre>
       In order to distinguish clients by the network address that they connect to, use patterns of the form:

          process_name@host_pattern : client_list ...

       Patterns like these can be used when the machine has different internet addresses with different internet
       hostnames.   Service  providers  can use this facility to offer FTP, GOPHER or WWW archives with internet
       names  that  may  even  belong  to  different  organizations.  See  also  the  `twist´  option   in   the
       <a href="../man5/hosts_options.5.html">hosts_options</a>(5) document. Some systems (Solaris, FreeBSD) can have more than one internet address on one
       physical  interface; with other systems you may have to resort to SLIP or PPP pseudo interfaces that live
       in a dedicated network address space.

       The host_pattern obeys the same syntax rules as host names and addresses in client_list context. Usually,
       server endpoint information is available only with connection-oriented services.

</pre><h4><b>CLIENT</b> <b>USERNAME</b> <b>LOOKUP</b></h4><pre>
       When the client host supports the RFC 931 protocol or one of its descendants (TAP, IDENT, RFC  1413)  the
       wrapper  programs  can  retrieve  additional information about the owner of a connection. Client username
       information, when available, is logged together with the client host name,  and  can  be  used  to  match
       patterns like:

          daemon_list : ... user_pattern@host_pattern ...

       The  daemon  wrappers can be configured at compile time to perform rule-driven username lookups (default)
       or to always interrogate the client host.  In the case of rule-driven username lookups,  the  above  rule
       would cause username lookup only when both the <u>daemon_list</u> and the <u>host_pattern</u> match.

       A  user  pattern  has  the same syntax as a daemon process pattern, so the same wildcards apply (netgroup
       membership is not supported).  One should not get carried away with username lookups, though.

       •      The client username information cannot be trusted when it is needed most,  i.e.  when  the  client
              system  has  been compromised.  In general, ALL and (UN)KNOWN are the only user name patterns that
              make sense.

       •      Username lookups are possible only with TCP-based services, and only when the client host  runs  a
              suitable daemon; in all other cases the result is "unknown".

       •      A  well-known  UNIX  kernel  bug  may cause loss of service when username lookups are blocked by a
              firewall. The wrapper README document describes a procedure to find out if your  kernel  has  this
              bug.

       •      Username lookups may cause noticeable delays for non-UNIX users.  The default timeout for username
              lookups is 10 seconds: too short to cope with slow networks, but long enough to irritate PC users.

       Selective username lookups can alleviate the last problem. For example, a rule like:

          daemon_list : @pcnetgroup ALL@ALL

       would match members of the pc netgroup without doing username lookups, but would perform username lookups
       with all other systems.

</pre><h4><b>DETECTING</b> <b>ADDRESS</b> <b>SPOOFING</b> <b>ATTACKS</b></h4><pre>
       A  flaw  in  the  sequence  number  generator  of  many TCP/IP implementations allows intruders to easily
       impersonate trusted hosts and to break in via, for example, the remote shell service.  The IDENT  (RFC931
       etc.)  service can be used to detect such and other host address spoofing attacks.

       Before accepting a client request, the wrappers can use the IDENT service to find out that the client did
       not send the request at all.  When the client host provides IDENT service, a negative IDENT lookup result
       (the client matches `UNKNOWN@host´) is strong evidence of a host spoofing attack.

       A  positive IDENT lookup result (the client matches `KNOWN@host´) is less trustworthy. It is possible for
       an intruder to spoof both the client connection and the IDENT lookup, although doing so  is  much  harder
       than spoofing just a client connection. It may also be that the client´s IDENT server is lying.

       Note: IDENT lookups don´t work with UDP services.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  language  is  flexible  enough that different types of access control policy can be expressed with a
       minimum of fuss. Although the language uses two access control tables, the most common  policies  can  be
       implemented with one of the tables being trivial or even empty.

       When  reading  the  examples  below it is important to realize that the allow table is scanned before the
       deny table, that the search terminates when a match is found, and that access is granted when no match is
       found at all.

       The examples use host and domain names. They can be improved by including address and/or  network/netmask
       information, to reduce the impact of temporary name server lookup failures.

</pre><h4><b>MOSTLY</b> <b>CLOSED</b></h4><pre>
       In this case, access is denied by default. Only explicitly authorized hosts are permitted access.

       The default policy (no access) is implemented with a trivial deny file:

       <a href="file:/etc/hosts.deny">/etc/hosts.deny</a>:
          ALL: ALL

       This denies all service to all hosts, unless they are permitted access by entries in the allow file.

       The explicitly authorized hosts are listed in the allow file.  For example:

       <a href="file:/etc/hosts.allow">/etc/hosts.allow</a>:
          ALL: LOCAL @some_netgroup
          ALL: .foobar.edu EXCEPT terminalserver.foobar.edu

       The  first  rule permits access from hosts in the local domain (no `.´ in the host name) and from members
       of the <u>some_netgroup</u> netgroup.  The second rule permits access from all hosts in  the  <u>foobar.edu</u>  domain
       (notice the leading dot), with the exception of <u>terminalserver.foobar.edu</u>.

</pre><h4><b>MOSTLY</b> <b>OPEN</b></h4><pre>
       Here, access is granted by default; only explicitly specified hosts are refused service.

       The  default  policy  (access  granted)  makes  the  allow file redundant so that it can be omitted.  The
       explicitly non-authorized hosts are listed in the deny file. For example:

       <a href="file:/etc/hosts.deny">/etc/hosts.deny</a>:
          ALL: some.host.name, .some.domain
          ALL EXCEPT in.fingerd: other.host.name, .other.domain

       The first rule denies some hosts and domains all services; the second rule still permits finger  requests
       from other hosts and domains.

</pre><h4><b>BOOBY</b> <b>TRAPS</b></h4><pre>
       The next example permits tftp requests from hosts in the local domain (notice the leading dot).  Requests
       from  any other hosts are denied.  Instead of the requested file, a finger probe is sent to the offending
       host. The result is mailed to the superuser.

       <a href="file:/etc/hosts.allow">/etc/hosts.allow</a>:
          in.tftpd: LOCAL, .my.domain

       <a href="file:/etc/hosts.deny">/etc/hosts.deny</a>:
          in.tftpd: ALL: (/usr/sbin/safe_finger -l @%h | \
               /usr/bin/mail -s %d-%h root) &amp;

       The safe_finger command comes with the tcpd wrapper and should be  installed  in  a  suitable  place.  It
       limits  possible  damage from data sent by the remote finger server.  It gives better protection than the
       standard finger command.

       The expansion of the %h (client host) and %d (service name) sequences is  described  in  the  section  on
       shell commands.

       Warning: do not booby-trap your finger daemon, unless you are prepared for infinite finger loops.

       On  network  firewall  systems this trick can be carried even further.  The typical network firewall only
       provides a limited set of services to the outer world. All other services can be "bugged" just  like  the
       above tftp example. The result is an excellent early-warning system.

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       An  error  is  reported when a syntax error is found in a host access control rule; when the length of an
       access control rule exceeds the capacity of an internal buffer;  when  an  access  control  rule  is  not
       terminated  by  a  newline  character;  when the result of %&lt;letter&gt; expansion would overflow an internal
       buffer; when a system call fails that shouldn´t.  All problems are reported via the syslog daemon.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:/etc/hosts.allow">/etc/hosts.allow</a>, (daemon,client) pairs that are granted access.
       <a href="file:/etc/hosts.deny">/etc/hosts.deny</a>, (daemon,client) pairs that are denied access.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="../man5/hosts_options.5.html">hosts_options</a>(5) extended syntax.
       <a href="../man8/tcpd.8.html">tcpd</a>(8) tcp/ip daemon wrapper program.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If a name server lookup times out, the host name will not be available to the  access  control  software,
       even though the host is registered.

       Domain name server lookups are case insensitive; NIS (formerly YP) netgroup lookups are case sensitive.
