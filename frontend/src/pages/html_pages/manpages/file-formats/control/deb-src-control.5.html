</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       deb-src-control - Debian source package template control file format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>debian/control</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Each Debian source package contains the «<b>debian/control</b>» template source control file, and its <b><a href="../man5/deb822.5.html">deb822</a></b>(5)
       format is a superset of the <b>control</b> file shipped in Debian binary packages, see <b><a href="../man5/deb-control.5.html">deb-control</a></b>(5).

       This file contains at least 2 stanzas, separated by a blank line.  The first stanza is called the source
       package stanza and lists all information about the source package in general, while each following
       stanzas are called the binary package stanzas and describe exactly one binary package per stanza.  Each
       stanza consists of at least one field.  A field starts with a field name, such as <b>Package</b> or <b>Section</b>
       (case insensitive), followed by a colon, the body of the field (case sensitive unless stated otherwise)
       and a newline.  Multi-line fields are also allowed, but each supplementary line, without a field name,
       must start with at least one space.  The content of the multi-line fields is generally joined to a single
       line by the tools (except in the case of the <b>Description</b> field, see below).  To insert empty lines into a
       multi-line field, insert a dot after the space.  Lines starting with a ‘<b>#</b>’ are treated as comments.

</pre><h4><b>SOURCE</b> <b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Source:</b> <u>source-package-name</u> (required)
           The  value  of  this  field  is the name of the source package, and must match the name of the source
           package in the debian/changelog file.  A package name must consist only of lowercase  letters  (a-z),
           digits  (0-9),  plus  (+)  and  minus (-) signs, and periods (.).  Package names must be at least two
           characters long and must start with a lowercase alphanumeric character (a-z0-9).

       <b>Maintainer:</b> <u>fullname-email</u> (recommended)
           Should be in the format «Joe Bloggs &lt;<a href="mailto:jbloggs@foo.com">jbloggs@foo.com</a>&gt;»,  and  references  the  person  who  currently
           maintains the package, as opposed to the author of the software or the original packager.

       <b>Uploaders:</b> <u>fullname-email</u>
           Lists  all  the names and email addresses of co-maintainers of the package, in the same format as the
           <b>Maintainer</b> field.  Multiple co-maintainers should be separated by a comma.

       <b>Standards-Version:</b> <u>version-string</u>
           This documents the most recent version of the distribution policy  standards  this  package  complies
           with.

       <b>Description</b> <u>short-description</u>
        <u>long-description</u>
           The  format  for the source package description is a short brief summary on the first line (after the
           <b>Description</b> field).  The following lines should be used as a longer, more detailed description.  Each
           line of the long description must be preceded by a space, and blank lines  in  the  long  description
           must contain a single ‘<b>.</b>’ following the preceding space.

       <b>Homepage:</b> <u>url</u>
           The upstream project home page URL.

       <b>Bugs:</b> <u>url</u>
           The  <u>url</u>  of  the  bug  tracking system for this package.  The current used format is <u>bts-type</u><b>://</b><u>bts-</u>
           <u>address</u>, like <b>debbugs://bugs.debian.org</b>.  This field is usually not needed.

       <b>Build-Driver:</b> <u>driver-name</u>
           This experimental field specifies the name of the build driver to use to build  this  package.   When
           omitted the <u>driver-name</u> defaults to <b>debian-rules</b>.

           This field is supported since dpkg 1.22.7.

       <b>Rules-Requires-Root:</b> <b>no</b>|<b>binary-targets</b>|<u>impl-keywords</u>
           This  field  is  used to indicate whether the <b>debian/rules</b> file requires (fake)root privileges to run
           some of its targets, and if so when.

           <b>no</b>  The binary targets will not require (fake)root at all.  This is  the  default  in  <b>dpkg-build-api</b>
               level &gt;= 1, or since dpkg 1.22.13.

           <b>binary-targets</b>
               The binary targets must always be run under (fake)root.  This value is the default in <b>dpkg-build-</b>
               <b>api</b>  level  0  until  dpkg  1.22.13, when the field is omitted; adding the field with an explicit
               <b>binary-targets</b>, while not strictly needed, marks it as having been analyzed for this requirement.

           <u>impl-keywords</u>
               This is a space-separated list of keywords which define when (fake)root is required.

               Keywords consist of <u>namespace</u>/<u>cases</u>.  The <u>namespace</u> part cannot contain "/" or  whitespace.   The
               <u>cases</u> part cannot contain whitespace.  Furthermore, both parts must consist entirely of printable
               ASCII characters.

               Each  tool/package will define a namespace named after itself and provide a number of cases where
               (fake)root is required.  (See "Implementation provided keywords" in <u>rootless-builds.txt</u>).

               When the field is set to one of the <u>impl-keywords</u>, the builder will expose an interface  that  is
               used to run a command under (fake)root.  (See "Gain Root API" in <u>rootless-builds.txt</u>.)

       <b>Testsuite:</b> <u>name-list</u>
       <b>Testsuite-Triggers:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           These fields are described in the <b><a href="../man5/dsc.5.html">dsc</a></b>(5) manual page, as they are generated from information inferred
           from <b>debian/tests/control</b> or copied literally to the source control file.

       <b>Vcs-Arch:</b> <u>url</u>
       <b>Vcs-Bzr:</b> <u>url</u>
       <b>Vcs-Cvs:</b> <u>url</u>
       <b>Vcs-Darcs:</b> <u>url</u>
       <b>Vcs-Git:</b> <u>url</u>
       <b>Vcs-Hg:</b> <u>url</u>
       <b>Vcs-Mtn:</b> <u>url</u>
       <b>Vcs-Svn:</b> <u>url</u>
           The  <u>url</u> of the Version Control System repository used to maintain this package.  Currently supported
           are <b>Arch</b>, <b>Bzr</b> (Bazaar), <b>Cvs</b>, <b>Darcs</b>,  <b>Git</b>,  <b>Hg</b>  (Mercurial),  <b>Mtn</b>  (Monotone)  and  <b>Svn</b>  (Subversion).
           Usually this field points to the latest version of the package, such as the main branch or the trunk.

       <b>Vcs-Browser:</b> <u>url</u>
           The <u>url</u> of a web interface to browse the Version Control System repository.

       <b>Origin:</b> <u>name</u>
           The name of the distribution this package is originating from.  This field is usually not needed.

       <b>Section:</b> <u>section</u>
           This  is  a  general  field that gives the package a category based on the software that it installs.
           Some common sections are <b>utils</b>, <b>net</b>, <b>mail</b>, <b>text</b>, <b>x11</b>, etc.

           When omitted, the <u>section</u> defaults to <b>unknown</b> (since dpkg 1.22.13).

           The accepted values are based on the specific distribution policy.

       <b>Priority:</b> <u>priority</u>
           Sets the importance of this package in relation to the system as a whole.  The known  priorities  are
           <b>required</b>, <b>important</b>, <b>standard</b>, <b>optional</b>, <b>extra</b>, and <b>unknown</b>, but other values can be used as well.

           When omitted, the <u>priority</u> defaults to <b>optional</b> (since dpkg 1.22.13).

           How to apply these values depends on the specific distribution policy.

       <b>Build-Depends:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           A  list of packages that need to be installed and configured to be able to build from source package.
           These dependencies need to be satisfied when building binary architecture  dependent  or  independent
           packages  and  source  packages.   Including  a dependency in this field does not have the exact same
           effect as including it in both <b>Build-Depends-Arch</b> and  <b>Build-Depends-Indep</b>,  because  the  dependency
           also needs to be satisfied when building the source package.

       <b>Build-Depends-Arch:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           Same  as  <b>Build-Depends</b>,  but they are only needed when building the architecture dependent packages.
           The <b>Build-Depends</b> are also installed in this case.  This field is supported  since  dpkg  1.16.4;  in
           order to build with older dpkg versions, <b>Build-Depends</b> should be used instead.

       <b>Build-Depends-Indep:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           Same  as <b>Build-Depends</b>, but they are only needed when building the architecture independent packages.
           The <b>Build-Depends</b> are also installed in this case.

       <b>Build-Conflicts:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           A list of packages that should not be installed when the package is built, for example  because  they
           interfere  with  the  build  system used.  Including a dependency in this list has the same effect as
           including it in both <b>Build-Conflicts-Arch</b> and <b>Build-Conflicts-Indep</b>, with the  additional  effect  of
           being used for source-only builds.

       <b>Build-Conflicts-Arch:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           Same  as  <b>Build-Conflicts</b>, but only when building the architecture dependent packages.  This field is
           supported since dpkg 1.16.4; in order to build with older dpkg versions,  <b>Build-Conflicts</b>  should  be
           used instead.

       <b>Build-Conflicts-Indep:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           Same as <b>Build-Conflicts</b>, but only when building the architecture independent packages.

       The syntax of the <b>Build-Depends</b>, <b>Build-Depends-Arch</b> and <b>Build-Depends-Indep</b> fields is a list of groups of
       alternative  packages.   Each  group is a list of packages separated by vertical bar (or “pipe”) symbols,
       ‘<b>|</b>’.  The groups are separated by commas ‘<b>,</b>’, and can end with a trailing comma that will  be  eliminated
       when  generating the fields for <b><a href="../man5/deb-control.5.html">deb-control</a></b>(5) (since dpkg 1.10.14).  Commas are to be read as “AND”, and
       pipes as “OR”, with pipes binding  more  tightly.   Each  package  name  is  optionally  followed  by  an
       architecture  qualifier appended after a colon ‘<b>:</b>’, optionally followed by a version number specification
       in parentheses ‘<b>(</b>’ and ‘<b>)</b>’, an  architecture  specification  in  square  brackets  ‘<b>[</b>’  and  ‘<b>]</b>’,  and  a
       restriction formula consisting of one or more lists of profile names in angle brackets ‘<b>&lt;</b>’ and ‘<b>&gt;</b>’.

       The  syntax  of  the  <b>Build-Conflicts</b>, <b>Build-Conflicts-Arch</b> and <b>Build-Conflicts-Indep</b> fields is a list of
       comma-separated package names, where the comma is read as an “AND”, and where the list  can  end  with  a
       trailing  comma  that  will  be  eliminated  when  generating  the  fields for <b><a href="../man5/deb-control.5.html">deb-control</a></b>(5) (since dpkg
       1.10.14).  Specifying alternative packages using a  “pipe”  is  not  supported.   Each  package  name  is
       optionally  followed  by  a version number specification in parentheses, an architecture specification in
       square brackets, and a restriction formula consisting of one or more lists  of  profile  names  in  angle
       brackets.

       An  architecture  qualifier  name  can be a real Debian architecture name (since dpkg 1.16.5), <b>any</b> (since
       dpkg 1.16.2) or <b>native</b> (since dpkg 1.16.5).  If omitted, the default  for  <b>Build-Depends</b>  fields  is  the
       current  host  architecture,  the  default for <b>Build-Conflicts</b> fields is <b>any</b>.  A real Debian architecture
       name will match exactly that architecture for that package name, <b>any</b> will match any architecture for that
       package name if the package is marked with <b>Multi-Arch:</b> <b>allowed</b>, and <b>native</b> will match the  current  build
       architecture if the package is not marked with <b>Multi-Arch:</b> <b>foreign</b>.

       A  version  number  may start with a ‘<b>&gt;&gt;</b>’, in which case any later version will match, and may specify or
       omit the Debian packaging revision (separated by a hyphen).  Accepted version relationships are ‘<b>&gt;&gt;</b>’  for
       greater  than, ‘<b>&lt;&lt;</b>’ for less than, ‘<b>&gt;=</b>’ for greater than or equal to, ‘<b>&lt;=</b>’ for less than or equal to, and
       ‘<b>=</b>’ for equal to.

       An architecture specification consists of one  or  more  architecture  names,  separated  by  whitespace.
       Exclamation marks may be prepended to each of the names, meaning “NOT”.

       A  restriction  formula  consists  of  one  or  more  restriction  lists,  separated by whitespace.  Each
       restriction list is enclosed in angle brackets.  Items in the restriction list are build  profile  names,
       separated  by  whitespace  and  can  be  prefixed with an exclamation mark, meaning “NOT”.  A restriction
       formula represents a disjunctive normal form expression.

       Note that dependencies on packages in the <b>build-essential</b> set can be omitted  and  that  declaring  build
       conflicts against them is impossible.  A list of these packages is in the build-essential package.

</pre><h4><b>BINARY</b> <b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       Note that the <b>Priority</b>, <b>Section</b> and <b>Homepage</b> fields can also be in a binary stanza to override the global
       value from the source package.

       <b>Package:</b> <u>binary-package-name</u> (required)
           This  field  is  used  to name the binary package name.  The same restrictions as to a source package
           name apply.

       <b>Package-Type:</b> <b>deb</b>|<b>udeb</b>|<u>type</u>
           This field defines the type of the package.  <b>udeb</b> is for size-constrained packages used by the debian
           installer.  <b>deb</b> is the default value, it is assumed if the field is  absent.   More  types  might  be
           added in the future.

       <b>Architecture:</b> <u>arch</u>|<b>all</b>|<b>any</b> (required)
           The architecture specifies on which type of hardware this package runs.  For packages that run on all
           architectures,  use the <b>any</b> value.  For packages that are architecture independent, such as shell and
           Perl scripts or documentation, use the <b>all</b> value.  To restrict the  packages  to  a  certain  set  of
           architectures,  specify  the  architecture  names,  separated  by a space.  It's also possible to put
           architecture wildcards in that list (see <b><a href="../man1/dpkg-architecture.1.html">dpkg-architecture</a></b>(1) for more information about them).

       <b>Build-Profiles:</b> <u>restriction-formula</u>
           This field specifies the conditions for which this binary package does or does not build.  To express
           that condition, the same restriction formula syntax from the <b>Build-Depends</b> field is  used  (including
           the angle brackets).

           If  a binary package stanza does not contain this field, then it implicitly means that it builds with
           all build profiles (including none at all).

           In other words, if a binary package stanza is annotated with a non-empty <b>Build-Profiles</b>  field,  then
           this  binary  package  is  generated if and only if the condition expressed by the conjunctive normal
           form expression evaluates to true.

       <b>Protected:</b> <b>yes</b>|<b>no</b>
       <b>Essential:</b> <b>yes</b>|<b>no</b>
       <b>Build-Essential:</b> <b>yes</b>|<b>no</b>
       <b>Multi-Arch:</b> <b>same</b>|<b>foreign</b>|<b>allowed</b>|<b>no</b>
       <b>Tag:</b> <u>tag-list</u>
       <b>Description:</b> <u>short-description</u> (recommended)
           These fields are described in the <b><a href="../man5/deb-control.5.html">deb-control</a></b>(5) manual page, as they are  copied  literally  to  the
           control file of the binary package.

       <b>Depends:</b> <u>package-list</u>
       <b>Pre-Depends:</b> <u>package-list</u>
       <b>Recommends:</b> <u>package-list</u>
       <b>Suggests:</b> <u>package-list</u>
       <b>Breaks:</b> <u>package-list</u>
       <b>Enhances:</b> <u>package-list</u>

       <b>Conflicts:</b> <u>package-list</u>
       <b>Provides:</b> <u>package-list</u>
       <b>Built-Using:</b> <u>package-list</u>
       <b>Static-Built-Using:</b> <u>package-list</u>
           These fields declare relationships between packages.  They are discussed in the <b><a href="../man5/deb-control.5.html">deb-control</a></b>(5) manual
           page.   When  these fields are found in <u>debian/control</u> they can also end with a trailing comma (since
           dpkg 1.10.14), have architecture specifications and restriction formulas which will all  get  reduced
           when generating the fields for <b><a href="../man5/deb-control.5.html">deb-control</a></b>(5).

       <b>Subarchitecture:</b> <u>value</u>
       <b>Kernel-Version:</b> <u>value</u>
       <b>Installer-Menu-Item:</b> <u>value</u>
           These  fields are used by the debian-installer in <b>udeb</b>s and are usually not needed.  For more details
           about                                            them,                                            see
           &lt;https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/debian-installer/-/raw/master/doc/devel/modules.txt&gt;.

</pre><h4><b>USER-DEFINED</b> <b>FIELDS</b></h4><pre>
       It  is  allowed  to  add additional user-defined fields to the control file.  The tools will ignore these
       fields.  If you want the fields to be copied over to the output files, such as the binary  packages,  you
       need  to  use  a custom naming scheme: the fields should start with an <b>X</b>, followed by zero or more of the
       letters <b>SBC</b> and a hyphen.

       <b>S</b>   The field will appear in the source package control file, see <b><a href="../man5/dsc.5.html">dsc</a></b>(5).

       <b>B</b>   The field will appear in the control file in the binary package, see <b><a href="../man5/deb-control.5.html">deb-control</a></b>(5).

       <b>C</b>   The field will appear in the upload control (.changes) file, see <b><a href="../man5/deb-changes.5.html">deb-changes</a></b>(5).

       Note that the <b>X</b>[<b>SBC</b>]<b>-</b> prefixes are stripped when the fields are copied over to the output files.  A field
       <b>XC-Approved-By</b> will appear as <b>Approved-By</b> in the changes file and will not appear in the binary or source
       package control files.

       Take into account that these user-defined fields will be using the global namespace, which might at  some
       point in the future collide with officially recognized fields.  To avoid such potential situation you can
       prefix those fields with <b>Private-</b>, such as <b>XB-Private-New-Field</b>.
