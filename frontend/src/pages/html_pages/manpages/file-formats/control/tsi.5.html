       tsi - Transmission Subscriber Identification (TSI) access control list

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>HylaFAX</u>  configuration  parameter  <b>QualifyTSI</b>  specifies  whether  or  not the identity of a calling
       facsimile machine should be checked against an  access  control  list  before  receiving  facsimile.   If
       <b>QualifyTSI</b>  is  non-null,  then only messages from facsimile machines identified in the file specified by
       the string (typically <b>etc/tsi</b>) will be accepted.

       Patterns are specified one per line and must conform to the regular expressions syntax specified by POSIX
       1003.2; see <u><a href="../man7/re_format.7.html">re_format</a></u>(7).  Comments may be included; they are introduced with  the  ``#''  character  and
       extend  to  the  end  of  the  line.  Any trailing white space on a line is ignored (for convenience when
       comments are used).

       If a line begins with ``!'', then the regular expression identifies  clients  that  should  be  <u>rejected</u>;
       otherwise  regular  expressions  identify  clients  whose transmissions should be <u>accepted</u>.  The order of
       patterns in a TSI file is important.  When a facsimile is to be received, the fax server will compare the
       client's TSI against the patterns in the access control list in the order in which  they  appear  in  the
       file.   The  first  pattern that matches the client TSI is used to decide whether to accept or reject the
       facsimile.  If no patterns match the client TSI then the facsimile is rejected.   Thus  if  you  want  to
       accept all but a restricted set of TSI the last line in the file should be ``^.*$''.

       Note that regular expression patterns should be written to match a TSI exactly.  That is, patterns should
       be of the form:
            ^&lt;pattern&gt;$

       where  the  ``^''  and  ``$''  characters  are  used  to  specify  the start and end of the matching TSI.
       Additionally, regular expression patterns should handle white space that may appear in  known  locations.
       For example,
            ^([+]1){1}[ .-]*415[ .-]*555[ .-]*1212.*$

       matches the following TSI strings:
              +1.415.555.1212
                  415  555  1212
              1-415-555-1212

       Finally, note that regular expressions can be used to specify many TSI with one pattern.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       It  would  be nice if TSI that were to be matched against were placed in some canonical form (e.g. remove
       white space and white space-like characters).  This is,  however,  problematic,  because  some  facsimile
       machines permit any printable ASCII string to be sent as a TSI.
