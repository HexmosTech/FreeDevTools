</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sane-canon_pp - SANE backend for Canon CanoScan Parallel Port flatbed scanners

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>sane-canon_pp</b> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend that provides access to the
       following Canon flatbed scanners:

              CanoScan FB320P
              CanoScan FB620P
              CanoScan FB330P
              CanoScan FB630P
              CanoScan N340P
              CanoScan N640P
              CanoScan N640P ex

       No  USB  scanners are supported and there are no plans to support them in the future.  Other projects are
       working on support for USB scanners. See the <u>PROJECTS</u> file for more detail.  The FB310P  and  FB610P  are
       re-badged  Avision  scanners  which  use a different command set, so are unlikely to be supported by this
       backend in the future.

       IMPORTANT: this is alpha code. While we have made every effort to make it as  reliable  as  possible,  it
       will  not  always  work  as expected.  Feedback is still appreciated.  Please send any bug reports to the
       maintainers as listed on the web page (listed in <b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b> below).

</pre><h4><b>DEVICE</b> <b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       This backend expects device names of the form  presented  by  <b><a href="../man3/libieee1284.3.html">libieee1284</a></b>(3).   These  names  are  highly
       dependent on operating system and version.

       On  Linux  2.4  kernels  this  will be of the form <u>parport0</u> or older (2.2 and before) kernels may produce
       names like <u>0x378</u> (the base address of your port) or simply <u>0</u>  depending  on  your  module  configuration.
       Check  the contents of <u>/proc/parport</u> if it exists.  If you don't want to specify a default port (or don't
       know its name), the backend should be able to detect which port your scanner is on.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The contents of the <u>canon_pp.conf</u> file is a list of options for the driver to use.  Empty lines and lines
       starting with a hash mark (#) are ignored.

       The supported options are currently <b>ieee1284</b>, <b>calibrate</b>, <b>init_mode</b>, and <b>force_nibble</b>

       <b>ieee1284</b> <b>port-name</b>
              Defines which port to use.  The format of port-name is OS dependent, based on the names  presented
              by <b><a href="../man3/libieee1284.3.html">libieee1284</a></b>(3).  Please only have one of these lines, or all but one will be ignored.

       <b>calibrate</b> <b>cal-file</b> <b>[port-name]</b>
              Defines  which  calibration  file  to  use on a per-port basis.  If you only have one parport, the
              port-name argument may be omitted - but be careful as this will cause  problems  on  multi-scanner
              systems.  You may have as many of these lines as you like, as long as each has a unique port name.
              The  tilde (`~') character is acceptable and will be expanded to the value of the <b>HOME</b> environment
              variable.

       <b>init_mode</b> <b>&lt;AUTO|FB620P|FB630P&gt;</b> <b>[port-name]</b>
              Defines which initialisation (wake-up) mode to use on a per-port basis.   If  you  only  have  one
              parport,  the  port-name  argument  may  be omitted - but be careful as this may cause problems on
              multi-scanner systems.  You may have as many of these lines as you like, as long  as  each  has  a
              unique  port name.  The valid initialisation modes are FB620P (which strobes 10101010 and 01010101
              on the data pins), FB630P (which strobes 11001100 and 00110011 on the data pins) and  AUTO,  which
              will  try  FB630P mode first then FB620P mode second.  The FB620P mode is also used by the FB320P.
              The FB630P mode is used by the FB330P, N340P, and N640P.

       <b>force_nibble</b>
              Forces the driver to use nibble mode even if ECP mode is reported to work by <b><a href="../man3/libieee1284.3.html">libieee1284</a></b>(3).  This
              works-around the rare issue of ECP mode being reported to work by the library, then not working.

</pre><h4><b>TIPS</b></h4><pre>
       Hit the "Calibrate" button before scanning.  It vastly improves the quality of scans.

       To enable automatic detection of your scanner, uncomment the "canon_pp" line from <u>/etc/sane.d/dll.conf</u>

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/sane.d/canon_pp.conf</u>
              The backend configuration file (see also description of <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> below).

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-canon_pp.a</u>
              The static library implementing this backend.

       <u>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/sane/libsane-canon_pp.so</u>
              The shared library implementing this backend (present on systems that support dynamic loading).

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b>
              This environment variable specifies the list of directories that  may  contain  the  configuration
              file.   On  *NIX  systems,  the  directories  are separated by a colon (`:'), under OS/2, they are
              separated by a semi-colon (`;').  If this variable is not set, the configuration file is  searched
              in  two  default  directories: first, the current working directory (".") and then in <u>/etc/sane.d</u>.
              If the value of the environment variable ends with the directory  separator  character,  then  the
              default  directories are searched after the explicitly specified directories. For example, setting
              <b>SANE_CONFIG_DIR</b> to "/tmp/config:" would result in directories <u>tmp/config</u>, <u>.</u>, and <u>/etc/sane.d</u> being
              searched (in this order).

       <b>SANE_DEBUG_CANON_PP</b>
              If the library was compiled with debug support enabled, this  environment  variable  controls  the
              debug level for this backend.  Higher debug levels increase the verbosity of the output.

              Example: export SANE_DEBUG_CANON_PP=4

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Features</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>interface</b>

       <b>Brightness</b> <b>and</b> <b>Contrast</b>
              These are not implemented, and probably never will be.  These appear to be implemented entirely in
              software.  Use GIMP or a similar program if you need these features.

       <b>Descreen</b> <b>Mode</b>
              This  appears  on our first analysis to be just oversampling with an anti-aliasing filter.  Again,
              it seems to be implemented entirely in software, so GIMP is your best bet for now.

       <b>Gamma</b> <b>Tables</b>
              This is under investigation, but for now only a simple gamma profile (ie: the one returned  during
              calibration) will be loaded.

       <b>Communication</b> <b>Problems</b>

       ECP mode in <b><a href="../man3/libieee1284.3.html">libieee1284</a></b>(3) doesn't always work properly, even with new hardware.  We believe that this is
       a  ppdev  problem.   If  you  change the configuration file to include <b>force_nibble</b> , the problem will go
       away, but you will only be able to scan in nibble mode.

       Sometimes the scanner can be left in a state where our code cannot revive it.  If the backend reports  no
       scanner present, try unplugging the power and plugging it back in.  Also try unplugging printers from the
       pass-through port.

       The scanner will not respond correctly to our commands when you first plug in the power.  You may find if
       you  try  a  scan very soon after plugging in the power that the backend will incorrectly report that you
       have no scanner present.  To avoid this, give it about 10 seconds to reset itself before  attempting  any
       scans.

       <b>Repeated</b> <b>Lines</b>

       Sometimes  at  high  resolutions  (ie.  600dpi)  you  will  notice lines which appear twice.  These lines
       correspond to points where the scanner head has stopped during the scan (it stops every time the internal
       64kb buffer is full).  Basically it's a mechanical problem inside the  scanner,  that  the  tolerance  of
       movement for a start/stop event is greater than 1/600 inches.  I've never tried the windows driver so I'm
       not sure how (or if) it works around this problem, but as we don't know how to rewind the scanner head to
       do these bits again, there's currently no nice way to deal with the problem.

       <b>Grey-scale</b> <b>Scans</b>

       Be  aware  that  the  scanner uses the green LEDs to read grey-scale scans, meaning green coloured things
       will appear lighter than normal, and red and blue coloured items will appear  darker  than  normal.   For
       high-accuracy  grey-scale  scans  of  colour items, it's best just to scan in colour and convert to grey-
       scale in graphics software such as the GIMP.

       <b>FB620P/FB320P</b> <b>Caveats</b>

       These models can not be reset in the same way as the others.  The windows  driver  doesn't  know  how  to
       reset  them  either  -  when  left with an inconsistent scanner, it will start scanning half way down the
       page!

       Aborting is known to work correctly on the FB*30P models, and is known to be broken on the FB*20P models.
       The FB620P which I tested on simply returns garbage after a scan has been aborted  using  the  method  we
       know.   Aborting is able to leave the scanner in a state where it can be shut down, but not where another
       scan can be made.
