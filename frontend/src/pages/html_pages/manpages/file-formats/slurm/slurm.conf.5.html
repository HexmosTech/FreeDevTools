</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       slurm.conf - Slurm configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>slurm.conf</b>  is  an  ASCII  file  which describes general Slurm configuration information, the nodes to be
       managed, information about how those nodes are grouped into partitions, and various scheduling parameters
       associated with those partitions. This file should be consistent across all nodes in the cluster.

       The file location can be modified at execution time by setting the SLURM_CONF environment  variable.  The
       Slurm  daemons  also  allow you to override both the built-in and environment-provided location using the
       "-f" option on the command line.

       The contents of the file are case insensitive except for the names of  nodes  and  partitions.  Any  text
       following  a "#" in the configuration file is treated as a comment through the end of that line.  Changes
       to the configuration file take effect upon restart of Slurm daemons, daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal,
       or execution of the command "scontrol reconfigure" unless otherwise  noted.   Changes  to  TCP  listening
       settings will require a daemon restart.

       If  a  line begins with the word "Include" followed by whitespace and then a file name, that file will be
       included inline with the current configuration file. For large or complex systems, multiple configuration
       files may prove easier to manage and enable reuse of some files (See INCLUDE MODIFIERS for more details).

       Note on file permissions:

       The <u>slurm.conf</u> file must be readable by all users of Slurm, since  it  is  used  by  many  of  the  Slurm
       commands.  Other  files  that  are  defined  in the <u>slurm.conf</u> file, such as log files and job accounting
       files, may need to be created/owned by the user "SlurmUser" to be successfully accessed. Use the  "chown"
       and  "chmod"  commands  to  set  the  ownership  and permissions appropriately.  See the section <b>FILE</b> <b>AND</b>
       <b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>PERMISSIONS</b> for information about the various files and directories used by Slurm.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       The overall configuration parameters available include:

       <b>AccountingStorageBackupHost</b>
              The name of the backup machine  hosting  the  accounting  storage  database.   If  used  with  the
              accounting_storage/slurmdbd plugin, this is where the backup slurmdbd would be running.  Only used
              with systems using SlurmDBD, ignored otherwise.

       <b>AccountingStorageEnforce</b>
              This  controls  what  level  of  association-based enforcement to impose on job submissions. Valid
              options are any comma-separated combination of  the  following,  many  of  which  will  implicitly
              include other options:

              <b>all</b>
                Implies all other available options except <b>nojobs</b> and <b>nosteps</b>.

              <b>associations</b>
                No new job is allowed to run unless a corresponding association exists in the system.

              <b>limits</b>
                Users can be limited by association to whatever job size or run time limits are defined. Implies
                <b>associations</b>.

              <b>nojobs</b>
                Slurm will not account for any jobs or steps on the system.  Implies <b>nosteps</b>.

              <b>nosteps</b>
                Slurm will not account for any steps that have run.

              <b>qos</b>
                Jobs will not be scheduled unless a valid qos is specified.  Implies <b>associations</b>.

              <b>safe</b>
                A  job  will only be launched against an association or qos that has a TRES-minutes limit set if
                the job will be able to run to completion. Without this option set, jobs  will  be  launched  as
                long  as their usage hasn't reached the TRES-minutes limit. This can lead to jobs being launched
                but then killed when the limit is reached. With this option,  a  job  won't  be  killed  due  to
                limits,  even  if  the  limits  are changed after the job was started and the association or qos
                violates the updated limits. Implies <b>limits</b> and <b>associations</b>.

              <b>wckeys</b>
                Jobs will not be scheduled unless a valid workload characterization key  is  specified.  Implies
                <b>associations</b> and <b>TrackWCKey</b> (a separate configuration option).

       <b>AccountingStorageExternalHost</b>
              A comma-separated list of external slurmdbds (&lt;host/ip&gt;[:port][,...]) to register with. If no port
              is given, the <b>AccountingStoragePort</b> will be used.

              This  allows  clusters  registered with the external slurmdbd to communicate with each other using
              the <u>--cluster/-M</u> client command options.

              The cluster will add itself to the external slurmdbd  if  it  doesn't  exist.  If  a  non-external
              cluster  already  exists  on  the  external slurmdbd, the slurmctld will ignore registering to the
              external slurmdbd.

       <b>AccountingStorageHost</b>
              The name of the machine hosting the accounting storage database.  Only  used  with  systems  using
              SlurmDBD, ignored otherwise.

       <b>AccountingStorageParameters</b>
              Comma-separated list of options.

              <b>max_step_records</b>=The number of steps that are recorded in the database for each job -- excluding
                batch, extern, and interactive steps.

              The  following comma-separated list of key-value options are used to establish a secure connection
              to the database:

              <b>SSL_CERT</b>
                The path name of the client public key certificate file.

              <b>SSL_CA</b>
                The path name of the Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file.

              <b>SSL_CAPATH</b>
                The path name of the directory that contains trusted SSL CA certificate files.

              <b>SSL_KEY</b>
                The path name of the client private key file.

              <b>SSL_CIPHER</b>
                The list of permissible ciphers for SSL encryption.

       <b>AccountingStoragePass</b>
              The password used to gain access to the database to store  the  accounting  data.  Only  used  for
              database  type  storage plugins, ignored otherwise. In the case of SlurmDBD (Database Daemon) with
              MUNGE authentication this can be configured to use  a  MUNGE  daemon  specifically  configured  to
              provide  authentication  between  clusters  while the default MUNGE daemon provides authentication
              within a cluster. In that case, <b>AccountingStoragePass</b> should specify the named port to be used for
              communications with  the  alternate  MUNGE  daemon  (e.g.  "/var/run/munge/global.socket.2").  The
              default value is NULL.

       <b>AccountingStoragePort</b>
              The listening port of the accounting storage database server.  Only used for database type storage
              plugins,  ignored  otherwise.   The  default value is SLURMDBD_PORT as established at system build
              time. If no value is explicitly specified, it will be set to 6819.  This value must  be  equal  to
              the <b>DbdPort</b> parameter in the slurmdbd.conf file.

       <b>AccountingStorageTRES</b>
              Comma-separated  list  of  resources  you  wish  to track on the cluster.  These are the resources
              requested by the sbatch/srun job when it is submitted. Currently this consists  of  any  GRES,  BB
              (burst  buffer) or license along with CPU, Memory, Node, Energy, FS/[Disk|Lustre], IC/OFED, Pages,
              and VMem. By default Billing, CPU, Energy, Memory, Node, FS/Disk,  Pages  and  VMem  are  tracked.
              These      default      TRES     cannot     be     disabled,     but     only     appended     to.
              AccountingStorageTRES=gres/craynetwork,license/iop1  will  track  billing,  cpu,  energy,  memory,
              nodes,  fs/disk,  pages  and vmem along with a gres called craynetwork as well as a license called
              iop1. Whenever these  resources  are  used  on  the  cluster  they  are  recorded.  The  TRES  are
              automatically set up in the database on the start of the slurmctld.

              If  multiple GRES of different types are tracked (e.g. GPUs of different types), then job requests
              with   matching   type   specifications   will   be   recorded.    Given   a   configuration    of
              "AccountingStorageTRES=gres/gpu,gres/gpu:tesla,gres/gpu:volta"     Then    "gres/gpu:tesla"    and
              "gres/gpu:volta" will track  only  jobs  that  explicitly  request  those  two  GPU  types,  while
              "gres/gpu" will track allocated GPUs of any type ("tesla", "volta" or any other GPU type).

              Given    a    configuration    of    "AccountingStorageTRES=gres/gpu:tesla,gres/gpu:volta"    Then
              "gres/gpu:tesla" and "gres/gpu:volta" will track jobs that explicitly request those GPU types.  If
              a job requests GPUs, but does not explicitly specify the GPU type, then  its  resource  allocation
              will  be accounted for as either "gres/gpu:tesla" or "gres/gpu:volta", although the accounting may
              not match the actual GPU type allocated to the job and the GPUs allocated  to  the  job  could  be
              heterogeneous.   In an environment containing various GPU types, use of a job_submit plugin may be
              desired in order to force jobs to explicitly specify some GPU type.

              <b>NOTE</b>: Setting gres/gpu will also set gres/gpumem and gres/gpuutil.  gres/gpumem  and  gres/gpuutil
              can be set individually when gres/gpu is not set.

       <b>AccountingStorageType</b>
              The  accounting  storage mechanism type. Unset by default, which indicates that accounting records
              are not maintained.

              Current options are:

              <b>accounting_storage/slurmdbd</b>
                     The accounting records will be written to the SlurmDBD, which manages an  underlying  MySQL
                     database. See "man slurmdbd" for more information.

       <b>AccountingStorageUser</b>
              The  user  account  for  accessing  the  accounting storage database.  Only used for database type
              storage plugins, ignored otherwise.

       <b>AccountingStoreFlags</b>
              Comma separated list used to modify which fields the slurmctld send to the accounting database.

              Current options are:

              <b>job_comment</b>
                     Include the job's comment field in the job complete message sent to the Accounting  Storage
                     database.  Note the AdminComment and SystemComment are always recorded in the database.

              <b>job_env</b>
                     Include a batch job's environment variables used at job submission in the job start message
                     sent to the Accounting Storage database.

              <b>job_extra</b>
                     Include  the  job's  extra field in the job complete message sent to the Accounting Storage
                     database.

              <b>job_script</b>
                     Include the job's batch script in the job start message  sent  to  the  Accounting  Storage
                     database.

              <b>no_stdio</b>
                     Exclude  the  stdio  paths  when  recording data into the database on a job start.  StdOut,
                     StdErr and StdIn fields for a job will be empty.

       <b>AcctGatherNodeFreq</b>
              The AcctGather plugins sampling interval for node accounting.  For  AcctGather  plugin  values  of
              none,  this  parameter  is  ignored.  For all other values this parameter is the number of seconds
              between node accounting samples. For the acct_gather_energy/rapl plugin, set a value less than 300
              because the counters may overflow beyond this  rate.   The  default  value  is  zero.  This  value
              disables  accounting  sampling  for  nodes.  Note:  The  accounting  sampling interval for jobs is
              determined by the value of <b>JobAcctGatherFrequency</b>.

       <b>AcctGatherEnergyType</b>
              Identifies the plugin to be used for energy consumption accounting.  The jobacct_gather plugin and
              slurmd daemon call this plugin to  collect  energy  consumption  data  for  jobs  and  nodes.  The
              collection  of  energy  consumption  data  takes  place  on  the node level, hence only in case of
              exclusive job  allocation  the  energy  consumption  measurements  will  reflect  the  job's  real
              consumption.  In  case  of node sharing between jobs the reported consumed energy per job (through
              sstat or sacct) will not reflect the real energy consumed by  the  jobs.  Default  is  nothing  is
              collected.

              Configurable values at present are:

              <b>acct_gather_energy/gpu</b>
                                  Energy  consumption  data  is  collected from the GPU management library (e.g.
                                  rsmi) for the corresponding type of GPU. Only available for rsmi at present.

              <b>acct_gather_energy/ipmi</b>
                                  Energy consumption data is collected from the Baseboard Management  Controller
                                  (BMC) using the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI).

              <b>acct_gather_energy/pm_counters</b>
                                  Energy  consumption data is collected from the Baseboard Management Controller
                                  (BMC) for HPE Cray systems.

              <b>acct_gather_energy/rapl</b>
                                  Energy consumption data is collected from hardware sensors using  the  Running
                                  Average  Power Limit (RAPL) mechanism. Note that enabling RAPL may require the
                                  execution of the command "sudo modprobe msr".

              <b>acct_gather_energy/xcc</b>
                                  Energy consumption data is collected from the Lenovo SD650 XClarity Controller
                                  (XCC) using IPMI OEM raw commands.

       <b>AcctGatherInterconnectType</b>
              Identifies the plugin to be used for interconnect network traffic accounting.  The  jobacct_gather
              plugin and slurmd daemon call this plugin to collect network traffic data for jobs and nodes.  The
              collection  of network traffic data takes place on the node level, hence only in case of exclusive
              job allocation the collected values will reflect the job's real traffic. In case of  node  sharing
              between  jobs  the  reported network traffic per job (through sstat or sacct) will not reflect the
              real network traffic by the jobs.

              Configurable values at present are:

              <b>acct_gather_interconnect/ofed</b>
                                  Infiniband network traffic data are collected  from  the  hardware  monitoring
                                  counters  of Infiniband devices through the OFED library.  In order to account
                                  for per job network traffic, add the "ic/ofed" TRES to <u>AccountingStorageTRES</u>.

              <b>acct_gather_interconnect/sysfs</b>
                                  Network   traffic   statistics   are   collected   from   the   Linux    sysfs
                                  pseudo-filesystem  for specific interfaces defined in <b><a href="../man5/acct_gather.conf.5.html">acct_gather.conf</a></b>(5).  In
                                  order to account for per job network  traffic,  add  the  "ic/sysfs"  TRES  to
                                  <u>AccountingStorageTRES</u>.

       <b>AcctGatherFilesystemType</b>
              Identifies the plugin to be used for filesystem traffic accounting.  The jobacct_gather plugin and
              slurmd  daemon  call  this  plugin  to  collect  filesystem  traffic data for jobs and nodes.  The
              collection of filesystem traffic data takes place on  the  node  level,  hence  only  in  case  of
              exclusive job allocation the collected values will reflect the job's real traffic. In case of node
              sharing  between  jobs  the  reported filesystem traffic per job (through sstat or sacct) will not
              reflect the real filesystem traffic by the jobs.

              Configurable values at present are:

              <b>acct_gather_filesystem/lustre</b>
                                  Lustre filesystem traffic data  are  collected  from  the  counters  found  in
                                  /proc/fs/lustre/.   In  order  to  account for per job lustre traffic, add the
                                  "fs/lustre" TRES to <u>AccountingStorageTRES</u>.

       <b>AcctGatherProfileType</b>
              Identifies the plugin to be used for detailed job profiling.  The jobacct_gather plugin and slurmd
              daemon call this plugin to collect detailed data such as  I/O  counts,  memory  usage,  or  energy
              consumption  for jobs and nodes. There are interfaces in this plugin to collect data as step start
              and completion, task start and completion, and at the account gather frequency. The data collected
              at the node level is related to jobs only in case of exclusive job allocation.

              Configurable values at present are:

              <b>acct_gather_profile/hdf5</b>
                                  This enables the HDF5 plugin. The directory where the profile files are stored
                                  and which values are collected are configured in the acct_gather.conf file.

              <b>acct_gather_profile/influxdb</b>
                                  This enables the influxdb plugin. The influxdb instance host, port,  database,
                                  retention  policy  and  which  values  are  collected  are  configured  in the
                                  acct_gather.conf file.

       <b>AllowSpecResourcesUsage</b>
              If set to "YES", Slurm allows individual jobs to override node's configured  CoreSpecCount  value.
              For  a  job  to  take  advantage  of  this  feature,  a command line option of --core-spec must be
              specified. The default value for this option is "YES" for Cray systems and "NO" for  other  system
              types.

       <b>AuthAltTypes</b>
              Comma-separated  list  of  alternative  authentication  plugins that the slurmctld will permit for
              communication. Acceptable values at present include <b>auth/jwt</b>.

              <b>NOTE</b>: If <b>AuthAltParameters</b> is not used to specify  a  path  to  the  required  jwt_hs256.key  then
              slurmctld  will default to looking for it in the <b>StateSaveLocation</b>.  The jwt_hs256.key should only
              be visible to the SlurmUser and root. It is not suggested to place the jwt_hs256.key on any  nodes
              other  than  the  machine  running  <b>slurmctld</b>  and  the machine running <b>slurmdbd</b>.  <b>auth/jwt</b> can be
              activated by the presence of the <u>SLURM_JWT</u> environment variable. When activated, it will  override
              the default <b>AuthType</b>.

       <b>AuthAltParameters</b>
              Used  to  define  alternative  authentication  plugins  options.  Multiple  options  may  be comma
              separated.

              <b>disable_token_creation</b>
                             Disable "scontrol token" use by non-SlurmUser accounts.

              <b>max_token_lifespan</b>=&lt;seconds&gt;
                             Set max lifespan (in seconds) for any token  generated  for  user  accounts.  Limit
                             applies to all users except SlurmUser. Sites wishing to have per user limits should
                             generate  tokens using JWT-compatible tools, andor an authenticating proxy, instead
                             of using <u>scontrol</u> <u>token</u>.

              <b>jwks</b>=          Absolute path to JWKS file. Key should be owned  by  SlurmUser  or  root,  must  be
                             readable  by SlurmUser, with suggested permissions of 0400. It must not be writable
                             by 'other'.  Only RS256 keys are supported, although other key types may be  listed
                             in  the  file. If set, no HS256 key will be loaded by default (and token generation
                             is disabled), although the jwt_key setting may  be  used  to  explicitly  re-enable
                             HS256 key use (and token generation).

              <b>jwt_key</b>=       Absolute  path to JWT key file. Key must be HS256. Key should be owned by SlurmUser
                             or root, must be readable by SlurmUser, with suggested permissions of 0400. It must
                             not be accessible by 'other'.  If not set, the default key file is jwt_hs256.key in
                             <u>StateSaveLocation</u>.

              <b>userclaimfield</b>=
                             Use an alternative claim field for the Slurm UserName <b>sun</b>  field.  This  option  is
                             designed to allow compatibility with tokens generated outside of Slurm. (This field
                             may also be known as a grant.)  Default: (disabled)

       <b>AuthInfo</b>
              Additional  information  to be used for authentication of communications between the Slurm daemons
              (slurmctld and slurmd) and the Slurm clients. The interpretation of this option is specific to the
              configured <b>AuthType</b>.  Multiple options may  be  specified  in  a  comma-delimited  list.   If  not
              specified, the default authentication information will be used.

              <b>cred_expire</b>   Default job step credential lifetime, in seconds (e.g. "cred_expire=1200").  It must
                            be  sufficiently  long  enough  to  load user environment, run prolog, deal with the
                            slurmd getting paged out of memory, etc.  This also controls how long a requeued job
                            must wait before starting again.  The default value is 120 seconds.

              <b>socket</b>        Path     name     to     a     MUNGE     daemon     socket     to     use      (e.g.
                            "socket=/var/run/munge/munge.socket.2").        The       default      value      is
                            "/var/run/munge/munge.socket.2".  Used by <u>auth/munge</u> and <u>cred/munge</u>.

              <b>ttl</b>           Credential lifetime, in seconds (e.g. "ttl=300").  The default  value  is  dependent
                            upon the MUNGE installation, but is typically 300 seconds.

              <b>use_client_ids</b>
                            Allow  the  <u>auth/slurm</u>  plugin  to  authenticate  users  without relying on the user
                            information from LDAP or the operating system.

       <b>AuthType</b>
              The authentication method for communications between Slurm  components.   All  Slurm  daemons  and
              commands  must be terminated prior to changing the value of <b>AuthType</b> and later restarted.  Changes
              to this value will interrupt outstanding job steps and prevent them from  completing.   Acceptable
              values at present:

              <b>auth/munge</b>
                     Indicates that MUNGE is to be used (default).  (See "https://dun.github.io/munge/" for more
                     information).

              <b>auth/slurm</b>
                     Use Slurm's internal authentication plugin.

       <b>BackupAddr</b>
              Deprecated option, see <b>SlurmctldHost</b>.

       <b>BackupController</b>
              Deprecated option, see <b>SlurmctldHost</b>.

              The  backup controller recovers state information from the <b>StateSaveLocation</b> directory, which must
              be readable and writable from both the primary and backup controllers.  While not essential, it is
              recommended that you specify a backup controller.  See the <b>RELOCATING</b> <b>CONTROLLERS</b> section  if  you
              change this.

       <b>BatchStartTimeout</b>
              The  maximum time (in seconds) that a batch job is permitted for launching before being considered
              missing and releasing the allocation. The default value is 10  (seconds).  Larger  values  may  be
              required  if  more  time is required to execute the <b>Prolog</b>, load user environment variables, or if
              the slurmd daemon gets paged from memory.
              <b>NOTE</b>: The test for a job being successfully launched is only performed when the  Slurm  daemon  on
              the  compute node registers state with the slurmctld daemon on the head node, which happens fairly
              rarely.   Therefore  a  job  will  not  necessarily  be  terminated  if  its  start  time  exceeds
              <b>BatchStartTimeout</b>.   This  configuration  parameter  is  also  applied  to  launch tasks and avoid
              aborting <b>srun</b> commands due to long running <b>Prolog</b> scripts.

       <b>BcastExclude</b>
              Comma-separated  list  of  absolute  directory  paths  to  be  excluded  when  autodetecting   and
              broadcasting  executable  shared  object  dependencies through <b>sbcast</b> or <b>srun</b> <b>--bcast</b>. The keyword
              "<u>none</u>" can be used to indicate that no directory paths should be excluded. The  default  value  is
              "<u><a href="file:/lib">/lib</a>,<a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a>,<a href="file:/lib64">/lib64</a>,<a href="file:/usr/lib64">/usr/lib64</a></u>".  This  option  can  be  overridden by <b>sbcast</b> <b>--exclude</b> and <b>srun</b>
              <b>--bcast-exclude</b>.

       <b>BcastParameters</b>
              Controls sbcast and srun --bcast behavior. Multiple options can be specified in a comma  separated
              list.  Supported values include:

              <b>DestDir</b>=       Destination directory for file being broadcast to allocated compute nodes.  Default
                             value is current working directory, or --chdir for srun if set.

              <b>Compression</b>=   Specify  default  file  compression library to be used.  Supported values are "lz4"
                             and "none".  The default value with the  sbcast  --compress  option  is  "lz4"  and
                             "none" otherwise.  Some compression libraries may be unavailable on some systems.

              <b>send_libs</b>      If  set,  attempt  to  autodetect  and  broadcast  the  executable's  shared object
                             dependencies to allocated compute nodes.  The  files  are  placed  in  a  directory
                             alongside  the  executable.  For  <b>srun</b>  only,  the <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b> is automatically
                             updated to include this cache directory as  well.   This  can  be  overridden  with
                             either <b>sbcast</b> or <b>srun</b> <b>--send-libs</b> option. By default this is disabled.

       <b>BurstBufferType</b>
              The plugin used to manage burst buffers. Unset by default.  Acceptable values at present are:

              <b>burst_buffer/datawarp</b>
                     Use Cray DataWarp API to provide burst buffer functionality.

              <b>burst_buffer/lua</b>
                     This  plugin  provides  hooks  to  an  API that is defined by a Lua script. This plugin was
                     developed to provide system administrators with a  way  to  do  any  task  (not  only  file
                     staging) at different points in a job's life cycle.

       <b>CliFilterPlugins</b>
              A comma-delimited list of command line interface option filter/modification plugins. The specified
              plugins  will  be  executed  in  the  order  listed.   No  cli_filter plugins are used by default.
              Acceptable values at present are:

              <b>cli_filter/lua</b>
                     This plugin allows you to write your own implementation of a cli_filter using lua.

              <b>cli_filter/syslog</b>
                     This  plugin  enables  logging  of   job   submission   activities   performed.   All   the
                     salloc/sbatch/srun options are logged to syslog together with environment variables in JSON
                     format. If the plugin is not the last one in the list it may log values different than what
                     was actually sent to slurmctld.

              <b>cli_filter/user_defaults</b>
                     This  plugin  looks  for  the  file  $HOME/.slurm/defaults  and reads every line of it as a
                     <u>key</u>=<u>value</u>  pair,  where  <u>key</u>  is  any  of  the  job   submission   options   available   to
                     salloc/sbatch/srun and <u>value</u> is a default value defined by the user. For instance:
                     time=1:30
                     mem=2048
                     The  above  will  result  in a user defined default for each of their jobs of "-t 1:30" and
                     "--mem=2048".

       <b>ClusterName</b>
              The name by which this Slurm managed cluster is known in the accounting database. This  is  needed
              to  distinguish  accounting records when multiple clusters report to the same database. Because of
              limitations in some databases, any upper case letters in the name will be silently mapped to lower
              case. In order to avoid confusion, it is recommended that the name be lower case. The cluster name
              must be 40 characters or less in order to comply with the limit on the maximum  length  for  table
              names in MySQL/MariaDB.

       <b>CommunicationParameters</b>
              Comma-separated options identifying communication options.

              <b>block_null_hash</b>
                             Require  all  Slurm  authentication tokens to include a newer (20.11.9 and 21.08.8)
                             payload that provides an additional layer of  security  against  credential  replay
                             attacks.  This  option  should  only  be  enabled  once all Slurm daemons have been
                             upgraded to 20.11.9/21.08.8 or newer, and all jobs that  were  started  before  the
                             upgrade have been completed.

              <b>DisableIPv4</b>    Disable  IPv4  only  operation for all slurm daemons (except slurmdbd). This should
                             also be set in your <b>slurmdbd.conf</b> file.

              <b>EnableIPv6</b>     Enable using IPv6 addresses for all slurm daemons  (except  slurmdbd).  When  using
                             both  IPv4 and IPv6, address family preferences will be based on your <a href="file:/etc/gai.conf">/etc/gai.conf</a>
                             file. This should also be set in your <b>slurmdbd.conf</b> file.

              <b>getnameinfo_cache_timeout</b>
                             When munge is used as AuthType slurmctld makes use of  getnameinfo  to  obtain  the
                             hostname  from  IP  address stored in munge credential. This parameter controls the
                             number of seconds slurmctld should keep the IP to hostname resolution. When set  to
                             0 cache is disabled. The default value is 60.

              <b>keepaliveinterval</b>=Specifies the interval, in seconds, between keepalive probes on idle
                             connections.   This  affects connections between srun and its slurmstepd process as
                             well as all connections to the slurmdbd.  The default is to use the system  default
                             settings.

              <b>keepaliveprobes</b>=Specifies the number of unacknowledged keepalive probes sent before considering
                             the  connection  broken.   This affects connections between srun and its slurmstepd
                             process as well as all connections to the slurmdbd.  The  default  is  to  use  the
                             system default settings.

              <b>keepalivetime</b>=Specifies how long, in seconds,  before a connection is marked as needing a
                             keepalive  probe  as  well  as  how  long  to delay closing a connection to process
                             messages still in the  queue.   This  affects  connections  between  srun  and  its
                             slurmstepd  process  as well as all connections to the slurmdbd.  Longer values can
                             be used to improve reliability of communications in the event of network  failures.
                             The default is for keepalive to be disabled.

              <b>NoCtldInAddrAny</b>
                             Used  to  directly  bind  to  the  address of what the node resolves to running the
                             slurmctld instead of binding messages to any address on  the  node,  which  is  the
                             default.

              <b>NoInAddrAny</b>    Used  to  directly  bind  to  the  address  of what the node resolves to instead of
                             binding messages to any address on the node which is the default.  This  option  is
                             for all daemons/clients except for the slurmctld.

       <b>CompleteWait</b>
              The  time  to wait, in seconds, when any job is in the COMPLETING state before any additional jobs
              are scheduled. This is to attempt to keep jobs on nodes that were recently in use, with  the  goal
              of  preventing  fragmentation.   If set to zero, pending jobs will be started as soon as possible.
              Since a COMPLETING job's resources are released for use by  other  jobs  as  soon  as  the  <b>Epilog</b>
              completes  on  each  individual node, this can result in very fragmented resource allocations.  To
              provide jobs with the minimum response time, a value of zero  is  recommended  (no  waiting).   To
              minimize  fragmentation  of resources, a value equal to <b>KillWait</b> plus two is recommended.  In that
              case, setting <b>KillWait</b> to a small value may be beneficial.  The default value of  <b>CompleteWait</b>  is
              zero seconds.  The value may not exceed 65533.

              <b>NOTE</b>: Setting <b>reduce_completing_frag</b> affects the behavior of <b>CompleteWait</b>.

       <b>CpuFreqDef</b>
              Default  CPU  governor  to  use when running a job step if it has not been explicitly set with the
              --cpu-freq option. Acceptable values at present include one of the following governors:

              <b>Conservative</b>  attempts to use the Conservative CPU governor

              <b>OnDemand</b>      attempts to use the OnDemand CPU governor

              <b>Performance</b>   attempts to use the Performance CPU governor

              <b>PowerSave</b>     attempts to use the PowerSave CPU governor

              Default: Use system default. No attempt to set the governor is made if
                            --cpu-freq option has not been specified.

       <b>CpuFreqGovernors</b>
              List of CPU frequency governors allowed to  be  set  with  the  salloc,  sbatch,  or  srun  option
              --cpu-freq.  Acceptable values at present include:

              <b>OnDemand</b>      attempts to use the OnDemand CPU governor (a default value)

              <b>Performance</b>   attempts to use the Performance CPU governor (a default value)

              <b>PowerSave</b>     attempts to use the PowerSave CPU governor

              <b>SchedUtil</b>     attempts to use the SchedUtil CPU governor

              <b>UserSpace</b>     attempts to use the UserSpace CPU governor (a default value)

              Default: OnDemand, Performance and UserSpace.

       <b>CredType</b>
              The  cryptographic  signature tool to be used in the creation of job step credentials.  Acceptable
              values at present are:

              <b>cred/munge</b>
                     Indicates that Munge is to be used (default).

              <b>cred/slurm</b>
                     Use Slurm's internal credential format.

       <b>DataParserParameters</b>=&lt;<u>data_parser</u>&gt;
              Apply default value for data_parser plugin parameters. See <u>--json</u> or <u>--yaml</u> arguments in <b><a href="../man1/sacct.1.html">sacct</a></b>(1),

              Default: Latest data_parser plugin version with no flags selected.

       <b>DebugFlags</b>
              Defines specific subsystems which should provide more detailed event logging.  Multiple subsystems
              can be specified with comma  separators.   Most  DebugFlags  will  result  in  additional  logging
              messages  for the identified subsystems if <b>SlurmctldDebug</b> is at 'verbose' or higher.  More logging

       <b>DefCpuPerGPU</b>
              Default count of CPUs allocated per allocated GPU. This value is  used  only  if  the  job  didn't
              specify --cpus-per-task and --cpus-per-gpu.

       <b>DefMemPerCPU</b>
              Default  real  memory  size  available  per  usable  allocated  CPU  in  megabytes.  Used to avoid
              over-subscribing memory and causing paging.  <b>DefMemPerCPU</b> would generally be  used  if  individual
              processors   are  allocated  to  jobs  (<b>SelectType=select/cons_tres</b>).   The  default  value  is  0
              (unlimited).  Also see <b>DefMemPerGPU</b>, <b>DefMemPerNode</b> and <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b>.   <b>DefMemPerCPU</b>,  <b>DefMemPerGPU</b>
              and <b>DefMemPerNode</b> are mutually exclusive.

              <b>NOTE</b>: This applies to <b>usable</b> allocated CPUs in a job allocation.  This is important when more than
              one  thread  per core is configured.  If a job requests --threads-per-core with fewer threads on a
              core than exist on the core (or --hint=nomultithread which implies --threads-per-core=1), the  job
              will  be  unable  to use those extra threads on the core and those threads will not be included in
              the memory per CPU calculation. But if the job has access  to  all  threads  on  the  core,  those
              threads  will  be  included  in  the memory per CPU calculation even if the job did not explicitly
              request those threads.

              In the following examples, each core has two threads.

              In this first example, two tasks can run  on  separate  hyperthreads  in  the  same  core  because
              --threads-per-core is not used. The third task uses both threads of the second core. The allocated
              memory per cpu includes all threads:

              <b>$</b> <b>salloc</b> <b>-n3</b> <b>--mem-per-cpu=100</b>
              <b>salloc:</b> <b>Granted</b> <b>job</b> <b>allocation</b> <b>17199</b>

              In this second example, because of --threads-per-core=1, each task is allocated an entire core but
              is  only  able  to  use  one  thread  per  core. Allocated CPUs includes all threads on each core.
              However, allocated memory per cpu includes only the usable thread in each core.

              <b>$</b> <b>salloc</b> <b>-n3</b> <b>--mem-per-cpu=100</b> <b>--threads-per-core=1</b>

       <b>DefMemPerGPU</b>
              Default real memory size available per allocated  GPU  in  megabytes.   The  default  value  is  0
              (unlimited).    Also   see   <b>DefMemPerCPU</b>   and  <b>DefMemPerNode</b>.   <b>DefMemPerCPU</b>,  <b>DefMemPerGPU</b>  and
              <b>DefMemPerNode</b> are mutually exclusive.

       <b>DefMemPerNode</b>
              Default  real  memory  size  available  per  allocated  node  in   megabytes.    Used   to   avoid
              over-subscribing  memory and causing paging.  <b>DefMemPerNode</b> would generally be used if whole nodes
              are   allocated   to   jobs   (<b>SelectType=select/linear</b>)   and   resources   are   over-subscribed
              (<b>OverSubscribe=yes</b>  or  <b>OverSubscribe=force</b>).   The  default  value  is  0  (unlimited).  Also see
              <b>DefMemPerCPU</b>, <b>DefMemPerGPU</b> and <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b>.  <b>DefMemPerCPU</b>,  <b>DefMemPerGPU</b>  and  <b>DefMemPerNode</b>  are
              mutually exclusive.

       <b>DependencyParameters</b>
              Multiple options may be comma separated.

              <b>disable_remote_singleton</b>
                     By default, when a federated job has a singleton dependency, each cluster in the federation
                     must  clear  the  singleton  dependency before the job's singleton dependency is considered
                     satisfied. Enabling this option means that only the origin cluster must clear the singleton
                     dependency. This option must be set in every cluster in the federation.

              <b>kill_invalid_depend</b>
                     If a job has an invalid dependency and it can never run terminate it and set its  state  to
                     be JOB_CANCELLED. By default the job stays pending with reason DependencyNeverSatisfied.

              <b>max_depend_depth</b>=Maximum number of jobs to test for a circular job dependency. Stop testing
                     after this number of job dependencies have been tested. The default value is 10 jobs.

       <b>DisableRootJobs</b>
              If  set  to  "YES"  then  user root will be prevented from running any jobs.  The default value is
              "NO", meaning user root will be able  to  execute  jobs.   <b>DisableRootJobs</b>  may  also  be  set  by
              partition.

       <b>EioTimeout</b>
              The  number of seconds srun waits for slurmstepd to close the TCP/IP connection used to relay data
              between the user application and srun when the user application terminates. The default  value  is
              60 seconds.  May not exceed 65533.

       <b>EnforcePartLimits</b>
              Controls  whether  partition  limits  are  enforced  when  a  job is submitted to the cluster. The
              partition limits being considered by this option are its configured  MaxMemPerCPU,  MaxMemPerNode,
              MinNodes,  MaxNodes,  MaxTime,  AllocNodes,  AllowAccounts,  AllowGroups,  AllowQOS, and QOS usage
              threshold. If set, then a job's QOS can not be used to exceed partition limits.

              <b>ALL</b>    Jobs which exceed the number of nodes in a partition and/or any of  its  configured  limits
                     will  be  rejected  at submission time. If the job is submitted to multiple partitions, the
                     job must satisfy the limits on all the requested partitions.

              <b>ANY</b>    Jobs will be accepted if they  satisfy  the  limits  on  at  least  one  of  the  requested
                     partitions.

              <b>NO</b>     Partition  limits  will  not  be enforced at submit time, but will still be enforced during
                     scheduling. A job that exceeds the limits on all requested partitions  will  remain  queued
                     until the partition limits are altered. This is the default.

       <b>Epilog</b> Pathname  of  a  script  to  execute  as user root on every node when a user's job completes (e.g.
              "/usr/local/slurm/epilog"). If it is not an absolute path name (i.e. it  does  not  start  with  a
              slash),  it will be searched for in the same directory as the slurm.conf file. A glob pattern (See
              <b>glob</b> (7)) may also be used to run more than  one  epilog  script  (e.g.  "/etc/slurm/epilog.d/*").
              When  more  than  one epilog script is configured, they are executed in reverse alphabetical order
              (z-a -&gt; Z-A -&gt; 9-0). The Epilog script(s) may be used to purge files, disable user login, etc.  By
              default there is no epilog.  See <b>Prolog</b> <b>and</b> <b>Epilog</b> <b>Scripts</b> for more information.

              <b>NOTE</b>: It is possible to configure multiple epilog scripts by including  this  option  on  multiple
              lines.

       <b>EpilogMsgTime</b>
              The  number  of  microseconds  that  the slurmctld daemon requires to process an epilog completion
              message from the slurmd daemons. This  parameter  can  be  used  to  prevent  a  burst  of  epilog
              completion  messages  from being sent at the same time which should help prevent lost messages and
              improve throughput for large jobs.  The default value is 2000 microseconds.  For a 1000 node  job,
              this spreads the epilog completion messages out over two seconds.

       <b>EpilogSlurmctld</b>
              Fully  qualified  pathname  of  a  program  for the slurmctld to execute upon termination of a job
              allocation (e.g.  "/usr/local/slurm/epilog_controller").  The program executes as SlurmUser, which
              gives it permission to drain nodes and requeue the job if  a  failure  occurs  (See  <a href="../man1/scontrol.1.html">scontrol</a>(1)).
              Exactly  what the program does and how it accomplishes this is completely at the discretion of the
              system administrator.  Information about the job being initiated, its allocated  nodes,  etc.  are
              passed  to  the  program  using  environment  variables.   See  <b>Prolog</b> <b>and</b> <b>Epilog</b> <b>Scripts</b> for more
              information.

              <b>NOTE</b>: It is possible to configure multiple epilog scripts by including  this  option  on  multiple
              lines.

       <b>FairShareDampeningFactor</b>
              Dampen  the effect of exceeding a user or group's fair share of allocated resources. Higher values
              will provides greater ability to differentiate between exceeding the fair  share  at  high  levels
              (e.g.  a  value of 1 results in almost no difference between overconsumption by a factor of 10 and
              100, while a value of 5 will result in a significant difference in priority).  The  default  value
              is 1.

       <b>FederationParameters</b>
              Used to define federation options. Multiple options may be comma separated.

              <b>fed_display</b>
                     If  set,  then  the  client  status commands (e.g. squeue, sinfo, sprio, etc.) will display
                     information in a federated view by default. This option is functionally equivalent to using
                     the --federation options on each command. Use the client's --local option to  override  the
                     federated view and get a local view of the given cluster.

                     Allow  client  commands  to  use  the  --cluster  option  even when the <b>slurmdbd</b> is down by
                     retrieving cluster records from <b>slurmctld</b> instead.

       <b>FirstJobId</b>
              The job id to be used for the first  job  submitted  to  Slurm.   Job  id  values  generated  will
              incremented  by  1  for each subsequent job.  Value must be larger than 0. The default value is 1.
              Also see <b>MaxJobId</b>

       <b>GetEnvTimeout</b>
              Controls how long the job  should  wait  (in  seconds)  to  load  the  user's  environment  before
              attempting  to load it from a cache file.  Applies when the salloc or sbatch <u>--get-user-env</u> option
              is used.  If set to 0 then always load the user's environment from the cache  file.   The  default
              value is 2 seconds.

       <b>GresTypes</b>
              A  comma-delimited  list  of  generic  resources  to  be managed (e.g.  <u>GresTypes=gpu,mps</u>).  These
              resources may have an associated GRES plugin of the same name providing additional  functionality.
              No generic resources are managed by default.  Ensure this parameter is consistent across all nodes
              in the cluster for proper operation.

       <b>GroupUpdateForce</b>
              If  set  to  a non-zero value, then information about which users are members of groups allowed to
              use a partition will be updated periodically,  even  when  there  have  been  no  changes  to  the
              <a href="file:/etc/group">/etc/group</a>  file.   If  set  to  zero,  group  member  information  will be updated only after the
              <a href="file:/etc/group">/etc/group</a> file is updated.  The default value is 1.  Also see the <b>GroupUpdateTime</b> parameter.

       <b>GroupUpdateTime</b>
              Controls how frequently information about which users are members  of  groups  allowed  to  use  a
              partition  will  be  updated,  and  how long user group membership lists will be cached.  The time
              interval is given in seconds with a default value of 600 seconds.  A value of  zero  will  prevent
              periodic updating of group membership information.  Also see the <b>GroupUpdateForce</b> parameter.

       <b>GpuFreqDef</b>=[&lt;<u>type</u>]=<u>value</u>&gt;[,&lt;<u>type</u>=<u>value</u>&gt;]
              Default  GPU  frequency to use when running a job step if it has not been explicitly set using the
              --gpu-freq option.  This option can be used to independently configure  the  GPU  and  its  memory
              frequencies.   There is no default value. If unset, no attempt to change the GPU frequency is made
              if the --gpu-freq option has not been set.  After the job is completed,  the  frequencies  of  all
              affected  GPUs will be reset to the highest possible values.  In some cases, system power caps may
              override the requested values.  The field <u>type</u> can be "memory".  If <u>type</u> is not specified, the GPU
              frequency is implied.  The <u>value</u> field can either  be  "low",  "medium",  "high",  "highm1"  or  a
              numeric  value  in  megahertz  (MHz).   If the specified numeric value is not possible, a value as
              close as possible will be used.  See below for definition of the values.  Examples of use  include
              "GpuFreqDef=medium,memory=high and "GpuFreqDef=450".

              Supported <u>value</u> definitions:

              <b>low</b>       the lowest available frequency.

              <b>medium</b>    attempts to set a frequency in the middle of the available range.

              <b>high</b>      the highest available frequency.

              <b>highm1</b>    (high minus one) will select the next highest available frequency.

       <b>HashPlugin</b>
              Identifies the type of hash plugin to use for network communication.  Acceptable values include:

              <b>hash/k12</b>       Hashes  are  generated  by the KangorooTwelve cryptographic hash function.  This is
                             the default.

              <b>hash/sha3</b>      Hashes are generated by the SHA-3 cryptographic hash function.

              <b>NOTE</b>: Make sure that HashPlugin has the same value both in slurm.conf and in slurmdbd.conf.

       <b>HealthCheckInterval</b>
              The interval in seconds between executions of <b>HealthCheckProgram</b>.   The  default  value  is  zero,
              which disables execution.

       <b>HealthCheckNodeState</b>
              Identify  what  node  states  should execute the <b>HealthCheckProgram</b>.  Multiple state values may be
              specified with a comma separator.  The default value is ANY to execute on nodes in any state.

              <b>ALLOC</b>       Run on nodes in the ALLOC state (all CPUs allocated).

              <b>ANY</b>         Run on nodes in any state.

              <b>CYCLE</b>       Rather than running the health check program on all nodes  at  the  same  time,  cycle
                          through  running  on  all compute nodes through the course of the <b>HealthCheckInterval</b>.
                          May be combined with the various node state options.

              <b>IDLE</b>        Run on nodes in the IDLE state.

              <b>NONDRAINED_IDLE</b>
                          Run on nodes that are in the IDLE state and not DRAINED.

              <b>MIXED</b>       Run on nodes in the MIXED state (some CPUs idle and other CPUs allocated).

       <b>HealthCheckProgram</b>
              Fully qualified pathname of a script to execute as user root periodically  on  all  compute  nodes
              that  are  <b>not</b>  in  the NOT_RESPONDING state. This program may be used to verify the node is fully
              operational and DRAIN the node or send email if a problem is detected.  Any  action  to  be  taken
              must  be  explicitly  performed  by  the  program  (e.g.  execute  "scontrol  update  NodeName=foo
              State=drain Reason=tmp_file_system_full" to drain a node).  The execution interval  is  controlled
              using the <b>HealthCheckInterval</b> parameter.  Note that the <b>HealthCheckProgram</b> will be executed at the
              same time on all nodes to minimize its impact upon parallel programs.  This program will be killed
              if  it does not terminate normally within 60 seconds.  This program will also be executed when the
              slurmd daemon is first started and before it registers with the slurmctld daemon.  By default,  no
              program will be executed.

       <b>InactiveLimit</b>
              The  interval,  in  seconds,  after  which  a  non-responsive job allocation command (e.g. <b>srun</b> or
              <b>salloc</b>) will result in the job being terminated. If the node on  which  the  command  is  executed
              fails  or  the command abnormally terminates, this will terminate its job allocation.  This option
              has no effect upon batch jobs.  When setting a value, take  into  consideration  that  a  debugger
              using  <b>srun</b>  to  launch  an application may leave the <b>srun</b> command in a stopped state for extended
              periods of time.  This limit is ignored for jobs running in partitions with the <b>RootOnly</b> flag  set
              (the  scheduler  running as root will be responsible for the job).  The default value is unlimited
              (zero) and may not exceed 65533 seconds.

       <b>InteractiveStepOptions</b>
              When LaunchParameters=use_interactive_step is enabled, launching salloc will  automatically  start
              an  srun process with InteractiveStepOptions to launch a terminal on a node in the job allocation.
              The default value is "--interactive --preserve-env --pty $SHELL".  The "--interactive"  option  is
              intentionally   not   documented  in  the  srun  man  page.  It  is  meant  only  to  be  used  in
              <b>InteractiveStepOptions</b> in order to create an "interactive step" that will not consume resources so
              that other steps may run in parallel with the interactive step.

       <b>JobAcctGatherType</b>
              The JobAcctGather plugin collects memory, cpu, io, interconnect, energy and gpu usage  information
              at the task level, depending on which plugins are configured in Slurm. This parameter will control
              how some of these metrics will be collected. Unset by default.

              Configurable values at present are:

              <b>jobacct_gather/cgroup</b> (recommended)
                                  Collect  cpu  and  memory  statistics  by  reading the task's cgroup directory
                                  interfaces (e.g. memory.stat, cpu.stat) by issuing a call  to  the  configured
                                  CgroupPlugin    (see    "man    cgroup.conf").     This    mechanism   ignores
                                  JobAcctGatherParams=UsePSS or NoShared since these are used only when  reading
                                  memory usage from the proc filesystem.

              <b>jobacct_gather/linux</b>
                                  Collect  cpu and memory statistics by reading procfs. The plugin will take all
                                  the pids of the task and for each of  them  will  read  <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;/stats.  If
                                  UsePSS  is  set  it will also read <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;/smaps, and if NoShare is set it
                                  will  also  read   <a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a>&lt;pid&gt;/statm   (see   <b>JobAcctGatherParams</b>   for   more
                                  information).

                                  This  plugin  carries  a  performance  penalty  on jobs with a large number of
                                  spawned processes since it needs  to  iterate  over  all  the  task  pids  and
                                  aggregate the stats into one single metric for the ppid, and then these values
                                  need to be aggregated to the task stats.

              <b>NOTE</b>:  Changing  the  plugin  type  when  jobs are running in the cluster is possible. The already
              running steps will keep using the previous plugin mechanism, while new  steps  will  use  the  new
              mechanism.

       <b>JobAcctGatherFrequency</b>
              The job accounting and profiling sampling intervals.  The supported format is follows:

              <b>JobAcctGatherFrequency</b>=&lt;<u>datatype</u>&gt;=&lt;<u>interval</u>&gt;
                          where   <u>&lt;datatype&gt;</u>=<u>&lt;interval&gt;</u>   specifies   the   task   sampling   interval  for  the
                          jobacct_gather  plugin  or  a  sampling  interval  for  a  profiling   type   by   the
                          acct_gather_profile  plugin. Multiple, comma-separated <u>&lt;datatype&gt;</u>=<u>&lt;interval&gt;</u> intervals
                          may be specified. Supported datatypes are as follows:

                          Affects accounting and profiling:

                                 <b>task</b>=&lt;<u>interval</u>&gt;
                                        where &lt;<u>interval</u>&gt; is the  task  sampling  interval  in  seconds  for  the
                                        jobacct_gather plugins and for task profiling by the acct_gather_profile
                                        plugin.

                          Affects profiling only:

                                 <b>energy</b>=&lt;<u>interval</u>&gt;
                                        where  <u>&lt;interval&gt;</u>  is  the  sampling  interval  in  seconds  for  energy
                                        profiling using the acct_gather_energy plugin

                                 <b>network</b>=&lt;<u>interval</u>&gt;
                                        where <u>&lt;interval&gt;</u> is the sampling  interval  in  seconds  for  infiniband
                                        profiling using the acct_gather_interconnect plugin.

                                 <b>filesystem</b>=&lt;<u>interval</u>&gt;
                                        where  <u>&lt;interval&gt;</u>  is  the  sampling  interval in seconds for filesystem
                                        profiling using the acct_gather_filesystem plugin.

              The default value for task sampling interval is 30  seconds.  The  default  value  for  all  other
              intervals  is  0.  An interval of 0 disables sampling of the specified type.  If the task sampling
              interval is 0, accounting information is collected only at job termination,  which  reduces  Slurm
              interference  with  the  job,  but  also  means  that the statistics about a job don't reflect the
              average or maximum of several  samples  throughout  the  life  of  the  job,  but  just  show  the
              information collected in the single sample.
              Smaller (non-zero) values have a greater impact upon job performance, but a value of 30 seconds is
              not likely to be noticeable for applications having less than 10,000 tasks.
              Users  can  independently  override each interval on a per job basis using the <b>--acctg-freq</b> option
              when submitting the job.
              This value should be lower or equal to <b>EnergyIPMIFreq</b> when using  <u>acct_gather_energy/ipmi</u>  or  xcc
              plugins as otherwise it will unnecessarily get repeated values on successive polls.

       <b>JobAcctGatherParams</b>
              Arbitrary parameters for the job account gather plugin.  Acceptable values at present include:

              <b>NoShared</b>            Exclude  shared memory from RSS. This option cannot be used with UsePSS.  Only
                                  compatible with <b>jobacct_gather/linux</b> plugin.

              <b>UsePss</b>              Use PSS value instead of RSS to calculate real usage of memory. The PSS  value
                                  will  be  saved  as  RSS.  This  option  cannot  be  used  with NoShared. Only
                                  compatible with <b>jobacct_gather/linux</b> plugin.

              <b>OverMemoryKill</b>      Kill processes that are being detected to use more memory  than  requested  by
                                  steps  every  time  accounting  information  is  gathered by the JobAcctGather
                                  plugin.  This parameter should be used with caution because  a  job  exceeding
                                  its memory allocation may affect other processes and/or machine health.

                                  <b>NOTE</b>:  If available, it is recommended to limit memory by enabling task/cgroup
                                  as a TaskPlugin and making use of  ConstrainRAMSpace=yes  in  the  cgroup.conf
                                  instead  of  using  this JobAcctGather mechanism for memory enforcement. Using
                                  JobAcctGather is polling based and there is a delay before a  job  is  killed,
                                  which could lead to system Out of Memory events.

                                  <b>NOTE</b>:  When  using  <b>OverMemoryKill</b>,  if  the  combined  memory used by all the
                                  processes in a step  exceeds  the  memory  limit,  the  entire  step  will  be
                                  killed/cancelled  by the JobAcctGather plugin.  This differs from the behavior
                                  when using <b>ConstrainRAMSpace</b>, where processes in the step will be killed,  but
                                  the step will be left active, possibly with other processes left running.

              <b>DisableGPUAcct</b>      Do  not  do accounting of GPU usage and skip any gpu driver library call. This
                                  parameter can help to improve performance if the GPU driver response is slow.

       <b>JobCompHost</b>
              The name of the machine hosting the job completion database.  Only used for database type  storage
              plugins, ignored otherwise.

       <b>JobCompLoc</b>
              This option sets a string which has different meanings depending on <b>JobCompType</b>:

              If <b>jobcomp/elasticsearch</b>:
                     Instructs  this  plugin  to  send the finished job records information to the Elasticsearch
                     server URL endpoint (including the port number and the target  index)  configured  in  this
                     option. This string should typically take the form of <u>&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;target&gt;/_doc</u>. There is
                     no default value for JobCompLoc when this plugin is enabled.

                     <b>NOTE</b>: Refer to &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/elasticsearch.html&gt; for more information.

              If <b>jobcomp/filetxt</b>:
                     Instructs  this plugin to send the finished job records information to a file configured in
                     this option. This string should represent an absolute path to a file. The default value for
                     this plugin is <u>/var/log/slurm_jobcomp.log</u>.

              If <b>jobcomp/kafka</b>:
                     When this plugin is configured, finished job records information is sent to a Kafka server.
                     The plugin makes use of <b>librdkafka</b>. This string represents  an  absolute  path  to  a  file
                     containing  'key=value'  pairs  configuring  the  library  behavior. For the plugin to work
                     properly, this file needs to exist and  least  the  <u>bootstrap.servers</u>  <b>librdkafka</b>  property
                     needs  to be configured in it. There is no default value for JobCompLoc when this plugin is
                     enabled.

                     <b>NOTE</b>: For a full list of <b>librdkafka</b> properties, please refer to the library  documentation.
                     You     can     also    view    the    jobcomp_kafka    page    for    more    information:
                     &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/jobcomp_kafka.html&gt;

                     <b>NOTE</b>:  The  target  Kafka  topic  and  other  plugin  parameters  can  be  configured   via
                     <b>JobCompParams</b>.

              If <b>jobcomp/lua</b>:
                     This  option is ignored in this plugin. The finished job record is processed by a hardcoded
                     <u>jobcomp.lua</u> script expected to be located in the same location of slurm.conf. There  is  no
                     default value for JobCompLoc when this plugin is enabled.

              If <b>jobcomp/mysql</b>:
                     Instructs  this  plugin  to  send  the  finished job records information to a database name
                     configured in this option. This string should represent a database name.  The default value
                     for this plugin is <u>slurm_jobcomp_db</u>.

              If <b>jobcomp/script</b>:
                     The finished job record  information  is  made  available  via  environment  variables  and
                     processed  by  a script with name configured by this option. This string should represent a
                     path to a script. There is no default value for JobCompLoc when this plugin is enabled.  It
                     needs to be explicitly configured or the plugin will fail to initialize.

       <b>JobCompParams</b>
              Pass arbitrary text string to job completion plugin.  Also see <b>JobCompType</b>.

              Optional comma-separated list for <b>jobcomp/kafka</b>:

                     <b>flush_timeout</b>=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
                            Maximum  time (in milliseconds) to wait for all outstanding produce requests, et.al,
                            to be completed. This is passed as a timeout argument to the  <b>librdkafka</b>  flush  API
                            function,  called  on  plugin  termination.  This  is  done  prior to destroying the
                            producer instance to make  sure  all  queued  and  in-flight  produce  requests  are
                            completed   before  terminating.   For  non-blocking  calls,  set  to  0.   To  wait
                            indefinitely for an event, set to -1 (not  recommended,  since  this  is  called  on
                            plugin  fini  and  could block slurmctld graceful termination).  Accepted values are
                            [-1,2147483647].  Defaults to 500 (milliseconds).

                     <b>poll_interval</b>=&lt;seconds&gt;
                            Seconds between calls to <b>librdkafka</b> API poll  function,  which  polls  the  provided
                            Kafka handle for events. The plugin spawns a separate thread to perform this call at
                            the  configured  interval.   Accepted  values  are  [0,4294967295].   Defaults  to 2
                            (seconds).

                     <b>requeue_on_msg_timeout</b>
                            Instruct the delivery report callback  to  requeue  messages  that  failed  delivery
                            because  their  time waiting for successful delivery reached the <b>librdkafka</b> property
                            <b>message.timeout.ms</b>.  Defaults to not set  (don't  requeue  and  thus  discard  these
                            messages).

                     <b>topic</b>=&lt;string&gt;
                            Target Kafka topic to send messages to.  Defaults to <b>ClusterName</b>.

       <b>JobCompPass</b>
              The  password used to gain access to the database to store the job completion data.  Only used for
              database type storage plugins, ignored otherwise.

       <b>JobCompPort</b>
              The listening port of the job completion database server.  Only used  for  database  type  storage
              plugins, ignored otherwise.

       <b>JobCompType</b>
              The  job  completion  logging  mechanism  type.  Unset  by  default.  Acceptable values at present
              include:

              <b>jobcomp/elasticsearch</b>
                     Upon job completion, a record of the job should be  written  to  an  Elasticsearch  server,
                     specified by the <b>JobCompLoc</b> parameter.
                     <b>NOTE</b>:     More     information    is    available    at    the    Slurm    web    site    (
                     https://slurm.schedmd.com/elasticsearch.html ).

              <b>jobcomp/filetxt</b>
                     Upon job completion, a record of the job should be written to a text file, specified by the
                     <b>JobCompLoc</b> parameter.

              <b>jobcomp/kafka</b>
                     Upon job completion, a record of the job should be sent to a Kafka server, specified by the
                     file path referenced in <b>JobCompLoc</b> and/or using other <b>JobCompParams</b>.

              <b>jobcomp/lua</b>
                     Upon job completion, a record of the job should be processed  by  the  <u>jobcomp.lua</u>  script,
                     located in the default script directory (typically the subdirectory <u>etc</u> of the installation
                     directory.

              <b>jobcomp/mysql</b>
                     Upon  job completion, a record of the job should be written to a MySQL or MariaDB database,
                     specified by the <b>JobCompLoc</b> parameter.

              <b>jobcomp/script</b>
                     Upon job completion, a script specified by the <b>JobCompLoc</b> parameter is to be executed  with
                     environment variables providing the job information.

       <b>JobCompUser</b>
              The  user  account for accessing the job completion database.  Only used for database type storage
              plugins, ignored otherwise.

       <b>JobContainerType</b>
              Identifies the plugin  to  be  used  for  job  isolation  through  Linux  namespaces.   <b>NOTE</b>:  See
              <b>ProctrackType</b> for resource containment and usage tracking.  Acceptable values at present include:

              <b>job_container/tmpfs</b> Used  to  create  a private namespace on the filesystem for jobs, which houses
                                  temporary file systems (<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> and <a href="file:/dev/shm">/dev/shm</a>) for each job. 'PrologFlags=Contain'
                                  must be set to use this plugin.

       <b>JobFileAppend</b>
              This option controls what to do if a job's output or error file exist when the job is started.  If
              <b>JobFileAppend</b> is set to a value of 1, then append to the existing file.  By default, any  existing
              file is truncated.

       <b>JobRequeue</b>
              This  option  controls  the  default  ability for batch jobs to be requeued.  Jobs may be requeued
              explicitly by a system administrator, after node failure, or upon preemption by a higher  priority
              job.   If  <b>JobRequeue</b>  is  set  to a value of 1, then batch jobs may be requeued unless explicitly
              disabled by the user.  If <b>JobRequeue</b> is set to a value of 0, then batch jobs will not be  requeued
              unless  explicitly enabled by the user.  Use the <b>sbatch</b> <u>--no-requeue</u> or <u>--requeue</u> option to change
              the default behavior for individual jobs.  The default value is 1.

       <b>JobSubmitPlugins</b>
              These are intended to be site-specific plugins which can be used to  set  default  job  parameters
              and/or  logging  events.  Slurm  can  be configured to use multiple job_submit plugins if desired,
              which must be specified as a comma-delimited list and will be executed in the order listed.
              e.g. for multiple job_submit plugin configuration:
              JobSubmitPlugins=lua,require_timelimit
              Take  a   look   at   &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_submit_plugins.html&gt;   for   further   plugin
              implementation  details.  No  job  submission  plugins  are  used by default.  Currently available
              plugins are:

              <b>all_partitions</b>          Set default partition to all partitions on the cluster.

              <b>defaults</b>                Set default values for job submission or modify requests.

              <b>logging</b>                 Log select job submission and modification parameters.

              <b>lua</b>                     Execute a Lua script implementing site's own job_submit  logic.  Only  one
                                      Lua script will be executed. It must be named "job_submit.lua" and must be
                                      located in the default configuration directory (typically the subdirectory
                                      "etc" of the installation directory). Sample Lua scripts can be found with
                                      the  Slurm  distribution,  in  the  directory contribs/lua. Slurmctld will
                                      fatal on startup if the configured lua script is invalid. Slurm  will  try
                                      to  load  the  script  for each job submission. If the script is broken or
                                      removed while slurmctld is running, Slurm will fallback  to  the  previous
                                      working  version of the script.  <b>Warning</b>: slurmctld runs this script while
                                      holding internal locks, and only a single copy of this script can run at a
                                      time. This blocks most concurrency in slurmctld.  Therefore,  this  script
                                      should run to completion as quickly as possible.

              <b>partition</b>               Set  a  job's  default  partition based upon job submission parameters and
                                      available partitions.

              <b>pbs</b>                     Translate PBS job submission options to Slurm equivalent (if possible).

              <b>require_timelimit</b>       Force job submissions to specify a timelimit.

              <b>NOTE</b>:   For   examples   of   use   see   the   Slurm   code   in   "src/plugins/job_submit"   and
              "contribs/lua/job_submit*.lua" then modify the code to satisfy your needs.

       <b>KillOnBadExit</b>
              If set to 1, a step will be terminated immediately if any task is crashed or aborted, as indicated
              by  a  non-zero  exit  code.   With  the default value of 0, if one of the processes is crashed or
              aborted the other processes will continue to run while the crashed or aborted process  waits.  The
              user can override this configuration parameter by using srun's <b>-K</b>, <b>--kill-on-bad-exit</b>.

       <b>KillWait</b>
              The  interval, in seconds, given to a job's processes between the SIGTERM and SIGKILL signals upon
              reaching its time limit.  If the job fails to terminate gracefully in the interval  specified,  it
              will be forcibly terminated.  The default value is 30 seconds.  The value may not exceed 65533.

       <b>MaxBatchRequeue</b>
              Maximum  number  of  times  a  batch  job  may  be  automatically  requeued before being marked as
              JobHeldAdmin.  (Mainly  useful  when  the  <b>SchedulerParameters</b>  option  <b>nohold_on_prolog_fail</b>   is
              enabled.)  The default value is 5.

       <b>NodeFeaturesPlugins</b>
              Identifies  the plugins to be used for support of node features which can change through time. For
              example, a node which might be booted with various BIOS setting. This is supported through the use
              of a node's active_features and available_features  information.   Acceptable  values  at  present
              include:

              <b>node_features/knl_cray</b>
                     Used   only   for   Intel   Knights   Landing   processors  (KNL)  on  Cray  systems.   See
                     https://slurm.schedmd.com/intel_knl.html for more information.

              <b>node_features/knl_generic</b>
                     Used  for  Intel  Knights  Landing  processors  (KNL)  on  a  generic  Linux  system.   See
                     https://slurm.schedmd.com/intel_knl.html for more information.

              <b>node_features/helpers</b>
                     Used  to  report  and  modify  features  on nodes using arbitrary scripts or programs.  See
                     helpers.conf man page for more information: https://slurm.schedmd.com/helpers.conf.html

       <b>LaunchParameters</b>
              Identifies options to the job launch plugin.  Acceptable values include:

              <b>batch_step_set_cpu_freq</b> Set the cpu frequency  for  the  batch  step  from  given  --cpu-freq,  or
                                      slurm.conf  CpuFreqDef,  option.  By  default only steps started with srun
                                      will utilize the cpu freq setting options.

                                      <b>NOTE</b>: If you are using srun to launch your steps  inside  a  batch  script
                                      (advised)  this option will create a situation where you may have multiple
                                      agents setting the cpu_freq as the batch step usually  runs  on  the  same
                                      resources one or more steps the sruns in the script will create.

              <b>cray_net_exclusive</b>      Allow  jobs  on  a  Cray XC cluster exclusive access to network resources.
                                      This should only be set on clusters providing  exclusive  access  to  each
                                      node to a single job at once, and not using parallel steps within the job,
                                      otherwise resources on the node can be oversubscribed.

              <b>enable_nss_slurm</b>        Permits passwd and group resolution for a job to be serviced by slurmstepd
                                      rather  than  requiring  a  lookup  from  a  network  based  service.  See
                                      https://slurm.schedmd.com/nss_slurm.html for more information.

              <b>lustre_no_flush</b>         If set on a Cray XC cluster, then do not flush the  Lustre  cache  on  job
                                      step  completion.  This setting will only take effect after reconfiguring,
                                      and will only take effect for newly launched jobs.

              <b>mem_sort</b>                Sort NUMA memory at step  start.  User  can  override  this  default  with
                                      SLURM_MEM_BIND  environment  variable  or  --mem-bind=nosort  command line
                                      option.

              <b>mpir_use_nodeaddr</b>       When launching tasks Slurm creates entries in MPIR_proctable that are used
                                      by parallel debuggers, profilers, and related tools to attach  to  running
                                      process.   By  default  the  MPIR_proctable  entries contain MPIR_procdesc
                                      structures where the host_name is set to  NodeName  by  default.  If  this
                                      option is specified, NodeAddr will be used in this context instead.

              <b>disable_send_gids</b>       By default, the slurmctld will look up and send the user_name and extended
                                      gids  for  a  job,  rather than independently on each node as part of each
                                      task launch.  This helps mitigate issues around name  service  scalability
                                      when  launching  jobs involving many nodes. Using this option will disable
                                      this  functionality.  This  option  is  ignored  if  enable_nss_slurm   is
                                      specified.

              <b>slurmstepd_memlock</b>      Lock the slurmstepd process's current memory in RAM.

              <b>slurmstepd_memlock_all</b>  Lock the slurmstepd process's current and future memory in RAM.

              <b>test_exec</b>               Have  srun  verify  existence  of  the  executable program along with user
                                      execute permission on the node where srun was called before attempting  to
                                      launch it on nodes in the step.

              <b>use_interactive_step</b>    Have  salloc  use  the  Interactive Step to launch a shell on an allocated
                                      compute node rather than locally to wherever salloc was invoked.  This  is
                                      accomplished  by launching the srun command with InteractiveStepOptions as
                                      options.

                                      This does not affect salloc called with a command as  an  argument.  These
                                      jobs will continue to be executed as the calling user on the calling host.

              <b>ulimit_pam_adopt</b>        When  pam_slurm_adopt  is  used  to  join  an  external process into a job
                                      cgroup, RLIMIT_RSS is set, as is done for tasks running in regular steps.

       <b>Licenses</b>
              Specification of licenses (or other resources available on all nodes of the cluster) which can  be
              allocated  to  jobs.  License names can optionally be followed by a colon and count with a default
              count of one.  Multiple license names should  be  comma  separated  (e.g.   "Licenses=foo:4,bar").
              Note  that Slurm prevents jobs from being scheduled if their required license specification is not
              available.  Slurm does not prevent jobs from using licenses that are not explicitly listed in  the
              job submission specification.

       <b>LogTimeFormat</b>
              Format  of  the  timestamp  in  slurmctld  and  slurmd  log  files. Accepted format values include
              "iso8601", "iso8601_ms", "rfc5424", "rfc5424_ms", "rfc3339", "clock", "short" and "thread_id". The
              values ending in "_ms" differ from the ones without in that fractional  seconds  with  millisecond
              precision  are  printed.  The default value is "iso8601_ms". The "rfc5424" formats are the same as
              the "iso8601" formats except that the timezone value is also shown.  The "clock"  format  shows  a
              timestamp  in microseconds retrieved with the C standard clock() function. The "short" format is a
              short date and time format. The "thread_id" format shows the timestamp in the C  standard  ctime()
              function  form  without  the  year but including the microseconds, the daemon's process ID and the
              current thread name and ID.  A special option "format_stderr" can be added  to  the  format  as  a
              comma  separated value (e.g. "LogTimeFormat=iso8601_ms,format_stderr"). It will change the default
              format of the logs on stderr stream by prepending the timestamp as specified by <b>LogTimeFormat</b>.

       <b>MailDomain</b>
              Domain name to qualify usernames if email address is not explicitly given with  the  "--mail-user"
              option.  If  unset, the local MTA will need to qualify local address itself. Changes to MailDomain
              will only affect new jobs.

       <b>MailProg</b>
              Fully qualified pathname to the program used to send email per user request.  The default value is
              "/bin/mail" (or "/usr/bin/mail" if "/bin/mail" does not exist  but  "/usr/bin/mail"  does  exist).
              The  program  is  called  with arguments suitable for the default mail command, however additional
              information about the job is passed in the form of environment variables.

              Additional variables are the same as those passed  to  <u>PrologSlurmctld</u>  and  <u>EpilogSlurmctld</u>  with
              additional variables in the following contexts:

              <b>ALL</b>

                     <b>SLURM_JOB_STATE</b>
                            The base state of the job when the MailProg is called.

                     <b>SLURM_JOB_MAIL_TYPE</b>
                            The mail type triggering the mail.

              <b>BEGIN</b>

                     <b>SLURM_JOB_QEUEUED_TIME</b>
                            The amount of time the job was queued.

              <b>END,</b> <b>FAIL,</b> <b>REQUEUE,</b> <b>TIME_LIMIT_*</b>

                     <b>SLURM_JOB_RUN_TIME</b>
                            The amount of time the job ran for.

              <b>END,</b> <b>FAIL</b>

                     <b>SLURM_JOB_EXIT_CODE_MAX</b>
                            Job's exit code or highest exit code for an array job.

                     <b>SLURM_JOB_EXIT_CODE_MIN</b>
                            Job's minimum exit code for an array job.

                     <b>SLURM_JOB_TERM_SIGNAL_MAX</b>
                            Job's highest signal for an array job.

              <b>STAGE_OUT</b>

                     <b>SLURM_JOB_STAGE_OUT_TIME</b>
                            Job's staging out time.

       <b>MaxArraySize</b>
              The  maximum  job  array task index value will be one less than MaxArraySize to allow for an index
              value of zero.  Configure MaxArraySize to 0 in order to disable job array use.  The value may  not
              exceed  4000001.   The  value of <b>MaxJobCount</b> should be much larger than <b>MaxArraySize</b>.  The default
              value is 1001.  See also <b>max_array_tasks</b> in SchedulerParameters.

       <b>MaxDBDMsgs</b>
              When communication to the SlurmDBD is not possible the slurmctld  will  queue  messages  meant  to
              processed  when  the  SlurmDBD  is  available  again.  In order to avoid running out of memory the
              slurmctld will only queue so many messages. The default value is 10000, or <b>MaxJobCount</b> * 2 +  Node
              Count * 4, whichever is greater. The value can not be less than 10000.

       <b>MaxJobCount</b>
              The  maximum  number  of jobs slurmctld can have in memory at one time.  Combine with <b>MinJobAge</b> to
              ensure the slurmctld daemon does not exhaust its memory or other resources.  Once  this  limit  is
              reached,  requests  to  submit  additional jobs will fail. The default value is 10000 jobs.  <b>NOTE</b>:
              Each task of a job array counts as one job even though they will not occupy separate  job  records
              until  modified  or initiated.  Performance can suffer with more than a few hundred thousand jobs.
              Setting per MaxSubmitJobs per user is generally valuable to prevent a single user from filling the
              system with jobs.  This is accomplished using Slurm's  database  and  configuring  enforcement  of
              resource limits.

       <b>MaxJobId</b>
              The  maximum job id to be used for jobs submitted to Slurm without a specific requested value. Job
              ids are unsigned 32bit integers with the first  26  bits  reserved  for  local  job  ids  and  the
              remaining  6  bits  reserved  for  a  cluster id to identify a federated job's origin. The maximum
              allowed local job id is 67,108,863 (0x3FFFFFF). The  default  value  is  67,043,328  (0x03ff0000).
              <b>MaxJobId</b>  only  applies to the local job id and not the federated job id.  Job id values generated
              will be incremented by 1 for each subsequent job. Once <b>MaxJobId</b> is reached, the next job  will  be
              assigned  <b>FirstJobId</b>.  Federated jobs will always have a job ID of 67,108,865 or higher.  Also see
              <b>FirstJobId</b>.

       <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b>
              Maximum real memory size available per allocated CPU in megabytes.  Used to avoid over-subscribing
              memory and causing paging.  <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b> would generally be  used  if  individual  processors  are
              allocated  to  jobs  (<b>SelectType=select/cons_tres</b>).  The default value is 0 (unlimited).  Also see
              <b>DefMemPerCPU</b>,  <b>DefMemPerGPU</b>  and  <b>MaxMemPerNode</b>.   <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b>  and  <b>MaxMemPerNode</b>  are  mutually
              exclusive.

              <b>NOTE</b>:  If  a job specifies a memory per CPU limit that exceeds this system limit, that job's count
              of CPUs per task will try to automatically increase.  This may result in the job  failing  due  to
              CPU  count limits. This auto-adjustment feature is a best-effort one and optimal assignment is not
              guaranteed due to the possibility of having heterogeneous configurations  and  multi-partition/qos
              jobs.  If  this  is  a  concern  it  is  advised to use a job submit LUA plugin instead to enforce
              auto-adjustments to your specific needs.

       <b>MaxMemPerNode</b>
              Maximum real memory size available per allocated node in a job allocation in  megabytes.  Used  to
              avoid  over-subscribing memory and causing paging.  <b>MaxMemPerNode</b> would generally be used if whole
              nodes  are  allocated  to  jobs  (<b>SelectType=select/linear</b>)  and  resources  are   over-subscribed
              (<b>OverSubscribe=yes</b>  or  <b>OverSubscribe=force</b>).   The  default  value  is  0  (unlimited).  Also see
              <b>DefMemPerNode</b> and <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b>.  <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b> and <b>MaxMemPerNode</b> are mutually exclusive.

       <b>MaxNodeCount</b>
              Maximum count of nodes which may exist in the controller. By default MaxNodeCount will be  set  to
              the  number of nodes found in the slurm.conf. MaxNodeCount will be ignored if less than the number
              of nodes found in the slurm.conf. The total number of nodes  in  a  system  cannot  exceed  65536.
              Increase MaxNodeCount to accommodate dynamically created nodes with dynamic node registrations and
              nodes created with scontrol.

       <b>MaxStepCount</b>
              The  maximum  number  of  steps that any job can initiate. This parameter is intended to limit the
              effect of bad batch scripts.  The default value is 40000 steps.

       <b>MaxTasksPerNode</b>
              Maximum number of tasks Slurm will allow a job step  to  spawn  on  a  single  node.  The  default
              <b>MaxTasksPerNode</b> is 512.  May not exceed 65533.

       <b>MCSParameters</b>
              MCS = Multi-Category Security MCS Plugin Parameters.  The supported parameters are specific to the
              <b>MCSPlugin</b>.   Changes  to  this  value  take  effect when the Slurm daemons are reconfigured.  More
              information about MCS is available here &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/mcs.html&gt;.

       <b>MCSPlugin</b>
              MCS = Multi-Category Security : associate a security label to jobs and ensure that nodes can  only
              be shared among jobs using the same security label.  Unset by default. Acceptable values include:

              <b>mcs/account</b> only  users  with  the  same  account  can  share  the  nodes  (requires  enabling  of
                          accounting).

              <b>mcs/group</b>   only users with the same group can share the nodes.

              <b>mcs/user</b>    a node cannot be shared with other users.

              <b>mcs/label</b>   only jobs with the same arbitrary label string can share nodes.

       <b>MessageTimeout</b>
              Time permitted for a round-trip communication to complete in seconds. Default value is 10 seconds.
              For systems with shared nodes, the slurmd daemon could be paged out and necessitate higher values.

       <b>MinJobAge</b>
              The minimum age of a completed job before its record is cleared from the list  of  jobs  slurmctld
              keeps  in  memory.  Combine  with  <b>MaxJobCount</b> to ensure the slurmctld daemon does not exhaust its
              memory or other resources. The default value is 300 seconds.  A value of  zero  prevents  any  job
              record purging.  Jobs are not purged during a backfill cycle, so it can take longer than MinJobAge
              seconds  to  purge  a  job  if  using  the backfill scheduling plugin.  In order to eliminate some
              possible race conditions, the minimum non-zero value for <b>MinJobAge</b> recommended is 2.

       <b>MpiDefault</b>
              Identifies the default type of MPI to be used.  Unset by default, which allows Slurm to work  with
              versions  of  MPI  other than listed below.  Srun may override this configuration parameter in any
              case.  Currently supported versions include: <b>pmi2</b> and <b>pmix</b>.  More information  about  MPI  use  is
              available here &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/mpi_guide.html&gt;.

       <b>MpiParams</b>
              MPI-related parameters. Multiple parameters may be comma separated. Currently supported parameters
              include:

              <b>ports</b>=Identifies a range of communication ports used by native Cray's PMI.

              <b>disable_slurm_hydra_bootstrap</b>
                     Disable  environment  variable  injection  in  allocations  for  the  following  variables:
                     I_MPI_HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP,       I_MPI_HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP_EXEC_EXTRA_ARGS,        HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP,
                     HYDRA_LAUNCHER_EXTRA_ARGS.

                     Manually setting I_MPI_HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP or HYDRA_BOOTSTRAP to 'slurm' in the allocation will
                     skip this parameter and injection of extra args will be performed as usual.

       <b>OverTimeLimit</b>
              Number  of  minutes  by  which  a job can exceed its time limit before being canceled.  Normally a
              job's time limit is treated as a <u>hard</u> limit and the job will be killed upon reaching  that  limit.
              Configuring  <b>OverTimeLimit</b>  will  result  in the job's time limit being treated like a <u>soft</u> limit.
              Adding the <b>OverTimeLimit</b> value to the <u>soft</u> time limit provides a <u>hard</u> time limit, at  which  point
              the  job  is canceled.  This is particularly useful for backfill scheduling, which bases upon each
              job's soft time limit.  The default value is zero.  May not exceed  65533  minutes.   A  value  of
              "UNLIMITED" is also supported.

       <b>PluginDir</b>
              Identifies  the  places  in  which  to  look for Slurm plugins.  This is a colon-separated list of
              directories, like the PATH environment variable.   The  default  value  is  the  prefix  given  at
              configure time + "/lib/slurm".

       <b>PlugStackConfig</b>
              Location of the config file for Slurm stackable plugins that use the Stackable Plugin Architecture
              for  Node  job (K)control (SPANK).  This provides support for a highly configurable set of plugins
              to be called before and/or after execution of each task spawned as part  of  a  user's  job  step.
              Default  location  is  "plugstack.conf"  in  the same directory as the system slurm.conf. For more
              information on SPANK plugins, see the <b><a href="../man7/spank.7.html">spank</a></b>(7) manual.

       <b>PreemptMode</b>
              Mechanism used to preempt jobs or enable gang scheduling. When the <b>PreemptType</b> parameter is set to
              enable preemption, the <b>PreemptMode</b> selects the default mechanism used to preempt the eligible jobs
              for the cluster.
              <b>PreemptMode</b> may be specified  on  a  per  partition  basis  to  override  this  default  value  if
              <b>PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio</b>.  Alternatively,  it  can  be  specified  on a per QOS basis if
              <b>PreemptType=preempt/qos</b>. In either case, a valid default <b>PreemptMode</b> value must be  specified  for
              the cluster as a whole when preemption is enabled.
              The  <b>GANG</b>  option  is  used to enable gang scheduling independent of whether preemption is enabled
              (i.e. independent of the <b>PreemptType</b> setting). It can be specified in addition  to  a  <b>PreemptMode</b>
              setting with the two options comma separated (e.g. <b>PreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG</b>).
              See  &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/preempt.html&gt; and &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/gang_scheduling.html&gt;
              for more details.

              <b>NOTE</b>: For performance reasons, the backfill scheduler reserves whole nodes for jobs,  not  partial
              nodes.  If  during  backfill scheduling a job preempts one or more other jobs, the whole nodes for
              those preempted jobs are reserved for the preemptor job, even if the preemptor job requested fewer
              resources than that.  These reserved nodes aren't available to other  jobs  during  that  backfill
              cycle,  even  if the other jobs could fit on the nodes. Therefore, jobs may preempt more resources
              during a single backfill iteration than they requested.
              <b>NOTE</b>: For heterogeneous job to be considered for preemption all components must  be  eligible  for
              preemption.  When a heterogeneous job is to be preempted the first identified component of the job
              with the highest order PreemptMode (<b>SUSPEND</b> (highest), <b>REQUEUE</b>, <b>CANCEL</b> (lowest)) will be  used  to
              set  the  PreemptMode for all components. The <b>GraceTime</b> and user warning signal for each component
              of the heterogeneous job remain unique.  Heterogeneous jobs  are  excluded  from  GANG  scheduling
              operations.

              <b>OFF</b>         Is  the  default  value  and  disables job preemption and gang scheduling.  It is only
                          compatible with preemption being disabled at the global level.  A common use case  for
                          this parameter is to set it on a partition to disable preemption for that partition.

              <b>CANCEL</b>      The preempted job will be cancelled.

              <b>GANG</b>        Enables  gang  scheduling (time slicing) of jobs in the same partition, and allows the
                          resuming of suspended jobs. In order to use gang scheduling, the <b>GANG</b> option  must  be
                          specified at the cluster level.

                          <b>NOTE</b>:  Gang  scheduling  is performed independently for each partition, so if you only
                          want  time-slicing  by  <b>OverSubscribe</b>,  without  any  preemption,   then   configuring
                          partitions  with overlapping nodes is not recommended.  On the other hand, if you want
                          to use <b>PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio</b>  to  allow  jobs  from  higher  PriorityTier
                          partitions   to  Suspend  jobs  from  lower  PriorityTier  partitions  you  will  need
                          overlapping partitions, and <b>PreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG</b> to  use  the  Gang  scheduler  to
                          resume the suspended jobs(s). You must configure the partition's <u>OverSubscribe</u> setting
                          to  <u>FORCE</u>  for  all  partitions  in which time-slicing is to take place.  In any case,
                          time-slicing won't happen between jobs on different partitions.

                          <b>NOTE</b>: Heterogeneous jobs are excluded from GANG scheduling operations.

                          <b>NOTE</b>: In case of overlapping partitions. If the node  is  allocated  job  that  allows
                          sharing  of  resources (Oversubscribe=FORCE or Oversubscribe=YES and job was submitted
                          with <b>-s</b>/<b>--oversubscribe</b>) it can only be allocated by jobs from the same partition.

              <b>REQUEUE</b>     Preempts jobs by requeuing them (if possible) or  canceling  them.   For  jobs  to  be
                          requeued they must have the --requeue sbatch option set or the cluster wide JobRequeue
                          parameter in slurm.conf must be set to <b>1</b>.

              <b>SUSPEND</b>     The  preempted  jobs will be suspended, and later the Gang scheduler will resume them.
                          Therefore the <b>SUSPEND</b> preemption mode always needs the <b>GANG</b> option to be specified  at
                          the  cluster  level.  Also,  because  the  suspended jobs will still use memory on the
                          allocated nodes, Slurm needs to be able to  track  memory  resources  to  be  able  to
                          suspend jobs.
                          When  suspending  jobs,  Slurm  sends  the SIGTSTP signal, waits the time specified by
                          <b>PreemptParameters=suspend_grace_time</b> (default is 2 seconds), then  sends  the  SIGSTOP
                          signal. The SIGCONT signal is sent when resuming jobs.
                          If <b>PreemptType=preempt/qos</b> is configured and if the preempted job(s) and the preemptor
                          job  are on the same partition, then they will share resources with the Gang scheduler
                          (time-slicing). If not  (i.e.  if  the  preemptees  and  preemptor  are  on  different
                          partitions) then the preempted jobs will remain suspended until the preemptor ends.

                          <b>NOTE</b>:  Because gang scheduling is performed independently for each partition, if using
                          <b>PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio</b> then jobs in higher  PriorityTier  partitions  will
                          suspend  jobs  in lower PriorityTier partitions to run on the released resources. Only
                          when the preemptor job ends will the suspended  jobs  will  be  resumed  by  the  Gang
                          scheduler.
                          <b>NOTE</b>:  Suspended  jobs will not release GRES. Higher priority jobs will not be able to
                          preempt to gain access to GRES.

              <b>WITHIN</b>      For <b>PreemptType=preempt/qos</b>, allow jobs within the same qos to  preempt  one  another.
                          While this can be set globally here, it is recommend that this only be set directly on
                          a relevant subset of the system qos values instead.

       <b>PreemptParameters</b>
              Multiple options may be comma separated.

              <b>min_exempt_priority</b>=Threshold value for the job's global priority. Only those jobs with priority
                     lower than this value will be marked as preemptable.

              <b>reclaim_licenses</b>
                     If  set, jobs may be preempted to reclaim licenses. Otherwise jobs requesting busy licenses
                     will have to wait even if they have preemption priority.  The logic to support this  option
                     is only available in the select/cons_tres plugin.

              <b>reorder_count</b>=Specify how many attempts should be made in reordering preemptable jobs to
                     minimize  the  total  number  of jobs that will be preempted.  The default value is 1. High
                     values may adversely impact performance.  Changes to the order of jobs  on  these  attempts
                     can  be  enabled  with <b>strict_order</b>.  The logic to support this option is only available in
                     the select/cons_tres plugin.

              <b>send_user_signal</b>
                     Send the user signal (e.g. --signal=&lt;sig_num&gt;) at preemption time even if the  signal  time
                     hasn't  been reached. In the case of a gracetime preemption the user signal will be sent if
                     the user signal has been specified and not sent, otherwise a SIGTERM will be  sent  to  the
                     tasks.

              <b>strict_order</b>
                     When  reordering  preemptable  jobs, place the most recently tested job at the front of the
                     list since we are certain that it actually added resources needed  by  the  new  job.  This
                     ensures  that  with  enough  reorder  attempts, the minimum possible number of jobs will be
                     preempted.  See also <b>reorder_count</b>.  The logic to support this option is only available  in
                     the select/cons_tres plugin.

              <b>suspend_grace_time</b>
                     Specifies,  in  units of seconds, the preemption grace time when using <b>PreemptMode=SUSPEND</b>.
                     When a job is suspended, the SIGTSTP signal will  be  sent,  and  then  after  waiting  the
                     specified  suspend  grace  time,  the  SIGSTOP signal will be sent.  The default value is 2
                     seconds.
                     <b>NOTE</b>: This parameter is only used when <b>PreemptMode=SUSPEND</b> is configured or when suspending
                     jobs with scontrol suspend.  For  setting  the  preemption  grace  time  when  using  other
                     preemption modes, see <b>GraceTime</b>.

              <b>youngest_first</b>
                     If  set,  then  the  preemption  sorting algorithm will be changed to sort by the job start
                     times to favor preempting younger jobs  over  older.  (Requires  preempt/partition_prio  or
                     preempt/qos plugins.)

       <b>PreemptType</b>
              Specifies the plugin used to identify which jobs can be preempted in order to start a pending job.
              Unset by default.

              <b>preempt/partition_prio</b>
                     Job  preemption  is  based  upon  partition  <b>PriorityTier</b>.   Jobs  in  higher  <b>PriorityTier</b>
                     partitions may preempt jobs from lower <b>PriorityTier</b> partitions.   This  is  not  compatible
                     with <b>PreemptMode=OFF</b>.

              <b>preempt/qos</b>
                     Job  preemption rules are specified by Quality Of Service (QOS) specifications in the Slurm
                     database.  In the case of <b>PreemptMode=SUSPEND</b>, a preempting job has to be  submitted  to  a
                     partition  with  a  higher  PriorityTier  or  to the same partition. Submission to the same
                     partition is also supported, which results in  the  preemptor  QoS  to  gang  schedule  the
                     preemptee  QoS.   This  option  is not compatible with <b>PreemptMode=OFF</b>.  A configuration of
                     <b>PreemptMode=SUSPEND</b> is only supported by the <b>SelectType=select/cons_tres</b> plugin.   See  the
                     <b>sacctmgr</b> man page to configure the options for <b>preempt/qos</b>.

       <b>PreemptExemptTime</b>
              Global  option for minimum run time for all jobs before they can be considered for preemption. Any
              QOS PreemptExemptTime  takes  precedence  over  the  global  option.  This  is  only  honored  for
              <b>PreemptMode=REQUEUE</b> and <b>PreemptMode=CANCEL</b>.
              A  time  of  -1  disables  the option, equivalent to 0. Acceptable time formats include "minutes",
              "minutes:seconds",    "hours:minutes:seconds",     "days-hours",     "days-hours:minutes",     and
              "days-hours:minutes:seconds".

       <b>PrEpParameters</b>
              Parameters to be passed to the <b>PrEpPlugins</b>.

       <b>PrEpPlugins</b>
              A  resource  for  programmers  wishing to write their own plugins for the Prolog and Epilog (PrEp)
              scripts. The default, and currently the only implemented plugin is <u>prep/script</u>. Additional plugins
              can be specified in a comma-separated list. For more information please see the  PrEp  Plugin  API
              documentation page: &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/prep_plugins.html&gt;

       <b>PriorityCalcPeriod</b>
              The period of time in minutes in which the half-life decay will be re-calculated.  Applicable only
              if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.  The default value is 5 (minutes).

       <b>PriorityDecayHalfLife</b>
              This controls how long prior resource use is considered in determining how over- or under-serviced
              an  association  is  (user,  bank account and cluster) in determining job priority.  The record of
              usage  will  be  decayed  over  time,  with  half  of  the   original   value   cleared   at   age
              <b>PriorityDecayHalfLife</b>.   If  set  to  0  no decay will be applied.  This is helpful if you want to
              enforce hard time limits per association. If set to 0 <b>PriorityUsageResetPeriod</b> must be set to some
              interval.  Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.  The unit is a time string  (i.e.
              min, hr:min:00, days-hr:min:00, or days-hr). The default value is 7-0 (7 days).

       <b>PriorityFavorSmall</b>
              Specifies  that  small  jobs should be given preferential scheduling priority.  Applicable only if
              PriorityType=priority/multifactor.  Supported values are "YES" and  "NO".  The  default  value  is
              "NO".

       <b>PriorityFlags</b>
              Flags  to  modify  priority  behavior.  Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.  The
              keywords         below          have          no          associated          value          (e.g.
              "PriorityFlags=ACCRUE_ALWAYS,SMALL_RELATIVE_TO_TIME").

              <b>ACCRUE_ALWAYS</b>    If  set,  priority  age factor will be increased despite job ineligibility due to
                               either dependencies, holds or  begin  time  in  the  future.  Accrue  limits  are
                               ignored.

              <b>CALCULATE_RUNNING</b>
                               If  set,  priorities  will  be  recalculated  not only for pending jobs, but also
                               running and suspended jobs.

              <b>DEPTH_OBLIVIOUS</b>  If set, priority will be calculated  based  similar  to  the  normal  multifactor
                               calculation,  but depth of the associations in the tree does not adversely affect
                               their priority. This option automatically enables NO_FAIR_TREE.

              <b>NO_FAIR_TREE</b>     Disables the "fair tree" algorithm, and reverts to "classic" fair share  priority
                               scheduling.

              <b>INCR_ONLY</b>        If  set,  priority  values  will  only increase in value. Job priority will never
                               decrease in value.

              <b>MAX_TRES</b>         If set, the weighted TRES value (e.g. TRESBillingWeights) is  calculated  as  the
                               MAX  of  individual  TRESs  on  a node (e.g. cpus, mem, gres) plus the sum of all
                               global TRESs (e.g. licenses).

              <b>NO_NORMAL_ALL</b>    If set, all NO_NORMAL_* flags are set.

              <b>NO_NORMAL_ASSOC</b>  If set, the association factor is not normalized against the highest  association
                               priority.

              <b>NO_NORMAL_PART</b>   If  set,  the  partition  factor  is not normalized against the highest partition
                               <b>PriorityJobFactor</b>.

              <b>NO_NORMAL_QOS</b>    If set, the QOS factor is not normalized against the highest qos priority.

              <b>NO_NORMAL_TRES</b>   If set, the TRES factor is  not  normalized  against  the  job's  partition  TRES
                               counts.

              <b>SMALL_RELATIVE_TO_TIME</b>
                               If  set,  the job's size component will be based upon not the job size alone, but
                               the job's size divided by its time limit.

       <b>PriorityMaxAge</b>
              Specifies the job age which will be given the  maximum  age  factor  in  computing  priority.  For
              example,  a  value  of  30 minutes would result in all jobs over 30 minutes old would get the same
              age-based priority.  Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.  The  unit  is  a  time
              string (i.e. min, hr:min:00, days-hr:min:00, or days-hr). The default value is 7-0 (7 days).

       <b>PriorityParameters</b>
              Arbitrary string used by the PriorityType plugin.

       <b>PrioritySiteFactorParameters</b>
              Arbitrary string used by the PrioritySiteFactorPlugin plugin.

       <b>PrioritySiteFactorPlugin</b>
              The  specifies  an  optional plugin to be used alongside "priority/multifactor", which is meant to
              initially set and continuously update the SiteFactor priority factor. Unset by default.

       <b>PriorityType</b>
              This specifies the plugin to be used in  establishing  a  job's  scheduling  priority.   Also  see
              <b>PriorityFlags</b> for configuration options.  The default value is "priority/multifactor".

              <b>priority/basic</b>
                     Jobs are evaluated in a First In, First Out (FIFO) manner.

              <b>priority/multifactor</b>
                     Jobs  are  assigned  a  priority  based  upon  a variety of factors that include size, age,
                     Fairshare, etc.

              When not FIFO scheduling, jobs are prioritized in the following order:

              1. Jobs that can preempt
              2. Jobs with an advanced reservation
              3. Partition PriorityTier
              4. Job priority
              5. Job submit time
              6. Job ID

       <b>PriorityUsageResetPeriod</b>
              At this interval the usage of associations will be reset to 0. This is used if you want to enforce
              hard limits of time usage per association. If PriorityDecayHalfLife is set to be 0 no  decay  will
              happen and this is the only way to reset the usage accumulated by running jobs. By default this is
              turned  off and it is advised to use the PriorityDecayHalfLife option to avoid not having anything
              running on your cluster, but if your schema is set up to only allow certain  amounts  of  time  on
              your system this is the way to do it.  Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.

              <b>NONE</b>        Never clear historic usage. The default value.

              <b>NOW</b>         Clear the historic usage now.  Executed at startup and reconfiguration time.

              <b>DAILY</b>       Cleared every day at midnight.

              <b>WEEKLY</b>      Cleared every week on Sunday at time 00:00.

              <b>MONTHLY</b>     Cleared on the first day of each month at time 00:00.

              <b>QUARTERLY</b>   Cleared on the first day of each quarter at time 00:00.

              <b>YEARLY</b>      Cleared on the first day of each year at time 00:00.

       <b>PriorityWeightAge</b>
              An  integer  value  that sets the degree to which the queue wait time component contributes to the
              job's    priority.     Applicable    only    if    PriorityType=priority/multifactor.     Requires
              AccountingStorageType=accounting_storage/slurmdbd.  The default value is 0.

       <b>PriorityWeightAssoc</b>
              An  integer value that sets the degree to which the association component contributes to the job's
              priority.  Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.  The default value is 0.

       <b>PriorityWeightFairshare</b>
              An integer value that sets the degree to which the fair-share component contributes to  the  job's
              priority.       Applicable      only      if      PriorityType=priority/multifactor.      Requires
              AccountingStorageType=accounting_storage/slurmdbd.  The default value is 0.

       <b>PriorityWeightJobSize</b>
              An integer value that sets the degree to which the job size component  contributes  to  the  job's
              priority.  Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.  The default value is 0.

       <b>PriorityWeightPartition</b>
              Partition factor used by priority/multifactor plugin in calculating job priority.  Applicable only
              if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.  The default value is 0.

       <b>PriorityWeightQOS</b>
              An integer value that sets the degree to which the Quality Of Service component contributes to the
              job's priority.  Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.  The default value is 0.

       <b>PriorityWeightTRES</b>
              A  comma-separated  list  of  TRES  Types  and  weights  that  sets the degree that each TRES Type
              contributes to the job's priority.

              e.g.
              PriorityWeightTRES=CPU=1000,Mem=2000,GRES/gpu=3000

              Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor and if  AccountingStorageTRES  is  configured
              with each TRES Type.  Negative values are allowed.  The default values are 0.

       <b>PrivateData</b>
              This  controls what type of information is hidden from regular users.  By default, all information
              is visible to all users.  User <b>SlurmUser</b> and <b>root</b>  can  always  view  all  information.   Multiple
              values may be specified with a comma separator.  Acceptable values include:

              <b>accounts</b>
                     (NON-SlurmDBD  ACCOUNTING  ONLY) Prevents users from viewing any account definitions unless
                     they are coordinators of them.

              <b>events</b> prevents users from viewing event information unless they have operator status or above.

              <b>jobs</b>   Prevents users from viewing jobs or job  steps  belonging  to  other  users.  (NON-SlurmDBD
                     ACCOUNTING  ONLY)  Prevents  users from viewing job records belonging to other users unless
                     they are coordinators of the association running the job when using sacct.

              <b>nodes</b>  Prevents users from viewing node state information.

              <b>partitions</b>
                     Prevents users from viewing partition state information.

              <b>reservations</b>
                     Prevents regular users from viewing reservations which they can not use.

              <b>usage</b>  Prevents users from viewing usage of any other user, this applies to sshare.  (NON-SlurmDBD
                     ACCOUNTING ONLY) Prevents users from viewing usage of  any  other  user,  this  applies  to
                     sreport.

              <b>users</b>  (NON-SlurmDBD  ACCOUNTING  ONLY)  Prevents users from viewing information of any user other
                     than themselves, this also makes it so users can only  see  associations  they  deal  with.
                     Coordinators  can see associations of all users in the account they are coordinator of, but
                     can only see themselves when listing users.

       <b>ProctrackType</b>
              Identifies the plugin to be used for process tracking on a job step basis.  The slurmd daemon uses
              this mechanism to identify all processes which are children of processes it spawns for a user  job
              step.   <b>NOTE</b>:  "proctrack/linuxproc"  and  "proctrack/pgid"  can  fail  to  identify all processes
              associated with a job since processes can become a child of the  init  process  (when  the  parent
              process   terminates)   or   change  their  process  group.   To  reliably  track  all  processes,
              "proctrack/cgroup" is highly recommended.  <b>NOTE</b>: The <b>JobContainerType</b> applies to a  job  namespace
              isolation,  while <b>ProctrackType</b> applies to job resource limits and tracking.  Acceptable values at
              present include:

              <b>proctrack/cgroup</b>
                     Uses linux cgroups to constrain and track processes, and is the default  for  systems  with
                     cgroup support.
                     <b>NOTE</b>: See "man cgroup.conf" for configuration details.

              <b>proctrack/linuxproc</b>
                     Uses linux process tree using parent process IDs.

              <b>proctrack/pgid</b>
                     Uses Process Group IDs.
                     <b>NOTE</b>: This is the default for the BSD family.

       <b>Prolog</b> Pathname  of a program for the slurmd to execute whenever it is asked to run a job step from a new
              job allocation. If it is not an absolute path name (i.e. it does not start with a slash), it  will
              be  searched  for  in the same directory as the slurm.conf file. A glob pattern (See <b>glob</b> (7)) may
              also be used to specify more than one program to run  (e.g.  "/etc/slurm/prolog.d/*").  When  more
              than  one prolog script is configured, they are executed in reverse alphabetical order (z-a -&gt; Z-A
              -&gt; 9-0). The slurmd executes the prolog before starting the first job step. The prolog  script  or
              scripts  may  be  used  to purge files, enable user login, etc. By default there is no prolog. Any
              configured script is expected to complete execution quickly (in less  time  than  <b>MessageTimeout</b>).
              If  the  prolog  fails (returns a non-zero exit code), this will result in the node being set to a
              DRAIN state and the job  being  requeued.  The  job  will  be  placed  in  a  held  state,  unless
              <b>nohold_on_prolog_fail</b>  is  configured  in  <b>SchedulerParameters</b>.  See <b>Prolog</b> <b>and</b> <b>Epilog</b> <b>Scripts</b> for
              more information.

              <b>NOTE</b>: It is possible to configure multiple prolog scripts by including  this  option  on  multiple
              lines.

       <b>PrologEpilogTimeout</b>
              The  interval  in  seconds  Slurm waits for Prolog and Epilog before terminating them. The default
              behavior is to wait indefinitely. This interval applies to the Prolog and  Epilog  run  by  slurmd
              daemon  before and after the job, the PrologSlurmctld and EpilogSlurmctld run by slurmctld daemon,
              and the SPANK plugin prolog/epilog calls: slurm_spank_job_prolog and slurm_spank_job_epilog.
              If  the  PrologSlurmctld  times  out,  the  job  is  requeued  if  possible.   If  the  Prolog  or
              slurm_spank_job_prolog  time out, the job is requeued if possible and the node is drained.  If the
              Epilog or slurm_spank_job_epilog time out, the node is drained.  In all cases, errors are logged.

       <b>PrologFlags</b>
              Flags to control the Prolog behavior. By  default  no  flags  are  set.   Multiple  flags  may  be
              specified in a comma-separated list.  Currently supported options are:

              <b>Alloc</b>   If  set,  the  Prolog  script  will  be  executed at job allocation. By default, Prolog is
                      executed just before the task is launched. Therefore, when salloc is started, no Prolog is
                      executed. Alloc is useful for preparing things before a user starts to use  any  allocated
                      resources.  In particular, this flag is needed on a Cray system when cluster compatibility
                      mode is enabled.

                      <b>NOTE</b>: Use of the Alloc flag will increase the time required to start jobs.

              <b>Contain</b> At  job  allocation  time,  use  the  ProcTrack  plugin  to  create a job container on all
                      allocated compute nodes.  This container may be used for user processes not launched under
                      Slurm control, for example pam_slurm_adopt may place processes launched through  a  direct
                      user  login  into this container. If using pam_slurm_adopt, then ProcTrackType must be set
                      to <b>proctrack/cgroup</b>.  Setting the Contain implicitly sets the Alloc flag.

              <b>DeferBatch</b>
                      If set, slurmctld will wait until the prolog  completes  on  all  allocated  nodes  before
                      sending  the batch job launch request. With just the Alloc flag, slurmctld will launch the
                      batch step as soon as the first node in the job allocation completes the prolog.

              <b>NoHold</b>  If set, the Alloc flag should also be set. This will allow for salloc to not  block  until
                      the  prolog is finished on each node. The blocking will happen when steps reach the slurmd
                      and before any execution has happened in the step.  This is a much faster way to work  and
                      if  using srun to launch your tasks you should use this flag. This flag cannot be combined
                      with the Contain or X11 flags.

              <b>ForceRequeueOnFail</b>
                      When a batch job fails to launch due to a Prolog failure, always requeue it  automatically
                      even if the job requested no requeues.

                      <b>NOTE</b>: Setting this flag implicitly sets the Alloc flag.

              <b>RunInJob</b>
                      Make the Prolog/Epilog run in the extern slurmstepd. This will contain it in one of on the
                      job's  processes.  This will contain it in the cgroup if configured.  Setting the RunInJob
                      flag implicitly sets the Contain and Alloc flag.

              <b>Serial</b>  By default, the Prolog and Epilog scripts run concurrently on each node.  This flag forces
                      those scripts to run serially within each node, but with  a  significant  penalty  to  job
                      throughput on each node.

                      <b>NOTE</b>: This is incompatible with RunInJob.

              <b>X11</b>     Enable   Slurm's   built-in  X11  forwarding  capabilities.   This  is  incompatible  with
                      <b>ProctrackType=proctrack/linuxproc</b>.  Setting the X11 flag implicitly enables  both  Contain
                      and Alloc flags as well.

       <b>PrologSlurmctld</b>
              Fully  qualified  pathname  of a program for the slurmctld daemon to execute before granting a new
              job allocation (e.g.  "/usr/local/slurm/prolog_controller").  The program executes as SlurmUser on
              the same node where the slurmctld daemon executes, giving it permission to drain nodes and requeue
              the job if a failure occurs or cancel the job if appropriate.  Exactly what the program  does  and
              how it accomplishes this is completely at the discretion of the system administrator.  Information
              about  the  job  being  initiated,  its  allocated  nodes,  etc.  are  passed to the program using
              environment variables.  While this program is running, the nodes associated with the job  will  be
              have  a  POWER_UP/CONFIGURING flag set in their state, which can be readily viewed.  The slurmctld
              daemon will wait indefinitely for this program to complete.  Once the program  completes  with  an
              exit code of zero, the nodes will be considered ready for use and the program will be started.  If
              some  node  can  not be made available for use, the program should drain the node (typically using
              the scontrol command) and terminate with a non-zero exit code.  A non-zero exit code  will  result
              in  the  job being requeued (where possible) or killed. Note that only batch jobs can be requeued.
              See <b>Prolog</b> <b>and</b> <b>Epilog</b> <b>Scripts</b> for more information.

              <b>NOTE</b>: It is possible to configure multiple prolog scripts by including  this  option  on  multiple
              lines.

       <b>PropagatePrioProcess</b>
              Controls the scheduling priority (nice value) of user spawned tasks.

              <b>0</b>    The  tasks  will  inherit the scheduling priority from the slurm daemon.  This is the default
                   value.

              <b>1</b>    The tasks will inherit the scheduling priority of the command used to submit them (e.g.  <b>srun</b>
                   or  <b>sbatch</b>).   Unless  the  job  is  submitted by user root, the tasks will have a scheduling
                   priority no higher than the slurm daemon spawning them.

              <b>2</b>    The tasks will inherit the scheduling priority of the command used to submit them (e.g.  <b>srun</b>
                   or  <b>sbatch</b>)  with  the  restriction  that their nice value will always be one higher than the
                   slurm daemon (i.e.  the tasks scheduling priority will be lower than the slurm daemon).

       <b>PropagateResourceLimits</b>
              A comma-separated list of resource limit names.  The slurmd daemon uses these names to obtain  the
              associated  (soft)  limit  values  from  the user's process environment on the submit node.  These
              limits are then propagated and applied to the jobs that will  run  on  the  compute  nodes.   This
              parameter  can  be  useful  when  system limits vary among nodes.  Any resource limits that do not
              appear in the list are not propagated.  However, the user can override this  by  specifying  which
              resource   limits  to  propagate  with  the  sbatch  or  srun  "--propagate"  option.  If  neither
              <b>PropagateResourceLimits</b> or <b>PropagateResourceLimitsExcept</b>  are  configured  and  the  "--propagate"
              option  is  not  specified,  then  the  default action is to propagate all limits. Only one of the
              parameters, either PropagateResourceLimits or  PropagateResourceLimitsExcept,  may  be  specified.
              The  user  limits  can  not exceed hard limits under which the slurmd daemon operates. If the user
              limits are not propagated, the limits from the slurmd daemon will be propagated to the user's job.
              The limits used for the Slurm daemons  can  be  set  in  the  /etc/sysconf/slurm  file.  For  more
              information,   see:  https://slurm.schedmd.com/faq.html#memlock  The  following  limit  names  are
              supported by Slurm (although some options may not be supported on some systems):

              <b>ALL</b>       All limits listed below (default)

              <b>NONE</b>      No limits listed below

              <b>AS</b>        The maximum address space (virtual memory) for a process.

              <b>CORE</b>      The maximum size of core file

              <b>CPU</b>       The maximum amount of CPU time

              <b>DATA</b>      The maximum size of a process's data segment

              <b>FSIZE</b>     The maximum size of files created. Note that if the user sets FSIZE  to  less  than  the
                        current size of the slurmd.log, job launches will fail with a 'File size limit exceeded'
                        error.

              <b>MEMLOCK</b>   The maximum size that may be locked into memory

              <b>NOFILE</b>    The maximum number of open files

              <b>NPROC</b>     The maximum number of processes available

              <b>RSS</b>       The  maximum resident set size. Note that this only has effect with Linux kernels 2.4.30
                        or older or BSD.

              <b>STACK</b>     The maximum stack size

       <b>PropagateResourceLimitsExcept</b>
              A comma-separated list of  resource  limit  names.   By  default,  all  resource  limits  will  be
              propagated,  (as  described  by  the  <b>PropagateResourceLimits</b>  parameter),  except  for the limits
              appearing in this list. The user  can  override  this  by  specifying  which  resource  limits  to
              propagate  with  the sbatch or srun "--propagate" option.  See <b>PropagateResourceLimits</b> above for a
              list of valid limit names.

       <b>RebootProgram</b>
              Program to be executed on each compute node to reboot it. Invoked on each  node  once  it  becomes
              idle  after  the command "scontrol reboot" is executed by an authorized user or a job is submitted
              with the  "--reboot"  option.   After  rebooting,  the  node  is  returned  to  normal  use.   See
              <b>ResumeTimeout</b>  to configure the time you expect a reboot to finish in.  A node will be marked DOWN
              if it doesn't reboot within <b>ResumeTimeout</b>.

       <b>ReconfigFlags</b>
              Flags to control various actions that may be taken when an "scontrol reconfig" command is  issued.
              Currently the options are:

              <b>KeepPartInfo</b>     If  set,  an  "scontrol  reconfig"  command  will maintain the in-memory value of
                               partition "state" and other parameters that may have been dynamically updated  by
                               "scontrol  update".  Partition  information in the slurm.conf file will be merged
                               with in-memory data. This flag supersedes the KeepPartState flag.

              <b>KeepPartState</b>    If set, an "scontrol reconfig" command will preserve  only  the  current  "state"
                               value  of  in-memory  partitions  and  will  reset  all  other  parameters of the
                               partitions that may have been dynamically updated by  "scontrol  update"  to  the
                               values  from  the  slurm.conf  file. Partition information in the slurm.conf file
                               will be merged with in-memory data.

              <b>KeepPowerSaveSettings</b>
                               If set, an "scontrol  reconfig"  command  will  preserve  the  current  state  of
                               SuspendExcNodes, SuspendExcParts and SuspendExcStates.

              The default for the above flags is not set, and the "scontrol reconfig" will rebuild the partition
              information using only the definitions in the slurm.conf file.

       <b>RequeueExit</b>
              Enables  automatic requeue for batch jobs which exit with the specified values.  Separate multiple
              exit  code  by  a  comma  and/or  specify   numeric   ranges   using   a   "-"   separator   (e.g.
              "RequeueExit=1-9,18")  Jobs  will  be  put  back  in  to  pending state and later scheduled again.
              Restarted jobs will have the environment variable <b>SLURM_RESTART_COUNT</b> set to the number  of  times
              the job has been restarted.

       <b>RequeueExitHold</b>
              Enables  automatic  requeue  for  batch jobs which exit with the specified values, with these jobs
              being held until released manually by the user.  Separate multiple exit code  by  a  comma  and/or
              specify  numeric ranges using a "-" separator (e.g. "RequeueExitHold=10-12,16") These jobs are put
              in  the  <b>JOB_SPECIAL_EXIT</b>  exit  state.   Restarted  jobs  will  have  the  environment   variable
              <b>SLURM_RESTART_COUNT</b> set to the number of times the job has been restarted.

       <b>ResumeFailProgram</b>
              The  program  that will be executed when nodes fail to resume to by <b>ResumeTimeout</b>. The argument to
              the program will be the names of the failed nodes  (using  Slurm's  hostlist  expression  format).
              Programs  will  be  killed  if  they  run longer than the largest configured, global or partition,
              <b>ResumeTimeout</b> or <b>SuspendTimeout</b>.

       <b>ResumeProgram</b>
              Slurm supports a mechanism to reduce power consumption on nodes that remain idle for  an  extended
              period  of time.  This is typically accomplished by reducing voltage and frequency or powering the
              node down.  <b>ResumeProgram</b> is the program that will be executed when a node in power save  mode  is
              assigned  work  to  perform.  For reasons of reliability, <b>ResumeProgram</b> may execute more than once
              for a node when the <b>slurmctld</b> daemon crashes and is restarted.   If  <b>ResumeProgram</b>  is  unable  to
              restore a node to service with a responding slurmd and an updated BootTime, it should set the node
              state  to  DOWN,  which  will  result in a requeue of any job associated with the node - this will
              happen automatically if the node  doesn't  register  within  ResumeTimeout.   If  the  node  isn't
              actually rebooted (i.e. when multiple-slurmd is configured) starting slurmd with "-b" option might
              be  useful.   The program executes as <b>SlurmUser</b>.  The argument to the program will be the names of
              nodes to be removed from power savings mode (using Slurm's hostlist expression format). A  job  to
              node  mapping  is  available  in  JSON  format  by  reading  the  temporary  file specified by the
              <b>SLURM_RESUME_FILE</b> environment variable.  This  file  is  closed  once  slurmctld  shuts  down.  If
              ResumeProgram is running, slurmctld shutdown is delayed by up to ten seconds to give ResumeProgram
              time to read this file. Therefore, this file should be read at the beginning of ResumeProgram.  By
              default  no  program  is  run.   Programs  will  be  killed  if  they  run longer than the largest
              configured, global or partition, <b>ResumeTimeout</b> or <b>SuspendTimeout</b>.

       <b>ResumeRate</b>
              The rate at which nodes in power save mode are returned to normal operation by <b>ResumeProgram</b>.  The
              value is a number of nodes per minute and it can be used to prevent power surges if a large number
              of nodes in power save mode are assigned work at the same time (e.g. a large job starts).  A value
              of zero results in no limits being imposed.  The default value is 300 nodes per minute.

       <b>ResumeTimeout</b>
              Maximum time permitted (in seconds) between when a node resume request is issued and when the node
              is actually available for use.  Nodes which fail to respond in this time frame will be marked DOWN
              and the jobs scheduled on the node requeued.  Nodes which reboot after this  time  frame  will  be
              marked DOWN with a reason of "Node unexpectedly rebooted."  The default value is 60 seconds.

       <b>ResvEpilog</b>
              Fully  qualified  pathname  of  a program for the slurmctld to execute when a reservation ends. It
              does not run when a running reservation is deleted. The program can be used to cancel jobs, modify
              partition configuration, etc.  The reservation named will be passed as an argument to the program.
              By default there is no epilog.

       <b>ResvOverRun</b>
              Describes how long a job already running in a reservation should be permitted to execute after the
              end time of the reservation has been reached.  The time period is specified  in  minutes  and  the
              default value is 0 (kill the job immediately).  The value may not exceed 65533 minutes, although a
              value  of  "UNLIMITED"  is  supported to permit a job to run indefinitely after its reservation is
              terminated.

       <b>ResvProlog</b>
              Fully qualified pathname of a program for the slurmctld to execute when a reservation begins.  The
              program  can  be  used to cancel jobs, modify partition configuration, etc.  The reservation named
              will be passed as an argument to the program.  By default there is no prolog.

       <b>ReturnToService</b>
              Controls when a DOWN node will be returned to service.  The default value is 0.  Supported  values
              include

              <b>0</b>   A node will remain in the DOWN state until a system administrator explicitly changes its state
                  (even if the slurmd daemon registers and resumes communications).

              <b>1</b>   A DOWN node will become available for use upon registration with a valid configuration only if
                  it  was  set  DOWN due to being non-responsive.  If the node was set DOWN for any other reason
                  (low memory, unexpected reboot, etc.), its state will not automatically be  changed.   A  node
                  registers  with  a  valid  configuration  if its memory, GRES, CPU count, etc. are equal to or
                  greater than the values configured in slurm.conf.

              <b>2</b>   A DOWN node will become available for use upon registration with a  valid  configuration.  The
                  node  could have been set DOWN for any reason.  A node registers with a valid configuration if
                  its memory, GRES, CPU count, etc. are equal to  or  greater  than  the  values  configured  in
                  slurm.conf.

       <b>SchedulerParameters</b>
              The  interpretation  of  this  parameter  varies  by <b>SchedulerType</b>.  Multiple options may be comma
              separated.

              <b>allow_zero_lic</b>
                     If set, then job submissions requesting more than configured licenses won't be rejected.

              <b>assoc_limit_stop</b>
                     If set and a job cannot start due to association limits, then do not  attempt  to  initiate
                     any  lower priority jobs in that partition. Setting this can decrease system throughput and
                     utilization, but avoid potentially starving larger jobs by preventing them  from  launching
                     indefinitely.

              <b>batch_sched_delay</b>=How long, in seconds, the scheduling of batch jobs can be delayed.
                     This  can be useful in a high-throughput environment in which batch jobs are submitted at a
                     very high rate (i.e. using the sbatch command) and one wishes to  reduce  the  overhead  of
                     attempting to schedule each job at submit time.  The default value is 3 seconds.

              <b>bb_array_stage_cnt</b>=Number of tasks from a job array that should be available for burst buffer
                     resource  allocation. Higher values will increase the system overhead as each task from the
                     job array will be moved to its own job record in memory, so  relatively  small  values  are
                     generally recommended.  The default value is 10.

              <b>bf_allow_magnetic_slot</b>
                     By default the backfill scheduler will not add a slot in the bf plan when a job attempts to
                     use  a  magnetic  reservation. This option reverses this to make the backfill scheduler add
                     slots in the bf plan when jobs are eligible to run in a  magnetic  reservation.  With  this
                     option  enabled,  jobs  inside  magnetic  reservations  will respect priorities and also be
                     counted against  the  backfill  limits  such  as  <b>bf_max_job_test</b>.   <b>NOTE</b>:  Backfill  first
                     evaluates  jobs  inside  reservations,  which means all magnetic jobs will be tested first.
                     When enabling this option, make sure to  revise  (increasing  if  necessary)  the  backfill
                     limits  configured  to validate backfill cycle gets to test the expected jobs in the queue.
                     <b>NOTE</b>: If <b>bf_one_resv_per_job</b> is used along with this option the magnetic  reservation  slot
                     will  now be the only slot in the bf plan. Otherwise the slot will be the first one outside
                     the magnetic reservation.

              <b>bf_busy_nodes</b>
                     When selecting resources for pending jobs to reserve for future execution (i.e. the job can
                     not be started immediately), then preferentially select nodes that are in use.   This  will
                     tend  to  leave currently idle resources available for backfilling longer running jobs, but
                     may result in allocations having less  than  optimal  network  topology.   This  option  is
                     currently only supported by the select/cons_tres plugin.

              <b>bf_continue</b>
                     The  backfill  scheduler periodically releases locks in order to permit other operations to
                     proceed rather than blocking all activity for what could be an  extended  period  of  time.
                     Setting  this  option will cause the backfill scheduler to continue processing pending jobs
                     from its original job list after releasing locks even if job or node state changes.

              <b>bf_hetjob_immediate</b>
                     Instruct the backfill scheduler to attempt to start a heterogeneous job as soon as  all  of
                     its  components  are determined able to do so. Otherwise, the backfill scheduler will delay
                     heterogeneous jobs initiation  attempts  until  after  the  rest  of  the  queue  has  been
                     processed.  This  delay  may result in lower priority jobs being allocated resources, which
                     could delay the initiation of the heterogeneous job due to account and/or QOS limits  being
                     reached.  This option is disabled by default. If enabled and <b>bf_hetjob_prio=min</b> is not set,
                     then it would be automatically set.

              <b>bf_hetjob_prio=[min|avg|max]</b>
                     At the beginning of each backfill scheduling cycle, a list of pending to be scheduled  jobs
                     is  sorted  according  to  the  precedence  order  configured  in <b>PriorityType</b>. This option
                     instructs the scheduler to alter the  sorting  algorithm  to  ensure  that  all  components
                     belonging  to  the  same  heterogeneous job will be attempted to be scheduled consecutively
                     (thus not fragmented in the resulting list). More specifically,  all  components  from  the
                     same  heterogeneous  job  will  be  treated as if they all have the same priority (minimum,
                     average or maximum depending upon this option's parameter) when compared  with  other  jobs
                     (or  other  heterogeneous  job components). The original order will be preserved within the
                     same heterogeneous job. Note that the operation is calculated for  the  <b>PriorityTier</b>  layer
                     and  for  the  <b>Priority</b>  resulting  from the priority/multifactor plugin calculations. When
                     enabled, if any heterogeneous job requested an advanced reservation, then all of that job's
                     components will be treated as if they  had  requested  an  advanced  reservation  (and  get
                     preferential treatment in scheduling).

                     Note  that  this  operation  does  not  update the <b>Priority</b> values of the heterogeneous job
                     components, only their order within the list, so the output of the sprio command  will  not
                     be affected.

                     Heterogeneous  jobs  have  special  scheduling  properties:  they are only scheduled by the
                     backfill scheduling  plugin,  each  of  their  components  is  considered  separately  when
                     reserving  resources  (and might have different <b>PriorityTier</b> or different <b>Priority</b> values),
                     and no heterogeneous job component  is  actually  allocated  resources  until  all  if  its
                     components  can  be  initiated.   This  may  imply  potential scheduling deadlock scenarios
                     because components from different heterogeneous jobs can start reserving  resources  in  an
                     interleaved fashion (not consecutively), but none of the jobs can reserve resources for all
                     components  and  start. Enabling this option can help to mitigate this problem. By default,
                     this option is disabled.

              <b>bf_interval</b>=The number of seconds between backfill iterations.
                     Higher values result in less overhead and better responsiveness.  This option applies  only
                     to  <b>SchedulerType=sched/backfill</b>.   Default:  30, Min: 1, Max: 10800 (3h).  A setting of -1
                     will disable the backfill scheduling loop.

              <b>bf_job_part_count_reserve</b>=The backfill scheduling logic will reserve resources for the specified
              count
                     of highest priority jobs in each partition.  For example, bf_job_part_count_reserve=10 will
                     cause the backfill scheduler to reserve resources for the ten highest priority jobs in each
                     partition.  Any lower priority job that can be started using currently available  resources
                     and  not  adversely  impact  the  expected start time of these higher priority jobs will be
                     started by the backfill scheduler The default value is zero, which will  reserve  resources
                     for   any   pending   job   and   delay  initiation  of  lower  priority  jobs.   Also  see
                     bf_min_age_reserve and bf_min_prio_reserve.  Default: 0, Min: 0, Max: 100000.

              <b>bf_licenses</b>
                     Require the backfill scheduling logic to  track  and  plan  for  license  availability.  By
                     default, any job blocked on license availability will not have resources reserved which can
                     lead to job starvation.  This option implicitly enables <b>bf_running_job_reserve</b>.

              <b>bf_max_job_array_resv</b>=The maximum number of tasks from a job array for which the backfill
              scheduler
                     will  reserve  resources  in the future.  Since job arrays can potentially have millions of
                     tasks, the overhead in reserving resources for all tasks can be prohibitive.   In  addition
                     various  limits  may prevent all the jobs from starting at the expected times.  This has no
                     impact upon the number of tasks from a job array that  can  be  started  immediately,  only
                     those  tasks expected to start at some future time.  Default: 20, Min: 0, Max: 1000.  <b>NOTE</b>:
                     Jobs submitted to multiple partitions appear in  the  job  queue  once  per  partition.  If
                     different  copies  of  a  single  job  array record aren't consecutive in the job queue and
                     another job array record is in between, then bf_max_job_array_resv tasks are considered per
                     partition that the job is submitted to.

              <b>bf_max_job_assoc</b>=The maximum number of jobs per user association to attempt starting with the
                     backfill scheduler.  This setting is similar to <b>bf_max_job_user</b> but is handy if a user  has
                     multiple  associations  equating  to  basically different users.  One can set this limit to
                     prevent users from flooding the backfill queue with jobs that cannot start and that prevent
                     jobs from other users to start.  This option applies only to  <b>SchedulerType=sched/backfill</b>.
                     Also  see the <b>bf_max_job_user</b> <b>bf_max_job_part</b>, <b>bf_max_job_test</b> and <b>bf_max_job_user_part</b>=Set

              <b>bf_max_job_part</b>=The maximum number of jobs per partition to attempt starting with the backfill
                     scheduler.  This can be especially helpful for systems with large numbers of partitions and
                     jobs.   This  option  applies  only  to   <b>SchedulerType=sched/backfill</b>.    Also   see   the
                     <b>partition_job_depth</b>  and  <b>bf_max_job_test</b>  options.   Set  <b>bf_max_job_test</b>  to a value much

              <b>bf_max_job_start</b>=The maximum number of jobs which can be initiated in a single iteration
                     of the backfill scheduler.   This  option  applies  only  to  <b>SchedulerType=sched/backfill</b>.

              <b>bf_max_job_test</b>=The maximum number of jobs to attempt backfill scheduling for
                     (i.e.  the  queue  depth).   Higher values result in more overhead and less responsiveness.
                     Until an attempt is made to backfill schedule a job, its  expected  initiation  time  value
                     will  not  be set.  In the case of large clusters, configuring a relatively small value may
                     be desirable.  This option applies only  to  <b>SchedulerType=sched/backfill</b>.   Default:  500,
                     Min: 1, Max: 1,000,000.

              <b>bf_max_job_user</b>=The maximum number of jobs per user to attempt starting with the backfill
                     scheduler  for  ALL  partitions.  One can set this limit to prevent users from flooding the
                     backfill queue with jobs that cannot start and that prevent jobs from other users to start.
                     This  is  similar  to  the  MAXIJOB  limit  in  Maui.   This   option   applies   only   to

              <b>bf_max_job_user_part</b>=The maximum number of jobs per user per partition to attempt starting with
              the
                     backfill   scheduler   for   any   single   partition.    This   option   applies  only  to

              <b>bf_max_time</b>=The maximum time in seconds the backfill scheduler can spend (including time
                     spent  sleeping  when  locks are released) before discontinuing, even if maximum job counts
                     have not been reached.  This option  applies  only  to  <b>SchedulerType=sched/backfill</b>.   The
                     default  value  is  the  value  of  bf_interval  (which  defaults to 30 seconds).  Default:
                     bf_interval value (def. 30 sec), Min: 1, Max: 3600 (1h).  <b>NOTE</b>: If bf_interval is short and
                     bf_max_time is large, this may cause locks to be acquired too  frequently  and  starve  out
                     other  serviced RPCs. It's advisable if using this parameter to set max_rpc_cnt high enough
                     that scheduling isn't always disabled, and low enough that the interactive workload can get
                     through in a reasonable period of time. max_rpc_cnt needs to be below 256 (the default  RPC
                     thread  limit).  Running  around  the  middle  (150) may give you good results.  <b>NOTE</b>: When
                     increasing the amount of time  spent  in  the  backfill  scheduling  cycle,  Slurm  can  be
                     prevented  from  responding  to client requests in a timely manner. To address this you can
                     use <b>max_rpc_cnt</b> to specify a number of queued RPCs before the scheduler stops to respond to
                     these requests.

              <b>bf_min_age_reserve</b>=The backfill and main scheduling logic will not reserve resources for pending
                     jobs until they have been pending and  runnable  for  at  least  the  specified  number  of
                     seconds.   In addition, jobs waiting for less than the specified number of seconds will not
                     prevent a newly submitted job from starting immediately, even if the  newly  submitted  job
                     has  a  lower  priority.   This can be valuable if jobs lack time limits or all time limits
                     have the same value.  The default value is zero,  which  will  reserve  resources  for  any
                     pending    job    and    delay    initiation    of   lower   priority   jobs.    Also   see
                     bf_job_part_count_reserve and bf_min_prio_reserve.  Default: 0, Min: 0,  Max:  2592000  (30
                     days).

              <b>bf_min_prio_reserve</b>=The backfill and main scheduling logic will not reserve resources for pending
                     jobs unless they have a priority equal to or higher than the specified value.  In addition,
                     jobs  with  a  lower  priority  will  not  prevent  a  newly  submitted  job  from starting
                     immediately, even if the newly submitted job has a lower priority.  This can be valuable if
                     one wished to maximize system utilization without regard for job priority below  a  certain
                     threshold.  The default value is zero, which will reserve resources for any pending job and
                     delay   initiation   of  lower  priority  jobs.   Also  see  bf_job_part_count_reserve  and
                     bf_min_age_reserve.  Default: 0, Min: 0, Max: 2^63.

              <b>bf_node_space_size</b>=Size of backfill node_space table. Adding a single job to backfill reservations
                     in the worst case can consume two node_space records.   In  the  case  of  large  clusters,
                     configuring  a  relatively  small  value  may  be  desirable.   This option applies only to
                     <b>SchedulerType=sched/backfill</b>.   Also  see   bf_max_job_test   and   bf_running_job_reserve.
                     Default: bf_max_job_test, Min: 2, Max: 2,000,000.

              <b>bf_one_resv_per_job</b>
                     Disallow  adding more than one backfill reservation per job.  The scheduling logic builds a
                     sorted list of job-partition pairs. Jobs submitted to  multiple  partitions  have  as  many
                     entries  in  the  list  as  requested  partitions.  By  default, the backfill scheduler may
                     evaluate all the job-partition entries for a single job,  potentially  reserving  resources
                     for  each  pair,  but  only starting the job in the reservation offering the earliest start
                     time.  Having a single job reserving resources for multiple partitions could  impede  other
                     jobs  (or  hetjob  components) from reserving resources already reserved for the partitions
                     that don't offer the earliest start time.  A single job that requests  multiple  partitions
                     can  also  prevent  itself  from  starting  earlier  in  a  lower priority partition if the
                     partitions overlap nodes and a backfill reservation in the higher priority partition blocks
                     nodes that are also in the lower priority partition.  This option makes it so  that  a  job
                     submitted to multiple partitions will stop reserving resources once the first job-partition
                     pair  has  booked  a  backfill reservation. Subsequent pairs from the same job will only be
                     tested to start now. This allows for other  jobs  to  be  able  to  book  the  other  pairs
                     resources  at  the  cost of not guaranteeing that the multi partition job will start in the
                     partition offering the earliest start time (unless it can start immediately).  This  option
                     is disabled by default.

              <b>bf_resolution</b>=The number of seconds in the resolution of data maintained about when jobs
                     begin and end. Higher values result in better responsiveness and quicker backfill cycles by
                     using  larger blocks of time to determine node eligibility.  However, higher values lead to
                     less efficient system planning, and may miss opportunities to improve  system  utilization.
                     This  option  applies only to <b>SchedulerType=sched/backfill</b>.  Default: 60, Min: 1, Max: 3600
                     (1 hour).

              <b>bf_running_job_reserve</b>
                     Add an extra step to backfill logic, which creates backfill reservations for  jobs  running
                     on whole nodes.  This option is disabled by default.

              <b>bf_topopt_enable</b>
                     Enable  experimental  hook  to  control  whether  to  delay  jobs  in backfill for a better
                     placement. Modify <u>src/plugins/sched/backfill/oracle.c</u> for testing.

                     It is recommended to disable the main scheduler  so  that  all  jobs  are  planned  through
                     backfill   and   utilize   the   oracle   function().   This   can   be   done  by  setting
                     <b>SchedulerParameters=sched_interval=-1</b>.

                     It's also recommended to run  with  <b>SchedulerParameters=bf_running_job_reserve</b>  for  better
                     planning.

              <b>bf_topopt_iterations</b>
                     The number of successive backfill map slots that a job may be delayed.  This option applies
                     only when the <b>bf_topopt_enable</b> is set.

              <b>bf_window</b>=The number of minutes into the future to look when considering jobs to schedule.
                     Higher values result in more overhead and less responsiveness.  A value at least as long as
                     the  highest allowed time limit is generally advisable to prevent job starvation.  In order
                     to limit the amount of data managed by the backfill scheduler, if the value of <b>bf_window</b> is
                     increased, then it is generally advisable to  also  increase  <b>bf_resolution</b>.   This  option
                     applies  only  to  <b>SchedulerType=sched/backfill</b>.  Default: 1440 (1 day), Min: 1, Max: 43200
                     (30 days).

              <b>bf_window_linear</b>=For performance reasons, the backfill scheduler will decrease precision in
                     calculation of job expected termination times. By  default,  the  precision  starts  at  30
                     seconds  and  that  time  interval doubles with each evaluation of currently executing jobs
                     when trying to determine when a pending job  can  start.  This  algorithm  can  support  an
                     environment  with many thousands of running jobs, but can result in the expected start time
                     of pending jobs being gradually being deferred due  to  lack  of  precision.  A  value  for
                     bf_window_linear  will cause the time interval to be increased by a constant amount on each
                     iteration.  The value is specified in units of seconds. For example, a  value  of  60  will
                     cause  the backfill scheduler on the first iteration to identify the job ending soonest and
                     determine if the pending job can be started after that job plus all other jobs expected  to
                     end  within 30 seconds (default initial value) of the first job. On the next iteration, the
                     pending job will be evaluated for starting after the next job expected to end plus all jobs
                     ending within 90 seconds of that time (30 second default, plus the 60 second option value).
                     The third iteration will have a 150 second window and the fourth 210 seconds.  Without this
                     option, the time windows will double on each  iteration  and  thus  be  30,  60,  120,  240
                     seconds,  etc.  The use of bf_window_linear is not recommended with more than a few hundred
                     simultaneously executing jobs.

              <b>bf_yield_interval</b>=The backfill scheduler will periodically relinquish locks in order for other
                     pending operations to take place.  This specifies the times when the locks are relinquished
                     in microseconds.  Smaller values may be helpful for high throughput computing when used  in
                     conjunction  with  the  <b>bf_continue</b>  option.  Also see the <b>bf_yield_sleep</b> option.  Default:
                     2,000,000 (2 sec), Min: 1, Max: 10,000,000 (10 sec).

              <b>bf_yield_sleep</b>=The backfill scheduler will periodically relinquish locks in order for other
                     pending operations to take place.  This specifies the length of time for  which  the  locks
                     are relinquished in microseconds.  Also see the <b>bf_yield_interval</b> option.  Default: 500,000
                     (0.5 sec), Min: 1, Max: 10,000,000 (10 sec).

              <b>build_queue_timeout</b>=Defines the maximum time that can be devoted to building a queue of jobs to
                     be  tested for scheduling.  If the system has a huge number of jobs with dependencies, just
                     building the job queue can take  so  much  time  as  to  adversely  impact  overall  system
                     performance  and  this parameter can be adjusted as needed.  The default value is 2,000,000
                     microseconds (2 seconds).

              <b>correspond_after_task_cnt</b>=Defines the number of array tasks that get split for potential aftercorr
                     dependency check. Low number may result in dependent task check failures when the  job  one
                     depends on gets purged before the split.  Default: 10.

              <b>default_queue_depth</b>=The default number of jobs to attempt scheduling (i.e. the queue depth) when a
                     running  job completes or other routine actions occur, however the frequency with which the
                     scheduler is run may be  limited  by  using  the  <b>defer</b>  or  <b>sched_min_interval</b>  parameters
                     described  below.   The  main  scheduling  loop  will  run  (ignoring this limit) on a less
                     frequent basis as defined by the <b>sched_interval</b> option described below. The  default  value
                     is 100.  See the <b>partition_job_depth</b> option to limit depth by partition.

              <b>defer</b>  Setting  this  option will avoid attempting to schedule each job individually at job submit
                     time, but defer it until a later time when scheduling multiple jobs simultaneously  may  be
                     possible.   This  option may improve system responsiveness when large numbers of jobs (many
                     hundreds) are submitted at the same  time,  but  it  will  delay  the  initiation  time  of
                     individual jobs. Also see <b>default_queue_depth</b> above.

              <b>defer_batch</b>
                     Like  <b>defer</b>,  but  only  will defer scheduling for batch jobs. Interactive allocations from
                     salloc/srun will still attempt to schedule immediately upon submission.

              <b>delay_boot</b>=Do not reboot nodes in order to satisfied this job's feature specification if
                     the job has been eligible to run for less than this time period.  If the job has waited for
                     less than the specified period, it will use only nodes which  already  have  the  specified
                     features.   The argument is in units of minutes.  Individual jobs may override this default
                     value with the <b>--delay-boot</b> option.

              <b>disable_job_shrink</b>
                     Deny user requests to shrink the size of running jobs. (However,  running  jobs  may  still
                     shrink due to node failure if the --no-kill option was set.)

              <b>disable_hetjob_steps</b>
                     Disable job steps that span heterogeneous job allocations.

              <b>enable_hetjob_steps</b>
                     Enable job steps that span heterogeneous job allocations.  The default value.

              <b>enable_job_state_cache</b>
                     Enables  an independent cache of job state details within slurmctld. This allows processing
                     of `<b>squeue</b> --only-job-state` and replaced RPCs  with  minimal  impact  on  other  slurmctld
                     operations.

              <b>enable_user_top</b>
                     Enable use of the "scontrol top" command by non-privileged users.

              <b>extra_constraints</b>
                     Enable  node  filtering with the --extra option for salloc, sbatch, and srun and the node's
                     Extra field.

              <b>ignore_constraint_validation</b>
                     If set, and a job requests --constraint any features in the request that  would  create  an
                     invalid  request  with  the current system will not generate an error.  This is helpful for
                     dynamic systems where nodes with features come and go.  Jobs will remain in the  job  queue
                     until the requested feature is in the cluster and available.  Please note using this option
                     will not protect you from typos.  See also ignore_prefer_validation.

              <b>Ignore_NUMA</b>
                     Some processors (e.g. AMD Opteron 6000 series) contain multiple NUMA nodes per socket. This
                     is  a  configuration  which  does  not  map into the hardware entities that Slurm optimizes
                     resource allocation for (PU/thread, core, socket, baseboard, node and network  switch).  In
                     order to optimize resource allocations on such hardware, Slurm will consider each NUMA node
                     within the socket as a separate socket by default. Use the Ignore_NUMA option to report the
                     correct socket count, but <b>not</b> optimize resource allocations on the NUMA nodes.

                     <b>NOTE</b>: Since hwloc 2.0 NUMA Nodes are are not part of the main/CPU topology tree, because of
                     that  if  Slurm  is  build  with  hwloc  2.0 or above Slurm will treat HWLOC_OBJ_PACKAGE as
                     Socket, you can change this behavior using <b>SlurmdParameters</b>=l3cache_as_socket.

              <b>ignore_prefer_validation</b>
                     If set, and a job requests --prefer any features  in  the  request  that  would  create  an
                     invalid  request  with  the current system will not generate an error.  This is helpful for
                     dynamic systems where nodes with features come and go.  Please note using this option  will
                     not protect you from typos.  See also ignore_constraint_validation.

              <b>max_array_tasks</b>
                     Specify the maximum number of tasks that can be included in a job array.  The default limit
                     is  MaxArraySize,  but  this  option  can  be  used  to  set  a  lower  limit. For example,
                     max_array_tasks=1000 and MaxArraySize=100001 would permit a maximum task ID of 100000,  but
                     limit the number of tasks in any single job array to 1000.

              <b>max_rpc_cnt</b>=If the number of active threads in the slurmctld daemon is equal to or
                     larger  than  this value, defer scheduling of jobs. The scheduler will check this condition
                     at certain points in code and yield locks if necessary.  This can improve  Slurm's  ability
                     to  process  requests  at a cost of initiating new jobs less frequently. Default: 0 (option
                     disabled), Min: 0, Max: 1000.

                     <b>NOTE</b>: The maximum number of threads (MAX_SERVER_THREADS)  is  internally  set  to  256  and
                     defines  the  number  of  served RPCs at a given time. Setting max_rpc_cnt to more than 256
                     will be only useful to let backfill continue scheduling work after locks have been  yielded
                     (i.e.  each 2 seconds) if there are a maximum of MAX(max_rpc_cnt/10, 20) RPCs in the queue.
                     i.e. max_rpc_cnt=1000, the scheduler will be allowed to continue after yielding locks  only
                     when  there are less than or equal to 100 pending RPCs.  If a value is set, then a value of
                     10 or higher is recommended. It may require some tuning for each system, but  needs  to  be
                     high  enough  that  scheduling  isn't always disabled, and low enough that requests can get
                     through in a reasonable period of time.

              <b>max_sched_time</b>=How long, in seconds, that the main scheduling loop will execute for before
                     exiting.  If a value is configured, be aware  that  all  other  Slurm  operations  will  be
                     deferred during this time period.  Make certain the value is lower than <b>MessageTimeout</b>.  If
                     a  value  is  not explicitly configured, the default value is half of <b>MessageTimeout</b> with a
                     minimum default value of 1 second and a maximum default value of 2 seconds.  For example if
                     MessageTimeout=10, the time limit will be 2 seconds (i.e. MIN(10/2, 2) = 2).

              <b>max_script_size</b>=Specify the maximum size of a batch script, in bytes.
                     The default value is 4 megabytes.  Larger values may adversely impact system performance.

              <b>max_submit_line_size</b>=Specify the maximum size of a submit line, in bytes.
                     The default value is 1 megabtye.  This option cannot exceed 2 megabytes.

              <b>max_switch_wait</b>=Maximum number of seconds that a job can delay execution waiting for the
                     specified desired switch count. The default value is 300 seconds.

              <b>no_backup_scheduling</b>
                     If used, the backup controller will not schedule  jobs  when  it  takes  over.  The  backup
                     controller  will  allow jobs to be submitted, modified and cancelled but won't schedule new
                     jobs. This is useful in Cray environments when the backup controller resides on an external
                     Cray node.

              <b>no_env_cache</b>
                     If used, any job started on node that fails to load the env from a node will  fail  instead
                     of  using the cached env. This will also implicitly imply the requeue_setup_env_fail option
                     as well.

              <b>nohold_on_prolog_fail</b>
                     By default, if the Prolog exits with a non-zero value the job is requeued in a held  state.
                     By  specifying  this  parameter the job will be requeued but not held so that the scheduler
                     can dispatch it to another host.

              <b>pack_serial_at_end</b>
                     If used with the select/cons_tres plugin, then put serial jobs at the end of the  available
                     nodes  rather  than using a best fit algorithm.  This may reduce resource fragmentation for
                     some workloads.

              <b>partition_job_depth</b>=The default number of jobs to attempt scheduling (i.e. the queue depth)
                     from each partition/queue in Slurm's main scheduling logic.  This limit  will  be  enforced
                     for  all  main  scheduler  cycles.   The  functionality  is similar to that provided by the
                     <b>bf_max_job_part</b> option for the backfill scheduling logic.   The  default  value  is  0  (no
                     limit).   Job's excluded from attempted scheduling based upon partition will not be counted
                     against the <b>default_queue_depth</b> limit.  Also see the <b>bf_max_job_part</b> option.

              <b>reduce_completing_frag</b>
                     This option is used to control how scheduling of resources is performed when  jobs  are  in
                     the  COMPLETING state, which influences potential fragmentation.  If this option is not set
                     then no jobs will be started in any partition when any job is in the COMPLETING  state  for
                     less  than <b>CompleteWait</b> seconds.  If this option is set then no jobs will be started in any
                     individual partition that has a job in COMPLETING state for less than <b>CompleteWait</b> seconds.
                     In addition, no jobs will be started in any partition with  nodes  that  overlap  with  any
                     nodes  in  the  partition  of the completing job.  This option is to be used in conjunction
                     with <b>CompleteWait</b>.

                     <b>NOTE</b>: <b>CompleteWait</b> must be set in order for this  to  work.  If  <b>CompleteWait=0</b>  then  this
                     option does nothing.

                     <b>NOTE</b>: <b>reduce_completing_frag</b> only affects the main scheduler, not the backfill scheduler.

              <b>requeue_setup_env_fail</b>
                     By  default  if  a  job  environment  setup  fails  the  job  keeps  running with a limited
                     environment. By specifying this parameter the job will be requeued in held  state  and  the
                     execution node drained.

              <b>salloc_wait_nodes</b>
                     If  defined, the salloc command will wait until all allocated nodes are ready for use (i.e.
                     booted) before the command returns. By default, salloc will return as soon as the  resource
                     allocation  has  been  made.  The  salloc  command  can  use the --wait-all-nodes option to
                     override this configuration parameter.

              <b>sbatch_wait_nodes</b>
                     If defined, the sbatch script will wait until all allocated nodes are ready for  use  (i.e.
                     booted)  before  the initiation. By default, the sbatch script will be initiated as soon as
                     the  first  node  in  the  job  allocation  is  ready.  The  sbatch  command  can  use  the
                     --wait-all-nodes option to override this configuration parameter.

              <b>sched_interval</b>=How frequently, in seconds, the main scheduling loop will execute and test all
                     pending  jobs,  with  only the <b>partition_job_depth</b> limit in place.  The default value is 60
                     seconds.  A setting of -1 will disable the main scheduling loop.

              <b>sched_max_job_start</b>=The maximum number of jobs that the main scheduling logic will start in any
                     single execution.  The default value is zero, which imposes no limit.

              <b>sched_min_interval</b>=How frequently, in microseconds, the main scheduling loop will execute and test
                     any pending jobs.  The scheduler runs in a  limited  fashion  every  time  that  any  event
                     happens which could enable a job to start (e.g. job submit, job terminate, etc.).  If these
                     events  happen  at  a  high  frequency,  the  scheduler can run very frequently and consume
                     significant resources if not throttled by this option.  This option specifies  the  minimum
                     time  between  the  end  of  one  scheduling cycle and the beginning of the next scheduling
                     cycle.  A value of zero will disable throttling of  the  scheduling  logic  interval.   The
                     default value is 2 microseconds.

              <b>spec_cores_first</b>
                     Specialized  cores  will  be  selected  from  the first cores of the first sockets, cycling
                     through the sockets on a round robin basis.  By default, specialized cores will be selected
                     from the last cores of the last sockets, cycling through  the  sockets  on  a  round  robin
                     basis.

              <b>step_retry_count</b>=When a step completes and there are steps ending resource allocation, then
                     retry   step   allocations   for   at  least  this  number  of  pending  steps.   Also  see
                     <b>step_retry_time</b>.  The default value is 8 steps.

              <b>step_retry_time</b>=When a step completes and there are steps ending resource allocation, then
                     retry step allocations for all steps which have been pending for at least  this  number  of
                     seconds.  Also see <b>step_retry_count</b>.  The default value is 60 seconds.

              <b>time_min_as_soft_limit</b>
                     Treat  the  --time-min limit as a soft time limit for the job. Scheduling will plan for the
                     shorter duration, while permitting the job to continue running until  the  ("hard")  --time
                     limit.

              <b>whole_hetjob</b>
                     Requests to cancel, hold or release any component of a heterogeneous job will be applied to
                     all components of the job.

                     <b>NOTE</b>: This option was previously named whole_pack and this is still supported for backwards
                     compatibility.

       <b>SchedulerTimeSlice</b>
              Number  of  seconds in each time slice when gang scheduling is enabled (<b>PreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG</b>).
              The value must be between 5 seconds and 65533 seconds.  The default value is 30 seconds.

       <b>SchedulerType</b>
              Identifies the type of scheduler to be used.  The <b>scontrol</b> command can be used to manually  change
              job priorities if desired.  Acceptable values include:

              <b>sched/backfill</b>
                     For  a  backfill  scheduling  module  to  augment  the  default  FIFO scheduling.  Backfill
                     scheduling will initiate lower-priority jobs if  doing  so  does  not  delay  the  expected
                     initiation  time  of  any  higher  priority  job.   Effectiveness of backfill scheduling is
                     dependent upon users specifying job time limits, otherwise all jobs will have the same time
                     limit and backfilling is impossible.  Note documentation for the <b>SchedulerParameters</b> option
                     above.  This is the default configuration.

              <b>sched/builtin</b>
                     This is the FIFO scheduler which initiates jobs in priority  order.   If  any  job  in  the
                     partition  can not be scheduled, no lower priority job in that partition will be scheduled.
                     An exception is made for jobs that can not run due to partition constraints (e.g. the  time
                     limit)  or  down/drained nodes.  In that case, lower priority jobs can be initiated and not
                     impact the higher priority job.

       <b>ScronParameters</b>
              Multiple options may be comma separated.

              <b>enable</b> Enable the use of scrontab to submit and manage periodic repeating jobs.

              <b>explicit_scancel</b>
                     When cancelling an scrontab job, require the user to explicitly request cancelling the  job
                     with the --cron flag in scancel.

       <b>SelectType</b>
              Identifies the type of resource selection algorithm to be used.  When changed, all job information
              (running  and  pending)  will  be  lost,  since  the  job state save format used by each plugin is
              different.  The only exception to this is when changing from the legacy cons_res to cons_tres.

              Acceptable values include

              <b>select/cons_tres</b>
                     The resources (cores, memory, GPUs and all other trackable resources)  within  a  node  are
                     individually  allocated as consumable resources.  Note that whole nodes can be allocated to
                     jobs for  selected  partitions  by  using  the  <u>OverSubscribe=Exclusive</u>  option.   See  the
                     partition <b>OverSubscribe</b> parameter for more information.  This is the default value.

              <b>select/linear</b>
                     for  allocation  of  entire  nodes  assuming  a  one-dimensional  array  of  nodes in which
                     sequentially ordered nodes are preferable.  For a heterogeneous cluster (e.g. different CPU
                     counts on the various nodes), resource allocations will favor nodes with high CPU counts as
                     needed based upon the job's node and CPU specification  if  TopologyPlugin=topology/default
                     is  configured. Use of other topology plugins with select/linear and heterogeneous nodes is
                     not recommended and may result in valid job allocation requests being rejected. The  linear
                     plugin  is  not  designed  to  track  generic  resources  on a node. In cases where generic
                     resources (such as GPUs) need to be tracked, the cons_tres plugin should be used instead.

       <b>SelectTypeParameters</b>
              The permitted values of <b>SelectTypeParameters</b> depend upon the configured value of <b>SelectType</b>.   The
              only  supported options for <b>SelectType=select/linear</b> are <b>CR_ONE_TASK_PER_CORE</b> and <b>CR_Memory</b>, which
              treats memory as a consumable resource and prevents memory over subscription with  job  preemption
              or  gang  scheduling.   By  default <b>SelectType=select/linear</b> allocates whole nodes to jobs without
              considering their memory consumption.  By default <b>SelectType=select/cons_tres</b> uses <b>CR_Core_Memory</b>,
              which allocates Core to jobs while considering their memory consumption.

              The following options are supported by the <b>SelectType=select/cons_tres</b> plugin:

              <b>CR_CPU</b> CPUs are consumable resources.  Configure the number of <b>CPUs</b> on each  node,  which  may  be
                     equal to the count of cores or hyper-threads on the node depending upon the desired minimum
                     resource  allocation.   The  node's  <b>Boards</b>, <b>Sockets</b>, <b>CoresPerSocket</b> and <b>ThreadsPerCore</b> may
                     optionally be configured and result  in  job  allocations  which  have  improved  locality;
                     however doing so will prevent more than one job from being allocated on each core.

              <b>CR_CPU_Memory</b>
                     CPUs and memory are consumable resources.  Configure the number of <b>CPUs</b> on each node, which
                     may  be equal to the count of cores or hyper-threads on the node depending upon the desired
                     minimum resource allocation.  The node's <b>Boards</b>, <b>Sockets</b>, <b>CoresPerSocket</b> and <b>ThreadsPerCore</b>
                     may optionally be configured and result in job allocations which  have  improved  locality;
                     however doing so will prevent more than one job from being allocated on each core.  Setting
                     a value for <b>DefMemPerCPU</b> is strongly recommended.

              <b>CR_Core</b>
                     Cores  are  consumable resources.  On nodes with hyper-threads, each thread is counted as a
                     CPU to satisfy a job's resource requirement, but multiple jobs are not allocated threads on
                     the same core.  The count of CPUs allocated to a job is rounded up to account for every CPU
                     on an allocated core. This will also impact total allocated memory  when  --mem-per-cpu  is
                     used to be multiply of total number of CPUs on allocated cores.

              <b>CR_Core_Memory</b>
                     Cores  and  memory  are  consumable resources.  On nodes with hyper-threads, each thread is
                     counted as a CPU to satisfy a  job's  resource  requirement,  but  multiple  jobs  are  not
                     allocated threads on the same core.  The count of CPUs allocated to a job may be rounded up
                     to  account  for  every  CPU  on  an  allocated  core.  Setting a value for <b>DefMemPerCPU</b> is
                     strongly recommended.

              <b>CR_ONE_TASK_PER_CORE</b>
                     Allocate one task per core by default.  Without this option, by default one  task  will  be
                     allocated  per  thread  on  nodes with more than one <b>ThreadsPerCore</b> configured.  <b>NOTE</b>: This
                     option cannot be used with CR_CPU*.

              <b>CR_CORE_DEFAULT_DIST_BLOCK</b>
                     Allocate  cores  within  a  node  using  block  distribution  by  default.    This   is   a
                     pseudo-best-fit  algorithm  that minimizes the number of boards and minimizes the number of
                     sockets (within minimum boards) used for the allocation.   This  default  behavior  can  be
                     overridden  specifying  a  particular "-m" parameter with srun/salloc/sbatch.  Without this
                     option, cores will be allocated cyclically across the sockets.

              <b>CR_LLN</b> Schedule resources to jobs on the least loaded nodes (based upon the number of idle  CPUs).
                     This  is  generally  only recommended for an environment with serial jobs as idle resources
                     will tend to be highly fragmented, resulting in parallel jobs being distributed across many
                     nodes.  Note that node <b>Weight</b> takes precedence over how many idle  resources  are  on  each
                     node.   Also  see  the  partition configuration parameter <b>LLN</b> use the least loaded nodes in
                     selected partitions.

              <b>CR_Pack_Nodes</b>
                     If a job allocation contains more resources than will be used for launching tasks (e.g.  if
                     whole  nodes  are  allocated  to a job), then rather than distributing a job's tasks evenly
                     across its allocated nodes, pack them as tightly as possible on these nodes.  For  example,
                     consider  a  job  allocation  containing two <b>entire</b> nodes with eight CPUs each.  If the job
                     starts ten tasks across those two nodes without this option, it will start  five  tasks  on
                     each of the two nodes.  With this option, eight tasks will be started on the first node and
                     two   tasks   on   the  second  node.   This  can  be  superseded  by  "NoPack"  in  srun's
                     "--distribution" option.  CR_Pack_Nodes only applies when  the  "block"  task  distribution
                     method is used.

              <b>LL_SHARED_GRES</b>
                     When  allocating  resources  for  a shared GRES (gres/mps, gres/shard), prefer least loaded
                     device (in terms of already allocated fraction). This  way  jobs  are  spread  across  GRES
                     devices  on  the  node, instead of the default behavior where the first available device is
                     used.  This option is only supported by select/cons_tres plugin.

              <b>CR_Socket</b>
                     Sockets are consumable resources.  On nodes with multiple cores, each  core  or  thread  is
                     counted  as  a  CPU  to  satisfy  a  job's  resource requirement, but multiple jobs are not
                     allocated resources on the same socket.

              <b>CR_Socket_Memory</b>
                     Memory and sockets are consumable resources.  On nodes with multiple cores,  each  core  or
                     thread  is  counted as a CPU to satisfy a job's resource requirement, but multiple jobs are
                     not allocated resources on the same socket.  Setting a value for <b>DefMemPerCPU</b>  is  strongly
                     recommended.

              <b>CR_Memory</b>
                     Memory   is   a   consumable   resource.    <b>NOTE</b>:   This   implies   <u>OverSubscribe=YES</u>   or
                     <u>OverSubscribe=FORCE</u> for all partitions.  Setting  a  value  for  <b>DefMemPerCPU</b>  is  strongly
                     recommended.

              <b>MULTIPLE_SHARING_GRES_PJ</b>
                     By  default,  only  one  sharing  gres  per  job  is  allowed on each node from shared gres
                     requests. This allows multiple sharing gres' to be used on a single node to satisfy  shared
                     gres  requirements  per  job.   Example:  If there are 10 shards to a gpu and 12 shards are
                     requested, instead of being denied the job will be allocated with 2 gpus. 1 using 10 shards
                     and the other using 2 shards.

              <b>ENFORCE_BINDING_GRES</b>
                     Set <b>--gres-flags=enforce-binding</b> as the default in every job.  This can be overridden  with
                     <b>--gres-flags=disable-binding</b>.

              <b>ONE_TASK_PER_SHARING_GRES</b>
                     Set  <b>--gres-flags=one-task-per-sharing</b> as the default in every job.  This can be overridden
                     with <b>--gres-flags=multiple-tasks-per-sharing</b>.

              <b>NOTE</b>: If memory isn't configured as a consumable resource (CR_CPU, CR_Core  or  CR_Socket  without
              _Memory)  memory  can  be  oversubscribed and will not be constrained by task/cgroup even if it is
              configured in cgroup.conf. In this case the <u>--mem</u> option is only used to  filter  out  nodes  with
              lower  configured  memory  and  does  not  take  running jobs into account. For instance, two jobs
              requesting all the memory of a node can run at the same time.

       <b>SlurmctldAddr</b>
              An optional address to be used for  communications  to  the  currently  active  slurmctld  daemon,
              normally used with Virtual IP addressing of the currently active server.  If this parameter is not
              specified  then  each  primary  and  backup  server  will  have  its  own  unique address used for
              communications as specified in the <b>SlurmctldHost</b> parameter.  If this parameter is  specified  then
              the <b>SlurmctldHost</b> parameter will still be used for communications to specific slurmctld primary or
              backup  servers,  for  example  to  cause  all  of them to read the current configuration files or
              shutdown.   Also  see  the  <b>SlurmctldPrimaryOffProg</b>   and   <b>SlurmctldPrimaryOnProg</b>   configuration
              parameters to configure programs to manipulate virtual IP address manipulation.

       <b>SlurmctldDebug</b>
              The  level  of  detail  to  provide  <b>slurmctld</b>  daemon's logs.  The default value is <b>info</b>.  If the
              <b>slurmctld</b> daemon is initiated with -v or --verbose options, that debug level will be preserved  or
              restored upon reconfiguration.

              <b>quiet</b>     Log nothing

              <b>fatal</b>     Log only fatal errors

              <b>error</b>     Log only errors

              <b>info</b>      Log errors and general informational messages

              <b>verbose</b>   Log errors and verbose informational messages

              <b>debug</b>     Log errors and verbose informational messages and debugging messages

              <b>debug2</b>    Log errors and verbose informational messages and more debugging messages

              <b>debug3</b>    Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages

              <b>debug4</b>    Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages

              <b>debug5</b>    Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages

       <b>SlurmctldHost</b>
              The  short, or long, hostname of the machine where Slurm control daemon is executed (i.e. the name
              returned by the command "hostname -s").  This hostname is optionally followed  by  either  the  IP
              address or a name by which the address can be identified, enclosed in parentheses. e.g.
              SlurmctldHost=slurmctl-primary(12.34.56.78)

              If the host where slurmctld will run may be modified by another process, such as pacemaker, then a
              comma-delimited list with the hostname of every machine should be provided. e.g.
              SlurmctldHost=slurmctl-primary1,slurmctl-primary2,slurmctl-primary3(slurmctl-primary)

              SlurmctldHost  must  be specified at least once. If specified more than once, the first entry will
              run as the primary and all other entries as backups.  If  the  first  specified  host  fails,  the
              daemon  will  execute  on the second host.  If both the first and second specified host fails, the
              daemon will execute on the third host.

              Having  an  entry  with  a  comma-delimited  list  is  mutually  exclusive  with  having  multiple
              SlurmctldHost entries.

              Slurm  daemons need to be reconfigured (e.g. "scontrol reconfig") for changes to this parameter to
              take effect. It is okay for jobs to be running when making these changes,  as  the  running  steps
              will get the updated SlurmctldHost info.

       <b>SlurmctldLogFile</b>
              Fully  qualified  pathname  of  a  file  into  which the <b>slurmctld</b> daemon's logs are written.  The
              default value is none (performs logging via syslog).
              See the section <b>LOGGING</b> if a pathname is specified.

       <b>SlurmctldParameters</b>
              Multiple options may be comma separated.

              <b>allow_user_triggers</b>
                     Permit setting triggers from non-root/slurm_user users. SlurmUser must also be set to  root
                     to permit these triggers to work. See the <b>strigger</b> man page for additional details.

              <b>cloud_dns</b>
                     By  default,  Slurm  expects that the network address for a cloud node won't be known until
                     the creation of the node and that Slurm will  be  notified  of  the  node's  address  (e.g.
                     <b>scontrol</b>  <b>update</b>  <b>nodename=&lt;name&gt;</b> <b>nodeaddr=&lt;addr&gt;</b>).  Since Slurm communications rely on the
                     node configuration found in the slurm.conf, Slurm  will  tell  the  client  command,  after
                     waiting  for  all nodes to boot, each node's ip address. However, in environments where the
                     nodes are in DNS, this step can be avoided by configuring this option.

              <b>conmgr_max_connections</b>=<u>&lt;connection_count&gt;</u>
                     Specify the maximum number of connections to be processed at any given time.  This does not
                     influence the maximum number of pending connections as that is controlled  by  the  kernel.
                     Defaults to 50.

              <b>conmgr_threads</b>=<u>&lt;thread_count&gt;</u>
                     The  number  of  process  threads  in  thread  pool  used  to  for receiving and processing
                     connections on the listening sockets. Defaults to 64.

              <b>conmgr_use_poll</b>
                     Use <u><a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</a></u>(2) instead of <u><a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll</a></u>(7) for monitoring file descriptors.

              <b>conmgr_connect_timeout</b>=<u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
                     Wait <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u> before considering an outbound connection attempt to be timed out.  Defaults
                     to the value of <b>MessageTimeout</b>.

              <b>conmgr_read_timeout</b>=<u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
                     Wait  <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>  before considering a read from a file descriptor to be timed out. Defaults
                     to the value of <b>MessageTimeout</b>.

              <b>conmgr_wait_write_delay</b>=<u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
                     When waiting for kernel to flush outgoing buffer, poll kernel for changes  every  <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
                     for changes. Defaults to the value of <b>MessageTimeout</b>.

              <b>conmgr_write_timeout</b>=<u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
                     Wait  <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u> before considering a write from a file descriptor to be timed out. Defaults
                     to the value of <b>MessageTimeout</b>.

              <b>disable_triggers</b>
                     Disable the ability to register new triggers.

              <b>enable_configless</b>
                     Permit "configless" operation by the slurmd, slurmstepd, and user commands.   When  enabled
                     the  slurmd  will  be permitted to retrieve config files and <b>Prolog</b> and <b>Epilog</b> scripts from
                     the slurmctld, and on any 'scontrol reconfigure' command new configs and  scripts  will  be
                     automatically  pushed  out and applied to nodes that are running in this "configless" mode.
                     See https://slurm.schedmd.com/configless_slurm.html for more details.

                     <b>NOTE</b>: Included files with the <b>Include</b> directive will only be pushed if the filename has  no
                     path separators and is located adjacent to slurm.conf.

                     <b>NOTE</b>:  <b>Prolog</b>  and  <b>Epilog</b>  scripts  will  only  be  pushed  if  the filenames have no path
                     separators and are located adjacent to slurm.conf.  Glob patterns (See <b>glob</b>  (7))  are  not
                     supported.

              <b>idle_on_node_suspend</b>
                     Mark  nodes as idle, regardless of current state, when suspending nodes with <b>SuspendProgram</b>
                     so that nodes will be eligible to be resumed at a later time.

              <b>node_reg_mem_percent</b>=Percentage of memory a node is allowed to register with without being marked
              as
                     invalid with low memory. Default is 100. For State=CLOUD  nodes,  the  default  is  90.  To
                     disable  this  for  cloud  nodes set it to 100. <u>config_overrides</u> takes precedence over this
                     option.

                     It's recommended that <u>task/cgroup</u> with <u>ConstrainRamSpace</u> is  configured.  A  memory  cgroup
                     limit  won't  be  set  more  than  the  actual  memory  on  the  node. If needed, configure
                     <u>AllowedRamSpace</u> in the cgroup.conf to add a buffer.

              <b>no_quick_restart</b>
                     By default starting a new instance of the slurmctld will kill the old  one  running  before
                     taking control. If this option is set this will not happen without the <b>-i</b> option.

              <b>power_save_interval</b>
                     How  often  the  power_save thread looks to resume and suspend nodes. The power_save thread
                     will do work sooner if there are node state changes. Default is 10 seconds.

              <b>power_save_min_interval</b>
                     How often the power_save thread, at a minimum, looks to resume and suspend  nodes.  Default
                     is 0.

              <b>max_powered_nodes</b>
                     The  max  number  of  powered  up  nodes  across  the  cluster.  Once this is reached, jobs
                     requesting additional nodes will not start, and "scontrol power up &lt;nodes&gt;" will fail.

              <b>max_dbd_msg_action</b>
                     Action used once MaxDBDMsgs is reached, options are 'discard' (default) and 'exit'.

                     When 'discard' is specified and MaxDBDMsgs is reached we start by purging pending  messages
                     of  types  Step  start and complete, and it reaches MaxDBDMsgs again Job start messages are
                     purged. Job completes and node state changes continue to consume the  empty  space  created
                     from  the  purgings  until  MaxDBDMsgs  is reached again at which no new message is tracked
                     creating data loss and potentially runaway jobs.

                     When 'exit' is specified and MaxDBDMsgs is reached  the  slurmctld  will  exit  instead  of
                     discarding  any  messages.  It  will  be impossible to start the slurmctld with this option
                     where the slurmdbd is down and the slurmctld is tracking more than MaxDBDMsgs.

              <b>reboot_from_controller</b>
                     Run the <b>RebootProgram</b> from the controller instead of on the slurmds. The RebootProgram will
                     be passed a comma-separated list of nodes to reboot as the first argument and if applicable
                     the required features needed for reboot as the second argument.

              <b>rl_bucket_size</b>=
                     Size of the token bucket. This permits a certain amount of RPC burst from a user before the
                     steady-state rate limit takes effect.  The default value is 30.

              <b>rl_enable</b>
                     Enable per-user RPC rate-limiting support. Client-commands will be told  to  back  off  and
                     sleep  for  a  second  once  the  limit  has been reached.  This is implemented as a "token
                     bucket", which permits a certain degree of "bursty" RPC load from an individual user before
                     holding them to a steady-state RPC load established by the refill period and rate.

              <b>rl_log_freq</b>=
                     The maximum frequency (in seconds) for which logs about RPC  limit  being  exceeded  by  an
                     individual  user  are  printed  to the logs. Set to 0 to see every incidence.  Set to -1 to
                     disable the log message entirely.  The default value is 0.

              <b>rl_refill_period</b>=
                     How frequently, in seconds, in which additional tokens are added to each user bucket.   The
                     default value is 1.

              <b>rl_refill_rate</b>=
                     How many tokens to add to the bucket on each period.  The default value is 2.

              <b>rl_table_size</b>=
                     Number  of  entries  in the user hash-table. Recommended value should be at least twice the
                     number of active user accounts on the system.  The default value is 8192.

              <b>enable_stepmgr</b>
                     Enable slurmstepd step management system wide. This enables job steps to be  managed  by  a
                     single  extern  slurmstepd associated with the job to manage steps.  This is beneficial for
                     jobs that submit many steps inside their allocations.  <b>PrologFlags=contain</b> must be set.

              <b>user_resv_delete</b>
                     Allow any user able to run in a reservation to delete it.

              <b>validate_nodeaddr_threads</b>=
                     During startup, slurmctld looks up the address for each compute  node  in  the  system.  On
                     large  systems  this  can  cause  considerable  delay, this option permits the slurmctld to
                     concurrently handle the lookup calls and can reduce system startup time  considerably.  The
                     default value is 1. Maximum permitted value is 64.

       <b>SlurmctldPidFile</b>
              Fully  qualified pathname of a file into which the <b>slurmctld</b> daemon may write its process id. This
              may be used for automated signal processing.  The default value is "/var/run/slurmctld.pid".

       <b>SlurmctldPort</b>
              The port number that the Slurm controller, <b>slurmctld</b>, listens to for work. The  default  value  is
              SLURMCTLD_PORT  as  established  at system build time. If none is explicitly specified, it will be
              set to 6817.  <b>SlurmctldPort</b> may also be configured to support a range of port numbers in order  to
              accept  larger  bursts  of  incoming  messages by specifying two numbers separated by a dash (e.g.
              <b>SlurmctldPort=6817-6818</b>).  <b>NOTE</b>: Either <b>slurmctld</b> and <b>slurmd</b> daemons must not execute on the  same
              nodes or the values of <b>SlurmctldPort</b> and <b>SlurmdPort</b> must be different.

              <b>NOTE</b>: On Cray systems, Realm-Specific IP Addressing (RSIP) will automatically try to interact with
              anything  opened  on  ports  8192-60000.   Configure  SlurmctldPort  to  use a port outside of the
              configured SrunPortRange and RSIP's port range.

       <b>SlurmctldPrimaryOffProg</b>
              This program is executed when a slurmctld daemon running as the primary server  becomes  a  backup
              server.  By  default  no  program  is  executed.   See  also  the related "SlurmctldPrimaryOnProg"
              parameter.

       <b>SlurmctldPrimaryOnProg</b>
              This program is executed when a slurmctld daemon running as a backup server  becomes  the  primary
              server.  By  default  no  program  is  executed.   When  using virtual IP addresses to manage High
              Available Slurm services, this program can be used to add the IP  address  to  an  interface  (and
              optionally  try to kill the unresponsive slurmctld daemon and flush the ARP caches on nodes on the
              local Ethernet fabric).  See also the related "SlurmctldPrimaryOffProg" parameter.

       <b>SlurmctldSyslogDebug</b>
              The slurmctld daemon will log events to the syslog file at the specified level of detail.  If  not
              set,  the  slurmctld daemon will log to syslog at level <b>fatal</b>, unless there is no <b>SlurmctldLogFile</b>
              and it is running in the background, in which case it will log to syslog at the level specified by
              <b>SlurmctldDebug</b> (at <b>fatal</b> in the case that <b>SlurmctldDebug</b> is set to <b>quiet</b>) or  it  is  run  in  the

              <b>debug5</b>    Log errors and verbose informational messages and even more debugging messages

              <b>NOTE</b>:  By  default,  Slurm's  systemd  service  files  start daemons in the foreground with the -D
              option. This means that systemd will capture  stdout/stderr  output  and  print  that  to  syslog,
              independent  of  Slurm  printing  to  syslog  directly.  To  prevent  systemd from doing this, add
              "StandardOutput=null" and "StandardError=null" to the respective service files or override files.

       <b>SlurmctldTimeout</b>
              The interval, in seconds, that the backup controller waits for the primary controller  to  respond
              before assuming control.  The default value is 120 seconds.  May not exceed 65533.

       <b>SlurmdDebug</b>
              The level of detail to provide <b>slurmd</b> daemon's logs.  The default value is <b>info</b>.

       <b>SlurmdLogFile</b>
              Fully  qualified  pathname of a file into which the <b>slurmd</b> daemon's logs are written.  The default
              value is none (performs logging via syslog).  The first "%h" within the name is replaced with  the
              hostname  on  which  the  <b>slurmd</b>  is running.  The first "%n" within the name is replaced with the
              Slurm node name on which the <b>slurmd</b> is running.
              See the section <b>LOGGING</b> if a pathname is specified.

       <b>SlurmdParameters</b>
              Parameters specific to the Slurmd.  Multiple options may be comma separated.

              <b>allow_ecores</b>
                     If set, and processors on your nodes have E-Cores, allows them to be used in for scheduling
                     and task placement. (By default, E-Cores are ignored.)

              <b>config_overrides</b>
                     If set, consider the configuration of each node to be  that  specified  in  the  slurm.conf
                     configuration  file and any node with less than the configured resources will <b>not</b> be set to
                     INVAL/INVALID_REG.  This option is generally only useful for testing purposes.   Equivalent
                     to the now deprecated FastSchedule=2 option.

              <b>conmgr_max_connections</b>=<u>&lt;connection_count&gt;</u>
                     Specify the maximum number of connections to be processed at any given time.  This does not
                     influence the maximum number of pending connections as that is controlled by the kernel.

              <b>conmgr_threads</b>=<u>&lt;thread_count&gt;</u>
                     The number of process threads to use for the receiving connections on the listening socket.

              <b>conmgr_use_poll</b>
                     Use <u><a href="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</a></u>(2) instead of <u><a href="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll</a></u>(7) for monitoring file descriptors.

              <b>conmgr_connect_timeout</b>=<u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
                     Wait  <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u> before considering an outbound connection attempt to be timed out. Defaults
                     to the value of <b>MessageTimeout</b>.

              <b>conmgr_read_timeout</b>=<u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
                     Wait <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u> before considering a read from a file descriptor to be timed  out.  Defaults
                     to the value of <b>MessageTimeout</b>.

              <b>conmgr_wait_write_delay</b>=<u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
                     When  waiting  for kernel to flush outgoing buffer, poll kernel for changes every <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
                     for changes. Defaults to the value of <b>MessageTimeout</b>.

                     Wait <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u> before considering a write from a file descriptor to be timed out.  Defaults
                     to the value of <b>MessageTimeout</b>.

              <b>l3cache_as_socket</b>
                     Use  the  hwloc  l3cache as the socket count. Can be useful on certain processors where the
                     socket level is too coarse, and the l3cache may provide better  task  distribution.  (E.g.,
                     along   CCX   boundaries   instead   of   socket   boundaries.)   Mutually  exclusive  with
                     numa_node_as_socket.  Requires hwloc v2.

              <b>numa_node_as_socket</b>
                     Use the hwloc NUMA Node to determine main hierarchy object to be used as  socket.   If  the
                     option  is  set  Slurm will check the parent object of NUMA Node and use it as socket. This
                     option may be useful for architectures likes AMD Epyc, where number of nodes per socket may
                     be configured.  Mutually exclusive with l3cache_as_socket.  Requires hwloc v2.

              <b>shutdown_on_reboot</b>
                     If set, the Slurmd will shut itself down when a reboot request is received.

              <b>contain_spank</b>
                     If set and a job_container plugin is specified,  the  spank_user(),  spank_task_post_fork()
                     and spank_task_exit() calls will be run inside the job container.

       <b>SlurmdPidFile</b>
              Fully qualified pathname of a file into which the <b>slurmd</b> daemon may write its process id. This may
              be  used  for  automated  signal  processing.  The first "%h" within the name is replaced with the
              hostname on which the <b>slurmd</b> is running.  The first "%n" within the  name  is  replaced  with  the
              Slurm node name on which the <b>slurmd</b> is running.  The default value is "/var/run/slurmd.pid".

       <b>SlurmdPort</b>
              The port number that the Slurm compute node daemon, <b>slurmd</b>, listens to for work. The default value
              is  SLURMD_PORT  as  established  at system build time. If none is explicitly specified, its value
              will be 6818.  <b>NOTE</b>: Either slurmctld and slurmd daemons must not execute on the same nodes or the
              values of <b>SlurmctldPort</b> and <b>SlurmdPort</b> must be different.

              SrunPortRange and RSIP's port range.

       <b>SlurmdSpoolDir</b>
              Fully qualified pathname of a directory into which the <b>slurmd</b> daemon's state information and batch
              job script information are written. This must be a common  pathname  for  all  nodes,  but  should
              represent  a  directory  which  is local to each node (reference a local file system). The default
              value is "/var/spool/slurmd".  The first "%h" within the name is replaced  with  the  hostname  on
              which  the <b>slurmd</b> is running.  The first "%n" within the name is replaced with the Slurm node name
              on which the <b>slurmd</b> is running.

       <b>SlurmdSyslogDebug</b>
              The slurmd daemon will log events to the syslog file at the specified level of detail. If not set,
              the slurmd daemon will log to syslog at level <b>fatal</b>, unless there is no <b>SlurmdLogFile</b>  and  it  is

       <b>SlurmdTimeout</b>
              The interval, in seconds, that the Slurm controller waits for <b>slurmd</b> to respond before configuring
              that node's state to DOWN.  A value of zero indicates the node will not be tested by <b>slurmctld</b>  to
              confirm  the  state of <b>slurmd</b>, the node will not be automatically set to a DOWN state indicating a
              non-responsive <b>slurmd</b>, and some other tool will take responsibility for monitoring  the  state  of
              each  compute node and its <b>slurmd</b> daemon.  Slurm's hierarchical communication mechanism is used to
              ping the <b>slurmd</b> daemons in order to minimize system noise and overhead.  The default value is  300
              seconds.  The value may not exceed 65533 seconds.

       <b>SlurmdUser</b>
              The name of the user that the <b>slurmd</b> daemon executes as.  This user must exist on all nodes of the
              cluster  for  authentication  of  communications  between  Slurm components.  The default value is
              "root".

       <b>SlurmSchedLogFile</b>
              Fully qualified pathname of the scheduling event logging file.  The syntax of  this  parameter  is
              the  same  as  for  <b>SlurmctldLogFile</b>.   In  order  to  configure  scheduler  logging, set both the
              <b>SlurmSchedLogFile</b> and <b>SlurmSchedLogLevel</b> parameters.

       <b>SlurmSchedLogLevel</b>
              The initial level of scheduling event logging, similar to the  <b>SlurmctldDebug</b>  parameter  used  to
              control  the  initial  level  of  <b>slurmctld</b>  logging.  Valid values for <b>SlurmSchedLogLevel</b> are "0"
              (scheduler logging disabled) and "1" (scheduler logging enabled).  If this parameter  is  omitted,
              the  value  defaults  to  "0"  (disabled).   In order to configure scheduler logging, set both the
              <b>SlurmSchedLogFile</b> and <b>SlurmSchedLogLevel</b> parameters.  The scheduler logging level can  be  changed
              dynamically using <b>scontrol</b>.

       <b>SlurmUser</b>
              The  name  of the user that the <b>slurmctld</b> daemon executes as.  For security purposes, a user other
              than "root" is recommended.  This user must exist on all nodes of the cluster  for  authentication
              of communications between Slurm components.  The default value is "root".

       <b>SrunEpilog</b>
              Fully  qualified  pathname  of  an  executable to be run by srun following the completion of a job
              step. The command line arguments for the executable will be the command and arguments of  the  job
              step. This configuration parameter may be overridden by srun's <b>--epilog</b> parameter. Note that while
              the other "Epilog" executables (e.g., TaskEpilog) are run by slurmd on the compute nodes where the
              tasks are executed, the <b>SrunEpilog</b> runs on the node where the "srun" is executing.

       <b>SrunPortRange</b>
              The  <b>srun</b>  creates a set of listening ports to communicate with the controller, the slurmstepd and
              to handle the application I/O.  By default these ports are ephemeral meaning the port numbers  are
              selected  by the kernel. Using this parameter allow sites to configure a range of ports from which
              srun ports will be selected. This is useful if sites want to allow  only  certain  port  range  on
              their network.

              <b>NOTE</b>: On Cray systems, Realm-Specific IP Addressing (RSIP) will automatically try to interact with
              anything  opened on ports 8192-60000.  Configure SrunPortRange to use a range of ports above those
              used by RSIP, ideally 1000 or more ports, for example "SrunPortRange=60001-63000".

              <b>NOTE</b>: <b>SrunPortRange</b> must be large enough to cover the expected number of  srun  ports  created.  A
              single srun opens 4 listening ports plus 2 more for every 48 hosts beyond the first 48. Use of the
              <b>--pty</b> option will result in an additional port being used.

              Example:
              srun -N 1        will use 4 listening ports.
              srun --pty -N 1  will use 5 listening ports.
              srun -N 48       will use 4 listening ports.
              srun -N 50       will use 6 listening ports.
              srun -N 200      will use 12 listening ports.

       <b>SrunProlog</b>
              Fully qualified pathname of an executable to be run by srun prior to the launch of a job step. The
              command  line arguments for the executable will be the command and arguments of the job step. This
              configuration parameter may be overridden by srun's <b>--prolog</b> parameter. Note that while the  other
              "Prolog" executables (e.g., TaskProlog) are run by slurmd on the compute nodes where the tasks are
              executed, the <b>SrunProlog</b> runs on the node where the "srun" is executing.

       <b>StateSaveLocation</b>
              Fully  qualified  pathname  of  a  directory into which the Slurm controller, <b>slurmctld</b>, saves its
              state (e.g. "/usr/local/slurm/checkpoint").  Slurm state will saved here to  recover  from  system
              failures.   <b>SlurmUser</b>  must  be  able  to create files in this directory.  If you have a secondary
              <b>SlurmctldHost</b> configured, this location should be readable and writable by  both  systems.   Since
              all  running  and  pending job information is stored here, the use of a reliable file system (e.g.
              RAID) is recommended.  The  default  value  is  "<a href="file:/var/spool">/var/spool</a>".   If  any  slurm  daemons  terminate
              abnormally, their core files will also be written into this directory.

       <b>SuspendExcNodes</b>
              Specifies  the  nodes which are to not be placed in power save mode, even if the node remains idle
              for an extended period of time.  Use Slurm's hostlist expression or  NodeSets  to  identify  nodes
              with  an  optional  ":"  separator  and  count  of nodes to exclude from the preceding range.  For
              example "nid[10-20]:4" will prevent 4 powered up nodes in the set "nid[10-20]" from being  powered
              down.   Multiple  sets  of nodes can be specified with or without counts in a comma separated list
              (e.g "nid[10-20]:4,nid[80-90]:2").  By default no nodes are excluded.  This value may  be  updated
              with scontrol.  See <b>ReconfigFlags=KeepPowerSaveSettings</b> for setting persistence.

       <b>SuspendExcParts</b>
              Specifies  the  partitions  whose  nodes are to not be placed in power save mode, even if the node
              remains idle for an extended period of time.  Multiple partitions can be identified and  separated
              by  commas.   By  default  no  nodes  are excluded.  This value may be updated with scontrol.  See
              <b>ReconfigFlags=KeepPowerSaveSettings</b> for setting persistence.

       <b>SuspendExcStates</b>
              Specifies node states that are not to be powered down automatically.  Valid states include  CLOUD,
              DOWN,   DRAIN,  DYNAMIC_FUTURE,  DYNAMIC_NORM,  FAIL,  INVALID_REG,  MAINTENANCE,  NOT_RESPONDING,
              PERFCTRS, PLANNED, and RESERVED.  By default, any of these states, if idle for <b>SuspendTime</b>,  would
              be     powered     down.      This     value     may    be    updated    with    scontrol.     See
              <b>ReconfigFlags=KeepPowerSaveSettings</b> for setting persistence.

       <b>SuspendProgram</b>
              <b>SuspendProgram</b> is the program that will be executed when a  node  remains  idle  for  an  extended
              period  of  time.  This program is expected to place the node into some power save mode.  This can
              be used to reduce the frequency and voltage of a node or  completely  power  the  node  off.   The
              program  executes  as  <b>SlurmUser</b>.   The  argument  to the program will be the names of nodes to be
              placed into power savings mode (using Slurm's hostlist expression format).  By default, no program
              is run.  Programs will be killed if they  run  longer  than  the  largest  configured,  global  or
              partition, <b>ResumeTimeout</b> or <b>SuspendTimeout</b>.

       <b>SuspendRate</b>
              The rate at which nodes are placed into power save mode by <b>SuspendProgram</b>.  The value is number of
              nodes  per  minute  and  it can be used to prevent a large drop in power consumption (e.g. after a
              large job completes).  A value of zero results in no limits being imposed.  The default  value  is
              60 nodes per minute.

       <b>SuspendTime</b>
              Nodes  which remain idle or down for this number of seconds will be placed into power save mode by
              <b>SuspendProgram</b>.  Setting <b>SuspendTime</b> to anything but INFINITE (or -1) will enable power save mode.
              INFINITE is the default.

       <b>SuspendTimeout</b>
              Maximum time permitted (in seconds) between when a node suspend request is  issued  and  when  the
              node is shutdown.  At that time the node must be ready for a resume request to be issued as needed
              for new work.  The default value is 30 seconds.

       <b>SwitchParameters</b>
              Optional parameters for the switch plugin.

              On HPE Slingshot systems configured with <b>SwitchType=switch/hpe_slingshot</b>, the following parameters
              are supported (separate multiple parameters with a comma):

              <b>vnis</b>=&lt;<u>min</u>&gt;-&lt;<u>max</u>&gt;
                     Range of VNIs to allocate for jobs and applications.  This parameter is required.

              <b>destroy_retries</b>=&lt;<u>retry</u> <u>attempts</u>&gt;
                     Configure  the  number  of times destroying CXI services is retried at the end of the step.
                     There is a one second pause between each retry.  The default value is 5.

              <b>tcs</b>=&lt;<u>class1</u>&gt;[:&lt;<u>class2</u>&gt;]...
                     Set of traffic classes to  configure  for  applications.   Supported  traffic  classes  are
                     DEDICATED_ACCESS,  LOW_LATENCY, BULK_DATA, and BEST_EFFORT. The traffic classes may also be
                     specified as TC_DEDICATED_ACCESS, TC_LOW_LATENCY, TC_BULK_DATA, and TC_BEST_EFFORT.

              <b>single_node_vni</b>=&lt;<u>all</u>|<u>user</u>|<u>none</u>&gt;
                     If set to 'all', allocate a VNI for all job steps (by default, no VNI will be allocated for
                     single-node job steps).  If set to 'user', allocate a VNI for single-node job  steps  using
                     the  <b>srun</b>  <b>--network=single_node_vni</b>  option  or  <b>SLURM_NETWORK=single_node_vni</b> environment
                     variable.  If set to 'none' (or if <b>single_node_vni</b> is not set), do not allocate any VNI for
                     single-node job steps.   For  backwards  compatibility,  setting  <b>single_node_vni</b>  with  no
                     argument is equivalent to 'all'.

              <b>job_vni</b>=&lt;<u>all</u>|<u>user</u>|<u>none</u>&gt;
                     If  set  to 'all', allocate an additional VNI for jobs, shared among all job steps.  If set
                     to 'user', allocate an additional VNI for any job using the <b>srun</b>  <b>--network=job_vni</b>  option
                     or  <b>SLURM_NETWORK=job_vni</b>  environment  variable.   If  set to 'none' (or if <b>job_vni</b> is not
                     set), do not allocate any additional VNI for jobs.  For  backwards  compatibility,  setting
                     <b>job_vni</b> with no argument is equivalent to 'all'.

              <b>adjust_limits</b>
                     If  set, slurmd will set an upper bound on network resource reservations by taking the per-
                     NIC maximum resource quantity and subtracting the reserved or  used  values  (whichever  is
                     higher) for any system network services; this is the default.

              <b>no_adjust_limits</b>
                     If  set,  slurmd  will  calculate  network  resource  reservations based only upon the per-
                     resource configuration default and number of tasks in the application; it will not  set  an
                     upper  bound  on  those  reservation  requests  based on resource usage of already-existing
                     system network services.  Setting this will mean more application launches could fail based
                     on network resource exhaustion, but if the application absolutely needs a certain amount of
                     resources to function, this option will ensure that.

              <b>hwcoll_addrs_per_job</b>
                     The number of Slingshot hardware collectives multicast addresses to allocate per job. (That
                     are larger than hwcoll_min_nodes nodes)

              <b>hwcoll_num_nodes</b>
                     The minimum number of nodes for a job  to  be  allocated  Slingshot  hardware  collectives.
                     Because  the  hardware  collective engine is not expected to offer a meaningful performance
                     boost for jobs spanning a small number of nodes.

              <b>fm_url</b> If set, slurm will use the configured URL to interface with the fabric  manager  to  enable
                     Slingshot  hardware  collectives.   Note  <b>enable_stepmgr</b>  needs  to  be  set  for  hardware
                     collectives to run.

              <b>fm_auth</b>
                     HPE fabric manager REST API authentication type (BASIC or OAUTH, default OAUTH).

              <b>fm_authdir</b>
                     Directory  containing   authentication   info   files   (default   /etc/fmsim   for   BASIC
                     authentication, /etc/wlm-client-auth for OAUTH authentication).

              <b>def_&lt;rsrc&gt;</b>=&lt;<u>val</u>&gt;
                     Per-CPU reserved allocation for this resource.

              <b>res_&lt;rsrc&gt;</b>=&lt;<u>val</u>&gt;
                     Per-node reserved allocation for this resource.  If set, overrides the per-CPU allocation.

              <b>max_&lt;rsrc&gt;</b>=&lt;<u>val</u>&gt;
                     Maximum per-node application for this resource.

       The resources that may be configured are:

              <b>txqs</b>   Transmit command queues. The default is 2 per-CPU, maximum 1024 per-node.

              <b>tgqs</b>   Target command queues. The default is 1 per-CPU, maximum 512 per-node.

              <b>eqs</b>    Event queues. The default is 2 per-CPU, maximum 2047 per-node.

              <b>cts</b>    Counters. The default is 1 per-CPU, maximum 2047 per-node.

              <b>tles</b>   Trigger list entries. The default is 1 per-CPU, maximum 2048 per-node.

              <b>ptes</b>   Portable table entries. The default is 6 per-CPU, maximum 2048 per-node.

              <b>les</b>    List entries. The default is 16 per-CPU, maximum 16384 per-node.

              <b>acs</b>    Addressing contexts. The default is 4 per-CPU, maximum 1022 per-node.

       On systems configured with <b>SwitchType=switch/nvidia_imex</b>, the following parameters are supported:

              <b>imex_channel_count</b>
                     Number  of  channels that can be configured. Channels allow nodes to create a secure method
                     of sharing memory. The default value is 2048.

                     <b>NOTE</b>: The batch and interactive steps will not have imex channels created since they run on
                     a single node. Once you start creating job steps that span nodes you will see the  channels
                     created.

       <b>SwitchType</b>
              Identifies  the  type  of switch or interconnect used for application communications.  The default
              value is no special plugin requiring special processing for job launch or  termination  (Ethernet,
              and  InfiniBand).   All Slurm daemons, commands and running jobs must be restarted or reconfigured
              for a change in <b>SwitchType</b> to take effect.  If  running  jobs  exist  at  the  time  <b>slurmctld</b>  is
              restarted  with  a  new  value  of  <b>SwitchType</b>,  records  of  all  jobs  in any state may be lost.
              Acceptable values include:

              <b>switch/hpe_slingshot</b>
                             For HPE Slingshot systems.

              <b>switch/nvidia_imex</b>
                             For allocating unique channels within an NVIDIA IMEX domain.

       <b>TaskEpilog</b>
              Fully qualified pathname of a program to be executed as the slurm job's owner after termination of
              each task.  See <b>TaskProlog</b> for execution order details.

       <b>TaskPlugin</b>
              Identifies the type of task launch plugin, typically used to provide resource management within  a
              node  (e.g. pinning tasks to specific processors). More than one task plugin can be specified in a
              comma-separated list. The prefix of "task/" is optional.  Unset  by  default.   Acceptable  values
              include:

              <b>task/affinity</b>  binds processes to specified resources using sched_setaffinity().  This enables the
                             --cpu-bind and/or --mem-bind srun options.

              <b>task/cgroup</b>    enables  process containment to specified resources using Cgroups cpuset interface.
                             This enables the  --cpu-bind  and/or  --mem-bind  srun  options.   <b>NOTE</b>:  see  "man
                             cgroup.conf" for configuration details.

              <b>NOTE</b>:  It  is recommended to stack <b>task/cgroup,task/affinity</b> together when configuring TaskPlugin,
              and setting <b>ConstrainCores=yes</b> in <b>cgroup.conf</b>.  This  setup  uses  the  task/affinity  plugin  for
              setting  the  cpu mask for tasks and uses the task/cgroup plugin to fence tasks into the allocated
              cpus.

       <b>TaskPluginParam</b>
              Optional parameters for the task plugin.  Multiple  options  should  be  comma  separated.   <b>None</b>,
              <b>Sockets</b>,  <b>Cores</b>  and  <b>Threads</b>  are  mutually  exclusive  and  treated as a last possible source of
              --cpu-bind default. See also Node and Partition CpuBind options.

              <b>Cores</b>  Bind tasks to cores by default.  Overrides automatic binding.

              <b>None</b>   Perform no task binding by default.  Overrides automatic binding.

              <b>Sockets</b>
                     Bind to sockets by default.  Overrides automatic binding.

              <b>Threads</b>
                     Bind to threads by default.  Overrides automatic binding.

              <b>SlurmdOffSpec</b>
                     If specialized cores or CPUs are  identified  for  the  node  (i.e.  the  <b>CoreSpecCount</b>  or
                     <b>CpuSpecList</b>  are  configured  for the node), then Slurm daemons running on the compute node
                     (i.e. slurmd and slurmstepd) should  run  outside  of  those  resources  (i.e.  specialized
                     resources are completely unavailable to Slurm daemons and jobs spawned by Slurm).

              <b>OOMKillStep</b>
                     Set  this  parameter  to  kill  the  whole  step  in  all the nodes in case an OOM event is
                     triggered in any task of the step.

                     This applies to entire allocations but does not apply to the  external  step.   It  can  be
                     overwritten by the user.

                     <b>NOTE</b>:  This  parameter requires the <b>task/cgroup</b> plugin, Cgroups v2, and a kernel newer than
                     4.19.

              <b>Verbose</b>
                     Verbosely report binding before tasks run by default.

              <b>Autobind</b>
                     Set a default binding in the event that "auto  binding"  doesn't  find  a  match.   Set  to
                     Threads, Cores or Sockets (E.g. TaskPluginParam=autobind=threads).

       <b>TaskProlog</b>
              Fully  qualified pathname of a program to be executed as the slurm job's owner prior to initiation
              of each task.  Besides the normal environment variables,  this  has  SLURM_TASK_PID  available  to
              identify  the process ID of the task being started.  Standard output from this program can be used
              to control the environment variables and output for the user program.

              <b>export</b> <b>NAME=value</b>   Will set environment variables for the task being spawned.   Everything  after
                                  the  equal  sign  to  the  end  of  the line will be used as the value for the
                                  environment variable.  Exporting of functions is not currently supported.

              <b>print</b> <b>...</b>           Will cause that line (without the leading "print ") to be printed to the job's
                                  standard output.

              <b>unset</b> <b>NAME</b>          Will clear environment variables for the task being spawned.

              The order of task prolog/epilog execution is as follows:

              <b>1.</b> <b>pre_launch_priv()</b>

       <b>TCPTimeout</b>
              Time permitted for TCP connection to be established. Default value is 2 seconds.

       <b>TmpFS</b>  Fully qualified pathname of the file system available to user jobs  for  temporary  storage.  This
              parameter is used in establishing a node's <b>TmpDisk</b> space.  The default value is "<a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>".

       <b>TopologyParam</b>
              Comma-separated options identifying network topology options.

              <b>Dragonfly</b>        Optimize      allocation      for      Dragonfly     network.      Valid     when
                               TopologyPlugin=topology/tree.

              <b>RoutePart</b>        Instead of using the plugin's default route calculation, use partition node lists
                               to  route  communications  from  the  controller.  Once  on  the  compute   node,
                               communications  will  be  routed  using  the requested plugin's normal algorithm,
                               following TreeWidth if applicable. If a node is in multiple partitions, the first
                               partition seen will be used. The controller will communicate  directly  with  any
                               nodes that aren't in a partition.

              <b>SwitchAsNodeRank</b> Assign the same node rank to all nodes under one leaf switch.  This can be useful
                               if the naming convention for the nodes does not match the network topology.

              <b>RouteTree</b>        Use  the  switch hierarchy defined in a <u>topology.conf</u> file for routing instead of
                               just scheduling.  Valid  when  TopologyPlugin=topology/tree.   Incompatible  with
                               dynamic nodes.

              <b>TopoMaxSizeUnroll</b>=Maximum number of individual job sizes automatically unrolled
                               from min-max nodes job specification.  Default: -1 (option disabled).  Valid when
                               TopologyPlugin=topology/block.

              <b>TopoOptional</b>     Only  optimize  allocation  for  network  topology  if  the job includes a switch
                               option. Since optimizing resource allocation for topology  involves  much  higher
                               system  overhead,  this  option  can be used to impose the extra overhead only on
                               jobs which can take advantage of it. If most job allocations  are  not  optimized
                               for  network  topology,  they  may  fragment resources to the point that topology
                               optimization for other jobs will be difficult to achieve.  <b>NOTE</b>:  Jobs  may  span
                               across nodes without common parent switches with this enabled.

       <b>TopologyPlugin</b>
              Identifies  the  plugin  to  be  used  for  determining  the  network  topology and optimizing job
              allocations to minimize network contention.  See <b>NETWORK</b> <b>TOPOLOGY</b> below for  details.   Additional
              plugins may be provided in the future which gather topology information directly from the network.
              Acceptable values include:

              <b>topology/3d_torus</b>    best-fit logic over three-dimensional topology

              <b>topology/block</b>       used  for  a block network topology, as described in the <b><a href="../man5/topology.conf.5.html">topology.conf</a></b>(5) man
                                   page

              <b>topology/default</b>     default for other systems, best-fit logic over one-dimensional topology

              <b>topology/tree</b>        used  for  a  hierarchical  network  with  the  select/cons_tres  plugin,  as
                                   described in the <b><a href="../man5/topology.conf.5.html">topology.conf</a></b>(5) man page

       <b>TrackWCKey</b>
              Boolean yes or no. Used to set display and track of the Workload Characterization Key. Must be set
              to  track  correct  wckey usage.  <b>NOTE</b>: You must also set TrackWCKey in your slurmdbd.conf file to
              create historical usage reports.

       <b>TreeWidth</b>
              <b>Slurmd</b> daemons use a virtual tree network for communications.  <b>TreeWidth</b> specifies  the  width  of
              the tree (i.e. the fanout).  On architectures with a front end node running the slurmd daemon, the
              value  must  always be equal to or greater than the number of front end nodes which eliminates the
              need for message forwarding between the slurmd daemons.  On other architectures the default  value
              is  16,  meaning each slurmd daemon can communicate with up to 16 other slurmd daemons. This value
              balances offloading slurmctld (max 16 threads running), time  of  communication,  and  node  fault
              tolerance  (4368 nodes can be contacted with three message hops). The default value will work well
              for most clusters however on bigger systems this value can be increased to avoid long timeouts and
              retransmissions in case of unresponsive nodes. The value may not exceed 65533.

       <b>UnkillableStepProgram</b>
              If the processes in a job step are determined to be unkillable for a period of time  specified  by
              the  <b>UnkillableStepTimeout</b>  variable,  the  program  specified  by  <b>UnkillableStepProgram</b>  will be
              executed.  By default no program is run.

              See section <b>UNKILLABLE</b> <b>STEP</b> <b>PROGRAM</b> <b>SCRIPT</b> for more information.

       <b>UnkillableStepTimeout</b>
              The length of time, in seconds, that Slurm will wait before deciding that processes in a job  step
              are  unkillable  (after  they  have been signaled with SIGKILL) and execute <b>UnkillableStepProgram</b>.
              The default timeout value is 60 seconds or five times the value of  MessageTimeout,  whichever  is
              greater.   If  exceeded,  the  compute  node  will  be  drained  to prevent future jobs from being
              scheduled on the node.

              <b>NOTE</b>: Ensure that UnkillableStepTimeout is at least 5 times larger than MessageTimeout,  otherwise
              it can lead to unexpected draining of nodes.

       <b>UsePAM</b> If  set  to  1,  PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux) will be enabled.  PAM is used to
              establish  the  upper  bounds  for  resource  limits.  With  PAM  support  enabled,  local  system
              administrators  can  dynamically  configure  system resource limits. Changing the upper bound of a
              resource limit will not alter the limits of running jobs, only jobs started  after  a  change  has
              been  made  will  pick  up  the  new  limits.  The default value is 0 (not to enable PAM support).
              Remember that PAM also needs to be configured to support Slurm as  a  service.   For  sites  using
              PAM's  directory  based  configuration option, a configuration file named <b>slurm</b> should be created.
              The module-type, control-flags, and module-path names that should be included in the file are:
              auth        required      pam_localuser.so
              auth        required      pam_shells.so
              account     required      pam_unix.so
              account     required      pam_access.so
              session     required      pam_unix.so
              For sites configuring PAM with a general configuration file, the appropriate  lines  (see  above),
              where       <b>slurm</b>       is       the       service-name,      should      be      added.       See
              &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/pam_slurm_adopt.html&gt; for more details.

              <b>NOTE</b>:   UsePAM   option   has   nothing   to   do   with   the    <b>contribs/pam/pam_slurm</b>    and/or
              <b>contribs/pam_slurm_adopt</b> modules. So these two modules can work independently of the value set for
              UsePAM.

       <b>VSizeFactor</b>
              Memory specifications in job requests apply to real memory size (also known as resident set size).
              It  is  possible  to  enforce  virtual memory limits for both jobs and job steps by limiting their
              virtual memory to some percentage of their  real  memory  allocation.  The  <b>VSizeFactor</b>  parameter
              specifies  the  job's or job step's virtual memory limit as a percentage of its real memory limit.
              For example, if a job's real memory limit is 500MB and VSizeFactor is set to 101 then the job will
              be killed if its real memory exceeds 500MB or its virtual memory exceeds 505MB (101 percent of the
              real memory limit).  The default value is 0, which disables enforcement of virtual memory  limits.
              The value may not exceed 65533 percent.

              <b>NOTE</b>: This parameter is dependent on <b>OverMemoryKill</b> being configured in <b>JobAcctGatherParams</b>. It is
              also  possible  to configure the <b>TaskPlugin</b> to use <b>task/cgroup</b> for memory enforcement. <b>VSizeFactor</b>
              will not have an effect on memory enforcement done through cgroups.

       <b>WaitTime</b>
              Specifies how many seconds the srun command should by default wait after the first task terminates
              before terminating all remaining tasks. The "--wait" option on the  srun  command  line  overrides
              this value.  The default value is 0, which disables this feature.  May not exceed 65533 seconds.

       <b>X11Parameters</b>
              For use with Slurm's built-in X11 forwarding implementation.

              <b>home_xauthority</b>
                      If  set,  xauth  data on the compute node will be placed in <b><a href="file:~/.Xauthority">~/.Xauthority</a></b> rather than in a
                      temporary file under <b>TmpFS</b>.

</pre><h4><b>NODE</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration of nodes (or machines) to be managed by Slurm is  also  specified  in  <b>/etc/slurm.conf</b>.
       Changes  in  node  configuration  (e.g.  adding  nodes,  changing  their  processor  count, etc.) require
       restarting or reconfiguring all slurmctld and slurmd daemons.  All slurmd daemons must know each node  in
       the  system  to  forward  messages  in support of hierarchical communications.  Only the NodeName must be
       supplied in the configuration file.  All  other  node  configuration  information  is  optional.   It  is
       advisable  to  establish baseline node configurations, especially if the cluster is heterogeneous.  Nodes
       which register to the system with less than the configured resources (e.g. too little  memory),  will  be
       placed  in  the "DOWN" state to avoid scheduling jobs on them.  Establishing baseline configurations will
       also speed Slurm's scheduling process  by  permitting  it  to  compare  job  requirements  against  these
       (relatively  few)  configuration  parameters  and possibly avoid having to check job requirements against
       every individual node's configuration.  The resources  checked  at  node  registration  time  are:  CPUs,
       RealMemory and TmpDisk.

       Default  values  can be specified with a record in which <b>NodeName</b> is "DEFAULT".  The default entry values
       will apply only to lines following it in the configuration file and  the  default  values  can  be  reset
       multiple times in the configuration file with multiple entries where "NodeName=DEFAULT".  Each line where
       <b>NodeName</b>  is  "DEFAULT"  will  replace  or  add  to previous default values and will not reinitialize the
       default values.  The "NodeName=" specification must be placed on every line describing the  configuration
       of  nodes.   A  single node name can not appear as a NodeName value in more than one line (duplicate node
       name records will be  ignored).   In  fact,  it  is  generally  possible  and  desirable  to  define  the
       configurations of all nodes in only a few lines.  This convention permits significant optimization in the
       scheduling  of  larger  clusters.  In order to support the concept of jobs requiring consecutive nodes on
       some architectures, node specifications should be place in this file in  consecutive  order.   No  single
       node  name  may be listed more than once in the configuration file.  Use "DownNodes=" to record the state
       of nodes which are temporarily in a DOWN, DRAIN or FAILING state without altering permanent configuration
       information.  A job step's tasks are allocated to nodes in order the nodes appear  in  the  configuration
       file. There is presently no capability within Slurm to arbitrarily order a job step's tasks.

       Multiple  node  names  may  be  comma  separated  (e.g.  "alpha,beta,gamma")  and/or  a simple node range
       expression may optionally be used to specify numeric ranges of nodes to avoid  building  a  configuration
       file  with  large  numbers of entries.  The node range expression can contain one pair of square brackets
       with a  sequence  of  comma-separated  numbers  and/or  ranges  of  numbers  separated  by  a  "-"  (e.g.
       "linux[0-64,128]",  or  "lx[15,18,32-33]").  Note that the numeric ranges can include one or more leading
       zeros to indicate the numeric portion has a fixed number of digits (e.g.  "linux[0000-1023]").   Multiple
       numeric ranges can be included in the expression (e.g. "rack[0-63]_blade[0-41]").  If one or more numeric
       expressions  are included, one of them must be at the end of the name (e.g. "unit[0-31]rack" is invalid),
       but arbitrary names can always be used in a comma-separated list.

       The node configuration specified the following information:

       <b>NodeName</b>
              Name that Slurm uses to refer to a node.  Typically this would be the string  that  "<a href="file:/bin/hostname">/bin/hostname</a>
              -s"  returns.   It  may  also be the fully qualified domain name as returned by "<a href="file:/bin/hostname">/bin/hostname</a> -f"
              (e.g. "foo1.bar.com"), or any valid domain name associated with the host through the host database
              (<a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>) or DNS, depending on the resolver settings. Note  that  if  the  short  form  of  the
              hostname  is not used, it may prevent use of hostlist expressions (the numeric portion in brackets
              must be at the end of the string).  It  may  also  be  an  arbitrary  string  if  <b>NodeHostname</b>  is
              specified.   If  the  <b>NodeName</b>  is  "DEFAULT", the values specified with that record will apply to
              subsequent node specifications unless explicitly set to  other  values  in  that  node  record  or
              replaced  with  a  different  set  of  default values.  Each line where <b>NodeName</b> is "DEFAULT" will
              replace or add  to  previous  default  values  and  not  reinitialize  the  default  values.   For
              architectures  in which the node order is significant, nodes will be considered consecutive in the
              order defined.  For example, if the configuration for "NodeName=charlie" immediately  follows  the
              configuration for "NodeName=baker" they will be considered adjacent in the computer.  <b>NOTE</b>: If the
              <b>NodeName</b>  is  "ALL"  the  process  parsing  the  configuration  will  exit immediately as it is an
              internally reserved word.

       <b>NodeHostname</b>
              Typically this would be the string that "<a href="file:/bin/hostname">/bin/hostname</a> -s" returns.  It  may  also  be  the  fully
              qualified domain name as returned by "<a href="file:/bin/hostname">/bin/hostname</a> -f" (e.g. "foo1.bar.com"), or any valid domain
              name  associated  with  the  host  through the host database (<a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>) or DNS, depending on the
              resolver settings. Note that if the short form of the hostname is not used, it may prevent use  of
              hostlist  expressions  (the numeric portion in brackets must be at the end of the string).  A node
              range expression can be used to specify a set of nodes.  If an expression is used, the  number  of
              nodes  identified  by  <b>NodeHostname</b>  on  a line in the configuration file must be identical to the
              number of nodes identified by <b>NodeName</b>.  By default, the <b>NodeHostname</b> will be identical  in  value
              to <b>NodeName</b>.

       <b>NodeAddr</b>
              Name  that  a node should be referred to in establishing a communications path.  This name will be
              used as an argument to the getaddrinfo() function for identification.  If a node range  expression
              is  used  to  designate  multiple nodes, they must exactly match the entries in the <b>NodeName</b> (e.g.
              "NodeName=lx[0-7] NodeAddr=elx[0-7]").  <b>NodeAddr</b> may also contain IP addresses.  By  default,  the
              <b>NodeAddr</b> will be identical in value to <b>NodeHostname</b>.

       <b>BcastAddr</b>
              Alternate  network  path to be used for sbcast network traffic to a given node.  This name will be
              used as an argument to the getaddrinfo()  function.   If  a  node  range  expression  is  used  to
              designate   multiple   nodes,   they  must  exactly  match  the  entries  in  the  <b>NodeName</b>  (e.g.
              "NodeName=lx[0-7] BcastAddr=elx[0-7]").  <b>BcastAddr</b> may also contain IP addresses.  By default, the
              <b>BcastAddr</b> is unset, and sbcast traffic will be routed to the <b>NodeAddr</b> for  a  given  node.   Note:
              cannot be used with CommunicationParameters=NoInAddrAny.

       <b>Boards</b> Number  of  Baseboards  in nodes with a baseboard controller.  Note that when Boards is specified,
              SocketsPerBoard, CoresPerSocket, and ThreadsPerCore should be specified.  The default value is 1.

       <b>CoreSpecCount</b>
              Number  of  cores  reserved  for  system  use.   Depending  upon  the  <b>TaskPluginParam</b>  option  of
              <b>SlurmdOffSpec</b>,  the Slurm daemon slurmd may either be confined to these resources (the default) or
              prevented from using these resources.  If cgroup/v1 is used, the same applies  to  the  slurmstepd
              processes.  Isolation of slurmd from user jobs may improve application performance.  A job can use
              these  cores  if  AllowSpecResourcesUsage=yes  and  the  user  explicitly  requests  less than the
              configured CoreSpecCount.  If this option and <b>CpuSpecList</b> are both designated for a node, an error
              is generated. For information on the algorithm used by Slurm to select the cores refer to the core
              specialization documentation ( https://slurm.schedmd.com/core_spec.html ).

       <b>CoresPerSocket</b>
              Number of cores in a single physical  processor  socket  (e.g.  "2").   The  CoresPerSocket  value
              describes  physical  cores,  not  the  logical number of processors per socket.  <b>NOTE</b>: If you have
              multi-core processors, you will likely need  to  specify  this  parameter  in  order  to  optimize
              scheduling.  The default value is 1.

       <b>CpuBind</b>
              If  a job step request does not specify an option to control how tasks are bound to allocated CPUs
              (by using --cpu-bind) and all nodes allocated to the job have the same <b>CpuBind</b>  option,  the  node
              <b>CpuBind</b>  option will control how tasks are bound to allocated resources. Partition definitions are
              used next if the node definition(s) can't be used, followed by <b>TaskPluginParam</b> as a  last  resort,
              with  the  default  being  no binding. Supported values for CpuBind are <b>none</b>, <b>socket</b>, <b>ldom</b> (NUMA),
              <b>core</b> and <b>thread</b>.

       <b>CPUs</b>   Number of logical processors on the node (e.g. "2").  It  can  be  set  to  the  total  number  of
              sockets(supported  only  by select/linear), cores or threads.  This can be useful when you want to
              schedule only the cores on a hyper-threaded node. If <b>CPUs</b> is omitted,  its  default  will  be  set
              equal to the product of <b>Boards</b>, <b>Sockets</b>, <b>CoresPerSocket</b>, and <b>ThreadsPerCore</b>.

       <b>CpuSpecList</b>
              A  comma-delimited  list  of  Slurm  abstract  CPU  IDs reserved for system use.  The list will be
              expanded to include all other CPUs, if any, on the same cores.  Depending upon the <b>TaskPluginParam</b>
              option of <b>SlurmdOffSpec</b>, the Slurm daemon slurmd may either be confined to  these  resources  (the
              default)  or  prevented from using these resources.  If cgroup/v1 is used, the same applies to the
              slurmstepd processes.  Isolation of slurmd from user jobs may improve application performance.   A
              job  can use these cores if AllowSpecResourcesUsage=yes and the user explicitly requests less than
              the number of CPUs in this list.  If this option and <b>CoreSpecCount</b> are both designated for a node,
              an error is generated.  This option has no effect unless cgroup job confinement is also configured
              (i.e. the <u>task/cgroup</u> <b>TaskPlugin</b> is enabled and <b>ConstrainCores=yes</b> is set in cgroup.conf).

       <b>Features</b>
              A comma-delimited list of arbitrary strings indicative of some characteristic associated with  the
              node.   There  is  no  value  or count associated with a feature at this time, a node either has a
              feature or it does not.  A desired  feature  may  contain  a  numeric  component  indicating,  for
              example,  processor  speed but this numeric component will be considered to be part of the feature
              string. Features are intended to be used to filter nodes eligible to run jobs via the <b>--constraint</b>
              argument.  By default a node has no features.  Also see <b>Gres</b> for being able to have  more  control
              such  as  types and count. Using features is faster than scheduling against GRES but is limited to
              Boolean operations.

              <b>NOTE</b>: The hostlist function <b>feature{myfeature}</b> expands to all nodes with  the  specified  feature.
              This  may  be  used  in  place  of  or  alongside  regular  hostlist  expressions  in  commands or
              configuration  files  that  interact  with  the   slurmctld.    For   example:   <b>scontrol</b>   <b>update</b>
              <b>node=feature{myfeature}</b> <b>state=resume</b> or <b>PartitionName=p1</b> <b>Nodes=feature{myfeature}</b>.

       <b>Gres</b>   A  comma-delimited  list  of  generic  resources  specifications  for  a  node.   The  format  is:
              "&lt;name&gt;[:&lt;type&gt;][:no_consume]:&lt;number&gt;[K|M|G]".  The first  field  is  the  resource  name,  which
              matches  the  GresType  configuration  parameter  name.   The optional type field might be used to
              identify a model of that generic resource.  It is forbidden to specify both an untyped GRES and  a
              typed  GRES  with  the  same  &lt;name&gt;.   The optional no_consume field allows you to specify that a
              generic resource does not have a finite number of that  resource  that  gets  consumed  as  it  is
              requested.  The no_consume field is a GRES specific setting and applies to the GRES, regardless of
              the type specified.  It should not be used with GRES  that  has  a  dedicated  plugin,  if  you're
              looking  for  a  way to overcommit GPUs to multiple processes at the time you may be interested in
              using "shard" GRES instead.  The final field must specify a generic resources count.  A suffix  of
              "K",  "M",  "G",  "T" or "P" may be used to multiply the number by 1024, 1048576, 1073741824, etc.
              respectively.  (e.g."Gres=gpu:tesla:1,gpu:kepler:1,bandwidth:lustre:no_consume:4G").  By default a
              node has no generic resources and its maximum count is that of an unsigned  64bit  integer.   Also
              see <b>Features</b> for Boolean flags to filter nodes using job constraints.

       <b>MemSpecLimit</b>
              Amount  of  <b>RealMemory</b>,  in  megabytes,  reserved  for  system  use  and  not  available  for user
              allocations. Must be less than the amount defined for <b>RealMemory</b>.  If the  task/cgroup  plugin  is
              configured  and  that  plugin  constrains  memory  allocations (i.e. the <u>task/cgroup</u> <b>TaskPlugin</b> is
              enabled and <b>ConstrainRAMSpace=yes</b> is set in cgroup.conf), then the slurmd will  be  allocated  the
              specified  memory  limit. If cgroup/v1 is used the slurmstepd will also be allocated the specified
              memory limit. If cgroup/v2 is used, the slurmstepd's consumption is completely  dependent  on  the
              topology  of  the  job.   Note  that  having  the Memory set in <b>SelectTypeParameters</b> as any of the
              options that has it as a consumable resource is needed for this option to work.  The daemons  will
              not be killed if they exhaust the memory allocation (i.e. the Out-Of-Memory Killer is disabled for
              the  daemon's  memory  cgroup).  If the task/cgroup plugin is not configured, the specified memory
              will only be unavailable for user allocations.

       <b>Port</b>   The port number that the Slurm compute node daemon, <b>slurmd</b>, listens to for work on this particular
              node. By default there is a single port number for all <b>slurmd</b> daemons  on  all  compute  nodes  as
              defined by the <b>SlurmdPort</b> configuration parameter. Use of this option is not generally recommended
              except  for development or testing purposes. If multiple <b>slurmd</b> daemons execute on a node this can
              specify a range of ports.

              <b>NOTE</b>: On Cray systems, Realm-Specific IP Addressing (RSIP) will automatically try to interact with
              anything opened on ports 8192-60000.  Configure Port to use  a  port  outside  of  the  configured
              SrunPortRange and RSIP's port range.

       <b>Procs</b>  See <b>CPUs</b>.

       <b>RealMemory</b>
              Size  of  real  memory  on  the node in megabytes (e.g. "2048").  The default value is 1. Lowering
              RealMemory with the goal of setting aside some amount  for  the  OS  and  not  available  for  job
              allocations  will  not  work  as  intended  if  Memory  is  not  set  as  a consumable resource in
              <b>SelectTypeParameters</b>. So one of the *_Memory options need to  be  enabled  for  that  goal  to  be
              accomplished.  Also see <b>MemSpecLimit</b>.

       <b>Reason</b> Identifies the reason for a node being in state "DOWN", "DRAINED" "DRAINING", "FAIL" or "FAILING".
              Use quotes to enclose a reason having more than one word.

       <b>RestrictedCoresPerGPU</b>
              Number  of  cores per GPU restricted for only GPU use. If a job does not request a GPU it will not
              have access to these cores.

              <b>NOTE</b>: Configuring multiple GPU types on overlapping sockets can result in erroneous GPU  type  and
              restricted core pairings in allocations requesting gpus without specifying a type.

       <b>Sockets</b>
              Number of physical processor sockets/chips on the node (e.g. "2").  If Sockets is omitted, it will
              be  inferred  from  <b>CPUs</b>,  <b>CoresPerSocket</b>,  and  <b>ThreadsPerCore</b>.   <b>NOTE</b>:  If  you  have multi-core
              processors, you will likely need to specify these parameters.   Sockets  and  SocketsPerBoard  are
              mutually  exclusive.   If Sockets is specified when Boards is also used, Sockets is interpreted as
              SocketsPerBoard rather than total sockets.  The default value is 1.

       <b>SocketsPerBoard</b>
              Number of physical processor sockets/chips  on  a  baseboard.   Sockets  and  SocketsPerBoard  are
              mutually exclusive.  The default value is 1.

       <b>State</b>  State of the node with respect to the initiation of user jobs.  Acceptable values are <u>CLOUD</u>, <u>DOWN</u>,
              <u>DRAIN</u>, <u>FAIL</u>, <u>FAILING</u>, <u>FUTURE</u> and <u>UNKNOWN</u>.  Node states of <u>BUSY</u> and <u>IDLE</u> should not be specified in
              the  node  configuration,  but  set  the node state to <u>UNKNOWN</u> instead.  Setting the node state to
              <u>UNKNOWN</u> will result in the node state being set to <u>BUSY</u>, <u>IDLE</u> or  other  appropriate  state  based
              upon  recovered  system  state information.  The default value is <u>UNKNOWN</u>.  Also see the <b>DownNodes</b>
              parameter below.

              <b>CLOUD</b>     Indicates the node exists in the cloud.  Its initial state will be  treated  as  powered
                        down.   The  node  will  be  available for use after its state is recovered from Slurm's
                        state save file or the slurmd daemon starts on the compute node.

              <b>DOWN</b>      Indicates the node failed and is unavailable to be allocated work.

              <b>DRAIN</b>     Indicates the node is unavailable to be allocated work.

              <b>FAIL</b>      Indicates the node is expected to fail soon, has no jobs allocated to it, and  will  not
                        be allocated to any new jobs.

              <b>FAILING</b>   Indicates  the  node is expected to fail soon, has one or more jobs allocated to it, but
                        will not be allocated to any new jobs.

              <b>FUTURE</b>    Indicates the node is defined for future use and need not exist when the  Slurm  daemons
                        are started. These nodes can be made available for use simply by updating the node state
                        using  the  scontrol  command  rather  than restarting the slurmctld daemon. After these
                        nodes are made available, change their State in the slurm.conf file. Until  these  nodes
                        are  made  available,  they  will  not  be seen using any Slurm commands or nor will any
                        attempt be made to contact them.

                        <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Future</b> <b>Nodes</b>
                               A <b>slurmd</b> started with -F[&lt;feature&gt;] will be associated with a  FUTURE  node  that
                               matches  the  same  configuration (sockets, cores, threads) as reported by <b>slurmd</b>
                               -C. The node's NodeAddr and NodeHostname will automatically be retrieved from the
                               <b>slurmd</b> and will be cleared when set back to the FUTURE state.

              <b>UNKNOWN</b>   Indicates the node's state is undefined but will be established (set to  <u>BUSY</u>  or  <u>IDLE</u>)
                        when the <b>slurmd</b> daemon on that node registers. <u>UNKNOWN</u> is the default state.

       <b>ThreadsPerCore</b>
              Number  of logical threads in a single physical core (e.g. "2").  Note that the Slurm can allocate
              resources to jobs down to the resolution of a core. If your system is configured  with  more  than
              one  thread  per  core,  execution  of  a different job on each thread is not supported unless you
              configure <b>SelectTypeParameters=CR_CPU</b> plus <b>CPUs</b>;  do  not  configure  <b>Sockets</b>,  <b>CoresPerSocket</b>  or
              <b>ThreadsPerCore</b>.   A  job  can  execute a one task per thread from within one job step or execute a
              distinct job step on each of the threads.  Note also if you are running with more  than  1  thread
              per   core   and   running   the   select/cons_tres   plugin   then  you  will  want  to  set  the
              SelectTypeParameters variable to something other than CR_CPU to  avoid  unexpected  results.   The
              default value is 1.

       <b>TmpDisk</b>
              Total  size  of temporary disk storage in <b>TmpFS</b> in megabytes (e.g. "16384"). <b>TmpFS</b> (for "Temporary
              File System") identifies the location which jobs should use for temporary storage.  Note this does
              not indicate the amount of free space available to the user on  the  node,  only  the  total  file
              system  size. The system administration should ensure this file system is purged as needed so that
              user jobs have access to most of this space.  The Prolog and/or Epilog programs (specified in  the
              configuration  file)  might be used to ensure the file system is kept clean.  The default value is
              0.

       <b>Weight</b> The priority of the node for scheduling purposes.  All things being equal, jobs will be  allocated
              the nodes with the lowest weight which satisfies their requirements.  For example, a heterogeneous
              collection  of  nodes  might  be  placed  into  a single partition for greater system utilization,
              responsiveness and capability. It would be preferable to allocate smaller memory nodes rather than
              larger memory nodes if either will  satisfy  a  job's  requirements.   The  units  of  weight  are
              arbitrary,  but  larger  weights  should  be  assigned to nodes with more processors, memory, disk
              space, higher processor speed, etc.  Note that if a job allocation request can  not  be  satisfied
              using  the  nodes with the lowest weight, the set of nodes with the next lowest weight is added to
              the set of nodes under consideration for use (repeat as needed for higher weight values).  If  you
              absolutely  want  to  minimize  the number of higher weight nodes allocated to a job (at a cost of
              higher scheduling overhead), give each node a distinct <b>Weight</b> value and they will be added to  the
              pool of nodes being considered for scheduling individually.

              The default value is 1.

              <b>NOTE</b>:  Node  weights  are  first  considered  among  currently  available  nodes.  For  example, a
              POWERED_DOWN node with a lower weight will not be evaluated before an IDLE node.

</pre><h4><b>DOWN</b> <b>NODE</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>DownNodes=</b> parameter permits you to mark certain nodes as in a <u>DOWN</u>, <u>DRAIN</u>, <u>FAIL</u>, <u>FAILING</u>  or  <u>FUTURE</u>
       state without altering the permanent configuration information listed under a <b>NodeName=</b> specification.

       <b>DownNodes</b>
              Any node name, or list of node names, from the <b>NodeName=</b> specifications.

       <b>Reason</b> Identifies  the reason for a node being in state <u>DOWN</u>, <u>DRAIN</u>, <u>FAIL</u>, <u>FAILING</u> or <u>FUTURE</u>.  Use quotes
              to enclose a reason having more than one word.

       <b>State</b>  State of the node with respect to the initiation of user jobs.  Acceptable values are <u>DOWN</u>, <u>DRAIN</u>,
              <u>FAIL</u>, <u>FAILING</u> and <u>FUTURE</u>.  For more information about these  states  see  the  descriptions  under
              <b>State</b> in the <b>NodeName=</b> section above.  The default value is <u>DOWN</u>.

</pre><h4><b>FRONTEND</b> <b>NODE</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       On  computers  where  frontend nodes are used to execute batch scripts rather than compute nodes, one may
       configure one or more frontend nodes using the configuration parameters defined below. These options  are
       very  similar  to  those  used  in  configuring  compute nodes. These options may only be used on systems
       configured and built with the appropriate parameters (--enable-front-end).  The front  end  configuration
       specifies the following information:

       <b>AllowGroups</b>
              Comma-separated list of group names which may execute jobs on this front end node. By default, all
              groups  may  use  this  front  end  node.   A user will be permitted to use this front end node if
              AllowGroups has <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> group associated with the user.  May not be used with the  <b>DenyGroups</b>
              option.

       <b>AllowUsers</b>
              Comma-separated  list of user names which may execute jobs on this front end node. By default, all
              users may use this front end node.  May not be used with the <b>DenyUsers</b> option.

       <b>DenyGroups</b>
              Comma-separated list of group names which are prevented from executing  jobs  on  this  front  end
              node.  May not be used with the <b>AllowGroups</b> option.

       <b>DenyUsers</b>
              Comma-separated list of user names which are prevented from executing jobs on this front end node.
              May not be used with the <b>AllowUsers</b> option.

       <b>FrontendName</b>
              Name  that  Slurm  uses  to  refer  to  a  frontend node.  Typically this would be the string that
              "<a href="file:/bin/hostname">/bin/hostname</a> -s" returns.  It may also be  the  fully  qualified  domain  name  as  returned  by
              "<a href="file:/bin/hostname">/bin/hostname</a>  -f"  (e.g.  "foo1.bar.com"),  or  any  valid  domain name associated with the host
              through the host database (<a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a>) or DNS, depending on the resolver settings.  Note  that  if
              the  short  form  of  the  hostname  is  not used, it may prevent use of hostlist expressions (the
              numeric portion in brackets must be at the end of the string).  If the <b>FrontendName</b> is  "DEFAULT",
              the  values  specified  with  that  record  will  apply  to  subsequent node specifications unless
              explicitly set to other values in that frontend node record or replaced with a  different  set  of
              default values.  Each line where <b>FrontendName</b> is "DEFAULT" will replace or add to previous default
              values and not reinitialize the default values.

       <b>FrontendAddr</b>
              Name  that  a frontend node should be referred to in establishing a communications path. This name
              will be  used  as  an  argument  to  the  getaddrinfo()  function  for  identification.   As  with
              <b>FrontendName</b>,  list  the  individual  node addresses rather than using a hostlist expression.  The
              number of <b>FrontendAddr</b> records per line must equal the number of  <b>FrontendName</b>  records  per  line
              (i.e.  you  can't  map to node names to one address).  <b>FrontendAddr</b> may also contain IP addresses.
              By default, the <b>FrontendAddr</b> will be identical in value to <b>FrontendName</b>.

       <b>Port</b>   The port number that the Slurm compute node daemon, <b>slurmd</b>, listens to for work on this particular
              frontend node. By default there is a single port number for all <b>slurmd</b>  daemons  on  all  frontend
              nodes  as  defined  by the <b>SlurmdPort</b> configuration parameter. Use of this option is not generally
              recommended except for development or testing purposes.

              <b>NOTE</b>: On Cray systems, Realm-Specific IP Addressing (RSIP) will automatically try to interact with
              anything opened on ports 8192-60000.  Configure Port to use  a  port  outside  of  the  configured
              SrunPortRange and RSIP's port range.

       <b>Reason</b> Identifies the reason for a frontend node being in state <u>DOWN</u>, <u>DRAINED</u>, <u>DRAINING</u>, <u>FAIL</u> or <u>FAILING</u>.
              Use quotes to enclose a reason having more than one word.

       <b>State</b>  State  of  the  frontend  node with respect to the initiation of user jobs.  Acceptable values are
              <u>DOWN</u>, <u>DRAIN</u>, <u>FAIL</u>, <u>FAILING</u> and <u>UNKNOWN</u>.  Node states of <u>BUSY</u> and <u>IDLE</u> should not be  specified  in
              the  node  configuration,  but  set  the node state to <u>UNKNOWN</u> instead.  Setting the node state to
              <u>UNKNOWN</u> will result in the node state being set to <u>BUSY</u>, <u>IDLE</u> or  other  appropriate  state  based
              upon  recovered  system  state  information.   For  more  information  about  these states see the
              descriptions under <b>State</b> in the <b>NodeName=</b> section above.  The default value is <u>UNKNOWN</u>.

       As an example, you can do something similar to the following to define four front end nodes  for  running
       slurmd daemons.
       FrontendName=frontend[00-03] FrontendAddr=efrontend[00-03] State=UNKNOWN

</pre><h4><b>NODESET</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  nodeset  configuration  allows you to define a name for a specific set of nodes which can be used to
       simplify the partition configuration section, especially for heterogenous or  condo-style  systems.  Each
       nodeset  may  be  defined  by  an  explicit  list of nodes, and/or by filtering the nodes by a particular
       configured feature. If both <b>Feature=</b> and <b>Nodes=</b> are used the nodeset  shall  be  the  union  of  the  two
       subsets.   Note that the nodesets are only used to simplify the partition definitions at present, and are
       not usable outside of the partition configuration.

       <b>Feature</b>
              All nodes with this feature will be included as part of this nodeset. Only  a  single  feature  is
              allowed.

       <b>Nodes</b>  List of nodes in this set.

       <b>NodeSet</b>
              Unique name for a set of nodes. Must not overlap with any NodeName definitions.

</pre><h4><b>PARTITION</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  partition configuration permits you to establish different job limits or access controls for various
       groups (or partitions) of nodes.  Nodes may be in more than one partition,  making  partitions  serve  as
       general  purpose  queues.   For  example one may put the same set of nodes into two different partitions,
       each with different constraints (time limit, job sizes, groups allowed to use the partition, etc.).  Jobs
       are allocated resources within a single partition.  Default values can be  specified  with  a  record  in
       which  <b>PartitionName</b> is "DEFAULT".  The default entry values will apply only to lines following it in the
       configuration file and the default values can be reset multiple times  in  the  configuration  file  with
       multiple  entries  where  "PartitionName=DEFAULT".   The "PartitionName=" specification must be placed on
       every line describing the configuration of partitions.  Each line where <b>PartitionName</b> is  "DEFAULT"  will
       replace  or  add  to previous default values and not reinitialize the default values.  A single partition
       name can not appear as a PartitionName value in more than one line (duplicate partition name records will
       be ignored).  If a partition that is in use is deleted from the configuration and slurm is  restarted  or
       reconfigured (scontrol reconfigure), jobs using the partition are canceled.  <b>NOTE</b>: Put all parameters for
       each  partition  on  a  single line.  Each line of partition configuration information should represent a
       different partition.  The partition configuration file contains the following information:

       <b>AllocNodes</b>
              Comma-separated list of nodes from which users can submit jobs in the partition.  Node  names  may
              be specified using the node range expression syntax described above.  The default value is "ALL".

       <b>AllowAccounts</b>
              Comma-separated  list  of  accounts which may execute jobs in the partition.  The default value is
              "ALL". This list is hierarchical,  meaning  subaccounts  are  included  automatically.   <b>NOTE</b>:  If
              AllowAccounts is used then DenyAccounts will not be enforced.  Also refer to DenyAccounts.

       <b>AllowGroups</b>
              Comma-separated  list  of  group  names  which may execute jobs in this partition.  A user will be
              permitted to submit a job to this partition if AllowGroups has <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>one</b> group associated  with
              the  user.   Jobs executed as user root or as user SlurmUser will be allowed to use any partition,
              regardless of the value of AllowGroups. In addition, a Slurm Admin or Operator  will  be  able  to
              view  any  partition,  regardless of the value of AllowGroups.  If user root attempts to execute a
              job as another user (e.g. using srun's --uid option), then the job will be subject to  AllowGroups
              as  if  it  were submitted by that user.  By default, AllowGroups is unset, meaning all groups are
              allowed to use this partition. The special value 'ALL' is equivalent to this.  Users who  are  not
              members  of the specified group will not see information about this partition by default. However,
              this should not be treated as a security mechanism, since job information will be  returned  if  a
              user  requests  details  about  the  partition or a specific job. See the <b>PrivateData</b> parameter to
              restrict access to job information.  <b>NOTE</b>: For performance reasons, Slurm maintains a list of user
              IDs allowed to use each partition and this is checked at job submission time.  This list  of  user
              IDs  is updated when the <b>slurmctld</b> daemon is restarted, reconfigured (e.g. "scontrol reconfig") or
              the partition's <b>AllowGroups</b> value is reset, even if is value is unchanged (e.g.  "scontrol  update
              PartitionName=name  AllowGroups=group").   For  a user's access to a partition to change, both his
              group membership must change and Slurm's internal user ID  list  must  change  using  one  of  the
              methods described above.

       <b>AllowQos</b>
              Comma-separated  list  of Qos which may execute jobs in the partition.  Jobs executed as user root
              can use any partition without regard to the value of AllowQos.  The default value is "ALL".  <b>NOTE</b>:
              If AllowQos is used then DenyQos will not be enforced.  Also refer to DenyQos.

       <b>Alternate</b>
              Partition name of alternate partition to be used if the state of  this  partition  is  "DRAIN"  or
              "INACTIVE."

       <b>CpuBind</b>
              If  a job step request does not specify an option to control how tasks are bound to allocated CPUs
              (by using --cpu-bind) and all nodes allocated to the job do not have the same <b>CpuBind</b>  option  for
              the  node,  then  the  partition's  <b>CpuBind</b>  option  will control how tasks are bound to allocated
              resources.  The <b>TaskPluginParam</b> will be used as a last resort, with the default being no  binding.
              Supported values for CpuBind are <b>none</b>, <b>socket</b>, <b>ldom</b> (NUMA), <b>core</b> and <b>thread</b>.

       <b>Default</b>
              If  this  keyword  is  set,  jobs  submitted  without  a partition specification will utilize this
              partition.  Possible values are "YES" and "NO".  The default value is "NO".

       <b>DefaultTime</b>
              Run time limit used for jobs that don't specify a value. If not set then  MaxTime  will  be  used.
              Format is the same as for MaxTime.

       <b>DefCpuPerGPU</b>
              Default  count  of  CPUs  allocated  per  allocated GPU. This value is used only if the job didn't
              specify --cpus-per-task and --cpus-per-gpu.

       <b>DefMemPerCPU</b>
              Default real memory size available per allocated CPU in megabytes.  Used to avoid over-subscribing
              memory and causing paging.  <b>DefMemPerCPU</b> would generally be  used  if  individual  processors  are
              allocated  to  jobs  (<b>SelectType=select/cons_tres</b>).   If  not  set, the <b>DefMemPerCPU</b> value for the
              entire  cluster  will  be  used.   Also  see   <b>DefMemPerGPU</b>,   <b>DefMemPerNode</b>   and   <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b>.
              <b>DefMemPerCPU</b>, <b>DefMemPerGPU</b> and <b>DefMemPerNode</b> are mutually exclusive.

       <b>DefMemPerGPU</b>
              Default  real  memory  size  available  per  allocated  GPU  in megabytes.  Also see <b>DefMemPerCPU</b>,
              <b>DefMemPerNode</b>  and  <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b>.   <b>DefMemPerCPU</b>,  <b>DefMemPerGPU</b>  and  <b>DefMemPerNode</b>  are  mutually
              exclusive.

       <b>DefMemPerNode</b>
              Default   real   memory   size   available  per  allocated  node  in  megabytes.   Used  to  avoid
              over-subscribing memory and causing paging.  <b>DefMemPerNode</b> would generally be used if whole  nodes
              are   allocated   to   jobs   (<b>SelectType=select/linear</b>)   and   resources   are   over-subscribed
              (<b>OverSubscribe=yes</b> or <b>OverSubscribe=force</b>).  If not set, the <b>DefMemPerNode</b> value  for  the  entire
              cluster  will  be  used.   Also  see  <b>DefMemPerCPU</b>,  <b>DefMemPerGPU</b> and <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b>.  <b>DefMemPerCPU</b>,
              <b>DefMemPerGPU</b> and <b>DefMemPerNode</b> are mutually exclusive.

       <b>DenyAccounts</b>
              Comma-separated list of accounts which may not execute jobs in  the  partition.   By  default,  no
              accounts  are  denied  access.  This  list  is  hierarchical,  meaning  subaccounts  are  included
              automatically.  <b>NOTE</b>: If AllowAccounts is used then DenyAccounts will not be enforced.  Also refer
              to AllowAccounts.

       <b>DenyQos</b>
              Comma-separated list of Qos which may not execute jobs in the partition.  By default, no  QOS  are
              denied access <b>NOTE</b>: If AllowQos is used then DenyQos will not be enforced.  Also refer AllowQos.

       <b>DisableRootJobs</b>
              If  set  to  "YES"  then user root will be prevented from running any jobs on this partition.  The
              default value will be the value of <b>DisableRootJobs</b> set outside of a partition specification (which
              is "NO", allowing user root to execute jobs).

       <b>ExclusiveTopo</b>
              If set to "YES," then only one job may be run on a single topology segment.   This  capability  is
              also available on a per-job basis by using the <b>--exclusive=topo</b> option.

       <b>ExclusiveUser</b>
              If  set  to "YES" then nodes will be exclusively allocated to users.  Multiple jobs may be run for
              the same user, but only one user can be active at a time.  This capability is also available on  a
              per-job basis by using the <b>--exclusive=user</b> option.

       <b>GraceTime</b>
              Specifies,  in  units of seconds, the preemption grace time to be extended to a job which has been
              selected for preemption.  This parameter only takes effect when  <b>PreemptType=partition_prio</b>.   The
              default value is zero, no preemption grace time is allowed on this partition.  Once a job has been
              selected  for  preemption, its end time is set to the current time plus GraceTime. The job's tasks
              are immediately sent SIGCONT and SIGTERM signals in order to provide notification of its  imminent
              termination.   This  is followed by the SIGCONT, SIGTERM and SIGKILL signal sequence upon reaching
              its new end time. This second set of signals is sent to both the tasks <b>and</b>  the  containing  batch
              script, if applicable.  See also the global <b>KillWait</b> configuration parameter.
              <b>NOTE</b>: This parameter does not apply to <b>PreemptMode=SUSPEND</b>.  For setting the preemption grace time
              when using <b>PreemptMode=SUSPEND</b>, see <b>PreemptParameters=suspend_grace_time</b>.

       <b>Hidden</b> Specifies  if  the  partition and its jobs are to be hidden by default.  Hidden partitions will by
              default not be reported by the Slurm APIs or commands.  Possible values are "YES" and  "NO".   The
              default  value  is  "NO".   Note  that  partitions  that  a  user lacks access to by virtue of the
              <b>AllowGroups</b> parameter will also be hidden by default.

       <b>LLN</b>    Schedule resources to jobs on the least loaded nodes (based upon the number of idle CPUs). This is
              generally only recommended for an environment with serial jobs as idle resources will tend  to  be
              highly fragmented, resulting in parallel jobs being distributed across many nodes.  Note that node
              <b>Weight</b>  takes  precedence  over  how  many  idle  resources  are  on  each  node.   Also  see  the
              <b>SelectTypeParameters</b> configuration parameter <b>CR_LLN</b>  to  use  the  least  loaded  nodes  in  every
              partition.

       <b>MaxCPUsPerNode</b>
              Maximum  number  of  CPUs  on  any  node  available  to all jobs from this partition.  This can be
              especially useful to schedule GPUs. For example a node can be associated with two Slurm partitions
              (e.g. "cpu" and "gpu") and the partition/queue "cpu" could be limited to  only  a  subset  of  the
              node's  CPUs,  ensuring  that  one  or  more  CPUs  would  be  available  to  jobs  in  the  "gpu"
              partition/queue.  Also see <b>MaxCPUsPerSocket</b>.

       <b>MaxCPUsPerSocket</b>
              Maximum number of CPUs on any node available on the all jobs from  this  partition.  This  can  be
              especially useful to schedule GPUs.  Also see <b>MaxCPUsPerNode</b>.

       <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b>
              Maximum real memory size available per allocated CPU in megabytes.  Used to avoid over-subscribing
              memory  and  causing  paging.   <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b>  would generally be used if individual processors are
              allocated to jobs (<b>SelectType=select/cons_tres</b>).  If not  set,  the  <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b>  value  for  the
              entire  cluster  will  be  used.   Also  see  <b>DefMemPerCPU</b>  and  <b>MaxMemPerNode</b>.   <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b> and
              <b>MaxMemPerNode</b> are mutually exclusive.

       <b>MaxMemPerNode</b>
              Maximum real memory size available per allocated node in a job allocation in  megabytes.  Used  to
              avoid  over-subscribing memory and causing paging.  <b>MaxMemPerNode</b> would generally be used if whole
              nodes  are  allocated  to  jobs  (<b>SelectType=select/linear</b>)  and  resources  are   over-subscribed
              (<b>OverSubscribe=yes</b>  or  <b>OverSubscribe=force</b>).   If not set, the <b>MaxMemPerNode</b> value for the entire
              cluster will be used.  Also see <b>DefMemPerNode</b> and <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b>.   <b>MaxMemPerCPU</b>  and  <b>MaxMemPerNode</b>
              are mutually exclusive.

       <b>MaxNodes</b>
              Maximum  count  of  nodes  which  may  be  allocated  to  any  single  job.   The default value is
              "UNLIMITED", which is represented internally as -1.

       <b>MaxTime</b>
              Maximum run time limit for  jobs.   Format  is  minutes,  minutes:seconds,  hours:minutes:seconds,
              days-hours, days-hours:minutes, days-hours:minutes:seconds or "UNLIMITED".  Time resolution is one
              minute  and  second values are rounded up to the next minute.  The job TimeLimit may be updated by
              root, SlurmUser or an Operator to a value higher than the configured MaxTime after job submission.

       <b>MinNodes</b>
              Minimum count of nodes which may be allocated to any single job.  The default value is 0.

       <b>Nodes</b>  Comma-separated list of nodes or nodesets which are associated with this  partition.   Node  names
              may  be  specified  using  the node range expression syntax described above. A blank list of nodes
              (i.e. Nodes="") can be used if one wants a partition to exist, but have no resources (possibly  on
              a temporary basis).  A value of "ALL" is mapped to all nodes configured in the cluster.

       <b>OverSubscribe</b>
              Controls  the  ability  of  the  partition to execute more than one job at a time on each resource
              (node, socket or core depending upon the value of <b>SelectTypeParameters</b>).  If resources are  to  be
              over-subscribed, avoiding memory over-subscription is very important.  <b>SelectTypeParameters</b> should
              be configured to treat memory as a consumable resource and the <b>--mem</b> option should be used for job
              allocations.    Sharing  of  resources  is  typically  useful  only  when  using  gang  scheduling
              (<b>PreemptMode=suspend,gang</b>).  Possible values for <b>OverSubscribe</b> are  "EXCLUSIVE",  "FORCE",  "YES",
              and  "NO".   Note  that  a value of "YES" or "FORCE" can negatively impact performance for systems
              with many thousands of running jobs.  The default value is "NO".  For  more  information  see  the
              following web pages:
              <u>https://slurm.schedmd.com/cons_tres.html</u>
              <u>https://slurm.schedmd.com/cons_tres_share.html</u>
              <u>https://slurm.schedmd.com/gang_scheduling.html</u>
              <u>https://slurm.schedmd.com/preempt.html</u>

              <b>EXCLUSIVE</b>   Allocates entire nodes to jobs even with <b>SelectType=select/cons_tres</b> configured.  Jobs
                          that  run in partitions with <b>OverSubscribe=EXCLUSIVE</b> will have exclusive access to all
                          allocated nodes.  These jobs are allocated all CPUs and GRES on the  nodes,  but  they
                          are  only  allocated as much memory as they ask for. This is by design to support gang
                          scheduling, because suspended jobs still reside in memory. To request all  the  memory
                          on a node, use <b>--mem=0</b> at submit time.

              <b>FORCE</b>       Makes  all  resources  (except  GRES)  in the partition available for oversubscription
                          without any means for users to disable it.  May be followed with a colon  and  maximum
                          number  of  jobs  in  running  or  suspended state.  For example <b>OverSubscribe=FORCE:4</b>
                          enables  each  node,  socket  or  core  to  oversubscribe  each  resource  four  ways.
                          Recommended only for systems using <b>PreemptMode=suspend,gang</b>.

                          <b>NOTE</b>:  <b>OverSubscribe=FORCE:1</b>  is  a  special  case  that  is not exactly equivalent to
                          <b>OverSubscribe=NO</b>.  <b>OverSubscribe=FORCE:1</b>  disables  the  regular  oversubscription  of
                          resources  in  the  same  partition  but  it  will still allow oversubscription due to
                          preemption  or  on  overlapping  partitions  with  the  same   PriorityTier.   Setting
                          <b>OverSubscribe=NO</b> will prevent oversubscription from happening in all cases.

                          <b>NOTE</b>:  If  using  <b>PreemptType=preempt/qos</b>  you  can  specify a value for <b>FORCE</b> that is
                          greater than 1. For example, <b>OverSubscribe=FORCE:2</b> will permit two jobs  per  resource
                          normally, but a third job can be started only if done so through preemption based upon
                          QOS.

                          <b>NOTE</b>: If <b>OverSubscribe</b> is configured to <b>FORCE</b> or <b>YES</b> in your slurm.conf and the system
                          is  not  configured  to use preemption (<b>PreemptMode=OFF</b>) accounting can easily grow to
                          values greater than the actual utilization. It may be common on such  systems  to  get
                          error  messages  in  the  slurmdbd  log  stating: "We have more allocated time than is
                          possible."

              <b>YES</b>         Makes all resources (except GRES) in the partition available for sharing upon  request
                          by  the  job.  Resources will only be over-subscribed when explicitly requested by the
                          user using the "--oversubscribe" option on job submission.  May  be  followed  with  a
                          colon  and  maximum  number  of  jobs  in  running  or  suspended  state.  For example
                          "OverSubscribe=YES:4" enables each node, socket or core to execute up to four jobs  at
                          once.     Recommended    only    for    systems    running    with   gang   scheduling
                          (<b>PreemptMode=suspend,gang</b>).

              <b>NO</b>          Selected resources are allocated to a single job. No resource  will  be  allocated  to
                          more than one job.

                          <b>NOTE</b>:  Even  if  you are using <b>PreemptMode=suspend,gang</b>, setting <b>OverSubscribe=NO</b> will
                          disable preemption on that partition. Use <b>OverSubscribe=FORCE:1</b> if you want to disable
                          normal oversubscription but still allow suspension due to preemption.

       <b>OverTimeLimit</b>
              Number of minutes by which a job can exceed its time limit  before  being  canceled.   Normally  a
              job's  time  limit is treated as a <u>hard</u> limit and the job will be killed upon reaching that limit.
              Configuring <b>OverTimeLimit</b> will result in the job's time limit being treated  like  a  <u>soft</u>  limit.
              Adding  the  <b>OverTimeLimit</b> value to the <u>soft</u> time limit provides a <u>hard</u> time limit, at which point
              the job is canceled.  This is particularly useful for backfill scheduling, which bases  upon  each
              job's  soft  time limit.  If not set, the <b>OverTimeLimit</b> value for the entire cluster will be used.
              May not exceed 65533 minutes.  A value of "UNLIMITED" is also supported.

       <b>PartitionName</b>
              Name by which the partition may be referenced (e.g. "Interactive").  This name can be specified by
              users when submitting jobs.  If the <b>PartitionName</b> is "DEFAULT", the  values  specified  with  that
              record  will apply to subsequent partition specifications unless explicitly set to other values in
              that partition record or replaced with a  different  set  of  default  values.   Each  line  where
              <b>PartitionName</b> is "DEFAULT" will replace or add to previous default values and not reinitialize the
              default values.

       <b>PowerDownOnIdle</b>
              If  set  to  "YES"  and  power saving is enabled for the partition, then nodes allocated from this
              partition will be requested to power down after being allocated at least  one  job.   These  nodes
              will  not  power  down  until  they transition from COMPLETING to IDLE.  If set to "NO" then power
              saving  will  operate  as  configured  for  the  partition.   The  default  value  is  "NO".   See
              &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/power_save.html&gt; and &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/elastic_computing.html&gt;
              for more details.

              <b>NOTE</b>: The following will cause a transition from COMPLETING to IDLE:
              Completing all running jobs without additional jobs being allocated.
              ExclusiveUser=YES and after all running jobs complete but before another user's job is allocated.
              OverSubscribe=EXCLUSIVE and after the running job completes but before another job is allocated.

              <b>NOTE</b>:   Nodes   are  still  subject  to  powering  down  when  being  IDLE  for  <b>SuspendTime</b>  when
              PowerDownOnIdle is set to NO.&lt;/p&gt;

              Also see <b>SuspendTime</b>.

       <b>PreemptMode</b>
              Mechanism  used  to  preempt  jobs  or  enable   gang   scheduling   for   this   partition   when
              <b>PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio</b>    is    configured.    This   partition-specific   <b>PreemptMode</b>
              configuration parameter will override the cluster-wide <b>PreemptMode</b> for this partition.  It can  be
              set  to  OFF  to disable preemption and gang scheduling for this partition.  See also <b>PriorityTier</b>
              and the above description of the cluster-wide <b>PreemptMode</b> parameter for further details.
              The <b>GANG</b> option is used to enable gang scheduling independent of  whether  preemption  is  enabled
              (i.e.  independent  of  the <b>PreemptType</b> setting). It can be specified in addition to a <b>PreemptMode</b>
              setting with the two options comma separated (e.g. <b>PreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG</b>).
              See &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/preempt.html&gt; and  &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/gang_scheduling.html&gt;
              for more details.

              <b>NOTE</b>:  For  performance reasons, the backfill scheduler reserves whole nodes for jobs, not partial
              nodes. If during backfill scheduling a job preempts one or more other jobs, the  whole  nodes  for
              those preempted jobs are reserved for the preemptor job, even if the preemptor job requested fewer
              resources  than  that.   These  reserved nodes aren't available to other jobs during that backfill
              cycle, even if the other jobs could fit on the nodes. Therefore, jobs may preempt  more  resources
              during a single backfill iteration than they requested.
              <b>NOTE</b>:  For  heterogeneous  job to be considered for preemption all components must be eligible for
              preemption. When a heterogeneous job is to be preempted the first identified component of the  job
              with  the  highest order PreemptMode (<b>SUSPEND</b> (highest), <b>REQUEUE</b>, <b>CANCEL</b> (lowest)) will be used to
              set the PreemptMode for all components. The <b>GraceTime</b> and user warning signal for  each  component
              of  the  heterogeneous  job  remain  unique.  Heterogeneous jobs are excluded from GANG scheduling
              operations.

              <b>OFF</b>         Disables job preemption and gang scheduling.

              <b>CANCEL</b>      The preempted job will be cancelled.

              <b>GANG</b>        Enables gang scheduling (time slicing) of jobs in the same partition, and  allows  the
                          resuming of suspended jobs.

                          <b>NOTE</b>:  Gang  scheduling  is performed independently for each partition, so if you only
                          want  time-slicing  by  <b>OverSubscribe</b>,  without  any  preemption,   then   configuring
                          partitions  with overlapping nodes is not recommended.  On the other hand, if you want
                          to use <b>PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio</b>  to  allow  jobs  from  higher  PriorityTier
                          partitions   to  Suspend  jobs  from  lower  PriorityTier  partitions  you  will  need
                          overlapping partitions, and <b>PreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG</b> to  use  the  Gang  scheduler  to
                          resume  the suspended jobs(s).  In any case, time-slicing won't happen between jobs on
                          different partitions.
                          <b>NOTE</b>: Heterogeneous jobs are excluded from GANG scheduling operations.

              <b>REQUEUE</b>     Preempts jobs by requeuing them (if possible) or  canceling  them.   For  jobs  to  be
                          requeued they must have the --requeue sbatch option set or the cluster wide JobRequeue
                          parameter in slurm.conf must be set to <b>1</b>.

              <b>SUSPEND</b>     The  preempted  jobs will be suspended, and later the Gang scheduler will resume them.
                          Therefore the <b>SUSPEND</b> preemption mode always needs the <b>GANG</b> option to be specified  at
                          the  cluster  level.  Also,  because  the  suspended jobs will still use memory on the
                          allocated nodes, Slurm needs to be able to  track  memory  resources  to  be  able  to
                          suspend jobs.

                          If  the  preemptees  and preemptor are on different partitions then the preempted jobs
                          will remain suspended until the preemptor ends.
                          <b>NOTE</b>: Because gang scheduling is performed independently for each partition, if  using
                          <b>PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio</b>  then  jobs  in higher PriorityTier partitions will
                          suspend jobs in lower PriorityTier partitions to run on the released  resources.  Only
                          when  the  preemptor  job  ends  will  the  suspended jobs will be resumed by the Gang
                          scheduler.
                          <b>NOTE</b>: Suspended jobs will not release GRES. Higher priority jobs will not be  able  to
                          preempt to gain access to GRES.

       <b>PriorityJobFactor</b>
              Partition  factor  used by priority/multifactor plugin in calculating job priority.  The value may
              not exceed 65533.  Also see PriorityTier.

       <b>PriorityTier</b>
              Jobs submitted to a partition with a higher <b>PriorityTier</b> value will be evaluated by the  scheduler
              before  pending  jobs in a partition with a lower <b>PriorityTier</b> value. They will also be considered
              for  preemption  of  running  jobs   in   partition(s)   with   lower   <b>PriorityTier</b>   values   if
              <u>PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio</u>.  The value may not exceed 65533.  Also see PriorityJobFactor.

       <b>QOS</b>    Used  to  extend the limits available to a QOS on a partition. Jobs will not be associated to this
              QOS outside of being associated to the partition. They will still be associated to their requested
              QOS.  By  default,  no  QOS  is  used.   Additional  details  are  in  the  QOS  documentation  at
              &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/qos.html&gt;, including special conditions when a relative QOS is used for
              this  parameter.   <b>NOTE</b>:  If  a  limit  is  set in both the Partition's QOS and the Job's QOS, the
              Partition QOS limit will be honored unless the Job's QOS has the <b>OverPartQOS</b> flag  set,  in  which
              case the Job's QOS limit will take precedence.

       <b>ReqResv</b>
              Specifies  users  of this partition are required to designate a reservation when submitting a job.
              This option can be useful in restricting usage of a partition that may  have  higher  priority  or
              additional resources to be allowed only within a reservation.  Possible values are "YES" and "NO".
              The default value is "NO".

       <b>ResumeTimeout</b>
              Maximum time permitted (in seconds) between when a node resume request is issued and when the node
              is actually available for use.  Nodes which fail to respond in this time frame will be marked DOWN
              and  the  jobs  scheduled  on the node requeued.  Nodes which reboot after this time frame will be
              marked DOWN with a reason of "Node  unexpectedly  rebooted."   For  nodes  that  are  in  multiple
              partitions  with  this option set, the highest time will take effect. If not set on any partition,
              the node will use the <b>ResumeTimeout</b> value set for the entire cluster.

       <b>RootOnly</b>
              Specifies if only user ID zero (i.e. user <u>root</u>) may allocate resources  in  this  partition.  User
              root  may  allocate  resources for any other user, but the request must be initiated by user root.
              This option can be useful for  a  partition  to  be  managed  by  some  external  entity  (e.g.  a
              higher-level job manager) and prevents users from directly using those resources.  Possible values
              are "YES" and "NO".  The default value is "NO".

       <b>SelectTypeParameters</b>
              Partition-specific resource allocation type.  This option replaces the global <b>SelectTypeParameters</b>
              value.   Supported  values  are  <b>CR_Core</b>,  <b>CR_Core_Memory</b>,  <b>CR_Socket</b>  and  <b>CR_Socket_Memory</b>.  Use
              requires the system-wide <b>SelectTypeParameters</b> value be set to any of  the  four  supported  values
              previously listed; otherwise, the partition-specific value will be ignored.

       <b>Shared</b> The  <b>Shared</b>  configuration  parameter  has  been replaced by the <b>OverSubscribe</b> parameter described
              above.

       <b>State</b>  State of partition or availability  for  use.  Possible  values  are  "UP",  "DOWN",  "DRAIN"  and
              "INACTIVE". The default value is "UP".  See also the related "Alternate" keyword.

              <b>UP</b>        Designates  that new jobs may be queued on the partition, and that jobs may be allocated
                        nodes and run from the partition.

              <b>DOWN</b>      Designates that new jobs may be queued on the partition, but  queued  jobs  may  not  be
                        allocated  nodes  and  run  from  the  partition.  Jobs already running on the partition
                        continue to run. The jobs must be explicitly canceled to force their termination.

              <b>DRAIN</b>     Designates that no new jobs may be queued on the partition (job submission requests will
                        be denied with an error message), but jobs  already  queued  on  the  partition  may  be
                        allocated nodes and run.  See also the "Alternate" partition specification.

              <b>INACTIVE</b>  Designates  that no new jobs may be queued on the partition, and jobs already queued may
                        not be allocated nodes and run.  See also the "Alternate" partition specification.

       <b>SuspendTime</b>
              Nodes which remain idle or down for this number of seconds will be placed into power save mode  by
              <b>SuspendProgram</b>.   For nodes that are in multiple partitions with this option set, the highest time
              will take effect. If not set on any partition, the node will use the <b>SuspendTime</b> value set for the
              entire cluster.  Setting <b>SuspendTime</b>  to  INFINITE  will  disable  suspending  of  nodes  in  this
              partition.  Setting <b>SuspendTime</b> to anything but INFINITE (or -1) will enable power save mode.

       <b>SuspendTimeout</b>
              Maximum  time  permitted  (in  seconds) between when a node suspend request is issued and when the
              node is shutdown.  At that time the node must be ready for a resume request to be issued as needed
              for new work.  For nodes that are in multiple partitions with this option set,  the  highest  time
              will  take effect. If not set on any partition, the node will use the <b>SuspendTimeout</b> value set for
              the entire cluster.

       <b>TRESBillingWeights</b>
              TRESBillingWeights is used  to  define  the  billing  weights  of  each  tracked  TRES  type  (see
              <b>AccountingStorageTRES</b>)  that  will be used in calculating the usage of a job. The calculated usage
              is used when calculating fairshare and when enforcing the TRES billing limit on jobs.

              Billing weights are specified as a comma-separated  list  of  <u>&lt;TRES</u>  <u>Type&gt;</u>=<u>&lt;TRES</u>  <u>Billing</u>  <u>Weight&gt;</u>
              pairs.

              Any  TRES  Type  is available for billing. Note that the base unit for memory and burst buffers is
              megabytes.

              By default the billing of TRES is calculated as the sum of all  TRES  types  multiplied  by  their
              corresponding billing weight.

              The  weighted  amount  of  a resource can be adjusted by adding a suffix of K,M,G,T or P after the
              billing weight. For example, a memory weight of "mem=.25" on a job allocated 8GB  will  be  billed
              2048 (8192MB *.25) units. A memory weight of "mem=.25G" on the same job will be billed 2 (8192MB *
              (.25/1024)) units.

              Negative values are allowed.

              When   a   job   is  allocated  1  CPU  and  8  GB  of  memory  on  a  partition  configured  with
              TRESBillingWeights="CPU=1.0,Mem=0.25G,GRES/gpu=2.0,license/licA=1.5", the billable TRES  will  be:
              (1*1.0) + (8*0.25) + (0*2.0) + (0*1.5) = 3.0.

              If  PriorityFlags=MAX_TRES is configured, the billable TRES is calculated as the MAX of individual
              TRESs on a node (e.g. cpus, mem, gres) plus the sum of all global TRESs (e.g. licenses). Using the
              same example above the billable TRES will be MAX(1*1.0, 8*0.25, 0*2.0) + (0*1.5) = 2.0.

              If TRESBillingWeights is not defined then the job is billed against the total number of  allocated
              CPUs.

              <b>NOTE</b>:  TRESBillingWeights doesn't affect job priority directly as it is currently not used for the
              size of the job. If you want TRESs to play a  role  in  the  job's  priority  then  refer  to  the
              PriorityWeightTRES option.

</pre><h4><b>PROLOG</b> <b>AND</b> <b>EPILOG</b> <b>SCRIPTS</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  a  variety  of prolog and epilog program options that execute with various permissions and at
       various times.  The four options most likely to be used are: <b>Prolog</b> and <b>Epilog</b>  (executed  once  on  each
       compute  node for each job) plus <b>PrologSlurmctld</b> and <b>EpilogSlurmctld</b> (executed once on the <b>ControlMachine</b>
       for each job).

       <b>NOTE</b>: Standard output and error messages are normally not preserved.  Explicitly write output  and  error
       messages to an appropriate location if you wish to preserve that information.

       <b>NOTE</b>:  By default the Prolog script is ONLY run on any individual node when it first sees a job step from
       a new allocation. It does not run the Prolog immediately when an allocation is granted. If no  job  steps
       from  an  allocation  are  run  on  a node, it will never run the Prolog for that allocation. This Prolog
       behavior can be changed by the <b>PrologFlags</b> parameter. The Epilog, on the other hand, always runs on every
       node of an allocation when the allocation is released.

       If the Epilog fails (returns a non-zero exit code), this will result in the node being  set  to  a  DRAIN
       state.   If  the  EpilogSlurmctld fails (returns a non-zero exit code), this will only be logged.  If the
       Prolog fails (returns a non-zero exit code), this will result in the node being set to a DRAIN state  and
       the job being requeued. The job will be placed in a held state unless <b>nohold_on_prolog_fail</b> is configured
       in <b>SchedulerParameters</b>.  If the PrologSlurmctld fails (returns a non-zero exit code), this will result in
       the  job  being  requeued  to  be  executed on another node if possible. Only batch jobs can be requeued.
       Interactive jobs (salloc and srun) will be cancelled if  the  PrologSlurmctld  fails.   If  slurmctld  is
       stopped  while  either  PrologSlurmctld  or  EpilogSlurmctld  is  running, the script will be killed with
       SIGKILL. The script will restart when slurmctld restarts.

       Information about the job is  passed  to  the  script  using  environment  variables.   Unless  otherwise
       specified,  these  environment  variables  are  available in each of the scripts mentioned above (<b>Prolog</b>,
       <b>Epilog</b>, <b>PrologSlurmctld</b> and <b>EpilogSlurmctld</b>). For a full list  of  environment  variables  that  includes
       those available in the <b>SrunProlog</b>, <b>SrunEpilog</b>, <b>TaskProlog</b> and <b>TaskEpilog</b> please see the Prolog and Epilog

       This  program  can  be  used  to  take special actions to clean up the unkillable processes and/or notify
       system administrators.  The program will be run as <b>SlurmdUser</b> (usually "root") on the compute node  where

       <b>SLURM_STEP_ID</b>
              Job Step ID.

</pre><h4><b>NETWORK</b> <b>TOPOLOGY</b></h4><pre>
       Slurm is able to optimize job allocations to minimize network contention.  Special Slurm logic is used to
       optimize allocations on systems with a three-dimensional interconnect.  and information about configuring
       those   systems  are  available  on  web  pages  available  here:  &lt;https://slurm.schedmd.com/&gt;.   For  a
       hierarchical network, Slurm needs to have detailed information about how  nodes  are  configured  on  the
       network switches.

       Given  network  topology  information, Slurm allocates all of a job's resources onto a single leaf of the
       network (if possible) using a best-fit algorithm.  Otherwise it will  allocate  a  job's  resources  onto
       multiple  leaf switches so as to minimize the use of higher-level switches.  The <b>TopologyPlugin</b> parameter
       controls which plugin is used to  collect  network  topology  information.   The  only  values  presently
       supported  are  "topology/3d_torus"  (default  for  Cray  XT/XE  systems,  performs  best-fit  logic over
       three-dimensional  topology),  "topology/default"  (default  for  other  systems,  -best-fit  logic  over
       one-dimensional  topology),  "topology/tree",  and  "topology/block" (both determine the network topology
       based upon information contained in a topology.conf file, see "man topology.conf" for more  information).
       Future  plugins  may  gather topology information directly from the network.  The topology information is
       optional.  If not provided, Slurm will  perform  a  best-fit  algorithm  assuming  the  nodes  are  in  a
       one-dimensional  array  as configured and the communications cost is related to the node distance in this
       array.

</pre><h4><b>RELOCATING</b> <b>CONTROLLERS</b></h4><pre>
       If the cluster's computers used for the primary or backup controller  will  be  out  of  service  for  an
       extended period of time, it may be desirable to relocate them.  In order to do so, follow this procedure:

       1. Stop the Slurm daemons on the old controller and nodes.
       2. Modify the slurm.conf file appropriately.
       3.  Copy the files from the StateSaveLocation to the new controller or ensure that they are accessible to
       the new controller via a shared drive.
       4. Distribute the updated slurm.conf file to all nodes.
       5. Restart the Slurm daemons on the new controller and nodes.

       There should be no loss of any pending jobs. Any running jobs will get the updated host info  and  finish
       normally.  Ensure that any nodes added to the cluster have the current slurm.conf file installed.

       <b>CAUTION:</b>  If  two  nodes  are  simultaneously  configured  as  the primary controller (two nodes on which
       <b>SlurmctldHost</b> specify the local host and the <b>slurmctld</b> daemon is executing on each), system behavior will
       be destructive.  If a compute node has an incorrect <b>SlurmctldHost</b> parameter, that node  may  be  rendered
       unusable, but no other harm will result.

       The "include" key word can be used with modifiers within the specified pathname. These modifiers would be
       replaced with cluster name or other information depending on which modifier is specified. If the included
       file is not an absolute path name (i.e. it does not start with a slash), it will searched for in the same
       directory as the slurm.conf file.

       <b>%c</b>     Cluster name specified in the slurm.conf will be used.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>PERMISSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There  are  three  classes  of  files:  Files  used by <b>slurmctld</b> must be accessible by user <b>SlurmUser</b> and
       accessible by the primary and backup control machines.  Files used by <b>slurmd</b> must be accessible  by  user
       root  and  accessible  from every compute node.  A few files need to be accessible by normal users on all

              control machines.

</pre><h4><b>LOGGING</b></h4><pre>
       Note  that  while  Slurm daemons create log files and other files as needed, it treats the lack of parent
       directories as a fatal error.  This prevents the daemons from running if critical file  systems  are  not
       mounted and will minimize the risk of cold-starting (starting without preserving jobs).

       Log files and job accounting files may need to be created/owned by the "SlurmUser" uid to be successfully
       accessed.  Use  the "chown" and "chmod" commands to set the ownership and permissions appropriately.  See
       the section <b>FILE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DIRECTORY</b> <b>PERMISSIONS</b> for information about the various files and  directories  used
       by Slurm.

       It  is  recommended that the logrotate utility be used to ensure that various log files do not become too
       large.  This also applies to text files used for accounting, process tracking, and the  slurmdbd  log  if
       they are used.

       Here   is   a   sample   logrotate  configuration.  Make  appropriate  site  modifications  and  save  as
       /etc/logrotate.d/slurm on all nodes.  See the <b>logrotate</b> man page for more details.
