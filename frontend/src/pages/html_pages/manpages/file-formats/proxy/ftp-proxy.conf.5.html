</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       ftp-proxy.conf - configuration file for FTP-Proxy

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/proxy-suite/ftp-proxy.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  manual  page  documents the configuration file format of the <b><a href="../man8/ftp-proxy.8.html">ftp-proxy</a>(8)</b> program.  FTP-Proxy is an
       application level gateway between FTP clients and servers.  Its main purpose is to secure servers against
       attacks based on the FTP protocol.

       The FTP-Proxy configuration file consists of option lines and comments.   A  line  starting  with  a  '#'
       character is a comment.  The general format of a option line is

       <b>[WhiteSpace]</b> <b>Name</b> <b>WhiteSpace</b> <b>Value</b> <b>[WhiteSpace]</b>

       It  is  recommended to use up to 24 characters for the name and no more than 1024 for the value, although
       theoretically both can be up to 4096 in size.  Lines  can  be  continued  if  the  last  character  is  a
       backslash.  The whole file is not case sensitive.

   <b>CONTEXT</b>
       Option  lines  always  have a <b>context</b> which may be global or user specific.  A context is introduced by a
       <b>[name]</b> line, where name is the FTP-login name or authuser if the <b>UserAuthMagic</b> feature  is  used.  It  is
       allowed  to  use  '*'  wildcard  character  at  the  end of the context name <b>[name*]</b> i.e. [foo*] to match
       multiple usernames beginning with "foo".  The beginning of the file is implicitly the <b>[-Global-]</b>  context
       (the dashes allow a user context named [global] without conflict).  It is legal to include an option more
       than  once; the last one will be the one used.  Options in user contexts usually take precedence over the
       equivalent global option.

       Some of the options can be used in a user or the global context, while others make sense only in  one  of
       them.  See below.

   <b>VARIABLE</b> <b>SUBSTITUTION</b>
       Several  options  (see  the  individual  discussion  below for details) support a limited set of variable
       substitution when evaluated.  The following replacements will be performed:

           <b>%b</b>    build date of the <a href="../man8/ftp-proxy.8.html">ftp-proxy</a>(8) program
           <b>%d</b>    current system date in the form YYYY/MM/DD
           <b>%h</b>    host name from <a href="../man2/gethostname.2.html">gethostname</a>(2)
           <b>%n</b>    network name from <a href="../man2/getdomainname.2.html">getdomainname</a>(2)
           <b>%t</b>    current system time in the form HH:MM:SS
           <b>%v</b>    version of the <a href="../man8/ftp-proxy.8.html">ftp-proxy</a>(8) program
           <b>%%</b>    a single percent sign

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ActiveMaxDataPort</b>
              Both user and global context.  Defines the maximum local port number used when connecting  to  the
              client's  data  port.  The latter is either the same as the client's control port or the one given
              in the most recent <b>PORT</b> command.  If either minimum or maximum value is  not  given,  the  program
              defaults  to  using  port 20, the <b>ftp-data</b> port as per <b>RFC</b> <b>959,</b> for the local end of the socket if
              the proxy is running as root (user ID 0) or to use a random port. See also  <b>ActiveMinDataPort</b>  and
              <b>User</b> options.

       <b>ActiveMinDataPort</b>
              Both  user  and global context.  Defines the minimum local port number used when connecting to the
              client's data port.  See also <b>ActiveMaxDataPort</b> and <b>User</b> options.

       <b>AllowMagicUser</b>
              Global context only.  Defines a flag that when set to <b>yes,</b> <b>true,</b> or <b>on</b> allows the USER name to  be
              optionally  interpreted as <b>user[@host[:port]]</b> where host overrides the <b>DestinationAddress</b> and port
              the <b>DestinationPort</b> directive below. It should only be activated with "trusted" users, like in  an
              outgoing FTP proxy scenario. See also the <b>UserMagicChar</b> and <b>ForceMagicUser</b> options.

       <b>AllowTransProxy</b>
              Global context only.  Defines a flag that when set to <b>yes,</b> <b>true,</b> or <b>on</b> allows one to use the proxy
              as  transparent  proxy  for  outgoing  ftp.   To  get  it working you also have to redirect client
              requests on a gateway or firewall host (i.e. via ipchains) to the ftp-proxy.  It  should  only  be
              activated  with "trusted" users, like in an outgoing FTP proxy scenario. You can combine this with
              the <b>AllowMagicUser</b> option.

       <b>DenyMessage</b>
              Global context only.  Defines the name of a file which prevents any successful login if it exists,
              even if it is empty.  The file contents will be sent to the client, each line prefixed with <b>'421-'</b>
              and with variable substitution applied.  The whole file is followed by a line starting with <b>'421</b> <b>'</b>
              followed by the <b>DenyString</b> below.  After sending the  connection  is  closed.   If  no  such  file
              exists, the deny mechanism is not triggered altogether.  See also <b>DenyString</b> option.

       <b>DenyString</b>
              Global context only.  Defines a string that will be displayed to clients, prefixed with <b>'421</b> <b>'</b> and
              variable  substitution applied, if and only if a <b>DenyMessage</b> file exists.  The default is <b>'Service</b>
              <b>not</b> <b>available'.</b>  See also <b>DenyMessage</b> option.

       <b>DestinationAddress</b>
              Both user and global context.  Defines where to redirect incoming FTP traffic.  Can  be  given  as
              either  dotted  decimal  IP address or as DNS host name.  Please note that the global section must
              always contain this option as a basic sanity check.

       <b>DestinationMaxPort</b>
              Both user and global context.  Defines the maximum local port number to be  used  when  opening  a
              connection  to  the FTP server.  Valid both for control and for data connections.  Defaults to not
              binding prior to connecting and listening, so that the system selects an arbitrary ephemeral port.
              See also <b>DestinationMinPort</b> option.

       <b>DestinationMinPort</b>
              Both user and global context.  Defines the minimum local port number to be  used  when  opening  a
              connection to the FTP server.  See also <b>DestinationMaxPort</b> option.

       <b>DestinationPort</b>
              Both  user  and global context.  Defines the FTP server's control port where the proxy itself will
              connect.  This option can either be given as a numeric value or as the service name  retrieved  by
              <b><a href="../man3/getservbyname.3.html">getservbyname</a>(3)</b> and defaults to port 21, the <b>ftp</b> port as per <b>RFC</b> <b>959.</b>

       <b>DestinationTransferMode</b>
              Both  user  and  global  context.   Defines the FTP transfer mode to be used from the proxy to the
              server.  Legal values are <b>active,</b> <b>passive,</b> or <b>client.</b>  The latter means to  follow  the  mode  the
              client is using.  The default value is <b>client.</b>

       <b>FailResetsPasv</b>
              Global  context  only.  Defines the action that is taken when a data transfer command is failed on
              the server side.  If the option is set to <b>yes,</b> <b>true,</b> or <b>on</b> the client data transfer socket will be
              closed and the transfer mode set to the default (active-ftp).
              If this flag is set to <b>no,</b> <b>false,</b> or <b>off</b> (which is also the default) the socket can be reused  for
              the  next  data  transfer command in passive mode. This options is a workaround for Netscape (4.x)
              clients, that sends a second data transfer command if the first is failed, while the  user  clicks
              on a symbolic link pointing to a directory.
              Note, that this behavior may break the RFC definitions.

       <b>ForceMagicUser</b>
              Global context only. Same as AllowMagicUser, but makes the host and port portion mandatory.

       <b>ForkLimit</b>
              Global  context only. Limits the number of incoming client connections per minute in daemon mode -
              it defaults to 40 connections per minute.

       <b>Group</b>  Global context only.  Defines the UNIX style group ID which is set by the process before it serves
              clients.  Default is to keep the current real group ID.

       <b>LDAPAuthDN</b>
              Global context only.  Defines a different base distinguished name that is used when  accessing  an
              LDAP directory for user authentication purposes. It defaults to the value of <b>LDAPBaseDN.</b>  See also
              <b>LDAPAuthPWAttr,</b> <b>LDAPAuthPWType,</b> <b>LDAPAuthOKFlag,</b> <b>UserAuthType,</b> <b>LDAPBindDN</b> options.

       <b>LDAPAuthOKFlag</b>
              Global   context   only.    Defines  an  attribute  and  its  value  as  <b>attr=value</b>  string,  i.e.
              userEnabled=yes, that will be checked while user authentication in the  directory  tree  specified
              using <b>LDAPAuthDN</b> or <b>LDAPBaseDN.</b>  Defaults to an empty string - no flag check used.

       <b>LDAPAuthPWAttr</b>
              Global context only.  Defines the LDAP password attribute name used for user authentication.
              A  common  used  attribute  name  is  <b>userPassword.</b>   Defaults  to  an  empty  string  -  password
              authentication disabled.  See also <b>LDAPAuthPWType</b> option.

       <b>LDAPAuthPWType</b>
              Global context only.  Defines the LDAP password type /  format  and  a  minimal  allowed  password
              length expected as value for attribute name specified using <b>LDAPAuthPWAttr.</b>

              Valid  values  are  <b>plain,</b>  <b>crypt,</b>  <b>{crypt}</b>  followed by one number <b>0-9,</b> i.e.  <b>{crypt}7,</b> <b>plain9</b> or
              <b>plain.</b>

              If no minimum length specified the default minimum length of 5 characters is used.

              A password type {crypt} means, the password value in the LDAP directory is prefixed by the {crypt}
              scheme specification. Other password schemes, i.e. MD5, are not supported at the moment.
              Crypted passwords are only available, if the proxy is compiled  with  crypt  support  -  see  also
              <b>--with-crypt</b> compile time option in configure script.

              If  the  password  (without  scheme  prefix)  stored  in  LDAP directory is <b>*</b> or <b>!</b>  the account is
              disabled and the authentication fails.

              Defaults to <b>plain</b> (equivalent to plain5). See also the <b>LDAPAuthOKFlag.</b>

       <b>LDAPBaseDN</b>
              Global context only.  Defines the base distinguished name that is  used  when  accessing  an  <b>LDAP</b>
              directory,  i.e.  the  root  of  the  tree  containing the FTP-Proxy entries. Defaults to an empty
              string. If <b>UserAuthMagic</b> is used, the authuser is used as user name for  authentication  and  user
              profiles,   otherwise  the  normal  ftp-user  name.   See  also  <b>LDAPIdentifier,</b>  <b>LDAPObjectClass,</b>
              <b>LDAPServer,</b> <b>UserAuthMagic</b> options.

       <b>LDAPBindDN</b>
              Defines the distinguished name that is used to (simple) bind the directory service. Defaults to an
              empty string (anonymous bind). It is allowed to include one  %s  in  this  string,  that  will  be
              replaced  with  the  FTP  username  or authuser if <b>UserAuthMagic</b> is used.  See also <b>UserAuthMagic,</b>
              <b>LDAPAuthDN,</b> <b>LDAPBindPW</b> options.

       <b>LDAPBindPW</b>
              Defines the credential (password) that is used  to  (simple)  bind  the  directory  service  using
              distinguished name given in the <b>LDAPBindDN</b> option. Defaults to an empty string (anonymous bind).

       <b>LDAPIdentifier</b>
              Global  context  only.  Defines the identification attribute for the access to the <b>LDAP</b> directory.
              This can be thought of as the primary key and defaults to the string <b>CN</b> which is short for "Common
              Name."  See also <b>LDAPBaseDN,</b> <b>LDAPObjectClass,</b> <b>LDAPServer</b> options.

       <b>LDAPObjectClass</b>
              Global context only.  Defines the <b>LDAP</b> object class which holds  the  entries  for  the  FTP-Proxy
              access  control.  It is assumed that the possible user specific config options exist as attributes
              within a record of this type.  There is no default, but a value of  <b>FTPProxyUser</b>  is  recommended.
              See also <b>LDAPBaseDN,</b> <b>LDAPIdentifier,</b> <b>LDAPServer</b> options.

       <b>LDAPServer</b>
              Global  context  only.   This  is  the main option for using an <b>LDAP</b> directory for retrieving user
              specific values.  If given, it denotes the server (and possible port separated by a  colon)  where
              FTP-Proxy  will  ask  for  the attributes.  The program will bind as the anonymous user and try to
              retrieve the values from the tree rooted at <b>LDAPBaseDN,</b> having an object class of  <b>LDAPObjectClass</b>
              and  identified  by  the <b>LDAPIdentifier.</b>  If the server cannot be reached, the program aborts.  If
              the user cannot be found, the program falls back to the configuration file, but  will  query  only
              the   global   values   and  not  the  user  specific  ones.   See  also  <b>LDAPBaseDN,</b>  <b>LDAPBindDN,</b>
              <b>LDAPIdentifier,</b> <b>LDAPObjectClass</b> options.

       <b>LDAPVersion</b>
              Global context only. Use this option to set the LDAP API version, the proxy should set:  2  or  3.
              Use  0  to  skip  explicit  version  setting  and  use library defaults.  Defaults is version 3 if
              supported by the library or 2 if not.
              Note: OpenLDAP 2.x library defaults to version 2 bind, but the OpenLDAP server refuses LDAPv2 bind
              by default.

       <b>Listen</b> Global context only.  Defines the address where the proxy itself opens the  listening  port.   The
              default is <b>0.0.0.0</b> which instructs the server to bind to any address.  See also <b>Port</b> option.

       <b>LogDestination</b>
              Global  context  only.   Defines  the destination of the logging information the program wishes to
              emit.  If the value starts with a slash (/) it will be interpreted as an absolute path.  This file
              will be created and kept open during the lifetime of the process.  The signal <b>SIGUSR1</b> can be  sent
              to the (daemon) process in order to rotate this log file.

              A  second  way  to  provide  logging is via a pipe and is employed when the first character of the
              option is a pipe symbol (|).  In this case the rest of the value is interpreted as the name  of  a
              UNIX command which is invoked and receives logging information on its standard input.

              The  third  way is to use the <b><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a>(3)</b> service which is assumed for all other values.  The option
              value is interpreted as the syslog facility while the severity is defined by the various  messages
              themselves.

       <b>LogLevel</b>
              Global  context  only.  Defines the maximal level of logged messages.  The levels are, in order of
              decreasing importance: <b>FLT,</b> <b>ERR,</b> <b>WRN,</b> <b>INF,</b> <b>DBG</b>
              The default level is <b>INF.</b>  A <b>LogLevel</b> set to <b>WRN</b> causes, that only messages with levels <b>FLT,</b>  <b>ERR,</b>
              <b>WRN</b> will be logged.

       <b>MaxClients</b>
              Global  context  only.   Defines  the maximum number of clients the proxy will allow concurrently.
              The valid range for this option is 1 to 512, with a default of 64.   See  also  <b>MaxClientsMessage,</b>
              <b>MaxClientsString</b> options.

       <b>MaxClientsMessage</b>
              Global  context  only.   Defines  the name of a file that is displayed to clients if their maximum
              number defined with <b>MaxClients</b> has been exceeded. If no such file exists only the <b>MaxClientsString</b>
              is displayed, else both  the  file  and  the  string  are  transmitted.   After  transmission  the
              connection  is  terminated  in any case.  When sending the file, each line is prefixed with <b>'421-'</b>
              and variable substitution is applied to it.  See also <b>MaxClients,</b> <b>MaxClientsString</b> options.

       <b>MaxClientsString</b>
              Global context only.  Defines a string that will be displayed to clients, prefixed with <b>'421</b> <b>'</b> and
              variable substitution applied, if the maximum client number has been  exceeded.   The  default  is
              <b>'Service</b> <b>not</b> <b>available'</b> <b>.</b>  See also <b>MaxClients,</b> <b>MaxClientsMessage</b> options.

       <b>MaxRecvBufSize</b>
              Global  context  only.  Defines  the  maximum  number of bytes read from socket at once while data
              transfers. Default is to read all data as reported by the kernel.
              It may be useful to set a limit (i.e. to 8192), if your  proxy  machine  uses  two  interfaces  of
              different  speed,  i.e. the clients are accessing the proxy via a high-speed interface (i.e. Fast-
              Ethernet) and the proxy is accessing servers using a slower one (i.e. modem, ISDN link)  and  your
              ftp-clients aborts the data transfers because of a timeout.

       <b>PassiveMaxDataPort</b>
              Both  user  and global context.  Defines the maximum local port number used when listening for the
              client's data connection.  This is the port number transmitted to the client in a <b>227</b> response  to
              the  <b>PASV</b>  command.   If either minimum or maximum value is not given, the program defaults to let
              the system choose an arbitrary ephemeral port.  See also <b>PassiveMinDataPort</b> option.

       <b>PassiveMinDataPort</b>
              Both user and global context.  Defines the minimum local port number used when listening  for  the
              client's data connection.  See also <b>PassiveMaxDataPort</b> option.

       <b>PidFile</b>
              Global context only.  Defines the name of a process ID file where FTP-Proxy will store its process
              ID  if  running as daemon.  The file contents will be an ASCII string with a trailing newline.  On
              many operating systems such PID files will be located in the <b><a href="file:/var/run">/var/run</a></b> directory.

       <b>Port</b>   Global context only.  Defines the listening port where the FTP-Proxy offers its service.  The port
              can be given as a number or as a string suitable for retrieval by the  <b><a href="../man3/getservbyname.3.html">getservbyname</a>(3)</b>  function.
              It defaults to port 21, the <b>ftp</b> port as per <b>RFC</b> <b>959.</b>  See also <b>Listen</b> option.

       <b>PortResetsPasv</b>
              Global  context  only.   Defines  the action that is taken when a <b>PORT</b> command is received while a
              passive port is open for listening.  If the option is set to <b>yes,</b> <b>true,</b> or <b>on,</b> (which is also  the
              default)  the  socket  will be closed and the passive mode will be terminated (set to active-ftp).
              Setting the option to <b>no,</b> <b>false,</b> or <b>off</b> does not cancel the listen.   This  flag  seems  necessary
              because the RFC is not really clear enough about the correct handling.

       <b>SameAddress</b>
              Both user and global context.  Defines a boolean value which determines if the proxy is allowed to
              be  included  in  so-called  third party server to server transfers.  In this situation the client
              first sends a <b>PASV</b> command to one server, then a <b>PORT</b> command with the response code to the second
              server, and then initiates the  transfer  with  mutual  transfer  commands  on  the  two  servers.
              Specifying  this  option  as  <b>no,</b>  <b>false,</b> or <b>off</b> allows FTP-Proxy to take part in such a transfer,
              while saying <b>yes,</b> <b>true,</b> or <b>on</b> (the default) will  enforce  that  transfers  can  only  take  place
              to/from the client itself.

       <b>ServerRoot</b>
              Defines  the  directory  into  which  the  FTP-Proxy performs a <b><a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot</a>(2)</b> in order to increase its
              security level. See also the <b>User</b> and <b>Group</b> options.

              Note, that you have to copy needed libraries, configuration files, etc into this directory first!

       <b>ServerType</b>
              Global context only.  Defines the mode in which the FTP-Proxy is running if no command line switch
              <b>(-d/-i)</b> has been provided.  The option value can either be <b>inetd</b> in which case the  proxy  expects
              the  client  to be available at standard input and output, or it can be <b>standalone</b> which means the
              process will become a daemon, open the listening port and fork  child  processes  for  all  future
              connections.   The  child  processes  themselves  will behave exactly as if they were started from
              inetd.

       <b>SockBindRand</b>
              Global context only.  Defines a flag that when set to <b>yes,</b> <b>true,</b> or <b>on</b> , causes the proxy to use a
              random port in the  specified  range  via  DestinationMinPort/MaxPort,  ActiveMinPort/MaxDataPort,
              PassiveMinDataPort/MaxDataPort instead of increment the port number inside of this range. See also
              <b>DestinationMinPort,</b>  <b>DestinationMaxPort,</b>  <b>PassiveMinDataPort,</b>  <b>PassiveMaxDataPort,</b>  <b>ActiveMinPort,</b>
              <b>ActiveMaxPort</b> options.

       <b>TCPWrapper</b>
              Global context only.  Defines a boolean value which is evaluated by the  FTP-Proxy  running  as  a
              standalone  daemon  only.   Saying  <b>yes,</b> <b>true,</b> or <b>on</b> activate the <b>TCP</b> <b>Wrapper</b> library, whereas <b>no,</b>
              <b>false,</b> or <b>off</b> (the default) disable the function. See also <b>TCPWrapperName</b> option.

       <b>TCPWrapperName</b>
              Global context only.  Use given <b>name</b> for TCP-Wrapper checks instead of the program name (argv[0]).
              See also <b>TCPWrapper</b> option.

       <b>TimeOut</b>
              Both user and global context.  Defines the time in seconds after which a client is assumed  to  be
              disconnected.   If  no  activity  is  detected  from the client after this time, the connection is
              closed and the process terminates.  Default value is 900 seconds.

       <b>TranslatedAddress</b>
              Global context only.  Defines an IP address the server will use in <b>227</b> replies  to  <b>PASV</b>  commands
              instead  of its own address.  Usually the address where the client connected to is taken, but this
              may not be appropriate in situations where an NAT (Network Address Translation) device is  located
              in the way from the client to the proxy.  In this situation the response can be changed to include
              the input address of the NAT device.

              The value for this option can be given as a DNS host name, as a dotted decimal IP address, or as a
              file  name.   The  latter  is  assumed  when the name starts with a slash.  The file is opened and
              scanned for the desired address.  Blank lines or lines starting with '#' are ignored.  Reading the
              address from a file may be useful for environments with masquerading and dynamic PPP connections.

       <b>User</b>   Global context only.  Defines the UNIX style user ID which is  given  to  the  process  before  it
              serves clients.  Default is to keep the current real user ID.

              If  the  proxy does not run as a privileged user (root, user ID 0), it has no permission to bind a
              socket  to  port  &lt;  1024  or  to  preform  a  <b><a href="../man2/chroot.2.html">chroot</a>(2)</b>  call.    See   also   <b>ActiveMinDataPort,</b>
              <b>ActiveMaxDataPort,</b> <b>ServerRoot</b> options.

       <b>UserMagicChar</b> <b>or</b> <b>UseMagicChar</b>
              Global context only. Defines the character to use as separator between user and host[:port] in the
              target  setting  of  <b>AllowMagicUser</b>  Default  is  the '@' character. This allows you to use E-Mail
              addresses as usernames for login to the ftp server (i.e. me@mydomain%ftp.server:21 if you  set  it
              to %).

       <b>UserAuthMagic</b>
              Global context only. This is an authentication extension like AllowMagicUser, allowing encoding of
              additional  username  and password in the USER and PASS commands for authentication.  Valid values
              are   <b>@auth</b>   for    ftpuser@authuser[@host:port]    and    ftppass@authpass    or    <b>auth@</b>    for
              authuser@[ftpuser@host:port]   and   authpass@ftppass.   See  also  <b>LDAPBindDN,</b>  <b>LDAPAuthType</b>  and
              <b>AllowMagicUser.</b>

       <b>UserAuthType</b>
              Global context only. Defines the authentication mechanism the proxy should use.  Currently  "ldap"
              is implemented to support simple LDAP authentication using FTP username and password from USER and
              PASS  commands  or  the  special  authuser  and  authpass  encoded  using <b>UserAuthMagic.</b>  See also
              <b>LDAPBindDN,</b> <b>LDAPAuthDN,</b> <b>LDAPAuthPWAttr,</b> <b>LDAPAuthPWType,</b> <b>LDAPAuthOKFlag</b> and <b>UserAuthMagic</b> options.

       <b>UserNameRule</b>
              Global context only. Defines a regular expression rule for validation of the user name  (used  for
              profile-setup and authentication purposes). Defaults to:

              <b>^[[:alnum:]]+([%20@/\._-][[:alnum:]]+)*$</b>

              It  checks,  if  the first character is alphanumeric, optionally followed by @/_-. or alphanumeric
              characters and ending with an alphanumeric one.

              This matches the usual cases inclusive E-Mail addresses and "domain/user" names.

              If regex support is not available, above default rule is still used and the  option  ignored.  See
              also <b>ValidCommands</b> option for regex encoding description.

       <b>ValidCommands</b>
              Both  user  and global context.  Defines the list of allowed FTP commands for the client.  If this
              option is not installed, there will be no restriction on the  allowed  commands.   But  if  it  is
              given,  then  all  commands  not on this list will be denied.  The list is space separated and may
              consist of the following commands: <b>USER,</b> <b>PASS,</b> <b>ACCT,</b> <b>CWD,</b> <b>CDUP,</b>  <b>SMNT,</b>  <b>QUIT,</b>  <b>REIN,</b>  <b>PORT,</b>  <b>PASV,</b>
              <b>TYPE,</b> <b>STRU,</b> <b>MODE,</b> <b>RETR,</b> <b>STOR,</b> <b>STOU,</b> <b>APPE,</b> <b>ALLO,</b> <b>REST,</b> <b>RNFR,</b> <b>RNTO,</b> <b>ABOR,</b> <b>DELE,</b> <b>RMD,</b> <b>MKD,</b> <b>PWD,</b> <b>LIST,</b>
              <b>NLST,</b>  <b>SITE,</b>  <b>SYST,</b>  <b>STAT,</b> <b>HELP,</b> <b>NOOP,</b> <b>SIZE,</b> <b>MDTM,</b> <b>MLFL,</b> <b>MAIL,</b> <b>MSND,</b> <b>MSOM,</b> <b>MSAM,</b> <b>MRSQ,</b> <b>MRCP,</b> <b>XCWD,</b>
              <b>XMKD,</b> <b>XRMD,</b> <b>XPWD,</b> <b>XCUP,</b> <b>AUTH,</b> <b>APSV,</b> <b>EPRT,</b> and <b>EPSV.</b>

              Each command can be followed by  an  optional  equals  sign  and  <b>POSIX</b>  <b>1003.2</b>  <b>Extended</b>  <b>Regular</b>
              <b>Expression</b>  <b>(RE)</b>  that describes the valid argument(s) for the command.  If the whole string is to
              be matched, the pattern has to start with a caret (^) and end with a dollar ($).   If  no  pattern
              follows  a  command,  its  arguments  are not checked.  An example for a name would be the pattern
              <b>'^[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,512}$'</b> for an argument that is mandatory and may consist of up to 512  letters  or
              digits  only.   A  command  that  does  not  allow  any  arguments can also easily be represented:
              <b>'QUIT=^$'</b> <b>.</b>

              Please note that the regular expression is "pre-processed".  This means that a pattern in the form
              %xx will be interpreted as a hexadecimal constant and will  be  replaced  by  the  value  of  that
              constant.  This looks a bit like HTML and helps to include characters that might not be handled as
              expected,  like  %20  for space or %5c (equivalent to %5C) for backslash.  The space is especially
              important because it is the separator for the commands within the list itself.

              Please note also that regular expression support must have  been  enabled  with  the  <b>--with-regex</b>
              switch during the <b>configure</b> compilation step of the whole package.

       <b>WelcomeMessage</b>
              Global  context  only.   Defines  the  name of a file that will be displayed to all clients as the
              first action when they open the control  connection.   Each  line  is  prefixed  with  <b>'220-'</b>  and
              variable  substitution is applied to it.  If no such file exists it is silently ignored.  See also
              <b>WelcomeString</b> option.

       <b>WelcomeString</b>
              Global context only.  Defines the string that is sent to  the  client  in  order  to  start  login
              negotiation.   The  string is prefixed with <b>'220</b> <b>'</b> and variable substitution is applied to it.  If
              this option is not given it defaults to the following string:
              <b>'%h</b> <b>FTP</b> <b>server</b> <b>(%v</b> <b>-</b> <b>%b)</b> <b>ready'.</b>
              See also <b>WelcomeMessage</b> option.
