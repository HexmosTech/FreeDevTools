       dictionary - RADIUS dictionary file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  master  RADIUS  dictionary  file  resides  in  <u>/etc/freeradius/3.0/dictionary</u>.   It references other
       <u>dictionary</u> files located in <u>/usr/share/freeradius/</u>.  Each dictionary  file  contains  a  list  of  RADIUS
       attributes  and values, which the server uses to map between descriptive names and on-the-wire data.  The
       names have no meaning outside of the RADIUS server itself, and are never  exchanged  between  server  and
       clients.

       That  is,  editing the dictionaries will have NO EFFECT on anything other than the server that is reading
       those files.  Adding new attributes to the dictionaries will have NO EFFECT on RADIUS clients,  and  will
       not  make  RADIUS  clients  magically understand those attributes.  The dictionaries are solely for local
       administrator convenience, and are specific to each version of FreeRADIUS.

       The dictionaries in <u><a href="file:/usr/share">/usr/share</a></u> SHOULD NOT be edited unless you know exactly what you are doing.  Changing
       them will most likely break your RADIUS deployment.

       If you need to add new attributes,  please  edit  the  <u>/etc/freeradius/3.0/dictionary</u>  file.   It's  sole
       purpose is to contain site-local definitions that are added by the local administrator.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Every line starting with a hash sign ('<b>#</b>') is treated as comment and ignored.

       Each line of the file can contain one of the following strings:

       <b>ATTRIBUTE</b> <b>name</b> <b>oid</b> <b>type</b> <b>[flags]</b>
            Define a RADIUS attribute name to number mapping.

            The <u>name</u> field is a printable field, taken from various specifications or vendor definitions.  It is
            most  commonly  used as a series of words, separated by hyphens.  e.g. "User-Name".  Vendor-specific
            attributes (VSAs) are prefixed by the  vendor  name,  e.g.  "Cisco-AVPair".   The  names  should  be
            globally unique, as they are used as a key to look up the properties of the attribute.

            The  <u>oid</u>  field  is  taken  from  the  relevant specification for that name.  In most cases, it is a
            decimal number, such as "256".  For certain attributes, a "dotted number"  notation  is  used,  e.g.
            "1.2".  The "dotted number" notation is used only for certain attributes.

            The <u>type</u> field can be one of the standard types:

                 string       UTF-8 printable text (the RFCs call this "text")
                 octets       opaque binary data (the RFCs call this "string")
                 ipaddr       IPv4 address
                 date         Seconds since January 1, 1970 (32-bits)
                 integer      32-bit unsigned integer
                 ipv6addr     IPv6 Address
                 ipv6prefix   IPV6 prefix, with mask
                 ifid         Interface Id (hex:hex:hex:hex)
                 integer64   64-bit unsigned integer

            The <u>type</u> field can be one of the following non-standard types:

                 ether        Ethernet MAC address
                 abinary      Ascend binary filter format
                 byte         8-bit unsigned integer
                 short        16-bit unsigned integer
                 signed       31-bit signed integer (packed into 32-bit field)
                 tlv          Type-Length-Value (allows nested attributes)
                 ipv4prefix   IPv4 Prefix as given in RFC 6572.

            The  last  (optional) field of an attribute definition are additional flags for that attribute, in a
            comma-separated list.  Previous versions of the server allowed these flags to include a vendor name.
            This behavior may still work, but it is deprecated, and is not recommended.

            The options are:

                 array        Multiple values are packed into one attribute.
                 concat      Multiple attributes should be concatenated
                 encrypt=#    set encryption type 1, 2, or 3.
                 has_tag      The attribute can have an RFC 2868 style tag
                 secret      A value which should not be printed in debug mode
                 virtual      The attribute is special to the server.

            The "array" flag is only used for DHCP.  It indicates that a DHCP option can  contain  an  array  of
            multiple values.

            The  "concat"  flags  indicates  that when multiple attributes are present in a packet, the contents
            should be concatenated together to get the final contents.  Similarly, when encoding packets, a long
            value should be split into multiple attributes.

            The "encrypt" flag marks the attribute as being encrypted with one of three possible  methods.   "1"
            means  that  the  attribute is encrypted with the method as defined in <u>RFC2865</u> for the User-Password
            attribute.  "2" means that the password is encrypted with the method as defined in <u>RFC2868</u>  for  the
            Tunnel-Password  attribute.   "3"  means that the attribute is encrypted as per Ascend's definitions
            for the Ascend-Send-Secret attribute.

            The "has_tag" flag marks the attribute as being permitted to have a tag, as defined in <u>RFC2868</u>.  The
            purpose of the tag is to allow grouping of attributes for tunneled  users.   See  <u>RFC2868</u>  for  more
            details.

            The  "secret"  flag  indicates that the value should not be printed in normal debug mode.  The value
            will be printed when the debug level is 3 or higher.

            The "virtual" flag is for the server, and indicates  that  the  attribute  does  not  really  exist.
            Instead, the value is taken from an internal callback.

            When  the  server  receives  an  encoded attribute in a RADIUS packet, it looks up that attribute by
            number in the dictionary, and uses the definition  found  there  for  printing  diagnostic  and  log
            messages.   When  the  server  sees  an  attribute  name  in  a configuration file, it looks up that
            attribute by name in the dictionary, and uses the definition found there.

       <b>VALUE</b> <b>attribute-name</b> <b>value-name</b> <b>number</b>
            Define an attribute value name to number mapping, for an attribute of type <u>integer</u>.  The  <u>attribute-</u>
            <u>name</u>  field  MUST be previously defined by an <u>ATTRIBUTE</u> entry.  The <u>value-name</u> field can be any non-
            space text, but is usually taken from <u>RFC2865</u>, or other documents..  The <u>number</u> field is also  taken
            from the relevant documents, for that name.

            When  the  server  receives  an  encoded  value  in  a  RADIUS packet, it looks up the value of that
            attribute by number in the dictionary, and uses the name found there for printing diagnostic and log
            messages.

       <b>VENDOR</b> <b>vendor-name</b> <b>number</b> <b>[format=...]</b>
            Define a Vendor Specific Attribute encapsulation for <u>vendor-name</u> to <u>number</u>.  For a  list  of  vendor
            names and numbers, see <a href="http://www.iana.org/enterprise-numbers.txt">http://www.iana.org/enterprise-numbers.txt</a>.

            The  "format=t,l"  statement  tells  the  server  how many octets to use to encode/decode the vendor
            "type" and "length" fields in the attributes.  The default is "format=1,1", which does not  have  to
            be  specified.   For  USR VSA's, the format is "format=4,0", for Lucent VSA's it's "format=2,1", and
            for Starent VSA's it's "format=2,2".

            The supported values for the number of type octets (i.e. the first digit) are  1,  2,  and  4.   The
            support  values  for  the  number  of  length  octets  (i.e. the second digit) are 0, 1, and 2.  Any
            combination of those values will work.

       <b>BEGIN-VENDOR</b> <b>vendor-name</b>
            Define the start of  a  block  of  Vendor-Specific  attributes.   All  of  the  following  <u>ATTRIBUTE</u>
            definitions  are  interpreted  as  being for the named vendor, until the block is closed by an "END-
            VENDOR" statement.

            This practice is preferred to placing the vendor name at the end of an <u>ATTRIBUTE</u>  definition.

            For VSAs in the RFC 6929 "Extended vendor-specific" space, a format can be specified  following  the
            "vendor-name".   The format should be "format=Extended-Vendor-Specific-1", through "format=Extended-
            Vendor-Specific-6".  The matching "END-VENDOR" should  just  have  the  "vendor-name",  without  the
            format string.

       <b>END-VENDOR</b> <b>vendor-name</b>
            End a previously defined BEGIN-VENDOR block.  The "vendor-name" must match.

       <b>$INCLUDE</b> <b>filename</b>
            Include  dictionary  entries  from  the  file  <u>filename</u>.   The  <u>filename</u> is taken as relative to the
            location of the file which is asking for the inclusion.

       <b>BEGIN-TLV</b> <b>name</b>
            This feature is supported for backwards compatibility with older dictionaries.   It  should  not  be
            used.  The new "oid" form for defining the attribute number should be used instead.

       <b>END-TLV</b> <b>name</b>
            This  feature  is  supported  for backwards compatibility with older dictionaries.  It should not be
            used.  The new "oid" form for defining the attribute number should be used instead.
