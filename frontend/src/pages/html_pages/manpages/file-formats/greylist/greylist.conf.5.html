</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>greylist.conf</b> - milter-greylist configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>greylist.conf</b> configures <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b> operation. The format is simple: each line contains a keyword
       and optional arguments. Any line starting with a # is considered as a comment and is ignored. Blank lines
       are  ignored  as well. Comments at the end of lines are accepted in some situations, but do not take them
       as granted.  A statement can be continued on the next line by  using  a  backslash.  Anything  after  the
       backslash will be ignored.

</pre><h4><b>WHITELIST</b></h4><pre>
       The  primary  use  of  <b>greylist.conf</b>  is  to  setup  <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b> whitelist. It also offers a handy
       blacklist feature.  Access-lists (ACL) are used to do that.  ACL  enable  the  administrator  to  specify
       complex conditions on sender IP, sender DNS address, sender e-mail address, and recipient e-mail address.
       If support for DNSRBL was built-in, it is even possible to use DNSRBL in ACL.

       An  access-list  entry  starts  with  the <u>racl</u> keyword followed by an optional id quoted string, then the
       <u>greylist</u>, <u>whitelist</u>, <u>blacklist</u>, or <u>continue</u> keyword, and by any  set  of  the  following  clauses:  <u>addr</u>,
       <u>domain</u>, <u>from</u>, <u>rawfrom</u>, <u>rcpt</u>, <u>rcptcount</u>, <u>helo</u>, <u>sm_macro</u>, <u>time</u>, <u>auth</u>, <u>tls</u>, <u>spf</u> (if build with SPF support),
       <u>geoip</u>  (if  build  with GeoIP support), <u>p0f</u> (if build with p0f support), <u>ldapcheck</u> (if build with --with-
       openldap), <u>urlcheck</u> (if built with --with-libcurl), <u>dnsrbl</u> (if built with --enable-dnsrbl), and  <u>nsupdate</u>
       (if  supported  by the DNS resolver).  A message will match an ACL entry when it complies with all of its
       clauses.

       The <u>greylist</u>, <u>whitelist</u>, and <u>blacklist</u> keywords will cause the message  to  be  respectively  greylisted,
       accepted  or  rejected  if  all ACL clauses match, and ACL evaluation is terminated there. If an ACL with
       <u>continue</u> keyword does match, nothing is decided and next ACL are evaluated.

       Clauses can be negated, by prefixing them by the <u>not</u> keyword. Here is the detail of all possible clauses.

       <u>addr</u>   This clause is used to specify a netblock of source IP addresses. The  syntax  is  an  IP  address
              followed by a slash and a CIDR netmask. Here is an example:

                racl whitelist addr 127.0.0.0/8
                racl whitelist addr 192.168.3.0/24
                racl whitelist addr ::1

              If  the  netmask  is  omitted,  /32 is assumed for an IPv4 address and /128 is assumed for an IPv6
              address.

              You should at least  whitelist  localhost  (127.0.0.1/8),  and  if  you  have  some  user  clients
              connecting  to the machine, you should whitelist the addresses they connect from if you don't want
              them to get error messages when sending e-mail.

       <u>domain</u> This clause selects source machines based on their DNS name,  performing  a  suffix  search.   For
              instance, this will whitelist any machine in the <u>example.net</u> domain:

                racl whitelist domain example.net

              Suffix search matching  means, for example, that gle.com will match google.com. If you want domain
              names  to match on subdomain boundaries (e.g.  gle.com will match mail.gle.com and gle.com but not
              google.com) then enable <u>domainexact</u>

       The name resolution is made by Sendmail, which hands it  to  <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b>.   As  a  result,  it  is
       impossible  to  use  DNS aliases here. On the other hand, this will work even if your DNS resolver is not
       thread-safe.

       <u>from</u>   This is used to select sender e-mail addresses You should not use that feature, because sender  e-
              mail addresses can be trivially forged.

              Please  note  that the sender e-mail is cleared from spaces and anything leading an equal (=) sign
              so that mailing-lists return-address with unique return  paths  can  still  match.   If  you  need
              unedited sender address, use a <u>rawfrom</u> clause.

              Here is an example:

                racl whitelist from <a href="mailto:postmaster@example.com">postmaster@example.com</a>

       <u>rawfrom</u>
              Same as <u>from</u> but the sender e-mail address is not modified to stip anything.  <u>rcpt</u> This is used to
              select recipient addresses. Example:

                racl greylist rcpt <a href="mailto:John.Doe@example.net">John.Doe@example.net</a>

       <u>rcptcount</u>
              Followed  by  an  operator and a recipient count, this is used to select the amount of recipients.
              Example:

                racl blacklist rcptcount &gt;= 25 msg "No more than 25 recipients, please"

       <u>helo</u>   Followed by a quoted string or a regular expression, this can  be  used  to  filter  on  the  HELO
              string.

       <u>sm_macro</u>
              This is used to select a Sendmail macro value. See the section on that topic for more information.

       <u>time</u>   This  is  used  to specify a time set. It should be followed by a quoted string of <b><a href="../man5/crontab.5.html">crontab</a>(5)</b>-like
              time specification. Here is an example that whitelists mail addressed to a single recipient during
              office hours (from 8:00 to 16:59 from monday to friday):

                racl whitelist time "* 8-16 * * 1-5" rcpt <a href="mailto:info@example.net">info@example.net</a>

       <u>geoip</u>  This is used to specify a country, as reported by GeoIP. The country code must be upper case,  and
              is only available if <b>milter-greylist</b> was built with GeoIP support. Special country code <b>ZZ</b> is used
              when  the  country  cannot  be  determined (this happens for private addresses, for instance). The
              <u>geoipdb</u> statement can be used to specify the location of GeoIP database.  <u>geoipv6db</u> statement  can
              be  used  to  specify the location of GeoIPv6 database.  <u>geoip2db</u> statement can be used to specify
              the location of GeoIP2 (maxminddb) database.

       <u>p0f</u>    This is used to match against the remote system OS fingerprint genre and detail,obtained from p0f.
              It is only available if <b>milter-greylist</b> was built with p0f support.  <u>p0f</u> clauses can be used  with
              a  quoted string for case-insensitive substring match, or against regular expressions. The <u>p0fsock</u>
              statement can be used to specify the location of the p0f socket.

       <u>auth</u>   This is used to select a user that succeeded SMTP AUTH. In order to select any user that  succeeds
              SMTP AUTH, you can use a regular expression matching, like below;

                racl whitelist auth <a href="file:/.">/.</a>*/

              Using  such a clause automatically disable global STARTTLS and SMTP AUTH whitelisting, like if the
              <u>noauth</u> keyword would have been used.

       <u>tls</u>    This is used to select the distinguished name (DN) of a user that succeeded STARTTLS. Using such a
              clause automatically disable global STARTTLS and  SMTP  AUTH  whitelisting,  like  if  the  <u>noauth</u>
              keyword would have been used.

       <u>spf</u>    This  is  used  to  test  SPF  status. Possible values are <u>pass</u>, <u>softfail</u>, <u>fail</u>, <u>neutral</u>, <u>unknown</u>,
              <u>error</u>, <u>none</u>, and <u>self</u>.  The first seven values are plain SPF validation status. The <u>self</u> value  is
              a  special test that checks the server's local IP address against the sender's SPF record. If that
              test validates, odds are good that the sender SPF record is wide open, and this is hint  that  SPF
              should not be trusted.

              In  order to use <u>spf</u> <u>self</u>, Postfix users must specify the local address in the configuration file,
              using the <u>localaddr</u> option.

              Absence of any value after the <u>spf</u> keyword is a  synonym  for  <u>spf</u>  <u>pass</u>.   This  is  present  for
              backward compatibility.

              The  <u>spf</u> clause is only available if SPF support was compiled in. Using it will disable global SPF
              whitelisting, like if the <u>nospf</u> keyword would have been used.

       <u>ldapcheck</u>
              This is used to query an LDAP directory.  See the section on that topic for more information.

       <u>urlcheck</u>
              This is used to query an external configuration source through an URL.  See the  section  on  that
              topic for more information.

       <u>dnsrbl</u> This is used to select a DNSRBL. See the section on that topic for more information.

       <u>nsupdate</u>
              This  always-matching  clause  performs  a  DNS  update,  see  the  section on that topic for more
              information.

       The <u>domain</u>, <u>from</u>, and <u>rcpt</u> clauses may be used with regular expressions. The regular expressions must  be
       enclosed by slashes (/). No escaping is available to provide a slash inside a regular expression, so just
       do not use it. Regular expressions follow the format described in <b><a href="../man7/re_format.7.html">re_format</a>(7)</b>.  Here is an example:

         racl greylist rcpt /@example\.net$/

       When  regular  expressions  are  not used, <u>from</u>, and <u>rcpt</u> perform a case insensitive substring match with
       leading and trailing brackets, spaces and tabs stripped out.  <u>domain</u> performs a case  insensitive  suffix
       match.  This means, for example, that gle.com will match google.com. If you want domain names to match on
       subdomain  boundaries  (e.g.  gle.com will match mail.gle.com and gle.com but not google.com) then enable
       <u>domainexact</u>

       An ACL entry can also hold various optional parameter used on match: <u>delay</u>, <u>autowhite</u>, <u>flushaddr</u>,  <u>nolog</u>,
       <u>code</u>, <u>ecode</u>, <u>report</u>, <u>maxpeek</u>, <u>addheader</u>, <u>addfooter</u>, and <u>msg</u>

       <u>delay</u>  Specify  the  greylisting  delay  used  before  the  message  can be accepted.  This overrides the
              <u>greylist</u> global setting, and it only  makes sense on an <u>racl</u> <u>greylist</u> entry.

       <u>autowhite</u>
              Specify the autowhitelisting  duration  for  messages  matching  this  ACL.   This  overrides  the
              <u>autowhite</u> global setting, and it only makes sense on an <u>racl</u> <u>greylist</u> entry. Example:

                racl greylist rcpt <a href="mailto:JDoe@example.net">JDoe@example.net</a> delay 15m autowhite 3d
                racl greylist rcpt <a href="mailto:root@example.net">root@example.net</a> delay 1h autowhite 3d

       <u>flushaddr</u>
              If  a  message  matches  the  rule,  any entry in the greylist or autowhite databases matching the
              sender IP is removed. Used with a DNSRBL blacklist ACL, it is useful for freeing the database from
              entries set up by a machine which is known to be a spammer. Example:

                racl blacklist dnsrbl "known-spammer" flushaddr

       <u>nolog</u>  Do not generate syslog message if this rule matches. Example:

                racl whitelist default nolog

       <u>code</u>

       <u>ecode</u>

       <u>msg</u>    These 3 values can be used to choose the SMTP code, extended code and reply message for  temporary
              failures and rejects. Example:

                racl blacklist dnsrbl "spamstomp" msg "IP caught by spamstomp"
                racl greylist default code "451" ecode "4.7.1"

              The  <u>msg</u>  strings  accepts format string substitution as documented in the <b>FORMAT</b> <b>STRINGS</b> section.
              For instance, <u>%A</u> gets substituted by the ACL line number.

              None of the last 3 values makes sense for a whitelist entry.

       <u>report</u> This value overrides the text displayed in  the  <u>X-Greylist</u>  header,  for  messages  that  <b><a href="../man8/miltergreylist.8.html">milter-</a></b>
              <b><a href="../man8/miltergreylist.8.html">greylist</a>(8)</b>  lets  pass  through,  either  because  they  are  whitelisted, or because they passed
              greylisting (see <b>REPORTING</b>).  This string can be substituted as documented in the  <b>FORMAT</b>  <b>STRINGS</b>
              section.

       <u>maxpeek</u>
              This  parameter  only makes sense in a RCPT-stage ACL. It overrides the global <u>maxpeek</u> setting for
              DATA-stage handling of the message. It has no effect if global <u>maxpeek</u> is set to 0.

       <u>addheader</u>
              This quoted string is a RFC822 header that gets added to the message.  Format string  substitution
              is supported. No check is done for header length standard compliance, so make sure the substituted
              string  is  shorter  than 2048 characters. Headers are appended to the bottom, unless an optionnal
              comma-separated positive index is specified after the quoted string; in this case the header  will
              be inserted at this index point from the top. Here is an example:
              racl continue addheader "X-Personnal-Header: Hello world!",1

       <u>addfooter</u>
              Append  a  footer  to  the  message.  Usual escape sequences such as \n can be used to get special
              characters. The string is subject to format string expantion as described in  the  <b>FORMAT</b>  <b>STRINGS</b>
              section.  The  footer  will  not  be  append  if <u>milter-greylist</u> was not able to capture the whole
              message, therefore <u>maxpeek</u> must be set approriately.

       Entries in the access-list are evaluated sequentially, so order is very  important.  The  first  matching
       entry  is  used to decide if a message will be whitelisted or greylisted. A special <u>default</u> clause can be
       used in the last ACL entry as a wildcard.  Here are a few complete ACL examples:

       Example 1:

       racl whitelist from <a href="mailto:friend@toto.com">friend@toto.com</a> rcpt <a href="mailto:grandma@example.com">grandma@example.com</a>
       racl whitelist from <a href="mailto:other.friend@example.net">other.friend@example.net</a> rcpt <a href="mailto:grandma@example.com">grandma@example.com</a>
       racl greylist rcpt <a href="mailto:grandma@example.com">grandma@example.com</a>
       racl whitelist default

       Example 2:

       racl whitelist addr 193.54.0.0/16 domain friendly.com
       racl greylist rcpt <a href="mailto:user1@atmine.com">user1@atmine.com</a>
       racl greylist rcpt <a href="mailto:user2@atmine.com">user2@atmine.com</a>
       racl greylist rcpt <a href="mailto:user3@atmine.com">user3@atmine.com</a>
       racl whitelist default

       Example 3:

       racl whitelist rcpt /@.*otherdomain\.org$/
       racl whitelist addr 192.168.42.0/24 rcpt <a href="mailto:user1@mydomain.org">user1@mydomain.org</a>
       racl whitelist from <a href="mailto:friend@example.net">friend@example.net</a> rcpt /@.*mydomain\.org$/
       racl whitelist rcpt <a href="mailto:user2@mydomain.org">user2@mydomain.org</a>
       racl greylist rcpt /@.*mydomain\.org$/
       racl whitelist default

</pre><h4><b>DATA-STAGE</b> <b>ACL</b></h4><pre>
       ACL using the <u>racl</u> keyword are evaluated at the RCPT stage of the SMTP transaction. It is  also  possible
       to  have  ACL  evaluated  at the DATA stage of the SMTP transaction, using the <u>dacl</u> keyword, provided the
       message went through RCPT-stage ACL, and possibly greylisting. Note that  you  cannot  use  the  <u>greylist</u>
       action  at  DATA-stage  if  the  RCPT-stage  ACL that matched had a <u>greylist</u> action itself. The following
       clauses can be used to work on message content:

       <u>dkim</u>   DKIM status (if build with DKIM support). Possible values are  <u>pass</u>,  <u>fail</u>,  <u>unknown</u>,  <u>error</u>,  and
              <u>none</u>,

       <u>header</u> String or regular expression searched in message headers

       <u>body</u>   String or regular expression searched in message body

       <u>msgsize</u>
              Operator followed by a message size (k or M suffix allowed for kilobytes or megabytes). Example:

                dacl blacklist msgsize &gt;= 4M msg "No more than 4 MB please"

       <u>spamd</u>  SpamAssassin score (if build with SpamAssassin support). If used without comparison operator <u>spamd</u>
              is true if the score is above threshold. The <u>spamdsock</u> keyword can be used to specify the location
              of the spamd socket.

              Example 1:

                spamdsock unix "/var/spamassassin/spamd.sock"
                racl whitelist default
                dacl greylist spamd

              Example 2:

                spamdsock inet "127.0.0.1:783"
                racl whitelist default
                dacl blacklist spamd &gt; 15 msg "Your message is considered spam."
                dacl greylist  spamd &gt; 10 delay 2h
                dacl greylist  spamd &gt; 5  delay 1h

       Note  that  if  there are multiple recipient, a <u>rcpt</u> clause at DATA stage evaluates to true if it matches
       any of them.  If you want to match an exact set of recipients, you can use multiple  <u>rcpt</u>  clauses  along
       with a <u>rcptcount</u> clause.

</pre><h4><b>LISTS</b></h4><pre>
       It  is  often useful to group several users or sender IP addresses in a single ACL. This can be done with
       lists. Lists must be first defined and given a name before they can be used in ACL entries.  Here  is  an
       example:

                list "my users" rcpt { <a href="mailto:user1@example.com">user1@example.com</a> <a href="mailto:user2@example.com">user2@example.com</a> }
                list "local" addr { 192.0.2.0/24 10.0.0.0/8 }

                racl whitelist list "local"
                racl greylist list "my users"
                racl whitelist default

</pre><h4><b>BACKWARD</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       Previous  versions  of  <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b>  used  <u>addr</u>,  <u>domain</u>,  <u>from</u>,  and <u>rcpt</u> lines, without the <u>racl</u>
       keyword.  Access-list management is intended to replace them.  These lines are still accepted by  <b><a href="../man8/miltergreylist.8.html">milter-</a></b>
       <b><a href="../man8/miltergreylist.8.html">greylist</a>(8)</b>,  but  they  are  deprecated.   <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b> handles them as access-list entries with a
       single clause. They are added at the head of the access-list so the use of  these  keywords  and  access-
       lists may lead to unspecified behaviour. Do not mix them.

       test mode (using <b>-T</b>) is also deprecated. Access-list semantics do not depend on this flag.

       <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b>  also used to only have a RCPT-stage ACL, which was configured through <u>acl</u> statements.
       These have been replaced by <u>racl</u> statements (as opposed to <u>dacl</u>  statements  for  DATA-stage  ACL).   <u>acl</u>
       statements are still accepted for backward compatibility and are a synonym for <u>racl</u> statements.

</pre><h4><b>MX</b> <b>SYNC</b></h4><pre>
       Synchronization  of  the greylist among multiple MX is configured using the <u>peer</u> keyword. List each other
       MX IP addresses using the <u>peer</u> keyword. Here is an example:

         peer 192.0.2.18
         peer 192.0.2.17
         peer 192.0.2.22 timeout 7
         peer 192.0.2.38 timeout 5m

       You can list the local machine in the peer statements, it will be ignored.

       The <u>timeout</u> clause sets a peer communication timeout to have proper retrial in case of slow MX peer.  The
       default value is 3 seconds. The special value of 0 disables the connection retrials.

       By default, milter-greylist will listen on all interfaces using TCP port 5252 or the port number given by
       service  named  mxglsync  if  defined  in <u><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></u> or other directory service. This behaviour can be
       changed by using the <u>syncaddr</u> keyword. Here are a few examples:

         syncaddr *
         syncaddr * port 7689
         syncaddr 192.0.2.2 port 9785
         syncaddr 2001:db8::1:c3b5:123
         syncaddr 2001:db8::1:c3b5:123 port 1234

       Using '*' as the address means to bind to all local interfaces' addresses.  Note  that  if  you  are  not
       using the default port, all MXs must use the same port number.

       For  outbound  connections  the  system is selecting one of the possible addresses.  If you want to use a
       specific IP you can use:

         syncsrcaddr 123.456.78.9

</pre><h4><b>TEXT</b> <b>DUMP</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b> uses a text dump of its database to resume  operation  after  a  crash.  The  dump  is
       performed  at  regular  time  interval,  but  as  it  is a heavy operation, you might want to configure a
       particular time interval, using the <u>dumpfreq</u> option.

       If the <u>dumpfreq</u> value is too small, it will kill performance. If it is too high, you will loose a  bigger
       part of the database on a crash.

       Set  <u>dumpfreq</u> to 0 to get a dump on each change (kills performance), Set it to -1 to never dump to a file
       (unsafe as you lose the whole greylist on each crash), or give a time value for the delay between  dumps.
       The time is given in seconds, except if a unit is given: m for minutes, h for hours, and d for days.

       You  may  further  improve  the  performance  of  the  dump  operation at the expense of humanly readable
       timestamp which by default appears as a comment at the end of each line in the dumpfile. You may  disable
       generation  of this comment by specifying <u>dump_no_time_translation</u> option in the configuration file. This
       is specifically recommended if your dumpfile grows to 100's of megabytes - it can reduce the time  needed
       for the dump operation by the order of magnitude!

</pre><h4><b>REPORTING</b></h4><pre>
       By  default,  <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b> will add a <u>X-Greylist</u> header to any message it handles. The header shows
       what happened to the message: delayed or not delayed, and why. The  following  options  can  be  used  in
       <b>greylist.conf</b> to alter this behavior:

       <u>report</u> <u>none</u>
              Never add a <u>X-Greylist</u> header.

       <u>report</u> <u>delays</u>
              Only add a header if the message was delayed.

       <u>report</u> <u>nodelays</u>
              Add a header if the message was not delayed. The header explains why the message was not delayed.

       <u>report</u> <u>all</u>
              Always add a header. This is the default.

</pre><h4><b>SENDER</b> <b>CALLBACK</b> <b>SYSTEMS</b></h4><pre>
       Sender  callback  systems are another anti-spam measure that attempts to send a DSN to the sender address
       before accepting a message. If that fails, then the sender address is wrong and the message is  rejected.
       Such systems usually stop their callback check at the RCPT stage of the SMTP transaction.

       Greylisting  temporarily rejects at the RCPT stage, so sender callback and greylisting love to fight each
       other.  <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b> proposes a workaround to that  problem  with  the  <u>delayedreject</u>  option.  For
       messages  coming  from  &lt;&gt;  (that  is, for DSN), it will cause the temporary reject to happen at the DATA
       stage of the SMTP transaction instead of the RCPT stage. That  way,  <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b>  will  cope  much
       better with sender callback systems.

       This  has  a  minor  drawback  (and this is why it is not enabled by default): for a multi recipient DSN,
       whitelisted recipient will not be honoured: the message will be delayed for everyone.

</pre><h4><b>SENDMAIL</b> <b>MACROS</b></h4><pre>
       Any sendmail macro can be used as a clause in the access list. You need to define a (macro,  value)  pair
       using  the  <u>sm_macro</u> keyword before using it.  Here is an example that uses the <u>{client_resolve}</u> macro to
       apply a larger greylisting delay to hosts that have a bogus reverse DNS:

                sm_macro "maybe_forged" "{client_resolve}" "FORGED"

                racl greylist sm_macro "maybe_forged" delay 1h
                racl greylist default delay 15m

       A regular expression can be used as the macro value.  It must be  surrounded  with  slashes  and  not  by
       quotes.  The special value <u>unset</u> can also be used to match an unset macro:

                sm_macro "not_foo" "{foo}" unset

       Note  that any Sendmail macro that is not exported using the <u>Milter.macros.envrcpt</u> setting of <u>sendmail.cf</u>
       will be seen as unset from milter-greylist.

</pre><h4><b>DNSRBL</b></h4><pre>
       DNS Reverse Black List can be used to toggle an ACL. They must be defined and named before  they  can  be
       used. Here is an example which uses a bigger greylisting delay for hosts caught in the SORBS dynamic pool
       DNRSBL (this will include DSL and cable customers pools, which are well known to be massively infected by
       spamwares):

                dnsrbl "SORBS DUN" dnsbl.sorbs.net 127.0.0.10/32

                racl greylist dnsrbl "SORBS DUN" delay 1h
                racl greylist default delay 15m

       The  definition  of a DNSRBL starts by the <u>dnsrbl</u> keyword, followed by the quoted name of the DNSRBL, the
       DNS domain on which addresses should be looked up, and the answer we should consider as a positive hit.

       DNSRBL support is only available if enabled through the --enable-dnsrbl config  flag.  Please  make  sure
       <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b> is linked against a thread-safe DNS resolver, otherwise it shall crash.

</pre><h4><b>DNS</b> <b>updates</b></h4><pre>
       ACL are able to trigger a DNS update, which can be used to feed a DNSRBL.  That functionnality is enabled
       at build time if the DNS resolver has DNS update support.

       Configuration  is  done  with  the <u>nsupdate</u> statement, which may be used several times, and the optionnal
       <u>tsig</u> statement, if you want ot use authenticated DNS update. Here is an example syntax:

                tsig "dns-update" "hmac-md5" "1B2M2Y8AsgTpgAmY7PhCfg=="
                nsupdate "bl.example.net" { rname "%j.bl.example.net" rvalue "127.0.0.2" tsig "dns-update" }

       The options for <u>nsupdate</u> are:

       <u>rname</u>  Created record name, which uses format strings.

       <u>rvalue</u> Created record value, which uses format strings.

       <u>servers</u>
              Quoted comma-separated list of DNS server the update should be sent to.  Default  is  to  use  the
              system confifugration, usualy from <u><a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a></u>

       <u>ttl</u>    TTL of created DNS record. Default is 0 seconds.

       <u>class</u>  Created record class, as numeric value. Default is 1, for IN class.

       <u>type</u>   Created record type, as numeric value. Default is 1, for A type.

       <u>tsig</u>   The  name  of  a  <u>tsig</u>  configuration,  which  must  have  been  supplied  before. If unspecified,
              unauthenticated DNS updates are performed.

       Once configured, DNS updates can be used in any ACL:

                racl blacklist rcpt <a href="mailto:spamtrap@example.net">spamtrap@example.net</a> nsupdate "bl.example.net"

</pre><h4><b>PROPERTIES</b></h4><pre>
       Properties are variables that can be set, evaluated and printed in ACL.  A property may be  dropped  once
       the  current  recipient  is  processed, or it can be retained until the message is processed. They can be
       created through the following always-matching ACL clauses:

       <u>set</u> <u>$name="value"</u>
              This sets a property that will be retained for all next recipients. Right hand side of the  clause
              may be a quoted string (which will be substituted using format strings, as described in the <b>FORMAT</b>
              <b>STRINGS</b>  section),  a  number, or another property name (which will be substituted by the property
              value).

       <u>rset</u> <u>$name="value"</u>
              Same as <u>set</u> clause, except that the property will be droped once the current user will  have  been
              processed.

       <u>urlcheck</u>
              These clause will cause properties to be fetched from an external web service.  See the <b>URL</b> <b>checks</b>
              section below for details.

       <u>ldapcheck</u>
              These clause will cause properties to be fetched from a LDAP directory See the <b>LDAP</b> <b>CHECKS</b> section
              below for details.

       Properties can be used as left-hand side part of ACL clauses:

                racl blacklist $name "badvalue"
                racl blacklist $name /badregex/

       If  used  left-hand  side and prefixed by a star, the property will be evaluated as a <b><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a>(7)</b> pattern, In
       the example below, if sender DNS domain is <u>test.example.net</u> and <u>$domain</u> is <u>*.example.net</u>, we get a match.

                racl blacklist *$domain "%f"

       They are also available as right-hand side of many ACL clauses:

                racl continue set $badword="spam"
                racl blacklist body $badword

       Values of properties can be obtained in any quoted string that is subject to format string expantion:

                racl continue set $webmaster="<a href="mailto:webmaster@example.net">webmaster@example.net</a>"
                racl blacklist domain evil.net msg "blacklisted, ask $P{webmaster} why"

       When the property value is a number, it can be increased or decreased using this syntax:

                racl continue set $score+=5
                racl continue set $score-=5

       Here again, right hand side may be a quoted string, a number or another property. For the  quoted  string
       and property cases, a conversion is first made to an integer, using 0 as a value on failure. Note that no
       arithmetic evaluation occurs. For instance, the quoted string <u>"1</u> <u>+</u> <u>1"</u> will be evaluated as 0.

       The  <b>log</b> ACL clause can be helpful when one need to figure what happens to property values during the ACL
       flow. See the <b>CUSTOM</b> <b>REPORT</b> section for more details.

</pre><h4><b>URL</b> <b>checks</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b> is able to query external sources of information through various URL, if it was  built
       with --with-libcurl. Here is an example:

                urlcheck "glusr" "<a href="http://www.example.net/mgl-config">http://www.example.net/mgl-config</a>?rcpt=%r" 5

                racl greylist urlcheck "glusr" delay 15m
                racl whitelist default

       The trailing 5 at the end of the <u>urlcheck</u> definition is the maximum number of simultaneous connections we
       want  to  launch  on  this  URL.  For  each  message,  the URL will be queried, with  % format tags being
       substituted. For instance, <u>%r</u> is substituted by the recipient. See the <b>FORMAT</b>  <b>STRINGS</b>  section  for  the
       complete list of substitutions.

       <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b> expects an answer containing a list of \n terminated lines, with <u>key:</u> <u>value</u> pairs. The
       most basic answer to get a match is:

                milterGreylistStatus: Ok

       <u>TRUE</u> can be used as an alias for <u>Ok</u> here.

       The answer can be more complex, with keys that will overload the ACL settings:

       <u>milterGreylistDelay</u>
              The greylisting delay to use (time unit suffix allowed).

       <u>milterGreylistAutowhite</u>
              The autowhite delay to use (time unit suffix allowed).

       <u>milterGreylistFlushAddr</u>
              The  value  is ignored. If this key is present, then the IP address for the sender machine will be
              flushed from greylist and autowhite databases.

       <u>milterGreylistCode</u>
              The SMTP code to return (e.g.: 551).

       <u>milterGreylistECode</u>
              The SMTP extended code to return (e.g.: 5.7.1)

       <u>milterGreylistMsg</u>
              The string to return with SMTP codes.

       <u>milterGreylistReport</u>
              The string to display in the <u>X-Greylist</u> header.

       <u>milterGreylistIgnore</u>
              This line will be ignored, without warnings in the logs.

       <u>milterGreylistAction</u>
              This feature is nifty but use it with caution, as it makes the access  list  a  bit  difficult  to
              understand. By specifying the values <u>greylist</u>, <u>whitelist</u>, or <u>blacklist</u>, it is possible to overload
              the ACL action itself.

       The ACL will match if any of the above key is returned: <u>milterGreylistStatus</u> is not mandatory.

       Optional keywords can be appended to a <u>urlcheck</u> definition:

       <u>postmsg</u>
              On  DATA-stage  ACL,  This  causes the message to be sent (up to <u>maxpeek</u> bytes) in a POST request.
              Here is an example:

                urlcheck "extfilter" "<a href="http://www.example.net/f.cgi">http://www.example.net/f.cgi</a>" 5 postmsg

                dacl blacklist urlcheck "extfilter"
                dacl whitelist default

       <u>getprop</u>
              Gather the properties returned by the URL and reuse them in the ACL.  The gathered properties  can
              be accessed in the current and following ACL by prefixing them by a dollar ($).

       <u>clear</u>  This  causes  gathered properties to be cleared on each new recipient.  This avoids properties for
              several recipients to mix.

       <u>fork</u>   Tells <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b> to fork a separate instance of itself for performing the queries. Use  it
              if you encounter thread-safety problems.  <u>fork</u> is not compatible with <u>postmsg</u>.

       <u>domatch</u>
              Cause  the  ldapcheck  clause to be evaluated in ACL. Default behavior is to ignore the result and
              just fecth properties, except if the LDAP directory is unreachecable, in which  case  a  temporary
              failure occurs.  The <u>fixldapcheck</u> gloabal settings may also be used to globaly cause all <u>ldapcheck</u>
              and <u>urlcheck</u> clauses to match.

       Here is an example that will use various DNSRBL depending on a per-recipient setting stored in the <u>dnsrbl</u>
       attribute of a LDAP directory.

                dnsrbl "RBL2" "rbl.example.net" "127.0.0.2"
                dnsrbl "RBL3" "rbl.example.net" "127.0.0.3"
                dnsrbl "RBL4" "rbl.example.net" "127.0.0.4"
                urlcheck "userconf" "ldap://localhost/dc=example,dc=net?milterGreylistStatus,dnsrbl?one?mail=%r"
              5 getprop clear

                racl blacklist urlcheck "userconf" $dnsrbl "RBL2" dnsrbl "RBL2"
                racl blacklist $dnsrbl "RBL3" dnsrbl "RBL3"
                racl blacklist $dnsrbl "RBL4" dnsrbl "RBL4"

       Note that when matching gathered properties, format strings and regex can be used.

</pre><h4><b>LDAP</b> <b>CHECKS</b></h4><pre>
       If  milter-greylist  was  built  with  --with-openldap,  then  you  can  also  use  <u>ldapcheck</u> for pulling
       information from an LDAP directory. This works exactly like <u>urlcheck</u>, except that properties  are  always
       collected: The <u>getprop</u> option is implicit.

       A list of LDAP URL to use can be specified with the <u>ldapconf</u> keyword. The network timeout is optional.

                ldapconf "ldap://localhost ldaps://ldap.example.net" timeout 2s

       When <u>ldaps://</u> is used, the system's <u>ldap.conf</u> file is used to locate x509 certificates.

       When  defining  LDAP  queries with the <u>ldapcheck</u> statement, note that the scheme and host part of the URL
       are ignored.  Servers listed in <u>ldapconf</u> are used instead.

</pre><h4><b>RATE</b> <b>LIMIT</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>ratelimit</u> keyword specifies a ratelimit configuration to be used in access lists. It must be followed
       by the rate limit configuration name, what is being accounted (i.e.: <u>session</u> for SMTP sessions, <u>rcpt</u>  for
       recipients, <u>data</u> for bytes in body and headers), the actual limit, and the sampling period. Example:

                ratelimit "internalclients" rcpt 10 / 1m

                racl blacklist addr 192.0.2.0/24 ratelimit "internalclients" \      msg "you speak too much"

       The  <u>ratelimit</u>  keyword can also have an option <u>key</u> statement, which determine the set of key for message
       accounting. The default is <u>%i</u> for per IP address accounting (see the  <b>FORMAT</b>  <b>STRINGS</b>  sections  for  the
       possible  syntax of this field). Here is an example that configures a rate limit of 100 messages per hour
       for each individual recipient-IP set.

                ratelimit "internalclients" rcpt 100 / 1h key "%r%i"

                racl blacklist addr 192.0.2.0/24 ratelimit "internalclients" \      msg "you speak too much"

</pre><h4><b>CUSTOM</b> <b>REPORTS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>stat</u> keyword can be used to specify a custom report  for  milter-greylist  activity.   It  should  be
       supplied with an output (either file or external command) and a format string. Here is an example:

                stat "&gt;&gt;/var/log/milter-greylist.log" "%T{%T},%i,%f,%r,%A\n"

       If  the  output  starts  by <u>&gt;&gt;</u> or <u>&gt;</u> then it is a file. Use <u>&gt;&gt;</u> to append to an existing file, and use <u>&gt;</u> to
       overwrite it. If the output starts by a <u>|</u> then the output is a shell command, like in the example below:

                stat "|logger -p local7.info" "%T{%T},%i,%f,%r,%A\n"

       The format string gets substituted as URL checks format string: %r gets substituted by the recipient,  %f
       by the sender, and so on. See the <b>FORMAT</b> <b>STRINGS</b> section for a complete list of available substitutions.

       There is also an always-matching <u>log</u> ACL clause that can be used to send a formated string to syslog with
       <u>LOG_INFO</u> level.  Here is an example:

              racl continue rcpt /@example\.com$/ log "I was here"

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND-LINE</b> <b>FLAG</b> <b>EQUIVALENTS</b></h4><pre>
       Most <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b> command-line options have equivalent options that can be set in the configuration
       file. Note that if a command line option is supplied, it will always override the configuration file.

       If  a command-line equivalent keyword is used more than once, the last keyword will override the previous
       ones.

       <u>verbose</u>
              Enable debug output. This is equivalent to the <b>-v</b> flag.

       <u>quiet</u>  Do not tell clients how much time remains before their e-mail will be accepted. This is equivalent
              to the <b>-q</b> flag.

       <u>nodetach</u>
              Do not fork and go into the background. This is equivalent to the <b>-D</b> flag.

       <u>noauth</u> Greylist clients regardless if they succeeded SMTP AUTH or STARTTLS.  Equivalent to the <b>-A</b> flag.

       <u>noaccessdb</u>
              Normally <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b> will whitelist a message if <b><a href="../man8/sendmail.8.html">sendmail</a>(8)</b> defines  a  ${greylist}  macro
              set to WHITE. This enables complex whitelisting rules based on the Sendmail access DB. This option
              inhibits this behavior.

       <u>nospf</u>  Greylist clients regardless if they are SPF-compliant. Equivalent to the <b>-S</b> flag.

       <u>testmode</u>
              Enable test mode. Equivalent to the <b>-T</b> flag. This option is deprecated.

       <u>greylist</u>
              The  argument sets how much time <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b> will want the client to wait between the first
              attempt and the time the message is accepted. The time is given in seconds, except if  a  unit  is
              given:  m  for minutes, h for hours, and d for days.  The <u>greylist</u> keyword is equivalent to the <b>-w</b>
              option. Here is an example that sets the delay to 45 minutes:

                greylist 45m

       <u>autowhite</u>
              This sets the auto-whitelisting duration, equivalent to the <b>-a</b> command-line  option.  As  for  the
              <u>greylist</u> keyword, units can be supplied. Here is an example for a 3 day long auto-whitelisting:

                autowhite 3d

       <u>pidfile</u>
              This  causes  <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b>  to  write  its  PID into the file given as argument, like the <b>-P</b>
              command line argument does. The path to the file must be absolute  and  it  must  be  enclosed  in
              quotes. Here is an example:

                pidfile "/var/run/greylist.pid"

       <u>dumpfile</u>
              This  chooses  the  location  of the greylist dump file, like the <b>-d</b> command line option does. The
              path must be absolute and enclosed  in  quotes.   It  can  optionally  be  followed  by  an  octal
              permission mode.  Example:

                dumpfile "/var/milter-greylist/greylist.db" 640

       <u>subnetmatch</u>
              This  is  equivalent  to  the  <b>-L</b> command line option. It takes a slash followed by a CIDR mask as
              argument, and it commands the subnet matching feature. Example, for a class C wide matching:

                subnetmatch /24

       <u>subnetmatch6</u>
              This is equivalent to the <b>-M</b> command line option. It takes a slash  followed  by  a  prefixlen  as
              argument, and it commands the subnet matching feature. Example, for a subnet wide matching:

                subnetmatch6 /64

       <u>socket</u> Like  the  <b>-p</b>  command line option, this keyword is used to specify the socket used to communicate
              with <b><a href="../man8/sendmail.8.html">sendmail</a>(8)</b>.  It must be enclosed in quotes and  can  optionally  be  followed  by  an  octal
              permission mode (valid values are 666, 660 or 600, other values cause an error):

                socket "/var/milter-greylist/milter-greylist.sock" 660

       <u>user</u>   This  keyword  should  be  followed  by  a  quoted user login and optionally a colon followed by a
              groupname.  Like the <b>-u</b> option, this is used to run <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b> as a non root  user.   Here
              is an example:

                user "smmsp"

</pre><h4><b>MISCELLANEOUS</b></h4><pre>
       These options have no command line equivalent:

       <u>logfac</u> Sets  the syslog facility for messages.  Can be set to any of the standard facilities: <u>kern</u>, <u>user</u>,
              <u>mail</u>, <u>daemon</u>, <u>auth</u>, <u>syslog</u>, <u>lpr</u>, <u>news</u>, <u>uucp</u>, <u>cron</u>, <u>authpriv</u>, <u>ftp</u>, <u>local0</u>, <u>local1</u>, <u>local2</u>,  <u>local3</u>,
              <u>local4</u>, <u>local5</u>, <u>local6</u>, <u>local7</u>.  Can also be set to <u>none</u> to disable syslog output completely.

       <u>timeout</u>
              is  used  to  control how long greylist tuples are retained in the database.  Value is in seconds,
              except if a suffix is given (m for minutes, h for hours, d for days). Default is 5 days.

       <u>extendedregex</u>
              Use extended regular expressions instead of basic regular expressions.

       <u>unbracket</u>
              Attempt to resolve sender  address  when  the  MTA  handed  it  as  bracketed  IP  address  (e.g.:
              <u>[192.0.2.18]</u> ). Default is to leave it as is.

       <u>maxpeek</u>
              Limit (in bytes) how much of messages are examined for header and body searches.

       <u>lazyaw</u> Make  auto-whitelist  look  at  just  the  IP  instead  of  the (sender IP, sender e-mail address,
              recipient e-mail address) tuple.

       <u>domainexact</u>
              match on subdomain boundaries instead of the default suffix matching.  E.g. if <u>domainexact</u> is  not
              enabled (the default) then gle.com will match google.com in addition to gle.com. If <u>domainexact</u> is
              enabled  then,  domain  names  will  match  on  subdomain  boundaries  (e.g.   gle.com  will match
              mail.gle.com and gle.com but not google.com)

       <u>drac</u> <u>db</u>
              Tell where the DRAC DB file is. This is only available if DRAC support was compiled in. Here is an
              example:

                drac db "/usr/local/etc/drac.db"

       <u>nodrac</u> Disable DRAC.

       <u>logexpired</u>
              This option causes greylist entries that expire to be logged  via  syslog.   This  allows  you  to
              easily collect the IP addresses and sender names and use them for blacklisting, SPAM scoring, etc.
              Normally,  expiration's  are  only  logged if the <b>debug</b> option is set, but that generates a lot of
              extra messages.

       <u>localaddr</u>
              This keyword can be used to manually define the local MTA's IP address for such uses as  <u>spf</u>  <u>self</u>
              and  <u>p0f</u>  in  absence  of  the milter-API <u>{if_addr}</u> macro support in your MTA (Postfix, Sun/Oracle
              CommSuite Messaging Server).  This is not so useful when using Sendmail, since it serves the macro
              and the local address can be detected automatically.

       The configuration file is reloaded automatically once it  is  modified  when  new  e-mail  arrives.  Most
       configuration  keywords  will  take effect immediately, except the following, which will only take effect
       after a restart of <b><a href="../man8/milter-greylist.8.html">milter-greylist</a>(8)</b>: <u>nodetach</u>, <u>pidfile</u>, <u>socket</u>, and <u>user</u>.

       The <u>dumpfreq</u> option can be changed dynamically, but the change will only take effect after the next dump.

       <u>multiracl</u>
              By default, once a RCPT-stage ACL  whitelists  a  recipient,  next  recipient  gets  automatically
              whitelisted. This historical behavior can be considered a bug, and this option disables it.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b> <b>STRINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Various statements in the configuration file accept format strings, where the following % prefixed tokens
       are  substituted.  Here is the complete list of available substitutions (Note that some substitutions are
       not relevant in any context).

       <u>%r</u>     the message recipient e-mail address. This is not substituted for DATA stage ACL since  there  can
              be multiple recipients for the message.

       <u>%f</u>     the message sender e-mail address

       <u>%i</u>     the sender machine IP address

       <u>%j</u>     the reversed sender machine IP address. For instance, 192.0.2.12 becomes 12.2.0.192.

       <u>%I</u>     the sender machine IP address masked by a CIDR. Example: <u>%I{/24}</u>

       <u>%d</u>     the sender machine DNS address

       <u>%h</u>     the SMTP transaction HELO string

       <u>%mr</u>    the mailbox part of %r (before the @ sign). This is not substituted for DATA stage ACL since there
              can be multiple recipients for the message.

       <u>%sr</u>    the site part of %r (after the @ sign). This is not substituted for DATA stage ACL since there can
              be multiple recipients for the message.

       <u>%mf</u>    the mailbox part of %f (before the @ sign)

       <u>%sf</u>    the site part of %f (after the @ sign)

       <u>%md</u>    the machine part of %d (before the first . sign)

       <u>%sd</u>    the site part of %d (after the first . sign)

       <u>%Xc</u>    the SMTP code returned

       <u>%Xe</u>    the SMTP extended code returned

       <u>%Xm</u>    the SMTP message returned

       <u>%Xh</u>    the message displayed in the X-Greylist header

       <u>%D</u>     Comma-separated list of DNSRBL for which the sender host matched

       <u>%M</u>     a sendmail macro value. Examples: <u>%Mj</u> or <u>%M{if_addr}</u>

       <u>%g</u>     a  regex  back  reference.  For  instance, <u>%g{\2}</u> is substituted by the string matching the second
              parenthesis group in all ACL regex clauses

       <u>%T</u>     a brace-enclosed <b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a>(3)</b> format string that will be substituted by the system  time.  Example:
              <u>%T{%Y%m%d:%H%M%S}</u>

       <u>%v</u>     milter-greylist's version

       <u>%G</u>     Offset to GMT (e.g.: -0100)

       <u>%C</u>     Sender  IP country code, as reported by GeoIP. This is only available if <b>milter-greylist</b> was built
              with GeoIP support

       <u>%Fx</u>    p0f OS fingerprint genre and detail. This is only available if <b>milter-greylist</b> was built with  p0f
              support.

       <u>%V</u>     Shortcut to "milter-greylist-%v (%Mj [%M{if_addr}]); %T{%a, %d %b %Y %T} %G (%T{%Z})"

       <u>%S</u>     the action performed: <u>accept</u>, <u>tempfail</u>, or <u>reject</u>.

       <u>%A</u>     the line number of the ACL that caused the action.

       <u>%a</u>     the  id  string  of  the  ACL  that caused the action. If no id was given, the line number is used
              instead.

       <u>%cA</u>    the line number of the ACL being evaluated, whether it matches or not.

       <u>%ca</u>    the id string of the ACL being avaluated, whether it matches or not.  If no id was given, the line
              number is used instead.

       <u>%Et</u>    total elapsed time in seconds before a greylisted message has been accepted

       <u>%Eh</u>    hours elapsed

       <u>%Em</u>    minutes elapsed (modulo one hour)

       <u>%Es</u>    seconds elapsed (modulo one minute)

       <u>%Rt</u>    total remaining time in seconds before a greylisted message will be accepted

       <u>%Rh</u>    hours remaining

       <u>%Rm</u>    minutes remaining (modulo one hour)

       <u>%Rs</u>    seconds remaining (modulo one minute)

       <u>%R</u>     shortcut to %Rh:%Rm:Rs

       <u>%Hs</u>    SpamAssassin score (if build with SpamAssassin support)

       <u>%pn</u>    Name of last LDAP or CURL gathered property that matched an ACL.

       <u>%pv</u>    Value of last LDAP or CURL gathered property that matched an ACL.

       <u>%pr</u>    Recipient that caused storage of the last matching LDAP or CURL gathered property.  <u>%P</u> a  LDAP  or
              CURL  gathered  propery.  Example:  <u>%P{mail}</u>  Note  that  this  copes  very badly with multivalued
              properties.

       <u>%Qd</u>    DKIM query result (pass, fail, etc.), if built with DKIM support.

       <u>%Qs</u>    SPF query result (pass, (soft)fail, etc.), if built with SPF support.

       <u>%QA</u>    Authentication  results  summary,  suitable  for  Authentication-Results  header.  Will   included
              formatted query results from DKIM and SPF if checked.
