</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>puppet.conf</b> - Puppet configuration reference

</pre><h4><b>Configuration</b> <b>settings</b></h4><pre>
       •   Each of these settings can be specified in <b>puppet.conf</b> or on the command line.

       •   Puppet  Enterprise  (PE)  and  open  source  Puppet share the configuration settings documented here.
           However, PE defaults differ from open source defaults  for  some  settings,  such  as  <b>node_terminus</b>,
           <b>storeconfigs</b>,  <b>always_retry_plugins</b>,  <b>disable18n</b>, <b>environment_timeout</b> (when Code Manager is enabled),
           and the Puppet Server JRuby <b>max-active-instances</b> setting. To verify PE configuration defaults,  check
           the <b>puppet.conf</b> or <b>pe-puppet-server.conf</b> file after installation.

       •   When  using boolean settings on the command line, use <b>--setting</b> and <b>--no-setting</b> instead of <b>--setting</b>
           <b>(true|false)</b>. (Using <b>--setting</b> <b>false</b> results in "Error: Could not parse application options: needless
           argument".)

       •   Settings can be interpolated as <b>$variables</b> in other settings; <b>$environment</b> is special, in that puppet
           master will interpolate each agent node's environment instead of its own.

       •   Multiple values should  be  specified  as  comma-separated  lists;  multiple  directories  should  be
           separated with the system path separator (usually a colon).

       •   Settings that represent time intervals should be specified in duration format: an integer immediately
           followed  by one of the units 'y' (years of 365 days), 'd' (days), 'h' (hours), 'm' (minutes), or 's'
           (seconds). The unit cannot be combined with other  units,  and  defaults  to  seconds  when  omitted.
           Examples  are  '3600' which is equivalent to '1h' (one hour), and '1825d' which is equivalent to '5y'
           (5 years).

       •   If you use the <b>splay</b> setting, note that the period that it waits changes each time the  Puppet  agent
           is restarted.

       •   Settings that take a single file or directory can optionally set the owner, group, and mode for their
           value: <b>rundir</b> <b>=</b> <b>$vardir/run</b> <b>{</b> <b>owner</b> <b>=</b> <b>puppet,</b> <b>group</b> <b>=</b> <b>puppet,</b> <b>mode</b> <b>=</b> <b>644</b> <b>}</b>

       •   The Puppet executables ignores any setting that isn't relevant to their function.

       See  the  configuration  guide  <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/config_about_settings.html</u> for more
       details.

   <b>agent_catalog_run_lockfile</b>
       A lock file to indicate that a puppet agent catalog run is currently in progress. The file  contains  the
       pid of the process that holds the lock on the catalog run.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$statedir/agent_catalog_run.lock</b>

   <b>agent_disabled_lockfile</b>
       A  lock file to indicate that puppet agent runs have been administratively disabled. File contains a JSON
       object with state information.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$statedir/agent_disabled.lock</b>

   <b>allow_duplicate_certs</b>
       Whether to allow a new certificate request to overwrite an existing certificate request.  If  true,  then
       the  old  certificate  must  be  cleaned  using  <b>puppetserver</b>  <b>ca</b> <b>clean</b>, and the new request signed using
       <b>puppetserver</b> <b>ca</b> <b>sign</b>.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>allow_pson_serialization</b>
       Whether to allow PSON serialization. When unable to serialize to JSON or other formats, Puppet falls back
       to PSON. This option affects the configuration management service responses  of  Puppet  Server  and  the
       process by which the agent saves its cached catalog. With a default value of <b>false</b>, this option is useful
       in preventing the loss of data because rich data cannot be serialized via PSON.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>always_retry_plugins</b>
       Affects  how  we  cache  attempts  to  load  Puppet  resource  types and features. If true, then calls to
       <b>Puppet.type.&lt;type&gt;?</b> <b>Puppet.feature.&lt;feature&gt;?</b> will always attempt to load the type or feature (which  can
       be  an  expensive operation) unless it has already been loaded successfully. This makes it possible for a
       single agent run to, e.g., install a package that provides the underlying  capabilities  for  a  type  or
       feature,  and  then  later load that type or feature during the same run (even if the type or feature had
       been tested earlier and had not been available).

       If this setting is set to false, then types and features will only be checked once, and if they  are  not
       available,  the  negative  result  is cached and returned for all subsequent attempts to load the type or
       feature. This behavior is almost always appropriate for the server,  and  can  result  in  a  significant
       performance improvement for types and features that are checked frequently.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>true</b>

   <b>autoflush</b>
       Whether log files should always flush to disk.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>true</b>

   <b>autosign</b>
       Whether  (and  how)  to  autosign  certificate requests. This setting is only relevant on a Puppet Server
       acting as a certificate authority (CA).

       Valid values are true (autosigns all certificate requests; not recommended), false (disables  autosigning
       certificates), or the absolute path to a file.

       The  file  specified  in  this  setting may be either a <b>configuration</b> <b>file</b> or a <b>custom</b> <b>policy</b> <b>executable.</b>
       Puppet will automatically determine what it is: If the Puppet user (see the <b>user</b> setting) can execute the
       file, it will be treated as a policy executable; otherwise, it will be treated as a config file.

       If a custom policy executable is configured, the CA Puppet Server will run it every time  it  receives  a
       CSR.  The  executable  will  be  passed the subject CN of the request <u>as</u> <u>a</u> <u>command</u> <u>line</u> <u>argument,</u> and the
       contents of the CSR in PEM format <u>on</u> <u>stdin.</u> It should exit with a status of  0  if  the  cert  should  be
       autosigned and non-zero if the cert should not be autosigned.

       If  a  certificate  request  is  not  autosigned,  it  will persist for review. An admin user can use the
       <b>puppetserver</b> <b>ca</b> <b>sign</b> command to manually sign it, or can delete the request.

       For   info   on   autosign   configuration   files,   see   the   guide   to   Puppet's   config    files
       <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/config_file_autosign.html</u>.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$confdir/autosign.conf</b>

   <b>basemodulepath</b>
       The  search path for <b>global</b> modules. Should be specified as a list of directories separated by the system
       path separator character. (The POSIX path separator is ':', and the Windows path separator is ';'.)

       These are the modules that will be used by <u>all</u> environments. Note  that  the  <b>modules</b>  directory  of  the
       active   environment   will   have   priority   over   any   global   directories.  For  more  info,  see
       <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/environments_about.html</u>

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$codedir/modules:/usr/share/puppet/modules</b>

   <b>binder_config</b>
       The binder configuration file. Puppet reads this file on each request to configure the  bindings  system.
       If set to nil (the default), a $confdir/binder_config.yaml is optionally loaded. If it does not exists, a
       default configuration is used. If the setting :binding_config is specified, it must reference a valid and
       existing yaml file.

       •   <u>Default</u>: ``

   <b>bucketdir</b>
       Where FileBucket files are stored.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$vardir/bucket</b>

   <b>ca_fingerprint</b>
       The  expected  fingerprint of the CA certificate. If specified, the agent will compare the CA certificate
       fingerprint that it downloads against this value and reject the CA  certificate  if  the  values  do  not
       match. This only applies during the first download of the CA certificate.

       •   <u>Default</u>: ``

   <b>ca_name</b>
       The name to use the Certificate Authority certificate.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>Puppet</b> <b>CA:</b> <b>$certname</b>

   <b>ca_port</b>
       The port to use for the certificate authority.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$serverport</b>

   <b>ca_refresh_interval</b>
       How often the Puppet agent refreshes its local CA certificates. By default, CA certificates are refreshed
       every  24 hours. If a different interval is specified, the agent refreshes its CA certificates during the
       next agent run if the elapsed time since the certificates  were  last  refreshed  exceeds  the  specified
       duration.

       In  general,  the  interval should be greater than the <b>runinterval</b> value. Setting the <b>ca_refresh_interval</b>
       value to 0 or an equal or lesser value than <b>runinterval</b> causes the CA certificates  to  be  refreshed  on
       every run.

       If the agent downloads new CA certs, the agent uses those for subsequent network requests. If the refresh
       request  fails or if the CA certs are unchanged on the server, then the agent run will continue using the
       local CA certs it already has. This setting can be a time interval in seconds (30 or 30s), minutes (30m),
       hours (6h), days (2d), or years (5y).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>1d</b>

   <b>ca_server</b>
       The server to use for certificate authority requests. It's a separate server because it cannot  and  does
       not need to horizontally scale.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$server</b>

   <b>ca_ttl</b>
       The default TTL for new certificates. This setting can be a time interval in seconds (30 or 30s), minutes
       (30m), hours (6h), days (2d), or years (5y).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>5y</b>

   <b>cacert</b>
       The CA certificate.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$cadir/ca_crt.pem</b>

   <b>cacrl</b>
       The certificate revocation list (CRL) for the CA.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$cadir/ca_crl.pem</b>

   <b>cadir</b>
       The root directory for the certificate authority.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>/etc/puppet/puppetserver/ca</b>

   <b>cakey</b>
       The CA private key.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$cadir/ca_key.pem</b>

   <b>capub</b>
       The CA public key.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$cadir/ca_pub.pem</b>

   <b>catalog_cache_terminus</b>
       How  to  store  cached  catalogs.  Valid  values  are 'json', 'msgpack' and 'yaml'. The agent application
       defaults to 'json'.

       •   <u>Default</u>: ``

   <b>catalog_terminus</b>
       Where to get node catalogs. This is useful to change if, for instance, you'd like to pre-compile catalogs
       and store them in memcached or some other easily-accessed store.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>compiler</b>

   <b>cert_inventory</b>
       The inventory file. This is a text file to which the CA writes a complete listing of all certificates.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$cadir/inventory.txt</b>

   <b>certdir</b>
       The certificate directory.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$ssldir/certs</b>

   <b>certificate_revocation</b>
       Whether certificate revocation checking  should  be  enabled,  and  what  level  of  checking  should  be
       performed.

       When  certificate  revocation  is  enabled,  Puppet  expects  the  contents  of its CRL to be one or more
       PEM-encoded CRLs concatenated together. When using a cert bundle, CRLs for all CAs in the chain of  trust
       must  be included in the crl file. The chain should be ordered from least to most authoritative, with the
       first CRL listed being for the root of the chain and the last being for the leaf CA.

       When certificate_revocation is set to 'true' or 'chain', Puppet ensures that each  CA  in  the  chain  of
       trust has not been revoked by its issuing CA.

       When  certificate_revocation  is set to 'leaf', Puppet verifies certs against the issuing CA's revocation
       list, but it does not verify the revocation status of the issuing CA or any CA above it within the  chain
       of trust.

       When  certificate_revocation  is  set to 'false', Puppet disables all certificate revocation checking and
       does not attempt to download the CRL.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>chain</b>

   <b>certname</b>
       The name to use when handling certificates. When a node requests a certificate from the CA Puppet Server,
       it uses the value of the <b>certname</b> setting as its requested Subject CN.

       This  is  the  name  used  when  managing   a   node's   permissions   in   Puppet   Server's   auth.conf
       <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppetserver/latest/config_file_auth.html</u>.  In most cases, it is also used as the
       node's             name             when              matching              node              definitions
       <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_node_definitions.html</u>  and  requesting data from an ENC. (This
       can be changed with the <b>node_name_value</b> and <b>node_name_fact</b> settings, although you should only  do  so  if
       you have a compelling reason.)

       A  node's  certname  is  available  in  Puppet manifests as <b>$trusted['certname']</b>. (See Facts and Built-In
       Variables <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_facts_and_builtin_vars.html</u> for more details.)

       •   For best compatibility, you should limit the  value  of  <b>certname</b>  to  only  use  lowercase  letters,
           numbers, periods, underscores, and dashes. (That is, it should match <b>/A[a-z0-9._-]+Z/</b>.)

       •   The special value <b>ca</b> is reserved, and can't be used as the certname for a normal node.

           <b>Note:</b>  You  must  set  the  certname  in  the  main  section of the puppet.conf file. Setting it in a
           different section causes errors.

       Defaults to the node's fully qualified domain name.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>the</b> <b>Host's</b> <b>fully</b> <b>qualified</b> <b>domain</b> <b>name,</b> <b>as</b> <b>determined</b> <b>by</b> <b>Facter</b>

   <b>ciphers</b>
       The list of ciphersuites for TLS connections initiated by puppet. The default value is chosen to  support
       TLS 1.0 and up, but can be made more restrictive if needed. The ciphersuites must be specified in OpenSSL
       format, not IANA.

       •   <u>Default</u>:
           <b>ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:DHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA:DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256:AES128-GCM-SHA256:AES256-GCM-SHA384:AES128-SHA256:AES256-SHA256</b>

   <b>classfile</b>
       The  file in which puppet agent stores a list of the classes associated with the retrieved configuration.
       Can be loaded in the separate <b>puppet</b> executable using the <b>--loadclasses</b> option.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$statedir/classes.txt</b>

   <b>client_datadir</b>
       The directory in which serialized data is stored on the client.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$vardir/client_data</b>

   <b>clientbucketdir</b>
       Where FileBucket files are stored locally.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$vardir/clientbucket</b>

   <b>clientyamldir</b>
       The directory in which client-side YAML data is stored.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$vardir/client_yaml</b>

   <b>code</b>
       Code to parse directly. This is essentially only used by <b>puppet</b>, and should only be set if you're writing
       your own Puppet executable.

   <b>codedir</b>
       The main Puppet code directory. The default for this setting is calculated based  on  the  user.  If  the
       process  is  running  as  root  or  the  user  that Puppet is supposed to run as, it defaults to a system
       directory, but if it's running as any other user, it defaults to being in the user's home directory.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>Unix/Linux:</b> <b>/etc/puppetlabs/code</b>  <b>--</b>  <b>Windows:</b>  <b>C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\code</b>  <b>--</b>  <b>Non-root</b>
           <b>user:</b> <b><a href="file:~/.puppetlabs/etc/code">~/.puppetlabs/etc/code</a></b>

   <b>color</b>
       Whether  to use colors when logging to the console. Valid values are <b>ansi</b> (equivalent to <b>true</b>), <b>html</b>, and
       <b>false</b>, which produces no color.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>ansi</b>

   <b>confdir</b>
       The main Puppet configuration directory. The default for this setting is calculated based on the user. If
       the process is running as root or the user that Puppet is supposed to run as, it  defaults  to  a  system
       directory, but if it's running as any other user, it defaults to being in the user's home directory.

       •   <u>Default</u>:  <b>Unix/Linux:</b>  <b>/etc/puppetlabs/puppet</b>  <b>--</b>  <b>Windows:</b>  <b>C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\puppet\etc</b>  <b>--</b>
           <b>Non-root</b> <b>user:</b> <b><a href="file:~/.puppetlabs/etc/puppet">~/.puppetlabs/etc/puppet</a></b>

   <b>config</b>
       The configuration file for the current puppet application.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$confdir/${config_file_name}</b>

   <b>config_file_name</b>
       The name of the puppet config file.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>puppet.conf</b>

   <b>config_version</b>
       How to determine the configuration version. By default, it will be the time  that  the  configuration  is
       parsed,  but you can provide a shell script to override how the version is determined. The output of this
       script will be added to every log message in the reports, allowing you to correlate changes on your hosts
       to the source version on the server.

       Setting a global value for config_version in puppet.conf is not allowed (but it can  be  overridden  from
       the  commandline).  Please  set  a  per-environment value in environment.conf instead. For more info, see
       <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/environments_about.html</u>

   <b>configprint</b>
       Prints the value of a specific configuration setting. If the name of a setting is provided for this, then
       the value is printed and puppet exits. Comma-separate multiple values. For a list of all values,  specify
       'all'. This setting is deprecated, the 'puppet config' command replaces this functionality.

   <b>crl_refresh_interval</b>
       How  often the Puppet agent refreshes its local Certificate Revocation List (CRL). By default, the CRL is
       refreshed every 24 hours. If a different interval is specified, the agent refreshes its CRL on  the  next
       Puppet agent run if the elapsed time since the CRL was last refreshed exceeds the specified interval.

       In  general,  the interval should be greater than the <b>runinterval</b> value. Setting the <b>crl_refresh_interval</b>
       value to 0 or an equal or lesser value than <b>runinterval</b> causes the CRL to be refreshed on every run.

       If the agent downloads a new CRL, the agent will use it for subsequent network requests. If  the  refresh
       request  fails or if the CRL is unchanged on the server, then the agent run will continue using the local
       CRL it already has.This setting can be a time interval in seconds (30 or 30s), minutes (30m), hours (6h),
       days (2d), or years (5y).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>1d</b>

   <b>csr_attributes</b>
       An optional file containing custom attributes to add to certificate signing requests (CSRs).  You  should
       ensure  that  this  file  does  not  exist  on  your  CA  Puppet Server; if it does, unwanted certificate
       extensions may leak into certificates created with the <b>puppetserver</b> <b>ca</b> <b>generate</b> command.

       If present, this file must be a YAML hash containing a <b>custom_attributes</b> key and/or an <b>extension_requests</b>
       key. The value of each key must be a hash, where each key is a valid OID and each value is an object that
       can be cast to a string.

       Custom attributes can be used by the CA when deciding whether to  sign  the  certificate,  but  are  then
       discarded.  Attribute  OIDs  can  be  any  OID  value except the standard CSR attributes (i.e. attributes
       described in RFC 2985 section 5.4). This is useful for embedding a pre-shared key for autosigning  policy
       executables  (see  the  <b>autosign</b> setting), often by using the <b>1.2.840.113549.1.9.7</b> ("challenge password")
       OID.

       Extension requests will be permanently embedded in the final certificate. Extension OIDs must be  in  the
       "ppRegCertExt"   (<b>1.3.6.1.4.1.34380.1.1</b>),  "ppPrivCertExt"  (<b>1.3.6.1.4.1.34380.1.2</b>),  or  "ppAuthCertExt"
       (<b>1.3.6.1.4.1.34380.1.3</b>) OID arcs. The ppRegCertExt arc is reserved for four of the most common pieces  of
       data to embed: <b>pp_uuid</b> (<b>.1</b>), <b>pp_instance_id</b> (<b>.2</b>), <b>pp_image_name</b> (<b>.3</b>), and <b>pp_preshared_key</b> (<b>.4</b>) -- in the
       YAML  file,  these  can  be  referred  to by their short descriptive names instead of their full OID. The
       ppPrivCertExt arc is unregulated, and can be used for site-specific extensions.  The  ppAuthCert  arc  is
       reserved  for  two  pieces  of  data  to  embed:  <b>pp_authorization</b>  (<b>.1</b>)  and <b>pp_auth_role</b> (<b>.13</b>). As with
       ppRegCertExt, in the YAML file, these can be referred to by their short descriptive name instead of their
       full OID.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$confdir/csr_attributes.yaml</b>

   <b>csrdir</b>
       Where the CA stores certificate requests.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$cadir/requests</b>

   <b>daemonize</b>
       Whether to send the process into the background. This defaults to true on POSIX systems, and to false  on
       Windows (where Puppet currently cannot daemonize).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>true</b>

   <b>data_binding_terminus</b>
       This  setting  has been deprecated. Use of any value other than 'hiera' should instead be configured in a
       version 5 hiera.yaml. Until this setting is removed, it controls which data binding terminus to  use  for
       global  automatic  data  binding  (across all environments). By default this value is 'hiera'. A value of
       'none' turns off the global binding.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>hiera</b>

   <b>default_file_terminus</b>
       The default source for files if no server is given in a uri, e.g. puppet:///file.  The  default  of  <b>rest</b>
       causes  the file to be retrieved using the <b>server</b> setting. When running <b>apply</b> the default is <b>file_server</b>,
       causing requests to be filled locally.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>rest</b>

   <b>default_manifest</b>
       The default main manifest for directory environments. Any  environment  that  doesn't  set  the  <b>manifest</b>
       setting in its <b>environment.conf</b> file will use this manifest.

       This  setting's  value  can  be an absolute or relative path. An absolute path will make all environments
       default to the same main manifest; a relative path will allow each environment to use its  own  manifest,
       and Puppet will resolve the path relative to each environment's main directory.

       In  either  case,  the  path can point to a single file or to a directory of manifests to be evaluated in
       alphabetical order.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>./manifests</b>

   <b>default_schedules</b>
       Boolean; whether to generate the default schedule resources. Setting this to false is useful for  keeping
       external report processors clean of skipped schedule resources.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>true</b>

   <b>deviceconfdir</b>
       The root directory of devices' $confdir.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$confdir/devices</b>

   <b>deviceconfig</b>
       Path to the device config file for puppet device.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$confdir/device.conf</b>

   <b>devicedir</b>
       The root directory of devices' $vardir.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$vardir/devices</b>

   <b>diff</b>
       Which  diff  command to use when printing differences between files. This setting has no default value on
       Windows, as standard <b>diff</b> is not available, but Puppet can use many third-party diff tools.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>diff</b>

   <b>diff_args</b>
       Which arguments to pass to the diff command when printing differences between files. The command  to  use
       can be chosen with the <b>diff</b> setting.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>-u</b>

   <b>digest_algorithm</b>
       Which  digest  algorithm  to  use for file resources and the filebucket. Valid values are sha256, sha384,
       sha512, sha224, md5. Default is sha256.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>sha256</b>

   <b>disable_i18n</b>
       If true, turns off all translations of Puppet and module log messages, which affects error, warning,  and
       info log messages, as well as any translations in the report and CLI.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>true</b>

   <b>disable_per_environment_manifest</b>
       Whether to disallow an environment-specific main manifest. When set to <b>true</b>, Puppet will use the manifest
       specified  in  the <b>default_manifest</b> setting for all environments. If an environment specifies a different
       main manifest in its <b>environment.conf</b> file, catalog requests for  that  environment  will  fail  with  an
       error.

       This setting requires <b>default_manifest</b> to be set to an absolute path.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>disable_warnings</b>
       A  comma-separated  list  of  warning types to suppress. If large numbers of warnings are making Puppet's
       logs too large or difficult to use, you can temporarily silence them with this setting.

       If you are preparing to upgrade Puppet to a new major version, you should re-enable all  warnings  for  a
       while.

       Valid values for this setting are:

       •   <b>deprecations</b> -- disables deprecation warnings.

       •   <b>undefined_variables</b> -- disables warnings about non existing variables.

       •   <b>undefined_resources</b> -- disables warnings about non existing resources.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>[]</b>

   <b>dns_alt_names</b>
       A  comma-separated  list of alternate DNS names for Puppet Server. These are extra hostnames (in addition
       to its <b>certname</b>) that the server is allowed to use when serving agents. Puppet checks this  setting  when
       automatically  creating  a  certificate for Puppet agent or Puppet Server. These can be either IP or DNS,
       and the type should be specified and followed with a colon. Untyped inputs will default to DNS.

       In order to handle agent requests at a given hostname (like "puppet.example.com"), Puppet Server needs  a
       certificate  that  proves  it's  allowed  to  use that name; if a server shows a certificate that doesn't
       include its hostname, Puppet agents will refuse to trust it. If you use  a  single  hostname  for  Puppet
       traffic  but  load-balance  it  to  multiple  Puppet  Servers, each of those servers needs to include the
       official hostname in its list of extra names.

       <b>Note:</b> The list of alternate names is locked in when the server's certificate is signed. If  you  need  to
       change  the  list later, you can't just change this setting; you also need to regenerate the certificate.
       For     more     information     on     that     process,     see      the      cert      regen      docs
       <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/ssl_regenerate_certificates.html</u>.

       To  see  all  the alternate names your servers are using, log into your CA server and run <b>puppetserver</b> <b>ca</b>
       <b>list</b> <b>--all</b>, then check the output for <b>(alt</b> <b>names:</b> <b>...)</b>. Most agent nodes should NOT have alternate names;
       the only certs that should have them are Puppet Server nodes that you want other agents to trust.

   <b>document_all</b>
       Whether to document all resources when using <b>puppet</b> <b>doc</b> to generate manifest documentation.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>environment</b>
       The environment in which Puppet is running. For clients,  such  as  <b>puppet</b>  <b>agent</b>,  this  determines  the
       environment  itself, which Puppet uses to find modules and much more. For servers, such as <b>puppet</b> <b>server</b>,
       this provides the default environment for nodes that Puppet knows nothing about.

       When defining an environment in the <b>[agent]</b> section, this  refers  to  the  environment  that  the  agent
       requests  from  the primary server. The environment doesn't have to exist on the local filesystem because
       the agent fetches it from the primary server. This definition is used when running <b>puppet</b> <b>agent</b>.

       When defined in the <b>[user]</b> section, the environment refers to the path that Puppet  uses  to  search  for
       code  and  modules  related  to  its  execution.  This  requires  the environment to exist locally on the
       filesystem where puppet is being executed. Puppet subcommands, including <b>puppet</b> <b>module</b> and <b>puppet</b>  <b>apply</b>,
       use this definition.

       Given     that    the    context    and    effects    vary    depending    on    the    config    section
       <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/config_file_main.html#config-sections</u>  in  which  the   <b>environment</b>
       setting is defined, do not set it globally.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>production</b>

   <b>environment_data_provider</b>
       The  name  of  a  registered environment data provider used when obtaining environment specific data. The
       three built in and registered providers are 'none' (no data), 'function' (data obtained  by  calling  the
       function  'environment::data()')  and  'hiera'  (data  obtained  using a data provider configured using a
       hiera.yaml file in root of the environment). Other  environment  data  providers  may  be  registered  in
       modules  on the module path. For such custom data providers see the respective module documentation. This
       setting is deprecated.

       •   <u>Default</u>: ``

   <b>environment_timeout</b>
       How long the Puppet server should cache data it loads from an environment.

       A value of <b>0</b> will disable caching.  This  setting  can  also  be  set  to  <b>unlimited</b>,  which  will  cache
       environments  until the server is restarted or told to refresh the cache. All other values will result in
       Puppet server evicting environments that haven't been used within the last <b>environment_timeout</b> seconds.

       You should change this setting once your Puppet deployment  is  doing  non-trivial  work.  We  chose  the
       default value of <b>0</b> because it lets new users update their code without any extra steps, but it lowers the
       performance of your Puppet server. We recommend either:

       •   Setting  this  to  <b>unlimited</b>  and  explicitly  refreshing  your  Puppet  server  as part of your code
           deployment process.

       •   Setting this to a number that will keep your  most  actively  used  environments  cached,  but  allow
           testing environments to fall out of the cache and reduce memory usage. A value of 3 minutes (3m) is a
           reasonable value.

       Once  you  set  <b>environment_timeout</b>  to a non-zero value, you need to tell Puppet server to read new code
       from disk using the <b>environment-cache</b> API endpoint after you deploy new code. See the docs for the Puppet
       Server                                         administrative                                         API
       <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppetserver/latest/admin-api/v1/environment-cache.html</u>.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>0</b>

   <b>environmentpath</b>
       A search path for directory environments, as a list of directories separated by the system path separator
       character. (The POSIX path separator is ':', and the Windows path separator is ';'.)

       This  setting  must  have  a  value  set  to  enable  <b>directory</b>  <b>environments.</b>  The  recommended value is
       <b>$codedir/environments</b>.                For                more                details,                 see
       <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/environments_about.html</u>

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$codedir/environments</b>

   <b>evaltrace</b>
       Whether each resource should log when it is being evaluated. This allows you to interactively see exactly
       what is being done.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>exclude_unchanged_resources</b>
       Specifies  how  unchanged  resources  are listed in reports. When set to <b>true</b>, resources that have had no
       changes after catalog application will not have corresponding unchanged resource status updates listed in
       a report.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>true</b>

   <b>external_nodes</b>
       The external node classifier (ENC) script to use for node data. Puppet combines this data with  the  main
       manifest to produce node catalogs.

       To enable this setting, set the <b>node_terminus</b> setting to <b>exec</b>.

       This  setting's  value  must  be the path to an executable command that can produce node information. The
       command must:

       •   Take the name of a node as a command-line argument.

       •   Return a YAML hash with up to three keys:

       •   <b>classes</b> -- A list of classes, as an array or hash.

       •   <b>environment</b> -- A string.

       •   <b>parameters</b> -- A list of top-scope variables to set, as a hash.

       •   For unknown nodes, exit with a non-zero exit code.

       Generally, an ENC script makes requests to an external data source.

       For more info, see the ENC documentation <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/nodes_external.html</u>.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>none</b>

   <b>fact_name_length_soft_limit</b>
       The soft limit for the length of a fact name.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>2560</b>

   <b>fact_value_length_soft_limit</b>
       The soft limit for the length of a fact value.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>4096</b>

   <b>factpath</b>
       Where Puppet should look for facts. Multiple directories should be separated by the system path separator
       character. (The POSIX path separator is ':', and the Windows path separator is ';'.)

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$vardir/lib/facter:$vardir/facts</b>

   <b>facts_terminus</b>
       The node facts terminus.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>facter</b>

   <b>fileserverconfig</b>
       Where the fileserver configuration is stored.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$confdir/fileserver.conf</b>

   <b>filetimeout</b>
       The minimum time to wait between checking for updates in configuration files. This timeout determines how
       quickly Puppet checks whether a file (such as manifests or puppet.conf) has changed on disk. The  default
       will  change  in  a future release to be 'unlimited', requiring a reload of the Puppet service to pick up
       changes to its internal configuration. Currently we do not accept a  value  of  'unlimited'.  To  reparse
       files within an environment in Puppet Server please use the environment_cache endpoint

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>15s</b>

   <b>forge_authorization</b>
       The  authorization  key  to  connect  to  the Puppet Forge. Leave blank for unauthorized or license based
       connections

       •   <u>Default</u>: ``

   <b>freeze_main</b>
       Freezes the 'main' class, disallowing any code to be added to it. This essentially means that  you  can't
       have any code outside of a node, class, or definition other than in the site manifest.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>genconfig</b>
       When  true,  causes  Puppet  applications to print an example config file to stdout and exit. The example
       will include descriptions of  each  setting,  and  the  current  (or  default)  value  of  each  setting,
       incorporating  any  settings overridden on the CLI (with the exception of <b>genconfig</b> itself). This setting
       only makes sense when specified on the command line as <b>--genconfig</b>.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>genmanifest</b>
       Whether to just print a manifest to stdout and exit. Only makes sense when specified on the command  line
       as <b>--genmanifest</b>. Takes into account arguments specified on the CLI.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>graph</b>
       Whether  to create .dot graph files, which let you visualize the dependency and containment relationships
       in  Puppet's  catalog.  You   can   load   and   view   these   files   with   tools   like   OmniGraffle
       <u><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/">http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/</a></u>    (OS   X)   or   graphviz   <u><a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">http://www.graphviz.org/</a></u>
       (multi-platform).

       Graph files are created when <u>applying</u> a catalog, so this setting should be used on nodes  running  <b>puppet</b>
       <b>agent</b> or <b>puppet</b> <b>apply</b>.

       The  <b>graphdir</b>  setting  determines  where  Puppet  will  save  graphs. Note that we don't save graphs for
       historical runs; Puppet will replace the previous .dot files with  new  ones  every  time  it  applies  a
       catalog.

       See  your graphing software's documentation for details on opening .dot files. If you're using GraphViz's
       <b>dot</b> command, you can do a quick PNG render with <b>dot</b> <b>-Tpng</b> <b>&lt;DOT</b> <b>FILE&gt;</b> <b>-o</b> <b>&lt;OUTPUT</b> <b>FILE&gt;</b>.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>graphdir</b>
       Where to save .dot-format graphs (when the <b>graph</b> setting is enabled).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$statedir/graphs</b>

   <b>group</b>
       The group Puppet Server will run as. Used to ensure the agent side processes (agent, apply,  etc)  create
       files and directories readable by Puppet Server when necessary.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>puppet</b>

   <b>hiera_config</b>
       The  hiera  configuration  file.  Puppet  only reads this file on startup, so you must restart the puppet
       server every time you edit it.

       •   <u>Default</u>:  <b>$confdir/hiera.yaml.</b>  <b>However,</b>  <b>for</b>  <b>backwards</b>  <b>compatibility,</b>  <b>if</b>   <b>a</b>   <b>file</b>   <b>exists</b>   <b>at</b>
           <b>$codedir/hiera.yaml,</b> <b>Puppet</b> <b>uses</b> <b>that</b> <b>instead.</b>

   <b>hostcert</b>
       Where individual hosts store and look for their certificates.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$certdir/$certname.pem</b>

   <b>hostcert_renewal_interval</b>
       How  often  the Puppet agent renews its client certificate. By default, the client certificate is renewed
       30 days before the certificate expires. If a different interval is specified, the agent renews its client
       certificate during the next agent run, assuming that  the  client  certificate  has  expired  within  the
       specified duration.

       In general, the <b>hostcert_renewal_interval</b> value should be greater than the <b>runinterval</b> value. Setting the
       <b>hostcert_renewal_interval</b> value to 0 disables automatic renewal.

       If  the  agent downloads a new certificate, the agent will use it for subsequent network requests. If the
       refresh request fails, the agent run continues to use its existing certificate. This  setting  can  be  a
       time interval in seconds (30 or 30s), minutes (30m), hours (6h), days (2d), or years (5y).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>30d</b>

   <b>hostcrl</b>
       Where  the  host's  certificate  revocation  list  can  be  found.  This is distinct from the certificate
       authority's CRL.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$ssldir/crl.pem</b>

   <b>hostcsr</b>
       Where individual hosts store their certificate request (CSR) while waiting for  the  CA  to  issue  their
       certificate.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$requestdir/$certname.pem</b>

   <b>hostprivkey</b>
       Where individual hosts store and look for their private key.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$privatekeydir/$certname.pem</b>

   <b>hostpubkey</b>
       Where individual hosts store and look for their public key.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$publickeydir/$certname.pem</b>

   <b>http_connect_timeout</b>
       The  maximum amount of time to wait when establishing an HTTP connection. The default value is 2 minutes.
       This setting can be a time interval in seconds (30 or 30s), minutes (30m),  hours  (6h),  days  (2d),  or
       years (5y).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>2m</b>

   <b>http_debug</b>
       Whether  to  write  HTTP  request  and  responses  to  stderr.  This should never be used in a production
       environment.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>http_extra_headers</b>
       The list of extra headers that will be sent  with  http  requests  to  the  primary  server.  The  header
       definition consists of a name and a value separated by a colon.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>[]</b>

   <b>http_keepalive_timeout</b>
       The maximum amount of time a persistent HTTP connection can remain idle in the connection pool, before it
       is closed. This timeout should be shorter than the keepalive timeout used on the HTTP server, e.g. Apache
       KeepAliveTimeout  directive.  This  setting can be a time interval in seconds (30 or 30s), minutes (30m),
       hours (6h), days (2d), or years (5y).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>4s</b>

   <b>http_proxy_host</b>
       The HTTP proxy host to use for outgoing connections. The proxy will be bypassed if the server's  hostname
       matches  the  NO_PROXY environment variable or <b>no_proxy</b> setting. Note: You may need to use a FQDN for the
       server hostname when using a proxy. Environment variable http_proxy  or  HTTP_PROXY  will  override  this
       value.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>none</b>

   <b>http_proxy_password</b>
       The password for the user of an authenticated HTTP proxy. Requires the <b>http_proxy_user</b> setting.

       Note  that passwords must be valid when used as part of a URL. If a password contains any characters with
       special meanings in URLs (as specified by RFC 3986 section 2.2), they must be URL-encoded. (For  example,
       <b>#</b> would become <b>%23</b>.)

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>none</b>

   <b>http_proxy_port</b>
       The HTTP proxy port to use for outgoing connections

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>3128</b>

   <b>http_proxy_user</b>
       The user name for an authenticated HTTP proxy. Requires the <b>http_proxy_host</b> setting.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>none</b>

   <b>http_read_timeout</b>
       The  time  to  wait  for  data  to  be read from an HTTP connection. If nothing is read after the elapsed
       interval then the connection will be closed. The default value is 10 minutes. This setting can be a  time
       interval in seconds (30 or 30s), minutes (30m), hours (6h), days (2d), or years (5y).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>10m</b>

   <b>http_user_agent</b>
       The HTTP User-Agent string to send when making network requests.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>Puppet/&lt;version&gt;</b> <b>Ruby/&lt;version&gt;</b> <b>(&lt;architecture&gt;)</b>

   <b>ignore_plugin_errors</b>
       Whether  the  puppet  run  should  ignore errors during pluginsync. If the setting is false and there are
       errors during pluginsync, then the agent will abort the run and submit a  report  containing  information
       about the failed run.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>ignoremissingtypes</b>
       Skip  searching  for  classes  and  definitions that were missing during a prior compilation. The list of
       missing objects is maintained per-environment and persists  until  the  environment  is  cleared  or  the
       primary server is restarted.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>ignoreschedules</b>
       Boolean; whether puppet agent should ignore schedules. This is useful for initial puppet agent runs.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>include_legacy_facts</b>
       Whether  to include legacy facts when requesting a catalog. This option can be set to <b>false</b> if all puppet
       manifests, hiera.yaml, and hiera configuration layers no longer access legacy facts, such  as  <b>$osfamily</b>,
       and instead access structured facts, such as <b>$facts['os']['family']</b>.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>key_type</b>
       The type of private key. Valid values are <b>rsa</b> and <b>ec</b>. Default is <b>rsa</b>.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>rsa</b>

   <b>keylength</b>
       The bit length of keys.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>4096</b>

   <b>lastrunfile</b>
       Where puppet agent stores the last run report summary in yaml format.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$publicdir/last_run_summary.yaml</b>

   <b>lastrunreport</b>
       Where  Puppet  Agent stores the last run report, by default, in yaml format. The format of the report can
       be   changed   by   setting   the   <b>cache</b>   key   of   the   <b>report</b>   terminus   in    the    routes.yaml
       <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/config_file_routes.html</u>  file.  To avoid mismatches between content
       and file extension, this setting needs to be manually updated to reflect the terminus changes.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$statedir/last_run_report.yaml</b>

   <b>ldapattrs</b>
       The LDAP attributes to include when querying LDAP for nodes. All returned attributes are set as variables
       in the top-level  scope.  Multiple  values  should  be  comma-separated.  The  value  'all'  returns  all
       attributes.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>all</b>

   <b>ldapbase</b>
       The  search  base  for  LDAP searches. It's impossible to provide a meaningful default here, although the
       LDAP libraries might have one already set. Generally, it should be the 'ou=Hosts' branch under your  main
       directory.

   <b>ldapclassattrs</b>
       The LDAP attributes to use to define Puppet classes. Values should be comma-separated.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>puppetclass</b>

   <b>ldapparentattr</b>
       The attribute to use to define the parent node.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>parentnode</b>

   <b>ldappassword</b>
       The password to use to connect to LDAP.

   <b>ldapport</b>
       The LDAP port.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>389</b>

   <b>ldapserver</b>
       The LDAP server.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>ldap</b>

   <b>ldapssl</b>
       Whether  SSL  should  be  used  when  searching for nodes. Defaults to false because SSL usually requires
       certificates to be set up on the client side.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>ldapstackedattrs</b>
       The LDAP attributes that should be stacked to arrays by adding the values in all  hierarchy  elements  of
       the tree. Values should be comma-separated.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>puppetvar</b>

   <b>ldapstring</b>
       The search string used to find an LDAP node.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>(&amp;(objectclass=puppetClient)(cn=%s))</b>

   <b>ldaptls</b>
       Whether  TLS  should  be  used  when  searching for nodes. Defaults to false because TLS usually requires
       certificates to be set up on the client side.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>ldapuser</b>
       The user to use to connect to LDAP. Must be specified as a full DN.

   <b>libdir</b>
       An extra search path for Puppet. This is only useful for those files that Puppet will load on demand, and
       is only guaranteed to work for those cases. In fact, the autoload mechanism  is  responsible  for  making
       sure this directory is in Ruby's search path

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$vardir/lib</b>

   <b>localcacert</b>
       Where each client stores the CA certificate.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$certdir/ca.pem</b>

   <b>localedest</b>
       Where Puppet should store translation files that it pulls down from the central server.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$vardir/locales</b>

   <b>localesource</b>
       From  where  to  retrieve  translation  files.  The  standard  Puppet <b>file</b> type is used for retrieval, so
       anything that is a valid file source can be used here.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>puppet:///locales</b>

   <b>location_trusted</b>
       This will allow sending the name + password and the cookie header to all hosts that puppet  may  redirect
       to.  This  may  or  may not introduce a security breach if puppet redirects you to a site to which you'll
       send your authentication info and cookies.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>log_level</b>
       Default logging level for messages from Puppet. Allowed values are:

       •   debug

       •   err

       •   alert

       •   emerg

       •   crit

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>notice</b>

   <b>logdest</b>
       Where to send log messages. Choose between 'syslog' (the POSIX syslog service), 'eventlog'  (the  Windows
       Event  Log),  'console',  or  the  path  to  a  log  file. Multiple destinations can be set using a comma
       separated list (eg: <b>/path/file1,console,/path/file2</b>)

       •   <u>Default</u>: ``

   <b>logdir</b>
       The directory in which to store log files

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>Unix/Linux:</b> <b>/var/log/puppetlabs/puppet</b> <b>--</b> <b>Windows:</b>  <b>C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\puppet\var\log</b>
           <b>--</b> <b>Non-root</b> <b>user:</b> <b><a href="file:~/.puppetlabs/var/log">~/.puppetlabs/var/log</a></b>

   <b>manage_internal_file_permissions</b>
       Whether  Puppet  should  manage the owner, group, and mode of files it uses internally. <b>Note</b>: For Windows
       agents, the default is <b>false</b> for versions 4.10.13 and greater, versions 5.5.6 and greater,  and  versions
       6.0 and greater.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>true</b>

   <b>manifest</b>
       The  entry-point  manifest for the primary server. This can be one file or a directory of manifests to be
       evaluated in alphabetical order. Puppet manages this path as a directory if one exists  or  if  the  path
       ends with a / or .

       Setting  a  global  value  for  <b>manifest</b> in puppet.conf is not allowed (but it can be overridden from the
       commandline). Please use directory environments instead. If you need to  use  something  other  than  the
       environment's  <b>manifests</b>  directory  as  the main manifest, you can set <b>manifest</b> in environment.conf. For
       more info, see <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/environments_about.html</u>

       •   <u>Default</u>: ``

   <b>masterport</b>
       The default port puppet subcommands use to communicate with  Puppet  Server.  (eg  <b>puppet</b>  <b>facts</b>  <b>upload</b>,
       <b>puppet</b> <b>agent</b>). May be overridden by more specific settings (see <b>ca_port</b>, <b>report_port</b>).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>8140</b>

   <b>max_deprecations</b>
       Sets  the  max  number  of  logged/displayed  parser  validation  deprecation  warnings  in case multiple
       deprecation warnings have been detected. A value of 0 blocks the logging  of  deprecation  warnings.  The
       count is per manifest.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>10</b>

   <b>max_errors</b>
       Sets  the  max  number  of  logged/displayed  parser  validation errors in case multiple errors have been
       detected. A value of 0 is the same as a value of 1; a minimum of one error is always raised. The count is
       per manifest.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>10</b>

   <b>max_warnings</b>
       Sets the max number of logged/displayed parser validation warnings in case multiple  warnings  have  been
       detected. A value of 0 blocks logging of warnings. The count is per manifest.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>10</b>

   <b>maximum_uid</b>
       The  maximum  allowed UID. Some platforms use negative UIDs but then ship with tools that do not know how
       to handle signed ints, so the UIDs show up as huge numbers that can then not be fed back into the system.
       This is a hackish way to fail in a slightly more useful way when that happens.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>4294967290</b>

   <b>maxwaitforcert</b>
       The maximum amount of time the Puppet agent should wait for its certificate request to be signed. A value
       of <b>unlimited</b> will cause puppet agent to ask for a signed certificate indefinitely. This setting can be  a
       time interval in seconds (30 or 30s), minutes (30m), hours (6h), days (2d), or years (5y).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>unlimited</b>

   <b>maxwaitforlock</b>
       The  maximum  amount  of  time the puppet agent should wait for an already running puppet agent to finish
       before starting a new one. This is set by default to 1 minute. A value of  <b>unlimited</b>  will  cause  puppet
       agent  to  wait  indefinitely. This setting can be a time interval in seconds (30 or 30s), minutes (30m),
       hours (6h), days (2d), or years (5y).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>1m</b>

   <b>merge_dependency_warnings</b>
       Whether to merge class-level dependency failure warnings.

       When a class has a failed dependency, every resource in the class generates a notice level message  about
       the dependency failure, and a warning level message about skipping the resource.

       If  true,  all  messages caused by a class dependency failure are merged into one message associated with
       the class.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>mkusers</b>
       Whether to create the necessary user and group that puppet agent will run as.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>module_groups</b>
       Extra module groups to request from the Puppet Forge. This is an internal setting, and users should never
       change it.

       •   <u>Default</u>: ``

   <b>module_repository</b>
       The module repository

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>https://forgeapi.puppet.com</b>

   <b>module_working_dir</b>
       The directory into which module tool data is stored

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$vardir/puppet-module</b>

   <b>modulepath</b>
       The search path for modules, as a list of directories separated by the system path  separator  character.
       (The POSIX path separator is ':', and the Windows path separator is ';'.)

       Setting  a  global  value for <b>modulepath</b> in puppet.conf is not allowed (but it can be overridden from the
       commandline). Please use directory environments instead. If you need to  use  something  other  than  the
       default  modulepath  of  <b>&lt;ACTIVE</b>  <b>ENVIRONMENT'S</b>  <b>MODULES</b>  <b>DIR&gt;:$basemodulepath</b>, you can set <b>modulepath</b> in
       environment.conf. For more info, see <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/environments_about.html</u>

   <b>name</b>
       The name of the application, if we are running as one. The default is essentially $0 without the path  or
       <b>.rb</b>.

       •   <u>Default</u>: ``

   <b>named_curve</b>
       The  short  name  for  the  EC curve used to generate the EC private key. Valid values must be one of the
       curves in <b>OpenSSL::PKey::EC.builtin_curves</b>. Default is <b>prime256v1</b>.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>prime256v1</b>

   <b>no_proxy</b>
       List of host or domain names that should not go through <b>http_proxy_host</b>. Environment variable no_proxy or
       NO_PROXY will override this  value.  Names  can  be  specified  as  an  FQDN  <b>host.example.com</b>,  wildcard
       <b>*.example.com</b>, dotted domain <b>.example.com</b>, or suffix <b>example.com</b>.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>localhost,</b> <b>127.0.0.1</b>

   <b>node_cache_terminus</b>
       How to store cached nodes. Valid values are (none), 'json', 'msgpack', or 'yaml'.

       •   <u>Default</u>: ``

   <b>node_name_fact</b>
       The  fact  name  used  to  determine  the  node name used for all requests the agent makes to the primary
       server. WARNING: This setting is mutually exclusive with  node_name_value.  Changing  this  setting  also
       requires          changes          to          Puppet          Server's         default         auth.conf
       <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppetserver/latest/config_file_auth.html</u>.

   <b>node_name_value</b>
       The explicit value used for the node name for all  requests  the  agent  makes  to  the  primary  server.
       WARNING:  This  setting  is  mutually  exclusive with node_name_fact. Changing this setting also requires
       changes             to             Puppet             Server's             default              auth.conf
       <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppetserver/latest/config_file_auth.html</u>.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$certname</b>

   <b>node_terminus</b>
       Which node data plugin to use when compiling node catalogs.

       When  Puppet  compiles  a catalog, it combines two primary sources of info: the main manifest, and a node
       data plugin (often called a "node terminus," for historical reasons). Node  data  plugins  provide  three
       things for a given node name:

       1.  A list of classes to add to that node's catalog (and, optionally, values for their parameters).

       2.  Which Puppet environment the node should use.

       3.  A list of additional top-scope variables to set.

       The three main node data plugins are:

       •   <b>plain</b> -- Returns no data, so that the main manifest controls all node configuration.

       •   <b>exec</b>         --         Uses         an         external         node         classifier        (ENC)
           <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/nodes_external.html</u>, configured by the <b>external_nodes</b>  setting.
           This  lets  you  pull a list of Puppet classes from any external system, using a small glue script to
           perform the request and format the result as YAML.

       •   <b>classifier</b> (formerly <b>console</b>) -- Specific to Puppet Enterprise. Uses the PE console for node data."

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>plain</b>

   <b>noop</b>
       Whether to apply catalogs in noop mode, which allows Puppet to partially  simulate  a  normal  run.  This
       setting affects puppet agent and puppet apply.

       When  running in noop mode, Puppet will check whether each resource is in sync, like it does when running
       normally. However, if a resource attribute is not in the desired state  (as  declared  in  the  catalog),
       Puppet  will  take  no  action,  and  will instead report the changes it <u>would</u> have made. These simulated
       changes will appear in the report sent to the primary Puppet server,  or  be  shown  on  the  console  if
       running  puppet  agent  or  puppet  apply  in the foreground. The simulated changes will not send refresh
       events to any subscribing or notified resources, although Puppet will log that a refresh event <u>would</u> have
       been sent.

       <b>Important</b>  <b>note:</b>  The  <b>noop</b>  metaparameter  <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/metaparameter.html#noop</u>
       allows  you  to  apply  individual resources in noop mode, and will override the global value of the <b>noop</b>
       setting. This means a resource with <b>noop</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>false</b> <u>will</u> be changed if necessary, even when running  puppet
       agent  with <b>noop</b> <b>=</b> <b>true</b> or <b>--noop</b>. (Conversely, a resource with <b>noop</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>true</b> will only be simulated, even
       when noop mode is globally disabled.)

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>number_of_facts_soft_limit</b>
       The soft limit for the total number of fact values. This counts the child elements of all facts (e.g. all
       items of an array or a hash), not just top level facts.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>10240</b>

   <b>onetime</b>
       Perform one configuration run and exit, rather than spawning a long-running daemon. This  is  useful  for
       interactively running puppet agent, or running puppet agent from cron.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>passfile</b>
       Where puppet agent stores the password for its private key. Generally unused.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$privatedir/password</b>

   <b>path</b>
       The shell search path. Defaults to whatever is inherited from the parent process.

       This setting can only be set in the <b>[main]</b> section of puppet.conf; it cannot be set in <b>[server]</b>, <b>[agent]</b>,
       or an environment config section.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>none</b>

   <b>payload_soft_limit</b>
       The soft limit for the size of the payload.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>16777216</b>

   <b>pidfile</b>
       The  file containing the PID of a running process. This file is intended to be used by service management
       frameworks and monitoring systems to determine if a puppet process is still in the process table.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$rundir/${run_mode}.pid</b>

   <b>plugindest</b>
       Where Puppet should store plugins that it pulls down from the central server.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$libdir</b>

   <b>pluginfactdest</b>
       Where Puppet should store external facts that are being handled by pluginsync

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$vardir/facts.d</b>

   <b>pluginfactsource</b>
       Where to retrieve external facts for pluginsync

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>puppet:///pluginfacts</b>

   <b>pluginsignore</b>
       What files to ignore when pulling down plugins.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>.svn</b> <b>CVS</b> <b>.git</b> <b>.hg</b>

   <b>pluginsource</b>
       From where to retrieve plugins. The standard Puppet <b>file</b> type is used for retrieval, so anything that  is
       a valid file source can be used here.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>puppet:///plugins</b>

   <b>pluginsync</b>
       Whether plugins should be synced with the central server. This setting is deprecated.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>true</b>

   <b>postrun_command</b>
       A command to run after every agent run. If this command returns a non-zero return code, the entire Puppet
       run will be considered to have failed, even though it might have performed work during the normal run.

   <b>preferred_serialization_format</b>
       The  preferred  means  of serializing ruby instances for passing over the wire. This won't guarantee that
       all instances will be serialized using this method, since not all classes can be  guaranteed  to  support
       this format, but it will be used for all classes that support it.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>json</b>

   <b>preprocess_deferred</b>
       Whether  Puppet  should  call  deferred  functions  before  applying  the  catalog.  If  set to <b>true</b>, all
       prerequisites required for the deferred function must be satisfied before  the  Puppet  run.  If  set  to
       <b>false</b>,  deferred  functions follow Puppet relationships and ordering. In this way, Puppet can install the
       prerequisites required for a deferred function and call the deferred function in the same run.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>prerun_command</b>
       A command to run before every agent run. If this command returns  a  non-zero  return  code,  the  entire
       Puppet run will fail.

   <b>preview_outputdir</b>
       The directory where catalog previews per node are generated.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$vardir/preview</b>

   <b>priority</b>
       The  scheduling  priority  of the process. Valid values are 'high', 'normal', 'low', or 'idle', which are
       mapped to platform-specific values. The priority can also be specified as an integer value  and  will  be
       passed  as  is,  e.g.  -5.  Puppet  must  be running as a privileged user in order to increase scheduling
       priority.

       •   <u>Default</u>: ``

   <b>privatedir</b>
       Where the client stores private certificate information.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$ssldir/private</b>

   <b>privatekeydir</b>
       The private key directory.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$ssldir/private_keys</b>

   <b>profile</b>
       Whether to enable experimental performance profiling

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>publicdir</b>
       Where Puppet stores public files.

       •   <u>Default</u>:          <b>Unix/Linux:</b>           <b>/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/public</b>           <b>--</b>           <b>Windows:</b>

   <b>publickeydir</b>
       The public key directory.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$ssldir/public_keys</b>

   <b>puppet_trace</b>
       Whether to print the Puppet stack trace on some errors. This is a noop if <b>trace</b> is also set.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>puppetdlog</b>
       The fallback log file. This is only used when the <b>--logdest</b> option is not specified AND Puppet is running
       on  an  operating  system  where both the POSIX syslog service and the Windows Event Log are unavailable.
       (Currently, no supported operating systems match that description.)

       Despite the name, both puppet agent and puppet  server  will  use  this  file  as  the  fallback  logging
       destination.

       For  control  over  logging  destinations,  see the <b>--logdest</b> command line option in the manual pages for
       puppet server, puppet agent, and puppet apply. You can see  man  pages  by  running  <b>puppet</b>  <b>&lt;SUBCOMMAND&gt;</b>
       <b>--help</b>, or read them online at https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/man/.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$logdir/puppetd.log</b>

   <b>report</b>
       Whether to send reports after every transaction.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>true</b>

   <b>report_configured_environmentpath</b>
       Specifies  how  environment  paths  are  reported.  When the value of <b>versioned_environment_dirs</b> is <b>true</b>,
       Puppet applies the readlink function to the <b>environmentpath</b> setting when constructing  the  environment's
       modulepath.  The  full  readlinked  path  is  referred to as the "resolved path," and the configured path
       potentially containing symlinks is the "configured path." When reporting where resources come from, users
       may choose between the configured and resolved path.

       When set to <b>false</b>, the resolved paths are reported instead of the configured paths.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>true</b>

   <b>report_include_system_store</b>
       Whether the 'http' report processor should include the system certificate store when  submitting  reports
       to  HTTPS  URLs.  If  false,  then  the  'http'  processor  will  only  trust  HTTPS report servers whose
       certificates are issued by the puppet CA or one of its intermediate CAs.  If  true,  the  processor  will
       additionally trust CA certificates in the system's certificate store.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>report_port</b>
       The port to communicate with the report_server.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$serverport</b>

   <b>report_server</b>
       The server to send transaction reports to.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$server</b>

   <b>reportdir</b>
       The  directory  in which to store reports. Each node gets a separate subdirectory in this directory. This
       setting is only used when the <b>store</b> report processor is enabled (see the <b>reports</b> setting).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$vardir/reports</b>

   <b>reports</b>
       The list of report handlers  to  use.  When  using  multiple  report  handlers,  their  names  should  be
       comma-separated, with whitespace allowed. (For example, <b>reports</b> <b>=</b> <b>http,</b> <b>store</b>.)

       This  setting  is  relevant  to puppet server and puppet apply. The primary Puppet server will call these
       report handlers with the reports it receives from agent nodes, and puppet apply will call them  with  its
       own report. (In all cases, the node applying the catalog must have <b>report</b> <b>=</b> <b>true</b>.)

       See the report reference for information on the built-in report handlers; custom report handlers can also
       be loaded from modules. (Report handlers are loaded from the lib directory, at <b>puppet/reports/NAME.rb</b>.)

       To turn off reports entirely, set this to <b>none</b>

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>none</b>

   <b>reporturl</b>
       The  URL that reports should be forwarded to. This setting is only used when the <b>http</b> report processor is
       enabled (see the <b>reports</b> setting).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b><a href="http://localhost">http://localhost</a>:3000/reports/upload</b>

   <b>requestdir</b>
       Where host certificate requests are stored.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$ssldir/certificate_requests</b>

   <b>resourcefile</b>
       The file  in  which  puppet  agent  stores  a  list  of  the  resources  associated  with  the  retrieved
       configuration.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$statedir/resources.txt</b>

   <b>resubmit_facts</b>
       Whether  to  send  updated  facts  after  every  transaction. By default puppet only submits facts at the
       beginning of the transaction before applying a catalog. Since puppet can modify the state of the  system,
       the  value of the facts may change after puppet finishes. Therefore, any facts stored in puppetdb may not
       be consistent until the agent next runs, typically in 30 minutes. If this feature is enabled, puppet will
       resubmit facts after applying its catalog, ensuring facts for the node stored in  puppetdb  are  current.
       However, this will double the fact submission load on puppetdb, so it is disabled by default.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>rich_data</b>
       Enables  having extended data in the catalog by storing them as a hash with the special key <b>__ptype</b>. When
       enabled, resource containing values of the data types <b>Binary</b>, <b>Regexp</b>, <b>SemVer</b>, <b>SemVerRange</b>,  <b>Timespan</b>  and
       <b>Timestamp</b>, as well as instances of types derived from <b>Object</b> retain their data type.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>true</b>

   <b>route_file</b>
       The YAML file containing indirector route configuration.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$confdir/routes.yaml</b>

   <b>rundir</b>
       Where Puppet PID files are kept.

       •   <u>Default</u>:  <b>Unix/Linux:</b>  <b>/var/run/puppetlabs</b>  <b>--</b>  <b>Windows:</b>  <b>C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\puppet\var\run</b> <b>--</b>
           <b>Non-root</b> <b>user:</b> <b><a href="file:~/.puppetlabs/var/run">~/.puppetlabs/var/run</a></b>

   <b>runinterval</b>
       How often puppet agent applies the catalog. Note that a runinterval of 0 means "run continuously"  rather
       than  "never run." This setting can be a time interval in seconds (30 or 30s), minutes (30m), hours (6h),
       days (2d), or years (5y).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>30m</b>

   <b>runtimeout</b>
       The maximum amount of time an agent run is allowed to take. A Puppet agent run that exceeds this  timeout
       will  be  aborted.  A  value  of  0  disables the timeout. Defaults to 1 hour. This setting can be a time
       interval in seconds (30 or 30s), minutes (30m), hours (6h), days (2d), or years (5y).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>1h</b>

   <b>serial</b>
       Where the serial number for certificates is stored.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$cadir/serial</b>

   <b>server</b>
       The primary Puppet server to which the Puppet agent should connect.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>puppet</b>

   <b>server_datadir</b>
       The directory in which serialized data is stored, usually in a subdirectory.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$vardir/server_data</b>

   <b>server_list</b>
       The list of primary Puppet servers to which the Puppet agent should connect, in the order that they  will
       be  tried.  Each  value  should  be  a  fully qualified domain name, followed by an optional ':' and port
       number. If a port is omitted, Puppet uses masterport for that host.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>[]</b>

   <b>serverport</b>
       The default port puppet subcommands use to communicate with  Puppet  Server.  (eg  <b>puppet</b>  <b>facts</b>  <b>upload</b>,
       <b>puppet</b> <b>agent</b>). May be overridden by more specific settings (see <b>ca_port</b>, <b>report_port</b>).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>8140</b>

   <b>settings_catalog</b>
       Whether to compile and apply the settings catalog

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>true</b>

   <b>show_diff</b>
       Whether  to  log  and  report  a  contextual diff when files are being replaced. This causes partial file
       contents to pass through Puppet's normal logging and reporting system, so this  setting  should  be  used
       with  caution  if  you  are  sending  Puppet's reports to an insecure destination. This feature currently
       requires the <b>diff/lcs</b> Ruby library.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>signeddir</b>
       Where the CA stores signed certificates.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$cadir/signed</b>

   <b>skip_logging_catalog_request_destination</b>
       Specifies whether to suppress the notice of  which  compiler  supplied  the  catalog.  A  value  of  <b>true</b>
       suppresses the notice.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>skip_tags</b>
       Tags  to  use to filter resources. If this is set, then only resources not tagged with the specified tags
       will be applied. Values must be comma-separated.

   <b>sourceaddress</b>
       The address the agent should use to initiate requests.

       •   <u>Default</u>: ``

   <b>splay</b>
       Whether to sleep for a random amount of time, ranging from immediately  up  to  its  <b>$splaylimit</b>,  before
       performing its first agent run after a service restart. After this period, the agent runs periodically on
       its <b>$runinterval</b>.

       For  example,  assume  a  default 30-minute <b>$runinterval</b>, <b>splay</b> set to its default of <b>false</b>, and an agent
       starting at :00 past the hour. The agent would check in every 30 minutes at :01 and :31 past the hour.

       With <b>splay</b> enabled, it waits any amount of time up to its <b>$splaylimit</b> before its first run. For  example,
       it might randomly wait 8 minutes, then start its first run at :08 past the hour. With the <b>$runinterval</b> at
       its default 30 minutes, its next run will be at :38 past the hour.

       If  you restart an agent's puppet service with <b>splay</b> enabled, it recalculates its splay period and delays
       its first agent run after restarting for this new period. If you simultaneously restart a group of puppet
       agents with <b>splay</b> enabled, their checkins to your primary servers can be distributed more evenly.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>splaylimit</b>
       The maximum time to delay before an agent's first run when <b>splay</b> is  enabled.  Defaults  to  the  agent's
       <b>$runinterval</b>.  The <b>splay</b> interval is random and recalculated each time the agent is started or restarted.
       This setting can be a time interval in seconds (30 or 30s), minutes (30m),  hours  (6h),  days  (2d),  or
       years (5y).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$runinterval</b>

   <b>srv_domain</b>
       The domain which will be queried to find the SRV records of servers to use.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>example.com</b>

   <b>ssl_client_header</b>
       The  header  containing  an  authenticated  client's  SSL DN. This header must be set by the proxy to the
       authenticated client's SSL DN (e.g., <b>/CN=puppet.puppetlabs.com</b>). Puppet will parse out  the  Common  Name
       (CN) from the Distinguished Name (DN) and use the value of the CN field for authorization.

       Note  that  the  name of the HTTP header gets munged by the web server common gateway interface: an <b>HTTP_</b>
       prefix is added, dashes are converted to underscores, and all letters are uppercased. Thus,  to  use  the
       <b>X-Client-DN</b> header, this setting should be <b>HTTP_X_CLIENT_DN</b>.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>HTTP_X_CLIENT_DN</b>

   <b>ssl_client_verify_header</b>
       The header containing the status message of the client verification. This header must be set by the proxy
       to 'SUCCESS' if the client successfully authenticated, and anything else otherwise.

       Note  that  the  name of the HTTP header gets munged by the web server common gateway interface: an <b>HTTP_</b>
       prefix is added, dashes are converted to underscores, and all letters are uppercased. Thus,  to  use  the
       <b>X-Client-Verify</b> header, this setting should be <b>HTTP_X_CLIENT_VERIFY</b>.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>HTTP_X_CLIENT_VERIFY</b>

   <b>ssl_lockfile</b>
       A lock file to indicate that the ssl bootstrap process is currently in progress.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$ssldir/ssl.lock</b>

   <b>ssl_trust_store</b>
       A file containing CA certificates in PEM format that puppet should trust when making HTTPS requests. This
       <b>only</b> applies to https requests to non-puppet infrastructure, such as retrieving file metadata and content
       from https file sources, puppet module tool and the 'http' report processor. This setting is ignored when
       making requests to puppet:// URLs such as catalog and report requests.

       •   <u>Default</u>: ``

   <b>ssldir</b>
       Where SSL certificates are kept.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$confdir/ssl</b>

   <b>statedir</b>
       The directory where Puppet state is stored. Generally, this directory can be removed without causing harm
       (although it might result in spurious service restarts).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$vardir/state</b>

   <b>statefile</b>
       Where  Puppet  agent and Puppet Server store state associated with the running configuration. In the case
       of Puppet Server, this file reflects the state discovered through interacting with clients.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$statedir/state.yaml</b>

   <b>statettl</b>
       How long the Puppet agent should cache when a resource was last checked or synced. This setting can be  a
       time  interval  in seconds (30 or 30s), minutes (30m), hours (6h), days (2d), or years (5y). A value of <b>0</b>
       or <b>unlimited</b> will disable cache pruning.

       This setting affects the usage of <b>schedule</b> resources, as the information about when a resource  was  last
       checked  (and therefore when it needs to be checked again) is stored in the <b>statefile</b>. The <b>statettl</b> needs
       to be large enough to ensure that a resource will not trigger multiple times during a schedule due to its
       entry expiring from the cache.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>32d</b>

   <b>static_catalogs</b>
       Whether               to               compile               a               static               catalog
       <u>https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/static_catalogs.html#enabling-or-disabling-static-catalogs</u>,   which
       occurs only on Puppet Server when the <b>code-id-command</b> and <b>code-content-command</b> settings are configured in
       its <b>puppetserver.conf</b> file.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>true</b>

   <b>storeconfigs</b>
       Whether to store each client's configuration, including catalogs, facts,  and  related  data.  This  also
       enables  the  import  and export of resources in the Puppet language - a mechanism for exchange resources
       between nodes.

       By default this uses the 'puppetdb' backend.

       You can adjust the backend using the storeconfigs_backend setting.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>storeconfigs_backend</b>
       Configure the backend terminus used for StoreConfigs. By default, this uses  the  PuppetDB  store,  which
       must be installed and configured before turning on StoreConfigs.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>puppetdb</b>

   <b>strict</b>
       The strictness level of puppet. Allowed values are:

       •   off - do not perform extra validation, do not report

       •   warning - perform extra validation, report as warning

       •   error - perform extra validation, fail with error (default)

       The  strictness  level  is  for both language semantics and runtime evaluation validation. In addition to
       controlling the behavior with this primary server switch some individual warnings may also be  controlled
       by the disable_warnings setting.

       No  new validations will be added to a micro (x.y.z) release, but may be added in minor releases (x.y.0).
       In major releases it expected that most (if not all) strictness validation become standard behavior.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>error</b>

   <b>strict_environment_mode</b>
       Whether the agent specified environment should be considered authoritative, causing the run  to  fail  if
       the retrieved catalog does not match it.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>strict_variables</b>
       Causes  an  evaluation  error  when  referencing  unknown  variables.  (This  does not affect referencing
       variables that are explicitly set to undef).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>true</b>

   <b>summarize</b>
       Whether to print a transaction summary.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>supported_checksum_types</b>
       Checksum types supported by this agent for use in file resources of a  static  catalog.  Values  must  be
       comma-separated.  Valid  types  are  sha256,  sha256lite,  sha384,  sha512,  sha224, sha1, sha1lite, md5,
       md5lite, mtime, ctime. Default is sha256, sha384, sha512, sha224, md5.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>["sha256",</b> <b>"sha384",</b> <b>"sha512",</b> <b>"sha224",</b> <b>"md5"]</b>

   <b>syslogfacility</b>
       What syslog facility to use when logging to syslog. Syslog has a fixed list of valid facilities, and  you
       must choose one of those; you cannot just make one up.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>daemon</b>

   <b>tags</b>
       Tags to use to find resources. If this is set, then only resources tagged with the specified tags will be
       applied. Values must be comma-separated.

   <b>tasks</b>
       Turns  on  experimental  support for tasks and plans in the puppet language. This is for internal API use
       only. Do not change this setting.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>top_level_facts_soft_limit</b>
       The soft limit for the number of top level facts.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>512</b>

   <b>trace</b>
       Whether to print stack traces on some errors. Will print  internal  Ruby  stack  trace  interleaved  with
       Puppet function frames.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>transactionstorefile</b>
       Transactional  storage  file  for  persisting  data  between  transactions  for the purposes of inferring
       information (such as corrective_change) on new data received.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$statedir/transactionstore.yaml</b>

   <b>trusted_external_command</b>
       The external trusted facts script or directory to use. This setting's value can be set to the path to  an
       executable  command that can produce external trusted facts or to a directory containing those executable
       commands. The command(s) must:

       •   Take the name of a node as a command-line argument.

       •   Return a JSON hash with the external trusted facts for this node.

       •   For unknown or invalid nodes, exit with a non-zero exit code.

       If the setting points to an executable command, then the external trusted facts will  be  stored  in  the
       'external'  key  of  the  trusted  facts  hash.  Otherwise for each executable file in the directory, the
       external trusted facts will be stored in the <b>&lt;basename&gt;</b> key of the <b>trusted['external']</b> hash. For example,
       if the files foo.rb and bar.sh are in the directory, then <b>trusted['external']</b> will be the hash <b>{</b> <b>'foo'</b> <b>=&gt;</b>
       <b>&lt;foo.rb</b> <b>output&gt;,</b> <b>'bar'</b> <b>=&gt;</b> <b>&lt;bar.sh</b> <b>output&gt;</b> <b>}</b>.

       •   <u>Default</u>: ``

   <b>trusted_oid_mapping_file</b>
       File that provides mapping between custom SSL oids and user-friendly names

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$confdir/custom_trusted_oid_mapping.yaml</b>

   <b>use_cached_catalog</b>
       Whether to only use the cached catalog rather than compiling a new catalog on every run.  Puppet  can  be
       run  with  this  enabled  by default and then selectively disabled when a recompile is desired. Because a
       Puppet agent using cached catalogs does not contact the primary server for a new catalog,  it  also  does
       not upload facts at the beginning of the Puppet run.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>use_last_environment</b>
       Puppet saves both the initial and converged environment in the last_run_summary file. If they differ, and
       this setting is set to true, we will use the last converged environment and skip the node request.

       When  set to false, we will do the node request and ignore the environment data from the last_run_summary
       file.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>true</b>

   <b>use_srv_records</b>
       Whether the server will search for SRV records in DNS for the current domain.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>usecacheonfailure</b>
       Whether to use the cached configuration when the remote configuration will not compile.  This  option  is
       useful  for  testing  new  configurations,  where  you  want  to fix the broken configuration rather than
       reverting to a known-good one.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>true</b>

   <b>user</b>
       The user Puppet Server will run as. Used to ensure the agent side processes (agent,  apply,  etc)  create
       files and directories readable by Puppet Server when necessary.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>puppet</b>

   <b>vardir</b>
       Where  Puppet stores dynamic and growing data. The default for this setting is calculated specially, like
       <b>confdir</b>_.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>Unix/Linux:</b> <b>/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/cache</b> <b>--</b> <b>Windows:</b>  <b>C:\ProgramData\PuppetLabs\puppet\cache</b>
           <b>--</b> <b>Non-root</b> <b>user:</b> <b><a href="file:~/.puppetlabs/opt/puppet/cache">~/.puppetlabs/opt/puppet/cache</a></b>

   <b>vendormoduledir</b>
       The  directory  containing <b>vendored</b> modules. These modules will be used by <u>all</u> environments like those in
       the <b>basemodulepath</b>. The only difference is that modules in the  <b>basemodulepath</b>  are  pluginsynced,  while
       vendored modules are not

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>/usr/share/puppet/vendor_modules</b>

   <b>versioned_environment_dirs</b>
       Whether    or    not    to    look    for    versioned    environment    directories,    symlinked   from
       <b>$environmentpath/&lt;environment&gt;</b>. This is an experimental feature and should be used with caution.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>false</b>

   <b>waitforcert</b>
       How frequently puppet agent should ask for a signed certificate.

       When starting for the first time, puppet agent will submit a certificate signing  request  (CSR)  to  the
       server named in the <b>ca_server</b> setting (usually the primary Puppet server); this may be autosigned, or may
       need to be approved by a human, depending on the CA server's configuration.

       Puppet  agent  cannot  apply  configurations  until  its  approved  certificate  is  available. Since the
       certificate may or may not be available immediately, puppet agent will repeatedly try to fetch it at this
       interval. You can turn off waiting for certificates by specifying a time of 0, or  a  maximum  amount  of
       time to wait in the <b>maxwaitforcert</b> setting, in which case puppet agent will exit if it cannot get a cert.
       This  setting  can  be  a  time interval in seconds (30 or 30s), minutes (30m), hours (6h), days (2d), or
       years (5y).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>2m</b>

   <b>waitforlock</b>
       How frequently puppet agent should try running when there is an already ongoing puppet agent instance.

       This argument is by default disabled (value set to 0). In this case puppet agent will immediately exit if
       it cannot run at that moment. When a value other than 0 is set, this can also be used in combination with
       the <b>maxwaitforlock</b> argument. This setting can be a time interval in seconds (30 or 30s),  minutes  (30m),
       hours (6h), days (2d), or years (5y).

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>0</b>

   <b>write_catalog_summary</b>
       Whether  to  write  the  <b>classfile</b> and <b>resourcefile</b> after applying the catalog. It is enabled by default,
       except when running <b>puppet</b> <b>apply</b>.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>true</b>

   <b>yamldir</b>
       The directory in which YAML data is stored, usually in a subdirectory.

       •   <u>Default</u>: <b>$vardir/yaml</b>
