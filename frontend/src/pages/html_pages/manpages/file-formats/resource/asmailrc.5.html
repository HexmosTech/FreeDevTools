</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>asmailrc</b> - the asmail resource file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$HOME/.asmailrc</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>asmailrc</b> is a resource file that describes the configuration of the <b><a href="../man1/asmail.1.html">asmail</a></b>(1) program.

</pre><h4><b>RESOURCE</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       The  syntax  is based on grouping relevant options with <b>{}</b> (curly braces). The keyword before the opening
       brace tells <b>asmail</b> what this section is related to. The keywords in one section may be  invalid  or  have
       different semantics in another section.

       All  keywords  are  case-insensitive, so there is no difference between "mailbox" and "Mailbox". However,
       the values you give to the file names, user names and so on  are  case-sensitive  as  is  usual  on  Unix
       systems.  Comments  start  with  the  <b>#</b> (hash sign) and run until the end of the line. Comments and blank
       lines are ignored.

       There are two main sections within the resource file. Each of them may be completely omitted, as well  as
       other  sections  and settings may be omitted. <b>asmail</b> will try to use default values for everything you do
       not specify.

       The later values overwrite earlier values. It is perfectly acceptable to specify any option twice and the
       last value will be used. One exception from this is the <b>animate{}</b> section where pixmap files are added to
       the list by multiple occurences of the keywords.

       Section name must be followed by <b>{</b> (opening brace) on the same line. The end of a section is signalled by
       <b>}</b> (closing brace) alone on a line.

       x11
              The top-level section describing the GUI settings.

       mailbox
              The top-level section describing the mailboxes to be monitored

       stat
              The section may appear within the <b>x11{}</b> section.  This section describes what statistics should be
              shown on the screen.

       animate
              The section may appear within the <b>x11{}</b> section.  This section describes the pixmaps that will  be
              used instead of the default ones and the settings for the animation.

</pre><h4><b>x11</b> <b>section</b></h4><pre>
       The x11 section specifies how the application looks on the screen.  There may be multiple <b>x11{}</b> sections,
       the settings from all of them are merged and later settings overwrite earlier settings.

       beep [yes|no]
              When  <b>beep</b>  is  on,  the  tool will signal arrival of new e-mail by the system beep via the system
              speaker.

              Default is <b>yes</b>.

       shape [yes|no]
              Specifies whether the <b>Shape</b> extensions of X11 will be  used  for  drawing  the  pixmaps  that  are
              specified by <u>frame</u>, <u>nomail</u>, <u>old</u> and <u>new</u> keywords in the settings file.

              When  the  Shape  extensions are used, the tool will use the transparency settings of the pixmaps.
              That is, when a pixmap contains transparent pixels, those pixels will become actually  transparent
              on the screen. With the Shape extensions disabled, the transparent pixels will show up filled with
              the background color.

              The  <b>Shape</b> extension is rather expensive on the CPU power and may slow down things a lot on a slow
              machine.

              Default is <b>no</b>.

       on_mouse_left comand &amp;
              The <b>command</b> will be executed when the application window is clicked with the left mouse button.

              Default is <b>none</b>.

       on_mouse_middle comand &amp;
              Same as <b>on_mouse_left</b> for the middle mouse button.

       on_mouse_right comand &amp;
              Same as <b>on_mouse_left</b> for the right mouse button.

       on_new_mail command &amp;
              The <b>command</b> will be executed once for each mailbox when the e-mail arrives to that mailbox.

              Default is <b>none</b>.

</pre><h4><b>mailbox</b> <b>section</b></h4><pre>
       The resource file should contain as many <b>mailbox{}</b> sections as  the  number  of  mailboxes  you  want  to
       monitor. Each section will create a separate monitor for the given mailbox.

       type [ mbox | maildir | mh | pop3 | imap ]
              The  type  of  the  mailbox.  <b>mbox</b> is the standard UNIX mailbox file. <b>maildir</b> is the newer Maildir
              format.  <b>mh</b> is the mH mail directory format.  <b>pop3</b> is for the mailboxes on POP3 servers.  <b>imap</b>  is
              a mailbox on the IMAP server.

              Depending  on the type of the mailbox, some settings may take effect while others will be silently
              ignored.

              The following keywords are useful for the <b>mbox</b>:
                  <b>file</b> <b>update</b> <b>unread-is-new</b>

              The following keywords are useful for the <b>maildir</b>:
                  <b>file</b> <b>update</b>

              The following keywords are useful for the <b>mh</b>:
                  <b>file</b> <b>update</b> <b>unread-is-new</b> <b>use-mh-sequences</b>

              The following keywords are useful for the <b>pop3</b>:
                  <b>update</b> <b>auth</b> <b>server</b> <b>user</b> <b>password</b> <b>timeout</b>

              The following keywords are useful for the <b>imap</b>:
                  <b>update</b> <b>server</b> <b>user</b> <b>password</b> <b>mailbox</b> <b>ssl</b> <b>trustedCaDir</b> <b>timeout</b> <b>persistent</b>

       file file-name
              For <b>mbox</b>, <b>mh</b> and <b>maildir</b>, specifies the location of the mailbox in the filesystem.

              Default: <b>none</b>.

              Note: if no <b>mailbox</b> section is present in the configuration  file  or  no  configuration  file  is
              found,  the  value  of  the  environment  variable  <b>$MAIL</b> will be used as the location of the UNIX
              <b>mailbox</b> format mail file.

       update period
              Specifies the period between two updates of this mailbox.  The  mailbox  will  be  updated  <b>period</b>
              seconds after the previous update is finished.

              Default: <b>10</b>.

       unread-is-new [ yes | no ]
              For  <b>mbox</b>  and  <b>mh</b>,  specifies whether the messages which are flagged as unread are counted as new
              messages.

              Default: <b>no</b>.

       use-mh-sequences [ yes | no ]
              For <b>mh</b>, specifies whether asmail should parse the .mh_sequences file in this mH mail directory  to
              count  new messages. If this option is set to "no", then asmail will parse every message in the mH
              directory searching for "Status" headers.

              Default: <b>no</b>.

       auth plain md5
              Specifies the type of authentication allowed for the POP3 service.  <b>plain</b> stands for the cleartext
              password authentication, <b>md5</b> stands for the APOP authentication using MD5 hashes.  You can specify
              either of them or both.

              If both are allowed and the server supports APOP, first APOP will be tried.

              Default: <b>plain</b> <b>md5</b>.

       server server-name
              The server name to connect to.

              Default: none.

       user user-name
              Your user name on the server.

              Default: none.

       password your-password
              Your password on the server.

              Default: none.

       mailbox mailbox-name
              Your mailbox on the server. This is only useful with IMAP servers, you can specify an  alternative
              to the standard "INBOX" value.

              Default: <b>INBOX</b> for IMAP, none for the rest.

       timeout server-timeout
              The connection to the server will time out after <b>server-timeout</b> seconds waiting for the answer.

              Default: <b>60</b>.

       ssl [ yes | no ]
              Use an encrypted connection to the IMAP server.

              Default: <b>no</b>.

       trustedCaDir directory
              A  directory  that  contains  trusted  certificate  authorities. This is used to verify a server's
              certificate when negotiating an encrypted connection.

              Default: none.

       persistent [ yes | no ]
              The connection to the server can be either opened once and kept open  or  the  connection  can  be
              opened  and  closed  every  time  we need to check for the e-mail status, i.e. every <b>update</b> <b>period</b>
              seconds. If you do not want the connection set-up and login procedure to execute every  time,  set
              this to <b>yes</b>.

              Default: <b>no</b>.

</pre><h4><b>stat</b> <b>section</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  relates  to the representation on the screen of mailbox status and counters. There are the
       following elements in this representation:

           <b>mailbox</b> <b>state</b>
           A letter <b>R</b> appears whenever the mailbox is
           being updated.

           <b>error</b> <b>state</b>
           A letter appears that shows the error state of
           the mailbox.
           The letters may be folowing:
             <b>L</b> - login procedure failed
             <b>T</b> - timeout while waiting for server response
             <b>C</b> - connection problem
             <b>F</b> - general fault indication
           When an error is indicated, <b>asmail</b> prints a
           descriptive message on the standard output.

           <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>messages</b>
           The number of messages is represented by two numbers,
           for the number of new messages and the total number
           of messages.

       The statistics may be displayed for each of the mailboxes separately as well as  for  the  total  of  all
       mailboxes.  When  the  total  is  displayed, the indicators of the mailbox state and the error state will
       report if any of mailboxes are updated or have errors.

       each [ yes | no ]
              Whether the tool should display a line of statistics for each of the mailboxes separately.

              Default: <b>no</b>.

       total [ yes | no ]
              Whether the tool should display the  summary  line  for  the  total  number  of  messages  in  all
              mailboxes.

              Default: <b>yes</b>.

       status [ yes | no ]
              Whether  the  status  indicator  should  preceed every line describing the number of messages in a
              mailbox and the total.

              Default: <b>yes</b>.

       old [ yes | no ]
              Whether the status indicator should display the number of old (read) messages in the mailbox.

              Default: <b>yes</b>.

       new [ yes | no ]
              Whether the status indicator should display the number of new (unread) messages in the mailbox.

              Default: <b>yes</b>.

       delimiter characters
              The <b>characters</b> are used to separate the number of new messages from the number of old messages  in
              the display.

              Default: <b>"/"</b>.

       x pixels
              Start the status indicator at <b>pixels</b> offset horizontally from the top left corner.

              Default: <b>0</b>.

       y pixels
              Start the status indicator at <b>pixels</b> offset vertically from the top left corner.

              Default: <b>52</b>.

       font font-specification
              Use the <b>font-specification</b> for the status indicator.

              Default: <b>-*-*-medium-r-normal--10-*-*-*-*-*-*-*</b>.

       color name
              Use the specified color for the status indicator. The color may be a single word or multiple words
              surrounded by quotes.

              Default: <b>black</b>.

</pre><h4><b>animate</b> <b>section</b></h4><pre>
       The  section  describes  the animation presented on the screen. Basically, you can supply a number of XPM
       files in this section and the tool will happily cycle through them. There are three states: <b>nomail</b>,  <b>old</b>,
       <b>new</b>.  For  each  state, you add as many XPM files as you like. If there is only one file, <b>asmail</b> will not
       really cycle through it, only display once, saving thus the system resources.

       refresh refresh-rate
              The supplied XPM files are cycled through every <b>refresh-rate</b> number of 1/100th of a second.

              Default: <b>10</b>.

       nomail xpm-file
              Add this <b>xpm-file</b> to the animation of display to represent the state of empty mailbox.

       old xpm-file
              Add this <b>xpm-file</b> to the animation of display to represent the state of  mailbox  with  only  read
              mail.

       new xpm-file
              Add  this <b>xpm-file</b> to the animation of display to represent the state of mailbox when there is new
              e-mail in it.

       frame xpm-file
              Use this <b>xpm-file</b> as the background image. The background image  may  use  transparency.  You  can
              specify more than one but only the first one will be used.

              You  can  specify  the  keyword <b>none</b> instead of the name of the file to be used for the frame. The
              result will be no frame at all around the applet window.
