       procmailex - procmail rcfile examples

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>$HOME/.procmailrc</b> <b>examples</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       For a description of the rcfile format see <b><a href="../man5/procmailrc.5.html">procmailrc</a></b>(5).

       The weighted scoring technique is described in detail in the <b><a href="../man5/procmailsc.5.html">procmailsc</a></b>(5) man page.

       This  man  page  shows several example recipes.  For examples of complete rcfiles you can check the NOTES
       section in <b><a href="../man1/procmail.1.html">procmail</a></b>(1), or look at the example rcfiles in /usr/share/doc/procmail/examples.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Sort out all mail coming from the scuba-dive  mailing  list  into  the  mailfolder  scubafile  (uses  the
       locallockfile scubafile.lock).

              :0:
              * ^TOscuba
              scubafile

       Forward all mail from peter about compilers to william (and keep a copy of it here in petcompil).

              :0
              * ^From.*peter
              * ^Subject:.*compilers
              {
                 :0 c
                 ! <a href="mailto:william@somewhere.edu">william@somewhere.edu</a>

                 :0
                 petcompil
              }

       An equivalent solution that accomplishes the same:

              :0 c
              * ^From.*peter
              * ^Subject:.*compilers
              ! <a href="mailto:william@somewhere.edu">william@somewhere.edu</a>

                 :0 A
                 petcompil

       An equivalent, but slightly slower solution that accomplishes the same:

              :0 c
              * ^From.*peter
              * ^Subject:.*compilers
              ! <a href="mailto:william@somewhere.edu">william@somewhere.edu</a>

              :0

       If you are fairly new to procmail and plan to experiment a little bit it often helps to have a <u>safety</u> <u>net</u>
       of  some  sort.   Inserting  the following two recipes above all other recipes will make sure that of all
       arriving mail always the last 32 messages will be preserved.  In order for it to work  as  intended,  you
       have to create a directory named `backup' in $MAILDIR prior to inserting these two recipes.

              :0 c
              backup

              :0 ic
              | cd backup &amp;&amp; rm -f dummy `ls -t msg.* | sed -e 1,32d`

       If  your  system doesn't generate or generates incorrect leading `From ' lines on every mail, you can fix
       this by calling up procmail with the -f- option.  To fix the same problem by different means,  you  could
       have  inserted  the following recipe above all other recipes in your rcfile.  They will filter the header
       of any mail through formail which will strip any  leading  `From  ',  and  automatically  regenerates  it
       subsequently.

              :0 fhw
              | formail -I "From " -a "From "

       Add  the  headers  of all messages that didn't come from the postmaster to your private header collection
       (for statistics or mail debugging); and use the  lockfile  `headc.lock'.   In  order  to  make  sure  the
       lockfile  is  not  removed  until  the  pipe  has finished, you have to specify option `w'; otherwise the
       lockfile would be removed as soon as the pipe has accepted the mail.

              :0 hwc:
              * !^FROM_MAILER
              | uncompress headc.Z; cat &gt;&gt;headc; compress headc

       Or, if you would use the more efficient gzip instead of compress:

              :0 hwc:
              * !^FROM_MAILER
              | gzip &gt;&gt;headc.gz

       Forward all mails shorter than 1000 bytes to my home address (no lockfile needed on this recipe).

              :0
              * &lt; 1000
              ! myname@home

       Split up incoming digests from the surfing mailing list into their individual messages,  and  store  them
       into surfing, using surfing.lock as the locallockfile.

              :0:
              * ^Subject:.*surfing.*Digest
              | formail +1 -ds &gt;&gt;surfing

       Store  everything  coming  from  the postmaster or mailer-daemon (like bounced mail) into the file postm,
       using postm.lock as the locallockfile.

              :0:
              * ^FROM_MAILER
              postm

       A simple autoreply recipe.  It makes sure that neither mail from any daemon (like bouncing mail  or  mail
       from  mailing-lists),  nor  autoreplies  coming from yourself will be autoreplied to.  If this precaution
       would not be taken, disaster could result (`ringing' mail).  In order for this recipe to autoreply to all
       the incoming mail, you should of course insert it before all other recipes in your rcfile.   However,  it
       is  advisable  to  put  it  <u>after</u>  any  recipes  that  process the mails from subscribed mailinglists; it
       generally is not a good idea to generate autoreplies  to  mailinglists  (yes,  the  !^FROM_DAEMON  regexp
       should already catch those, but if the mailinglist doesn't follow accepted conventions, this might <u>not</u> be
       <u>enough</u>).

              :0 h c
              * !^FROM_DAEMON
              * !^X-Loop: <a href="mailto:your@own.mail.address">your@own.mail.address</a>
              | (formail -r -I"Precedence: junk" \
                  -A"X-Loop: <a href="mailto:your@own.mail.address">your@own.mail.address</a>" ; \
                 echo "Mail received.") | $SENDMAIL -t

       A  more  complicated  autoreply  recipe  that  implements  the  functional  equivalent  of the well known
       <b><a href="../man1/vacation.1.html">vacation</a></b>(1) program.  This recipe is based on the same principles as  the  last  one  (prevent  `ringing'
       mail).   In  addition  to  that  however,  it maintains a vacation database by extracting the name of the
       sender and inserting it in the vacation.cache file if the  name  was  new  (the  vacation.cache  file  is
       maintained by formail which will make sure that it always contains the most recent names, the size of the
       file  is  limited  to  a maximum of approximately 8192 bytes).  If the name was new, an autoreply will be
       sent.

       As you can see, the following recipe has comments <b>between</b> the conditions.  This is allowed.  Do  <b>not</b>  put
       comments on the same line as a condition though.

              SHELL=<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>    # only needed for older versions of procmail

              :0 Whc: vacation.lock
               # Perform a quick check to see if the mail was addressed to us
              * $^To:.*\&lt;$\LOGNAME\&gt;
               # Don't reply to daemons and mailinglists
              * !^FROM_DAEMON
               # Mail loops are evil
              * !^X-Loop: <a href="mailto:your@own.mail.address">your@own.mail.address</a>
              | formail -rD 8192 vacation.cache

                :0 ehc         # if the name was not in the cache
                | (formail -rI"Precedence: junk" \
                     -A"X-Loop: <a href="mailto:your@own.mail.address">your@own.mail.address</a>" ; \
                   echo "I received your mail,"; \
                   echo "but I won't be back until Monday."; \
                   echo "-- "; cat $HOME/.signature \
                  ) | $SENDMAIL -oi -t

       Store  all  messages  concerning  TeX  in  separate, unique filenames, in a directory named texmail (this
       directory has to exist); there is no need to use lockfiles in this case, so we won't.

              :0
              * (^TO|^Subject:.*)TeX[^t]
              texmail

       The same as above, except now we store the mails in numbered files (MH mail folder).

              :0
              * (^TO|^Subject:.*)TeX[^t]
              texmail/.

       Or you could file the mail in several directory folders at the same  time.   The  following  recipe  will
       deliver the mail to two MH-folders and one directory folder.  It is actually only one file with two extra
       hardlinks.

              :0
              * (^TO|^Subject:.*)TeX[^t]
              texmail/. wordprocessing dtp/.

       Store  all the messages about meetings in a folder that is in a directory that changes every month.  E.g.
       if it were January 1994, the folder would have the name `94-01/meeting' and the  locallockfile  would  be
       `94-01/meeting.lock'.

              :0:
              * meeting
              `date +%y-%m`/meeting

       The same as above, but, if the `94-01' directory wouldn't have existed, it is created automatically:

              MONTHFOLDER=`date +%y-%m`

              :0 Wic
              * ? test ! -d $MONTHFOLDER
              | mkdir $MONTHFOLDER

              :0:
              * meeting
              ${MONTHFOLDER}/meeting

       The same as above, but now by slightly different means:

              MONTHFOLDER=`date +%y-%m`
              DUMMY=`test -d $MONTHFOLDER || mkdir $MONTHFOLDER`

              :0:
              * meeting
              ${MONTHFOLDER}/meeting

       If  you are subscribed to several mailinglists and people cross-post to some of them, you usually receive
       several duplicate mails (one from every list).  The following simple recipe eliminates  duplicate  mails.
       It  tells  formail  to  keep  an 8KB cache file in which it will store the Message-IDs of the most recent
       mails you received.  Since Message-IDs are guaranteed to be unique for every new mail, they  are  ideally
       suited  to  weed  out duplicate mails.  Simply put the following recipe at the top of your rcfile, and no
       duplicate mail will get past it.

              :0 Wh: msgid.lock
              | formail -D 8192 msgid.cache

       <b>Beware</b> if you have delivery problems in recipes below this one and procmail tries to  requeue  the  mail,
       then  on the next queue run, this mail will be considered a duplicate and will be thrown away.  For those
       not quite so confident in their own scripting capabilities, you can use the following recipe instead.  It
       puts duplicates in a separate folder instead of throwing them away.  It is  up  to  you  to  periodically
       empty the folder of course.

              :0 Whc: msgid.lock
              | formail -D 8192 msgid.cache

              :0 a:
              duplicates

       Procmail  can  deliver  to  MH folders directly, but, it does not update the unseen sequences the real MH
       manages.  If you want procmail to update those as well, use a recipe like the following which  will  file
       everything  that  contains the word spam in the body of the mail into an MH folder called spamfold.  Note
       the local lockfile, which is needed because MH programs do not lock  the  sequences  file.   Asynchronous
       invocations  of  MH  programs  that  change  the sequences file may therefore corrupt it or silently lose
       changes.  Unfortunately, the lockfile doesn't completely solve the problem as rcvstore could  be  invoked
       while `show' or `mark' or some other MH program is running.  This problem is expected to be fixed in some
       future  version  of  MH,  but  until  then,  you'll have to balance the risk of lost or corrupt sequences
       against the benefits of the unseen sequence.

              :0 :spamfold/$LOCKEXT
              * B ?? spam
              | rcvstore +spamfold

       When delivering to emacs folders (i.e., mailfolders managed by any emacs mail package, e.g., RMAIL or VM)
       directly, you should use emacs-compatible lockfiles.  The emacs mailers are a bit  braindamaged  in  that
       respect, they get very upset if someone delivers to mailfolders which they already have in their internal
       buffers.  The following recipe assumes that $HOME equals /home/john.

              MAILDIR=Mail

              :0:/usr/local/lib/emacs/lock/!home!john!Mail!mailbox
              * ^Subject:.*whatever
              mailbox

       Alternatively,  you  can have procmail deliver into its own set of mailboxes, which you then periodically
       empty and copy over to your emacs files using <b>movemail</b>.  Movemail uses mailbox.lock local  lockfiles  per
       mailbox.  This actually is the preferred mode of operation in conjunction with procmail.

       To  extract  certain  headers  from a mail and put them into environment variables you can use any of the
       following constructs:

              SUBJECT=`formail -xSubject:`    # regular field
              FROM=`formail -rt -xTo:`        # special case

              :0 h                            # alternate method
              KEYWORDS=| formail -xKeywords:

       If you are using temporary files in a procmailrc file, and want to make sure that they are  removed  just
       before procmail exits, you could use something along the lines of:

              TEMPORARY=$HOME/tmp/pmail.$$
              TRAP="<a href="file:/bin/rm">/bin/rm</a> -f $TEMPORARY"

       The  TRAP  keyword  can  also  be  used to change the exitcode of procmail.  I.e. if you want procmail to
       return an exitcode of `1' instead of its regular exitcodes, you could use:

              EXITCODE=""
              TRAP="exit 1;"   # The trailing semi-colon is important
                               # since exit is not a standalone program

       Or, if the exitcode does not need to depend on the programs run from the TRAP, you can use a mere:

              EXITCODE=1

       The following recipe prints every incoming mail that looks like a postscript file.

              :0 Bb
              * ^^%!
              | lpr

       The following recipe does the same, but is a bit more selective.  It only prints the postscript  file  if
       it  comes  from  the  print-server.   The first condition matches only if it is found in the header.  The
       second condition only matches at the start of the body.

              :0 b
              * ^From[ :].*print-server
              * B ?? ^^%!
              | lpr

       The same as above, but now by slightly different means:

              :0
              * ^From[ :].*print-server
              {
                :0 B b
                * ^^%!
                | lpr
              }

       Likewise:

              :0 HB b
              * ^^(.+$)*From[ :].*print-server
              * ^^(.+$)*^%!
              | lpr

       Suppose you have two accounts, you use both accounts regularly, but they  are  in  very  distinct  places
       (i.e.,  you  can  only  read mail that arrived at either one of the accounts).  You would like to forward
       mail arriving at account one to account two, and the other way around.  The first  thing  that  comes  to
       mind  is using .forward files at both sites; this won't work of course, since you will be creating a mail
       loop.  This mail loop can be avoided by inserting the following recipe in front of all other  recipes  in
       the  $HOME/.procmailrc files on both sites.  If you make sure that you add the same X-Loop: field at both
       sites, mail can now safely be forwarded to the other account from either of them.

              :0 c
              * !^X-Loop: <a href="mailto:yourname@your.main.mail.address">yourname@your.main.mail.address</a>
              | formail -A "X-Loop: <a href="mailto:yourname@your.main.mail.address">yourname@your.main.mail.address</a>" | \
                 $SENDMAIL -oi <a href="mailto:yourname@the.other.account">yourname@the.other.account</a>

       If someone sends you a mail with the word `retrieve' in the subject,  the  following  will  automatically
       send  back the contents of info_file to the sender.  Like in all recipes where we send mail, we watch out
       for mail loops.

              :0
              * !^From +YOUR_USERNAME
              * !^Subject:.*Re:
              * !^FROM_DAEMON
              * ^Subject:.*retrieve
              | (formail -r ; cat info_file) | $SENDMAIL -oi -t

       Now follows an example for a very simple fileserver accessible by mail.  For more demanding applications,
       I suggest you take a look at <b>SmartList</b> (available from the same place as the procmail distribution).   As
       listed,  this  fileserver sends back at most one file per request, it ignores the body of incoming mails,
       the Subject: line has to look like "Subject: send file the_file_you_want" (the blanks  are  significant),
       it  does  not  return  files that have names starting with a dot, nor does it allow files to be retrieved
       that are outside the fileserver directory tree (if you decide to munge this example, make sure you do not
       inadvertently loosen this last restriction).

              :0
              * ^Subject: send file [0-9a-z]
              * !^X-Loop: <a href="mailto:yourname@your.main.mail.address">yourname@your.main.mail.address</a>
              * !^Subject:.*Re:
              * !^FROM_DAEMON
              * !^Subject: send file .*[<a href="file:/.">/.</a>]\.
              {
                MAILDIR=$HOME/fileserver # chdir to the fileserver directory

                :0 fhw                   # reverse mailheader and extract name
                * ^Subject: send file \/[^ ]*
                | formail -rA "X-Loop: <a href="mailto:yourname@your.main.mail.address">yourname@your.main.mail.address</a>"

                FILE="$MATCH"            # the requested filename

                :0 ah
                | cat - ./$FILE 2&gt;&amp;1 | $SENDMAIL -oi -t
              }

       The following example preconverts all plain-text mail arriving in certain encoded  MIME  formats  into  a
       more compact 8-bit format which can be used and displayed more easily by most programs.  The <b><a href="../man1/mimencode.1.html">mimencode</a></b>(1)
       program is part of Nathaniel Borenstein's metamail package.

       The following one is rather exotic, but it only serves to demonstrate a feature.  Suppose you have a file
       in  your  HOME  directory  called  ".urgent", and the (one) person named in that file is the sender of an
       incoming mail, you'd like that mail to be stored in $MAILDIR/urgent instead  of  in  any  of  the  normal
       mailfolders  it  would  have  been  sorted in.  Then this is what you could do (beware, the filelength of
       $HOME/.urgent should be well below $LINEBUF, increase LINEBUF if necessary):

              URGMATCH=`cat $HOME/.urgent`

              :0:
              * $^From.*${URGMATCH}
              urgent

       An entirely different application for procmail would be to  conditionally  apply  filters  to  a  certain
       (outgoing)  text  or mail.  A typical example would be a filter through which you pipe all outgoing mail,
       in order to make sure that it will be MIME encoded only if it needs to be.  I.e. in this case  you  could
       start procmail in the middle of a pipe like:

              cat newtext | procmail ./mimeconvert | mail <a href="mailto:chris@where.ever">chris@where.ever</a>

       The <b>mimeconvert</b> rcfile could contain something like (the =0x80= and =0xff= should be substituted with the
       real 8-bit characters):

              DEFAULT=|     # pipe to stdout instead of
                            # delivering mail as usual
              :0 Bfbw
              * [=0x80=-=0xff=]
              | mimencode -q

                :0 Afhw
                | formail -I 'MIME-Version: 1.0' \
                   -I 'Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1' \
                   -I 'Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable'
