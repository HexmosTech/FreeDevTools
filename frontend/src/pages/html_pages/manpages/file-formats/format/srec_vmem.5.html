</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       srec_vmem - vmem file format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  format  is  the  Verilog  VMEM  format.   This  is  a  hex format suitable for loading into Verilog
       simulations using the $readmemh call.

       The text file to be read shall contain only the following:
       White space (spaces, new lines, tabs, and form‐feeds)
       Comments (both types of C++ comment are allowed)
       Hexadecimal numbers

       White space and/or comments shall be used to separate the numbers.

       In the following discussion, the term "address" refers to an index into the array that models the memory.

       As the file is read, each number encountered is assigned to a successive  word  element  of  the  memory.
       Addressing  is  controlled both by specifying start and/or finish addresses in the system task invocation
       and by specifying addresses in the data file.

       When addresses appear in the data file, the format is an "at" character (@)  followed  by  a  hexadecimal
       number as follows:
              @hh...h

       Both  uppercase  and lowercase digits are allowed in the number.  No white space is allowed between the @
       and the number.  As many address specifications as needed within the data file can  be  used.   When  the
       system  task  encounters  an  address  specification,  it  loads  subsequent data starting at that memory
       address.

   <b>Commentary</b>
       There is no checksum in this format, which can generate false positives when  guessing  file  formats  on
       input.

       There  is  no  indication  of  the  word  size in the file, since it is dependent on the word type of the
       Verilog memory it is being read into.  SRecord will guess the word size based on the number of digits  it
       sees in the numbers, but this is only a guess.

       SRecord  will  also  assume  that the numbers are to be loaded big‐endian; that is, most significant byte
       (first byte seen) into the lowest address covered by the word.

       You can use the <b>-byte‐swap</b> filter to change the byte order; it takes an optional width of bytes  to  swap
       within.

   <b>Size</b> <b>Multiplier</b>
       In  general,  binary data will expand in sized by approximately 2.9 times (32‐bit), 3.1 times (16‐bit) or
       3.6 times (8‐bit) when represented with this format.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Here is an example Verilog VMEM file.  It contains the data “Hello, World[rq] to  be  loaded  at  address
       0x1000.
              @00000400 48656C6C 6F2C2057 6F726C64 0AFFFFFF
