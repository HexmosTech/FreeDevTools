       tar — format of tape archive files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>tar</b> archive format collects any number of files, directories, and other file system objects (symbolic
       links,  device nodes, etc.) into a single stream of bytes.  The format was originally designed to be used
       with tape drives that operate with  fixed-size  blocks,  but  is  widely  used  as  a  general  packaging
       mechanism.

   <b>General</b> <b>Format</b>
       A <b>tar</b> archive consists of a series of 512-byte records.  Each file system object requires a header record
       which  stores basic metadata (pathname, owner, permissions, etc.) and zero or more records containing any
       file data.  The end of the archive is indicated by two records consisting entirely of zero bytes.

       For compatibility with tape drives that use fixed block sizes, programs that  read  or  write  tar  files
       always  read  or  write  a  fixed number of records with each I/O operation.  These “blocks” are always a
       multiple of the record size.  The maximum block size supported by early implementations was  10240  bytes
       or  20  records.   This  is still the default for most implementations although block sizes of 1MiB (2048
       records) or larger are commonly used with modern high-speed tape drives.  (Note: the  terms  “block”  and
       “record” here are not entirely standard; this document follows the convention established by John Gilmore
       in documenting <b>pdtar</b>.)

   <b>Old-Style</b> <b>Archive</b> <b>Format</b>
       The  original  tar  archive  format  has  been extended many times to include additional information that
       various implementors found necessary.  This section describes the variant implemented by the tar  command
       included in Version 7 AT&amp;T UNIX, which seems to be the earliest widely-used version of the tar program.

       The header record for an old-style <b>tar</b> archive consists of the following:

             struct header_old_tar {
                     char name[100];
                     char mode[8];
                     char uid[8];
                     char gid[8];
                     char size[12];
                     char mtime[12];
                     char checksum[8];
                     char linkflag[1];
                     char linkname[100];
                     char pad[255];
             };
       All unused bytes in the header record are filled with nulls.

       <u>name</u>    Pathname,  stored  as  a  null-terminated  string.  Early tar implementations only stored regular
               files (including hardlinks to those files).  One common early  convention  used  a  trailing  "/"
               character  to  indicate a directory name, allowing directory permissions and owner information to
               be archived and restored.

       <u>mode</u>    File mode, stored as an octal number in ASCII.

       <u>uid</u>, <u>gid</u>
               User id and group id of owner, as octal numbers in ASCII.

       <u>size</u>    Size of file, as octal number in ASCII.  For regular files only, this  indicates  the  amount  of
               data that follows the header.  In particular, this field was ignored by early tar implementations
               when  extracting  hardlinks.   Modern  writers  should  always  store  a zero length for hardlink
               entries.

       <u>mtime</u>   Modification time of file, as an octal number in ASCII.  This indicates  the  number  of  seconds
               since  the start of the epoch, 00:00:00 UTC January 1, 1970.  Note that negative values should be
               avoided here, as they are handled inconsistently.

       <u>checksum</u>
               Header checksum, stored as an octal number in ASCII.  To compute the checksum, set  the  checksum
               field  to  all  spaces,  then  sum all bytes in the header using unsigned arithmetic.  This field
               should be stored as six octal digits followed by a null and a space character.   Note  that  many
               early  implementations  of  tar  used  signed  arithmetic for the checksum field, which can cause
               interoperability problems when transferring archives  between  systems.   Modern  robust  readers
               compute the checksum both ways and accept the header if either computation matches.

       <u>linkflag</u>, <u>linkname</u>
               In  order  to preserve hardlinks and conserve tape, a file with multiple links is only written to
               the archive the first time it is encountered.  The next time it is encountered, the  <u>linkflag</u>  is
               set  to  an  ASCII ‘1’ and the <u>linkname</u> field holds the first name under which this file appears.
               (Note that regular files have a null value in the <u>linkflag</u> field.)

       Early tar implementations varied in how they terminated these fields.  The tar command in Version 7  AT&amp;T
       UNIX used the following conventions (this is also documented in early BSD manpages): the pathname must be
       null-terminated;  the  mode,  uid, and gid fields must end in a space and a null byte; the size and mtime
       fields must end in a space; the checksum is terminated by a null  and  a  space.   Early  implementations
       filled  the  numeric  fields with leading spaces.  This seems to have been common practice until the IEEE
       Std 1003.1-1988 (“POSIX.1”) standard was released.  For best portability, modern  implementations  should
       fill the numeric fields with leading zeros.

   <b>Pre-POSIX</b> <b>Archives</b>
       An  early  draft of IEEE Std 1003.1-1988 (“POSIX.1”) served as the basis for John Gilmore's <b>pdtar</b> program
       and many system implementations from the late 1980s and early 1990s.  These archives generally follow the
       POSIX ustar format described below with the following variations:
       <b>•</b>       The magic value consists of the five characters “ustar” followed by a space.  The  version  field
               contains a space character followed by a null.
       <b>•</b>       The  numeric fields are generally filled with leading spaces (not leading zeros as recommended in
               the final standard).
       <b>•</b>       The prefix field is often not used,  limiting  pathnames  to  the  100  characters  of  old-style
               archives.

   <b>POSIX</b> <b>ustar</b> <b>Archives</b>
       IEEE  Std  1003.1-1988 (“POSIX.1”) defined a standard tar file format to be read and written by compliant
       implementations of <u><a href="../man1/tar.1.html">tar</a></u>(1).  This format is often called the “ustar” format, after the magic value used in
       the header.  (The name is an acronym for “Unix Standard TAR”.)  It extends the historic format  with  new
       fields:

             struct header_posix_ustar {
                     char name[100];
                     char mode[8];
                     char uid[8];
                     char gid[8];
                     char size[12];
                     char mtime[12];
                     char checksum[8];
                     char typeflag[1];
                     char linkname[100];
                     char magic[6];
                     char version[2];
                     char uname[32];
                     char gname[32];
                     char devmajor[8];
                     char devminor[8];
                     char prefix[155];
                     char pad[12];
             };

       <u>typeflag</u>
               Type of entry.  POSIX extended the earlier <u>linkflag</u> field with several new type values:
               “0”     Regular file.  NUL should be treated as a synonym, for compatibility purposes.
               “1”     Hard link.
               “2”     Symbolic link.
               “3”     Character device node.
               “4”     Block device node.
               “5”     Directory.
               “6”     FIFO node.
               “7”     Reserved.
               Other   A  POSIX-compliant implementation must treat any unrecognized typeflag value as a regular
                       file.  In particular, writers should ensure that all entries have  a  valid  filename  so
                       that  they  can  be  restored by readers that do not support the corresponding extension.
                       Uppercase letters "A" through "Z" are reserved for custom extensions.  Note that  sockets
                       and whiteout entries are not archivable.
               It  is  worth  noting that the <u>size</u> field, in particular, has different meanings depending on the
               type.  For regular files, of course, it indicates the amount of data following the  header.   For
               directories,  it may be used to indicate the total size of all files in the directory, for use by
               operating systems that pre-allocate directory space.  For all other types, it should  be  set  to
               zero by writers and ignored by readers.

       <u>magic</u>   Contains the magic value “ustar” followed by a NUL byte to indicate that this is a POSIX standard
               archive.  Full compliance requires the uname and gname fields be properly set.

       <u>version</u>
               Version.  This should be “00” (two copies of the ASCII digit zero) for POSIX standard archives.

       <u>uname</u>, <u>gname</u>
               User  and  group  names, as null-terminated ASCII strings.  These should be used in preference to
               the uid/gid values when they are set and the corresponding names exist on the system.

       <u>devmajor</u>, <u>devminor</u>
               Major and minor numbers for character device or block device entry.

       <u>name</u>, <u>prefix</u>
               If the pathname is too long to fit in the 100 bytes provided by the standard format,  it  can  be
               split at any <u>/</u> character with the first portion going into the prefix field.  If the prefix field
               is  not  empty,  the  reader  will prepend the prefix value and a <u>/</u> character to the regular name
               field to obtain the full pathname.  The standard does not  require  a  trailing  <u>/</u>  character  on
               directory names, though most implementations still include this for compatibility reasons.

       Note that all unused bytes must be set to NUL.

       Field  termination  is  specified  slightly  differently  by POSIX than by previous implementations.  The
       <u>magic</u>, <u>uname</u>, and <u>gname</u> fields must have a trailing NUL.  The <u>pathname</u>, <u>linkname</u>, and <u>prefix</u> fields  must
       have  a  trailing  NUL  unless  they  fill  the  entire field.  (In particular, it is possible to store a
       256-character pathname if it happens to have a <u>/</u> as the 156th character.)  POSIX requires numeric  fields
       to be zero-padded in the front, and requires them to be terminated with either space or NUL characters.

       Currently, most tar implementations comply with the ustar format, occasionally extending it by adding new
       fields to the blank area at the end of the header record.

   <b>Numeric</b> <b>Extensions</b>
       There have been several attempts to extend the range of sizes or times supported by modifying how numbers
       are stored in the header.

       One  obvious  extension to increase the size of files is to eliminate the terminating characters from the
       various numeric fields.  For example, the standard only allows the size field to contain 11 octal digits,
       reserving the twelfth byte for a trailing NUL character.  Allowing 12 octal digits allows file  sizes  up
       to 64 GB.

       Another extension, utilized by GNU tar, star, and other newer <b>tar</b> implementations, permits binary numbers
       in  the  standard  numeric  fields.   This  is  flagged  by  setting the high bit of the first byte.  The
       remainder of the field is treated as a signed twos-complement value.  This permits 95-bit values for  the
       length  and  time  fields  and  63-bit  values for the uid, gid, and device numbers.  In particular, this
       provides a consistent way to handle negative time values.   GNU  tar  supports  this  extension  for  the
       length,  mtime,  ctime,  and  atime  fields.   Joerg  Schilling's star program and the libarchive library
       support this extension for all numeric fields.  Note that this extension  is  largely  obsoleted  by  the
       extended attribute record provided by the pax interchange format.

       Another early GNU extension allowed base-64 values rather than octal.  This extension was short-lived and
       is no longer supported by any implementation.

   <b>Pax</b> <b>Interchange</b> <b>Format</b>
       There  are many attributes that cannot be portably stored in a POSIX ustar archive.  IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
       (“POSIX.1”) defined a “pax interchange format” that uses two new types of entries to hold  text-formatted
       metadata  that  applies  to  following  entries.   Note  that a pax interchange format archive is a ustar
       archive in every respect.  The new data is stored in ustar-compatible archive entries that use the “x” or
       “g” typeflag.  In particular, older implementations that do  not  fully  support  these  extensions  will
       extract the metadata into regular files, where the metadata can be examined as necessary.

       An entry in a pax interchange format archive consists of one or two standard ustar entries, each with its
       own  header  and  data.  The first optional entry stores the extended attributes for the following entry.
       This optional first entry has an "x" typeflag and a size field that  indicates  the  total  size  of  the
       extended  attributes.   The  extended  attributes  themselves are stored as a series of text-format lines
       encoded in the portable UTF-8 encoding.  Each line consists of a decimal number, a space, a  key  string,
       an  equals  sign,  a value string, and a new line.  The decimal number indicates the length of the entire
       line, including the initial length field and the trailing newline.  An example of such a field is:
             <b>25</b> <b>ctime=1084839148.1212\n</b>
       Keys in all lowercase are standard keys.  Vendors can add their own keys by prefixing them  with  an  all
       uppercase  vendor  name  and  a period.  Note that, unlike the historic header, numeric values are stored
       using decimal, not octal.  A description of some common keys follows:

       <b>atime</b>, <b>ctime</b>, <b>mtime</b>
               File access, inode change, and modification times.  These fields can be  negative  or  include  a
               decimal point and a fractional value.

       <b>hdrcharset</b>
               The  character  set  used by the pax extension values.  By default, all textual values in the pax
               extended attributes are assumed to be in UTF-8, including pathnames, user names, and group names.
               In some cases, it is not possible to translate local conventions into  UTF-8.   If  this  key  is
               present  and  the  value  is the six-character ASCII string “BINARY”, then all textual values are
               assumed to be in a platform-dependent multi-byte encoding.  Note that there are  only  two  valid
               values for this key: “BINARY” or “ISO-IR 10646 2000 UTF-8”.  No other values are permitted by the
               standard, and the latter value should generally not be used as it is the default when this key is
               not  specified.   In  particular,  this  flag  should not be used as a general mechanism to allow
               filenames to be stored in arbitrary encodings.

       <b>uname</b>, <b>uid</b>, <b>gname</b>, <b>gid</b>
               User name, group name, and numeric UID and GID values.  The user name and group name stored  here
               are  encoded in UTF8 and can thus include non-ASCII characters.  The UID and GID fields can be of
               arbitrary length.

       <b>linkpath</b>
               The full path of the linked-to file.  Note that this is encoded in UTF8 and can thus include non-
               ASCII characters.

       <b>path</b>    The full pathname of the entry.  Note that this is encoded in UTF8 and can thus include non-ASCII
               characters.

       <b>realtime.*</b>, <b>security.*</b>
               These keys are reserved and may be used for future standardization.

       <b>size</b>    The size of the file.  Note that there is no length limit  on  this  field,  allowing  conforming
               archives to store files much larger than the historic 8GB limit.

       <b>SCHILY.*</b>
               Vendor-specific attributes used by Joerg Schilling's <b>star</b> implementation.

       <b>SCHILY.acl.access</b>, <b>SCHILY.acl.default</b>, <b>SCHILY.acl.ace</b>
               Stores  the access, default and NFSv4 ACLs as textual strings in a format that is an extension of
               the  format  specified  by  POSIX.1e  draft  17.   In  particular,  each  user  or  group  access
               specification  can include an additional colon-separated field with the numeric UID or GID.  This
               allows ACLs to be restored on systems that may  not  have  complete  user  or  group  information
               available (such as when NIS/YP or LDAP services are temporarily unavailable).

       <b>SCHILY.devminor</b>, <b>SCHILY.devmajor</b>
               The full minor and major numbers for device nodes.

       <b>SCHILY.fflags</b>
               The file flags.

       <b>SCHILY.realsize</b>
               The full size of the file on disk.  XXX explain? XXX

       <b>SCHILY.dev</b>, <b>SCHILY.ino</b>, <b>SCHILY.nlinks</b>
               The  device  number,  inode number, and link count for the entry.  In particular, note that a pax
               interchange format archive using Joerg Schilling's <b>SCHILY.*</b> extensions can store all of the  data
               from <u>struct</u> <u>stat</u>.

       <b>LIBARCHIVE.*</b>
               Vendor-specific attributes used by the <b>libarchive</b> library and programs that use it.

       <b>LIBARCHIVE.creationtime</b>
               The  time  when  the  file  was  created.   (This  should  not be confused with the POSIX “ctime”
               attribute, which refers to the time when the file metadata was last changed.)

       <b>LIBARCHIVE.xattr</b>.<u>namespace</u>.<u>key</u>
               Libarchive stores POSIX.1e-style extended attributes using keys of this form.  The <u>key</u>  value  is
               URL-encoded:  All  non-ASCII characters and the two special characters “=” and “%” are encoded as
               “%” followed by two uppercase hexadecimal  digits.   The  value  of  this  key  is  the  extended
               attribute value encoded in base 64.  XXX Detail the base-64 format here XXX

       <b>VENDOR.*</b>
               XXX document other vendor-specific extensions XXX

       Any  values  stored in an extended attribute override the corresponding values in the regular tar header.
       Note that compliant readers should  ignore  the  regular  fields  when  they  are  overridden.   This  is
       important, as existing archivers are known to store non-compliant values in the standard header fields in
       this  situation.   There  are no limits on length for any of these fields.  In particular, numeric fields
       can be arbitrarily large.  All text fields are encoded in UTF8.   Compliant  writers  should  store  only
       portable  7-bit ASCII characters in the standard ustar header and use extended attributes whenever a text
       value contains non-ASCII characters.

       In addition to the <b>x</b> entry described above, the pax interchange format also supports a <b>g</b>  entry.   The  <b>g</b>
       entry  is identical in format, but specifies attributes that serve as defaults for all subsequent archive
       entries.  The <b>g</b> entry is not widely used.

       Besides the new <b>x</b> and <b>g</b> entries, the pax interchange format has a few other  minor  variations  from  the
       earlier  ustar  format.   The  most  troubling one is that hardlinks are permitted to have data following
       them.  This allows readers to restore any hardlink to a file without having to rewind the archive to find
       an earlier entry.  However, it creates complications for robust readers, as it is no longer clear whether
       or not they should ignore the size field for hardlink entries.

   <b>GNU</b> <b>Tar</b> <b>Archives</b>
       The GNU tar program started with a pre-POSIX format similar to that described earlier and has extended it
       using several different mechanisms: It added new fields to the empty space in the header (some  of  which
       was  later  used  by POSIX for conflicting purposes); it allowed the header to be continued over multiple
       records; and it defined new entries that modify following entries (similar in principle to  the  <b>x</b>  entry
       described above, but each GNU special entry is single-purpose, unlike the general-purpose <b>x</b> entry).  As a
       result,  GNU  tar  archives  are  not POSIX compatible, although more lenient POSIX-compliant readers can
       successfully extract most GNU tar archives.

       <u>typeflag</u>
               GNU tar uses the following special entry types, in addition to those defined by POSIX:

               7       GNU tar treats type "7" records identically to type "0" records, except  on  one  obscure
                       RTOS where they are used to indicate the pre-allocation of a contiguous file on disk.

               D       This  indicates a directory entry.  Unlike the POSIX-standard "5" typeflag, the header is
                       followed by data records listing the names of files in  this  directory.   Each  name  is
                       preceded  by an ASCII "Y" if the file is stored in this archive or "N" if the file is not
                       stored in this archive.  Each name is terminated with a null, and an extra null marks the
                       end of the name list.  The purpose of this entry is to  support  incremental  backups;  a
                       program  restoring  from  such  an  archive may wish to delete files on disk that did not
                       exist in the directory when the archive was made.

                       Note that the "D" typeflag specifically violates POSIX, which requires that  unrecognized
                       typeflags  be  restored as normal files.  In this case, restoring the "D" entry as a file
                       could interfere with subsequent creation of the like-named directory.

               K       The data for this entry is a long linkname for the following regular entry.

               L       The data for this entry is a long pathname for the following regular entry.

               M       This is a continuation of the  last  file  on  the  previous  volume.   GNU  multi-volume
                       archives  guarantee that each volume begins with a valid entry header.  To ensure this, a
                       file may be split, with part stored at the end of one volume,  and  part  stored  at  the
                       beginning  of  the  next volume.  The "M" typeflag indicates that this entry continues an
                       existing file.  Such entries can only occur as the first or second entry  in  an  archive
                       (the  latter  only  if  the first entry is a volume label).  The <u>size</u> field specifies the
                       size of this entry.  The <u>offset</u> field at bytes 369-380 specifies the  offset  where  this
                       file  fragment  begins.   The  <u>realsize</u> field specifies the total size of the file (which
                       must equal <u>size</u> plus <u>offset</u>).  When extracting, GNU tar checks that the header file  name
                       is  the  one it is expecting, that the header offset is in the correct sequence, and that
                       the sum of offset and size is equal to realsize.

               N       Type "N" records are no longer generated by GNU tar.  They contained a list of  files  to
                       be renamed or symlinked after extraction; this was originally used to support long names.
                       The  contents  of this record are a text description of the operations to be done, in the
                       form “Rename %s to %s\n” or “Symlink %s to %s\n”; in  either  case,  both  filenames  are
                       escaped  using  K&amp;R  C  syntax.   Due to security concerns, "N" records are now generally
                       ignored when reading archives.

               S       This is a “sparse” regular file.  Sparse files are stored as a series of fragments.   The
                       header  contains  a list of fragment offset/length pairs.  If more than four such entries
                       are required, the header is extended as necessary  with  “extra”  header  extensions  (an
                       older format that is no longer used), or “sparse” extensions.

               V       The  <u>name</u>  field  should  be interpreted as a tape/volume header name.  This entry should
                       generally be ignored on extraction.

       <u>magic</u>   The magic field holds the five characters “ustar” followed by a space.   Note  that  POSIX  ustar
               archives have a trailing null.

       <u>version</u>
               The version field holds a space character followed by a null.  Note that POSIX ustar archives use
               two copies of the ASCII digit “0”.

       <u>atime</u>, <u>ctime</u>
               The  time  the  file was last accessed and the time of last change of file information, stored in
               octal as with <u>mtime</u>.

       <u>longnames</u>
               This field is apparently no longer used.

       Sparse <u>offset</u> <u>/</u> <u>numbytes</u>
               Each such structure specifies a single fragment of a sparse file.  The two fields store values as
               octal numbers.  The fragments are each padded to a multiple of 512  bytes  in  the  archive.   On
               extraction, the list of fragments is collected from the header (including any extension headers),
               and the data is then read and written to the file at appropriate offsets.

       <u>isextended</u>
               If  this  is  set to non-zero, the header will be followed by additional “sparse header” records.
               Each such record contains information about as many as 21 additional sparse blocks as shown here:

                     struct gnu_sparse_header {
                             struct {
                                     char offset[12];
                                     char numbytes[12];
                             } sparse[21];
                             char    isextended[1];
                             char    padding[7];
                     };

       <u>realsize</u>
               A binary representation of the file's complete size, with a much larger range than the POSIX file
               size.  In particular, with <b>M</b> type files, the current entry is only a portion  of  the  file.   In
               that  case,  the  POSIX  size field will indicate the size of this entry; the <u>realsize</u> field will
               indicate the total size of the file.

   <b>GNU</b> <b>tar</b> <b>pax</b> <b>archives</b>
       GNU tar 1.14 (XXX check this XXX) and later will write pax interchange format archives when  you  specify
       the  <b>--posix</b>  flag.   This  format follows the pax interchange format closely, using some <b>SCHILY</b> tags and
       introducing new keywords to store sparse file information.  There  have  been  three  iterations  of  the
       sparse file support, referred to as “0.0”, “0.1”, and “1.0”.

       <b>GNU.sparse.numblocks</b>, <b>GNU.sparse.offset</b>, <b>GNU.sparse.numbytes</b>, <b>GNU.sparse.size</b>
               The  “0.0” format used an initial <b>GNU.sparse.numblocks</b> attribute to indicate the number of blocks
               in the file, a pair of <b>GNU.sparse.offset</b> and <b>GNU.sparse.numbytes</b> to indicate the offset and  size
               of  each  block, and a single <b>GNU.sparse.size</b> to indicate the full size of the file.  This is not
               the same as the size in the tar header because the latter value does not include the size of  any
               holes.   This  format  required  that  the order of attributes be preserved and relied on readers
               accepting multiple appearances of the same attribute names, which is not officially permitted  by
               the standards.

       <b>GNU.sparse.map</b>
               The  “0.1”  format used a single attribute that stored a comma-separated list of decimal numbers.
               Each pair of numbers indicated the offset and size, respectively, of a block of data.  This  does
               not  work well if the archive is extracted by an archiver that does not recognize this extension,
               since many pax implementations simply discard unrecognized attributes.

       <b>GNU.sparse.major</b>, <b>GNU.sparse.minor</b>, <b>GNU.sparse.name</b>, <b>GNU.sparse.realsize</b>
               The “1.0” format stores the sparse block map in one or more 512-byte blocks prepended to the file
               data in the entry body.  The  pax  attributes  indicate  the  existence  of  this  map  (via  the
               <b>GNU.sparse.major</b> and <b>GNU.sparse.minor</b> fields) and the full size of the file.  The <b>GNU.sparse.name</b>
               holds  the  true name of the file.  To avoid confusion, the name stored in the regular tar header
               is a modified name so that extraction errors will be apparent to users.

   <b>Solaris</b> <b>Tar</b>
       XXX More Details Needed XXX

       Solaris tar (beginning with SunOS XXX 5.7 ?? XXX) supports an “extended”  format  that  is  fundamentally
       similar to pax interchange format, with the following differences:
       <b>•</b>       Extended  attributes  are  stored  in an entry whose type is <b>X</b>, not <b>x</b>, as used by pax interchange
               format.  The detailed format of this entry appears to be the same as detailed  above  for  the  <b>x</b>
               entry.
       <b>•</b>       An additional <b>A</b> header is used to store an ACL for the following regular entry.  The body of this
               entry  contains  a  seven-digit octal number followed by a zero byte, followed by the textual ACL
               description.  The octal value is the number of ACL entries plus a constant that indicates the ACL
               type: 01000000 for POSIX.1e ACLs and 03000000 for NFSv4 ACLs.

   <b>AIX</b> <b>Tar</b>
       XXX More details needed XXX

       AIX Tar uses a ustar-formatted header with the type <b>A</b> for storing  coded  ACL  information.   Unlike  the
       Solaris format, AIX tar writes this header after the regular file body to which it applies.  The pathname
       in  this  header  is either <b>NFS4</b> or <b>AIXC</b> to indicate the type of ACL stored.  The actual ACL is stored in
       platform-specific binary format.

   <b>Mac</b> <b>OS</b> <b>X</b> <b>Tar</b>
       The tar distributed with Apple's Mac OS X stores most regular files as two  separate  files  in  the  tar
       archive.   The two files have the same name except that the first one has “._” prepended to the last path
       element.  This special file stores an AppleDouble-encoded binary blob with additional metadata about  the
       second  file,  including ACL, extended attributes, and resources.  To recreate the original file on disk,
       each separate file can be extracted and the Mac OS X <b>copyfile</b>()  function  can  be  used  to  unpack  the
       separate  metadata file and apply it to th regular file.  Conversely, the same function provides a “pack”
       option to encode the extended metadata from a file into a separate file whose contents can  then  be  put
       into a tar archive.

       Note  that  the  Apple extended attributes interact badly with long filenames.  Since each file is stored
       with the full name, a separate set of extensions needs to be  included  in  the  archive  for  each  one,
       doubling the overhead required for files with long names.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARDS</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>tar</b> utility is no longer a part of POSIX or the Single Unix Standard.  It last appeared in Version 2
       of the Single UNIX Specification (“SUSv2”).  It has been supplanted in subsequent  standards  by  <u><a href="../man1/pax.1.html">pax</a></u>(1).
       The ustar format is currently part of the specification for the <u><a href="../man1/pax.1.html">pax</a></u>(1) utility.  The pax interchange file
       format is new with IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (“POSIX.1”).

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       A  <b>tar</b> command appeared in Seventh Edition Unix, which was released in January, 1979.  It replaced the <b>tp</b>
       program from Fourth Edition Unix which in turn replaced the <b>tap</b> program from First  Edition  Unix.   John
       Gilmore's  <b>pdtar</b> public-domain implementation (circa 1987) was highly influential and formed the basis of
       <b>GNU</b> <b>tar</b> (circa 1988).  Joerg Shilling's <b>star</b> archiver is another open-source (CDDL) archiver  (originally
       developed circa 1985) which features complete support for pax interchange format.
