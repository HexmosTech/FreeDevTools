</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
        .sop - Sopwith mission format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Sopwith  mission format allows <b><a href="../man6/sopwith.6.html">sopwith</a></b>(6) to load custom user-defined levels and other modifications
       to the game. The files use Yocton as their basic format.

       Each .sop file can contain three different sections:

       <b>level</b>  This section contains level data. If present, the game's level is replaced with  an  entirely  new
              level defined within this section. See <b>LEVEL</b> <b>SECTION</b> below.

       <b>symbols</b>
              This  section  allows  the  game's  symbols  (sprites)  to  be  replaced.  This  allows  graphical
              modifications to the game. See <b>SYMBOLS</b> <b>SECTION</b> below.

       <b>sounds</b> This section allows the game's music to be replaced. See <b>SOUNDS</b> <b>SECTION</b> below.

</pre><h4><b>LEVEL</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>level</b> section allows a complete new level to be defined. At  present  only  a  single  level  can  be
       defined,  although  this  may change in the future.  Each level contains two types of subsection: <b>ground</b>,
       which defines the level's terrain, and multiple <b>object</b> sections, each of which defines an in-game object.

       The <b>ground</b> subsection is a list of decimal integer values that describe the level's terrain.  Each  value
       is defined through a Yocton property named <b>_</b>. Values should be in the range 16-199, and there should be a
       minimum of 320 (ie. one screen's worth). The following is an example:

         ground {
           _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64 _: 64
           ...
         }

       Each <b>object</b> subsection defines an object that appears in the level.  The following is an example:

         object {
           type: PLANE
           x: 30
           orient: 0
           territory_l: 0
           territory_r: 0
           faction: PLAYER1
         }

       As seen, each object has a number of different properties:

       <b>type</b>   See <b>OBJECT</b> <b>TYPES</b> below.

       <b>x</b>      The  X coordinate within the level where the object appears. The Y coordinate is set automatically
              depending on the object type and can not be specified.

       <b>orient</b> For planes, defines the direction in which planes  face:  0  (right)  or  1  (left).   For  ground
              targets, this controls the type of ground target; see <b>TARGET</b> <b>TYPES</b> below.

       <b>faction</b>
              Specifies the faction to which the object belongs. See <b>FACTIONS</b> below.

       <b>transform</b>
              For  ground  targets,  this  specifies a "transformation" to apply to the symbol.  Eight different
              transformations are supported: 0 (no transformation); 1 (rotate 90  degrees  counterclockwise);  2
              (rotate upside-down); 3 (rotate 90 degrees clockwise); 4 (flip vertically); 5 (mirror, then rotate
              90 degrees counterclockwise); 6 (mirror); 7 (mirror and then rotate 90 degrees clockwise).  If you
              want  to  see  an Ox do a headstand, this is the property to use, although it's more likely you'll
              want to use it to make tanks face the right direction.

       <b>territory_l</b>
              For planes, the left boundary of the range of the level the plane defends.

       <b>territory_r</b>
              For planes, the right boundary of the range of the level the plane defends.

       The following is an example of a minimal <b>level</b> section that just contains a flat ground with  no  objects
       other than the player's plane:

         level {
           object {
             type: PLANE
             x: 30
             orient: 0
             territory_l: 0
             territory_r: 0
             faction: PLAYER1
           }
           ground {

           }
         }

</pre><h4><b>OBJECT</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       The following object types can appear in a level:

       <b>PLANE</b>  Defines  either a player or computer-controlled plane. The <b>faction</b> property controls whether it is
              a human player or computer-controlled player; see <b>FACTIONS</b> below.  Computer-controlled planes will
              defend their "territory", the range of  which  is  defined  by  the  <b>territory_l</b>  and  <b>territory_r</b>
              properties. If the player enters this territory, they will take off from their base and attack.

       <b>TARGET</b> A  ground  target.  The  value of the <b>orient</b> property defines the type of target, see <b>TARGET</b> <b>TYPES</b>
              below. The value of the <b>faction</b> property specifies the faction to which the target  belongs.  When
              one player destroys all targets owned by all enemy factions, the game advances to the next level.

       <b>BALLOON</b>
              Observation  balloon.  The value of the <b>orient</b> property defines the type of balloon; 0 = spherical
              balloon, 1 = Caquot-style. The value of the <b>faction</b> property specifies the faction  to  which  the
              balloon belongs.

       <b>OX</b>     An  Ox  (type  of  cattle). The Ox does nothing except act as an obstacle, and does not need to be
              killed to advance to the next level. Does not appear in novice mode.

       <b>BIRD</b>   A single bird that flies randomly around the  level.  The  bird  acts  as  an  obstacle  that  the
              player(s) must avoid. Does not appear in novice mode.

       <b>FLOCK</b>  A  flock  of  birds moves along the top of the screen. The flock acts an obstacle and may disperse
              into many different birds if disturbed. Does not appear in novice mode.

</pre><h4><b>FACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Military objects belong to a "faction"; objects allied to a different faction are considered enemies. The
       color of the object indicates the faction:

       <b>PLAYER1</b>
              For planes, cyan fuselage and magenta wings. This corresponds to the human player in single player
              mode, and player 1 in multiplayer mode.

       <b>PLAYER2</b>
              For planes, magenta fuselage and cyan wings. This corresponds to the computer opponent  in  single
              player mode, and player 2 in multiplayer mode.

       <b>NONE</b>   Used for animals / non-military targets.

       The following values are also recognized; they are currently (effectively) unused, but may be used in the
       future if the multiplayer feature is extended to support more than two players.

       <b>PLAYER3</b>
              Maps  to <b>PLAYER2</b> in single player mode, or <b>PLAYER1</b> in multiplayer mode. Planes of this faction are
              currently ignored in multiplayer mode.

       <b>PLAYER4</b>
              Maps to <b>PLAYER2</b>. Planes of this faction are currently ignored in multiplayer mode.

       <b>PLAYER5</b>, <b>PLAYER7</b>
              Maps to <b>PLAYER1</b>, but planes with this faction are currently ignored.

       <b>PLAYER6</b>, <b>PLAYER8</b>
              Maps to <b>PLAYER2</b>, but planes with this faction are currently ignored.

</pre><h4><b>SYMBOLS</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>symbols</b> section allows the game's graphics to be replaced.  The  section  can  contain  a  number  of
       subsections, one for each type of graphic.  Graphics are defined as multiline text strings. The following
       is an example of a <b>symbols</b> section that changes the hangar graphic to add an extra (white) flag:

         symbols {
           swtrgsym {
             0:
             "    -                 -         \n" &amp;
             "    - # # # #         - * * * * \n" &amp;
             "    - # # # #         - * * * * \n" &amp;
             "    -                 -         \n" &amp;
             "    -                 -         \n" &amp;
             "    -                 -         \n" &amp;
             "    -                 -         \n" &amp;
             "* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \n" &amp;
             "* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \n" &amp;
             "* * - - - - - - - - - - - - * * \n" &amp;
             "* * - * * * * * * * * * * - * * \n" &amp;
             "* * - * * * * * * * * * * - * * \n" &amp;
             "* * - * * * * * * * * * * - * * \n" &amp;
             "* * - * * * * * * * * * * - * * \n" &amp;
             "* * - * * * * * * * * * * - * * \n" &amp;
             "* * - * * * * * * * * * * - * * \n"
           }
         }

       Graphics  are  limited  to the original four CGA colors: black (space); cyan (asterisk); magenta (hyphen)
       and white (number sign / pound / octothorpe).  Cyan and magenta are  swapped  for  enemy  planes  (single
       player) and player 2 (multiplayer).

       The following graphics are defined:

       <b>swplnsym</b> (16x16)
              Plane.  There are four frames, for facing right (0), rotated 22.5 degrees counterclockwise (1), 45
              degrees (2) and 67.5 degrees (3).

       <b>swhitsym</b> (16x16)
              Crashing plane. There are two frames of animation.

       <b>swwinsym</b> (16x16)
              Plane flying into the distance after completing the level. There are four frames of animation.

       <b>swtrgsym</b> (16x16)
              Ground target. Each frame is a different target type and the values are those  from  <b>TARGET</b>  <b>TYPES</b>
              below.

       <b>swhtrsym</b> (16x16)
              Destroyed  ground  target.  Each  frame  a different target type; the values are those from <b>TARGET</b>
              <b>TYPES</b> below. The number of pixels in the symbol control the size of the explosion when the  target
              is destroyed.

       <b>swballoonsym</b> (16x16)
              Observation balloon. Each type of balloon has three animation frames: drifting left, centered, and
              drifting right. Spherical balloon starts at frame 0 and Caquot-style balloon begins at frame 3.

       <b>swoxsym</b> (16x16)
              Ox. There is one frame.

       <b>swflksym</b> (16x16)
              Bird flock. There are two frames, for the "flapping wings" animation.

       <b>swbrdsym</b> (4x2)
              Bird. There are two frames, for the "flapping wings" animation.

       <b>swbmbsym</b> (8x8)
              Falling  bomb.  There are two frames, for facing right (0) and rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise
              (1).

       <b>swmscsym</b> (8x8)
              Missile. There are four frames, for facing right (0), rotated 22.5 degrees  counterclockwise  (1),
              45 degrees (2) and 67.5 degrees (3).

       <b>swbstsym</b> (8x8)
              Starburst (flare). There are two frames of animation.

       <b>swexpsym</b> (8x8)
              Debris after an explosion. There are eight frames for different types of debris.

       <b>swmedalsym</b> (8x12)
              Medals. There are three frames for each different type.

       <b>swribbonsym</b> (8x2)
              Ribbons. There are six frames for each different type.

       <b>swshtsym</b> (16x16)

</pre><h4><b>TARGET</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>
       0      Hangar

       1      Factory

       2      Fuel tank

       3      Tank

       5      Tanker truck

       6      Flag

       7      Tent

       8-12   User-defined  target;  the  <b>symbols</b>  section  should  be  used to supply the graphics (see <b>SYMBOLS</b>
              <b>SECTION</b> above). Type 12 produces a big explosion like an oil tank when destroyed.

       13-17  "Passive" user-defined target (does not fire at enemy planes). Type 17 produces  a  big  explosion
              like an oil tank when destroyed.

       18     Radio tower

       19     Water tower

</pre><h4><b>SOUNDS</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sounds</b> section allows the in-game music to be replaced. There is only one property at present, named
       <b>title_tune</b>; its value is a string containing a sequence of notes to play. The following is an example  of
       a <b>sounds</b> section that replaces the title music with the beginning of "Au Clair de la Lune":

         sounds {
           title_tune:
           "g4/r8/g4/r8/g4/r8/a4/r8/b2/r4/a2/r2/" &amp;
           "g4/r8/b4/r8/a4/r8/a4/r8/g2/r2/"
         }

       As  seen,  the  format consists of a number of musical notes (a-g) separated by '/' characters. The notes
       are in the C major scale. Each note is followed by a number that indicates the length of the  note  as  a
       fraction  of  a  whole  note;  for  example,  2 means half-note, 4 means quarter-note, etc. The following
       additional syntax is also supported:

       •      For a rest, use "r" instead of a note character. The syntax is otherwise identical to that  for  a
              normal note, with the only difference being that no note will be played.

       •      To  play  a  sharp,  append  a  '+' character. For example, "g+4/" represents a quarter-length G#.
              Alternatively you can append a '-' to play a flat; for example "e-2/" is a half-length E-flat (aka
              D#).

       •      Prefix a note with &lt; or &gt; to shift down or up an octave. All subsequent notes will  be  played  in
              this octave.

       •      Append  a  '.'  character  to play a dotted note. A dotted note plays for 50% longer than a normal
              note.

       The original DOS version of Sopwith interpreted notes as being in the A minor scale, but this is believed
       to have been a mistake and notes are now assumed to be in the more  common  C  major  scale.  This  does,
       however,  mean  that  tunes  from  DOS .exe hacks will play differently; any A or B notes will need to be
       shifted down one octave to convert to the C major scale.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       The original DOS version of Sopwith only supported a single level, although later versions increased  the
       difficulty  by repeatedly playing the same level again at increasing speeds. Some modifications were made
       by fans by hex-editing the DOS .exe file.

       Some simple hacks just changed the name shown on the title screen (one changed it  to  "Red  Baron",  for
       example). Some more elaborate mods that changed the level itself included "Blokwit" and "Sokwith". Andrew
       Jenner  even  developed  a  basic  level  editor that allowed people to make their own maps, although the
       changes that can be made using this technique are inherently limited.

       Full support for custom maps did not appear until 2024, with  SDL  Sopwith's  v2.4  release.  There  will
       likely  be further future extensions to this format to allow people to share more elaborate modifications
       to the game.
