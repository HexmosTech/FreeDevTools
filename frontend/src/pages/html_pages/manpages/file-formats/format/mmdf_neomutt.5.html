</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       MMDF - Multi-channel Memorandum Distribution Facility mailbox format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  document  describes  the <b>MMDF</b> mailbox format used by some MTAs and MUAs (i.e.  <b><a href="../man1/scomail.1.html">scomail</a></b>(1)) to store
       mail messages locally.

       An <b>MMDF</b> mailbox is a text file containing an arbitrary number of e-mail messages.  Each message  consists
       of  a  postmark,  followed  by  an  e-mail message formatted according to <b>RFC822</b> / <b>RFC2822</b>, followed by a
       postmark.  The file format is line-oriented.  Lines are separated by line feed characters (ASCII 10).   A
       postmark line consists of the four characters "^A^A^A^A" (Control-A; ASCII 1).

       Example of a <b>MMDF</b> mailbox holding two mails:

              ^A^A^A^A
              From: <a href="mailto:example@example.com">example@example.com</a>
              To: <a href="mailto:example@example.org">example@example.org</a>
              Subject: test

              &gt;From what I learned about the MMDF-format:
              ^A^A^A^A
              ^A^A^A^A
              From: <a href="mailto:example@example.com">example@example.com</a>
              To: <a href="mailto:example@example.org">example@example.org</a>
              Subject: test 2

              bar
              ^A^A^A^A

       In  contrast  to  most  other single file mailbox formats like MBOXO and MBOXRD (see <b><a href="../man5/mbox.5.html">mbox</a></b>(5)) there is no
       need to quote/dequote "From " lines in <b>MMDF</b> mailboxes as such lines  have  no  special  meaning  in  this
       format.

       If  the modification-time (usually determined via <b><a href="../man2/stat.2.html">stat</a></b>(2)) of a nonempty mailbox file is greater than the
       access-time, the file has new mail.  Many MUAs place a Status: header in each message to  indicate  which
       messages have already been read.

</pre><h4><b>LOCKING</b></h4><pre>
       Since  <b>MMDF</b>  files  are frequently accessed by multiple programs in parallel, <b>MMDF</b> files should generally
       not be accessed without locking.

       Three different locking mechanisms (and combinations thereof) are in general use:

       •      <b><a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</a></b>(2) locking is mostly used on recent, POSIX-compliant systems.  Use of  this  locking  method
              is,  in  particular,  advisable  if <b>MMDF</b> files are accessed through the Network File System (NFS),
              since it seems the only way to reliably invalidate NFS clients' caches.

       •      <b><a href="../man2/flock.2.html">flock</a></b>(2) locking is mostly used on BSD-based systems.

       If multiple methods are combined, implementers should make sure to use the non-blocking variants  of  the
       <b><a href="../man2/fcntl.2.html">fcntl</a></b>(2) and <b><a href="../man2/flock.2.html">flock</a></b>(2) system calls in order to avoid deadlocks.

       If  multiple  methods  are combined, an <b>MMDF</b> file must not be considered to have been successfully locked
       before all individual locks were obtained.   When  one  of  the  individual  locking  methods  fails,  an
       application  should  release all locks it acquired successfully, and restart the entire locking procedure
       from the beginning, after a suitable delay.

       The locking mechanism used on a particular system is a matter of local policy, and should be consistently
       used by all applications installed on the system which access <b>MMDF</b> files.  Failure to do so may result in
       loss of e-mail data, and in corrupted <b>MMDF</b> files.

</pre><h4><b>CONFORMING</b> <b>TO</b></h4><pre>
       <b>MMDF</b> is not part of any currently supported standard.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       <b>MMDF</b> was developed at the University of Delaware by Dave Crocker.
