</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       xdm.options - configuration options for the X display manager

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/X11/xdm/xdm.options</u>  contains  a  set  of flags that determine some of the behavior of the X display
       manager <b><a href="../man1x/xdm.1x.html">xdm</a></b>(1x).  Most of <b>xdm</b>'s behavior is customized through other files; consult the <b>xdm</b>  manual  page
       if this manual page does not describe the behavior you want to alter.

       <u>/etc/X11/xdm/xdm.options</u>  may  contain  comments,  which begin with a hash mark (‘#’) and end at the next
       newline, just like comments in shell scripts.  The rest  of  the  file  consists  of  options  which  are
       expressed  as  words  separated by hyphens, with only one option per line.  Options are enabled by simply
       placing them in the file; they are disabled by prefixing the option name with ‘no-’.

       Available options are:

       <b>ignore-nologin</b>
              Normally, if the <b><a href="../man5/nologin.5.html">nologin</a></b>(5) file exists, its contents will be  displayed  using  <b><a href="../man1x/xmessage.1x.html">xmessage</a></b>(1x)  (if
              xmessage  is  available),  and the user will be returned to the <b>xdm</b> login screen after xmessage is
              dismissed instead of starting the X session.  If this option is enabled, <b>xdm</b> starts a  session  as
              usual  (after  <b>xmessage</b> is dismissed, if <b>xmessage</b> is available and the <u>nologin</u> file exists).  This
              behavior is disabled by default: <u>nologin</u> is heeded, not ignored.

       <b>restart-on-upgrade</b>
              <b>Enable</b> <b>this</b> <b>option</b> <b>with</b> <b>caution</b> <b>on</b> <b>‘production’</b> <b>machines;</b> it causes the daemon to be  stopped  and
              restarted  on  upgrade,  even if the process has children (which means it is managing X sessions).
              Typically when a package that contains a daemon is being installed  or  upgraded,  its  maintainer
              scripts  stop  a running daemon process before installing the new binary, and restart it after the
              new binary is installed.  Stopping <b>xdm</b> causes immediate termination of any sessions it manages; in
              some situations this could be an unwelcome surprise (for instance, for remote <b>xdm</b> users who had no
              idea the administrator was performing system maintenance).  On the other hand, for  machines  that
              stay  up  for  long  periods  of time, leaving the old daemon running can be a bad idea if the new
              version has, for instance, a fix for a security vulnerability (overwriting <b>xdm</b>'s executable on the
              file system has no effect on the copy of <b>xdm</b> in memory).  The  <b>xdm</b>  package's  pre-removal  script
              checks  to  see  if  the  <b>xdm</b>  process has any children; if it does, it is possible that someone's
              session would be killed by stopping <b>xdm</b>, so a warning is issued and an opportunity  to  abort  the
              upgrade  of  <b>xdm</b> is provided.  Furthermore, restarting <b>xdm</b> on upgrade can be surprising, because a
              locally-managed X server can change the active VT even while  other  packages  are  continuing  to
              upgrade.   If,  by  intent or accident, the X server does not honor the key sequence to switch VTs
              back to a virtual console, this can be undesirable.  This behavior is  disabled  by  default:  <b>xdm</b>
              will be not be stopped or started during an upgrade of its package; the administrator will have to
              do so by hand (with <b>invoke-rc.d</b> <b>xdm</b> <b>restart</b> or by rebooting the system) before the newly installed
              <b>xdm</b> binary is used.

       <b>start-on-install</b>
              <b>Enable</b>  <b>this</b>  <b>option</b>  <b>with</b>  <b>caution;</b>  it causes the <b>xdm</b> daemon to be started immediately after the
              package is installed.   See  the  above  entry  regarding  <b>restart-on-upgrade</b>  for  other  caveats
              regarding the consequences of starting the <b>xdm</b> daemon during package management.  This behavior is
              disabled  by  default:  <b>xdm</b>  will  not be started when it is installed.  Changing this setting can
              affect future installs if the package is removed,  but  not  purged  (which  removes  ‘conffiles’,
              including <u>xdm.options</u>).

       <b>use-sessreg</b>
              This  option  causes  the <u>/etc/X11/xdm/Xreset</u> script to call the <b><a href="../man1x/sessreg.1x.html">sessreg</a></b>(1x) program to register X
              sessions managed by <b>xdm</b> in the <b><a href="../man5/utmp.5.html">utmp</a></b>(5) and <b><a href="../man5/wtmp.5.html">wtmp</a></b>(5) files.  If it is disabled, the  <u>utmp</u>  and  <u>wtmp</u>
              files  will  have no record of <b>xdm</b> sessions.  This behavior is enabled by default; sessreg will be
              used.

       Users of older versions of the Debian system should note that the ‘run-xconsole’ option has been removed.
       The shell script named <u>/etc/X11/xdm/Xreset</u> can be edited to disable or modify the running of xconsole  on
       the <b>xdm</b> greeter screen; see <b><a href="../man1x/xdm.1x.html">xdm</a></b>(1x) for more information.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORS</b></h4><pre>
       Stephen  Early,  Mark Eichin, and Branden Robinson customized <b>xdm</b>'s startup and reset scripts and package
       maintainer scripts to implement the functionality described above.   This  manual  page  was  written  by
       Branden Robinson.
