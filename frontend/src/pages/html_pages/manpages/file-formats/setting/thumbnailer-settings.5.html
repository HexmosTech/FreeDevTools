</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       thumbnailer-settings - Configuration settings for <b><a href="../man1/thumbnailer-service.1.html">thumbnailer-service</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>thumbnailer-service</b> program uses <b><a href="../man7/dconf.7.html">dconf</a></b>(7) for its configuration.  Configuration values are read once
       only, on start-up of the service.

       The following settings are used:

       <b>dash-ubuntu-com-key</b> (string)
              The API key for the remote artwork service.

       <b>full-size-cache-size</b> (int)
              The size (in megabytes) of the image cache that stores original artwork.  The default is 50 MB.

       <b>thumbnail-size-cache-size</b> (int)
              The size (in megabytes) of the thumbnail cache that stores scaled thumbnails.  The default is  100
              MB.

       <b>thumbnail-size-cache-size</b> (int)
              The  size  (in  megabytes) of the failure cache that stores media keys for media without an image.
              The default is 2 MB.

       <b>max-thumbnail-size</b> (int)
              Requests  for  thumbnails  larger  than  this  will  automatically   reduce   the   thumbnail   to
              <b>max-thumbnail-size</b> (in pixels) in the larger dimension. Requests for thumbnails with size zero are
              interpreted as requests for <b>max-thumbnail-size</b>.  The default is 1920 pixels.

       <b>retry-not-found-hours</b> (int)
              If artwork cannot be retrieved because the remote server authoritatively confirmed that no artwork
              exists  for  an  artist or album, this parameter defines how long (in hours) the thumbnailer waits
              before trying to download the same image again.  The default is 168 hours (one week).

       <b>retry-error-hours</b> (int)
              If artwork cannot be retrieved from the remote server due to an  unexpected  error  (such  as  the
              server  not  responding),  the  thumbnailer  does not attempt to contact the server again for some
              period, using exponential backoff if the failure persists. This parameter defines the maximum wait
              time (in hours) before trying to contact the server  again.   The  default  is  two  hours.   (The
              initial wait time is 2 * <b>max-extraction-timeout</b>.)

       <b>max-downloads</b> (int)
              Controls the maximum number of concurrent downloads for remote artwork.  The default value is 8.

       <b>max-extractions</b> (int)
              Controls  the  maximum number of concurrent image extractions from local video files.  The default
              value is zero, which sets the value according to the number of CPU cores.

       <b>max-extraction-timeout</b> (int)
              Sets the amount of time (in seconds) to wait for a remote image download or a thumbnail extraction
              before giving up.  The default is 10 seconds.

       <b>max-backlog</b> (int)
              Controls the number of DBus requests that will be sent before queueing  the  requests  internally.
              The default is 10.

       <b>trace-client</b> (bool)
              If  true,  thumbnail  and  cancel  requests  are  logged.  Log messages are written to the calling
              application's log via <b>qdebug</b>().  The default value is false.

       <b>log-level</b> (int)
              At the default setting (1), cache misses are logged, but no messages are written for  cache  hits.
              At  setting  2, cache hits are logged as well. At setting 0, most messages that are part of normal
              operation are suppressed. Errors  and  other  unusual  operating  conditions  are  always  logged,
              regardless   of   the   logging  level.   The  default  value  is  1.   The  environment  variable
              <b>THUMBNAILER_LOG_LEVEL</b> overrides this setting.
