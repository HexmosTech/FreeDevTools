</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>package.json</b>

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       This document is all you need to know about what's required in your
       package.json file.  It must be actual JSON, not just a JavaScript object
       literal.

       A lot of the behavior described in this document is affected by the config
       settings described in <b>config</b>.

</pre><h4><b>name</b></h4><pre>
       If you plan to publish your package, the <u>most</u> important things in your
       package.json are the name and version fields as they will be required. The
       name and version together form an identifier that is assumed to be
       completely unique.  Changes to the package should come along with changes
       to the version. If you don't plan to publish your package, the name and
       version fields are optional.

       The name is what your thing is called.

       Some rules:

        • The name must be less than or equal to 214 characters. This includes the
          scope for scoped packages.

        • The names of scoped packages can begin with a dot or an underscore. This
          is not permitted without a scope.

        • New packages must not have uppercase letters in the name.

        • The name ends up being part of a URL, an argument on the command line,
          and a folder name. Therefore, the name can't contain any non-URL-safe
          characters.

       Some tips:

        • Don't use the same name as a core Node module.

        • Don't put "js" or "node" in the name.  It's assumed that it's js, since
          you're writing a package.json file, and you can specify the engine using
          the "engines" field.  (See below.)

        • The name will probably be passed as an argument to require(), so it
          should be something short, but also reasonably descriptive.

        • You may want to check the npm registry to see if there's something by
          that name already, before you get too attached to it.
          https://www.npmjs.com/

       A name can be optionally prefixed by a scope, e.g. <b>@myorg/mypackage</b>. See
       <b>scope</b> for more detail.

</pre><h4><b>version</b></h4><pre>
       If you plan to publish your package, the <u>most</u> important things in your
       package.json are the name and version fields as they will be required. The
       name and version together form an identifier that is assumed to be
       completely unique.  Changes to the package should come along with changes
       to the version. If you don't plan to publish your package, the name and
       version fields are optional.

       Version must be parseable by
       node-semver, which is bundled with
       npm as a dependency.  (<b>npm</b> <b>install</b> <b>semver</b> to use it yourself.)

</pre><h4><b>description</b></h4><pre>
       Put a description in it.  It's a string.  This helps people discover your
       package, as it's listed in <b>npm</b> <b>search</b>.

</pre><h4><b>keywords</b></h4><pre>
       Put keywords in it.  It's an array of strings.  This helps people discover
       your package as it's listed in <b>npm</b> <b>search</b>.

</pre><h4><b>homepage</b></h4><pre>
       The url to the project homepage.

       Example:
         "homepage": "https://github.com/owner/project#readme"

</pre><h4><b>bugs</b></h4><pre>
       The url to your project's issue tracker and / or the email address to which
       issues should be reported. These are helpful for people who encounter
       issues with your package.

       It should look like this:
         {
           "url" : "https://github.com/owner/project/issues",
           "email" : "<a href="mailto:project@hostname.com">project@hostname.com</a>"
         }

       You can specify either one or both values. If you want to provide only a
       url, you can specify the value for "bugs" as a simple string instead of an
       object.

       If a url is provided, it will be used by the <b>npm</b> <b>bugs</b> command.

</pre><h4><b>license</b></h4><pre>
       You should specify a license for your package so that people know how they
       are permitted to use it, and any restrictions you're placing on it.

       If you're using a common license such as BSD-2-Clause or MIT, add a current
       SPDX license identifier for the license you're using, like this:
         {
           "license" : "BSD-3-Clause"
         }

       You can check the full list of SPDX license
       IDs.  Ideally you should pick one that is
       OSI approved.

       If your package is licensed under multiple common licenses, use an SPDX
       license expression syntax version 2.0
       string, like this:
         {
           "license" : "(ISC OR GPL-3.0)"
         }

       If you are using a license that hasn't been assigned an SPDX identifier, or if
       you are using a custom license, use a string value like this one:
         {
           "license" : "SEE LICENSE IN &lt;filename&gt;"
         }

       Then include a file named <b>&lt;filename&gt;</b> at the top level of the package.

       Some old packages used license objects or a "licenses" property containing
       an array of license objects:
         // Not valid metadata
         {
           "license" : {
             "type" : "ISC",
             "url" : "https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC"
           }
         }

         // Not valid metadata
         {
           "licenses" : [
             {
               "type": "MIT",
               "url": "https://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php"
             },
             {
               "type": "Apache-2.0",
               "url": "https://opensource.org/licenses/apache2.0.php"
             }
           ]
         }

       Those styles are now deprecated. Instead, use SPDX expressions, like this:
         {
           "license": "ISC"
         }
         {
           "license": "(MIT OR Apache-2.0)"
         }

       Finally, if you do not wish to grant others the right to use a private or
       unpublished package under any terms:
         {
           "license": "UNLICENSED"
         }

       Consider also setting <b>&amp;quot;private&amp;quot;:</b> <b>true</b> to prevent accidental publication.

</pre><h4><b>people</b> <b>fields:</b> <b>author,</b> <b>contributors</b></h4><pre>
       The "author" is one person.  "contributors" is an array of people.  A
       "person" is an object with a "name" field and optionally "url" and "email",
       like this:
         {
           "name" : "Barney Rubble",
           "email" : "<a href="mailto:b@rubble.com">b@rubble.com</a>",
           "url" : "<a href="http://barnyrubble.tumblr.com/">http://barnyrubble.tumblr.com/</a>"
         }

       Or you can shorten that all into a single string, and npm will parse it for
       you:
         {
           "author": "Barney Rubble &lt;<a href="mailto:b@rubble.com">b@rubble.com</a>&gt; (<a href="http://barnyrubble.tumblr.com/">http://barnyrubble.tumblr.com/</a>)"
         }

       Both email and url are optional either way.

       npm also sets a top-level "maintainers" field with your npm user info.

</pre><h4><b>funding</b></h4><pre>
       You can specify an object containing a URL that provides up-to-date
       information about ways to help fund development of your package, or a
       string URL, or an array of these:
         {
           "funding": {
             "type" : "individual",
             "url" : "<a href="http://example.com/donate">http://example.com/donate</a>"
           },

           "funding": {
             "type" : "patreon",
             "url" : "https://www.patreon.com/my-account"
           },

           "funding": "<a href="http://example.com/donate">http://example.com/donate</a>",

           "funding": [
             {
               "type" : "individual",
               "url" : "<a href="http://example.com/donate">http://example.com/donate</a>"
             },
             "<a href="http://example.com/donateAlso">http://example.com/donateAlso</a>",
             {
               "type" : "patreon",
               "url" : "https://www.patreon.com/my-account"
             }
           ]
         }

       Users can use the <b>npm</b> <b>fund</b> subcommand to list the <b>funding</b> URLs of all
       dependencies of their project, direct and indirect. A shortcut to visit
       each funding url is also available when providing the project name such as:
       <b>npm</b> <b>fund</b> <b>&lt;projectname&gt;</b> (when there are multiple URLs, the first one will
       be visited)

</pre><h4><b>files</b></h4><pre>
       The optional <b>files</b> field is an array of file patterns that describes the
       entries to be included when your package is installed as a dependency. File
       patterns follow a similar syntax to <b>.gitignore</b>, but reversed: including a
       file, directory, or glob pattern (<b>*</b>, <b>**/*</b>, and such) will make it so
       that file is included in the tarball when it's packed. Omitting the field
       will make it default to <b>[&amp;quot;*&amp;quot;]</b>, which means it will include all files.

       Some special files and directories are also included or excluded regardless
       of whether they exist in the <b>files</b> array (see below).

       You can also provide a <b>.npmignore</b> file in the root of your package or in
       subdirectories, which will keep files from being included. At the root of
       your package it will not override the "files" field, but in subdirectories
       it will. The <b>.npmignore</b> file works just like a <b>.gitignore</b>. If there is
       a <b>.gitignore</b> file, and <b>.npmignore</b> is missing, <b>.gitignore</b>'s contents
       will be used instead.

       Files included with the "package.json#files" field <u>cannot</u> be excluded
       through <b>.npmignore</b> or <b>.gitignore</b>.

       Certain files are always included, regardless of settings:

        • <b>package.json</b>

        • <b>README</b>

        • <b>LICENSE</b> / <b>LICENCE</b>

        • The file in the "main" field

       <b>README</b> &amp; <b>LICENSE</b> can have any case and extension.

       Conversely, some files are always ignored:

        • <b>.git</b>

        • <b>CVS</b>

        • <b>.svn</b>

        • <b>.hg</b>

        • <b>.lock-wscript</b>

        • <b>.wafpickle-N</b>

        • <b>.*.swp</b>

        • <b>.DS_Store</b>

        • <b>._*</b>

        • <b>npm-debug.log</b>

        • <b>.npmrc</b>

        • <b>node_modules</b>

        • <b>config.gypi</b>

        • <b>*.orig</b>

        • <b>package-lock.json</b> (use
          <b>npm-shrinkwrap.json</b> if you wish
          it to be published)

</pre><h4><b>main</b></h4><pre>
       The main field is a module ID that is the primary entry point to your
       program.  That is, if your package is named <b>foo</b>, and a user installs it,
       and then does <b>require(&amp;quot;foo&amp;quot;)</b>, then your main module's exports object will
       be returned.

       This should be a module relative to the root of your package folder.

       For most modules, it makes the most sense to have a main script and often
       not much else.

       If <b>main</b> is not set it defaults to <b>index.js</b> in the package's root folder.

</pre><h4><b>browser</b></h4><pre>
       If your module is meant to be used client-side the browser field should be
       used instead of the main field. This is helpful to hint users that it might
       rely on primitives that aren't available in Node.js modules. (e.g.
       <b>window</b>)

</pre><h4><b>bin</b></h4><pre>
       A lot of packages have one or more executable files that they'd like to
       install into the PATH. npm makes this pretty easy (in fact, it uses this
       feature to install the "npm" executable.)

       To use this, supply a <b>bin</b> field in your package.json which is a map of
       command name to local file name. When this package is installed globally,
       that file will be either linked inside the global bins directory or
       a cmd (Windows Command File) will be created which executes the specified
       file in the <b>bin</b> field, so it is available to run by <b>name</b> or <b>name.cmd</b> (on
       Windows PowerShell). When this package is installed as a dependency in another
       package, the file will be linked where it will be available to that package
       either directly by <b>npm</b> <b>exec</b> or by name in other scripts when invoking them
       via <b>npm</b> <b>run-script</b>.

       For example, myapp could have this:
         {
           "bin": {
             "myapp": "./cli.js"
           }
         }

       So, when you install myapp, in case of unix-like OS it'll create a symlink
       from the <b>cli.js</b> script to <b>/usr/local/bin/myapp</b> and in case of windows it
       will create a cmd file usually at <b>C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Roaming\npm\myapp.cmd</b>
       which runs the <b>cli.js</b> script.

       If you have a single executable, and its name should be the name of the
       package, then you can just supply it as a string.  For example:
         {
           "name": "my-program",
           "version": "1.2.5",
           "bin": "./path/to/program"
         }

       would be the same as this:
         {
           "name": "my-program",
           "version": "1.2.5",
           "bin": {
             "my-program": "./path/to/program"
           }
         }

       Please make sure that your file(s) referenced in <b>bin</b> starts with
       <b>#!<a href="file:///usr/lib/w3m/cgi-bin/w3mman2html.cgi?env">/usr/bin/env</a></b> <b>node</b>, otherwise the scripts are started without the node
       executable!

       Note that you can also set the executable files using <u>directories.bin</u>

       See folders for more info on
       executables.

</pre><h4><b>man</b></h4><pre>
       Specify either a single file or an array of filenames to put in place for
       the <b>man</b> program to find.

       If only a single file is provided, then it's installed such that it is the
       result from <b>man</b> <b>&lt;pkgname&gt;</b>, regardless of its actual filename.  For
       example:
         {
           "name": "foo",
           "version": "1.2.3",
           "description": "A packaged foo fooer for fooing foos",
           "main": "foo.js",
           "man": "./man/doc.1"
         }

       would link the <b>./man/doc.1</b> file in such that it is the target for <b>man</b> <b>foo</b>

       If the filename doesn't start with the package name, then it's prefixed.
       So, this:
         {
           "name": "foo",
           "version": "1.2.3",
           "description": "A packaged foo fooer for fooing foos",
           "main": "foo.js",
           "man": [
             "./man/foo.1",
             "./man/bar.1"
           ]
         }

       will create files to do <b>man</b> <b>foo</b> and <b>man</b> <b>foo-bar</b>.

       Man files must end with a number, and optionally a <b>.gz</b> suffix if they are
       compressed.  The number dictates which man section the file is installed
       into.
         {
           "name": "foo",
           "version": "1.2.3",
           "description": "A packaged foo fooer for fooing foos",
           "main": "foo.js",
           "man": [
             "./man/foo.1",
             "./man/foo.2"
           ]
         }

       will create entries for <b>man</b> <b>foo</b> and <b>man</b> <b>2</b> <b>foo</b>

</pre><h4><b>directories</b></h4><pre>
       The CommonJS Packages spec
       details a few ways that you can indicate the structure of your package
       using a <b>directories</b> object. If you look at npm's
       package.json, you'll see that it
       has directories for doc, lib, and man.

       In the future, this information may be used in other creative ways.

   <b>directories.bin</b>
       If you specify a <b>bin</b> directory in <b>directories.bin</b>, all the files in
       that folder will be added.

       Because of the way the <b>bin</b> directive works, specifying both a <b>bin</b> path
       and setting <b>directories.bin</b> is an error. If you want to specify
       individual files, use <b>bin</b>, and for all the files in an existing <b>bin</b>
       directory, use <b>directories.bin</b>.

   <b>directories.man</b>
       A folder that is full of man pages.  Sugar to generate a "man" array by
       walking the folder.

</pre><h4><b>repository</b></h4><pre>
       Specify the place where your code lives. This is helpful for people who
       want to contribute.  If the git repo is on GitHub, then the <b>npm</b> <b>docs</b>
       command will be able to find you.

       Do it like this:
         {
           "repository": {
             "type": "git",
             "url": "https://github.com/npm/cli.git"
           }
         }

       The URL should be a publicly available (perhaps read-only) url that can be
       handed directly to a VCS program without any modification.  It should not
       be a url to an html project page that you put in your browser.  It's for
       computers.

       For GitHub, GitHub gist, Bitbucket, or GitLab repositories you can use the
       same shortcut syntax you use for <b>npm</b> <b>install</b>:
         {
           "repository": "npm/npm",

           "repository": "github:user/repo",

           "repository": "gist:11081aaa281",

           "repository": "bitbucket:user/repo",

           "repository": "gitlab:user/repo"
         }

       If the <b>package.json</b> for your package is not in the root directory (for
       example if it is part of a monorepo), you can specify the directory in
       which it lives:
         {
           "repository": {
             "type": "git",
             "url": "https://github.com/facebook/react.git",
             "directory": "packages/react-dom"
           }
         }

</pre><h4><b>scripts</b></h4><pre>
       The "scripts" property is a dictionary containing script commands that are
       run at various times in the lifecycle of your package.  The key is the
       lifecycle event, and the value is the command to run at that point.

       See <b>scripts</b> to find out more about writing package
       scripts.

</pre><h4><b>config</b></h4><pre>
       A "config" object can be used to set configuration parameters used in
       package scripts that persist across upgrades.  For instance, if a package
       had the following:
         {
           "name": "foo",
           "config": {
             "port": "8080"
           }
         }

       It could also have a "start" command that referenced the
       <b>npm_package_config_port</b> environment variable.

</pre><h4><b>dependencies</b></h4><pre>
       Dependencies are specified in a simple object that maps a package name to a
       version range. The version range is a string which has one or more
       space-separated descriptors.  Dependencies can also be identified with a
       tarball or git URL.

       <b>Please</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>put</b> <b>test</b> <b>harnesses</b> <b>or</b> <b>transpilers</b> <b>or</b> <b>other</b> <b>"development"</b>
       <b>time</b> <b>tools</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>dependencies</b> <b>object.</b>  See <b>devDependencies</b>, below.

       See semver for more details about specifying version ranges.

        • <b>version</b> Must match <b>version</b> exactly

        • <b>&gt;version</b> Must be greater than <b>version</b>

        • <b>&gt;=version</b> etc

        • <b>&lt;version</b>

        • <b>&lt;=version</b>

        • <b>~version</b> "Approximately equivalent to version"  See
          semver

        • <b>^version</b> "Compatible with version"  See semver

        • <b>1.2.x</b> 1.2.0, 1.2.1, etc., but not 1.3.0

        • <b>http://...</b> See 'URLs as Dependencies' below

        • <b>*</b> Matches any version

        • <b>&amp;quot;&amp;quot;</b> (just an empty string) Same as <b>*</b>

        • <b>version1</b> <b>-</b> <b>version2</b> Same as <b>&gt;=version1</b> <b>&lt;=version2</b>.

        • <b>range1</b> <b>||</b> <b>range2</b> Passes if either range1 or range2 are satisfied.

        • <b>git...</b> See 'Git URLs as Dependencies' below

        • <b>user/repo</b> See 'GitHub URLs' below

        • <b>tag</b> A specific version tagged and published as <b>tag</b>  See <b>npm</b> <b>dist-tag</b>

        • <b>path/path/path</b> See <u>Local</u> <u>Paths</u> below

       For example, these are all valid:
         {
           "dependencies": {
             "foo": "1.0.0 - 2.9999.9999",
             "bar": "&gt;=1.0.2 &lt;2.1.2",
             "baz": "&gt;1.0.2 &lt;=2.3.4",
             "boo": "2.0.1",
             "qux": "&lt;1.0.0 || &gt;=2.3.1 &lt;2.4.5 || &gt;=2.5.2 &lt;3.0.0",
             "asd": "<a href="http://asdf.com/asdf.tar.gz">http://asdf.com/asdf.tar.gz</a>",
             "til": "~1.2",
             "elf": "~1.2.3",
             "two": "2.x",
             "thr": "3.3.x",
             "lat": "latest",
             "dyl": "file:../dyl"
           }
         }

   <b>URLs</b> <b>as</b> <b>Dependencies</b>
       You may specify a tarball URL in place of a version range.

       This tarball will be downloaded and installed locally to your package at
       install time.

   <b>Git</b> <b>URLs</b> <b>as</b> <b>Dependencies</b>
       Git urls are of the form:
         &lt;protocol&gt;://[&lt;user&gt;[:&lt;password&gt;]@]&lt;hostname&gt;[:&lt;port&gt;][:][/]&lt;path&gt;[#&lt;commit-ish&gt; | #semver:&lt;semver&gt;]

       <b>&lt;protocol&gt;</b> is one of <b>git</b>, <b>git+ssh</b>, <b>git+http</b>, <b>git+https</b>, or
       <b>git+file</b>.

       If <b>#&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b> is provided, it will be used to clone exactly that
       commit. If the commit-ish has the format <b>#semver:&lt;semver&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;semver&gt;</b> can
       be any valid semver range or exact version, and npm will look for any tags
       or refs matching that range in the remote repository, much as it would for
       a registry dependency. If neither <b>#&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b> or <b>#semver:&lt;semver&gt;</b> is
       specified, then the default branch is used.

       Examples:
         git+ssh://<a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:npm/cli.git#v1.0.27
         git+ssh://<a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:npm/cli#semver:^5.0
         git+https://<a href="mailto:isaacs@github.com">isaacs@github.com</a>/npm/cli.git
         git://github.com/npm/cli.git#v1.0.27

       When installing from a <b>git</b> repository, the presence of certain fields in the
       <b>package.json</b> will cause npm to believe it needs to perform a build. To do so
       your repository will be cloned into a temporary directory, all of its deps
       installed, relevant scripts run, and the resulting directory packed and
       installed.

       This flow will occur if your git dependency uses <b>workspaces</b>, or if any of the
       following scripts are present:

        • <b>build</b>

        • <b>prepare</b>

        • <b>prepack</b>

        • <b>preinstall</b>

        • <b>install</b>

        • <b>postinstall</b>

       If your git repository includes pre-built artifacts, you will likely want to
       make sure that none of the above scripts are defined, or your dependency
       will be rebuilt for every installation.

   <b>GitHub</b> <b>URLs</b>
       As of version 1.1.65, you can refer to GitHub urls as just "foo":
       "user/foo-project".  Just as with git URLs, a <b>commit-ish</b> suffix can be
       included.  For example:
         {
           "name": "foo",
           "version": "0.0.0",
           "dependencies": {
             "express": "expressjs/express",
             "mocha": "mochajs/mocha#4727d357ea",
             "module": "user/repo#feature\/branch"
           }
         }

   <b>Local</b> <b>Paths</b>
       As of version 2.0.0 you can provide a path to a local directory that
       contains  a  package.  Local  paths can be saved using <b>npm</b> <b>install</b> <b>-S</b> or <b>npm</b> <b>install</b> <b>--save</b>, using any of
       these forms:
         ../foo/bar
         <a href="file:~/foo/bar">~/foo/bar</a>
         ./foo/bar
         /foo/bar

       in which case they will be normalized to a relative path and added to your
       <b>package.json</b>. For example:
         {
           "name": "baz",
           "dependencies": {
             "bar": "file:../foo/bar"
           }
         }

       This feature is helpful for local offline development and creating tests
       that require npm installing where you don't want to hit an external server,
       but should not be used when publishing packages to the public registry.

       <u>note</u>: Packages linked by local path will not have their own
       dependencies installed when <b>npm</b> <b>install</b> is ran in this case.  You must
       run <b>npm</b> <b>install</b> from inside the local path itself.

</pre><h4><b>devDependencies</b></h4><pre>
       If someone is planning on downloading and using your module in their
       program, then they probably don't want or need to download and build the
       external test or documentation framework that you use.

       In this case, it's best to map these additional items in a
       <b>devDependencies</b> object.

       These things will be installed when doing <b>npm</b> <b>link</b> or <b>npm</b> <b>install</b> from
       the root of a package, and can be managed like any other npm configuration
       param.  See <b>config</b> for more on the topic.

       For build steps that are not platform-specific, such as compiling
       CoffeeScript or other languages to JavaScript, use the <b>prepare</b> script to
       do this, and make the required package a devDependency.

       For example:
         {
           "name": "ethopia-waza",
           "description": "a delightfully fruity coffee varietal",
           "version": "1.2.3",
           "devDependencies": {
             "coffee-script": "~1.6.3"
           },
           "scripts": {
             "prepare": "coffee -o lib/ -c src/waza.coffee"
           },
           "main": "lib/waza.js"
         }

       The <b>prepare</b> script will be run before publishing, so that users can
       consume the functionality without requiring them to compile it themselves.
       In dev mode (ie, locally running <b>npm</b> <b>install</b>), it'll run this script as
       well, so that you can test it easily.

</pre><h4><b>peerDependencies</b></h4><pre>
       In some cases, you want to express the compatibility of your package with a
       host tool or library, while not necessarily doing a <b>require</b> of this host.
       This is usually referred to as a <u>plugin</u>. Notably, your module may be
       exposing a specific interface, expected and specified by the host
       documentation.

       For example:
         {
           "name": "tea-latte",
           "version": "1.3.5",
           "peerDependencies": {
             "tea": "2.x"
           }
         }

       This ensures your package <b>tea-latte</b> can be installed <u>along</u> with the
       second major version of the host package <b>tea</b>  only.  <b>npm</b>  <b>install</b>  <b>tea-latte</b>  could  possibly  yield  the
       following dependency graph:
         ├── <a href="mailto:tea-latte@1.3.5">tea-latte@1.3.5</a>
         └── <a href="mailto:tea@2.2.0">tea@2.2.0</a>

       In npm versions 3 through 6, <b>peerDependencies</b> were not automatically
       installed, and would raise a warning if an invalid version of the peer
       dependency was found in the tree.  As of npm v7, peerDependencies <u>are</u>
       installed by default.

       Trying to install another plugin with a conflicting requirement may cause
       an error if the tree cannot be resolved correctly. For this reason, make
       sure your plugin requirement is as broad as possible, and not to lock it
       down to specific patch versions.

       Assuming the host complies with semver, only changes
       in the host package's major version will break your plugin. Thus, if you've
       worked with every 1.x version of the host package, use <b>&amp;quot;^1.0&amp;quot;</b> or <b>&amp;quot;1.x&amp;quot;</b>
       to express this. If you depend on features introduced in 1.5.2, use
       <b>&amp;quot;^1.5.2&amp;quot;</b>.

</pre><h4><b>peerDependenciesMeta</b></h4><pre>
       When a user installs your package, npm will emit warnings if packages
       specified in <b>peerDependencies</b> are not already installed. The
       <b>peerDependenciesMeta</b> field serves to provide npm more information on how
       your peer dependencies are to be used. Specifically, it allows peer
       dependencies to be marked as optional.

       For example:
         {
           "name": "tea-latte",
           "version": "1.3.5",
           "peerDependencies": {
             "tea": "2.x",
             "soy-milk": "1.2"
           },
           "peerDependenciesMeta": {
             "soy-milk": {
               "optional": true
             }
           }
         }

       Marking a peer dependency as optional ensures npm will not emit a warning
       if the <b>soy-milk</b> package is not installed on the host. This allows you to
       integrate and interact with a variety of host packages without requiring
       all of them to be installed.

</pre><h4><b>bundleDependencies</b></h4><pre>
       This defines an array of package names that will be bundled when publishing
       the package.

       In cases where you need to preserve npm packages locally or have them
       available through a single file download, you can bundle the packages in a
       tarball file by specifying the package names in the <b>bundleDependencies</b>
       array and executing <b>npm</b> <b>pack</b>.

       For example:

       If we define a package.json like this:
         {
           "name": "awesome-web-framework",
           "version": "1.0.0",
           "bundleDependencies": [
             "renderized",
             "super-streams"
           ]
         }

       we can obtain <b>awesome-web-framework-1.0.0.tgz</b> file by running <b>npm</b> <b>pack</b>.
       This file contains the dependencies <b>renderized</b> and <b>super-streams</b> which
       can  be  installed  in a new project by executing <b>npm</b> <b>install</b> <b>awesome-web-framework-1.0.0.tgz</b>.  Note that
       the package names do not
       include any versions, as that information is specified in <b>dependencies</b>.

       If this is spelled <b>&amp;quot;bundledDependencies&amp;quot;</b>, then that is also honored.

       Alternatively, <b>&amp;quot;bundleDependencies&amp;quot;</b> can be defined as a boolean value. A
       value of <b>true</b> will bundle all dependencies, a value of <b>false</b> will bundle
       none.

</pre><h4><b>optionalDependencies</b></h4><pre>
       If a dependency can be used, but you would like npm to proceed if it cannot
       be found or fails to install, then you may put it in the
       <b>optionalDependencies</b> object.  This is a map of package name to version or
       url, just like the <b>dependencies</b> object.  The difference is that build
       failures do not cause installation to fail.  Running  <b>npm</b>  <b>install</b>  <b>--omit=optional</b>  will  prevent  these
       dependencies from being installed.

       It is still your program's responsibility to handle the lack of the
       dependency.  For example, something like this:
         try {
           var foo = require('foo')
           var fooVersion = require('foo/package.json').version
         } catch (er) {
           foo = null
         }
         if ( notGoodFooVersion(fooVersion) ) {
           foo = null
         }

         // .. then later in your program ..

         if (foo) {
           foo.doFooThings()
         }

       Entries in <b>optionalDependencies</b> will override entries of the same name in
       <b>dependencies</b>, so it's usually best to only put in one place.

</pre><h4><b>overrides</b></h4><pre>
       If you need to make specific changes to dependencies of your dependencies, for
       example replacing the version of a dependency with a known security issue,
       replacing an existing dependency with a fork, or making sure that the same
       version of a package is used everywhere, then you may add an override.

       Overrides provide a way to replace a package in your dependency tree with
       another version, or another package entirely. These changes can be scoped as
       specific or as vague as desired.

       To make sure the package <b>foo</b> is always installed as version <b>1.0.0</b> no matter
       what version your dependencies rely on:
         {
           "overrides": {
             "foo": "1.0.0"
           }
         }

       The above is a short hand notation, the full object form can be used to allow
       overriding a package itself as well as a child of the package. This will cause
       <b>foo</b> to always be <b>1.0.0</b> while also making <b>bar</b> at any depth beyond <b>foo</b>
       also <b>1.0.0</b>:
         {
           "overrides": {
             "foo": {
               ".": "1.0.0",
               "bar": "1.0.0"
             }
           }
         }

       To only override <b>foo</b> to be <b>1.0.0</b> when it's a child (or grandchild, or great
       grandchild, etc) of the package <b>bar</b>:
         {
           "overrides": {
             "bar": {
               "foo": "1.0.0"
             }
           }
         }

       Keys can be nested to any arbitrary length. To override <b>foo</b> only when it's a
       child of <b>bar</b> and only when <b>bar</b> is a child of <b>baz</b>:
         {
           "overrides": {
             "baz": {
               "bar": {
                 "foo": "1.0.0"
               }
             }
           }
         }

       The key of an override can also include a version, or range of versions.
       To override <b>foo</b> to <b>1.0.0</b>, but only when it's a child of <b><a href="mailto:bar@2.0.0">bar@2.0.0</a></b>:
         {
           "overrides": {
             "<a href="mailto:bar@2.0.0">bar@2.0.0</a>": {
               "foo": "1.0.0"
             }
           }
         }

       You may not set an override for a package that you directly depend on unless
       both the dependency and the override itself share the exact same spec. To make
       this limitation easier to deal with, overrides may also be defined as a
       reference to a spec for a direct dependency by prefixing the name of the
       package you wish the version to match with a <b>$</b>.
         {
           "dependencies": {
             "foo": "^1.0.0"
           },
           "overrides": {
             // BAD, will throw an EOVERRIDE error
             // "foo": "^2.0.0"
             // GOOD, specs match so override is allowed
             // "foo": "^1.0.0"
             // BEST, the override is defined as a reference to the dependency
             "foo": "$foo",
             // the referenced package does not need to match the overridden one
             "bar": "$foo"
           }
         }

</pre><h4><b>engines</b></h4><pre>
       You can specify the version of node that your stuff works on:
         {
           "engines": {
             "node": "&gt;=0.10.3 &lt;15"
           }
         }

       And, like with dependencies, if you don't specify the version (or if you
       specify "*" as the version), then any version of node will do.

       You can also use the "engines" field to specify which versions of npm are
       capable of properly installing your program.  For example:
         {
           "engines": {
             "npm": "~1.0.20"
           }
         }

       Unless the user has set the
       <b>engine-strict</b> config flag, this field is
       advisory only and will only produce warnings when your package is installed as a
       dependency.

</pre><h4><b>os</b></h4><pre>
       You can specify which operating systems your
       module will run on:
         {
           "os": [
             "darwin",
             "linux"
           ]
         }

       You can also block instead of allowing operating systems, just prepend the
       blocked os with a '!':
         {
           "os": [
             "!win32"
           ]
         }

       The host operating system is determined by <b>process.platform</b>

       It is allowed to both block and allow an item, although there isn't any
       good reason to do this.

</pre><h4><b>cpu</b></h4><pre>
       If your code only runs on certain cpu architectures,
       you can specify which ones.
         {
           "cpu": [
             "x64",
             "ia32"
           ]
         }

       Like the <b>os</b> option, you can also block architectures:
         {
           "cpu": [
             "!arm",
             "!mips"
           ]
         }

       The host architecture is determined by <b>process.arch</b>

</pre><h4><b>private</b></h4><pre>
       If you set <b>&amp;quot;private&amp;quot;:</b> <b>true</b> in your package.json, then npm will refuse to
       publish it.

       This is a way to prevent accidental publication of private repositories.
       If you would like to ensure that a given package is only ever published to
       a specific registry (for example, an internal registry), then use the
       <b>publishConfig</b> dictionary described below to override the <b>registry</b>
       config param at publish-time.

</pre><h4><b>publishConfig</b></h4><pre>
       This is a set of config values that will be used at publish-time. It's
       especially handy if you want to set the tag, registry or access, so that
       you can ensure that a given package is not tagged with "latest", published
       to the global public registry or that a scoped module is private by
       default.

       See <b>config</b> to see the list of config options that
       can be overridden.

</pre><h4><b>workspaces</b></h4><pre>
       The optional <b>workspaces</b> field is an array of file patterns that describes
       locations within the local file system that the install client should look
       up to find each workspace that needs to be
       symlinked to the top level <b>node_modules</b> folder.

       It can describe either the direct paths of the folders to be used as
       workspaces or it can define globs that will resolve to these same folders.

       In the following example, all folders located inside the folder
       <b>./packages</b> will be treated as workspaces as long as they have valid
       <b>package.json</b> files inside them:
         {
           "name": "workspace-example",
           "workspaces": [
             "./packages/*"
           ]
         }

       See <b>workspaces</b> for more examples.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>VALUES</b></h4><pre>
       npm will default some values based on package contents.

        • <b>&amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot;:</b> <b>{&amp;quot;start&amp;quot;:</b> <b>&amp;quot;node</b> <b>server.js&amp;quot;}</b>

        If there is a <b>server.js</b> file in the root of your package, then npm will
        default the <b>start</b> command to <b>node</b> <b>server.js</b>.

        • <b>&amp;quot;scripts&amp;quot;:{&amp;quot;install&amp;quot;:</b> <b>&amp;quot;node-gyp</b> <b>rebuild&amp;quot;}</b>

        If there is a <b>binding.gyp</b> file in the root of your package and you have
        not defined an <b>install</b> or <b>preinstall</b> script, npm will default the
        <b>install</b> command to compile using node-gyp.

        • <b>&amp;quot;contributors&amp;quot;:</b> <b>[...]</b>

        If there is an <b>AUTHORS</b> file in the root of your package, npm will treat
        each line as a <b>Name</b> <b>&lt;email&gt;</b> <b>(url)</b> format, where email and url are
        optional.  Lines which start with a <b>#</b> or are blank, will be ignored.
