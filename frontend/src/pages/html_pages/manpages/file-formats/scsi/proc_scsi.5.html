</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:/proc/scsi/">/proc/scsi/</a> - SCSI

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/proc/scsi/">/proc/scsi/</a></u>
              A  directory  with  the  <u>scsi</u> mid-level pseudo-file and various SCSI low-level driver directories,
              which contain a file for each SCSI host in this system, all of which give the status of some  part
              of  the SCSI IO subsystem.  These files contain ASCII structures and are, therefore, readable with
              <b><a href="../man1/cat.1.html">cat</a></b>(1).

              You can also write to some of the files to reconfigure the subsystem or switch certain features on
              or off.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/scsi/scsi">/proc/scsi/scsi</a></u>
              This is a listing of all SCSI devices known to the kernel.  The listing is similar to the one seen
              during bootup.  scsi currently supports only the <u>add-single-device</u> command which  allows  root  to
              add a hotplugged device to the list of known devices.

              The command

                  echo 'scsi add-single-device 1 0 5 0' &gt; <a href="file:/proc/scsi/scsi">/proc/scsi/scsi</a>

              will cause host scsi1 to scan on SCSI channel 0 for a device on ID 5 LUN 0.  If there is already a
              device known on this address or the address is invalid, an error will be returned.

       <u><a href="file:/proc/scsi/">/proc/scsi/</a></u>drivername<u>/</u>
              <u>drivername</u>  can  currently  be  NCR53c7xx, aha152x, aha1542, aha1740, aic7xxx, buslogic, eata_dma,
              eata_pio, fdomain, in2000, pas16, qlogic,  scsi_debug,  seagate,  t128,  u15-24f,  ultrastore,  or
              wd7000.   These  directories show up for all drivers that registered at least one SCSI HBA.  Every
              directory contains one file per registered host.  Every host-file is named after  the  number  the
              host was assigned during initialization.

              Reading these files will usually show driver and host configuration, statistics, and so on.

              Writing  to these files allows different things on different hosts.  For example, with the <u>latency</u>
              and <u>nolatency</u> commands, root can switch on  and  off  command  latency  measurement  code  in  the
              eata_dma  driver.   With the <u>lockup</u> and <u>unlock</u> commands, root can control bus lockups simulated by
              the scsi_debug driver.
