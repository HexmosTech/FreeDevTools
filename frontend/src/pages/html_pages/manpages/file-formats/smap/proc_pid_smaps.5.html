</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/smaps</u> (since Linux 2.6.14)
              This  file  shows  memory  consumption  for  each of the process's mappings.  (The <b><a href="../man1/pmap.1.html">pmap</a></b>(1) command
              displays similar information, in a form that may be easier for parsing.)  For each  mapping  there
              is a series of lines such as the following:

                  00400000-0048a000 r-xp 00000000 fd:03 960637       <a href="file:/bin/bash">/bin/bash</a>
                  Size:                552 kB
                  Rss:                 460 kB
                  Pss:                 100 kB
                  Shared_Clean:        452 kB
                  Shared_Dirty:          0 kB
                  Private_Clean:         8 kB
                  Private_Dirty:         0 kB

                  ShmemHugePages:        0 kB
                  ShmemPmdMapped:        0 kB
                  Swap:                  0 kB
                  KernelPageSize:        4 kB
                  MMUPageSize:           4 kB
                  Locked:                0 kB
                  ProtectionKey:         0
                  VmFlags: rd ex mr mw me dw

              The  first  of  these  lines  shows  the  same  information  as  is  displayed  for the mapping in
              <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/maps</u>.  The following lines show the size of the mapping, the amount of the mapping  that
              is  currently  resident  in RAM ("Rss"), the process's proportional share of this mapping ("Pss"),
              the number of clean and dirty shared pages in the mapping, and  the  number  of  clean  and  dirty
              private  pages  in  the  mapping.  "Referenced" indicates the amount of memory currently marked as
              referenced or accessed.  "Anonymous" shows the amount of memory that does not belong to any  file.
              "Swap" shows how much would-be-anonymous memory is also used, but out on swap.

              The  "KernelPageSize"  line  (available since Linux 2.6.29) is the page size used by the kernel to
              back the virtual memory area.  This matches the size used by the MMU in  the  majority  of  cases.
              However,  one  counter-example occurs on PPC64 kernels whereby a kernel using 64 kB as a base page
              size may still use 4 kB pages for the MMU on older processors.  To distinguish the two attributes,
              the "MMUPageSize" line (also available since Linux 2.6.29) reports the page size used by the MMU.

              The "Locked" indicates whether the mapping is locked in memory or not.

              The "ProtectionKey" line (available since Linux 4.9, on x86 only) contains the  memory  protection
              key  (see  <b><a href="../man7/pkeys.7.html">pkeys</a></b>(7))  associated  with the virtual memory area.  This entry is present only if the
              kernel was built with  the  <b>CONFIG_X86_INTEL_MEMORY_PROTECTION_KEYS</b>  configuration  option  (since
              Linux 4.6).

              The  "VmFlags"  line  (available  since Linux 3.8) represents the kernel flags associated with the
              virtual memory area, encoded using the following two-letter codes:

                     rd   -   readable
                     wr   -   writable
                     ex   -   executable
                     sh   -   shared
                     mr   -   may read
                     mw   -   may write
                     me   -   may execute
                     ms   -   may share
                     gd   -   stack segment grows down
                     pf   -   pure PFN range
                     dw   -   disabled write to the mapped file
                     lo   -   pages are locked in memory
                     io   -   memory mapped I/O area
                     sr   -   sequential read advise provided
                     rr   -   random read advise provided
                     dc   -   do not copy area on fork
                     de   -   do not expand area on remapping
                     ac   -   area is accountable
                     nr   -   swap space is not reserved for the area
                     ht   -   area uses huge tlb pages
                     sf   -   perform synchronous page faults (since Linux 4.15)
                     nl   -   non-linear mapping (removed in Linux 4.0)
                     ar   -   architecture specific flag
                     wf   -   wipe on fork (since Linux 4.14)
                     dd   -   do not include area into core dump
                     sd   -   soft-dirty flag (since Linux 3.13)
                     mm   -   mixed map area
                     hg   -   huge page advise flag
                     nh   -   no-huge page advise flag
                     mg   -   mergeable advise flag
                     um   -   userfaultfd missing pages tracking (since Linux 4.3)
                     uw   -   userfaultfd wprotect pages tracking (since Linux 4.3)

              The <u><a href="file:/proc/">/proc/</a></u>pid<u>/smaps</u> file is present only  if  the  <b>CONFIG_PROC_PAGE_MONITOR</b>  kernel  configuration
              option is enabled.
