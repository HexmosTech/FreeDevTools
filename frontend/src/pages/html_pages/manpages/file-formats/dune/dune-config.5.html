</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dune-config - configuring the dune build system

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="file:~/.config/dune/config">~/.config/dune/config</a>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Unless <b>--no-config</b> or <b>-p</b> is passed, Dune will read a configuration file from the user home directory.
       This file is used to control various aspects of the behavior of Dune.

       The configuration file is normally <b><a href="file:~/.config/dune/config">~/.config/dune/config</a></b> on Unix systems and <b>Local</b> <b>Settings/dune/config</b>
       in the User home directory on Windows. However, it is possible to specify an alternative configuration
       file with the <b>--config-file</b> option.

       The first line of the file must be of the form (lang dune X.Y) where X.Y is the version of the dune
       language used in the file.

       The rest of the file must be written in S-expression syntax and be composed of a list of stanzas. The
       following sections describe the stanzas available.

</pre><h4><b>CACHING</b></h4><pre>
       Syntax: <b>(cache</b> <b>ENABLED)</b>

        This stanza determines whether dune's build caching is enabled. See
       https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/caching.html for details. Valid values for  <b>ENABLED</b> are  <b>enabled</b> or
       <b>disabled</b>.

</pre><h4><b>DISPLAY</b> <b>MODES</b></h4><pre>
       Syntax: <b>(display</b> <b>MODE)</b>

       This stanza controls how Dune reports what it is doing to the user. This parameter can also be set from
       the command line via <b>--display</b> <b>MODE</b>. The following display modes are available:

       <b>progress</b>
           This is the default, Dune shows and update a status line as build goals are being completed.

       <b>quiet</b>
           Only display errors.

       <b>short</b>
           Print  one  line  per  command  being executed, with the binary name on the left and the reason it is
           being executed for on the right.

       <b>verbose</b>
           Print the full command  lines  of  programs  being  executed  by  Dune,  with  some  colors  to  help
           differentiate programs.

       Note that when the selected display mode is <b>progress</b> and the output is not a terminal then the <b>quiet</b> mode
       is  selected  instead. This rule doesn't apply when running Dune inside Emacs. Dune detects whether it is
       executed from inside Emacs or not by looking at the environment variable  <b>INSIDE_EMACS</b>  that  is  set  by
       Emacs.  If  you  want  the  same  behavior with another editor, you can set this variable. If your editor
       already sets another variable, please open a ticket on the ocaml/dune GitHub project so that we  can  add
       support for it.

</pre><h4><b>JOBS</b></h4><pre>
       Syntax: <b>(jobs</b> <b>NUMBER)</b>

       Set the maximum number of jobs Dune might run in parallel. This can also be set from the command line via
       <b>-j</b> <b>NUMBER</b>.

       The default for this value is the number of processors.

</pre><h4><b>SANDBOXING</b></h4><pre>
       Syntax: <b>(sandboxing_preference</b> <b>MODE</b> <b>...)</b>

       Controls  the  sandboxing  mode  preference order used by dune. Dune will use the earliest item from this
       list that's allowed by the action dependency specification, or fall back on the hard-coded  default.  See
       <b>man</b> <b>dune-build</b> for the description of individual modes.
