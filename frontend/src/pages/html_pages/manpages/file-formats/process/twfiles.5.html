</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       twfiles - overview of files used by <u>Tripwire</u> and file backup process

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Configuration</b> <b>File</b>
       <b>default:</b> <u>/etc/tripwire/tw.cfg</u>
       The  configuration  file stores system-specific information, such as the location of <u>Tripwire</u> data files.
       The configuration settings are generated during the installation process,  but  can  be  changed  by  the
       system administrator at any time.  See the <b><a href="../man4/twconfig.4.html">twconfig</a></b>(4) man page for a more complete discussion.

   <b>Policy</b> <b>File</b>
       <b>default:</b> <u>/etc/tripwire/tw.pol</u>
       The policy file consists of a series of rules specifying the system objects that <u>Tripwire</u> should monitor,
       and the data for each object that should be collected and stored in the database file.  Should unexpected
       changes  occur, the policy file can describe the person to be notified and the severity of the violation.
       See the <u>policyguide.txt</u> file in the policy directory and the <b><a href="../man4/twpolicy.4.html">twpolicy</a></b>(4) man page  for  a  more  complete
       discussion.

   <b>Database</b> <b>File</b>
       <b>default:</b> <u><a href="file:/var/lib/">/var/lib/</a>$(HOSTNAME).twd</u>
       The  database  file  serves as the baseline for integrity checking.  After installation, <u>Tripwire</u> creates
       the initial database file, a "snapshot" of the filesystem in  a  known  secure  state.   Later,  when  an
       integrity  check  is  run,  <u>Tripwire</u> compares each system object described in the policy file against its
       corresponding entry in the database.  A report is created, and  if  an  object  has  changed  outside  of
       constraints  defined in the policy file, a violation is reported.  See the <b><a href="../man8/tripwire.8.html">tripwire</a></b>(8) and <b><a href="../man8/twprint.8.html">twprint</a></b>(8) man
       pages for more information on creating and maintaining database files.

   <b>Report</b> <b>Files</b>
       <b>default:</b> <u>/var/lib/tripwire/report/$(HOSTNAME)-$(DATE).twr</u>
       Once the above three files have been created, <u>Tripwire</u> can run an integrity  check  and  search  for  any
       differences  between  the  current  system and the data stored in the "baseline" <u>Tripwire</u> database.  This
       information is archived into report files, a collection of rule violations discovered during an integrity
       check.  With the appropriate settings, a report can also be emailed to one or more recipients.   See  the
       <b><a href="../man8/tripwire.8.html">tripwire</a></b>(8) and <b><a href="../man8/twprint.8.html">twprint</a></b>(8) man pages for information on creating and printing report files.

   <b>Key</b> <b>Files</b>
       <b>defaults:</b> <u>/etc/tripwire/site.key</u> <u>and</u> <u>/etc/tripwire/$(HOSTNAME)-local.key</u>
       It  is  critical  that  <u>Tripwire</u>  files be protected from unauthorized access‐‐an attacker who is able to
       modify these files can subvert <u>Tripwire</u> operation.  For this reason, all of the above  files  are  signed
       using  public  key  cryptography to prevent unauthorized modification.  Two separate sets of keys protect
       critical <u>Tripwire</u> data files.  One or both of these key sets is necessary  for  performing  almost  every
       <u>Tripwire</u> task.

       The  site  key  is  used  to  protect files that could be used across several systems.  This includes the
       policy and configuration files.  The local key is used to protect files specific to  the  local  machine,
       such  as the <u>Tripwire</u> database.  The local key may also be used for signing integrity check reports.  See
       the <b><a href="../man8/twadmin.8.html">twadmin</a></b>(8) man page for more information on keys.

   <b>File</b> <b>Backup</b>
       To prevent the accidental deletion  of  important  data,  <u>Tripwire</u>  automatically  creates  backup  files
       whenever  any  <u>Tripwire</u> file is overwritten. The existing file will be renamed with a <u>.bak</u> extension, and
       the new version of the file will take its place.  Only one backup copy for each filename can exist at any
       time.  If a backup copy of a file already exists, the older backup file will be deleted and replaced with
       the newer one.

       File backup is an integral part of <u>Tripwire</u>, and cannot be removed or changed.
