       conf - LAM node process schema

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Most LAM/MPI used can disregard this page.

       A  process  schema  lists  the  system processes that will constitute the LAM environment on a particular
       node.  LAM developers will find process schemata very useful for  debugging  and  for  generating  custom
       systems.

       Separate  default  configurations  files  are  normally used for booting either the single-daemon version
       (conf.lam) or the external-servers version (conf.otb).  The single-daemon version  is  used  by  default.
       The  external-servers  version  is  typically used by LAM developers when debugging LAM services.  The <u>-c</u>
       option to <a href="../man1/hboot.1.html">hboot</a>(1) specifies the file name of a custom process schema.  This capability is not  available
       with <a href="../man1/lamboot.1.html">lamboot</a>(1).

       Application  programs can be booted with the LAM environment by including the program name in the process
       schema.

</pre><h4><b>STRUCTURE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       The process schema grammar defines three types of statements: comments, processes, and options.

       Comments begin with # and terminate with a newline.

       Process statements consist of a filename, command line arguments,  and  possibly  options  local  to  the
       process.   The  command line arguments are passed to the process when it is started.  The process options
       are used by the booting tools before starting the process.

       Filenames may include application programs and any of the system processes listed below.

       bforward    bufferd helper, forwards remote messages.

       bufferd     creates, kills, sweeps, and states buffers.

       dli_inet    sends data on network connections.

       dlo_inet    receives data from network connections.

       echod       echoes messages; can be used to test nodes and links.

       filed       serves file access.

       flatd       provides symbolic access to node memory.

       iod         handles stdio data of processes.

       kenyad      controls and monitors processes.

       kernel      coordinates message passing.

       lamd        single-daemon version of all servers excluding ledd and mtvd.

       ledd        controls LEDs.

       loadd       loads executable files onto nodes.

       mtvd        controls a pixel map display.

       router      maintains routing tables.

       traced      collects and transports trace data.

       Processes are started in the order given in the process schema, and for LAM, the order is important.  The
       kernel must be first.

       Process options are placed inside braces {}  following  the  command  line  arguments.   Process  options
       consist of a keyword followed by an assigned value in parentheses.  Options that are not explicitly given
       have  default settings.  Options inside braces in process statements apply only to that process.  Options
       outside process statements apply to all processes that appear later in the process schema, unless locally
       overridden.  All the options are listed below:

       inet_topo   a string of dli_inet or lamd options, global only, default null

       rtr_topo    a string of router options, global only, default null

       delay       waiting time in seconds after process boot, default 0

       The inet_topo and rtr_topo options can be overridden from the command line of <a href="../man1/hboot.1.html">hboot</a>(1) using the  -I  and
       -R options respectively.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Following are example process schemata.  The first file is used for an OTB node in LAM.

       ##
       ## typical LAM process schemata
       ##

       lamd $inet_topo

       The  second  file  is  used by LAM developers to control each server as an independent process, typically
       during debugging.
