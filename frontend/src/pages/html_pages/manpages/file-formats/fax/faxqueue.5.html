</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       faxqueue - sendfax fax spool queue control files

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/var/spool/fax/outgoing/F*/JOB</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>JOB</u> files in the subdirectories of the outgoing fax spool directory, <u>/var/spool/fax/outgoing</u> build up
       a  queue  of faxes to be sent by <a href="../man1/faxrunq.1.html">faxrunq</a>(1). They are created by <a href="../man1/faxspool.1.html">faxspool</a>(1), can be viewed with <a href="../man1/faxq.1.html">faxq</a>(1),
       and be deleted by <a href="../man1/faxrm.1.html">faxrm</a>(1).

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The format of the JOB file is as follows:

       Each line consists of a leading keyword and associated data (rest of the line). Some are  required,  some
       others are optional. The currently implemented keywords are:

       <b>phone</b> <b>&lt;number&gt;</b>
              The telephone number to send the fax to. Required.

       <b>user</b> <b>&lt;user&gt;</b>
              The  originating  user  name (on the local machine). If no "mail" field is present, this user will
              get the status mail about the fax. Required.

       <b>mail</b> <b>&lt;email&gt;</b>
              If this field is present, <a href="../man1/faxrunq.1.html">faxrunq</a>(1) will send its status mail to the address given here. If  not,
              <a href="../man1/faxrunq.1.html">faxrunq</a>(1) will use the "user" field.  Optional.

       <b>input</b> <b>&lt;file(s)&gt;</b>
              The file names passed to <a href="../man1/faxspool.1.html">faxspool</a>(1). Optional, used only by <a href="../man1/faxq.1.html">faxq</a>(1).

       <b>pages</b> <b>&lt;file(s)&gt;</b>
              The  file  names,  relative to the directory where the JOB file is found, that are to be sent with
              <a href="../man8/sendfax.8.html">sendfax</a>(8). The files have to exist, and be readable by the user that runs  <a href="../man1/faxrunq.1.html">faxrunq</a>(1).  Required,
              except if "poll" is used, then it's optional.

       <b>priority</b> <b>&lt;0-9&gt;</b>
              This  can be used to set the priority for this job in the fax queue (higher priority jobs get sent
              before all lower-pri jobs). So far, only <u>faxrunqd</u> uses this field, <u>faxrunq</u>  does  NOT.  9  is  the
              highest, 0 the lowest priority. 5 is the default.

       <b>Status</b> <b>&lt;message&gt;</b>
              Automatically  appended  by  <a href="../man1/faxrunq.1.html">faxrunq</a>(1)  after  each  run,  tells  the reader about successful and
              unsuccessful tries to send this job. If more than five "FATAL" errors are listed, the fax  job  is
              removed from the queue.

       <b>verbose_to</b> <b>&lt;blurb&gt;</b>
              A plain-text description of the receiver of the fax. Is returned, if present, in the mail messages
              "your fax to &lt;blurb&gt;". Optional.

       <b>time</b> <b>&lt;hhmm&gt;</b>
              If  present, <u>faxrunq</u> won't send this job before the given time. The format must be exactly "hhmm",
              in 24-hr-format, otherwise faxrunq won't understand it. Optional.   (Notice:  this  implies  "stop
              trying after midnight, until hh:mm next day")

       <b>time</b> <b>&lt;hhmm&gt;-&lt;hhmm&gt;</b>
              This  format  specifies  a  time window when sending this fax is permitted, e.g. "time 2300-0500".
              This format will only work if you use <u>faxrunqd,</u> as support for it has  not  been  implemented  for
              <u>faxrunq</u> yet.

       <b>poll</b>   Flag  token.   If  present,  faxrunq  will  try  to poll the given phone number for documents (see
              "sendfax -p").

       <b>normal_res</b>
              Flag token.  If present, faxrunq will transmit all pages using  normal  resolution  (see  "sendfax
              -n").

       <b>acct_handle</b> <b>&lt;arbitrary</b> <b>string&gt;</b>
              This  is  a  pure comment field, but <a href="../man8/sendfax.8.html">sendfax</a>(8) will log it into its transaction log file. So this
              can be used as a customer handle, a job number, whatever you need to get the phone  bills  charged
              to the customer (the programs won't look at it, just pass it through). Optional.

       <b>subject</b> <b>&lt;arbitrary</b> <b>string&gt;</b>
              This  is  also a pure comment field, used only for informational purposes.  <u>faxrunq</u> will return it
              in the sucess/failure mail. If you use <u>faxspool</u> <u>-s</u> <u>&lt;subj&gt;,</u> it will put this string  on  the  cover
              page and in the JOB file.

</pre><h4><b>PERMISSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Starting  with  mgetty  1.1.29,  the  fax  spool  directory  /var/spool/fax/outgoing  is no longer world-
       writeable.  It should be owned by the user 'uucp' and  be  mode  755.   The  <a href="../man1/faxrunq.1.html">faxrunq</a>(1)  and  <a href="../man1/faxrunqd.1.html">faxrunqd</a>(1)
       programs should also be run under that user ID if possible.

       If  the fax spool directory is world- or group-writeable, there are a number of denial of service or file
       overwrite / file access attacks possible that it's very hard to guard against. So don't do this!

       If the fax spool directory has the proper permissions, there  are  currently  no  known  attacks  against
       faxrunq/faxrunqd, even if they run as "root", but it's always more safe to run as untrusted user.

</pre><h4><b>PROCESSING</b></h4><pre>
       While  a  given  JOB  file  is  processed by <a href="../man1/faxrunq.1.html">faxrunq</a>(1), it's locked against sending it multiple times by
       temporarily renaming it to <u>JOB.locked,</u> thus it may happen that a <a href="../man1/faxq.1.html">faxq</a>(1) command doesn't show this job. (
       <u><a href="../man8/faxrunqd.8.html">faxrunqd</a>(8)</u> is a bit smarter and does the locking by creating a hard link).

       When a job is successfully sent, it's not deleted but the JOB file is renamed to  <u>JOB.done.</u>   Because  of
       this,  you  can  still  see  old  jobs  with  "faxq  -o".  You should regularly clean up the outgoing fax
       directory, removing old faxes. If you don't want this behaviour, edit  the  <a href="../man1/faxrunq.1.html">faxrunq</a>(1)  config  file  and
       enable the option <u>delete-sent-jobs</u> <u>yes</u>

       When a job cannot be sent after several tries (excluding normal difficulties like the called number being
       busy  or  the  modem being in use), the JOB file is renamed to <u>JOB.suspended.</u>  To re-queue this job, call
       <u>faxq</u> <u>-r</u> -- this renames the JOB file back.
