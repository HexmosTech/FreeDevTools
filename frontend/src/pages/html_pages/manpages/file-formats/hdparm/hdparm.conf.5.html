       hdparm.conf - Debian configuration file for hdparm

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  is the default configuration for hdparm for Debian.  It is a rather simple script, so please follow
       the following guidelines :) Any line that begins with a comment is ignored - add as many as you like.

       Since hdparm doesn't use init script anymore, this configuration is mainly used by udev.  Still  one  can
       re-apply settings from the config file by calling either

       <b><a href="file:/usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/95hdparm-apm">/usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/95hdparm-apm</a></b> <b>resume</b>

       or by calling

       <b>DEVNAME=<a href="file:/dev/">/dev/</a>&lt;disk&gt;</b> <b><a href="file:/usr/lib/udev/hdparm">/usr/lib/udev/hdparm</a></b>

       Note  that  an  in-line  comment  is not supported.  If a line consists of whitespace only (tabs, spaces,
       carriage return), it will be ignored, so you can space control fields as  you  like.   ANYTHING  ELSE  IS
       PARSED!!

       This  means  that  lines  with  stray  characters  or  lines  that  use  non # comment characters will be
       interpreted by the initscript.  This has probably minor, but potentially serious, side effects  for  your
       hard drives, so please follow the guidelines.  Patches to improve flexibilty welcome.

       Note  that  if  the init script causes boot problems, you can pass 'nohdparm' on the kernel command line,
       and the script will not be run.

       Setting an option outside of one of the stanzas enables it for all drives.

       If an option is listed twice, the second instance replaces the first.

       <a href="file:/sbin/hdparm">/sbin/hdparm</a> is not run unless a block of the form:

       <b>DEV</b> <b>{</b>

       option

       option

       }

       exists.  This blocks will cause <a href="file:/sbin/hdparm">/sbin/hdparm</a> OPTIONS DEV to be run.  Where OPTIONS is  the  concatenation
       of all options previously defined outside of a block and all options defined with in the block.
