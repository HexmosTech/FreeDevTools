       BACKUP.D - Action configuration files for <b><a href="../man1/backupninja.1.html">backupninja</a>(1)</b>.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/backup.d/*</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       To  preform  the  actual  backup  actions,  backupninja  processes  each  action  configuration  file  in
       /etc/backup.d according to the file's suffix.

       .sh       run this file as a shell script.

       .rdiff    backup action for rdiff-backup.

       .restic   backup action for restic.

       .dup      backup action for duplicity.

       .borg     backup action for borgbackup.

       .maildir  backup action for slow, incremental rsyncs of tens of thousands of maildirs.

       .mysql    backup action for safe MySQL dumps.

       .pgsql    backup action for safe PostgreSQL dumps.

       .sys      backup action for general system reports and hardware information.

       .svn      backup action for safe backups of subversion repositories.

       .trac     backup action for safe backups of trac repositories.

       .makecd   backup action for burning backups to CD/DVD or creating ISOs.

       These files must be owned by root and must not be world or group readable/writable. Support for
       additional configuration types can be added by dropping bash scripts with the name of the suffix into
       /usr/share/backupninja.

       The configuration files are processed in alphabetical order. However, it is suggested that you name the
       config files in "sysvinit style."

       For example:
                  10-local.pgsql.disabled
                  15-runthisfirst.sh
                  20-runthisnext.mysql
                  90-runthislast.rdiff

       Typically, you will put a '.rdiff' config file last, so that any database dumps you make are included in
       the filesystem backup. Action configurations which end with .disabled are skipped.

       Example templates for the action configuration files can be found in /usr/share/doc/backupninja/examples.
       You can also use <b><a href="../man1/ninjahelper.1.html">ninjahelper</a>(1)</b>, a console based "wizard" for creating backup actions.

</pre><h4><b>SCHEDULING</b></h4><pre>
       By default, each configuration file is processed everyday at  01:00  (1  AM).  This  can  be  changed  by
       specifying  the  'when'  option  in  a  backup  action's config file or in the global configuration file.
       Special value 'manual' will disable scheduling for the backup action. It is possible to  run  the  backup
       action manually by invoking <b><a href="../man1/ninjahelper.1.html">ninjahelper</a>(1)</b> with --run command line argument.

       For example:
         when = sundays at 02:00
         when = 30th at 22
         when = 30 at 22:00
         when = everyday at 01
         when = Tuesday at 05:00
         when = hourly
         when = manual

       These values for "when" are invalid:
         when = everyday at 5:00
         when = tuesday at 2am
         when = tuesday at 2
         when = tues at 02

       A  configuration file will be processed at the time(s) specified by the "when" option. If multiple "when"
       options are present, then they all apply. If two configurations files are scheduled to run  in  the  same
       hour,  then  we  fall back on the alphabetical ordering specified above. The "when" must occur before any
       sections in the action configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The file format of the action configuration files is "ini style." Sections are created  by  using  square
       bracket. Long lines are connected with a backslash. For example:

          # this is a comment
          [fishes]
          fish = red
          fish = blue
          [fruit]
          apple = yes
          pear = no thanks \
          i will not have a pear.
