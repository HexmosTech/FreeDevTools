       filesystems - Linux filesystem types: ext, ext2, ext3, ext4, hpfs, iso9660, JFS, minix, msdos, ncpfs nfs,
       ntfs, proc, Reiserfs, smb, sysv, umsdos, vfat, XFS, xiafs

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       When,   as  is  customary,  the  <b>proc</b>  filesystem  is  mounted  on  <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u>,  you  can  find  in  the  file
       <u><a href="file:/proc/filesystems">/proc/filesystems</a></u> which filesystems your kernel currently supports; see <b><a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</a></b>(5) for more details.   There
       is  also  a  legacy  <b><a href="../man2/sysfs.2.html">sysfs</a></b>(2)  system  call (whose availability is controlled by the <b>CONFIG_SYSFS_SYSCALL</b>
       kernel build configuration option since Linux 3.15) that enables enumeration of the  currently  available
       filesystem types regardless of <u><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></u> availability and/or sanity.

       If  you  need a currently unsupported filesystem, insert the corresponding kernel module or recompile the
       kernel.

       In order to use a filesystem, you have to <u>mount</u> it; see <b><a href="../man2/mount.2.html">mount</a></b>(2) and <b><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></b>(8).

       The following list provides a short description of the available or historically available filesystems in
       the Linux kernel.  See the kernel documentation for  a  comprehensive  description  of  all  options  and
       limitations.

       <b>erofs</b>  is the Enhanced Read-Only File System, stable since Linux 5.4.  See <b><a href="../man5/erofs.5.html">erofs</a></b>(5).

       <b>ext</b>    is  an  elaborate  extension  of  the  <b>minix</b> filesystem.  It has been completely superseded by the
              second version of the extended filesystem (<b>ext2</b>) and has been removed from the  kernel  (in  Linux
              2.1.21).

       <b>ext2</b>   is  a  disk  filesystem  that  was  used by Linux for fixed disks as well as removable media.  The
              second extended filesystem was designed as an extension of the  extended  filesystem  (<b>ext</b>).   See
              <b><a href="../man5/ext2.5.html">ext2</a></b>(5).

       <b>ext3</b>   is  a journaling version of the <b>ext2</b> filesystem.  It is easy to switch back and forth between <b>ext2</b>
              and <b>ext3</b>.  See <b><a href="../man5/ext3.5.html">ext3</a></b>(5).

       <b>ext4</b>   is a set of upgrades to <b>ext3</b> including substantial performance and reliability enhancements,  plus
              large increases in volume, file, and directory size limits.  See <b><a href="../man5/ext4.5.html">ext4</a></b>(5).

       <b>hpfs</b>   is the High Performance Filesystem, used in OS/2.  This filesystem is read-only under Linux due to
              the lack of available documentation.

       <b>iso9660</b>
              is a CD-ROM filesystem type conforming to the ISO/IEC 9660 standard.

              <b>High</b> <b>Sierra</b>
                     Linux  supports  High  Sierra,  the  precursor  to  the  ISO/IEC  9660  standard for CD-ROM
                     filesystems.  It is automatically recognized within the <b>iso9660</b>  filesystem  support  under
                     Linux.

              <b>Rock</b> <b>Ridge</b>
                     Linux  also  supports  the  System Use Sharing Protocol records specified by the Rock Ridge
                     Interchange Protocol.  They  are  used  to  further  describe  the  files  in  the  <b>iso9660</b>
                     filesystem  to  a UNIX host, and provide information such as long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX
                     permissions, and devices.  It is automatically recognized  within  the  <b>iso9660</b>  filesystem
                     support under Linux.

       <b>JFS</b>    is a journaling filesystem, developed by IBM, that was integrated into Linux 2.4.24.

       <b>minix</b>  is  the  filesystem  used  in  the Minix operating system, the first to run under Linux.  It has a
              number of shortcomings, including a 64 MB partition size limit,  short  filenames,  and  a  single
              timestamp.  It remains useful for floppies and RAM disks.

       <b>msdos</b>  is the filesystem used by DOS, Windows, and some OS/2 computers.  <b>msdos</b> filenames can be no longer
              than 8 characters, followed by an optional period and 3 character extension.

       <b>ncpfs</b>  is  a  network  filesystem that supports the NCP protocol, used by Novell NetWare.  It was removed
              from the kernel in Linux 4.17.

              To use <b>ncpfs</b>, you need special programs, which can be  found  at  <a href="ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc">ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/linux/misc</a>
              /ncpfs.

       <b>nfs</b>    is the network filesystem used to access disks located on remote computers.

       <b>ntfs</b>   is  the  filesystem  native  to  Microsoft  Windows NT, supporting features like ACLs, journaling,
              encryption, and so on.

       <b>proc</b>   is a pseudo filesystem which is used as an interface to kernel data structures rather than reading
              and interpreting <u>/dev/kmem</u>.  In particular, its files do not take disk space.  See <b><a href="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</a></b>(5).

       <b>Reiserfs</b>
              is a journaling filesystem, designed by Hans Reiser, that was integrated into Linux 2.4.1.

       <b>smb</b>    is  a  network  filesystem   that   supports   the   SMB   protocol,   used   by   Windows.    See
              https://www.samba.org/samba/smbfs/.

       <b>sysv</b>   is  an  implementation  of the System V/Coherent filesystem for Linux.  It implements all of Xenix
              FS, System V/386 FS, and Coherent FS.

       <b>umsdos</b> is an extended DOS filesystem used by Linux.  It adds  capability  for  long  filenames,  UID/GID,
              POSIX  permissions,  and  special  files  (devices,  named  pipes, etc.) under the DOS filesystem,
              without sacrificing compatibility with DOS.

       <b>tmpfs</b>  is a filesystem whose contents reside in virtual memory.  Since  the  files  on  such  filesystems
              typically reside in RAM, file access is extremely fast.  See <b><a href="../man5/tmpfs.5.html">tmpfs</a></b>(5).

       <b>vfat</b>   is  an  extended  FAT  filesystem  used  by  Microsoft  Windows95  and  Windows NT.  <b>vfat</b> adds the
              capability to use long filenames under the MSDOS filesystem.

       <b>XFS</b>    is a journaling filesystem, developed by SGI, that was integrated into Linux 2.4.20.

       <b>xiafs</b>  was designed and implemented to be a stable, safe filesystem by  extending  the  Minix  filesystem
              code.   It  provides  the  basic  most  requested  features  without  undue complexity.  The <b>xiafs</b>
              filesystem is no longer actively developed or maintained.  It was removed from the kernel in Linux
              2.1.21.
