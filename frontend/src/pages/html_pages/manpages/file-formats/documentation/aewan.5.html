       aewan - File format documentation

</pre><h4><b>INTRODUCTION</b></h4><pre>
       Starting  with version 0.9.0, Aewan features an all-new, easier to parse file format. Prior versions used
       a binary (largely undocumented) file format, and relied on a program (ae2aes) to convert it to a readable
       format. With the new format, the ae2aes utility became unnecessary and was deprecated.

       An aewan document is a gzipped file. Therefore, you must first gunzip it in order to be able to parse its
       contents. On the command line, you could use <u>zcat</u> or something of  the  sort.  On  a  program,  you  will
       probably want to use the <u>zlib</u> library.

       In  the  future  it might be better for Aewan to supply a shared library to enable parsing of aewan files
       with minimal effort. Such a library would have to be integrated with the editor in order not to  have  to
       duplicate  code  (i.e. the editor itself would be just a client of the library).  But for the time being,
       you have to read and parse the format on your own.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       In the description below, the items in between brackets are NOT literal, they are placeholders. [S] is  a
       placeholder  for  a string and [N] is a placeholder for a decimal integer, and [B] is a placeholder for a
       boolean value ('true' or 'false'). A line with "..." is not literal either, it just means that the  lines
       above repeat a certain number of times.

       &lt;Aewan Document v1
          layer-count: int: [N]
          meta-info: str: [S]
          &lt;Layer
               name: str: [S]
               width: int: [N]
               height: int: [N]
               visible: bool: [B]
               transparent: bool: [B]
               layer-line: str: [S]
               layer-line: str: [S]
               layer-line: str: [S]
               (...there are &lt;height&gt; such lines...)
          &gt;Layer
          (...there are &lt;layer-count&gt; such blocks...)
       &gt;Aewan Document v1

       Indentation is ignored, but all other whitespace is significant.
       In particular, you can't omit the space that immediately follows
       the ':' field delimiters, or supply more than one space there.
       Notice that the file format does not use any quotation marks
       for the values, not even strings.

</pre><h4><b>REPRESENTATION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>STRINGS</b></h4><pre>
       Strings  are  represented  almost  literally in the file (where the [S] placeholders are in the blueprint
       above), and are not put in between quotes or anything. However, special characters (ASCII codes 1 to  31)
       are  escaped: the escape code is a backslash, followed by the character '0' + ch, where ch is the special
       character. Thus, a newline character would be represented by "\:", since ":" is '0' + 10.

</pre><h4><b>REPRESENTATION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>INTEGERS</b> <b>AND</b> <b>BOOLEANS</b></h4><pre>
       Integers use just the plain old decimal representation. The booleans are represented as  strings:  either
       "true" or "false" (without quotes).

</pre><h4><b>REPRESENTATION</b> <b>OF</b> <b>LAYER</b> <b>LINES</b></h4><pre>
       Each  layer-line  is  a  string,  but  it  is  specially  formatted in order to convey the characters and
       attributes in that line. In order to understand the format of a layer-line string, it is first  necessary
       to  introduce  the  concept  of  cells. A cell in an aewan layer is each of the spaces that can contain a
       character. A cell has two pieces of data: the character that is  in  it,  and  a  color  attribute.   The
       character  is  just  that:  an 8-bit value represing the character drawn there. The color attribute is an
       8-bit unsigned value that packs the foreground and background color of a given cell, as well as  standout
       and blink attributes.

       The  following  color  codes  are  used:  0=black,  1=red,  2=green, 3=yellow, 4=blue, 5=magenta, 6=cyan,
       7=white.

       The 8 bits of the attribute have the following meanings: SFFFLBBB.  Where S is the standout bit,  FFF  is
       the  3-bit  color  code for the foreground color, L is the blink bit, and BBB is the 3-bit color code for
       the background color.

       The layer-line string is composed of the hexadecimal representation of layer_width*2 bytes. Each 2  bytes
       is  the  information  for  one  cell  of the line: the first byte is the character, and the second is the
       attribute. For example, the hex representation for 'A' is 0x41, so a line with five 'A's each of them  in
       a   different   foreground   color   (but   all   with   black   background)   would  be  represented  as
       41104120413041404150.
