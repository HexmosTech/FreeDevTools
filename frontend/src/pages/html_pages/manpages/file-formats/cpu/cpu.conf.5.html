</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       cpu.conf - cpu configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  file  stores  all configurable options for CPU and CPU modules. You can specify the location of the
       configuration file at runtime by specifying the <u>--config</u> or <u>-C</u> command line switches (see  <b><a href="../man8/cpu.8.html">cpu</a>(8)</b>).  Each
       CPU  module  has  its own configuration section, but they are all documented here. It is recommended that
       the config file have strict permissions such as 600. Please note  that  configuration  options  take  the
       following format: option = value and section headers are of the format [HEADER]

</pre><h4><b>GLOBAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Global  options  should  be  under the section marked [GLOBAL]. All options under this section impact all
       operations.

       <b>DEFAULT_METHOD</b> = <u>method</u>
              Specifies what the default administration method is. This value should be a string of either  ldap
              or passwd.

       <b>CRACKLIB_DICTIONARY</b> = <u>file</u>
              If CPU was compiled --with-libcrack <u>file</u> should be the location of cracklib_dict.

</pre><h4><b>LDAP</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       LDAP  options  should  be  under  the  section  marked  [LDAP].   These  options  are  only  useful  when
       <b>DEFAULT_METHOD</b> is set to ldap or when ldap was specified at the command line with the  <b>-M</b>  switch.  These
       options are only used by the LDAP module.

       <b>LDAP_HOST</b> = <u>hostname</u>
              <u>hostname</u>  should be either the IP address or the hostname of the server running the LDAP directory
              that you wish to administer users on. This can be overridden with the <b>-N</b> command line switch.

       <b>LDAP_PORT</b> = <u>port</u>
              <u>port</u> is the port that the LDAP server specified by <b>LDAP_HOST</b> is listening on. This value  must  be
              non negative. This can be overridden by the <b>-P</b> command line switch.

       <b>BIND_DN</b> = <u>dn</u>
              <u>dn</u>  should  be  the  fully  qualified  DN of an LDAP entity with appropriate rights to perform any
              actions that you wish. This value can be overridden by the <b>-D</b> command line switch.

       <b>BIND_PASS</b> = <u>password</u>
              <u>password</u> is the password of the entity specified by <b>BIND_DN</b>. This value is passed directly to  the
              server,  so  it may be stored encrypted if your server supports this. This value can be overridden
              by the <b>-w</b> command line switch.

       <b>USER_BASE</b> = <u>base_dn</u>
              <u>base_dn</u> is the base dn that users should be added to, search for, deleted from, or modified  from.
              In  general  if you wish to add a user to the following dn: ou=users,o=company,c=us <u>base_dn</u> should
              be set to ou=users,o=company,c=us. If you set this value to o=company,c=us users will be added  to
              that dn, although for searching purposes the scope is more broad.  This value can be overridden at
              the command line with the <b>-U</b> switch.

       <b>GROUP_BASE</b> = <u>base_dn</u>
              <u>base_dn</u> is the base dn that groups should be added to, search for, deleted from, or modified from.
              In  general if you wish to add a group to the following dn: ou=group,o=company,c=us <u>base_dn</u> should
              be set to ou=group,o=company,c=us. If you set this value to o=company,c=us groups will be added to
              that dn, although for searching purposes the scope is more broad.  This value can be overridden at
              the command line with the <b>-B</b> switch.

       <b>USER_OBJECT_CLASS</b> = <u>object_class</u>

       <b>GROUP_OBJECT_CLASS</b> = <u>object_class</u>
              <u>object_class</u> is a comma  separated  list  of  object  classes  that  are  required  by  your  LDAP
              directories schema in order to add or modify users and groups. The default should be fine, consult
              your vendors documentation or contact <u><a href="mailto:cpu-users@lists.sourceforge.net">cpu-users@lists.sourceforge.net</a></u> if you have problems.

       <b>USER_FILTER</b> = <u>filter</u>

       <b>GROUP_FILTER</b> = <u>filter</u>
              <u>filter</u> is a filter that adhears to the following BNF:
                      &lt;filter&gt; ::= '(' &lt;filtercomp&gt; ')'
                      &lt;filtercomp&gt; ::= &lt;and&gt; | &lt;or&gt; | &lt;not&gt; | &lt;simple&gt;
                      &lt;and&gt; ::= '&amp;' &lt;filterlist&gt;
                      &lt;or&gt; ::= '|' &lt;filterlist&gt;
                      &lt;not&gt; ::= '!' &lt;filter&gt;
                      &lt;filterlist&gt; ::= &lt;filter&gt; | &lt;filter&gt; &lt;filterlist&gt;
                      &lt;simple&gt; ::= &lt;attributetype&gt; &lt;filtertype&gt; &lt;attributevalue&gt;
                      &lt;filtertype&gt; ::= '=' | '~=' | '&lt;=' | '&gt;='
              These  filters are utilized to locate users and groups, as well as to aid in finding new uid's and
              gid's.

       <b>USER_CN_STRING</b> = <u>string</u>
              <u>string</u> is used during user creation. It allows you to specify the dn of the user. The  dn  becomes
              string=login,...

       <b>GROUP_CN_STRING</b> = <u>string</u>
              <u>string</u> is used during group creation. It allows you to specify the dn of the group. The dn becomes
              string=groupname,...

       <b>TIMEOUT</b> = <u>timeout</u>
              <u>timeout</u>  should  be  a value in seconds and greater than 0. If unspecified the default is 60. This
              value determines the duration after which an operation should be aborted.

       The following options are still used by the [LDAP] section, but are  more  user  centric  and  less  ldap
       centric.

       <b>SKEL_DIR</b> = <u>dir</u>
              <u>dir</u>  should  be  the path for a directory that files are to be copied from when <b>-m</b> is given at the
              command line. This value can be overridden by the <b>-k</b> command line switch.

       <b>DEFAULT_SHELL</b> = <u>shell</u>
              The default name of the user's login shell. This value can be overridden by the  <b>-s</b>  command  line
              switch.

       <b>HOME_DIRECTORY</b> = <u>directory</u>
              New  users  will be created using <u>directory</u> prepended to the users login name. If this variable is
              undefined, it must be specified at the command line with the <b>-d</b>  switch.  When  specified  at  the
              command line that value is used for the users home directory.

       <b>MAX_UIDNUMBER</b> = <u>integer</u>

       <b>MIN_UIDNUMBER</b> = <u>integer</u>

       <b>MAX_GIDNUMBER</b> = <u>integer</u>

       <b>MIN_GIDNUMBER</b> = <u>integer</u>

       <b>ID_MAX_PASSES</b> = <u>integer</u>
              These  values control gid and uid generation. When a uid is not specified at the command line (for
              a useradd) these values are used for finding the next unused uid (random or linear).  Similar  for
              groupadd. These are pretty self evident. <b>ID_MAX_PASSES</b> is the number of times that a search should
              be performed before giving up.

       <b>RANDOM</b> = <b>true</b> <b>or</b> <b>false</b>
              If <b>RANDOM</b> is <u>true</u>, then a random number will be generated and searched for (this number, if unused
              in  the directory, will be the users uid or a groups gid). If a user or group with that ID exists,
              the process will continue for <b>ID_MAX_PASSES</b>. If <u>true</u>, a linear  scan  will  be  done  starting  at
              <b>MIN_UIDNUMBER</b>  (or GIDNUMBER) and will not stop until an unused ID is found or the number of scans
              is equal to <b>ID_MAX_PASSES</b>. If random is false, only one query is done on the directory, but it may
              still be a bit slower then setting random to true in some cases.

       <b>USERGROUPS</b> =  <b>yes</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b>
              The <b>USERGROUPS</b> can be either yes or no. If yes, each created user will be given their own group to
              use as a default. If no, each created user will be placed in the group whose gid is USER_GID.

       <b>USERS_GID</b> =  <b>integer</b>
              If <b>USERGROUPS</b> is no, then <b>USERS_GID</b> should be the GID of the  group  ´users´  (or  the  equivalent
              group) on your system. If this is unspecified, the default is 100.

       <b>GECOS</b> = <b>string</b>
              The default value for a user's gecos field. This can be overridden at the command line with the <b>-c</b>
              switch.

       <b>PASSWORD_FILE</b> = <b>file</b>
              The  value should be a Unix style, passwd formatted file. In order to use this value the <b>-F</b> switch
              must be used at the command line. This value can be empty if  a  file  is  provided  with  the  <b>-F</b>
              switch. In this case, the users attributes are taken from the file (if the user is found) and used
              in the LDAP entry.

       <b>SHADOW_FILE</b> = <b>file</b>
              The  value should be a Unix style, shadow formatted file. In order to use this value the <b>-S</b> switch
              must be used at the command line. This value can be empty if  a  file  is  provided  with  the  <b>-S</b>
              switch. In this case, the users attributes are taken from the file (if the user is found) and used
              in the LDAP entry (including the password).

       <b>HASH</b> = <b>hash</b>
              <u>hash</u> is a hash of either clear, md5crypt, crypt, sha1, ssha1, md5, or smd5 to be used when hashing
              user  passwords. This is largely implementation dependent but all are supported. If you are taking
              passwords from a standard password file, this should be clear (I think, need  to  check...).  This
              can be overridden at the command line with the <b>-H</b> switch.

       <b>SHADOWLASTCHANGE</b> = <u>integer</u>

       <b>SHADOWMAX</b> = <u>integer</u>

       <b>SHADOWWARING</b> = <u>integer</u>

       <b>SHADOWEXPIRE</b> = <u>integer</u>

       <b>SHADOWFLAG</b> = <u>integer</u>

       <b>SHADOWMIN</b> = <u>integer</u>

       <b>SHADOWINACTIVE</b> = <u>integer</u>
              These  values  are  better  documented  in  <b><a href="../man3/shadow.3.html">shadow</a>(3)</b> and in <b><a href="../man5/shadow.5.html">shadow</a>(5)</b>.  These are not required by
              RFC2307 but are by some ldap authentication implementations. These values can  only  be  specified
              here, or taken from an existing shadow file for the user.

       <b>ADD_SCRIPT</b> = <b>executable</b>

       <b>DEL_SCRIPT</b> = <b>executable</b>
              ADD_SCRIPT  and  DEL_SCRIPT work the same, however ADD_SCRIPT is used only for a useradd operation
              and DEL_SCRIPT is used only for a userdel operation. These can be overridden via the command  line
              switch  -X.  If specified in the configuration file or at the command line, the script is executed
              after a successful useradd or userdel. The first argument to the  script  is  the  login  name  as
              specified at the command line.

</pre><h4><b>PASSWD</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Password  options  should  be  under  the  section  marked  [PASSWD].  These options are only useful when
       <b>DEFAULT_METHOD</b> is set to passwd or when passwd was specified at the command  line  with  the  <b>-M</b>  switch.
       These  options are only used by the passwd module. This module is not yet functional, so I won't document
       the options.
