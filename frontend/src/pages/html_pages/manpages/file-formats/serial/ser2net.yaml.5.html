</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/ser2net/ser2net.yaml - Serial to network proxy configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       ser2net  used to be a program for connection network connections to serial ports.  It's now a program for
       connecting accepter gensio to connecting gensios.  See <a href="../man5/gensio.5.html">gensio</a>(5) for details on gensios.

       ser2net is configured with YAML, which is flexible and easy to use.  Look at yaml  documentation  on  the
       internet for how that works.

       However, there are two types of YAML files that ser2net can use: version 1 and version 2.  Version 1 YAML
       files  have  more capability than version 2 files, but they are non-standard YAML, a standard YAML parser
       cannot read them.  ser2net will autodetect the version based upon what it finds.

       In version 2, you can have multiple documents in a  file  and  ser2net  will  read  all  of  them.   YAML
       separates  documents  in a file with a single "---" by itself at the beginning of a line.  Though you can
       only have one set of defaults, defines, connections, etc. in a document, you can have multiple  documents
       in  a file to allow more than one.  You might, for instance, group all the connections with a certain set
       of defaults into its own document.

</pre><h4><b>DEFINE</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       YAML has the ability to create aliases that can be used elsewhere in the configuration file.   These  can
       be  used  for  tying  things  together between parts of the file, or (as an extension to YAML) for string
       substitution.

       You define an alias in version 1 with the following:

              define: &amp;aliasname alias text

       This will create an alias with the given name.  Then you can use it elsewhere like:

              banner: *aliasname

       and the banner will be "alias text".  Unlike standard YAML, you can also use this inside strings using

              *(aliasname)

       so if you have

              banner: My banner *(aliasname) is here

       The banner will be "My banner alias text is here".   See  the  YAML  documentation  for  how  spaces  are
       handled, but as a note, use quotes if you are not sure, like:

              define: &amp;aliasname "alias text"
              banner: "My banner *(aliasname) is here"

       If you for some reason need "*(" in your text, use "*(*" for that.

       For version 2 YAML files, the definition is:

              defines:
                aliasname: alias text
                aliasname2: alias text 2

       where  you  can  list  as  many aliases as you like.  In version 2, you always refer to an alias with "="
       instead of "*", like:

              banner: "My banner =(aliasname) is here"

       and if you for some reason need "=(" in your text, use "=(=" for that.

       In version 2, per standard YAML, you can only have one defines section, so they must all be together.

</pre><h4><b>INCLUDING</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       A YAML file may include another file at the main level, with:

              include: &lt;filename&gt;

       This filename can include globs, and all referenced files are included.  These must be full  yaml  files,
       but are included in context at this point, with all the defines, connection names, etc.  This can let you
       have individual connections in individual files to ease management.

       In  version  2,  You  can  only have one include in each document for legal YAML, so if you need multiple
       includes you will have to have multiple documents.

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>EXTERNAL</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       You may want to store passwords and such in external files for better security.  For version  1,  putting
       "*{filename}" in a YAML scalar will put the file's contents into the scalar at that point.  If you need a
       "*{" in the string for some reason, use "*{*".

       For version 2, use "={filename}" instead.  And "={=" to include a "={" in a file.

</pre><h4><b>CONNECTION</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b></h4><pre>
       A connection is a structure that describes how to connect an accepting gensio to a connecting gensio.

       An connection specification in version 1 starts with:

              connection: &amp;&lt;alias&gt;
                     &lt;definition&gt;

       In version 2, it's specified as:
              connections:
                     &lt;alias&gt;:
                            &lt;definition&gt;

       In version 2, all the connections must occur together in one place.

       The &lt;definition&gt; of a connection is the same for version 1 and version 2:
              accepter: &lt;accepter&gt;
              timeout: &lt;number&gt;
              enable: on|off
              connector: &lt;connector&gt;
              options:
                     &lt;option name&gt;: &lt;option value&gt;
                     &lt;option name&gt;: &lt;option value&gt;...

       An  &lt;accepter&gt; is an accepting gensio specification.  When ser2net receives a connection on the accepter,
       it attempts to make a connection to the &lt;connector&gt; gensio.  The alias is required, it sets the name that
       is used for the connection in the admin interface and for referencing from rotators.

       If the connection receive no activity in &lt;timeout&gt; seconds, ser2net will close the  connection.   Setting
       &lt;timeout&gt; to zero disables the timeout.  The timeout field is optional and defaults to zero.

       The  connection may be enabled or disabled with the enable.  The enable field is optional and defaults to
       on.  This is useful for temporarily disabling port by setting enable to off and  sending  a  SIGHUP.   If
       there are users connected and you disable a port and send a SIGHUP, the users will be kicked off.

       An  option  is  a  configuration setting that doesn't have anything to do with specific gensios, they are
       controls for ser2net in general.  The option section is optional.

       See <a href="../man5/gensio.5.html">gensio</a>(5) for a lot of information about the specific gensios available.

       To allow a TCP connection to a serial port and ignore modem control, you can do:
              connection: &amp;toS0tcp
                     accepter: tcp,1234
                     connector: serialdev,/dev/ttyS0,local

       Both accepting and connecting gensios stack, so if you want to add telnet with RFC2217 support,  you  can
       do:
              connection: &amp;toS0telnet
                     accepter: telnet(rfc2217),tcp,1234
                     connector: serialdev,/dev/ttyS0,local

       If  you  want  to  accept  a  telnet  over SCTP connection only on IPv6 localhost and connect to a telnet
       connection with SSL over tcp, you can do:
              connection: &amp;tomyhost
                     accepter: telnet,sctp,::1,1234
                     connector: telnet,ssl,tcp,myhost.domain.org,1234

       RFC2217 support only make sense with a serial-capable device as the connector.  Also note  that  IPv6  is
       fully  supported.   Accepters  will  generally  default  to  being  both  IPv4  and IPv6 unless otherwise
       specified.  See <a href="../man5/gensio.5.html">gensio</a>(5) for details.

       And yes, SCTP is supported and is highly recommended if you can use it.  Multi-homing alone is worth it.

       You could create a secure login with telnet RFC2217 support that then connects to an IPMI sol connection.
       Notice how splitting the connector line is done with YAML.
              connection: &amp;authsol
                     accepter: telnet(rfc2217),mux,certauth,ssl,sctp,1234
                     connector: ipmisol,lan -U ipmiusr -P test -p 9001
                                   ipmiserver.domain.org,9600
                     options:
                            banner: My banner

       These are some examples.  For SSL and certauth, I have ignored the authentication configuration, more  on
       that  later.   Using authentication is strongly recommended, it's easy now with gtlssh and if you need to
       use it from a program, it's easy with gensio.  There is even python support.  Adding  support  for  other
       scripting languages shouldn't be too hard.

   <b>SPECIAL</b> <b>STRING</b> <b>HANDLING</b>
       Some  string  values,  like banners, have special formatting for inserting various values.  These are all
       prepended with '\'.  This takes the standard "C" \x characters.

         \a - bell
         \b - backspace
         \f - form feed
         \n - newline
         \r - carriage return
         \t - tab
         \v - vertical tab
         \\ - \
         \? - ?
         \' - '
         \" - "
         \nnn - octal value for nnn
         \xXX - hex value for XX
         \d - The connector string (/dev/ttyS0, etc.)
         \o - The name of the connection.
         \p - Network port number
         \B - The serial port parameters (eg 9600N81) if applicable
         \Y -&gt; year
         \y -&gt; day of the year (days since Jan 1)
         \M -&gt; month (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.)
         \m -&gt; month (as a number)
         \A -&gt; day of the week (Mon, Tue, etc.)
         \D -&gt; day of the month
         \e -&gt; epoc (seconds since Jan 1, 1970)
         \U -&gt; microseconds in the current second
         \p -&gt; local port number
         \I -&gt; remote IP address (in dot format)
         \H -&gt; hour (24-hour time)
         \h -&gt; hour (12-hour time)
         \i -&gt; minute
         \S -&gt; second
         \q -&gt; am/pm
         \P -&gt; AM/PM

       These sequences may be used to make the filename unique per  open  and  identify  which  port/device  the
       filename  was  for.  Note that in filenames when using \d or \o, everything up to and including last / in
       the device name is removed, because you can't have a / in a filename.  So in a filename /dev/ttyS0  would
       become just ttyS0.

       Note  that  in  banners and other strings going out (not filenames) you <b>must</b> use \r\n to send a new line;
       this is raw handling and \n will only go down one line, it will not return to the beginning of the line.

   <b>CONNECTION</b> <b>SPECIFICATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <u>kickolduser:</u> <u>true|false</u> sets the port so that the previous user will be kicked off if a  new  user  comes
       in.  Useful if you forget to log off from someplace else a lot.

       <u>banner:</u>  <u>&lt;banner</u>  <u>string&gt;</u>  displays  the given banner when a client connects.  It uses string handling as
       described in "SPECIAL STRING HANDLING" above.

       <u>signature:</u> <u>&lt;signature</u> <u>string&gt;</u> sends RFC2217 signature on clients request.  This may be an empty string.

       <u>openstr:</u> <u>&lt;openstr</u> <u>name</u> <u>string&gt;</u> Send the given string to the device on first open.  This may be  an  empty
       string.  It uses string handling as described in "SPECIAL STRING HANDLING" above.

       <u>closestr:</u>  <u>&lt;closestr</u>  <u>name&gt;</u>  Send  the  given  string to the device on final close.  This may be an empty
       string.  It uses string handling as described in "SPECIAL STRING HANDLING" above.

       <u>closeon:</u> <u>&lt;closeon</u> <u>string&gt;</u> If the given string is seen coming from the connector side of  the  connection,
       close  the  connection.   The  comparison  here is, for simplicity, simplistic.  Complex expressions with
       repetitive things may not compare correctly.  For instance, if your closeon strings is "ababc"  and  your
       input  strings  is  "abababc", the comparison will fail because the comparison algorithm will see "ababa"
       and will fail on the final "a" and start over at "abc",  which  won't  match.   This  shouldn't  cause  a
       problem most cases, but if it does, contact the authors and it can be improved.

       <u>accepter-retry-time:</u>  <u>&lt;time</u>  <u>in</u>  <u>seconds&gt;</u>  If  the  accepter  does not come up at startup, wait this many
       seconds and retry it.

       <u>connector-retry-time:</u> <u>&lt;time</u> <u>in</u> <u>seconds&gt;</u> On a connect-back port, if the connector does not come up or goes
       down.  wait this many seconds and retry it.

       <u>trace-read:</u> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u> When the acceptor is opened, open the given file and store all data read from  the
       physical  device  (and  thus  written  to  the  client's network/acceptor port) in the file.  If the file
       already exists, it is appended.  The file is closed when the port is closed.  The  filename  uses  string
       handling as described in "SPECIAL STRING HANDLING" above.

       <u>trace-write:</u> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u> Like tr, but traces data written to the connecting gensio.

       <u>trace-both:</u>  <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u> trace both read and written data to the same file.  Note that this is independent
       of tr and tw, so you may be tracing read, write, and both to different files.

       <u>trace-hexdump:</u> <u>true|false</u> turns on/off hexdump output to all trace files.  Each line in  the  trace  file
       will be 8 (or less) bytes in canonical hex+ASCII format.  This is useful for debugging a binary protocol.

       <u>trace-timestamp:</u>  <u>true|false</u> adds/removes a timestamp to all of the trace files. A timestamp is prepended
       to each line if hexdump is active for the trace file.  A timestamped line is also recorded in  the  trace
       file when a remote client connects or disconnects from the port.

       <u>[trace-read-|trace-write-|trace-both-]hexdump:</u>  <u>true|false</u> turns on/off hexdump output for only one trace
       file.  May be combined with hexdump.  Order is important.

       <u>[trace-read-|trace-write-|trace-both-]timestamp:</u> <u>true|false</u> adds/removes a  timestamp  to  only  one  the
       trace files May be combined with [-]timestamp.  Order is important.

       <u>telnet-brk-on-sync:</u>  <u>true|false</u>  causes  a  telnet  sync  operation  to send a break.  By default data is
       flushed until the data mark, but no break is sent.

       <u>chardelay:</u> <u>true|false</u> enables the small wait after each  character  received  on  the  connecting  gensio
       before  sending  data  on the accepted gensio.  Normally ser2net will wait the time it takes to receive 2
       serial port characters, or at least 1000us, before sending.  This allows more efficient  use  of  network
       resources when receiving large amounts of data, but gives reasonable interactivity.  Default is true.

       Note  that  this feature is designed to balance network efficiency and interactivity.  It is not designed
       to give guarantees of minimum chunk of data size, as task scheduling and network stacks can modify  these
       things, too.

       <u>chardelay-scale:</u>  <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>  sets  the  time,  measured in tenths of serial port characters, to wait after
       receiving from nothing from the connection before sending to the accepted gensio.  So setting this to  25
       will  cause  ser2net  to  wait  the  amount  of time it takes to receive 2.5 serial port characters after
       receiving the last character before sending the data on to the TCP port.  The default value is 20, max is
       1000.  This is ignored for non-serial gensios.

       <u>chardelay-min:</u> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u> is the same as chardelay-scale, but in microseconds.  The  larger  of  chardelay-
       scale and chardelay-min is used.  The default value is 1000, max is 100000.

       <u>chardelay-max:</u> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u> sets the maximum delay that ser2net will wait, in microseconds, after receiving a
       character,  before  sending  the  data.   The  default  value  is  20000, max is 1000000.  This keeps the
       connection working smoothly at slow speeds.

       <u>sendon:</u> <u>&lt;sendon</u> <u>string&gt;</u> If the given string is seen coming from the connector  side  of  the  connection,
       sends  buffered  data up to and including the string. Disabled by default. As an example, this can be set
       to \r\n with appropriate chardelay settings to send one line at a  time.   It  uses  string  handling  as
       described  in  "SPECIAL  STRING  HANDLING"  above.   See  the  notes  on the closeon string for important
       information on how the comparison is done.

       <u>dev-to-net-bufsize:</u> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u> sets the size of the buffer reading from the connecting gensio  and  writing
       to the accepted gensio.

       <u>net-to-dev-bufsize:</u>  <u>&lt;number&gt;</u> sets the size of the buffer reading from the accepted gensio and writing to
       the connecting gensio.

       <u>led-tx:</u> <u>&lt;led-alias&gt;</u> use the previously defined led to indicate serial  tx  traffic  on  this  port.   For
       version 2 this should be a YAML alias, like *led2.  For version 2 just use the name, like led2.

       <u>led-rx:</u>  <u>&lt;led-alias&gt;</u>  use  the  previously  defined  led to indicate serial rx traffic on this port.  For
       version 2 this should be a YAML alias, like *led2.  For version 2 just use the name, like led2.

       <u>max-connections:</u> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u> set the maximum number of connections that can be made on this  particular  TCP
       port.   If  you make more than one connection to the same port, each ports output goes to the device, and
       the device output goes to all ports simultaneously.  See "MULTIPLE CONNECTIONS" below for  details.   The
       default is 1.

       <u>remaddr:</u>  <u>&lt;addr&gt;[;&lt;addr&gt;[;...]]</u>   specifies  the allowed remote connections, where the addr is a standard
       address, generally in the form &lt;ip address&gt;,&lt;port&gt;.  Multiple addresses can be separated  by  semicolons,
       and you can specify remaddr more than once.

       If you set the port for an address to zero, ser2net will accept a connection from any port from the given
       network host.

       <u>no-con-to-acc:</u>  <u>true|false</u>  If  true, do not transfer any data from the connector to the accepter.  Throw
       any data received from the connecter away.

       <u>no-acc-to-con:</u> <u>true|false</u> If true, do not transfer any data from the accepter to  the  connecter.   Throw
       any data received from the accepter away.

       <u>connback:</u>  <u>&lt;connector&gt;[;&lt;connector&gt;[;...]]</u>   specifies  reverse  connections  that will be made when data
       comes in on the device.  When data comes in on the device side (the connection's main connector)  ser2net
       will  connect  to  each  connback  specified.   No  connection  is  made  until data comes in, and normal
       connection timeouts apply.

       Note that this will use one of the connection's connections all the time.  You may need to increase  max-
       connections if you need more than one or want to accept incoming connections, too.

       Connect back addresses must match the format of the accepter address.  So, for instance, if your accepter
       is "telnet,tcp,1234" your connect back address must be something like "telnet,tcp,hostname,1123".

       The port will send no data to any connect back unless all the connect backs are connected.

       A connect back port can also have connections made to it if you set the number of connections larger than
       the  number  of  connect  backs specified.  However, those connections will receive no data from the port
       uness all connect backs have been established.

       <u>connback-timeout:</u> <u>&lt;time</u> <u>in</u> <u>seconds&gt;</u> specifies a separate timeout for connect  back  ports.   Normally  it
       uses  the  main  timeout, this lets you have a different one.  Setting it to zero, like the main timeout,
       disables the timeout.

       <u>authdir:</u> <u>&lt;directory</u> <u>string&gt;</u> specified the authentication directory to use for this connection.

       <u>pamauth:</u> <u>&lt;service</u> <u>name&gt;</u> Enables PAM authentication and sets the PAM service name.

       <u>allowed-users:</u> <u>&lt;space</u> <u>separated</u> <u>list</u> <u>of</u> <u>names&gt;</u> The users that are allowed to use this connections.   This
       has no meaning if authentication is not enabled on the connections.  If this is not set or defaulted, all
       users  are  allowed.   If  this  is set to an empty set of users, then no users are allowed.  This may be
       specified more than once, each one adds more users.

       <u>mdns:</u> <u>true|false</u> Enables/disables mdns support  for  the  connection.   If  you  set  this  and  mdns  is
       available, ser2net will create a service on mdns for the port.

       <u>mdns-interface:</u> <u>&lt;num&gt;</u> Sets the specific network interface to advertise the device.  Defaults to -1, which
       means all network interfaces.

       <u>mdns-nettype:</u> <u>unspec|ipv4|ipv6</u> Sets which network type to provide for the device advertisement.  Defaults
       to unspec, which means do ipv4 and ipv6.

       <u>mdns-name:</u> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u> Sets the name in the mDNS advertisement.  Defaults to the connection name.

       <u>mdns-type:</u>  <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>  Sets the type in the mDNS advertisement.  Defaults to "_iostream._xxx" where xxx is
       either tcp, udp # # or sctp base on the gensio type.

       <u>mdns-domain:</u> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u> Sets the name in the mDNS advertisement.  Defaults to the  system  setting.   Don't
       set this unless you really know what you are doing.

       <u>mdns-host:</u>  <u>&lt;string&gt;</u> Sets the host in the mDNS advertisement.  Defaults to the system setting.  Don't set
       this unless you really know what you are doing.

       <u>mdns-txt:</u> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u> Adds a text string to the mDNS advertisement.   The  string  should  be  in  the  form
       "name=value".   You  can put anything you want in the strings.  Two default strings are added by ser2net:
       "provider=ser2net"   and   "gensiostack=..."   where   the   stack   of   gensios    is    added,    like
       "telnet(rfc2217),tcp)".  The idea of gensiostack is you can just tack on the address to the end an make a
       connection using str_to_gensio().

       <u>mdns-sysattrs:</u> <u>true|false</u> On Linux adds system attributes from sysfs for USB serial ports to the mDNS txt
       fields.   If  the  serial  port  is USB, it adds "devicetype=serialusb" and the following attributes from
       sysfs: bInterfaceNumber, interface, idProduct, idVendor, serial, manufacturer, product.  If they are  not
       present in sysfs, they are not added.  If the serial port is not USB, then "devicetype=serial" is added.

       Note:   Be  *very*  careful  when  using  a  gensiostack  with  str_to_gensio().   Just  blindly  calling
       str_to_gensio() with it could result in significant security issues, as it can pass  pty,  stdio,  trace,
       etc.  gensios  in  it.   You  must  either  validate  that  the  stack  is  a safe set or just use it for
       information.  You have been warned.  Be careful.

</pre><h4><b>ROTATOR</b></h4><pre>
       A rotator allows a single network connection to connect to one of a number of connections.

       A version 1 rotator specification starts with:
              rotator: &amp;&lt;alias&gt;
                     &lt;definition&gt;

       A version 2 rotator specification starts with:

              rotators:
                     &lt;alias&gt;:
                            &lt;definition&gt;

       Just like connections, in version 2 you have to put all the rotators together.

       The definition of a rotator is almost the same between version 1 and version 2:

              accepter: &lt;accepter&gt;
              connections: [
                     &lt;connection alias&gt;,
                     &lt;connection alias&gt;....
              ]
              options:
                     &lt;option name&gt;: &lt;option val&gt;
                     &lt;option name&gt;: &lt;option val&gt;...

       A rotator has four possible options, "authdir", "pamauth",  "allowed-users",  and  "accepter-retry-time",
       both same as connections.

       For version 1, you should use YAML aliases for the connections.  For version 2, just use the alias names.

       Connections  to the accepter will go through the set of connections and find the first unused one and use
       that.  The next connection will start after the last connection used.  Note that disabled connections are
       still accessible through rotators.

       Note that the security of the connection is <b>NOT</b> used, only the security of the rotator.

</pre><h4><b>SER2NET</b> <b>DEFAULTS</b></h4><pre>
       To set a default in version 1, do:
              default:
                     name: &lt;default name&gt;
                     value: &lt;default value&gt;
                     class: &lt;default class&gt;

       In version 2, like other things, the defaults are all in one place in a document, like:
              defaults:
                     &lt;name&gt;:
                            value: &lt;default value&gt;
                            class: &lt;default class&gt;
                     &lt;name2&gt;:
                            value: &lt;default value&gt;
                            class: &lt;default class&gt;

       The class is optional, if it is not there it sets the base default for all classes that  is  used  unelss
       overridden for a specific class.  If the class is there, it sets the default for a specific gensio class.
       There is also a ser2net class that is for ser2net specific options.

       The class is useful if you want different values for different gensio types.  For instance, if you wanted
       all serial ports to run at 9600 baud and all IPMI SOL connections to run at 115200 baud, you could do:
              default:
                     name: speed
                     value: 9600
                     class: serialdev
              default:
                     name: speed
                     value: 115200
                     class: ipmisol

       The  value  is  also optional, if it is not present a string value is set to NULL and an integer value is
       set to 0.

       The order in the file is important, you must set a default before it is used,  and  you  can  change  the
       value of the default.  It will affect all uses following the setting.

       To delete a default value for class (so it will use the base default), for version 1 do:
              delete_default:
                     name: &lt;default name&gt;,
                     class: &lt;default class&gt;

       For version 2, do:
              delete_defaults:
                     &lt;default name&gt;: [ &lt;class1&gt;, &lt;class2&gt;, ... ]
                     &lt;default name2&gt;: [ &lt;class1&gt;, &lt;class2&gt;, ... ]
       and it will delete the defaults for the classes in the list after it.

       You must supply the class, you cannot delete base defaults.

       The following default values are specific to ser2net, given with their default values:

       <b>telnet-brk-on-sync:</b> <b>false</b>
              If  a  telnet  sync is received, send a break on the connected gensio (if applicable).  By default
              data is flushed until the data mark, but no break is sent.

       <b>kickolduser:</b> <b>false</b>
              If a new user comes in on a connection that already has a user, kick off the previous user.

       <b>chardelay:</b> <b>true</b>
              Enable asmall wait after each character received on the serial port before sending data on the TCP
              port.  Normally ser2net will wait the time it takes to receive 2 serial  port  characters,  or  at
              least 1000us, before sending on the TCP port.  This allows more efficient use of network resources
              when receiving large amounts of data, but gives reasonable interactivity.

       <b>chardelay-scale:</b> <b>20</b>
              sets  the number of serial port characters, in tenths of a character, to wait after receiving from
              the serial port and sending to the TCP port.  So setting this to 25 will cause ser2net to wait the
              amount of time it takes to receive 2.5 serial port characters before sending the data  on  to  the
              TCP port.  This can range from 1-1000.

       <b>chardelay-min:</b> <b>1000</b>
              sets the minimum delay that ser2net will wait, in microseconds.  If the calculation for chardelay-
              scale  results in a value smaller than this number, this number will be used instead.  The default
              value is 1000.  This can range from 1-100000.

       <b>net-to-dev-bufsize:</b> <b>64</b>
              sets the size of the buffer reading from the network port and writing to the serial device.

       <b>dev-to-net-bufsize:</b> <b>64</b>
              sets the size of the buffer reading from the serial device and writing to the network port.

       <b>max-connections:</b> <b>1</b>
              set the maximum number of connections that can be made on this particular TCP port.  If  you  make
              more  than  one  connection to the same port, each ports output goes to the device, and the device
              output goes to all ports simultaneously.  See "MULTIPLE CONNECTIONS" below.  for details.

       <b>remaddr:</b> <b>[!]&lt;addr&gt;[;[!]&lt;addr&gt;[;...]]</b>
              specifies the allowed remote connections, where the addr is a standard address in  the  form  (see
              "network  port"  above).   Multiple  addresses can be separated by semicolons, and you can specify
              remaddr more than once.  If you set the port for  an  address  to  zero,  ser2net  will  accept  a
              connection  from  any port from the given network host.  If a "!" is given at the beginning of the
              address, the address is a "connect back" address.  If a connect back address is specified, one  of
              the  network  connections (see max-connections) is reserved for that address.  If data comes in on
              the device, ser2net will attempt to connect to the address.  This works on TCP and UDP.

       <b>authdir:</b> <b>/usr/share/ser2net/auth</b>
              The authentication directory for ser2net.  The AUTHENTICATION for more details.

       <b>authdir-admin:</b> <b>/etc/ser2net/auth</b>
              The authentication directory for ser2net for admin connections.  The "ADMIN_CONNECTIONS" for  more
              details.

       <b>pamauth:</b> <b>&lt;NULL&gt;</b>
              The PAM service name for ser2net PAM authentication (&lt;NULL&gt; for disabled).

       <b>pamauth-admin:</b> <b>&lt;NULL&gt;</b>
              The  PAM  service  name for ser2net admin connection PAM authentication (&lt;NULL&gt; for disabled). See
              "ADMIN_CONNECTIONS" for more details.

       <b>mdns-interface:</b> <b>-1</b>
              The default mDNS interface.

       <b>mdns-type:</b> <b>&lt;NULL&gt;</b>
              The default mDNS type.

       <b>mdns-domain:</b> <b>&lt;NULL&gt;</b>
              The default mDNS domain.

       <b>mdns-host:</b> <b>&lt;NULL&gt;</b>
              The default mDNS host.

</pre><h4><b>ADMIN</b> <b>CONNECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       There is an admin accepter that you can define for ser2net, it lets you  log  in,  look  at  status,  and
       change some things.  See "ADMIN INTERFACE" in <a href="../man8/ser2net.8.html">ser2net</a>(8) for detail on how to use it.  The format is:
              admin: [&amp;&lt;name&gt;]
                     accepter: &lt;accepter&gt;
                     options:
                            &lt;option name&gt;: &lt;option value&gt;
                            &lt;option name&gt;: &lt;option value&gt;...

       The  following  authentications  options  available  are  "authdir-admin",  which sets the authentication
       directory for the admin port and "pamauth-admin"  which  sets  the  PAM  service  name  and  enables  PAM
       authentication. Both are different than "authdir" resp.  "pamauth" for connections, though you can set it
       to the same value.

       In  addition,  the  same mdns option are available for admin ports as are available for connections.  And
       you can set an optional alias that will also set the mdna name.

       Like connections, default mdns options work for "mdns-interface", "mdna-type", "mdns-domain", and  "mdns-
       host".   Unlike connections, the "mdns" boolean does not come from the default, you must specify it as an
       admin option to turn on mdns for the admin port.  This is to allow it  to  be  specified  separately  and
       maintain backwards compatibility.

</pre><h4><b>LEDS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>ser2net</b> can flash LEDs during serial activity.  To create an LED in version 1, do:
              led: &amp;&lt;alias&gt;
                     driver: sysfs
                     options:
                            &lt;option name&gt;: &lt;option value&gt;
                            &lt;option name&gt;: &lt;option value&gt;

       In version 2, use:
              leds:
                     &lt;alias&gt;:
                            driver: sysfs
                            options:
                                   &lt;option name&gt;: &lt;option value&gt;
                                   &lt;option name&gt;: &lt;option value&gt;
                     &lt;alias&gt;:
                            driver: sysfs
                            options:
                                   &lt;option name&gt;: &lt;option value&gt;
                                   &lt;option name&gt;: &lt;option value&gt;

       The only supported driver is sysfs.  Supported options are:

       <u>device:</u>  <u>&lt;sysfs</u>  <u>device</u>  <u>name&gt;</u>  gives the name of the LED in /sys/class/led.  These generally have ":" in
       them, so you will need to put the name in quotes.  This is required.

       <u>duration:</u> <u>&lt;time</u> <u>in</u> <u>ms&gt;</u> The time in milliseconds to flash the LED.  Defaults to 10.

       <u>state:</u> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u> The value to set the LED to to enable it.  Defaults to 1, but may need to be a  different
       value.

       You  reference  the  LED by alias in the connection options section, see that for details.  Make sure you
       have "modprobe ledtrig-transient" done or the triggers will not work, they require the transient trigger.

       You also probably need root access to access LED settings.

</pre><h4><b>FILENAME,</b> <b>BANNER,</b> <b>AND</b> <b>STRING</b> <b>FORMATTING</b></h4><pre>
       NOTE: yaml has it's own quoting mechanism, see below for more details.

       Filenames, banners, open/close strings, closeon strings, and sendon strings may contain normal "C" escape
       sequences and a large number of other escape sequences, too:

         \a - bell
         \b - backspace
         \f - form feed
         \n - newline
         \r - carriage return
         \t - tab
         \v - vertical tab
         \\ - \
         \? - ?
         \' - '
         \" - "
         \nnn - octal value for nnn
         \xXX - hex value for XX
         \d - The connecting gensio string (serialdev,/dev/ttyS0, etc.)
         \o - The device as specified on the config line (before DEVICE substitution)
         \N - The port name
         \p - The accepter string
         \B - The serial port parameters (eg 9600N81)
         \Y -&gt; year
         \y -&gt; day of the year (days since Jan 1)
         \M -&gt; month (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.)
         \m -&gt; month (as a number)
         \A -&gt; day of the week (Mon, Tue, etc.)
         \D -&gt; day of the month
         \e -&gt; epoc (seconds since Jan 1, 1970)
         \U -&gt; microseconds in the current second
         \p -&gt; local port number
         \I -&gt; remote address of the accepter gensio
         \H -&gt; hour (24-hour time)
         \h -&gt; hour (12-hour time)
         \i -&gt; minute
         \S -&gt; second
         \q -&gt; am/pm
         \P -&gt; AM/PM

       In addition, for backwards compatibility because filenames and banners used to have different formatting,
       \s is the serial port parameters if in a banner and seconds if in a filename.  Use of this is discouraged
       as it may change in the future.

       These sequences may be used to make the filename unique per  open  and  identify  which  port/device  the
       filename  was  for.  Note that in filenames when using \d or \o, everything up to and including last / in
       the device name is removed, because you can't have a / in a filename.  So in a filename /dev/ttyS0  would
       become just ttyS0.

   <b>HANDLING</b> <b>QUOTING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>STRING</b> <b>FORMATTING</b>
       yaml  will process "\" escape sequences in double quotes, so use of double quotes is note recommended for
       the above.  If you put the values in single quotes, yaml will not process  them  and  instead  pass  them
       through where they can be processed by ser2net.

</pre><h4><b>SPACES,</b> <b>QUOTING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>PUTTING</b> <b>SPACES</b> <b>IN</b> <b>STRINGS</b></h4><pre>
       YAML  and the accepter/connector processing interact when dealing with quoting.  By default, YAML ignores
       the number of spaces between elements separated by spaces.  Lines that are indented after an element  are
       considered a continuation of the element, so something like:
              connector: serialdev,/dev/ttyUSB0,
                     9600n81
                     local nobreak
                     rtscts
       is the same as

              connector: serialdev,/dev/ttyUSB0, 9600n81 local nobreak rtscts

       YAML has it's own standard quoting mechanisms, so if you do:

              connector: "serialdev,/dev/ttyUSB0,9600n81  local"

       the  two  spaces before "local" will be preserved when passed to the connector processing (though in this
       case it won't matter because the connector processing will ignore the extra spaces).

       If you need a significant space, say in a filename passed to a key, You cannot do:

              accepter: ssl(CA=/etc/ser2net/my CA/),tcp,3000

       because the accepter processing will split the arguments at the space and won't recognize what "CA/"  is.
       You also cannot do:

              accepter: ssl(CA="/etc/ser2net/my CA/"),tcp,3000

       because YAML will remove the quotes, this is functionally equivalent to the previous example. And

              accepter: ssl(CA="/etc/ser2net/my\ CA/"),tcp,3000

       also  will  not  work,  inside  of double quotes YAML will convert "\ " to a space.  You have a couple of
       options.  You can do:

              accepter: ssl(CA=/etc/ser2net/my\ CA/),tcp,3000

       or

              accepter: ssl(CA='/etc/ser2net/my\ CA/'),tcp,3000

       because outside of quotes YAML will not process the "\ " and it will not process it in single quotes.  Or
       if you have a lot of spaces or colons, too, you can do:

              accepter: ssl(CA="\"/etc/ser2net/my CA/\""),tcp,3000

       because inside the outside quotes YAML will convert the '\"' into a '"' and pass it on  to  the  accepter
       processing which will interpret the quotes as you would expect.

</pre><h4><b>UDP</b></h4><pre>
       UDP  handling  is  a bit different than you might imagine, because it's hard for ser2net to know where to
       send the data to.  To handle this, UDP ports still have the concept of a "connection".  If a UDP port  is
       not  connected,  then if it receives a packet the remote address for that packet is set to the remote end
       of the "connection".  It will do all the normal new  connection  operations.   ser2net  will  accept  new
       connections up to "max-connections" then ignore packets from other addresses until a disconnect occurs.

       Unfortunately, there is no easy way to know when to disconnect.  You have two basic options:

       •      Set  a  timeout,  if  the  remote  end  isn't  heard  from  before  the  timeout, then the port is
              disconnected and something else can connect.  This means anything that  is  using  the  port  must
              periodically send a packet (empty is fine) to ser2net to keep the connection alive.

       •      Use the kickolduser option on the port, any new connection that comes in will replace the previous
              connection.

       Note  that  UDP  ports  handle  multiple  connections  just  like TCP ports, so you can have multiple UDP
       listeners.

       You also have a third option.  If you set a remote address (remaddr) with a non-zero port and  a  connect
       back port (see discussion on remote addresses above), ser2net will take one of the connections and assign
       it  to  that  port  permanently.  This is called a fixed remote address.  All the traffic from the device
       will go to that port.  Every fixed remote address on a UDP port has to have a  corresponding  connection,
       so if you have 3 fixed remote addresses, you must have at least 3 connections.

</pre><h4><b>MULTIPLE</b> <b>CONNECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       As  mentioned  earlier,  you can set <u>max-connections=&lt;n&gt;</u> on a port to allow more than one connection at a
       time to the same serial port.  These connections will share  all  the  settings.   You  cannot  have  two
       separate TCP ports connect to the same port at the same time.

       This has some significant interactions with other features:

       <u>flow</u>  <u>control</u>  is not exactly a feature, but more an interaction between the different connections.  If a
       TCP port stops receiving data from ser2net, all TCP ports connected will be flow-controlled.  This  means
       a single TCP connection can stop all the others.

       <u>closeon</u> will close all connections when the closeon sequence is seen.

       <u>openstr</u> is only sent when the port is unconnected and the first connections is made.

       <u>closestr</u> is only sent when the last port disconnects and there are no more connections to the port.

       Any monitor ("monitor start" from a control connections) will catch input from all network connections.

       <u>kickolduser</u>  will  kick  off an existing connection if a connection comes in on a port that already has a
       maximum number of connections.  The connection kicked off is arbitrarily  chosen  and  the  algorithm  is
       subject to change.

       <u>tracing</u> will trace data from all network connections.

       <u>rfc2217</u>  (remote  telnet  serial  control)  will change the connection settings on the device and will be
       accepted from any network connection.

       <u>reconfig</u> <u>on</u> <u>SIGHUP</u> See <a href="../man8/ser2net.8.html">ser2net</a>(8) "SIGHUP" section for details.

       <u>ROTATOR</u> will only choose a port if there are no connections at all on the port.  Note that the use  of  a
       rotator with a port with max-connections &gt; 1 will result in undefined behavior.

       <u>timeout</u> will be per TCP port and will only disconnect that TCP port on a timeout.

       <u>telnet_brk_on_sync</u> will send a break for any TCP port that does a sync.

       <u>showport</u>  in  the admin interface will show all possible connections, so if you say <u>max-connections=3</u> you
       will get three entries.

       <u>showshortport</u> in the admin interface will only show the first live connection, or  if  no  connection  is
       present it will show whatever the first one was the last time a connection was present.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHENTICATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ENCRYPTION</b></h4><pre>
   <b>TCP</b> <b>WRAPPERS</b>
       ser2net  uses  the  tcp  wrappers  interface to implement host-based security.  See <a href="../man5/hosts_access.5.html">hosts_access</a>(5) for a
       description of the file setup.  Two daemons are used by ser2net, "ser2net" is  for  the  data  ports  and
       "ser2net-control" is for the control ports.

   <b>ENCRYPTION</b>
       ser2net supports SSL encryption using the ssl gensio.  To enable encryption, use an accepter like:

              telnet,ssl,tcp,1234

       Then you can use gensiot to connect:

              gensiot telnet,ssl,&lt;server&gt;,1234

       or you can install telnet-ssl and do

              telnet -z ssl,secure &lt;server&gt; 1234

       The  SSL  connection  is made using the provided keys.  In this example ser2net uses the default keys (as
       set in the default, see those below).  You can also set them using (key=&lt;keyfile&gt;,cert=&lt;certfile&gt;)  after
       ssl above, or modify the defaults.

       If  you  do  not  have genuine certificates from a certificate authority, the connection will fail due to
       certificate failure.  Getting certificates this way is very inconvenient, so there is another  way.   You
       can do:

              gtlssh-keygen --keydir /etc/ser2net --commonname "`hostname`-ser2net" serverkey ser2net

       to  generate  the  default  keys  in  /etc/ser2net  (or  wherever).   The  certificate/key  will be named
       /etc/ser2net/ser2net.crt|key.

       <b>NOTE:</b> If you compile ser2net yourself, by  default  autoconf  sets  the  system  configuration  directory
       (normally  <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>)  as  /usr/etc.  This is a major annoyance with autoconf.  So if you don't change it, you
       would need /usr/etc above where it says /etc.  However, generally the right way to  do  this  is  to  add
       "--sysconfdir=<a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>"  to  the configure command line when you configure ser2net.  If a distro has compiled
       ser2net for you, that should have done that by default, so no worries in that case.

       Then copy ser2net.crt over to the user system and provide it to connection commands, like:

              gensiot telnet,ssl(CA=ser2net.crt),&lt;server&gt;,1234

       or

              telnet -z ssl,secure,cacert=ser2net.crt 1234

       Then you will have an encrypted connection.  Just make sure your certificates are valid.

       Note that the "-ser2net" at the end of the key is important because it  make  the  subject  name  of  the
       certificate more unique.  You can really put anything you want for what you provide to keygen, as long as
       you rename it properly.  That will be the subject name of the certificate.

   <b>AUTHENTICATION</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>SSL</b>
       ser2net  provides  a  way  to  authenticate with SSL.  It's not the greatest, but it does work.  You must
       enable clientauth on ssl:

              telnet,ssl(clientauth),tcp,1234

       or set it in the default.  Then you must create a certificate with the username as the common name.   You
       can do this with:

              gtlssh-keygen --keydir outdir --commonname username keygen keyname

       which  will  generate  keyname.crt  and  keyname.key  in  outdir.   Then  put  keyname.crt  in  ser2net's
       &lt;authdir&gt;/username/allowed_certs.  By default &lt;authdir&gt; is /usr/share/ser2net/auth, but  you  can  change
       that  with the authdir default in the ser2net config file or by setting authdir on individual connections
       (in case you want different ones for different ports).  You then must rehash the allowed_certs directory:

              gtlssh-keygen rehash &lt;authdir&gt;/username/allowed_certs

       Then restart/reload ser2net and use one of these very long lines to telnet into it:

              gensiot telnet,ssl(CA=ser2net.crt,cert=username.crt,key=username.key),&lt;server&gt;,1234

              telnet -z ssl,secure,cacert=ser2net.crt,cert=username.crt,key=username.key server 1234

   <b>AUTHENTICATION</b> <b>WITH</b> <b>CERTAUTH</b> <b>(GTLSSH)</b>
       All of the above is a big pain.  Fortunately there is an easier way.  gtlssh is a ssh-like  program,  but
       runs over TLS and it implements a ssh-like authentication protocol using the certauth gensio.

       ser2net  supports  this  authentication  system  running  on  top of the ssl and certauth gensios.  Those
       gensios provide the framework for handling authentication, ser2net itself controls it.

       This uses the same authdir and allowed keys directory as before, and still requires a server certificate,
       but the self-signed one generated with gtlssh-keygen works fine  without  doing  anything  special.   Add
       certauth to the port line:

              telnet,mux,certauth,ssl,tcp,1234

       and  *make  sure*  clientauth is disabled for ssl (or ssl will still attempt to authenticate the client).
       Disabled is the default but in case you changed, the default...

       The mux entry is because gtlssh uses the mux gensio to allow multiple channels on the same  session.   It
       wasn't  there  with  older (pre 1.2) version of gtlssh, but is required for newer one.  gtlssh also has a
       <b>--nomux</b> option, just in case.

       The gtlssh program does its own certificate handling.  Look at the gtlssh man page for  detail  on  that.
       Take the certificate for gtlssh and put it in the authdir/username/allowed_certs directory and reshash it
       as  before.   gtlssh  will  *not*  use  the  common  name provided in the certificate, instead it users a
       username provided by gtlssh.  Then connect with gtlssh:

              gtlssh --nosctp --telnet username@server 1234

       The --nosctp thing keep gtlssh from trying sctp, which will fail because we put tcp  in  the  port  line.
       You  could use sctp there and get all its advantages for free!  Then --nosctp would no longer be required
       to avoid the nagging.

       The username is optional if it's the same as your current user.   If  you  have  not  connected  to  that
       server/port  before,  gtlssh will ask you to verify it, much like ssh does.  If certificates, IP address,
       etc. change, gtlssh will tell you about it.

       If you do not want to use a certificate (certificates are certainly preferred,  but  may  not  always  be
       workable)  you can use a password login, too. You must set enable-password in the certauth gensio options
       for passwords to work.  When you connect with gtlssh, if certificate validate fails, you will be prompted
       for the password. Password authentication can be performed in two  different  ways.   Both  are  mutually
       exclusive,  depending on whether pamauth is set or not:

       •      To authenticate using the PAM library set the PAM service name via pamauth option.

       •      Put a password in authdir/username/password. If it matches the first line in the password file and
              pamauth is not set, then authentication will succeed.

   <b>AUTHENTICATION</b> <b>AND</b> <b>ROTATORS</b>
       Rotators  are  a  special  case.   BE  CAREFUL.   A  rotator  has  its own authentication.  If you set up
       authentication on a port that is part of a rotator, that port's authentication is  not  used.   Only  the
       rotator's authentication is used.

   <b>ENCRYPTION,</b> <b>AUTHENTICATION,</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DEFAULT</b> <b>CERTIFICATES</b>
       <b>ser2net</b>  expects  default  certificates  and  public  keys  in  /etc/ser2net, and these are set as gensio
       defaults.  This means that any outgoing connection from ser2net, whether in a connector or in a connback,
       will use these keys.  If they aren't there or have expired or something you  will  get  confusing  errors
       about not being able to open the certificates.

       To solve this, you can disable the certificates by adding "cert=" to the gensio specification for ssl and
       certauth  on  outgoing  connections.   This will disable the certificates for the specific gensio, and is
       probably what you want.  If you are making connections and  authenticating  to  the  remote  server,  the
       default certificate and private key are probably not what you want, either.

</pre><h4><b>SIGNALS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SIGHUP</b>
            If ser2net receives a SIGHUP, it will reread it configuration file and make the appropriate changes.
            If  an  inuse  port  is  changed  or  deleted,  the  actual  change will not occur until the port is
            disconnected.

</pre><h4><b>ERRORS</b></h4><pre>
       Almost all error output goes to syslog, not standard output.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
