       nix.conf - Nix configuration file

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       Nix  supports  a  variety  of configuration settings, which are read from configuration files or taken as
       command line flags.

   <b>Configuration</b> <b>file</b>
       By default Nix reads settings from the following places, in that order:

       1. The system-wide configuration file sysconfdir/nix/nix.conf (i.e. /etc/nix/nix.conf on  most  systems),
          or $NIX_CONF_DIR/nix.conf if NIX_CONF_DIR is set.

          Values  loaded  in  this file are not forwarded to the Nix daemon.  The client assumes that the daemon
          has already loaded them.

       2. If NIX_USER_CONF_FILES is set, then each path separated by : will be loaded in reverse order.

          Otherwise it will look for nix/nix.conf files  in  XDG_CONFIG_DIRS  and  XDG_CONFIG_HOME.   If  unset,
          XDG_CONFIG_DIRS  defaults  to  <a href="file:/etc/xdg">/etc/xdg</a>, and XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to $HOME/.config as per XDG Base
          Directory Specification.

       3. If NIX_CONFIG is set, its contents are treated as the contents of a configuration file.

   <b>File</b> <b>format</b>
       Configuration files consist of name = value pairs, one per line.  Comments start with a # character.

       Example:

       keep-outputs = true       # Nice for developers
       keep-derivations = true   # Idem

       Other files can be included with a line like include &lt;path&gt;, where &lt;path&gt; is interpreted relative to  the
       current configuration file.  A missing file is an error unless !include is used instead.

       A  configuration setting usually overrides any previous value.  However, for settings that take a list of
       items, you can prefix the name of the setting by extra- to <u>append</u> to the previous value.

       For instance,

       substituters = a b
       extra-substituters = c d

       defines the substituters setting to be a b c d.

       Unknown option names are not an error, and are simply ignored with a warning.

   <b>Command</b> <b>line</b> <b>flags</b>
       Configuration options can be set on the command line, overriding the  values  set  in  the  configuration
       file:

       •  Every  configuration  setting  has  corresponding  command  line  flag  (e.g. --max-jobs 16).  Boolean
          settings do not need an argument, and can be explicitly disabled with the  no-  prefix  (e.g.  --keep-
          failed and --no-keep-failed).

          Unknown  option  names  are  invalid  flags  (unless  there is already a flag with that name), and are
          rejected with an error.

       •  The flag --option &lt;name&gt; &lt;value&gt; is interpreted exactly like a &lt;name&gt; = &lt;value&gt; in a setting file.

          Unknown option names are ignored with a warning.

       The extra- prefix is supported for settings that take a list of items (e.g. --extra-trusted  users  alice
       or --option extra-trusted-users alice).

   <b>Integer</b> <b>settings</b>
       Settings that have an integer type support the suffixes K, M, G and T. These cause the specified value to
       be  multiplied  by  2^10, 2^20, 2^30 and 2^40, respectively. For instance, --min-free 1M is equivalent to
       --min-free 1048576.

</pre><h4><b>Available</b> <b>settings</b></h4><pre>
       •  abort-on-warn

          If set to true, builtins.warn will throw an error when logging a warning.

          This will give you a stack trace that leads to the location of the warning.

          This is useful for finding information about warnings in third-party Nix code when you can  not  start
          the  interactive  debugger, such as when Nix is called from a non-interactive script. See debugger-on-
          warn.

          Currently, a stack trace can only be produced when the debugger is  enabled,  or  when  evaluation  is
          aborted.

          This option can be enabled by setting NIX_ABORT_ON_WARN=1 in the environment.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  accept-flake-config

                 <b>Warning</b>

                 This setting is part of an experimental feature.

                 To  change  this  setting,  make sure the flakes experimental feature is enabled.  For example,
                 include the following in nix.conf:

          extra-experimental-features = flakes
          accept-flake-config = ...

          Whether to accept Nix configuration settings from a flake without prompting.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  access-tokens

          Access tokens used to access protected  GitHub,  GitLab,  or  other  locations  requiring  token-based
          authentication.

          Access  tokens  are  specified as a string made up of space-separated host=token values.  The specific
          token used is selected by matching the host portion against the “host” specification of the input. The
          actual use of the token value is determined by the type of resource being accessed:

          •  Github: the token value is the OAUTH-TOKEN string obtained as the Personal Access  Token  from  the
             Github   server   (see  https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-
             oauth-apps).

          •  Gitlab: the token value is either the  OAuth2  token  or  the  Personal  Access  Token  (these  are
             different              types             tokens             for             gitlab,             see
             https://docs.gitlab.com/12.10/ee/api/README.html#authentication).   The  token  value   should   be
             type:tokenstring  where  type  is  either  OAuth2  or  PAT to indicate which type of token is being
             specified.

          Example <a href="file:~/.config/nix/nix.conf">~/.config/nix/nix.conf</a>:

       access-tokens = github.com=23ac...b289 gitlab.mycompany.com=PAT:A123Bp_Cd..EfG gitlab.com=OAuth2:1jklw3jk

              Example <a href="file:~/code/flake.nix">~/code/flake.nix</a>:

       input.foo = {
       type = "gitlab";
       host = "gitlab.mycompany.com";
       owner = "mycompany";
       repo = "pro";
       };

              This example specifies three tokens, one each for accessing github.com, gitlab.mycompany.com,  and
              gitlab.com.

              The input.foo uses the “gitlab” fetcher, which might requires specifying the token type along with
              the token value.

              <b>Default:</b> <u>empty</u>

       •  allow-dirty

          Whether to allow dirty Git/Mercurial trees.

          <b>Default:</b> true

       •  allow-dirty-locks

                 <b>Warning</b>

                 This setting is part of an experimental feature.

                 To  change  this  setting,  make sure the flakes experimental feature is enabled.  For example,
                 include the following in nix.conf:

          extra-experimental-features = flakes
          allow-dirty-locks = ...

          Whether to allow dirty inputs (such as dirty Git workdirs) to be locked via their NAR  hash.  This  is
          generally  bad  practice since Nix has no way to obtain such inputs if they are subsequently modified.
          Therefore lock files with dirty locks should generally only be used for local testing, and should  not
          be pushed to other users.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  allow-import-from-derivation

          By default, Nix allows Import from Derivation.

          With  this  option  set to false, Nix will throw an error when evaluating an expression that uses this
          feature, even when the required store object is readily available.  This ensures that evaluation  will
          not require any builds to take place, regardless of the state of the store.

          <b>Default:</b> true

       •  allow-new-privileges

          (Linux-specific.) By default, builders on Linux cannot acquire new privileges by calling setuid/setgid
          programs  or  programs  that  have  file capabilities. For example, programs such as sudo or ping will
          fail. (Note that in sandbox builds, no such programs are available unless you bind-mount them into the
          sandbox via the sandbox-paths option.) You can allow the use of such programs by enabling this option.
          This is impure and usually undesirable, but may be useful  in  certain  scenarios  (e.g.  to  spin  up
          containers or set up userspace network interfaces in tests).

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  allow-symlinked-store

          If  set  to  true,  Nix  will  stop complaining if the store directory (typically /nix/store) contains
          symlink components.

          This risks making some builds “impure” because builders sometimes “canonicalise”  paths  by  resolving
          all  symlink components. Problems occur if those builds are then deployed to machines where /nix/store
          resolves to a different location from that of the build machine. You can enable this  setting  if  you
          are sure you’re not going to do that.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  allow-unsafe-native-code-during-evaluation

          Enable built-in functions that allow executing native code.

          In particular, this adds:

          •  builtins.importNative <u>path</u> <u>symbol</u>

          Opens  dynamic shared object (DSO) at <u>path</u>, loads the function with the symbol name <u>symbol</u> from it and
          runs it.  The loaded function  must  have  the  following  signature:  cpp  extern  "C"  typedef  void
          (*ValueInitialiser) (EvalState &amp; state, Value &amp; v);

          The Nix C++ API documentation has more details on evaluator internals.

          •  builtins.exec <u>arguments</u>

          Execute  a  program, where <u>arguments</u> are specified as a list of strings, and parse its output as a Nix
          expression.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  allowed-impure-host-deps

          Which prefixes to allow derivations to ask for access to (primarily for Darwin).

          <b>Default:</b> <u>empty</u>

       •  allowed-uris

          A list of URI prefixes to which access is allowed in restricted evaluation mode. For example, when set
          to  https://github.com/NixOS,  builtin  functions   such   as   fetchGit   are   allowed   to   access
          https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf.git.

          Access is granted when

          •  the URI is equal to the prefix,
          •  or the URI is a subpath of the prefix,
          •  or the prefix is a URI scheme ended by a colon : and the URI has the same scheme.

          <b>Default:</b> <u>empty</u>

       •  allowed-users

          A list user names, separated by whitespace.  These users are allowed to connect to the Nix daemon.

          You  can  specify groups by prefixing names with @.  For instance, @wheel means all users in the wheel
          group.  Also, you can allow all users by specifying *.

                 <b>Note</b>

                 Trusted users (set in trusted-users) can always connect to the Nix daemon.

          <b>Default:</b> *

       •  always-allow-substitutes

          If set to true, Nix will ignore the allowSubstitutes attribute in derivations and  always  attempt  to
          use available substituters.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  auto-allocate-uids

                 <b>Warning</b>

                 This setting is part of an experimental feature.

                 To  change this setting, make sure the auto-allocate-uids experimental feature is enabled.  For
                 example, include the following in nix.conf:

          extra-experimental-features = auto-allocate-uids
          auto-allocate-uids = ...

          Whether to select UIDs for builds automatically, instead of using the users in build-users-group.

          UIDs are allocated starting at 872415232 (0x34000000) on Linux and 56930 on macOS.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  auto-optimise-store

          If set to true, Nix automatically detects files  in  the  store  that  have  identical  contents,  and
          replaces  them with hard links to a single copy. This saves disk space. If set to false (the default),
          you can still run nix-store --optimise to get rid of duplicate files.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  bash-prompt

          The bash prompt (PS1) in nix develop shells.

          <b>Default:</b> <u>empty</u>

       •  bash-prompt-prefix

          Prefix prepended to the PS1 environment variable in nix develop shells.

          <b>Default:</b> <u>empty</u>

       •  bash-prompt-suffix

          Suffix appended to the PS1 environment variable in nix develop shells.

          <b>Default:</b> <u>empty</u>

       •  build-dir

          The directory on the host, in which derivations’ temporary build directories are created.

          If not set, Nix will use the system temporary directory indicated by the TMPDIR environment  variable.
          Note that builds are often performed by the Nix daemon, so its TMPDIR is used, and not that of the Nix
          command line interface.

          This is also the location where --keep-failed leaves its files.

          If  Nix  runs  without  sandbox, or if the platform does not support sandboxing with bind mounts (e.g.
          macOS), then the builder’s environment will contain this directory, instead of  the  virtual  location
          sandbox-build-dir.

          <b>Default:</b> ``

       •  build-hook

          The path to the helper program that executes remote builds.

          Nix  communicates with the build hook over stdio using a custom protocol to request builds that cannot
          be performed directly by the Nix daemon.  The default value is the internal Nix binary that implements
          remote building.

                 <b>Important</b>

                 Change this setting only if you really know what you’re doing.

          <b>Default:</b> nix __build-remote

       •  build-poll-interval

          How often (in seconds) to poll for locks.

          <b>Default:</b> 5

       •  build-users-group

          This options specifies the Unix group containing the  Nix  build  user  accounts.  In  multi-user  Nix
          installations,  builds  should  not  be  performed  by the Nix account since that would allow users to
          arbitrarily modify the Nix store and database by supplying specially crafted builders; and they cannot
          be performed by the calling user since that would allow him/her to influence the build result.

          Therefore, if this option is non-empty and specifies a valid group, builds will be performed under the
          user accounts that are a member of the group specified here (as  listed  in  <a href="file:/etc/group">/etc/group</a>).  Those  user
          accounts should not be used for any other purpose!

          Nix  will  never  run  two  builds under the same user account at the same time. This is to prevent an
          obvious security hole: a malicious user writing a Nix expression that modifies the build result  of  a
          legitimate  Nix expression being built by another user. Therefore it is good to have as many Nix build
          user accounts as you can spare.  (Remember: uids are cheap.)

          The build users should have permission to create  files  in  the  Nix  store,  but  not  delete  them.
          Therefore,  /nix/store  should  be  owned  by the Nix account, its group should be the group specified
          here, and its mode should be 1775.

          If the build users group is empty, builds will be performed under the uid of the Nix process (that is,
          the uid of the caller if NIX_REMOTE is empty, the uid under which the Nix daemon runs if NIX_REMOTE is
          daemon). Obviously, this should not be used with a nix daemon accessible to untrusted clients.

          Defaults to nixbld when running as root, <u>empty</u> otherwise.

          <b>Default:</b> <u>machine-specific</u>

       •  builders

          A semicolon- or newline-separated list of build machines.

          In addition to the usual ways of setting configuration options, the value can be read from a  file  by
          prefixing its absolute path with @.

                 <b>Example</b>

                 This is the default setting:

          builders = @/etc/nix/machines

          Each  machine  specification  consists of the following elements, separated by spaces.  Only the first
          element is required.  To leave a field at its default, set it to -.

          1. The URI of the remote store in the format ssh://[username@]hostname.

                    <b>Example</b>

                    ssh://nix@mac

             For backward compatibility, ssh:// may be omitted.   The  hostname  may  be  an  alias  defined  in
             <a href="file:~/.ssh/config.">~/.ssh/config.</a>

          2. A comma-separated list of Nix system types.  If omitted, this defaults to the local platform type.

                    <b>Example</b>

                    aarch64-darwin

             It is possible for a machine to support multiple platform types.

                    <b>Example</b>

                    i686-linux,x86_64-linux

          3. The  SSH  identity  file  to be used to log in to the remote machine.  If omitted, SSH will use its
             regular identities.

                    <b>Example</b>

                    /home/user/.ssh/id_mac

          4. The maximum number of builds that Nix will execute in parallel  on  the  machine.   Typically  this
             should be equal to the number of CPU cores.

          5. The  “speed  factor”, indicating the relative speed of the machine as a positive integer.  If there
             are multiple machines of the right type, Nix will prefer the fastest, taking load into account.

          6. A comma-separated list of supported system features.

             A machine will only be used to  build  a  derivation  if  all  the  features  in  the  derivation’s
             requiredSystemFeatures attribute are supported by that machine.

          7. A comma-separated list of required system features.

             A  machine will only be used to build a derivation if all of the machine’s required features appear
             in the derivation’s requiredSystemFeatures attribute.

          8. The (base64-encoded) public host key of the remote machine.  If omitted, SSH will use  its  regular
             known_hosts file.

             The value for this field can be obtained via base64 -w0.

                 <b>Example</b>

                 Multiple builders specified on the command line:

          --builders 'ssh://mac x86_64-darwin ; ssh://beastie x86_64-freebsd'

                 <b>Example</b>

                 This specifies several machines that can perform i686-linux builds:

          <a href="mailto:nix@scratchy.labs.cs.uu.nl">nix@scratchy.labs.cs.uu.nl</a> i686-linux /home/nix/.ssh/id_scratchy 8 1 kvm
          <a href="mailto:nix@itchy.labs.cs.uu.nl">nix@itchy.labs.cs.uu.nl</a>    i686-linux /home/nix/.ssh/id_scratchy 8 2
          <a href="mailto:nix@poochie.labs.cs.uu.nl">nix@poochie.labs.cs.uu.nl</a>  i686-linux /home/nix/.ssh/id_scratchy 1 2 kvm benchmark

                 However, poochie will only build derivations that have the attribute

          requiredSystemFeatures = [ "benchmark" ];

                 or

          requiredSystemFeatures = [ "benchmark" "kvm" ];

                 itchy  cannot  do  builds that require kvm, but scratchy does support such builds.  For regular
                 builds, itchy will be preferred over scratchy because it has a higher speed factor.

          For Nix to use substituters, the calling user must be in the trusted-users list.

                 <b>Note</b>

                 A build machine must be accessible via SSH and have Nix installed.  nix must  be  available  in
                 $PATH for the user connecting over SSH.

                 <b>Warning</b>

                 If  you  are  building  via  the Nix daemon (default), the Nix daemon user account on the local
                 machine (that is, root)  requires  access  to  a  user  account  on  the  remote  machine  (not
                 necessarily root).

                 If you can’t or don’t want to configure root to be able to access the remote machine, set store
                 to any local store, e.g. by passing --store <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> to the command on the local machine.

          To build only on remote machines and disable local builds, set max-jobs to 0.

          If you want the remote machines to use substituters, set builders-use-substitutes to true.

          <b>Default:</b> <u>machine-specific</u>

       •  builders-use-substitutes

          If set to true, Nix will instruct remote build machines to use their own substituters if available.

          It  means  that  remote  build  hosts  will  fetch  as  many  dependencies  as possible from their own
          substituters (e.g, from cache.nixos.org) instead of waiting for the local machine to upload them  all.
          This  can  drastically  reduce build times if the network connection between the local machine and the
          remote build host is slow.

       •  commit-lock-file-summary

                 <b>Warning</b>

                 This setting is part of an experimental feature.

                 To change this setting, make sure the flakes experimental feature  is  enabled.   For  example,
                 include the following in nix.conf:

          extra-experimental-features = flakes
          commit-lock-file-summary = ...

          The commit summary to use when committing changed flake lock files. If empty, the summary is generated

          If  set  to  true (the default), build logs written to /nix/var/log/nix/drvs will be compressed on the
          fly using bzip2.  Otherwise, they will not be compressed.

       •  connect-timeout

          The timeout (in seconds) for establishing connections in the binary cache substituter. It  corresponds
          to curl’s --connect-timeout option. A value of 0 means no limit.

          <b>Default:</b> 0

       •  cores

          Sets the value of the NIX_BUILD_CORES environment variable in the invocation of the builder executable
          of  a  derivation.   The builder executable can use this variable to control its own maximum amount of
          parallelism.

          For instance, in Nixpkgs, if the attribute enableParallelBuilding for the mkDerivation build helper is
          set to true, it will pass the -j${NIX_BUILD_CORES} flag to GNU Make.

          The value 0 means that the builder should use all available CPU cores in the system.

                 <b>Note</b>

                 The number of parallel local Nix build jobs  is  independently  controlled  with  the  max-jobs

          builtins.break.

          •  builtins.trace
          •  builtins.traceVerbose if trace-verbose is set to true.
          •  builtins.warn

          This is useful for debugging warnings in third-party Nix code.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  debugger-on-warn

          If set to true and  the  --debugger  flag  is  given,  builtins.warn  will  enter  the  debugger  like
          builtins.break.

          This is useful for debugging warnings in third-party Nix code.

          Use   debugger-on-trace  to  also  enter  the  debugger  on  legacy  warnings  that  are  logged  with
          builtins.trace.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  diff-hook

          Absolute path to an executable capable of diffing build results. The hook is executed if run-diff-hook
          is true, and the output of a build is known to not be the  same.  This  program  is  not  executed  to
          determine if two results are the same.

          The  diff  hook  is executed by the same user and group who ran the build. However, the diff hook does
          not have write access to the store path just built.

          The diff hook program receives three parameters:

          1. A path to the previous build’s results

          2. A path to the current build’s results

          3. The path to the build’s derivation

          4. The path to the build’s scratch directory. This directory will exist only if the build was run with
             --keep-failed.

          The stderr and stdout output from the diff hook will not be displayed to the user.  Instead,  it  will
          print to the nix-daemon’s log.

          When  using  the  Nix  daemon, diff-hook must be set in the nix.conf configuration file, and cannot be
          passed at the command line.

       •  download-attempts

          How often Nix will attempt to download a file before giving up.

          <b>Default:</b> 5

       •  download-buffer-size

          The size of Nix’s internal download buffer in bytes during curl transfers. If data  is  not  processed
          quickly  enough  to  exceed the size of this buffer, downloads may stall.  The default is 67108864 (64
          MiB).

          Specify the maximum transfer rate in kilobytes per second you want Nix to use for downloads.

          <b>Default:</b> 0

       •  eval-cache

          Whether to use the flake evaluation cache.  Certain commands won’t have to evaluate when  invoked  for
          the second time with a particular version of a flake.  Intermediate results are not cached.

          <b>Default:</b> true

       •  eval-system

          This  option  defines  builtins.currentSystem  in the Nix language if it is set as a non-empty string.
          Otherwise, if it is defined as the empty string (the default), the value of the  system  configuration
          setting is used instead.

          Unlike  system,  this  setting does not change what kind of derivations can be built locally.  This is
          useful for evaluating Nix code on one system to produce derivations to be built  on  another  type  of
          system.

          <b>Default:</b> <u>empty</u>

       •  experimental-features

          Experimental features that are enabled.

          Example:

       experimental-features = nix-command flakes

              The following experimental features are available:

              {{#include experimental-features-shortlist.md}}

              Experimental features are further documented in the manual.

              <b>Default:</b> <u>empty</u>

       •  extra-platforms

          System types of executables that can be run on this machine.

          Nix  will  only  build  a  given derivation locally when its system attribute equals any of the values
          specified here or in the system option.

          Setting this can be useful to build derivations locally on compatible machines:

          •  i686-linux executables can be run on x86_64-linux machines (set by default)
          •  x86_64-darwin executables can be run on macOS aarch64-darwin with Rosetta 2 (set by  default  where
             applicable)
          •  armv6 and armv5tel executables can be run on armv7
          •  some aarch64 machines can also natively run 32-bit ARM code
          •  qemu-user may be used to support non-native platforms (though this may be slow and buggy)

          Build  systems will usually detect the target platform to be the current physical system and therefore
          produce machine code incompatible with what may be intended in the derivation.  You should design your
          derivation’s builder accordingly and cross-check the results when using this option against  natively-
          built versions of your derivation.

          <b>Default:</b> <u>machine-specific</u>

       •  fallback

          If  set  to  true,  Nix  will  fall back to building from source if a binary substitute fails. This is
          equivalent to the --fallback flag. The default is false.

          <b>Default:</b> false

          <b>Deprecated</b> <b>alias:</b> build-fallback

       •  filter-syscalls

          Whether to prevent certain dangerous system calls, such as creation of setuid/setgid files  or  adding
          ACLs or extended attributes. Only disable this if you’re aware of the security implications.

          <b>Default:</b> true

          Path or URI of the global flake registry.

          When empty, disables the global flake registry.

          <b>Default:</b> https://channels.nixos.org/flake-registry.json

       •  fsync-metadata

          If set to true, changes to the Nix store metadata (in /nix/var/nix/db) are  synchronously  flushed  to
          disk.  This  improves  robustness  in  case of system crashes, but reduces performance. The default is
          true.

          <b>Default:</b> true

       •  fsync-store-paths

          Whether to call fsync() on store paths before registering them, to flush them to disk.  This  improves
          robustness in case of system crashes, but reduces performance. The default is false.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  hashed-mirrors

          A list of web servers used by builtins.fetchurl to obtain files by hash. Given a hash algorithm <u>ha</u> and
          a  base-16  hash <u>h</u>, Nix will try to download the file from <u>hashed-mirror</u>/<u>ha</u>/<u>h</u>. This allows files to be
          downloaded even if they have disappeared from their original  URI.   For  example,  given  an  example
          mirror <a href="http://tarballs.nixos.org/">http://tarballs.nixos.org/</a>, when building the derivation

       builtins.fetchurl {
       url = "https://example.org/foo-1.2.3.tar.xz";

          If set to true, ignore exceptions inside ‘tryEval’ calls when evaluating nix expressions in debug mode
          (using the –debugger flag). By default the debugger will pause on all exceptions.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  ignored-acls

          A  list  of  ACLs  that  should  be  ignored,  normally Nix attempts to remove all ACLs from files and
          directories in the Nix store, but some ACLs like security.selinux or system.nfs4_acl can’t be  removed
          even by root. Therefore it’s best to just ignore them.

                 This setting is part of an experimental feature.

                 To  change this setting, make sure the configurable-impure-env experimental feature is enabled.
                 For example, include the following in nix.conf:

          extra-experimental-features = configurable-impure-env
          impure-env = ...

          A list of items, each in the format of:

          •  name=value: Set environment variable name to value.

          If the  user  is  trusted  (see  trusted-users  option),  when  building  a  fixed-output  derivation,
          environment  variables  set  in  this  option  will  be  passed  to  the builder if they are listed in
          impureEnvVars.

          This option is useful for, e.g., setting https_proxy for fixed-output derivations and in a  multi-user
          Nix installation, or setting private access tokens when fetching a private repository.

          <b>Default:</b> <u>empty</u>

       •  keep-build-log

          If  set  to true (the default), Nix will write the build log of a derivation (i.e. the standard output
          and error of its builder) to the directory /nix/var/log/nix/drvs. The build log can be retrieved using
          the command nix-store -l path.

       •  keep-derivations

          If true (default), the garbage collector will keep the derivations from which non-garbage store  paths
          were  built.  If false, they will be deleted unless explicitly registered as a root (or reachable from
          other roots).

          Keeping derivation around is useful for querying and traceability (e.g., it allows  you  to  ask  with
          what  dependencies or options a store path was built), so by default this option is on. Turn it off to
          save a bit of disk space (or a lot if keep-outputs is also turned on).

          <b>Default:</b> true

          <b>Deprecated</b> <b>alias:</b> gc-keep-derivations

       •  keep-env-derivations

          If false (default), derivations are not stored in Nix user environments. That is, the  derivations  of
          any build-time-only dependencies may be garbage-collected.

          If  true, when you add a Nix derivation to a user environment, the path of the derivation is stored in
          the user environment. Thus, the derivation will not be garbage-collected until  the  user  environment
          generation  is  deleted  (nix-env  --delete-generations). To prevent build-time-only dependencies from
          being collected, you should also turn on keep-outputs.

          The difference between this option and keep-derivations is that this one is “sticky”:  it  applies  to
          any user environment created while this option was enabled, while keep-derivations only applies at the
          moment the garbage collector is run.

          <b>Default:</b> false

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  keep-outputs

          If  true,  the garbage collector will keep the outputs of non-garbage derivations. If false (default),
          outputs will be deleted unless they are GC roots themselves (or reachable from other roots).

          In general, outputs must be registered  as  roots  separately.  However,  even  if  the  output  of  a
          derivation  is registered as a root, the collector will still delete store paths that are used only at
          build time (e.g., the C compiler, or source tarballs downloaded from the network). To prevent it  from

       •  max-build-log-size

          This  option defines the maximum number of bytes that a builder can write to its stdout/stderr. If the
          builder exceeds this limit, it’s killed. A value of 0 (the default) means that there is no limit.

       •  max-free

          When a garbage collection is triggered by the min-free option, it stops as soon as max-free bytes  are

          <b>Default:</b> 9223372036854775807

       •  max-jobs

          Maximum number of jobs that Nix will try to build locally in parallel.

          The  special  value  auto causes Nix to use the number of CPUs in your system.  Use 0 to disable local
          builds and directly use the remote machines specified in builders.  This will not  affect  derivations
          that have preferLocalBuild = true, which are always built locally.

                 <b>Note</b>

                 The  number  of  CPU  cores  to use for each build job is independently determined by the cores
                 setting.

       •  max-silent-time

          This option defines the maximum number of seconds that a builder can go without producing any data  on
          standard  output  or  standard  error.   This is useful (for instance in an automated build system) to
          catch builds that are stuck in an infinite loop, or to catch remote builds that  are  hanging  due  to
          network problems. It can be overridden using the --max-silent-time command line switch.

       •  min-free

          When free disk space in /nix/store drops below min-free  during  a  build,  Nix  performs  a  garbage-
          collection  until max-free bytes are available or there is no more garbage. A value of 0 (the default)
          disables this feature.

          Maximum size of NARs before spilling them to disk.

          <b>Default:</b> 33554432

       •  narinfo-cache-negative-ttl

          The TTL in seconds for negative lookups.  If a store path is queried from a substituter  but  was  not
          found,  there  will  be  a  negative  lookup cached in the local disk cache database for the specified
          duration.

          Set to 0 to force updating the lookup cache.

          To wipe the lookup cache completely:

       $ rm $HOME/.cache/nix/binary-cache-v*.sqlite*
       # rm /root/.cache/nix/binary-cache-v*.sqlite*

              <b>Default:</b> 3600

       •  narinfo-cache-positive-ttl

          The TTL in seconds for positive lookups. If a store path is queried from a substituter, the result  of
          the  query  will  be  cached  in the local disk cache database including some of the NAR metadata. The
          default TTL is a month, setting a shorter TTL for positive lookups can be  useful  for  binary  caches
          that  have  frequent garbage collection, in which case having a more frequent cache invalidation would
          prevent trying to pull  the  path  again  and  failing  with  a  hash  mismatch  if  the  build  isn’t
          reproducible.

          <b>Default:</b> 2592000

       •  netrc-file

          If  set  to an absolute path to a netrc file, Nix will use the HTTP authentication credentials in this
          file  when  trying  to  download  from  a  remote  host   through   HTTP   or   HTTPS.   Defaults   to
          $NIX_CONF_DIR/netrc.

          The netrc file consists of a list of accounts in the following format:

          machine my-machine login my-username password my-password

          For the exact syntax, see the curl documentation.

                 <b>Note</b>

                 This  must  be  an absolute path, and ~ is not resolved. For example, <a href="file:~/.netrc">~/.netrc</a> won’t resolve to
                 your home directory’s .netrc.

          <b>Default:</b> /dummy/netrc

       •  nix-path

          List of search paths to use  for  lookup path  resolution.   This  setting  determines  the  value  of
          builtins.nixPath and can be used with builtins.findFile.

          •  The configuration setting is overridden by the NIX_PATH environment variable.
          •  NIX_PATH is overridden by specifying the setting as the command line flag --nix-path.
          •  Any current value is extended by the -I option or --extra-nix-path.

          If the respective paths are accessible, the default values are:

          •  $HOME/.nix-defexpr/channels

          The user channel link, pointing to the current state of channels for the current user.

          •  nixpkgs=$NIX_STATE_DIR/profiles/per-user/root/channels/nixpkgs

          The current state of the nixpkgs channel for the root user.

          •  $NIX_STATE_DIR/profiles/per-user/root/channels

          The current state of all channels for the root user.

          These  files  are  set  up  by  the  Nix installer.   See NIX_STATE_DIR for details on the environment
          variable.

                 <b>Note</b>

                 If restricted evaluation is enabled, the default value is empty.

                 If pure evaluation is enabled, builtins.nixPath <u>always</u> evaluates to the empty list [ ].

          <b>Default:</b> <u>machine-specific</u>

       •  nix-shell-always-looks-for-shell-nix

          Before Nix 2.24, nix-shell would only look at shell.nix if it was in the working directory -  when  no
          file was specified.

          Since Nix 2.24, nix-shell always looks for a shell.nix, whether that’s in the working directory, or in
          a directory that was passed as an argument.

          You may set this to false to temporarily revert to the behavior of Nix 2.23 and older.

          Using this setting is not recommended.  It will be deprecated and removed.

          <b>Default:</b> true

       •  nix-shell-shebang-arguments-relative-to-script

          Before  Nix  2.24,  relative  file  path expressions in arguments in a nix-shell shebang were resolved
          relative to the working directory.

          Since Nix 2.24, nix-shell resolves these paths in a manner that is  relative  to  the  base directory,
          defined as the script’s directory.

          You may set this to false to temporarily revert to the behavior of Nix 2.23 and older.

          Using this setting is not recommended.  It will be deprecated and removed.

          <b>Default:</b> true

       •  plugin-files

          A  list  of  plugin  files  to  be loaded by Nix. Each of these files will be dlopened by Nix. If they
          contain the symbol nix_plugin_entry(), this symbol will be  called.  Alternatively,  they  can  affect
          execution  through  static initialization. In particular, these plugins may construct static instances
          of   RegisterPrimOp   to   add   new   primops   or   constants   to    the    expression    language,
          RegisterStoreImplementation  to  add new store implementations, RegisterCommand to add new subcommands
          to the nix command, and RegisterSetting to add new nix config settings. See the constructors for those
          types for more details.

          Warning! These APIs are inherently unstable and may change from release to release.

          Since these files are loaded into the same address space as Nix itself, they must be  DSOs  compatible
          with  the  instance  of Nix running at the time (i.e. compiled against the same headers, not linked to
          any incompatible libraries). They should not be linked to any Nix libs  directly,  as  those  will  be
          available already at load time.

          If  an  entry  in  the  list  is  a  directory, all files in the directory are loaded as plugins (non-
          recursively).

          <b>Default:</b> <u>empty</u>

       •  post-build-hook

          Optional. The path to a program to execute after each build.

          This option is only settable in the global nix.conf, or on the command line by trusted users.

          When using the nix-daemon, the daemon executes the hook as root.  If the nix-daemon is  not  involved,
          the hook runs as the user executing the nix-build.

          •  The hook executes after an evaluation-time build.

          •  The hook does not execute on substituted paths.

          •  The hook’s output always goes to the user’s terminal.

          •  If the hook fails, the build succeeds but no further builds execute.

          •  The hook executes synchronously, and blocks other builds from progressing while it runs.

          The  program  executes with no arguments. The program’s environment contains the following environment
          variables:

          •  DRV_PATH The derivation for the built paths.

             Example: /nix/store/5nihn1a7pa8b25l9zafqaqibznlvvp3f-bash-4.4-p23.drv

          •  OUT_PATHS Output paths of the built derivation, separated by a space character.

             Example:                               /nix/store/zf5lbh336mnzf1nlswdn11g4n2m8zh3g-bash-4.4-p23-dev
             /nix/store/rjxwxwv1fpn9wa2x5ssk5phzwlcv4mna-bash-4.4-p23-doc

          <b>Default:</b> <u>empty</u>

       •  pre-build-hook

          If set, the path to a program that can set extra derivation-specific settings for this system. This is
          used  for  settings that can’t be captured by the derivation model itself and are too variable between
          different versions of the same system to be hard-coded into nix.

          The hook is passed the derivation path and, if sandboxes are enabled, the sandbox  directory.  It  can
          then  modify  the  sandbox  and  send  a  series of commands to modify various settings to stdout. The
          currently recognized commands are:

          •  extra-sandbox-paths
             Pass a list of files and directories to be included in the sandbox for this build.  One  entry  per
             line, terminated by an empty line. Entries have the same format as sandbox-paths.

          <b>Default:</b> <u>empty</u>

       •  preallocate-contents

          Whether to preallocate files when writing objects with known size.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  print-missing

          Whether to print what paths need to be built or downloaded.

          <b>Default:</b> true

       •  pure-eval

          Pure  evaluation  mode  ensures  that  the result of Nix expressions is fully determined by explicitly
          declared inputs, and not influenced by external state:

          •  Restrict file system and network access to files specified by cryptographic hash
          •  Disable impure constants:
          •  builtins.currentSystem
          •  builtins.currentTime
          •  builtins.nixPath
          •  builtins.storePath

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  require-drop-supplementary-groups

          Following the principle of least privilege,  Nix  will  attempt  to  drop  supplementary  groups  when
          building with sandboxing.

          However  this  can  fail  under  some  circumstances.   For  example, if the user lacks the CAP_SETGID
          capability.  Search <a href="../man2/setgroups.2.html">setgroups</a>(2) for EPERM to find more detailed information on this.

          If you encounter such a failure, setting this option to false will let you  ignore  it  and  continue.
          But  before  doing  so,  you  should  consider  the  security  implications  carefully.   Not dropping
          supplementary groups means the build sandbox will be less restricted than intended.

          This option defaults to true when the user is  root  (since  root  usually  has  permissions  to  call
          setgroups) and false otherwise.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  require-sigs

          If  set  to  true (the default), any non-content-addressed path added or copied to the Nix store (e.g.
          when substituting from a binary cache) must have a signature by a trusted key. A trusted  key  is  one
          listed in trusted-public-keys, or a public key counterpart to a private key stored in a file listed in
          secret-key-files.

          Set to false to disable signature checking and trust all non-content-addressed paths unconditionally.

          (Content-addressed paths are inherently trustworthy and thus unaffected by this configuration option.)

          <b>Default:</b> true

       •  restrict-eval

          If  set  to true, the Nix evaluator will not allow access to any files outside of builtins.nixPath, or
          to URIs outside of allowed-uris.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  run-diff-hook

          If true, enable the execution of the diff-hook program.

          When using the Nix daemon, run-diff-hook must be set in the nix.conf configuration file, and cannot be
          passed at the command line.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  sandbox

          If set to true, builds will be performed in a <u>sandboxed</u> <u>environment</u>, i.e., they’re isolated  from  the
          normal  file  system  hierarchy  and  will only see their dependencies in the Nix store, the temporary
          build directory, private versions of <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a>, <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a>, <a href="file:/dev/shm">/dev/shm</a> and <a href="file:/dev/pts">/dev/pts</a>  (on  Linux),  and  the  paths
          configured  with  the sandbox-paths option. This is useful to prevent undeclared dependencies on files
          in directories such as /usr/bin. In addition, on Linux, builds run in private PID, mount, network, IPC
          and UTS namespaces to isolate them from other  processes  in  the  system  (except  that  fixed-output
          derivations do not run in private network namespace to ensure they can access the network).

          Currently,  sandboxing  only work on Linux and macOS. The use of a sandbox requires that Nix is run as
          root (so you should use the “build users” feature to perform the actual builds under  different  users
          than root).

          If  this  option  is  set  to  relaxed,  then  fixed-output  derivations and derivations that have the
          __noChroot attribute set to true do not run in sandboxes.

          The default is true on Linux and false on all other platforms.

          <b>Default:</b> true

          <b>Deprecated</b> <b>alias:</b> build-use-chroot, build-use-sandbox

       •  sandbox-build-dir

          <u>Linux</u> <u>only</u>

          The build directory inside the sandbox.

          This directory is backed by build-dir on the host.

          <b>Default:</b> /build

       •  sandbox-dev-shm-size

          <u>Linux</u> <u>only</u>

          This option determines the maximum  size  of  the  tmpfs  filesystem  mounted  on  <a href="file:/dev/shm">/dev/shm</a>  in  Linux
          sandboxes. For the format, see the description of the size option of tmpfs in <a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a>(8). The default is
          50%.

          <b>Default:</b> 50%

       •  sandbox-fallback

          Whether to disable sandboxing when the kernel doesn’t allow it.

          <b>Default:</b> true

       •  sandbox-paths

          A  list  of  paths bind-mounted into Nix sandbox environments. You can use the syntax target=source to
          mount a path in a different location in the sandbox; for instance, <a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>=/nix-bin will mount  the  path
          /nix-bin  as  <a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>  inside  the sandbox. If <u>source</u> is followed by ?, then it is not an error if <u>source</u>
          does not exist; for example, /dev/nvidiactl? specifies that /dev/nvidiactl will only be mounted in the
          sandbox if it exists in the host filesystem.

          If the source is in the Nix store, then its closure will be added to the sandbox as well.

          Depending on how Nix was built, the default value for this option may be empty or provide <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> as a
          bind-mount of bash.

          <b>Default:</b> <u>empty</u>

          <b>Deprecated</b> <b>alias:</b> build-chroot-dirs, build-sandbox-paths

       •  secret-key-files

          A whitespace-separated list of files containing secret (private) keys. These are used to sign locally-
          built paths. They can be generated  using  nix-store  --generate-binary-cache-key.  The  corresponding
          public key can be distributed to other users, who can add it to trusted-public-keys in their nix.conf.

          <b>Default:</b> <u>empty</u>

       •  show-trace

          Whether Nix should print out a stack trace in case of Nix expression evaluation errors.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  ssl-cert-file

          The  path of a file containing CA certificates used to authenticate https:// downloads. Nix by default
          will use the first of the following files that exists:

          1. <a href="file:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt">/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt</a>
          2. /nix/var/nix/profiles/default/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt

          The path can be overridden by the following environment variables, in order of precedence:

          1. NIX_SSL_CERT_FILE
          2. SSL_CERT_FILE

          <b>Default:</b> <a href="file:/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt">/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt</a>

       •  stalled-download-timeout

          The timeout (in seconds) for receiving data from servers during download. Nix cancels  idle  downloads
          after this timeout’s duration.

          <b>Default:</b> 300

       •  start-id

          The first UID and GID to use for dynamic ID allocation.

          <b>Default:</b> 872415232

       •  store

          The  URL of the Nix store  to  use for most operations.  See the Store Types section of the manual for
          supported store types and settings.

          <b>Default:</b> auto

       •  substitute

          If set to true (default), Nix will use binary substitutes if available. This option can be disabled to
          force building from source.

          <b>Default:</b> true

          <b>Deprecated</b> <b>alias:</b> build-use-substitutes

       •  substituters

          A list of URLs of Nix stores to be used as substituters, separated by whitespace.  A substituter is an
          additional store from which Nix can obtain store objects instead of building them.

          Substituters are tried based on their priority value, which each substituter  can  set  independently.
          Lower  value  means  higher priority.  The default is https://cache.nixos.org, which has a priority of
          40.

          At least one of the following conditions must be met for Nix to use a substituter:

          •  The substituter is in the trusted-substituters list
          •  The user calling Nix is in the trusted-users list

          In addition, each store path should be trusted as described in trusted-public-keys

          <b>Default:</b> https://cache.nixos.org/

          <b>Deprecated</b> <b>alias:</b> binary-caches

       •  sync-before-registering

          Whether to call sync() before registering a path as valid.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  system

          The system type of the current Nix installation.  Nix will only build a given derivation locally  when
          its system attribute equals any of the values specified here or in extra-platforms.

          The  default  value  is  set when Nix itself is compiled for the system it will run on.  The following
          system types are widely used, as Nix is actively supported on these platforms:

          •  x86_64-linux
          •  x86_64-darwin
          •  i686-linux
          •  aarch64-linux
          •  aarch64-darwin
          •  armv6l-linux
          •  armv7l-linux

          In general, you do not have to modify this setting.  While you can force Nix to run a  Darwin-specific
          builder executable on a Linux machine, the result would obviously be wrong.

          This value is available in the Nix language as builtins.currentSystem if the eval-system configuration
          option is set as the empty string.

          <b>Default:</b> x86_64-linux

       •  system-features

          A set of system “features” supported by this machine.

          This  complements  the  system  and extra-platforms configuration options and the corresponding system
          attribute on derivations.

          A derivation can require system features in the requiredSystemFeatures attribute, and the  machine  to
          build the derivation must have them.

          System features are user-defined, but Nix sets the following defaults:

          •  apple-virt

          Included on Darwin if virtualization is available.

          •  kvm

          Included on Linux if /dev/kvm is accessible.

          •  nixos-test, benchmark, big-parallel

          These  historical  pseudo-features are always enabled for backwards compatibility, as they are used in
          Nixpkgs to route Hydra builds to specific machines.

          •  ca-derivations

          Included by default if the ca-derivations experimental feature is enabled.

          This system feature is implicitly required by derivations with the __contentAddressed attribute.

          •  recursive-nix

          Included by default if the recursive-nix experimental feature is enabled.

          •  uid-range

          On Linux, Nix can run builds in a user namespace where they run as root (UID 0) and have  65,536  UIDs
          available.  This is primarily useful for running containers such as systemd-nspawn inside a Nix build.
          For an example, see [tests/systemd-nspawn/nix][nspawn].

          [nspawn]:    https://github.com/NixOS/nix/blob/67bcb99700a0da1395fa063d7c6586740b304598/tests/systemd-
          nspawn.nix.

          Included by default on Linux if the auto-allocate-uids setting is enabled.

          <b>Default:</b> <u>machine-specific</u>

       •  tarball-ttl

          The number of seconds a downloaded tarball is considered fresh. If the cached tarball  is  stale,  Nix
          will  check  whether  it is still up to date using the ETag header. Nix will download a new version if
          the ETag header is unsupported, or the cached ETag doesn’t match.

          Setting the TTL to 0 forces Nix to always check if the tarball is up to date.

          Nix caches tarballs in $XDG_CACHE_HOME/nix/tarballs.

          Files fetched via NIX_PATH, fetchGit, fetchMercurial, fetchTarball, and fetchurl respect this TTL.

          <b>Default:</b> 3600

       •  timeout

          This option defines the maximum number of seconds that a builder can run. This is useful (for instance
          in an automated build system) to catch builds that are stuck in an infinite loop but keep  writing  to
          their standard output or standard error. It can be overridden using the --timeout command line switch.

          The value 0 means that there is no timeout. This is also the default.

          <b>Default:</b> 0

          <b>Deprecated</b> <b>alias:</b> build-timeout

       •  trace-function-calls

          If set to true, the Nix evaluator will trace every function call.  Nix will print a log message at the
          “vomit” level for every function entrance and function exit.

          function-trace  entered  undefined  position  at  1565795816999559622  function-trace exited undefined
          position   at   1565795816999581277   function-trace   entered   /nix/store/…/example.nix:226:41    at
          1565795253249935150 function-trace exited /nix/store/…/example.nix:226:41 at 1565795253249941684

          The undefined position means the function call is a builtin.

          Use  the  contrib/stack-collapse.py  script  distributed with the Nix source code to convert the trace
          logs in to a format suitable for flamegraph.pl.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  trace-verbose

          Whether builtins.traceVerbose should trace its first argument when evaluated.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  trust-tarballs-from-git-forges

          If enabled (the default), Nix will consider tarballs from GitHub and similar Git forges to  be  locked
          if  a  Git revision is specified, e.g. github:NixOS/patchelf/7c2f768bf9601268a4e71c2ebe91e2011918a70f.
          This requires Nix to trust that the provider will return the correct contents for  the  specified  Git
          revision.

          If  disabled,  such  tarballs  are  only  considered  locked if a narHash attribute is specified, e.g.
          github:NixOS/patchelf/7c2f768bf9601268a4e71c2ebe91e2011918a70f?narHash=sha256-PPXqKY2hJng4DBVE0I4xshv/vGLUskL7jl53roB8UdU%3D.

          <b>Default:</b> true

       •  trusted-public-keys

          A whitespace-separated list of public keys.

          At least one of the following condition must be met for Nix to accept  copying  a  store  object  from
          another Nix store (such as a substituter):

          •  the store object has been signed using a key in the trusted keys list
          •  the require-sigs option has been set to false
          •  the store URL is configured with trusted=true
          •  the store object is content-addressed

          <b>Default:</b> cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY=

          <b>Deprecated</b> <b>alias:</b> binary-cache-public-keys

       •  trusted-substituters

          A  list  of  Nix store URLs, separated by whitespace.  These are not used by default, but users of the
          Nix daemon can enable them by specifying substituters.

          Unprivileged users (those set in only allowed-users but not trusted-users) can  pass  as  substituters
          only those URLs listed in trusted-substituters.

          <b>Default:</b> <u>empty</u>

          <b>Deprecated</b> <b>alias:</b> trusted-binary-caches

       •  trusted-users

          A  list  of  user  names,  separated  by  whitespace.   These  users  will have additional rights when
          connecting to the Nix daemon, such as the ability to specify additional  substituters,  or  to  import
          unsigned realisations or unsigned input-addressed store objects.

          You  can  also  specify groups by prefixing names with @.  For instance, @wheel means all users in the
          wheel group.

                 <b>Warning</b>

                 Adding a user to trusted-users is essentially equivalent to giving that user root access to the
                 system.  For example, the user can access or replace store path contents that are critical  for
                 system security.

          <b>Default:</b> root

       •  upgrade-nix-store-path-url

          Used by nix upgrade-nix, the URL of the file that contains the store paths of the latest Nix release.

          <b>Default:</b>       https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/raw/master/nixos/modules/installer/tools/nix-fallback-
          paths.nix

       •  use-case-hack

          Whether to enable a macOS-specific hack for dealing with file name case collisions.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  use-cgroups

          Whether to execute builds inside cgroups.  This is only supported on Linux.

          Cgroups are required and enabled automatically for  derivations  that  require  the  uid-range  system
          feature.

          <b>Default:</b> false

       •  use-registries

                 <b>Warning</b>

                 This setting is part of an experimental feature.

                 To  change  this  setting,  make sure the flakes experimental feature is enabled.  For example,
                 include the following in nix.conf:

          extra-experimental-features = flakes
          use-registries = ...

          Whether to use flake registries to resolve flake references.

          <b>Default:</b> true

       •  use-sqlite-wal

          Whether SQLite should use WAL mode.

          <b>Default:</b> true

       •  use-xdg-base-directories

          If set to true, Nix will conform to the XDG Base Directory Specification  for  files  in  $HOME.   The
          environment variables used to implement this are documented in the Environment Variables section.

                 <b>Warning</b>  This  changes  the  location of some well-known symlinks that Nix creates, which might
                 break tools that rely on the old, non-XDG-conformant locations.

          In particular, the following locations change:
          ┌──────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
          │ <b>Old</b>                              │                <b>New</b>                          │
          ├──────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
          │ <a href="file:~/.nix-profile">~/.nix-profile</a>                   │                $XDG_STATE_HOME/nix/profile  │
          ├──────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
          │ <a href="file:~/.nix-defexpr">~/.nix-defexpr</a>                   │                $XDG_STATE_HOME/nix/defexpr  │
          ├──────────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
          │ <a href="file:~/.nix-channels">~/.nix-channels</a>                  │                $XDG_STATE_HOME/nix/channels │
          └──────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

          If you already have Nix installed and are using profiles or channels, you should migrate manually when
          you enable this option.   If  $XDG_STATE_HOME  is  not  set,  use  $HOME/.local/state/nix  instead  of
          $XDG_STATE_HOME/nix.  This can be achieved with the following shell commands:

       nix_state_home=${XDG_STATE_HOME-$HOME/.local/state}/nix
       mkdir -p $nix_state_home
       mv $HOME/.nix-profile $nix_state_home/profile
       mv $HOME/.nix-defexpr $nix_state_home/defexpr
       mv $HOME/.nix-channels $nix_state_home/channels

              <b>Default:</b> false

       •  user-agent-suffix

          String appended to the user agent in HTTP requests.

          <b>Default:</b> <u>empty</u>

       •  warn-dirty

          Whether to warn about dirty Git/Mercurial trees.

          <b>Default:</b> true

       •  warn-large-path-threshold

          Warn  when  copying a path larger than this number of bytes to the Nix store (as determined by its NAR
          serialisation).  Default is 0, which disables the warning.  Set it to 1 to warn on all paths.

          <b>Default:</b> 0

                                                                                                     <u><a href="../man5/nix.conf.5.html">nix.conf</a></u>(5)
