</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       nut.conf - UPS definitions for Network UPS Tools

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This file attempts to standardize the various files being found in different installations, like
       /etc/default/nut on Debian based systems and /etc/sysconfig/ups on RedHat based systems.

       Distribution’s init script should source this file in order to determine which components have to be
       started.

       Blank lines are ignored. Lines with a hash (#) character at the first position of the line are ignored,
       too. They can be used to add comments.

</pre><h4><b>IMPORTANT</b> <b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       •   This file is intended to be sourced by shell scripts as well as by service management frameworks like
           systemd on Linux:

           •   There is no guaranteed export VAR=VAL syntax

           •   No guaranteed expansion of variables like VAR1="$VAR2-something" —  only verbatim assignments

           •   You may need to export VAR when sourcing it into init-scripts or other scripts, for eventual
               propagation of certain settings to NUT programs. Not-exported variables can only be consumed by
               the script which "sourced" the file (and may choose to export them independently).

       •   You MUST NOT use spaces around the equal sign!

       •   Practical support for this file and its settings currently varies between different OS packages and
           NUT sample scripts, but should converge over time.

       •   Contents of this file should be pure ASCII (character codes not in range would be ignored with a
           warning message).

       Refer to the EXAMPLE section for illustrations.

</pre><h4><b>DIRECTIVES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>MODE</b>
           Required. Recognized values are <u>none</u>, <u>standalone</u>, <u>netserver</u> and <u>netclient</u>. Defaults to <u>none</u>.

           none
               Indicates that NUT should not get started automatically, possibly because it is not configured or
               that an Integrated Power Management or some external system, is used to startup the NUT
               components.

           standalone
               Addresses a local only configuration, with 1 UPS protecting the local system. This implies to
               start the 3 NUT layers (driver, upsd and upsmon), with the related configuration files. This mode
               can also address UPS redundancy.

           netserver
               Like the standalone configuration, but also possibly need one or more specific LISTEN
               directive(s) in upsd.conf. Since this MODE is open to the network, a special care should be
               applied to security concerns.

           netclient
               When only upsmon is required, possibly because there are other hosts that are more closely
               attached to the UPS, the MODE should be set to netclient.

       <b>ALLOW_NO_DEVICE</b>
           Optional, defaults to false. Set this to true to allow starting the upsd NUT data server service even
           if ups.conf has no device sections configured at the moment. This environment variable overrides the
           built-in "false" flag value in the upsd program, and an optional same-named default flag that can be
           set in upsd.conf.

           If you want a data server always running and responding on the network, even if it initially has
           nothing to serve (may be live-reloaded later, when devices become configured), this option is for
           you.

       <b>ALLOW_NOT_ALL_LISTENERS</b>
           Optional, defaults to false. Set this to true to allow starting the upsd NUT data server even if not
           all LISTEN directives can be honoured at the moment. This environment variable overrides the built-in
           "false" flag in the upsd program, and an optional same-named default flag that can be set in
           upsd.conf.

           If you want a data server always running, even if it would potentially not serve all clients on every
           uptime, this option is for you (note you would have to restart upsd to pick up the `LISTEN`ed IP
           address if it appears later).

           Probably configuring LISTEN * is a better choice in such cases.

       <b>UPSD_OPTIONS</b>
           Optional. Set upsd specific options. See <b><a href="../man8/upsd.8.html">upsd</a></b>(8) for more details. It is ignored when <u>MODE</u> above
           indicates that no upsd should be running.

       <b>UPSMON_OPTIONS</b>
           Optional. Set upsmon specific options. See <b><a href="../man8/upsmon.8.html">upsmon</a></b>(8) for more details. It is ignored when <u>MODE</u> above
           indicates that no upsmon should be running.

       <b>POWEROFF_WAIT</b>
           Optional. At the end of an emergency system halt, the upsmon primary will signal the UPS to switch
           off. This may fail for a number of reasons. Most notably is the case that mains power returns during
           the shutdown process. See the section "Power races" in /usr/share/doc/nut/FAQ.txt.gz. The system will
           wait this long for the UPS to cut power, and then reboot. It should be long enough to exhaust the
           batteries, in case line power continues to be unavailable. On the other hand, it should not be so
           long that the system remains offline for an unreasonable amount of time if line power has returned.
           See <b><a href="../man1/sleep.1.html">sleep</a></b>(1) for compatible time syntax. If you specify the time in seconds, use the "s" suffix.

               <b>Warning</b>
               This workaround might be dangerous under some circumstances. Please read
               <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/358696">http://bugs.debian.org/358696</a> for more details.

       <b>POWEROFF_QUIET</b>
           Optional, defaults to false. This setting controls if the NUT shutdown integration scripts or service
           units would emit messages about their activity (or lack thereof). By default they may be verbose, to
           aid in post-mortem troubleshooting via logs or console captures. Set to true to avoid that trove of
           information, if you consider it noise.

       <b>NUT_DEBUG_LEVEL</b>
           Optional, defaults to 0. This setting controls the default debugging message verbosity passed to NUT
           daemons. As an environment variable, its priority sits between that of <u>DEBUG_MIN</u> setting of a driver
           and the command-line options.

       <b>NUT_DEBUG_PID</b>
           Optionally add current process ID to tags with debug-level identifiers. This may be useful when many
           NUT daemons write to the same console or log file, such as in containers/plugins for Home Assistant,
           storage appliances...

       <b>NUT_DEBUG_SYSLOG</b>
           Optional, unset by default. Normally NUT can (attempt to) use the syslog or Event Log (WIN32), but
           the environment variable <u>NUT_DEBUG_SYSLOG</u> allows to bypass it, and perhaps keep the daemons logging
           to stderr (useful e.g. in NUT Integration Test suite to not pollute the OS logs, or in systemd where
           stderr and syslog both go into the same journal). Recognized values:
           ┌─────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
           │ <b>Value</b>       │ <b>Description</b>                                                           │
           ├─────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
           │ stderr      │                Disabled and `background()` keeps `stderr` attached    │
           ├─────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
           │ none        │                Disabled and `background()` detaches `stderr` as usual │
           ├─────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
           │ default     │                Not disabled                                           │
           ├─────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
           │ unset/other │                Not disabled                                           │
           └─────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

       <b>NUT_IGNORE_CHECKPROCNAME</b>
           Optional, defaults to false. Normally NUT can (attempt to) verify that the program file name matches
           the name associated with a running process, when using PID files to send signals.

           The NUT_IGNORE_CHECKPROCNAME boolean toggle allows to quickly skip such verification, in case it
           causes problems (e.g. NUT programs were renamed and do not match built-in expectations).

           This environment variable can also be optionally set in init-scripts or service methods for upsd,
           upsmon and NUT drivers/upsdrvctl.

       <b>NUT_QUIET_INIT_UPSNOTIFY</b>
           Optional flag to prevent daemons which can notify service management frameworks (such as systemd)
           about passing their lifecycle milestones, to not report loudly if they could NOT do so (e.g. running
           on a system without a framework, or misconfigured so they could not report and the OS could
           eventually restart the false-positively identified "unresponsive" service.

           Currently such reports, done by default, help troubleshoot service start-up and highlight that NUT
           sources (or package build) did not take advantage of tighter OS service management framework
           integration (if one exists, so that developers could focus on adding that). Reasons to set this flag
           could include platforms without such a framework and not expecting one, although nagging your
           favourite OS or contributing development to make it better is also a way.
