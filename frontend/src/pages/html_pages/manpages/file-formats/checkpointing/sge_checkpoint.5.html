</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       checkpoint - Grid Engine checkpointing environment configuration file format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Checkpointing is a facility to save the complete status of an executing program or job and to restore and
       restart  from  this  so-called  checkpoint  at  a  later point of time if the original program or job was
       halted, e.g.  through a system crash.

       Grid Engine provides various levels  of  checkpointing  support  (see  <u><a href="../man1/sge_ckpt.1.html">sge_ckpt</a></u>(1)).   The  checkpointing
       environment  described  here is a means to configure the different types of checkpointing in use for your
       Grid Engine cluster or parts thereof. For that purpose you can define the operations  which  have  to  be
       executed in initiating a checkpoint generation, a migration of a checkpoint to another host, or a restart
       of a checkpointed application.

       Supporting  different  operating  systems  may  easily  force  Grid  Engine to introduce operating system
       dependencies for the configuration of the checkpointing configuration file and updates of  the  supported
       operating  system  versions  may lead to frequently changing implementation details.  Please refer to the
       &lt;sge_root&gt;/ckpt directory for more information.

       Please use the  <u>-ackpt</u>,  <u>-dckpt</u>,  <u>-mckpt</u>  or  <u>-sckpt</u>  options  to  the  <u><a href="../man1/qconf.1.html">qconf</a></u>(1)  command  to  manipulate
       checkpointing  environments from the command-line or use the corresponding <u><a href="../man1/qmon.1.html">qmon</a></u>(1) dialogue for X-Windows
       based interactive configuration.

       Note, Grid Engine allows backslashes (\) be used to escape newline  characters.  The  backslash  and  the
       newline are replaced with a space character before any interpretation.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The format of a <u>checkpoint</u> file is defined as follows:

   <b>ckpt_name</b>
       The name of the checkpointing environment in the format for <u>ckpt_name</u> in <u><a href="../man5/sge_types.5.html">sge_types</a></u>(5).  To be used in the
       <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1) <b>-ckpt</b> switch or for the <u><a href="../man1/qconf.1.html">qconf</a></u>(1) options mentioned above.

   <b>interface</b>
       The type of checkpointing to be used. Currently, the following types are valid:

       <u>hibernator</u>
              The Hibernator kernel level checkpointing is interfaced.

       <u>cpr</u>    The SGI kernel level checkpointing is used.

       <u>transparent</u>
              Grid  Engine  assumes that the jobs submitted with reference to this checkpointing interface use a
              checkpointing library such as provided by the free package <u>Condor</u>.

       <u>userdefined</u>
              Grid Engine assumes that the jobs submitted with reference to this checkpointing interface perform
              their private checkpointing method.

       <u>application-level</u>
              Uses all of the interface commands configured in the checkpointing object like in the case of  one
              of  the  kernel  level  checkpointing  interfaces  (<u>cpr</u>, etc.) except for the <b>restart_command</b> (see
              below), which is not used (even if it is configured) but the job script is invoked in  case  of  a
              restart instead.

   <b>ckpt_command</b>
       A  command-line type command string to be executed by Grid Engine in order to initiate a checkpoint.  The
       following pseudo-variables are available to be substituted in the value:

       <b>$host</b>  The name of the host on which the command is executed.

       <b>$ja_task_id</b>
              The array job task index (0 if not an array job).

       <b>$job_owner</b>
              The user name of the job owner.

       <b>$job_id</b>
              Grid Engine's unique job identification number.

       <b>$job_name</b>
              The name of the job.

       <b>$queue</b> The cluster queue name of the master queue instance, on which the command is started.

       <b>$job_pid</b>
              The process id of the job/task to checkpoint.

       <b>$ckpt_dir</b>
              See <b>ckpt_dir</b> below.

       <b>$ckpt_signal</b>
              See <b>signal</b> below.

       <b>$sge_cell</b>
              The SGE_CELL environment variable (useful for locating files).

       <b>$sge_root</b>
              The SGE_ROOT environment variable (useful for locating files).

   <b>migr_command</b>
       A command-line type command string to be executed by Grid Engine during a migration  of  a  checkpointing
       job  from  one  host to another.  The same pseudo-variables are available as for <b>ckpt_command</b>.  Note that
       the command is expected  to  create  a  checkpoint  itself  -  the  checkpointing  command  isn't  called
       automatically on migration.

   <b>restart_command</b>
       A  command-line  type  command  string  to  be  executed  by  Grid  Engine  when  restarting a previously
       checkpointed application.  The same pseudo-variables are available as for <b>ckpt_command</b>.

   <b>clean_command</b>
       A command-line type command string to be executed by Grid Engine in order to cleanup after a checkpointed
       application has finished.  The same pseudo-variables are available as for <b>ckpt_command</b>.

   <b>ckpt_dir</b>
       A file system location to which checkpoints of potentially considerable size should be stored.

   <b>signal</b>
       A Unix signal to be sent to a job by Grid Engine to initiate checkpoint generation. The  value  for  this
       field  can either be a symbolic name from the list produced by the <u>-l</u> option of the <u><a href="../man1/kill.1.html">kill</a></u>(1) command or an
       integer number which must be a valid signal on the systems used for checkpointing.

   <b>when</b>
       The points of time when checkpoints are expected to be generated.  Valid values for  this  parameter  are
       composed  from  the  letters <u>s</u>, <u>m</u>, <u>x</u>, <u>r</u>, and any combinations thereof without any separating character in
       between. The same letters are allowed for the <u>-c</u> option of the <u><a href="../man1/qsub.1.html">qsub</a></u>(1) command which will  overwrite  the
       definitions in the checkpointing environment used.  The meaning of the letters is as follows:

       <u>s</u>      A  job  is  checkpointed,  aborted and, if possible, migrated if the corresponding <u><a href="../man8/sge_execd.8.html">sge_execd</a></u>(8) is
              shut down on the job's host.  This operation is handled by the specified <b>migr_command</b>.

       <u>m</u>      checkpoints are generated periodically at the <u>min_cpu_interval</u> interval defined by the queue  (see
              <u><a href="../man5/queue_conf.5.html">queue_conf</a></u>(5)) in which a job executes.

       <u>x</u>      A  job  is  checkpointed,  aborted  and,  if  possible, migrated as soon as the job gets suspended
              (manually as well as automatically).  This operation is handled by the specified <b>migr_command</b>.

       <u>r</u>      A job will be rescheduled (not checkpointed) when the host on which the job  currently  runs  goes
              into the "unknown" state and the time interval <u>reschedule_unknown</u> (see <u><a href="../man5/sge_conf.5.html">sge_conf</a></u>(5)) defined in the
              global/local cluster configuration is exceeded.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>SGE_BINDING</b> and <b>SGE_CKPT_DIR</b> may be specified on job submission.  See <u><a href="../man1/submit.1.html">submit</a></u>(1).

</pre><h4><b>RESTRICTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>Note</b>  that  the  functionality  of any checkpointing, migration or restart procedures provided by default
       with the Grid Engine distribution, as well  as  the  way  how  they  are  invoked  in  the  <u>ckpt_command</u>,
       <u>migr_command</u>  or  <u>restart_command</u>  parameters  of  any  default checkpointing environments, should not be
       changed; otherwise the functionality remains the full responsibility of the administrator configuring the
       checkpointing environment.  Grid Engine will just invoke these procedures and evaluate their exit status.
       If the procedures do not perform their tasks properly, or are  not  invoked  in  a  proper  fashion,  the
       checkpointing mechanism may behave unexpectedly; Grid Engine has no means to detect this - all exit codes
       are treated as successful operation except for the case of kernel checkpointing.

       See also the restrictions in <u><a href="../man5/sge_ckpt.5.html">sge_ckpt</a></u>(5).
