</pre><h4><b>LIST</b> <b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>EPM</u>  maintains  a  list  of variables and their values which can be used to substitute values in the list
       file. These variables are imported from the current environment and taken from the command-line and  list
       file as provided.  Substitutions occur when the variable name is referenced with the dollar sign ($):

           %postinstall &lt;&lt;EOF
           echo What is your name:
           read $$name
           Your name is $$name
           EOF

           f 0555 root sys ${bindir}/foo foo
           f 0555 root sys $datadir/foo/foo.dat foo.dat

       Variable names can be surrounded by curley brackets (${name}) or alone ($name); without brackets the name
       is terminated by the first slash (/), dash (-), or whitespace. The dollar sign can be inserted using $$.
