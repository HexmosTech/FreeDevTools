</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       slapo-dynlist - Dynamic List overlay to slapd

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/ldap/slapd.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>dynlist</b>  overlay to <b><a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd</a></b>(8) allows expansion of dynamic lists and groups.  Any time an entry with a
       specific objectClass (defined in the overlay  configuration)  is  being  returned,  the  LDAP  URI-valued
       occurrences  of  a  specific  attribute (also defined in the overlay configuration) are expanded into the
       corresponding entries.

       For a dynamic list, the values of the attributes listed in the URI are added from the matching entries to
       the original entry.  No recursion is allowed, to avoid potential infinite  loops.   The  resulting  entry
       must  comply  with  the  LDAP  data  model,  so constraints are enforced.  For example, if a <u>SINGLE-VALUE</u>
       attribute is listed, only the first value found during the list expansion appears in the final entry.

       For a dynamic group, the DNs of the matching entries are added to a  member  attribute  in  the  original
       entry.

       All  dynamic  behavior  is  disabled  when the <u>manageDSAit</u> control (RFC 3296) is used.  In that case, the
       contents of the original entry is returned; namely, the URLs are returned instead of being expanded.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The config directives that are specific to the <b>dynlist</b> overlay must be prefixed  by  <b>dynlist-</b>,  to  avoid
       potential conflicts with directives specific to the underlying database or to other stacked overlays.

       <b>overlay</b> <b>dynlist</b>
              This  directive  adds  the  dynlist  overlay  to the current database, or to the frontend, if used
              before any database instantiation; see <b><a href="../man5/slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf</a></b>(5) for details.

       This <b>slapd.conf</b>  configuration  option  is  defined  for  the  dynlist  overlay.  It  may  have  multiple
       occurrences, and it must appear after the <b>overlay</b> directive.

       <b>dynlist-attrset</b> <b>&lt;group-oc&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;URI&gt;]</b> <b>&lt;URL-ad&gt;</b> <b>[options]</b>

              The value <b>group-oc</b> is the name of the objectClass that triggers the dynamic expansion of the data.

              The  optional  <b>URI</b>  restricts  expansion only to entries matching the <u>DN</u>, the <u>scope</u> and the <u>filter</u>
              portions of the URI.

              The value <b>URL-ad</b> is the name of the attributeDescription that contains the URI that is expanded by
              the overlay; if none is present, no expansion occurs.   If  the  intersection  of  the  attributes
              requested  by  the  search  operation  (or the asserted attribute for compares) and the attributes
              listed in the URI is empty, no expansion occurs for that specific URI.  It must be  a  subtype  of
              <u>labeledURI</u>.

              The remaining options depend on whether a dynamic list or a dynamic group is being configured.

              For a dynamic list, the allowed options have the form

              <b>[&lt;mapped-ad&gt;:&lt;list-ad&gt;</b> <b>...]</b>

              The <b>mapped-ad</b> can be used to remap attributes obtained through expansion.  The <b>list-ad</b> must be one
              of  the  attributes  returned  in the expansion of the URIs in the <b>URL-ad</b> attribute of the dynamic
              entry. Multiple mapping statements can be used.  Note that in order for dynamic lists to be usable
              in a search filter, the dynamic attributes to be filtered must be explicitly mapped. They  can  be
              mapped to themselves if no transformation is required.

              For a dynamic group, the allowed options are

              <b>&lt;member-ad&gt;[+&lt;memberOf-ad&gt;[@&lt;static-oc&gt;[*]]]</b>

              The  <b>member-ad</b>  is  required;  this  attribute  will list the DN of the entries resulting from the
              internal search.  In this case, the <u>attrs</u> portion of the URIs in  the  <b>URL-ad</b>  attribute  must  be
              absent,  and  the  <u>DN</u>s  of  all the entries resulting from the expansion of the URIs are listed as
              values of this attribute.  Compares that assert the value of the <b>member-ad</b>  attribute  of  entries
              with  <b>group-oc</b>  objectClass  apply as if the DN of the entries resulting from the expansion of the
              URI were present in the <b>group-oc</b> entry as values of the  <b>member-ad</b>  attribute.   If  the  optional
              <b>memberOf-ad</b>  attribute  is  also  specified, then it will be populated with the DNs of the dynamic
              groups that an entry is a member of.  If the optional <b>static-oc</b>  objectClass  is  also  specified,
              then the memberOf attribute will also be populated with the DNs of the static groups that an entry
              is  a  member  of.   Note that using the same <b>static-oc</b> objectClass in more than one dynamic group
              configuration is not supported.  If the optional <b>*</b> character is also specified,  then  the  member
              and  memberOf values will be populated recursively, for nested groups. Note that currently nesting
              is only supported for Search operations, not Compares.

       <b>dynlist-simple</b> <b>TRUE</b> <b>|</b> <b>FALSE</b>
              This option downgrades to the behavior of the OpenLDAP 2.4 dynlist overlay.  It disables  memberOf
              processing,  nested  group  support,  and  filter evaluation of dynamically generated values.  The
              default is FALSE.

       The dynlist overlay may be used with any backend, but it is mainly intended for use  with  local  storage
       backends.   In  case the URI expansion is very resource-intensive and occurs frequently with well-defined
       patterns, one should consider adding a proxycache later on in the overlay stack.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHORIZATION</b></h4><pre>
       By default the expansions are performed using the identity of the current LDAP user.  This  identity  may
       be  overridden  by  setting the <b>dgIdentity</b> attribute in the group's entry to the DN of another LDAP user.
       In that case the dgIdentity will be used when expanding the URIs in the object.  Setting  the  dgIdentity
       to  a zero-length string will cause the expansions to be performed anonymously.  Note that the dgIdentity
       attribute is defined in the <b>dyngroup</b> schema, and  this  schema  must  be  loaded  before  the  dgIdentity
       authorization  feature  may  be used.  If the <b>dgAuthz</b> attribute is also present in the group's entry, its
       values are used to determine what identities are authorized to use the <b>dgIdentity</b> to  expand  the  group.
       Values  of  the  <b>dgAuthz</b>  attribute must conform to the (experimental) <u>OpenLDAP</u> <u>authz</u> syntax.  When using
       dynamic memberOf in search filters, search access to the <b>entryDN</b> pseudo-attribute is required.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       This example collects all the email addresses of a database into a single entry; first of all, make  sure
       that slapd.conf contains the directives:

           include /path/to/dyngroup.schema
           # ...

           database &lt;database&gt;
           # ...

           overlay dynlist
           dynlist-attrset groupOfURLs memberURL

       and that slapd loads dynlist.la, if compiled as a run-time module; then add to the database an entry like

           dn: cn=Dynamic List,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com
           objectClass: groupOfURLs
           cn: Dynamic List
           memberURL: ldap:///ou=People,dc=example,dc=com?mail?sub?(objectClass=person)

       If no &lt;attrs&gt; are provided in the URI, all (non-operational) attributes are collected.

       The  values of the above list can not be evaluated in a search filter. To enable filter evaluation on the
       dynamic list, the configuration must be changed to explicitly map the dynamic attributes to be  filtered.
       In this case <b>mail</b> is just mapped to itself.

           include /path/to/dyngroup.schema
           # ...

           database &lt;database&gt;
           # ...

           overlay dynlist
           dynlist-attrset groupOfURLs memberURL mail:mail

       This example implements the dynamic group feature on the <b>member</b> attribute:

           include /path/to/dyngroup.schema
           # ...

           database &lt;database&gt;
           # ...

           overlay dynlist
           dynlist-attrset groupOfURLs memberURL member

       A dynamic group with dgIdentity authorization could be created with an entry like

           dn: cn=Dynamic Group,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com
           objectClass: groupOfURLs
           objectClass: dgIdentityAux
           cn: Dynamic Group
           memberURL: ldap:///ou=People,dc=example,dc=com??sub?(objectClass=person)
           dgIdentity: cn=Group Proxy,ou=Services,dc=example,dc=com

       This  example  extends the dynamic group feature to add a dynamic <b>dgMemberOf</b> attribute to all the members
       of a dynamic group:

           include /path/to/dyngroup.schema
           # ...

           database &lt;database&gt;
           # ...

           overlay dynlist
           dynlist-attrset groupOfURLs memberURL member+dgMemberOf

       This example extends the dynamic memberOf feature to add the <b>memberOf</b> attribute to  all  the  members  of
       both static and dynamic groups:

           include /path/to/dyngroup.schema
           # ...

           database &lt;database&gt;
           # ...

           overlay dynlist
           dynlist-attrset groupOfURLs memberURL member+memberOf@groupOfNames

       This dynamic memberOf feature can fully replace the functionality of the <b><a href="../man5/slapo-memberof.5.html">slapo-memberof</a></b>(5) overlay.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/ldap/slapd.conf
              default slapd configuration file

</pre><h4><b>BACKWARD</b> <b>COMPATIBILITY</b></h4><pre>
       The  dynlist  overlay  has been reworked with the 2.5 release to use a consistent namespace as with other
       overlays. As a side-effect the following cn=config parameters are deprecated and will  be  removed  in  a
       future  release:  <b>olcDlAttrSet</b>  is  replaced  with  olcDynListAttrSet  <b>olcDynamicList</b>  is  replaced  with
       olcDynListConfig

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man5/slapd.conf.5.html">slapd.conf</a></b>(5), <b><a href="../man5/slapd-config.5.html">slapd-config</a></b>(5), <b><a href="../man8/slapd.8.html">slapd</a></b>(8).  The <b><a href="../man5/slapo-dynlist.5.html">slapo-dynlist</a></b>(5) overlay  supports  dynamic  configuration
       via <b>back-config</b>.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Filtering  on  dynamic groups may return incomplete results if the search operation uses the <u>pagedResults</u>
       control.

</pre><h4><b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
