</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       tinc.conf — tinc daemon configuration

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The files in the <u>/etc/tinc/</u> directory contain runtime and security information for the tinc daemon.

</pre><h4><b>NETWORKS</b></h4><pre>
       It is perfectly ok for you to run more than one tinc daemon.  However, in its default form, you will soon
       notice that you can't use two different configuration files without the <b>-c</b> option.

       We  have  thought of another way of dealing with this: network names.  This means that you call <b>tinc.conf</b>
       with the <b>-n</b> option, which will assign a name to this daemon.

       The effect of this is that the daemon will  set  its  configuration  root  to  <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/</u>,  where
       <u>NETNAME</u>  is  your argument to the <b>-n</b> option.  You'll notice that messages appear in syslog as coming from
       <b>tincd.</b><u>NETNAME</u>.

       However, it is not strictly necessary that you call tinc with the <b>-n</b> option.  In this case,  the  network
       name  would  just be empty, and it will be used as such.  <b>tinc</b> now looks for files in <u>/etc/tinc/</u>, instead
       of <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/</u>; the configuration file should be <u>/etc/tinc/tinc.conf</u>, and the  host  configuration
       files are now expected to be in <u>/etc/tinc/hosts/</u>.

       But  it  is highly recommended that you use this feature of <b>tinc</b>, because it will be so much clearer whom
       your daemon talks to.  Hence, we will assume that you use it.

</pre><h4><b>NAMES</b></h4><pre>
       Each tinc daemon must have a name that is unique in the network which it will be part of.  The name  will
       be   used   by   other   tinc   daemons  for  identification.   The  name  has  to  be  declared  in  the
       <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/tinc.conf</u> file.

       To make things easy, choose something that will give unique and easy  to  remember  names  to  your  tinc
       daemon(s).  You could try things like hostnames, owner surnames or location names.

</pre><h4><b>PUBLIC/PRIVATE</b> <b>KEYS</b></h4><pre>
       You should use <b>tincd</b> <b>-K</b> to generate public/private keypairs.  It will generate two keys.  The private key
       should  be  stored  in  a  separate  file  <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/rsa_key.priv</u> -- where <u>NETNAME</u> stands for the
       network (see “NETWORKS”) above.  The  public  key  should  be  stored  in  the  host  configuration  file
       <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/hosts/NAME</u> -- where <u>NAME</u> stands for the name of the local tinc daemon (see “NAMES”).

</pre><h4><b>SERVER</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  server  configuration  of  the  daemon  is  done in the file <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/tinc.conf</u>.  This file
       consists of comments (lines started with a <b>#</b>) or assignments in the form of:

       <u>Variable</u> <b>=</b> <u>Value</u>.

       The variable names are case insensitive, and any spaces, tabs, newlines and carriage returns are ignored.
       Note: it is not required that you put in the <b>=</b> sign, but doing so improves readability.  If you leave  it
       out, remember to replace it with at least one space character.

       The  server  configuration  is  complemented  with  host  specific  configuration (see the next section).
       Although all configuration options for the local host  listed  in  this  document  can  also  be  put  in
       <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/tinc.conf</u>,  it  is  recommended  to put host specific configuration options in the host
       configuration file, as this makes it easy to exchange with other nodes.

       Here are all valid variables,  listed  in  alphabetical  order.   The  default  value  is  given  between
       parentheses.

       <u>AddressFamily</u> <b>=</b> <b>ipv4</b> | <b>ipv6</b> | <b>any</b> (any)
               This  option affects the address family of listening and outgoing sockets.  If "any" is selected,
               then depending on the operating system both IPv4 and IPv6 or just IPv6 listening sockets will  be
               created.

       <u>BindToAddress</u> <b>=</b> <u>address</u> [<u>port</u>] [experimental]
               If  your  computer  has more than one IPv4 or IPv6 address, <b>tinc</b> will by default listen on all of
               them for incoming connections.  Multiple <u>BindToAddress</u> variables may be specified, in which  case
               listening sockets for each specified address are made.

               If no <u>port</u> is specified, the socket will be bound to the port specified by the <u>Port</u> option, or to
               port 655 if neither is given.  To only bind to a specific port but not to a specific address, use
               <b>*</b> for the <u>address</u>.

               This option may not work on all platforms.

       <u>BindToInterface</u> <b>=</b> <u>interface</u> [experimental]
               If  your computer has more than one network interface, <b>tinc</b> will by default listen on all of them
               for incoming connections.  It is possible to bind only to a single interface with this variable.

               This option may not work on all platforms.  Also, on some platforms it will not actually bind  to
               an interface, but rather to the address that the interface has at the moment a socket is created.

       <u>Broadcast</u> <b>=</b> <b>no</b> | <b>mst</b> | <b>direct</b> (mst) [experimental]
               This  option  selects  the way broadcast packets are sent to other daemons.  NOTE: all nodes in a
               VPN must use the same <u>Broadcast</u> mode, otherwise routing loops can form.

               no      Broadcast packets are never sent to other nodes.

               mst     Broadcast packets are sent and forwarded via  the  VPN's  Minimum  Spanning  Tree.   This
                       ensures broadcast packets reach all nodes.

               direct  Broadcast packets are sent directly to all nodes that can be reached directly.  Broadcast
                       packets  received  from  other  nodes are never forwarded.  If the IndirectData option is
                       also set, broadcast packets will only be sent to nodes which we have  a  meta  connection
                       to.

       <u>ConnectTo</u> <b>=</b> <u>name</u>
               Specifies  which other tinc daemon to connect to on startup.  Multiple <u>ConnectTo</u> variables may be
               specified, in which case outgoing connections to each specified tinc daemon are made.  The  names
               should be known to this tinc daemon (i.e., there should be a host configuration file for the name
               on the <u>ConnectTo</u> line).

               If  you  don't  specify a host with <u>ConnectTo</u>, <b>tinc</b> won't try to connect to other daemons at all,
               and will instead just listen for incoming connections.

       <u>DecrementTTL</u> <b>=</b> <b>yes</b> | <b>no</b> (no) [experimental]
               When enabled, <b>tinc</b> will decrement the Time To Live field in IPv4 packets, or the Hop Limit  field
               in  IPv6 packets, before forwarding a received packet to the virtual network device or to another
               node, and will drop packets that have a TTL value of zero, in which case it  will  send  an  ICMP
               Time Exceeded packet back.

               Do not use this option if you use switch mode and want to use IPv6.

       <u>Device</u> <b>=</b> <u>device</u> (<u>/dev/tap0</u>, <u>/dev/net/tun</u> or other depending on platform)
               The  virtual  network  device  to use.  <b>tinc</b> will automatically detect what kind of device it is.
               Note that you can only use one device per  daemon.   Under  Windows,  use  <u>Interface</u>  instead  of
               <u>Device</u>.   The  info  pages  of  the  tinc  package contain more information about configuring the
               virtual network device.

       <u>DeviceType</u> <b>=</b> <u>type</u> (platform dependent)
               The type of the virtual network device.  Tinc will normally automatically select the  right  type
               of  tun/tap  interface,  and this option should not be used.  However, this option can be used to
               select one of the special interface types, if support for them is compiled in.

               dummy   Use a dummy interface.  No packets are ever read or written to a virtual network  device.
                       Useful for testing, or when setting up a node that only forwards packets for other nodes.

               raw_socket
                       Open  a  raw  socket,  and  bind  it  to a pre-existing <u>Interface</u> (eth0 by default).  All
                       packets are read from this interface.  Packets received for the local node are written to
                       the raw socket.  However, at least on Linux, the operating system  does  not  process  IP
                       packets destined for the local host.

               multicast
                       Open a multicast UDP socket and bind it to the address and port (separated by spaces) and
                       optionally a TTL value specified using <u>Device</u>.  Packets are read from and written to this
                       multicast socket.  This can be used to connect to UML, QEMU or KVM instances listening on
                       the  same  multicast address.  Do NOT connect multiple <b>tinc</b> daemons to the same multicast
                       address, this will very likely cause routing  loops.   Also  note  that  this  can  cause
                       decrypted VPN packets to be sent out on a real network if misconfigured.

               uml (not compiled in by default)
                       Create  a UNIX socket with the filename specified by <u>Device</u>, or <u>/run/NETNAME.umlsocket</u> if
                       not specified.  <b>tinc</b> will wait for a User Mode Linux instance to connect to this socket.

               vde (not compiled in by default)
                       Uses the libvdeplug library to connect to a Virtual Distributed  Ethernet  switch,  using
                       the UNIX socket specified by <u>Device</u>, or <u>/run/vde.ctl</u> if not specified.
               Also, in case tinc does not seem to correctly interpret packets received from the virtual network
               device, it can be used to change the way packets are interpreted:

               tun (BSD and Linux)
                       Set  type  to  tun.   Depending  on  the  platform, this can either be with or without an
                       address family header (see below).

               tunnohead (BSD)
                       Set type to tun without an address family header.  Tinc will expect packets read from the
                       virtual network device to start with an IP header.  On some platforms IPv6 packets cannot
                       be read from or written to the device in this mode.

               tunifhead (BSD)
                       Set type to tun with an address family header.  Tinc will expect packets  read  from  the
                       virtual  network  device  to start with a four byte header containing the address family,
                       followed by an IP header.  This mode should support both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.

               utun (OS X)
                       Set type to utun.  This is only supported on OS X version 10.6.8 and higher, but  doesn't
                       require the tuntaposx module.  This mode should support both IPv4 and IPv6 packets.

               tap (BSD and Linux)
                       Set  type to tap.  Tinc will expect packets read from the virtual network device to start
                       with an Ethernet header.

       <u>DirectOnly</u> <b>=</b> <b>yes</b> | <b>no</b> (no) [experimental]
               When this option is enabled, packets that cannot be sent directly to the  destination  node,  but
               which  would  have  to  be forwarded by an intermediate node, are dropped instead.  When combined
               with the IndirectData option, packets for nodes for which we do not have a meta  connection  with
               are also dropped.

       <u>Forwarding</u> <b>=</b> <b>off</b> | <b>internal</b> | <b>kernel</b> (internal) [experimental]
               This option selects the way indirect packets are forwarded.

               off     Incoming  packets that are not meant for the local node, but which should be forwarded to
                       another node, are dropped.

               internal
                       Incoming packets that are meant for another node are forwarded by tinc internally.

                       This is the default mode, and unless you really know you need  another  forwarding  mode,
                       don't change it.

               kernel  Incoming  packets  are always sent to the TUN/TAP device, even if the packets are not for
                       the local node.  This is less efficient, but allows the kernel to apply its  routing  and
                       firewall rules on them, and can also help debugging.

       <u>GraphDumpFile</u> <b>=</b> <u>filename</u> [experimental]
               If  this  option  is present, <b>tinc</b> will dump the current network graph to the file <u>filename</u> every
               minute, unless there were no changes to the graph.  The file is in a format that can be  read  by
               graphviz  tools.   If  <u>filename</u>  starts  with  a  pipe symbol |, then the rest of the filename is
               interpreted as a shell command that is executed, the graph is then sent to stdin.

       <u>Hostnames</u> <b>=</b> <b>yes</b> | <b>no</b> (no)
               This option selects whether IP addresses (both real and on the VPN) should be resolved. Since DNS
               lookups are blocking, it might affect tinc's efficiency, even  stopping  the  daemon  for  a  few
               seconds every time it does a lookup if your DNS server is not responding.

               This  does  not affect resolving hostnames to IP addresses from the host configuration files, but
               whether hostnames should be resolved while logging.

       <u>IffOneQueue</u> <b>=</b> <b>yes</b> | <b>no</b> (no) [experimental]
               (Linux only) Set IFF_ONE_QUEUE flag on TUN/TAP devices.

       <u>Interface</u> <b>=</b> <u>interface</u>
               Defines the name of the interface corresponding to the virtual network device.  Depending on  the
               operating  system  and  the  type  of  device  this  may  or may not actually set the name of the
               interface.  Under Windows, this variable is used to select which network interface will be  used.
               If you specified a <u>Device</u>, this variable is almost always already correctly set.

       <u>KeyExpire</u> <b>=</b> <u>seconds</u> (3600)
               This  option  controls  the period the encryption keys used to encrypt the data are valid.  It is
               common practice to change keys at regular intervals to make it even  harder  for  crackers,  even
               though it is thought to be nearly impossible to crack a single key.

       <u>LocalDiscovery</u> <b>=</b> <b>yes</b> | <b>no</b> (no) [experimental]
               When  enabled, <b>tinc</b> will try to detect peers that are on the same local network.  This will allow
               direct communication using LAN addresses, even if both peers are  behind  a  NAT  and  they  only
               ConnectTo a third node outside the NAT, which normally would prevent the peers from learning each
               other's LAN address.

               Currently, local discovery is implemented by sending broadcast packets to the LAN during path MTU
               discovery.  This feature may not work in all possible situations.

       <u>MACExpire</u> <b>=</b> <u>seconds</u> (600)
               This  option  controls  the  amount of time MAC addresses are kept before they are removed.  This
               only has effect when <u>Mode</u> is set to "switch".

       <u>MaxTimeout</u> <b>=</b> <u>seconds</u> (900)
               This is the maximum delay before trying to reconnect to other tinc daemons.

       <u>Mode</u> <b>=</b> <b>router</b> | <b>switch</b> | <b>hub</b> (router)
               This option selects the way packets are routed to other daemons.

               router  In this mode <u>Subnet</u> variables in the host configuration files will  be  used  to  form  a
                       routing  table.  Only unicast packets of routable protocols (IPv4 and IPv6) are supported
                       in this mode.

                       This is the default mode, and unless you really know you need another mode, don't  change
                       it.

               switch  In  this  mode  the  MAC  addresses of the packets on the VPN will be used to dynamically
                       create a routing table just  like  an  Ethernet  switch  does.   Unicast,  multicast  and
                       broadcast packets of every protocol that runs over Ethernet are supported in this mode at
                       the cost of frequent broadcast ARP requests and routing table updates.

                       This mode is primarily useful if you want to bridge Ethernet segments.

               hub     This  mode  is  almost  the  same  as  the  switch mode, but instead every packet will be
                       broadcast to the other daemons while no routing table is managed.

       <u>Name</u> <b>=</b> <u>name</u> [required]
               This is the name which identifies this tinc daemon.  It must be unique for  the  virtual  private
               network  this  daemon  will connect to.  The Name may only consist of alphanumeric and underscore
               characters.  If <u>Name</u> starts with a <b>$</b>, then the contents of the environment variable that  follows
               will  be  used.   In  that case, invalid characters will be converted to underscores.  If <u>Name</u> is
               <b>$HOST</b>, but no such environment variable exist, the hostname will be read using the  gethostname()
               system call.

       <u>PingInterval</u> <b>=</b> <u>seconds</u> (60)
               The number of seconds of inactivity that <b>tinc</b> will wait before sending a probe to the other end.

       <u>PingTimeout</u> <b>=</b> <u>seconds</u> (5)
               The  number  of seconds to wait for a response to pings or to allow meta connections to block. If
               the other end doesn't respond within this time, the connection is terminated, and the others will
               be notified of this.

       <u>PriorityInheritance</u> <b>=</b> <b>yes</b> | <b>no</b> (no) [experimental]
               When this option is enabled the value of the TOS field of tunneled IPv4 packets will be inherited
               by the UDP packets that are sent out.

       <u>PrivateKey</u> <b>=</b> <u>key</u> [obsolete]
               The private RSA key of this tinc daemon.  It will allow this tinc daemon to  authenticate  itself
               to other daemons.

       <u>PrivateKeyFile</u> <b>=</b> <u>filename</u> (<u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/rsa_key.priv</u>)
               The file in which the private RSA key of this tinc daemon resides.

       <u>ProcessPriority</u> <b>=</b> <b>low</b> | <b>normal</b> | <b>high</b>
               When  this  option  is  used  the priority of the tincd process will be adjusted.  Increasing the
               priority may help to reduce latency and packet loss on the VPN.

       <u>Proxy</u> <b>=</b> <b>socks4</b> | <b>socks5</b> | <b>http</b> | <b>exec</b> <u>...</u> [experimental]
               Use a proxy when making outgoing connections.  The following proxy types are currently supported:

               socks4 <u>address</u> <u>port</u> [<u>username</u>]
                       Connects to the proxy using the SOCKS version 4 protocol.  Optionally, a <u>username</u> can  be
                       supplied  which  will  be  passed  on  to the proxy server.  Only IPv4 connections can be
                       proxied using SOCKS 4.

               socks5 <u>address</u> <u>port</u> [<u>username</u> <u>password</u>]
                       Connect to the proxy using the SOCKS version 5 protocol.  If a <u>username</u> and <u>password</u>  are
                       given,  basic  username/password authentication will be used, otherwise no authentication
                       will be used.

               http <u>address</u> <u>port</u>
                       Connects to the proxy and sends a HTTP CONNECT request.

               exec <u>command</u>
                       Executes the given <u>command</u> which should set up the outgoing connection.  The  environment
                       variables NAME, NODE, REMOTEADDRES and REMOTEPORT are available.

       <u>ReplayWindow</u> <b>=</b> <u>bytes</u> (16)
               This  is  the size of the replay tracking window for each remote node, in bytes.  The window is a
               bitfield which tracks 1 packet per bit, so for example the default setting of 16 will track up to
               128 packets in the window.  In high bandwidth scenarios, setting  this  to  a  higher  value  can
               reduce  packet  loss  from  the  interaction  of replay tracking with underlying real packet loss
               and/or reordering.  Setting this to zero will disable replay tracking  completely  and  pass  all
               traffic, but leaves tinc vulnerable to replay-based attacks on your traffic.

       <u>StrictSubnets</u> <b>=</b> <b>yes</b> | <b>no</b> (no) [experimental]
               When  this  option  is enabled tinc will only use Subnet statements which are present in the host
               config files in the local <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/hosts/</u> directory. Subnets learned via connections  to
               other nodes and which are not present in the local host config files are ignored.

       <u>TunnelServer</u> <b>=</b> <b>yes</b> | <b>no</b> (no) [experimental]
               When  this  option is enabled tinc will no longer forward information between other tinc daemons,
               and will only allow connections with nodes for which host config files are present in  the  local
               <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/hosts/</u> directory.  Setting this options also implicitly sets StrictSubnets.

       <u>UDPRcvBuf</u> <b>=</b> <u>bytes</u> (OS default)
               Sets  the  socket receive buffer size for the UDP socket, in bytes.  If unset, the default buffer
               size will be used by the operating system.

       <u>UDPSndBuf</u> <b>=</b> <u>bytes</u> (OS default)
               Sets the socket send buffer size for the UDP socket, in bytes.  If unset, the default buffer size
               will be used by the operating system.

</pre><h4><b>HOST</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The host configuration files contain all information needed to establish a connection to those hosts.   A
       host configuration file is also required for the local tinc daemon, it will use it to read in it's listen
       port, public key and subnets.

       The  idea  is  that  these  files  are portable.  You can safely mail your own host configuration file to
       someone else.  That other person can then copy it to his own hosts directory, and  now  his  tinc  daemon
       will be able to connect to your tinc daemon.  Since host configuration files only contain public keys, no
       secrets are revealed by sending out this information.

       <u>Address</u> <b>=</b> <u>address</u> [<u>port</u>] [recommended]
               The  IP address or hostname of this tinc daemon on the real network.  This will only be used when
               trying to make an outgoing connection to this tinc daemon.  Optionally, a port can  be  specified
               to use for this address.  Multiple <u>Address</u> variables can be specified, in which case each address
               will be tried until a working connection has been established.

       <u>Cipher</u> <b>=</b> <u>cipher</u> (aes-256-cbc)
               The  symmetric cipher algorithm used to encrypt UDP packets.  Any cipher supported by LibreSSL or
               OpenSSL is recognised.  Furthermore, specifying "none" will turn off packet  encryption.   It  is
               best to use only those ciphers which support CBC mode.

       <u>ClampMSS</u> <b>=</b> <b>yes</b> | <b>no</b> (yes)
               This  option specifies whether tinc should clamp the maximum segment size (MSS) of TCP packets to
               the path MTU. This helps in situations where ICMP Fragmentation Needed or Packet too Big messages
               are dropped by firewalls.

       <u>Compression</u> <b>=</b> <u>level</u> (0)
               This option sets the level of compression used for UDP packets.  Possible values are 0  (off),  1
               (fast zlib) and any integer up to 9 (best zlib), 10 (fast lzo) and 11 (best lzo).

       <u>Digest</u> <b>=</b> <u>digest</u> (sha256)
               The  digest  algorithm  used  to  authenticate  UDP packets.  Any digest supported by LibreSSL or
               OpenSSL is recognised.  Furthermore, specifying "none" will turn off packet authentication.

       <u>IndirectData</u> <b>=</b> <b>yes</b> | <b>no</b> (no)
               When set to yes, only nodes which already have a meta connection to you  will  try  to  establish
               direct communication with you.  It is best to leave this option out or set it to no.

       <u>MACLength</u> <b>=</b> <u>length</u> (4)
               The  length of the message authentication code used to authenticate UDP packets.  Can be anything
               from "0" up to the length of the digest produced by the digest algorithm.

       <u>PMTU</u> <b>=</b> <u>mtu</u> (1514)
               This option controls the initial path MTU to this node.

       <u>PMTUDiscovery</u> <b>=</b> <b>yes</b> | <b>no</b> (yes)
               When this option is enabled, tinc will try to discover the path MTU to this node.  After the path
               MTU has been discovered, it will be enforced on the VPN.

       <u>Port</u> <b>=</b> <u>port</u> (655)
               The port number on which this tinc daemon is listening for incoming connections, which is used if
               no port number is specified in an <u>Address</u> statement.

       <u>PublicKey</u> <b>=</b> <u>key</u> [obsolete]
               The public RSA key of this tinc daemon.   It  will  be  used  to  cryptographically  verify  it's
               identity and to set up a secure connection.

       <u>PublicKeyFile</u> <b>=</b> <u>filename</u> [obsolete]
               The file in which the public RSA key of this tinc daemon resides.

               From  version 1.0pre4 on <b>tinc</b> will store the public key directly into the host configuration file
               in PEM format, the above two options then are not necessary.  Either the PEM format is  used,  or
               exactly  one  of  the above two options must be specified in each host configuration file, if you
               want to be able to establish a connection with that host.

       <u>Subnet</u> <b>=</b> <u>address</u>[<b>/</b><u>prefixlength</u>[<b>#</b><u>weight</u>]]
               The subnet which this tinc daemon will serve.  <b>tinc</b> tries to look up which other daemon it should
               send a packet to by searching the appropriate subnet.  If the packet matches a subnet, it will be
               sent to the daemon who has this subnet in his host configuration file.  Multiple <u>Subnet</u> variables
               can be specified.

               Subnets can either be single MAC, IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, in which case a  subnet  consisting  of
               only  that  single  address  is  assumed,  or  they  can be a IPv4 or IPv6 network address with a
               prefixlength.  For example, IPv4 subnets must be in a form like 192.168.1.0/24, where 192.168.1.0
               is the network address and 24 is the number of bits set in the netmask.  Note that  subnets  like
               192.168.1.1/24  are  invalid!   Read  a  networking HOWTO/FAQ/guide if you don't understand this.
               IPv6 subnets are notated like fec0:0:0:1::/64.  MAC addresses are notated like 0:1a:2b:3c:4d:5e.

               A Subnet can be given a weight to indicate its priority over identical Subnets owned by different
               nodes.  The default weight is 10. Lower values indicate higher priority. Packets will be sent  to
               the  node  with  the  highest priority, unless that node is not reachable, in which case the node
               with the next highest priority will be tried, and so on.

       <u>TCPOnly</u> <b>=</b> <b>yes</b> | <b>no</b> (no [obsolete])
               If this variable is set to yes, then the packets are tunnelled over the TCP connection instead of
               a UDP connection.  This is especially useful for those who want to run a tinc daemon from  behind
               a masquerading firewall, or if UDP packet routing is disabled somehow.  Setting this options also
               implicitly sets IndirectData.

               Since version 1.0.10, tinc will automatically detect whether communication via UDP is possible or
               not.

</pre><h4><b>SCRIPTS</b></h4><pre>
       Apart from reading the server and host configuration files, tinc can also run scripts at certain moments.
       Below  is a list of filenames of scripts and a description of when they are run.  A script is only run if
       it exists and if it is executable.

       Scripts are run synchronously; this means that tinc will temporarily stop processing  packets  until  the
       called  script  finishes executing.  This guarantees that scripts will execute in the exact same order as
       the events that trigger them.  If you need to run commands asynchronously, you have  to  ensure  yourself
       that they are being run in the background.

       Under Windows (not Cygwin), the scripts must have the extension <u>.bat</u>.

       <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/tinc-up</u>
               This  is  the  most  important script.  If it is present it will be executed right after the tinc
               daemon has been started and has connected to the virtual network device.  It should  be  used  to
               set up the corresponding network interface, but can also be used to start other things.

               Under Windows you can use the Network Connections control panel instead of creating this script.

       <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/tinc-down</u>
               This script is started right before the tinc daemon quits.

       <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/hosts/HOST-up</u>
               This script is started when the tinc daemon with name <u>HOST</u> becomes reachable.

       <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/hosts/HOST-down</u>
               This script is started when the tinc daemon with name <u>HOST</u> becomes unreachable.

       <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/host-up</u>
               This script is started when any host becomes reachable.

       <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/host-down</u>
               This script is started when any host becomes unreachable.

       <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/subnet-up</u>
               This  script  is  started when a Subnet becomes reachable.  The Subnet and the node it belongs to
               are passed in environment variables.

       <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/subnet-down</u>
               This script is started when a Subnet becomes unreachable.

       The scripts are started without  command  line  arguments,  but  can  make  use  of  certain  environment
       variables.   Under UNIX like operating systems the names of environment variables must be preceded by a <b>$</b>
       in scripts.  Under Windows, in <u>.bat</u> files, they have to be put between <b>%</b> signs.

       NETNAME
               If a netname was specified, this environment variable contains it.

       NAME    Contains the name of this tinc daemon.

       DEVICE  Contains the name of the virtual network device that tinc uses.

       INTERFACE
               Contains the name of the virtual network interface that tinc  uses.   This  should  be  used  for
               commands like <u>ifconfig</u>.

       NODE    When  a  host becomes (un)reachable, this is set to its name.  If a subnet becomes (un)reachable,
               this is set to the owner of that subnet.

       REMOTEADDRESS
               When a host becomes (un)reachable, this is set to its real address.

       REMOTEPORT
               When a host becomes (un)reachable, this is set to the port number it uses for communication  with
               other tinc daemons.

       SUBNET  When a subnet becomes (un)reachable, this is set to the subnet.

       WEIGHT  When a subnet becomes (un)reachable, this is set to the subnet weight.

       Do  not  forget  that  under  UNIX  operating systems, you have to make the scripts executable, using the
       command <b>chmod</b> <b>a+x</b> <u>script</u>.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The most important files are:

       <u>/etc/tinc/</u>
               The top directory for configuration files.

       <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/tinc.conf</u>
               The default name of the server configuration file for net <u>NETNAME</u>.

       <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/conf.d/</u>
               Optional directory from which any *.conf file will be loaded

       <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/hosts/</u>
               Host configuration files are kept in this directory.

       <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/tinc-up</u>
               If an executable file with this name exists, it will be executed right after the tinc daemon  has
               connected  to  the  virtual  network  device.  It can be used to set up the corresponding network
               interface.

       <u>/etc/tinc/NETNAME/tinc-down</u>
               If an executable file with this name exists, it will be executed right before the tinc daemon  is
               going to close its connection to the virtual network device.
