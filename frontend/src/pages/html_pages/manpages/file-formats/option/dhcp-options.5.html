</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dhcp-options - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol options

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Dynamic  Host  Configuration  protocol  allows  the  client  to receive <b>options</b> from the DHCP server
       describing the network configuration and various services  that  are  available  on  the  network.   When
       configuring  <b><a href="../man8/dhcpd.8.html">dhcpd</a>(8)</b> or <b><a href="../man8/dhclient.8.html">dhclient</a>(8)</b> <b>,</b> options must often be declared.  The syntax for declaring options,
       and the names and formats of the options that can be declared, are documented here.

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCE:</b> <b>OPTION</b> <b>STATEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       DHCP <u>option</u> statements always start with the <u>option</u> keyword, followed by  an  option  name,  followed  by
       option data.  The option names and data formats are described below.  It is not necessary to exhaustively
       specify all DHCP options - only those options which are needed by clients must be specified.

       Option data comes in a variety of formats, as defined below:

       The  <b>ip-address</b>  data type can be entered either as an explicit IP address (e.g., 239.254.197.10) or as a
       domain name (e.g., haagen.isc.org).  When entering a domain name, be sure that that domain name  resolves
       to  a  single IP address. Additionally, please note the software (dhcpd or dhclient) will only attempt to
       resolve the domain name the first time the option is needed. For example, if the  next-server  option  is
       defined  as  a  domain  name, dhcpd will attempt to resolve it while responding to the first client query
       dhcpd receives after startup. Should the domain's address subsequently change, the  software  has  to  be
       restarted in order to pick up the change.

       The <b>ip6-address</b> data specifies an IPv6 address, like ::1 or 3ffe:bbbb:aaaa:aaaa::1.

       The <b>int32</b> data type specifies a signed 32-bit integer.  The <b>uint32</b> data type specifies an unsigned 32-bit
       integer.   The  <b>int16</b>  and  <b>uint16</b>  data types specify signed and unsigned 16-bit integers.  The <b>int8</b> and
       <b>uint8</b> data types specify signed and unsigned 8-bit integers.  Unsigned 8-bit integers are also  sometimes
       referred to as octets.

       The  <b>text</b> data type specifies an NVT ASCII string, which must be enclosed in double quotes - for example,
       to specify a root-path option, the syntax would be

       option root-path "10.0.1.4:/var/tmp/rootfs";

       The <b>domain-name</b> data type specifies a domain name, which must not be  enclosed  in  double  quotes.   The
       domain name is stored just as if it were a text option.

       The  <b>domain-list</b>  data  type specifies a list of domain names, enclosed in double quotes and separated by
       commas ("example.com", "foo.example.com").

       The <b>flag</b> data type specifies a boolean value.  Booleans can be either true or false (or  on  or  off,  if
       that makes more sense to you).

       The  <b>string</b>  data  type  specifies  either  an NVT ASCII string enclosed in double quotes, or a series of
       octets specified in hexadecimal, separated by colons.  For example:

         option dhcp-client-identifier "CLIENT-FOO";
       or
         option dhcp-client-identifier 43:4c:49:45:54:2d:46:4f:4f;

</pre><h4><b>SETTING</b> <b>OPTION</b> <b>VALUES</b> <b>USING</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Sometimes it's helpful to be able to set the value of a DHCP option based on some value that  the  client
       has  sent.  To do this, you can use expression evaluation.  The <b><a href="../man5/dhcp-eval.5.html">dhcp-eval</a>(5)</b> manual page describes how to
       write expressions.  To assign the result of an evaluation to an option, define the option as follows:

         <b>option</b> <u>my-option</u> <b>=</b> <u>expression</u> <b>;</b>

       For example:

         option hostname = binary-to-ascii (16, 8, "-",
                                            substring (hardware, 1, 6));

</pre><h4><b>INCLUDING</b> <b>OPTION</b> <b>DEFINITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Starting with 4.3.0 when ISC adds new option definitions those definitions will be included in  the  code
       based  on  the  definition  of  an argument for the RFC that defines the option in includes/site.h.  This
       provides you with a method for over-riding the ISC definitions if necessary - for  example  if  you  have
       previously  defined  the  option  with  a  different format using the mechanism from DEFINING NEW OPTIONS
       below.

       By default all of the  options  are  enabled.   In  order  to  disable  an  option  you  would  edit  the
       includes/site.h file and comment out the definition for the proper RFC.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>DHCPV4</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The documentation for the various options mentioned below is taken from the latest IETF draft document on
       DHCP  options.   Options  not  listed  below  may  not yet be implemented, but it is possible to use such
       options by defining them in the configuration file.  Please see the DEFINING NEW OPTIONS heading later in
       this document for more information.

       Some of the options documented here are automatically generated by the DHCP server  or  by  clients,  and
       cannot  be  configured by the user.  The value of such an option can be used in the configuration file of
       the receiving DHCP protocol agent (server or client), for example in  conditional  expressions.  However,
       the  value of the option cannot be used in the configuration file of the sending agent, because the value
       is determined only <u>after</u> the configuration file has been processed. In the following documentation,  such
       options will be shown as "not user configurable"

       The standard options are:

       <b>option</b> <b>all-subnets-local</b> <u>flag</u><b>;</b>

         This  option specifies whether or not the client may assume that all subnets of the IP network to which
         the client is connected use the same MTU as the subnet of that network to which the client is  directly
         connected.  A value of true indicates that all subnets share the same MTU.  A value of false means that
         the client should assume that some subnets of the directly connected network may have smaller MTUs.

       <b>option</b> <b>arp-cache-timeout</b> <u>uint32</u><b>;</b>

         This option specifies the timeout in seconds for ARP cache entries.

       <b>option</b> <b>associated-ip</b> <u>ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>... ]<b>;</b>

         This  option  is  part  of lease query.  It is used to return all of the IP addresses associated with a
         given DHCP client.

         This option is not user configurable.

       <b>option</b> <b>bcms-controller-address</b> <u>ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>... ]<b>;</b>

         This option configures a list of IPv4 addresses for use as Broadcast and Multicast  Controller  Servers
         ("BCMS").

       <b>option</b> <b>bcms-controller-names</b> <u>domain-list</u><b>;</b>

         This  option  contains  the  domain  names of local Broadcast and Multicast Controller Servers ("BCMS")
         controllers which the client may use.

       <b>option</b> <b>bootfile-name</b> <u>text</u><b>;</b>

         This option is used to identify a bootstrap file.  If supported by the client, it should have the  same
         effect  as  the  <b>filename</b>  declaration.   BOOTP clients are unlikely to support this option.  Some DHCP
         clients will support it, and others actually require it.

       <b>option</b> <b>boot-size</b> <u>uint16</u><b>;</b>

         This option specifies the length in 512-octet blocks of the default boot image for the client.

       <b>option</b> <b>broadcast-address</b> <u>ip-address</u><b>;</b>

         This option specifies the broadcast address in use on the client's subnet.  Legal values for  broadcast
         addresses are specified in section 3.2.1.3 of STD 3 (RFC1122).

       <b>option</b> <b>capwap-ac-v4</b> <u>ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u> ... ] <b>;</b>

         A  list  of  IPv4 addresses of CAPWAP ACs that the WTP may use.  The addresses are listed in preference
         order.

         This option is included based on RFC 5417.

       <b>option</b> <b>client-last-transaction-time</b> <u>uint32</u><b>;</b>

         This option is part of lease query.  It allows the receiver to determine the time of  the  most  recent
         access  by  the client.  The value is a duration in seconds from when the client last communicated with
         the DHCP server.

         This option is not user configurable.

       <b>option</b> <b>cookie-servers</b> <u>ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>...  ]<b>;</b>

         The cookie server option specifies a list of RFC 865 cookie servers available to the  client.   Servers
         should be listed in order of preference.

       <b>option</b> <b>default-ip-ttl</b> <u>uint8;</u>

         This option specifies the default time-to-live that the client should use on outgoing datagrams.

       <b>option</b> <b>default-tcp-ttl</b> <u>uint8</u><b>;</b>

         This  option  specifies  the  default  TTL  that  the client should use when sending TCP segments.  The
         minimum value is 1.

       <b>option</b> <b>default-url</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         The format and meaning of this option is not described in any standards document, but is claimed to  be
         in use by Apple Computer.  It is not known what clients may reasonably do if supplied with this option.
         Use at your own risk.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp-client-identifier</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         This  option  can  be used to specify a DHCP client identifier in a host declaration, so that dhcpd can
         find the host record by matching against the client identifier.

         Please be aware that some DHCP clients, when configured with client identifiers that  are  ASCII  text,
         will prepend a zero to the ASCII text.  So you may need to write:

              option dhcp-client-identifier "\0foo";

         rather than:

              option dhcp-client-identifier "foo";

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp-lease-time</b> <u>uint32</u><b>;</b>

         This  option is used in a client request (DHCPDISCOVER or DHCPREQUEST) to allow the client to request a
         lease time for the IP address.  In a server reply (DHCPOFFER),  a  DHCP  server  uses  this  option  to
         specify the lease time it is willing to offer.

         This  option  is not directly user configurable in the server; refer to the <u>max-lease-time</u> and <u>default-</u>
         <u>lease-time</u> server options in <b><a href="../man5/dhcpd.conf.5.html">dhcpd.conf</a>(5).</b>

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp-max-message-size</b> <u>uint16</u><b>;</b>

         This option, when sent by the client, specifies the maximum size of any response that the server  sends
         to  the  client.   When  specified  on  the  server, if the client did not send a dhcp-max-message-size
         option, the size specified on the server is used.  This works for BOOTP as well as DHCP responses.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp-message</b> <u>text</u><b>;</b>

         This option is used by a DHCP server to provide an error message to a DHCP client in a DHCPNAK  message
         in  the  event  of a failure. A client may use this option in a DHCPDECLINE message to indicate why the
         client declined the offered parameters.

         This option is not user configurable.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp-message-type</b> <u>uint8</u><b>;</b>

         This option, sent by both client and server, specifies the type of DHCP message contained in  the  DHCP
         packet. Possible values (taken directly from RFC2132) are:

                      1     DHCPDISCOVER
                      2     DHCPOFFER
                      3     DHCPREQUEST
                      4     DHCPDECLINE
                      5     DHCPACK
                      6     DHCPNAK
                      7     DHCPRELEASE
                      8     DHCPINFORM

         This option is not user configurable.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp-option-overload</b> <u>uint8</u><b>;</b>

         This  option  is  used to indicate that the DHCP ´sname´ or ´file´ fields are being overloaded by using
         them to carry DHCP options. A DHCP server inserts this option if the returned  parameters  will  exceed
         the usual space allotted for options.

         If  this  option  is  present, the client interprets the specified additional fields after it concludes
         interpretation of the standard option fields.

         Legal values for this option are:

                      1     the ´file´ field is used to hold options
                      2     the ´sname´ field is used to hold options
                      3     both fields are used to hold options

         This option is not user configurable.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp-parameter-request-list</b> <u>uint8</u> [<b>,</b> <u>uint8</u>... ]<b>;</b>

         This option, when sent by the client, specifies which options the client wishes the server  to  return.
         Normally,  in  the  ISC  DHCP  client, this is done using the <u>request</u> statement.  If this option is not
         specified by the client, the DHCP server will normally return every option that is valid in  scope  and
         that  fits  into  the  reply.   When  this  option  is  specified on the server, the server returns the
         specified options.  This can be used to force a client to take options that it hasn't requested, and it
         can also be used to tailor the response of the DHCP server for clients that may need a more limited set
         of options than those the server would normally return.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp-rebinding-time</b> <u>uint32</u><b>;</b>

         This option specifies the number of seconds from the time a client gets an  address  until  the  client
         transitions to the REBINDING state.

         This  option  is user configurable, but it will be ignored if the value is greater than or equal to the
         lease time.

         To make DHCPv4+DHCPv6 migration easier in the future, any value configured in this option is also  used
         as a DHCPv6 "T1" (renew) time.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp-renewal-time</b> <u>uint32</u><b>;</b>

         This  option  specifies  the  number of seconds from the time a client gets an address until the client
         transitions to the RENEWING state.

         This option is user configurable, but it will be ignored if the value is greater than or equal  to  the
         rebinding time, or lease time.

         To  make DHCPv4+DHCPv6 migration easier in the future, any value configured in this option is also used
         as a DHCPv6 "T2" (rebind) time.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp-requested-address</b> <u>ip-address</u><b>;</b>

         This option is used by the client in a  DHCPDISCOVER  to  request  that  a  particular  IP  address  be
         assigned.

         This option is not user configurable.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp-server-identifier</b> <u>ip-address</u><b>;</b>

         This  option  is  used  in  DHCPOFFER  and  DHCPREQUEST messages, and may optionally be included in the
         DHCPACK and DHCPNAK messages.  DHCP servers include this option in the DHCPOFFER in order to allow  the
         client  to  distinguish between lease offers.  DHCP clients use the contents of the ´server identifier´
         field as the destination address for any DHCP messages unicast to the DHCP server.  DHCP  clients  also
         indicate  which  of  several  lease  offers is being accepted by including this option in a DHCPREQUEST
         message.

         The value of this option is the IP address of the server.

         This  option  is  not  directly  user  configurable.  See  the  <u>server-identifier</u>  server   option   in
         <u><a href="../man5/dhcpd.conf.5.html">dhcpd.conf</a>(5).</u>

       <b>option</b> <b>domain-name</b> <u>text</u><b>;</b>

         This  option  specifies  the domain name that client should use when resolving hostnames via the Domain
         Name System.

       <b>option</b> <b>domain-name-servers</b> <u>ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>...  ]<b>;</b>

         The domain-name-servers option specifies a list of Domain Name System (STD 13, RFC 1035)  name  servers
         available to the client.  Servers should be listed in order of preference.

       <b>option</b> <b>domain-search</b> <u>domain-list</u><b>;</b>

         The  domain-search  option specifies a ´search list´ of Domain Names to be used by the client to locate
         not-fully-qualified domain names.  The difference between this option and historic use of  the  domain-
         name  option for the same ends is that this option is encoded in RFC1035 compressed labels on the wire.
         For example:

           option domain-search "example.com", "sales.example.com",
                                "eng.example.com";

       <b>option</b> <b>extensions-path</b> <u>text</u><b>;</b>

         This option specifies the name of a file containing additional options to be interpreted  according  to
         the DHCP option format as specified in RFC2132.

       <b>option</b> <b>finger-server</b> <u>ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>... ]<b>;</b>

         The Finger server option specifies a list of Finger servers available to the client.  Servers should be
         listed in order of preference.

       <b>option</b> <b>font-servers</b> <u>ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>...  ]<b>;</b>

         This option specifies a list of X Window System Font servers available to the client. Servers should be
         listed in order of preference.

       <b>option</b> <b>geoconf-civic</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         A string to hold the geoconf civic structure.

         This option is included based on RFC 4776.

       <b>option</b> <b>host-name</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         This  option  specifies  the  name  of the client.  The name may or may not be qualified with the local
         domain name (it is preferable to use the domain-name option to specify the domain name).  See RFC  1035
         for  character set restrictions.  This option is only honored by <b><a href="../man8/dhclient-script.8.html">dhclient-script</a>(8)</b> if the hostname for
         the client machine is not set.

       <b>option</b> <b>ieee802-3-encapsulation</b> <u>flag</u><b>;</b>

         This option specifies whether or not the client should use Ethernet Version 2 (RFC 894) or  IEEE  802.3
         (RFC  1042)  encapsulation if the interface is an Ethernet.  A value of false indicates that the client
         should use RFC 894 encapsulation.  A  value  of  true  means  that  the  client  should  use  RFC  1042
         encapsulation.

       <b>option</b> <b>ien116-name-servers</b> <u>ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>...  ];

         The  ien116-name-servers  option  specifies  a  list  of  IEN 116 name servers available to the client.
         Servers should be listed in order of preference.

       <b>option</b> <b>impress-servers</b> <u>ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>...  ]<b>;</b>

         The impress-server option specifies a list of Imagen Impress servers available to the client.   Servers
         should be listed in order of preference.

       <b>option</b> <b>interface-mtu</b> <u>uint16</u><b>;</b>

         This option specifies the MTU to use on this interface.  The minimum legal value for the MTU is 68.

       <b>option</b> <b>ip-forwarding</b> <u>flag</u><b>;</b>

         This  option specifies whether the client should configure its IP layer for packet forwarding.  A value
         of false means disable IP forwarding, and a value of true means enable IP forwarding.

       <b>option</b> <b>irc-server</b> <u>ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>... ]<b>;</b>

         The IRC server option specifies a list of IRC servers available  to  the  client.   Servers  should  be
         listed in order of preference.

       <b>option</b> <b>loader-configfile</b> <u>text</u>

         This option is used to specify a boot loading configuration file a PXE client should use.

         This option is included based on RFC 5071.

       <b>option</b> <b>loader-pathprefix</b> <u>text</u>

         This  option is used to specify a path prefix a PXE client should use in conjunction with the boot load
         configuration file.

         This option is included based on RFC 5071.

       <b>option</b> <b>loader-reboottime</b> <u>uint32</u>

         This option is used to dictate the maximum amount of time a PXE client should allow itself  to  achieve
         configured network resources before rebooting.

         This option is included based on RFC 5071.

       <b>option</b> <b>log-servers</b> <u>ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>...  ]<b>;</b>

         The  log-server  option  specifies  a list of MIT-LCS UDP log servers available to the client.  Servers
         should be listed in order of preference.

       <b>option</b> <b>lpr-servers</b> <u>ip-address</u>  [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>...  ]<b>;</b>

         The LPR server option specifies a list of RFC 1179  line  printer  servers  available  to  the  client.
         Servers should be listed in order of preference.

       <b>option</b> <b>mask-supplier</b> <u>flag</u><b>;</b>

         This  option  specifies whether or not the client should respond to subnet mask requests using ICMP.  A
         value of false indicates that the client should not respond.  A value of true  means  that  the  client
         should respond.

       <b>option</b> <b>max-dgram-reassembly</b> <u>uint16</u><b>;</b>

         This  option specifies the maximum size datagram that the client should be prepared to reassemble.  The

         This  option  specifies  whether  or not the client should perform subnet mask discovery using ICMP.  A
         value of false indicates that the client should not perform mask discovery.  A value of true means that
         the client should perform mask discovery.

       <b>option</b> <b>policy-filter</b> <u>ip-address</u> <u>ip-address</u>
                         [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u> <u>ip-address</u>...]<b>;</b>

         This option specifies policy filters for non-local source routing.  The filters consist of a list of IP
         addresses and masks which specify destination/mask pairs with which to filter incoming source routes.

         Any source routed datagram whose next-hop address does not match one of the filters should be discarded
         by the client.

         This option is included based on RFC 6731.

       <b>option</b> <b>resource-location-servers</b> <u>ip-address</u>
                                     [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>...]<b>;</b>

         This option specifies a list of RFC 887 Resource Location servers available  to  the  client.   Servers
         should be listed in order of preference.

       <b>option</b> <b>root-path</b> <u>text</u><b>;</b>

         This  option  specifies the path-name that contains the client's root disk.  The path is formatted as a
         character string consisting of characters from the NVT ASCII character set.

       <b>option</b> <b>router-discovery</b> <u>flag</u><b>;</b>

         This option specifies whether or not the client should  solicit  routers  using  the  Router  Discovery
         mechanism  defined  in  RFC 1256.  A value of false indicates that the client should not perform router
         discovery.  A value of true means that the client should perform router discovery.

       <b>option</b> <b>router-solicitation-address</b> <u>ip-address</u><b>;</b>

         This option specifies the address to which the client should transmit router solicitation requests.

       <b>option</b> <b>routers</b> <u>ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>...  ]<b>;</b>

         be listed in order of preference.

       <b>option</b> <b>slp-directory-agent</b> <u>boolean</u> <u>ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>... ]<b>;</b>

         This option specifies two things: the IP addresses of one or more Service Location  Protocol  Directory
         Agents, and whether the use of these addresses is mandatory.  If the initial boolean value is true, the
         SLP  agent  should  just  use  the  IP  addresses  given.   If  the  value  is false, the SLP agent may
         additionally do active or passive multicast discovery of SLP agents (see RFC2165 for details).

         Please note that in this option and the slp-service-scope option, the term "SLP Agent" is being used to
         refer to a Service Location Protocol agent running on a machine that is being configured using the DHCP
         protocol.

         Also, please be aware that some companies may refer to SLP as NDS.  If you have an NDS directory  agent
         whose address you need to configure, the slp-directory-agent option should work.

       <b>option</b> <b>slp-service-scope</b> <u>boolean</u> <u>text</u><b>;</b>

         The  Service  Location Protocol Service Scope Option specifies two things: a list of service scopes for
         SLP, and whether the use of this list is mandatory.  If the initial boolean  value  is  true,  the  SLP
         agent  should only use the list of scopes provided in this option; otherwise, it may use its own static
         configuration in preference to the list provided in this option.

         The text string should be a comma-separated list of scopes that the SLP agent should use.   It  may  be
         omitted,  in  which  case  the SLP Agent will use the aggregated list of scopes of all directory agents
         known to the SLP agent.

       <b>option</b> <b>smtp-server</b> <u>ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>... ]<b>;</b>

         The SMTP server option specifies a list of SMTP servers available to the  client.   Servers  should  be
         listed in order of preference.

       <b>option</b> <b>static-routes</b> <u>ip-address</u> <u>ip-address</u>
                         [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u> <u>ip-address</u>...]<b>;</b>

         This  option specifies a list of static routes that the client should install in its routing cache.  If
         multiple routes to the same destination are specified, they are listed in descending order of priority.

         The routes consist of a list of IP address pairs.  The first address is the  destination  address,  and
         the second address is the router for the destination.

         The  default  route  (0.0.0.0)  is  an  illegal destination for a static route.  To specify the default
         route, use the <b>routers</b> option.  Also, please note that this option is not  intended  for  classless  IP
         routing  -  it  does  not  include  a  subnet  mask.  Since classless IP routing is now the most widely
         deployed routing standard, this option is virtually useless, and is  not  implemented  by  any  of  the
         popular DHCP clients, for example the Microsoft DHCP client.

       <b>option</b> <b>streettalk-directory-assistance-server</b> <u>ip-address</u>
                                                  [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>...]<b>;</b>

         The  StreetTalk Directory Assistance (STDA) server option specifies a list of STDA servers available to
         the client.  Servers should be listed in order of preference.

       <b>option</b> <b>streettalk-server</b> <u>ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>... ]<b>;</b>

         The StreetTalk server option specifies a list of StreetTalk servers available to the  client.   Servers
         should be listed in order of preference.

       <b>option</b> <b>subnet-mask</b> <u>ip-address</u><b>;</b>

         The  subnet mask option specifies the client's subnet mask as per RFC 950.  If no subnet mask option is
         provided anywhere in scope, as a last resort dhcpd will use the subnet mask from the subnet declaration
         for the network on which an address is being assigned.  However,  <u>any</u>  subnet-mask  option  declaration
         that  is  in scope for the address being assigned will override the subnet mask specified in the subnet
         declaration.

       <b>option</b> <b>subnet-selection</b> <u>ip-address</u><b>;</b>

         Sent by the client if an address is required in a subnet other than the  one  that  would  normally  be
         selected  (based  on  the  relaying  address of the connected subnet the request is obtained from). See
         RFC3011. Note that the option number used by this server is 118; this has not always been  the  defined
         number,  and  some clients may use a different value. Use of this option should be regarded as slightly
         experimental!

       This option is not user configurable in the server.

       <b>option</b> <b>swap-server</b> <u>ip-address</u><b>;</b>

         This specifies the IP address of the client's swap server.

       <b>option</b> <b>tftp-server-address</b> <u>ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>... ]<b>;</b>

         This option configures a list of one or more IPv4 addresses of tftp servers a client may use.

         This option is included based on RFC 5859

       <b>option</b> <b>tcp-keepalive-garbage</b> <u>flag</u><b>;</b>

         This option specifies whether or not the client should send TCP keepalive messages  with  an  octet  of
         garbage  for compatibility with older implementations.  A value of false indicates that a garbage octet
         should not be sent. A value of true indicates that a garbage octet should be sent.

       <b>option</b> <b>tcp-keepalive-interval</b> <u>uint32</u><b>;</b>

         This option specifies the interval (in seconds) that the  client  TCP  should  wait  before  sending  a
         keepalive message on a TCP connection.  The time is specified as a 32-bit unsigned integer.  A value of
         zero  indicates  that  the  client  should  not  generate  keepalive  messages  on  connections  unless
         specifically requested by an application.

       <b>option</b> <b>tcode</b> <u>text</u><b>;</b>

         This option specifies a name of a zone entry in the TZ database.

         This option is included based on RFC 4833.

       <b>option</b> <b>tftp-server-name</b> <u>text</u><b>;</b>

         This option is used to identify a TFTP server and, if supported by the client,  should  have  the  same
         effect  as  the <b>server-name</b> declaration.  BOOTP clients are unlikely to support this option.  Some DHCP
         clients will support it, and others actually require it.

       <b>option</b> <b>time-offset</b> <u>int32</u><b>;</b>

         The time-offset option specifies the  offset  of  the  client's  subnet  in  seconds  from  Coordinated
         Universal Time (UTC).

       <b>option</b> <b>time-servers</b> <u>ip-address</u> [, <u>ip-address</u>...  ]<b>;</b>

         The  time-server  option  specifies  a  list  of RFC 868 time servers available to the client.  Servers
         should be listed in order of preference.

       <b>option</b> <b>trailer-encapsulation</b> <u>flag</u><b>;</b>

         This option specifies whether or not the client should negotiate the use of  trailers  (RFC  893  [14])
         when  using  the  ARP  protocol.   A value of false indicates that the client should not attempt to use
         trailers.  A value of true means that the client should attempt to use trailers.

       <b>option</b> <b>uap-servers</b> <u>text</u><b>;</b>

         This option specifies a list of URLs, each pointing to a user authentication service that is capable of
         processing authentication requests encapsulated in the User Authentication Protocol (UAP).  UAP servers
         can accept either HTTP 1.1 or SSLv3 connections.  If the list includes a URL that does  not  contain  a
         port component, the normal default port is assumed (i.e., port 80 for http and port 443 for https).  If
         the list includes a URL that does not contain a path component, the path /uap is assumed.  If more than
         one URL is specified in this list, the URLs are separated by spaces.

       <b>option</b> <b>user-class</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         This  option  is used by some DHCP clients as a way for users to specify identifying information to the
         client.  This can be used in a similar way to the vendor-class-identifier option, but the value of  the
         option  is  specified  by  the  user,  not the vendor.  Most recent DHCP clients have a way in the user
         interface to specify the value for this identifier, usually as a text string.

       <b>option</b> <b>v4-access-domain</b> <u>domain-name</u><b>;</b>

         The domain name associated with the access network for use with LIS Discovery.

         This option is included based on RFC 5986.

       <b>option</b> <b>v4-lost</b> <u>domain-name</u><b>;</b>

         The domain name of the LoST server for the client to use.

         This option is included based on RFC 5223.

       <b>option</b> <b>v6-only-preferred</b> <u>uint32</u><b>;</b>

         The number of seconds the client should disable DHCPv4 for.

         This option and its use by the client are specified in RFC 8925.

       <b>option</b> <b>vendor-class-identifier</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         This option is used by some DHCP clients to identify the vendor type and possibly the configuration  of
         a  DHCP client.  The information is a string of bytes whose contents are specific to the vendor and are
         not specified in a standard.  To see what vendor class identifier clients are sending,  you  can  write
         the following in your DHCP server configuration file:

         set vendor-string = option vendor-class-identifier;

         This  will  result  in all entries in the DHCP server lease database file for clients that sent vendor-
         class-identifier options having a set statement that looks something like this:

         set vendor-string = "SUNW.Ultra-5_10";

         The vendor-class-identifier option is normally used by the DHCP server to determine  the  options  that
         are  returned  in  the  <b>vendor-encapsulated-options</b> option.  Please see the VENDOR ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS
         section later in this manual page for further information.

       <b>option</b> <b>vendor-encapsulated-options</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         The <b>vendor-encapsulated-options</b> option can contain either a single vendor-specific value or one or more
         vendor-specific suboptions.  This option is not normally specified in  the  DHCP  server  configuration
         file  - instead, a vendor class is defined for each vendor, vendor class suboptions are defined, values
         for those suboptions are defined, and the DHCP server makes up a response on that basis.

         Some default behaviours for well-known DHCP client vendors (currently, the Microsoft Windows 2000  DHCP
         client)  are  configured automatically, but otherwise this must be configured manually - see the VENDOR
         ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS section later in this manual page for details.

       <b>option</b> <b>vivso</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         The <b>vivso</b> option can contain multiple separate options,  one  for  each  32-bit  Enterprise  ID.   Each
         Enterprise-ID  discriminated  option  then  contains  additional options whose format is defined by the
         vendor who holds that ID.  This option is usually not configured manually, but rather is configured via
         intervening option definitions.  Please also see the VENDOR ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS section later in  this
         manual page for details.

       <b>option</b> <b>www-server</b> <u>ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>... ]<b>;</b>

         The  WWW  server  option  specifies  a  list of WWW servers available to the client.  Servers should be
         listed in order of preference.

       <b>option</b> <b>x-display-manager</b> <u>ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>...  ]<b>;</b>

         This option specifies a list of systems that are running the X Window System Display  Manager  and  are
         available to the client.  Addresses should be listed in order of preference.

       An IETF draft, draft-ietf-dhc-agent-options-11.txt, defines a series of encapsulated options that a relay
       agent  can  add  to  a DHCP packet when relaying it to the DHCP server.  The server can then make address
       allocation decisions (or whatever other decisions it wants) based on  these  options.   The  server  also
       returns  these  options  in any replies it sends through the relay agent, so that the relay agent can use
       the information in these options for delivery or accounting purposes.

       The current draft defines two options.  To reference these options in the dhcp server, specify the option
       space name, "agent", followed by a period, followed by the option name.  It is  not  normally  useful  to
       define  values  for  these  options  in  the  server,  although it is permissible.  These options are not
       supported in the client.

       <b>option</b> <b>agent.circuit-id</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         The circuit-id suboption encodes an agent-local identifier of the circuit from which a DHCP  client-to-
         server  packet  was  received.  It is intended for use by agents in relaying DHCP responses back to the
         proper circuit.  The format of this option is  currently  defined  to  be  vendor-dependent,  and  will
         probably  remain  that  way, although the current draft allows for the possibility of standardizing the
         format in the future.

       <b>option</b> <b>agent.remote-id</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         The remote-id suboption encodes information about the remote host end of a circuit.  Examples  of  what
         it  might  contain include caller ID information, username information, remote ATM address, cable modem
         ID, and similar things.  In principal, the meaning is not well-specified, and it  should  generally  be
         assumed  to be an opaque object that is administratively guaranteed to be unique to a particular remote
         end of a circuit.

       <b>option</b> <b>agent.DOCSIS-device-class</b> <u>uint32</u><b>;</b>

         The DOCSIS-device-class suboption is intended to convey information about the host endpoint,  hardware,
         and  software,  that  either the host operating system or the DHCP server may not otherwise be aware of
         (but the relay is able to distinguish).  This is implemented as a 32-bit field  (4  octets),  each  bit
         representing  a  flag describing the host in one of these ways.  So far, only bit zero (being the least
         significant bit) is defined in RFC3256.  If this bit is set to  one,  the  host  is  considered  a  CPE
         Controlled Cable Modem (CCCM).  All other bits are reserved.

       <b>option</b> <b>agent.link-selection</b> <u>ip-address</u><b>;</b>

         The  link-selection  suboption  is provided by relay agents to inform servers what subnet the client is
         actually attached to.  This is useful in those cases where the giaddr (where responses must be sent  to
         the relay agent) is not on the same subnet as the client.  When this option is present in a packet from
         a  relay  agent,  the DHCP server will use its contents to find a subnet declared in configuration, and
         from here take one step further backwards to any shared-network the subnet may be defined  within;  the
         client may be given any address within that shared network, as normally appropriate.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>CLIENT</b> <b>FQDN</b> <b>SUBOPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  Client FQDN option, currently defined in the Internet Draft draft-ietf-dhc-fqdn-option-00.txt is not
       a standard yet, but is in sufficiently wide use  already  that  we  have  implemented  it.   Due  to  the
       complexity of the option format, we have implemented it as a suboption space rather than a single option.
       In  general  this  option  should not be configured by the user - instead it should be used as part of an
       automatic DNS update system.

       <b>option</b> <b>fqdn.no-client-update</b> <u>flag</u><b>;</b>

         When the client sends this, if it is true, it means the client will not attempt to update its A record.
         When sent by the server to the client, it means that the client <u>should</u> <u>not</u> update its own A record.

       <b>option</b> <b>fqdn.server-update</b> <u>flag</u><b>;</b>

         When the client sends this to the server, it is requesting that the server update its A  record.   When
         sent by the server, it means that the server has updated (or is about to update) the client's A record.

       <b>option</b> <b>fqdn.encoded</b> <u>flag</u><b>;</b>

         If  true,  this  indicates  that  the domain name included in the option is encoded in DNS wire format,
         rather than as plain ASCII text.  The client normally sets this to false if it doesn't support DNS wire
         format in the FQDN option.  The server should always send back the same value  that  the  client  sent.
         When  this  value  is  set  on  the  configuration  side, it controls the format in which the <u>fqdn.fqdn</u>
         suboption is encoded.

       <b>option</b> <b>fqdn.rcode1</b> <u>flag</u><b>;</b>

       <b>option</b> <b>fqdn.rcode2</b> <u>flag</u><b>;</b>

         These options specify the result of the updates of the A and PTR records, respectively,  and  are  only
         sent  by  the  DHCP server to the DHCP client.  The values of these fields are those defined in the DNS
         protocol specification.

       <b>option</b> <b>fqdn.fqdn</b> <u>text</u><b>;</b>

         Specifies the domain name that the client wishes to use.  This can be a fully-qualified domain name, or
         a single label.  If there is no trailing ´.´ character in the name, it is not fully-qualified, and  the
         server will generally update that name in some locally-defined domain.

       <b>option</b> <b>fqdn.hostname</b> <u>--never</u> <u>set--</u><b>;</b>

         This  option  should never be set, but it can be read back using the <b>option</b> and <b>config-option</b> operators
         in an expression, in which case it returns the first label in the <b>fqdn.fqdn</b> suboption - for example, if
         the value of <b>fqdn.fqdn</b> is "foo.example.com.", then <b>fqdn.hostname</b> will be "foo".

       <b>option</b> <b>fqdn.domainname</b> <u>--never</u> <u>set--</u><b>;</b>

         This option should never be set, but it can be read back using the <b>option</b> and  <b>config-option</b>  operators
         in  an expression, in which case it returns all labels after the first label in the <b>fqdn.fqdn</b> suboption
         - for example,  if  the  value  of  <b>fqdn.fqdn</b>  is  "foo.example.com.",  then  <b>fqdn.domainname</b>  will  be
         "example.com.".   If this suboption value is not set, it means that an unqualified name was sent in the
         <b>fqdn</b> option, or that no <b>fqdn</b> option was sent at all.

       If you wish to use any of these suboptions, we strongly recommend that  you  refer  to  the  Client  FQDN
       option draft (or standard, when it becomes a standard) - the documentation here is sketchy and incomplete
       in comparison, and is just intended for reference by people who already understand the Client FQDN option
       specification.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>NETWARE/IP</b> <b>SUBOPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       RFC2242 defines a set of encapsulated options for Novell NetWare/IP clients.  To use these options in the
       dhcp  server,  specify  the option space name, "nwip", followed by a period, followed by the option name.
       The following options can be specified:

       <b>option</b> <b>nwip.nsq-broadcast</b> <u>flag</u><b>;</b>

         If true, the client should use the NetWare Nearest Server Query to locate  a  NetWare/IP  server.   The
         behaviour of the Novell client if this suboption is false, or is not present, is not specified.

       <b>option</b> <b>nwip.preferred-dss</b> <u>ip-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>... ]<b>;</b>

         This suboption specifies a list of up to five IP addresses, each of which should be the IP address of a
         NetWare Domain SAP/RIP server (DSS).

       <b>option</b> <b>nwip.nearest-nwip-server</b> <u>ip-address</u>
                                    [<b>,</b> <u>ip-address</u>...]<b>;</b>

         This suboption specifies a list of up to five IP addresses, each of which should be the IP address of a
         Nearest NetWare IP server.

       <b>option</b> <b>nwip.autoretries</b> <u>uint8</u><b>;</b>

         Specifies  the  number of times that a NetWare/IP client should attempt to communicate with a given DSS
         server at startup.

       <b>option</b> <b>nwip.autoretry-secs</b> <u>uint8</u><b>;</b>

         Specifies the number of seconds that a Netware/IP client should wait between retries when attempting to
         establish communications with a DSS server at startup.

       <b>option</b> <b>nwip.nwip-1-1</b> <u>uint8</u><b>;</b>

         If true, the NetWare/IP client should support NetWare/IP  version  1.1  compatibility.   This  is  only
         needed if the client will be contacting Netware/IP version 1.1 servers.

       <b>option</b> <b>nwip.primary-dss</b> <u>ip-address</u><b>;</b>

         Specifies the IP address of the Primary Domain SAP/RIP Service server (DSS) for this NetWare/IP domain.
         The  NetWare/IP  administration  utility  uses  this  value  as  Primary  DSS server when configuring a
         secondary DSS server.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>DHCPV6</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       DHCPv6 options differ from DHCPv4 options partially due  to  using  16-bit  code  and  length  tags,  but
       semantically  zero-length  options  are  legal  in  DHCPv6, and multiple options are treated differently.
       Whereas in DHCPv4 multiple options would be concatenated to form one option, in DHCPv6 they are  expected
       to  be  individual  instantiations.   Understandably,  many  options  are  not "allowed" to have multiple
       instances in a packet - normally these are options which are digested by the DHCP protocol software,  and
       not by users or applications.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.client-id</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         This option specifies the client's DUID identifier.  DUIDs are similar but different from DHCPv4 client
         identifiers - there are documented duid types:

         <u>duid-llt</u>

         <u>duid-en</u>

         <u>duid-ll</u>

         This  value  should  not  be  configured,  but  rather  is provided by clients and treated as an opaque
         identifier key blob by servers.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.server-id</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         This option specifies the server's DUID identifier.  One may use this option  to  configure  an  opaque
         binary blob for your server's identifier.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.ia-na</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         The  Identity  Association  for Non-temporary Addresses (ia-na) carries assigned addresses that are not
         temporary addresses for use by the DHCPv6 client.   This  option  is  produced  by  the  DHCPv6  server
         software, and should not be configured.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.ia-ta</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         The  Identity Association for Temporary Addresses (ia-ta) carries temporary addresses, which may change
         upon every renewal.  There is no support for this in the current DHCPv6 software.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.ia-addr</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         The Identity Association Address option is encapsulated inside ia-na  or  ia-ta  options  in  order  to
         represent  addresses  associated  with  those IA's.  These options are manufactured by the software, so
         should not be configured.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.oro</b> <u>uint16</u> [ <b>,</b> <u>uint16</u><b>,</b> ... ]<b>;</b>

         The Option Request Option ("ORO") is the DHCPv6  equivalent  of  the  parameter-request-list.   Clients
         supply  this  option to ask servers to reply with options relevant to their needs and use.  This option
         must not be directly configured, the request syntax in dhclient.conf (5) should be used instead.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.preference</b> <u>uint8</u><b>;</b>

         The <b>preference</b> option informs a DHCPv6 client which server is ´preferred´ for use on  a  given  subnet.
         This  preference is only applied during the initial stages of configuration - once a client is bound to
         an IA, it will remain bound to that IA until it is no longer valid or has expired.  This value  may  be
         configured on the server, and is digested by the client software.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.elapsed-time</b> <u>uint16</u><b>;</b>

         The  <b>elapsed-time</b>  option  is constructed by the DHCPv6 client software, and is potentially consumed by
         intermediaries.  This option should not be configured.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.relay-msg</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         The <b>relay-msg</b> option is constructed by  intervening  DHCPv6  relay  agent  software.   This  option  is
         entirely used by protocol software, and is not meant for user configuration.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.unicast</b> <u>ip6-address</u><b>;</b>

         The  <b>unicast</b>  option  is  provided  by DHCPv6 servers which are willing (or prefer) to receive Request,
         Renew, Decline, and Release packets from their clients via  unicast.   Normally,  DHCPv6  clients  will
         multicast  these  messages.   Per  RFC  3315,  the server will reject a unicast message received from a
         client unless it previously sent (or would have sent) the unicast option to that client.   This  option
         may  be  configured  on  the  server at the global and shared network level.  When a unicast message is
         received, the server will check for an applicable definition of the unicast option.  If such an  option
         is found the message will be accepted, if not it will be rejected.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.status-code</b> <u>status-code</u> [ <u>string</u> ] <b>;</b>

         The  <b>status-code</b>  option  is  provided  by  DHCPv6 servers to inform clients of error conditions during
         protocol communication.  This option is manufactured and digested by protocol software, and should  not
         be configured.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.rapid-commit</b> <b>;</b>

         The <b>rapid-commit</b> option is a zero-length option that clients use to indicate their desire to enter into
         rapid-commit with the server.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.vendor-opts</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         The  <b>vendor-opts</b>  option  is  actually  an encapsulated sub-option space, in which each Vendor-specific
         Information Option (VSIO) is identified by a 32-bit  Enterprise-ID  number.   The  encapsulated  option
         spaces within these options are defined by the vendors.

         To  make  use of this option, the best way is to examine the section titled VENDOR ENCAPSULATED OPTIONS
         below, in particular the bits about the "vsio" option space.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.interface-id</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         The <b>interface-id</b> option is manufactured by relay  agents,  and  may  be  used  to  guide  configuration
         differentiating  clients  by  the  interface  they are remotely attached to.  It does not make sense to
         configure a value for this option, but it may make sense to inspect its contents.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.reconf-msg</b> <u>dhcpv6-message</u><b>;</b>

         The <b>reconf-msg</b> option is manufactured by servers, and sent to clients in Reconfigure messages to inform
         them of what message the client should Reconfigure using.  There is no support for  DHCPv6  Reconfigure
         extensions, and this option is documented informationally only.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.reconf-accept</b> <b>;</b>

         The  <b>reconf-accept</b>  option  is  included  by  DHCPv6  clients  that support the Reconfigure extensions,
         advertising that they will respond if the server were to ask them to Reconfigure.  There is no  support
         for DHCPv6 Reconfigure extensions, and this option is documented informationally only.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.sip-servers-names</b> <u>domain-list</u><b>;</b>

         The <b>sip-servers-names</b> option allows SIP clients to locate a local SIP server that is to be used for all
         outbound  SIP  requests,  a so-called"outbound proxy server."  If you wish to use manually entered IPv6
         addresses instead, please see the <b>sip-servers-addresses</b> option below.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.sip-servers-addresses</b> <u>ip6-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip6-address</u> ... ] <b>;</b>

         The <b>sip-servers-addresses</b> option allows SIP clients to locate a local SIP server that is to be used for
         all outbound SIP requests, a so-called "outbound proxy servers."  If  you  wish  to  use  domain  names
         rather than IPv6 addresses, please see the <b>sip-servers-names</b> option above.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.name-servers</b> <u>ip6-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip6-address</u> ... ] <b>;</b>

         The <b>name-servers</b> option instructs clients about locally available recursive DNS servers.  It is easiest
         to describe this as the "nameserver" line in /etc/resolv.conf.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.domain-search</b> <u>domain-list</u><b>;</b>

         The  <b>domain-search</b>  option  specifies  the  client's  domain search path to be applied to recursive DNS
         queries.  It is easiest to describe this as the "search" line in /etc/resolv.conf.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.ia-pd</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         The <b>ia-pd</b> option is manufactured by clients and servers to create a  Prefix  Delegation  binding  -  to
         delegate an IPv6 prefix to the client.  It is not directly edited in <a href="../man5/dhcpd.conf.5.html">dhcpd.conf</a>(5) or <a href="../man5/dhclient.conf.5.html">dhclient.conf</a>(5),
         but rather is manufactured and consumed by the software.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.ia-prefix</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         The  <b>ia-prefix</b>  option  is placed inside <b>ia-pd</b> options in order to identify the prefix(es) allocated to
         the client.  It is not directly edited in <a href="../man5/dhcpd.conf.5.html">dhcpd.conf</a>(5) or <a href="../man5/dhclient.conf.5.html">dhclient.conf</a>(5), but rather is manufactured
         and consumed by the software.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.nis-servers</b> <u>ip6-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip6-address</u> ... ] <b>;</b>

         The <b>nis-servers</b> option identifies, in order, NIS servers available to the client.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.nisp-servers</b> <u>ip6-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip6-address</u> ... ] <b>;</b>

         The <b>nisp-servers</b> option identifies, in order, NIS+ servers available to the client.

       <b>option</b> <b>nis-domain-name</b> <u>domain-list</u><b>;</b>

         The <b>nis-domain-name</b> option specifies the NIS domain name the client is expected to use, and is  related
         to the <b>nis-servers</b> option.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.nis-domain-name</b> <u>domain-name</u><b>;</b>

         The  <b>dhcp6.nis-domain-name</b>  option  specifies  NIS  domain  name  the client is expected to use, and is
         related to <b>dhcp6.nis-servers</b> option.

       <b>option</b> <b>nisp-domain-name</b> <u>domain-list</u><b>;</b>

         The <b>nisp-domain-name</b> option specifies the NIS+ domain name the  client  is  expected  to  use,  and  is
         related to the <b>nisp-servers</b> option.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.nisp-domain-name</b> <u>domain-name</u><b>;</b>

         The  <b>dhcp6.nis-domain-name</b>  option  specifies  NIS+  domain  name the client is expected to use, and is
         related to <b>dhcp6.nisp-servers</b> option.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.sntp-servers</b> <u>ip6-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip6-address</u> ... ] <b>;</b>

         The <b>sntp-servers</b> option specifies a list of local SNTP servers available for the client to  synchronize
         their clocks.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.info-refresh-time</b> <u>uint32</u><b>;</b>

         The  <b>info-refresh-time</b>  option gives DHCPv6 clients using Information-request messages a hint as to how
         long they should between refreshing the information they were given.  Note that this option  will  only
         be delivered to the client, and be likely to affect the client's behaviour, if the client requested the
         option.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.bcms-server-d</b> <u>domain-list</u><b>;</b>

         The  <b>bcms-server-d</b>  option  contains  the  domain  names of local BCMS (Broadcast and Multicast Control
         Services) controllers which the client may use.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.bcms-server-a</b> <u>ip6-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip6-address</u> ... ] <b>;</b>

         The <b>bcms-server-a</b> option contains the IPv6 addresses of local BCMS  (Broadcast  and  Multicast  Control
         Services) controllers which the client may use.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.geoconf-civic</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         A string to hold the geoconf civic structure.

         This option is included based on RFC 4776.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.remote-id</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         The <b>remote-id</b> option is constructed by relay agents, to inform the server of details pertaining to what
         the  relay knows about the client (such as what port it is attached to, and so forth).  The contents of
         this option have some vendor-specific structure (similar to VSIO), but we have  chosen  to  treat  this
         option as an opaque field.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.subscriber-id</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         The  <b>subscriber-id</b>  option  is  an  opaque field provided by the relay agent, which provides additional
         information about the subscriber in question.  The exact contents of this option depend upon the vendor
         and/or the operator's configuration of the remote device, and as such is an opaque field.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.fqdn</b> <u>string</u><b>;</b>

         The <b>fqdn</b> option is normally constructed by the client or server,  and  negotiates  the  client's  Fully
         Qualified  Domain Name, as well as which party is responsible for Dynamic DNS Updates.  See the section
         on the Client FQDN SubOptions for full details (the DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 FQDN options use the same "fqdn."
         encapsulated space, so are in all ways identical).

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.pana-agent</b> <u>ip6-address</u> [<b>,</b> <u>ip6-address</u> ... ] <b>;</b>

         A set of IPv6 addresses of a PAA for the client to use.  The addresses are listed in preferred order.

         This option is included based on RFC 5192.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.new-posix-timezone</b> <u>text</u><b>;</b>

         This option specifies a string suitable for the TZ variable.

         This option is included based on RFC 4833.

       <b>option</b> <b>dhcp6.new-tzdb-timezone</b> <u>text</u><b>;</b>

         This option specifies a name of a zone entry in the TZ database.

         This option is included based on RFC 4833.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESSING</b> <b>DHCPV6</b> <b>RELAY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>v6relay</b> <b>(relay-number</b>, <b>option</b>) This option allows access to an option that has been added to a packet  by
       a  relay  agent.   Relay-number  value selects the relay to examine and option is the option to find.  In
       DHCPv6 each relay encapsulates the entire previous message into an option, adds its own options (if  any)
       and  sends the result onwards.  The RFC specifies a limit of 32 hops.  A relay-number of 0 is a no-op and
       means don't look at the relays.  1 is the relay that is closest to the client, 2 would  be  the  next  in
       from  the  client  and  so  on.  Any value greater than the max number of hops is which is closest to the
       server independent of number.  To use this option in a class statement  you  would  have  something  like
       this:

       match if v6relay(1, option dhcp6.subscriber-id) = "client_1";

</pre><h4><b>DEFINING</b> <b>NEW</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The  Internet  Systems  Consortium  DHCP  client and server provide the capability to define new options.
       Each DHCP option has a name, a code, and a structure.  The name is used by you to refer  to  the  option.
       The  code is a number, used by the DHCP server and client to refer to an option.  The structure describes
       what the contents of an option looks like.

       To define a new option, you need to choose a name for it that is not in use for some other option  -  for
       example, you can't use "host-name" because the DHCP protocol already defines a host-name option, which is
       documented  earlier  in  this manual page.  If an option name doesn't appear in this manual page, you can
       use it, but it's probably a good idea to put some kind of unique string at the beginning so  you  can  be
       sure  that  future  options  don't take your name.  For example, you might define an option, "local-host-
       name", feeling some confidence that no official DHCP option name will ever start with "local".

       Once you have chosen a name, you must choose a code.  All codes between  224  and  254  are  reserved  as
       ´site-local´   DHCP   options,  so  you  can  pick  any  one  of  these  for  your  site  (not  for  your
       product/application).  In RFC3942, site-local space was moved from starting at 128 to  starting  at  224.
       In  practice,  some vendors have interpreted the protocol rather loosely and have used option code values
       greater than 128 themselves.  There's no real way to avoid  this  problem,  and  it  was  thought  to  be
       unlikely  to  cause  too much trouble in practice.  If you come across a vendor-documented option code in
       either the new or old site-local spaces, please contact your vendor and inform them about rfc3942.

       The structure of an option is simply the format in which the option data appears.  The  ISC  DHCP  server
       currently  supports  a  few  simple types, like integers, booleans, strings and IP addresses, and it also
       supports the ability to define arrays of single types or arrays of fixed sequences of types.

       New options are declared as follows:

       <b>option</b> <u>new-name</u> <b>code</b> <u>new-code</u> <b>=</b> <u>definition</u> <b>;</b>

       The values of <u>new-name</u> and <u>new-code</u> should be the name you have chosen for the new option  and  the  code
       you have chosen.  The <u>definition</u> should be the definition of the structure of the option.

       The following simple option type definitions are supported:

       <b>BOOLEAN</b>

       <b>option</b> <u>new-name</u> <b>code</b> <u>new-code</u> <b>=</b> <b>boolean</b> <b>;</b>

       An  option  of type boolean is a flag with a value of either on or off (or true or false).  So an example
       use of the boolean type would be:

       option use-zephyr code 180 = boolean;
       option use-zephyr on;

       <b>INTEGER</b>

       <b>option</b> <u>new-name</u> <b>code</b> <u>new-code</u> <b>=</b> <u>sign</u> <b>integer</b> <u>width</u> <b>;</b>

       The <u>sign</u> token should either be blank, <u>unsigned</u> or <u>signed</u>.  The width can be either  8,  16  or  32,  and
       refers  to  the number of bits in the integer.  So for example, the following two lines show a definition
       of the sql-connection-max option and its use:

       option sql-connection-max code 192 = unsigned integer 16;
       option sql-connection-max 1536;

       <b>IP-ADDRESS</b>

       <b>option</b> <u>new-name</u> <b>code</b> <u>new-code</u> <b>=</b> <b>ip-address</b> <b>;</b>

       An option whose structure is an IP address can be expressed either as a domain name or as a dotted  quad.
       So the following is an example use of the ip-address type:

       option sql-server-address code 193 = ip-address;
       option sql-server-address sql.example.com;

       <b>IP6-ADDRESS</b>

       <b>option</b> <u>new-name</u> <b>code</b> <u>new-code</u> <b>=</b> <b>ip6-address</b> <b>;</b>

       An option whose structure is an IPv6 address must be expressed as a valid IPv6 address.  The following is
       an example use of the ip6-address type:

       option dhcp6.some-server code 1234 = array of ip6-address;
       option dhcp6.some-server 3ffe:bbbb:aaaa:aaaa::1, 3ffe:bbbb:aaaa:aaaa::2;

       <b>TEXT</b>

       <b>option</b> <u>new-name</u> <b>code</b> <u>new-code</u> <b>=</b> <b>text</b> <b>;</b>

       An option whose type is text will encode an ASCII text string.  For example:

       option sql-default-connection-name code 194 = text;
       option sql-default-connection-name "PRODZA";

       <b>DATA</b> <b>STRING</b>

       <b>option</b> <u>new-name</u> <b>code</b> <u>new-code</u> <b>=</b> <b>string</b> <b>;</b>

       An  option  whose  type  is a data string is essentially just a collection of bytes, and can be specified
       either as quoted text, like the text type, or as a list of hexadecimal contents separated by colons whose
       values must be between 0 and FF.  For example:

       option sql-identification-token code 195 = string;
       option sql-identification-token 17:23:19:a6:42:ea:99:7c:22;

       <b>DOMAIN-LIST</b>

       <b>option</b> <u>new-name</u> <b>code</b> <u>new-code</u> <b>=</b> <b>domain-list</b> <b>[compressed]</b> <b>;</b>

       An option whose type is <b>domain-list</b> is an RFC1035 formatted (on the wire, "DNS Format")  list  of  domain
       names,  separated  by  root  labels.   The  optional <b>compressed</b> keyword indicates if the option should be
       compressed relative to the start of the option contents (not the packet contents).

       When in doubt, omit the <b>compressed</b> keyword.  When the software receives an option that is compressed  and
       the  <b>compressed</b>  keyword is omitted, it will still decompress the option (relative to the option contents
       field).  The keyword only controls whether or not transmitted packets are compressed.

       Note that when <b>domain-list</b> formatted options are output as environment variables  to  <b><a href="../man8/dhclient-script.8.html">dhclient-script</a>(8),</b>
       the  standard  DNS -escape mechanism is used: they are decimal.  This is appropriate for direct use in eg
       /etc/resolv.conf.

       <b>ENCAPSULATION</b>

       <b>option</b> <u>new-name</u> <b>code</b> <u>new-code</u> <b>=</b> <b>encapsulate</b> <u>identifier</u> <b>;</b>

       An option whose type is <b>encapsulate</b> will encapsulate the  contents  of  the  option  space  specified  in
       <u>identifier</u>.   Examples  of  encapsulated  options in the DHCP protocol as it currently exists include the
       vendor-encapsulated-options option, the netware-suboptions option and the relay-agent-information option.

       option space local;
       option local.demo code 1 = text;
       option local-encapsulation code 197 = encapsulate local;
       option local.demo "demo";

       <b>ARRAYS</b>

       Options can contain arrays of any of the above types except for the text and  data  string  types,  which
       aren't currently supported in arrays.  An example of an array definition is as follows:

       option kerberos-servers code 200 = array of ip-address;
       option kerberos-servers 10.20.10.1, 10.20.11.1;

       <b>RECORDS</b>

       Options  can  also  contain  data  structures  consisting of a sequence of data types, which is sometimes
       called a record type.  For example:

       option contrived-001 code 201 = { boolean, integer 32, text };
       option contrived-001 on 1772 "contrivance";

       It's also possible to have options that are arrays of records, for example:

       option new-static-routes code 201 = array of {
            ip-address, ip-address, ip-address, integer 8 };
       option static-routes
            10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 net-0-rtr.example.com 1,
            10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0 net-1-rtr.example.com 1,
            10.2.0.0 255.255.224.0 net-2-0-rtr.example.com 3;

</pre><h4><b>VENDOR</b> <b>ENCAPSULATED</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The DHCP protocol defines the <b>vendor-encapsulated-options</b> option, which allows vendors  to  define  their
       own  options  that  will  be  sent  encapsulated  in  a standard DHCP option.  It also defines the <b>Vendor</b>
       <b>Identified</b> <b>Vendor</b> <b>Sub</b> <b>Options</b> option ("VIVSO"), and  the  DHCPv6  protocol  defines  the  <b>Vendor-specific</b>
       <b>Information</b>  <b>Option</b>  ("VSIO").   The  format  of  all  of these options is usually internally a string of
       options, similarly to other normal DHCP options.  The VIVSO and VSIO options differ in that they  contain
       options  that  correspond  to vendor Enterprise-ID numbers (assigned by IANA), which then contain options
       according to each Vendor's specifications.  You will need to refer  to  your  vendor's  documentation  in
       order to form options to their specification.

       The  value  of  these options can be set in one of two ways.  The first way is to simply specify the data
       directly, using a text string or a colon-separated list of hexadecimal values.  For help in forming these
       strings, please refer to <b>RFC2132</b> for the DHCPv4 <b>Vendor</b>  <b>Specific</b>  <b>Information</b>  <b>Option</b>,  <b>RFC3925</b>  for  the
       DHCPv4  <b>Vendor</b>  <b>Identified</b>  <b>Vendor</b>  <b>Sub</b>  <b>Options</b>,  or  <b>RFC3315</b> for the DHCPv6 <b>Vendor-specific</b> <b>Information</b>
       <b>Option</b>.  For example:

       option vendor-encapsulated-options
           2:4:
            AC:11:41:1:
           3:12:
            73:75:6e:64:68:63:70:2d:73:65:72:76:65:72:31:37:2d:31:
           4:12:
            2f:65:78:70:6f:72:74:2f:72:6f:6f:74:2f:69:38:36:70:63;
       option vivso
           00:00:09:bf:0E:
            01:0c:
                48:65:6c:6c:6f:20:77:6f:72:6c:64:21;
       option dhcp6.vendor-opts
           00:00:09:bf:
            00:01:00:0c:
                48:65:6c:6c:6f:20:77:6f:72:6c:64:21;

       The second way of setting the value of these options is to  have  the  DHCP  server  generate  a  vendor-
       specific option buffer.  To do this, you must do four things: define an option space, define some options
       in  that  option  space,  provide  values  for them, and specify that that option space should be used to
       generate the relevant option.

       To define a new option space in which vendor options can be stored, use the option space statement:

       <b>option</b> <b>space</b> <u>name</u> <b>[</b> <b>[</b> <b>code</b> <b>width</b> <u>number</u> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>length</b> <b>width</b> <u>number</u> <b>]</b> <b>[</b> <b>hash</b> <b>size</b> <u>number</u> <b>]</b> <b>]</b> <b>;</b>

       Where the numbers following <b>code</b> <b>width</b>, <b>length</b> <b>width</b>, and <b>hash</b> <b>size</b> respectively identify the  number  of
       bytes  used  to describe option codes, option lengths, and the size in buckets of the hash tables to hold
       options in this space (most DHCPv4 option spaces use 1 byte codes and  lengths,  which  is  the  default,
       whereas most DHCPv6 option spaces use 2 byte codes and lengths).

       The  code  and  length  widths  are used in DHCP protocol - you must configure these numbers to match the
       applicable option space you are configuring.  They each default to 1.  Valid values for code  widths  are
       1, 2 or 4.  Valid values for length widths are 0, 1 or 2.  Most DHCPv4 option spaces use 1 byte codes and
       lengths,  which  is the default, whereas most DHCPv6 option spaces use 2 byte codes and lengths.  A zero-
       byte length produces options similar to the DHCPv6 Vendor-specific Information Option  -  but  not  their
       contents!

       The  hash  size defaults depend upon the <b>code</b> <b>width</b> selected, and may be 254 or 1009.  Valid values range
       between 1 and 65535.  Note that the higher you configure this value, the more memory will be used.  It is
       considered good practice to configure a value that is  slightly  larger  than  the  estimated  number  of
       options  you plan to configure within the space.  Previous versions of ISC DHCP (up to and including DHCP
       3.0.*), this value was fixed at 9973.

       The name can then be used in option definitions, as described earlier in this document.  For example:

       option space SUNW code width 1 length width 1 hash size 3;
       option SUNW.server-address code 2 = ip-address;
       option SUNW.server-name code 3 = text;
       option SUNW.root-path code 4 = text;

       option space ISC code width 1 length width 1 hash size 3;
       option ISC.sample code 1 = text;
       option vendor.ISC code 2495 = encapsulate vivso-sample;
       option vendor-class.ISC code 2495 = text;

       option ISC.sample "configuration text here";
       option vendor-class.ISC "vendor class here";

       option space docsis code width 2 length width 2 hash size 17;
       option docsis.tftp-servers code 32 = array of ip6-address;
       option docsis.cablelabs-configuration-file code 33 = text;
       option docsis.cablelabs-syslog-servers code 34 = array of ip6-address;
       option docsis.device-id code 36 = string;
       option docsis.time-servers code 37 = array of ip6-address;
       option docsis.time-offset code 38 = signed integer 32;
       option vsio.docsis code 4491 = encapsulate docsis;

       Once you have defined an option space and the format of some options, you can set up scopes  that  define
       values  for those options, and you can say when to use them.  For example, suppose you want to handle two
       different classes of clients.  Using the option space definition shown in the previous example,  you  can
       send  different  option  values to different clients based on the vendor-class-identifier option that the
       clients send, as follows:

       class "vendor-classes" {
         match option vendor-class-identifier;
       }

       subclass "vendor-classes" "SUNW.Ultra-5_10" {
         vendor-option-space SUNW;
         option SUNW.root-path "/export/root/sparc";
       }

       subclass "vendor-classes" "SUNW.i86pc" {
         vendor-option-space SUNW;
         option SUNW.root-path "/export/root/i86pc";
       }

       option SUNW.server-address 172.17.65.1;
       option SUNW.server-name "sundhcp-server17-1";

       option vivso-sample.sample "Hello world!";

       option docsis.tftp-servers ::1;

       As you can see in the preceding example, regular scoping rules apply, so you can define values  that  are
       global  in  the global scope, and only define values that are specific to a particular class in the local
       scope.  The <b>vendor-option-space</b> declaration tells the DHCP server to use options in the SUNW option space
       to construct the DHCPv4 <b>vendor-encapsulated-options</b> option.  This is a limitation of that  option  -  the
       DHCPv4  VIVSO  and  the  DHCPv6  VSIO  options  can  have  multiple  vendor definitions all at once (even
       transmitted to the same client), so it is not necessary to configure this.
