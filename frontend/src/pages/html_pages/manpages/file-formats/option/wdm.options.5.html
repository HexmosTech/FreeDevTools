       wdm.options - configuration options for WINGs display manager

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/etc/X11/wdm/wdm.options</u> contains a set of flags that determine some of the behavior of the WINGs display
       manager <b><a href="../man1/wdm.1.html">wdm</a></b>(1).

       <u>/etc/X11/wdm/wdm.options</u>  may contain comments, which begin with a hash mark and end at the next newline,
       just like comments in shell scripts.  The rest of the file consists of options  which  are  expressed  as
       words  separated  by  hyphens,  with  only  one  option per line.  If an option is present with the "no-"
       prefix, or absent, it is disabled, otherwise it is considered enabled.

       Available options are:

       auto-update-wmlist
              If set, this option will cause wdm always  regenerate  the  contents  of  the  session  menu  when
              starting.  It is set by default but should be disabled if you wish to manually specify the list of
              available window managers.

       ignore-nologin
              Normally,  the  contents of the /etc/nologin file will be displayed using xmessage (if xmessage is
              available), and the user will be returned to the wdm login screen after the xmessage is dismissed.
              If this option is enabled, wdm starts a session as usual (after  the  xmessage  is  dismissed,  if
              xmessage is available).

       restart-on-upgrade
              Enable  this  option with caution on "production" machines; it causes the wdm daemon to be stopped
              and restarted on upgrade, even if  the  process  has  children  (which  means  it  is  managing  X
              sessions).   Typically  when  a package that contains a daemon is being installed or upgraded, its
              maintainer scripts stop a running daemon process before installing the new binary, and restart  it
              after  the  new binary is installed.  Stopping wdm causes immediate termination of any sessions it
              manages; in some situations this could be an unwelcome surprise  (for  instance,  for  remote  wdm
              users  who  had  no idea the administrator was performing system maintenance).  On the other hand,
              for machines that stay up for long periods of time, leaving the old daemon running can  be  a  bad
              idea  if  the new version has, for instance, a fix for a security vulnerability (overwriting wdm's
              executable on the file system has no effect on the copy of wdm in memory).   The  wdm  pre-removal
              script  checks  to  see  if  the  wdm  process  has  any children; if it does, it is possible that
              someone's session would be killed by stopping wdm, so a warning is issued and  an  opportunity  to
              abort  the  upgrade of wdm is provided.  If this option is disabled (the Debian default), wdm will
              be stopped and restarted during an install or upgrade only if the running wdm process is found  to
              have  no  children.   In  the event the wdm daemon is not stopped and restarted, the administrator
              will have to do so by hand (probably with "/etc/init.d/wdm restart", or by rebooting  the  system)
              before the newly installed wdm binary is used.

       run-xconsole
              This  option  opens  an  <b><a href="../man1/xconsole.1.html">xconsole</a></b>(1)  client to catch messages that would normally go to the Linux
              virtual console and thus be missed in many cases by the user.  By default,  this  option  is  only
              supported in the Xsetup file for display :0 (<u>/etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0</u>), but any Xsetup script may use
              it if appropriately edited.

       use-sessreg
              If  this option is enabled (the Debian default), the sessreg program will be invoked to register X
              sessions managed by wdm in the utmp and wtmp files.  Otherwise, it is not, and the utmp  and  wtmp
              files will have no record of wdm sessions.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       Flags controlling wdm used to be kept in <u>/etc/X11/config</u> on Debian GNU/Linux systems.
