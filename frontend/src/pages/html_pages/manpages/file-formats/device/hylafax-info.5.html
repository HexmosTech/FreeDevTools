       info - remote device capability database

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>info</b> subdirectory in the <u>HylaFAX</u> spooling area holds information about the capabilities and status of
       devices  that  have  been  called.   One  file exists for each device, with the filename created from the
       remote device's fully-qualified phone number.  Files have a simple ASCII format.  Each  line  is  of  the
       form
            [<b>&amp;</b>]<b>tag</b>: <u>value</u>
       where  a  <u>tag</u>  identifies  a  capability  and  a  <u>value</u> is either a string, number, or boolean value.  An
       optional ``&amp;'' at the front of the line indicates that the tag's value is <u>locked</u> <u>down</u> and should  not  be
       updated  by  the server.  This facility is useful for restricting the capabilities used with a particular
       machine.

       The following items are recorded:
              <b>Tag</b>                   <b>Type</b>       <b>Description</b>
              calledBefore          boolean    device has previously answered at this number
              dialFailures          number     count of consecutive failed dial operations
              hasV34Trouble         boolean    there is difficulty sending to this destination with V.34
              hasV17Trouble         boolean    there is difficulty sending to this destination with V.17
              lastDialFailure       string     reason for last failed dial operation
              lastSendFailure       string     reason for last failed send attempt
              maxPageWidth          number     maximum page width in pixels in normal resolution
              maxPageLength         number     maximum page length in millimeters
              maxSignallingRate     string     maximum signalling rate (bits/sec) to use
              minScanlineTime       string     minimum scanline time
              pagerMaxMsgLength     number     length of longest allowed text message
              pagerPassword         string     password string send to service provider
              pagerSetupCmds        string     commands for setting up modem for a specific service provider
              pagerTTYParity        string     parity &amp; # bits configuration for IXO/TAP communication
              pageSource            string     parameter to tell the paging central who we are
              pagingProtocol        string     protocol (IXO or UCP) for this provider
              remoteCSI             string     remote device Called Subscriber Identification
              remoteNSF             string     remote equipment Non-Standard Facilities information
              remoteDIS             string     remote Digital Identification Signal: capabilities
              sendFailures          number     count of consecutive failed send attempts
              supportsBatching      boolean    accepts batching protocol
              supportsHighRes       boolean    accepts 196 line/inch images (obsolete)
              supportsVRes          number     vertical resolution support bitmask
              supports2DEncoding    boolean    accepts Group 3 2D encoding
              supportsMMR           boolean    accepts Group 4 encoding
              supportsPostScript    boolean    accepts Adobe POSTSCRIPT transfer protocol

       The <u>HylaFAX</u> scheduler, <u><a href="../man8/faxq.8.html">faxq</a></u>(8), uses the information stored in this directory when  deciding  if  a  call
       should  be  placed  and when preparing documents for transmission.  If a remote device's capabilities are
       known, then  document  preparation  is  constrained  and/or  optimized  according  to  the  capabilities.
       Otherwise, documents are prepared without regard for the remote device's capabilities and if a capability
       mismatch  is  encountered  the  session  is  terminated and the documents are reformatted using the newly
       discovered capabilities.

       The <u>calledBefore</u> item is used by <u>faxsend</u> to  decide  whether  or  not  to  redial  a  phone  number  when
       encountering  certain errors.  For example, if a dialing command results in a ``NO CARRIER'' result, then
       the number will not be retried unless the number has previously been dialed successfully.

       The <u>minScanlineTime</u> item indicates the minimum scanline time parameter used for facsimile  transmissions.
       Acceptable  values are: ``0ms'', ``5ms'', ``10ms/5ms'', ``10ms'', ``20ms/10ms'', ``20ms'', ``40ms/20ms'',
       and ``40ms''.  (Values of the form <u>X/Y</u> mean to use <u>X</u> for 98 lpi images and <u>Y</u> for 196 lpi images.)

       The <u>pagerTTYParity</u> item specifies the communication parameters to use when communicating with the IXO/TAP
       service provider.  Acceptable values are: ``even'' (7 bits, even parity), ``odd'' (7 bits,  odd  parity),
       and ``none'' (8 bits, no parity).  If nothing is specified then ``even'' is used per the standard.

       The <u>pagerMaxMsgLength</u>, <u>pagerPassword</u>, and <u>pagerTTYParity</u> items can be setup according to the requirements
       of  a  pager  service  provider;  they typically are locked down so that their values are not lost during
       updates.

       The <u>pagerSetupCmds</u> can be used to define AT commands for setting up the  modem  for  a  specific  service
       provider.  This value overwrites the settings defined in <u><a href="../man5/hylafax-config.5.html">hylafax-config</a></u>(5).

       The  <u>pageSource</u>  parameter  can be used to tell the paging central who we are.  It usually contains a SMS
       answerable mobile number. It is only used for the UCP part of <u><a href="../man8/sendpage.8.html">sendpage</a></u>(8).  <b>Note:</b>  This parameter  should
       be used from user-land <u><a href="../man1/sendpage.1.html">sendpage</a></u>(1) and will be removed later.

       The  <u>pagingProtocol</u> defines which protocol, UCP or IXO, should be used to send the message to the service
       provider. It defaults to ``ixo''; for UCP set ``ucp''.

</pre><h4><b>NOTES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>faxsend</u>, <u>pagesend</u>, and <u>faxq</u> automatically create and update entries in the <b>info</b> directory, as required.

       The data in this directory is simply a <u>cache</u> of remote capabilities and, except for  locked  down  items,
       can  be  safely  purged  at  any  time.  The <u><a href="../man8/faxcron.8.html">faxcron</a></u>(8) script, for example, periodically purges unlocked
       entries in this directory that have not been accessed in 30 days.

       When the first batching attempt fails then <u>supportsBatching</u> is set to false.  It must be manually altered
       in order to re-enable batching to the destination.

       Restricting the capabilities used with a particular  machine  to  a  value  other  than  those  that  are
       mandatory can cause documents to be sent outside of an acceptable range for the receiver.
