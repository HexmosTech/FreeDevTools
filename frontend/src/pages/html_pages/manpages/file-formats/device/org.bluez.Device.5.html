              [variable prefix]/{hci0,hci1,...}/dev_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX_XX

   <b>Methods</b>
   <b>void</b> <b>Connect()</b>
          Connects  all  profiles  the  remote device supports that can be connected to and have been flagged as
          auto-connectable. If only subset of profiles is already connected it will  try  to  connect  currently
          disconnected ones.

          If at least one profile was connected successfully this method will indicate success.

          For dual-mode devices only one bearer is connected at time, the conditions are in the following order:

          1. Connect the disconnected bearer if already connected.

          2.  Connect  first  the bonded bearer. If no bearers are bonded or both are skip and check latest seen
          bearer.

          3. Connect last seen bearer, in case the timestamps are the same BR/EDR takes precedence, or  in  case
          <b>PreferredBearer</b> has been set to a specific bearer then that is used instead.

          Possible errors:

          <b>org.bluez.Error.NotReady</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Failed</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.InProgress</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.AlreadyConnected</b>

   <b>void</b> <b>Disconnect()</b>
          Disconnects all connected profiles and then terminates low-level ACL connection.

          ACL  connection  will  be  terminated even if some profiles were not disconnected properly e.g. due to
          misbehaving device.

          This method can be also used to cancel a preceding  Connect  call  before  a  reply  to  it  has  been
          received.

          For non-trusted devices connected over LE bearer calling this method will disable incoming connections
          until Connect method is called again.

          Possible errors:

          <b>org.bluez.Error.NotConnected</b>

   <b>void</b> <b>ConnectProfile(string</b> <b>uuid)</b>
          Connects  a  specific  profile  of  this  device. The UUID provided is the remote service UUID for the
          profile.

          Possible errors:

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Failed</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.InProgress</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.NotAvailable</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.NotReady</b>

   <b>void</b> <b>DisconnectProfile(string</b> <b>uuid)</b>
          Disconnects a specific profile of this device. The profile needs to be registered client profile.

          There is no connection tracking for a profile, so as long as  the  profile  is  registered  this  will
          always succeed.

          Possible errors:

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Failed</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.InProgress</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.NotSupported</b>

   <b>void</b> <b>Pair()</b>
          Connects to the remote device and initiate pairing procedure then proceed with service discovery.

          If  the  application has registered its own agent, then that specific agent will be used. Otherwise it
          will use the default agent.

          Only for applications like a pairing wizard it would make sense to have its own agent. In  almost  all
          other cases the default agent will handle this just fine.

          In case there is no application agent and also no default agent present, this method will fail.

          Possible errors:

          <b>org.bluez.Error.InvalidArguments</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Failed</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.AlreadyExists</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.AuthenticationCanceled</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.AuthenticationTimeout</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.ConnectionAttemptFailed</b>

   <b>void</b> <b>CancelPairing()</b>
          Cancels a pairing operation initiated by the <b>Pair</b> method.

          Possible errors:

          <b>org.bluez.Error.DoesNotExist</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Failed</b>

   <b>array{array{byte}}</b> <b>GetServiceRecords()</b> <b>[experimental]</b>
          Returns  all  currently  known  BR/EDR  service  records  for  the  device. Each individual byte array
          represents a raw SDP record, as defined by the Bluetooth Service Discovery Protocol specification.

          This method is intended to be only used by compatibility layers like Wine, that need to provide access
          to raw SDP records to support foreign Bluetooth APIs. General  applications  should  instead  use  the
          Profile API for services-related functionality.

          Possible errors:

          <b>org.bluez.Error.Failed</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.NotReady</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.NotConnected</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Error.DoesNotExist</b>

   <b>Signals</b>
   <b>void</b> <b>Disconnected(string</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>string</b> <b>message)</b>
          This signal is launched when a device is disconnected, with the reason of the disconnection.

          This  could  be  used  by client application, depending on internal policy, to try to reconnect to the
          device in case of timeout or unknown disconnection, or to try to connect to another device.

          Possible reasons:

          <b>org.bluez.Reason.Unknown</b>

          <b>org.bluez.Reason.Timeout</b>
                 Connection timeout.

                 The link supervision timeout has expired for a connection or the  synchronization  timeout  has
                 expired for a broadcast.

          <b>org.bluez.Reason.Local</b>
                 Connection terminated by local host.

                 The  local  device terminated the connection, terminated synchronization with a broadcaster, or
                 terminated broadcasting packets.

          <b>org.bluez.Reason.Remote</b>
                 Connection terminated by remote host.

                 This disconnection can be due to: - the  user  on  the  remote  device  either  terminated  the
                 connection  or  stopped  broadcasting  packets,  -  the remote device terminated the connection
                 because of low resources, - the remote device terminated the connection because the  device  is
                 about to power off.

          <b>org.bluez.Reason.Authentication</b>
                 Connection terminated due to an authentication failure.

          <b>org.bluez.Reason.Suspend</b>
                 Connection terminated by local host for suspend.

   <b>Properties</b>
   <b>string</b> <b>Address</b> <b>[readonly]</b>
          The Bluetooth device address of the remote device.

   <b>string</b> <b>AddressType</b> <b>[readonly]</b>
          The  Bluetooth  device  Address Type. For dual-mode and BR/EDR only devices this defaults to "public".
          Single mode LE devices may have either value.  If remote device uses privacy than before pairing  this
          represents address type used for connection and Identity Address after pairing.

          Possible values:

          <b>"public"</b>
                 Public address

          <b>"random"</b>
                 Random address

   <b>string</b> <b>Name</b> <b>[readonly,</b> <b>optional]</b>
          The Bluetooth remote name.

          This  value  is  only  present  for  completeness.  It is better to always use the <b>Alias</b> property when
          displaying the devices name.

          If the <b>Alias</b> property is unset, it will reflect this value which makes it more convenient.

   <b>string</b> <b>Icon</b> <b>[readonly,</b> <b>optional]</b>
          Proposed icon name according to the freedesktop.org icon naming specification.

   <b>uint32</b> <b>Class</b> <b>[readonly,</b> <b>optional]</b>
          The Bluetooth class of device of the remote device.

   <b>uint16</b> <b>Appearance</b> <b>[readonly,</b> <b>optional]</b>
          External appearance of device, as found on GAP service.

   <b>array{string}</b> <b>UUIDs</b> <b>[readonly,</b> <b>optional]</b>
          List of 128-bit UUIDs that represents the available remote services.

   <b>boolean</b> <b>Paired</b> <b>[readonly]</b>
          Indicates if the remote device is paired. Paired means the pairing process where devices exchange  the
          information to establish an encrypted connection has been completed.

   <b>boolean</b> <b>Bonded</b> <b>[readonly]</b>
          Indicates  if  the  remote device is bonded. Bonded means the information exchanged on pairing process
          has been stored and will be persisted.

   <b>boolean</b> <b>Connected</b> <b>[readonly]</b>
          Indicates if the remote device is currently connected.  A PropertiesChanged signal indicate changes to
          this status.

   <b>boolean</b> <b>Trusted</b> <b>[readwrite]</b>
          Indicates if the remote is seen as trusted. This setting can be changed by the application.

   <b>boolean</b> <b>Blocked</b> <b>[readwrite]</b>
          If set to true any incoming connections from the device  will  be  immediately  rejected.  Any  device
          drivers will also be removed and no new ones will be probed as long as the device is blocked.

   <b>boolean</b> <b>WakeAllowed</b> <b>[readwrite]</b>
          If set to true this device will be allowed to wake the host from system suspend.

   <b>string</b> <b>Alias</b> <b>[readwrite]</b>
          The  name alias for the remote device. The alias can be used to have a different friendly name for the
          remote device.

          In case no alias is set, it will return the remote device name. Setting an empty string as alias  will
          convert it back to the remote device name.

          When resetting the alias with an empty string, the property will default back to the remote name.

   <b>object</b> <b>Adapter</b> <b>[readonly]</b>
          The object path of the adapter the device belongs to.

   <b>boolean</b> <b>LegacyPairing</b> <b>[readonly]</b>
          Set to true if the device only supports the pre-2.1 pairing mechanism.  This property is useful during
          device discovery to anticipate whether legacy or simple pairing will occur if pairing is initiated.

          Note  that  this  property can exhibit false-positives in the case of Bluetooth 2.1 (or newer) devices
          that have disabled Extended Inquiry Response support.

   <b>boolean</b> <b>CablePairing</b> <b>[readonly]</b>
          Set to true if the device was  cable  paired  and  it  doesn't  support  the  canonical  bonding  with
          encryption,  e.g.  the  Sixaxis gamepad.  If true, BlueZ will establish a connection without enforcing
          encryption.

   <b>string</b> <b>Modalias</b> <b>[readonly,</b> <b>optional]</b>
          Remote Device ID information in modalias format used by the kernel and udev.

   <b>int16</b> <b>RSSI</b> <b>[readonly,</b> <b>optional]</b>
          Received Signal Strength Indicator of the remote device (inquiry or advertising).

   <b>int16</b> <b>TxPower</b> <b>[readonly,</b> <b>optional]</b>
          Advertised transmitted power level (inquiry or advertising).

   <b>dict</b> <b>ManufacturerData</b> <b>[readonly,</b> <b>optional]</b>
          Manufacturer specific advertisement data. Keys are 16 bits Manufacturer ID followed by its byte  array
          value.

   <b>dict</b> <b>ServiceData</b> <b>[readonly,</b> <b>optional]</b>
          Service advertisement data. Keys are the UUIDs in string format followed by its byte array value.

   <b>bool</b> <b>ServicesResolved</b> <b>[readonly]</b>
          Indicate whether or not service discovery has been resolved.

   <b>array{byte}</b> <b>AdvertisingFlags</b> <b>[readonly]</b>
          The Advertising Data Flags of the remote device.

   <b>dict</b> <b>AdvertisingData</b> <b>[readonly]</b>
          The Advertising Data of the remote device. Keys are 1 byte AD Type followed by data as byte array.

          Note: Only types considered safe to be handled by application are exposed.

          Possible values:

          <b>&lt;type&gt;</b> &lt;byte array&gt;

          Example:
              &lt;Transport Discovery&gt; &lt;Organization Flags...&gt; 0x26                   0x01         0x01...

   <b>array{object,</b> <b>dict}</b> <b>Sets</b> <b>[readonly,</b> <b>experimental]</b>
          The  object  paths  of  the  sets the device belongs to followed by a dictionary which can contain the
          following:

          <b>byte</b> <b>Rank</b>
                 Rank of the device in the Set.

   <b>string</b> <b>PreferredBearer</b> <b>[readwrite,</b> <b>optional,</b> <b>experimental]</b>
          Indicate the preferred bearer when initiating a connection, only available for dual-mode devices.

          When changing from "bredr" to "le" the device will be removed from the 'auto-connect' list so it won't
          automatically be connected when adverting.

          Note: Changes only take effect when the device is disconnected.

          Possible values:

          <b>"last-used"</b>
                 Connect to last used bearer first. Default.

          <b>"bredr"</b>
                 Connect to BR/EDR first.

          <b>"le"</b>   Connect to LE first.

          <b>"last-seen"</b>
                 Connect to last seen bearer first.
