</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       crontab - tables for driving systemd-cron

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A <u>crontab</u> file contains instructions to <u>systemd-cron</u> of the general form: ``run this command at this time
       on  this  date''.  Each user has their own crontab, and commands in any given crontab will be executed as
       the user who owns the crontab.

       Blank lines and leading spaces and tabs are ignored.  Lines whose first non-space character  is  a  hash-
       sign  (#)  are  comments,  and  are ignored.  Note that comments are not allowed on the same line as cron
       commands, since they will be taken to be part of the command.  Similarly, comments are not allowed on the
       same line as environment variable settings.

       An active line in a crontab will be either an environment setting or a cron command.  The crontab file is
       parsed from top to bottom, so any environment settings will affect only the cron commands below  them  in
       the file.  An environment setting is of the form,

           name = value

       where  the  spaces around the equal-sign (=) are optional, and any subsequent non-leading spaces in <u>value</u>
       will be part of the value assigned to <u>name</u>.  The <u>value</u> string may be placed in quotes (single or  double,
       but  matching)  to  preserve leading or trailing blanks. The <u>value</u> string is <b>not</b> parsed for environmental
       substitutions or replacement of variables, thus lines like

           PATH = $HOME/bin:$PATH

       will not work as you might expect. And neither will this work

           A=1
           B=2
           C=$A $B

       There will not be any substitution for the defined variables in the last value.

       In PATH, tilde-expansion is performed on elements starting with "~/", so this works as expected:

            SHELL=<a href="file:/bin/bash">/bin/bash</a>
            PATH=<a href="file:~/bin">~/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/bin/">/usr/bin/</a>:<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>

       <u>Special</u> <u>variables:</u>

       <b>SHELL</b>, <b>PATH</b>, <b>USER</b>, <b>LOGNAME</b>, <b>HOME</b>, <b>LANG</b>
              Those are set up automatically by systemd itself, see <u><a href="../man5/systemd.exec.5.html">systemd.exec</a></u>(5) SHELL defaults  to  /bin/sh.
              SHELL and PATH may be overridden by settings in the crontab.

       <b>MAILTO</b>
              When  sending output from a job, <u><a href="../man7/systemd.cron.7.html">systemd.cron</a></u>(7) will look at MAILTO. If MAILTO is defined mail is
              sent to this email address.  MAILTO may also be used to direct  mail  to  multiple  recipients  by
              separating recipient users with a comma.  If MAILTO is defined but empty (MAILTO=""), no mail will
              be sent.  Otherwise mail is sent to the owner of the crontab.
              By  default,  this mail contains <b>systemctl</b> <b>status</b> and the full log for the failed run, copied from
              the journal.

       <b>MAILFROM</b>
              When sending output from a job, <u><a href="../man7/systemd.cron.7.html">systemd.cron</a></u>(7) will look at MAILFROM.  If  MAILFROM  is  defined,
              mail is sent from this email address.  Otherwise it's seen as being sent by "root".

       <b>CRON_MAIL_SUCCESS</b>
              Control if (when) to send mail with output from successful jobs.
              <b>'nonempty'</b>, <b>'non-empty'</b>:  mail  is  only  sent if the job left anything in the journal (i.e. wrote
              something to the standard output or error streams); this is the default, and matches classic cron
              <b>'always'</b>, <b>'yes'</b>, <b>'true'</b>, <b>'1'</b>: always send mail
              <b>'never'</b>, <b>'no'</b>, <b>'false'</b>, <b>'0'</b>: never send mail for a successful job

              Mail is <u>always</u> sent for failed jobs.

       <b>CRON_MAIL_FORMAT</b>
              Control the format of the content of cron-job-related messages.
              <b>'normal'</b>: <b>systemctl</b> <b>status</b> + <b>journalctl</b> output (incl. time, process names, the usual) for the run;
              this is the default
              <b>'nometadata'</b>, <b>'no-metadata'</b>: raw journal contents (<b>-o</b> <b>cat</b>: just standard output + error  streams);
              this matches classic cron

              <b>CRON_MAIL_SUCCESS</b>  and  <b>CRON_MAIL_FORMAT</b>, if changed in <u><a href="file:/etc/crontab">/etc/crontab</a></u>, are remembered for all other
              crontabs (<u><a href="file:/etc/cron.d">/etc/cron.d</a></u>, <u>/etc/anacron</u>,  users' crontabs)  and  act  as  an  administrator-controlled
              default.  They can be set to <b>'inherit'</b> to get that default back.

       <b>CRON_INHERIT_VARIABLES</b>
              In  the  top-level  <u><a href="file:/etc/crontab">/etc/crontab</a></u>:  a  whitespace-separated  list  of  variables (<u>including</u> control
              statements that get removed from the  environment  otherwise)  to  remember  into  other  crontabs
              (<u><a href="file:/etc/cron.d">/etc/cron.d</a></u>,   users' crontabs;   not   <u>/etc/anacron</u>).    This   allows   instituting   a  global
              <b>RANDOM_DELAY</b>/<b>SHELL</b>/&amp;c. default policy.
              Elsewhere: ignored.

       <b>RANDOM_DELAY</b>
              (in minutes) environment variable is translated to <b>RandomizedDelaySec=</b>.

       <b>DELAY</b>  (in minutes) environment variable is translated to <b>OnBootSec=</b>.  This works like the 'delay'  field
              of  <a href="../man5/anacrontab.5.html">anacrontab</a>(5)  and make systemd wait # minutes after boot before starting the unit. This value
              can also be used to spread out the start times  of  @daily/@weekly/@monthly...  jobs  on  a  24/24
              system.

       <b>START_HOURS_RANGE</b>
              (in  hours)  environment  variable  is  translated  to  the <u>'hour'</u> component of <b>OnCalendar=</b>.  This
              variable is inherited from <a href="../man5/anacrontab.5.html">anacrontab</a>(5), but also supported  in  <a href="../man5/crontab.5.html">crontab</a>(5)  by  systemd-crontab-
              generator.  Anacron  expect  a  time  range  in  the  START-END format (eg: 6-9), systemd-crontab-
              generator will only use the starting hour  of  the  range  as  reference.   Unless  you  set  this
              variable,  all  the  @daily/@weekly/@monthly/@yearly  jobs  will  run at midnight. If you set this
              variable and the system was off during the ours defined in the range, the  (persistent)  job  will
              start at boot.

       <b>PERSISTENT</b>
              With this flag, you can override the generator default heuristic.
              <b>'yes'</b>: force all further jobs to be persistent
              <b>'auto'</b>: only recognize @ keywords to be persistent (this is the default)
              <b>'no'</b>: force all further jobs not to be persistent

       <b>TZ</b>, <b>CRON_TZ</b>
              The  job  is  scheduled in this time-zone instead of in the system time-zone.  Must be a full IANA
              time-zone name (as found under <u><a href="file:/usr/share/zoneinfo">/usr/share/zoneinfo</a></u>), or empty to reset to  the  default  timezone,
              otherwise no special semantics.  Always passed to the job.

       <b>BATCH</b>  This  boolean  flag  is  translated to options <b>CPUSchedulingPolicy=idle</b> and <b>IOSchedulingClass=idle</b>
              when set.

       The format of a <b>cron</b> <b>command</b> is the same as the one defined by the cron daemon.  Each line has five  time
       and  date  fields,  followed  by  a  command, followed by a newline character ('\n').  The system crontab
       (<a href="file:/etc/crontab">/etc/crontab</a>) and the packages crontabs (<a href="file:/etc/cron.d/">/etc/cron.d/</a>*) use the same format, except  that  the  username
       for  the  command  is  specified after the time and date fields and before the command. The fields may be
       separated by spaces or tabs.

       Commands are executed by <u>systemd</u> when the minute, hour, and month of year fields match the current  time,
       <u>and</u>  when  at  least one of the two day fields (day of month, or day of week) match the current time (see
       ``Note'' below).  The time and date fields are:

              field          allowed values
              -----          --------------
              minute         0-59
              hour           0-23
              day of month   1-31
              month          1-12 (or names, see below)
              day of week    0-7 (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names)

       A field may be an asterisk (*), which always stands for ``first-last''.

       Ranges of numbers are allowed.  Ranges are two numbers separated with a hyphen.  The specified  range  is
       inclusive.  For example, 8-11 for an ``hours'' entry specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10 and 11.

       A  random  value  (within  the  legal  range) may be obtained by using the `~' character in a field.  The
       interval of the random value may be specified explicitly, for example ``0~30'' will result  in  a  random
       value  between  0  and  30  inclusive.   If either (or both) of the numbers on either side of the `~' are
       omitted, the appropriate limit (low or high) for the field will be used.

       Lists are allowed.  A list is a set of numbers (or ranges) separated by commas.   Examples:  ``1,2,5,9'',
       ``0-4,8-12''.

       Step values can be used in conjunction with ranges.  Following a range with ``/&lt;number&gt;'' specifies skips
       of  the  number's  value  through  the  range.  For example, ``0-23/2'' can be used in the hours field to
       specify   command   execution   every   other   hour   (the   alternative   in   the   V7   standard   is
       ``0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22'').   Steps  are also permitted after an asterisk, so if you want to say
       ``every two hours'', just use ``*/2''.

       Names can also be used for the ``month'' and ``day of week'' fields.  Use the first three letters of  the
       particular day or month (case doesn't matter).  Ranges or lists of names are not allowed.

       The  ``sixth''  field (the rest of the line) specifies the command to be run.  The entire command portion
       of the line will be executed by <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a> or by the shell specified in the SHELL variable  of  the  crontab
       file.

       If  the command contains an unescaped <b>%</b> character, it is instead split thereon: the part before is run by
       the shell, the part after is given on the standard input stream, with each subsequent  <b>%</b>  replaced  by  a
       newline.  <b>%</b>s can be escaped as <b>\%</b>, and produce a literal %<b>.</b>

       systemd-crontab-generator doesn't handle multi-line command split by the <b>%</b> character like vixie-cron.

       Note:  The  day  of a command's execution can be specified by two fields — day of month, and day of week.
       If both fields are restricted (i.e., aren't <b>*</b>), the command will be run when  <u>either</u>  field  matches  the
       current time.  For example,
       ``30  4  1,15  *  5''  would cause a command to be run at 4:30 am on the 1st and 15th of each month, plus
       every Friday. One can, however, achieve the desired result by adding a test to the command (see the  last
       example in EXAMPLE CRON FILE below).

       Instead of the first five fields, one of eight special strings may appear:

              string         meaning
              ------         -------
              @reboot        Run once, at startup.
              @yearly        Run once a year, "0 0 1 1 *".
              @annually      (same as @yearly)
              @monthly       Run once a month, "0 0 1 * *".
              @weekly        Run once a week, "0 0 * * 0".
              @daily         Run once a day, "0 0 * * *".
              @midnight      (same as @daily)
              @hourly        Run once an hour, "0 * * * *".

       Please  note  that  startup,  as far as @reboot is concerned, may be before some system daemons, or other
       facilities, were startup.  This is due to the boot order sequence of the machine.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b> <b>CRON</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The following lists an example of a user crontab file.

       # use <a href="file:/bin/bash">/bin/bash</a> to run commands, instead of the default <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
       SHELL=<a href="file:/bin/bash">/bin/bash</a>
       # mail errors to `paul', no matter whose crontab this is
       MAILTO=paul
       #
       # run five minutes after midnight, every day
       5 0 * * *       $HOME/bin/daily.job &gt;&gt; $HOME/tmp/out 2&gt;&amp;1
       # run at 2:15pm on the first of every month
       15 14 1 * *     $HOME/bin/monthly
       # run at 10 pm on weekdays, annoy Joe
       # runs 'mail -s "It's 10 pm" joe', with 'Joe,\n\nWhere are your kids?\n' on stdin
       0 22 * * 1-5    mail -s "It's 10pm" joe%Joe,%%Where are your kids?%
       23 0-23/2 * * * echo "run 23 minutes after midn, 2am, 4am ..., everyday"
       5 4 * * sun     echo "run at 5 after 4 every sunday"
       # Run on every second Saturday of the month
       0 4 8-14 * *    test $(date +\%u) -eq 6 &amp;&amp; echo "2nd Saturday"

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b> <b>SYSTEM</b> <b>CRON</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The following lists the content of a regular system-wide crontab file. Unlike a user's crontab, this file
       has the username field, as used by /etc/crontab.

       # <a href="file:/etc/crontab">/etc/crontab</a>: system-wide crontab
       # Unlike any other crontab you don't have to run the `crontab'
       # command to install the new version when you edit this file
       # and files in /etc/cron.d. These files also have username fields,
       # that none of the other crontabs do.

       SHELL=<a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>
       PATH=<a href="file:/usr/local/sbin">/usr/local/sbin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>:<a href="file:/sbin">/sbin</a>:<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>

       # m h dom mon dow usercommand
       17 * * * *  root  cd / &amp;&amp; run-parts --report <a href="file:/etc/cron.hourly">/etc/cron.hourly</a>
       25 6 * * *  root  test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / &amp;&amp; run-parts --report <a href="file:/etc/cron.daily">/etc/cron.daily</a> )
       47 6 * * 7  root  test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / &amp;&amp; run-parts --report <a href="file:/etc/cron.weekly">/etc/cron.weekly</a> )
       52 6 1 * *  root  test -x /usr/sbin/anacron || ( cd / &amp;&amp; run-parts --report <a href="file:/etc/cron.monthly">/etc/cron.monthly</a> )
       #

       This is only an example, <b>systemd-cron</b> <b>uses</b> <b>native</b> <b>units</b> <b>instead</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> <b>jobs.</b>
       If you add those lines, your jobs will run twice.

</pre><h4><b>SEE</b> <b>ALSO</b></h4><pre>
       <a href="../man7/systemd.cron.7.html">systemd.cron</a>(7), <a href="../man8/systemd-crontab-generator.8.html">systemd-crontab-generator</a>(8), <a href="../man1/crontab.1.html">crontab</a>(1)

       Some extra settings can only be tweaked with

           systemctl edit cron-&lt;schedule&gt;.[timer|service]

       see <a href="../man7/systemd.cron.7.html">systemd.cron</a>(7) for more details.

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>crontab</u> syntax does not make it possible to define all possible periods one could  imagine  off.  For
       example,  it is not straightforward to define the last weekday of a month. If a task needs to be run in a
       specific period of time that cannot be defined in the <u>crontab</u> syntaxs the best approach would be to  have
       the  program itself check the date and time information and continue execution only if the period matches
       the desired one.

       <b>systemd-crontab-generator</b> doesn't support these <b>vixie-cron</b> features:

       *      spawning forking daemons, the 'Service' units are all set with 'Type=oneshot'

       *      vixie-cron requires that each entry in a crontab end in a newline character. If the last entry  in
              a  crontab  is missing a newline (ie, terminated by EOF), vixie-cron will consider the crontab (at
              least partially) broken.
              systemd-crontab-generator considers this crontab as valid

</pre><h4><b>DIAGNOSTICS</b></h4><pre>
       You can see how your crontab where translated by typing:
       <b>systemctl</b> <b>cat</b> <b>cron-&lt;userid&gt;-*</b>

       <b>systemctl</b> <b>cat</b> does support command-line completion.
