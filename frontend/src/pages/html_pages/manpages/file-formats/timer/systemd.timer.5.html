</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       systemd.timer - Timer unit configuration

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>timer</u>.timer

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A unit configuration file whose name ends in ".timer" encodes information about a timer controlled and
       supervised by systemd, for timer-based activation.

       This man page lists the configuration options specific to this unit type. See <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5) for the
       common options of all unit configuration files. The common configuration items are configured in the
       generic [Unit] and [Install] sections. The timer specific configuration options are configured in the
       [Timer] section.

       For each timer file, a matching unit file must exist, describing the unit to activate when the timer
       elapses. By default, a service by the same name as the timer (except for the suffix) is activated.
       Example: a timer file foo.timer activates a matching service foo.service. The unit to activate may be
       controlled by <u>Unit=</u> (see below).

       Note that in case the unit to activate is already active at the time the timer elapses it is not
       restarted, but simply left running. There is no concept of spawning new service instances in this case.
       Due to this, services with <u>RemainAfterExit=yes</u> set (which stay around continuously even after the
       service's main process exited) are usually not suitable for activation via repetitive timers, as they
       will only be activated once, and then stay around forever. Target units, which by default do not
       deactivate on their own, can be activated repeatedly by timers by setting <u>StopWhenUnneeded=yes</u> on them.
       This will cause a target unit to be stopped immediately after its activation, if it is not a dependency
       of another running unit.

</pre><h4><b>AUTOMATIC</b> <b>DEPENDENCIES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Implicit</b> <b>Dependencies</b>
       The following dependencies are implicitly added:

       •   Timer units automatically gain a <u>Before=</u> dependency on the service they are supposed to activate.

   <b>Default</b> <b>Dependencies</b>
       The following dependencies are added unless <u>DefaultDependencies=no</u> is set:

       •   Timer units will automatically have dependencies of type <u>Requires=</u> and <u>After=</u> on sysinit.target, a
           dependency of type <u>Before=</u> on timers.target, as well as <u>Conflicts=</u> and <u>Before=</u> on shutdown.target to
           ensure that they are stopped cleanly prior to system shutdown. Only timer units involved with early
           boot or late system shutdown should disable the <u>DefaultDependencies=</u> option.

       •   Timer units with at least one <u>OnCalendar=</u> directive acquire a pair of additional <u>After=</u> dependencies
           on time-set.target and time-sync.target, in order to avoid being started before the system clock has
           been correctly set. See <b><a href="../man7/systemd.special.7.html">systemd.special</a></b>(7) for details on these two targets.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Timer unit files may include [Unit] and [Install] sections, which are described in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5).

       Timer unit files must include a [Timer] section, which carries information about the timer it defines.
       The options specific to the [Timer] section of timer units are the following:

       <u>OnActiveSec=</u>, <u>OnBootSec=</u>, <u>OnStartupSec=</u>, <u>OnUnitActiveSec=</u>, <u>OnUnitInactiveSec=</u>
           Defines monotonic timers relative to different starting points:

           Multiple directives may be combined of the same and of different types, in which case the timer unit
           will trigger whenever any of the specified timer expressions elapse. For example, by combining
           <u>OnBootSec=</u> and <u>OnUnitActiveSec=</u>, it is possible to define a timer that elapses in regular intervals
           and activates a specific service each time. Moreover, both monotonic time expressions and <u>OnCalendar=</u>
           calendar expressions may be combined in the same timer unit.

           The arguments to the directives are time spans configured in seconds. Example: "OnBootSec=50" means
           50s after boot-up. The argument may also include time units. Example: "OnBootSec=5h 30min" means 5
           hours and 30 minutes after boot-up. For details about the syntax of time spans, see <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7).

           If a timer configured with <u>OnBootSec=</u> or <u>OnStartupSec=</u> is already in the past when the timer unit is
           activated, it will immediately elapse and the configured unit is started. This is not the case for
           timers defined in the other directives.

           These are monotonic timers, independent of wall-clock time and timezones. If the computer is
           temporarily suspended, the monotonic clock generally pauses, too. Note that if <u>WakeSystem=</u> is used, a
           different monotonic clock is selected that continues to advance while the system is suspended and
           thus can be used as the trigger to resume the system.

           If the empty string is assigned to any of these options, the list of timers is reset (both monotonic
           timers and <u>OnCalendar=</u> timers, see below), and all prior assignments will have no effect.

           Note that timers do not necessarily expire at the precise time configured with these settings, as
           they are subject to the <u>AccuracySec=</u> setting below.

       <u>OnCalendar=</u>
           Defines realtime (i.e. wallclock) timers with calendar event expressions. See <b><a href="../man7/systemd.time.7.html">systemd.time</a></b>(7) for
           more information on the syntax of calendar event expressions. Otherwise, the semantics are similar to
           <u>OnActiveSec=</u> and related settings.

           Note that timers do not necessarily expire at the precise time configured with this setting, as it is
           subject to the <u>AccuracySec=</u> setting below.

           May be specified more than once, in which case the timer unit will trigger whenever any of the
           specified expressions elapse. Moreover, calendar timers and monotonic timers (see above) may be
           combined within the same timer unit.

           If the empty string is assigned to any of these options, the list of timers is reset (both
           <u>OnCalendar=</u> timers and monotonic timers, see above), and all prior assignments will have no effect.

           Note that calendar timers might be triggered at unexpected times if the system's realtime clock is
           not set correctly. Specifically, on systems that lack a battery-buffered Realtime Clock (RTC) it
           might be wise to enable systemd-time-wait-sync.service to ensure the clock is adjusted to a network
           time source <u>before</u> the timer event is set up. Timer units with at least one <u>OnCalendar=</u> expression
           are automatically ordered after time-sync.target, which systemd-time-wait-sync.service is ordered
           before.

           When a system is temporarily put to sleep (i.e. system suspend or hibernation) the realtime clock
           does not pause. When a calendar timer elapses while the system is sleeping it will not be acted on
           immediately, but once the system is later resumed it will catch up and process all timers that
           triggered while the system was sleeping. Note that if a calendar timer elapsed more than once while
           the system was continuously sleeping the timer will only result in a single service activation. If
           <u>WakeSystem=</u> (see below) is enabled a calendar time event elapsing while the system is suspended will
           cause the system to wake up (under the condition the system's hardware supports time-triggered
           wake-up functionality).

           Added in version 197.

       <u>AccuracySec=</u>
           Specify the accuracy the timer shall elapse with. Defaults to 1min. The timer is scheduled to elapse
           within a time window starting with the time specified in <u>OnCalendar=</u>, <u>OnActiveSec=</u>, <u>OnBootSec=</u>,
           <u>OnStartupSec=</u>, <u>OnUnitActiveSec=</u> or <u>OnUnitInactiveSec=</u> and ending the time configured with
           <u>AccuracySec=</u> later. Within this time window, the expiry time will be placed at a host-specific,
           randomized, but stable position that is synchronized between all local timer units. This is done in
           order to optimize power consumption to suppress unnecessary CPU wake-ups. To get best accuracy, set
           this option to 1us. Note that the timer is still subject to the timer slack configured via <b><a href="../man5/systemdsystem.conf.5.html">systemd-</a></b>
           <b><a href="../man5/systemdsystem.conf.5.html">system.conf</a></b>(5)'s <u>TimerSlackNSec=</u> setting. See <b><a href="../man2/prctl.2.html">prctl</a></b>(2) for details. To optimize power consumption,
           make sure to set this value as high as possible and as low as necessary.

           Note that this setting is primarily a power saving option that allows coalescing CPU wake-ups. It
           should not be confused with <u>RandomizedDelaySec=</u> (see below) which adds a random value to the time the
           timer shall elapse next and whose purpose is the opposite: to stretch elapsing of timer events over a
           longer period to reduce workload spikes. For further details and explanations and how both settings
           play together, see below.

           Added in version 209.

       <u>RandomizedDelaySec=</u>
           Delay the timer by a randomly selected, evenly distributed amount of time between 0 and the specified
           time value. Defaults to 0, indicating that no randomized delay shall be applied. Each timer unit will
           determine this delay randomly before each iteration, unless modified with <u>FixedRandomDelay=</u>, see
           below. The delay is added on top of the next determined elapsing time or the service manager's
           startup time, whichever is later.

           This setting is useful to stretch dispatching of similarly configured timer events over a certain
           time interval, to prevent them from firing all at the same time, possibly resulting in resource
           congestion.

           Note the relation to <u>AccuracySec=</u> above: the latter allows the service manager to coalesce timer
           events within a specified time range in order to minimize wakeups, while this setting does the
           opposite: it stretches timer events over an interval, to make it unlikely that they fire
           simultaneously. If <u>RandomizedDelaySec=</u> and <u>AccuracySec=</u> are used in conjunction, first the randomized
           delay is added, and then the result is possibly further shifted to coalesce it with other timer
           events happening on the system. As mentioned above <u>AccuracySec=</u> defaults to 1 minute and
           <u>RandomizedDelaySec=</u> to 0, thus encouraging coalescing of timer events. In order to optimally stretch
           timer events over a certain range of time, set <u>AccuracySec=1us</u> and <u>RandomizedDelaySec=</u> to some higher
           value.

           Added in version 229.

       <u>FixedRandomDelay=</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. When enabled, the randomized delay specified by <u>RandomizedDelaySec=</u> is
           chosen deterministically, and remains stable between all firings of the same timer, even if the
           manager is restarted. The delay is derived from the machine ID, the manager's user identifier, and
           the timer unit's name. This effectively creates a unique fixed offset for each timer, reducing the
           jitter in firings of an individual timer while still avoiding firing at the same time as other
           similarly configured timers.

           This setting has an effect only if <u>RandomizedDelaySec=</u> is not 0. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

           Added in version 247.

       <u>DeferReactivation=</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. When enabled, the timer schedules the next elapse based on the trigger unit
           entering inactivity, instead of the last trigger time. This is most apparent in the case where the
           service unit takes longer to run than the timer interval. With this setting enabled, the timer will
           schedule the next elapse based on when the service finishes running, and so it will have to wait
           until the next realtime elapse time to trigger. Otherwise, the default behavior is for the timer unit
           to immediately trigger again once the service finishes running. This happens because the timer
           schedules the next elapse based on the previous trigger time, and since the interval is shorter than
           the service runtime, that elapse will be in the past, causing it to immediately trigger once done.

           This setting has an effect only if a realtime timer has been specified with <u>OnCalendar=</u>. Defaults to
           <b>false</b>.

           Added in version 257.

       <u>OnClockChange=</u>, <u>OnTimezoneChange=</u>
           These options take boolean arguments. When true, the service unit will be triggered when the system
           clock (<b>CLOCK_REALTIME</b>) jumps relative to the monotonic clock (<b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</b>), or when the local
           system timezone is modified. These options can be used alone or in combination with other timer
           expressions (see above) within the same timer unit. These options default to <b>false</b>.

           Added in version 242.

       <u>Unit=</u>
           The unit to activate when this timer elapses. The argument is a unit name, whose suffix is not
           ".timer". If not specified, this value defaults to a service that has the same name as the timer
           unit, except for the suffix. (See above.) It is recommended that the unit name that is activated and
           the unit name of the timer unit are named identically, except for the suffix.

       <u>Persistent=</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. If true, the time when the service unit was last triggered is stored on
           disk. When the timer is activated, the service unit is triggered immediately if it would have been
           triggered at least once during the time when the timer was inactive. Such triggering is nonetheless
           subject to the delay imposed by <u>RandomizedDelaySec=</u>. This is useful to catch up on missed runs of the
           service when the system was powered down. Note that this setting only has an effect on timers
           configured with <u>OnCalendar=</u>. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

           Use <b>systemctl</b> <b>clean</b> <b>--what=state</b> <b>...</b>  on the timer unit to remove the timestamp file maintained by
           this option from disk. In particular, use this command before uninstalling a timer unit. See
           <b><a href="../man1/systemctl.1.html">systemctl</a></b>(1) for details.

           Added in version 212.

       <u>WakeSystem=</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. If true, an elapsing timer will cause the system to resume from suspend,
           should it be suspended and if the system supports this. Note that this option will only make sure the
           system resumes on the appropriate times, it will not take care of suspending it again after any work
           that is to be done is finished. Defaults to <b>false</b>.

           Note that this functionality requires privileges and is thus generally only available in the system
           service manager.

           Note that behaviour of monotonic clock timers (as configured with <u>OnActiveSec=</u>, <u>OnBootSec=</u>,
           <u>OnStartupSec=</u>, <u>OnUnitActiveSec=</u>, <u>OnUnitInactiveSec=</u>, see above) is altered depending on this option.
           If false, a monotonic clock is used that is paused during system suspend (<b>CLOCK_MONOTONIC</b>), if true a
           different monotonic clock is used that continues advancing during system suspend (<b>CLOCK_BOOTTIME</b>),
           see <b><a href="../man2/clock_getres.2.html">clock_getres</a></b>(2) for details.

           Added in version 212.

       <u>RemainAfterElapse=</u>
           Takes a boolean argument. If true, a timer will stay loaded, and its state remains queryable even
           after it elapsed and the associated unit (as configured with <u>Unit=</u>, see above) deactivated again. If
           false, an elapsed timer unit that cannot elapse anymore is unloaded once its associated unit
           deactivated again. Turning this off is particularly useful for transient timer units. Note that this
           setting has an effect when repeatedly starting a timer unit: if <u>RemainAfterElapse=</u> is on, starting
           the timer a second time has no effect. However, if <u>RemainAfterElapse=</u> is off and the timer unit was
           already unloaded, it can be started again, and thus the service can be triggered multiple times.
           Defaults to <b>true</b>.

           Added in version 229.
