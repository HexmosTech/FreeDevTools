</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       sane-kodak - SANE backend for big Kodak flatbed and ADF scanners

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>sane-kodak</b> library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend which provides access to large
       Kodak flatbed and ADF scanners.

       This document describes backend version 7, which shipped with SANE 1.0.21.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>HARDWARE</b></h4><pre>
       This  version should support models which speak the Kodak SCSI and Firewire protocols. The i1860 was used
       to develop the backend, but other models may work with only minimal modifications. Please see the list at
       <u><a href="http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html">http://www.sane-project.org/sane-supported-devices.html</a></u> for an updated list.

       If you have a machine not on that list, or reported as 'untested': the best way  to  determine  level  of
       support  is  to test the scanner directly, or to collect a trace of the windows driver in action.  Please
       contact the author for help or with test results.

</pre><h4><b>UNSUPPORTED</b> <b>HARDWARE</b></h4><pre>
       Most of the recent Kodak consumer or workgroup level machines are based on other  chipsets  and  are  not
       supported by this backend. Some of these scanners may be supported by another backend.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Effort has been made to expose the basic hardware options, including:

       <b>--source</b> <b>s</b>
              Selects  the  source  for  the  scan. Options may include "Flatbed", "ADF Front", "ADF Back", "ADF
              Duplex".

       <b>--mode</b> <b>m</b>
              Selects the mode for the scan. Options may include "Lineart", "Halftone", "Gray", and "Color".

       <b>--resolution</b>
              Controls scan resolution. Available choices may be limited by mode.

       <b>--tl-x</b>, <b>--tl-y</b>, <b>--br-x</b>, <b>--br-y</b>
              Sets scan area upper left and lower right coordinates. These are renamed <b>-t</b>, <b>-l</b>, <b>-x</b>,  <b>-y</b>  by  some
              frontends.

       <b>--page-width</b>, <b>--page-height</b>
              Sets  paper  size.  Used  by scanner to determine centering of scan coordinates when using the ADF
              (Automatic Document Feeder) and to detect double feed errors.

       Other options will be available based on the capabilities of the scanner.  Use <u>scanimage</u> <u>--help</u> to get  a
       list,  but  be  aware  that  some options may be settable only when another option has been set, and that
       advanced options may be hidden by some frontend programs.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILE</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration file <u>kodak.conf</u> is used to tell the backend how  to  look  for  scanners,  and  provide
       options  controlling  the  operation  of  the backend.  This file is read each time the frontend asks the
       backend for a list of scanners, generally only when the frontend starts. If  the  configuration  file  is
       missing,  the  backend  will  use  a  set  of  compiled  defaults,  which  are  identical  to the default
       configuration file shipped with SANE.

       Scanners can be specified in the configuration file in 2 ways:

       "scsi KODAK"
              Requests backend to search all scsi buses in the system for a device which reports itself to be  a
              scanner made by 'KODAK'.

       "scsi /dev/sg0" (or other scsi device file)
              Requests  backend  to  open  the  named  scsi  device. Only useful if you have multiple compatible
              scanners connected to your system, and need to specify one. Probably should not be used  with  the
              other "scsi" line above.

       The  only configuration option supported is "buffer-size=xxx", allowing you to set the number of bytes in
       the data buffer to something other than the compiled-in default, 32768  (32K).  Some  users  report  that
       their scanner will "hang" mid-page, or fail to transmit the image if the buffer is not large enough.

       Note:  This  option  may  appear  multiple  times  in the configuration file. It only applies to scanners
       discovered by 'scsi/usb' lines that follow this option.

       Note: The backend does not place an upper bound on this value, as some users  required  it  to  be  quite
       large.  Values  above  the  default  are  not recommended, and may crash your OS or lockup your scsi card
       driver. You have been warned.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       The backend uses a single environment variable,  <b>SANE_DEBUG_KODAK</b>,  which  enables  debugging  output  to
       stderr. Valid values are:

              5  Errors
              10 Function trace
              15 Function detail
              20 Option commands
              25 SCSI trace
              30 SCSI detail
              35 Useless noise

</pre><h4><b>KNOWN</b> <b>ISSUES</b></h4><pre>
       Most  hardware  options  are  either  not  supported  or  not exposed for control by the user, including:
       multifeed detection, image compression, autocropping, endorser, thresholding, multi-stream, etc.
