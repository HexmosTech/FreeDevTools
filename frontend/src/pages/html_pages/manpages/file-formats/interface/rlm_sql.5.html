       rlm_sql - FreeRADIUS Module

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>rlm_sql</u>  module provides an SQL interface to retrieve authorization information and store accounting
       information.  It can be used in conjunction with, or in lieu of the files and detail  modules.   The  SQL
       module has drivers to support the following SQL databases:

            db2
            iodbc
            mysql
            oracle
            postgresql
            sybase
            unixodbc

       Due  to the size of the configuration variables, the sql module is usually configured in a separate file,
       which is included in the main radiusd.conf via an include directive.

       The main configuration items to be aware of are:

       driver This variable specifies the driver to be loaded.

       server

       login

       password
              These specify the servername, username, and password  the  module  will  use  to  connect  to  the
              database.

       radius_db
              The name of the database where the radius tables are stored.

       acct_table1

       acct_table2
              These  specify  the  tables  names  for accounting records.  acct_table1 specifies the table where
              Start records are stored.  acct_table2 specifies the table where Stop records are stored.  In most
              cases, this should be the same table.

       postauth_table
              The name of the table to store post-authentication data.

       authcheck_table

       authreply_table
              The tables where individual Check-Items and Reply-Items are stored.

       groupcheck_table

       groupreply_table
              The tables where group Check-Items and Reply-Items are stored.

       usergroup_table
              The table where username to group relationships are stored.

       deletestalesessions
              This option is set to 'yes' or 'no'.  If you are doing Simultaneous-Use checking, and this is  set
              to  yes,  stale  sessions ( defined as sessions for which a Stop record was not received ) will be
              cleared.

       logfile
              This option is useful for debugging sql problems.  If logfile is set then all sql queries for  the
              containing  section  are  written  to  the  file specified.  This is useful for debugging and bulk
              inserts.

       num_sql_socks
              The number of sql connections to make to the database.

       connect_failure_retry_delay
              The number of seconds to wait before attempting to reconnect to a failed database connection.

       sql_user_name
              This is the definition of the SQL-User-Name attribute.  This is set once,  so  that  you  can  use
              %{SQL-User-Name}  in  the SQL queries, rather than the nested username substitution.  This ensures
              that Username is parsed consistently for all SQL queries executed.

       default_user_profile
              This is the default profile name that will be applied to all users if set.  This  is  not  set  by
              default.

       query_on_not_found
              This  option is set to 'yes' or 'no'.  If set to yes, then the default user profile is returned if
              no specific match was found for the user.

       authorize_check_query

       authorize_reply_query
              These queries are run during the authorization stage to extract the user authorization information
              from the ${authcheck_table} and ${authreply_table}.

       authorize_group_check_query

       authorize_group_reply_query
              These queries  are  run  during  the  authorization  stage  to  extract  the  group  authorization
              information from the ${groupcheck_table} and ${groupreply_table}.

       accounting_onoff_query
              The query to be run when receiving an Accounting On or Accounting Off packet.

       accounting_update_query

       accounting_update_query_alt
              The  query  to be run when receiving an Accounting Update packet.  If the primary query fails, the
              alt query is run.

       accounting_start_query

       accounting_start_query_alt
              The query to be run when receiving an Accounting Start packet.  If the primary  query  fails,  the
              alt query is run.

       accounting_stop_query

       accounting_stop_query_alt
              The query to be run when receiving an Accounting Stop packet.  If the primary query fails, the alt
              query is run.

       simul_count_query
              The  query  to  be  run  to  return  the number simultaneous sessions for the purposes of limiting
              Simultaneous Use.

       simul_verify_query
              The query to return the detail information needed to confirm that all suspected connected sessions
              are valid, and are not stale sessions.

       group_membership_query
              The query to run to check user group membership.

       postauth_query
              The query to run during the post-authentication stage.
