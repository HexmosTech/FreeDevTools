</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       netctl.profile - Profile options

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       netctl.profile

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Profiles for netctl live under <u>/etc/netctl/</u> and are plain text files. The files consist of variable
       definitions following the bash shell syntax and are not expected to execute any code. It is good to omit
       as much quoting as possible. For a few WPA-related variables, special quoting rules (see below) apply.

       The name of the profile is the name of the file. Profile names must not contain newlines and should not
       end in <u>.action</u>, <u>.conf</u>, or <u>.service</u>. Whenever a profile is read, all executable scripts in
       <u>/etc/netctl/hooks/</u> and any executable script in <u>/etc/netctl/interfaces/</u> with the name of the interface
       for the profile are sourced. The name of the current profile is available via the <u>Profile</u> variable in the
       environment of the sourced scripts. On starting or stopping a profile, the respective command is
       available via the <u>Command</u> variable. Declarations in an interface script override declarations in a
       profile, which override declarations in hooks. For each connection type, there are example profile files
       in <u>/etc/netctl/examples/</u>.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABLE</b> <b>CONNECTION</b> <b>TYPES</b></h4><pre>

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Description=</u>
           A description of the profile.

       <u>Connection=</u> [mandatory for all profiles]
           The connection type used by the profile.

       <u>Interface=</u> [mandatory for all profiles]
           The name of the associated network interface. The interface name should not be quoted.

       <u>BindsToInterfaces=()</u>
           An array of physical network interfaces that this profile needs before it can be started. For
           ‘enabled’ profiles, <b>systemd</b> will wait for the presence of the specified interfaces before starting a
           profile. If this variable is not specified, it defaults to the value of <u>Interface=</u>.

       <u>MACAddress=</u>
           Optional MAC address for newly created interfaces. When set to the name of an existing interface, the
           address of that interface is used. The connection types that create an interface and are able to set
           a MAC address are bond, bridge, dummy, vlan, and macvlan.

       <u>After=()</u>
           An array of profile names that should be started before this profile is started. This is only an
           ordering dependency and is not intended to be a list of profiles that this profile requires. The
           meaning is the same as <u>After=</u> in <b><a href="../man5/systemd.unit.5.html">systemd.unit</a></b>(5).

       <u>WaitOnline=</u>
           Set to ‘yes’ to consider the profile activated only when it is online. Defaults to ‘no’.

       <u>ExecUpPost=</u>
           A command that is executed after a connection is established. If the specified command returns
           anything other than 0 (success), <b>netctl</b> will abort and stop the profile. If the command should be
           allowed to fail, add ‘|| true’ to the end of it.

       <u>ExecDownPre=</u>
           A command that is executed before a connection is brought down. Similar precautions should be taken
           as with <u>ExecUpPost=</u>.

       <u>TimeoutUp</u>
           Maximum time, in seconds, to wait for an interface to get up. Defaults to ‘5’.

       <u>ForceConnect=</u>
           Set to ‘yes’ to force connecting even if the interface is up. Do not use this unless you know what
           you are doing.

       <u>ExcludeAuto=</u>
           Whether or not to exclude this profile from automatic profile selection. Defaults to ‘no’ for
           wireless and DHCP enabled connections and to ‘yes’ otherwise.

       <u>NETCTL_DEBUG=</u>
           Set to ‘yes’ to generate debugging output.

</pre><h4><b>IP</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>

           The name of the DHCPv6 client to use. By default, ‘dhcpcd’ and ‘dhclient’ are supported. Command line
           options for the IPv6 instance of <b><a href="../man8/dhcpcd.8.html">dhcpcd</a></b>(8) are read from <u>DhcpcdOptions6=</u>. Command line options for
           the IPv6 instance of <b><a href="../man8/dhclient.8.html">dhclient</a></b>(8) are read from <u>DhclientOptions6=</u>. Defaults to ‘dhclient’.

       <u>DHCPReleaseOnStop=</u>
           Set to ‘yes’ to release the DHCP lease when the profile is stopped.

       The name of the vlan interface is specified in <u>Interface=</u>. The underlying physical interface is specified
       in <u>BindsToInterfaces=</u>. Hence, for vlan profiles, <u>BindsToInterfaces=</u> contains the name of a single network
       interface.

       All options for connections of the ‘ethernet’ type are understood for connections of the ‘vlan’ type.
       Additionally, connections of the ‘vlan’ type must set a vlan identifier using <u>VLANID=</u>. See <b><a href="../man8/ip.8.html">ip</a></b>(8) for
       details.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>‘MACVLAN’</b> <b>CONNECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The name of the macvlan interface is specified in <u>Interface=</u>. The underlying physical interface is
       specified in <u>BindsToInterfaces=</u>. Hence, for macvlan profiles, <u>BindsToInterfaces=</u> contains the name of a
       single network interface.

       All options for connections of the ‘ethernet’ type are understood for connections of the ‘macvlan’ type.
       Next to the <b>ip</b> <b>options</b>, the following are understood for connections of the ‘macvlan’ type:

       <u>Mode=</u>
           Either ‘bridge’, ‘vepa’, ‘private’, or ‘passthru’. See <b><a href="../man8/ip.8.html">ip</a></b>(8) for details.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>‘WIREGUARD’</b> <b>CONNECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The name of the WireGuard interface is specified in <u>Interface=</u>. Next to the <b>ip</b> <b>options</b>, the following are
       understood for connections of the ‘wireguard’ type:

       <u>WGConfigFile=</u>
           Path to a <b>WireGuard</b> configuration file. Defaults to <u>/etc/wireguard/$Interface.conf</u>.

</pre><h4><b>SPECIAL</b> <b>QUOTING</b> <b>RULES</b></h4><pre>
       Configuration files for <b>wpa_supplicant</b> use non-standard quoting. Therefore, non-standard quoting rules
       exist for some variables for connections of the ‘wireless’ type. In particular, these variables are
       <u>ESSID=</u>, and <u>Key=</u>.

       A variable is considered <b>quoted</b> by <b>wpa_supplicant</b> if it is enclosed in double quotes ("). A variable is
       considered <b>non-quoted</b> by <b>wpa_supplicant</b> if it does not start with a double quote. Hexadecimal values are
       specified <b>non-quoted</b> in configuration files of <b>wpa_supplicant</b>. In <b>netctl</b>, variables are written to
       <b>wpa_supplicant</b> configuration files <b>quoted</b> by default. When special quoting rules apply, it is possible to
       specify an unquoted (hexadecimal) value using a special syntax.

       The special quoting rules of <b>netctl</b> are as follows. A string that starts with a literal double quote is
       considered <b>non-quoted</b>. Any other string is considered <b>quoted</b>. It is possible to specify quoted strings
       that start with a double quote by quoting manually. An extreme example is the specification of a <b>quoted</b>
       double quote: <u>X='""""'</u>. On the other end of the spectrum there is the <b>non-quoted</b> backslash: <u>X=\"\\</u>.

       Further examples of <b>quoted</b> strings (all equivalent):

           X=string
           X="string"
           X='""string"'

       Further examples of <b>non-quoted</b> strings (all equivalent):

           X=\"string
           X="\"string"
           X='"string'

       A mnemonic is to think of the prefix ‘\"’ as saying ‘non’-‘quote’.
