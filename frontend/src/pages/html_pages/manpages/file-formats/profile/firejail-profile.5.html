</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       profile - Security profile file syntax, and information about building new application profiles.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       Using a specific profile:

              <b>firejail</b> <b>--profile=filename.profile</b>

                     Example:
                     $ firejail --appimage --profile=/etc/firejail/kdenlive.profile kdenlive.appimage

              <b>firejail</b> <b>--profile=profile_name</b>

                     Example:
                     $ firejail --appimage --profile=kdenlive kdenlive.appimage

       Building a profile manually:

              Start  with  the  template  in  /usr/share/doc/firejail/profile.template  and  modify it in a text
              editor.  To  integrate  the  program  in  your  desktop  environment  copy  the  profile  file  in
              <a href="file:~/.config/firejail">~/.config/firejail</a> directory and run "sudo firecfg".

       Aliases and redirections:

              In  some  cases  the  same  profile  can  be  used  for several applications.  One such example is
              LibreOffice.   Build  a  regular  profile  for  the  main  application,  and  for  the  rest   use
              /usr/share/doc/firejail/redirect_alias-profile.template.

       Running the profile builder:

              <b>firejail</b> <b>--build=appname.profile</b> <b>appname</b>

                     Example:
                     $ firejail --build=blobby.profile blobby

                     Run  the  program  in  "firejail  --build"  and try to exercise as many program features as
                     possible.  The profile is extracted and saved in the current directory. Open it in  a  text
                     editor  and  add  or remove sandboxing options as necessary. Test again after modifying the
                     profile. To integrate the program in your desktop environment  copy  the  profile  file  in
                     <a href="file:~/.config/firejail">~/.config/firejail</a> directory and run "sudo firecfg".

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Several  command  line  options  can  be  passed to the program using profile files. Firejail chooses the
       profile file as follows:

       <b>1.</b> If a profile file is provided by the user with --profile option, the profile  file  is  loaded.  If  a
       profile name is given, it is searched for first in the <a href="file:~/.config/firejail">~/.config/firejail</a> directory and if not found then
       in /etc/firejail directory. Profile names do not include the .profile suffix.  Example:

              $ firejail --profile=/home/netblue/icecat.profile icecat
              Reading profile /home/netblue/icecat.profile
              [...]

              $ firejail --profile=icecat icecat-wrapper.sh
              Reading profile /etc/firejail/icecat.profile
              [...]

       <b>2.</b>  If a profile file with the same name as the application is present in <a href="file:~/.config/firejail">~/.config/firejail</a> directory or
       in /etc/firejail, the profile is loaded. <a href="file:~/.config/firejail">~/.config/firejail</a> takes precedence over /etc/firejail. Example:

              $ firejail icecat
              Command name #icecat#
              Found icecat profile in /home/netblue/.config/firejail directory
              Reading profile /home/netblue/.config/firejail/icecat.profile
              [...]

       <b>3.</b> Use a default.profile file if the sandbox is started by a regular user, or a  server.profile  file  if
       the  sandbox is started by root. Firejail looks for these files in <a href="file:~/.config/firejail">~/.config/firejail</a> directory, followed
       by /etc/firejail directory.  To disable default profile loading, use --noprofile command option. Example:

              $ firejail
              Reading profile /etc/firejail/default.profile
              Parent pid 8553, child pid 8554
              Child process initialized
              [...]

              $ firejail --noprofile
              Parent pid 8553, child pid 8554
              Child process initialized
              [...]

</pre><h4><b>Templates</b></h4><pre>
       In /usr/share/doc/firejail there are two templates to write new profiles.
              profile.template - for regular profiles
              redirect_alias-profile.template - for aliasing/redirecting profiles

</pre><h4><b>Scripting</b></h4><pre>
       Scripting commands:

       <b>File</b> <b>and</b> <b>directory</b> <b>names</b>
              File and directory names containing spaces are supported. The space character ' '  should  not  be
              escaped.

              Example: "blacklist <a href="file:~/My">~/My</a> Virtual Machines"

       <b>#</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>comment</b>
              Example:

              # disable networking
              net none # this command creates an empty network namespace

       <b>?CONDITIONAL:</b> <b>profile</b> <b>line</b>
              Conditionally add profile line.

              Example: "?HAS_APPIMAGE: whitelist ${HOME}/special/appimage/dir"

              This example will load the whitelist profile line only if the --appimage option has been specified
              on the command line.

              Currently  the  only  conditionals  supported  this  way  are  HAS_APPIMAGE,  HAS_NET, HAS_NODBUS,
              HAS_NOSOUND,  HAS_PRIVATE  and  HAS_X11.  The  conditionals  ALLOW_TRAY,  BROWSER_DISABLE_U2F  and
              BROWSER_ALLOW_DRM can be enabled or disabled globally in Firejail's configuration file.

              The  profile  line  may  be  any  profile line that you would normally use in a profile <b>except</b> for
              "quiet" and "include" lines.

              Note: When using one or more conditionals and <b>--profile</b>,  it  is  recommended  that  the  relevant
              option(s)   (such  as  <b>--appimage</b>)  be  specified  before  <b>--profile</b>,  so  that  their  respective
              conditional(s) (such as <b>?HAS_APPIMAGE</b>) inside of the profile evaluate to true.

       <b>include</b> <b>other.profile</b>
              Include other.profile file.

              Example: "include /etc/firejail/disable-common.inc"

              The file name can be prefixed with a macro such as ${HOME} or ${CFG}.  ${HOME} is expanded as user
              home directory, and ${CFG} is expanded as Firejail system configuration directory - in most  cases
              /etc/firejail or /usr/local/etc/firejail.

              Example: "include ${HOME}/myprofiles/profile1" will load "<a href="file:~/myprofiles/profile1">~/myprofiles/profile1</a>" file.

              Example: "include ${CFG}/firefox.profile" will load "/etc/firejail/firefox.profile" file.

              The  file  name may also be just the name without the leading directory components.  In this case,
              first the user config directory (${HOME}/.config/firejail) is searched for the file  name  and  if
              not  found  then the system configuration directory is search for the file name.  Note: Unlike the
              --profile option which takes a profile name without the '.profile' suffix, include must  be  given
              the full file name.

              Example:  "include  firefox.profile" will load "${HOME}/.config/firejail/firefox.profile" file and
              if it does not exist "${CFG}/firefox.profile" will be loaded.

              System configuration files in ${CFG} are overwritten  during  software  installation.   Persistent
              configuration  at  system  level  is  handled  in ".local" files. For every profile file in ${CFG}
              directory, the user can create a corresponding .local file storing modifications to the persistent
              configuration. Persistent .local files are included at the start of regular profile files.

       <b>noblacklist</b> <b>file_name</b>
              If the file name matches file_name, the file will not be blacklisted  in  any  blacklist  commands
              that follow.

              Example: "noblacklist ${HOME}/.mozilla"

       <b>nowhitelist</b> <b>file_name</b>
              If  the  file  name  matches file_name, the file will not be whitelisted in any whitelist commands
              that follow.

              Example: "nowhitelist <a href="file:~/.config">~/.config</a>"

       <b>ignore</b> Ignore command.

              Example: "ignore seccomp"
              Example: "ignore net eth0"

       <b>quiet</b>  Disable Firejail's output. This should be the first uncommented command in the profile file.

              Example: "quiet"

</pre><h4><b>Filesystem</b></h4><pre>
       These profile entries define a chroot filesystem built on top of the existing host filesystem. Each  line
       describes a file/directory that is inaccessible (<b>blacklist</b>), a read-only file or directory (<b>read-only</b>), a
       tmpfs  mounted  on  top  of  an  existing  directory (<b>tmpfs</b>), or mount-bind a directory or file on top of
       another directory or file (<b>bind</b>).  Use <b>private</b> to set private mode.  File globbing is supported, and PATH
       and HOME directories are searched, see the <b>firejail</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>GLOBBING</b> section for more details.  Examples:

       <b>blacklist</b> <b>file_or_directory</b>
              Blacklist directory or file. Examples:

              blacklist <a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>
              blacklist /usr/bin/gcc*
              blacklist ${PATH}/ifconfig
              blacklist ${HOME}/.ssh

       <b>blacklist-nolog</b> <b>file_or_directory</b>
              When --tracelog flag is set, blacklisting generates syslog messages if the sandbox tries to access
              the file or directory.  blacklist-nolog command disables syslog messages for this particular  file
              or directory. Examples:

              blacklist-nolog <a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>
              blacklist-nolog /usr/bin/gcc*

       <b>bind</b> <b>directory1,directory2</b>
              Mount-bind directory1 on top of directory2. This option is only available when running as root.

       <b>bind</b> <b>file1,file2</b>
              Mount-bind file1 on top of file2. This option is only available when running as root.

       <b>disable-mnt</b>
              Disable <a href="file:/mnt">/mnt</a>, <a href="file:/media">/media</a>, <a href="file:/run/mount">/run/mount</a> and /run/media access.

       <b>keep-config-pulse</b>
              Disable  automatic  <a href="file:~/.config/pulse">~/.config/pulse</a>  init, for complex setups such as remote pulse servers or non-
              standard socket paths.

       <b>keep-dev-shm</b>
              <a href="file:/dev/shm">/dev/shm</a> directory is untouched (even with private-dev).

       <b>keep-var-tmp</b>
              <a href="file:/var/tmp">/var/tmp</a> directory is untouched.

       <b>mkdir</b> <b>directory</b>
              Create a directory in user home, under <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>,  or  under  <a href="file:/run/user/">/run/user/</a>&lt;UID&gt;  before  the  sandbox  is
              started.  The directory is created if it doesn't already exist.

              Use  this  command  for  whitelisted  directories you need to preserve when the sandbox is closed.
              Without it, the application will create the directory, and the directory will be deleted when  the
              sandbox is closed. Subdirectories are recursively created. Example from firefox profile:

              mkdir <a href="file:~/.mozilla">~/.mozilla</a>
              whitelist <a href="file:~/.mozilla">~/.mozilla</a>
              mkdir <a href="file:~/.cache/mozilla/firefox">~/.cache/mozilla/firefox</a>
              whitelist <a href="file:~/.cache/mozilla/firefox">~/.cache/mozilla/firefox</a>

              For files in <a href="file:/run/user/">/run/user/</a>&lt;PID&gt; use ${RUNUSER} macro:

              mkdir ${RUNUSER}/firejail-testing

       <b>mkfile</b> <b>file</b>
              Similar  to  mkdir,  this  command  creates  an  empty  file  in  user  home,  or  <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>,  or under
              <a href="file:/run/user/">/run/user/</a>&lt;UID&gt; before the sandbox is started. The file is created if it doesn't already exist.

       <b>noexec</b> <b>file_or_directory</b>
              Remount the file or the directory noexec, nodev and nosuid.

       <b>private</b>
              Mount new <a href="file:/root">/root</a> and  /home/user  directories  in  temporary  filesystems.  All  modifications  are
              discarded when the sandbox is closed.

       <b>private</b> <b>directory</b>
              Use directory as user home.  --private and --private=directory cannot be used together.

              Bug:  Even  with  this enabled, some commands (such as mkdir, mkfile and private-cache) will still
              operate on the original home directory.  Workaround: Disable the incompatible commands, such as by
              using "ignore mkdir" and "ignore mkfile".  For details, see #903

       <b>private-bin</b> <b>file,file</b>
              Build a new <a href="file:/bin">/bin</a> in a temporary filesystem, and copy the programs in the list.  The files  in  the
              list  must  be  expressed  as  relative to the <a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>, <a href="file:/sbin">/sbin</a>, <a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>, <a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a>, or <a href="file:/usr/local/bin">/usr/local/bin</a>
              directories.  The same  directory  is  also  bind-mounted  over  <a href="file:/sbin">/sbin</a>,  <a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>  and  /usr/sbin.
              Multiple private-bin commands are allowed and they accumulate.

       <b>private-cache</b>
              Mount an empty temporary filesystem on top of the .cache directory in user home. All modifications
              are discarded when the sandbox is closed.

       <b>private-cwd</b>
              Set working directory inside jail to the home directory, and failing that, the root directory.

       <b>private-cwd</b> <b>directory</b>
              Set  working  directory  inside  the jail. Full directory path is required. Symbolic links are not
              allowed.

       <b>private-dev</b>
              Create a new <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a> directory. Only disc, dri, dvb,  hidraw,  null,  full,  zero,  tty,  pts,  ptmx,
              random, snd, urandom, video, log, shm and usb devices are available.  Use the options no3d, nodvd,
              nosound, notv, nou2f and novideo for additional restrictions.

       <b>private-etc</b> <b>file,directory</b>
              Build  a  new <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a> in a temporary filesystem, and copy the files and directories in the list.  The
              files and directories in the list must be expressed as relative to the <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>  directory,  and  must
              not  contain  the  /  character  (e.g.,  /etc/foo  must  be  expressed as foo, but /etc/foo/bar --
              expressed as foo/bar -- is disallowed).  All modifications  are  discarded  when  the  sandbox  is
              closed.  Multiple private-etc commands are allowed and they accumulate.

       <b>private-home</b> <b>file,directory</b>
              Build a new user home in a temporary filesystem, and copy the files and directories in the list in
              the  new home.  The files and directories in the list must be expressed as relative to the current
              user's home directory.  All modifications are discarded when the sandbox is closed.

       <b>private-lib</b> <b>file,directory</b>
              Build a new <a href="file:/lib">/lib</a> directory and bring in the libraries required by the  application  to  run.   The
              files  and  directories  in  the  list  must be expressed as relative to the <a href="file:/lib">/lib</a> directory.  This
              feature is still under development, see <b>man</b> <b>1</b> <b>firejail</b> for some examples.

       <b>private-opt</b> <b>file,directory</b>
              Build a new <a href="file:/opt">/opt</a> in a temporary filesystem, and copy the files and directories in the  list.   The
              files  and  directories  in the list must be expressed as relative to the <a href="file:/opt">/opt</a> directory, and must
              not contain the / character (e.g.,  /opt/foo  must  be  expressed  as  foo,  but  /opt/foo/bar  --
              expressed  as  foo/bar  --  is  disallowed).   All modifications are discarded when the sandbox is
              closed.

       <b>private-srv</b> <b>file,directory</b>
              Build a new <a href="file:/srv">/srv</a> in a temporary filesystem, and copy the files and directories in the  list.   The
              files  and  directories  in the list must be expressed as relative to the <a href="file:/srv">/srv</a> directory, and must
              not contain the / character (e.g.,  /srv/foo  must  be  expressed  as  foo,  but  /srv/foo/bar  --
              expressed  as  foo/bar  --  is  disallowed).   All modifications are discarded when the sandbox is
              closed.

       <b>private-tmp</b>
              Mount an empty temporary filesystem on top of <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a> directory whitelisting /tmp/.X11-unix.

       <b>read-only</b> <b>file_or_directory</b>
              Make directory or file read-only.

       <b>read-write</b> <b>file_or_directory</b>
              Make directory or file read-write.

       <b>tmpfs</b> <b>directory</b>
              Mount an empty tmpfs filesystem on top of directory. Directories outside user home or not owned by
              the user are not allowed. Sandboxes running as root are exempt from these restrictions.

       <b>tracelog</b>
              Blacklist violations logged to syslog.

       <b>whitelist</b> <b>file_or_directory</b>
              Whitelist directory or file. A temporary file system is mounted on  the  top  directory,  and  the
              whitelisted  files  are  mount-binded  inside.  Modifications to whitelisted files are persistent,
              everything else is discarded when the sandbox is closed. The top directory can be all  directories
              in / (except <a href="file:/proc">/proc</a> and <a href="file:/sys">/sys</a>), <a href="file:/sys/module">/sys/module</a>, <a href="file:/run/user/">/run/user/</a>$UID, $HOME and all directories in /usr.

              Symbolic link handling: with the exception of user home, both the link and the real file should be
              in  the  same top directory. For user home, both the link and the real file should be owned by the
              user.

       <b>whitelist-ro</b> <b>file_or_directory</b>
              Equivalent to "whitelist file_or_directory" followed by "read-only file_or_directory"

       <b>writable-etc</b>
              Mount <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a> directory read-write.

       <b>writable-run-user</b>
              Disable the default blacklisting of run/user/$UID/systemd and <a href="file:/run/user/">/run/user/</a>$UID/gnupg.

       <b>writable-var</b>
              Mount <a href="file:/var">/var</a> directory read-write.

       <b>writable-var-log</b>
              Use the real <a href="file:/var/log">/var/log</a> directory, not a clone. By default, a tmpfs is mounted on  top  of  <a href="file:/var/log">/var/log</a>
              directory, and a skeleton filesystem is created based on the original /var/log.

</pre><h4><b>Security</b> <b>filters</b></h4><pre>
       The following security filters are currently implemented:

       <b>allow-debuggers</b>
              Allow  tools  such  as  strace  and gdb inside the sandbox by whitelisting system calls ptrace and

</pre><h4><b>DBus</b> <b>filtering</b></h4><pre>
       Access  to  the session and system DBus UNIX sockets can be allowed, filtered or disabled. To disable the
       abstract sockets (and force applications to use the filtered UNIX socket) you would need to request a new
       network namespace using --net command. Another option is to remove unix from the --protocol set.

       Filtering requires installing the xdg-dbus-proxy utility. Filter rules can be  specified  for  well-known
       DBus names, but they are also propagated to the owning unique name, too. The permissions are "sticky" and
       are  kept  even  if  the  corresponding well-known name is released (however, applications rarely release
       well-known names in practice). Names may have a .* suffix to match all names underneath  them,  including
       themselves  (e.g. "foo.bar.*" matches "foo.bar", "foo.bar.baz" and "foo.bar.baz.quux", but not "foobar").
       For more information, see <a href="../man1/xdg-dbus-proxy.1.html">xdg-dbus-proxy</a>(1).

</pre><h4><b>Networking</b></h4><pre>
       Networking features available in profile files.

       <b>defaultgw</b> <b>address</b>
              Use this address as default gateway in the new network namespace.

       <b>dns</b> <b>address</b>
              Set a DNS server for the sandbox. Up to three DNS servers can be defined.

       <b>hostname</b> <b>name</b>
              Set a hostname for the sandbox.

       <b>hosts-file</b> <b>file</b>
              Use file as /etc/hosts.

       <b>ip</b> <b>address</b>
              Assign IP addresses to the last network interface defined by a net command. A default  gateway  is
              assigned by default.

              Example:
              net eth0
              ip 10.10.20.56

       <b>ip</b> <b>none</b>
              No  IP  address  and  no  default  gateway  are configured for the last interface defined by a net
              command. Use this option in case you intend to start an external DHCP client in the sandbox.

              Example:
              net eth0
              ip none

       <b>ip</b> <b>dhcp</b>
              Acquire an IP address and default gateway for the last interface defined by a net command, as well
              as set the DNS servers according to the DHCP response.  This command  requires  the  ISC  dhclient
              DHCP client to be installed and will start it automatically inside the sandbox.

              Example:
              net br0
              ip dhcp

              This  command  should not be used in conjunction with the dns command if the DHCP server is set to
              configure DNS servers for the  clients,  because  the  manually  specified  DNS  servers  will  be
              overwritten.

              The  DHCP client will NOT release the DHCP lease when the sandbox terminates.  If your DHCP server
              requires leases to be explicitly released, consider running a DHCP client and releasing the  lease
              manually in conjunction with the net none command.

       <b>ip6</b> <b>address</b>
              Assign IPv6 addresses to the last network interface defined by a net command.

              Example:
              net eth0
              ip6 2001:0db8:0:f101::1/64

       <b>ip6</b> <b>dhcp</b>
              Acquire  an  IPv6  address and default gateway for the last interface defined by a net command, as
              well as set the DNS servers according to  the  DHCP  response.   This  command  requires  the  ISC
              dhclient DHCP client to be installed and will start it automatically inside the sandbox.

              Example:
              net br0
              ip6 dhcp

              This  command  should not be used in conjunction with the dns command if the DHCP server is set to
              configure DNS servers for the  clients,  because  the  manually  specified  DNS  servers  will  be
              overwritten.

              The  DHCP client will NOT release the DHCP lease when the sandbox terminates.  If your DHCP server
              requires leases to be explicitly released, consider running a DHCP client and releasing the  lease
              manually.

       <b>iprange</b> <b>address,address</b>
              Assign an IP address in the provided range to the last network interface defined by a net command.
              A default gateway is assigned by default.

              Example:

              net eth0
              iprange 192.168.1.150,192.168.1.160

       <b>mac</b> <b>address</b>
              Assign MAC addresses to the last network interface defined by a net command.

       <b>mtu</b> <b>number</b>
              Assign a MTU value to the last network interface defined by a net command.

       <b>net</b> <b>bridge_interface</b>
              Enable  a  new  network  namespace and connect it to this bridge interface.  Unless specified with
              option --ip and --defaultgw, an IP address and a default gateway will be assigned automatically to
              the sandbox. The IP address is verified using ARP before assignment.  The  address  configured  as
              default  gateway  is the bridge device IP address. Up to four --net bridge devices can be defined.
              Mixing bridge and macvlan devices is allowed.

       <b>net</b> <b>ethernet_interface|wireless_interface</b>
              Enable a new network namespace and connect it to this ethernet interface using the standard  Linux
              macvlan  or  ipvlan driver. Unless specified with option --ip and --defaultgw, an IP address and a
              default gateway will be assigned automatically to the sandbox. The IP address  is  verified  using
              ARP  before  assignment.  The  address configured as default gateway is the default gateway of the
              host. Up to four --net devices can be defined. Mixing bridge and macvlan devices is allowed.

       <b>net</b> <b>none</b>
              Enable a new, unconnected network namespace. The only interface available in the new namespace  is
              a  new  loopback  interface  (lo).   Use this option to deny network access to programs that don't
              really need network access.

       <b>net</b> <b>tap_interface</b>
              Enable a new network namespace and connect it to this ethernet tap interface  using  the  standard
              Linux  macvlan  driver.   If  the  tap  interface  is  not configured, the sandbox will not try to
              configure the interface inside the sandbox.  Please use ip, netmask and defaultgw to  specify  the
              configuration.

       <b>netfilter</b>
              If a new network namespace is created, enabled default network filter.

       <b>netfilter</b> <b>filename</b>
              If a new network namespace is created, enabled the network filter in filename.

       <b>netlock</b>
              Generate a custom network filter and enable it.

       <b>netmask</b> <b>address</b>
              Use  this option when you want to assign an IP address in a new namespace and the parent interface
              specified by --net is not configured. An IP address and a default gateway address also have to  be
              added.

       <b>netns</b> <b>namespace</b>
              Run  the  program  in  a  named, persistent network namespace. These can be created and configured
              using "ip netns".

</pre><h4><b>Other</b></h4><pre>
       <b>deterministic-exit-code</b>
              Always  exit  firejail with the first child's exit status. The default behavior is to use the exit
              status of the final child to exit, which can be nondeterministic.

       <b>deterministic-shutdown</b>
              Always shut down the sandbox after the first child has terminated. The default behavior is to keep
              the sandbox alive as long as it contains running processes.

       <b>join-or-start</b> <b>sandboxname</b>
              Join the sandbox identified by name or start a new one.   Same  as  "firejail  --join=sandboxname"
              command if sandbox with specified name exists, otherwise same as "name sandboxname".
