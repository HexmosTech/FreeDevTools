       postconf - Postfix configuration parameters

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>postconf</b> <u>parameter</u> ...

       <b>postconf</b> <b>-e</b> "<u>parameter=value</u>" ...

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  Postfix  main.cf  configuration  file specifies parameters that control the operation of the Postfix
       mail system. Typically the file contains only a small subset of all parameters; parameters not  specified
       are left at their default values.

       The general format of the main.cf file is as follows:

       •      Each  logical  line has the form "parameter = value".  Whitespace around the "=" is ignored, as is
              whitespace at the end of a logical line.

       •      Empty lines and whitespace-only lines  are  ignored,  as  are  lines  whose  first  non-whitespace
              character is a `#'.

       •      A  logical  line  starts  with non-whitespace text. A line that starts with whitespace continues a
              logical line.

       •      A parameter value may refer to other parameters.

              •      The expressions "$name" and "${name}" are recursively replaced with the value of the  named
                     parameter.  The  parameter  name must contain only characters from the set [a-zA-Z0-9_]. An
                     undefined parameter value is replaced with the empty value.

              •      The expressions "${name?value}"  and  "${name?{value}}"  are  replaced  with  "value"  when
                     "$name"  is  non-empty. The parameter name must contain only characters from the set [a-zA-
                     Z0-9_]. These forms are supported with Postfix versions &gt;= 2.2 and &gt;= 3.0, respectively.

              •      The expressions "${name:value}"  and  "${name:{value}}"  are  replaced  with  "value"  when
                     "$name"  is  empty.  The  parameter  name  must contain only characters from the set [a-zA-
                     Z0-9_]. These forms are supported with Postfix versions &gt;= 2.2 and &gt;= 3.0, respectively.

              •      The expression "${name?{value1}:{value2}}" is replaced with "value1" when "$name"  is  non-
                     empty,  and  with  "value2"  when  "$name"  is  empty.   The "{}" is required for "value1",
                     optional for "value2". The parameter name must contain only characters from the set  [a-zA-
                     Z0-9_].  This form is supported with Postfix versions &gt;= 3.0.

              •      The  first  item  inside  "${...}" may be a relational expression of the form: "{value3} ==
                     {value4}". Besides the "==" (equality) operator Postfix supports  "!="  (inequality),  "&lt;",
                     "&lt;=",  "&gt;=",  and  "&gt;".  The  comparison  is  numerical  when both operands are all digits,
                     otherwise the comparison  is  lexicographical.  These  forms  are  supported  with  Postfix
                     versions &gt;= 3.0.

              •      Each  "value" is subject to recursive named parameter and relational expression evaluation,
                     except where noted.

              •      Whitespace before or after each "{value}" is ignored.

              •      Specify "$$" to produce a single "$" character.

              •      The legacy form "$(...)" is equivalent to the preferred form "${...}".

       •      When the same parameter is defined multiple times, only the last instance is remembered.

       •      Otherwise, the order of main.cf parameter definitions does not matter.

       The remainder of this document is a description of all Postfix configuration parameters.  Default  values
       are shown after the parameter name in parentheses, and can be looked up with the "<b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b>" command.

       Note:  this is not an invitation to make changes to Postfix configuration parameters. Unnecessary changes
       can impair the operation of the mail system.

</pre><h4><b>2bounce_notice_recipient</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>postmaster)</b></h4><pre>
       The recipient of undeliverable mail that cannot be returned to the sender.  This feature is enabled  with
       the notify_classes parameter.

</pre><h4><b>access_map_defer_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>450)</b></h4><pre>
       The  numerical  Postfix  SMTP  server  response  code  for  an  <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5)  map  "defer" action, including
       "defer_if_permit" or "defer_if_reject". Prior to Postfix 2.6, the response is hard-coded as "450".

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 5321.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>access_map_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>554)</b></h4><pre>
       The numerical Postfix SMTP server response code for an <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5) map "reject" action.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 5321.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_cache_cleanup_interval</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>12h)</b></h4><pre>
       The amount of time between <b><a href="../man8/verify.8.html">verify</a></b>(8) address verification database cleanup runs.  This  feature  requires
       that  the  database  supports  the "delete" and "sequence" operators.  Specify a zero interval to disable
       database cleanup.

       After each database cleanup run, the <b><a href="../man8/verify.8.html">verify</a></b>(8) daemon logs the number of entries that were  retained  and
       dropped.  A  cleanup  run is logged as "partial" when the daemon terminates early after "<b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>",
       "<b>postfix</b> <b>stop</b>", or no requests for $max_idle seconds.

       Specify a non-negative time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter  suffix  that  specifies
       the  time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time
       unit is h (hours).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.7.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_default_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_transport)</b></h4><pre>
       Overrides the default_transport parameter setting for address verification probes.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_local_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$local_transport)</b></h4><pre>
       Overrides the local_transport parameter setting for address verification probes.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_map</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       Lookup table for persistent address  verification  status  storage.   The  table  is  maintained  by  the
       <b><a href="../man8/verify.8.html">verify</a></b>(8) service, and is opened before the process releases privileges.

       The  lookup  table is persistent by default (Postfix 2.7 and later).  Specify an empty table name to keep
       the information in volatile memory which is lost after "<b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>" or "<b>postfix</b> <b>stop</b>".  This  is  the
       default with Postfix version 2.6 and earlier.

       Specify  a  location in a file system that will not fill up. If the database becomes corrupted, the world
       comes to an end. To recover, delete (NOT: truncate) the file and do "<b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>".

       Postfix daemon processes do not use root privileges when opening this file (Postfix 2.5 and later).   The
       file must therefore be stored under a Postfix-owned directory such as the data_directory.  As a migration
       aid,  an  attempt  to  open  the  file  under  a non-Postfix directory is redirected to the Postfix-owned
       data_directory, and a warning is logged.

       Examples:

       address_verify_map = hash:/var/lib/postfix/verify
       address_verify_map = btree:/var/lib/postfix/verify

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_negative_cache</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable caching of failed address verification probe results.  When this feature is enabled, the cache may
       pollute quickly with garbage.  When this feature is disabled, Postfix will generate an address probe  for
       every lookup.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_negative_expire_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3d)</b></h4><pre>
       The time after which a failed probe expires from the address verification cache.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is d (days).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_negative_refresh_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3h)</b></h4><pre>
       The time after which a failed address verification probe needs to be refreshed.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is h (hours).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_pending_request_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       A  safety  limit  that  prevents  address  verification  requests from overwhelming the Postfix queue. By
       default,  the  number  of  pending  requests  is  limited  to  1/4  of  the  active  queue  maximum  size
       (qmgr_message_active_limit). The queue manager enforces the limit by tempfailing requests that exceed the
       limit.  This  affects  only  unknown  addresses  and  inactive  addresses  that have expired, because the
       <b><a href="../man8/verify.8.html">verify</a></b>(8) daemon automatically refreshes an active address before it expires.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_poll_count</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>normal:</b> <b>3,</b> <b>overload:</b> <b>1)</b></h4><pre>
       How many times to query the <b><a href="../man8/verify.8.html">verify</a></b>(8) service for the completion of an address  verification  request  in
       progress.

       By  default,  the  Postfix  SMTP  server polls the <b><a href="../man8/verify.8.html">verify</a></b>(8) service up to three times under non-overload
       conditions, and only once when under overload.  With Postfix version 2.5 and  earlier,  the  SMTP  server
       always polls the <b><a href="../man8/verify.8.html">verify</a></b>(8) service up to three times by default.

       Specify  1 to implement a crude form of greylisting, that is, always defer the first delivery request for
       a new address.

       Examples:

       # Postfix &lt;= 2.6 default
       address_verify_poll_count = 3
       # Poor man's greylisting
       address_verify_poll_count = 1

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_poll_delay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3s)</b></h4><pre>
       The delay between queries for the completion of an address verification request in progress.

       The default polling delay is 3 seconds.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_positive_expire_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>31d)</b></h4><pre>
       The time after which a successful probe expires from the address verification cache.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is d (days).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_positive_refresh_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>7d)</b></h4><pre>
       The time after which a successful  address  verification  probe  needs  to  be  refreshed.   The  address
       verification status is not updated when the probe fails (optimistic caching).

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is d (days).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_relay_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$relay_transport)</b></h4><pre>
       Overrides the relay_transport parameter setting for address verification probes.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_relayhost</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$relayhost)</b></h4><pre>
       Overrides the relayhost parameter setting for  address  verification  probes.  This  information  can  be
       overruled with the <b><a href="../man5/transport.5.html">transport</a></b>(5) table.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_sender</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$double_bounce_sender)</b></h4><pre>
       The  sender  address  to  use  in  address  verification  probes;  prior  to  Postfix 2.5 the default was
       "postmaster". To avoid problems with address probes that are sent in  response  to  address  probes,  the
       Postfix SMTP server excludes the probe sender address from all SMTPD access blocks.

       Specify  an  empty  value  (address_verify_sender  =)  or  &lt;&gt; if you want to use the null sender address.
       Beware, some sites reject mail from &lt;&gt;, even though RFCs require that such addresses be accepted.

       Examples:

       address_verify_sender = &lt;&gt;
       address_verify_sender = postmaster@mydomain

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_sender_dependent_default_transport_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$sender_dependent_default_transport_maps)</b></h4><pre>
       Overrides the sender_dependent_default_transport_maps parameter setting for address verification probes.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.7 and later.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_sender_dependent_relayhost_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$sender_dependent_relayhost_maps)</b></h4><pre>
       Overrides the sender_dependent_relayhost_maps parameter setting for address verification probes.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_sender_ttl</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0s)</b></h4><pre>
       The time between changes in the time-dependent portion of address verification  probe  sender  addresses.
       The   time-dependent   portion   is  appended  to  the  localpart  of  the  address  specified  with  the
       address_verify_sender parameter. This feature is ignored when the probe  sender  addresses  is  the  null
       sender, i.e. the address_verify_sender value is empty or &lt;&gt;.

       Historically,  the  probe  sender  address was fixed. This has caused such addresses to end up on spammer
       mailing lists, and has resulted in wasted network and processing resources.

       To enable time-dependent probe sender addresses, specify a non-zero time value. Specify  a  value  of  at
       least  several hours, to avoid problems with senders that use greylisting. Avoid nice TTL values, to make
       the result less predictable.

       Specify a non-negative time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter  suffix  that  specifies
       the  time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time
       unit is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.9 and later.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>verify)</b></h4><pre>
       The name of the <b><a href="../man8/verify.8.html">verify</a></b>(8) address verification service. This  service  maintains  the  status  of  sender
       and/or recipient address verification probes, and generates probes on request by other Postfix processes.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_transport_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$transport_maps)</b></h4><pre>
       Overrides the transport_maps parameter setting for address verification probes.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>address_verify_virtual_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$virtual_transport)</b></h4><pre>
       Overrides the virtual_transport parameter setting for address verification probes.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>alias_database</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The alias databases for <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) delivery that are updated with "<b>newaliases</b>" or with "<b>sendmail</b> <b>-bi</b>".

       This  is a separate configuration parameter because not all the tables specified with $alias_maps have to
       be local files.

       Examples:

       alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases
       alias_database = hash:/etc/mail/aliases

</pre><h4><b>alias_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional lookup tables that are searched only with an email address localpart (no domain) and that  apply
       only  to <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) recipients; this is unlike virtual_alias_maps that are often searched with a full email
       address (including domain) and that  apply  to  all  recipients:  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8),  virtual,  and  remote.   The
       alias_maps  table  format  and  lookups are documented in <b><a href="../man5/aliases.5.html">aliases</a></b>(5).  For an overview of Postfix address
       manipulations see the ADDRESS_REWRITING_README document.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.  Note: these lookups are recursive.

       The default list is system dependent.  On systems with NIS, the default is  to  search  the  local  alias
       database, then the NIS alias database.

       If  you  change the alias database, run "<b>postalias</b> <b>/etc/aliases</b>" (or wherever your system stores the mail
       alias file), or simply run "<b>newaliases</b>" to build the necessary DBM or DB file.

       The <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) delivery agent disallows regular expression substitution of $1 etc. in  alias_maps,  because
       that would open a security hole.

       The  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)  delivery  agent  will  silently  ignore  requests  to  use  the  <b><a href="../man8/proxymap.8.html">proxymap</a></b>(8) server within
       alias_maps. Instead it will open the table directly. Before Postfix version 2.2,  the  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)  delivery
       agent will terminate with a fatal error.

       Examples:

       alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases, nis:mail.aliases
       alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases

</pre><h4><b>allow_mail_to_commands</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>alias,</b> <b>forward)</b></h4><pre>
       Restrict  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) mail delivery to external commands.  The default is to disallow delivery to "|command"
       in :include:  files (see <b><a href="../man5/aliases.5.html">aliases</a></b>(5) for the text that defines this terminology).

       Specify zero or more of: <b>alias</b>, <b>forward</b> or <b>include</b>, in order to allow commands  in  <b><a href="../man5/aliases.5.html">aliases</a></b>(5),  .forward
       files or in :include:  files, respectively.

       Example:

       allow_mail_to_commands = alias,forward,include

</pre><h4><b>allow_mail_to_files</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>alias,</b> <b>forward)</b></h4><pre>
       Restrict  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)  mail delivery to external files. The default is to disallow "/file/name" destinations
       in :include:  files (see <b><a href="../man5/aliases.5.html">aliases</a></b>(5) for the text that defines this terminology).

       Specify zero or more of: <b>alias</b>, <b>forward</b> or <b>include</b>,  in  order  to  allow  "/file/name"  destinations  in
       <b><a href="../man5/aliases.5.html">aliases</a></b>(5), .forward files and in :include:  files, respectively.

       Example:

       allow_mail_to_files = alias,forward,include

</pre><h4><b>allow_min_user</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Allow a sender or recipient address to have `-' as the first character.  By default, this is not allowed,
       to  avoid  accidents  with software that passes email addresses via the command line. Such software would
       not be able to distinguish a malicious address from a bona fide command-line option. Although this can be
       prevented by inserting a "--" option terminator into the command  line,  this  is  difficult  to  enforce
       consistently and globally.

       As of Postfix version 2.5, this feature is implemented by trivial-<b><a href="../man8/rewrite.8.html">rewrite</a></b>(8).  With earlier versions this
       feature was implemented by <b><a href="../man8/qmgr.8.html">qmgr</a></b>(8) and was limited to recipient addresses only.

</pre><h4><b>allow_percent_hack</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable the rewriting of the form "user%domain" to "user@domain".  This is enabled by default.

       Note:  as of Postfix version 2.2, message header address rewriting happens only when one of the following
       conditions is true:

       •      The message is received with the Postfix <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1) command,

       •      The message is received from a network client that matches $local_header_rewrite_clients,

       •      The message is received from the network, and the remote_header_rewrite_domain parameter specifies
              a non-empty value.

       To get the behavior before Postfix version 2.2, specify "local_header_rewrite_clients = static:all".

       Example:

       allow_percent_hack = no

</pre><h4><b>allow_srv_lookup_fallback</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       When SRV record lookup fails or no SRV record exists, fall back to MX or IP  address  lookup  as  if  SRV
       record lookup was not enabled.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.8 and later.

</pre><h4><b>allow_untrusted_routing</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Forward   mail  with  sender-specified  routing  (user[@%!]remote[@%!]site)  from  untrusted  clients  to
       destinations matching $relay_domains.

       By default, this feature is turned off.  This closes a nasty open relay loophole where a backup  MX  host
       can be tricked into forwarding junk mail to a primary MX host which then spams it out to the world.

       This  parameter  also  controls  if  non-local  addresses with sender-specified routing can match Postfix
       access tables. By default, such addresses cannot match Postfix access  tables,  because  the  address  is
       ambiguous.

</pre><h4><b>alternate_config_directories</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       A  list of non-default Postfix configuration directories that may be specified with "-c config_directory"
       on the command line (in the  case  of  <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1),  with  the  "-C"  option),  or  via  the  MAIL_CONFIG
       environment parameter.

       This  list  must  be  specified  in the default Postfix main.cf file, and will be used by set-gid Postfix
       commands such as <b><a href="../man1/postqueue.1.html">postqueue</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/postdrop.1.html">postdrop</a></b>(1).

       Specify absolute pathnames, separated by comma or space. Note: $name expansion is not supported.

</pre><h4><b>always_add_missing_headers</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Always add (Resent-) From:, To:, Date: or Message-ID: headers when not present.  Postfix  2.6  and  later
       add  these  headers  only when clients match the local_header_rewrite_clients parameter setting.  Earlier
       Postfix versions always add these headers;  this  may  break  DKIM  signatures  that  cover  non-existent
       headers.   The  undisclosed_recipients_header  parameter  setting determines whether a To: header will be
       added.

</pre><h4><b>always_bcc</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional address that receives a "blind carbon copy" of each message that is received by the Postfix mail
       system.

       Note: with Postfix 2.3 and later the BCC address is added as if it was specified  with  NOTIFY=NONE.  The
       sender  will  not  be notified when the BCC address is undeliverable, as long as all down-stream software
       implements RFC 3461.

       Note: with Postfix 2.2 and earlier the sender will be notified when the BCC address is undeliverable.

       Note: automatic BCC recipients are produced only for new mail.  To  avoid  mailer  loops,  automatic  BCC
       recipients  are  not  generated  after  Postfix forwards mail internally, or after Postfix generates mail
       itself.

       Note:  automatic  BCC  recipients  are  subject  to  address  canonicalization  (add   missing   domain),
       canonical_maps, masquerade_domains, and virtual_alias_maps.

</pre><h4><b>anvil_rate_time_unit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>60s)</b></h4><pre>
       The time unit over which client connection rates and other rates are calculated.

       This feature is implemented by the <b><a href="../man8/anvil.8.html">anvil</a></b>(8) service which is available in Postfix version 2.2 and later.

       The  default  interval is relatively short. Because of the high frequency of updates, the <b><a href="../man8/anvil.8.html">anvil</a></b>(8) server
       uses volatile memory only. Thus, information is lost whenever the process terminates.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>anvil_status_update_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>600s)</b></h4><pre>
       How frequently the <b><a href="../man8/anvil.8.html">anvil</a></b>(8) connection and rate limiting server logs peak usage information.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>append_at_myorigin</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       With locally submitted mail, append the string "@$myorigin" to mail addresses without domain information.
       With remotely submitted mail, append the string "@$remote_header_rewrite_domain" instead.

       Note 1: this feature is enabled by default and  must  not  be  turned  off.   Postfix  does  not  support
       domain-less addresses.

       Note 2: with Postfix version 2.2, message header address rewriting happens only when one of the following
       conditions is true:

       •      The message is received with the Postfix <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1) command,

       •      The message is received from a network client that matches $local_header_rewrite_clients,

       •      The message is received from the network, and the remote_header_rewrite_domain parameter specifies
              a non-empty value.

       To get the behavior before Postfix version 2.2, specify "local_header_rewrite_clients = static:all".

</pre><h4><b>append_dot_mydomain</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>Postfix</b> <b>&gt;=</b> <b>3.0:</b> <b>no,</b> <b>Postfix</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>3.0:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       With  locally  submitted  mail,  append  the  string  ".$mydomain"  to  addresses  that have no ".domain"
       information. With remotely submitted mail, append the string ".$remote_header_rewrite_domain" instead.

       Note  1:  When  disabled  (Postfix  3.0  and  later),  users  will  not  be  able   to   send   mail   to
       "user@partialdomainname" but will have to specify full domain names instead.

       Note 2: with Postfix version 2.2, message header address rewriting happens only when one of the following
       conditions is true:

       •      The message is received with the Postfix <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1) command,

       •      The message is received from a network client that matches $local_header_rewrite_clients,

       •      The message is received from the network, and the remote_header_rewrite_domain parameter specifies
              a non-empty value.

       To get the behavior before Postfix version 2.2, specify "local_header_rewrite_clients = static:all".

</pre><h4><b>application_event_drain_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100s)</b></h4><pre>
       How  long  the  <b><a href="../man1/postkick.1.html">postkick</a></b>(1)  command waits for a request to enter the Postfix daemon process input buffer
       before giving up.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>authorized_flush_users</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>static:anyone)</b></h4><pre>
       List of users who are authorized to flush the queue.

       By  default,  all users are allowed to flush the queue.  Access is always granted if the invoking user is
       the super-user or the $mail_owner user.  Otherwise, the real UID of the  process  is  looked  up  in  the
       system  password  file, and access is granted only if the corresponding login name is on the access list.
       The username "unknown" is used for processes whose real UID is not found in the password file.

       Specify a list of  user  names,  "/file/name"  or  "type:table"  patterns,  separated  by  commas  and/or
       whitespace.  The  list  is matched left to right, and the search stops on the first match. A "/file/name"
       pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a name matches a  lookup
       key  (the  lookup  result  is  ignored).   Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace.
       Specify "!pattern" to exclude a name from the list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only  in  Postfix
       version 2.4 and later.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>authorized_mailq_users</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>static:anyone)</b></h4><pre>
       List of users who are authorized to view the queue.

       By  default,  all  users are allowed to view the queue.  Access is always granted if the invoking user is
       the super-user or the $mail_owner user.  Otherwise, the real UID of the  process  is  looked  up  in  the
       system  password  file, and access is granted only if the corresponding login name is on the access list.
       The username "unknown" is used for processes whose real UID is not found in the password file.

       Specify a list of  user  names,  "/file/name"  or  "type:table"  patterns,  separated  by  commas  and/or
       whitespace.  The  list  is matched left to right, and the search stops on the first match. A "/file/name"
       pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a name matches a  lookup
       key  (the  lookup  result  is  ignored).   Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace.
       Specify "!pattern" to exclude a user name from the list. The form  "!/file/name"  is  supported  only  in
       Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>authorized_submit_users</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>static:anyone)</b></h4><pre>
       List  of  users  who  are authorized to submit mail with the <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1) command (and with the privileged
       <b><a href="../man1/postdrop.1.html">postdrop</a></b>(1) helper command).

       By default, all users are allowed to submit mail.  Otherwise, the real UID of the process is looked up in
       the system password file, and access is granted only if the corresponding login name  is  on  the  access
       list.   The username "unknown" is used for processes whose real UID is not found in the password file. To
       deny mail submission access to all users specify an empty list.

       Specify a list of  user  names,  "/file/name"  or  "type:table"  patterns,  separated  by  commas  and/or
       whitespace.  The  list  is matched left to right, and the search stops on the first match. A "/file/name"
       pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a name matches a  lookup
       key  (the  lookup  result  is  ignored).   Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace.
       Specify "!pattern" to exclude a user name from the list. The form  "!/file/name"  is  supported  only  in
       Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       Example:

       authorized_submit_users = !www, static:all

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>authorized_verp_clients</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$mynetworks)</b></h4><pre>
       What  remote  SMTP  clients are allowed to specify the XVERP command.  This command requests that mail be
       delivered one recipient at a time with a per recipient return address.

       By default, only trusted clients are allowed to specify XVERP.

       This parameter was introduced with Postfix version 1.1.  Postfix version 2.1 renamed  this  parameter  to
       smtpd_authorized_verp_clients and changed the default to none.

       Specify a list of network/netmask patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. The mask specifies the
       number  of  bits  in  the network part of a host address. You can also specify hostnames or .domain names
       (the initial dot causes the domain to match any name below it),  "/file/name" or  "type:table"  patterns.
       A  "/file/name"  pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a table
       entry matches a lookup string (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by starting  the  next
       line  with  whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude an address or network block from the list. The form
       "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       Note: IP version 6 address information must be specified inside [] in the authorized_verp_clients  value,
       and  in  files  specified with "/file/name".  IP version 6 addresses contain the ":" character, and would
       otherwise be confused with a "type:table" pattern.

</pre><h4><b>backwards_bounce_logfile_compatibility</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Produce additional <b><a href="../man8/bounce.8.html">bounce</a></b>(8) logfile records that can be read by Postfix versions before 2.0. The current
       and more  extensible  "name  =  value"  format  is  needed  in  order  to  implement  more  sophisticated
       functionality.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>berkeley_db_create_buffer_size</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>16777216)</b></h4><pre>
       The  per-table I/O buffer size for programs that create Berkeley DB hash or btree tables.  Specify a byte
       count.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>berkeley_db_read_buffer_size</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>131072)</b></h4><pre>
       The per-table I/O buffer size for programs that read Berkeley DB hash or btree tables.   Specify  a  byte
       count.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>best_mx_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Where  the  Postfix  SMTP  client should deliver mail when it detects a "mail loops back to myself" error
       condition. This happens when the local MTA is the best SMTP mail exchanger for a destination  not  listed
       in      $mydestination,      $inet_interfaces,      $proxy_interfaces,     $virtual_alias_domains,     or
       $virtual_mailbox_domains.  By default, the Postfix SMTP client returns such mail as undeliverable.

       Specify, for example, "best_mx_transport = local" to pass the mail from the Postfix SMTP  client  to  the
       <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)  delivery agent. You can specify any message delivery "transport" or "transport:nexthop" that is
       defined in the master.cf file. See the <b><a href="../man5/transport.5.html">transport</a></b>(5) manual page for the syntax and meaning of "transport"
       or "transport:nexthop".

       However, this feature is expensive because it ties up a Postfix SMTP client process  while  the  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)
       delivery  agent  is  doing  its  work. It is more efficient (for Postfix) to list all hosted domains in a
       table or database.

</pre><h4><b>biff</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Whether or not to use the local biff service.  This service sends "new mail" notifications to  users  who
       have requested new mail notification with the UNIX command "biff y".

       For  compatibility reasons this feature is on by default.  On systems with lots of interactive users, the
       biff service can be a performance drain.  Specify "biff = no" in main.cf to disable.

</pre><h4><b>body_checks</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional lookup tables for content inspection as specified in the <b><a href="../man5/body_checks.5.html">body_checks</a></b>(5) manual page.

       Note: with Postfix versions before 2.0, these  rules  inspect  all  content  after  the  primary  message
       headers.

</pre><h4><b>body_checks_size_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>51200)</b></h4><pre>
       How  much  text in a message body segment (or attachment, if you prefer to use that term) is subjected to
       body_checks inspection.  The amount of text is limited to avoid scanning huge attachments.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>bounce_notice_recipient</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>postmaster)</b></h4><pre>
       The recipient of postmaster notifications with the message headers of mail that Postfix did  not  deliver
       and  of SMTP conversation transcripts of mail that Postfix did not receive.  This feature is enabled with
       the notify_classes parameter.

</pre><h4><b>bounce_queue_lifetime</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>5d)</b></h4><pre>
       Consider a bounce message as undeliverable, when delivery fails with a temporary error, and the  time  in
       the queue has reached the bounce_queue_lifetime limit.  By default, this limit is the same as for regular
       mail.

       Specify  a  non-negative  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies
       the time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time
       unit is d (days).

       Specify 0 when mail delivery should be tried only once.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>bounce_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>bounce)</b></h4><pre>
       The  name  of  the  <b><a href="../man8/bounce.8.html">bounce</a></b>(8)  service.  This  service maintains a record of failed delivery attempts and
       generates non-delivery notifications.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>bounce_size_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>50000)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal amount of original message text that is sent in a non-delivery notification. Specify  a  byte
       count.   A message is returned as either message/rfc822 (the complete original) or as text/rfc822-headers
       (the headers only).  With Postfix version 2.4 and earlier, a message is always returned as message/rfc822
       and is truncated when it exceeds the size limit.

       Notes:

       •      If you increase this limit, then you should increase the mime_nesting_limit value proportionally.

       •      Be careful when making changes.  Excessively large values will result in the loss of  non-delivery
              notifications, when a bounce message size exceeds a local or remote MTA's message size limit.

</pre><h4><b>bounce_template_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Pathname of a configuration file with bounce message templates.  These override the built-in templates of
       delivery status notification (DSN) messages for undeliverable mail, delayed mail, successful delivery, or
       delivery verification. The <b><a href="../man5/bounce.5.html">bounce</a></b>(5) manual page describes how to edit and test template files.

       Template  message  body text may contain $name references to Postfix configuration parameters. The result
       of $name expansion can be previewed with "<b>postconf</b> <b>-b</b> <u>file_name</u>" before  the  file  is  placed  into  the
       Postfix configuration directory.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>broken_sasl_auth_clients</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable  interoperability  with remote SMTP clients that implement an obsolete version of the AUTH command
       (RFC 4954). Examples of such clients are MicroSoft Outlook  Express  version  4  and  MicroSoft  Exchange
       version 5.0.

       Specify "broken_sasl_auth_clients = yes" to have Postfix advertise AUTH support in a non-standard way.

</pre><h4><b>canonical_classes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>envelope_sender,</b> <b>envelope_recipient,</b> <b>header_sender,</b> <b>header_recipient)</b></h4><pre>
       What addresses are subject to canonical_maps address mapping.  By default, canonical_maps address mapping
       is  applied  to  envelope  sender  and  recipient  addresses,  and  to header sender and header recipient
       addresses.

       Specify one or more of: envelope_sender, envelope_recipient, header_sender, header_recipient

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>canonical_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional address mapping lookup tables for message headers and envelopes. The mapping is applied to  both
       sender   and   recipient   addresses,   in  both  envelopes  and  in  headers,  as  controlled  with  the
       canonical_classes parameter. This is typically used to clean up dirty addresses from legacy mail systems,
       or to replace login names by  Firstname.Lastname.   The  table  format  and  lookups  are  documented  in
       <b><a href="../man5/canonical.5.html">canonical</a></b>(5). For an overview of Postfix address manipulations see the ADDRESS_REWRITING_README document.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.  Note: these lookups are recursive.

       If you use this feature, run "<b>postmap</b> <b>/etc/postfix/canonical</b>" to build the necessary DBM or DB file after
       every  change.  The  changes will become visible after a minute or so.  Use "<b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>" to eliminate
       the delay.

       Note: with Postfix version 2.2, message header address mapping happens only when message  header  address
       rewriting is enabled:

       •      The message is received with the Postfix <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1) command,

       •      The message is received from a network client that matches $local_header_rewrite_clients,

       •      The message is received from the network, and the remote_header_rewrite_domain parameter specifies
              a non-empty value.

       To get the behavior before Postfix version 2.2, specify "local_header_rewrite_clients = static:all".

       Examples:

       canonical_maps = dbm:/etc/postfix/canonical
       canonical_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/canonical

</pre><h4><b>cleanup_replace_stray_cr_lf</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Replace  each stray &lt;CR&gt; or &lt;LF&gt; character in message content with a space character, to prevent outbound
       SMTP smuggling, and to make the evaluation of Postfix-added DKIM or other signatures independent from how
       a remote mail server handles such characters.

       SMTP does not allow such characters unless they are part of  a  &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;  sequence,  and  different  mail
       systems handle such stray characters in an implementation-dependent manner. Stray &lt;CR&gt; or &lt;LF&gt; characters
       could  be  used  for  outbound  SMTP  smuggling,  where an attacker uses a Postfix server to send message
       content with a non-standard End-of-DATA sequence that triggers inbound SMTP smuggling at  a  remote  SMTP
       server.

       The  replacement  happens  before  all  other  content management, and before Postfix may add a DKIM etc.
       signature; if the signature were created first, the replacement could invalidate the signature.

       In addition to preventing SMTP smuggling, replacing stray &lt;CR&gt; or &lt;LF&gt; characters ensures that the result
       of signature validation by later mail system will not depend on how that mail system handles those  stray
       characters in an implementation-dependent manner.

       Note: this feature is disabled with "receive_override_options = no_header_body_checks".

       This feature is available in Postfix &gt;= 3.9, 3.8.5, 3.7.10, 3.6.14, and 3.5.24.

</pre><h4><b>cleanup_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>cleanup)</b></h4><pre>
       The  name of the <b><a href="../man8/cleanup.8.html">cleanup</a></b>(8) service. This service rewrites addresses into the standard form, and performs
       <b><a href="../man5/canonical.5.html">canonical</a></b>(5) address mapping and <b><a href="../man5/virtual.5.html">virtual</a></b>(5) aliasing.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>command_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The location of all postfix administrative commands.

</pre><h4><b>command_execution_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       The <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) delivery agent working directory for delivery  to  external  commands.   Failure  to  change
       directory causes the delivery to be deferred.

       The  command_execution_directory value is not subject to Postfix configuration parameter $name expansion.
       Instead, the following $name expansions are done on command_execution_directory before the  directory  is
       used.  Expansion  happens  in  the  context  of  the  delivery request.  The result of $name expansion is
       filtered  with  the  character  set  that  is  specified  with  the  execution_directory_expansion_filter
       parameter.

       <b>$user</b>  The recipient's username.

       <b>$shell</b> The recipient's login shell pathname.

       <b>$home</b>  The recipient's home directory.

       <b>$recipient</b>
              The full recipient address.

       <b>$extension</b>
              The optional recipient address extension.

       <b>$domain</b>
              The recipient domain.

       <b>$local</b> The entire recipient localpart.

       <b>$recipient_delimiter</b>
              The  address extension delimiter that was found in the recipient address (Postfix 2.11 and later),
              or the system-wide recipient address extension delimiter (Postfix 2.10 and earlier).

       <b>${name?value}</b>

       <b>${name?{value}}</b> (Postfix &gt;= 3.0)
              Expands to <u>value</u> when <u>$name</u> is non-empty.

       <b>${name:value}</b>

       <b>${name:{value}}</b> (Postfix &gt;= 3.0)
              Expands to <u>value</u> when <u>$name</u> is empty.

       <b>${name?{value1}:{value2}}</b> (Postfix &gt;= 3.0)
              Expands to <u>value1</u> when <u>$name</u> is non-empty, <u>value2</u> otherwise.

       Instead of $name you can also specify ${name} or $(name).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>command_expansion_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       Restrict the characters that the <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) delivery agent allows in $name expansions  of  $mailbox_command
       and $command_execution_directory.  Characters outside the allowed set are replaced by underscores.

</pre><h4><b>command_time_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000s)</b></h4><pre>
       Time  limit  for delivery to external commands. This limit is used by the <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) delivery agent, and is
       the default time limit for delivery by the <b><a href="../man8/pipe.8.html">pipe</a></b>(8) delivery agent.

       Note: if you set this time limit to a large value you must update the  global  ipc_timeout  parameter  as
       well.

</pre><h4><b>compatibility_level</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b></h4><pre>
       A  safety net that causes Postfix to run with backwards-compatible default settings after an upgrade to a
       newer Postfix version.

       With backwards compatibility turned on (the main.cf compatibility_level value is less  than  the  Postfix
       built-in  value),  Postfix  looks  for settings that are left at their implicit default value, and logs a
       message when a backwards-compatible default setting is required.

           using backwards-compatible default setting <u>name=value</u>
               to [accept a specific client request]

           using backwards-compatible default setting <u>name=value</u>
               to [enable specific Postfix behavior]

       See COMPATIBILITY_README for specific message details. If such a message is logged in the  context  of  a
       legitimate  request,  the  system administrator should make the backwards-compatible setting permanent in
       main.cf or master.cf, for example:

           # <b>postconf</b> <u>name=value</u>
           # <b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>

       When no more backwards-compatible settings need to be made permanent, the administrator should  turn  off
       backwards compatibility by updating the compatibility_level setting in main.cf:

           # <b>postconf</b> <b>compatibility_level=</b><u>N</u>
           # <b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>

       For <u>N</u> specify the number that is logged in your <b><a href="../man1/postfix.1.html">postfix</a></b>(1) warning message:

           warning: To disable backwards compatibility use "postconf
               compatibility_level=<u>N</u>" and "postfix reload"

       Starting  with  Postfix  version 3.6, the compatibility level in the above warning message is the Postfix
       version that introduced the last incompatible change. The level is formatted as <u>major.minor.patch</u>,  where
       <u>patch</u> is usually omitted and defaults to zero. Earlier compatibility levels are 0, 1 and 2.

       NOTE:  this  also  introduces  support  for  the  "&lt;level",  "&lt;=level",  and  other  operators to compare
       compatibility levels.  With the standard operators "&lt;", "&lt;=", etc., compatibility level "3.10"  would  be
       smaller than "3.9" which is undesirable.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>config_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The  default location of the Postfix main.cf and master.cf configuration files. This can be overruled via
       the following mechanisms:

       •      The MAIL_CONFIG environment variable (daemon processes and commands).

       •      The "-c" command-line option (commands only).

       With Postfix commands that run with set-gid privileges, a config_directory override either requires  root
       privileges,  or  it requires that the directory is listed with the alternate_config_directories parameter
       in the default main.cf file.

</pre><h4><b>confirm_delay_cleared</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       After sending a "your message is delayed" notification, inform the sender when the delay clears up.  This
       can  result in a sudden burst of notifications at the end of a prolonged network outage, and is therefore
       disabled by default.

       See also: delay_warning_time.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>connection_cache_protocol_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>5s)</b></h4><pre>
       Time limit for connection cache connect, send or receive operations.  The time limit is enforced  in  the
       client.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>connection_cache_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>scache)</b></h4><pre>
       The  name  of  the  <b><a href="../man8/scache.8.html">scache</a></b>(8)  connection cache service.  This service maintains a limited pool of cached
       sessions.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>connection_cache_status_update_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>600s)</b></h4><pre>
       How frequently the <b><a href="../man8/scache.8.html">scache</a></b>(8) server logs usage statistics with connection cache hit and  miss  rates  for
       logical destinations and for physical endpoints.

</pre><h4><b>connection_cache_ttl_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>2s)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal time-to-live value that the <b><a href="../man8/scache.8.html">scache</a></b>(8) connection cache server allows. Requests that specify a
       larger  TTL  will  be  stored  with the maximum allowed TTL. The purpose of this additional control is to
       protect the infrastructure against careless people. The cache TTL is already bounded by $max_idle.

</pre><h4><b>content_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       After the message is queued,  send  the  entire  message  to  the  specified  <u>transport:destination</u>.  The
       <u>transport</u>  name specifies the first field of a mail delivery agent definition in master.cf; the syntax of
       the next-hop <u>destination</u> is described in the manual page  of  the  corresponding  delivery  agent.   More
       information about external content filters is in the Postfix FILTER_README file.

       Notes:

       •      This  setting  has  lower  precedence  than  a  FILTER  action  that is specified in an <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5),
              <b><a href="../man5/header_checks.5.html">header_checks</a></b>(5) or <b><a href="../man5/body_checks.5.html">body_checks</a></b>(5) table.

       •      The meaning of an empty next-hop filter <u>destination</u> is version dependent.  Postfix 2.7  and  later
              will   use   the   recipient   domain;   earlier   versions   will   use   $myhostname.    Specify
              "default_filter_nexthop = $myhostname" for compatibility with Postfix 2.6 or earlier, or specify a
              content_filter value with an explicit next-hop <u>destination</u>.

</pre><h4><b>cyrus_sasl_config_path</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Search path  for  Cyrus  SASL  application  configuration  files,  currently  used  only  to  locate  the
       $smtpd_sasl_path.conf file.  Specify zero or more directories separated by a colon character, or an empty
       value to use Cyrus SASL's built-in search path.

       Note:  some Debian-based Postfix distributions ignore the "cyrus_sasl_config_path" parameter setting, and
       force Postfix to open the file &lt;code&gt;/etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf&lt;/code&gt;.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later when compiled with Cyrus SASL 2.1.22 or later.

</pre><h4><b>daemon_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The directory with Postfix support programs and daemon programs.  These should not be invoked directly by
       humans. The directory must be owned by root.

</pre><h4><b>daemon_table_open_error_is_fatal</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       How a Postfix daemon process handles errors while opening lookup tables: gradual degradation or immediate
       termination.

        <b>no</b>  (default)
              Gradual degradation: a daemon process logs a message of type "error" and continues execution  with
              reduced  functionality.  Features  that do not depend on the unavailable table will work normally,
              while features that depend on the table will result in a type "warning" message.
              When the notify_classes parameter value contains the "data" class, the  Postfix  SMTP  server  and
              client will report transcripts of sessions with an error because a table is unavailable.

        <b>yes</b>  (historical behavior)
              Immediate  termination:  a  daemon process logs a type "fatal" message and terminates immediately.
              This option reduces the number of possible code  paths  through  Postfix,  and  may  therefore  be
              slightly more secure than the default.

       For  the  sake  of  sanity,  the  number of type "error" messages is limited to 13 over the lifetime of a
       daemon process.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.9 and later.

</pre><h4><b>daemon_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>18000s)</b></h4><pre>
       How much time a Postfix daemon process may take to handle a request before it is terminated by a built-in
       watchdog timer.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>data_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The  directory  with  Postfix-writable  data  files  (for  example: caches, pseudo-random numbers).  This
       directory must be owned by the mail_owner account, and must not be shared with non-Postfix software.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.

</pre><h4><b>debug_peer_level</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>2)</b></h4><pre>
       The increment in verbose logging level when a nexthop  destination,  remote  client  or  server  name  or
       network address matches a pattern given with the debug_peer_list parameter.

       Per-nexthop debug logging is available in Postfix 3.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>debug_peer_list</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  list  of nexthop destination, remote client or server name or network address patterns that, if
       matched, cause the verbose logging level to increase by the amount specified in $debug_peer_level.

       Per-nexthop debug logging is available in Postfix 3.6 and later.

       Specify domain names, network/netmask patterns, "/file/name" patterns or "type:table" lookup tables.  The
       right-hand side result from "type:table" lookups is ignored.

       Pattern  matching  of  domain  names is controlled by the presence or absence of "debug_peer_list" in the
       parent_domain_matches_subdomains parameter value.

       Examples:

       debug_peer_list = 127.0.0.1
       debug_peer_list = example.com

</pre><h4><b>debugger_command</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       The external command to execute when a Postfix daemon program is invoked with the -D option.

       Use "command .. &amp; sleep 5" so that the debugger can attach before the process marches on. If you  use  an
       X-based debugger, be sure to set up your XAUTHORITY environment variable before starting Postfix.

       Note:  the command is subject to $name expansion, before it is passed to the default command interpreter.
       Specify "$$" to produce a single "$" character.

       Example:

       debugger_command =
           PATH=<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>:/usr/X11R6/bin
           ddd $daemon_directory/$process_name $process_id &amp; sleep 5

</pre><h4><b>default_database_type</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The default database type for use in <b><a href="../man1/newaliases.1.html">newaliases</a></b>(1), <b><a href="../man1/postalias.1.html">postalias</a></b>(1) and <b><a href="../man1/postmap.1.html">postmap</a></b>(1) commands.  On  many  UNIX
       systems  the default type is either <b>dbm</b> or <b>hash</b>. The default setting is frozen when the Postfix system is
       built.

       Examples:

       default_database_type = hash
       default_database_type = dbm

</pre><h4><b>default_delivery_slot_cost</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>5)</b></h4><pre>
       How often the Postfix queue manager's scheduler is allowed  to  preempt  delivery  of  one  message  with
       another.

       Each  transport maintains a so-called "available delivery slot counter" for each message. One message can
       be preempted by another one when the other message can be delivered using no more delivery  slots  (i.e.,
       invocations  of  delivery  agents)  than  the current message counter has accumulated (or will eventually
       accumulate - see about slot loans below). This parameter controls how often the counter is incremented  -
       it happens after each default_delivery_slot_cost recipients have been delivered.

       The  cost of 0 is used to disable the preempting scheduling completely.  The minimum value the scheduling
       algorithm can use is 2 - use it if you want to maximize the message throughput rate. Although there is no
       maximum, it doesn't make much sense to use values above say 50.

       The only reason why the value of 2 is not the default is the way this parameter affects the  delivery  of
       mailing-list mail. In the worst case, delivery can take somewhere between (cost+1/cost) and (cost/cost-1)
       times  more  than  if  the preemptive scheduler was disabled. The default value of 5 turns out to provide
       reasonable message response times while making sure the mailing-list deliveries are not extended by  more
       than 20-25 percent even in the worst case.

       Use  <u>transport</u>_delivery_slot_cost  to  specify  a  transport-specific  override,  where  <u>transport</u> is the
       master.cf name of the message delivery transport.

       Examples:

       default_delivery_slot_cost = 0
       default_delivery_slot_cost = 2

</pre><h4><b>default_delivery_slot_discount</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>50)</b></h4><pre>
       The default value for transport-specific _delivery_slot_discount settings.

       This parameter speeds up the moment when a message preemption can happen. Instead of  waiting  until  the
       full   amount   of   delivery   slots   required   is   available,   the   preemption   can  happen  when
       <u>transport</u>_delivery_slot_discount percent of the required amount plus  <u>transport</u>_delivery_slot_loan  still
       remains  to  be  accumulated.  Note that the full amount will still have to be accumulated before another
       preemption can take place later.

       Use <u>transport</u>_delivery_slot_discount to specify a transport-specific override,  where  <u>transport</u>  is  the
       master.cf name of the message delivery transport.

</pre><h4><b>default_delivery_slot_loan</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3)</b></h4><pre>
       The default value for transport-specific _delivery_slot_loan settings.

       This  parameter  speeds  up the moment when a message preemption can happen. Instead of waiting until the
       full  amount  of   delivery   slots   required   is   available,   the   preemption   can   happen   when
       transport_delivery_slot_discount  percent  of the required amount plus transport_delivery_slot_loan still
       remains to be accumulated.  Note that the full amount will still have to be  accumulated  before  another
       preemption can take place later.

       Use  <u>transport</u>_delivery_slot_loan  to  specify  a  transport-specific  override,  where  <u>transport</u> is the
       master.cf name of the message delivery transport.

</pre><h4><b>default_delivery_status_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional filter in Postfix delivery agents, to replace the delivery status code or  explanatory  text  of
       successful  or  unsuccessful  deliveries.  This  allows  the replacement of a temporary error status code
       (4.X.X) with a permanent error status code (5.X.X) or vice versa, but does not allow the replacement of a
       successful status code (2.X.X) with an unsuccessful status code (4.X.X or 5.X.X) or vice versa.

       Note: the (smtp|lmtp)_delivery_status_filter is  applied  only  once  per  recipient:  when  delivery  is
       successful, when delivery is rejected with 5XX, or when there are no more alternate MX or A destinations.
       Use smtp_reply_filter or lmtp_reply_filter to inspect responses for all delivery attempts.

       The   following   parameters   can   be  used  to  implement  a  filter  for  specific  delivery  agents:
       lmtp_delivery_status_filter,          local_delivery_status_filter,          pipe_delivery_status_filter,
       smtp_delivery_status_filter  or  virtual_delivery_status_filter. These parameters support the same filter
       syntax as described here.

       Specify zero or more "type:table" lookup  table  names,  separated  by  comma  or  whitespace.  For  each
       successful  or  unsuccessful  delivery to a recipient, the tables are queried in the specified order with
       one line of text that is structured as follows:

           enhanced-status-code SPACE explanatory-text

       The first table match wins. The lookup result must have the same structure as  the  query,  a  successful
       status code (2.X.X) must be replaced with a successful status code, an unsuccessful status code (4.X.X or
       5.X.X)  must  be  replaced  with  an  unsuccessful  status  code,  and the explanatory text field must be
       non-empty. Other results will result in a warning.

       Example 1: convert specific soft TLS errors into hard errors, by  overriding  the  first  number  in  the
       enhanced status code.

           /etc/postfix/main.cf:
               smtp_delivery_status_filter = pcre:/etc/postfix/smtp_dsn_filter

           /etc/postfix/smtp_dsn_filter:
               /^4(\.\d+\.\d+ TLS is required, but host \S+ refused to start TLS: .+)/
                   5$1
               /^4(\.\d+\.\d+ TLS is required, but was not offered by host .+)/
                   5$1
               # Do not change the following into hard bounces. They may
               # result from a local configuration problem.
               # 4.\d+.\d+ TLS is required, but our TLS engine is unavailable
               # 4.\d+.\d+ TLS is required, but unavailable
               # 4.\d+.\d+ Cannot start TLS: handshake failure

       Example  2:  censor  the  per-recipient  delivery  status text so that it does not reveal the destination
       command or filename when a remote sender requests confirmation of successful delivery.

           /etc/postfix/main.cf:
               local_delivery_status_filter = pcre:/etc/postfix/local_dsn_filter

           /etc/postfix/local_dsn_filter:
               /^(2\S+ delivered to file).+/    $1
               /^(2\S+ delivered to command).+/ $1

       Notes:

       •      This feature will NOT override the soft_bounce safety net.

       •      This feature will change the enhanced status code and text that is logged to the maillog file, and
              that is reported to the sender in delivery confirmation or non-delivery notifications.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>default_destination_concurrency_failed_cohort_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1)</b></h4><pre>
       How many pseudo-cohorts must suffer connection or handshake failure  before  a  specific  destination  is
       considered  unavailable  (and  further  delivery  is  suspended). Specify zero to disable this feature. A
       destination's pseudo-cohort failure count is reset each time a delivery completes without  connection  or
       handshake failure for that specific destination.

       A pseudo-cohort is the number of deliveries equal to a destination's delivery concurrency.

       Use <u>transport</u>_destination_concurrency_failed_cohort_limit to specify a transport-specific override, where
       <u>transport</u> is the master.cf name of the message delivery transport.

       This  feature  is  available  in  Postfix  2.5.  The  default  setting is compatible with earlier Postfix
       versions.

</pre><h4><b>default_destination_concurrency_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>20)</b></h4><pre>
       The default maximal number of parallel deliveries to the same destination.  This is the default limit for
       delivery via the <b><a href="../man8/lmtp.8.html">lmtp</a></b>(8), <b><a href="../man8/pipe.8.html">pipe</a></b>(8), <b><a href="../man8/smtp.8.html">smtp</a></b>(8)  and  <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8)  delivery  agents.   With  a  per-destination
       recipient limit &gt; 1, a destination is a domain, otherwise it is a recipient.

       Use  <u>transport</u>_destination_concurrency_limit to specify a transport-specific override, where <u>transport</u> is
       the master.cf name of the message delivery transport.

</pre><h4><b>default_destination_concurrency_negative_feedback</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1)</b></h4><pre>
       The per-destination amount of delivery concurrency negative feedback, after a delivery completes  with  a
       connection or handshake failure. Feedback values are in the range 0..1 inclusive. With negative feedback,
       concurrency  is  decremented at the beginning of a sequence of length 1/feedback. This is unlike positive
       feedback, where concurrency is incremented at the end of a sequence of length 1/feedback.

       As of Postfix version 2.5, negative feedback cannot reduce delivery  concurrency  to  zero.   Instead,  a
       destination  is  marked  dead  (further  delivery suspended) after the failed pseudo-cohort count reaches
       $default_destination_concurrency_failed_cohort_limit                                                  (or
       $<u>transport</u>_destination_concurrency_failed_cohort_limit).   To  make  the  scheduler  completely immune to
       connection or handshake failures, specify a zero feedback value and a zero failed pseudo-cohort limit.

       Specify one of the following forms:

       <u>number</u>

       <u>number</u> / <u>number</u>
              Constant feedback. The value must be in the range 0..1 inclusive.  The default setting of  "1"  is
              compatible  with  Postfix  versions  before  2.5,  where  a  destination's delivery concurrency is
              throttled down to zero (and further delivery suspended) after a single failed pseudo-cohort.

       <u>number</u> / concurrency
              Variable feedback of "<u>number</u> / (delivery concurrency)".  The <u>number</u> must  be  in  the  range  0..1
              inclusive.  With  <u>number</u>  equal  to  "1", a destination's delivery concurrency is decremented by 1
              after each failed pseudo-cohort.

       A pseudo-cohort is the number of deliveries equal to a destination's delivery concurrency.

       Use <u>transport</u>_destination_concurrency_negative_feedback to specify a transport-specific  override,  where
       <u>transport</u> is the master.cf name of the message delivery transport.

       This  feature  is  available  in  Postfix  2.5.  The  default  setting is compatible with earlier Postfix
       versions.

</pre><h4><b>default_destination_concurrency_positive_feedback</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1)</b></h4><pre>
       The per-destination amount of delivery concurrency positive feedback, after a delivery completes  without
       connection  or  handshake  failure.  Feedback  values  are  in the range 0..1 inclusive.  The concurrency
       increases until it reaches  the  per-destination  maximal  concurrency  limit.  With  positive  feedback,
       concurrency  is  incremented  at  the  end  of a sequence with length 1/feedback. This is unlike negative
       feedback, where concurrency is decremented at the start of a sequence of length 1/feedback.

       Specify one of the following forms:

       <u>number</u>

       <u>number</u> / <u>number</u>
              Constant feedback.  The value must be in the range 0..1 inclusive. The default setting of  "1"  is
              compatible  with  Postfix  versions before 2.5, where a destination's delivery concurrency doubles
              after each successful pseudo-cohort.

       <u>number</u> / concurrency
              Variable feedback of "<u>number</u> / (delivery concurrency)".  The <u>number</u> must  be  in  the  range  0..1
              inclusive.  With  <u>number</u>  equal  to  "1", a destination's delivery concurrency is incremented by 1
              after each successful pseudo-cohort.

       A pseudo-cohort is the number of deliveries equal to a destination's delivery concurrency.

       Use <u>transport</u>_destination_concurrency_positive_feedback to specify a transport-specific  override,  where
       <u>transport</u> is the master.cf name of the message delivery transport.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.

</pre><h4><b>default_destination_rate_delay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0s)</b></h4><pre>
       The  default  amount  of  delay  that  is  inserted  between  individual  message  deliveries to the same
       destination and over the same message delivery transport. Specify a non-zero value  to  rate-limit  those
       message deliveries to at most one per $default_destination_rate_delay.

       The resulting behavior depends on the value of the corresponding per-destination recipient limit.

       •      With  a  corresponding  per-destination  recipient  limit  &gt;  1, the rate delay specifies the time
              between deliveries to the <u>same</u> <u>domain</u>.  Different domains are delivered in  parallel,  subject  to
              the process limits specified in master.cf.

       •      With a corresponding per-destination recipient limit equal to 1, the rate delay specifies the time
              between  deliveries to the <u>same</u> <u>recipient</u>. Different recipients are delivered in parallel, subject
              to the process limits specified in master.cf.

       To enable the delay, specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter  suffix
       that specifies the time unit).

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m  (minutes),  h  (hours),  d  (days), w (weeks). The default time unit is s
       (seconds).

       NOTE: the delay is enforced by the queue manager. The delay timer state does not survive "<b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>"
       or "<b>postfix</b> <b>stop</b>".

       Use <u>transport</u>_destination_rate_delay to specify a transport-specific override,  where  <u>transport</u>  is  the
       master.cf name of the message delivery transport.

       NOTE:          with         a         non-zero         _destination_rate_delay,         specify         a
       <u>transport</u>_destination_concurrency_failed_cohort_limit of 10 or more to prevent Postfix from deferring all
       mail for the same destination after only one connection or handshake error.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.

</pre><h4><b>default_destination_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>50)</b></h4><pre>
       The default maximal number of recipients per message delivery.  This is the default  limit  for  delivery
       via the <b><a href="../man8/lmtp.8.html">lmtp</a></b>(8), <b><a href="../man8/pipe.8.html">pipe</a></b>(8), <b><a href="../man8/smtp.8.html">smtp</a></b>(8) and <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery agents.

       Setting this parameter to a value of 1 affects email deliveries as follows:

       •      It changes the meaning of the corresponding per-destination concurrency limit, from concurrency of
              deliveries  to  the  <u>same</u>  <u>domain</u> into concurrency of deliveries to the <u>same</u> <u>recipient</u>.  Different
              recipients are delivered in parallel, subject to the process limits specified in master.cf.

       •      It changes the meaning of the corresponding per-destination rate delay,  from  the  delay  between
              deliveries  to  the  <u>same</u>  <u>domain</u> into the delay between deliveries to the <u>same</u> <u>recipient</u>.  Again,
              different recipients are delivered in  parallel,  subject  to  the  process  limits  specified  in
              master.cf.

       •      It  changes  the meaning of other corresponding per-destination settings in a similar manner, from
              settings for delivery to the <u>same</u> <u>domain</u> into settings for delivery to the <u>same</u> <u>recipient</u>.

       Use <u>transport</u>_destination_recipient_limit to specify a transport-specific override,  where  <u>transport</u>  is
       the master.cf name of the message delivery transport.

</pre><h4><b>default_extra_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000)</b></h4><pre>
       The  default value for the extra per-transport limit imposed on the number of in-memory recipients.  This
       extra recipient space is reserved for the cases when the Postfix queue manager's scheduler  preempts  one
       message  with  another  and  suddenly needs some extra recipient slots for the chosen message in order to
       avoid performance degradation.

       Use <u>transport</u>_extra_recipient_limit to specify a transport-specific  override,  where  <u>transport</u>  is  the
       master.cf name of the message delivery transport.

</pre><h4><b>default_filter_nexthop</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       When   a   content_filter   or   FILTER   request   specifies   no  explicit  next-hop  destination,  use
       $default_filter_nexthop instead; when that value is empty, use  the  domain  in  the  recipient  address.
       Specify "default_filter_nexthop = $myhostname" for compatibility with Postfix version 2.6 and earlier, or
       specify an explicit next-hop destination with each content_filter value or FILTER action.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.7 and later.

</pre><h4><b>default_minimum_delivery_slots</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3)</b></h4><pre>
       How  many  recipients  a  message  must  have  in  order to invoke the Postfix queue manager's scheduling
       algorithm at all.  Messages which would never accumulate at least this many delivery  slots  (subject  to
       slot cost parameter as well) are never preempted.

       Use  <u>transport</u>_minimum_delivery_slots  to  specify  a transport-specific override, where <u>transport</u> is the
       master.cf name of the message delivery transport.

</pre><h4><b>default_privs</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>nobody)</b></h4><pre>
       The default rights used by the <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) delivery agent for delivery  to  an  external  file  or  command.
       These  rights  are used when delivery is requested from an <b><a href="../man5/aliases.5.html">aliases</a></b>(5) file that is owned by <b>root</b>, or when
       delivery is done on behalf of <b>root</b>. <b>DO</b> <b>NOT</b> <b>SPECIFY</b> <b>A</b> <b>PRIVILEGED</b> <b>USER</b> <b>OR</b> <b>THE</b> <b>POSTFIX</b> <b>OWNER</b>.

</pre><h4><b>default_process_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100)</b></h4><pre>
       The default maximal number of Postfix child processes that provide a given service.  This  limit  can  be
       overruled for specific services in the master.cf file.

</pre><h4><b>default_rbl_reply</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The  default  Postfix  SMTP  server  response  template  for  a  request that is rejected by an RBL-based
       restriction. This template can be overruled by specific entries in  the  optional  rbl_reply_maps  lookup
       table.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       The  template  does  not support Postfix configuration parameter $name substitution. Instead, it supports
       exactly one level of $name substitution for the following attributes:

       <b>$client</b>
              The client hostname and IP address, formatted as name[address].

       <b>$client_address</b>
              The client IP address.

       <b>$client_name</b>
              The client hostname or "unknown". See reject_unknown_client_hostname for more details.

       <b>$reverse_client_name</b>
              The     client     hostname     from     address-&gt;name     lookup,     or     "unknown".       See
              reject_unknown_reverse_client_hostname for more details.

       <b>$helo_name</b>
              The hostname given in HELO or EHLO command or empty string.

       <b>$rbl_class</b>
              The denylisted entity type: Client host, Helo command, Sender address, or Recipient address.

       <b>$rbl_code</b>
              The  numerical  SMTP  response  code,  as  specified  with  the maps_rbl_reject_code configuration
              parameter. Note: The numerical SMTP response code is required, and must appear at the start of the
              reply. With Postfix version 2.3 and later this information may be followed by an RFC 3463 enhanced
              status code.

       <b>$rbl_domain</b>
              The RBL domain (without any <u>=address-filter</u>) where $rbl_what is denylisted.

       <b>$rbl_reason</b>
              The reason why $rbl_what is denylisted, or an empty string.

       <b>$rbl_what</b>
              The entity that is denylisted (an IP address, a hostname, a domain name, or an email address whose
              domain was denylisted).

       <b>$recipient</b>
              The recipient address or &lt;&gt; in case of the null address.

       <b>$recipient_domain</b>
              The recipient domain or empty string.

       <b>$recipient_name</b>
              The recipient address localpart or &lt;&gt; in case of null address.

       <b>$sender</b>
              The sender address or &lt;&gt; in case of the null address.

       <b>$sender_domain</b>
              The sender domain or empty string.

       <b>$sender_name</b>
              The sender address localpart or &lt;&gt; in case of the null address.

       <b>${name?value}</b>

       <b>${name?{value}}</b> (Postfix &gt;= 3.0)
              Expands to <u>value</u> when <u>$name</u> is non-empty.

       <b>${name:value}</b>

       <b>${name:{value}}</b> (Postfix &gt;= 3.0)
              Expands to <u>value</u> when <u>$name</u> is empty.

       <b>${name?{value1}:{value2}}</b> (Postfix &gt;= 3.0)
              Expands to <u>value1</u> when <u>$name</u> is non-empty, <u>value2</u> otherwise.

       Instead of $name you can also specify ${name} or $(name).

       Note: when an enhanced status code is specified in an RBL reply template, it is subject to  modification.
       The  following  transformations  are needed when the same RBL response template is used for client, helo,
       sender, or recipient access restrictions.

       •      When rejecting a sender address, the Postfix SMTP server will transform  a  recipient  DSN  status
              (e.g., 4.1.1-4.1.6) into the corresponding sender DSN status, and vice versa.

       •      When  rejecting  non-address  information  (such  as  the  HELO  command  argument  or  the client
              hostname/address), the Postfix SMTP server will transform a sender or recipient DSN status into  a
              generic non-address DSN status (e.g., 4.0.0).

</pre><h4><b>default_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>20000)</b></h4><pre>
       The  default per-transport upper limit on the number of in-memory recipients.  These limits take priority
       over the global qmgr_message_recipient_limit after the  message  has  been  assigned  to  the  respective
       transports.  See also default_extra_recipient_limit and qmgr_message_recipient_minimum.

       Use  <u>transport</u>_recipient_limit to specify a transport-specific override, where <u>transport</u> is the master.cf
       name of the message delivery transport.

</pre><h4><b>default_recipient_refill_delay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>5s)</b></h4><pre>
       The default per-transport maximum delay between refilling recipients.  When not  all  message  recipients
       fit  into  memory at once, keep loading more of them at least once every this many seconds.  This is used
       to make sure the recipients are refilled in a timely manner even when $default_recipient_refill_limit  is
       too high for too slow deliveries.

       Use  <u>transport</u>_recipient_refill_delay  to  specify  a transport-specific override, where <u>transport</u> is the
       master.cf name of the message delivery transport.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.4 and later.

</pre><h4><b>default_recipient_refill_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100)</b></h4><pre>
       The default per-transport limit on the number of recipients refilled  at  once.   When  not  all  message
       recipients fit into memory at once, keep loading more of them in batches of at least this many at a time.
       See also $default_recipient_refill_delay, which may result in recipient batches lower than this when this
       limit is too high for too slow deliveries.

       Use  <u>transport</u>_recipient_refill_limit  to  specify  a transport-specific override, where <u>transport</u> is the
       master.cf name of the message delivery transport.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.4 and later.

</pre><h4><b>default_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>smtp)</b></h4><pre>
       The default mail delivery transport and next-hop destination for  the  default  domain  class:  recipient
       domains  that  do  not match $mydestination, $inet_interfaces, $proxy_interfaces, $virtual_alias_domains,
       $virtual_mailbox_domains,   or   $relay_domains.   This   information   will    not    be    used    when
       sender_dependent_default_transport_maps  returns  a  result,  and may be overridden with the <b><a href="../man5/transport.5.html">transport</a></b>(5)
       table.

       For recipient domains in the default domain class:

       •      In order of decreasing precedence, the delivery transport is taken  from  1)  $transport_maps,  2)
              $sender_dependent_default_transport_maps or $default_transport.

       •      In  order  of  decreasing precedence, the nexthop destination is taken from 1) $transport_maps, 2)
              $sender_dependent_default_transport_maps           or            $default_transport,            3)
              $sender_dependent_relayhost_maps or $relayhost or the recipient domain.

       Specify  a string of the form <u>transport:nexthop</u>, where <u>transport</u> is the name of a mail delivery transport
       defined in master.cf.  The <u>:nexthop</u> destination is optional; its syntax is documented in the manual  page
       of  the  corresponding  delivery  agent.  In  the  case of SMTP or LMTP, specify one or more destinations
       separated by comma or whitespace (with Postfix 3.5 and later).

       Example:

       default_transport = uucp:relayhostname

</pre><h4><b>default_transport_rate_delay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0s)</b></h4><pre>
       The default amount of delay that is inserted between individual message deliveries over the same  message
       delivery  transport,  regardless  of  destination.  Specify  a non-zero value to rate-limit those message
       deliveries to at most one per $default_transport_rate_delay.

       Use <u>transport</u>_transport_rate_delay to specify a transport-specific override, where the initial  <u>transport</u>
       is the master.cf name of the message delivery transport.

       Example: throttle outbound SMTP mail to at most 3 deliveries per minute.

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           smtp_transport_rate_delay = 20s

       To  enable the delay, specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix
       that specifies the time unit).

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d  (days),  w  (weeks).  The  default  time  unit  is  s
       (seconds).

       NOTE: the delay is enforced by the queue manager.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>default_verp_delimiters</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>+=)</b></h4><pre>
       The  two default VERP delimiter characters. These are used when no explicit delimiters are specified with
       the SMTP XVERP command or with the "<b>sendmail</b> <b>-XV</b>" command-line option  (Postfix  2.2  and  earlier:  <b>-V</b>).
       Specify characters that are allowed by the verp_delimiter_filter setting.

       This feature is available in Postfix 1.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>defer_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>450)</b></h4><pre>
       The  numerical  Postfix  SMTP  server  response code when a remote SMTP client request is rejected by the
       "defer" restriction.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 5321.

</pre><h4><b>defer_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>defer)</b></h4><pre>
       The name of the defer service. This service is implemented by the <b><a href="../man8/bounce.8.html">bounce</a></b>(8) daemon and maintains a record
       of failed delivery attempts and generates non-delivery notifications.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>defer_transports</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       The names of message delivery transports that should not deliver mail unless someone issues "<b>sendmail</b> <b>-q</b>"
       or equivalent. Specify zero or more mail delivery transport names that  appear  in  the  first  field  of
       master.cf.

       Example:

       defer_transports = smtp

</pre><h4><b>delay_logging_resolution_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>2)</b></h4><pre>
       The  maximal  number of digits after the decimal point when logging delay values. Specify a number in the
       range 0..6.

       To improve readability, delays are logged with only a limited number of significant digits:

       •      Delays &gt;= 100s are rounded off to an integral number of seconds.

       •      Delays &lt; 10^-$delay_logging_resolution_limit are rounded off to "0".

       •      Other delays are rounded off to two significant digits, or fewer if the result  would  exceed  the
              delay_logging_resolution_limit.

       The format of the "delays=a/b/c/d" logging is as follows:

       •      a = Time from message arrival to last active queue entry.

       •      b = Time from last active queue entry to the beginning of connection setup.

       •      c  =  Time  in connection setup. With SMTP, that is the time before sending the MAIL FROM command:
              with a new connection, that includes DNS lookups, and protocol  handshakes  with  TCP,  EHLO,  and
              STARTTLS;  with  a reused connection, that includes DNS lookups, connection cache lookup by domain
              or IP address, and a liveness probe with RSET.

       •      d = Time in message transmission. With SMTP, that starts with sending MAIL FROM.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>delay_notice_recipient</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>postmaster)</b></h4><pre>
       The recipient of postmaster notifications with the message headers  of  mail  that  cannot  be  delivered
       within $delay_warning_time time units.

       See also: delay_warning_time, notify_classes.

</pre><h4><b>delay_warning_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0h)</b></h4><pre>
       The  time after which the sender receives a copy of the message headers of mail that is still queued. The
       confirm_delay_cleared parameter controls sender notification when the delay clears up.

       To enable this feature, specify a non-zero time value (an integral  value  plus  an  optional  one-letter
       suffix that specifies the time unit).

       Time  units:  s  (seconds),  m  (minutes),  h  (hours),  d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit is h
       (hours).

       See also: delay_notice_recipient, notify_classes, confirm_delay_cleared.

</pre><h4><b>deliver_lock_attempts</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>20)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal number of attempts to acquire an exclusive lock on a mailbox file or <b><a href="../man8/bounce.8.html">bounce</a></b>(8) logfile.

</pre><h4><b>deliver_lock_delay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1s)</b></h4><pre>
       The time between attempts to acquire an exclusive lock on a mailbox file or <b><a href="../man8/bounce.8.html">bounce</a></b>(8) logfile.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>destination_concurrency_feedback_debug</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Make the queue manager's feedback algorithm verbose for performance analysis purposes.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.

</pre><h4><b>detect_8bit_encoding_header</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Automatically  detect  8BITMIME  body  content  by looking at Content-Transfer-Encoding: message headers;
       historically, this behavior was hard-coded to be "always on".

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.

</pre><h4><b>disable_dns_lookups</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Disable DNS lookups in the Postfix SMTP and LMTP clients. When disabled, hosts are  looked  up  with  the
       getaddrinfo()  system  library routine which normally also looks in /etc/hosts.  As of Postfix 2.11, this
       parameter is deprecated; use smtp_dns_support_level instead.

       DNS lookups are enabled by default.

</pre><h4><b>disable_mime_input_processing</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Turn off MIME processing while receiving  mail.  This  means  that  no  special  treatment  is  given  to
       Content-Type:  message  headers,  and that all text after the initial message headers is considered to be
       part of the message body.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       Mime input processing is enabled by default, and is needed in order to recognize MIME headers in  message
       content.

</pre><h4><b>disable_mime_output_conversion</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Disable  the  conversion  of  8BITMIME  format to 7BIT format.  Mime output conversion is needed when the
       destination does not advertise 8BITMIME support.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>disable_verp_bounces</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Disable sending one bounce report per recipient.

       The default, one per recipient, is what ezmlm needs.

       This feature is available in Postfix 1.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>disable_vrfy_command</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Disable the SMTP VRFY command. This stops some techniques used to harvest email addresses.

       Example:

       disable_vrfy_command = no

</pre><h4><b>dns_ncache_ttl_fix_enable</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable a workaround for future libc incompatibility. The Postfix  implementation  of  RFC  2308  negative
       reply  caching  relies  on the promise that res_query() and res_search() invoke res_send(), which returns
       the server response in an application buffer even if the requested record does not exist. If this promise
       is broken, specify "yes" to enable a  workaround for DNS reputation lookups.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>dnsblog_reply_delay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0s)</b></h4><pre>
       A debugging aid to artificially delay DNS responses.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>dnsblog_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>dnsblog)</b></h4><pre>
       The name of the <b><a href="../man8/dnsblog.8.html">dnsblog</a></b>(8) service entry in master.cf. This service performs DNS allow/denylist lookups.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 and later.

</pre><h4><b>dnssec_probe</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>ns:.)</b></h4><pre>
       The DNS query type (default: "ns") and DNS query name (default: ".") that Postfix may  use  to  determine
       whether DNSSEC validation is available.

       Background: DNSSEC validation is needed for Postfix DANE support; this ensures that Postfix receives TLSA
       records  with  secure TLS server certificate info. When DNSSEC validation is unavailable, mail deliveries
       using <u>opportunistic</u> DANE will not be protected by server certificate  info  in  TLSA  records,  and  mail
       deliveries using <u>mandatory</u> DANE will not be made at all.

       By  default,  a  Postfix  process  will  send  a  DNSSEC probe after 1) the process made a DNS query that
       requested DNSSEC validation, 2) the process did not receive a DNSSEC validated response to this query  or
       to an earlier query, and 3) the process did not already send a DNSSEC probe.

       When  the  DNSSEC  probe  has  no  response, or when the response is not DNSSEC validated, Postfix logs a
       warning that DNSSEC validation may be unavailable.

       Example:

       warning: DNSSEC validation may be unavailable
       warning: reason: dnssec_probe 'ns:.' received a response that is not DNSSEC validated
       warning: reason: dnssec_probe 'ns:.' received no response: Server failure

       Possible reasons why DNSSEC validation may be unavailable:

       •      The local <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> file specifies a DNS resolver that does not validate DNSSEC  signatures
              (that's $queue_directory/etc/resolv.conf when a Postfix daemon runs in a chroot jail).

       •      The  local  system library does not pass on the "DNSSEC validated" bit to Postfix, or Postfix does
              not know how to ask the library to do that.

       By default, the DNSSEC probe asks for the DNS root zone NS records, because resolvers should always  have
       that information cached. If Postfix runs on a network where the DNS root zone is not reachable, specify a
       different probe, or specify an empty dnssec_probe value to disable the feature.

       This  feature is available in Postfix 3.6 and later. It was backported to Postfix versions 3.5.9, 3.4.19,
       3.3.16. 3.2.21.

</pre><h4><b>dont_remove</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b></h4><pre>
       Don't remove queue files and save them to the "saved" mail queue.  This is a debugging aid.   To  inspect
       the envelope information and content of a Postfix queue file, use the <b><a href="../man1/postcat.1.html">postcat</a></b>(1) command.

</pre><h4><b>double_bounce_sender</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>double-bounce)</b></h4><pre>
       The  sender  address  of postmaster notifications that are generated by the mail system. All mail to this
       address is silently discarded, in order to terminate mail bounce loops.

</pre><h4><b>duplicate_filter_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal number of addresses remembered by the address duplicate filter for <b><a href="../man5/aliases.5.html">aliases</a></b>(5)  or  <b><a href="../man5/virtual.5.html">virtual</a></b>(5)
       alias expansion, or for <b><a href="../man8/showq.8.html">showq</a></b>(8) queue displays.

</pre><h4><b>empty_address_default_transport_maps_lookup_key</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>&lt;&gt;)</b></h4><pre>
       The  sender_dependent_default_transport_maps  search  string that will be used instead of the null sender
       address.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.7 and later.

</pre><h4><b>empty_address_local_login_sender_maps_lookup_key</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>&lt;&gt;)</b></h4><pre>
       The lookup key to be used in local_login_sender_maps tables, instead of the null sender address.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>empty_address_recipient</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>MAILER-DAEMON)</b></h4><pre>
       The recipient of mail addressed to the null address.  Postfix does not  accept  such  addresses  in  SMTP
       commands, but they may still be created locally as the result of configuration or software error.

</pre><h4><b>empty_address_relayhost_maps_lookup_key</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>&lt;&gt;)</b></h4><pre>
       The sender_dependent_relayhost_maps search string that will be used instead of the null sender address.

       This    feature    is    available    in    Postfix    2.5    and    later.    With   earlier   versions,
       sender_dependent_relayhost_maps lookups were skipped for the null sender address.

</pre><h4><b>enable_errors_to</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Report mail delivery errors to the address specified with the  non-standard  Errors-To:  message  header,
       instead  of  the envelope sender address (this feature is removed with Postfix version 2.2, is turned off
       by default with Postfix version 2.1, and is always turned on with older Postfix versions).

</pre><h4><b>enable_idna2003_compatibility</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable 'transitional' compatibility between IDNA2003 and IDNA2008, when  converting  UTF-8  domain  names
       to/from  the ASCII form that is used for DNS lookups. Specify "yes" for compatibility with Postfix &lt;= 3.1
       (not recommended). This affects the conversion of domain names that contain for example the German sz and
       the Greek zeta.  See https://unicode.org/cldr/utility/idna.jsp for more examples.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>enable_long_queue_ids</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable long, non-repeating, queue IDs (queue file names).  The benefit of non-repeating names is  simpler
       logfile  analysis  and  easier  queue migration (there is no need to run "postsuper" to change queue file
       names that don't match their message file inode number).

       Note: see below for how to convert long queue file names to Postfix &lt;= 2.8.

       Changing the parameter value to "yes" has the following effects:

       •      Existing queue file names are not affected.

       •      New queue files are  created  with  names  such  as  3Pt2mN2VXxznjll.   These  are  encoded  in  a
              52-character  alphabet that contains digits (0-9), upper-case letters (B-Z) and lower-case letters
              (b-z). For safety reasons the vowels (AEIOUaeiou) are excluded from the alphabet.  The name format
              is: 6 or more characters for the time in seconds, 4 characters for the time in  microseconds,  the
              'z'; the remainder is the file inode number encoded in the first 51 characters of the 52-character
              alphabet.

       •      New messages have a Message-ID header with <u>queueID</u>@<u>myhostname</u>.

       •      The  mailq  (postqueue -p) output has a wider Queue ID column.  The number of whitespace-separated
              fields is not changed.

       •      The hash_queue_depth algorithm uses the first characters  of  the  queue  file  creation  time  in
              microseconds,  after  conversion  into  hexadecimal  representation.  This produces the same queue
              hashing behavior as if the queue file name was created with "enable_long_queue_ids = no".

       Changing the parameter value to "no" has the following effects:

       •      Existing long queue file names are renamed to the short form (while running  "postfix  reload"  or
              "postsuper").

       •      New  queue  files  are  created  with  names  such as C3CD21F3E90 from a hexadecimal alphabet that
              contains digits (0-9) and upper-case letters (A-F). The name format is: 5 characters for the  time
              in microseconds; the remainder is the file inode number.

       •      New messages have a Message-ID header with <u>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.queueid</u>@<u>myhostname</u>, where <u>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</u>
              are the year, month, day, hour, minute and second.

       •      The mailq (postqueue -p) output has the same format as with Postfix &lt;= 2.8.

       •      The  hash_queue_depth  algorithm  uses  the  first  characters  of  the  queue file name, with the
              hexadecimal representation of the file creation time in microseconds.

       Before migration to Postfix &lt;= 2.8, the following commands are required to convert long queue file  names
       into short names:

       # postfix stop
       # postconf enable_long_queue_ids=no
       # postsuper

       Repeat the postsuper command until it reports no more queue file name changes.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.9 and later.

</pre><h4><b>enable_original_recipient</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable  support  for  the original recipient address after an address is rewritten to a different address
       (for example with aliasing or with canonical mapping).

       The original recipient address is used as follows:

       Final delivery
              With  "enable_original_recipient  =  yes",  the  original  recipient  address  is  stored  in  the
              <b>X-Original-To</b>  message header. This header may be used to distinguish between different recipients
              that share the same mailbox.

       Recipient deduplication
              With "enable_original_recipient  =  yes",  the  <b><a href="../man8/cleanup.8.html">cleanup</a></b>(8)  daemon  performs  duplicate  recipient
              elimination  based  on  the  content  of  (original  recipient,  maybe-rewritten recipient) pairs.
              Otherwise, the <b><a href="../man8/cleanup.8.html">cleanup</a></b>(8) daemon performs  duplicate  recipient  elimination  based  only  on  the
              maybe-rewritten recipient address.

       Note:  with  Postfix  &lt;= 3.2 the "setting enable_original_recipient = <b>no</b>" breaks address verification for
       addresses that are aliased or otherwise rewritten (Postfix is unable to store  the  address  verification
       result  under  the  original  probe  destination address; instead, it can store the result only under the
       rewritten address).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later. Postfix version 2.0 behaves as if this  parameter  is
       always set to <b>yes</b>.  Postfix versions before 2.0 have no support for the original recipient address.

</pre><h4><b>enable_threaded_bounces</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable  non-delivery,  success,  and delay notifications that link to the original message by including a
       References: and In-Reply-To: header  with  the  original  Message-ID  value.  There  are  advantages  and
       disadvantages to consider.

        <b>advantage</b>
              This allows mail readers to present a delivery status notification in the same email thread as the
              original message.

        <b>disadvantage</b>
              This  makes  it easy for users to mistakenly delete the whole email thread (all related messages),
              instead of deleting only the non-delivery notification.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>error_notice_recipient</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>postmaster)</b></h4><pre>
       The recipient of postmaster notifications about  mail  delivery  problems  that  are  caused  by  policy,
       resource,  software  or  protocol  errors.   These  notifications  are  enabled  with  the notify_classes
       parameter.

</pre><h4><b>error_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>error)</b></h4><pre>
       The name of the <b><a href="../man8/error.8.html">error</a></b>(8) pseudo delivery agent. This service always returns mail as undeliverable.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>execution_directory_expansion_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       Restrict  the  characters  that  the  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)   delivery   agent   allows   in   $name   expansions   of
       $command_execution_directory.  Characters outside the allowed set are replaced by underscores.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>expand_owner_alias</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       When  delivering  to an alias "<u>aliasname</u>" that has an "owner-<u>aliasname</u>" companion alias, set the envelope
       sender address to the expansion of the "owner-<u>aliasname</u>" alias.   Normally,  Postfix  sets  the  envelope
       sender address to the name of the "owner-<u>aliasname</u>" alias.

</pre><h4><b>export_environment</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The  list  of  environment  variables that a Postfix process will export to non-Postfix processes. The TZ
       variable is needed for sane time keeping on System-V-ish systems.

       Specify a list of names and/or name=value pairs, separated by whitespace or comma. Specify "{  name=value
       }"  to  protect  whitespace or comma in parameter values (whitespace after the opening "{" and before the
       closing "}" is ignored). The form name=value is supported with Postfix version 2.1 and later; the use  of
       {} is supported with Postfix 3.0 and later.

       Example:

       export_environment = TZ PATH=<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a>

</pre><h4><b>extract_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>10240)</b></h4><pre>
       The  maximal  number  of  recipient addresses that Postfix will extract from message headers when mail is
       submitted with "<b>sendmail</b> <b>-t</b>".

       This feature was removed in Postfix version 2.1.

</pre><h4><b>fallback_relay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional list of relay hosts for SMTP destinations that can't be found  or  that  are  unreachable.  With
       Postfix 2.3 this parameter is renamed to smtp_fallback_relay.

       By default, mail is returned to the sender when a destination is not found, and delivery is deferred when
       a destination is unreachable.

       The  fallback relays must be SMTP destinations. Specify a domain, host, host:port, [host]:port, [address]
       or [address]:port; the form [host] turns off MX lookups.  If  you  specify  multiple  SMTP  destinations,
       Postfix will try them in the specified order.

       Note:  before  Postfix  2.2,  do  not  use  the fallback_relay feature when relaying mail for a backup or
       primary MX domain. Mail would loop between the Postfix MX host and the fallback_relay host when the final
       destination is unavailable.

       •      In main.cf specify "relay_transport = relay",

       •      In master.cf specify "-o fallback_relay =" (i.e., empty) at the end of the relay entry.

       •      In transport maps, specify "relay:<u>nexthop...</u>"  as the right-hand side for  backup  or  primary  MX
              domain entries.

       Postfix version 2.2 and later will not use the fallback_relay feature for destinations that it is MX host
       for.

</pre><h4><b>fallback_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  message  delivery  transport that the <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) delivery agent should use for names that are not
       found in the <b><a href="../man5/aliases.5.html">aliases</a></b>(5) or UNIX password database.

       The  precedence  of  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)  delivery  features  from  high  to  low  is:  aliases,   .forward   files,
       mailbox_transport_maps,    mailbox_transport,    mailbox_command_maps,   mailbox_command,   home_mailbox,
       mail_spool_directory, fallback_transport_maps, fallback_transport and luser_relay.

</pre><h4><b>fallback_transport_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional lookup tables with per-recipient message delivery transports for recipients  that  the  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)
       delivery agent could not find in the <b><a href="../man5/aliases.5.html">aliases</a></b>(5) or UNIX password database.

       The   precedence   of  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)  delivery  features  from  high  to  low  is:  aliases,  .forward  files,
       mailbox_transport_maps,   mailbox_transport,   mailbox_command_maps,    mailbox_command,    home_mailbox,
       mail_spool_directory, fallback_transport_maps, fallback_transport and luser_relay.

       For safety reasons, this feature does not allow $number substitutions in regular expression maps.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>fast_flush_domains</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$relay_domains)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  list of destinations that are eligible for per-destination logfiles with mail that is queued to
       those destinations.

       By default, Postfix maintains "fast flush" logfiles only for destinations that the Postfix SMTP server is
       willing to relay to (i.e. the default is: "fast_flush_domains = $relay_domains";  see  the  relay_domains
       parameter in the <b><a href="../man5/postconf.5.html">postconf</a></b>(5) manual).

       Specify  a  list  of  hosts or domains, "/file/name" patterns or "type:table" lookup tables, separated by
       commas and/or whitespace.  Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace. A  "/file/name"
       pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when the domain or its parent
       domain appears as lookup key.

       Pattern  matching of domain names is controlled by the presence or absence of "fast_flush_domains" in the
       parent_domain_matches_subdomains parameter value.

       Specify "fast_flush_domains =" (i.e., empty) to disable the feature altogether.

</pre><h4><b>fast_flush_purge_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>7d)</b></h4><pre>
       The time after which an empty per-destination "fast flush" logfile is deleted.

       You can specify the time as a number, or as a number followed by a letter that indicates the  time  unit:
       s=seconds, m=minutes, h=hours, d=days, w=weeks.  The default time unit is days.

</pre><h4><b>fast_flush_refresh_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>12h)</b></h4><pre>
       The  time  after which a non-empty but unread per-destination "fast flush" logfile needs to be refreshed.
       The contents of a logfile are refreshed by requesting delivery of all messages listed in the logfile.

       You can specify the time as a number, or as a number followed by a letter that indicates the  time  unit:
       s=seconds, m=minutes, h=hours, d=days, w=weeks.  The default time unit is hours.

</pre><h4><b>fault_injection_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b></h4><pre>
       Force  specific  internal  tests  to fail, to test the handling of errors that are difficult to reproduce
       otherwise.

</pre><h4><b>flush_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>flush)</b></h4><pre>
       The name of the <b><a href="../man8/flush.8.html">flush</a></b>(8) service. This service maintains per-destination logfiles  with  the  queue  file
       names of mail that is queued for those destinations.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>force_mime_input_conversion</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Convert  body  content  that claims to be 8-bit into quoted-printable, before header_checks, body_checks,
       Milters, and before after-queue content filters. This feature does not affect messages that are sent into
       smtpd_proxy_filter.

       The typical use case is an MTA that applies this conversion before signing outbound messages, so that the
       signatures will remain valid when a message is later delivered to an MTA that does not announce  8BITMIME
       support, or when a message line exceeds the SMTP length limit.

       This feature is available in Postfix &gt;= 3.9.

</pre><h4><b>fork_attempts</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>5)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal number of attempts to fork() a child process.

</pre><h4><b>fork_delay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1s)</b></h4><pre>
       The delay between attempts to fork() a child process.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>forward_expansion_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       Restrict the characters that the <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) delivery agent allows in  $name  expansions  of  $forward_path.
       Characters outside the allowed set are replaced by underscores.

</pre><h4><b>forward_path</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) delivery agent search list for finding a .forward file with user-specified delivery methods.
       The first file that is found is used.

       The  forward_path  value  is not subject to Postfix configuration parameter $name expansion. Instead, the
       following $name expansions are done on forward_path before the search actually happens.   The  result  of
       $name  expansion  is  filtered with the character set that is specified with the forward_expansion_filter
       parameter.

       <b>$user</b>  The recipient's username.

       <b>$shell</b> The recipient's login shell pathname.

       <b>$home</b>  The recipient's home directory.

       <b>$recipient</b>
              The full recipient address.

       <b>$extension</b>
              The optional recipient address extension.

       <b>$domain</b>
              The recipient domain.

       <b>$local</b> The entire recipient localpart.

       <b>$recipient_delimiter</b>
              The address extension delimiter that was found in the recipient address (Postfix 2.11 and  later),
              or  the  'first'  delimiter  specified  with the system-wide recipient address extension delimiter
              (Postfix 3.5.22, 3.6.12, 3.7.8, 3.8.3 and later). Historically, this was  always  the  system-wide
              recipient address extension delimiter (Postfix 2.10 and earlier).

       <b>${name?value}</b>

       <b>${name?{value}}</b> (Postfix &gt;= 3.0)
              Expands to <u>value</u> when <u>$name</u> is non-empty.

       <b>${name:value}</b>

       <b>${name:{value}}</b> (Postfix &gt;= 3.0)
              Expands to <u>value</u> when <u>$name</u> is empty.

       <b>${name?{value1}:{value2}}</b> (Postfix &gt;= 3.0)
              Expands to <u>value1</u> when <u>$name</u> is non-empty, <u>value2</u> otherwise.

       Instead of $name you can also specify ${name} or $(name).

       Examples:

       forward_path = /var/forward/$user
       forward_path =
           /var/forward/$user/.forward$recipient_delimiter$extension,
           /var/forward/$user/.forward

</pre><h4><b>frozen_delivered_to</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Update  the  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)  delivery  agent's idea of the Delivered-To: address (see prepend_delivered_header)
       only once, at the start of a delivery attempt; do not update the Delivered-To:  address  while  expanding
       aliases or .forward files.

       This  feature  is  available in Postfix 2.3 and later. With older Postfix releases, the behavior is as if
       this parameter is set to "no". The old setting can be expensive with deeply nested  aliases  or  .forward
       files.  When  an  alias or .forward file changes the Delivered-To: address, it ties up one queue file and
       one cleanup process instance while mail is being forwarded.

</pre><h4><b>full_name_encoding_charset</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>utf-8)</b></h4><pre>
       The character set name (also called "charset") that Postfix will output when it  automatically  generates
       an  RFC  2047  encoded  full  name. Encoding non-ASCII full names can avoid the need to use SMTPUTF8, and
       therefore can avoid incompatibility with sites that do not support SMTPUTF8.

       The  encoded   names   look   like   "=?charset?q?gibberish?="   with   quoted-printable   encoding,   or
       "=?charset?b?gibberish?="  with  base64  encoding. Postfix uses quoted-printable encoding for a full name
       that is short or mostly printable ASCII, and uses base64 otherwise.

       Background: when a message without a From: header is submitted with the Postfix <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1) command,  the
       Postfix  <b><a href="../man8/cleanup.8.html">cleanup</a></b>(8)  daemon  will add a From: header and will try to use the sender's full name specified
       with the Postfix <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1) "-F" option, with the Postfix <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1) "NAME"  environment  variable,  or
       with  the  GECOS  field  in  the UNIX password database. In the latter case, Postfix will replace the "&amp;"
       character with the login name, with a lowercase ASCII first character converted to uppercase.

       NOTE: Postfix does not convert between character sets. The full_name_encoding_charset parameter specifies
       the character set of the full name in the Postfix sendmail "-F" option, in the  Postfix  sendmail  "NAME"
       environment  variable,  or  in the GECOS field of the UNIX password database. The parameter value is also
       part of the encoded full name, and informs a Mail User Agent how to display the decoded gibberish.

       Specify a valid character set name such as "utf-8" or "iso-8859-1 (specify the latter for full names that
       use the Latin1 encoding).  The character set name is case insensitive. When a character set name violates
       RFC 2047 syntax, Postfix will log a warning and will skip the full name.

       This feature is available in Postfix &gt;= 3.10.

</pre><h4><b>hash_queue_depth</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1)</b></h4><pre>
       The number of subdirectory levels for queue directories listed with the hash_queue_names parameter. Queue
       hashing is implemented  by  creating  one  or  more  levels  of  directories  with  one-character  names.
       Originally,  these  directory  names  were equal to the first characters of the queue file name, with the
       hexadecimal representation of the file creation time in microseconds.

       With long queue file names, queue hashing produces the  same  results  as  with  short  names.  The  file
       creation  time  in  microseconds  is  converted into hexadecimal form before the result is used for queue
       hashing.  The base 16 encoding gives finer control over the number of  subdirectories  than  is  possible
       with the base 52 encoding of long queue file names.

       After changing the hash_queue_names or hash_queue_depth parameter, execute the command "<b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>".

</pre><h4><b>hash_queue_names</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>deferred,</b> <b>defer)</b></h4><pre>
       The names of queue directories that are split across multiple subdirectory levels.

       Before  Postfix  version  2.2,  the  default list of hashed queues was significantly larger. Claims about
       improvements in file system technology suggest that hashing of the  incoming  and  active  queues  is  no
       longer needed. Fewer hashed directories speed up the time needed to restart Postfix.

       After changing the hash_queue_names or hash_queue_depth parameter, execute the command "<b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>".

</pre><h4><b>header_address_token_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>10240)</b></h4><pre>
       The  maximal  number of address tokens are allowed in an address message header. Information that exceeds
       the limit is discarded.  The limit is enforced by the <b><a href="../man8/cleanup.8.html">cleanup</a></b>(8) server.

</pre><h4><b>header_checks</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional lookup tables for content inspection of primary non-MIME message headers, as  specified  in  the
       <b><a href="../man5/header_checks.5.html">header_checks</a></b>(5) manual page.

</pre><h4><b>header_from_format</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>standard)</b></h4><pre>
       The  format  of  the  Postfix-generated  <b>From:</b> header. This setting affects the appearance of 'full name'
       information when a local program such as /bin/mail submits a message without a From: header  through  the
       Postfix <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1) command.

       Specify one of the following:

       <b>standard</b> (default)
              Produce a header formatted as "<b>From:</b> <u>name</u> <b>&lt;</b><u>address</u><b>&gt;</b>".  This is the default as of Postfix 3.3.

       <b>obsolete</b>
              Produce a header formatted as "<b>From:</b> <u>address</u> <b>(</b><u>name</u><b>)</b>". This is the behavior prior to Postfix 3.3.

       Notes:

       •      Postfix  generates the format "<b>From:</b> <u>address</u>" when <u>name</u> information is unavailable or the envelope
              sender address is empty. This is the same behavior as prior to Postfix 3.3.

       •      In the <b>standard</b> form, the <u>name</u> will be quoted if it contains <b>specials</b> as defined in RFC  5322,  or
              the "!%" address operators.

       •      The  Postfix  <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1)  command gets <u>name</u> information from the <b>-F</b> command-line option, from the
              <b>NAME</b> environment variable, or from the UNIX password file.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>header_size_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>102400)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal amount of memory in bytes for storing a message header.  If a header is larger, the excess is
       discarded.  The limit is enforced by the <b><a href="../man8/cleanup.8.html">cleanup</a></b>(8) server.

</pre><h4><b>helpful_warnings</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Log warnings about problematic configuration settings, and provide helpful suggestions.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>home_mailbox</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional pathname of a mailbox file relative to a <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) user's home directory.

       Specify a pathname ending in "/" for qmail-style delivery.

       The  precedence  of  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)  delivery  features  from  high  to  low  is:  aliases,   .forward   files,
       mailbox_transport_maps,    mailbox_transport,    mailbox_command_maps,   mailbox_command,   home_mailbox,
       mail_spool_directory, fallback_transport_maps, fallback_transport and luser_relay.

       Examples:

       home_mailbox = Mailbox
       home_mailbox = Maildir/

</pre><h4><b>hopcount_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>50)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal number of Received:  message headers that is  allowed  in  the  primary  message  headers.  A
       message that exceeds the limit is bounced, in order to stop a mailer loop.

</pre><h4><b>html_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The  location  of  Postfix HTML files that describe how to build, configure or operate a specific Postfix
       subsystem or feature.

</pre><h4><b>ignore_mx_lookup_error</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Ignore DNS MX lookups that produce no response.  By default, the Postfix SMTP client defers delivery  and
       tries again after some delay.  This behavior is required by the SMTP standard.

       Specify  "ignore_mx_lookup_error  =  yes"  to force a DNS A record lookup instead. This violates the SMTP
       standard and can result in mis-delivery of mail.

</pre><h4><b>ignore_srv_lookup_error</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       When SRV record lookup fails, fall back to MX or IP address lookup  as  if  SRV  record  lookup  was  not
       enabled.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.8 and later.

</pre><h4><b>import_environment</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The list of environment variables that a privileged Postfix process will import from a non-Postfix parent
       process,  or  name=value  environment  overrides.   Unprivileged  utilities  will  enforce the name=value
       overrides, but otherwise will not change their process environment.   Examples  of  relevant  environment
       variables:

       <b>TZ</b>     May be needed for sane time keeping on most System-V-ish systems.

       <b>DISPLAY</b>
              Needed for debugging Postfix daemons with an X-windows debugger.

       <b>XAUTHORITY</b>
              Needed for debugging Postfix daemons with an X-windows debugger.

       <b>MAIL_CONFIG</b>
              Needed to make "<b>postfix</b> <b>-c</b>" work.

       <b>POSTLOG_SERVICE</b>
              Needed to make "<b>maillog_file</b>" work during daemon process initialization.

       <b>POSTLOG_HOSTNAME</b>
              Needed to make "<b>maillog_file</b>" work during daemon process initialization.

       Specify  a list of names and/or name=value pairs, separated by whitespace or comma. Specify "{ name=value
       }" to protect whitespace or comma in environment variable values (whitespace after the  opening  "{"  and
       before  the closing "}" is ignored). The form name=value is supported with Postfix version 2.1 and later;
       the use of {} is supported with Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>in_flow_delay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1s)</b></h4><pre>
       Time to pause before accepting a new message, when the message arrival rate exceeds the message  delivery
       rate. This feature is turned on by default (it's disabled on SCO UNIX due to an SCO bug).

       With  the  default  100 Postfix SMTP server process limit, "in_flow_delay = 1s" limits the mail inflow to
       100 messages per second above the number of messages delivered per second.

       Specify 0 to disable the feature. Valid delays are 0..10.

</pre><h4><b>inet_interfaces</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>all)</b></h4><pre>
       The local network interface addresses that this mail system receives mail on. Specify  "all"  to  receive
       mail  on all network interfaces (default), "loopback-only" to receive mail on loopback network interfaces
       only (Postfix version 2.2 and later), or zero or more IPv4  or  IPv6  addresses  (IPv6  is  supported  in
       Postfix  version  2.2  and  later).  The  parameter  also  controls  whether Postfix will accept mail for
       user@[ip.address], and prevents Postfix from delivering mail to a  host  that  has  equal  or  larger  MX
       preference.   Specify an empty value if Postfix does not receive mail over the network, or if all network
       listeners have an explicit IP address in master.cf.

       Note 1: you need to stop and start Postfix when this parameter changes.

       Note 2: address information may be enclosed inside [], but this form is not required here.

       When smtp_bind_address and/or smtp_bind_address6 are  not  specified,  the  inet_interfaces  setting  may
       constrain the source IP address for an outbound SMTP or LMTP connection as described below.

       The  following text is specific to SMTP and IPv4. The same reasoning applies to the IPv6 protocol, and to
       the Postfix LMTP client. To disable IPv4 or IPv6 support  in  the  Postfix  SMTP  and  LMTP  client,  use
       inet_protocols.

       •      When  inet_interfaces  specifies one IPv4 address, and that is not a loopback address, the Postfix
              SMTP client uses that as the source address for outbound IPv4 connections.

       •      Otherwise, the Postfix SMTP client does not constrain the source IPv4 address, and connects  using
              a system-chosen source IPv4 address. This includes the cases where inet_interfaces is empty, where
              it  specifies  <b>all</b>,  or  where  it  contains  no IPv4 address, one IPv4 address that is a loopback
              address, or multiple IPv4 addresses.

       A Postfix SMTP client may fail to reach some remote SMTP servers when the client  source  IP  address  is
       constrained  explicitly with smtp_bind_address or smtp_bind_address6, or implicitly with inet_interfaces.
       This can happen when Postfix runs on a multi-homed system such as a firewall,  the  Postfix  SMTP  source
       client  IP  address  is constrained to one specific network interface, and the remote SMTP server must be
       reached through a different interface. Setting smtp_bind_address to 0.0.0.0 avoids the potential  problem
       for IPv4, and setting smtp_bind_address6 to :: solves the problem for IPv6.

       A  better  solution  for multi-homed systems is to leave inet_interfaces at the default value and instead
       use explicit IP addresses in the master.cf SMTP server definitions.   This  preserves  the  Postfix  SMTP
       client's  loop  detection,  by ensuring that each side of the firewall knows that the other IP address is
       still the same host. Setting $inet_interfaces to a single IPv4 and/or IPV6 address  is  primarily  useful
       with virtual hosting of domains on secondary IP addresses, when each IP address serves a different domain
       (and has a different $myhostname setting).

       See  also the proxy_interfaces parameter, for network addresses that are forwarded to Postfix by way of a
       proxy or address translator.

       Examples:

       inet_interfaces = all (DEFAULT)
       inet_interfaces = loopback-only (Postfix version 2.2 and later)
       inet_interfaces = 127.0.0.1
       inet_interfaces = 127.0.0.1, [::1] (Postfix version 2.2 and later)
       inet_interfaces = 192.168.1.2, 127.0.0.1

</pre><h4><b>inet_protocols</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>'postconf</b> <b>-d'</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The Internet protocols Postfix will attempt to use when making or accepting connections. Specify  one  or
       more of "ipv4" or "ipv6", separated by whitespace or commas. The form "all" is equivalent to "ipv4, ipv6"
       or "ipv4", depending on whether the operating system implements IPv6.

       With  Postfix 2.8 and earlier the default is "ipv4". For backwards compatibility with these releases, the
       Postfix 2.9 and later upgrade procedure appends an explicit "inet_protocols = ipv4"  setting  to  main.cf
       when  no explicit setting is present. This compatibility workaround will be phased out as IPv6 deployment
       becomes more common.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

       Note: you MUST stop and start Postfix after changing this parameter.

       On systems that  pre-date  IPV6_V6ONLY  support  (RFC  3493),  an  IPv6  server  will  also  accept  IPv4
       connections, even when IPv4 is turned off with the inet_protocols parameter.  On systems with IPV6_V6ONLY
       support,  Postfix  will  use  separate  server  sockets  for  IPv6  and  IPv4,  and each will accept only
       connections for the corresponding protocol.

       When IPv4 support is enabled via the inet_protocols parameter, Postfix will look up DNS type  A  records,
       and will convert IPv4-in-IPv6 client IP addresses (::ffff:1.2.3.4) to their original IPv4 form (1.2.3.4).
       The latter is needed on hosts that pre-date IPV6_V6ONLY support (RFC 3493).

       When  IPv6  support  is  enabled  via  the inet_protocols parameter, Postfix will do DNS type AAAA record
       lookups.

       When both IPv4 and IPv6 support are enabled,  the  Postfix  SMTP  client  will  choose  the  protocol  as
       specified  with the smtp_address_preference parameter. Postfix versions before 2.8 attempt to connect via
       IPv6 before attempting to use IPv4.

       Examples:

       inet_protocols = ipv4
       inet_protocols = all (DEFAULT)
       inet_protocols = ipv6
       inet_protocols = ipv4, ipv6

</pre><h4><b>info_log_address_format</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>external)</b></h4><pre>
       The email address form that will be used in non-debug logging (info, warning, etc.). As  of  Postfix  3.5
       when  an address localpart contains spaces or other special characters, the localpart will be quoted, for
       example:

               from=&lt;"name with spaces"@example.com&gt;

       Older Postfix versions would log the internal (unquoted) form:

               from=&lt;name with <a href="mailto:spaces@example.com">spaces@example.com</a>&gt;

       The external and internal forms are identical for the vast majority of email addresses  that  contain  no
       spaces or other special characters in the localpart.

       The  logging  in  external form is consistent with the address form that Postfix 3.2 and later prefer for
       most table lookups. This is therefore the more useful form for non-debug logging.

       Specify "<b>info_log_address_format</b> <b>=</b> <b>internal</b>" for backwards compatibility.

       Postfix uses the unquoted form internally, because an attacker can specify an email address in  different
       forms  by  playing games with quotes and backslashes. An attacker should not be able to use such games to
       circumvent Postfix access policies.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.5 and later.

</pre><h4><b>initial_destination_concurrency</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>5)</b></h4><pre>
       The initial per-destination concurrency level for  parallel  delivery  to  the  same  destination.   With
       per-destination recipient limit &gt; 1, a destination is a domain, otherwise it is a recipient.

       Use  <u>transport</u>_initial_destination_concurrency  to specify a transport-specific override, where <u>transport</u>
       is the master.cf name of the message delivery transport (Postfix 2.5 and later).

       Warning: with concurrency of 1, one bad message can be enough to block all mail to a site.

</pre><h4><b>internal_mail_filter_classes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       What  categories  of  Postfix-generated  mail  are  subject  to  before-queue   content   inspection   by
       non_smtpd_milters,  header_checks  and  body_checks.  Specify zero or more of the following, separated by
       whitespace or comma.

       <b>bounce</b> Inspect the content of delivery status notifications.

       <b>notify</b> Inspect the content of postmaster notifications by the <b><a href="../man8/smtp.8.html">smtp</a></b>(8) and <b><a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html">smtpd</a></b>(8) processes.

       NOTE: It's generally not safe to enable content inspection of Postfix-generated email messages. The  user
       is warned.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>invalid_hostname_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>501)</b></h4><pre>
       The  numerical  Postfix  SMTP  server  response  code  when  the client HELO or EHLO command parameter is
       rejected by the reject_invalid_helo_hostname restriction.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 5321.

</pre><h4><b>ipc_idle</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>version</b> <b>dependent)</b></h4><pre>
       The time after which a client closes an idle internal communication channel.  The  purpose  is  to  allow
       Postfix  daemon  processes to terminate voluntarily after they become idle. This is used, for example, by
       the Postfix address resolving and rewriting clients.

       With Postfix 2.4 the default value was reduced from 100s to 5s.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>ipc_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3600s)</b></h4><pre>
       The  time limit for sending or receiving information over an internal communication channel.  The purpose
       is to break out of deadlock situations. If the time limit is exceeded the software aborts  with  a  fatal
       error.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>ipc_ttl</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000s)</b></h4><pre>
       The time after which a client closes an active internal communication channel.  The purpose is  to  allow

       lmtp_connection_cache_on_demand, lmtp_connection_cache_destinations, or lmtp_connection_reuse_time_limit.

       The  effectiveness  of cached connections will be determined by the number of remote LMTP servers in use,
       and the concurrency limit specified for the Postfix LMTP client. Cached connections are closed under  any
       of the following conditions:

</pre><h4><b>lmtp_sasl_security_options</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>noplaintext,</b> <b>noanonymous)</b></h4><pre>
       SASL  security  options;  as  of  Postfix  2.3  the list of available features depends on the SASL client
       implementation that is selected with <b>lmtp_sasl_type</b>.

       The following security features are defined for the <b>cyrus</b> client SASL implementation:

       <b>noplaintext</b>
              Disallow authentication methods that use plaintext passwords.

       <b>noactive</b>
              Disallow authentication methods that are vulnerable to non-dictionary active attacks.

       <b>nodictionary</b>
              Disallow authentication methods that are vulnerable to passive dictionary attacks.

       <b>noanonymous</b>
              Disallow anonymous logins.

       Example:

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>lmtp_xforward_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b></h4><pre>
       The  Postfix  LMTP  client time limit for sending the XFORWARD command, and for receiving the remote LMTP
       server response.

       In case of problems the client does NOT try the next address on the mail exchanger list.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>local_command_shell</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  shell  program for <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) delivery to non-Postfix commands.  By default, non-Postfix commands
       are executed directly; commands are given to the  default  shell  (typically,  <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>)  only  when  they
       contain shell meta characters or shell built-in commands.

       "sendmail's restricted shell" (smrsh) is what most people will use in order to restrict what programs can
       be run from e.g. .forward files (smrsh is part of the Sendmail distribution).

       Note:  when  a shell program is specified, it is invoked even when the command contains no shell built-in
       commands or meta characters.

       Example:

       local_command_shell = /some/where/smrsh -c
       local_command_shell = <a href="file:/bin/bash">/bin/bash</a> -c

</pre><h4><b>local_delivery_status_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_delivery_status_filter)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional filter for the <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) delivery agent  to  change  the  status  code  or  explanatory  text  of
       successful or unsuccessful deliveries.  See default_delivery_status_filter for details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>local_destination_concurrency_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>2)</b></h4><pre>
       The  maximal  number  of  parallel deliveries via the local mail delivery transport to the same recipient
       (when "local_destination_recipient_limit = 1") or the maximal number of parallel deliveries to  the  same
       local domain (when "local_destination_recipient_limit &gt; 1"). This limit is enforced by the queue manager.
       The message delivery transport name is the first field in the entry in the master.cf file.

       A  low  limit of 2 is recommended, just in case someone has an expensive shell command in a .forward file
       or in an alias (e.g., a mailing list manager).  You don't want to run lots of those at the same time.

</pre><h4><b>local_destination_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal number of recipients per message delivery via the local mail delivery transport.  This  limit
       is  enforced by the queue manager. The message delivery transport name is the first field in the entry in
       the master.cf file.

       Setting this parameter to a value &gt; 1 changes the  meaning  of  local_destination_concurrency_limit  from
       concurrency per recipient into concurrency per domain.

</pre><h4><b>local_header_rewrite_clients</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>permit_inet_interfaces)</b></h4><pre>
       Rewrite  or add message headers in mail from these clients, updating incomplete addresses with the domain
       name in $myorigin or $mydomain, and adding missing headers.

       See the append_at_myorigin and append_dot_mydomain  parameters  for  details  of  how  domain  names  are
       appended to incomplete addresses.

       See remote_header_rewrite_domain to optionally rewrite or add message headers in mail from other clients.

       Specify a list of zero or more of the following:

       <b>permit_inet_interfaces</b>
              Append   the   domain  name  in  $myorigin  or  $mydomain  when  the  client  IP  address  matches
              $inet_interfaces. This is enabled by default.

       <b>permit_mynetworks</b>
              Append the domain name in $myorigin or $mydomain when the client IP address matches any network or
              network address listed in $mynetworks. This setting will not prevent remote  mail  header  address
              rewriting when mail from a remote client is forwarded by a neighboring system.

       <b>permit_sasl_authenticated</b>
              Append the domain name in $myorigin or $mydomain when the client is successfully authenticated via
              the RFC 4954 (AUTH) protocol.

       <b>permit_tls_clientcerts</b>
              Append  the  domain  name  in  $myorigin  or $mydomain when the remote SMTP client TLS certificate
              fingerprint or public key fingerprint (Postfix 2.9 and later)  is  listed  in  $relay_clientcerts.
              The  fingerprint  digest  algorithm is configurable via the smtpd_tls_fingerprint_digest parameter
              (hard-coded as md5 prior to Postfix version 2.5).
              The default algorithm is <b>sha256</b> with Postfix &gt;= 3.6 and the  <b>compatibility_level</b>  set  to  3.6  or
              higher.  With  Postfix  &lt;=  3.5, the default algorithm is <b>md5</b>.  The best-practice algorithm is now
              <b>sha256</b>. Recent advances in hash function cryptanalysis have led to md5 and sha1  being  deprecated
              in favor of sha256.  However, as long as there are no known "second pre-image" attacks against the
              older algorithms, their use in this context, though not recommended, is still likely safe.

       <b>permit_tls_all_clientcerts</b>
              Append  the  domain  name in $myorigin or $mydomain when the remote SMTP client TLS certificate is
              successfully verified, regardless of whether it is listed on the server,  and  regardless  of  the
              certifying authority.

       <b>check_address_map</b> <u>type:table</u>

       <u>type:table</u>
              Append  the domain name in $myorigin or $mydomain when the client IP address matches the specified
              lookup table.  The lookup result is ignored, and no subnet lookup is done. This is  suitable  for,
              e.g., pop-before-smtp lookup tables.

       Examples:

       The  Postfix &lt; 2.2 backwards compatible setting: always rewrite message headers, and always append my own
       domain to incomplete header addresses.

           local_header_rewrite_clients = static:all

       The purist (and default) setting: rewrite headers only in mail from Postfix sendmail  and  in  SMTP  mail
       from this machine.

           local_header_rewrite_clients = permit_inet_interfaces

       The  intermediate  setting:  rewrite  header addresses and append $myorigin or $mydomain information only
       with mail from Postfix sendmail, from local clients, or from authorized SMTP clients.

       Note: this setting will not prevent remote mail header address rewriting when mail from a  remote  client
       is forwarded by a neighboring system.

           local_header_rewrite_clients = permit_mynetworks,
               permit_sasl_authenticated permit_tls_clientcerts
               check_address_map hash:/etc/postfix/pop-before-smtp

</pre><h4><b>local_login_sender_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>static:*)</b></h4><pre>
       A  list  of  lookup  tables  that  are searched by the UNIX login name, and that return a list of allowed
       envelope sender patterns separated by space or comma. These sender patterns are enforced by  the  Postfix
       <b><a href="../man1/postdrop.1.html">postdrop</a></b>(1)  command.  The  default  is  backwards-compatible: every user may specify any sender envelope
       address.

       When no UNIX login name is available, the <b><a href="../man1/postdrop.1.html">postdrop</a></b>(1) command will prepend "<b>uid:</b>" to  the  numerical  UID
       and use that instead.

       This feature ignores address extensions in the user-specified envelope sender address.

       Note:  to  enforce that the From: header address matches the envelope sender (MAIL FROM) address, specify
       an  external  filter  such  as  a  Milter,   with   the   non_smtpd_milters   parameter.   For   example:
       https://github.com/magcks/milterfrom.

       The following sender patterns are special; these cannot be used as part of a longer pattern.

        <b>*</b>     This pattern allows any envelope sender address.

        <b>&lt;&gt;</b>    This     pattern     allows     the     empty     envelope     sender     address.     See     the
              empty_address_local_login_sender_maps_lookup_key configuration parameter.

        <b>@</b><u>domain</u>
              This pattern allows an envelope sender address when the '<b>@</b>' and <u>domain</u> part match.

       Examples:

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           # Allow root and postfix full control, anyone else can only
           # send mail as themselves. Use "uid:" followed by the numerical
           # UID when the UID has no entry in the UNIX password file.
           local_login_sender_maps =
               inline:{ { root = * }, { postfix = * } },

           /(.+)/ $1 $<a href="mailto:1@example.com">1@example.com</a>

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>local_recipient_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>proxy:unix:passwd.byname</b> <b>$alias_maps)</b></h4><pre>
       Lookup tables with all names or addresses of valid local recipients. A recipient address  is  local  when
       its domain matches $mydestination, $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces.

       If  the  local_recipient_maps  parameter  value  is non-empty (the default), then the Postfix SMTP server
       queries local_recipient_maps as specified in "Local recipient table query format", and rejects  mail  for
       unknown  local  recipients.  Other  Postfix  interfaces such as the Postfix <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1) command may still
       accept an "unknown" recipient.

       The default local_recipient_maps setting  assumes  that  local_transport  specifies  the  UNIX-compatible
       <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)  delivery  agent  which  queries the UNIX passwd database (typically, /etc.passwd) and the local
       aliases database (typically, /etc/aliases). The proxy: agent allows the Postfix SMTP server to access the
       UNIX passwd database from outside a chroot jail.

       For other local mail delivery configurations, see  "When you  need  to  change  the  local_recipient_maps
       setting in main.cf".

       Technically, tables listed with $local_recipient_maps are used as lists: The Postfix SMTP server needs to
       know only if a lookup string is found or not, but it does not use the result from table lookup.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.

       To  turn  off local recipient checking in the Postfix SMTP server, specify "local_recipient_maps =" (i.e.
       empty).

       Examples:

       local_recipient_maps =

</pre><h4><b>local_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>local:$myhostname)</b></h4><pre>
       The default mail delivery transport and next-hop destination for final delivery to  domains  listed  with
       mydestination,  and  for [ipaddress] destinations that match $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces.  This
       information can be overruled with the <b><a href="../man5/transport.5.html">transport</a></b>(5) table.

       By default, local mail is delivered to the transport called "local", which is just the name of a  service
       that is defined the master.cf file.

       Specify  a string of the form <u>transport:nexthop</u>, where <u>transport</u> is the name of a mail delivery transport
       defined in master.cf.  The <u>:nexthop</u> destination is optional; its syntax is documented in the manual  page
       of the corresponding delivery agent.

       Beware:   if   you   override   the   default   local   delivery  agent  then  you  need  to  review  the
       LOCAL_RECIPIENT_README document, otherwise the SMTP server may reject mail for local recipients.

</pre><h4><b>luser_relay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional catch-all destination for unknown <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) recipients.  By default, mail for unknown  recipients
       in domains that match $mydestination, $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces is returned as undeliverable.

       The  luser_relay  value  is  not subject to Postfix configuration parameter $name expansion. Instead, the
       following $name expansions are done:

       <b>$domain</b>
              The recipient domain.

       <b>$extension</b>
              The recipient address extension.

       <b>$home</b>  The recipient's home directory.

       <b>$local</b> The entire recipient address localpart.

       <b>$recipient</b>
              The full recipient address.

       <b>$recipient_delimiter</b>
              The address extension delimiter that was found in the recipient address (Postfix 2.11 and  later),
              or the system-wide recipient address extension delimiter (Postfix 2.10 and earlier).

       <b>$shell</b> The recipient's login shell.

       <b>$user</b>  The recipient username.

       <b>${name?value}</b>

       <b>${name?{value}}</b> (Postfix &gt;= 3.0)
              Expands to <u>value</u> when <u>$name</u> is non-empty.

       <b>${name:value}</b>

       <b>${name:{value}}</b> (Postfix &gt;= 3.0)
              Expands to <u>value</u> when <u>$name</u> is empty.

       <b>${name?{value1}:{value2}}</b> (Postfix &gt;= 3.0)
              Expands to <u>value1</u> when <u>$name</u> is non-empty, <u>value2</u> otherwise.

       Instead of $name you can also specify ${name} or $(name).

       Note: luser_relay works only for the Postfix <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) delivery agent.

       Note:  if  you  use  this  feature  for  accounts  not  in  the UNIX password file, then you must specify
       "local_recipient_maps =" (i.e. empty) in the main.cf file, otherwise the Postfix SMTP server will  reject
       mail for non-UNIX accounts with "User unknown in local recipient table".

       Examples:

       luser_relay = $<a href="mailto:user@other.host">user@other.host</a>
       luser_relay = $<a href="mailto:local@other.host">local@other.host</a>
       luser_relay = admin+$local

</pre><h4><b>mail_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>Postfix)</b></h4><pre>
       The  mail system name that is displayed in Received: headers, in the SMTP greeting banner, and in bounced
       mail.

</pre><h4><b>mail_owner</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>postfix)</b></h4><pre>
       The UNIX system account that owns the Postfix queue and most Postfix daemon processes.  Specify the  name
       of an unprivileged user account that does not share a user or group ID with other accounts, and that owns
       no  other files or processes on the system.  In particular, don't specify nobody or daemon.  PLEASE USE A
       DEDICATED USER ID AND GROUP ID.

       When this parameter value is changed you need to re-run "<b>postfix</b> <b>set-permissions</b>" (with  Postfix  version
       2.0 and earlier: "<b>/etc/postfix/post-install</b> <b>set-permissions</b>".

</pre><h4><b>mail_release_date</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The Postfix release date, in "YYYYMMDD" format.

</pre><h4><b>mail_spool_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The  directory  where  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)  UNIX-style mailboxes are kept. The default setting depends on the system
       type. Specify a name ending in / for maildir-style delivery.

       Note: maildir delivery is done with the privileges of the recipient.  If you use the mail_spool_directory
       setting for maildir style delivery, then you must create the  top-level  maildir  directory  in  advance.
       Postfix will not create it.

       Examples:

       mail_spool_directory = <a href="file:/var/mail">/var/mail</a>
       mail_spool_directory = <a href="file:/var/spool/mail">/var/spool/mail</a>

</pre><h4><b>mail_version</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The  version  of the mail system. Stable releases are named <u>major</u>.<u>minor</u>.<u>patchlevel</u>. Experimental releases
       also include the release date. The version string can be used in, for example, the SMTP greeting banner.

</pre><h4><b>mailbox_command</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional external command that the <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) delivery agent should use for mailbox delivery.  The  command
       is  run  with  the  user  ID  and  the  primary group ID privileges of the recipient.  Exception: command
       delivery for root executes with $default_privs privileges.  This is not a problem, because  1)  mail  for
       root should always be aliased to a real user and 2) don't log in as root, use "su" instead.

       The following environment variables are exported to the command:

       <b>CLIENT_ADDRESS</b>
              Remote client network address. Available in Postfix version 2.2 and later.

       <b>CLIENT_HELO</b>
              Remote client EHLO command parameter. Available in Postfix version 2.2 and later.

       <b>CLIENT_HOSTNAME</b>
              Remote client hostname. Available in Postfix version 2.2 and later.

       <b>CLIENT_PROTOCOL</b>
              Remote client protocol. Available in Postfix version 2.2 and later.

       <b>DOMAIN</b> The domain part of the recipient address.

       <b>ENVID</b>  The optional RFC 3461 envelope ID. Available in Postfix version 3.9 and later

       <b>EXTENSION</b>
              The optional address extension.

       <b>HOME</b>   The recipient home directory.

       <b>LOCAL</b>  The recipient address localpart.

       <b>LOGNAME</b>
              The recipient's username.

       <b>ORIGINAL_RECIPIENT</b>
              The entire recipient address, before any address rewriting or aliasing.

       <b>RECIPIENT</b>
              The full recipient address.

       <b>SASL_METHOD</b>
              SASL  authentication  method  specified  in  the  remote client AUTH command. Available in Postfix
              version 2.2 and later.

       <b>SASL_SENDER</b>
              SASL sender address specified in the remote client MAIL FROM command. Available in Postfix version
              2.2 and later.

       <b>SASL_USER</b>
              SASL username specified in the remote client AUTH command.  Available in Postfix version  2.2  and
              later.

       <b>SENDER</b> The full sender address.

       <b>SHELL</b>  The recipient's login shell.

       <b>USER</b>   The recipient username.

       Unlike  other  Postfix  configuration parameters, the mailbox_command parameter is not subjected to $name
       substitutions. This is to make it easier to specify shell syntax (see example below).

       If you can, avoid shell meta characters because they  will  force  Postfix  to  run  an  expensive  shell
       process.  If  you're delivering via "procmail" then running a shell won't make a noticeable difference in
       the total cost.

       Note: if you use the mailbox_command feature to deliver mail system-wide, you must set up an  alias  that
       forwards mail for root to a real user.

       The   precedence   of  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)  delivery  features  from  high  to  low  is:  aliases,  .forward  files,
       mailbox_transport_maps,   mailbox_transport,   mailbox_command_maps,    mailbox_command,    home_mailbox,
       mail_spool_directory, fallback_transport_maps, fallback_transport and luser_relay.

       Examples:

       mailbox_command = /some/where/procmail

       mailbox_command = /some/where/maildrop -d "$USER"
               -f "$SENDER" "$EXTENSION"

</pre><h4><b>mailbox_command_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  lookup  tables  with  per-recipient  external  commands  to  use for <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) mailbox delivery.
       Behavior is as with mailbox_command.

       The  precedence  of  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)  delivery  features  from  high  to  low  is:  aliases,   .forward   files,

       mail_spool_directory, fallback_transport_maps, fallback_transport and luser_relay.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.

</pre><h4><b>mailbox_delivery_lock</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       How to lock a UNIX-style <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) mailbox before attempting delivery.   For  a  list  of  available  file
       locking methods, use the "<b>postconf</b> <b>-l</b>" command.

       This  setting  is  ignored with <b>maildir</b> style delivery, because such deliveries are safe without explicit
       locks.

       Note: The <b>dotlock</b> method requires that the recipient UID or GID has write access to the parent  directory
       of the mailbox file.

       Note: the default setting of this parameter is system dependent.

</pre><h4><b>mailbox_size_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>51200000)</b></h4><pre>
       The  maximal  size of any <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) individual mailbox or maildir file, or zero (no limit).  In fact, this
       limits the size of any file that is written to upon local delivery, including files written  by  external
       commands that are executed by the <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) delivery agent. The value cannot exceed LONG_MAX (typically, a
       32-bit or 64-bit signed integer).

       This limit must not be smaller than the message size limit.

</pre><h4><b>mailbox_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  message  delivery transport that the <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) delivery agent should use for mailbox delivery to
       all local recipients, whether or not they are found in the UNIX passwd database.

       The  precedence  of  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)  delivery  features  from  high  to  low  is:  aliases,   .forward   files,
       mailbox_transport_maps,    mailbox_transport,    mailbox_command_maps,   mailbox_command,   home_mailbox,
       mail_spool_directory, fallback_transport_maps, fallback_transport and luser_relay.

</pre><h4><b>mailbox_transport_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional lookup tables with per-recipient  message  delivery  transports  to  use  for  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)  mailbox
       delivery, whether or not the recipients are found in the UNIX passwd database.

       The   precedence   of  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)  delivery  features  from  high  to  low  is:  aliases,  .forward  files,

       mail_spool_directory, fallback_transport_maps, fallback_transport and luser_relay.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.

       For safety reasons, this feature does not allow $number substitutions in regular expression maps.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>maillog_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       The  name  of  an  optional  logfile  that  is written by the Postfix <b><a href="../man8/postlogd.8.html">postlogd</a></b>(8) service. An empty value
       selects logging to <b><a href="../man8/syslogd.8.html">syslogd</a></b>(8).  Specify "/dev/stdout"  to  select  logging  to  standard  output.  Stdout
       logging requires that Postfix is started with "postfix start-fg".

       Note   1:   The  maillog_file  parameter  value  must  contain  a  prefix  that  is  specified  with  the
       maillog_file_prefixes parameter.

       Note 2: Some Postfix non-daemon programs may still  log  information  to  <b><a href="../man8/syslogd.8.html">syslogd</a></b>(8),  before  they  have
       processed their configuration parameters and command-line options.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.4 and later.

</pre><h4><b>maillog_file_compressor</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>gzip)</b></h4><pre>
       The  program  to  run  after rotating $maillog_file with "postfix logrotate". The command is run with the
       rotated logfile name as its first argument.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.4 and later.

</pre><h4><b>maillog_file_permissions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0600)</b></h4><pre>
       The file access permissions that will be set when the file $maillog_file is created for the  first  time,
       or  when  the  file  is  created after an existing file is rotated. Specify one of: <b>0600</b> (only super-user
       read/write access), <b>0640</b> (adds 'group' read access), or <b>0644</b> (also adds 'other' read access). The leading
       '0' is optional.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.9 and later.

</pre><h4><b>maillog_file_prefixes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b><a href="file:/var">/var</a>,</b> <b>/dev/stdout)</b></h4><pre>
       A list of allowed prefixes for a maillog_file value. This is a safety feature to contain the damage  from
       a single configuration mistake. Specify one or more prefix strings, separated by comma or whitespace.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.4 and later.

</pre><h4><b>maillog_file_rotate_suffix</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)</b></h4><pre>
       The format of the suffix to append to $maillog_file while rotating the file with "postfix logrotate". See
       <b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></b>(3) for syntax. The default suffix, YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS, allows logs to be rotated frequently.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.4 and later.

</pre><h4><b>mailq_path</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       Sendmail  compatibility  feature  that  specifies  where  the Postfix <b><a href="../man1/mailq.1.html">mailq</a></b>(1) command is installed. This
       command can be used to list the Postfix mail queue.

</pre><h4><b>manpage_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       Where the Postfix manual pages are installed.

</pre><h4><b>maps_rbl_domains</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Obsolete feature: use the reject_rbl_client feature instead.

</pre><h4><b>maps_rbl_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>554)</b></h4><pre>
       The numerical Postfix SMTP server response code when a remote SMTP  client  request  is  blocked  by  the
       reject_rbl_client,     reject_rhsbl_client,     reject_rhsbl_reverse_client,    reject_rhsbl_sender    or
       reject_rhsbl_recipient restriction.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 5321.

</pre><h4><b>masquerade_classes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>envelope_sender,</b> <b>header_sender,</b> <b>header_recipient)</b></h4><pre>
       What addresses are subject to address masquerading.

       By default, address masquerading is limited to envelope sender addresses, and to header sender and header
       recipient addresses.  This allows you to use address masquerading on a mail  gateway  while  still  being
       able to forward mail to users on individual machines.

       Specify zero or more of: envelope_sender, envelope_recipient, header_sender, header_recipient

</pre><h4><b>masquerade_domains</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional list of domains whose subdomain structure will be stripped off in email addresses.

       The list is processed left to right, and processing stops at the first match.  Thus,

           masquerade_domains = foo.example.com example.com

       strips       "<a href="mailto:user@any.thing.foo.example.com">user@any.thing.foo.example.com</a>"       to       "<a href="mailto:user@foo.example.com">user@foo.example.com</a>",      but      strips
       "<a href="mailto:user@any.thing.else.example.com">user@any.thing.else.example.com</a>" to "<a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a>".

       A domain name prefixed with ! means do not masquerade this domain or its subdomains. Thus,

           masquerade_domains = !foo.example.com example.com

       does   not   change    "<a href="mailto:user@any.thing.foo.example.com">user@any.thing.foo.example.com</a>"    or    "<a href="mailto:user@foo.example.com">user@foo.example.com</a>",    but    strips
       "<a href="mailto:user@any.thing.else.example.com">user@any.thing.else.example.com</a>" to "<a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a>".

       Note:  with  Postfix  version  2.2,  message header address masquerading happens only when message header
       address rewriting is enabled:

       •      The message is received with the Postfix <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1) command,

       •      The message is received from a network client that matches $local_header_rewrite_clients,

       •      The message is received from the network, and the remote_header_rewrite_domain parameter specifies
              a non-empty value.

       To get the behavior before Postfix version 2.2, specify "local_header_rewrite_clients = static:all".

       Example:

       masquerade_domains = $mydomain

</pre><h4><b>masquerade_exceptions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional list of user names that are not subjected to address masquerading,  even  when  their  addresses
       match $masquerade_domains.

       By default, address masquerading makes no exceptions.

       Specify  a  list  of  user  names,  "/file/name"  or  "type:table"  patterns,  separated by commas and/or
       whitespace. The list is matched left to right, and the search stops on the first  match.  A  "/file/name"
       pattern  is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a name matches a lookup
       key (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by  starting  the  next  line  with  whitespace.
       Specify  "!pattern"  to exclude a name from the list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix
       version 2.4 and later.

       Examples:

       masquerade_exceptions = root, mailer-daemon
       masquerade_exceptions = root

</pre><h4><b>master_service_disable</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Selectively disable <b><a href="../man8/master.8.html">master</a></b>(8) listener ports by service type or by service name and type.  Specify a list
       of service types ("inet", "unix", "fifo", or "pass") or "name/type" tuples, where  "name"  is  the  first
       field of a master.cf entry and "type" is a service type. As with other Postfix matchlists, a search stops
       at  the  first  match.   Specify "!pattern" to exclude a service from the list. By default, all <b><a href="../man8/master.8.html">master</a></b>(8)
       listener ports are enabled.

       Note: this feature does not support "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns, nor does it support  wildcards
       such as "*" or "all". This is intentional.

       Examples:

       # With Postfix 2.6..2.10 use '.' instead of '/'.
       # Turn on all <b><a href="../man8/master.8.html">master</a></b>(8) listener ports (the default).
       master_service_disable =
       # Turn off only the main SMTP listener port.
       master_service_disable = smtp/inet
       # Turn off all TCP/IP listener ports.
       master_service_disable = inet
       # Turn off all TCP/IP listener ports except "foo".
       master_service_disable = !foo/inet, inet

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>max_idle</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100s)</b></h4><pre>
       The  maximum  amount  of time that an idle Postfix daemon process waits for an incoming connection before
       terminating voluntarily.  This parameter is ignored by the Postfix queue manager and by other  long-lived
       Postfix daemon processes.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>max_use</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal number of incoming connections that a Postfix daemon process will service before  terminating
       voluntarily.   This  parameter  is  ignored  by the Postfix queue manager and by other long-lived Postfix
       daemon processes.

</pre><h4><b>maximal_backoff_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>4000s)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal time between attempts to deliver a deferred message.

       This parameter should be set to a  value  greater  than  or  equal  to  $minimal_backoff_time.  See  also
       $queue_run_delay.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>maximal_queue_lifetime</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>5d)</b></h4><pre>
       Consider a message as undeliverable, when delivery fails with a temporary error,  and  the  time  in  the

       Specify  a  non-negative  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies
       the time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time
       unit is d (days).

       Specify 0 when mail delivery should be tried only once.

</pre><h4><b>message_drop_headers</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>bcc,</b> <b>content-length,</b> <b>resent-bcc,</b> <b>return-path)</b></h4><pre>
       Names  of  message  headers  that  the  <b><a href="../man8/cleanup.8.html">cleanup</a></b>(8) daemon will remove after applying <b><a href="../man5/header_checks.5.html">header_checks</a></b>(5) and
       before invoking Milter applications.  The default setting is compatible with Postfix &lt; 3.0.

       Specify a list of header names, separated by comma or space.  Names are  matched  in  a  case-insensitive
       manner.  The list of supported header names is limited only by available memory.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>message_reject_characters</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>

       recognized: \a \b \f \n \r \t \v \<u>ddd</u> (up to three octal digits) and \\.

       Note  1:  this  feature  does  not  recognize  text  that requires MIME decoding. It inspects raw message
       content, just like header_checks and body_checks.

       Note 2: this feature is disabled with "receive_override_options = no_header_body_checks".

       Example:

       message_reject_characters = \0

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>message_size_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>10240000)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal size in bytes of a message, including envelope information.  The value cannot exceed LONG_MAX
       (typically, a 32-bit or 64-bit signed integer).

       Note: be careful when making changes.  Excessively small values will result in the loss  of  non-delivery
       notifications, when a bounce message size exceeds the local or remote MTA's message size limit.

</pre><h4><b>message_strip_characters</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       The  set  of characters that Postfix will remove from message content.  The usual C-like escape sequences
       are recognized: \a \b \f \n \r \t \v \<u>ddd</u> (up to three octal digits) and \\.

       Note 1: this feature does not recognize text  that  requires  MIME  decoding.  It  inspects  raw  message
       content, just like header_checks and body_checks.

       Note 2: this feature is disabled with "receive_override_options = no_header_body_checks".

       Example:

       message_strip_characters = \0

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

       postfix-files, dynamicmaps.cf, and the multi-instance template files main.cf.proto  and  master.cf.proto.
       This  directory  should  contain only Postfix-related files.  Typically, the meta_directory parameter has
       the same default as the config_directory parameter (/etc/postfix or /usr/local/etc/postfix).

       For backwards compatibility with Postfix versions 2.6..2.11, specify "meta_directory = $daemon_directory"
       in main.cf before installing or upgrading Postfix, or specify "meta_directory = /path/name" on the  "make
       makefiles", "make install" or "make upgrade" command line.

       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>milter_data_macros</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The  macros  that  are  sent to version 4 or higher Milter (mail filter) applications after the SMTP DATA
       command. See MILTER_README for a list of available macro names and their meanings.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>milter_default_action</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>tempfail)</b></h4><pre>
       The default action when a Milter  (mail  filter)  response  is  unavailable  (for  example,  bad  Postfix

       tempfail
              Reject all further commands in this session with a temporary status code.

       quarantine
              Like "accept", but freeze the message in the "hold" queue. Available with Postfix 2.6 and later.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>milter_end_of_data_macros</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The  macros  that  are  sent  to  Milter  (mail  filter)  applications after the message end-of-data. See
       MILTER_README for a list of available macro names and their meanings.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>milter_end_of_header_macros</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The macros that are sent to Milter (mail filter) applications after the end of the  message  header.  See

       Optional  lookup  tables  for  content  inspection  of  message  headers  that  are  produced  by  Milter
       applications.  See the  <b><a href="../man5/header_checks.5.html">header_checks</a></b>(5)  manual  page  available  actions.  Currently,  PREPEND  is  not
       implemented.

       The following example sends all mail that is marked as SPAM to a spam handling machine. Note that matches
       are case-insensitive by default.

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           milter_header_checks = pcre:/etc/postfix/milter_header_checks

       /etc/postfix/milter_header_checks:
           /^X-SPAM-FLAG:\s+YES/ FILTER mysmtp:sanitizer.example.com:25

       The  milter_header_checks  mechanism could also be used for allowlisting. For example it could be used to
       skip heavy content inspection for DKIM-signed mail from known friendly domains.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.7, and as an optional patch for Postfix 2.6.

</pre><h4><b>milter_macro_defaults</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional list of <u>name=value</u> pairs that specify default values for arbitrary macros that Postfix may  send
       to  Milter  applications.   These  defaults  are used when there is no corresponding information from the
       message delivery context.

       Specify <u>name=value</u> or <u>{name=value}</u> pairs separated by comma or whitespace.  Enclose a pair in "{}" when a
       value contains comma or whitespace (this form ignores whitespace after the enclosing "{", around the "=",
       and before the enclosing "}").

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>milter_macro_v</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$mail_name</b> <b>$mail_version)</b></h4><pre>
       The {v} macro value for Milter (mail filter) applications.  See MILTER_README for  a  list  of  available

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>milter_protocol</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>6)</b></h4><pre>
       The mail filter protocol version and  optional  protocol  extensions  for  communication  with  a  Milter
       application; prior to Postfix 2.6 the default protocol is 2. Postfix sends this version number during the
       initial  protocol  handshake.   It  should  match  the version number that is expected by the mail filter
       application (or by its Milter library).

       Protocol versions:

       2      Use Sendmail 8 mail filter protocol version 2 (default with Sendmail  version  8.11  ..  8.13  and
              Postfix version 2.3 ..  2.5).

       3      Use Sendmail 8 mail filter protocol version 3.

       4      Use Sendmail 8 mail filter protocol version 4.

       6      Use  Sendmail  8  mail  filter  protocol version 6 (default with Sendmail version 8.14 and Postfix

       The macros that are sent to Milter (mail filter)  applications  after  the  SMTP  RCPT  TO  command.  See
       MILTER_README for a list of available macro names and their meanings.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>milter_unknown_command_macros</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The  macros  that are sent to version 3 or higher Milter (mail filter) applications after an unknown SMTP
       command.  See MILTER_README for a list of available macro names and their meanings.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>mime_boundary_length_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>2048)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal length of MIME multipart boundary strings.  The  MIME  processor  is  unable  to  distinguish
       between boundary strings that do not differ in the first $mime_boundary_length_limit characters.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>mime_header_checks</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$header_checks)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  lookup  tables  for  content  inspection  of  MIME related message headers, as described in the
       <b><a href="../man5/header_checks.5.html">header_checks</a></b>(5) manual page.

</pre><h4><b>mime_nesting_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal recursion level that the MIME processor will handle.  Postfix refuses  mail  that  is  nested
       deeper than the specified limit.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>minimal_backoff_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b></h4><pre>
       The  minimal  time between attempts to deliver a deferred message; prior to Postfix 2.4 the default value
       was 1000s.

       This parameter also limits the time an unreachable destination is  kept  in  the  short-term,  in-memory,
       destination status cache.

       This parameter should be set greater than or equal to $queue_run_delay. See also $maximal_backoff_time.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>multi_instance_directories</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       An optional list of non-default Postfix configuration directories; these directories belong to additional
       Postfix instances that share the Postfix executable files and  documentation  with  the  default  Postfix
       instance,  and  that  are  started, stopped, etc., together with the default Postfix instance.  Specify a
       list of pathnames separated by comma or whitespace.

       When $multi_instance_directories is empty, the  <b><a href="../man1/postfix.1.html">postfix</a></b>(1)  command  runs  in  single-instance  mode  and
       operates on a single Postfix instance only. Otherwise, the <b><a href="../man1/postfix.1.html">postfix</a></b>(1) command runs in multi-instance mode
       and  invokes  the  multi-instance  manager  specified  with  the  multi_instance_wrapper  parameter.  The
       multi-instance manager in turn executes <b><a href="../man1/postfix.1.html">postfix</a></b>(1) commands for the default instance and for all  Postfix
       instances in $multi_instance_directories.

       Currently, this parameter setting is ignored except for the default main.cf file.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>multi_instance_enable</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Allow  this  Postfix instance to be started, stopped, etc., by a multi-instance manager.  By default, new
       instances are created in a safe  state  that  prevents  them  from  being  started  inadvertently.   This
       parameter is reserved for the multi-instance manager.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>multi_instance_group</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       The  optional  instance  group  name of this Postfix instance. A group identifies closely-related Postfix
       instances that the multi-instance manager can start, stop, etc., as a unit.  This parameter  is  reserved
       for the multi-instance manager.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>multi_instance_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       The  optional  instance  name  of this Postfix instance. This name becomes also the default value for the
       syslog_name parameter.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>multi_instance_wrapper</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       The pathname  of  a  multi-instance  manager  command  that  the  <b><a href="../man1/postfix.1.html">postfix</a></b>(1)  command  invokes  when  the
       multi_instance_directories  parameter value is non-empty. The pathname may be followed by initial command
       arguments separated by whitespace; shell metacharacters such as quotes are not supported in this context.

       The <b><a href="../man1/postfix.1.html">postfix</a></b>(1) command invokes the manager command with the <b><a href="../man1/postfix.1.html">postfix</a></b>(1) non-option  command  arguments  on
       the  manager  command  line, and with all installation configuration parameters exported into the manager
       command process environment. The manager command in turn invokes the <b><a href="../man1/postfix.1.html">postfix</a></b>(1)  command  for  individual
       Postfix instances as "postfix -c <u>config_directory</u> <u>command</u>".

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>multi_recipient_bounce_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>550)</b></h4><pre>
       The  numerical  Postfix  SMTP  server  response  code when a remote SMTP client request is blocked by the
       reject_multi_recipient_bounce restriction.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 5321.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>mydestination</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$myhostname,</b> <b>localhost.$mydomain,</b> <b>localhost)</b></h4><pre>
       The list of domains that are delivered via the $local_transport mail delivery transport. By default  this
       is the Postfix <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) delivery agent which looks up all recipients in <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> and /etc/aliases. The
       SMTP server validates recipient addresses with $local_recipient_maps and rejects non-existent recipients.
       See also the local domain class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file.

       The  default  mydestination  value specifies names for the local machine only.  On a mail domain gateway,
       you should also include $mydomain.

       The $local_transport delivery method is also selected for mail addressed  to  user@[the.net.work.address]
       of the mail system (the IP addresses specified with the inet_interfaces and proxy_interfaces parameters).

       Warnings:

       •      Do  not  specify  the  names  of  virtual  domains  -  those  domains are specified elsewhere. See
              VIRTUAL_README for more information.

       •      Do  not  specify  the  names  of  domains  that  this  machine  is  backup  MX   host   for.   See
              STANDARD_CONFIGURATION_README for how to set up backup MX hosts.

       •      By   default,   the  Postfix  SMTP  server  rejects  mail  for  recipients  not  listed  with  the
              local_recipient_maps  parameter.   See  the  <b><a href="../man5/postconf.5.html">postconf</a></b>(5)  manual  for   a   description   of   the
              local_recipient_maps and unknown_local_recipient_reject_code parameters.

       Specify a list of host or domain names, "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns, separated by commas and/or
       whitespace.  A  "/file/name"  pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched
       when a name matches a lookup key (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long  lines  by  starting  the
       next line with whitespace.

       Examples:

       mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain $mydomain
       mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain www.$mydomain, ftp.$mydomain

</pre><h4><b>mydomain</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The  internet  domain  name  of  this  mail  system.   The  default is to use $myhostname minus the first
       component, or "localdomain" (Postfix 2.3 and later).  $mydomain is used as a default value for many other
       configuration parameters.

       Example:

       mydomain = domain.tld

</pre><h4><b>myhostname</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The internet hostname of this mail system. The default is to use the fully-qualified domain  name  (FQDN)
       from  gethostname(),  or  to  use  the  non-FQDN  result  from  gethostname()  and  append  ".$mydomain".
       $myhostname is used as a default value for many other configuration parameters.

       Example:

       myhostname = host.example.com

</pre><h4><b>mynetworks</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The list of "trusted" remote SMTP clients that have more privileges than "strangers".

       In  particular,  "trusted"  SMTP  clients  are  allowed  to  relay  mail  through   Postfix.    See   the
       smtpd_relay_restrictions parameter description in the <b><a href="../man5/postconf.5.html">postconf</a></b>(5) manual.

       You  can  specify  the  list  of "trusted" network addresses by hand or you can let Postfix do it for you
       (which is the default).  See the description of the mynetworks_style parameter for more information.

       If you specify the mynetworks list by hand, Postfix ignores the mynetworks_style setting.

       Specify a list of network addresses or network/netmask patterns, separated by commas  and/or  whitespace.
       Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace.

       The  netmask  specifies  the  number of bits in the network part of a host address.  You can also specify
       "/file/name"  or  "type:table"  patterns.   A  "/file/name"  pattern  is  replaced  by  its  contents;  a
       "type:table"  lookup  table  is  matched when a table entry matches a lookup string (the lookup result is
       ignored).

       The list is matched left to right, and the search stops  on  the  first  match.   Specify  "!pattern"  to
       exclude  an  address  or network block from the list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix
       version 2.4 and later.

       Note 1: Pattern matching of domain names is controlled by the presence or absence of "mynetworks" in  the
       parent_domain_matches_subdomains parameter value.

       Note  2:  IP  version  6  address information must be specified inside [] in the mynetworks value, and in
       files specified with "/file/name".  IP version 6 addresses contain the ":" character, and would otherwise
       be confused with a "type:table" pattern.

       Note 3: CIDR ranges cannot be specified in hash tables.  Use cidr tables if CIDR ranges are used.

       Examples:

       mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 168.100.189.0/28
       mynetworks = !192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.0/28
       mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 168.100.189.0/28 [::1]/128 [2001:240:587::]/64
       mynetworks = $config_directory/mynetworks
       mynetworks = hash:/etc/postfix/network_table
       mynetworks = cidr:/etc/postfix/network_table.cidr

</pre><h4><b>mynetworks_style</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>Postfix</b> <b>&gt;=</b> <b>3.0:</b> <b>host,</b> <b>Postfix</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>3.0:</b> <b>subnet)</b></h4><pre>
       The method to generate the default value for the mynetworks parameter.   This  is  the  list  of  trusted
       networks for relay access control etc.

       •      Specify "mynetworks_style = host" when Postfix should "trust" only the local machine.

       •      Specify "mynetworks_style = subnet" when Postfix should "trust" remote SMTP clients in the same IP
              subnetworks  as  the local machine.  On Linux, this works correctly only with interfaces specified
              with the "ifconfig" or "ip" command.

       •      Specify "mynetworks_style = class" when Postfix should "trust" remote SMTP clients in the same  IP
              class A/B/C networks as the local machine.  Caution: this may cause Postfix to "trust" your entire
              provider's  network.   Instead, specify an explicit mynetworks list by hand, as described with the
              mynetworks configuration parameter.

</pre><h4><b>myorigin</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$myhostname)</b></h4><pre>
       The domain name that locally-posted mail appears to come from, and that locally posted mail is  delivered
       to.  The  default, $myhostname, is adequate for small sites.  If you run a domain with multiple machines,
       you should (1) change this to $mydomain and (2) set up a domain-wide alias  database  that  aliases  each
       user to <a href="mailto:user@that.users.mailhost">user@that.users.mailhost</a>.

       Example:

       myorigin = $mydomain

</pre><h4><b>nested_header_checks</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$header_checks)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  lookup  tables  for  content  inspection  of  non-MIME message headers in attached messages, as
       described in the <b><a href="../man5/header_checks.5.html">header_checks</a></b>(5) manual page.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>newaliases_path</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       Sendmail compatibility feature that specifies the location of the <b><a href="../man1/newaliases.1.html">newaliases</a></b>(1) command. This command can
       be used to rebuild the <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) <b><a href="../man5/aliases.5.html">aliases</a></b>(5) database.

</pre><h4><b>non_fqdn_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>504)</b></h4><pre>
       The  numerical  Postfix  SMTP  server  reply  code  when  a   client   request   is   rejected   by   the
       reject_non_fqdn_helo_hostname, reject_non_fqdn_sender or reject_non_fqdn_recipient restriction.

</pre><h4><b>non_smtpd_milters</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       A  list  of  Milter (mail filter) applications for new mail that does not arrive via the Postfix <b><a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html">smtpd</a></b>(8)
       server. This includes local submission via the <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1) command line, new mail that  arrives  via  the
       Postfix  <b><a href="../man8/qmqpd.8.html">qmqpd</a></b>(8)  server,  and old mail that is re-injected into the queue with "postsuper -r".  Specify
       space or comma as a separator. See the MILTER_README document for details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>notify_classes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>resource,</b> <b>software)</b></h4><pre>
       The list of error classes that are reported to the postmaster.  These  postmaster  notifications  do  not
       replace  user  notifications.  The  default is to report only the most serious problems. The paranoid may
       wish to turn on the policy (UCE and mail relaying) and protocol error (broken mail software) reports.

       NOTE: postmaster notifications may contain confidential information such as  SASL  passwords  or  message
       content.  It is the system administrator's responsibility to treat such information with care.

       The error classes are:

       <b>bounce</b> (also implies <b>2bounce</b>)
              Send  the  postmaster copies of the headers of bounced mail, and send transcripts of SMTP sessions
              when  Postfix  rejects  mail.  The  notification  is  sent  to  the  address  specified  with  the
              bounce_notice_recipient configuration parameter (default: postmaster).

       <b>2bounce</b>
              Send  undeliverable  bounced  mail  to  the  postmaster.  The  notification is sent to the address
              specified with the 2bounce_notice_recipient configuration parameter (default: postmaster).

       <b>data</b>   Send the postmaster a transcript of the SMTP session with an error because a  critical  data  file
              was unavailable. The notification is sent to the address specified with the error_notice_recipient
              configuration parameter (default: postmaster).
              This feature is available in Postfix 2.9 and later.

       <b>delay</b>  Send  the  postmaster  copies  of  the  headers  of  delayed  mail  (see  delay_warning_time). The
              notification is sent to  the  address  specified  with  the  delay_notice_recipient  configuration
              parameter (default: postmaster).

       <b>policy</b> Send the postmaster a transcript of the SMTP session when a client request was rejected because of
              (UCE)  policy.  The  notification is sent to the address specified with the error_notice_recipient
              configuration parameter (default: postmaster).

       <b>protocol</b>
              Send the postmaster a transcript of the SMTP session in case of client or server protocol  errors.
              The  notification  is  sent to the address specified with the error_notice_recipient configuration
              parameter (default: postmaster).

       <b>resource</b>
              Inform the postmaster of mail not delivered due to resource problems.  The notification is sent to
              the  address  specified  with  the  error_notice_recipient   configuration   parameter   (default:
              postmaster).

       <b>software</b>
              Inform the postmaster of mail not delivered due to software problems.  The notification is sent to
              the   address   specified   with  the  error_notice_recipient  configuration  parameter  (default:
              postmaster).

       Examples:

       notify_classes = bounce, delay, policy, protocol, resource, software
       notify_classes = 2bounce, resource, software

</pre><h4><b>openssl_path</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>openssl)</b></h4><pre>
       The location of the OpenSSL command line program <b><a href="../man1/openssl.1.html">openssl</a></b>(1).  This is used by the "<b>postfix</b>  <b>tls</b>"  command
       to create private keys, certificate signing requests, self-signed certificates, and to compute public key
       digests  for DANE TLSA records.  In multi-instance environments, this parameter is always determined from
       the configuration of the default Postfix instance.

       Example:

           /etc/postfix/main.cf:
               # NetBSD pkgsrc:
               openssl_path = /usr/pkg/bin/openssl
               # Local build:
               openssl_path = /usr/local/bin/openssl

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>owner_request_special</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable  special  treatment  for  owner-<u>listname</u>  entries  in  the  <b><a href="../man5/aliases.5.html">aliases</a></b>(5)  file,  and   don't   split
       owner-<u>listname</u>  and <u>listname</u>-request address localparts when the recipient_delimiter is set to "-".  This
       feature is useful for mailing lists.

</pre><h4><b>parent_domain_matches_subdomains</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       A list of Postfix features where the  pattern  "example.com"  also  matches  subdomains  of  example.com,
       instead  of  requiring  an  explicit  ".example.com"  pattern.   This is planned backwards compatibility:
       eventually, all Postfix features are expected to require explicit ".example.com" style patterns when  you
       really want to match subdomains.

       The following Postfix feature names are supported.

       Postfix version 1.0 and later
              debug_peer_list,   fast_flush_domains,   mynetworks,   permit_mx_backup_networks,   relay_domains,
              transport_maps

       Postfix version 1.1 and later
              qmqpd_authorized_clients, smtpd_access_maps,

       Postfix version 2.8 and later
              postscreen_access_list

       Postfix version 3.0 and later
              smtpd_client_event_limit_exceptions

</pre><h4><b>permit_mx_backup_networks</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Restrict the use of the permit_mx_backup SMTP access feature to only domains whose primary MX hosts match
       the listed networks.  The parameter value syntax is the same as  with  the  mynetworks  parameter;  note,
       however, that the default value is empty.

       Pattern  matching of domain names is controlled by the presence or absence of "permit_mx_backup_networks"
       in the parent_domain_matches_subdomains parameter value.

</pre><h4><b>pickup_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>pickup)</b></h4><pre>
       The name of the <b><a href="../man8/pickup.8.html">pickup</a></b>(8) service. This service picks up local mail submissions from the Postfix maildrop
       queue.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>pipe_delivery_status_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_delivery_status_filter)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional filter for the <b><a href="../man8/pipe.8.html">pipe</a></b>(8) delivery agent to change the delivery status code or explanatory text  of
       successful or unsuccessful deliveries.  See default_delivery_status_filter for details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>plaintext_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>450)</b></h4><pre>
       The   numerical   Postfix   SMTP   server   response   code   when   a   request   is   rejected  by  the
       <b>reject_plaintext_session</b> restriction.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>postlog_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>postlog)</b></h4><pre>
       The name of the <b><a href="../man8/postlogd.8.html">postlogd</a></b>(8) service entry in master.cf.  This service appends logfile records to the file
       specified with the maillog_file parameter.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.4 and later.

</pre><h4><b>postlogd_watchdog_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>10s)</b></h4><pre>
       How much time a <b><a href="../man8/postlogd.8.html">postlogd</a></b>(8) process may take to process a request before it is terminated by  a  built-in
       watchdog  timer. This is a safety mechanism that prevents <b><a href="../man8/postlogd.8.html">postlogd</a></b>(8) from becoming non-responsive due to
       a bug in Postfix itself or in system software. This limit cannot be set under 10s.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.4 and later.

</pre><h4><b>postmulti_control_commands</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>reload</b> <b>flush)</b></h4><pre>
       The <b><a href="../man1/postfix.1.html">postfix</a></b>(1) commands that the <b><a href="../man1/postmulti.1.html">postmulti</a></b>(1) instance manager treats as "control" commands, that operate
       on running instances. For these commands, disabled instances are skipped.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>postmulti_start_commands</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>start)</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b><a href="../man1/postfix.1.html">postfix</a></b>(1)  commands  that  the  <b><a href="../man1/postmulti.1.html">postmulti</a></b>(1) instance manager treats as "start" commands. For these
       commands, disabled instances are "checked" rather  than  "started",  and  failure  to  "start"  a  member
       instance of an instance group will abort the start-up of later instances.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>postmulti_stop_commands</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b><a href="../man1/postfix.1.html">postfix</a></b>(1)  commands  that  the  <b><a href="../man1/postmulti.1.html">postmulti</a></b>(1)  instance manager treats as "stop" commands. For these
       commands, disabled instances are skipped, and enabled instances are processed in reverse order.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_access_list</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>permit_mynetworks)</b></h4><pre>
       Permanent allow/denylist  for  remote  SMTP  client  IP  addresses.   <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8)  searches  this  list
       immediately  after  a  remote  SMTP  client  connects.   Specify a comma- or whitespace-separated list of
       commands (in upper or lower case) or lookup tables. The search stops upon the first  command  that  fires
       for the client IP address.

        <b>permit_mynetworks</b>
              Allowlist  the  client  and terminate the search if the client IP address matches $mynetworks.  Do
              not subject the client to any before/after 220 greeting tests.  Pass the connection immediately to
              a Postfix SMTP server process.
              Pattern  matching  of   domain   names   is   controlled   by   the   presence   or   absence   of
              "postscreen_access_list" in the parent_domain_matches_subdomains parameter value.

        <b>type:table</b>
              Query  the  specified lookup table. Each table lookup result is an access list, except that access
              lists inside a table cannot specify type:table entries.
              To discourage the use of hash, btree, etc. tables, there is no support for substring matching like
              <b><a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html">smtpd</a></b>(8). Use CIDR tables instead.

        <b>permit</b>
              Allowlist the client and terminate the search. Do not subject the client to any  before/after  220
              greeting tests. Pass the connection immediately to a Postfix SMTP server process.

        <b>reject</b>
              Denylist the client and terminate the search. Subject the client to the action configured with the
              postscreen_denylist_action configuration parameter.

        <b>dunno</b> All <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) access lists implicitly have this command at the end.
              When   <b>dunno</b> is executed inside a lookup table, return from the lookup table and evaluate the next
              command.
              When  <b>dunno</b>  is executed outside a lookup table, terminate the search, and subject the  client  to
              the configured before/after 220 greeting tests.

       Example:

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           postscreen_access_list = permit_mynetworks,
               cidr:/etc/postfix/postscreen_access.cidr
           # Postfix &lt; 3.6 use postscreen_blacklist_action.
           postscreen_denylist_action = enforce

       /etc/postfix/postscreen_access.cidr:
           # Rules are evaluated in the order as specified.
           # Denylist 192.168.* except 192.168.0.1.
           192.168.0.1         dunno
           192.168.0.0/16      reject

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_allowlist_interfaces</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>static:all)</b></h4><pre>
       A  list  of local <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) server IP addresses where a non-allowlisted remote SMTP client can obtain
       <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8)'s temporary allowlist status. This status is required before  the  client  can  talk  to  a
       Postfix  SMTP  server  process.   By default, a client can obtain <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8)'s allowlist status on any
       local <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) server IP address.

       When <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) listens on both primary and backup MX addresses,  the  postscreen_allowlist_interfaces
       parameter  can  be  configured  to  give  the temporary allowlist status only when a client connects to a
       primary MX address. Once a client is allowlisted it can talk to a Postfix SMTP  server  on  any  address.
       Thus,  clients  that connect only to backup MX addresses will never become allowlisted, and will never be
       allowed to talk to a Postfix SMTP server process.

       Specify a list of network addresses or network/netmask patterns, separated by commas  and/or  whitespace.
       The  netmask  specifies  the number of bits in the network part of a host address. Continue long lines by
       starting the next line with whitespace.

       You can also specify "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns.  A "/file/name" pattern is  replaced  by  its
       contents;  a  "type:table" lookup table is matched when a table entry matches a lookup string (the lookup
       result is ignored).

       The list is matched left to right, and the search stops on the first match. Specify "!pattern" to exclude
       an address or network block from the list.

       Note: IP version 6 address information must be specified inside [] in the postscreen_allowlist_interfaces
       value, and in files specified with "/file/name".  IP version 6 addresses contain the ":"  character,  and
       would otherwise be confused with a "type:table" pattern.

       Example:

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           # Don't allowlist connections to the backup IP address.
           # Postfix &lt; 3.6 use postscreen_whitelist_interfaces.
           postscreen_allowlist_interfaces = !168.100.189.8, static:all

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.6 and later.

       Available as postscreen_whitelist_interfaces in Postfix 2.9 - 3.5.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_bare_newline_action</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>ignore)</b></h4><pre>
       The  action that <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) takes when a remote SMTP client sends a bare newline character, that is, a
       newline not preceded by carriage return.  Specify one of the following:

       <b>ignore</b> Ignore the failure of this test. Allow other tests to complete.  Do <u>not</u> repeat  this  test  before
              the  result  from  some  other  test  expires.   This  option is useful for testing and collecting
              statistics without blocking mail permanently.

       <b>enforce</b>
              Allow other tests to complete. Reject attempts to deliver mail with a 550 SMTP reply, and log  the
              helo/sender/recipient information.  Repeat this test the next time the client connects.

       <b>drop</b>   Drop  the  connection immediately with a 521 SMTP reply. Repeat this test the next time the client
              connects.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_bare_newline_enable</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable "bare newline" SMTP protocol tests in the <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8)  server.  These  tests  are  expensive:  a
       remote  SMTP  client  must disconnect after it passes the test, before it can talk to a real Postfix SMTP
       server.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_bare_newline_ttl</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>30d)</b></h4><pre>
       The amount of time that <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) remembers that a client IP address passed  a  "bare  newline"  SMTP
       protocol  test,  before  it  address  is  required to pass that test again. The default is long because a
       remote SMTP client must disconnect after it passes the test, before it can talk to a  real  Postfix  SMTP
       server.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is d (days).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_blacklist_action</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>ignore)</b></h4><pre>
       Renamed to postscreen_denylist_action in Postfix 3.6.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 - 3.5.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_cache_cleanup_interval</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>12h)</b></h4><pre>
       The amount of time between <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) cache cleanup runs.  Cache cleanup increases  the  load  on  the
       cache  database and should therefore not be run frequently. This feature requires that the cache database
       supports the "delete" and "sequence" operators.  Specify a zero interval to disable cache cleanup.

       After each cache cleanup run, the <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) daemon logs the number of entries that were retained  and
       dropped.  A  cleanup  run is logged as "partial" when the daemon terminates early after "<b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>",
       "<b>postfix</b> <b>stop</b>", or no requests for $max_idle seconds.

       Specify a non-negative time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter  suffix  that  specifies
       the  time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time
       unit is h (hours).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_cache_map</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>btree:$data_directory/postscreen_cache)</b></h4><pre>
       Persistent storage for the <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) server decisions.

       To share a <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) cache between multiple  <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8)  instances,  use  "postscreen_cache_map  =
       proxy:btree:/path/to/file".    This   requires   Postfix   version  2.9  or  later;  earlier  <b><a href="../man8/proxymap.8.html">proxymap</a></b>(8)
       implementations don't support cache cleanup.  For  an  alternative  approach  see  the  <b><a href="../man5/memcache_table.5.html">memcache_table</a></b>(5)
       manpage.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_cache_retention_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>7d)</b></h4><pre>
       The  amount  of  time  that  <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8)  will  cache an expired temporary allowlist entry before it is
       removed. This prevents clients from being logged as "NEW" just because their cache entry expired an  hour
       ago. It also prevents the cache from filling up with clients that passed some deep protocol test once and
       never came back.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is d (days).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_client_connection_count_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtpd_client_connection_count_limit)</b></h4><pre>
       How many simultaneous connections any remote SMTP client  is  allowed  to  have  with  the  <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8)
       daemon.  By default, this limit is the same as with the Postfix SMTP server. Note that the triage process
       can take several seconds, with the time spent in postscreen_greet_wait delay, and  with  the  time  spent
       talking to the <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) built-in dummy SMTP protocol engine.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_command_count_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>20)</b></h4><pre>
       The  limit  on  the  total number of commands per SMTP session for <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8)'s built-in SMTP protocol
       engine.  This SMTP engine defers or rejects all attempts to deliver mail, therefore there is no  need  to
       enforce separate limits on the number of junk commands and error commands.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_command_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtpd_command_filter)</b></h4><pre>
       A  mechanism  to  transform  commands  from  remote  SMTP  clients.  See smtpd_command_filter for further
       details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 and later.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_command_time_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>normal:</b> <b>300s,</b> <b>overload:</b> <b>10s)</b></h4><pre>
       The time limit to read an entire command line with <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8)'s built-in SMTP protocol engine.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_denylist_action</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>ignore)</b></h4><pre>
       The action that <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) takes when  a  remote  SMTP  client  is  permanently  denylisted  with  the
       postscreen_access_list parameter.  Specify one of the following:

       <b>ignore</b> (default)
              Ignore   this  result.  Allow  other tests to complete.  Repeat this test the next time the client
              connects.  This option is useful for testing and collecting statistics without blocking mail.

       <b>enforce</b>
              Allow other tests to complete. Reject attempts to deliver mail with a 550 SMTP reply, and log  the
              helo/sender/recipient information.  Repeat this test the next time the client connects.

       <b>drop</b>   Drop  the  connection immediately with a 521 SMTP reply. Repeat this test the next time the client
              connects.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.6 and later.

       Available as postscreen_blacklist_action in Postfix 2.8 - 3.5.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_disable_vrfy_command</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$disable_vrfy_command)</b></h4><pre>
       Disable the SMTP VRFY command in the <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) daemon.  See disable_vrfy_command for details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtpd_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps)</b></h4><pre>
       Lookup tables, indexed by the remote SMTP client address, with case insensitive lists  of  EHLO  keywords
       (pipelining,  starttls, auth, etc.) that the <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) server will not send in the EHLO response to a
       remote SMTP client. See smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords for details.  The table is not searched  by  hostname
       for robustness reasons.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 and later.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_discard_ehlo_keywords</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords)</b></h4><pre>
       A case insensitive list of EHLO keywords (pipelining, starttls, auth, etc.) that the <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) server
       will not send in the EHLO response to a remote SMTP client. See smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords for details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 and later.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_dnsbl_action</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>ignore)</b></h4><pre>
       The  action  that  <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8)  takes  when  a remote SMTP client's combined DNSBL score is equal to or
       greater than a threshold (as  defined  with  the  postscreen_dnsbl_sites  and  postscreen_dnsbl_threshold
       parameters).  Specify one of the following:

       <b>ignore</b> (default)
              Ignore  the  failure  of this test. Allow other tests to complete.  Repeat this test the next time
              the client connects.  This option is useful for testing and collecting statistics without blocking
              mail.

       <b>enforce</b>
              Allow other tests to complete. Reject attempts to deliver mail with a 550 SMTP reply, and log  the
              helo/sender/recipient information.  Repeat this test the next time the client connects.

       <b>drop</b>   Drop  the  connection immediately with a 521 SMTP reply. Repeat this test the next time the client
              connects.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_dnsbl_allowlist_threshold</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b></h4><pre>
       Allow a remote SMTP client to skip "before" and  "after  220  greeting"  protocol  tests,  based  on  its
       combined DNSBL score as defined with the postscreen_dnsbl_sites parameter.

       Specify    a    negative    value    to    enable    this    feature.    When   a   client   passes   the
       postscreen_dnsbl_allowlist_threshold without having failed other tests, all pending or disabled tests are
       flagged as completed with an expiration time based on the  DNS  reply  TTL.   When  a  test  was  already
       completed,  its  expiration time is updated if it was less than the value based on the DNS reply TTL. See
       also postscreen_dnsbl_max_ttl and postscreen_dnsbl_min_ttl.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.6 and later.

       Available as postscreen_dnsbl_whitelist_threshold in Postfix 2.11 - 3.5.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_dnsbl_max_ttl</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>${postscreen_dnsbl_ttl?{$postscreen_dnsbl_ttl}:{1}}h)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximum amount of time that <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) remembers that a  client  IP  address  passed  a  DNS-based
       reputation  test, before it is required to pass that test again. If the DNS reply specifies a shorter TTL
       value, that value will be used unless it would be smaller than postscreen_dnsbl_min_ttl.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is h (hours).

       This  feature is available in Postfix 3.1. The default setting is backwards-compatible with older Postfix
       versions.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_dnsbl_min_ttl</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>60s)</b></h4><pre>
       The minimum amount of time that <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) remembers that a  client  IP  address  passed  a  DNS-based
       reputation  test,  before it is required to pass that test again. If the DNS reply specifies a larger TTL
       value, that value will be used unless it would be larger than postscreen_dnsbl_max_ttl.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.1.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_dnsbl_reply_map</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       A  mapping  from  an  actual DNSBL domain name which includes a secret password, to the DNSBL domain name
       that postscreen will reply with when it rejects mail.  When no mapping is found, the actual DNSBL  domain
       will be used.

       For  maximal  stability  it  is  best  to  use  a file that is read into memory such as pcre:, regexp: or
       texthash: (texthash: is similar to hash:, except a) there is no need to run <b><a href="../man1/postmap.1.html">postmap</a></b>(1)  before  the  file
       can be used, and b) texthash: does not detect changes after the file is read).

       Example:

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           postscreen_dnsbl_reply_map = texthash:/etc/postfix/dnsbl_reply

       /etc/postfix/dnsbl_reply:
          secret.zen.spamhaus.org      zen.spamhaus.org

       NOTE:  This  feature  differs  from  the Postfix SMTP server's rbl_reply_maps feature, where 1) the table
       search key includes the optional "<u>=address-filter</u>", and where 2) the lookup  result  contains  free  text
       with <u>$name</u> variables.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_dnsbl_sites</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  list  of patterns with DNS allow/denylist domains, filters and weight factors. When the list is
       non-empty, the <b><a href="../man8/dnsblog.8.html">dnsblog</a></b>(8) daemon will query these domains with the reversed IP addresses of  remote  SMTP
       clients,  and  <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8)  will  update  an  SMTP  client's  DNSBL  score with each non-error reply as
       described below.

       Caution: when postscreen rejects mail, its  SMTP  response  contains  the  DNSBL  domain  name.  Use  the
       postscreen_dnsbl_reply_map feature to hide "password" information in DNSBL domain names.

       When    a   client's   score   is   equal   to   or   greater   than   the   threshold   specified   with
       postscreen_dnsbl_threshold, <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) can drop the connection with the remote SMTP client.

       Specify a list of domain=filter*weight patterns, separated by comma or whitespace.

       •      When a pattern specifies no "=filter", <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) will use any non-error  DNSBL  query  result.
              Otherwise,  <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8)  will use only DNSBL query results that match the filter. The filter has
              the form d.d.d.d, where each d is a number, or a pattern inside  []  that  contains  one  or  more
              ";"-separated numbers or number..number ranges.

       •      When a pattern specifies no "*weight", the weight of the pattern is 1.  Otherwise, the weight must
              be an integral number.  Specify a negative number for allowlisting.

       •      When  a  pattern matches one or more DNSBL query results, <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) adds that pattern's weight
              once to the remote SMTP client's DNSBL score.

       Examples:

       To use example.com as a high-confidence blocklist, and to block mail  with  example.net  and  example.org
       only when both agree:

       postscreen_dnsbl_threshold = 2
       postscreen_dnsbl_sites = example.com*2, example.net, example.org

       To filter only DNSBL replies containing 127.0.0.4:

       postscreen_dnsbl_sites = example.com=127.0.0.4

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_dnsbl_threshold</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1)</b></h4><pre>
       The inclusive lower bound for blocking a remote SMTP client, based on its combined DNSBL score as defined
       with the postscreen_dnsbl_sites parameter.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_dnsbl_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>10s)</b></h4><pre>
       The  time  limit  for DNSBL or DNSWL lookups. This is separate from the timeouts in the <b><a href="../man8/dnsblog.8.html">dnsblog</a></b>(8) daemon
       which are defined by system <b><a href="../man3/resolver.3.html">resolver</a></b>(3) routines.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_dnsbl_ttl</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1h)</b></h4><pre>
       The  amount  of  time that <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) remembers that a client IP address passed a DNS-based reputation
       test, before it is required to pass that test again.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is h (hours).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8-3.0. It was replaced by postscreen_dnsbl_max_ttl in Postfix 3.1.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_dnsbl_whitelist_threshold</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b></h4><pre>
       Renamed to postscreen_dnsbl_allowlist_threshold in Postfix 3.6.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.11 - 3.5.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_enforce_tls</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtpd_enforce_tls)</b></h4><pre>
       Mandatory  TLS:  announce  STARTTLS  support  to  remote  SMTP  clients, and require that clients use TLS
       encryption.  See smtpd_postscreen_enforce_tls for details.

       This feature is available in  Postfix  2.8  and  later.   Preferably,  use  postscreen_tls_security_level
       instead.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_expansion_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       List   of   characters   that  are  permitted  in  postscreen_reject_footer  attribute  expansions.   See
       smtpd_expansion_filter for further details.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_forbidden_commands</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtpd_forbidden_commands)</b></h4><pre>
       List of commands that the  <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8)  server  considers  in  violation  of  the  SMTP  protocol.  See
       smtpd_forbidden_commands for syntax, and postscreen_non_smtp_command_action for possible actions.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_greet_action</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>ignore)</b></h4><pre>
       The  action  that  <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8)  takes  when a remote SMTP client speaks before its turn within the time
       specified with the postscreen_greet_wait parameter.  Specify one of the following:

       <b>ignore</b> (default)
              Ignore the failure of this test. Allow other tests to complete.  Repeat this test  the  next  time
              the client connects.  This option is useful for testing and collecting statistics without blocking
              mail.

       <b>enforce</b>
              Allow  other tests to complete. Reject attempts to deliver mail with a 550 SMTP reply, and log the
              helo/sender/recipient information.  Repeat this test the next time the client connects.

       <b>drop</b>   Drop the connection immediately with a 521 SMTP reply. Repeat this test the next time  the  client
              connects.

       In either case, <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) will not allowlist the remote SMTP client IP address.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_greet_banner</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtpd_banner)</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>text</u> in the optional "220-<u>text</u>..." server response that <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) sends ahead of the real Postfix
       SMTP server's "220 text..." response, in an attempt to confuse bad SMTP clients so that they speak before
       their turn (pre-greet).  Specify an empty value to disable this feature.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_greet_ttl</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1d)</b></h4><pre>
       The  amount  of time that <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) remembers that a client IP address passed a PREGREET test, before
       it is required to pass that test again. The default is  relatively  short,  because  a  good  client  can
       immediately talk to a real Postfix SMTP server.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit

       for DNS blocklist lookup results to arrive (default: up to 2  seconds  under  stress,  up  to  6  seconds
       otherwise).

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_helo_required</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtpd_helo_required)</b></h4><pre>
       Require that a remote SMTP client sends HELO or EHLO before commencing a MAIL transaction.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_non_smtp_command_action</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>drop)</b></h4><pre>
       The action that <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) takes when a remote SMTP client sends non-SMTP commands as  specified  with
       the postscreen_forbidden_commands parameter.  Specify one of the following:

       <b>ignore</b> Ignore  the  failure  of this test. Allow other tests to complete.  Do <u>not</u> repeat this test before
              the result from some other test expires.   This  option  is  useful  for  testing  and  collecting
              statistics without blocking mail permanently.

       <b>enforce</b>

              feature.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_non_smtp_command_enable</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable "non-SMTP command" tests in the <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) server. These tests are  expensive:  a  client  must
       disconnect after it passes the test, before it can talk to a real Postfix SMTP server.

       disconnect after it passes the test, before it can talk to a real Postfix SMTP server.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is d (days).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_pipelining_action</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>enforce)</b></h4><pre>
       The  action that <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) takes when a remote SMTP client sends multiple commands instead of sending
       one command and waiting for the server to respond.  Specify one of the following:

       <b>ignore</b> Ignore the failure of this test. Allow other tests to complete.  Do <u>not</u> repeat  this  test  before
              the  result  from  some  other  test  expires.   This  option is useful for testing and collecting
              statistics without blocking mail permanently.

       <b>enforce</b>
              Allow other tests to complete. Reject attempts to deliver mail with a 550 SMTP reply, and log  the
              helo/sender/recipient information.  Repeat this test the next time the client connects.

       <b>drop</b>   Drop  the  connection immediately with a 521 SMTP reply. Repeat this test the next time the client
              connects.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_pipelining_enable</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable "pipelining" SMTP protocol tests in the <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) server. These tests are  expensive:  a  good
       client must disconnect after it passes the test, before it can talk to a real Postfix SMTP server.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_pipelining_ttl</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>30d)</b></h4><pre>
       The  amount  of  time  that  <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8)  remembers that a client IP address passed a "pipelining" SMTP
       protocol test, before it is required to pass that test again. The default is long because a  good  client
       must disconnect after it passes the test, before it can talk to a real Postfix SMTP server.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is d (days).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_post_queue_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_process_limit)</b></h4><pre>
       The number of clients that can be waiting for service from a real Postfix SMTP server process. When  this
       queue is full, all clients will receive a 421 response.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_pre_queue_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_process_limit)</b></h4><pre>
       The  number  of  non-allowlisted  clients  that  can  be waiting for a decision whether they will receive
       service from a real Postfix SMTP server process. When this queue is  full,  all  non-allowlisted  clients
       will receive a 421 response.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_reject_footer</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtpd_reject_footer)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional   information  that  is  appended  after  a  4XX  or  5XX  <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8)  server  response.  See
       smtpd_reject_footer for further details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 and later.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_reject_footer_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtpd_reject_footer_maps)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional lookup table for information that is appended after a 4XX or 5XX <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) server  response.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.4 and later.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_tls_security_level</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtpd_tls_security_level)</b></h4><pre>
       The  SMTP  TLS  security  level  for  the <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) server; when a non-empty value is specified, this
       overrides    the    obsolete    parameters    postscreen_use_tls    and    postscreen_enforce_tls.    See
       smtpd_tls_security_level for details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 and later.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_upstream_proxy_protocol</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       The  name  of the proxy protocol used by an optional before-postscreen proxy agent. When a proxy agent is
       used,   this   protocol   conveys   local   and   remote   address   and   port   information.    Specify
       "postscreen_upstream_proxy_protocol  =  haproxy"  to  enable the haproxy protocol; version 2 is supported
       with Postfix 3.5 and later.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.10 and later.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_use_tls</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtpd_use_tls)</b></h4><pre>
       Opportunistic TLS: announce STARTTLS support to remote SMTP clients, but do not require that clients  use
       TLS encryption.

       This  feature  is  available  in  Postfix  2.8  and later.  Preferably, use postscreen_tls_security_level
       instead.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_watchdog_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>10s)</b></h4><pre>
       How much time a <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) process may take to respond to a remote SMTP client command or to perform a
       cache operation before it is terminated by a built-in watchdog timer.  This is a  safety  mechanism  that
       prevents <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) from becoming non-responsive due to a bug in Postfix itself or in system software.
       To avoid false alarms and unnecessary cache corruption this limit cannot be set under 10s.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>postscreen_whitelist_interfaces</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>static:all)</b></h4><pre>
       Renamed to postscreen_allowlist_interfaces in Postfix 3.6.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.9 - 3.5.

</pre><h4><b>prepend_delivered_header</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>command,</b> <b>file,</b> <b>forward)</b></h4><pre>
       The message delivery contexts where the Postfix <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) delivery agent prepends a Delivered-To:  message
       header with the address that the mail was delivered to. This information is used for mail  delivery  loop
       detection.

       By  default,  the  Postfix  local delivery agent prepends a Delivered-To: header when forwarding mail and
       when delivering to file (mailbox) and command. Turning off the Delivered-To: header when forwarding  mail
       is not recommended.

       Specify zero or more of <b>forward</b>, <b>file</b>, or <b>command</b>.

       Example:

       prepend_delivered_header = forward

</pre><h4><b>process_id</b> <b>(read-only)</b></h4><pre>
       The process ID of a Postfix command or daemon process.

</pre><h4><b>process_id_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>pid)</b></h4><pre>
       The location of Postfix PID files relative to $queue_directory.  This is a read-only parameter.

</pre><h4><b>process_name</b> <b>(read-only)</b></h4><pre>
       The process name of a Postfix command or daemon process.

</pre><h4><b>propagate_unmatched_extensions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>canonical,</b> <b>virtual)</b></h4><pre>
       What address lookup tables copy an address extension from the lookup key to the lookup result.

       For  example,  with  a  <b><a href="../man5/virtual.5.html">virtual</a></b>(5)  mapping  of  "<u><a href="mailto:joe@example.com">joe@example.com</a></u>  <u>=&gt;</u>  <u><a href="mailto:joe.user@example.net">joe.user@example.net</a></u>", the address
       "<u>joe+<a href="mailto:foo@example.com">foo@example.com</a></u>" would rewrite to "<u>joe.user+<a href="mailto:foo@example.net">foo@example.net</a></u>".

       Specify zero or more of <b>canonical</b>, <b>virtual</b>, <b>alias</b>, <b>forward</b>,  <b>include</b>  or  <b>generic</b>.  These  cause  address
       extension  propagation  with  <b><a href="../man5/canonical.5.html">canonical</a></b>(5),  <b><a href="../man5/virtual.5.html">virtual</a></b>(5),  and <b><a href="../man5/aliases.5.html">aliases</a></b>(5) maps, with <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) .forward and
       :include: file lookups, and with <b><a href="../man8/smtp.8.html">smtp</a></b>(8) generic maps, respectively.

       Note: enabling this feature for types other than <b>canonical</b> and <b>virtual</b> is likely to cause  problems  when
       mail is forwarded to other sites, especially with mail that is sent to a mailing list exploder address.

       Examples:

       propagate_unmatched_extensions = canonical, virtual, alias,
               forward, include
       propagate_unmatched_extensions = canonical, virtual

</pre><h4><b>proxy_interfaces</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       The  remote  network  interface  addresses  that  this  mail system receives mail on by way of a proxy or
       network address translation unit.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       You must specify your "outside" proxy/NAT addresses when your system  is  a  backup  MX  host  for  other
       domains, otherwise mail delivery loops will happen when the primary MX host is down.

       Example:

       proxy_interfaces = 1.2.3.4

</pre><h4><b>proxy_read_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The lookup tables that the <b><a href="../man8/proxymap.8.html">proxymap</a></b>(8) server is allowed to access for the read-only service.

       Specify  zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma.  Table references that
       don't begin with proxy: are ignored.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>proxy_write_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The lookup tables that  the  <b><a href="../man8/proxymap.8.html">proxymap</a></b>(8)  server  is  allowed  to  access  for  the  read-write  service.
       Postfix-owned  local  database  files  should  be  stored  under the Postfix-owned data_directory.  Table
       references that don't begin with proxy: are ignored.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.

</pre><h4><b>proxymap_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>proxymap)</b></h4><pre>
       The name of the proxymap read-only table lookup service.  This service is  normally  implemented  by  the
       <b><a href="../man8/proxymap.8.html">proxymap</a></b>(8) daemon.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>proxywrite_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>proxywrite)</b></h4><pre>
       The  name of the proxywrite read-write table lookup service.  This service is normally implemented by the
       <b><a href="../man8/proxymap.8.html">proxymap</a></b>(8) daemon.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>qmgr_clog_warn_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b></h4><pre>
       The minimal delay between warnings that a specific destination is clogging up the Postfix  active  queue.
       Specify 0 to disable.

       Specify  a  non-negative  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies
       the time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time
       unit is s (seconds).

       This feature is enabled with the helpful_warnings parameter.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>qmgr_daemon_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000s)</b></h4><pre>
       How  much  time a Postfix queue manager process may take to handle a request before it is terminated by a
       built-in watchdog timer.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 and later.

</pre><h4><b>qmgr_fudge_factor</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100)</b></h4><pre>
       Obsolete  feature:  the percentage of delivery resources that a busy mail system will use up for delivery
       of a large mailing  list message.

       This feature exists only in the <b><a href="../man8/oqmgr.8.html">oqmgr</a></b>(8) old queue manager. The current queue manager solves the  problem
       in a better way.

</pre><h4><b>qmgr_ipc_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>60s)</b></h4><pre>
       The  time  limit  for  the  queue  manager  to send or receive information over an internal communication
       channel.  The purpose is to break out of deadlock situations. If the time limit is exceeded the  software
       either retries or aborts the operation.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 and later.

</pre><h4><b>qmgr_message_active_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>20000)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal number of messages in the active queue.

</pre><h4><b>qmgr_message_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>20000)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal number of recipients held in memory by the Postfix queue manager, and the maximal size of the
       short-term, in-memory "dead" destination status cache.

</pre><h4><b>qmgr_message_recipient_minimum</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>10)</b></h4><pre>
       The minimal number of in-memory recipients for any message. This takes priority over any other  in-memory
       recipient  limits  (i.e., the global qmgr_message_recipient_limit and the per transport _recipient_limit)
       if necessary. The minimum value allowed for this parameter is 1.

</pre><h4><b>qmqpd_authorized_clients</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       What remote QMQP clients are allowed to connect to the Postfix QMQP server port.

       By default, no client is allowed to use the service. This is because the QMQP server will relay  mail  to
       any destination.

       Specify  a  list  of  client  patterns.  A list pattern specifies a host name, a domain name, an internet
       address, or a network/mask pattern, where the mask specifies the number of  bits  in  the  network  part.
       When a pattern specifies a file name, its contents are substituted for the file name; when a pattern is a
       "type:table" table specification, table lookup is used instead.

       Patterns  are  separated  by  whitespace and/or commas. In order to reverse the result, precede a pattern
       with an exclamation point (!). The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       Pattern matching of domain names is controlled by the presence or absence  of  "qmqpd_authorized_clients"
       in the parent_domain_matches_subdomains parameter value.

       Example:

       qmqpd_authorized_clients = !192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.0/24

</pre><h4><b>qmqpd_client_port_logging</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable  logging  of  the  remote QMQP client port in addition to the hostname and IP address. The logging
       format is "host[address]:port".

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.

</pre><h4><b>qmqpd_error_delay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1s)</b></h4><pre>
       How long the Postfix QMQP server will pause before sending a negative reply to the  remote  QMQP  client.
       The purpose is to slow down confused or malicious clients.

       Specify  a  non-negative  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies
       the time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time
       unit is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>qmqpd_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b></h4><pre>
       The  time  limit  for  sending  or  receiving information over the network.  If a read or write operation
       blocks for more than $qmqpd_timeout seconds the Postfix QMQP server gives up and disconnects.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>queue_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The  location  of  the  Postfix  top-level  queue directory. This is the root directory of Postfix daemon
       processes that run chrooted.

</pre><h4><b>queue_file_attribute_count_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal number of (name=value) attributes that may be stored in a Postfix queue file.  The  limit  is
       enforced by the <b><a href="../man8/cleanup.8.html">cleanup</a></b>(8) server.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>queue_minfree</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b></h4><pre>
       The  minimal amount of free space in bytes in the queue file system that is needed to receive mail.  This
       is currently used by the Postfix SMTP server to decide if it will accept any mail at all.

       By default, the Postfix SMTP server rejects MAIL FROM commands when the amount of free space is less than
       1.5*$message_size_limit (Postfix version 2.1 and later).  To specify a higher minimum free  space  limit,
       specify a queue_minfree value that is at least 1.5*$message_size_limit.

       With  Postfix  versions 2.0 and earlier, a queue_minfree value of zero means there is no minimum required
       amount of free space.

</pre><h4><b>queue_run_delay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b></h4><pre>
       The time between deferred queue scans by the queue manager; prior to Postfix 2.4 the  default  value  was
       1000s.

       This parameter should be set less than or equal to $minimal_backoff_time. See also $maximal_backoff_time.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>queue_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>qmgr)</b></h4><pre>
       The name of the <b><a href="../man8/qmgr.8.html">qmgr</a></b>(8) service. This service manages the Postfix queue and schedules delivery requests.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>rbl_reply_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional lookup tables with RBL or RHSBL response templates. The table search key is the reject_rbl_*  or
       reject_rhsbl_*  argument,  including any optional "<u>=address-filter</u>".  With Postfix 3.10 and later, if the
       result is "not found" and the search key has the form  <u>domain=address-filter</u>,  then  rbl_reply_maps  will
       also search with the <u>domain</u>.

       By  default,  Postfix  uses the template as specified with the default_rbl_reply configuration parameter.
       See there for a discussion of the response template syntax.

       Example:

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           rbl_reply_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/rbl_reply
           smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
               permit_mynetworks,
               reject_rbl_client <u>secret</u>.zen.dq.spamhaus.net=127.0.0.[2..11],
               ...
       /etc/postfix/rbl_reply:
           # See https://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#default_rbl_reply
           # for the definition of the $client_address and $rbl_class etc.
           # variables.
           <u>secret</u>.zen.dq.spamhaus.net=127.0.0.[2..11]
               554 $rbl_class $rbl_what blocked using ZEN - see https://www.spamhaus.org/query/ip/$client_address for details

           # Postfix &gt;= 3.10: if a search key <u>domain=address-filter</u>
           # is not found, then rbl_reply_maps will also search with the
           # <u>domain</u>.
           <u>secret</u>.zen.dq.spamhaus.net
               554 $rbl_class $rbl_what blocked using ZEN - see https://www.spamhaus.org/query/ip/$client_address for details

       NOTE: This feature differs from postscreen_dnsbl_reply_map where the table search key is  only  a  domain
       name (no "<u>=address-filter</u>", no "<u>*weight</u>" factor) and where the lookup result should be only a domain name
       (no free text, no <u>$name</u> variables).

       This  feature  is  available  in  Postfix  2.0  and later.  The "=address-filter" feature is available in
       Postfix 2.8 and later.

</pre><h4><b>readme_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The location of Postfix README files that describe how to build, configure or operate a specific  Postfix
       subsystem or feature.

</pre><h4><b>receive_override_options</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable  or disable recipient validation, built-in content filtering, or address mapping. Typically, these
       are specified in master.cf as command-line arguments for the <b><a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html">smtpd</a></b>(8), <b><a href="../man8/qmqpd.8.html">qmqpd</a></b>(8) or <b><a href="../man8/pickup.8.html">pickup</a></b>(8) daemons.

       Specify zero or more of the following options.  The options override  main.cf  settings  and  are  either
       implemented by <b><a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html">smtpd</a></b>(8), <b><a href="../man8/qmqpd.8.html">qmqpd</a></b>(8), or <b><a href="../man8/pickup.8.html">pickup</a></b>(8) themselves, or they are forwarded to the cleanup server.

       <b>no_unknown_recipient_checks</b>
              Do  not try to reject unknown recipients (SMTP server only).  This is typically specified AFTER an
              external content filter.

       <b>no_address_mappings</b>
              Disable canonical  address  mapping,  virtual  alias  map  expansion,  address  masquerading,  and
              automatic  BCC  (blind  carbon-copy)  recipients.  This  is typically specified BEFORE an external
              content filter.

       <b>no_header_body_checks</b>
              Disable header/body_checks. This is typically specified AFTER an external content filter.

       <b>no_milters</b>
              Disable Milter (mail filter) applications. This is typically specified AFTER an  external  content
              filter.

       Note: when the "BEFORE content filter" receive_override_options setting is specified in the main.cf file,
       specify the "AFTER content filter" receive_override_options setting in master.cf (and vice versa).

       Examples:

       receive_override_options =
           no_unknown_recipient_checks, no_header_body_checks
       receive_override_options = no_address_mappings

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>recipient_bcc_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  BCC  (blind carbon-copy) address lookup tables, indexed by envelope recipient address.  The BCC
       address (multiple results are not supported) is added when mail enters from outside of Postfix.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.

       The table search order is as follows:

       •      Look up the "user+<a href="mailto:extension@domain.tld">extension@domain.tld</a>" address including the optional address extension.

       •      Look up the "<a href="mailto:user@domain.tld">user@domain.tld</a>" address without the optional address extension.

       •      Look up the "user+extension" address local  part  when  the  recipient  domain  equals  $myorigin,
              $mydestination, $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces.

       •      Look  up the "user" address local part when the recipient domain equals $myorigin, $mydestination,
              $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces.

       •      Look up the "@domain.tld" part.

       Note: with Postfix 2.3 and later the BCC address is added as if it was specified  with  NOTIFY=NONE.  The
       sender  will  not  be notified when the BCC address is undeliverable, as long as all down-stream software
       implements RFC 3461.

       Note: with Postfix 2.2 and earlier the sender will unconditionally be notified when the  BCC  address  is
       undeliverable.

       Note:  automatic  BCC  recipients  are  produced only for new mail.  To avoid mailer loops, automatic BCC
       recipients are not generated after Postfix forwards mail internally,  or  after  Postfix  generates  mail
       itself.

       Note:   automatic   BCC  recipients  are  subject  to  address  canonicalization  (add  missing  domain),
       canonical_maps, masquerade_domains, and virtual_alias_maps.

       Example:

       recipient_bcc_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/recipient_bcc

       After a change, run "<b>postmap</b> <b>/etc/postfix/recipient_bcc</b>".

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>recipient_canonical_classes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>envelope_recipient,</b> <b>header_recipient)</b></h4><pre>
       What   addresses   are   subject   to   recipient_canonical_maps   address    mapping.     By    default,
       recipient_canonical_maps  address  mapping  is  applied  to  envelope  recipient addresses, and to header
       recipient addresses.

       Specify one or more of: envelope_recipient, header_recipient

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>recipient_canonical_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional address mapping lookup tables for envelope and header recipient addresses.  The table format and
       lookups are documented in <b><a href="../man5/canonical.5.html">canonical</a></b>(5).

       Note: $recipient_canonical_maps is processed before $canonical_maps.

       Example:

       recipient_canonical_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/recipient_canonical

</pre><h4><b>recipient_delimiter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       The set of characters that can separate an email address localpart, user name, or a  .forward  file  name
       from its extension.  For example, with "recipient_delimiter = +", the software tries user+<a href="mailto:foo@example.com">foo@example.com</a>
       before trying <a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a>, user+foo before trying user, and .forward+foo before trying .forward.

       More  formally,  an  email  address  localpart  or user name is separated from its extension by the first
       character that matches the recipient_delimiter set. The delimiter character and  extension  may  then  be
       used  to  generate an extended .forward file name. This implementation recognizes one delimiter character
       and one extension per email address localpart or email  address.  With  Postfix  2.10  and  earlier,  the
       recipient_delimiter specifies a single character.

       See <b><a href="../man5/canonical.5.html">canonical</a></b>(5), <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8), <b><a href="../man5/relocated.5.html">relocated</a></b>(5) and <b><a href="../man5/virtual.5.html">virtual</a></b>(5) for the effects of recipient_delimiter on lookups
       in  aliases, canonical, virtual, and relocated maps, and see the propagate_unmatched_extensions parameter
       for propagating an extension from one email address to another.

       When  used  in  command_execution_directory,  forward_path,  or  luser_relay,  ${recipient_delimiter}  is
       replaced  with the actual recipient delimiter that was found in the recipient email address (Postfix 2.11
       and later), or it is replaced with the main.cf recipient_delimiter  parameter  value  (Postfix  2.10  and
       earlier).

       The  recipient_delimiter  is  not  applied  to  the mailer-daemon address, the postmaster address, or the
       double-bounce address. With the default "owner_request_special = yes" setting, the recipient_delimiter is
       also not applied to addresses with the special "owner-" prefix or the special "-request" suffix.

       Examples:

       # Handle Postfix-style extensions.
       recipient_delimiter = +

       # Handle both Postfix and qmail extensions (Postfix 2.11 and later).
       recipient_delimiter = +-

       # Use .forward for mail without address extension, and for mail with
       # an unrecognized address extension.
       forward_path = $home/.forward${recipient_delimiter}${extension},
           $home/.forward

</pre><h4><b>reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>554)</b></h4><pre>
       The numerical Postfix SMTP server response code when a remote SMTP client  request  is  rejected  by  the
       "reject" restriction.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 5321.

</pre><h4><b>reject_tempfail_action</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>defer_if_permit)</b></h4><pre>
       The Postfix SMTP server's action when a reject-type restriction fails due to a temporary error condition.
       Specify  "defer"  to defer the remote SMTP client request immediately. With the default "defer_if_permit"
       action, the Postfix SMTP server continues to look for opportunities to reject mail, and defers the client
       request only if it would otherwise be accepted.

       For  finer   control,   see:   unverified_recipient_tempfail_action,   unverified_sender_tempfail_action,
       unknown_address_tempfail_action, and unknown_helo_hostname_tempfail_action.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>relay_clientcerts</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       List  of  tables with remote SMTP client-certificate fingerprints or public key fingerprints (Postfix 2.9
       and later) for which the Postfix SMTP server will allow access with the  permit_tls_clientcerts  feature.
       The   fingerprint  digest  algorithm  is  configurable  via  the  smtpd_tls_fingerprint_digest  parameter
       (hard-coded as md5 prior to Postfix version 2.5).

       The default algorithm is <b>sha256</b> with Postfix &gt;= 3.6 and the <b>compatibility_level</b> set  to  3.6  or  higher.
       With  Postfix  &lt;=  3.5,  the default algorithm is <b>md5</b>.  The best-practice algorithm is now <b>sha256</b>. Recent
       advances in hash function cryptanalysis have led to md5 and sha1 being deprecated  in  favor  of  sha256.
       However, as long as there are no known "second pre-image" attacks against the older algorithms, their use
       in this context, though not recommended, is still likely safe.

       Postfix  lookup  tables are in the form of (key, value) pairs.  Since we only need the key, the value can
       be chosen freely, e.g.  the name of the  user  or  host:  D7:04:2F:A7:0B:8C:A5:21:FA:31:77:E1:41:8A:EE:80
       lutzpc.at.home

       Example:

       relay_clientcerts = hash:/etc/postfix/relay_clientcerts

       For  more fine-grained control, use check_ccert_access to select an appropriate <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5) policy for each
       client.  See RESTRICTION_CLASS_README.

       This feature is available with Postfix version 2.2.

</pre><h4><b>relay_destination_concurrency_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_destination_concurrency_limit)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal number of parallel deliveries  to  the  same  destination  via  the  relay  message  delivery
       transport.  This limit is enforced by the queue manager. The message delivery transport name is the first
       field in the entry in the master.cf file.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>relay_destination_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_destination_recipient_limit)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal number of recipients per message for the relay message  delivery  transport.  This  limit  is
       enforced by the queue manager. The message delivery transport name is the first field in the entry in the
       master.cf file.

       Setting  this  parameter  to a value of 1 changes the meaning of relay_destination_concurrency_limit from
       concurrency per domain into concurrency per recipient.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>relay_domains</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>Postfix</b> <b>&gt;=</b> <b>3.0:</b> <b>empty,</b> <b>Postfix</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>3.0:</b> <b>$mydestination)</b></h4><pre>
       What destination domains (and subdomains thereof) this system will relay mail to. For details  about  how
       the   relay_domains   value   is   used,   see   the   description  of  the  permit_auth_destination  and
       reject_unauth_destination SMTP recipient restrictions.

       Domains that match $relay_domains are delivered with the $relay_transport mail  delivery  transport.  The
       SMTP server validates recipient addresses with $relay_recipient_maps and rejects non-existent recipients.
       See also the relay domains address class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file.

       Note:  Postfix  will not automatically forward mail for domains that list this system as their primary or
       backup MX host. See the permit_mx_backup restriction in the <b><a href="../man5/postconf.5.html">postconf</a></b>(5) manual page.

       Specify a list of host or domain names, "/file/name" patterns or "type:table" lookup tables, separated by
       commas and/or whitespace.  Continue long lines by starting the next line with whitespace. A  "/file/name"
       pattern  is  replaced  by  its  contents;  a  "type:table" lookup table is matched when a (parent) domain
       appears as lookup key. Specify "!pattern" to exclude a domain from the list. The  form  "!/file/name"  is
       supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       Pattern  matching  of  domain  names  is  controlled by the presence or absence of "relay_domains" in the
       parent_domain_matches_subdomains parameter value.

</pre><h4><b>relay_domains_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>554)</b></h4><pre>
       The  numerical  Postfix  SMTP  server  response  code  when  a  client  request  is   rejected   by   the
       reject_unauth_destination recipient restriction.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 5321.

</pre><h4><b>relay_recipient_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional lookup tables with all valid addresses in the domains that match $relay_domains. Specify @domain
       as  a  wild-card  for domains that have no valid recipient list, and become a source of backscatter mail:
       Postfix accepts spam for non-existent recipients and then floods innocent people with undeliverable mail.
       Technically, tables listed with $relay_recipient_maps are used as lists: Postfix needs to know only if  a
       lookup string is found or not, but it does not use the result from the table lookup.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.

       If  this  parameter  is  non-empty, then the Postfix SMTP server will reject mail to unknown relay users.
       This feature is off by default.

       See also the relay domains address class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file.

       Example:

       relay_recipient_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/relay_recipients

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>relay_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>relay)</b></h4><pre>
       The default mail delivery transport  and  next-hop  destination  for  the  relay  domain  address  class:
       recipient domains that match $relay_domains.

       For recipient domains in the relay domain address class:

       •      In   order   of   decreasing   precedence,  the  message  delivery  transport  is  taken  from  1)
              $transport_maps, 2) $relay_transport.

       •      In order of decreasing precedence, the nexthop destination is taken from  1)  $transport_maps,  2)
              $relay_transport, 3) $sender_dependent_relayhost_maps or $relayhost or the recipient domain.

       Specify  a string of the form <u>transport:nexthop</u>, where <u>transport</u> is the name of a mail delivery transport
       defined in master.cf.  The <u>:nexthop</u> destination is optional; its syntax is documented in the manual  page
       of the corresponding delivery agent.

       See also the relay domains address class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>relayhost</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       The  next-hop  destination(s)  for  non-local  mail; takes precedence over non-local domains in recipient
       addresses. This information will not be used when the sender matches $sender_dependent_relayhost_maps.

       In order of decreasing precedence:

       •      For recipient domains in the relay domain address class  (domains  matching  $relay_domains),  the
              nexthop    destination    is    taken   from   1)   $transport_maps,   2)   $relay_transport,   3)
              $sender_dependent_relayhost_maps or $relayhost or the recipient domain.

       •      For  recipient  domains  in  the  default  domain  address  class  (domains  that  do  not   match
              $mydestination,         $inet_interfaces,        $proxy_interfaces,        $virtual_alias_domains,
              $virtual_mailbox_domains,  or  $relay_domains),  the  nexthop  destination  is   taken   from   1)
              $transport_maps,    2)    $sender_dependent_default_transport_maps   or   $default_transport,   3)
              $sender_dependent_relayhost_maps or $relayhost or the recipient domain.

       On an intranet, specify the organizational domain name. If your internal DNS uses no MX records,  specify
       the name of the intranet gateway host instead.

       In  the  case  of SMTP delivery, specify one or more destinations in the form of a domain name, hostname,
       hostname:service, [hostname]:service, [hostaddress]  or  [hostaddress]:service,  separated  by  comma  or
       whitespace.   The  form  [hostname]  turns  off MX or SRV lookups. Multiple destinations are supported in
       Postfix 3.5 and later. Each destination is tried in the specified order.

       If an SMTP destination is a load balancer, and there are no alternative destinations,  specify  the  load
       balancer  multiple  times.   Without  the  duplicate  info,  the  Postfix SMTP client would not reconnect
       immediately to the same load balancer after a remote SMTP server failure.

       If you're connected via UUCP, see the UUCP_README file for useful information.

       Examples:

       relayhost = $mydomain
       relayhost = [gateway.example.com]
       relayhost = mail1.example:587, mail2.example:587
       relayhost = [an.ip.add.ress]

</pre><h4><b>relocated_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional lookup tables with new contact information for users or domains that no longer exist.  The table
       format and lookups are documented in <b><a href="../man5/relocated.5.html">relocated</a></b>(5).

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.

       If you use this feature, run "<b>postmap</b> <b>/etc/postfix/relocated</b>" to build the necessary DBM or DB file after
       change, then "<b>postfix</b> <b>reload</b>" to make the changes visible.

       Examples:

       relocated_maps = dbm:/etc/postfix/relocated
       relocated_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/relocated

</pre><h4><b>remote_header_rewrite_domain</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Rewrite or add message headers in mail from remote clients if the remote_header_rewrite_domain  parameter
       value    is   non-empty,   updating   incomplete   addresses   with   the   domain   specified   in   the
       remote_header_rewrite_domain parameter, and adding missing headers.

       The local_header_rewrite_clients parameter controls what clients Postfix considers local.

       Examples:

       The safe setting: append "domain.invalid" to incomplete header addresses from  remote  SMTP  clients,  so
       that those addresses cannot be confused with local addresses.

           remote_header_rewrite_domain = domain.invalid

       The default, purist, setting: don't rewrite headers from remote clients at all.

           remote_header_rewrite_domain =

</pre><h4><b>require_home_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Require  that  a <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) recipient's home directory exists before mail delivery is attempted. By default
       this test is disabled.  It can be useful for environments that import home directories to the mail server
       (IMPORTING HOME DIRECTORIES IS NOT RECOMMENDED).

</pre><h4><b>reset_owner_alias</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Reset the <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) delivery agent's idea of the owner-alias attribute, when delivering mail  to  a  child
       alias that does not have its own owner alias.

       This  feature  is  available in Postfix 2.8 and later. With older Postfix releases, the behavior is as if
       this parameter is set to "yes".

       As documented in <b><a href="../man5/aliases.5.html">aliases</a></b>(5), when an alias <u>name</u> has a companion alias named owner-<u>name</u>, this will replace
       the envelope sender address, so that delivery errors will be reported to the owner alias instead  of  the
       sender. This configuration is recommended for mailing lists.

       A  less  known  property  of  the owner alias is that it also forces the <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8) delivery agent to write
       local and remote addresses from alias expansion to a new queue file, instead  of  attempting  to  deliver
       mail to local addresses as soon as they come out of alias expansion.

       Writing  local addresses from alias expansion to a new queue file allows for robust handling of temporary
       delivery errors: errors with one local member have no effect on deliveries to other members of the  list.
       On  the other hand, delivery to local addresses as soon as they come out of alias expansion is fragile: a
       temporary error with one local address from alias expansion will cause the entire alias  to  be  expanded
       repeatedly until the error goes away, or until the message expires in the queue.  In that case, a problem
       with one list member results in multiple message deliveries to other list members.

       The  default  behavior of Postfix 2.8 and later is to keep the owner-alias attribute of the parent alias,
       when delivering mail to a child alias that does not have its own owner alias. Then, local addresses  from
       that  child  alias will be written to a new queue file, and a temporary error with one local address will
       not affect delivery to other mailing list members.

       Unfortunately, older Postfix releases reset the owner-alias attribute when delivering  mail  to  a  child
       alias  that  does  not have its own owner alias. To be precise, this resets only the decision to create a
       new queue file, not the decision to override the envelope sender address.  The  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)  delivery  agent
       then  attempts to deliver local addresses as soon as they come out of child alias expansion.  If delivery
       to any address from child alias expansion fails with a temporary error condition, the entire mailing list
       may be expanded repeatedly until the mail expires in the queue, resulting in multiple deliveries  of  the
       same message to mailing list members.

</pre><h4><b>resolve_dequoted_address</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Resolve a recipient address safely instead of correctly, by looking inside quotes.

       By  default,  the  Postfix  address resolver does not quote the address localpart as per RFC 822, so that
       additional @ or % or !  operators remain visible. This behavior  is  safe  but  it  is  also  technically
       incorrect.

       If  you specify "resolve_dequoted_address = no", then the Postfix resolver will not know about additional
       @ etc. operators in the address localpart. This opens opportunities for obscure mail relay  attacks  with
       user@domain@domain addresses when Postfix provides backup MX service for Sendmail systems.

</pre><h4><b>resolve_null_domain</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Resolve  an  address that ends in the "@" null domain as if the local hostname were specified, instead of
       rejecting the address as invalid.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.  Earlier versions always resolve the null  domain  as
       the local hostname.

       The  Postfix  SMTP  server uses this feature to reject mail from or to addresses that end in the "@" null
       domain, and from addresses that rewrite into a form that ends in the "@" null domain.

</pre><h4><b>resolve_numeric_domain</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Resolve "user@ipaddress" as "user@[ipaddress]", instead of rejecting the address as invalid.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>respectful_logging</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>'postconf</b> <b>-d'</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       Avoid logging that implies  white  is  better  than  black.  Instead  use  'allowlist',  'denylist',  and
       variations of those words.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>rewrite_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>rewrite)</b></h4><pre>
       The  name of the address rewriting service. This service rewrites addresses to standard form and resolves
       them to a (delivery method, next-hop host, recipient) triple.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>sample_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>/etc/postfix)</b></h4><pre>
       The name of the directory with example Postfix configuration files.  Starting  with  Postfix  2.1,  these
       files have been replaced with the <b><a href="../man5/postconf.5.html">postconf</a></b>(5) manual page.

</pre><h4><b>send_cyrus_sasl_authzid</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       When  authenticating  to  a  remote  SMTP  or  LMTP  server  with  the default setting "no", send no SASL
       authoriZation ID (authzid); send only the SASL authentiCation ID (authcid) plus the authcid's password.

       The non-default setting "yes" enables the behavior of older Postfix versions.  These always send  a  SASL
       authzid  that  is  equal  to  the  SASL authcid, but this causes interoperability problems with some SMTP
       servers.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.4.4 and later.

</pre><h4><b>sender_based_routing</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       This parameter should not be used. It was replaced by sender_dependent_relayhost_maps in Postfix  version
       2.3.

</pre><h4><b>sender_bcc_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  BCC  (blind  carbon-copy)  address  lookup tables, indexed by envelope sender address.  The BCC
       address (multiple results are not supported) is added when mail enters from outside of Postfix.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.

       The table search order is as follows:

       •      Look up the "user+<a href="mailto:extension@domain.tld">extension@domain.tld</a>" address including the optional address extension.

       •      Look up the "<a href="mailto:user@domain.tld">user@domain.tld</a>" address without the optional address extension.

       •      Look up the  "user+extension"  address  local  part  when  the  sender  domain  equals  $myorigin,
              $mydestination, $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces.

       •      Look  up  the  "user"  address local part when the sender domain equals $myorigin, $mydestination,
              $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces.

       •      Look up the "@domain.tld" part.

       Note: with Postfix 2.3 and later the BCC address is added as if it was specified  with  NOTIFY=NONE.  The
       sender  will  not  be notified when the BCC address is undeliverable, as long as all down-stream software
       implements RFC 3461.

       Note: with Postfix 2.2 and earlier the sender will be notified when the BCC address is undeliverable.

       Note: automatic BCC recipients are produced only for new mail.  To  avoid  mailer  loops,  automatic  BCC
       recipients  are  not  generated  after  Postfix forwards mail internally, or after Postfix generates mail
       itself.

       Note:  automatic  BCC  recipients  are  subject  to  address  canonicalization  (add   missing   domain),
       canonical_maps, masquerade_domains, and virtual_alias_maps.

       Example:

       sender_bcc_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sender_bcc

       After a change, run "<b>postmap</b> <b>/etc/postfix/sender_bcc</b>".

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>sender_canonical_classes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>envelope_sender,</b> <b>header_sender)</b></h4><pre>
       What  addresses  are subject to sender_canonical_maps address mapping.  By default, sender_canonical_maps
       address mapping is applied to envelope sender addresses, and to header sender addresses.

       Specify one or more of: envelope_sender, header_sender

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>sender_canonical_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional address mapping lookup tables for envelope and header sender addresses.  The  table  format  and
       lookups are documented in <b><a href="../man5/canonical.5.html">canonical</a></b>(5).

       Example: you want to rewrite the SENDER address "<a href="mailto:user@ugly.example">user@ugly.example</a>" to "<a href="mailto:user@pretty.example">user@pretty.example</a>", while still
       being able to send mail to the RECIPIENT address "<a href="mailto:user@ugly.example">user@ugly.example</a>".

       Note: $sender_canonical_maps is processed before $canonical_maps.

       Example:

       sender_canonical_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sender_canonical

</pre><h4><b>sender_dependent_default_transport_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       A  sender-dependent  override for the global default_transport parameter setting. The tables are searched
       by the envelope sender address and @domain. A lookup  result  of  DUNNO  terminates  the  search  without
       overriding  the  global  default_transport  parameter  setting.   This  information is overruled with the
       <b><a href="../man5/transport.5.html">transport</a></b>(5) table.

       This setting affects only the  default  domain  address  class  (recipient  domains  that  do  not  match
       $mydestination, $inet_interfaces, $proxy_interfaces, $virtual_alias_domains, $virtual_mailbox_domains, or
       $relay_domains):

       •      In  order  of  decreasing  precedence, the delivery transport is taken from 1) $transport_maps, 2)
              $sender_dependent_default_transport_maps or $default_transport.

       •      In order of decreasing precedence, the nexthop destination is taken from  1)  $transport_maps,  2)
              $sender_dependent_default_transport_maps            or            $default_transport,           3)
              $sender_dependent_relayhost_maps or $relayhost or the recipient domain.

       Note: this overrides default_transport, not transport_maps, and therefore the expected syntax is that  of
       default_transport,   not  the  syntax  of  transport_maps.   Specifically,  this  does  not  support  the
       transport_maps syntax for null transport, null nexthop, or null email addresses.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.

       For safety reasons, this feature does not allow $number substitutions in regular expression maps.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.7 and later.

</pre><h4><b>sender_dependent_relayhost_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       A sender-dependent override for the global relayhost parameter setting. The tables are  searched  by  the
       envelope  sender  address  and @domain. A lookup result of DUNNO terminates the search without overriding
       the global relayhost parameter setting (Postfix 2.6 and later).

       In order of decreasing precedence:

       •      For recipient domains in the relay domain address class  (domains  matching  $relay_domains),  the
              nexthop    destination    is    taken   from   1)   $transport_maps,   2)   $relay_transport,   3)
              $sender_dependent_relayhost_maps or $relayhost or the recipient domain.

       •      For  recipient  domains  in  the  default  domain  address  class  (domains  that  do  not   match
              mydestination,         $inet_interfaces,         $proxy_interfaces,        $virtual_alias_domains,
              $virtual_mailbox_domains,  $relay_domains),   the   nexthop   destination   is   taken   from   1)
              $transport_maps,    2)    $sender_dependent_default_transport_maps   or   $default_transport,   3)
              $sender_dependent_relayhost_maps or $relayhost or the recipient domain.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.

       For safety reasons, this feature does not allow $number substitutions in regular expression maps.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>sendmail_fix_line_endings</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>always)</b></h4><pre>
       Controls how the Postfix sendmail command converts email message line endings  from  &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;  into  UNIX
       format (&lt;LF&gt;).

       <b>always</b> Always  convert message lines ending in &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;. This setting is the default with Postfix 2.9 and
              later.

       <b>strict</b> Convert message lines ending in &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; only if the first  input  line  ends  in  &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.  This
              setting is backwards-compatible with Postfix 2.8 and earlier.

       <b>never</b>  Never convert message lines ending in &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;. This setting exists for completeness only.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.9 and later.

</pre><h4><b>sendmail_path</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       A  Sendmail  compatibility  feature  that specifies the location of the Postfix <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1) command. This
       command can be used to submit mail into the Postfix queue.

</pre><h4><b>service_name</b> <b>(read-only)</b></h4><pre>
       The master.cf service name of a Postfix daemon process. This can be used to distinguish the logging  from
       different services that use the same program name.

       Example master.cf entries:

       # Distinguish inbound MTA logging from submission and submissions logging.
       smtp      inet  n       -       n       -       -       smtpd
       submission inet n       -       n       -       -       smtpd
           -o syslog_name=postfix/$service_name
       submissions inet n      -       n       -       -       smtpd
           -o syslog_name=postfix/$service_name

       # Distinguish outbound MTA logging from inbound relay logging.
       smtp      unix  -       -       n       -       -       smtp
       relay     unix  -       -       n       -       -       smtp
           -o syslog_name=postfix/$service_name

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>service_throttle_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>60s)</b></h4><pre>
       How long the Postfix <b><a href="../man8/master.8.html">master</a></b>(8) waits before forking a server that appears to be malfunctioning.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>setgid_group</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>postdrop)</b></h4><pre>
       The group ownership of set-gid Postfix commands and of  group-writable  Postfix  directories.  When  this
       parameter  value  is  changed  you need to re-run "<b>postfix</b> <b>set-permissions</b>" (with Postfix version 2.0 and
       earlier: "<b>/etc/postfix/post-install</b> <b>set-permissions</b>".

</pre><h4><b>shlib_directory</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>'postconf</b> <b>-d'</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The location of Postfix dynamically-linked libraries  (libpostfix-*.so),  and  the  default  location  of
       Postfix  database  plugins  (postfix-*.so) that have a relative pathname in the dynamicmaps.cf file.  The
       shlib_directory parameter defaults to "no" when Postfix dynamically-linked libraries and database plugins
       are  disabled   at   compile   time,   otherwise   it   typically   defaults   to   /usr/lib/postfix   or
       /usr/local/lib/postfix.

       Notes:

       •      The  directory  specified  with shlib_directory should contain only Postfix-related files. Postfix
              dynamically-linked libraries and database plugins should not be installed  in  a  "public"  system
              directory  such as <a href="file:/usr/lib">/usr/lib</a> or /usr/local/lib. Linking Postfix dynamically-linked library files or
              database plugins into non-Postfix programs is not supported.  Postfix dynamically-linked libraries
              and  database  plugins  implement  a  Postfix-internal  API  that  changes   without   maintaining
              compatibility.

       •      You  can  change  the  shlib_directory  value after Postfix is built. However, you may have to run
              ldconfig or equivalent to prevent Postfix programs from failing because the libpostfix-*.so  files
              are  not  found.   No  ldconfig  command  is  needed  if you keep the libpostfix-*.so files in the
              compiled-in default $shlib_directory location.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>show_user_unknown_table_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Display the name of the recipient table  in  the  "User  unknown"  responses.   The  extra  detail  makes
       troubleshooting easier but also reveals information that is nobody else's business.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>showq_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>showq)</b></h4><pre>
       The name of the <b><a href="../man8/showq.8.html">showq</a></b>(8) service. This service produces mail queue status reports.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_address_preference</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>any)</b></h4><pre>
       The  address  type  ("ipv6",  "ipv4"  or  "any")  that  the  Postfix  SMTP  client will try first, when a
       destination has IPv6 and IPv4 addresses with equal MX preference. This feature has no effect  unless  the
       inet_protocols setting enables both IPv4 and IPv6.

       Postfix  SMTP  client  address  preference  has  evolved. With Postfix 2.8 the default is "ipv6"; earlier
       implementations are hard-coded to prefer IPv6 over IPv4.

       Notes for mail delivery between sites that have both IPv4 and IPv6 connectivity:

       •      The setting "smtp_address_preference = ipv6" is unsafe.  All deliveries will suffer delays  during
              an  IPv6 outage, even while the destination is still reachable over IPv4. Mail may be stuck in the
              queue with Postfix versions &lt; 3.3 that do not implement "smtp_balance_inet_protocols". For similar
              reasons, the setting "smtp_address_preference = ipv4" is also unsafe.

       •      The setting "smtp_address_preference = any" is safe. With this, and "smtp_balance_inet_protocols =
              yes" (the default), only half of deliveries will suffer delays if there is an outage that  affects
              IPv6 or IPv4, as long as it does not affect both.

       •      The  setting "smtp_address_preference = ipv4" is not a solution for remote servers that flag email
              received over IPv6 as more 'spammy' (the client IPv6 address has a bad  or  missing  PTR  or  AAAA
              record,  bad  network  neighbors, etc.). Instead, configure Postfix to receive mail over both IPv4
              and IPv6, and to deliver mail over only IPv4.

                  /etc/postfix/main.cf:
                      inet_protocols = all

                  /etc/postfix/master.cf
                      smtp ...other fields... smtp -o inet_protocols=ipv4

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_address_verify_target</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>rcpt)</b></h4><pre>
       In the context of email address verification, the SMTP protocol stage that determines  whether  an  email
       address  is deliverable.  Specify one of "rcpt" or "data".  The latter is needed with remote SMTP servers
       that reject recipients after the DATA command. Use transport_maps to apply this feature selectively:

           /etc/postfix/main.cf:
               transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport

           /etc/postfix/transport:
               smtp-domain-that-verifies-after-data    smtp-data-target:
               lmtp-domain-that-verifies-after-data    lmtp-data-target:

           /etc/postfix/master.cf:
               smtp-data-target    unix    -    -    n    -    -    smtp
                   -o smtp_address_verify_target=data
               lmtp-data-target    unix    -    -    n    -    -    lmtp
                   -o lmtp_address_verify_target=data

       Unselective use of the "data" target does no harm, but will result in unnecessary "lost connection  after
       DATA" events at remote SMTP/LMTP servers.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_always_send_ehlo</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Always send EHLO at the start of an SMTP session.

       With  "smtp_always_send_ehlo = no", the Postfix SMTP client sends EHLO only when the word "ESMTP" appears
       in the server greeting banner (example: 220 spike.porcupine.org ESMTP Postfix).

</pre><h4><b>smtp_balance_inet_protocols</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       When a remote destination resolves to a combination of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, ensure that  the  Postfix
       SMTP client can try both address types before it runs into the smtp_mx_address_limit.

       This  avoids  an  interoperability  problem  when a destination resolves to primarily IPv6 addresses, the
       smtp_address_limit feature eliminates most or all IPv4 addresses, and the destination  is  not  reachable
       over IPv6.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_bind_address</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       An  optional  numerical  network  address that the Postfix SMTP client should bind to when making an IPv4
       connection.

       This can be specified in the main.cf file for all SMTP clients, or it can be specified in  the  master.cf
       file for a specific client, for example:

           /etc/postfix/master.cf:
               smtp ... smtp -o smtp_bind_address=11.22.33.44

       See smtp_bind_address_enforce for how Postfix should handle errors (Postfix 3.7 and later).

       Note  1: when inet_interfaces specifies no more than one IPv4 address, and that address is a non-loopback
       address, it is automatically used as the smtp_bind_address.  This supports virtual IP hosting, but can be
       a problem on multi-homed firewalls. See the inet_interfaces documentation for more detail.

       Note 2: address information may be enclosed inside [], but this form is not required here.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_bind_address6</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       An optional numerical network address that the Postfix SMTP client should bind to  when  making  an  IPv6
       connection.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

       This  can  be specified in the main.cf file for all SMTP clients, or it can be specified in the master.cf
       file for a specific client, for example:

           /etc/postfix/master.cf:
               smtp ... smtp -o smtp_bind_address6=1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8

       See smtp_bind_address_enforce for how Postfix should handle errors (Postfix 3.7 and later).

       Note 1: when inet_interfaces specifies no more than one IPv6 address, and that address is a  non-loopback
       address,  it  is automatically used as the smtp_bind_address6.  This supports virtual IP hosting, but can
       be a problem on multi-homed firewalls. See the inet_interfaces documentation for more detail.

       Note 2: address information may be enclosed inside [], but this form is not recommended here.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_bind_address_enforce</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Defer delivery when the Postfix SMTP client cannot  apply  the  smtp_bind_address  or  smtp_bind_address6
       setting. By default, the Postfix SMTP client will continue delivery after logging a warning.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.7 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_body_checks</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Restricted  <b><a href="../man5/body_checks.5.html">body_checks</a></b>(5)  tables  for the Postfix SMTP client.  These tables are searched while mail is
       being delivered.  Actions that change the delivery time or destination are not available.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_cname_overrides_servername</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>version</b> <b>dependent)</b></h4><pre>
       When the remote SMTP servername is a DNS CNAME,  replace  the  servername  with  the  result  from  CNAME
       expansion  for  the  purpose  of  logging, SASL password lookup, TLS policy decisions, or TLS certificate
       verification. The value "no" hardens Postfix  smtp_tls_per_site  hostname-based  policies  against  false
       hostname information in DNS CNAME records, and makes SASL password file lookups more predictable. This is
       the default setting as of Postfix 2.3.

       When  DNS CNAME records are validated with secure DNS lookups (smtp_dns_support_level = dnssec), they are
       always allowed to override the above servername (Postfix 2.11 and later).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2.9 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_connect_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>30s)</b></h4><pre>
       The Postfix SMTP client time limit for completing a TCP connection, or zero  (use  the  operating  system
       built-in time limit).

       When no connection can be made within the deadline, the Postfix SMTP client tries the next address on the
       mail exchanger list. Specify 0 to disable the time limit (i.e. use whatever timeout is implemented by the
       operating system).

       Specify  a  non-negative  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies
       the time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time
       unit is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>smtp_connection_cache_destinations</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Permanently enable SMTP connection caching for the specified destinations.  With SMTP connection caching,
       a  connection  is not closed immediately after completion of a mail transaction.  Instead, the connection
       is kept open for up to $smtp_connection_cache_time_limit seconds.  This allows connections to  be  reused
       for other deliveries, and can improve mail delivery performance.

       Specify a comma or white space separated list of destinations or pseudo-destinations:

       •      if  mail  is  sent  without  a relay host: a domain name (the right-hand side of an email address,
              without the [] around a numeric IP address),

       •      if mail is sent via a relay host: a relay host name (without  []  or  non-default  TCP  port),  as
              specified in main.cf or in the transport map,

       •      if mail is sent via a UNIX-domain socket: a pathname (without the unix: prefix),

       •      a /file/name with domain names and/or relay host names as defined above,

       •      a  "type:table"  with  domain names and/or relay host names on the left-hand side.  The right-hand
              side result from "type:table" lookups is ignored.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_connection_cache_on_demand</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Temporarily enable SMTP connection caching while a destination has a high volume of mail  in  the  active
       queue.   With  SMTP connection caching, a connection is not closed immediately after completion of a mail
       transaction.  Instead, the connection is kept open for up to  $smtp_connection_cache_time_limit  seconds.
       This allows connections to be reused for other deliveries, and can improve mail delivery performance.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_connection_cache_time_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>2s)</b></h4><pre>
       When  SMTP  connection  caching  is enabled, the amount of time that an unused SMTP client socket is kept
       open before it is closed.  Do not specify larger values without permission from the remote sites.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_connection_reuse_count_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b></h4><pre>
       When SMTP connection caching is enabled, the number of times that an SMTP session may be reused before it
       is closed, or zero (no limit).  With a reuse count limit of N, a connection is used up to N+1 times.

       NOTE: This feature is unsafe. When a high-volume destination has multiple inbound MTAs, then the  slowest
       inbound  MTA  will attract the most connections to that destination.  This limitation does not exist with
       the smtp_connection_reuse_time_limit feature.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.11.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_connection_reuse_time_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b></h4><pre>
       The amount of time during which Postfix will use an SMTP connection repeatedly.  The  timer  starts  when
       the  connection is initiated (i.e. it includes the connect, greeting and helo latency, in addition to the
       latencies of subsequent mail delivery transactions).

       This feature addresses a performance stability problem with remote SMTP  servers.  This  problem  is  not
       specific  to  Postfix:  it  can  happen when any MTA sends large amounts of SMTP email to a site that has
       multiple MX hosts.

       The problem starts when one of a set of MX hosts becomes slower than the rest.  Even though SMTP  clients
       connect to fast and slow MX hosts with equal probability, the slow MX host ends up with more simultaneous
       inbound  connections  than  the  faster  MX hosts, because the slow MX host needs more time to serve each
       client request.

       The slow MX host becomes a connection attractor.  If one MX host becomes N times slower than the rest, it
       dominates mail delivery latency unless there are more than N fast MX hosts to counter the effect. And  if
       the  number  of  MX  hosts  is  smaller than N, the mail delivery latency becomes effectively that of the
       slowest MX host divided by the total number of MX hosts.

       The solution uses connection caching in a way that differs from Postfix version  2.2.   By  limiting  the
       amount  of  time  during  which  a  connection  can be used repeatedly (instead of limiting the number of
       deliveries over that connection), Postfix not only restores fairness in the distribution of  simultaneous
       connections across a set of MX hosts, it also favors deliveries over connections that perform well, which
       is exactly what we want.

       The default reuse time limit, 300s, is comparable to the various smtp transaction timeouts which are fair
       estimates  of  maximum  excess  latency  for  a  slow  delivery.  Note that hosts may accept thousands of
       messages over a single connection within the default connection reuse time limit.  This  number  is  much
       larger  than  the  default  Postfix  version 2.2 limit of 10 messages per cached connection. It may prove
       necessary to lower the limit to avoid interoperability issues with  MTAs  that  exhibit  bugs  when  many
       messages  are  delivered  via  a single connection.  A lower reuse time limit risks losing the benefit of
       connection reuse when the average connection and mail delivery latency exceeds the reuse time limit.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_data_done_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>600s)</b></h4><pre>
       The Postfix SMTP client time limit for sending the SMTP ".", and for receiving  the  remote  SMTP  server
       response.

       When  no  response  is  received  within the deadline, a warning is logged that the mail may be delivered
       multiple times.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>smtp_data_init_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>120s)</b></h4><pre>
       The  Postfix  SMTP client time limit for sending the SMTP DATA command, and for receiving the remote SMTP
       server response.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days),  w  (weeks).   The  default  time  unit  is  s
       (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>smtp_data_xfer_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>180s)</b></h4><pre>
       The  Postfix  SMTP  client time limit for sending the SMTP message content.  When the connection makes no
       progress for more than $smtp_data_xfer_timeout seconds the Postfix SMTP client terminates the transfer.

       Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days),  w  (weeks).   The  default  time  unit  is  s
       (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>smtp_defer_if_no_mx_address_found</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Defer mail delivery when no MX record resolves to an IP address.

       The  default  (no) is to return the mail as undeliverable. With older Postfix versions the default was to
       keep trying to deliver the mail until someone fixed the MX record or until the mail was too old.

       Note: the Postfix SMTP client always ignores MX records with equal or worse preference than the local MTA
       itself.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_delivery_status_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_delivery_status_filter)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional filter for the <b><a href="../man8/smtp.8.html">smtp</a></b>(8) delivery agent to change the delivery status code or explanatory text  of
       successful or unsuccessful deliveries.  See default_delivery_status_filter for details.

       NOTE:  This  feature  modifies  Postfix  SMTP  client  error or non-error messages that may or may not be
       derived from remote SMTP server responses.  In contrast, the smtp_reply_filter  feature  modifies  remote
       SMTP server responses only.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_destination_concurrency_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_destination_concurrency_limit)</b></h4><pre>
       The  maximal  number  of  parallel  deliveries  to  the  same  destination  via the smtp message delivery
       transport. This limit is enforced by the queue manager. The message delivery transport name is the  first
       field in the entry in the master.cf file.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_destination_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_destination_recipient_limit)</b></h4><pre>
       The  maximal  number  of  recipients  per  message for the smtp message delivery transport. This limit is
       enforced by the queue manager. The message delivery transport name is the first field in the entry in the
       master.cf file.

       Setting this parameter to a value of 1 changes the  meaning  of  smtp_destination_concurrency_limit  from
       concurrency per domain into concurrency per recipient.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Lookup  tables,  indexed  by the remote SMTP server address, with case insensitive lists of EHLO keywords
       (pipelining, starttls, auth, etc.) that the Postfix SMTP client will ignore in the EHLO response  from  a
       remote  SMTP server. See smtp_discard_ehlo_keywords for details. The table is not indexed by hostname for
       consistency with smtpd_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_discard_ehlo_keywords</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       A case insensitive list of EHLO keywords (pipelining, starttls, auth, etc.) that the Postfix SMTP  client
       will ignore in the EHLO response from a remote SMTP server.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

       Notes:

       •      Specify the <b>silent-discard</b> pseudo keyword to prevent this action from being logged.

       •      Use the smtp_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps feature to discard EHLO keywords selectively.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_dns_reply_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  filter  for  Postfix  SMTP client DNS lookup results.  Specify zero or more lookup tables.  The
       lookup tables are searched in the given order for a match with the DNS lookup result,  converted  to  the
       following form:

           <u>name</u> <u>ttl</u> <u>class</u> <u>type</u> <u>preference</u> <u>value</u>

       The  <u>class</u>  field  is  always  "IN", the <u>preference</u> field exists only for MX records, the names of hosts,
       domains, etc.  end in ".", and those names are in ASCII form (xn--mumble form in the case of UTF8 names).

       When a match is found, the table lookup result specifies an action.  By default, the table query and  the
       action name are case-insensitive.  Currently, only the <b>IGNORE</b> action is implemented.

       Notes:

       •      Postfix  DNS  reply  filters  have  no  effect  on  implicit  DNS lookups through nsswitch.conf or
              equivalent mechanisms.

       •      The Postfix SMTP/LMTP client uses smtp_dns_reply_filter and lmtp_dns_reply_filter only to discover
              a remote SMTP or LMTP service (record types MX, A, AAAA, and TLSA).  These lookups are  also  made
              to implement the features reject_unverified_sender and reject_unverified_recipient.

       •      The  Postfix SMTP/LMTP client defers mail delivery when a filter removes all lookup results from a
              successful query.

       •      Postfix SMTP server uses smtpd_dns_reply_filter only to look up MX, A, AAAA, and  TXT  records  to
              implement     the     features     reject_unknown_helo_hostname,     reject_unknown_sender_domain,
              reject_unknown_recipient_domain, reject_rbl_*, and reject_rhsbl_*.

       •      The Postfix SMTP server logs a warning or defers mail delivery when a filter  removes  all  lookup
              results from a successful query.

       Example:  ignore  Google  AAAA  records  in  Postfix  SMTP  client  DNS lookups, because Google sometimes
       hard-rejects mail from IPv6 clients with valid PTR etc. records.

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           smtp_dns_reply_filter = pcre:/etc/postfix/smtp_dns_reply_filter

       /etc/postfix/smtp_dns_reply_filter:
           # /domain ttl IN AAAA address/ action, all case-insensitive.
           # Note: the domain name ends in ".".
           /^\S+\.google\.com\.\s+\S+\s+\S+\s+AAAA\s+/ IGNORE

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_dns_resolver_options</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       DNS Resolver options for the Postfix SMTP client.   Specify  zero  or  more  of  the  following  options,
       separated  by  comma  or whitespace.  Option names are case-sensitive. Some options refer to domain names
       that are specified in the file <a href="file:/etc/resolv.conf">/etc/resolv.conf</a> or equivalent.

       <b>res_defnames</b>
              Append the current domain name to  single-component  names  (those  that  do  not  contain  a  "."
              character).  This  can  produce incorrect results, and is the hard-coded behavior prior to Postfix
              2.8.

       <b>res_dnsrch</b>
              Search for host names in the current domain and in parent  domains.  This  can  produce  incorrect
              results and is therefore not recommended.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_dns_support_level</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Level of DNS support in the Postfix SMTP client.  With "smtp_dns_support_level" left at its empty default
       value,  the  legacy  "disable_dns_lookups"  parameter controls whether DNS is enabled in the Postfix SMTP
       client, otherwise the legacy parameter is ignored.

       Specify one of the following:

       <b>disabled</b>
              Disable  DNS  lookups.   No  MX  lookups  are  performed  and  hostname  to  address  lookups  are
              unconditionally  "native".   This  setting  is  not appropriate for hosts that deliver mail to the
              public Internet.   Some  obsolete  how-to  documents  recommend  disabling  DNS  lookups  in  some
              configurations with content_filters.  This is no longer required and strongly discouraged.

       <b>enabled</b>
              Enable  DNS  lookups.   Nexthop  destination  domains  not  enclosed in "[]" will be subject to MX
              lookups.  If "dns" and "native" are included in the "smtp_host_lookup" parameter value,  DNS  will
              be  queried first to resolve MX-host A records, followed by "native" lookups if no answer is found
              in DNS.

       <b>dnssec</b> Enable DNSSEC lookups.  The "dnssec" setting differs from  the  "enabled"  setting  above  in  the
              following ways:

       •      Any MX lookups will set RES_USE_DNSSEC and RES_USE_EDNS0 to request DNSSEC-validated responses. If
              the MX response is DNSSEC-validated the corresponding hostnames are considered validated.

       •      The   address   lookups   of   validated   hostnames  are  also  validated,  (provided  of  course
              "smtp_host_lookup" includes "dns", see below).

       •      Temporary failures in DNSSEC-enabled hostname-to-address resolution block  any  "native"  lookups.
              Additional "native" lookups only happen when DNSSEC lookups hard-fail (NODATA or NXDOMAIN).

       The  Postfix  SMTP  client  considers  non-MX "[nexthop]" and "[nexthop]:port" destinations equivalent to
       statically-validated MX records of the form "nexthop.   IN  MX  0  nexthop."   Therefore,  with  "dnssec"
       support  turned  on, validated hostname-to-address lookups apply to the nexthop domain of any "[nexthop]"
       or  "[nexthop]:port"  destination.   This  is  also  true  for  LMTP  "inet:host"  and   "inet:host:port"
       destinations, as LMTP hostnames are never subject to MX lookups.

       The  "dnssec"  setting  is  recommended only if you plan to use the dane or dane-only TLS security level,
       otherwise enabling DNSSEC support in Postfix offers  no  additional  security.   Postfix  DNSSEC  support
       relies  on  an  upstream  recursive  nameserver that validates DNSSEC signatures.  Such a DNS server will
       always filter out forged DNS responses, even when Postfix itself is not configured to use DNSSEC.

       When using Postfix DANE support the "smtp_host_lookup" parameter should include "dns",  as  DANE  is  not
       applicable to hosts resolved via "native" lookups.

       As  mentioned  above,  Postfix  is  not  a validating stub resolver; it relies on the system's configured
       DNSSEC-validating recursive nameserver  to  perform  all  DNSSEC  validation.   Since  this  nameserver's
       DNSSEC-validated  responses  will  be  fully trusted, it is strongly recommended that the MTA host have a
       local DNSSEC-validating recursive caching nameserver listening on a loopback address, and  be  configured
       to  use only this nameserver for all lookups.  Otherwise, Postfix may remain subject to man-in-the-middle
       attacks that forge responses from the recursive nameserver

       DNSSEC support requires a version of Postfix compiled against a reasonably-modern DNS <b><a href="../man3/resolver.3.html">resolver</a></b>(3) library
       that implements the RES_USE_DNSSEC and RES_USE_EDNS0 resolver options.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.11 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_enforce_tls</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Enforcement mode: require that remote SMTP servers use TLS encryption, and never send mail in the  clear.
       This  also  requires  that  the  remote SMTP server hostname matches the information in the remote server
       certificate, and that the remote SMTP server certificate was issued by  a  CA  that  is  trusted  by  the
       Postfix  SMTP  client.  If  the  certificate  doesn't  verify  or the hostname doesn't match, delivery is
       deferred and mail stays in the queue.

       The server hostname is matched against all names provided as dNSNames in the SubjectAlternativeName.   If
       no  dNSNames  are  specified,  the  CommonName  is  checked.   The  behavior  may  be  changed  with  the
       smtp_tls_enforce_peername option.

       This option is useful only if you are definitely sure that you will only connect to servers that  support
       RFC  2487  _and_  that provide valid server certificates.  Typical use is for clients that send all their
       email to a dedicated mailhub.

       This  feature  is  available  in  Postfix   2.2   and   later.   With   Postfix   2.3   and   later   use
       smtp_tls_security_level instead.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_fallback_relay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$fallback_relay)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  list  of  relay  destinations  that will be used when an SMTP destination is not found, or when
       delivery fails due to a non-permanent error. With Postfix  2.2  and  earlier  this  parameter  is  called
       fallback_relay.

       By default, smtp_fallback_relay is empty, mail is returned to the sender when a destination is not found,
       and delivery is deferred after it fails due to a non-permanent error.

       With  bulk email deliveries, it can be beneficial to run the fallback relay MTA on the same host, so that
       it can reuse the sender IP address.  This speeds up deliveries that are delayed  by  IP-based  reputation
       systems (greylist, etc.).

       The  fallback relays must be SMTP destinations. Specify a domain, host, host:port, [host]:port, [address]
       or [address]:port; the form [host] turns off MX lookups.  If  you  specify  multiple  SMTP  destinations,
       Postfix will try them in the specified order.

       To  prevent mailer loops between MX hosts and fall-back hosts, Postfix version 2.2 and later will not use
       the fallback relays for destinations that it is MX host for (assuming DNS lookup is turned on).

</pre><h4><b>smtp_generic_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional lookup tables that perform address rewriting in the Postfix SMTP client, typically to  transform
       a  locally  valid  address  into a globally valid address when sending mail across the Internet.  This is
       needed when the local machine does not have its  own  Internet  domain  name,  but  uses  something  like
       <u>localdomain.local</u> instead.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.

       The   table   format   and   lookups   are   documented   in   <b><a href="../man5/generic.5.html">generic</a></b>(5);  examples  are  shown  in  the
       ADDRESS_REWRITING_README and STANDARD_CONFIGURATION_README documents.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_header_checks</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Restricted <b><a href="../man5/header_checks.5.html">header_checks</a></b>(5) tables for the Postfix SMTP client.  These tables are searched while mail  is
       being delivered.  Actions that change the delivery time or destination are not available.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_helo_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$myhostname)</b></h4><pre>
       The hostname to send in the SMTP HELO or EHLO command.

       The default value is the machine hostname.  Specify a hostname or [ip.add.re.ss].

       This information can be specified in the main.cf file for all SMTP clients, or it can be specified in the
       master.cf file for a specific client, for example:

           /etc/postfix/master.cf:
               mysmtp ... smtp -o smtp_helo_name=foo.bar.com

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_helo_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b></h4><pre>
       The  Postfix  SMTP  client time limit for sending the HELO or EHLO command, and for receiving the initial
       remote SMTP server response.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>smtp_host_lookup</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>dns)</b></h4><pre>
       What  mechanisms  the Postfix SMTP client uses to look up a host's IP address.  This parameter is ignored
       when DNS lookups are disabled (see: disable_dns_lookups and smtp_dns_support_level).  The "dns" mechanism
       is always tried before "native" if both are listed.

       Specify one of the following:

       <b>dns</b>    Hosts can be found in the DNS (preferred).

       <b>native</b> Use the native naming service only (nsswitch.conf, or equivalent mechanism).

       <b>dns,</b> <b>native</b>
              Use the native service for hosts not found in the DNS.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_line_length_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>998)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal length of message header and body lines that Postfix will send via SMTP. This limit does  not
       include the &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; at the end of each line.  Longer lines are broken by inserting "&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;&lt;SPACE&gt;", to
       minimize the damage to MIME formatted mail. Specify zero to disable this limit.

       The  Postfix  limit  of  998  characters not including &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; is consistent with the SMTP limit of 1000
       characters including &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.  The Postfix limit was 990 with Postfix 2.8 and earlier.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_mail_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b></h4><pre>
       The Postfix SMTP client time limit for sending the MAIL FROM command, and for receiving the  remote  SMTP
       server response.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>smtp_mime_header_checks</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Restricted <b><a href="../man5/mime_header_checks.5.html">mime_header_checks</a></b>(5) tables for the Postfix SMTP client. These tables are searched while mail
       is being delivered.  Actions that change the delivery time or destination are not available.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_min_data_rate</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>500)</b></h4><pre>
       The minimum plaintext data transfer rate in bytes/second for DATA requests, when  deadlines  are  enabled
       with  smtp_per_request_deadline.   After  a write operation transfers N plaintext message bytes (possibly
       after TLS encryption), and after the DATA request deadline is decremented by the  elapsed  time  of  that
       write  operation, the DATA request deadline is incremented by N/smtp_min_data_rate seconds.  However, the
       deadline will never be incremented beyond the time limit specified with smtp_data_xfer_timeout.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.7 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_mx_address_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>5)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal number of MX (mail exchanger) IP addresses that can result  from  Postfix  SMTP  client  mail
       exchanger lookups, or zero (no limit). Prior to Postfix version 2.3, this limit was disabled by default.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_mx_session_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>2)</b></h4><pre>
       The  maximal  number  of  SMTP  sessions  per delivery request before the Postfix SMTP client gives up or
       delivers to a fall-back relay host, or zero (no limit). This restriction ignores sessions  that  fail  to
       complete  the  SMTP initial handshake (Postfix version 2.2 and earlier) or that fail to complete the EHLO
       and TLS handshake (Postfix version 2.3 and later).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_nested_header_checks</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Restricted <b><a href="../man5/nested_header_checks.5.html">nested_header_checks</a></b>(5) tables for the Postfix SMTP client. These tables  are  searched  while
       mail is being delivered.  Actions that change the delivery time or destination are not available.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_never_send_ehlo</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Never send EHLO at the start of an SMTP session. See also the smtp_always_send_ehlo parameter.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_per_record_deadline</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Change  the  behavior of the smtp_*_timeout time limits, from a time limit per read or write system call,
       to a time limit to send or receive a complete record (an SMTP command  line,  SMTP  response  line,  SMTP
       message  content  line, or TLS protocol message).  This limits the impact from hostile peers that trickle
       data one byte at a time.

       Note: when per-record deadlines are enabled, a short timeout may cause problems with TLS over  very  slow
       network  connections.   The  reasons  are  that  a TLS protocol message can be up to 16 kbytes long (with
       TLSv1), and that an entire TLS protocol message must be sent or received within the per-record deadline.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.9-3.6. With older Postfix releases, the behavior  is  as  if  this
       parameter is set to "no". Postfix 3.7 and later use smtp_per_request_deadline.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_per_request_deadline</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Change  the  behavior  of  the smtp_*_timeout time limits, from a time limit per plaintext or TLS read or
       write call, to a combined time limit for sending a complete SMTP request and  for  receiving  a  complete
       SMTP  response. The deadline limits only the time spent waiting for plaintext or TLS read or write calls,
       not time spent elsewhere. The per-request deadline limits the impact from hostile peers that trickle data
       one byte at a time.

       See smtp_min_data_rate for how the per-request deadline is managed during the DATA phase.

       Note: when per-request deadlines are enabled, a short time limit may cause problems with  TLS  over  very
       slow  network  connections.  The  reason is that a TLS protocol message can be up to 16 kbytes long (with
       TLSv1), and that an entire TLS protocol message must be transferred within the per-request deadline.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.7 and later. A weaker feature, called smtp_per_record_deadline, is
       available with Postfix 2.9-3.6.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.7 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_pix_workaround_delay_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>10s)</b></h4><pre>
       How long the Postfix SMTP client pauses before sending ".&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;"  in  order  to  work  around  the  PIX
       firewall "&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;" bug.

       Choosing too short a time makes this workaround ineffective when sending large messages over slow network
       connections.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>smtp_pix_workaround_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Lookup tables, indexed by the remote SMTP server address, with per-destination workarounds for CISCO  PIX
       firewall    bugs.     The    table    is    not    indexed    by    hostname    for    consistency   with
       smtp_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.4 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_pix_workaround_threshold_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>500s)</b></h4><pre>
       How long  a  message  must  be  queued  before  the  Postfix  SMTP  client  turns  on  the  PIX  firewall
       "&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;" bug workaround for delivery through firewalls with "smtp fixup" mode turned on.

       Specify  a  non-negative  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies
       the time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time
       unit is s (seconds).

       By  default,  the  workaround  is  turned off for mail that is queued for less than 500 seconds. In other
       words, the workaround is normally turned off for the first delivery attempt.

       Specify 0 to enable the PIX firewall "&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;" bug workaround upon the first delivery attempt.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_pix_workarounds</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>disable_esmtp,</b> <b>delay_dotcrlf)</b></h4><pre>
       A list that specifies zero or more workarounds  for  CISCO  PIX  firewall  bugs.  These  workarounds  are
       implemented  by  the  Postfix SMTP client. Workaround names are separated by comma or space, and are case
       insensitive.  This parameter setting  can  be  overruled  with  per-destination  smtp_pix_workaround_maps
       settings.

       <b>delay_dotcrlf</b>
              Insert  a  delay  before  sending  ".&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;" after the end of the message content.  The delay is
              subject to the  smtp_pix_workaround_delay_time  and  smtp_pix_workaround_threshold_time  parameter
              settings.

       <b>disable_esmtp</b>
              Disable all extended SMTP commands: send HELO instead of EHLO.

       This  feature  is  available in Postfix 2.4 and later. The default settings are backwards compatible with
       earlier Postfix versions.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_quit_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b></h4><pre>
       The Postfix SMTP client time limit for sending the QUIT command, and for receiving the remote SMTP server
       response.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>smtp_quote_rfc821_envelope</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Quote  addresses  in  Postfix  SMTP  client  MAIL FROM and RCPT TO commands as required by RFC 5321. This
       includes putting quotes around an address localpart that ends in ".".

       The default is to comply with RFC 5321. If you have to send mail to a broken  SMTP  server,  configure  a
       special SMTP client in master.cf:

           /etc/postfix/master.cf:
               broken-smtp . . . smtp -o smtp_quote_rfc821_envelope=no

       and  route mail for the destination in question to the "broken-smtp" message delivery with a <b><a href="../man5/transport.5.html">transport</a></b>(5)
       table.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_randomize_addresses</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Randomize the order of equal-preference MX host addresses.  This is a performance feature of the  Postfix
       SMTP client.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_rcpt_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b></h4><pre>
       The  Postfix  SMTP  client  time limit for sending the SMTP RCPT TO command, and for receiving the remote
       SMTP server response.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>smtp_reply_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       A mechanism to transform replies from remote SMTP servers one line at a time.  This is a last-resort tool
       to  work  around  server  replies  that  break interoperability with the Postfix SMTP client.  Other uses
       involve fault injection to test Postfix's handling of invalid responses.

       Notes:

       •      In the case of a multi-line reply, the Postfix SMTP client uses the final reply  line's  numerical
              SMTP reply code and enhanced status code.

       •      The  numerical SMTP reply code (XYZ) takes precedence over the enhanced status code (X.Y.Z).  When
              the enhanced status code initial digit differs from the SMTP reply code initial digit, or when  no
              enhanced  status  code  is  present,  the  Postfix SMTP client uses a generic enhanced status code
              (X.0.0) instead.

       Specify the name of a "type:table" lookup table. The search  string  is  a  single  SMTP  reply  line  as
       received  from  the  remote  SMTP server, except that the trailing &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; are removed.  When the lookup
       succeeds, the result replaces the single SMTP reply line.

       Examples:

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           smtp_reply_filter = pcre:/etc/postfix/reply_filter

       /etc/postfix/reply_filter:
           # Transform garbage into "250-filler..." so that it looks like
           # one line from a multi-line reply. It does not matter what we
           # substitute here as long it has the right syntax.  The Postfix
           # SMTP client will use the final line's numerical SMTP reply
           # code and enhanced status code.
           !/^([2-5][0-9][0-9]($|[- ]))/ 250-filler for garbage

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.7.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_rset_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>20s)</b></h4><pre>
       The Postfix SMTP client time limit for sending the RSET command, and for receiving the remote SMTP server
       response. The SMTP client sends RSET in order to finish a recipient address probe, or to  verify  that  a
       cached session is still usable.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_sasl_auth_cache_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       An optional table to prevent repeated SASL authentication failures  with  the  same  remote  SMTP  server
       hostname,  username  and  password.  Each  table (key, value) pair contains a server name, a username and
       password, and the full server response. This information is stored when a remote SMTP server  rejects  an
       authentication  attempt  with  a 535 reply code.  As long as the smtp_sasl_password_maps information does
       not  change,  and  as  long  as  the  smtp_sasl_auth_cache_name  information   does   not   expire   (see
       smtp_sasl_auth_cache_time)  the  Postfix  SMTP  client  avoids SASL authentication attempts with the same
       server,  username  and  password,  and  instead  bounces  or  defers  mail   as   controlled   with   the
       smtp_sasl_auth_soft_bounce configuration parameter.

       Use  a  per-destination delivery concurrency of 1 (for example, "smtp_destination_concurrency_limit = 1",
       "relay_destination_concurrency_limit = 1", etc.), otherwise multiple delivery  agents  may  experience  a
       login failure at the same time.

       The  table  must  be accessed via the proxywrite service, i.e. the map name must start with "proxy:". The
       table should be stored under the directory specified with the data_directory parameter.

       This feature uses cryptographic hashing to protect plain-text passwords, and  requires  that  Postfix  is
       compiled with TLS support.

       Example:

       smtp_sasl_auth_cache_name = proxy:btree:/var/lib/postfix/sasl_auth_cache

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_sasl_auth_cache_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>90d)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal age of an smtp_sasl_auth_cache_name entry before it is removed.

       Specify  a  non-negative  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies
       the time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time
       unit is d (days).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_sasl_auth_enable</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable  SASL  authentication  in  the  Postfix  SMTP client.  By default, the Postfix SMTP client uses no
       authentication.

       Example:

       smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes

</pre><h4><b>smtp_sasl_auth_soft_bounce</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       When a remote SMTP server rejects a SASL authentication  request  with  a  535  reply  code,  defer  mail
       delivery  instead of returning mail as undeliverable. The latter behavior was hard-coded prior to Postfix
       version 2.5.

       Note: the setting "yes" overrides the global soft_bounce parameter, but the setting "no" does not.

       Example:

       # Default as of Postfix 2.5
       smtp_sasl_auth_soft_bounce = yes
       # The old hard-coded default
       smtp_sasl_auth_soft_bounce = no

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       If non-empty, a Postfix SMTP client filter for the remote SMTP server's list of offered SASL  mechanisms.
       Different  client  and  server  implementations  may  support  different mechanism lists; by default, the
       Postfix SMTP client will use  the  intersection  of  the  two.  smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter  specifies  an
       optional third mechanism list to intersect with.

       Specify  mechanism names, "/file/name" patterns or "type:table" lookup tables. The right-hand side result
       from "type:table" lookups is ignored. Specify "!pattern" to exclude a mechanism name from the  list.  The
       form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

       Examples:

       smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter = plain, login
       smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter = /etc/postfix/smtp_mechs
       smtp_sasl_mechanism_filter = !gssapi, !login, static:rest

</pre><h4><b>smtp_sasl_password_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  Postfix  SMTP client lookup tables with one username:password entry per sender, remote hostname
       or next-hop domain. Per-sender lookup is done only when sender-dependent authentication is  enabled.   If
       no username:password entry is found, then the Postfix SMTP client will not attempt to authenticate to the
       remote host.

       Use  smtp_sasl_password_result_delimiter  to  specify  an  alternative  separator  between  username  and
       password.

       The Postfix SMTP client opens the lookup table before going to chroot jail, so you can leave the password
       file in /etc/postfix.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_sasl_password_result_delimiter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>:)</b></h4><pre>
       The  delimiter  between  username  and  password  in  sasl_passwd_maps  lookup   results.   Specify   one
       non-whitespace character that does not appear in the username.

       This feature is available in Postfix &gt;= 3.9.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_sasl_path</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Implementation-specific  information  that  the  Postfix  SMTP  client passes through to the SASL plug-in
       implementation  that  is  selected  with  <b>smtp_sasl_type</b>.   Typically  this  specifies  the  name  of   a
       configuration file or rendezvous point.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_sasl_security_options</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>noplaintext,</b> <b>noanonymous)</b></h4><pre>
       Postfix  SMTP  client  SASL security options; as of Postfix 2.3 the list of available features depends on
       the SASL client implementation that is selected with <b>smtp_sasl_type</b>.

       The following security features are defined for the <b>cyrus</b> client SASL implementation:

       Specify zero or more of the following:

       <b>noplaintext</b>
              Disallow methods that use plaintext passwords.

       <b>noactive</b>
              Disallow methods subject to active (non-dictionary) attack.

       <b>nodictionary</b>
              Disallow methods subject to passive (dictionary) attack.

       <b>noanonymous</b>
              Disallow methods that allow anonymous authentication.

       <b>mutual_auth</b>
              Only allow methods that provide mutual authentication (not available with SASL version 1).

       Example:

       smtp_sasl_security_options = noplaintext

</pre><h4><b>smtp_sasl_tls_security_options</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtp_sasl_security_options)</b></h4><pre>
       The SASL authentication security options that the  Postfix  SMTP  client  uses  for  TLS  encrypted  SMTP
       sessions.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_sasl_tls_verified_security_options</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtp_sasl_tls_security_options)</b></h4><pre>
       The  SASL  authentication  security  options  that  the  Postfix  SMTP client uses for TLS encrypted SMTP
       sessions with a verified server certificate.

       When mail is sent to the public MX host for the recipient's domain, server certificates  are  by  default
       optional,  and  delivery  proceeds  even if certificate verification fails. For delivery via a submission
       service that requires SASL authentication, it may be appropriate to send plaintext  passwords  only  when
       the connection to the server is strongly encrypted <b>and</b> the server identity is verified.

       The  smtp_sasl_tls_verified_security_options  parameter  makes  it  possible  to  only  enable  plaintext
       mechanisms when a secure connection to the server is available. Submission servers subject to this policy
       must either have verifiable certificates or offer suitable non-plaintext SASL mechanisms.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_sasl_type</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>cyrus)</b></h4><pre>
       The SASL plug-in type that the Postfix SMTP client should use for authentication.   The  available  types
       are listed with the "<b>postconf</b> <b>-A</b>" command.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_send_dummy_mail_auth</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Whether  or  not  to  append  the  "AUTH=&lt;&gt;"  option  to the MAIL FROM command in SASL-authenticated SMTP
       sessions. The default is not to send this, to avoid problems with broken  remote  SMTP  servers.   Before
       Postfix 2.9 the behavior is as if "smtp_send_dummy_mail_auth = yes".

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.9 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_send_xforward_command</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Send  the  non-standard  XFORWARD  command  when the Postfix SMTP server EHLO response announces XFORWARD
       support.

       This allows a Postfix SMTP delivery agent, used for injecting mail into a content filter, to forward  the
       name, address, protocol and HELO name of the original client to the content filter and downstream queuing
       SMTP server. This can produce more useful logging than localhost[127.0.0.1] etc.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_sender_dependent_authentication</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable  sender-dependent  authentication  in  the  Postfix  SMTP client; this is available only with SASL
       authentication, and disables SMTP connection caching to ensure that mail from different senders will  use
       the appropriate credentials.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_skip_4xx_greeting</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Skip SMTP servers that greet with a 4XX status code (go away, try again later).

       By  default, the Postfix SMTP client moves on the next mail exchanger.  Specify "smtp_skip_4xx_greeting =
       no" if Postfix should defer delivery immediately.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and earlier.  Later Postfix versions  always  skip  remote  SMTP
       servers that greet with a 4XX status code.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_skip_5xx_greeting</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Skip remote SMTP servers that greet with a 5XX status code.

       By  default,  the Postfix SMTP client moves on the next mail exchanger. Specify "smtp_skip_5xx_greeting =
       no" if Postfix should bounce the mail immediately. Caution: the latter behavior appears to contradict RFC
       2821.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_skip_quit_response</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Do not wait for the response to the SMTP QUIT command.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_starttls_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b></h4><pre>
       Time limit for Postfix SMTP client write and read operations during TLS startup  and  shutdown  handshake
       procedures.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tcp_port</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>smtp)</b></h4><pre>
       The default TCP port that the Postfix SMTP client connects to.  Specify a symbolic name (see <b><a href="../man5/services.5.html">services</a></b>(5))
       or a numeric port.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_CAfile</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       A file containing CA certificates of root CAs trusted to sign either remote SMTP server  certificates  or
       intermediate  CA  certificates.  These are loaded into memory before the <b><a href="../man8/smtp.8.html">smtp</a></b>(8) client enters the chroot
       jail. If the number of trusted roots is large, consider using smtp_tls_CApath instead, but note that  the
       latter directory must be present in the chroot jail if the <b><a href="../man8/smtp.8.html">smtp</a></b>(8) client is chrooted. This file may also
       be  used  to  augment  the  client  certificate  trust  chain, but it is best to include all the required
       certificates directly in $smtp_tls_cert_file (or, Postfix &gt;= 3.4 $smtp_tls_chain_files).

       Specify "smtp_tls_CAfile = /path/to/system_CA_file" to use ONLY the system-supplied default Certification
       Authority certificates.

       Specify "tls_append_default_CA = no" to prevent Postfix from appending the  system-supplied  default  CAs
       and trusting third-party certificates.

       Example:

       smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/postfix/CAcert.pem

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_CApath</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Directory  with  PEM  format  Certification  Authority  certificates that the Postfix SMTP client uses to
       verify a remote SMTP server certificate.  Don't forget to create the necessary  "hash"  links  with,  for
       example, "$OPENSSL_HOME/bin/c_rehash /etc/postfix/certs".

       To use this option in chroot mode, this directory (or a copy) must be inside the chroot jail.

       Specify  "smtp_tls_CApath  =  /path/to/system_CA_directory"  to  use  ONLY  the  system-supplied  default
       Certification Authority certificates.

       Specify "tls_append_default_CA = no" to prevent Postfix from appending the  system-supplied  default  CAs
       and trusting third-party certificates.

       Example:

       smtp_tls_CApath = /etc/postfix/certs

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_block_early_mail_reply</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Try  to  detect  a  mail hijacking attack based on a TLS protocol vulnerability (CVE-2009-3555), where an
       attacker prepends malicious HELO, MAIL, RCPT, DATA commands to a Postfix SMTP client  TLS  session.   The
       attack  would  succeed  with  non-Postfix SMTP servers that reply to the malicious HELO, MAIL, RCPT, DATA
       commands after negotiating the Postfix SMTP client TLS session.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.7.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_cert_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       File with the Postfix SMTP client RSA certificate in PEM format.  This file may also contain the  Postfix
       SMTP client private RSA key, and these may be the same as the Postfix SMTP server RSA certificate and key
       file.   With  Postfix  &gt;=  3.4  the  preferred  way  to configure client keys and certificates is via the
       "smtp_tls_chain_files" parameter.

       Do not configure client certificates unless you <b>must</b> present client  TLS  certificates  to  one  or  more
       servers.  Client  certificates are not usually needed, and can cause problems in configurations that work
       well without them. The recommended setting is to let the defaults stand:

           smtp_tls_cert_file =
           smtp_tls_key_file =
           smtp_tls_eccert_file =
           smtp_tls_eckey_file =
           # Obsolete DSA parameters
           smtp_tls_dcert_file =
           smtp_tls_dkey_file =
           # Postfix &gt;= 3.4 interface
           smtp_tls_chain_files =

       The best way to use the default settings is to comment out the above parameters in main.cf if present.

       To enable remote SMTP servers to verify the Postfix SMTP client certificate, the issuing CA  certificates
       must  be  made  available  to  the  server.  You  should  include the required certificates in the client
       certificate file, the client certificate first, then the issuing CA(s) (bottom-up order).

       Example: the certificate for "client.example.com" was issued by "intermediate  CA"  which  itself  has  a
       certificate issued by "root CA".  As the "root" super-user create the client.pem file with:

           # <b>umask</b> <b>077</b>
           # <b>cat</b> <b>client_key.pem</b> <b>client_cert.pem</b> <b>intermediate_CA.pem</b> <b>&gt;</b> <b>chain.pem</b>

       If  you  also  want  to  verify  remote  SMTP server certificates issued by these CAs, you can add the CA
       certificates  to  the  smtp_tls_CAfile,  in  which  case  it  is  not  necessary  to  have  them  in  the
       smtp_tls_cert_file, smtp_tls_dcert_file (obsolete) or smtp_tls_eccert_file.

       A  certificate  supplied  here  must  be  usable as an SSL client certificate and hence pass the "openssl
       verify -purpose sslclient ..." test.

       Example:

       smtp_tls_cert_file = /etc/postfix/chain.pem

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_chain_files</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       List of one or more PEM files, each holding one or more private keys directly followed by a corresponding
       certificate chain.  The file names are separated by commas and/or whitespace.  This  parameter  obsoletes
       the  legacy  algorithm-specific key and certificate file settings.  When this parameter is non-empty, the
       legacy parameters are ignored, and a warning is logged if any are also non-empty.

       With the proliferation of multiple private  key  algorithms-which,  as  of  OpenSSL  1.1.1,  include  DSA
       (obsolete),  RSA,  ECDSA,  Ed25519 and Ed448-it is increasingly impractical to use separate parameters to
       configure the key and certificate chain for each algorithm.   Therefore,  Postfix  now  supports  storing
       multiple keys and corresponding certificate chains in a single file or in a set of files.

       Each  key must appear <b>immediately</b> <b>before</b> the corresponding certificate, optionally followed by additional
       issuer certificates that complete the certificate chain for that key.  When multiple files are specified,
       they are equivalent to a single file that is concatenated from those files in  the  given  order.   Thus,
       while  a  key must always precede its certificate and issuer chain, it can be in a separate file, so long
       as that file is listed immediately before the file that holds the corresponding certificate chain.   Once
       all  the files are concatenated, the sequence of PEM objects must be: <u>key1,</u> <u>cert1,</u> <u>[chain1],</u> <u>key2,</u> <u>cert2,</u>
       <u>[chain2],</u> <u>...,</u> <u>keyN,</u> <u>certN,</u> <u>[chainN].</u>

       Storing the private key in the same file as the corresponding certificate is more reliable.  With the key
       and certificate in separate files, there is a chance that during key rollover  a  Postfix  process  might
       load  a private key and certificate from separate files that don't match.  Various operational errors may
       even result in a persistent broken configuration in which the certificate does not match the private key.

       The file or files must contain at most one key of each type.  If, for example, two or more RSA  keys  and
       corresponding  chains  are  listed,  depending on the version of OpenSSL either only the last one will be
       used or a configuration error may be detected.  Note that while  "Ed25519"  and  "Ed448"  are  considered
       separate  algorithms,  the various ECDSA curves (typically one of prime256v1, secp384r1 or secp521r1) are
       considered as different parameters of a single "ECDSA" algorithm, so it  is  not  presently  possible  to
       configure keys for more than one ECDSA curve.

       Example (separate files for each key and corresponding certificate chain):

           /etc/postfix/main.cf:
               smtp_tls_chain_files =
                   ${config_directory}/ed25519.pem,
                   ${config_directory}/ed448.pem,
                   ${config_directory}/rsa.pem

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_cipherlist</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Obsolete  Postfix  &lt;  2.3 control for the Postfix SMTP client TLS cipher list. As this feature applies to
       all TLS security levels, it is easy to create interoperability problems by choosing a non-default  cipher
       list.  Do  not  use a non-default TLS cipher list on hosts that deliver email to the public Internet: you
       will be unable to send email to servers that only support the ciphers you  exclude.  Using  a  restricted
       cipher  list  may  be more appropriate for an internal MTA, where one can exert some control over the TLS
       software and settings of the peer servers.

       <b>Note:</b> do not use "" quotes around the parameter value.

       This feature is available in Postfix version 2.2. It  is  not  used  with  Postfix  2.3  and  later;  use
       smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers instead.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_ciphers</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>medium)</b></h4><pre>
       The  minimum  TLS  cipher  grade that the Postfix SMTP client will use with opportunistic TLS encryption.
       Cipher types listed in smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers are excluded from the base  definition  of  the  selected
       cipher grade.   The default value is "medium" for Postfix releases after the middle of 2015, "export" for
       older releases.

       When  TLS  is  mandatory  the  cipher  grade  is  chosen via the smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers configuration
       parameter, see there for syntax details. See smtp_tls_policy_maps for information  on  how  to  configure
       ciphers on a per-destination basis.

       This   feature  is  available  in  Postfix  2.6  and  later.  With  earlier  Postfix  releases  only  the
       smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers parameter is implemented, and opportunistic TLS always uses "export" or better
       (i.e. all) ciphers.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_connection_reuse</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Try to make multiple deliveries per TLS-encrypted connection.   This  uses  the  <b><a href="../man8/tlsproxy.8.html">tlsproxy</a></b>(8)  service  to
       encrypt  an SMTP connection, uses the <b><a href="../man8/scache.8.html">scache</a></b>(8) service to save that connection, and relies on hints from
       the <b><a href="../man8/qmgr.8.html">qmgr</a></b>(8) daemon.

       See "Client-side TLS connection reuse" for background details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.4 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_dane_insecure_mx_policy</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>dane)</b></h4><pre>
       The TLS policy for MX hosts with "secure" TLSA records when the nexthop  destination  security  level  is
       <b>dane</b>, but the MX record was found via an "insecure" MX lookup.  The choices are:

       <b>may</b>    The  TLSA  records  will  be  ignored and TLS will be optional.  If the MX host does not appear to
              support STARTTLS, or the STARTTLS handshake fails, mail may be sent in the clear.

       <b>encrypt</b>
              The TLSA records will signal a requirement to use TLS.  While TLS  encryption  will  be  required,
              authentication will not be performed.

       <b>dane</b>   The  TLSA records will be used just as with "secure" MX records.  TLS encryption will be required,
              and, if at least one of the TLSA records is  "usable",  authentication  will  be  required.   When
              authentication  succeeds, it will be logged only as "Trusted", not "Verified", because the MX host
              name could have been forged.
              The default setting is "dane" as of Postfix versions 3.6.17, 3.7.13,  3.8.8,  3.9.2,  and  3.10.0.
              With earlier versions the default was mistakenly dependent on the smtp_tls_security_level setting.

       Though  with "insecure" MX records an active attacker can compromise SMTP transport security by returning
       forged MX records, such attacks are "tamper-evident" since any forged MX hostnames will  be  recorded  in
       the  mail  logs.   Attackers  who  place  a  high value on staying hidden may be deterred from forging MX
       records.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.1 and later. The <b>may</b> policy is backwards-compatible  with  earlier
       Postfix versions.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_dcert_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       File  with the Postfix SMTP client DSA certificate in PEM format.  This file may also contain the Postfix
       SMTP client private DSA key.  The DSA algorithm is obsolete and should not be used.

       See the discussion under smtp_tls_cert_file for more details.

       Example:

       smtp_tls_dcert_file = /etc/postfix/client-dsa.pem

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_dkey_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtp_tls_dcert_file)</b></h4><pre>
       File with the Postfix SMTP client DSA private key in PEM format.  This file  may  be  combined  with  the
       Postfix  SMTP  client  DSA  certificate  file  specified  with $smtp_tls_dcert_file. The DSA algorithm is
       obsolete and should not be used.

       The private key must be accessible without a pass-phrase, i.e. it must not be encrypted. File permissions
       should grant read-only access to the system superuser account ("root"), and no access to anyone else.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_eccert_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       File with the Postfix SMTP client ECDSA certificate in PEM  format.   This  file  may  also  contain  the
       Postfix  SMTP  client  ECDSA private key.  With Postfix &gt;= 3.4 the preferred way to configure client keys
       and certificates is via the "smtp_tls_chain_files" parameter.

       See the discussion under smtp_tls_cert_file for more details.

       Example:

       smtp_tls_eccert_file = /etc/postfix/ecdsa-ccert.pem

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later, when Postfix is  compiled  and  linked  with  OpenSSL
       1.0.0 or later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_eckey_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtp_tls_eccert_file)</b></h4><pre>
       File  with  the  Postfix SMTP client ECDSA private key in PEM format.  This file may be combined with the
       Postfix SMTP client ECDSA certificate file specified with $smtp_tls_eccert_file.  With Postfix &gt;= 3.4 the
       preferred way to configure client keys and certificates is via the "smtp_tls_chain_files" parameter.

       The private key must be accessible without a pass-phrase, i.e. it must not be encrypted. File permissions
       should grant read-only access to the system superuser account ("root"), and no access to anyone else.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later, when Postfix is  compiled  and  linked  with  OpenSSL
       1.0.0 or later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_enable_rpk</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Request  that  remote  SMTP  servers send an RFC7250 raw public key instead of an X.509 certificate. This
       feature and the enable_rpk policy attribute are ignored when there is no raw public key  support  in  the
       local TLS implementation.

       •      At   the   "may",   "encrypt"   and   "fingerprint"   security   levels,  with  parameter  setting
              "smtp_tls_enable_rpk = yes" or with "enable_rpk = yes" in a policy entry, the Postfix SMTP  client
              will indicate in the TLS handshake that it prefers to receive a raw server public key, but it will
              still accept a server public key certificate.

       •      At  the  "fingerprint"  security level, with parameter setting "smtp_tls_enable_rpk = yes" or with
              "enable_rpk = yes" in a policy entry, server  authentication  based  on  certificate  fingerprints
              becomes more fragile.  Even if the server private key and certificate remain unchanged, the remote
              SMTP server will fail fingerprint authentication (won't match the configured list of fingerprints)
              when  it starts sending a raw public key instead of a certificate, after its TLS implementation is
              updated with raw public key  support.   Therefore,  <b>DO</b>  <b>NOT</b>  enable  raw  public  keys  to  remote
              destinations  authenticated by server <b>certificate</b> fingerprints.  You should enable raw public keys
              only for servers matched via their public key fingerprint.

       •      At the "verify" and "secure" security levels, the Postfix SMTP client always ignores the parameter
              setting smtp_tls_enable_rpk or the enable_rpk policy attribute.

       •      At the opportunistic "dane" security level, the Postfix SMTP client ignores the parameter  setting
              smtp_tls_enable_rpk  or  the  enable_rpk  policy attribute (but it will respect them when it falls
              back to the "may" or "encrypt" level). When all valid TLSA records specify only server public keys
              (no certificates) and the local TLS implementation supports  raw  public  keys,  the  client  will
              indicate  in  the  TLS  handshake  that  it prefers to receive a raw public key, but it will still
              accept a public key certificate.

       •      At the mandatory "dane-only" security level, the Postfix SMTP client always ignores the  parameter
              setting  smtp_tls_enable_rpk  or  the  enable_rpk  policy  attribute.  When all valid TLSA records
              specify only server public keys (no certificates) and the local TLS  implementation  supports  raw
              public keys, the client will indicate in the TLS handshake that it prefers to receive a raw public
              key, but it will still accept a public key certificate.

       The  Postfix  SMTP  client  is always willing to send raw public keys to servers that solicit them when a
       client certificate is configured and the local TLS implementation supports raw public keys.

       Sample commands to compute certificate and public key SHA256 digests:

           openssl dgst -sha256 -c

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.9 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_enforce_peername</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       With mandatory TLS encryption, require that the remote SMTP server hostname matches  the  information  in
       the  remote  SMTP  server  certificate.   As  of  RFC 2487 the requirements for hostname checking for MTA
       clients are not specified.

       This option can be set to "no" to disable strict peer name  checking.  This  setting  has  no  effect  on
       sessions that are controlled via the smtp_tls_per_site table.

       Disabling the hostname verification can make sense in a closed environment where special CAs are created.
       If  not  used  carefully, this option opens the danger of a "man-in-the-middle" attack (the CommonName of
       this attacker will be logged).

       This  feature  is  available  in  Postfix   2.2   and   later.   With   Postfix   2.3   and   later   use
       smtp_tls_security_level instead.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       List  of  ciphers or cipher types to exclude from the Postfix SMTP client cipher list at all TLS security
       levels. This is not an OpenSSL cipherlist, it is a simple list separated by whitespace and/or commas. The
       elements are a single cipher, or one or more "+" separated cipher properties, in which case only  ciphers
       matching <b>all</b> the properties are excluded.

       Examples (some of these will cause problems):

           smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers = aNULL
           smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers = MD5, DES
           smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers = DES+MD5
           smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers = AES256-SHA, DES-CBC3-MD5
           smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers = kEDH+aRSA

       The  first  setting disables anonymous ciphers. The next setting disables ciphers that use the MD5 digest
       algorithm or the (single) DES encryption algorithm. The next setting disables ciphers that  use  MD5  and
       DES  together.   The  next  setting  disables  the  two ciphers "AES256-SHA" and "DES-CBC3-MD5". The last
       setting disables ciphers that use "EDH" key exchange with RSA authentication.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_fingerprint_cert_match</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       List of acceptable remote SMTP server certificate fingerprints for the "fingerprint" TLS  security  level
       (<b>smtp_tls_security_level</b>  = fingerprint). At this security level, Certification Authorities are not used,
       and certificate expiration times are ignored. Instead, server  certificates  are  verified  directly  via
       their  certificate  fingerprint  or  public key fingerprint (Postfix 2.9 and later). The fingerprint is a
       message digest of the server certificate (or public key).  The  digest  algorithm  is  selected  via  the
       <b>smtp_tls_fingerprint_digest</b> parameter.

       The  colons  between  each  pair of nibbles in the fingerprint value are optional (Postfix &gt;= 3.6). These
       were required in earlier Postfix releases.

       When an <b>smtp_tls_policy_maps</b>  table  entry  specifies  the  "fingerprint"  security  level,  any  "match"
       attributes  in  that  entry  specify  the  list  of valid fingerprints for the corresponding destination.
       Multiple fingerprints can be combined with a "|" delimiter in a single match attribute, or multiple match
       attributes can be employed.

       Example: Certificate fingerprint verification with  internal  mailhub.   Two  matching  fingerprints  are
       listed.  The  relayhost  may  be  multiple  physical  hosts  behind  a  load-balancer,  each with its own
       private/public key and self-signed certificate. Alternatively, a single relayhost may be in  the  process
       of  switching from one set of private/public keys to another, and both keys are trusted just prior to the
       transition.

           relayhost = [mailhub.example.com]
           smtp_tls_security_level = fingerprint
           smtp_tls_fingerprint_digest = sha256
           smtp_tls_fingerprint_cert_match =
               cd:fc:d8:db:f8:c4:82:96:6c:...:28:71:e8:f5:8d:a5:0d:9b:d4:a6
               dd:5c:ef:f5:c3:bc:64:25:36:...:99:36:06:ce:40:ef:de:2e:ad:a4

       Example: Certificate fingerprint verification with selected destinations.  As in the  example  above,  we
       show two matching fingerprints:

           /etc/postfix/main.cf:
               smtp_tls_policy_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/tls_policy
               smtp_tls_fingerprint_digest = sha256

           /etc/postfix/tls_policy:
               example.com fingerprint
                   match=51:e9:af:2e:1e:40:1f:...:64:0a:30:35:2d:09:16:31:5a:eb:82:76
                   match=b6:b4:72:34:e2:59:cd:...:c2:ca:63:0d:4d:cc:2c:7d:84:de:e6:2f

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_fingerprint_digest</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The  message  digest  algorithm  used  to  construct  remote SMTP server certificate fingerprints. At the
       "fingerprint" TLS security level (<b>smtp_tls_security_level</b>  =  fingerprint),  the  server  certificate  is
       verified  by directly matching its certificate fingerprint or its public key fingerprint (Postfix 2.9 and
       later). The fingerprint is the message digest of the server certificate (or its  public  key)  using  the
       selected  algorithm.  With a digest algorithm resistant to "second pre-image" attacks, it is not feasible
       to create a new public key and a matching certificate (or public/private  key-pair)  that  has  the  same
       fingerprint.

       The  default  algorithm  is  <b>sha256</b> with Postfix &gt;= 3.6 and the <b>compatibility_level</b> set to 3.6 or higher.
       With Postfix &lt;= 3.5, the default algorithm is <b>md5</b>.

       The best-practice algorithm is now <b>sha256</b>. Recent advances in hash function cryptanalysis have led to md5
       and sha1 being deprecated in favor of sha256.  However, as long as there are no known "second  pre-image"
       attacks  against the older algorithms, their use in this context, though not recommended, is still likely
       safe.

       While additional digest algorithms are often available with  OpenSSL's  libcrypto,  only  those  used  by
       libssl  in  SSL cipher suites are available to Postfix.  You'll likely find support for md5, sha1, sha256
       and sha512.

       To find the fingerprint of a specific certificate file, with a specific digest algorithm, run:

           $ openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -<u>digest</u> -in <u>certfile</u>.pem

       The text to the right of the "=" sign is the desired fingerprint.  For example:

           $ openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -in cert.pem
           SHA256 Fingerprint=D4:6A:AB:19:24:...:BB:A6:CB:66:82:C0:8E:9B:EE:29:A8:1A

       To extract the public key fingerprint from an X.509 certificate, you need to extract the public key  from
       the  certificate  and  compute  the  appropriate  digest  of  its  DER (ASN.1) encoding. With OpenSSL the
       "-pubkey" option of the "x509" command extracts the public key always in "PEM" format. We pipe the result
       to another OpenSSL command that converts the key to DER and then to the "dgst"  command  to  compute  the
       fingerprint.

       The  actual  command  to  transform  the  key to DER format depends on the version of OpenSSL used. As of
       OpenSSL 1.0.0, the "pkey" command supports all key types.

           # OpenSSL &gt;= 1.0 with SHA-256 fingerprints.
           $ openssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -pubkey |
               openssl pkey -pubin -outform DER |
               openssl dgst -sha256 -c
           (stdin)= 64:3f:1f:f6:e5:1e:d4:2a:56:...:fc:09:1a:61:98:b5:bc:7c:60:58

       The Postfix SMTP server and client log the  peer  (leaf)  certificate  fingerprint  and  the  public  key
       fingerprint when the TLS loglevel is 2 or higher.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_force_insecure_host_tlsa_lookup</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Lookup the associated DANE TLSA RRset even when a hostname is not an alias and its address records lie in
       an unsigned zone.  This is unlikely to ever yield DNSSEC validated results, since child zones of unsigned
       zones  are  also  unsigned  in  the  absence  of  DLV  or  locally configured non-root trust-anchors.  We
       anticipate that such mechanisms will not be used for just the "_tcp" subdomain of  a  host.   Suppressing
       the TLSA RRset lookup reduces latency and avoids potential interoperability problems with nameservers for
       unsigned zones that are not prepared to handle the new TLSA RRset.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.11.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_key_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtp_tls_cert_file)</b></h4><pre>
       File  with  the  Postfix  SMTP  client RSA private key in PEM format.  This file may be combined with the
       Postfix SMTP client RSA certificate file specified with $smtp_tls_cert_file.  With  Postfix  &gt;=  3.4  the
       preferred way to configure client keys and certificates is via the "smtp_tls_chain_files" parameter.

       The private key must be accessible without a pass-phrase, i.e. it must not be encrypted. File permissions
       should grant read-only access to the system superuser account ("root"), and no access to anyone else.

       Example:

       smtp_tls_key_file = $smtp_tls_cert_file

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_loglevel</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable  additional  Postfix  SMTP  client  logging of TLS activity.  Each logging level also includes the
       information that is logged at a lower logging level.

              0 Disable logging of TLS activity.

              1 Log only a summary message on TLS handshake completion  -  no  logging  of  remote  SMTP  server
              certificate  trust-chain  verification  errors if server certificate verification is not required.
              With Postfix 2.8 and  earlier,  log  the  summary  message  and  unconditionally  log  trust-chain
              verification errors.

              2 Also enable verbose logging in the Postfix TLS library, log session cache operations, and enable
              OpenSSL logging of the progress of the SSL handshake.

              3 Also log the hexadecimal and ASCII dump of the TLS negotiation process.

              4 Also log the hexadecimal and ASCII dump of complete transmission after STARTTLS.

       Do  not  use  "smtp_tls_loglevel = 2" or higher except in case of problems. Use of loglevel 4 is strongly
       discouraged.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>medium)</b></h4><pre>
       The minimum TLS cipher grade that the Postfix SMTP client will use with mandatory  TLS  encryption.   The
       default  value  "medium" is suitable for most destinations with which you may want to enforce TLS, and is
       beyond the reach of today's cryptanalytic methods. See smtp_tls_policy_maps for  information  on  how  to
       configure ciphers on a per-destination basis.

       The following cipher grades are supported:

       <b>high</b>   Enable  only "HIGH" grade OpenSSL ciphers.  This setting may be appropriate when all mandatory TLS
              destinations (e.g. when all mail is routed to a suitably capable relayhost) support at  least  one
              "HIGH"   grade  cipher.  The  underlying  cipherlist  is  specified  via  the  tls_high_cipherlist
              configuration parameter, which you are strongly encouraged not to change.

       <b>medium</b> Enable "MEDIUM" grade or better OpenSSL ciphers.  The underlying cipherlist is specified  via  the
              tls_medium_cipherlist configuration parameter, which you are strongly encouraged not to change.

       <b>null</b>   Enable  only  the  "NULL"  OpenSSL ciphers, these provide authentication without encryption.  This
              setting is only appropriate in the rare case that all servers are prepared  to  use  NULL  ciphers
              (not  normally  enabled  in  TLS  servers).  A plausible use-case is an LMTP server listening on a
              UNIX-domain socket that is configured to support "NULL"  ciphers.  The  underlying  cipherlist  is
              specified  via  the tls_null_cipherlist configuration parameter, which you are strongly encouraged
              not to change.

       <b>low</b>    Enable "LOW" grade or stronger OpenSSL ciphers.  In Postfix &gt;= 3.8 this  cipher  grade  is  always
              identical  to  "medium".   Recent  versions of OpenSSL do not support any "LOW" grade ciphers.  In
              earlier Postfix releases the  underlying  cipherlist  was  specified  via  the  tls_low_cipherlist
              configuration  parameter,  which  you are strongly encouraged not to change.  This obsolete cipher
              grade SHOULD NOT be used.

       <b>export</b> Enable "EXPORT" grade or stronger OpenSSL ciphers.  In Postfix &gt;= 3.8 this cipher grade is  always
              identical  to "medium".  Recent versions of OpenSSL do not support any "EXPORT" grade ciphers.  In
              earlier Postfix releases the underlying cipherlist was  specified  via  the  tls_export_cipherlist
              configuration  parameter,  which  you are strongly encouraged not to change.  This obsolete cipher
              grade SHOULD NOT be used.

       The underlying cipherlists for grades  other  than  "null"  include  anonymous  ciphers,  but  these  are
       automatically  filtered  out if the Postfix SMTP client is configured to verify server certificates.  You
       are very unlikely to need to take any steps to exclude anonymous ciphers, they are excluded automatically
       as necessary.  If you must exclude anonymous ciphers at the "may" or "encrypt" security levels, when  the
       Postfix  SMTP  client  does not need or use peer certificates, set "smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers = aNULL". To
       exclude anonymous ciphers only when TLS is enforced, set "smtp_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers = aNULL".

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Additional list of ciphers or cipher types to exclude  from  the  Postfix  SMTP  client  cipher  list  at
       mandatory   TLS   security   levels.   This  list  works  in  addition  to  the  exclusions  listed  with
       smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers (see there for syntax details).

       Starting with Postfix 2.6, the mandatory cipher exclusions can be specified on  a  per-destination  basis
       via the TLS policy "exclude" attribute. See smtp_tls_policy_maps for notes and examples.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       TLS protocols that the Postfix SMTP client will use with mandatory TLS encryption.  In main.cf the values
       are  separated  by  whitespace,  commas  or  colons.  In  the  policy  table  "protocols"  attribute (see
       smtp_tls_policy_maps) the only valid separator is colon. An empty value means allow all protocols.

       The valid protocol names (see <b><a href="../man3/SSL_get_version.3.html">SSL_get_version</a></b>(3)) are "SSLv2", "SSLv3", "TLSv1", "TLSv1.1", "TLSv1.2" and
       "TLSv1.3".  Starting with Postfix 3.6, the default value is "&gt;=TLSv1", which sets TLS 1.0 as  the  lowest
       supported  TLS protocol version (see below).  Older releases use the "!" exclusion syntax, also described
       below.

       As of Postfix 3.6, the preferred way to limit the range of  acceptable  protocols  is  to  set  a  lowest
       acceptable TLS protocol version and/or a highest acceptable TLS protocol version.  To set the lower bound
       include  an  element  of  the  form:  "&gt;=<u>version</u>" where <u>version</u> is a either one of the TLS protocol names
       listed above, or a hexadecimal number corresponding to the desired TLS protocol  version  (0301  for  TLS
       1.0, 0302 for TLS 1.1, etc.).  For the upper bound, use "&lt;=<u>version</u>".  There must be no whitespace between
       the "&gt;=" or "&lt;=" symbols and the protocol name or number.

       Hexadecimal  protocol numbers make it possible to specify protocol bounds for TLS versions that are known
       to OpenSSL, but might not be known to Postfix.  They cannot be used with  the  legacy  exclusion  syntax.
       Leading  "0"  or  "0x"  prefixes  are supported, but not required.  Therefore, "301", "0301", "0x301" and
       "0x0301" are all equivalent to "TLSv1".  Hexadecimal versions unknown to OpenSSL will  fail  to  set  the
       upper  or  lower  bound,  and  a  warning  will be logged.  Hexadecimal versions should only be used when
       Postfix is linked with some future version of OpenSSL that supports TLS 1.4 or later,  but  Postfix  does
       not yet support a symbolic name for that protocol version.

       Hexadecimal example (Postfix &gt;= 3.6):

           # Allow only TLS 1.2 through (hypothetical) TLS 1.4, once supported
           # in some future version of OpenSSL (presently a warning is logged).
           smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols = &gt;=TLSv1.2, &lt;=0305
           # Allow only TLS 1.2 and up:
           smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols = &gt;=0x0303

       With  Postfix  &lt;  3.6  there  is  no  support for a minimum or maximum version, and the protocol range is
       configured via protocol exclusions.  To require at least TLS  1.0,  set  "smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols  =
       !SSLv2,  !SSLv3".  Listing  the protocols to include, rather than the protocols to exclude, is supported,
       but not recommended.  The exclusion syntax more accurately matches the underlying OpenSSL interface.

       When using the exclusion syntax, take care to ensure that the range of protocols supported by the Postfix
       SMTP client is contiguous.  When a protocol version is enabled, disabling any higher  version  implicitly
       disables all versions above that higher version.  Thus, for example:

           smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3, !TLSv1.1

       also disables any protocol versions higher than TLSv1.1 leaving only "TLSv1" enabled.

       Support  for  "TLSv1.3"  was  introduced  in  OpenSSL  1.1.1.   Disabling this protocol via "!TLSv1.3" is
       supported since Postfix 3.4 (or patch releases &gt;= 3.0.14, 3.1.10, 3.2.7 and 3.3.2).

       While the vast majority of SMTP servers with DANE TLSA records now support at least TLS 1.2, a few  still
       only  support  TLS 1.0.  If you use "dane" or "dane-only" it is best not to disable TLSv1, except perhaps
       via the policy table for destinations which you are sure will support "TLSv1.2".

       See the documentation of the smtp_tls_policy_maps parameter and TLS_README  for  more  information  about
       security levels.

       Example:
       # Preferred syntax with Postfix &gt;= 3.6:
       smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols = &gt;=TLSv1.2, &lt;=TLSv1.3
       # Legacy syntax:
       smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3, !TLSv1, !TLSv1.1

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_note_starttls_offer</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Log  the  hostname of a remote SMTP server that offers STARTTLS, when TLS is not already enabled for that
       server.

       The logfile record looks like:

       postfix/smtp[pid]:  Host offered STARTTLS: [name.of.host]

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_per_site</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional lookup tables with the Postfix SMTP client TLS usage  policy  by  next-hop  destination  and  by
       remote  SMTP  server hostname.  When both lookups succeed, the more specific per-site policy (NONE, MUST,
       etc.) overrides the less specific one (MAY), and the more secure per-site policy (MUST,  etc.)  overrides
       the  less  secure  one (NONE).  With Postfix 2.3 and later smtp_tls_per_site is strongly discouraged: use
       smtp_tls_policy_maps instead.

       Use of the bare hostname as the per-site table lookup key is discouraged. Always use the full destination
       nexthop (enclosed in [] with a possible ":port" suffix).  A  recipient  domain  or  MX-enabled  transport
       next-hop with no port suffix may look like a bare hostname, but is still a suitable <u>destination</u>.

       Specify  a  next-hop  destination or server hostname on the left-hand side; no wildcards are allowed. The
       next-hop destination is either the recipient domain, or the destination  specified  with  a  <b><a href="../man5/transport.5.html">transport</a></b>(5)
       table,  the relayhost parameter, or the relay_transport parameter.  On the right hand side specify one of
       the following keywords:

       NONE   Don't use TLS at all. This overrides a less specific <b>MAY</b> lookup result from the alternate host  or
              next-hop   lookup   key,   and   overrides   the   global   smtp_use_tls,   smtp_enforce_tls,  and
              smtp_tls_enforce_peername settings.

       MAY    Try to use TLS if the server announces support, otherwise use an unencrypted connection;  after  a
              failed  TLS  handshake  or  TLS  session,  fall  back  to  plaintext  if  the  message  has  spent
              minimal_backoff_time in the mail queue. This level has less precedence than a more specific result
              (including <b>NONE</b>) from the alternate host or next-hop lookup key, and has less precedence than  the
              more specific global "smtp_enforce_tls = yes" or "smtp_tls_enforce_peername = yes".

       MUST_NOPEERMATCH
              Require  TLS  encryption,  but  do  not  require  that the remote SMTP server hostname matches the
              information in the remote SMTP server certificate, or that the server certificate was issued by  a
              trusted  CA.  This  overrides  a  less  secure  <b>NONE</b> or a less specific <b>MAY</b> lookup result from the
              alternate host or next-hop lookup key, and overrides the global smtp_use_tls, smtp_enforce_tls and
              smtp_tls_enforce_peername settings.

       MUST   Require TLS encryption, require that the remote SMTP server hostname matches  the  information  in
              the remote SMTP server certificate, and require that the remote SMTP server certificate was issued
              by  a  trusted  CA.  This  overrides a less secure <b>NONE</b> or <b>MUST_NOPEERMATCH</b> or a less specific <b>MAY</b>
              lookup result  from  the  alternate  host  or  next-hop  lookup  key,  and  overrides  the  global
              smtp_use_tls, smtp_enforce_tls and smtp_tls_enforce_peername settings.

       The  above  keywords  correspond to the "none", "may", "encrypt" and "verify" security levels for the new
       smtp_tls_security_level parameter introduced in Postfix 2.3. Starting with Postfix 2.3, and independently
       of  how  the  policy  is  specified,  the  smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers  and   smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols
       parameters apply when TLS encryption is mandatory. Connections for which encryption is optional typically
       enable all "export" grade and better ciphers (see smtp_tls_ciphers and smtp_tls_protocols).

       As  long  as  no  secure  DNS lookup mechanism is available, false hostnames in MX or CNAME responses can
       change the server hostname that Postfix uses for TLS policy lookup and server  certificate  verification.
       Even  with  a perfect match between the server hostname and the server certificate, there is no guarantee
       that Postfix is connected to the right server.  See TLS_README (Closing  a  DNS  loophole  with  obsolete
       per-site TLS policies) for a possible work-around.

       This  feature  is available in Postfix 2.2 and later. With Postfix 2.3 and later use smtp_tls_policy_maps
       instead.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_policy_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional lookup tables with the Postfix SMTP client TLS security policy by next-hop destination;  when  a
       non-empty  value  is  specified, this overrides the obsolete smtp_tls_per_site parameter.  See TLS_README
       for a more detailed discussion of TLS security levels, and see TLSRPT_README for additional configuration
       that may be needed for MTA-STS plugins.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.

       The TLS policy table is indexed by the full next-hop destination, which is either the  recipient  domain,
       or  the  verbatim  next-hop  specified  in  the  transport  table,  $local_transport, $virtual_transport,
       $relay_transport or $default_transport. This includes any enclosing square brackets and  any  non-default
       destination  server  port  suffix.  The  LMTP  socket type prefix (inet: or unix:) is not included in the
       lookup key.

       Only the next-hop domain, or $myhostname with LMTP over UNIX-domain sockets, is used as the nexthop  name
       for  certificate  verification.  The  port and any enclosing square brackets are used in the table lookup
       key, but are not used for server name verification.

       When the lookup key is a domain name without enclosing square brackets or any <u>:port</u> suffix (typically the
       recipient domain), and the full domain is not found in the table, just as with  the  <b><a href="../man5/transport.5.html">transport</a></b>(5)  table,
       the  parent  domain  starting  with  a  leading  "." is matched recursively. This allows one to specify a
       security policy for a recipient domain and all its sub-domains.

       The lookup result is a security level, followed by an optional list of whitespace and/or comma  separated
       name=value  attributes  that  override  related  main.cf  settings.  The  TLS security levels in order of
       increasing security are:

       <b>none</b>   No TLS. No additional attributes are supported at this level.

       <b>may</b>    Opportunistic TLS. Since sending in the clear is acceptable, demanding stronger than  default  TLS
              security  merely  reduces  interoperability.  The  optional  "ciphers", "exclude", and "protocols"
              attributes (available for opportunistic TLS with Postfix &gt;= 2.6) and "connection_reuse"  attribute
              (Postfix     &gt;=     3.4)     override    the    "smtp_tls_ciphers",    "smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers",
              "smtp_tls_protocols", and "smtp_tls_connection_reuse"  configuration  parameters.  In  the  policy
              table,  multiple  ciphers, protocols or excluded ciphers must be separated by colons, as attribute
              values may not contain whitespace or commas.  At this level and higher, the optional  "servername"
              attribute  (available  with  Postfix &gt;= 3.4) overrides the global "smtp_tls_servername" parameter,
              enabling per-destination configuration of the SNI extension sent to the remote SMTP  server.   The
              optional  "enable_rpk"  attribute  (Postfix  &gt;=  3.9)  overrides  the  main.cf smtp_tls_enable_rpk
              parameter.  When opportunistic TLS handshakes  fail,  Postfix  retries  the  connection  with  TLS
              disabled.  This allows mail delivery to sites with non-interoperable TLS implementations.

       <b>encrypt</b>
              Mandatory TLS encryption. Mail is delivered only if the remote SMTP server offers STARTTLS and the
              TLS handshake succeeds. At this level and higher, the optional "protocols" attribute overrides the
              main.cf  smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols  parameter,  the  optional "ciphers" attribute overrides the
              main.cf smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers parameter, the optional "exclude" attribute  (Postfix  &gt;=  2.6)
              overrides   the   main.cf   smtp_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers   parameter,   and   the   optional
              "connection_reuse" attribute (Postfix &gt;=  3.4)  overrides  the  main.cf  smtp_tls_connection_reuse
              parameter.  In the policy table, multiple ciphers, protocols or excluded ciphers must be separated
              by colons, as attribute values may not contain whitespace or commas.   The  optional  "enable_rpk"
              attribute (Postfix &gt;= 3.9) overrides the main.cf smtp_tls_enable_rpk parameter.

       <b>dane</b>   Opportunistic  DANE  TLS.   The  TLS  policy  for  the destination is obtained via TLSA records in
              DNSSEC.  If no TLSA records are found, the effective security level used is may.  If TLSA  records
              are found, but none are usable, the effective security level is encrypt.  When usable TLSA records
              are  obtained for the remote SMTP server, the server certificate must match the TLSA records.  RFC
              7672 (DANE) TLS authentication and DNSSEC support is available with Postfix 2.11  and  later.  The
              optional    "connection_reuse"    attribute    (Postfix    &gt;=    3.4)    overrides   the   main.cf
              smtp_tls_connection_reuse parameter.  When the effective security level used is may, the  optional
              "ciphers", "exclude", and "protocols" attributes (Postfix &gt;= 2.6) override the "smtp_tls_ciphers",
              "smtp_tls_exclude_ciphers", and "smtp_tls_protocols" configuration parameters.  When the effective
              security  level  used  is  encrypt,  the optional "ciphers", "exclude", and "protocols" attributes
              (Postfix &gt;= 2.6) override the "smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers",  "smtp_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers",
              and "smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols" configuration parameters.

       <b>dane-only</b>
              Mandatory  DANE  TLS.   The TLS policy for the destination is obtained via TLSA records in DNSSEC.
              If no TLSA records are found, or none are usable, no connection  is  made  to  the  server.   When
              usable TLSA records are obtained for the remote SMTP server, the server certificate must match the
              TLSA  records.   RFC  7672  (DANE) TLS authentication and DNSSEC support is available with Postfix
              2.11 and later. The optional "ciphers", "exclude", and "protocols"  attributes  (Postfix  &gt;=  2.6)
              override     the     "smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers",    "smtp_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers",    and
              "smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols" configuration parameters. The optional "connection_reuse" attribute
              (Postfix &gt;= 3.4) overrides the main.cf smtp_tls_connection_reuse parameter.

       <b>fingerprint</b>
              Certificate fingerprint verification. Available with Postfix  2.5  and  later.  At  this  security
              level,  there  are  no  trusted Certification Authorities. The certificate trust chain, expiration
              date, ... are not checked. Instead, the optional policy  table  "match"  attribute,  or  else  the
              main.cf  <b>smtp_tls_fingerprint_cert_match</b>  parameter,  lists  the  certificate  fingerprints or the
              public key fingerprints (Postfix 2.9 and later) of  acceptable  server  certificates.  The  digest
              algorithm  used  to  calculate  the  fingerprint  is  selected  by the <b>smtp_tls_fingerprint_digest</b>
              parameter. Multiple fingerprints can be combined with a "|" delimiter in a single match attribute,
              or multiple match attributes can be employed. The ":" character is not used as a delimiter  as  it
              occurs  between  each pair of fingerprint (hexadecimal) digits. The optional "ciphers", "exclude",
              and  "protocols"  attributes  (Postfix  &gt;=   2.6)   override   the   "smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers",
              "smtp_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers", and "smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols" configuration parameters.
              The   optional   "connection_reuse"   attribute   (Postfix   &gt;=   3.4)   overrides   the   main.cf
              smtp_tls_connection_reuse  parameter.   The  optional  "enable_rpk"  attribute  (Postfix  &gt;=  3.9)
              overrides the main.cf smtp_tls_enable_rpk parameter.

       <b>verify</b> Mandatory TLS verification.  Mail is delivered only if the TLS handshake succeeds, the remote SMTP
              server certificate chain can be validated, and a DNS name in the certificate matches the specified
              match  criteria.  At this security level, DNS MX lookups are presumed to be secure enough, and the
              name verified in the server  certificate  is  potentially  obtained  via  unauthenticated  DNS  MX
              lookups.    The  optional  "match"  attribute  overrides  the  main.cf  smtp_tls_verify_cert_match
              parameter. In the policy table, multiple match  patterns  and  strategies  must  be  separated  by
              colons.   In  practice  explicit  control  over  matching is more common with the "secure" policy,
              described below. The optional "ciphers", "exclude", and "protocols" attributes  (Postfix  &gt;=  2.6)
              override     the     "smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers",    "smtp_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers",    and
              "smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols"  configuration  parameters.  With  Postfix  &gt;=  2.11  the  optional
              "tafile"  policy  table  attribute  modifies  trust  chain  verification in the same manner as the
              "smtp_tls_trust_anchor_file" parameter. The "tafile" attribute may be specified multiple times  to
              load  multiple  trust-anchor  files.  The  optional  "connection_reuse" attribute (Postfix &gt;= 3.4)
              overrides the main.cf smtp_tls_connection_reuse parameter.

       <b>secure</b> Secure certificate verification. Mail is delivered only if the TLS handshake succeeds, the  remote
              SMTP  server  certificate  chain  can  be validated, and a DNS name in the certificate matches the
              specified match criteria.  At this security level, DNS MX  lookups,  though  potentially  used  to
              determine  the  candidate  next-hop gateway IP addresses, are <b>not</b> presumed to be secure enough for
              TLS peername verification.  Instead, the default  name  verified  in  the  server  certificate  is
              obtained directly from the next-hop, or is explicitly specified via the optional "match" attribute
              which  overrides  the  main.cf smtp_tls_secure_cert_match parameter. In the policy table, multiple
              match patterns and strategies must be separated by colons.  The match  attribute  is  most  useful
              when  multiple domains are supported by a common server: the policy entries for additional domains
              specify matching rules for the primary domain certificate. While transport  table  overrides  that
              route  the  secondary  domains  to  the  primary nexthop also allow secure verification, they risk
              delivery to the wrong destination when domains change hands or are re-assigned  to  new  gateways.
              With  the  "match"  attribute  approach,  routing  is  not  perturbed,  and  mail  is  deferred if
              verification of a new MX host fails. The optional "ciphers", "exclude", and "protocols" attributes
              (Postfix &gt;= 2.6) override the "smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers",  "smtp_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers",
              and  "smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols"  configuration  parameters.  With Postfix &gt;= 2.11 the "tafile"
              attribute  optionally  modifies  trust  chain   verification   in   the   same   manner   as   the
              "smtp_tls_trust_anchor_file" parameter.  The "tafile" attribute may be specified multiple times to
              load  multiple  trust-anchor  files.  The  optional  "connection_reuse" attribute (Postfix &gt;= 3.4)
              overrides the main.cf smtp_tls_connection_reuse parameter.

       Example:

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           smtp_tls_policy_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/tls_policy
           # Postfix 2.5 and later.
           #
           # The default digest is sha256 with Postfix &gt;= 3.6 and
           # compatibility level &gt;= 3.
           #
           smtp_tls_fingerprint_digest = sha256

       /etc/postfix/tls_policy:
           example.edu                 none
           example.mil                 may
           example.gov                 encrypt protocols=TLSv1
           example.com                 verify ciphers=high
           example.net                 secure
           .example.net                secure match=.example.net:example.net
           [mail.example.org]:587      secure match=nexthop
           # Postfix 2.5 and later
           [thumb.example.org]          fingerprint
               match=b6:b4:72:34:e2:59:cd:...:c2:ca:63:0d:4d:cc:2c:7d:84:de:e6:2f
               match=51:e9:af:2e:1e:40:1f:...:64:0a:30:35:2d:09:16:31:5a:eb:82:76

       <b>Note:</b> The "hostname" strategy if listed in a non-default setting of smtp_tls_secure_cert_match or in  the
       "match" attribute in the policy table can render the "secure" level vulnerable to DNS forgery. Do not use
       the  "hostname"  strategy  for  secure-channel  configurations  in environments where DNS security is not
       assured.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_protocols</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>'postconf</b> <b>-d'</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       TLS protocols that the Postfix SMTP client will use with opportunistic TLS encryption.   In  main.cf  the
       values  are  separated  by  whitespace,  commas or colons. In the policy table "protocols" attribute (see
       smtp_tls_policy_maps) the only valid separator is colon.  An empty value means allow all protocols.

       The valid protocol names (see <b><a href="../man3/SSL_get_version.3.html">SSL_get_version</a></b>(3)) are "SSLv2", "SSLv3", "TLSv1", "TLSv1.1", "TLSv1.2" and
       "TLSv1.3".  Starting with Postfix 3.6, the default value is "&gt;=TLSv1", which sets TLS 1.0 as  the  lowest
       supported  TLS protocol version (see below).  Older releases use the "!" exclusion syntax, also described
       below.

       As of Postfix 3.6, the preferred way to limit the range of acceptable protocols  is  to  set  the  lowest
       acceptable  TLS  protocol  version  and/or the highest acceptable TLS protocol version.  To set the lower
       bound include an element of the form: "&gt;=<u>version</u>" where <u>version</u> is either one of the TLS  protocol  names
       listed  above,  or  a  hexadecimal number corresponding to the desired TLS protocol version (0301 for TLS
       1.0, 0302 for TLS 1.1, etc.).  For the upper bound, use "&lt;=<u>version</u>".  There must be no whitespace between
       the "&gt;=" or "&lt;=" symbols and the protocol name or number.

       Hexadecimal protocol numbers make it possible to specify protocol bounds for TLS versions that are  known
       to  OpenSSL,  but  might  not be known to Postfix.  They cannot be used with the legacy exclusion syntax.
       Leading "0" or "0x" prefixes are supported, but not required.   Therefore,  "301",  "0301",  "0x301"  and
       "0x0301"  are  all  equivalent  to "TLSv1".  Hexadecimal versions unknown to OpenSSL will fail to set the
       upper or lower bound, and a warning will be logged.   Hexadecimal  versions  should  only  be  used  when
       Postfix  is  linked  with some future version of OpenSSL that supports TLS 1.4 or later, but Postfix does
       not yet support a symbolic name for that protocol version.

       Hexadecimal example (Postfix &gt;= 3.6):

           # Allow only TLS 1.0 through (hypothetical) TLS 1.4, once supported
           # in some future version of OpenSSL (presently a warning is logged).
           smtp_tls_protocols = &gt;=TLSv1, &lt;=0305
           # Allow only TLS 1.0 and up:
           smtp_tls_protocols = &gt;=0x0301

       With Postfix &lt; 3.6 there is no support for a minimum or  maximum  version,  and  the  protocol  range  is
       configured  via  protocol  exclusions.   To  require  at least TLS 1.0, set "smtp_tls_protocols = !SSLv2,
       !SSLv3".  Listing the protocols to include, rather than protocols  to  exclude,  is  supported,  but  not
       recommended.  The exclusion form more accurately matches the underlying OpenSSL interface.

       When using the exclusion syntax, take care to ensure that the range of protocols advertised by an SSL/TLS
       client  is  contiguous.   When  a  protocol  version  is enabled, disabling any higher version implicitly
       disables all versions above that higher version.  Thus, for example:

           smtp_tls_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3, !TLSv1.1
       also disables any protocols version higher than TLSv1.1 leaving only "TLSv1" enabled.

       Support for "TLSv1.3" was introduced in  OpenSSL  1.1.1.   Disabling  this  protocol  via  "!TLSv1.3"  is
       supported since Postfix 3.4 (or patch releases &gt;= 3.0.14, 3.1.10, 3.2.7 and 3.3.2).

       Example:
       # Preferred syntax with Postfix &gt;= 3.6:
       smtp_tls_protocols = &gt;=TLSv1, &lt;=TLSv1.3
       # Legacy syntax:
       smtp_tls_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_scert_verifydepth</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>9)</b></h4><pre>
       The  verification depth for remote SMTP server certificates. A depth of 1 is sufficient if the issuing CA
       is listed in a local CA file.

       The default verification depth is  9  (the  OpenSSL  default)  for  compatibility  with  earlier  Postfix
       behavior.  Prior to Postfix 2.5, the default value was 5, but the limit was not actually enforced. If you
       have set this to a lower non-default value, certificates with longer trust chains may now fail to verify.
       Certificate chains with 1 or 2 CAs are common, deeper chains are more rare and any number between 5 and 9
       should suffice in practice. You can choose a  lower  number  if,  for  example,  you  trust  certificates
       directly signed by an issuing CA but not any CAs it delegates to.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_secure_cert_match</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>nexthop,</b> <b>dot-nexthop)</b></h4><pre>
       How the Postfix SMTP client verifies the server certificate peername for the "secure" TLS security level.
       In  a  "secure"  TLS  policy table ($smtp_tls_policy_maps) entry the optional "match" attribute overrides
       this main.cf setting.

       This parameter specifies one or more patterns or strategies separated by commas,  whitespace  or  colons.
       In the policy table the only valid separator is the colon character.

       For  a  description  of the pattern and strategy syntax see the smtp_tls_verify_cert_match parameter. The
       "hostname" strategy should be avoided in this context, as in the absence of a secure  global  DNS,  using
       the results of MX lookups in certificate verification is not immune to active (man-in-the-middle) attacks
       on DNS.

       Sample main.cf setting:

           smtp_tls_secure_cert_match = nexthop

       Sample policy table override:

           example.net     secure match=example.com:.example.com
           .example.net    secure match=example.com:.example.com

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_security_level</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       The  default  SMTP  TLS security level for the Postfix SMTP client.  When a non-empty value is specified,
       this overrides the obsolete parameters  smtp_use_tls,  smtp_enforce_tls,  and  smtp_tls_enforce_peername;
       when no value is specified for smtp_tls_enforce_peername or the obsolete parameters, the default SMTP TLS
       security level is none.

       Specify one of the following security levels:

       <b>none</b>   No TLS. TLS will not be used unless enabled for specific destinations via smtp_tls_policy_maps.

       <b>may</b>    Opportunistic  TLS.  Use  TLS  if  this  is  supported  by  the  remote SMTP server, otherwise use
              plaintext; after a failed TLS handshake or TLS session, fall back to plaintext if the message  has
              spent  minimal_backoff_time in the mail queue. Since sending in the clear is acceptable, demanding
              stronger than default TLS security merely reduces interoperability.   The  "smtp_tls_ciphers"  and
              "smtp_tls_protocols"  (Postfix &gt;= 2.6) configuration parameters provide control over the protocols
              and cipher grade used with opportunistic TLS.  With earlier releases the opportunistic TLS  cipher
              grade  is always "export" and no protocols are disabled.  When TLS handshakes fail, the connection
              is retried with TLS disabled.  This allows mail  delivery  to  sites  with  non-interoperable  TLS
              implementations.

       <b>encrypt</b>
              Mandatory  TLS  encryption.  Since a minimum level of security is intended, it is reasonable to be
              specific about sufficiently secure protocol versions and  ciphers.  At  this  security  level  and
              higher, the main.cf parameters smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols and smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers specify
              the  TLS  protocols  and  minimum cipher grade which the administrator considers secure enough for
              mandatory encrypted sessions. This security level  is  not  an  appropriate  default  for  systems
              delivering mail to the Internet.

       <b>dane</b>   Opportunistic  DANE  TLS.   At this security level, the TLS policy for the destination is obtained
              via DNSSEC.  For TLSA policy to be in effect, the destination domain's containing DNS zone must be
              signed and the Postfix SMTP client's operating system must be configured to send its  DNS  queries
              to  a  recursive  DNS  nameserver that is able to validate the signed records.  Each MX host's DNS
              zone should also be signed, and should publish DANE TLSA (RFC 7672) records that specify how  that
              MX  host's TLS certificate is to be verified.  TLSA records do not preempt the normal SMTP MX host
              selection algorithm, if some MX hosts support TLSA and others do not, TLS security will vary  from
              delivery  to  delivery.   It  is  up to the domain owner to configure their MX hosts and their DNS
              sensibly.  To configure the Postfix SMTP client for DNSSEC lookups see the documentation  for  the
              smtp_dns_support_level  main.cf  parameter.   When DNSSEC-validated TLSA records are not found the
              effective tls security level is "may".  When TLSA records are found,  but  are  all  unusable  the
              effective  security level is "encrypt".  For purposes of protocol and cipher selection, the "dane"
              security level is treated like a "mandatory" TLS security level, and weak  ciphers  and  protocols
              are  disabled.   Since  DANE  authenticates  server  certificates  the  "aNULL"  cipher-suites are
              transparently excluded at this level, no need to configure this manually.   RFC  7672  (DANE)  TLS
              authentication is available with Postfix 2.11 and later.

       <b>dane-only</b>
              Mandatory  DANE  TLS.   This  is just like "dane" above, but DANE TLSA authentication is required.
              There is no fallback to "may" or "encrypt" when TLSA records are missing or  unusable.   RFC  7672
              (DANE) TLS authentication is available with Postfix 2.11 and later.

       <b>fingerprint</b>
              Certificate  fingerprint verification.  At this security level, there are no trusted Certification
              Authorities.  The certificate trust chain, expiration date, etc., are not  checked.  Instead,  the
              <b>smtp_tls_fingerprint_cert_match</b>   parameter  lists  the  certificate  fingerprint  or  public  key
              fingerprint (Postfix 2.9 and later) of the valid server certificate. The digest algorithm used  to
              calculate the fingerprint is selected by the <b>smtp_tls_fingerprint_digest</b> parameter. Available with
              Postfix 2.5 and later.

       <b>verify</b> Mandatory  TLS  verification.  At  this  security  level,  DNS MX lookups are trusted to be secure
              enough, and the name verified in  the  server  certificate  is  usually  obtained  indirectly  via
              unauthenticated  DNS  MX lookups. The smtp_tls_verify_cert_match parameter controls how the server
              name is verified. In practice explicit control over matching is more common at the "secure" level,
              described below. This security level is not an appropriate default for systems delivering mail  to
              the Internet.

       <b>secure</b> Secure-channel  TLS.  At this security level, DNS MX lookups, though potentially used to determine
              the candidate next-hop gateway IP addresses, are <b>not</b> trusted to be secure enough for TLS  peername
              verification.  Instead,  the  default name verified in the server certificate is obtained from the
              next-hop domain as  specified  in  the  smtp_tls_secure_cert_match  configuration  parameter.  The
              default  matching  rule  is  that  a  server certificate matches when its name is equal to or is a
              sub-domain of the nexthop domain. This security level is not an appropriate  default  for  systems
              delivering mail to the Internet.

       Examples:

       # No TLS. Formerly: smtp_use_tls=no and smtp_enforce_tls=no.
       smtp_tls_security_level = none

       # Opportunistic TLS.
       smtp_tls_security_level = may
       # Do not tweak opportunistic ciphers or protocols unless it is essential
       # to do so (if a security vulnerability is found in the SSL library that
       # can be mitigated by disabling a particular protocol or raising the
       # cipher grade).
       smtp_tls_ciphers = medium
       smtp_tls_protocols = &gt;=TLSv1
       # Legacy (Postfix &lt; 3.6) syntax:
       smtp_tls_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3

       # Mandatory (high-grade) TLS encryption.
       smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt
       smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers = high

       # Authenticated TLS 1.2 or better matching the nexthop domain or a
       # subdomain.
       smtp_tls_security_level = secure
       smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers = high
       smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols = &gt;=TLSv1.2
       smtp_tls_secure_cert_match = nexthop, dot-nexthop

       # Certificate fingerprint verification (Postfix &gt;= 2.5).
       # The CA-less "fingerprint" security level only scales to a limited
       # number of destinations. As a global default rather than a per-site
       # setting, this is practical only when mail for all recipients is sent
       # to a central mail hub.
       relayhost = [mailhub.example.com]
       smtp_tls_security_level = fingerprint
       smtp_tls_mandatory_protocols = &gt;=TLSv1.2
       smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers = high
       smtp_tls_fingerprint_cert_match =
           3D:95:34:51:...:40:99:C0:C1
           EC:3B:2D:B0:...:A3:9D:72:F6

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_servername</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  name  to send to the remote SMTP server in the TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) extension.  The
       SNI extension is always on when DANE is used to authenticate the server, and in that case  the  SNI  name
       sent is the one required by RFC7672 and this parameter is ignored.

       Some  SMTP servers use the received SNI name to select an appropriate certificate chain to present to the
       client.  While this may improve interoperability with such servers, it may reduce  interoperability  with
       other servers that choose to abort the connection when they don't have a certificate chain configured for
       the  requested  name.  Such servers should select a default certificate chain and continue the handshake,
       but some may not.  Therefore, absent DANE, no SNI name is sent by default.

       The SNI name must be either a valid DNS hostname, or else one of the special values <b>hostname</b> or  <b>nexthop</b>,
       which select either the remote hostname or the nexthop domain respectively.  DNS names for SNI must be in
       A-label  (punycode)  form.   Invalid  DNS  names  log  a configuration error warning and mail delivery is
       deferred.

       Except when using a relayhost to forward all email, the only sensible non-empty main.cf setting for  this
       parameter  is  <b>hostname</b>.   Other  non-empty  values are only practical on a per-destination basis via the
       <b>servername</b> attribute of the Postfix TLS policy table.  When in doubt, leave  this  parameter  empty,  and
       configure per-destination SNI as needed.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.4 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_session_cache_database</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Name  of  the file containing the optional Postfix SMTP client TLS session cache. Specify a database type
       that supports enumeration, such as <b>btree</b> or <b>sdbm</b>; there is no need to  support  concurrent  access.   The
       file is created if it does not exist. The <b><a href="../man8/smtp.8.html">smtp</a></b>(8) daemon does not use this parameter directly, rather the
       cache  is  implemented  indirectly  in  the <b><a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html">tlsmgr</a></b>(8) daemon. This means that per-smtp-instance master.cf
       overrides of this parameter are not effective.  Note that  each  of  the  cache  databases  supported  by
       <b><a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html">tlsmgr</a></b>(8)  daemon:  $smtpd_tls_session_cache_database, $smtp_tls_session_cache_database (and with Postfix
       2.3 and later $lmtp_tls_session_cache_database), needs to be stored separately. It is not  at  this  time
       possible to store multiple caches in a single database.

       Note: <b>dbm</b> databases are not suitable. TLS session objects are too large.

       As  of version 2.5, Postfix no longer uses root privileges when opening this file. The file should now be
       stored under the Postfix-owned data_directory. As a migration aid, an attempt to open the  file  under  a
       non-Postfix directory is redirected to the Postfix-owned data_directory, and a warning is logged.

       Example:

       smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:/var/lib/postfix/smtp_scache

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_session_cache_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3600s)</b></h4><pre>
       The  expiration  time of Postfix SMTP client TLS session cache information.  A cache cleanup is performed
       periodically every $smtp_tls_session_cache_timeout  seconds.  As  with  $smtp_tls_session_cache_database,
       this parameter is implemented in the <b><a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html">tlsmgr</a></b>(8) daemon and therefore per-smtp-instance master.cf overrides
       are not possible.

       As  of  Postfix  2.11 this setting cannot exceed 100 days.  If set &lt;= 0, session caching is disabled.  If
       set to a positive value less than 2 minutes, the minimum value of 2 minutes is used instead.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_trust_anchor_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Zero or more PEM-format files with trust-anchor certificates and/or public keys.  If the parameter is not
       empty the root CAs in CAfile and CApath are no longer trusted.  Rather, the Postfix SMTP client will only
       trust certificate-chains signed by one of the trust-anchors contained in the chosen files.  The specified
       trust-anchor  certificates  and  public keys are not subject to expiration, and need not be (self-signed)
       root CAs.  They may, if desired, be intermediate certificates. Therefore, these certificates also may  be
       found  "in  the middle" of the trust chain presented by the remote SMTP server, and any untrusted issuing
       parent certificates will be ignored.  Specify a list of pathnames separated by comma or whitespace.

       Whether specified in main.cf, or on a per-destination basis, the trust-anchor PEM file must be accessible
       to the Postfix SMTP client in the chroot jail if applicable.  The trust-anchor file should  contain  only
       certificates  and  public  keys,  no  private  key  material,  and must be readable by the non-privileged
       $mail_owner user.  This allows destinations to be bound to a set of specific CAs or public  keys  without
       trusting the same CAs for all destinations.

       The main.cf parameter supports single-purpose Postfix installations that send mail to a fixed set of SMTP
       peers.  At most sites, if trust-anchor files are used at all, they will be specified on a per-destination
       basis via the "tafile" attribute of the "verify" and "secure" levels in smtp_tls_policy_maps.

       The  underlying  mechanism  is  in  support of RFC 7672 (DANE TLSA), which defines mechanisms for an SMTP
       client MTA to securely determine server TLS certificates via DNS.

       If you want your trust anchors to be public keys, with OpenSSL you can extract a single  PEM  public  key
       from a PEM X.509 file containing a single certificate, as follows:

           $ openssl x509 -in cert.pem -out ta-key.pem -noout -pubkey

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.11 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_verify_cert_match</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>hostname)</b></h4><pre>
       How the Postfix SMTP client verifies the server certificate peername for the "verify" TLS security level.
       In  a  "verify"  TLS  policy table ($smtp_tls_policy_maps) entry the optional "match" attribute overrides
       this main.cf setting.

       This parameter specifies one or more patterns or strategies separated by commas,  whitespace  or  colons.
       In the policy table the only valid separator is the colon character.

       Patterns specify domain names, or domain name suffixes:

       <u>example.com</u>
              Match the <u>example.com</u> domain, i.e. one of the names in the server certificate must be <u>example.com</u>.
              Upper and lower case distinctions are ignored.

       <u>.example.com</u>
              Match  subdomains  of  the  <u>example.com</u>  domain,  i.e. match a name in the server certificate that
              consists of a non-zero number of labels followed by a <u>.example.com</u> suffix. Case  distinctions  are
              ignored.

       Strategies  specify  a  transformation  from  the  next-hop  domain  to  the  expected name in the server
       certificate:

       nexthop
              Match against the next-hop domain, which is either the recipient domain, or the transport next-hop
              configured for the domain stripped of any optional socket type prefix, enclosing  square  brackets
              and  trailing  port. When MX lookups are not suppressed, this is the original nexthop domain prior
              to the MX lookup, not the result of the MX lookup. For LMTP delivery via UNIX-domain sockets,  the
              verified  next-hop  name  is  $myhostname.   This  strategy  is suitable for use with the "secure"
              policy. Case is ignored.

       dot-nexthop
              As above, but match server certificate names that are subdomains of the next-hop domain.  Case  is
              ignored.

       hostname
              Match against the hostname of the server, often obtained via an unauthenticated DNS MX lookup. For
              LMTP  delivery  via  UNIX-domain  sockets,  the  verified  name  is  $myhostname. This matches the
              verification strategy of the "MUST" keyword  in  the  obsolete  smtp_tls_per_site  table,  and  is
              suitable  for  use  with the "verify" security level. When the next-hop name is enclosed in square
              brackets to suppress MX lookups, the "hostname" strategy is the same as  the  "nexthop"  strategy.
              Case is ignored.

       Sample main.cf setting:

       smtp_tls_verify_cert_match = hostname, nexthop, dot-nexthop

       Sample policy table override:

       example.com     verify  match=hostname:nexthop
       .example.com    verify  match=example.com:.example.com:hostname

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tls_wrappermode</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Request  that  the  Postfix  SMTP  client connects using the SUBMISSIONS (formerly called SMTPS) protocol
       instead of using the STARTTLS command.

       This mode requires "smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt" or stronger.

       Example: deliver all remote mail via a provider's submissions service at "mail.example.com".

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           # Client-side SUBMISSIONS requires "encrypt" or stronger.
           smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt
           smtp_tls_wrappermode = yes
           # The [] suppress MX lookups.
           relayhost = [mail.example.com]:submissions

       More examples are in TLS_README, including examples for older Postfix versions.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tlsrpt_enable</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable support for RFC 8460 TLSRPT notifications. A mail receiving domain can publish a TLSRPT policy  in
       DNS,  to  request  periodic  summaries  of  successful  and  failed SMTP over TLS connections to their MX
       servers. This feature requires that Postfix is built with a TLSRPT supporting library.

       See TLSRPT_README for configuration examples and additional requirements for MTA-STS smtp_tls_policy_maps
       plugins.

       This feature is available in Postfix &gt;= 3.10.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tlsrpt_skip_reused_handshakes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Do not report the TLSRPT status for TLS  protocol  handshakes  that  reuse  a  previously-negotiated  TLS
       session  (there  is  no new information to report). Report the TLSRPT status only for "new" TLS sessions.
       Set this to "no" to log the TLSRPT status of all TLS handshakes,  for  example  to  troubleshoot  Postfix
       TLSRPT support.

       Note: if an SMTP over TLS connection is reused, there is no second etc. TLS handshake to report.

       This feature is available in Postfix &gt;= 3.10.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_tlsrpt_socket_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       The  pathname  of a UNIX-domain datagram socket that is managed by a local TLSRPT reporting service. This
       parameter must specify a pathname (absolute, or relative to $queue_directory) when "smtp_tlsrpt_enable  =
       yes".

       See TLSRPT_README for configuration examples and additional requirements for MTA-STS smtp_tls_policy_maps
       plugins.

       This feature is available in Postfix &gt;= 3.10.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_use_tls</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Opportunistic mode: use TLS when a remote SMTP server announces STARTTLS support, otherwise send the mail
       in the clear. Beware: some SMTP servers offer STARTTLS even if it is not configured.  With Postfix &lt; 2.3,
       if  the TLS handshake fails, and no other server is available, delivery is deferred and mail stays in the
       queue. If this is a concern for you, use the smtp_tls_per_site feature instead.

       This  feature  is  available  in  Postfix   2.2   and   later.   With   Postfix   2.3   and   later   use
       smtp_tls_security_level instead.

</pre><h4><b>smtp_xforward_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b></h4><pre>
       The  Postfix  SMTP  client time limit for sending the XFORWARD command, and for receiving the remote SMTP
       server response.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_authorized_verp_clients</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$authorized_verp_clients)</b></h4><pre>
       What  remote  SMTP  clients are allowed to specify the XVERP command.  This command requests that mail be
       delivered one recipient at a time with a per recipient return address.

       By default, no clients are allowed to specify XVERP.

       This parameter was renamed with Postfix version 2.1. The  default  value  is  backwards  compatible  with
       Postfix version 2.0.

       Specify a list of network/netmask patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. The mask specifies the
       number  of  bits  in  the network part of a host address. You can also specify hostnames or .domain names
       (the initial dot causes the domain to match any name below it),  "/file/name" or  "type:table"  patterns.
       A  "/file/name"  pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a table
       entry matches a lookup string (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by starting  the  next
       line  with  whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude an address or network block from the list. The form
       "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       Note: IP version 6 address information must be specified inside [] in  the  smtpd_authorized_verp_clients
       value,  and  in files specified with "/file/name".  IP version 6 addresses contain the ":" character, and
       would otherwise be confused with a "type:table" pattern.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_authorized_xclient_hosts</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       What remote SMTP clients are allowed to use the XCLIENT feature.   This  command  overrides  remote  SMTP
       client  information  that  is  used  for  access  control. Typical use is for SMTP-based content filters,
       fetchmail-like programs, or SMTP server access rule testing. See the XCLIENT_README document for details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       By default, no clients are allowed to specify XCLIENT.

       Specify a list of network/netmask patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. The mask specifies the
       number of bits in the network part of a host address. You can also specify  hostnames  or  .domain  names
       (the  initial  dot causes the domain to match any name below it),  "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns.
       A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when  a  table
       entry  matches  a lookup string (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by starting the next
       line with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude an address or network block from the list.  The  form
       "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       Note:  IP version 6 address information must be specified inside [] in the smtpd_authorized_xclient_hosts
       value, and in files specified with "/file/name".  IP version 6 addresses contain the ":"  character,  and
       would otherwise be confused with a "type:table" pattern.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_authorized_xforward_hosts</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       What remote SMTP clients are allowed to use the XFORWARD feature.  This command forwards information that
       is  used  to  improve  logging  after  SMTP-based  content  filters. See the XFORWARD_README document for
       details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       By default, no clients are allowed to specify XFORWARD.

       Specify a list of network/netmask patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. The mask specifies the
       number of bits in the network part of a host address. You can also specify  hostnames  or  .domain  names
       (the  initial  dot causes the domain to match any name below it),  "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns.
       A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when  a  table
       entry  matches  a lookup string (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by starting the next
       line with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude an address or network block from the list.  The  form
       "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       Note: IP version 6 address information must be specified inside [] in the smtpd_authorized_xforward_hosts
       value,  and  in files specified with "/file/name".  IP version 6 addresses contain the ":" character, and
       would otherwise be confused with a "type:table" pattern.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_banner</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$myhostname</b> <b>ESMTP</b> <b>$mail_name)</b></h4><pre>
       The text that follows the 220 status code in the SMTP greeting banner. Some people like to see  the  mail
       version advertised. By default, Postfix shows no version.

       You MUST specify $myhostname at the start of the text. This is required by the SMTP protocol.

       <b>check_ccert_access</b> <u>type:table</u>
              By  default  use  the  remote  SMTP  client  certificate fingerprint or the public key fingerprint
              (Postfix 2.9 and later) as the lookup key for  the  specified  <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5)  database;  with  Postfix
              version  2.2,  also require that the remote SMTP client certificate is verified successfully.  The
              fingerprint digest  algorithm  is  configurable  via  the  smtpd_tls_fingerprint_digest  parameter
              (hard-coded  as  md5  prior to Postfix version 2.5).  This feature requires "smtpd_tls_ask_ccert =
              yes" and is available with Postfix version 2.2 and later.
              The default algorithm is <b>sha256</b> with Postfix &gt;= 3.6 and the  <b>compatibility_level</b>  set  to  3.6  or
              higher.  With  Postfix  &lt;=  3.5, the default algorithm is <b>md5</b>.  The best-practice algorithm is now

              Alternatively,  check_ccert_access  accepts  an explicit search order (Postfix 3.5 and later). The
              default search order as described above corresponds with:
              check_ccert_access { type:table, { search_order = cert_fingerprint, pubkey_fingerprint } }
              The commas are optional.

              The lookup key has the form "username@domainname" when the smtpd_sasl_local_domain parameter value
              is  non-empty.  Unlike the check_client_access feature, check_sasl_access does not perform matches
              of parent domains or IP subnet ranges.  This feature is available with Postfix  version  2.11  and
              later.

       <b>permit_inet_interfaces</b>
              Permit the request when the client IP address matches $inet_interfaces.

       <b>permit_mynetworks</b>
              Permit  the  request  when  the client IP address matches any network or network address listed in
              $mynetworks.

       <b>permit_sasl_authenticated</b>
              Permit the request when the client is successfully authenticated via the RFC 4954 (AUTH) protocol.

       <b>permit_tls_all_clientcerts</b>
              Permit the request when the remote SMTP client certificate is verified successfully.  This  option
              must  be used only if a special CA issues the certificates and only this CA is listed as a trusted
              CA. Otherwise, clients with a third-party certificate would also be  allowed  to  relay.   Specify
              "tls_append_default_CA   =  no"  when  the  trusted  CA  is  specified  with  smtpd_tls_CAfile  or
              smtpd_tls_CApath, to prevent Postfix from appending the system-supplied default CAs.  This feature

       <b>permit_tls_clientcerts</b>
              Permit the request when the remote SMTP client certificate fingerprint or public  key  fingerprint
              (Postfix  2.9  and  later)  is  listed in $relay_clientcerts.  The fingerprint digest algorithm is

              and  later).   If  no "<u>=d.d.d.d</u>" is specified, reject the request when the reversed client network
              address is listed with any A record under <u>rbl_domain</u>.
              The maps_rbl_reject_code parameter specifies the response code  for  rejected  requests  (default:
              554),  the default_rbl_reply  parameter specifies the default server reply, and the rbl_reply_maps
              parameter specifies tables with server replies indexed by <u>rbl_domain</u>.  This feature  is  available
              in Postfix 2.0 and later.

              Caution: client name allowlisting is fragile, since  the  client  name  lookup  can  fail  due  to
              temporary outages.  Client name allowlisting should be used only to reduce false positives in e.g.
              DNS-based blocklists, and not for making access rule exceptions.
              For    safety,    permit_rhswl_client    is    silently    ignored    when   it   would   override

              The unknown_client_reject_code  parameter  specifies  the  response  code  for  rejected  requests
              (default:  450).  The reply is always 450 in case the address-&gt;name or name-&gt;address lookup failed
              due to a temporary problem.

       <b>reject_unknown_reverse_client_hostname</b>
              Reject the request when the client IP address has no address-&gt;name mapping.
              This is a weaker restriction than the reject_unknown_client_hostname feature, which  requires  not
              only  that  the  address-&gt;name  and  name-&gt;address  mappings exist, but also that the two mappings
              reproduce the client IP address.
              The unknown_client_reject_code  parameter  specifies  the  response  code  for  rejected  requests
              (default:  450).   The  reply  is  always  450  in  case  the address-&gt;name lookup failed due to a
              temporary problem.
              This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

       In addition, you can use any of the following generic restrictions.  These restrictions are applicable in
       any SMTP command context.

       <b>check_policy_service</b> <u>servername</u>
              Query the specified policy server. See the SMTPD_POLICY_README document for details. This  feature
              is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>defer</b>  Defer the request. The client is told to try again later. This restriction is useful at the end of
              a restriction list, to make the default policy explicit.
              The defer_code parameter specifies the SMTP server reply code (default: 450).

       <b>defer_if_permit</b>
              Defer the request if some later restriction would result in an explicit or implicit PERMIT action.
              This  is  useful  when  a  denylisting  feature fails due to a temporary problem.  This feature is
              available in Postfix version 2.1 and later.

       <b>defer_if_reject</b>
              Defer the request if some later restriction would result in a REJECT action.  This is useful  when
              an  allowlisting  feature  fails due to a temporary problem.  This feature is available in Postfix
              version 2.1 and later.

       <b>permit</b> Permit the request. This restriction is useful at the end of  a  restriction  list,  to  make  the
              default policy explicit.

       <b>reject_multi_recipient_bounce</b>
              Reject  the  request  when  the  envelope sender is the null address, and the message has multiple
              envelope recipients. This usage has rare but legitimate applications:  under  certain  conditions,
              multi-recipient  mail  that  was posted with the DSN option NOTIFY=NEVER may be forwarded with the
              null sender address.
              Note:  this  restriction  can  only  work  reliably  when  used  in   smtpd_data_restrictions   or
              smtpd_end_of_data_restrictions,  because the total number of recipients is not known at an earlier
              stage of the SMTP conversation.   Use  at  the  RCPT  stage  will  only  reject  the  second  etc.
              recipient.
              The multi_recipient_bounce_reject_code parameter specifies the response code for rejected requests
              (default:  550).  This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>reject_plaintext_session</b>
              Reject  the  request  when  the  connection  is not encrypted. This restriction should not be used
              before the client has had a chance to negotiate encryption with the AUTH or STARTTLS commands.
              The plaintext_reject_code parameter specifies the response code for  rejected  requests  (default:
              450).  This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

       <b>reject_unauth_pipelining</b>
              Reject  the  request when the client sends SMTP commands ahead of time where it is not allowed, or
              when the client sends SMTP commands ahead of time without knowing that Postfix  actually  supports
              ESMTP  command  pipelining.  This  stops  mail  from bulk mail software that improperly uses ESMTP
              command pipelining in order to speed up deliveries.
              With Postfix 2.6 and later, the SMTP server sets a per-session flag whenever  it  detects  illegal
              pipelining, including pipelined HELO or EHLO commands. The reject_unauth_pipelining feature simply
              tests whether the flag was set at any point in time during the session.
              With  older Postfix versions, reject_unauth_pipelining checks the current status of the input read
              queue, and its usage is not recommended in contexts other than smtpd_data_restrictions.

       <b>reject</b> Reject the request. This restriction is useful at the end of  a  restriction  list,  to  make  the
              default  policy explicit.  The reject_code configuration parameter specifies the response code for
              rejected requests (default: 554).

       <b>sleep</b> <u>seconds</u>
              Pause for the specified number of seconds and proceed with the next restriction in  the  list,  if
              any. This may stop zombie mail when used as:
              /etc/postfix/main.cf:
                  smtpd_client_restrictions =
                      sleep 1, reject_unauth_pipelining
                  smtpd_delay_reject = no
              This feature is available in Postfix 2.3.

       <b>warn_if_reject</b>
              A safety net for testing. When "warn_if_reject" is placed before a reject-type restriction, access
              table  query,  or  check_policy_service  query,  this  logs  a "reject_warning" message instead of
              rejecting a request (when a reject-type restriction fails due to a temporary error,  this  logs  a
              "reject_warning"  message  for  any implicit "defer_if_permit" actions that would normally prevent
              mail from being accepted by some  later  access  restriction).  This  feature  has  no  effect  on
              defer_if_reject restrictions.

       Other restrictions that are valid in this context:

       •      SMTP   command  specific  restrictions  that  are  described  under  the  smtpd_helo_restrictions,
              smtpd_sender_restrictions  or  smtpd_recipient_restrictions  parameters.  When  helo,  sender   or
              recipient  restrictions  are  listed  under  smtpd_client_restrictions, they have effect only with
              "smtpd_delay_reject = yes", so that $smtpd_client_restrictions is evaluated at  the  time  of  the
              RCPT TO command.

       Example:

       smtpd_client_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject_unknown_client_hostname

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_command_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       A  mechanism  to  transform commands from remote SMTP clients.  This is a last-resort tool to work around
       client commands that break interoperability with the Postfix  SMTP  server.   Other  uses  involve  fault
       injection to test Postfix's handling of invalid commands.

       Specify  the  name of a "type:table" lookup table. The search string is the SMTP command as received from
       the remote SMTP client, except that initial whitespace and the trailing &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; are removed.  The result
       value is executed by the Postfix SMTP server.

       There is no need to use smtpd_command_filter for the following cases:

       •      Use "resolve_numeric_domain = yes" to accept "<u>user@ipaddress</u>".

       •      Postfix  already  accepts  the  correct  form  "<u>user@[ipaddress]</u>".   Use   virtual_alias_maps   or
              canonical_maps to translate these into domain names if necessary.

       •      Use  "strict_rfc821_envelopes  =  no"  to accept "RCPT TO:&lt;<u>User</u> <u>Name</u> <u>&lt;<a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a>&gt;&gt;</u>". Postfix
              will ignore the "<u>User</u> <u>Name</u>" part and deliver to the <u>&lt;<a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a>&gt;</u> address.

       Examples of problems that can be solved with the smtpd_command_filter feature:

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           smtpd_command_filter = pcre:/etc/postfix/command_filter

       /etc/postfix/command_filter:
           # Work around clients that send malformed HELO commands.
           /^HELO\s*$/ HELO domain.invalid

           # Work around clients that send empty lines.
           /^\s*$/     NOOP

           # Work around clients that send RCPT TO:&lt;'user@domain'&gt;.
           # WARNING: do not lose the parameters that follow the address.
           /^(RCPT\s+TO:\s*&lt;)'([^[:space:]]+)'(&gt;.*)/     $1$2$3

           # Append XVERP to MAIL FROM commands to request VERP-style delivery.
           # See VERP_README for more information on how to use Postfix VERP.
           /^(MAIL\s+FROM:\s*&lt;listname@example\.com&gt;.*)/   $1 XVERP

           # Bounce-never mail sink. Use notify_classes=bounce,resource,software
           # to send bounced mail to the postmaster (with message body removed).
           /^(RCPT\s+TO:\s*&lt;.*&gt;.*)\s+NOTIFY=\S+(.*)/     $1 NOTIFY=NEVER$2
           /^(RCPT\s+TO:.*)/                             $1 NOTIFY=NEVER

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.7.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_data_restrictions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional access restrictions that the Postfix SMTP server  applies  in  the  context  of  the  SMTP  DATA
       command.   See  SMTPD_ACCESS_README,  section "Delayed evaluation of SMTP access restriction lists" for a
       discussion of evaluation context and time.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       Specify a list of restrictions, separated by commas and/or whitespace.  Continue long lines  by  starting
       the next line with whitespace.  Restrictions are applied in the order as specified; the first restriction
       that matches wins.

       The following restrictions are valid in this context:

       •      Generic   restrictions   that   can   be  used  in  any  SMTP  command  context,  described  under
              smtpd_client_restrictions.

       •      SMTP    command    specific    restrictions     described     under     smtpd_client_restrictions,
              smtpd_helo_restrictions, smtpd_sender_restrictions or smtpd_recipient_restrictions.

       •      However, no recipient information is available in the case of multi-recipient mail. Acting on only
              one recipient would be misleading, because any decision will affect all recipients equally. Acting
              on  all  recipients  would  require  a  possibly  very  large  amount of memory, and would also be
              misleading for the reasons mentioned before.

       Examples:

       smtpd_data_restrictions = reject_unauth_pipelining
       smtpd_data_restrictions = reject_multi_recipient_bounce

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_delay_open_until_valid_rcpt</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Postpone the start of an SMTP mail transaction until a valid RCPT TO command is received. Specify "no" to
       create a mail transaction as soon as the Postfix SMTP server receives a valid MAIL FROM command.

       With sites that reject lots of mail, the default  setting  reduces  the  use  of  disk,  CPU  and  memory
       resources. The downside is that rejected recipients are logged with NOQUEUE instead of a mail transaction
       ID (also known as a queue ID).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_delay_reject</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Wait until the RCPT TO command before evaluating $smtpd_client_restrictions, $smtpd_helo_restrictions and
       $smtpd_sender_restrictions,  or  wait until the ETRN command before evaluating $smtpd_client_restrictions
       and $smtpd_helo_restrictions.

       This feature is turned on by default because some clients apparently mis-behave  when  the  Postfix  SMTP
       server rejects commands before RCPT TO.

       The  default  setting  has one major benefit: it allows Postfix to log recipient address information when
       rejecting a client name/address or sender address, so that it is possible to find out whose mail is being
       rejected.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Lookup tables, indexed by the remote SMTP client address, with case insensitive lists  of  EHLO  keywords
       (pipelining,  starttls,  auth, etc.) that the Postfix SMTP server will not send in the EHLO response to a
       remote SMTP client. See smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords for details.  The tables are not searched by hostname
       for robustness reasons.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       A case insensitive list of EHLO keywords (pipelining, starttls, auth, etc.) that the Postfix SMTP  server
       will not send in the EHLO response to a remote SMTP client.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

       Notes:

       •      Specify the <b>silent-discard</b> pseudo keyword to prevent this action from being logged.

       •      Use the smtpd_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps feature to discard EHLO keywords selectively.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_dns_reply_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  filter  for  Postfix  SMTP  server  DNS  lookup results.  See smtp_dns_reply_filter for details
       including an example.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_end_of_data_restrictions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional access restrictions that the Postfix SMTP server applies in the context of the SMTP  END-OF-DATA
       command.   See  SMTPD_ACCESS_README,  section "Delayed evaluation of SMTP access restriction lists" for a
       discussion of evaluation context and time.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

       See smtpd_data_restrictions for details and limitations.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_enforce_tls</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Mandatory TLS: announce STARTTLS support to remote SMTP clients, and reject all plaintext commands except
       HELO, EHLO, XCLIENT, STARTTLS, NOOP, QUIT, and (Postfix &gt;= 3.9) HELP.  According to RFC  2487  this  MUST
       NOT  be  applied  in case of a publicly-referenced SMTP server. Instead, this should be used on dedicated
       servers, for example submission (port 587). This option is therefore off by default.

       Note 1: "smtpd_enforce_tls = yes" implies "smtpd_tls_auth_only = yes".

       Note 2: when invoked via "<b>sendmail</b> <b>-bs</b>", Postfix will never offer STARTTLS due to insufficient privileges
       to access the server private key. This is intended behavior.

       This feature is deprecated as of Postfix 3.9. Specify smtpd_tls_security_level instead.

       This  feature  is  available  in  Postfix   2.2   and   later.   With   Postfix   2.3   and   later   use
       smtpd_tls_security_level instead.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_error_sleep_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1s)</b></h4><pre>
       With  Postfix  version  2.1  and  later: the SMTP server response delay after a client has made more than
       $smtpd_soft_error_limit errors, and fewer than $smtpd_hard_error_limit errors, without delivering mail.

       With Postfix version 2.0 and earlier: the SMTP  server  delay  before  sending  a  reject  (4xx  or  5xx)
       response,  when  the  client  has made fewer than $smtpd_soft_error_limit errors without delivering mail.
       When the client has made $smtpd_soft_error_limit or more errors, delay all responses with the  larger  of
       (number of errors) seconds or $smtpd_error_sleep_time.

       Specify  a  non-negative  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies
       the time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default  time
       unit is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_etrn_restrictions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  restrictions that the Postfix SMTP server applies in the context of a client ETRN command.  See
       SMTPD_ACCESS_README, section "Delayed evaluation of SMTP access restriction lists" for  a  discussion  of
       evaluation context and time.

       The  Postfix ETRN implementation accepts only destinations that are eligible for the Postfix "fast flush"
       service. See the ETRN_README file for details.

       Specify a list of restrictions, separated by commas and/or whitespace.  Continue long lines  by  starting
       the next line with whitespace.  Restrictions are applied in the order as specified; the first restriction
       that matches wins.

       The following restrictions are specific to the domain name information received with the ETRN command.

       <b>check_etrn_access</b> <u>type:table</u>
              Search  the specified access database for the ETRN domain name.  See the <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5) manual page for
              details.

       Other restrictions that are valid in this context:

       •      Generic  restrictions  that  can  be  used  in  any  SMTP   command   context,   described   under
              smtpd_client_restrictions.

       •      SMTP    command    specific    restrictions    described   under   smtpd_client_restrictions   and
              smtpd_helo_restrictions.

       Example:

       smtpd_etrn_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_expansion_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       What characters are allowed in $name expansions of RBL reply templates. Characters not in the allowed set
       are replaced by "_".  Use C like escapes to specify special characters such as whitespace.

       The smtpd_expansion_filter value is not subject to Postfix configuration parameter $name expansion.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_forbid_bare_newline</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>Postfix</b> <b>&gt;=</b> <b>3.9:</b> <b>normalize)</b></h4><pre>
       Reject or restrict input lines from an SMTP client that end in &lt;LF&gt; instead  of  the  standard  &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.
       Such  line  endings  are  commonly  allowed  with UNIX-based SMTP servers, but they violate RFC 5321, and
       allowing such line endings can make a server vulnerable to SMTP smuggling.

       Specify one of the following values (case does not matter):

       <b>normalize</b> (default for Postfix &gt;= 3.9)
              Require the standard End-of-DATA sequence &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.  Otherwise, allow command or  message
              content lines ending in the non-standard &lt;LF&gt;, and process them as if the client sent the standard
              &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.
              This  maintains  compatibility  with  many  legitimate SMTP client applications that send a mix of
              standard and non-standard line endings, but will fail to receive email from client implementations
              that do not terminate DATA content with the standard End-of-DATA sequence &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.
              Such clients can be excluded with smtpd_forbid_bare_newline_exclusions.

       <b>note</b>   Same as "normalize", but also notes in the log whether the Postfix SMTP server received any  lines
              with   "bare   &lt;LF&gt;".   The  information  is  formatted  as  "disconnect  from  name[address]  ...
              notes=bare_lf". The notes value is expected to become a list of comma-separated names.
              This feature is available in Postfix 3.9 and later.

       <b>yes</b>    Compatibility alias for <b>normalize</b>.

       <b>reject</b> Require the standard End-of-DATA sequence &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;. Reject a command or  message  content
              when  a  line contains bare &lt;LF&gt;, log a "bare &lt;LF&gt; received" error, and reply with the SMTP status
              code in $smtpd_forbid_bare_newline_reject_code.
              This will reject email from SMTP clients that send any  non-standard  line  endings  such  as  web
              applications, netcat, or load balancer health checks.
              This  will  also  reject  email  from  services  that use BDAT to send MIME text containing a bare
              newline (RFC 3030 Section 3 requires canonical MIME format for text message types, defined in  RFC
              2045 Sections 2.7 and 2.8).
              Such  clients  can  be excluded with smtpd_forbid_bare_newline_exclusions (or, in the case of BDAT
              violations, BDAT can be  selectively  disabled  with  smtpd_discard_ehlo_keyword_address_maps,  or
              globally disabled with smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords).

       <b>no</b> (default for Postfix &lt; 3.9)
              Do  not require the standard End-of-DATA sequence &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;. Always process a bare &lt;LF&gt; as
              if the client sent &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;. This option is fully backwards compatible, but is not recommended for
              an Internet-facing SMTP server, because it is vulnerable to  SMTP smuggling.

       Recommended settings:

           # Require the standard End-of-DATA sequence &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.
           # Otherwise, allow bare &lt;LF&gt; and process it as if the client sent
           # &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.
           #
           # This maintains compatibility with many legitimate SMTP client
           # applications that send a mix of standard and non-standard line

       This feature with settings <b>yes</b> and  <b>no</b>  is  available  in  Postfix  3.8.4,  3.7.9,  3.6.13,  and  3.5.23.
       Additionally,  the  settings  <b>reject</b>,  and  <b>normalize</b>  are  available with Postfix &gt;= 3.9, 3.8.5, 3.7.10,
       3.6.14, and 3.5.24.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_forbid_bare_newline_exclusions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$mynetworks)</b></h4><pre>
       Exclude the specified clients from smtpd_forbid_bare_newline enforcement.  This  setting  uses  the  same
       syntax and parent-domain matching behavior as mynetworks.

       This feature is available in Postfix &gt;= 3.9, 3.8.4, 3.7.9, 3.6.13, and 3.5.23.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_forbid_bare_newline_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>550)</b></h4><pre>
       The  numerical Postfix SMTP server response code when rejecting a request with "smtpd_forbid_bare_newline
       = reject".  Specify a 5XX status code (521 to disconnect).

       This feature is available in Postfix &gt;= 3.9, 3.8.5, 3.7.10, 3.6.14, and 3.5.24.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_forbid_unauth_pipelining</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>Postfix</b> <b>&gt;=</b> <b>3.9:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Disconnect remote SMTP clients that violate RFC 2920 (or 5321) command pipelining constraints. The server
       replies with "554 5.5.0 Error: SMTP protocol synchronization" and logs the unexpected remote SMTP  client
       input.  This feature is enabled by default with Postfix &gt;= 3.9. Specify "smtpd_forbid_unauth_pipelining =
       no" to disable.

       This feature is available in Postfix &gt;= 3.9, 3.8.1, 3.7.6, 3.6.10, and 3.5.20.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_forbidden_commands</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>CONNECT</b> <b>GET</b> <b>POST</b> <b>regexp:{{/^[^A-Z]/</b> <b>Bogus}})</b></h4><pre>
       List of commands that cause the Postfix SMTP server to immediately terminate the session with a 221 code.
       This can be used to disconnect clients that obviously attempt to abuse the system.  In  addition  to  the
       commands  listed in this parameter, commands that follow the "Label:" format of message headers will also
       cause a disconnect. With Postfix versions 3.6 and earlier, the default value is "CONNECT GET POST".

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

       Support for inline regular expressions was added in  Postfix  version  3.7.  See  <b><a href="../man5/regexp_table.5.html">regexp_table</a></b>(5)  for  a
       description of the syntax and features.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_hard_error_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>normal:</b> <b>20,</b> <b>overload:</b> <b>1)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal number of errors a remote SMTP client is allowed to make without delivering mail. The Postfix
       SMTP server disconnects when the limit is reached. Normally the default limit is 20, but it changes under
       overload  to  just  1.  With  Postfix  2.5  and earlier, the SMTP server always allows up to 20 errors by
       default.  Valid values are greater than zero.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_helo_required</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Require that a remote SMTP client introduces itself with the HELO or EHLO command before sending the MAIL
       command or other commands that require EHLO negotiation.

       Example:

       smtpd_helo_required = yes

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_helo_restrictions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional restrictions that the Postfix SMTP server applies in the context of a client HELO command.   See
       SMTPD_ACCESS_README,  section  "Delayed  evaluation of SMTP access restriction lists" for a discussion of
       evaluation context and time.

       The default is to permit everything.

       Note: specify "smtpd_helo_required = yes" to fully enforce this restriction (without "smtpd_helo_required
       = yes", a client can simply skip smtpd_helo_restrictions by not sending HELO or EHLO).

       Specify a list of restrictions, separated by commas and/or whitespace.  Continue long lines  by  starting
       the next line with whitespace.  Restrictions are applied in the order as specified; the first restriction
       that matches wins.

       The  following  restrictions  are  specific  to  the  hostname information received with the HELO or EHLO
       command.

       <b>check_helo_access</b> <u>type:table</u>
              Search the  specified  <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5)  database  for  the  HELO  or  EHLO  hostname,  and  execute  the
              corresponding action.  Note: specify "smtpd_helo_required = yes" to fully enforce this restriction
              (without  "smtpd_helo_required  =  yes", a client can simply skip check_helo_access by not sending
              HELO or EHLO).

       <b>check_helo_a_access</b> <u>type:table</u>
              Search the specified <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5) database for the IP addresses for the HELO or  EHLO  hostname,  and
              execute  the  corresponding  action.   Note 1: a result of "OK" is not allowed for safety reasons.
              Instead, use  DUNNO  in  order  to  exclude  specific  hosts  from  denylists.   Note  2:  specify
              "smtpd_helo_required  =  yes"  to  fully  enforce this restriction (without "smtpd_helo_required =
              yes", a client can simply skip check_helo_a_access by not sending HELO or EHLO).  This feature  is
              available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

       <b>check_helo_mx_access</b> <u>type:table</u>
              Search  the  specified  <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5)  database  for  the  MX hosts for the HELO or EHLO hostname, and
              execute the corresponding action.  If no MX record is found, look up A or AAAA records, just  like
              the  Postfix  SMTP  client  would.   Note  1:  a result of "OK" is not allowed for safety reasons.
              Instead, use  DUNNO  in  order  to  exclude  specific  hosts  from  denylists.   Note  2:  specify
              "smtpd_helo_required  =  yes"  to  fully  enforce this restriction (without "smtpd_helo_required =
              yes", a client can simply skip check_helo_mx_access by not sending HELO or EHLO).  This feature is
              available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>check_helo_ns_access</b> <u>type:table</u>
              Search the specified <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5) database for the DNS servers for the HELO  or  EHLO  hostname,  and
              execute  the  corresponding  action.   Note 1: a result of "OK" is not allowed for safety reasons.
              Instead, use  DUNNO  in  order  to  exclude  specific  hosts  from  denylists.   Note  2:  specify
              "smtpd_helo_required  =  yes"  to  fully  enforce this restriction (without "smtpd_helo_required =
              yes", a client can simply skip check_helo_ns_access by not sending HELO or EHLO). This feature  is
              available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>reject_invalid_helo_hostname</b> (with Postfix &lt; 2.3: reject_invalid_hostname)
              Reject   the   request   when   the   HELO   or   EHLO   hostname  is  malformed.   Note:  specify
              "smtpd_helo_required = yes" to fully enforce  this  restriction  (without  "smtpd_helo_required  =
              yes", a client can simply skip reject_invalid_helo_hostname by not sending HELO or EHLO).
              The invalid_hostname_reject_code specifies the response code for rejected requests (default: 501).

       <b>reject_non_fqdn_helo_hostname</b> (with Postfix &lt; 2.3: reject_non_fqdn_hostname)
              Reject  the  request  when  the  HELO or EHLO hostname is not in fully-qualified domain or address
              literal form, as required by the RFC. Note: specify "smtpd_helo_required = yes" to  fully  enforce
              this   restriction   (without   "smtpd_helo_required   =   yes",   a   client   can   simply  skip
              reject_non_fqdn_helo_hostname by not sending HELO or EHLO).
              The non_fqdn_reject_code parameter specifies the response code  for  rejected  requests  (default:
              504).

       <b>reject_rhsbl_helo</b> <u>rbl_domain=d.d.d.d</u>
              Reject  the  request  when  the  HELO or EHLO hostname is listed with the A record "<u>d.d.d.d</u>" under
              <u>rbl_domain</u> (Postfix version 2.1 and later only).  Each "<u>d</u>" is a number, or a pattern  inside  "[]"
              that  contains one or more ";"-separated numbers or number..number ranges (Postfix version 2.8 and
              later).  If no "<u>=d.d.d.d</u>" is specified, reject the request when  the  HELO  or  EHLO  hostname  is
              listed  with  any  A record under <u>rbl_domain</u>. See the reject_rbl_client description for additional
              RBL related configuration parameters.  Note: specify "smtpd_helo_required = yes" to fully  enforce
              this  restriction (without "smtpd_helo_required = yes", a client can simply skip reject_rhsbl_helo
              by not sending HELO or EHLO). This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       <b>reject_unknown_helo_hostname</b> (with Postfix &lt; 2.3: reject_unknown_hostname)
              Reject the request when the HELO or EHLO hostname has no DNS A or MX record.
              The  reply  is  specified  with  the  unknown_hostname_reject_code  parameter  (default:  450)  or
              unknown_helo_hostname_tempfail_action  (default:  defer_if_permit).   See the respective parameter
              descriptions for details.
              Note:  specify  "smtpd_helo_required  =  yes"  to  fully   enforce   this   restriction   (without
              "smtpd_helo_required  = yes", a client can simply skip reject_unknown_helo_hostname by not sending
              HELO or EHLO).

       Other restrictions that are valid in this context:

       •      Generic  restrictions  that  can  be  used  in  any  SMTP   command   context,   described   under
              smtpd_client_restrictions.

       •      Client     hostname     or    network    address    specific    restrictions    described    under
              smtpd_client_restrictions.

       •      SMTP   command   specific    restrictions    described    under    smtpd_sender_restrictions    or
              smtpd_recipient_restrictions.    When   sender   or   recipient   restrictions  are  listed  under
              smtpd_helo_restrictions,  they  have  effect  only  with  "smtpd_delay_reject  =  yes",  so   that
              $smtpd_helo_restrictions is evaluated at the time of the RCPT TO command.

       Examples:

       smtpd_helo_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject_invalid_helo_hostname
       smtpd_helo_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject_unknown_helo_hostname

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_hide_client_session</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Do not include SMTP client session information in the Postfix SMTP server's Received: message header.

       •      The  default  setting, "smtpd_hide_client_session = no", must be used for the port 25 MTA service.
              It provides information that is required by RFC 5321.

       •      The setting "smtpd_hide_client_session = yes" may be used for the port 587 and 465  MUA  services.
              This  hides  the SMTP client hostname and IP address, TLS session details, SASL login details, and
              SMTP protocol details.

       Depending on the number of recipients, a redacted Received: header has one of the following forms:

           Received: by mail.example.com (Postfix) id postfix-queue-id
                   for &lt;<a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a>&gt;; Day, dd Mon yyyy hh:mm:ss tz-offset (zone)
           Received: by mail.example.com (Postfix) id postfix-queue-id
                   Day, dd Mon yyyy hh:mm:ss tz-offset (zone)

       The redacted form hides that a message was received with SMTP, and therefore it does not need to  provide
       the information required by RFC 5321. The form does still meet RFC 5322 requirements.

       This feature is available in Postfix &gt;= 3.10.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_history_flush_threshold</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100)</b></h4><pre>
       The  maximal number of lines in the Postfix SMTP server command history before it is flushed upon receipt
       of EHLO, RSET, or end of DATA.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_junk_command_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>normal:</b> <b>100,</b> <b>overload:</b> <b>1)</b></h4><pre>
       The number of junk commands (NOOP, VRFY, ETRN or RSET) that a remote SMTP  client  can  send  before  the
       Postfix SMTP server starts to increment the error counter with each junk command.  The junk command count
       is  reset  after  mail  is  delivered.   See  also  the smtpd_error_sleep_time and smtpd_soft_error_limit
       configuration parameters.  Normally the default limit is 100, but it changes under overload  to  just  1.
       With Postfix 2.5 and earlier, the SMTP server always allows up to 100 junk commands by default.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_log_access_permit_actions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable  logging  of  the  named "permit" actions in SMTP server access lists (by default, the SMTP server
       logs "reject" actions but not "permit" actions).  This feature does not affect conditional  actions  such
       as "defer_if_permit".

       Specify  a  list  of  "permit"  action  names, "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns, separated by commas
       and/or whitespace. The list is matched left to right,  and  the  search  stops  on  the  first  match.  A
       "/file/name"  pattern  is  replaced  by  its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched when a name
       matches a lookup key (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by starting the next line  with
       whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude a name from the list.

       Examples:

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           # Log all "permit" actions.
           smtpd_log_access_permit_actions = static:all

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           # Log "permit_dnswl_client" only.
           smtpd_log_access_permit_actions = permit_dnswl_client

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.10 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_milter_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Lookup  tables  with  Milter settings per remote SMTP client IP address.  The lookup result overrides the
       smtpd_milters setting, and has the same syntax.

       Note: lookup tables cannot return empty responses. Specify a lookup result  of  DISABLE  (case  does  not
       matter) to indicate that Milter support should be disabled.

       Example to disable Milters for local clients:

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           smtpd_milter_maps = cidr:/etc/postfix/smtpd_milter_map
           smtpd_milters = inet:host:port, { inet:host:port, ... }, ...

       /etc/postfix/smtpd_milter_map:
           # Disable Milters for local clients.
           127.0.0.0/8    DISABLE
           192.168.0.0/16 DISABLE
           ::/64          DISABLE
           2001:db8::/32  DISABLE

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_milters</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       A  list  of  Milter (mail filter) applications for new mail that arrives via the Postfix <b><a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html">smtpd</a></b>(8) server.
       Specify space or comma as separator. See the MILTER_README document for details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_min_data_rate</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>500)</b></h4><pre>
       The minimum plaintext data transfer rate in bytes/second for DATA and BDAT requests, when  deadlines  are
       enabled  with  smtpd_per_request_deadline.  After  a  read  operation transfers N plaintext message bytes
       (possibly after TLS decryption), and after the DATA or  BDAT  request  deadline  is  decremented  by  the
       elapsed   time   of   that  read  operation,  the  DATA  or  BDAT  request  deadline  is  incremented  by
       N/smtpd_min_data_rate seconds. However, the deadline will never be  incremented  beyond  the  time  limit
       specified with smtpd_timeout.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.7 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_noop_commands</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       List  of  commands that the Postfix SMTP server replies to with "250 Ok", without doing any syntax checks
       and without changing state.  This list overrides any commands built into the Postfix SMTP server.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_null_access_lookup_key</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>&lt;&gt;)</b></h4><pre>
       The lookup key to be used in SMTP <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5) tables instead of the null sender address.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_peername_lookup</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Attempt to look up the remote SMTP client hostname, and verify  that  the  name  matches  the  client  IP
       address.  A  client name is set to "unknown" when it cannot be looked up or verified, or when name lookup
       is disabled.  Turning off name lookup reduces delays due to DNS lookup and increases the maximal  inbound
       delivery rate.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_per_record_deadline</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>normal:</b> <b>no,</b> <b>overload:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Change  the  behavior  of the smtpd_timeout and smtpd_starttls_timeout time limits, from a time limit per
       read or write system call, to a time limit to send or receive a complete record (an  SMTP  command  line,
       SMTP  response  line,  SMTP  message content line, or TLS protocol message).  This limits the impact from
       hostile peers that trickle data one byte at a time.

       Note: when per-record deadlines are enabled, a short timeout may cause problems with TLS over  very  slow
       network  connections.   The  reasons  are  that  a TLS protocol message can be up to 16 kbytes long (with
       TLSv1), and that an entire TLS protocol message must be sent or received within the per-record deadline.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.9-3.6. With older Postfix releases, the behavior  is  as  if  this
       parameter is set to "no". Postfix 3.7 and later use smtpd_per_request_deadline.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_per_request_deadline</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>normal:</b> <b>no,</b> <b>overload:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Change  the  behavior  of the smtpd_timeout and smtpd_starttls_timeout time limits, from a time limit per
       plaintext or TLS read or write call, to a combined time limit for receiving a complete SMTP  request  and
       for  sending  a  complete SMTP response. The deadline limits only the time spent waiting for plaintext or
       TLS read or write calls, not time spent elsewhere.  The  per-request  deadline  limits  the  impact  from
       hostile peers that trickle data one byte at a time.

       See smtpd_min_data_rate for how the per-request deadline is managed during the DATA and BDAT phase.

       Note:  when  per-request  deadlines are enabled, a short time limit may cause problems with TLS over very
       slow network connections. The reason is that a TLS protocol message can be up to  16  kbytes  long  (with
       TLSv1), and that an entire TLS protocol message must be transferred within the per-request deadline.

       This  feature  is available in Postfix 3.7 and later. A weaker feature, called smtpd_per_record_deadline,
       is available with Postfix 2.9-3.6. With older Postfix releases, the behavior is as if this  parameter  is
       set to "no".

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.7 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_policy_service_default_action</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>451</b> <b>4.3.5</b> <b>Server</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>problem)</b></h4><pre>
       The  default  action  when  an  SMTPD  policy service request fails.  Specify "DUNNO" to behave as if the
       failed  SMTPD policy service request was not sent, and to continue processing other access  restrictions,
       if any.

       Limitations:

       •      This  parameter  may  specify  any  value  that  would be a valid SMTPD policy server response (or
              <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5) map lookup result).  An <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5) map or policy server in this parameter value may  need
              to be declared in advance with a restriction_class setting.

       •      If  the  specified action invokes another check_policy_service request, that request will have the
              built-in default action.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_policy_service_max_idle</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>300s)</b></h4><pre>
       The time after which an idle SMTPD policy service connection is closed.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_policy_service_max_ttl</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000s)</b></h4><pre>
       The time after which an active SMTPD policy service connection is closed.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_policy_service_policy_context</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional information that the Postfix SMTP server specifies in the "policy_context" attribute of a policy
       service request (originally, to share the  same  service  endpoint  among  multiple  check_policy_service
       clients).

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_policy_service_request_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal number of requests per SMTPD policy service connection, or zero (no limit). Once a connection
       reaches  this  limit,  the  connection is closed and the next request will be sent over a new connection.
       This is a workaround to avoid error-recovery delays with policy servers that cannot maintain a persistent
       connection.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_policy_service_retry_delay</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1s)</b></h4><pre>
       The delay between attempts to resend a failed SMTPD policy service request. Specify a value greater  than
       zero.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_policy_service_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100s)</b></h4><pre>
       The time limit for connecting to, writing to, or receiving from a delegated SMTPD policy server.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_policy_service_try_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>2)</b></h4><pre>
       The  maximal number of attempts to send an SMTPD policy service request before giving up. Specify a value
       greater than zero.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_proxy_ehlo</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$myhostname)</b></h4><pre>
       How the Postfix SMTP server announces itself to the proxy filter.  By default, the  Postfix  hostname  is
       used.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_proxy_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       The  hostname  and  TCP  port  of  the mail filtering proxy server.  The proxy receives all mail from the
       Postfix SMTP server, and is supposed to give the result to another Postfix SMTP server process.

       Specify "host:port" or "inet:host:port"  for  a  TCP  endpoint,  or  "unix:pathname"  for  a  UNIX-domain
       endpoint. The host can be specified as an IP address or as a symbolic name; no MX lookups are done.  When
       no  "host" or "host:" is specified, the local machine is assumed.  Pathname interpretation is relative to
       the Postfix queue directory.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       The "inet:" and "unix:" prefixes are available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_proxy_options</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       List of options that control how the Postfix SMTP server communicates with a before-queue content filter.
       Specify zero or more of the following, separated by comma or whitespace.

       <b>speed_adjust</b>
              Do not connect to a before-queue content filter until an entire message has  been  received.  This
              reduces the number of simultaneous before-queue content filter processes.

       NOTE  1:  A  filter  must  not <u>selectively</u> reject recipients of a multi-recipient message.  Rejecting all
       recipients is OK, as is accepting all recipients.

       NOTE 2: This feature increases the minimum amount of free queue space by $message_size_limit.  The  extra
       space is needed to save the message to a temporary file.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.7 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_proxy_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100s)</b></h4><pre>
       The  time  limit  for  connecting  to  a  proxy  filter and for sending or receiving information.  When a
       connection fails the client gets a generic error message while more detailed information is logged to the
       maillog file.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal number of recipients that the Postfix SMTP server accepts per message delivery request.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_recipient_overshoot_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000)</b></h4><pre>
       The  number  of  recipients  that  a  remote  SMTP  client can send in excess of the limit specified with
       $smtpd_recipient_limit, before the Postfix SMTP server increments the per-session error  count  for  each
       excess recipient.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_recipient_restrictions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  restrictions  that  the Postfix SMTP server applies in the context of a client RCPT TO command,
       after smtpd_relay_restrictions.  See SMTPD_ACCESS_README, section  "Delayed  evaluation  of  SMTP  access
       restriction lists" for a discussion of evaluation context and time.

       With  Postfix  versions before 2.10, the rules for relay permission and spam blocking were combined under
       smtpd_recipient_restrictions,  resulting  in  error-prone  configuration.   As  of  Postfix  2.10,  relay
       permission  rules  are  preferably  implemented  with smtpd_relay_restrictions, so that a permissive spam
       blocking policy under smtpd_recipient_restrictions will no longer  result  in  a  permissive  mail  relay
       policy.

       For   backwards   compatibility,   sites   that  migrate  from  Postfix  versions  before  2.10  can  set
       smtpd_relay_restrictions to the empty value, and use smtpd_recipient_restrictions exactly as before.

       IMPORTANT: Either the smtpd_relay_restrictions or the smtpd_recipient_restrictions parameter must specify
       at least one of the following restrictions. Otherwise Postfix will refuse to receive mail:

           reject, reject_unauth_destination

           defer, defer_if_permit, defer_unauth_destination

       Specify a list of restrictions, separated by commas and/or whitespace.  Continue long lines  by  starting
       the next line with whitespace.  Restrictions are applied in the order as specified; the first restriction
       that matches wins.

       The  following  restrictions  are  specific  to  the  recipient address that is received with the RCPT TO
       command.

       <b>check_recipient_access</b> <u>type:table</u>
              Search the specified <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5) database  for  the  resolved  RCPT  TO  address,  and  execute  the
              corresponding action.

       <b>check_recipient_a_access</b> <u>type:table</u>
              Search  the  specified <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5) database for the IP addresses for the RCPT TO domain, and execute
              the corresponding action.  Note: a result of "OK" is not allowed for safety reasons. Instead,  use
              DUNNO in order to exclude specific hosts from denylists.  This feature is available in Postfix 3.0
              and later.

       <b>check_recipient_mx_access</b> <u>type:table</u>
              Search  the  specified <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5) database for the MX hosts for the RCPT TO domain, and execute the
              corresponding action.  If no MX record is found, look up A or AAAA records, just like the  Postfix
              SMTP client would. Note: a result of "OK" is not allowed for safety reasons. Instead, use DUNNO in
              order  to  exclude  specific  hosts  from denylists.  This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and
              later.

       <b>check_recipient_ns_access</b> <u>type:table</u>
              Search the specified <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5) database for the DNS servers for the RCPT TO  domain,  and  execute
              the  corresponding action.  Note: a result of "OK" is not allowed for safety reasons. Instead, use
              DUNNO in order to exclude specific hosts from denylists.  This feature is available in Postfix 2.1
              and later.

       <b>permit_auth_destination</b>
              Permit the request when one of the following is true:

       •      Postfix is a mail forwarder: the resolved RCPT TO domain matches  $relay_domains  or  a  subdomain
              thereof, and the address contains no sender-specified routing (user@elsewhere@domain),

       •      Postfix   is   the  final  destination:  the  resolved  RCPT  TO  domain  matches  $mydestination,
              $inet_interfaces, $proxy_interfaces, $virtual_alias_domains, or $virtual_mailbox_domains, and  the
              address contains no sender-specified routing (user@elsewhere@domain).

       <b>permit_mx_backup</b>
              Permit  the  request when the local mail system is a backup MX for the RCPT TO domain, or when the
              domain is an authorized destination (see permit_auth_destination for definition).

       •      Safety: permit_mx_backup does not accept addresses that have sender-specified routing  information
              (example: user@elsewhere@domain).

       •      Safety:  permit_mx_backup  can  be  vulnerable  to  mis-use  when  access  is  not restricted with
              permit_mx_backup_networks.

       •      Safety: as of Postfix version 2.3, permit_mx_backup no longer accepts the address when  the  local
              mail  system  is  a  primary MX for the recipient domain.  Exception: permit_mx_backup accepts the
              address when it specifies an authorized destination (see permit_auth_destination for definition).

       •      Limitation: mail may be rejected in case of a temporary DNS lookup problem with Postfix  prior  to
              version 2.0.

       <b>reject_non_fqdn_recipient</b>
              Reject  the  request  when  the  RCPT TO address specifies a domain that is not in fully-qualified
              domain form, as required by the RFC.
              The non_fqdn_reject_code parameter specifies the response code  for  rejected  requests  (default:
              504).

       <b>reject_rhsbl_recipient</b> <u>rbl_domain=d.d.d.d</u>
              Reject  the request when the RCPT TO domain is listed with the A record "<u>d.d.d.d</u>" under <u>rbl_domain</u>
              (Postfix version 2.1 and later only).  Each "<u>d</u>" is  a  number,  or  a  pattern  inside  "[]"  that
              contains  one  or  more  ";"-separated  numbers  or number..number ranges (Postfix version 2.8 and
              later). If no "<u>=d.d.d.d</u>" is specified, reject the request when the RCPT TO domain is  listed  with
              any A record under <u>rbl_domain</u>.
              The  maps_rbl_reject_code  parameter  specifies  the response code for rejected requests (default:
              554); the default_rbl_reply parameter specifies the default server reply; and  the  rbl_reply_maps
              parameter  specifies  tables with server replies indexed by <u>rbl_domain</u>.  This feature is available
              in Postfix version 2.0 and later.

       <b>reject_unauth_destination</b>
              Reject the request unless one of the following is true:

       •      Postfix is a mail forwarder: the resolved RCPT TO domain matches  $relay_domains  or  a  subdomain
              thereof, and contains no sender-specified routing (user@elsewhere@domain),

       •      Postfix   is   the  final  destination:  the  resolved  RCPT  TO  domain  matches  $mydestination,
              $inet_interfaces,  $proxy_interfaces,  $virtual_alias_domains,  or  $virtual_mailbox_domains,  and
              contains no sender-specified routing (user@elsewhere@domain).
              The  relay_domains_reject_code  parameter  specifies  the  response  code  for  rejected  requests
              (default: 554).

       <b>defer_unauth_destination</b>
              Reject the same requests as reject_unauth_destination, with  a  non-permanent  error  code.   This
              feature is available in Postfix 2.10 and later.

       <b>reject_unknown_recipient_domain</b>
              Reject the request when Postfix is not final destination for the recipient domain, and the RCPT TO
              domain  has  1)  no DNS MX and no DNS A record or 2) a malformed MX record such as a record with a
              zero-length MX hostname (Postfix version 2.3 and later).
              The  reply  is  specified  with  the   unknown_address_reject_code   parameter   (default:   450),
              unknown_address_tempfail_action  (default:  defer_if_permit),  or  556  (nullmx,  Postfix  3.0 and
              later). See the respective parameter descriptions for details.

       <b>reject_unlisted_recipient</b> (with Postfix version 2.0: check_recipient_maps)
              Reject the request when the RCPT TO address is not listed in the list of valid recipients for  its
              domain  class.  See  the  smtpd_reject_unlisted_recipient parameter description for details.  This
              feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>reject_unverified_recipient</b>
              Reject the request when mail to the RCPT TO address is known to  bounce,  or  when  the  recipient
              address  destination  is  not  reachable.   Address  verification  information  is  managed by the
              <b><a href="../man8/verify.8.html">verify</a></b>(8) server; see the ADDRESS_VERIFICATION_README file for details.
              The unverified_recipient_reject_code parameter specifies  the  numerical  response  code  when  an
              address  is known to bounce (default: 450, change it to 550 when you are confident that it is safe
              to do so).
              The unverified_recipient_defer_code parameter  specifies  the  numerical  response  code  when  an
              address probe failed due to a temporary problem (default: 450).
              The  unverified_recipient_tempfail_action  parameter  specifies  the  action  after  address probe
              failure due to a temporary problem (default: defer_if_permit).
              This feature breaks for aliased addresses with "enable_original_recipient = no" (Postfix &lt;= 3.2).
              This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       Other restrictions that are valid in this context:

       •      Generic  restrictions  that  can  be  used  in  any  SMTP   command   context,   described   under
              smtpd_client_restrictions.

       •      SMTP     command     specific     restrictions    described    under    smtpd_client_restrictions,
              smtpd_helo_restrictions and smtpd_sender_restrictions.

       Example:

       # The Postfix before 2.10 default mail relay policy. Later Postfix
       # versions implement this preferably with smtpd_relay_restrictions.
       smtpd_recipient_restrictions = permit_mynetworks, reject_unauth_destination

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_reject_footer</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional information that is appended after each Postfix SMTP server 4XX or 5XX response.

       The following example uses "\c" at the start of the template (supported in Postfix  2.10  and  later)  to
       suppress  the  line  break between the reply text and the footer text. With earlier Postfix versions, the
       footer text always begins on a new line, and the "\c" is output literally.

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           smtpd_reject_footer = \c. For assistance, call 800-555-0101.
            Please provide the following information in your problem report:
            time ($localtime), client ($client_address) and server
            ($server_name).

       Server response:

           550-5.5.1 &lt;user@example&gt; Recipient address rejected: User
           unknown. For assistance, call 800-555-0101. Please provide the
           following information in your problem report: time (Jan 4 15:42:00),
           client (192.168.1.248) and server (mail1.example.com).

       Note: the above text is meant to make it easier to find the Postfix logfile records  for  a  failed  SMTP
       session. The text itself is not logged to the Postfix SMTP server's maillog file.

       Be  sure  to  keep  the  text as short as possible. Long text may be truncated before it is logged to the
       remote SMTP client's maillog file, or  before  it  is  returned  to  the  sender  in  a  delivery  status
       notification.

       The  template  text  is  not  subject  to  Postfix configuration parameter $name expansion. Instead, this
       feature supports a limited number of $name attributes in the footer text. These attributes  are  replaced
       with their current value for the SMTP session.

       Note:   specify   $$name   in   footer   text   that   is   looked   up   from   regexp:  or  pcre:-based
       smtpd_reject_footer_maps, otherwise the Postfix server will not use  the  footer  text  and  will  log  a
       warning instead.

       <b>client_address</b>
              The Client IP address that is logged in the maillog file.

       <b>client_port</b>
              The client TCP port that is logged in the maillog file.

       <b>localtime</b>
              The server local time (Mmm dd hh:mm:ss) that is logged in the maillog file.

       <b>server_name</b>
              The  server's  myhostname  value.   This  attribute is made available for sites with multiple MTAs
              (perhaps behind a load-balancer), where the server name  can  help  the  server  support  team  to
              quickly find the right log files.

       Notes:

       •      NOT SUPPORTED are other attributes such as sender, recipient, or main.cf parameters.

       •      For safety reasons, text that does not match $smtpd_expansion_filter is censored.

       This  feature  supports  the  two-character sequence \n as a request for a line break in the footer text.
       Postfix automatically inserts after each line  break  the  three-digit  SMTP  reply  code  (and  optional
       enhanced status code) from the original Postfix reject message.

       To  work  around mail software that mis-handles multi-line replies, specify the two-character sequence \c
       at the start of the template.  This suppresses the line break between the reply text and the footer  text
       (Postfix 2.10 and later).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_reject_footer_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Lookup  tables,  indexed  by  the  complete  Postfix  SMTP server 4xx or 5xx response, with reject footer
       templates. See smtpd_reject_footer for details.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.4 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_reject_unlisted_recipient</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Request that the Postfix SMTP server rejects mail for unknown recipient addresses, even when no  explicit
       reject_unlisted_recipient  access  restriction is specified. This prevents the Postfix queue from filling
       up with undeliverable MAILER-DAEMON messages.

       An address is considered "unknown" when 1) it does not match a <b><a href="../man5/virtual.5.html">virtual</a></b>(5) alias or <b><a href="../man5/canonical.5.html">canonical</a></b>(5)  mapping,
       and  2)  the  address  is  not  valid  for  its  address  class.  For a definition of class-based address
       validation, see ADDRESS_CLASS_README.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_reject_unlisted_sender</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Request that the Postfix SMTP server rejects mail from unknown sender addresses, even  when  no  explicit
       reject_unlisted_sender  access  restriction  is specified. This can slow down an explosion of forged mail
       from worms or viruses.

       An address is considered "unknown" when 1) it does not match a <b><a href="../man5/virtual.5.html">virtual</a></b>(5) alias or <b><a href="../man5/canonical.5.html">canonical</a></b>(5)  mapping,
       and  2)  the  address  is  not  valid  for  its  address  class.  For a definition of class-based address
       validation, see ADDRESS_CLASS_README.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_relay_before_recipient_restrictions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       Evaluate      smtpd_relay_restrictions      before      smtpd_recipient_restrictions.       Historically,
       smtpd_relay_restrictions  was  evaluated  after  smtpd_recipient_restrictions,  contradicting  documented
       behavior.

       Background: the smtpd_relay_restrictions feature is primarily designed to enforce a mail relaying policy,
       while smtpd_recipient_restrictions is primarily designed  to  enforce  spam  blocking  policy.  Both  are
       evaluated while replying to the RCPT TO command, and both support the same features.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_relay_restrictions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>permit_mynetworks,</b> <b>permit_sasl_authenticated,</b> <b>defer_unauth_destination)</b></h4><pre>
       Access  restrictions  for  mail  relay control that the Postfix SMTP server applies in the context of the
       RCPT  TO  command,  before  smtpd_recipient_restrictions.   See  SMTPD_ACCESS_README,  section   "Delayed
       evaluation of SMTP access restriction lists" for a discussion of evaluation context and time.

       With  Postfix  versions before 2.10, the rules for relay permission and spam blocking were combined under
       smtpd_recipient_restrictions,  resulting  in  error-prone  configuration.   As  of  Postfix  2.10,  relay
       permission  rules  are  preferably  implemented  with smtpd_relay_restrictions, so that a permissive spam
       blocking policy under smtpd_recipient_restrictions will no longer  result  in  a  permissive  mail  relay
       policy.

       For   backwards   compatibility,   sites   that  migrate  from  Postfix  versions  before  2.10  can  set
       smtpd_relay_restrictions to the empty value, and use smtpd_recipient_restrictions exactly as before.

       By default, the Postfix SMTP server accepts:

       •      Mail from clients whose IP address matches $mynetworks, or:

       •      Mail from clients who are SASL authenticated, or:

       •      Mail to  remote  destinations  that  match  $relay_domains,  except  for  addresses  that  contain
              sender-specified routing (user@elsewhere@domain), or:

       •      Mail  to  local  destinations  that  match  $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces, $mydestination,
              $virtual_alias_domains, or $virtual_mailbox_domains.

       IMPORTANT: Either the smtpd_relay_restrictions or the smtpd_recipient_restrictions parameter must specify
       at least one of the following restrictions. Otherwise Postfix will refuse to receive mail:

           reject, reject_unauth_destination

           defer, defer_if_permit, defer_unauth_destination

       Specify a list of restrictions, separated by commas and/or whitespace.  Continue long lines  by  starting
       the   next   line   with   whitespace.    The   same  restrictions  are  available  as  documented  under
       smtpd_recipient_restrictions.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.10 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_restriction_classes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       User-defined  aliases  for  groups  of  access  restrictions.   The   aliases   can   be   specified   in
       smtpd_recipient_restrictions etc., and on the right-hand side of a Postfix <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5) table.

       One  major  application  is for implementing per-recipient UCE control.  See the RESTRICTION_CLASS_README
       document for other examples.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_sasl_application_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>smtpd)</b></h4><pre>
       The application name that the Postfix SMTP server uses for SASL server initialization. This controls  the
       name  of  the  SASL configuration file. The default value is <b>smtpd</b>, corresponding to a SASL configuration
       file named <b>smtpd.conf</b>.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and 2.2. With Postfix 2.3 it was renamed to smtpd_sasl_path.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_sasl_auth_enable</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable SASL authentication in the Postfix SMTP server. By default, the Postfix SMTP server does  not  use
       authentication.

       If a remote SMTP client is authenticated, the permit_sasl_authenticated access restriction can be used to
       permit relay access, like this:

           # With Postfix 2.10 and later, the mail relay policy is
           # preferably specified under smtpd_relay_restrictions.
           smtpd_relay_restrictions =
               permit_mynetworks, permit_sasl_authenticated, ...

       # With Postfix before 2.10, the relay policy can be
       # specified only under smtpd_recipient_restrictions.
       smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
           permit_mynetworks, permit_sasl_authenticated, ...

       To reject all SMTP connections from unauthenticated clients, specify "smtpd_delay_reject = yes" (which is
       the default) and use:

           smtpd_client_restrictions = permit_sasl_authenticated, reject

       See the SASL_README file for SASL configuration and operation details.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_sasl_authenticated_header</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Report the SASL authenticated user name in the <b><a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html">smtpd</a></b>(8) Received message header.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_sasl_exceptions_networks</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       What remote SMTP clients the Postfix SMTP server will not offer AUTH support to.

       Some  clients  (Netscape 4 at least) have a bug that causes them to require a login and password whenever
       AUTH is offered, whether it's necessary or not. To work around this, specify, for example, $mynetworks to
       prevent Postfix from offering AUTH to local clients.

       Specify a list of network/netmask patterns, separated by commas and/or whitespace. The mask specifies the
       number of bits in the network part of a host address. You can also specify "/file/name"  or  "type:table"
       patterns.   A  "/file/name"  pattern  is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup table is matched
       when a table entry matches a lookup string (the lookup  result  is  ignored).   Continue  long  lines  by
       starting  the  next  line with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude an address or network block from
       the list.  The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       Note: IP version 6 address information must be specified inside [] in the  smtpd_sasl_exceptions_networks
       value,  and  in files specified with "/file/name".  IP version 6 addresses contain the ":" character, and
       would otherwise be confused with a "type:table" pattern.

       Example:

       smtpd_sasl_exceptions_networks = $mynetworks

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_sasl_local_domain</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       The name of the Postfix SMTP server's local SASL authentication realm.

       By default, the local authentication realm name is the null string.

       Examples:

       smtpd_sasl_local_domain = $mydomain
       smtpd_sasl_local_domain = $myhostname

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_sasl_mechanism_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>!external,</b> <b>static:rest)</b></h4><pre>
       If non-empty, a filter for the SASL mechanism names that the Postfix SMTP server  will  announce  in  the
       EHLO  response.  By  default,  the  Postfix SMTP server will not announce the EXTERNAL mechanism, because
       Postfix support for that is not implemented.

       Specify mechanism names, "/file/name" patterns, or "type:table" lookup  tables,  separated  by  comma  or
       whitespace.  The  right-hand  side  result  from  "type:table"  lookups is ignored. Specify "!pattern" to
       exclude a mechanism name from the list.

       Examples:

       smtpd_sasl_mechanism_filter = !external, !gssapi, static:rest
       smtpd_sasl_mechanism_filter = login, plain
       smtpd_sasl_mechanism_filter = /etc/postfix/smtpd_mechs

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_sasl_path</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>smtpd)</b></h4><pre>
       Implementation-specific information that the Postfix SMTP server  passes  through  to  the  SASL  plug-in
       implementation  that  is  selected  with  <b>smtpd_sasl_type</b>.   Typically  this  specifies  the  name  of  a
       configuration file or rendezvous point.

       This  feature  is  available  in  Postfix  2.3  and  later.   In   earlier   releases   it   was   called
       <b>smtpd_sasl_application_name</b>.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_sasl_response_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>12288)</b></h4><pre>
       The  maximum  length  of  a  SASL  client's  response  to a server challenge.  When the client's "initial
       response" is longer than the normal limit for SMTP commands, the client must omit its  initial  response,
       and wait for an empty server challenge; it can then send what would have been its "initial response" as a
       response  to the empty server challenge.  RFC4954 requires the server to accept client responses up to at
       least 12288 octets of base64-encoded text.  The  default  value  is  therefore  also  the  minimum  value
       accepted for this parameter.

       This  feature  is  available  in Postfix 3.4 and later. Prior versions use "line_length_limit", which may
       need to be raised to accommodate larger client responses, as may be needed with GSSAPI authentication  of
       Windows AD users who are members of many groups.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_sasl_security_options</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>noanonymous)</b></h4><pre>
       Postfix  SMTP  server  SASL security options; as of Postfix 2.3 the list of available features depends on
       the SASL server implementation that is selected with <b>smtpd_sasl_type</b>.

       The following security features are defined for the <b>cyrus</b> server SASL implementation:

       Restrict what authentication mechanisms the Postfix SMTP server will offer to the client.   The  list  of
       available authentication mechanisms is system dependent.

       Specify zero or more of the following:

       <b>noplaintext</b>
              Disallow methods that use plaintext passwords.

       <b>noactive</b>
              Disallow methods subject to active (non-dictionary) attack.

       <b>nodictionary</b>
              Disallow methods subject to passive (dictionary) attack.

       <b>noanonymous</b>
              Disallow methods that allow anonymous authentication.

       <b>forward_secrecy</b>
              Only allow methods that support forward secrecy (Dovecot only).

       <b>mutual_auth</b>
              Only allow methods that provide mutual authentication (not available with Cyrus SASL version 1).

       By default, the Postfix SMTP server accepts plaintext passwords but not anonymous logins.

       Warning:  it  appears  that  clients  try authentication methods in the order as advertised by the server
       (e.g., PLAIN ANONYMOUS CRAM-MD5) which means that if you disable plaintext passwords, clients will log in
       anonymously, even when they should be able to use CRAM-MD5.  So, if you disable plaintext logins, disable
       anonymous logins too.  Postfix treats anonymous login as no authentication.

       Example:

       smtpd_sasl_security_options = noanonymous, noplaintext

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_sasl_service</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>smtp)</b></h4><pre>
       The service name that  is  passed  to  the  SASL  plug-in  that  is  selected  with  <b>smtpd_sasl_type</b>  and
       <b>smtpd_sasl_path</b>.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.11 and later. Prior versions behave as if "<b>smtp</b>" is specified.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_sasl_tls_security_options</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtpd_sasl_security_options)</b></h4><pre>
       The  SASL  authentication  security  options  that  the  Postfix  SMTP server uses for TLS encrypted SMTP
       sessions.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_sasl_type</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>cyrus)</b></h4><pre>
       The SASL plug-in type that the Postfix SMTP server should use for authentication. The available types are
       listed with the "<b>postconf</b> <b>-a</b>" command.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_sender_login_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional lookup table with the SASL login names that own the envelope sender (MAIL FROM) addresses.

           Note: to enforce that the From: header address matches the envelope sender (MAIL FROM)  address,  use
           an  external  filter  such  as  a  Milter, for the submission or submissions (formerly called smtps )
           services. For example: https://github.com/magcks/milterfrom.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.  With lookups from indexed files such as  DB  or  DBM,  or
       from  networked  tables  such as NIS, LDAP or SQL, the following search operations are done with a sender
       address of <u>user@domain</u>:

       1) <u>user@domain</u>
              This table lookup is always done and has the highest precedence.

       2) <u>user</u>
              This table lookup is done only when the <u>domain</u> part  of  the  sender  address  matches  $myorigin,
              $mydestination, $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces.

       3) <u>@domain</u>
              This table lookup is done last and has the lowest precedence.

       In  all  cases  the  result  of  table  lookup  must  be either "not found" or a list of SASL login names
       separated by comma and/or whitespace.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_sender_restrictions</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional restrictions that the Postfix SMTP server applies in the context of a client MAIL FROM  command.
       See  SMTPD_ACCESS_README,  section "Delayed evaluation of SMTP access restriction lists" for a discussion
       of evaluation context and time.

       The default is to permit everything.

       Specify a list of restrictions, separated by commas and/or whitespace.  Continue long lines  by  starting
       the next line with whitespace.  Restrictions are applied in the order as specified; the first restriction
       that matches wins.

       The following restrictions are specific to the sender address received with the MAIL FROM command.

       <b>check_sender_access</b> <u>type:table</u>
              Search  the  specified <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5) database for the MAIL FROM address, and execute the corresponding
              action.

       <b>check_sender_a_access</b> <u>type:table</u>
              Search the specified <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5) database for the IP addresses for the MAIL FROM domain, and execute
              the corresponding action.  Note: a result of "OK" is not allowed for safety reasons. Instead,  use
              DUNNO in order to exclude specific hosts from denylists.  This feature is available in Postfix 3.0
              and later.

       <b>check_sender_mx_access</b> <u>type:table</u>
              Search the specified <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5) database for the MX hosts for the MAIL FROM domain, and execute the
              corresponding  action.  If no MX record is found, look up A or AAAA records, just like the Postfix
              SMTP client would. Note: a result of "OK" is not allowed for safety reasons. Instead, use DUNNO in
              order to exclude specific hosts from denylists.  This feature is  available  in  Postfix  2.1  and
              later.

       <b>check_sender_ns_access</b> <u>type:table</u>
              Search  the specified <b><a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a></b>(5) database for the DNS servers for the MAIL FROM domain, and execute
              the corresponding action.  Note: a result of "OK" is not allowed for safety reasons. Instead,  use
              DUNNO in order to exclude specific hosts from denylists.  This feature is available in Postfix 2.1
              and later.

       <b>reject_authenticated_sender_login_mismatch</b>
              Reject the request when the client is authenticated with SASL, but either the MAIL FROM address is
              not listed in $smtpd_sender_login_maps, or the SASL login name is not an owner for that address.
              This  prevents  an authenticated client from using a MAIL FROM address that they do not explicitly
              own.
              Note: to enforce that the From: header address matches the envelope sender  (MAIL  FROM)  address,
              use an external filter such as a Milter, for the submission or submissions (formerly called smtps)
              services.  For example: https://github.com/magcks/milterfrom.
              This feature is available in Postfix version 2.1 and later.

       <b>reject_known_sender_login_mismatch</b>
              When  the  client  is  authenticated  with  SASL, reject the request when the MAIL FROM address is
              listed in $smtpd_sender_login_maps, but the SASL login name is not an owner for that address.
              When the client is not authenticated with SASL, reject the request when SASL is enabled,  and  the
              MAIL FROM address is listed in $smtpd_sender_login_maps.
              This  protects  any  MAIL  FROM  address  that  is listed in $smtpd_sender_login_maps, while still
              allowing a client to use any unlisted MAIL FROM address.
              Note: to enforce that the From: header address matches the envelope sender  (MAIL  FROM)  address,
              use an external filter such as a Milter, for the submission or submissions (formerly called smtps)
              services.  For example: https://github.com/magcks/milterfrom.
              This feature is available in Postfix version 2.11 and later.

       <b>reject_non_fqdn_sender</b>
              Reject  the  request  when the MAIL FROM address specifies a domain that is not in fully-qualified
              domain form as required by the RFC.
              The non_fqdn_reject_code parameter specifies the response code  for  rejected  requests  (default:
              504).

       <b>reject_rhsbl_sender</b> <u>rbl_domain=d.d.d.d</u>
              Reject  the  request  when  the  MAIL  FROM  domain  is  listed  with the A record "<u>d.d.d.d</u>" under
              <u>rbl_domain</u> (Postfix version 2.1 and later only).  Each "<u>d</u>" is a number, or a pattern  inside  "[]"
              that  contains one or more ";"-separated numbers or number..number ranges (Postfix version 2.8 and
              later). If no "<u>=d.d.d.d</u>" is specified, reject the request when the MAIL FROM domain is listed with
              any A record under <u>rbl_domain</u>.
              The maps_rbl_reject_code parameter specifies the response code  for  rejected  requests  (default:
              554);  the  default_rbl_reply parameter specifies the default server reply; and the rbl_reply_maps
              parameter specifies tables with server replies indexed by <u>rbl_domain</u>.  This feature  is  available
              in Postfix 2.0 and later.

       <b>reject_sender_login_mismatch</b>
              As   of   Postfix   2.1,   this   is  an  alias  for  "reject_authenticated_sender_login_mismatch,
              reject_unauthenticated_sender_login_mismatch".

       <b>reject_unauthenticated_sender_login_mismatch</b>
              Reject  the  request  when   SASL   is   enabled,   the   MAIL   FROM   address   is   listed   in
              $smtpd_sender_login_maps, but the client is not authenticated with SASL.
              With  SASL  enabled, this prevents an unauthenticated client from using any MAIL FROM address that
              is listed in $smtpd_sender_login_maps.
              Note: to enforce that the From: header address matches the envelope sender  (MAIL  FROM)  address,
              use an external filter such as a Milter, for the submission or submissions (formerly called smtps)
              services.  For example: https://github.com/magcks/milterfrom.
              This feature is available in Postfix version 2.1 and later.

       <b>reject_unknown_sender_domain</b>
              Reject  the request when Postfix is not the final destination for the sender address, and the MAIL
              FROM domain has 1) no DNS MX and no DNS A record, or 2) a malformed MX record  such  as  a  record
              with a zero-length MX hostname (Postfix version 2.3 and later).
              The   reply   is   specified   with  the  unknown_address_reject_code  parameter  (default:  450),
              unknown_address_tempfail_action (default:  defer_if_permit),  or  550  (nullmx,  Postfix  3.0  and
              later). See the respective parameter descriptions for details.

       <b>reject_unlisted_sender</b>
              Reject  the  request  when the MAIL FROM address is not listed in the list of valid recipients for
              its domain class. See the smtpd_reject_unlisted_sender parameter description  for  details.   This
              feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       <b>reject_unverified_sender</b>
              Reject  the  request  when  mail  to  the MAIL FROM address is known to bounce, or when the sender
              address destination is  not  reachable.   Address  verification  information  is  managed  by  the
              <b><a href="../man8/verify.8.html">verify</a></b>(8) server; see the ADDRESS_VERIFICATION_README file for details.
              The  unverified_sender_reject_code parameter specifies the numerical response code when an address
              is known to bounce (default: 450, change into 550 when you are confident that it  is  safe  to  do
              so).
              The  unverified_sender_defer_code  specifies  the  numerical  response  code when an address probe
              failed due to a temporary problem (default: 450).
              The unverified_sender_tempfail_action parameter specifies the action after address  probe  failure
              due to a temporary problem (default: defer_if_permit).
              This feature breaks for aliased addresses with "enable_original_recipient = no" (Postfix &lt;= 3.2).
              This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

       Other restrictions that are valid in this context:

       •      Generic   restrictions   that   can   be  used  in  any  SMTP  command  context,  described  under
              smtpd_client_restrictions.

       •      SMTP   command   specific   restrictions    described    under    smtpd_client_restrictions    and
              smtpd_helo_restrictions.

       •      SMTP  command  specific  restrictions described under smtpd_recipient_restrictions. When recipient
              restrictions  are  listed  under   smtpd_sender_restrictions,   they   have   effect   only   with
              "smtpd_delay_reject  =  yes",  so  that $smtpd_sender_restrictions is evaluated at the time of the
              RCPT TO command.

       Examples:

       smtpd_sender_restrictions = reject_unknown_sender_domain
       smtpd_sender_restrictions = reject_unknown_sender_domain,
           check_sender_access hash:/etc/postfix/access

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_service_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>smtpd)</b></h4><pre>
       The internal service that <b><a href="../man8/postscreen.8.html">postscreen</a></b>(8) hands off allowed connections to. In a future version  there  may
       be different classes of SMTP service.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_soft_error_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>10)</b></h4><pre>
       The  number  of errors a remote SMTP client is allowed to make without delivering mail before the Postfix
       SMTP server slows down all its responses.

       •      With Postfix version 2.1 and later, when the error count is &gt; $smtpd_soft_error_limit, the Postfix
              SMTP server delays all responses by $smtpd_error_sleep_time.

       •      With Postfix versions 2.0 and earlier, when the error  count  is  &gt;  $smtpd_soft_error_limit,  the
              Postfix  SMTP  server  delays  all  responses  by  the  larger  of  (number  of errors) seconds or
              $smtpd_error_sleep_time.

       •      With Postfix versions 2.0 and earlier, when the error count  is  &lt;=  $smtpd_soft_error_limit,  the
              Postfix SMTP server delays 4XX and 5XX responses by $smtpd_error_sleep_time.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_starttls_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The  time  limit  for  Postfix  SMTP  server  write  and  read operations during TLS startup and shutdown
       handshake procedures. The current default value is stress-dependent. Before Postfix version 2.8,  it  was
       fixed at 300s.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>normal:</b> <b>300s,</b> <b>overload:</b> <b>10s)</b></h4><pre>
       When the Postfix SMTP server wants to send an SMTP server response, how long the Postfix SMTP server will
       wait for an underlying network write operation to complete; and when  the  Postfix  SMTP  server  Postfix
       wants  to  receive  an  SMTP client request, how long the Postfix SMTP server will wait for an underlying
       network read operation to complete. See the smtpd_per_request_deadline for how this  time  limit  may  be
       enforced (with Postfix 2.9-3.6 see smtpd_per_record_deadline).

       Normally  the  default  limit  is  300s,  but it changes under overload to just 10s. With Postfix 2.5 and
       earlier, the SMTP server always uses a time limit of 300s by default.

       Note: if you set SMTP time limits to very large values you may have  to  update  the  global  ipc_timeout
       parameter.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_CAfile</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       A file containing (PEM format) CA certificates of root CAs trusted to  sign  either  remote  SMTP  client
       certificates  or  intermediate  CA certificates.  These are loaded into memory before the <b><a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html">smtpd</a></b>(8) server
       enters the chroot jail. If the number of trusted roots is large, consider using smtpd_tls_CApath instead,
       but note that the latter directory must be present in the chroot jail if the <b><a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html">smtpd</a></b>(8) server is chrooted.
       This file may also be used to augment the server certificate trust chain, but it is best to  include  all
       the required certificates directly in the server certificate file.

       Specify   "smtpd_tls_CAfile   =   /path/to/system_CA_file"   to  use  ONLY  the  system-supplied  default
       Certification Authority certificates.

       Specify "tls_append_default_CA = no" to prevent Postfix from appending the  system-supplied  default  CAs
       and trusting third-party certificates.

       By  default (see smtpd_tls_ask_ccert), client certificates are not requested, and smtpd_tls_CAfile should
       remain empty. If you  do  make  use  of  client  certificates,  the  distinguished  names  (DNs)  of  the
       Certification  Authorities  listed  in  smtpd_tls_CAfile are sent to the remote SMTP client in the client
       certificate request message. MUAs with multiple  client  certificates  may  use  the  list  of  preferred
       Certification Authorities to select the correct client certificate.  You may want to put your "preferred"
       CA or CAs in this file, and install other trusted CAs in $smtpd_tls_CApath.

       Example:

       smtpd_tls_CAfile = /etc/postfix/CAcert.pem

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_CApath</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       A directory containing (PEM format) CA certificates of root CAs trusted to sign either remote SMTP client
       certificates  or  intermediate  CA certificates. Do not forget to create the necessary "hash" links with,
       for example, "$OPENSSL_HOME/bin/c_rehash /etc/postfix/certs". To use  smtpd_tls_CApath  in  chroot  mode,
       this directory (or a copy) must be inside the chroot jail.

       Specify  "smtpd_tls_CApath  =  /path/to/system_CA_directory"  to  use  ONLY  the  system-supplied default
       Certification Authority certificates.

       Specify "tls_append_default_CA = no" to prevent Postfix from appending the  system-supplied  default  CAs
       and trusting third-party certificates.

       By  default (see smtpd_tls_ask_ccert), client certificates are not requested, and smtpd_tls_CApath should
       remain  empty.  In  contrast  to  smtpd_tls_CAfile,  DNs  of  Certification  Authorities   installed   in
       $smtpd_tls_CApath  are  not included in the client certificate request message. MUAs with multiple client
       certificates may use the list of  preferred  Certification  Authorities  to  select  the  correct  client
       certificate.   You  may  want  to  put  your  "preferred" CA or CAs in $smtpd_tls_CAfile, and install the
       remaining trusted CAs in $smtpd_tls_CApath.

       Example:

       smtpd_tls_CApath = /etc/postfix/certs

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_always_issue_session_ids</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Force the Postfix SMTP server to issue a TLS session id, even when TLS  session  caching  is  turned  off
       (smtpd_tls_session_cache_database is empty). This behavior is compatible with Postfix &lt; 2.3.

       With  Postfix  2.3  and  later the Postfix SMTP server can disable session id generation when TLS session
       caching is turned off. This keeps remote SMTP clients from caching sessions that almost certainly  cannot
       be re-used.

       By default, the Postfix SMTP server always generates TLS session ids. This works around a known defect in
       mail  client  applications  such  as  MS Outlook, and may also prevent interoperability issues with other
       MTAs.

       Example:

       smtpd_tls_always_issue_session_ids = no

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_ask_ccert</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Ask a remote SMTP client for a client certificate. This information is needed for certificate based  mail
       relaying with, for example, the permit_tls_clientcerts feature.

       Some clients such as Netscape will either complain if no certificate is available (for the list of CAs in
       $smtpd_tls_CAfile)  or  will  offer multiple client certificates to choose from. This may be annoying, so
       this option is "off" by default.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_auth_only</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       When TLS encryption is optional in the Postfix SMTP server, do not announce or accept SASL authentication
       over unencrypted connections.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_ccert_verifydepth</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>9)</b></h4><pre>
       The verification depth for remote SMTP client certificates. A depth of 1 is sufficient if the issuing  CA
       is listed in a local CA file.

       The  default  verification  depth  is  9  (the  OpenSSL  default)  for compatibility with earlier Postfix
       behavior. Prior to Postfix 2.5, the default value was 5, but the limit was not actually enforced. If  you
       have set this to a lower non-default value, certificates with longer trust chains may now fail to verify.
       Certificate chains with 1 or 2 CAs are common, deeper chains are more rare and any number between 5 and 9
       should  suffice  in  practice.  You  can  choose  a  lower number if, for example, you trust certificates
       directly signed by an issuing CA but not any CAs it delegates to.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_cert_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       File with the Postfix SMTP server RSA certificate in PEM format.  This file may also contain the  Postfix
       SMTP  server  private  RSA  key.   With  Postfix  &gt;=  3.4  the preferred way to configure server keys and
       certificates is via the "smtpd_tls_chain_files" parameter.

       Public Internet MX hosts without certificates signed by a "reputable" CA must generate, and  be  prepared
       to  present  to most clients, a self-signed or private-CA signed certificate. The client will not be able
       to authenticate the server, but unless it is running Postfix 2.3  or  similar  software,  it  will  still
       insist on a server certificate.

       For  servers that are <b>not</b> public Internet MX hosts, Postfix supports configurations with no certificates.
       This entails the use of just the anonymous TLS ciphers, which are not supported by typical SMTP  clients.
       Since  some  clients  may  not  fall back to plain text after a TLS handshake failure, a certificate-less
       Postfix SMTP server will be unable to receive email from some TLS-enabled clients.  To  avoid  accidental
       configurations   with   no  certificates,  Postfix  enables  certificate-less  operation  only  when  the
       administrator explicitly sets "smtpd_tls_cert_file = none". This ensures that  new  Postfix  SMTP  server
       configurations will not accidentally enable TLS without certificates.

       Note  that  server  certificates  are  not optional in TLS 1.3. To run without certificates you'd have to
       disable the  TLS  1.3  protocol  by  including  '!TLSv1.3'  in  "smtpd_tls_protocols"  and  perhaps  also
       "smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols".    It  is  simpler  instead  to  just  configure  a  certificate  chain.
       Certificate-less operation is not recommended.

       Both RSA and DSA certificates are supported.  When both types are present,  the  cipher  used  determines
       which  certificate  will  be  presented  to the client.  For Netscape and OpenSSL clients without special
       cipher choices the RSA certificate is preferred.

       To enable a remote SMTP client to verify the Postfix SMTP server certificate, the issuing CA certificates
       must be made available to the client.  You  should  include  the  required  certificates  in  the  server
       certificate file, the server certificate first, then the issuing CA(s) (bottom-up order).

       Example:  the  certificate  for  "server.example.com"  was issued by "intermediate CA" which itself has a
       certificate of "root CA".  Create the  server.pem  file  with  "cat  server_cert.pem  intermediate_CA.pem
       root_CA.pem &gt; server.pem".

       If  you  also  want to verify client certificates issued by these CAs, you can add the CA certificates to
       the smtpd_tls_CAfile, in which case it  is  not  necessary  to  have  them  in  the  smtpd_tls_cert_file,
       smtpd_tls_dcert_file (obsolete) or smtpd_tls_eccert_file.

       A  certificate  supplied  here  must  be  usable as an SSL server certificate and hence pass the "openssl
       verify -purpose sslserver ..." test.

       Example:

       smtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/postfix/server.pem

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_chain_files</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       List of one or more PEM files, each holding one or more private keys directly followed by a corresponding
       certificate chain.  The file names are separated by commas and/or whitespace.  This  parameter  obsoletes
       the  legacy  algorithm-specific key and certificate file settings.  When this parameter is non-empty, the
       legacy parameters are ignored, and a warning is logged if any are also non-empty.

       With the proliferation of multiple private  key  algorithms-which,  as  of  OpenSSL  1.1.1,  include  DSA
       (obsolete),  RSA,  ECDSA,  Ed25519 and Ed448-it is increasingly impractical to use separate parameters to
       configure the key and certificate chain for each algorithm.   Therefore,  Postfix  now  supports  storing
       multiple keys and corresponding certificate chains in a single file or in a set of files.

       Each  key must appear <b>immediately</b> <b>before</b> the corresponding certificate, optionally followed by additional
       issuer certificates that complete the certificate chain for that key.  When multiple files are specified,
       they are equivalent to a single file that is concatenated from those files in  the  given  order.   Thus,
       while  a  key must always precede its certificate and issuer chain, it can be in a separate file, so long
       as that file is listed immediately before the file that holds the corresponding certificate chain.   Once
       all  the files are concatenated, the sequence of PEM objects must be: <u>key1,</u> <u>cert1,</u> <u>[chain1],</u> <u>key2,</u> <u>cert2,</u>
       <u>[chain2],</u> <u>...,</u> <u>keyN,</u> <u>certN,</u> <u>[chainN].</u>

       Storing the private key in the same file as the corresponding certificate is more reliable.  With the key
       and certificate in separate files, there is a chance that during key rollover  a  Postfix  process  might
       load  a private key and certificate from separate files that don't match.  Various operational errors may
       even result in a persistent broken configuration in which the certificate does not match the private key.

       The file or files must contain at most one key of each type.  If, for example, two or more RSA  keys  and
       corresponding  chains  are  listed,  depending on the version of OpenSSL either only the last one will be
       used or a configuration error may be detected.  Note that while  "Ed25519"  and  "Ed448"  are  considered
       separate  algorithms,  the various ECDSA curves (typically one of prime256v1, secp384r1 or secp521r1) are
       considered as different parameters of a single "ECDSA" algorithm, so it  is  not  presently  possible  to
       configure keys for more than one ECDSA curve.

       RSA  is  still  the most widely supported algorithm.  Presently (late 2018), ECDSA support is common, but
       not yet universal, and Ed25519 and Ed448  support  is  mostly  absent.   Therefore,  an  RSA  key  should
       generally be configured, along with any additional keys for the other algorithms when desired.

       Example (separate files for each key and corresponding certificate chain):

           /etc/postfix/main.cf:
               smtpd_tls_chain_files =
                   ${config_directory}/ed25519.pem,
                   ${config_directory}/ed448.pem,
                   ${config_directory}/rsa.pem

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_cipherlist</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Obsolete  Postfix  &lt;  2.3  control  for  the  Postfix  SMTP  server TLS cipher list. It is easy to create
       interoperability problems by choosing a non-default cipher list. Do not use a non-default TLS  cipherlist
       for  MX  hosts on the public Internet. Clients that begin the TLS handshake, but are unable to agree on a
       common cipher, may not be able to send any email to the SMTP server. Using a restricted cipher  list  may
       be more appropriate for a dedicated MSA or an internal mailhub, where one can exert some control over the
       TLS software and settings of the connecting clients.

       <b>Note:</b> do not use "" quotes around the parameter value.

       This  feature  is  available  with  Postfix  version  2.2. It is not used with Postfix 2.3 and later; use
       smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers instead.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_ciphers</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>medium)</b></h4><pre>
       The minimum TLS cipher grade that the Postfix SMTP server will use  with  opportunistic  TLS  encryption.
       Cipher  types  listed  in smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers are excluded from the base definition of the selected
       cipher grade.  The default value is "medium" for Postfix releases after the middle of 2015, "export"  for
       older releases.

       When  TLS  is  mandatory  the  cipher  grade  is chosen via the smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers configuration
       parameter, see there for syntax details.

       This  feature  is  available  in  Postfix  2.6  and  later.  With  earlier  Postfix  releases  only   the
       smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers  parameter  is  implemented,  and  opportunistic  TLS always uses "export" or
       better (i.e. all) ciphers.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_dcert_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       File with the Postfix SMTP server DSA certificate in PEM format.  This file may also contain the  Postfix
       SMTP server private DSA key.  The DSA algorithm is obsolete and should not be used.

       See the discussion under smtpd_tls_cert_file for more details.

       Example:

       smtpd_tls_dcert_file = /etc/postfix/server-dsa.pem

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       File with DH parameters that the Postfix SMTP server should use with non-export EDH ciphers.

       With Postfix &gt;= 3.7, built with OpenSSL version is 3.0.0 or later, if the parameter value is either empty
       or "<b>auto</b>", then the DH parameter selection is delegated to the OpenSSL library, which selects appropriate
       parameters  based  on  the  TLS  handshake.  This choice is likely to be the most interoperable with SMTP
       clients using various TLS libraries, and custom local parameters are no  longer  recommended  when  using
       Postfix &gt;= 3.7 built against OpenSSL 3.0.0.

       The  best-practice  choice  of  parameters  uses  a 2048-bit prime.  This is fine, despite the historical
       "1024" in the parameter name.  Do not be tempted to use much larger values, performance degrades quickly,
       and you may also cease to interoperate with some  mainstream  SMTP  clients.   As  of  Postfix  3.1,  the
       compiled-in  default  prime  is  2048-bits,  and  it  is  not strictly necessary, though perhaps somewhat
       beneficial to generate custom DH parameters.

       Instead of using the exact same parameter sets as distributed with other TLS packages, it is more  secure
       to generate your own set of parameters with something like the following commands:

           openssl dhparam -out /etc/postfix/dh2048.pem 2048
           openssl dhparam -out /etc/postfix/dh1024.pem 1024
           # As of Postfix 3.6, export-grade 512-bit DH parameters are no longer
           # supported or needed.
           openssl dhparam -out /etc/postfix/dh512.pem 512

       It  is  safe  to share the same DH parameters between multiple Postfix instances.  If you prefer, you can
       generate separate parameters for each instance.

       If you want to take maximal advantage of ciphers that offer  forward  secrecy  see  the  Getting  started
       section of FORWARD_SECRECY_README.  The full document conveniently presents all information about Postfix
       "perfect"  forward secrecy support in one place: what forward secrecy is, how to tweak settings, and what
       you can expect to see when Postfix uses ciphers with forward secrecy.

       Example:

       smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file = /etc/postfix/dh2048.pem

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_dh512_param_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       File with DH parameters that the Postfix SMTP server should  use  with  export-grade  EDH  ciphers.   The
       default  SMTP  server  cipher  grade is "medium" with Postfix releases after the middle of 2015, and as a
       result export-grade cipher suites are by default not used.

       With Postfix &gt;= 3.6 export-grade Diffie-Hellman key exchange is no longer supported, and  this  parameter
       is silently ignored.

       See also the discussion under the smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file configuration parameter.

       Example:

       smtpd_tls_dh512_param_file = /etc/postfix/dh_512.pem

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later, but is ignored in Postfix 3.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_dkey_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtpd_tls_dcert_file)</b></h4><pre>
       File  with  the  Postfix  SMTP  server DSA private key in PEM format.  This file may be combined with the
       Postfix SMTP server DSA certificate file specified  with  $smtpd_tls_dcert_file.  The  DSA  algorithm  is
       obsolete and should not be used.

       The private key must be accessible without a pass-phrase, i.e. it must not be encrypted. File permissions
       should grant read-only access to the system superuser account ("root"), and no access to anyone else.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_eccert_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       File  with  the  Postfix  SMTP  server  ECDSA  certificate in PEM format.  This file may also contain the
       Postfix SMTP server private ECDSA key.  With Postfix &gt;= 3.4 the preferred way to  configure  server  keys
       and certificates is via the "smtpd_tls_chain_files" parameter.

       See the discussion under smtpd_tls_cert_file for more details.

       Example:

       smtpd_tls_eccert_file = /etc/postfix/ecdsa-scert.pem

       This  feature  is  available  in  Postfix 2.6 and later, when Postfix is compiled and linked with OpenSSL
       1.0.0 or later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_eckey_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtpd_tls_eccert_file)</b></h4><pre>
       File with the Postfix SMTP server ECDSA private key in PEM format.  This file may be  combined  with  the
       Postfix  SMTP  server  ECDSA certificate file specified with $smtpd_tls_eccert_file.  With Postfix &gt;= 3.4
       the preferred way to configure server keys and certificates is via the "smtpd_tls_chain_files" parameter.

       The private key must be accessible without a pass-phrase, i.e. it must not be encrypted. File permissions
       should grant read-only access to the system superuser account ("root"), and no access to anyone else.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later, when Postfix is  compiled  and  linked  with  OpenSSL
       1.0.0 or later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The  Postfix SMTP server security grade for ephemeral elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman (EECDH) key exchange.
       As of Postfix 3.6, the value of this parameter is always ignored, and Postfix behaves as though the  <b>auto</b>
       value (described below) was chosen.

       This feature is not used as of Postfix 3.6. Do not specify.

       The available choices are:

       <b>auto</b>   Use  the  most  preferred curve that is supported by both the client and the server.  This setting
              requires Postfix &gt;= 3.2 compiled and linked with OpenSSL &gt;= 1.0.2.  This is  the  default  setting
              under the above conditions (and the only setting used with Postfix &gt;= 3.6).

       <b>none</b>   Don't  use  EECDH.  Ciphers  based  on EECDH key exchange will be disabled. This is the default in
              Postfix versions 2.6 and 2.7.

       <b>strong</b> Use EECDH with approximately 128 bits of security at a reasonable computational cost. This is  the
              default in Postfix versions 2.8-3.5.

       <b>ultra</b>  Use  EECDH  with  approximately  192  bits of security at computational cost that is approximately
              twice as high as 128 bit strength ECC.

       If you want to take maximal advantage of ciphers that offer  forward  secrecy  see  the  Getting  started
       section of FORWARD_SECRECY_README.  The full document conveniently presents all information about Postfix
       "perfect"  forward secrecy support in one place: what forward secrecy is, how to tweak settings, and what
       you can expect to see when Postfix uses ciphers with forward secrecy.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later, when it is compiled and linked with OpenSSL 1.0.0  or
       later on platforms where EC algorithms have not been disabled by the vendor.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_enable_rpk</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Request  that  remote  SMTP  clients send an RFC7250 raw public key instead of an X.509 certificate, when
       asking for or requiring client authentication. This feature is ignored when there is no  raw  public  key
       support in the local TLS implementation.

       The  Postfix SMTP server will log a warning when "smtpd_tls_enable_rpk = yes", but the remote SMTP client
       sends a certificate, the certificate's public key fingerprint does not match a check_ccert_access  table,
       while  the  certificate  fingerprint  does match a check_ccert_access table. The remote SMTP client would
       lose access when  it  starts  sending  a  raw  public  key  instead  of  a  certificate,  after  its  TLS
       implementation is updated with raw public key support.

       The  Postfix  SMTP  server  always  sends  a raw public key instead of a certificate, if solicited by the
       remote SMTP client and the local TLS implementation supports raw public  keys.  If  the  client  sends  a
       server  name indication with an SNI TLS extension, and tls_server_sni_maps is configured, the server will
       extract a raw public key from the indicated certificate.

       Sample commands to compute certificate and public key SHA256 digests:

       # SHA256 digest of the first certificate in "cert.pem"
       $ openssl x509 -in cert.pem -outform DER | openssl dgst -sha256 -c

       # SHA256 digest of the SPKI of the first certificate in "cert.pem"
       $ openssl x509 -in cert.pem -pubkey -noout |
           openssl pkey -pubin -outform DER | openssl dgst -sha256 -c

       # SHA256 digest of the SPKI of the first private key in "pkey.pem"
       $ openssl pkey -in pkey.pem -pubout -outform DER |
           openssl dgst -sha256 -c

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.9 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       List of ciphers or cipher types to exclude from the SMTP server cipher list at all TLS  security  levels.
       Excluding  valid  ciphers  can  create  interoperability  problems.  DO  NOT exclude ciphers unless it is
       essential to do so. This is not an OpenSSL cipherlist; it is a simple list separated by whitespace and/or
       commas. The elements are a single cipher, or one or more "+" separated cipher properties, in  which  case
       only ciphers matching <b>all</b> the properties are excluded.

       Examples (some of these will cause problems):

           smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers = aNULL
           smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers = MD5, DES
           smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers = DES+MD5
           smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers = AES256-SHA, DES-CBC3-MD5
           smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers = kEDH+aRSA

       The  first  setting disables anonymous ciphers. The next setting disables ciphers that use the MD5 digest
       algorithm or the (single) DES encryption algorithm. The next setting disables ciphers that  use  MD5  and
       DES  together.   The  next  setting  disables  the  two ciphers "AES256-SHA" and "DES-CBC3-MD5". The last
       setting disables ciphers that use "EDH" key exchange with RSA authentication.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_fingerprint_digest</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The message digest algorithm to construct remote  SMTP  client-certificate  fingerprints  or  public  key
       fingerprints (Postfix 2.9 and later) for <b>check_ccert_access</b> and <b>permit_tls_clientcerts</b>.

       The  default  algorithm  is  <b>sha256</b> with Postfix &gt;= 3.6 and the <b>compatibility_level</b> set to 3.6 or higher.
       With Postfix &lt;= 3.5, the default algorithm is <b>md5</b>.

       The best-practice algorithm is now <b>sha256</b>. Recent advances in hash function cryptanalysis have led to md5
       and sha1 being deprecated in favor of sha256.  However, as long as there are no known "second  pre-image"
       attacks  against the older algorithms, their use in this context, though not recommended, is still likely
       safe.

       While additional digest algorithms are often available with  OpenSSL's  libcrypto,  only  those  used  by
       libssl  in  SSL cipher suites are available to Postfix.  You'll likely find support for md5, sha1, sha256
       and sha512.

       To find the fingerprint of a specific certificate file, with a specific digest algorithm, run:

           $ openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -<u>digest</u> -in <u>certfile</u>.pem

       The text to the right of "=" sign is the desired fingerprint.  For example:

           $ openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256 -in cert.pem
           SHA256 Fingerprint=D4:6A:AB:19:24:...:A6:CB:66:82:C0:8E:9B:EE:29:A8:1A

       To extract the public key fingerprint from an X.509 certificate, you need to extract the public key  from
       the  certificate  and  compute  the  appropriate  digest  of  its  DER (ASN.1) encoding. With OpenSSL the
       "-pubkey" option of the "x509" command extracts the public key always in "PEM" format. We pipe the result
       to another OpenSSL command that converts the key to DER and then to the "dgst"  command  to  compute  the
       fingerprint.

       Example:

           $ openssl x509 -in cert.pem -noout -pubkey |
               openssl pkey -pubin -outform DER |
               openssl dgst -sha256 -c
           (stdin)= 64:3f:1f:f6:e5:1e:d4:2a:56:8b:fc:09:1a:61:98:b5:bc:7c:60:58

       The Postfix SMTP server and client log the peer (leaf) certificate fingerprint and public key fingerprint
       when the TLS loglevel is 2 or higher.

       Example: client-certificate access table, with sha256 fingerprints:

           /etc/postfix/main.cf:
               smtpd_tls_fingerprint_digest = sha256
               smtpd_client_restrictions =
                   check_ccert_access hash:/etc/postfix/access,
                   reject
           /etc/postfix/access:
               # Action folded to next line...
               AF:88:7C:AD:51:95:6F:36:96:...:01:FB:2E:48:CD:AB:49:25:A2:3B
                   OK
               85:16:78:FD:73:6E:CE:70:E0:...:5F:0D:3C:C8:6D:C4:2C:24:59:E1
                   permit_auth_destination

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_key_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$smtpd_tls_cert_file)</b></h4><pre>
       File  with  the  Postfix  SMTP  server RSA private key in PEM format.  This file may be combined with the
       Postfix SMTP server RSA certificate file specified with $smtpd_tls_cert_file.  With Postfix  &gt;=  3.4  the
       preferred way to configure server keys and certificates is via the "smtpd_tls_chain_files" parameter.

       The private key must be accessible without a pass-phrase, i.e. it must not be encrypted. File permissions
       should grant read-only access to the system superuser account ("root"), and no access to anyone else.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_loglevel</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable  additional  Postfix  SMTP  server  logging of TLS activity.  Each logging level also includes the
       information that is logged at a lower logging level.

              0 Disable logging of TLS activity.

              1 Log only a summary message on TLS handshake  completion  -  no  logging  of  client  certificate
              trust-chain  verification errors if client certificate verification is not required.  With Postfix
              2.8 and earlier, log the summary message, peer certificate summary information and unconditionally
              log trust-chain verification errors.

              2 Also enable verbose logging in the Postfix TLS library, log session cache operations, and enable
              OpenSSL logging of the progress of the SSL handshake.

              3 Also log hexadecimal and ASCII dump of TLS negotiation process.

              4 Also log hexadecimal and ASCII dump of complete transmission after STARTTLS.

       Do not use "smtpd_tls_loglevel = 2" or higher except in case of problems. Use of loglevel 4  is  strongly
       discouraged.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>medium)</b></h4><pre>
       The  minimum  TLS  cipher  grade that the Postfix SMTP server will use with mandatory TLS encryption. The
       default grade ("medium") is sufficiently strong that any benefit from globally restricting  TLS  sessions
       to a more stringent grade is likely negligible, especially given the fact that many implementations still
       do  not  offer  any  stronger  ("high"  grade) ciphers, while those that do, will always use "high" grade
       ciphers. So insisting on "high" grade ciphers is generally counter-productive. Allowing "export" or "low"
       ciphers is typically not a good idea, as systems limited to just these are limited to obsolete  browsers.
       No known SMTP clients fail to support at least one "medium" or "high" grade cipher.

       The following cipher grades are supported:

       <b>high</b>   Enable  only  "HIGH"  grade  OpenSSL  ciphers.  The  underlying  cipherlist  is  specified via the
              tls_high_cipherlist configuration parameter, which you are strongly encouraged to not change.

       <b>medium</b> Enable "MEDIUM" grade  or  stronger  OpenSSL  ciphers.  These  use  128-bit  or  longer  symmetric
              bulk-encryption  keys.  This  is  the  default  minimum strength for mandatory TLS encryption. The
              underlying cipherlist is specified via the tls_medium_cipherlist  configuration  parameter,  which
              you are strongly encouraged not to change.

       <b>null</b>   Enable  only  the  "NULL"  OpenSSL ciphers, these provide authentication without encryption.  This
              setting is only appropriate in the rare case that all clients are prepared  to  use  NULL  ciphers
              (not   normally  enabled  in  TLS  clients).  The  underlying  cipherlist  is  specified  via  the
              tls_null_cipherlist configuration parameter, which you are strongly encouraged not to change.

       <b>low</b>    Enable "LOW" grade or stronger OpenSSL ciphers.  In Postfix &gt;= 3.8 this  cipher  grade  is  always
              identical  to  "medium".   Recent  versions of OpenSSL do not support any "LOW" grade ciphers.  In
              earlier Postfix releases the  underlying  cipherlist  was  specified  via  the  tls_low_cipherlist
              configuration  parameter,  which  you are strongly encouraged not to change.  This obsolete cipher
              grade SHOULD NOT be used.

       <b>export</b> Enable "EXPORT" grade or stronger OpenSSL ciphers.  In Postfix &gt;= 3.8 this cipher grade is  always
              identical  to "medium".  Recent versions of OpenSSL do not support any "EXPORT" grade ciphers.  In
              earlier Postfix releases the underlying cipherlist was  specified  via  the  tls_export_cipherlist
              configuration  parameter,  which  you are strongly encouraged not to change.  This obsolete cipher
              grade SHOULD NOT be used.

       Cipher types listed in smtpd_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers or smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers are excluded from
       the base definition of the selected cipher grade. See smtpd_tls_ciphers for cipher controls that apply to
       opportunistic TLS.

       The underlying cipherlists for grades  other  than  "null"  include  anonymous  ciphers,  but  these  are
       automatically  filtered  out if the server is configured to ask for remote SMTP client certificates.  You
       are very unlikely to need to take any steps to exclude anonymous ciphers, they are excluded automatically
       as required.  If you must exclude anonymous  ciphers  even  when  Postfix  does  not  need  or  use  peer
       certificates,  set  "smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers  =  aNULL".  To exclude anonymous ciphers only when TLS is
       enforced, set "smtpd_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers = aNULL".

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_mandatory_exclude_ciphers</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Additional list of ciphers or cipher types to exclude  from  the  Postfix  SMTP  server  cipher  list  at
       mandatory   TLS   security   levels.   This  list  works  in  addition  to  the  exclusions  listed  with
       smtpd_tls_exclude_ciphers (see there for syntax details).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       TLS protocols accepted by the Postfix SMTP server with mandatory TLS encryption.  If the list  is  empty,
       the  server  supports all available TLS protocol versions.  A non-empty value is a list of protocol names
       to include or exclude, separated by whitespace, commas or colons.

       The valid protocol names (see <b><a href="../man3/SSL_get_version.3.html">SSL_get_version</a></b>(3)) are "SSLv2", "SSLv3", "TLSv1", "TLSv1.1", "TLSv1.2" and
       "TLSv1.3".  Starting with Postfix 3.6, the default value is "&gt;=TLSv1", which sets TLS 1.0 as  the  lowest
       supported  TLS protocol version (see below).  Older releases use the "!" exclusion syntax, also described
       below.

       As of Postfix 3.6, the preferred way to limit the range of acceptable protocols  is  to  set  the  lowest
       acceptable  TLS  protocol  version  and/or the highest acceptable TLS protocol version.  To set the lower
       bound include an element of the form: "&gt;=<u>version</u>" where <u>version</u> is a either one of the TLS protocol names
       listed above, or a hexadecimal number corresponding to the desired TLS protocol  version  (0301  for  TLS
       1.0, 0302 for TLS 1.1, etc.).  For the upper bound, use "&lt;=<u>version</u>".  There must be no whitespace between
       the "&gt;=" or "&lt;=" symbols and the protocol name or number.

       Hexadecimal  protocol numbers make it possible to specify protocol bounds for TLS versions that are known
       to OpenSSL, but might not be known to Postfix.  They cannot be used with  the  legacy  exclusion  syntax.
       Leading  "0"  or  "0x"  prefixes  are supported, but not required.  Therefore, "301", "0301", "0x301" and
       "0x0301" are all equivalent to "TLSv1".  Hexadecimal versions unknown to OpenSSL will  fail  to  set  the
       upper  or  lower  bound,  and  a  warning  will be logged.  Hexadecimal versions should only be used when
       Postfix is linked with some future version of OpenSSL that supports TLS 1.4 or later,  but  Postfix  does
       not yet support a symbolic name for that protocol version.

       Hexadecimal example (Postfix &gt;= 3.6):

           # Allow only TLS 1.2 through (hypothetical) TLS 1.4, once supported
           # in some future version of OpenSSL (presently a warning is logged).
           smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols = &gt;=TLSv1.2, &lt;=0305
           # Allow only TLS 1.2 and up:
           smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols = &gt;=0x0303

       With  Postfix  &lt;  3.6  there  is  no  support for a minimum or maximum version, and the protocol range is
       configured via protocol exclusions.  To require at least TLS 1.0,  set  "smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols  =
       !SSLv2,  !SSLv3".   Listing the protocols to include, rather than protocols to exclude, is supported, but
       not recommended.  The exclusion form more accurately matches the underlying OpenSSL interface.

       Support for "TLSv1.3" was introduced in  OpenSSL  1.1.1.   Disabling  this  protocol  via  "!TLSv1.3"  is
       supported since Postfix 3.4 (or patch releases &gt;= 3.0.14, 3.1.10, 3.2.7 and 3.3.2).

       Example:

       # Preferred syntax with Postfix &gt;= 3.6:
       smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols = &gt;=TLSv1.2, &lt;=TLSv1.3
       # Legacy syntax:
       smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3, !TLSv1, !TLSv1.1

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_protocols</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>'postconf</b> <b>-d'</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       TLS  protocols  accepted  by  the  Postfix  SMTP server with opportunistic TLS encryption. If the list is
       empty, the server supports all available TLS protocol versions.  A non-empty value is a list of  protocol
       names to include or exclude, separated by whitespace, commas or colons.

       The valid protocol names (see <b><a href="../man3/SSL_get_version.3.html">SSL_get_version</a></b>(3)) are "SSLv2", "SSLv3", "TLSv1", "TLSv1.1", "TLSv1.2" and
       "TLSv1.3".   Starting  with Postfix 3.6, the default value is "&gt;=TLSv1", which sets TLS 1.0 as the lowest
       supported TLS protocol version (see below).  Older releases use the "!" exclusion syntax, also  described
       below.

       As  of  Postfix  3.6,  the  preferred way to limit the range of acceptable protocols is to set the lowest
       acceptable TLS protocol version and/or the highest acceptable TLS protocol version.   To  set  the  lower
       bound include an element of the form: "&gt;=<u>version</u>" where <u>version</u> is a either one of the TLS protocol names
       listed  above,  or  a  hexadecimal number corresponding to the desired TLS protocol version (0301 for TLS
       1.0, 0302 for TLS 1.1, etc.).  For the upper bound, use "&lt;=<u>version</u>".  There must be no whitespace between
       the "&gt;=" or "&lt;=" symbols and the protocol name or number.

       Hexadecimal protocol numbers make it possible to specify protocol bounds for TLS versions that are  known
       to  OpenSSL,  but  might  not be known to Postfix.  They cannot be used with the legacy exclusion syntax.
       Leading "0" or "0x" prefixes are supported, but not required.   Therefore,  "301",  "0301",  "0x301"  and
       "0x0301"  are  all  equivalent  to "TLSv1".  Hexadecimal versions unknown to OpenSSL will fail to set the
       upper or lower bound, and a warning will be logged.   Hexadecimal  versions  should  only  be  used  when
       Postfix  is  linked  with some future version of OpenSSL that supports TLS 1.4 or later, but Postfix does
       not yet support a symbolic name for that protocol version.

       Hexadecimal example (Postfix &gt;= 3.6):

           # Allow only TLS 1.0 through (hypothetical) TLS 1.4, once supported
           # in some future version of OpenSSL (presently a warning is logged).
           smtpd_tls_protocols = &gt;=TLSv1, &lt;=0305
           # Allow only TLS 1.0 and up:
           smtpd_tls_protocols = &gt;=0x0301

       With Postfix &lt; 3.6 there is no support for a minimum or  maximum  version,  and  the  protocol  range  is
       configured  via  protocol  exclusions.   To  require at least TLS 1.0, set "smtpd_tls_protocols = !SSLv2,
       !SSLv3".  Listing the protocols to include, rather than protocols  to  exclude,  is  supported,  but  not
       recommended.  The exclusion form more accurately matches the underlying OpenSSL interface.

       Support  for  "TLSv1.3"  was  introduced  in  OpenSSL  1.1.1.   Disabling this protocol via "!TLSv1.3" is
       supported since Postfix 3.4 (or patch releases &gt;= 3.0.14, 3.1.10, 3.2.7 and 3.3.2).

       Example:
       # Preferred syntax with Postfix &gt;= 3.6:
       smtpd_tls_protocols = &gt;=TLSv1, &lt;=TLSv1.3
       # Legacy syntax:
       smtpd_tls_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_received_header</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Request that the Postfix SMTP server produces Received:  message headers that include  information  about
       the  protocol and cipher used, as well as the remote SMTP client CommonName and client certificate issuer
       CommonName.  This is disabled by default, as the information may be modified  in  transit  through  other
       mail servers.  Only information that was recorded by the final destination can be trusted.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_req_ccert</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       With  mandatory  TLS  encryption,  require a trusted remote SMTP client certificate in order to allow TLS
       connections to proceed.  This option implies "smtpd_tls_ask_ccert = yes".

       When TLS encryption is optional, this setting is ignored with a warning written to the mail log.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_security_level</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       The SMTP TLS security level for the Postfix SMTP server;  when  a  non-empty  value  is  specified,  this
       overrides  the  obsolete  parameters  smtpd_use_tls and smtpd_enforce_tls. This parameter is ignored with
       "smtpd_tls_wrappermode = yes".

       Specify one of the following security levels:

       <b>none</b>   TLS will not be used.

       <b>may</b>    Opportunistic TLS: announce STARTTLS support to remote SMTP  clients,  but  do  not  require  that
              clients use TLS encryption.

       <b>encrypt</b>
              Mandatory  TLS  encryption:  announce  STARTTLS  support  to  remote  SMTP clients, and reject all
              plaintext commands except HELO, EHLO, XCLIENT, STARTTLS, NOOP, QUIT, and (Postfix  &gt;=  3.9)  HELP.
              According  to  RFC  2487  this  MUST  NOT be applied in case of a publicly-referenced SMTP server.
              Instead, this should be used on dedicated servers, for example submission (port 587).

       Note 1: the "fingerprint", "verify" and "secure" levels are not supported here.  The Postfix SMTP  server
       logs a warning and uses "encrypt" instead.  To verify remote SMTP client certificates, see TLS_README for
       a discussion of the smtpd_tls_ask_ccert, smtpd_tls_req_ccert, and permit_tls_clientcerts features.

       Note 2: The parameter setting "smtpd_tls_security_level = encrypt" implies "smtpd_tls_auth_only = yes".

       Note 3: when invoked via "sendmail -bs", Postfix will never offer STARTTLS due to insufficient privileges
       to access the server private key. This is intended behavior.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_session_cache_database</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Name  of  the file containing the optional Postfix SMTP server TLS session cache. Specify a database type
       that supports enumeration, such as <b>btree</b> or <b>sdbm</b>; there is no need to  support  concurrent  access.   The
       file  is  created  if it does not exist. The <b><a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html">smtpd</a></b>(8) daemon does not use this parameter directly, rather
       the cache is implemented indirectly in the <b><a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html">tlsmgr</a></b>(8) daemon. This means that per-smtpd-instance master.cf
       overrides of this parameter are not effective. Note  that  each  of  the  cache  databases  supported  by
       <b><a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html">tlsmgr</a></b>(8)  daemon:  $smtpd_tls_session_cache_database, $smtp_tls_session_cache_database (and with Postfix
       2.3 and later $lmtp_tls_session_cache_database), needs to be stored separately. It is not  at  this  time
       possible to store multiple caches in a single database.

       Note: <b>dbm</b> databases are not suitable. TLS session objects are too large.

       As  of version 2.5, Postfix no longer uses root privileges when opening this file. The file should now be
       stored under the Postfix-owned data_directory. As a migration aid, an attempt to open the  file  under  a
       non-Postfix directory is redirected to the Postfix-owned data_directory, and a warning is logged.

       As  of Postfix 2.11 the preferred mechanism for session resumption is RFC 5077 TLS session tickets, which
       don't require server-side storage.  Consequently, for Postfix &gt;= 2.11 this parameter should generally  be
       left  empty.  TLS session tickets require an OpenSSL library (at least version 0.9.8h) that provides full
       support for this TLS extension.  See also smtpd_tls_session_cache_timeout.

       Example:

       smtpd_tls_session_cache_database = btree:/var/lib/postfix/smtpd_scache

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_session_cache_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3600s)</b></h4><pre>
       The expiration time of Postfix SMTP server TLS session cache information. A cache  cleanup  is  performed
       periodically  every  $smtpd_tls_session_cache_timeout seconds. As with $smtpd_tls_session_cache_database,
       this parameter is  implemented  in  the  <b><a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html">tlsmgr</a></b>(8)  daemon  and  therefore  per-smtpd-instance  master.cf
       overrides are not possible.

       As  of  Postfix  2.11 this setting cannot exceed 100 days.  If set &lt;= 0, session caching is disabled, not
       just via the database, but also via RFC  5077  TLS  session  tickets,  which  don't  require  server-side
       storage.  If set to a positive value less than 2 minutes, the minimum value of 2 minutes is used instead.
       TLS  session  tickets require an OpenSSL library (at least version 0.9.8h) that provides full support for
       this TLS extension.

       Specify a non-negative time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter  suffix  that  specifies
       the  time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time
       unit is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later, and updated for TLS session ticket support in Postfix
       2.11.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_tls_wrappermode</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Run the Postfix SMTP server in TLS "wrapper" mode, instead of using the STARTTLS command.

       If  you  want  to  support  this  service,  enable  a  special  port  in  master.cf,  and   specify   "-o
       smtpd_tls_wrappermode=yes"  on  the  SMTP  server's  command line. Port 465 (submissions, formerly called
       smtps) is reserved for this purpose.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_upstream_proxy_protocol</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       The name of the proxy protocol used by an optional before-smtpd proxy agent. When a proxy agent is  used,
       this    protocol    conveys    local    and    remote    address    and    port   information.    Specify
       "smtpd_upstream_proxy_protocol = haproxy" to enable the haproxy protocol; version  2  is  supported  with
       Postfix 3.5 and later.

       NOTE:    To    use    the    nginx    proxy   with   <b><a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html">smtpd</a></b>(8),   enable   the   XCLIENT   protocol   with
       smtpd_authorized_xclient_hosts. This supports SASL authentication in the proxy  agent  (Postfix  2.9  and
       later).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.10 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_upstream_proxy_timeout</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>5s)</b></h4><pre>
       The time limit for the proxy protocol specified with the smtpd_upstream_proxy_protocol parameter.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.10 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtpd_use_tls</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Opportunistic TLS: announce STARTTLS support to remote SMTP clients, but do not require that clients  use
       TLS encryption.

       Note:  when  invoked via "<b>sendmail</b> <b>-bs</b>", Postfix will never offer STARTTLS due to insufficient privileges
       to access the server private key. This is intended behavior.

       This feature is deprecated as of Postfix 3.9. Specify smtpd_tls_security_level instead.

       This  feature  is  available  in  Postfix   2.2   and   later.   With   Postfix   2.3   and   later   use
       smtpd_tls_security_level instead.

</pre><h4><b>smtputf8_autodetect_classes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>sendmail,</b> <b>verify)</b></h4><pre>
       Detect  that  a  message  requires  SMTPUTF8  support  for  the specified mail origin classes.  This is a
       workaround to avoid chicken-and-egg problems during the initial SMTPUTF8 roll-out  in  environments  with
       pre-existing  mail  flows  that  contain UTF8. Those mail flows should not break because Postfix suddenly
       refuses to deliver such mail to down-stream MTAs that don't announce SMTPUTF8 support.

       The problem is that Postfix cannot rely solely on  the  sender's  declaration  that  a  message  requires
       SMTPUTF8  support,  because  UTF8  may  be  introduced  during  local processing (for example, the client
       hostname in Postfix's Received: header, adding @$myorigin or .$mydomain to an incomplete address, address
       rewriting, alias expansion, automatic BCC recipients, local forwarding, and changes made by header checks
       or Milter applications).

       For now,  the  default  is  to  enable  "SMTPUTF8  required"  autodetection  only  for  Postfix  sendmail
       command-line submissions and address verification probes.  This may change once SMTPUTF8 support achieves
       world  domination.   However,  sites  that  add  UTF8  content  via  local  processing (see above) should
       autodetect the need for SMTPUTF8 support for all email.

       Specify one or more of the following:

        <b>sendmail</b>
              Submission with the Postfix <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1) command.

        <b>smtpd</b> Mail received with the <b><a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html">smtpd</a></b>(8) daemon.

        <b>qmqpd</b> Mail received with the <b><a href="../man8/qmqpd.8.html">qmqpd</a></b>(8) daemon.

        <b>forward</b>
              Local forwarding or aliasing.  When a message is  received  with  "SMTPUTF8  required",  then  the
              forwarded (aliased) message always has "SMTPUTF8 required".

        <b>bounce</b>
              Submission by the <b><a href="../man8/bounce.8.html">bounce</a></b>(8) daemon.  When a message is received with "SMTPUTF8 required", then the
              delivery status notification always has "SMTPUTF8 required".

        <b>notify</b>
              Postmaster notification from the <b><a href="../man8/smtp.8.html">smtp</a></b>(8) or <b><a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html">smtpd</a></b>(8) daemon.

        <b>verify</b>
              Address verification probe from the <b><a href="../man8/verify.8.html">verify</a></b>(8) daemon.

        <b>all</b>   Enable SMTPUTF8 autodetection for all mail.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>smtputf8_enable</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable preliminary SMTPUTF8 support for the protocols described in RFC 6531, RFC 6532, and RFC 6533. This
       requires that Postfix is built to support these protocols.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>socketmap_max_reply_size</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100000)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximum allowed reply size from a socketmap server, not including the netstring encapsulation.

       This feature is available in Postfix &gt;= 3.10.

</pre><h4><b>soft_bounce</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Safety  net  to keep mail queued that would otherwise be returned to the sender.  This parameter disables
       locally-generated bounces, changes the handling  of  negative  responses  from  remote  servers,  content
       filters  or plugins, and prevents the Postfix SMTP server from rejecting mail permanently by changing 5xx
       reply codes into 4xx.  However, soft_bounce is no cure for address rewriting  mistakes  or  mail  routing
       mistakes.

       Note:  "soft_bounce  =  yes"  is  in some cases implemented by modifying server responses. Therefore, the
       response that Postfix logs may differ from the response that Postfix actually sends or receives.

       Example:

       soft_bounce = yes

</pre><h4><b>stale_lock_time</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>500s)</b></h4><pre>
       The time after which a stale exclusive mailbox lockfile is removed.  This is used for delivery to file or
       mailbox.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

</pre><h4><b>stress</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       This feature is documented in the STRESS_README document.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5 and later.

</pre><h4><b>strict_7bit_headers</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Reject mail with 8-bit text in message headers. This blocks mail from poorly written applications.

       This  feature  should  not  be  enabled  on a general purpose mail server, because it is likely to reject
       legitimate email.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>strict_8bitmime</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable both strict_7bit_headers and strict_8bitmime_body.

       This feature should not be enabled on a general purpose mail server,  because  it  is  likely  to  reject
       legitimate email.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>strict_8bitmime_body</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Reject  8-bit  message  body text without 8-bit MIME content encoding information.  This blocks mail from
       poorly written applications.

       Unfortunately, this also rejects majordomo approval requests when the  included  request  contains  valid
       8-bit  MIME  mail,  and  it  rejects bounces from mailers that do not MIME encapsulate 8-bit content (for
       example, bounces from qmail or from old versions of Postfix).

       This feature should not be enabled on a general purpose mail server,  because  it  is  likely  to  reject
       legitimate email.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>strict_mailbox_ownership</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Defer  delivery  when a mailbox file is not owned by its recipient.  The default setting is not backwards
       compatible.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.5.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>strict_mime_encoding_domain</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Reject mail with invalid Content-Transfer-Encoding: information for the  message/*  or  multipart/*  MIME
       content types.  This blocks mail from poorly written software.

       This  feature should not be enabled on a general purpose mail server, because it will reject mail after a
       single violation.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>strict_rfc821_envelopes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Require that addresses received in SMTP MAIL FROM and RCPT TO commands are enclosed  with  &lt;&gt;,  and  that
       those  addresses  do  not contain RFC 822 style comments or phrases.  This stops mail from poorly written
       software.

       By default, the Postfix SMTP server accepts RFC 822 syntax in MAIL FROM and RCPT TO addresses.

</pre><h4><b>strict_smtputf8</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable stricter enforcement of the SMTPUTF8 protocol. The Postfix SMTP  server  accepts  UTF8  sender  or
       recipient addresses only when the client requests an SMTPUTF8 mail transaction.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>sun_mailtool_compatibility</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Obsolete SUN mailtool compatibility feature. Instead, use "mailbox_delivery_lock = dotlock".

</pre><h4><b>swap_bangpath</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable  the rewriting of "site!user" into "user@site".  This is necessary if your machine is connected to
       UUCP networks.  It is enabled by default.

       Note: with Postfix version 2.2, message header address rewriting happens only when one of  the  following
       conditions is true:

       •      The message is received with the Postfix <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1) command,

       •      The message is received from a network client that matches $local_header_rewrite_clients,

       •      The message is received from the network, and the remote_header_rewrite_domain parameter specifies
              a non-empty value.

       To get the behavior before Postfix version 2.2, specify "local_header_rewrite_clients = static:all".

       Example:

       swap_bangpath = no

</pre><h4><b>syslog_facility</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>mail)</b></h4><pre>
       The  syslog  facility  of  Postfix  logging. Specify a facility as defined in syslog.<b><a href="../man5/conf.5.html">conf</a></b>(5). The default
       facility is "mail".

       Warning: a non-default syslog_facility setting takes effect only after a Postfix  process  has  completed
       initialization.  Errors during process initialization will be logged with the default facility.  Examples
       are  errors  while  parsing  the  command  line arguments, and errors while accessing the Postfix main.cf
       configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>syslog_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       A prefix that is prepended to the process name in syslog records, so that, for example,  "smtpd"  becomes
       "prefix/smtpd".

       Warning:  a  non-default  syslog_name  setting  takes  effect  only after a Postfix process has completed
       initialization. Errors during process initialization will be logged with the default name.  Examples  are
       errors  while  parsing  the  command  line  arguments,  and  errors  while  accessing the Postfix main.cf
       configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>tcp_windowsize</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>0)</b></h4><pre>
       An optional workaround for routers that break TCP window scaling.  Specify a value &gt; 0  and  &lt;  65536  to
       enable  this  feature.  With Postfix TCP servers (<b><a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html">smtpd</a></b>(8), <b><a href="../man8/qmqpd.8.html">qmqpd</a></b>(8)), this feature is implemented by the
       Postfix <b><a href="../man8/master.8.html">master</a></b>(8) daemon.

       To change this parameter without stopping Postfix, you need to first terminate all Postfix TCP servers:

           # postconf -e master_service_disable=inet
           # postfix reload

       This immediately terminates all processes that accept network connections.  Next, you enable Postfix  TCP
       servers with the updated tcp_windowsize setting:

           # postconf -e tcp_windowsize=65535 master_service_disable=
           # postfix reload

       If  you skip these steps with a running Postfix system, then the tcp_windowsize change will work only for
       Postfix TCP clients (<b><a href="../man8/smtp.8.html">smtp</a></b>(8), <b><a href="../man8/lmtp.8.html">lmtp</a></b>(8)).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_append_default_CA</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       Append the system-supplied default Certification  Authority  certificates  to  the  ones  specified  with
       *_tls_CApath  or  *_tls_CAfile.   The  default  is  "no"; this prevents Postfix from trusting third-party
       certificates and giving them relay permission with permit_tls_all_clientcerts.

       This feature  is  available  in  Postfix  2.4.15,  2.5.11,  2.6.8,  2.7.2  and  later  versions.  Specify
       "tls_append_default_CA  =  yes"  for  backwards compatibility, to avoid breaking certificate verification
       with sites that don't use permit_tls_all_clientcerts.

</pre><h4><b>tls_config_file</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>default)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional configuration file with baseline OpenSSL settings.  OpenSSL loads any SSL settings found in  the
       configuration  file  for  the  selected  application  name  (see  tls_config_name)  or  else the built-in
       application name "openssl_conf" when no application name is specified, or no corresponding  configuration
       section is present.

       With  OpenSSL  releases  1.1.1  and  1.1.1a,  applications  (including  Postfix)  can  neither specify an
       alternative configuration file, nor avoid loading the default configuration file.

       With OpenSSL 1.1.1b or later, this parameter may be set to one of:

       <b>default</b> (default)
              Load the system-wide "openssl.cnf" configuration file.

       <b>none</b> (recommended, OpenSSL 1.1.1b or later only)
              This setting disables loading of  the system-wide "openssl.cnf" file.

       <u>/absolute-path</u> (OpenSSL 1.1.1b or later only)
              Load the configuration file specified by <u>/absolute-path</u>.  With this setting it is an error for the
              file to not contain any settings for the selected tls_config_name.  There is no  fallback  to  the
              default "openssl_conf" name.

       Failures  in  processing of the built-in default configuration file, are silently ignored.  Any errors in
       loading a non-default configuration file are detected by Postfix, and cause TLS support to be disabled.

       The OpenSSL configuration file format is not documented here, beyond giving two examples.

       Example: Default settings for all applications.

           # The name 'openssl_conf' is the default application name
           # The section name to the right of the '=' sign is arbitrary,
           # any name will do, so long as it refers to the desired section.
           #
           # The name 'system_default' selects the settings applied internally
           # by the SSL library as part of SSL object creation.  Applications
           # can then apply any additional settings of their choice.
           #
           # In this example, TLS versions prior to 1.2 are disabled by default.
           #
           openssl_conf = system_wide_settings
           [system_wide_settings]
           ssl_conf = ssl_library_settings
           [ssl_library_settings]
           system_default = initial_ssl_settings
           [initial_ssl_settings]
           MinProtocol = TLSv1.2

       Example: Custom settings for an application named "postfix".

           # The mapping from an application name to the corresponding configuration
           # section must appear near the top of the file, (in what is sometimes called
           # the "default section") prior to the start of any explicitly named
           # "[sections]".  The named sections can appear in any order and don't nest.
           #
           postfix = postfix_settings
           [postfix_settings]
           ssl_conf = postfix_ssl_settings
           [postfix_ssl_settings]
           system_default = baseline_postfix_settings
           [baseline_postfix_settings]
           MinProtocol = TLSv1

       Example: Custom OpenSSL group settings.

       main.cf:
           tls_config_file = ${config_directory}/openssl.cnf
           tls_config_name = postfix

       openssl.cnf:
           postfix = postfix_settings

           [postfix_settings]
           ssl_conf = postfix_ssl_settings

           [postfix_ssl_settings]
           system_default = baseline_postfix_settings

           [baseline_postfix_settings]
           # New OpenSSL 3.5 syntax, for older releases consider
           # the Postfix default:
           #
           # Groups = X25519:X448:prime256v1:secp384r1:secp521r1:ffdhe2048:ffdhe3072
           #
           Groups = *X25519MLKEM768 / *X25519:X448 / P-256:P-384

       Caution: It is typically best to just use the default OpenSSL group settings, by setting "tls_config_file
       = none". Overly strict system-wide TLS settings will conflict with  Postfix's  opportunistic  TLS,  where
       being less restrictive is better than downgrading to cleartext SMTP.

       This feature is available in Postfix &gt;= 3.9, 3.8.1, 3.7.6, 3.6.10, and 3.5.20.

</pre><h4><b>tls_config_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       The application name passed by Postfix to OpenSSL library initialization functions.  This name is used to
       select  the  desired  configuration  "section"  in  the  OpenSSL  configuration  file  specified  via the
       tls_config_file parameter.  When empty, or when the selected name is not  present  in  the  configuration
       file, the default application name ("openssl_conf") is used as a fallback.

       This feature is available in Postfix &gt;= 3.9.

</pre><h4><b>tls_daemon_random_bytes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>32)</b></h4><pre>
       The  number of pseudo-random bytes that an <b><a href="../man8/smtp.8.html">smtp</a></b>(8) or <b><a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html">smtpd</a></b>(8) process requests from the <b><a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html">tlsmgr</a></b>(8) server
       in order to seed its internal pseudo random number generator (PRNG).  The default of 32 bytes (equivalent
       to 256 bits) is sufficient to generate a 128bit (or 168bit) session key.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_dane_digest_agility</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>on)</b></h4><pre>
       Configure RFC7671 DANE TLSA digest algorithm agility.  Do not change this setting from its default value.

       See Section 8 of RFC7671 for correct key rotation procedures.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.11 through 3.1.  Postfix 3.2 and later ignore  this  configuration
       parameter and behave as though it were set to "on".

</pre><h4><b>tls_dane_digests</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>sha512</b> <b>sha256)</b></h4><pre>
       DANE  TLSA (RFC 6698, RFC 7671, RFC 7672) resource-record "matching type" digest algorithms in descending
       preference order.  All the specified algorithms must be supported  by  the  underlying  OpenSSL  library,
       otherwise the Postfix SMTP client will not support DANE TLSA security.

       Specify  a  list of digest names separated by commas and/or whitespace.  Each digest name may be followed
       by an optional "=&lt;number&gt;" suffix.  For example, "sha512" may instead  be  specified  as  "sha512=2"  and
       "sha256"   may   instead   be   specified   as  "sha256=1".   The  optional  number  must  match  the  &lt;a
       href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/dane-parameters/dane-parameters.xhtml#matching-types"        &gt;IANA
       assigned TLSA matching type number the algorithm in question.  Postfix will check this constraint for the
       algorithms  it  knows  about.  Additional matching type algorithms registered with IANA can be added with
       explicit numbers provided they are supported by OpenSSL.

       Invalid list elements are logged with a warning and disable DANE support.  TLSA RRs that specify  digests
       not included in the list are ignored with a warning.

       Note:  It  is unwise to omit sha256 from the digest list.  This digest algorithm is the only mandatory to
       implement digest algorithm in RFC 6698, and many servers are expected to publish TLSA records  with  just
       sha256  digests.   Unless one of the standard digests is seriously compromised and servers have had ample
       time to update their TLSA records you should not omit any standard digests, just arrange  them  in  order
       from strongest to weakest.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.11 and later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_dane_trust_anchor_digest_enable</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable  support  for  RFC  6698  (DANE  TLSA)  DNS  records  that  contain  digests of trust-anchors with
       certificate usage "2".  Do not change this setting from its default value.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.11 through  3.1.   It  has  been  withdrawn  in  Postfix  3.2,  as
       trust-anchor  TLSA  records  are  now widely used and have proved sufficiently reliable.  Postfix 3.2 and
       later ignore this configuration parameter and behaves as though it were set to "yes".

</pre><h4><b>tls_disable_workarounds</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       List or bit-mask of OpenSSL bug work-arounds to disable.

       The OpenSSL toolkit includes a set of work-arounds for buggy SSL/TLS implementations. Applications,  such
       as  Postfix,  that  want  to  maximize interoperability ask the OpenSSL library to enable the full set of
       recommended work-arounds.

       From time to time, it is discovered that a work-around creates a security issue, and should no longer  be
       used. If upgrading OpenSSL to a fixed version is not an option or an upgrade is not available in a timely
       manner,  or  in  closed  environments  where  no buggy clients or servers exist, it may be appropriate to
       disable some or all of the OpenSSL interoperability work-arounds.  This  parameter  specifies  which  bug
       work-arounds to disable.

       If  the  value  of  the  parameter is a hexadecimal long integer starting with "0x", the bug work-arounds
       corresponding to the bits specified in its value are removed from  the  <b>SSL_OP_ALL</b>  work-around  bit-mask
       (see openssl/ssl.h and <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_options.3.html">SSL_CTX_set_options</a></b>(3)). You can specify more bits than are present in SSL_OP_ALL,
       excess  bits  are  ignored.  Specifying  0xFFFFFFFF disables all bug-workarounds on a 32-bit system. This
       should also be sufficient on 64-bit systems, until OpenSSL abandons support for 32-bit systems and starts
       using the high 32 bits of a 64-bit bug-workaround mask.

       Otherwise, the parameter is a white-space or comma separated list  of  specific  named  bug  work-arounds
       chosen  from the list below. It is possible that your OpenSSL version includes new bug work-arounds added
       after your Postfix source code was last updated, in that case you can only disable one of these  via  the
       hexadecimal syntax above.

</pre><h4><b>tls_eecdh_auto_curves</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The prioritized list of elliptic curves, that should be enabled in the Postfix SMTP  client  and  server.
       The  selected  curves  should be implemented by OpenSSL and be standardized for use in the TLS "supported
       groups" extension (RFC8422, RFC8446 and RFC8447).  Be sure to include at least "x25519" and  "prime256v1"
       (the OpenSSL name for "secp256r1", a.k.a. "P-256").  The default list is suitable for most users.

       On  the  client  side,  the  first  curve  listed  will be used to construct the client's initial TLS 1.3
       "keyshare".  If this is not supported by  the  server,  the  TLS  handshake  may  require  an  additional
       round-trip  after  the  server  issues a HelloRetryRequest (HRR) indicating a suitable mutually supported
       curve.

       Postfix skips curve names that are unknown to OpenSSL, or that are known but not yet  implemented.   This
       makes  it  possible to "anticipate" support for curves that should be used once they become available, or
       to deploy the same setting on a server "farm" where not all servers support the same curves.

       As of Postfix 3.10, when compiled with OpenSSL 3.0 or later, the "curve" names can be  more  general  key
       encapsulation  mechanisms  (KEMs),  and/or  may  be  loaded  from  an external "provider" (via a suitable
       tls_config_file).

       See also the "tls_ffdhe_auto_groups" parameter, which supports  customizing  the  list  of  FFDHE  groups
       enabled  with  TLS  1.3.   That setting is introduced with Postfix 3.8, when built against OpenSSL 3.0 or
       later.

       Post-quantum cryptography support: OpenSSL 3.5 introduces new configuration syntax that Postfix will  not
       attempt  to  imitate.   Instead,  with  Postfix  3.6.17,  3.7.13,  3.8.8,  3.9.2,  and  later,  set  both
       tls_eecdh_auto_curves and if available tls_ffdhe_auto_groups to the  empty  value,  to  enable  algorithm
       selection through OpenSSL configuration. See tls_config_file for a configuration example.

       This  feature is available in Postfix 3.2 and later, when it is compiled and linked with OpenSSL 1.0.2 or
       later on platforms where EC algorithms have not been disabled by the vendor.

</pre><h4><b>tls_eecdh_strong_curve</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>prime256v1)</b></h4><pre>
       The elliptic curve used by the Postfix SMTP server for sensibly strong ephemeral ECDH key exchange.  This
       curve  is  used  by  the  Postfix SMTP server when "smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade = strong". The phrase "sensibly
       strong" means approximately 128-bit security based on best known attacks.  The  selected  curve  must  be
       implemented  by  OpenSSL  (as  reported  by  <b><a href="../man1/ecparam.1.html">ecparam</a></b>(1) with the "-list_curves" option) and be one of the
       curves listed in Section 5.1.1 of RFC 8422. You should not generally change this  setting.   Remote  SMTP
       client  implementations  must  support  this curve for EECDH key exchange to take place.  It is unwise to
       choose only "bleeding-edge" curves supported by only a small subset of clients.

       This feature is not used as of Postfix 3.6. Do not specify.

       The default "strong" curve is rated in NSA Suite B for information classified up to SECRET.

       Note: elliptic curve names are poorly standardized; different standards groups  are  assigning  different
       names  to the same underlying curves.  The curve with the X9.62 name "prime256v1" is also known under the
       SECG name "secp256r1", but OpenSSL does not recognize the latter name.

       If you want to take maximal advantage of ciphers that offer  forward  secrecy  see  the  Getting  started
       section of FORWARD_SECRECY_README.  The full document conveniently presents all information about Postfix
       "perfect"  forward secrecy support in one place: what forward secrecy is, how to tweak settings, and what
       you can expect to see when Postfix uses ciphers with forward secrecy.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later, when it is compiled and linked with OpenSSL 1.0.0  or
       later on platforms where EC algorithms have not been disabled by the vendor.

</pre><h4><b>tls_eecdh_ultra_curve</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>secp384r1)</b></h4><pre>
       The elliptic curve used by the Postfix SMTP server for maximally strong ephemeral ECDH key exchange. This
       curve  is  used  by  the  Postfix SMTP server when "smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade = ultra". The phrase "maximally
       strong" means approximately 192-bit security based on best known attacks.  This additional strength comes
       at a significant computational cost, most users should instead set "smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade = strong".  The
       selected curve must be implemented by OpenSSL (as reported by <b><a href="../man1/ecparam.1.html">ecparam</a></b>(1) with the "-list_curves"  option)
       and  be  one  of  the  curves  listed  in Section 5.1.1 of RFC 8422. You should not generally change this
       setting.  Remote SMTP client implementations must support this curve  for  EECDH  key  exchange  to  take
       place.  It is unwise to choose only "bleeding-edge" curves supported by only a small subset of clients.

       This feature is not used as of Postfix 3.6. Do not specify.

       This default "ultra" curve is rated in NSA Suite B for information classified up to TOP SECRET.

       If  you  want  to  take  maximal  advantage of ciphers that offer forward secrecy see the Getting started
       section of FORWARD_SECRECY_README.  The full document conveniently presents all information about Postfix
       "perfect" forward secrecy support in one place: what forward secrecy is, how to tweak settings, and  what

       later on platforms where EC algorithms have not been disabled by the vendor.

</pre><h4><b>tls_export_cipherlist</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The OpenSSL cipherlist for "export" or higher grade ciphers.  Ignored as  of  Postfix  3.8.   In  earlier
       Postfix   releases   this   defined   the   meaning   of   the  "export"  setting  in  smtpd_tls_ciphers,
       smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers,   smtp_tls_ciphers,   smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers,   lmtp_tls_ciphers,    and
       lmtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers.  You are strongly encouraged not to change this setting.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_fast_shutdown_enable</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       A workaround for implementations that hang Postfix while shutting down a TLS session, until Postfix times
       out.  With  this  enabled,  Postfix  will  not  wait  for the remote TLS peer to respond to a TLS 'close'
       notification. This behavior is recommended for TLSv1.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_ffdhe_auto_groups</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The prioritized list of finite-field Diffie-Hellman ephemeral (FFDHE) key exchange  groups  supported  by
       the  Postfix  SMTP  client  and server.  OpenSSL 3.0 adds support for FFDHE key agreement in TLS 1.3.  In
       OpenSSL  1.1.1,  TLS  1.3  was  only  supported   with   elliptic-curve   based   key   agreement.    The
       "tls_ffdhe_auto_groups"  parameter  makes  it  possible  to  configure  the list of FFDHE groups that the
       Postfix client or server will enable in OpenSSL 3.0 and up.  This parameter has no effect when Postfix is
       built against earlier OpenSSL versions.

       The default list of FFDHE groups that Postfix enables in OpenSSL 3.0 and up includes just  the  2048  and
       3072-bit  groups.   Stronger  FFDHE  groups perform poorly and EC groups are a much better choice for the
       same security level.  Postfix ignores group names that are unknown to OpenSSL, or that are known but  not
       yet  implemented.   The  FFDHE  groups  are  largely  a backup, in case some peer does not support EC key
       exchange, or EC key exchange needs to be disabled for some pressing reason.

       Setting this parameter empty disables FFDHE support in TLS 1.3.  Whether FFDHE key agreement  is  enabled
       in TLS 1.2 and earlier depends on whether any of the "kDHE" ciphers are included in the cipherlist.

       Conversely,  setting  "tls_eecdh_auto_curves"  empty disables TLS 1.3 EC key agreement in OpenSSL 3.0 and
       later. If both are set empty, Postfix will fall back to OpenSSL preferences as described next.

       Post-quantum cryptography support: OpenSSL 3.5 introduces new configuration syntax that Postfix will  not
       attempt  to  imitate.   Instead,  with  Postfix  3.6.17,  3.7.13,  3.8.8,  3.9.2,  and  later,  set  both
       tls_eecdh_auto_curves and tls_ffdhe_auto_groups to the empty value, to enable algorithm selection through
       OpenSSL configuration.  See tls_config_file for a configuration example.

       All the default groups and EC curves should be sufficiently strong to make "pruning" the defaults unwise.
       At a minimum, "x25519" and "prime256v1" (the OpenSSL name for  "secp256r1",  a.k.a.  "P-256")  should  be
       among the enabled EC curves, while "dhe2048" and "dhe3072" should be among the FFDHE groups.

       This  feature  is  available in Postfix 3.8 and later, when it is compiled and linked with OpenSSL 3.0 or
       later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_high_cipherlist</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The OpenSSL cipherlist for "high" grade ciphers. This defines  the  meaning  of  the  "high"  setting  in
       smtpd_tls_ciphers,     smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers,     smtp_tls_ciphers,     smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers,
       lmtp_tls_ciphers, and lmtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers. You are strongly encouraged not to change this setting.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_legacy_public_key_fingerprints</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       A  temporary  migration  aid  for  sites  that  use  certificate  <u>public-key</u>  fingerprints  with  Postfix
       2.9.0..2.9.5,  which  use  an  incorrect  algorithm.  This  parameter  has  no  effect on the certificate
       fingerprint support that is available since Postfix 2.2.

       Specify "tls_legacy_public_key_fingerprints = yes" temporarily, pending a  migration  from  configuration
       files  with  incorrect  Postfix  2.9.0..2.9.5  certificate  public-key  finger  prints,  to  the  correct
       fingerprints  used  by  Postfix  2.9.6  and  later.   To  compute  the  correct  certificate   public-key
       fingerprints, see TLS_README.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.9.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_low_cipherlist</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The OpenSSL cipherlist for "low" or higher grade ciphers.  Ignored as of Postfix 3.8.  In earlier Postfix
       releases this defined the meaning of the "low" setting in smtpd_tls_ciphers, smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers,
       smtp_tls_ciphers,  smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers,  lmtp_tls_ciphers, and lmtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers. You are
       strongly encouraged not to change this setting.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_medium_cipherlist</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The OpenSSL cipherlist for "medium" or higher grade ciphers. This defines the  meaning  of  the  "medium"
       setting  in smtpd_tls_ciphers, smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers, smtp_tls_ciphers, smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers,
       lmtp_tls_ciphers, and lmtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers.  This is  the  default  cipherlist  for  mandatory  TLS
       encryption  in the TLS client (with anonymous ciphers disabled when verifying server certificates).  This
       is the default cipherlist for opportunistic TLS with Postfix releases after the middle of 2015.  You  are
       strongly encouraged not to change this setting.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_null_cipherlist</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>eNULL:!aNULL)</b></h4><pre>
       The  OpenSSL  cipherlist  for  "NULL"  grade ciphers that provide authentication without encryption. This
       defines the meaning of the "null" setting in smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers, smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers  and
       lmtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers.  You are strongly encouraged not to change this setting.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_preempt_cipherlist</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>no)</b></h4><pre>
       With  SSLv3  and  later,  use  the  Postfix  SMTP  server's cipher preference order instead of the remote
       client's cipher preference order.

       By default, the OpenSSL server selects the client's most preferred cipher that the server supports.  With
       SSLv3  and  later, the server may choose its own most preferred cipher that is supported (offered) by the
       client. Setting "tls_preempt_cipherlist = yes" enables server cipher preferences.

       While server cipher selection may in some cases lead to a more secure or performant cipher choice,  there
       is some risk of interoperability issues. In the past, some SSL clients have listed lower priority ciphers
       that  they  did  not implement correctly. If the server chooses a cipher that the client prefers less, it
       may select a cipher whose client implementation is flawed. Most notably Windows 2003  Microsoft  Exchange
       servers  have  flawed  implementations  of  DES-CBC3-SHA,  which OpenSSL considers stronger than RC4-SHA.
       Enabling server cipher-suite selection may create interoperability issues  with  Windows  2003  Microsoft
       Exchange clients.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.8 and later, in combination with OpenSSL 0.9.7 and later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_random_bytes</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>32)</b></h4><pre>
       The  number  of  bytes that <b><a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html">tlsmgr</a></b>(8) reads from $tls_random_source when (re)seeding the in-memory pseudo
       random number generator (PRNG) pool. The default of 32  bytes  (256  bits)  is  good  enough  for  128bit
       symmetric keys.  If using EGD or a device file, a maximum of 255 bytes is read.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_random_exchange_name</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       Name of the pseudo random number generator (PRNG) state file that is maintained by <b><a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html">tlsmgr</a></b>(8). The file is
       created when it does not exist, and its length is fixed at 1024 bytes.

       As  of  version  2.5, Postfix no longer uses root privileges when opening this file, and the default file
       location was changed from ${config_directory}/prng_exch to ${data_directory}/prng_exch.  As  a  migration
       aid,  an  attempt  to  open  the  file  under  a non-Postfix directory is redirected to the Postfix-owned
       data_directory, and a warning is logged.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_random_prng_update_period</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3600s)</b></h4><pre>
       The time between attempts by <b><a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html">tlsmgr</a></b>(8) to save the state of the pseudo random number generator (PRNG)  to
       the file specified with $tls_random_exchange_name.

       Specify  a  non-zero  time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix that specifies the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_random_reseed_period</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>3600s)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal time between attempts by <b><a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html">tlsmgr</a></b>(8) to re-seed the in-memory pseudo  random  number  generator
       (PRNG)  pool  from external sources.  The actual time between re-seeding attempts is calculated using the
       PRNG, and is between 0 and the time specified.

       Specify a non-zero time value (an integral value plus an optional one-letter suffix  that  specifies  the
       time unit).  Time units: s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours), d (days), w (weeks).  The default time unit
       is s (seconds).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_random_source</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       The  external  entropy  source for the in-memory <b><a href="../man8/tlsmgr.8.html">tlsmgr</a></b>(8) pseudo random number generator (PRNG) pool. Be
       sure to specify a non-blocking source.  If this source is not a regular file,  the  entropy  source  type
       must  be  prepended:   egd:/path/to/egd_socket  for  a  source  with  EGD compatible socket interface, or
       dev:/path/to/device for a device file.

       Note: on OpenBSD systems specify dev:/dev/arandom when dev:/dev/urandom gives timeout errors.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.2 and later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_required_enable</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Enable support for the "TLS-Required: no" message header, defined in RFC 8689. By adding this header to a
       message, a sender requests no enforcement of TLS policy. This limits the Postfix SMTP client TLS security
       level to "may", that is, do not verify remote SMTP server certificates, and fall back to plaintext if TLS
       is unavailable.  If a message contains a "TLS-Required: no" header, then Postfix will add that header  to
       a delivery status notification for that message.

       This feature is available in Postfix &gt;= 3.10.

</pre><h4><b>tls_server_sni_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  lookup  tables  that  map  names  received  from  remote  SMTP  clients via the TLS Server Name
       Indication (SNI) extension to the appropriate keys and certificate chains.  This parameter is implemented
       in the Postfix TLS library, and applies to both <b><a href="../man8/smtpd.8.html">smtpd</a></b>(8) and the SMTP server mode of <b><a href="../man8/tlsproxy.8.html">tlsproxy</a></b>(8).

       When this parameter is non-empty, the Postfix SMTP server enables SNI extension processing, and logs  SNI
       values  that  are invalid or don't match an entry in the specified tables.  When an entry does match, the
       SNI name is logged as part of the connection summary at log levels 1 and higher.

       The lookup key is either the verbatim SNI domain name or an ancestor domain prefixed with a leading  dot.
       For  internationalized  domains, the lookup key must be in IDNA 2008 A-label form (as required in the TLS
       SNI extension).

       The syntax of the lookup value is the same as with the  smtp_tls_chain_files  parameter  (see  there  for
       additional  details),  but  here  scoped to just TLS connections in which the client sends a matching SNI
       domain name.

       Example:

           /etc/postfix/main.cf:
               #
               # The indexed SNI table must be created with "postmap -F"
               #
               indexed = ${default_database_type}:${config_directory}/
               tls_server_sni_maps = ${indexed}sni

           /etc/postfix/sni:
               #
               # The example.com domain has both an RSA and ECDSA certificate
               # chain.  The chain files MUST start with the private key,
               # with the certificate chain next, starting with the leaf
               # (server) certificate, and then the issuer certificates.
               #
               example.com /etc/postfix/sni-chains/rsa2048.example.com.pem,
                           /etc/postfix/sni-chains/ecdsa-p256.example.com.pem
               #
               # The example.net domain has a wildcard certificate, and two
               # additional DNS names.  So its certificate chain is also used
               # with any subdomain, plus the additional names.
               #
               example.net /etc/postfix/sni-chains/example.net.pem
               .example.net /etc/postfix/sni-chains/example.net.pem
               example.info /etc/postfix/sni-chains/example.net.pem
               example.org /etc/postfix/sni-chains/example.net.pem

       Note that the SNI lookup tables should also have entries for the domains that correspond to  the  Postfix
       SMTP server's default certificate(s). This ensures that the remote SMTP client's TLS SNI extension gets a
       positive  response  when  it specifies one of the Postfix SMTP server's default domains, and ensures that
       the Postfix SMTP server will not log an SNI name mismatch for such a domain.  The Postfix  SMTP  server's
       default  certificates  are then only used when the client sends no SNI or when it sends SNI with a domain
       that the server knows no certificate(s) for.

       The mapping from an SNI domain name to a certificate chain is indirect.  In the input  source  files  for
       "cdb",  "hash",  "btree"  or other tables that are converted to on-disk indexed files via <b><a href="../man1/postmap.1.html">postmap</a></b>(1), the
       value specified for each key is a list of filenames.  When <b><a href="../man1/postmap.1.html">postmap</a></b>(1) is used with  the  <b>-F</b>  option,  the
       generated  table  stores  for  each lookup key the base64-encoded contents of the associated files.  When
       querying tables via <b>postmap</b> <b>-Fq</b>, the table value is decoded  from  base64,  yielding  the  original  file
       content, plus a new line.

       With  "regexp",  "pcre",  "inline",  "texthash",  "static"  and  similar  tables  that are interpreted at
       run-time, and don't have a separate source format, the table value is again a list files, that are loaded
       into memory when the table is opened.

       With tables whose content is managed outside of Postfix, such as LDAP, MySQL, PostgreSQL,  socketmap  and
       tcp,  the  value  must  be  a  concatenation of the desired PEM keys and certificate chains, that is then
       further encoded to yield a single-line base64 string.  Creation of such tables and  secure  storage  (the
       value includes private key material) are outside the responsibility of Postfix.

       With  "socketmap"  and  "tcp"  the  data  will  be transmitted in the clear, and there is no query access
       control, so these are generally unsuitable for storing  SNI  chains.   With  LDAP  and  SQL,  you  should
       restrict read access and use TLS to protect the sensitive data in transit.

       Typically  there  is  only  one  private  key  and  its  chain  of  certificates starting with the "leaf"
       certificate corresponding to that key,  and  continuing  with  the  appropriate  intermediate  issuer  CA
       certificates,  with  each  certificate  ideally  followed  by  its  issuer.   Servers  that have keys and
       certificates for more than one algorithm (e.g.  both an RSA key and an ECDSA key, or even RSA, ECDSA  and
       Ed25519)  can  use  multiple  chains  concatenated  together,  with  the  key  always  listed  before the
       corresponding certificates.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.4 and later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_session_ticket_cipher</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>Postfix</b> <b>&gt;=</b> <b>3.0:</b> <b>aes-256-cbc,</b> <b>Postfix</b> <b>&lt;</b> <b>3.0:</b> <b>aes-128-cbc)</b></h4><pre>
       Algorithm used to encrypt RFC5077 TLS session tickets.  This algorithm must use CBC mode, have a  128-bit
       block size, and must have a key length between 128 and 256 bits.  The default is aes-256-cbc.  Overriding
       the default to choose a different algorithm is discouraged.

       Setting  this parameter empty disables session ticket support in the Postfix SMTP server.  Another way to
       disable session ticket support is via the tls_ssl_options parameter.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_ssl_options</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       List or bit-mask of OpenSSL options to enable.

       The OpenSSL toolkit provides a set of options that applications can enable to tune the OpenSSL  behavior.
       Some  of  these  work  around  bugs  in  other  implementations  and  are on by default.  You can use the
       tls_disable_workarounds parameter to selectively disable some or all  of  the  bug  work-arounds,  making
       OpenSSL  more  strict  at  the  cost of non-interoperability with SSL clients or servers that exhibit the
       bugs.

       Other options are off by default, and typically enable or disable features rather than bug  work-arounds.
       These  may  be  turned  on  (with care) via the tls_ssl_options parameter.  The value is a white-space or
       comma separated list of named options chosen from the list below.  The names are not case-sensitive,  you
       can  use lower-case if you prefer.  The upper case values below match the corresponding macro name in the
       ssl.h header file with the SSL_OP_ prefix removed.  It is possible that your OpenSSL version includes new
       options added after your Postfix source code was last updated, in that case you can only  enable  one  of
       these via the hexadecimal syntax below.

       You should only enable features via the hexadecimal mask when the need to control the feature is critical
       (to  deal  with  a  new  vulnerability  or a serious interoperability problem).  Postfix DOES NOT promise
       backwards compatible behavior with respect to the mask bits.  A feature  enabled  via  the  mask  in  one
       release  may  be  enabled  by  other  means  in  a  later release, and the mask bit will then be ignored.
       Therefore, use of the hexadecimal mask is only a temporary measure until a new Postfix or OpenSSL release
       provides a better solution.

       If the value of the parameter is a hexadecimal long integer starting with "0x", the options corresponding
       to the bits specified in its value are enabled (see openssl/ssl.h and <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_options.3.html">SSL_CTX_set_options</a></b>(3)).   You  can
       only  enable  options  not already controlled by other Postfix settings.  For example, you cannot disable
       protocols or enable server cipher preference.  Do not  attempt  to  enable  all  features  by  specifying
       0xFFFFFFFF, this is unlikely to be a good idea.  Some bug work-arounds are also valid here, allowing them
       to be re-enabled if/when they're no longer enabled by default.  The supported values include:

       <b>ENABLE_MIDDLEBOX_COMPAT</b>
              Postfix &gt;= 3.4. See <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_options.3.html">SSL_CTX_set_options</a></b>(3).

       <b>LEGACY_SERVER_CONNECT</b>
              See <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_options.3.html">SSL_CTX_set_options</a></b>(3).

       <b>NO_TICKET</b>
              Enabled  by default when needed in fully-patched Postfix &gt;= 2.7.  Not needed at all for Postfix &gt;=
              2.11, unless for some reason you do not want to support TLS  session  resumption.   Best  not  set
              explicitly.  See <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_options.3.html">SSL_CTX_set_options</a></b>(3).

       <b>NO_COMPRESSION</b>
              Disable  SSL  compression even if supported by the OpenSSL library.  Compression is CPU-intensive,
              and compression before encryption does not always improve security.

       <b>NO_RENEGOTIATION</b>
              Postfix &gt;= 3.4.  This can reduce  opportunities  for  a  potential  CPU  exhaustion  attack.   See
              <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_options.3.html">SSL_CTX_set_options</a></b>(3).

       <b>NO_SESSION_RESUMPTION_ON_RENEGOTIATION</b>
              Postfix &gt;= 3.4. See <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_options.3.html">SSL_CTX_set_options</a></b>(3).

       <b>PRIORITIZE_CHACHA</b>
              Postfix &gt;= 3.4. See <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CTX_set_options.3.html">SSL_CTX_set_options</a></b>(3).

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.11 and later.

</pre><h4><b>tls_wildcard_matches_multiple_labels</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>yes)</b></h4><pre>
       Match multiple DNS labels with "*" in wildcard certificates.

       Some  mail  service  providers  prepend  the  customer domain name to a base domain for which they have a
       wildcard TLS certificate.  For example, the MX records for example.com hosted by example.net may be:

           example.com. IN MX 0 example.com.mx1.example.net.
           example.com. IN MX 0 example.com.mx2.example.net.

       and the TLS certificate may be for "*.example.net". The "*" then corresponds with multiple labels in  the
       mail  server  domain  name.  While multi-label wildcards are not widely supported, and are not blessed by
       any standard, there is little to be gained by disallowing their use in this context.

       Notes:

       •      In a certificate name, the "*" is special only when it is used as the first label.

       •      While  Postfix  (2.11  or  later)  can  match  "*"  with  multiple  domain  name   labels,   other
              implementations likely will not.

       •      Earlier Postfix implementations behave as if "tls_wildcard_matches_multiple_labels = no".

       reject_unknown_sender_domain and reject_unknown_recipient_domain.

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 5321.

</pre><h4><b>unknown_address_tempfail_action</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$reject_tempfail_action)</b></h4><pre>
       The Postfix SMTP server's action  when  reject_unknown_sender_domain  or  reject_unknown_recipient_domain
       fail  due  to  a  temporary  error  condition.  Specify  "defer"  to defer the remote SMTP client request
       immediately. With the default "defer_if_permit" action, the Postfix SMTP server  continues  to  look  for
       opportunities to reject mail, and defers the client request only if it would otherwise be accepted.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.6 and later.

</pre><h4><b>unknown_client_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>450)</b></h4><pre>
       The  numerical  Postfix SMTP server response code when a client without valid address &lt;=&gt; name mapping is

       Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 5321.

</pre><h4><b>unknown_local_recipient_reject_code</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>550)</b></h4><pre>
       The   numerical   Postfix   SMTP   server   response   code  when  a  recipient  address  is  local,  and
       $local_recipient_maps specifies a list of lookup tables that does not match the recipient.   A  recipient
       address is local when its domain matches $mydestination, $proxy_interfaces or $inet_interfaces.

       The  default  setting  is 550 (reject mail) but it is safer to initially use 450 (try again later) so you
       have time to find out if your local_recipient_maps settings are OK.

       Example:

</pre><h4><b>use_srv_lookup</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Enables discovery for the specified service(s) using DNS SRV records. For example, with "use_srv_lookup =
       submission"  and  "relayhost  =  example.com:submission",  the  Postfix  SMTP client will look up DNS SRV
       records for _submission._tcp.example.com, and will relay email through  the  hosts  and  ports  that  are
       specified with those records. See RFC 2782 for details of the host selection process.

       Specify  zero  or  more  service  names separated by comma and/or whitespace. Any name in the <b><a href="../man5/services.5.html">services</a></b>(5)
       database may be specified, though in practice only submission or submissions (formerly called smtp)  make
       sense.

       When  SRV record lookup is enabled with use_srv_lookup, you can enclose a domain name in "[]" to force IP
       address lookup instead of SRV record lookup.

       Example 1: MUA-to-MTA submission using  SRV  record  lookup  for  the  "submission"  service  for  domain
       "example.com".  This  uses  the  default  SMTP delivery agent with STARTTLS, and looks up SRV records for
       "_submission._tcp.example.com".

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           use_srv_lookup = submission
           relayhost = example.com:submission
           smtp_tls_security_level = may
           ...see SASL_README for sasl configuration...

       Example 2: MUA-to-MTA submission using SRV  record  lookup  for  the  "submissions"  service  for  domain
       "example.org".  This  uses a dedicated SMTP delivery agent (smtp-wraptls) with tls_wrappermode turned on,
       and looks up SRV records for "_submissions._tcp.example.org".

       Note: specify the older name "smtps" instead of "submissions" when a provider has DNS  SRV  records  like
       "_smtps._tcp.example.org" instead of "_submissions._tcp.example.org".

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           use_srv_lookup = submissions
           default_transport = smtp-wraptls:example.org:submissions
           ...see SASL_README for sasl configuration...

       /etc/postfix/master.cf:
           smtp-wraptls   unix   ...   ...   ...   ...   ...   smtp
               -o { smtp_tls_wrappermode = yes }
               -o { smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt }

       Example  3: Sender-dependent selection for a combination of MUA-to-MTA submission services. This combines
       examples  1  and  2  with  examples  of  how  to  disable  SRV  and  look  up  IP  address  records   for
       "smtp-relay.example.net"  and  "smtp-relay.other.example".  Again, specify the older name "smtps" instead
       of "submissions"  when  a  provider  has  DNS  SRV  records  like  "_smtps._tcp.example.org"  instead  of
       "_submissions._tcp.example.org".

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           use_srv_lookup = submission, submissions
           sender_dependent_default_transport_maps = inline:{
               # Destinations that support SRV record lookup.
               { <a href="mailto:user1@example.com">user1@example.com</a> = smtp:example.com:submission }
               { <a href="mailto:user2@example.org">user2@example.org</a> = smtp-wraptls:example.org:submissions }
               # Use [destination] to force IP address lookups.
               { <a href="mailto:user3@example.net">user3@example.net</a> = smtp:[smtp-relay.example.net]:submission }
               { <a href="mailto:user4@other.example">user4@other.example</a> =
                     smtp-wraptls:[smtp-relay.other.example]:submissions } }
           ...see SASL_README for sasl configuration...

       Example  4:  MTA-to-MTA traffic, using SRV record lookup for the SMTP service. This is useful for Postfix
       tests, and may be useful in environments where ports are dynamically assigned to servers.

       /etc/postfix/main.cf:
           use_srv_lookup = smtp
           # Fall back to MX record lookup when SRV records are unavailable.
           #allow_srv_lookup_fallback = yes
           #ignore_srv_lookup_error = yes

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.8 and later.

</pre><h4><b>verp_delimiter_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>-=+)</b></h4><pre>
       The characters Postfix accepts as VERP delimiter characters on the Postfix <b><a href="../man1/sendmail.1.html">sendmail</a></b>(1) command  line  and
       in SMTP commands.

       This feature is available in Postfix 1.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>virtual_alias_address_length_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000)</b></h4><pre>
       The  maximal length of an email address after virtual alias expansion.  This stops virtual aliasing loops
       that increase the address length exponentially.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>virtual_alias_domains</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$virtual_alias_maps)</b></h4><pre>
       Postfix is the final destination for the specified list of virtual alias domains, that  is,  domains  for
       which  all addresses are aliased to addresses in other local or remote domains. The SMTP server validates
       recipient addresses with $virtual_alias_maps and rejects non-existent recipients. See  also  the  virtual
       alias domain class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file

       This  feature  is  available  in  Postfix  2.0  and later. The default value is backwards compatible with
       Postfix version 1.1.

       The default value is $virtual_alias_maps so that you can keep all information about virtual alias domains
       in one place.  If you have many users, it is better to separate information that changes more  frequently
       (virtual  address  -&gt; local or remote address mapping) from information that changes less frequently (the
       list of virtual domain names).

       Specify a list of host or domain names, "/file/name" or "type:table" patterns, separated by commas and/or
       whitespace. A "/file/name" pattern is replaced by its contents; a "type:table" lookup  table  is  matched
       when  a table entry matches a host or domain name (the lookup result is ignored).  Continue long lines by
       starting the next line with whitespace. Specify "!pattern" to exclude a host  or  domain  name  from  the
       list. The form "!/file/name" is supported only in Postfix version 2.4 and later.

       See also the VIRTUAL_README and ADDRESS_CLASS_README documents for further information.

       Example:

       virtual_alias_domains = virtual1.tld virtual2.tld

</pre><h4><b>virtual_alias_expansion_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal number of addresses that virtual alias expansion produces from each original recipient.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>virtual_alias_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$virtual_maps)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional  lookup  tables  that  are  often searched with a full email address (including domain) and that
       apply to all recipients: <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8), virtual, and remote; this is unlike alias_maps that are only  searched
       with  an  email  address  localpart  (no  domain)  and  that  apply  only  to  <b><a href="../man8/local.8.html">local</a></b>(8)  recipients.  The
       virtual_alias_maps table format and lookups are documented in <b><a href="../man5/virtual.5.html">virtual</a></b>(5).  For  an  overview  of  Postfix
       address manipulations see the ADDRESS_REWRITING_README document.

       This  feature  is  available  in  Postfix  2.0  and later. The default value is backwards compatible with
       Postfix version 1.1.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.  Note: these lookups are recursive.

       If you use this feature with indexed files, run "<b>postmap</b> <b>/etc/postfix/virtual</b>" after changing the file.

       Examples:

       virtual_alias_maps = dbm:/etc/postfix/virtual
       virtual_alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual

</pre><h4><b>virtual_alias_recursion_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>1000)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal nesting depth of virtual alias expansion.  Currently the recursion limit is applied  only  to
       the  left  branch of the expansion graph, so the depth of the tree can in the worst case reach the sum of
       the expansion and recursion limits.  This may change in the future.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.1 and later.

</pre><h4><b>virtual_delivery_status_filter</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_delivery_status_filter)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional filter for the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery agent to change the delivery status code or explanatory  text
       of successful or unsuccessful deliveries.  See default_delivery_status_filter for details.

       This feature is available in Postfix 3.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>virtual_destination_concurrency_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_destination_concurrency_limit)</b></h4><pre>
       The  maximal  number  of  parallel  deliveries  to  the same destination via the virtual message delivery
       transport. This limit is enforced by the queue manager. The message delivery transport name is the  first
       field in the entry in the master.cf file.

</pre><h4><b>virtual_destination_recipient_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$default_destination_recipient_limit)</b></h4><pre>
       The  maximal  number  of recipients per message for the virtual message delivery transport. This limit is
       enforced by the queue manager. The message delivery transport name is the first field in the entry in the
       master.cf file.

       Setting this parameter to a value of 1 changes the meaning of virtual_destination_concurrency_limit  from
       concurrency per domain into concurrency per recipient.

</pre><h4><b>virtual_gid_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Lookup tables with the per-recipient group ID for <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) mailbox delivery.

       This  parameter  is  specific to the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery agent.  It does not apply when mail is delivered
       with a different mail delivery program.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.

       In a lookup table, specify a left-hand side of "@domain.tld" to match any user in  the  specified  domain
       that does not have a specific "<a href="mailto:user@domain.tld">user@domain.tld</a>" entry.

       When a recipient address has an optional address extension (user+<a href="mailto:foo@domain.tld">foo@domain.tld</a>), the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery
       agent  looks  up  the  full  address first, and when the lookup fails, it looks up the unextended address
       (<a href="mailto:user@domain.tld">user@domain.tld</a>).

       Note 1: for security reasons, the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery agent disallows regular expression substitution  of
       $1 etc. in regular expression lookup tables, because that would open a security hole.

       Note  2:  for  security  reasons,  the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery agent will silently ignore requests to use the
       <b><a href="../man8/proxymap.8.html">proxymap</a></b>(8) server. Instead it will open the table directly. Before Postfix version 2.2,  the  <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8)
       delivery agent will terminate with a fatal error.

</pre><h4><b>virtual_mailbox_base</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       A  prefix  that the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery agent prepends to all pathname results from $virtual_mailbox_maps
       table lookups.  This is a safety measure to ensure that an out of control map  doesn't  litter  the  file
       system with mailboxes.  While virtual_mailbox_base could be set to "/", this setting isn't recommended.

       This  parameter  is  specific to the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery agent.  It does not apply when mail is delivered
       with a different mail delivery program.

       Example:

       virtual_mailbox_base = <a href="file:/var/mail">/var/mail</a>

</pre><h4><b>virtual_mailbox_domains</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>$virtual_mailbox_maps)</b></h4><pre>
       Postfix is the final  destination  for  the  specified  list  of  domains;  mail  is  delivered  via  the
       $virtual_transport  mail  delivery  transport.  By default this is the Postfix <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery agent.
       The  SMTP  server  validates  recipient  addresses  with  $virtual_mailbox_maps  and  rejects  mail   for
       non-existent recipients.  See also the virtual mailbox domain class in the ADDRESS_CLASS_README file.

       This parameter expects the same syntax as the mydestination configuration parameter.

       This  feature  is  available  in  Postfix  2.0  and later. The default value is backwards compatible with
       Postfix version 1.1.

</pre><h4><b>virtual_mailbox_limit</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>51200000)</b></h4><pre>
       The maximal size in bytes of an individual <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) mailbox or maildir file, or zero (no limit).

       This parameter is specific to the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery agent.  It does not apply when  mail  is  delivered
       with a different mail delivery program.

</pre><h4><b>virtual_mailbox_lock</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>see</b> <b>postconf</b> <b>-d</b> <b>output)</b></h4><pre>
       How  to  lock  a  UNIX-style <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) mailbox before attempting delivery.  For a list of available file
       locking methods, use the "<b>postconf</b> <b>-l</b>" command.

       This parameter is specific to the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery agent.  It does not apply when  mail  is  delivered
       with a different mail delivery program.

       This  setting  is  ignored  with  <b>maildir</b>  style  delivery,  because  such  deliveries  are  safe without
       application-level locks.

       Note 1: the <b>dotlock</b> method requires that the recipient  UID  or  GID  has  write  access  to  the  parent
       directory of the recipient's mailbox file.

       Note 2: the default setting of this parameter is system dependent.

</pre><h4><b>virtual_mailbox_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional lookup tables with all valid addresses in the domains that match $virtual_mailbox_domains.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.

       In  a  lookup  table, specify a left-hand side of "@domain.tld" to match any user in the specified domain
       that does not have a specific "<a href="mailto:user@domain.tld">user@domain.tld</a>" entry.

       With the default "virtual_mailbox_domains = $virtual_mailbox_maps", lookup tables also need entries  with
       a  left-hand  side  of  "domain.tld"  to  satisfy  virtual_mailbox_domain lookups (the right-hand side is
       required but will not be used).

       The remainder of this text is specific to the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery agent.  It does not apply when mail  is
       delivered with a different mail delivery program.

       The  <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8)  delivery agent uses this table to look up the per-recipient mailbox or maildir pathname.
       If the lookup result ends in a slash ("/"), maildir-style delivery is carried out, otherwise the path  is
       assumed  to  specify  a  UNIX-style  mailbox  file.   Note  that $virtual_mailbox_base is unconditionally
       prepended to this path.

       When a recipient address has an optional address extension (user+<a href="mailto:foo@domain.tld">foo@domain.tld</a>), the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery
       agent looks up the full address first, and when the lookup fails, it  looks  up  the  unextended  address
       (<a href="mailto:user@domain.tld">user@domain.tld</a>).

       Note  1: for security reasons, the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery agent disallows regular expression substitution of
       $1 etc. in regular expression lookup tables, because that would open a security hole.

       Note 2: for security reasons, the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery agent will silently  ignore  requests  to  use  the
       <b><a href="../man8/proxymap.8.html">proxymap</a></b>(8)  server.  Instead it will open the table directly. Before Postfix version 2.2, the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8)
       delivery agent will terminate with a fatal error.

</pre><h4><b>virtual_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Optional lookup tables with a) names of domains for which all addresses are aliased to addresses in other
       local or remote domains, and b) addresses that are aliased to addresses in other local or remote domains.
       Available before Postfix version 2.0. With Postfix version 2.0 and later, this is  replaced  by  separate
       controls: virtual_alias_domains and virtual_alias_maps.

</pre><h4><b>virtual_minimum_uid</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>100)</b></h4><pre>
       The  minimum  user ID value that the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery agent accepts as a result from $virtual_uid_maps
       table lookup.  Returned values less than this will be rejected, and the message will be deferred.

       This parameter is specific to the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery agent.  It does not apply when  mail  is  delivered
       with a different mail delivery program.

</pre><h4><b>virtual_transport</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>virtual)</b></h4><pre>
       The  default  mail  delivery transport and next-hop destination for final delivery to domains listed with
       $virtual_mailbox_domains.  This information can be overruled with the <b><a href="../man5/transport.5.html">transport</a></b>(5) table.

       Specify a string of the form <u>transport:nexthop</u>, where <u>transport</u> is the name of a mail delivery  transport
       defined  in master.cf.  The <u>:nexthop</u> destination is optional; its syntax is documented in the manual page
       of the corresponding delivery agent.

       This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.

</pre><h4><b>virtual_uid_maps</b> <b>(default:</b> <b>empty)</b></h4><pre>
       Lookup tables with the per-recipient user ID that the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery agent uses while writing to the
       recipient's mailbox.

       This parameter is specific to the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery agent.  It does not apply when  mail  is  delivered
       with a different mail delivery program.

       Specify zero or more "type:name" lookup tables, separated by whitespace or comma. Tables will be searched
       in the specified order until a match is found.

       In  a  lookup  table, specify a left-hand side of "@domain.tld" to match any user in the specified domain
       that does not have a specific "<a href="mailto:user@domain.tld">user@domain.tld</a>" entry.

       When a recipient address has an optional address extension (user+<a href="mailto:foo@domain.tld">foo@domain.tld</a>), the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery
       agent looks up the full address first, and when the lookup fails, it  looks  up  the  unextended  address
       (<a href="mailto:user@domain.tld">user@domain.tld</a>).

       Note  1: for security reasons, the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery agent disallows regular expression substitution of
       $1 etc. in regular expression lookup tables, because that would open a security hole.

       Note 2: for security reasons, the <b><a href="../man8/virtual.8.html">virtual</a></b>(8) delivery agent will silently  ignore  requests  to  use  the
