       deb-substvars - Debian source substitution variables

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>debian/substvars</b>, <b>debian/</b><u>binary-package</u><b>.substvars</b>, variables

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Before <b>dpkg-source</b>, <b>dpkg-gencontrol</b> and <b>dpkg-genchanges</b> write their control information (to the source
       control file <b>.dsc</b> for <b>dpkg-source</b> and to standard output for <b>dpkg-gencontrol</b> and <b>dpkg-genchanges</b>) they
       perform some variable substitutions on the output file.

   <b>Variable</b> <b>Syntax</b>
       A variable substitution has the form <b>${</b><u>variable-name</u><b>}</b>.  Variable names consist of alphanumerics
       (a-zA-Z0-9), hyphens (-) and colons (:) and start with an alphanumeric, and are case-sensitive, even
       though they might refer to other entities which are case-preserving.  Variable substitutions are
       performed repeatedly until none are left; the full text of the field after the substitution is rescanned
       to look for more substitutions.

   <b>File</b> <b>Syntax</b>
       Substitution variables can be specified in a file.  These files consist of lines of the form <u>name</u><b>=</b><u>value</u>,
       <u>name</u><b>?=</b><u>value</u>, or <u>name</u><b>!=</b><u>value</u>.  The <b>=</b> operator assigns a normal substitution variable, the <b>?=</b> operator
       (since dpkg 1.21.8) assigns an optional substitution variable which will emit no warnings even if unused,
       and the <b>!=</b> operator (since dpkg 1.22.7) assigns a required substitution variable which will error out if
       unused.  Trailing whitespace on each line, blank lines, and lines starting with a <b>#</b> symbol (comments) are
       ignored.

   <b>Substitution</b>
       Variables can be set using the <b>-V</b> common option.  They can be also specified in the file <b>debian/substvars</b>
       (or whatever other file is specified using the <b>-T</b> common option).

       After all the substitutions have been done each occurrence of the string <b>${}</b> (which is not an actual
       substitution variable) is replaced with a <b>$</b> sign.  This can be used as an escape sequence such as
       <b>${}{</b><u>VARIABLE</u><b>}</b> which will end up as <b>${</b><u>VARIABLE</u><b>}</b> on the output.

       If a variable is referred to but not defined it generates a warning and an empty value is assumed.

       While variable substitution is done on all control fields, some of those fields are used and needed
       during the build when the substitution did not yet occur.  That's why you can't use variables in the
       <b>Package</b>, <b>Source</b> and <b>Architecture</b> fields.

       Variable substitution happens on the content of the fields after they have been parsed, thus if you want
       a variable to expand over multiple lines you do not have to include a space after the newline.  This is
       done implicitly when the field is output.  For example, if the variable <b>${Description}</b> is set to "foo is
       bar.${Newline}foo is great." and if you have the following field:

        Description: foo application
         ${Description}
         .
         More text.

       It will result in:

        Description: foo application
         foo is bar.
         foo is great.
         .
         More text.

   <b>Built-in</b> <b>Variable</b>
       Additionally, the following standard variables are always available:

       <b>Arch</b>
           The  current  host architecture (i.e. the architecture the package is being built for, the equivalent
           of <b>DEB_HOST_ARCH</b>).

       <b>vendor:Name</b>
           The current vendor name (since dpkg 1.20.0).  This value comes from the <b>Vendor</b> field for the  current
           vendor's origin file, as <b><a href="../man1/dpkg-vendor.1.html">dpkg-vendor</a></b>(1) would retrieve it.

       <b>vendor:Id</b>
           The current vendor ID (since dpkg 1.20.0).  This is just the lowercase variant of <b>vendor:Name</b>.

       <b>source:Version</b>
           The source package version (since dpkg 1.13.19).

       <b>source:Upstream-Version</b>
           The upstream source package version, including the Debian version epoch if any (since dpkg 1.13.19).

       <b>binary:Version</b>
           The  binary package version (which may differ from <b>source:Version</b> in a binNMU for example; since dpkg
           1.13.19).

       <b>Source-Version</b>
           The source package version (from the changelog file).  This variable is now  <b>obsolete</b>  and  emits  an
           error  when  used  as  its  meaning  is different from its function, please use the <b>source:Version</b> or
           <b>binary:Version</b> as appropriate.

       <b>source:Synopsis</b>
           The source package synopsis, extracted from the source stanza <b>Description</b> field, if it exists  (since
           dpkg 1.19.0).

       <b>source:Extended-Description</b>
           The  source  package  extended description, extracted from the source stanza <b>Description</b> field, if it
           exists (since dpkg 1.19.0).

       <b>Installed-Size</b>
           The approximate total size of  the  package's  installed  files.   This  value  is  copied  into  the
           corresponding  control  file field; setting it will modify the value of that field.  If this variable
           is not set <b>dpkg-gencontrol</b> will compute the default value by accumulating the size  of  each  regular
           file and symlink rounded to 1 KiB used units, and a baseline of 1 KiB for any other filesystem object
           type.  With hardlinks only being counted once as a regular file.

           <b>Note</b>:  Take  into account that this can only ever be an approximation, as the actual size used on the
           installed system will depend greatly on the filesystem used and its parameters, which  might  end  up
           using either more or less space than the specified in this field.

       <b>Extra-Size</b>
           Additional disk space used when the package is installed.  If this variable is set its value is added
           to  that of the <b>Installed-Size</b> variable (whether set explicitly or using the default value) before it
           is copied into the <b>Installed-Size</b> control file field.

       <b>S:</b><u>field-name</u>
           The value of the source stanza field <u>field-name</u> (which must be given in the canonical capitalization;
           since dpkg 1.18.11).  Setting these variables has no effect other  than  on  places  where  they  are
           expanded explicitly.  These variables are only available when generating binary control files.

       <b>F:</b><u>field-name</u>
           The  value  of  the  output  field  <u>field-name</u> (which must be given in the canonical capitalization).
           Setting these variables has no effect other than on places where they are expanded explicitly.

       <b>Format</b>
           The <b>.changes</b> file format version generated by this version of the source packaging scripts.   If  you
           set this variable the contents of the <b>Format</b> field in the <b>.changes</b> file will change too.

       <b>Newline</b>, <b>Space</b>, <b>Tab</b>
           These variables each hold the corresponding character.

       <b>shlibs:</b><u>dependencyfield</u>
           Variable settings with names of this form are generated by <b>dpkg-shlibdeps</b>.

       <b>dpkg:Upstream-Version</b>
           The upstream version of dpkg (since dpkg 1.13.19).

       <b>dpkg:Version</b>
           The full version of dpkg (since dpkg 1.13.19).
