</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       fpc.cfg - Free Pascal Compiler (FPC) configuration file, name derived from Free Pascal Compiler.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This is the main configuration file of the <u>Free</u> <u>Pascal</u> <u>Compiler</u> <u>(FPC)</u>

       All commandline options of the compiler (described in <b><a href="../man1/fpc.1.html">fpc</a></b>(1) ) can be specified in fpc.cfg

       When  the  configuration  file is found, it is read, and the lines it contains are treated like you typed
       them on the command line see <b><a href="../man1/fpc.1.html">fpc</a></b>(1) with some extra condtional possibilities.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       You can specify comments in the configuration file with the # sign.  Everything from the  #  on  will  be
       ignored, unless it is one of the keywords (see below).

       The compiler looks for the fpc.cfg file in the following places :

            <u>-</u> <u>Under</u> <u>Linux</u> <u>and</u> <u>unix</u>
                 - The current directory.
                 - Home directory, looks for .fpc.cfg
                 - The directory specified in the environment
                      variable PPC_CONFIG_PATH, and if it's not
                      set under compilerdir/../etc.
                 - If it is not yet found: in /etc.

            <u>-</u> <u>Under</u> <u>all</u> <u>other</u> <u>OSes:</u>
                 - The current directory.
                 - The directory specified in the environment
                      variable  PPC_CONFIG_PATH.
                 - The directory where the compiler binary is.

       When  the  compiler  has  finished reading the configuration file, it continues to treat the command line
       options.

       One of the command-line options allows you to specify a second configuration file: Specifying @foo on the
       command line will use file foo instead of fpc.cfg and read further options from there. When the  compiler
       has finished reading this file, it continues to process the command line.

       The  configuration file allows some kind of preprocessing. It understands the following directives, which
       you should place on the first column of a line :

            #IFDEF
            #IFNDEF
            #ELSE
            #ENDIF
            #DEFINE
            #UNDEF
            #WRITE
            #INCLUDE
            #SECTION
       They work the same way as their $...  directive counterparts in Pascal:

       <u>#IFDEF</u>

              <u>Syntax</u> #IFDEF name

                     Lines following #IFDEF are skipped read if the keyword "name" following it is not defined.

                     They are read until the keywords #ELSE  or  #ENDIF  are  encountered,  after  which  normal
                     processing is resumed.

              <u>Example</u>
                     #IFDEF VER0_99_12
                     -Fu/usr/lib/fpc/0.99.12/rtl
                     #ENDIF

              In  the above example, /usr/lib/fpc/0.99.12/rtl will be added to the path if you're compiling with
              version 0.99.12 of the compiler.

       <u>#IFNDEF</u>

              <u>Syntax</u> #IFNDEF name

                     Lines following #IFDEF are skipped read if the keyword "name" following it is defined.

                     They are read until the keywords #ELSE  or  #ENDIF  are  encountered,  after  which  normal
                     processing is resumed.

              <u>Example</u>
                     #IFNDEF VER0_99_12
                     -Fu/usr/lib/fpc/0.99.13/rtl
                     #ENDIF

              In  the  above example, /usr/lib/fpc/0.99.13/rtl will be added to the path if you're NOT compiling
              with version 0.99.12 of the compiler.

       <u>#ELSE</u>

              <u>Syntax</u> #ELSE

                     #ELSE can be specified after a #IFDEF  or  #IFNDEF  directive  as  an  alternative.   Lines
                     following #ELSE are skipped read if the preceding #IFDEF #IFNDEF was accepted.

                     They  are skipped until the keyword #ENDIF is encountered, after which normal processing is
                     resumed.

              <u>Example</u>

                     #IFDEF VER0_99_12
                     -Fu/usr/lib/fpc/0.99.12/rtl
                     #ELSE
                     -Fu/usr/lib/fpc/0.99.13/rtl
                     #ENDIF

              In the above example, /usr/lib/fpc/0.99.12/rtl will be added to the path if you're compiling  with
              version 0.99.12 of the compiler, otherwise /usr/lib/fpc/0.99.13/rtl will be added to the path.

       <u>#ENDIF</u>

              <u>Syntax</u> #ENDIF

              #ENDIF marks the end of a block that started with #IF(N)DEF, possibly with an #ELSE between it.

       <u>#DEFINE</u>

              <u>Syntax</u> #DEFINE name

              #DEFINE defines a new keyword. This has the same effect as a "-dname"  command-line option.

       <u>#UNDEF</u>

              <u>Syntax</u> #UNDEF name

                     #UNDEF un-defines a keyword if it existed.  This has the same effect as a "-uname" command-
                     line option.

       <u>#WRITE</u>

              <u>Syntax</u> #WRITE Message Text

                     #WRITE  writes  "Message  Text"  to  the screen.  This can be useful to display warnings if
                     certain options are set.

              <u>Example</u>
                     #IFDEF DEBUG
                     #WRITE Setting debugging ON...
                     -g
                     #ENDIF

              if "DEBUG is defined, this will produce a line

              Setting debugging ON...

              and will then switch on debugging information in the compiler.

       <u>#INCLUDE</u>

              <u>Syntax</u> #INCLUDE filename

                     #INCLUDE instructs the compiler to read the contents of  "filename"  before  continuing  to
                     process options in the current file.

                     This  can  be useful if you want to have a particular configuration file for a project (or,
                     under Unix like systems (such as Linux), in your home directory), but  still want  to  have
                     the global options that are set in a global configuration file.

              <u>Example</u>
                     #IFDEF LINUX
                       #INCLUDE /etc/fpc.cfg
                     #ELSE
                       #IFDEF GO32V2
                         #INCLUDE c:\pp\bin\fpc.cfg
                       #ENDIF
                     #ENDIF

              This  will  include  /etc/fpc.cfg  if you're on a unix like machine (like linux), and will include
              c:\pp\bin\fpc.cfg on a dos machine.

       <u>#SECTION</u>

              <u>Syntax</u> #SECTION name

                     The #SECTION directive acts as a #IFDEF  directive,  only  it  doesn't  require  an  #ENDIF
                     directive.  the special name COMMON always exists, i.e. lines following #SECTION COMMON are
                     always read.

</pre><h4><b>Example</b></h4><pre>
       A standard block often used in (the Linux version of) fpc.cfg is

       -vwhin
       #IFDEF VER0_99_12
        #IFDEF FPC_LINK_STATIC
         -Fu/usr/lib/fpc/0.99.12/rtl/static
         -Fu/usr/lib/fpc/0.99.12/units/static
        #ENDIF
        #IFDEF FPC_LINK_DYNAMIC
         -Fu/usr/lib/fpc/0.99.12/rtl/shared
         -Fu/usr/lib/fpc/0.99.12/units/shared
        #ENDIF
        -Fu/usr/lib/fpc/0.99.12/rtl
        -Fu/usr/lib/fpc/0.99.12/units
       #ENDIF

       The block is copied into the fpc.cfg file for each version you use (normally the latest release  and  the
       lastest developpers snapshot.
