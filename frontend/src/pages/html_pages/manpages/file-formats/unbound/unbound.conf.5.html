</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>unbound.conf</b> - Unbound configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>unbound.conf</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>unbound.conf</b> is used to configure <u><a href="../man8/unbound.8.html">unbound</a></u>(8).  The file format has attributes and values. Some attributes
       have attributes inside them.  The notation is: attribute: value.

       Comments  start  with  #  and  last  to  the end of line. Empty lines are ignored as is whitespace at the
       beginning of a line.

       The utility <u><a href="../man8/unbound-checkconf.8.html">unbound-checkconf</a></u>(8) can be used to check unbound.conf prior to usage.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       An example config file is shown below. Copy this to /etc/unbound/unbound.conf and start the server with:

            $ unbound -c /etc/unbound/unbound.conf

       Most settings are the defaults. Stop the server with:

            $ kill `cat /etc/unbound/unbound.pid`

       Below is a minimal config file. The source distribution contains an extensive example.conf file with  all
       the options.

       # <a href="../man5/unbound.conf.5.html">unbound.conf</a>(5) config file for <a href="../man8/unbound.8.html">unbound</a>(8).
       server:
            directory: "/etc/unbound"
            username: unbound
            # make sure unbound can access entropy from inside the chroot.
            # e.g. on linux the use these commands (on BSD, <a href="../man8/devfs.8.html">devfs</a>(8) is used):
            #      mount --bind -n /dev/urandom /etc/unbound/dev/urandom
            # and  mount --bind -n /dev/log /etc/unbound/dev/log
            chroot: "/etc/unbound"
            # logfile: "/etc/unbound/unbound.log"  #uncomment to use logfile.
            pidfile: "/etc/unbound/unbound.pid"
            # verbosity: 1      # uncomment and increase to get more logging.
            # listen on all interfaces, answer queries from the local subnet.
            interface: 0.0.0.0
            interface: ::0
            access-control: 10.0.0.0/8 allow
            access-control: 2001:DB8::/64 allow

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       There  must  be  whitespace  between keywords.  Attribute keywords end with a colon ':'.  An attribute is
       followed by a value, or its containing attributes in which case it is referred to as a  clause.   Clauses
       can be repeated throughout the file (or included files) to group attributes under the same clause.

       Files can be included using the <b>include:</b> directive. It can appear anywhere, it accepts a single file name
       as  argument.  Processing continues as if the text from the included file was copied into the config file
       at that point.  If also using chroot, using full path  names  for  the  included  files  works,  relative
       pathnames  for  the  included  names  work  if  the  directory  where  the  daemon  is started equals its
       chroot/working directory or is specified before the include statement with directory: dir.  Wildcards can
       be used to include multiple files, see <u><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a></u>(7).

       For a more structural include option, the <b>include-toplevel:</b> directive can be used.  This closes  whatever
       clause  is  currently active (if any) and forces the use of clauses in the included files and right after
       this directive.

   <b>Server</b> <b>Options</b>
       These options are part of the <b>server:</b> clause.

       <b>verbosity:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              The verbosity number, level 0  means  no  verbosity,  only  errors.   Level  1  gives  operational
              information.   Level  2  gives  detailed  operational  information including short information per
              query.  Level 3 gives query level information, output per query.  Level 4  gives  algorithm  level
              information.   Level  5  logs  client  identification  for cache misses.  Default is level 1.  The
              verbosity can also be increased from the commandline, see <u><a href="../man8/unbound.8.html">unbound</a></u>(8).

       <b>statistics-interval:</b> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              The number of seconds between printing statistics to the log for every thread.  Disable with value
              0 or "". Default is disabled.  The histogram statistics are only  printed  if  replies  were  sent
              during  the statistics interval, requestlist statistics are printed for every interval (but can be
              0).  This is because the median calculation requires data to be present.

       <b>statistics-cumulative:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If enabled, statistics are cumulative since starting  Unbound,  without  clearing  the  statistics
              counters after logging the statistics. Default is no.

       <b>extended-statistics:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If  enabled,  extended  statistics  are  printed from <u><a href="../man8/unbound-control.8.html">unbound-control</a></u>(8).  Default is off, because
              keeping track of more statistics takes time.  The counters are listed in <u><a href="../man8/unbound-control.8.html">unbound-control</a></u>(8).

       <b>statistics-inhibit-zero:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If enabled, selected extended statistics with a value  of  0  are  inhibited  from  printing  with
              <u><a href="../man8/unbound-control.8.html">unbound-control</a></u>(8).   These  are  query types, query classes, query opcodes, answer rcodes (except
              NOERROR, FORMERR, SERVFAIL, NXDOMAIN, NOTIMPL, REFUSED) and RPZ actions.  Default is on.

       <b>num-threads:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              The number of threads to create to serve clients. Use 1 for no threading.

       <b>port:</b> <u>&lt;port</u> <u>number&gt;</u>
              The port number, default 53, on which the server responds to queries.

       <b>interface:</b> <u>&lt;ip</u> <u>address</u> <u>or</u> <u>interface</u> <u>name</u> <u>[@port]&gt;</u>
              Interface to use to connect to the network.  This  interface  is  listened  to  for  queries  from
              clients, and answers to clients are given from it.  Can be given multiple times to work on several
              interfaces. If none are given the default is to listen to localhost.  If an interface name is used
              instead of an ip address, the list of ip addresses on that interface are used.  The interfaces are
              not  changed  on  a  reload  (kill -HUP) but only on restart.  A port number can be specified with
              @port (without spaces between interface and port number), if not specified the default port  (from
              <b>port</b>) is used.

       <b>ip-address:</b> <u>&lt;ip</u> <u>address</u> <u>or</u> <u>interface</u> <u>name</u> <u>[@port]&gt;</u>
              Same as interface: (for ease of compatibility with nsd.conf).

       <b>interface-automatic:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Listen on all addresses on all (current and future) interfaces, detect the source interface on UDP
              queries and copy them to replies.  This is a lot like ip-transparent, but this option services all
              interfaces  whilst  with  ip-transparent you can select which (future) interfaces Unbound provides
              service on.  This feature is experimental, and needs support in  your  OS  for  particular  socket
              options.  Default value is no.

       <b>interface-automatic-ports:</b> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>
              List  the port numbers that interface-automatic listens on. If empty, the default port is listened
              on. The port numbers are separated by spaces in the string. Default is "".

              This can be used to have interface automatic to deal with the interface, and listen on the  normal
              port  number,  by including it in the list, and also https or dns over tls port numbers by putting
              them in the list as well.

       <b>outgoing-interface:</b> <u>&lt;ip</u> <u>address</u> <u>or</u> <u>ip6</u> <u>netblock&gt;</u>
              Interface to use  to  connect  to  the  network.  This  interface  is  used  to  send  queries  to
              authoritative  servers  and  receive their replies. Can be given multiple times to work on several
              interfaces. If none are given the default (all) is used. You can specify the  same  interfaces  in
              <b>interface:</b> and <b>outgoing-interface:</b> lines, the interfaces are then used for both purposes. Outgoing
              queries are sent via a random outgoing interface to counter spoofing.

              If  an IPv6 netblock is specified instead of an individual IPv6 address, outgoing UDP queries will
              use a randomised source address taken from the netblock to counter  spoofing.  Requires  the  IPv6
              netblock  to  be routed to the host running Unbound, and requires OS support for unprivileged non-
              local binds (currently only supported on Linux). Several netblocks may be specified with  multiple
              <b>outgoing-interface:</b>  options,  but  do  not  specify  both  an individual IPv6 address and an IPv6
              netblock, or the randomisation will be compromised.  Consider combining with  <b>prefer-ip6:</b>  <b>yes</b>  to
              increase  the  likelihood of IPv6 nameservers being selected for queries.  On Linux you need these
              two commands to be able to use the freebind socket option to receive traffic for the ip6 netblock:
              ip -6 addr add mynetblock/64 dev lo &amp;&amp; ip -6 route add local mynetblock/64 dev lo

       <b>outgoing-range:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Number of ports to open. This number of file descriptors can be opened  per  thread.  Must  be  at
              least  1.  Default  depends  on  compile  options.  Larger  numbers  need extra resources from the
              operating system.  For performance a very large value is best, use libevent to make this possible.

       <b>outgoing-port-permit:</b> <u>&lt;port</u> <u>number</u> <u>or</u> <u>range&gt;</u>
              Permit Unbound to open this port or range of ports for use to send queries.  A  larger  number  of
              permitted outgoing ports increases resilience against spoofing attempts. Make sure these ports are
              not needed by other daemons.  By default only ports above 1024 that have not been assigned by IANA
              are used.  Give a port number or a range of the form "low-high", without spaces.

              The <b>outgoing-port-permit</b> and <b>outgoing-port-avoid</b> statements are processed in the line order of the
              config  file, adding the permitted ports and subtracting the avoided ports from the set of allowed
              ports.  The processing starts with the non IANA allocated ports above 1024 in the set  of  allowed
              ports.

       <b>outgoing-port-avoid:</b> <u>&lt;port</u> <u>number</u> <u>or</u> <u>range&gt;</u>
              Do  not  permit  Unbound  to open this port or range of ports for use to send queries. Use this to
              make sure Unbound does not grab a port that another daemon needs.  The  port  is  avoided  on  all
              outgoing  interfaces,  both  IP4  and  IP6.   By  default only ports above 1024 that have not been
              assigned by IANA are used.  Give a port number or a range of the form "low-high", without spaces.

       <b>outgoing-num-tcp:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Number of outgoing TCP buffers to allocate per thread. Default is 10. If set to 0, or if do-tcp is
              "no", no TCP queries to authoritative servers are done.  For larger installations increasing  this
              value is a good idea.

       <b>incoming-num-tcp:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Number of incoming TCP buffers to allocate per thread. Default is 10. If set to 0, or if do-tcp is
              "no",  no TCP queries from clients are accepted. For larger installations increasing this value is
              a good idea.

       <b>edns-buffer-size:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Number of bytes size to advertise as the EDNS reassembly buffer size.  This is the value put  into
              datagrams  over  UDP towards peers.  The actual buffer size is determined by msg-buffer-size (both
              for TCP and UDP).  Do not set higher than that value.  Default is 1232 which is the DNS  Flag  Day
              2020  recommendation.  Setting  to  512 bypasses even the most stringent path MTU problems, but is
              seen as extreme, since the amount of TCP fallback generated is excessive (probably also  for  this
              resolver, consider tuning the outgoing tcp number).

       <b>max-udp-size:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Maximum  UDP  response  size  (not applied to TCP response).  65536 disables the udp response size
              maximum, and uses the choice from the client, always.  Suggested values are 512 to  4096.  Default
              is 1232. The default value is the same as the default for edns-buffer-size.

       <b>stream-wait-size:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Number  of bytes size maximum to use for waiting stream buffers.  Default is 4 megabytes.  A plain
              number is in bytes, append 'k', 'm' or 'g' for kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes (1024*1024  bytes
              in  a  megabyte).  As TCP and TLS streams queue up multiple results, the amount of memory used for
              these buffers does not exceed this number, otherwise the responses are dropped.  This manages  the
              total  memory  usage of the server (under heavy use), the number of requests that can be queued up
              per connection is also limited, with further requests waiting in TCP buffers.

       <b>msg-buffer-size:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Number of bytes size of the message buffers. Default is 65552 bytes, enough for 64 Kb packets, the
              maximum DNS message size. No message larger than this can be sent or received. Can be  reduced  to
              use less memory, but some requests for DNS data, such as for huge resource records, will result in
              a SERVFAIL reply to the client.

       <b>msg-cache-size:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Number  of  bytes  size of the message cache. Default is 4 megabytes.  A plain number is in bytes,
              append 'k', 'm' or 'g' for kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes (1024*1024 bytes in a megabyte).

       <b>msg-cache-slabs:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Number of slabs in the message cache. Slabs reduce lock contention by threads.  Must be set  to  a
              power of 2. Setting (close) to the number of cpus is a reasonable guess.

       <b>num-queries-per-thread:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              The  number of queries that every thread will service simultaneously.  If more queries arrive that
              need servicing, and no queries can be jostled out  (see  <u>jostle-timeout</u>),  then  the  queries  are
              dropped. This forces the client to resend after a timeout; allowing the server time to work on the
              existing queries. Default depends on compile options, 512 or 1024.

       <b>jostle-timeout:</b> <u>&lt;msec&gt;</u>
              Timeout  used  when the server is very busy.  Set to a value that usually results in one roundtrip
              to the authority servers.  If too many queries arrive, then 50% of the queries are allowed to  run
              to  completion,  and  the  other 50% are replaced with the new incoming query if they have already
              spent more than their allowed time.  This protects against denial of service by  slow  queries  or
              high  query rates.  Default 200 milliseconds.  The effect is that the qps for long-lasting queries
              is about (numqueriesperthread / 2) / (average time for such long queries) qps.  The qps for  short
              queries  can be about (numqueriesperthread / 2) / (jostletimeout in whole seconds) qps per thread,
              about (1024/2)*5 = 2560 qps by default.

       <b>delay-close:</b> <u>&lt;msec&gt;</u>
              Extra delay for timeouted UDP ports before they are closed, in  msec.   Default  is  0,  and  that
              disables it.  This prevents very delayed answer packets from the upstream (recursive) servers from
              bouncing against closed ports and setting off all sort of close-port counters, with eg. 1500 msec.
              When  timeouts  happen  you  need  extra  sockets,  it checks the ID and remote IP of packets, and
              unwanted packets are added to the unwanted packet counter.

       <b>udp-connect:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Perform connect for UDP sockets that mitigates ICMP side channel leakage.  Default is yes.

       <b>unknown-server-time-limit:</b> <u>&lt;msec&gt;</u>
              The wait time in msec for waiting for an unknown server to reply.  Increase this if you are behind
              a slow satellite link, to eg. 1128.  That would then avoid re-querying every initial query because
              it times out.  Default is 376 msec.

       <b>discard-timeout:</b> <u>&lt;msec&gt;</u>
              The wait time in msec where recursion requests are dropped. This is to  stop  a  large  number  of
              replies  from  accumulating. They receive no reply, the work item continues to recurse. It is nice
              to be a bit larger than serve-expired-client-timeout if that is enabled.  A value of 1900 msec  is
              suggested. The value 0 disables it.  Default 1900 msec.

       <b>wait-limit:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              The  number of replies that can wait for recursion, for an IP address.  This makes a ratelimit per
              IP address of waiting replies for recursion.  It stops very large amounts of queries waiting to be
              returned to one destination. The value 0 disables wait limits. Default is 1000.

       <b>wait-limit-cookie:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              The number of replies that can wait for recursion, for an IP address that sent the  query  with  a
              valid  DNS cookie. Since the cookie validates the client address, the limit can be higher. Default
              is 10000.

       <b>wait-limit-netblock:</b> <u>&lt;netblock&gt;</u> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              The wait limit for the netblock. If not given the wait-limit value  is  used.  The  most  specific
              netblock  is  used to determine the limit. Useful for overriding the default for a specific, group
              or individual, server.  The value -1 disables wait limits for the netblock.

       <b>wait-limit-cookie-netblock:</b> <u>&lt;netblock&gt;</u> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              The wait limit  for  the  netblock,  when  the  query  has  a  DNS  cookie.   If  not  given,  the
              wait-limit-cookie value is used.  The value -1 disables wait limits for the netblock.

       <b>so-rcvbuf:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              If  not  0,  then set the SO_RCVBUF socket option to get more buffer space on UDP port 53 incoming
              queries.  So that short spikes on busy servers do not drop packets (see counter in  netstat  -su).
              Default  is  0  (use system value).  Otherwise, the number of bytes to ask for, try "4m" on a busy
              server.  The OS caps it at a maximum, on linux Unbound needs root permission to bypass the  limit,
              or   the   admin   can  use  sysctl  net.core.rmem_max.   On  BSD  change  kern.ipc.maxsockbuf  in
              /etc/sysctl.conf.  On OpenBSD change header and recompile kernel. On  Solaris  ndd  -set  /dev/udp
              udp_max_buf 8388608.

       <b>so-sndbuf:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              If  not  0,  then set the SO_SNDBUF socket option to get more buffer space on UDP port 53 outgoing
              queries.  This for very busy servers handles spikes in answer traffic, otherwise  'send:  resource
              temporarily  unavailable'  can  get  logged,  the  buffer  overrun is also visible by netstat -su.
              Default is 0 (use system value).  Specify the number of bytes to ask for, try "4m" on a very  busy
              server.   The OS caps it at a maximum, on linux Unbound needs root permission to bypass the limit,
              or the admin can use sysctl net.core.wmem_max.  On BSD, Solaris changes are similar to so-rcvbuf.

       <b>so-reuseport:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If yes, then open dedicated listening sockets for incoming queries for each thread and try to  set
              the  SO_REUSEPORT  socket  option on each socket.  May distribute incoming queries to threads more
              evenly.  Default is yes.  On Linux it is supported in kernels &gt;= 3.9.  On other systems,  FreeBSD,
              OSX  it  may  also work.  You can enable it (on any platform and kernel), it then attempts to open
              the port and passes the option if it was available at compile time, if that works it is  used,  if
              it fails, it continues silently (unless verbosity 3) without the option.  At extreme load it could
              be better to turn it off to distribute the queries evenly, reported for Linux systems (4.4.x).

       <b>ip-transparent:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If  yes,  then use IP_TRANSPARENT socket option on sockets where Unbound is listening for incoming
              traffic.  Default no.  Allows you to bind to non-local interfaces.  For example  for  non-existent
              IP  addresses  that  are going to exist later on, with host failover configuration.  This is a lot
              like interface-automatic, but that one services all interfaces and with this option you can select
              which (future) interfaces Unbound provides service on.  This option needs Unbound  to  be  started
              with  root  permissions  on  some  systems.   The  option  uses  IP_BINDANY on FreeBSD systems and
              SO_BINDANY on OpenBSD systems.

       <b>ip-freebind:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If yes, then use IP_FREEBIND socket option on sockets  where  Unbound  is  listening  to  incoming
              traffic.   Default no.  Allows you to bind to IP addresses that are nonlocal or do not exist, like
              when the network interface or IP address is  down.   Exists  only  on  Linux,  where  the  similar
              ip-transparent option is also available.

       <b>ip-dscp:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              The  value  of  the  Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP) in the differentiated services field
              (DS) of the outgoing IP packet headers.  The field  replaces  the  outdated  IPv4  Type-Of-Service
              field and the IPv6 traffic class field.

       <b>rrset-cache-size:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Number  of  bytes  size  of  the RRset cache. Default is 4 megabytes.  A plain number is in bytes,
              append 'k', 'm' or 'g' for kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes (1024*1024 bytes in a megabyte).

       <b>rrset-cache-slabs:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Number of slabs in the RRset cache. Slabs reduce lock contention by threads.  Must  be  set  to  a
              power of 2.

       <b>cache-max-ttl:</b> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              Time to live maximum for RRsets and messages in the cache. Default is 86400 seconds (1 day).  When
              the  TTL expires, the cache item has expired.  Can be set lower to force the resolver to query for
              data often, and not trust (very large) TTL values.  Downstream clients also see the lower TTL.

       <b>cache-min-ttl:</b> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              Time to live minimum for RRsets and messages in the cache. Default is 0.  If the minimum kicks in,
              the data is cached for longer than the domain owner intended, and thus less queries  are  made  to
              look  up  the data.  Zero makes sure the data in the cache is as the domain owner intended, higher
              values, especially more than an hour or so, can lead to trouble as the data in the cache does  not
              match up with the actual data any more.

       <b>cache-max-negative-ttl:</b> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              Time  to  live  maximum  for negative responses, these have a SOA in the authority section that is
              limited in time.  Default is 3600.  This applies to nxdomain and nodata answers.

       <b>cache-min-negative-ttl:</b> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              Time to live minimum for negative responses, these have a SOA in the  authority  section  that  is
              limited  in  time.  Default is 0 (disabled).  If this is disabled and <b>cache-min-ttl</b> is configured,
              it will take effect instead.  In that case you can set this to 1 to honor the upstream TTL.   This
              applies to nxdomain and nodata answers.

       <b>infra-host-ttl:</b> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              Time to live for entries in the host cache. The host cache contains roundtrip timing, lameness and
              EDNS support information. Default is 900.

       <b>infra-cache-slabs:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Number  of slabs in the infrastructure cache. Slabs reduce lock contention by threads. Must be set
              to a power of 2.

       <b>infra-cache-numhosts:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Number of hosts for which information is cached. Default is 10000.

       <b>infra-cache-min-rtt:</b> <u>&lt;msec&gt;</u>
              Lower limit for dynamic retransmit timeout calculation in  infrastructure  cache.  Default  is  50
              milliseconds.  Increase  this  value  if  using  forwarders needing more time to do recursive name
              resolution.

       <b>infra-cache-max-rtt:</b> <u>&lt;msec&gt;</u>
              Upper limit for dynamic retransmit timeout calculation  in  infrastructure  cache.  Default  is  2
              minutes.

       <b>infra-keep-probing:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If  enabled  the  server  keeps  probing  hosts  that are down, in the one probe at a time regime.
              Default is no.  Hosts that are down, eg. they did not respond during  the  one  probe  at  a  time
              period, are marked as down and it may take <b>infra-host-ttl</b> time to get probed again.

       <b>define-tag:</b> <u>&lt;"list</u> <u>of</u> <u>tags"&gt;</u>
              Define  the  tags  that  can be used with local-zone and access-control.  Enclose the list between
              quotes ("") and put spaces between tags.

       <b>do-ip4:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enable or disable whether ip4 queries are answered or issued. Default is yes.

       <b>do-ip6:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enable or disable whether ip6 queries are answered  or  issued.  Default  is  yes.   If  disabled,
              queries  are  not  answered on IPv6, and queries are not sent on IPv6 to the internet nameservers.
              With this option you can disable the IPv6 transport for sending DNS traffic, it  does  not  impact
              the contents of the DNS traffic, which may have ip4 and ip6 addresses in it.

       <b>prefer-ip4:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If  enabled, prefer IPv4 transport for sending DNS queries to internet nameservers. Default is no.
              Useful if the IPv6 netblock the server has, the entire /64 of that is not owned  by  one  operator
              and the reputation of the netblock /64 is an issue, using IPv4 then uses the IPv4 filters that the
              upstream servers have.

       <b>prefer-ip6:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If enabled, prefer IPv6 transport for sending DNS queries to internet nameservers. Default is no.

       <b>do-udp:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enable or disable whether UDP queries are answered or issued. Default is yes.

       <b>do-tcp:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enable or disable whether TCP queries are answered or issued. Default is yes.

       <b>tcp-mss:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Maximum segment size (MSS) of TCP socket on which the server responds to queries. Value lower than
              common  MSS  on  Ethernet  (1220  for  example)  will address path MTU problem.  Note that not all
              platform supports socket option to set MSS (TCP_MAXSEG).  Default is system default MSS determined
              by interface MTU and negotiation between server and client.

       <b>outgoing-tcp-mss:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Maximum segment size (MSS) of TCP socket for outgoing queries (from  Unbound  to  other  servers).
              Value  lower  than  common MSS on Ethernet (1220 for example) will address path MTU problem.  Note
              that not all platform supports socket option to set MSS (TCP_MAXSEG).  Default is  system  default
              MSS determined by interface MTU and negotiation between Unbound and other servers.

       <b>tcp-idle-timeout:</b> <u>&lt;msec&gt;</u>
              The  period  Unbound  will  wait for a query on a TCP connection.  If this timeout expires Unbound
              closes the connection.  This option defaults to 30000  milliseconds.   When  the  number  of  free
              incoming  TCP  buffers  falls  below  50% of the total number configured, the option value used is
              progressively reduced, first to 1% of the configured value, then to 0.2% of the  configured  value
              if  the number of free buffers falls below 35% of the total number configured, and finally to 0 if
              the number of free buffers falls below 20% of the total number configured. A  minimum  timeout  of
              200  milliseconds  is  observed  regardless  of  the  option value used.  It will be overridden by
              <b>edns-tcp-keepalive-timeout</b> if <b>edns-tcp-keepalive</b> is enabled.

       <b>tcp-reuse-timeout:</b> <u>&lt;msec&gt;</u>
              The period Unbound will keep TCP persistent connections open to  authority  servers.  This  option
              defaults to 60000 milliseconds.

       <b>max-reuse-tcp-queries:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              The  maximum  number  of  queries  that  can  be sent on a persistent TCP connection.  This option
              defaults to 200 queries.

       <b>tcp-auth-query-timeout:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Timeout in  milliseconds  for  TCP  queries  to  auth  servers.   This  option  defaults  to  3000
              milliseconds.

       <b>edns-tcp-keepalive:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enable or disable EDNS TCP Keepalive. Default is no.

       <b>edns-tcp-keepalive-timeout:</b> <u>&lt;msec&gt;</u>
              Overrides  <b>tcp-idle-timeout</b>  when  <b>edns-tcp-keepalive</b> is enabled.  If the client supports the EDNS
              TCP Keepalive option, Unbound sends the timeout value to the client to encourage it to  close  the
              connection before the server times out.  This option defaults to 120000 milliseconds.

       <b>sock-queue-timeout:</b> <u>&lt;sec&gt;</u>
              UDP  queries  that  have waited in the socket buffer for a long time can be dropped. Default is 0,
              disabled. The time is set in seconds, 3 could be a good value to ignore old  queries  that  likely
              the  client does not need a reply for any more. This could happen if the host has not been able to
              service the queries for a while, i.e. Unbound is not running, and then is enabled again.  It  uses
              timestamp socket options.

       <b>tcp-upstream:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enable or disable whether the upstream queries use TCP only for transport.  Default is no.  Useful
              in  tunneling  scenarios.  If set to no you can specify TCP transport only for selected forward or
              stub zones using forward-tcp-upstream or stub-tcp-upstream respectively.

       <b>udp-upstream-without-downstream:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enable udp upstream even if do-udp is no.  Default is no,  and  this  does  not  change  anything.
              Useful for TLS service providers, that want no udp downstream but use udp to fetch data upstream.

       <b>tls-upstream:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enabled  or  disable  whether  the  upstream  queries  use TLS only for transport.  Default is no.
              Useful in tunneling scenarios.  The TLS contains plain DNS in TCP wireformat.   The  other  server
              must  support this (see <b>tls-service-key</b>).  If you enable this, also configure a tls-cert-bundle or
              use tls-win-cert or tls-system-cert  to  load  CA  certs,  otherwise  the  connections  cannot  be
              authenticated.  This  option  enables  TLS  for  all  of  them, but if you do not set this you can
              configure TLS specifically for some  forward  zones  with  forward-tls-upstream.   And  also  with
              stub-tls-upstream.   If  the tls-upstream option is enabled, it is for all the forwards and stubs,
              where the forward-tls-upstream and stub-tls-upstream options are ignored, as if they had been  set
              to yes.

       <b>ssl-upstream:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Alternate syntax for <b>tls-upstream</b>.  If both are present in the config file the last is used.

       <b>tls-service-key:</b> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
              If  enabled,  the  server  provides DNS-over-TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS service on the TCP ports marked
              implicitly or explicitly for these services with tls-port or https-port. The file must contain the
              private key for the TLS session, the public certificate is in the tls-service-pem file and it must
              also be specified if tls-service-key is specified.  The default is "", turned  off.   Enabling  or
              disabling  this service requires a restart (a reload is not enough), because the key is read while
              root permissions are held and before chroot (if any).  The ports enabled implicitly or  explicitly
              via  <b>tls-port:</b> and <b>https-port:</b> do not provide normal DNS TCP service. Unbound needs to be compiled
              with libnghttp2 in order to provide DNS-over-HTTPS.

       <b>ssl-service-key:</b> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
              Alternate syntax for <b>tls-service-key</b>.

       <b>tls-service-pem:</b> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
              The public key certificate pem file for the tls service.  Default is "", turned off.

       <b>ssl-service-pem:</b> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
              Alternate syntax for <b>tls-service-pem</b>.

       <b>tls-port:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              The port number on which to provide TCP TLS service, default 853, only interfaces configured  with
              that port number as @number get the TLS service.

       <b>ssl-port:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Alternate syntax for <b>tls-port</b>.

       <b>tls-cert-bundle:</b> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
              If  null  or  "",  no  file  is  used.   Set  it  to  the  certificate  bundle  file,  for example
              "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt".  These certificates are used  for  authenticating  connections
              made to outside peers.  For example auth-zone urls, and also DNS over TLS connections.  It is read
              at start up before permission drop and chroot.

       <b>ssl-cert-bundle:</b> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
              Alternate syntax for <b>tls-cert-bundle</b>.

       <b>tls-win-cert:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Add  the  system  certificates  to  the  cert  bundle certificates for authentication.  If no cert
              bundle, it uses only these certificates.   Default  is  no.   On  windows  this  option  uses  the
              certificates  from  the  cert  store.   Use  the tls-cert-bundle option on other systems. On other
              systems, this option enables the system certificates.

       <b>tls-system-cert:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              This the same setting as the tls-win-cert setting, under a different  name.   Because  it  is  not
              windows specific.

       <b>tls-additional-port:</b> <u>&lt;portnr&gt;</u>
              List  portnumbers  as  tls-additional-port,  and  when  interfaces are defined, eg. with the @port
              suffix, as this port number, they provide dns over TLS service.  Can list multiple, each on a  new
              statement.

       <b>tls-session-ticket-keys:</b> <u>&lt;file&gt;</u>
              If  not  "",  lists  files  with  80 bytes of random contents that are used to perform TLS session
              resumption for clients using the Unbound server.  These files contain the secret key for  the  TLS
              session  tickets.   First  key  use to encrypt and decrypt TLS session tickets.  Other keys use to
              decrypt only.  With this you can roll over to new  keys,  by  generating  a  new  first  file  and
              allowing  decrypt of the old file by listing it after the first file for some time, after the wait
              clients are not using the old key any more and the old key can be removed.  One way to create  the
              file  is dd if=/dev/random bs=1 count=80 of=ticket.dat The first 16 bytes should be different from
              the old one if you create a second key, that is the name used to identify the key.  Then there  is
              32 bytes random data for an AES key and then 32 bytes random data for the HMAC key.

       <b>tls-ciphers:</b> <u>&lt;string</u> <u>with</u> <u>cipher</u> <u>list&gt;</u>
              Set the list of ciphers to allow when serving TLS.  Use "" for defaults, and that is the default.

       <b>tls-ciphersuites:</b> <u>&lt;string</u> <u>with</u> <u>ciphersuites</u> <u>list&gt;</u>
              Set  the  list  of ciphersuites to allow when serving TLS.  This is for newer TLS 1.3 connections.
              Use "" for defaults, and that is the default.

       <b>pad-responses:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If enabled, TLS serviced queries that contained an EDNS Padding option will cause responses padded
              to the closest multiple of the size specified in <b>pad-responses-block-size</b>.  Default is yes.

       <b>pad-responses-block-size:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              The block size with which to pad responses serviced over TLS. Only  responses  to  padded  queries
              will be padded.  Default is 468.

       <b>pad-queries:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If enabled, all queries sent over TLS upstreams will be padded to the closest multiple of the size
              specified in <b>pad-queries-block-size</b>.  Default is yes.

       <b>pad-queries-block-size:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              The block size with which to pad queries sent over TLS upstreams.  Default is 128.

       <b>tls-use-sni:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enable  or  disable  sending  the SNI extension on TLS connections.  Default is yes.  Changing the
              value requires a reload.

       <b>https-port:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              The port number  on  which  to  provide  DNS-over-HTTPS  service,  default  443,  only  interfaces
              configured with that port number as @number get the HTTPS service.

       <b>http-endpoint:</b> <u>&lt;endpoint</u> <u>string&gt;</u>
              The HTTP endpoint to provide DNS-over-HTTPS service on. Default "/dns-query".

       <b>http-max-streams:</b> <u>&lt;number</u> <u>of</u> <u>streams&gt;</u>
              Number used in the SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS parameter in the HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame for DNS-
              over-HTTPS connections. Default 100.

       <b>http-query-buffer-size:</b> <u>&lt;size</u> <u>in</u> <u>bytes&gt;</u>
              Maximum  number  of  bytes  used  for  all  HTTP/2  query  buffers combined. These buffers contain
              (partial) DNS queries waiting for request stream completion.  An RST_STREAM frame will be send  to
              streams  exceeding this limit. Default is 4 megabytes. A plain number is in bytes, append 'k', 'm'
              or 'g' for kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes (1024*1024 bytes in a megabyte).

       <b>http-response-buffer-size:</b> <u>&lt;size</u> <u>in</u> <u>bytes&gt;</u>
              Maximum number of bytes used for all HTTP/2 response buffers combined. These buffers  contain  DNS
              responses  waiting to be written back to the clients.  An RST_STREAM frame will be send to streams
              exceeding this limit. Default is 4 megabytes. A plain number is in bytes, append 'k', 'm'  or  'g'
              for kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes (1024*1024 bytes in a megabyte).

       <b>http-nodelay:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Set  TCP_NODELAY  socket option on sockets used to provide DNS-over-HTTPS service.  Ignored if the
              option is not available. Default is yes.

       <b>http-notls-downstream:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Disable use of TLS for the downstream  DNS-over-HTTP  connections.   Useful  for  local  back  end
              servers.  Default is no.

       <b>proxy-protocol-port:</b> <u>&lt;portnr&gt;</u>
              List  port  numbers  as  proxy-protocol-port,  and when interfaces are defined, eg. with the @port
              suffix, as this port number, they support and expect PROXYv2.  In this case the proxy address will
              only be used for the network  communication  and  initial  ACL  (check  if  the  proxy  itself  is
              denied/refused  by  configuration).   The  proxied  address (if any) will then be used as the true
              client address  and  will  be  used  where  applicable  for  logging,  ACL,  DNSTAP,  RPZ  and  IP
              ratelimiting.  PROXYv2 is supported for UDP and TCP/TLS listening interfaces.  There is no support
              for PROXYv2 on a DoH or DNSCrypt listening interface.  Can list multiple, each on a new statement.

       <b>quic-port:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              The port number on which to provide DNS-over-QUIC service, default 853, only interfaces configured
              with  that  port  number  as  @number  get  the QUIC service.  The interface uses QUIC for the UDP
              traffic on that port number.

       <b>quic-size:</b> <u>&lt;size</u> <u>in</u> <u>bytes&gt;</u>
              Maximum number of bytes for all QUIC buffers and data combined. Default is 8  megabytes.  A  plain
              number  is in bytes, append 'k', 'm' or 'g' for kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes (1024*1024 bytes
              in a megabyte). New connections receive connection refused when the limit is exceeded. New streams
              are reset when the limit is exceeded.

       <b>use-systemd:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enable or disable systemd socket activation.  Default is no.

       <b>do-daemonize:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enable or disable whether the Unbound server forks into the background as a daemon.  Set the value
              to <u>no</u> when Unbound runs as systemd service.  Default is yes.

       <b>tcp-connection-limit:</b> <u>&lt;IP</u> <u>netblock&gt;</u> <u>&lt;limit&gt;</u>
              Allow up to <u>limit</u> simultaneous TCP connections from  the  given  netblock.   When  at  the  limit,
              further  connections  are  accepted  but  closed immediately.  This option is experimental at this
              time.

       <b>access-control:</b> <u>&lt;IP</u> <u>netblock&gt;</u> <u>&lt;action&gt;</u>
              Specify treatment of incoming queries from their originating IP address.  Queries can  be  allowed
              to have access to this server that gives DNS answers, or refused, with other actions possible. The
              IP  address  range  can  be  specified as a netblock, it is possible to give the statement several
              times in order to specify the treatment of different netblocks.

              The netblock is given as an IP4 or IP6 address with /size appended for a classless network  block.
              The  action  can be <u>deny</u>, <u>refuse</u>, <u>allow</u>, <u>allow_setrd</u>, <u>allow_snoop</u>, <u>allow_cookie</u>, <u>deny_non_local</u> or
              <u>refuse_non_local</u>.  The most specific netblock match is used, if none match <u>refuse</u>  is  used.   The
              order of the access-control statements therefore does not matter.

              The <u>deny</u> action stops queries from hosts from that netblock.

              The <u>refuse</u> action stops queries too, but sends a DNS rcode REFUSED error message back.

              The  <u>allow</u>  action gives access to clients from that netblock.  It gives only access for recursion
              clients (which is what almost all clients need).  Nonrecursive queries are refused.

              The <u>allow</u> action does allow nonrecursive queries to access the local-data that is configured.  The
              reason is that this does not involve the Unbound server recursive  lookup  algorithm,  and  static
              data  is served in the reply.  This supports normal operations where nonrecursive queries are made
              for the authoritative data.  For nonrecursive queries any  replies  from  the  dynamic  cache  are
              refused.

              The  <u>allow_setrd</u>  action  ignores the recursion desired (RD) bit and treats all requests as if the
              recursion desired bit is set.  Note that this behavior violates RFC 1034 which states that a  name
              server  should  never  perform recursive service unless asked via the RD bit since this interferes
              with trouble shooting of name servers and their databases. This prohibited behavior may be  useful
              if  another DNS server must forward requests for specific zones to a resolver DNS server, but only
              supports stub domains and sends queries to the resolver DNS server with the RD bit cleared.

              The <u>allow_snoop</u> action gives nonrecursive access too.  This give both recursive and non  recursive
              access.  The name <u>allow_snoop</u> refers to cache snooping, a technique to use nonrecursive queries to
              examine  the  cache  contents  (for  malicious acts).  However, nonrecursive queries can also be a
              valuable debugging tool (when  you  want  to  examine  the  cache  contents).  In  that  case  use
              <u>allow_snoop</u> for your administration host.

              The  <u>allow_cookie</u>  action  allows  access  only  to UDP queries that contain a valid DNS Cookie as
              specified in RFC 7873 and RFC 9018,  when  the  <b>answer-cookie</b>  option  is  enabled.   UDP  queries
              containing only a DNS Client Cookie and no Server Cookie, or an invalid DNS Cookie, will receive a
              BADCOOKIE response including a newly generated DNS Cookie, allowing clients to retry with that DNS
              Cookie.  The <u>allow_cookie</u> action will also accept requests over stateful transports, regardless of
              the  presence of an DNS Cookie and regardless of the <b>answer-cookie</b> setting.  UDP queries without a
              DNS Cookie receive REFUSED responses with the TC flag set, that may trigger fall back to  TCP  for
              those clients.

              By  default only localhost (the 127.0.0.0/8 IP netblock, not the loopback interface) is implicitly
              <u>allow</u>ed, the rest is <u>refuse</u>d.  The default is <u>refuse</u>d, because that is protocol-friendly. The  DNS
              protocol  is  not  designed  to  handle  dropped packets due to policy, and dropping may result in
              (possibly excessive) retried queries.

              The deny_non_local and refuse_non_local settings are for hosts that are only allowed to query  for
              the  authoritative local-data, they are not allowed full recursion but only the static data.  With
              deny_non_local, messages that are disallowed are dropped, with refuse_non_local they receive error
              code REFUSED.

       <b>access-control-tag:</b> <u>&lt;IP</u> <u>netblock&gt;</u> <u>&lt;"list</u> <u>of</u> <u>tags"&gt;</u>
              Assign tags to access-control elements. Clients using this access control element  use  localzones
              that are tagged with one of these tags. Tags must be defined in <u>define-tags</u>.  Enclose list of tags
              in  quotes  ("")  and  put spaces between tags. If access-control-tag is configured for a netblock
              that does not have an access-control, an access-control element with action  <u>allow</u>  is  configured
              for this netblock.

       <b>access-control-tag-action:</b> <u>&lt;IP</u> <u>netblock&gt;</u> <u>&lt;tag&gt;</u> <u>&lt;action&gt;</u>
              Set  action  for particular tag for given access control element. If you have multiple tag values,
              the tag used to  lookup  the  action  is  the  first  tag  match  between  access-control-tag  and
              local-zone-tag where "first" comes from the order of the define-tag values.

       <b>access-control-tag-data:</b> <u>&lt;IP</u> <u>netblock&gt;</u> <u>&lt;tag&gt;</u> <u>&lt;"resource</u> <u>record</u> <u>string"&gt;</u>
              Set redirect data for particular tag for given access control element.

       <b>access-control-view:</b> <u>&lt;IP</u> <u>netblock&gt;</u> <u>&lt;view</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              Set view for given access control element.

       <b>interface-action:</b> <u>&lt;ip</u> <u>address</u> <u>or</u> <u>interface</u> <u>name</u> <u>[@port]&gt;</u> <u>&lt;action&gt;</u>
              Similar to <b>access-control:</b> but for interfaces.

              The  action  is  the  same  as  the ones defined under <b>access-control:</b>.  Interfaces are <u>refuse</u>d by
              default.  By default only localhost (the 127.0.0.0/8 IP netblock, not the loopback  interface)  is
              implicitly <u>allow</u>ed through the default <b>access-control:</b> behavior.  This also means that any attempt
              to  use  the  <b>interface-*:</b>  options  for  the  loopback  interface  will  not work as they will be
              overridden by the implicit default "<b>access-control:</b> 127.0.0.0/8 allow" option.

              Note that the interface needs to be  already  specified  with  <b>interface:</b>  and  that  any  <b>access-</b>
              <b>control*:</b> setting overrides all <b>interface-*:</b> settings for targeted clients.

       <b>interface-tag:</b> <u>&lt;ip</u> <u>address</u> <u>or</u> <u>interface</u> <u>name</u> <u>[@port]&gt;</u> <u>&lt;"list</u> <u>of</u> <u>tags"&gt;</u>
              Similar to <b>access-control-tag:</b> but for interfaces.

              Note  that  the  interface  needs  to  be  already  specified with <b>interface:</b> and that any <b>access-</b>
              <b>control*:</b> setting overrides all <b>interface-*:</b> settings for targeted clients.

       <b>interface-tag-action:</b> <u>&lt;ip</u> <u>address</u> <u>or</u> <u>interface</u> <u>name</u> <u>[@port]&gt;</u> <u>&lt;tag&gt;</u> <u>&lt;action&gt;</u>
              Similar to <b>access-control-tag-action:</b> but for interfaces.

              Note that the interface needs to be  already  specified  with  <b>interface:</b>  and  that  any  <b>access-</b>
              <b>control*:</b> setting overrides all <b>interface-*:</b> settings for targeted clients.

       <b>interface-tag-data:</b> <u>&lt;ip</u> <u>address</u> <u>or</u> <u>interface</u> <u>name</u> <u>[@port]&gt;</u> <u>&lt;tag&gt;</u> <u>&lt;"resource</u> <u>record</u> <u>string"&gt;</u>
              Similar to <b>access-control-tag-data:</b> but for interfaces.

              Note  that  the  interface  needs  to  be  already  specified with <b>interface:</b> and that any <b>access-</b>
              <b>control*:</b> setting overrides all <b>interface-*:</b> settings for targeted clients.

       <b>interface-view:</b> <u>&lt;ip</u> <u>address</u> <u>or</u> <u>interface</u> <u>name</u> <u>[@port]&gt;</u> <u>&lt;view</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              Similar to <b>access-control-view:</b> but for interfaces.

              Note that the interface needs to be  already  specified  with  <b>interface:</b>  and  that  any  <b>access-</b>
              <b>control*:</b> setting overrides all <b>interface-*:</b> settings for targeted clients.

       <b>chroot:</b> <u>&lt;directory&gt;</u>
              If  chroot  is  enabled, you should pass the configfile (from the commandline) as a full path from
              the original root. After the chroot has been performed the now defunct portion of the config  file
              path is removed to be able to reread the config after a reload.

              All  other file paths (working dir, logfile, roothints, and key files) can be specified in several
              ways: as an absolute path relative to the new root, as a relative path to the  working  directory,
              or  as  an  absolute path relative to the original root.  In the last case the path is adjusted to
              remove the unused portion.

              The pidfile can be either a relative path to the working directory, or an absolute  path  relative
              to the original root. It is written just prior to chroot and dropping permissions. This allows the
              pidfile  to  be  /var/run/unbound.pid  and  the  chroot to be /var/unbound, for example. Note that
              Unbound is not able to remove the pidfile after termination when it  is  located  outside  of  the
              chroot directory.

              Additionally, Unbound may need to access /dev/urandom (for entropy) from inside the chroot.

              If  given a chroot is done to the given directory. By default chroot is enabled and the default is
              "". If you give "" no chroot is performed.

       <b>username:</b> <u>&lt;name&gt;</u>
              If given, after binding the port the user privileges are dropped. Default  is  "unbound".  If  you
              give username: "" no user change is performed.

              If  this  user  is  not capable of binding the port, reloads (by signal HUP) will still retain the
              opened ports.  If you change the port number in the config file, and that new port number requires
              privileges, then a reload will fail; a restart is needed.

       <b>directory:</b> <u>&lt;directory&gt;</u>
              Sets the working directory for the program. Default is  "/etc/unbound".   On  Windows  the  string
              "%EXECUTABLE%"  tries  to  change  to  the  directory  that unbound.exe resides in.  If you give a
              server: directory: dir before include: file statements then those includes can be relative to  the
              working directory.

       <b>logfile:</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              If  ""  is given, logging goes to stderr, or nowhere once daemonized.  The logfile is appended to,
              in the following format:
              [seconds since 1970] unbound[pid:tid]: type: message.
              If this option is given, the use-syslog is option is set to "no".  The logfile  is  reopened  (for
              append) when the config file is reread, on SIGHUP.

       <b>use-syslog:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Sets Unbound to send log messages to the syslogd, using <u><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></u>(3).  The log facility LOG_DAEMON is
              used,  with  identity  "unbound".  The logfile setting is overridden when use-syslog is turned on.
              The default is to log to syslog.

       <b>log-identity:</b> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>
              If "" is given (default), then the name of the executable, usually "unbound" is used to report  to
              the  log.   Enter a string to override it with that, which is useful on systems that run more than
              one instance  of  Unbound,  with  different  configurations,  so  that  the  logs  can  be  easily
              distinguished against.

       <b>log-time-ascii:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Sets  logfile lines to use a timestamp in UTC ascii. Default is no, which prints the seconds since
              1970 in brackets. No effect if using syslog, in that case syslog  formats  the  timestamp  printed
              into the log files.

       <b>log-time-iso:</b> &lt;yes or no&gt;
              Log time in ISO8601 format, if <b>log-time-ascii:</b> yes is also set.  Default is no.

       <b>log-queries:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Prints one line per query to the log, with the log timestamp and IP address, name, type and class.
              Default  is  no.   Note  that  it  takes  time  to  print  these  lines  which  makes  the  server
              (significantly) slower.  Odd (nonprintable) characters in names are printed as '?'.

       <b>log-replies:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Prints one line per reply to the log, with the log timestamp and IP address,  name,  type,  class,
              return  code,  time  to resolve, from cache and response size.  Default is no.  Note that it takes
              time to print these lines which makes  the  server  (significantly)  slower.   Odd  (nonprintable)
              characters in names are printed as '?'.

       <b>log-tag-queryreply:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Prints  the  word 'query' and 'reply' with log-queries and log-replies.  This makes filtering logs
              easier.  The default is off (for backwards compatibility).

       <b>log-destaddr:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Prints the destination address, port and type in the log-replies output.  This disambiguates  what
              type of traffic, eg. udp or tcp, and to what local port the traffic was sent to.

       <b>log-local-actions:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Print  log  lines  to  inform  about local zone actions.  These lines are like the local-zone type
              inform prints out, but they are also printed for the other types of local zones.

       <b>log-servfail:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Print log lines that say why queries return SERVFAIL  to  clients.   This  is  separate  from  the
              verbosity  debug  logs,  much smaller, and printed at the error level, not the info level of debug
              info from verbosity.

       <b>pidfile:</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              The process id is written to the file. Default is "/run/unbound.pid".  So,
              kill -HUP `cat /run/unbound.pid`
              triggers a reload,
              kill -TERM `cat /run/unbound.pid`
              gracefully terminates.

       <b>root-hints:</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              Read the root hints from this file. Default is nothing, using builtin hints for the IN class.  The
              file  has the format of zone files, with root nameserver names and addresses only. The default may
              become outdated, when servers change, therefore it is good practice to use a root-hints file.

       <b>hide-identity:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If enabled id.server and hostname.bind queries are refused.

       <b>identity:</b> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>
              Set the identity to report. If set to "",  the  default,  then  the  hostname  of  the  server  is
              returned.

       <b>hide-version:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If enabled version.server and version.bind queries are refused.

       <b>version:</b> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>
              Set the version to report. If set to "", the default, then the package version is returned.

       <b>hide-http-user-agent:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If  enabled  the  HTTP  header  User-Agent  is  not  set.  Use  with  caution  as  some  webserver
              configurations may reject HTTP  requests  lacking  this  header.   If  needed,  it  is  better  to
              explicitly set the <b>http-user-agent</b> below.

       <b>http-user-agent:</b> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>
              Set  the  HTTP  User-Agent  header for outgoing HTTP requests. If set to "", the default, then the
              package name and version are used.

       <b>nsid:</b> &lt;string&gt;
              Add the specified nsid to the EDNS section of the answer when queried with an  NSID  EDNS  enabled
              packet.  As a sequence of hex characters or with ascii_ prefix and then an ascii string.

       <b>hide-trustanchor:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If enabled trustanchor.unbound queries are refused.

       <b>target-fetch-policy:</b> <u>&lt;"list</u> <u>of</u> <u>numbers"&gt;</u>
              Set  the  target  fetch  policy  used by Unbound to determine if it should fetch nameserver target
              addresses opportunistically. The policy is described per dependency depth.

              The number of values determines the maximum dependency depth that Unbound will pursue in answering
              a query.  A value of -1 means to fetch all targets opportunistically for that dependency depth.  A
              value  of  0  means  to  fetch  on  demand  only.  A  positive  value  fetches  that  many targets
              opportunistically.

              Enclose the list between quotes ("") and put spaces between numbers.  The default is "3 2 1 0  0".
              Setting  all zeroes, "0 0 0 0 0" gives behaviour closer to that of BIND 9, while setting "-1 -1 -1
              -1 -1" gives behaviour rumoured to be closer to that of BIND 8.

       <b>harden-short-bufsize:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Very small EDNS buffer sizes from queries  are  ignored.  Default  is  on,  as  described  in  the
              standard.

       <b>harden-large-queries:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Very large queries are ignored. Default is off, since it is legal protocol wise to send these, and
              could be necessary for operation if TSIG or EDNS payload is very large.

       <b>harden-glue:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Will trust glue only if it is within the servers authority. Default is yes.

       <b>harden-unverified-glue:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Will  trust  only  in-zone  glue.  Will  try  to  resolve all out of zone (<u>&lt;unverfied&gt;)</u> <u>glue.</u> <u>Will</u>
              <u>fallback</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>original</u> <u>glue</u> <u>if</u> <u>unable</u> <u>to</u> <u>resolve.</u>  <u>Default</u> <u>is</u> <u>no.</u>

       <b>harden-dnssec-stripped:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Require DNSSEC data for trust-anchored zones, if such data is absent, the zone becomes  bogus.  If
              turned  off,  and no DNSSEC data is received (or the DNSKEY data fails to validate), then the zone
              is made insecure, this behaves like there is no trust anchor. You could turn this off if  you  are
              sometimes  behind an intrusive firewall (of some sort) that removes DNSSEC data from packets, or a
              zone changes from signed to unsigned to badly signed often. If turned off you run the  risk  of  a
              downgrade attack that disables security for a zone. Default is yes.

       <b>harden-below-nxdomain:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              From  RFC  8020  (with  title "NXDOMAIN: There Really Is Nothing Underneath"), returns nxdomain to
              queries for a name below another name that is already  known  to  be  nxdomain.   DNSSEC  mandates
              noerror  for  empty nonterminals, hence this is possible.  Very old software might return nxdomain
              for empty nonterminals (that usually happen for reverse IP  address  lookups),  and  thus  may  be
              incompatible  with  this.  To try to avoid this only DNSSEC-secure nxdomains are used, because the
              old software does not have DNSSEC.  Default is yes.  The nxdomain must be secure, this means nsec3
              with optout is insufficient.

       <b>harden-referral-path:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Harden the referral path by performing additional queries for infrastructure data.  Validates  the
              replies if trust anchors are configured and the zones are signed.  This enforces DNSSEC validation
              on  nameserver  NS  sets and the nameserver addresses that are encountered on the referral path to
              the answer.  Default no, because it burdens the authority servers, and it is not RFC standard, and
              could  lead  to  performance  problems  because  of  the  extra  query  load  that  is  generated.
              Experimental  option.  If you enable it consider adding more numbers after the target-fetch-policy
              to increase the max depth that is checked to.

       <b>harden-algo-downgrade:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Harden against algorithm downgrade when multiple algorithms are advertised in the DS  record.   If
              no,  allows the weakest algorithm to validate the zone.  Default is no.  Zone signers must produce
              zones that allow this feature to work, but sometimes they do not,  and  turning  this  option  off
              avoids that validation failure.

       <b>harden-unknown-additional:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Harden  against unknown records in the authority section and additional section. Default is no. If
              no, such records are copied from the upstream and  presented  to  the  client  together  with  the
              answer. If yes, it could hamper future protocol developments that want to add records.

       <b>use-caps-for-id:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Use 0x20-encoded random bits in the query to foil spoof attempts.  This perturbs the lowercase and
              uppercase  of  query names sent to authority servers and checks if the reply still has the correct
              casing.  Disabled by default.  This feature is an experimental implementation of draft dns-0x20.

       <b>caps-exempt:</b> <u>&lt;domain&gt;</u>
              Exempt the domain so that it does not receive caps-for-id perturbed queries.  For domains that  do
              not  support  0x20  and  also fail with fallback because they keep sending different answers, like
              some load balancers.  Can be given multiple times, for different domains.

       <b>caps-whitelist:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Alternate syntax for <b>caps-exempt</b>.

       <b>qname-minimisation:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Send minimum amount of information to upstream servers to  enhance  privacy.   Only  send  minimum
              required  labels  of  the QNAME and set QTYPE to A when possible. Best effort approach; full QNAME
              and original QTYPE will be sent when upstream replies with a RCODE other than NOERROR, except when
              receiving NXDOMAIN from a DNSSEC signed zone. Default is yes.

       <b>qname-minimisation-strict:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              QNAME minimisation in strict mode. Do not fall-back to sending full QNAME  to  potentially  broken
              nameservers.  A lot of domains will not be resolvable when this option in enabled. Only use if you
              know what you are doing.  This option only has effect when qname-minimisation is enabled.  Default
              is no.

       <b>aggressive-nsec:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Aggressive  NSEC  uses  the  DNSSEC  NSEC  chain  to  synthesize NXDOMAIN and other denials, using
              information from previous NXDOMAINs answers.  Default is yes.  It helps to reduce the  query  rate
              towards targets that get a very high nonexistent name lookup rate.

       <b>private-address:</b> <u>&lt;IP</u> <u>address</u> <u>or</u> <u>subnet&gt;</u>
              Give IPv4 of IPv6 addresses or classless subnets. These are addresses on your private network, and
              are  not  allowed  to be returned for public internet names.  Any occurrence of such addresses are
              removed from DNS answers. Additionally, the DNSSEC validator may  mark  the  answers  bogus.  This
              protects  against  so-called  DNS  Rebinding, where a user browser is turned into a network proxy,
              allowing remote access through the browser to other parts of your private network.  Some names can
              be allowed to contain your private addresses, by default all the <b>local-data</b> that you configured is
              allowed to, and you can specify additional names using <b>private-domain</b>.  No private  addresses  are
              enabled  by  default.   We  consider  to  enable  this for the RFC1918 private IP address space by
              default in later releases. That  would  enable  private  addresses  for  10.0.0.0/8  172.16.0.0/12
              192.168.0.0/16  169.254.0.0/16 fd00::/8 and fe80::/10, since the RFC standards say these addresses
              should not be  visible  on  the  public  internet.   Turning  on  127.0.0.0/8  would  hinder  many
              spamblocklists  as  they  use  that.   Adding  ::ffff:0:0/96 stops IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses from
              bypassing the filter.

       <b>private-domain:</b> <u>&lt;domain</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              Allow this domain, and all its subdomains to contain private addresses.  Give  multiple  times  to
              allow multiple domain names to contain private addresses. Default is none.

       <b>unwanted-reply-threshold:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              If  set, a total number of unwanted replies is kept track of in every thread.  When it reaches the
              threshold, a defensive action is taken and a warning is printed to the log.  The defensive  action
              is  to  clear  the  rrset  and  message caches, hopefully flushing away any poison.  A value of 10
              million is suggested.  Default is 0 (turned off).

       <b>do-not-query-address:</b> <u>&lt;IP</u> <u>address&gt;</u>
              Do not query the given IP address. Can be  IP4  or  IP6.  Append  /num  to  indicate  a  classless
              delegation netblock, for example like 10.2.3.4/24 or 2001::11/64.

       <b>do-not-query-localhost:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If  yes, localhost is added to the do-not-query-address entries, both IP6 ::1 and IP4 127.0.0.1/8.
              If no, then localhost can be used to send queries to. Default is yes.

       <b>prefetch:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If yes, cache hits on message cache elements that are on their last 10 percent of their TTL  value
              trigger  a  prefetch  to  keep the cache up to date.  Default is no.  Turning it on gives about 10
              percent more traffic and load on the machine, but popular items do not expire from the cache.

       <b>prefetch-key:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If yes, fetch the DNSKEYs earlier in the validation process, when  a  DS  record  is  encountered.
              This  lowers the latency of requests.  It does use a little more CPU.  Also if the cache is set to
              0, it is no use. Default is no.

       <b>deny-any:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If yes, deny queries of type ANY with an empty response.  Default is  no.   If  disabled,  Unbound
              responds  with  a  short  list of resource records if some can be found in the cache and makes the
              upstream type ANY query if there are none.

       <b>rrset-roundrobin:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If yes, Unbound rotates RRSet order in response (the random number is taken from the query ID, for
              speed and thread safety).  Default is yes.

       <b>minimal-responses:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If yes, Unbound does not insert authority/additional sections into response  messages  when  those
              sections  are  not required.  This reduces response size significantly, and may avoid TCP fallback
              for some responses which may cause a slight speedup.  The default is  yes,  even  though  the  DNS
              protocol RFCs mandate these sections, and the additional content could save roundtrips for clients
              that  use  the  additional  content.  However these sections are hardly used by clients.  Enabling
              prefetch can benefit clients that need the additional content by trying to keep that content fresh
              in the cache.

       <b>disable-dnssec-lame-check:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If true, disables the DNSSEC lameness check in the  iterator.   This  check  sees  if  RRSIGs  are
              present  in  the  answer,  when  dnssec  is  expected, and retries another authority if RRSIGs are
              unexpectedly missing.  The validator will insist in RRSIGs for DNSSEC signed domains regardless of
              this setting, if a trust anchor is loaded.

       <b>module-config:</b> <u>&lt;"module</u> <u>names"&gt;</u>
              Module configuration, a list of module names separated by spaces, surround the string with  quotes
              ("").  The  modules can be <u>respip</u>, <u>validator</u>, or <u>iterator</u> (and possibly more, see below).  Setting
              this to just "<u>iterator</u>" will result in  a  non-validating  server.   Setting  this  to  "<u>validator</u>
              <u>iterator</u>"  will  turn on DNSSEC validation.  The ordering of the modules is significant, the order
              decides the order of processing.  You must also set <u>trust-anchors</u> for  validation  to  be  useful.
              Adding  <u>respip</u>  to  the front will cause RPZ processing to be done on all queries.  The default is
              "<u>validator</u> <u>iterator</u>".

              When the server is built with EDNS client subnet support the  default  is  "<u>subnetcache</u>  <u>validator</u>
              <u>iterator</u>".   Most  modules  that  need to be listed here have to be listed at the beginning of the
              line.  The subnetcachedb module has to be listed just before the iterator.  The python module  can
              be  listed  in different places, it then processes the output of the module it is just before. The
              dynlib module can be listed pretty much anywhere, it is only  a  very  thin  wrapper  that  allows
              dynamic libraries to run in its place.

       <b>trust-anchor-file:</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              File  with  trusted  keys  for  validation. Both DS and DNSKEY entries can appear in the file. The
              format of the file is the standard DNS Zone file format.  Default is "", or no trust anchor file.

       <b>auto-trust-anchor-file:</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              File with trust anchor for one zone, which is tracked with RFC5011 probes.   The  probes  are  run
              several  times per month, thus the machine must be online frequently.  The initial file can be one
              with contents as described in <b>trust-anchor-file</b>.  The file  is  written  to  when  the  anchor  is
              updated,  so  the Unbound user must have write permission.  Write permission to the file, but also
              to the directory it is in (to create a temporary file, which is necessary to deal with  filesystem
              full events), it must also be inside the chroot (if that is used).

       <b>trust-anchor:</b> <u>&lt;"Resource</u> <u>Record"&gt;</u>
              A  DS  or  DNSKEY  RR  for  a  key to use for validation. Multiple entries can be given to specify
              multiple trusted keys, in addition to the trust-anchor-files.  The resource record is  entered  in
              the same format as 'dig' or 'drill' prints them, the same format as in the zone file. Has to be on
              a  single  line,  with  ""  around  it.  A  TTL can be specified for ease of cut and paste, but is
              ignored.  A class can be specified, but class IN is default.

       <b>trusted-keys-file:</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              File with trusted keys for validation. Specify more than one file with several entries,  one  file
              per  entry. Like <b>trust-anchor-file</b> but has a different file format. Format is BIND-9 style format,
              the trusted-keys { name flag proto algo "key"; };  clauses  are  read.   It  is  possible  to  use
              wildcards with this statement, the wildcard is expanded on start and on reload.

       <b>trust-anchor-signaling:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Send RFC8145 key tag query after trust anchor priming. Default is yes.

       <b>root-key-sentinel:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Root key trust anchor sentinel. Default is yes.

       <b>domain-insecure:</b> <u>&lt;domain</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              Sets  domain  name to be insecure, DNSSEC chain of trust is ignored towards the domain name.  So a
              trust anchor above the domain name can not make the domain secure with a  DS  record,  such  a  DS
              record  is then ignored.  Can be given multiple times to specify multiple domains that are treated
              as if unsigned.  If you set trust anchors for the domain  they  override  this  setting  (and  the
              domain is secured).

              This can be useful if you want to make sure a trust anchor for external lookups does not affect an
              (unsigned)  internal  domain.   A  DS  record  externally  can create validation failures for that
              internal domain.

       <b>val-override-date:</b> <u>&lt;rrsig-style</u> <u>date</u> <u>spec&gt;</u>
              Default is "" or "0", which disables this debugging feature. If enabled by giving  a  RRSIG  style
              date, that date is used for verifying RRSIG inception and expiration dates, instead of the current
              date.  Do  not  set this unless you are debugging signature inception and expiration. The value -1
              ignores the date altogether, useful for some special applications.

       <b>val-sig-skew-min:</b> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              Minimum number of seconds of clock skew to apply to validated signatures.  A value of 10%  of  the
              signature  lifetime  (expiration - inception) is used, capped by this setting.  Default is 3600 (1
              hour) which allows for daylight savings differences.  Lower this value for more strict checking of
              short lived signatures.

       <b>val-sig-skew-max:</b> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              Maximum number of seconds of clock skew to apply to validated signatures.  A value of 10%  of  the
              signature lifetime (expiration - inception) is used, capped by this setting.  Default is 86400 (24
              hours)  which  allows  for  timezone setting problems in stable domains.  Setting both min and max
              very low disables the clock skew allowances.  Setting  both  min  and  max  very  high  makes  the
              validator check the signature timestamps less strictly.

       <b>val-max-restart:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              The  maximum  number  the  validator  should  restart validation with another authority in case of
              failed validation. Default is 5.

       <b>val-bogus-ttl:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              The time to live for bogus data.  This  is  data  that  has  failed  validation;  due  to  invalid
              signatures  or  other  checks.  The  TTL  from that data cannot be trusted, and this value is used
              instead. The value is in seconds, default 60.  The time interval prevents repeated revalidation of
              bogus data.

       <b>val-clean-additional:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Instruct the validator to remove data from the additional section of secure messages that are  not
              signed  properly.  Messages that are insecure, bogus, indeterminate or unchecked are not affected.
              Default is yes.  Use  this  setting  to  protect  the  users  that  rely  on  this  validator  for
              authentication from potentially bad data in the additional section.

       <b>val-log-level:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Have  the  validator  print  validation failures to the log.  Regardless of the verbosity setting.
              Default is 0, off.  At 1, for every user query that fails a line is printed to the logs.  This way
              you can monitor what happens with validation.  Use a diagnosis tool, such as dig or drill, to find
              out why validation is failing for these queries.  At 2, not only the query that failed is  printed
              but also the reason why Unbound thought it was wrong and which server sent the faulty data.

       <b>val-permissive-mode:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Instruct the validator to mark bogus messages as indeterminate. The security checks are performed,
              but  if  the  result  is  bogus  (failed security), the reply is not withheld from the client with
              SERVFAIL as usual. The client receives the bogus data. For messages that are found  to  be  secure
              the AD bit is set in replies. Also logging is performed as for full validation.  The default value
              is "no".

       <b>ignore-cd-flag:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Instruct  Unbound  to  ignore the CD flag from clients and refuse to return bogus answers to them.
              Thus, the CD (Checking Disabled) flag does not disable checking  any  more.   This  is  useful  if
              legacy (w2008) servers that set the CD flag but cannot validate DNSSEC themselves are the clients,
              and then Unbound provides them with DNSSEC protection.  The default value is "no".

       <b>disable-edns-do:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Disable the EDNS DO flag in upstream requests.  It breaks DNSSEC validation for Unbound's clients.
              This results in the upstream name servers to not include DNSSEC records in their replies and could
              be helpful for devices that cannot handle DNSSEC information.  When the option is enabled, clients
              that  set  the  DO  flag receive no EDNS record in the response to indicate the lack of support to
              them.  If this option is enabled but Unbound is already configured for  DNSSEC  validation  (i.e.,
              the  validator  module is enabled; default) this option is implicitly turned off with a warning as
              to not break DNSSEC validation in Unbound.  Default is no.

       <b>serve-expired:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If  enabled,  Unbound  attempts  to   serve   old   responses   from   cache   with   a   TTL   of
              <b>serve-expired-reply-ttl</b>  in the response without waiting for the actual resolution to finish.  The
              actual resolution answer ends up in the cache later on.  Default is "no".

       <b>serve-expired-ttl:</b> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              Limit serving of expired responses to configured seconds after expiration. 0 disables  the  limit.
              This option only applies when <b>serve-expired</b> is enabled.  A suggested value per RFC 8767 is between
              86400 (1 day) and 259200 (3 days).  The default is 0.

       <b>serve-expired-ttl-reset:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Set  the  TTL of expired records to the <b>serve-expired-ttl</b> value after a failed attempt to retrieve
              the record from upstream.  This makes sure that the expired records will  be  served  as  long  as
              there are queries for it.  Default is "no".

       <b>serve-expired-reply-ttl:</b> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              TTL  value  to  use when replying with expired data.  If <b>serve-expired-client-timeout</b> is also used
              then it is RECOMMENDED to use 30 as the value (RFC 8767).  The default is 30.

       <b>serve-expired-client-timeout:</b> <u>&lt;msec&gt;</u>
              Time in milliseconds before replying to the client with expired data.   This  essentially  enables
              the  serve-stale  behavior as specified in RFC 8767 that first tries to resolve before immediately
              responding with expired data.  A recommended value per RFC 8767 is 1800.  Setting this to  0  will
              disable this behavior.  Default is 0.

       <b>serve-original-ttl:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If  enabled, Unbound will always return the original TTL as received from the upstream name server
              rather than the decrementing TTL as stored in the cache.  This feature may be  useful  if  Unbound
              serves as a front-end to a hidden authoritative name server. Enabling this feature does not impact
              cache  expiry,  it only changes the TTL Unbound embeds in responses to queries. Note that enabling
              this feature implicitly disables enforcement of the configured minimum and maximum TTL, as  it  is
              assumed  users  who  enable  this  feature  do not want Unbound to change the TTL obtained from an
              upstream server.  Thus, the values set using <b>cache-min-ttl</b> and <b>cache-max-ttl</b> are ignored.  Default
              is "no".

       <b>val-nsec3-keysize-iterations:</b> <u>&lt;"list</u> <u>of</u> <u>values"&gt;</u>
              List of keysize and iteration count values, separated by spaces, surrounded by quotes. Default  is
              "1024  150  2048 150 4096 150". This determines the maximum allowed NSEC3 iteration count before a
              message is simply marked insecure instead of performing the many hashing iterations. The list must
              be in ascending order and have at least one entry. If you set it  to  "1024  65535"  there  is  no
              restriction  to  NSEC3  iteration  values.   This table must be kept short; a very long list could
              cause slower operation.

       <b>zonemd-permissive-mode:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If enabled the ZONEMD verification failures are only logged and  do  not  cause  the  zone  to  be
              blocked  and  only  return  servfail.  Useful for testing out if it works, or if the operator only
              wants to be notified of a problem without disrupting service.  Default is no.

       <b>add-holddown:</b> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              Instruct the <b>auto-trust-anchor-file</b> probe mechanism for RFC5011 autotrust updates to add new trust
              anchors only after they have been visible for this time.  Default is 30 days as per the RFC.

       <b>del-holddown:</b> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              Instruct the <b>auto-trust-anchor-file</b> probe  mechanism  for  RFC5011  autotrust  updates  to  remove
              revoked  trust anchors after they have been kept in the revoked list for this long.  Default is 30
              days as per the RFC.

       <b>keep-missing:</b> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              Instruct the <b>auto-trust-anchor-file</b> probe  mechanism  for  RFC5011  autotrust  updates  to  remove
              missing trust anchors after they have been unseen for this long.  This cleans up the state file if
              the  target  zone does not perform trust anchor revocation, so this makes the auto probe mechanism
              work with zones that perform regular (non-5011) rollovers.  The default is 366 days.  The value  0
              does not remove missing anchors, as per the RFC.

       <b>permit-small-holddown:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Debug  option that allows the autotrust 5011 rollover timers to assume very small values.  Default
              is no.

       <b>key-cache-size:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Number of bytes size of the key cache. Default is 4 megabytes.  A plain number is in bytes, append
              'k', 'm' or 'g' for kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes (1024*1024 bytes in a megabyte).

       <b>key-cache-slabs:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Number of slabs in the key cache. Slabs reduce lock contention by threads.  Must be set to a power
              of 2. Setting (close) to the number of cpus is a reasonable guess.

       <b>neg-cache-size:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Number of bytes size of the aggressive negative cache. Default is 1 megabyte.  A plain  number  is
              in  bytes,  append  'k',  'm'  or  'g' for kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes (1024*1024 bytes in a
              megabyte).

       <b>unblock-lan-zones:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Default is disabled.  If enabled, then for private address  space,  the  reverse  lookups  are  no
              longer  filtered.   This  allows  Unbound  when running as dns service on a host where it provides
              service for that host, to put out all of the queries for the 'lan' upstream.  When  enabled,  only
              localhost,  127.0.0.1  reverse  and  ::1  reverse  zones  are configured with default local zones.
              Disable the option when Unbound is running as a (DHCP-)  DNS  network  resolver  for  a  group  of
              machines,  where  such lookups should be filtered (RFC compliance), this also stops potential data
              leakage about the local network to the upstream DNS servers.

       <b>insecure-lan-zones:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Default is disabled.  If enabled, then reverse lookups in private address space are not validated.
              This is usually required whenever <u>unblock-lan-zones</u> is used.

       <b>local-zone:</b> <u>&lt;zone&gt;</u> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              Configure a local zone. The type determines  the  answer  to  give  if  there  is  no  match  from
              local-data. The types are deny, refuse, static, transparent, redirect, nodefault, typetransparent,
              inform, inform_deny, inform_redirect, always_transparent, block_a, always_refuse, always_nxdomain,
              always_null,  noview,  and  are  explained  below. After that the default settings are listed. Use
              local-data: to enter data into the local zone. Answers  for  local  zones  are  authoritative  DNS
              answers. By default the zones are class IN.

              If  you  need more complicated authoritative data, with referrals, wildcards, CNAME/DNAME support,
              or DNSSEC authoritative service, setup a stub-zone for it as detailed in  the  stub  zone  section
              below.  A  stub-zone  can be used to have unbound send queries to another server, an authoritative
              server, to fetch the information. With a forward-zone, unbound sends queries to a server that is a
              recursive server to fetch the information. With an auth-zone a zone can be loaded  from  file  and
              used,  it  can be used like a local-zone for users downstream, or the auth-zone information can be
              used to fetch information from when resolving like it is an upstream server. The forward-zone  and
              auth-zone  options are described in their sections below.  If you want to perform filtering of the
              information that the users can fetch, the local-zone and local-data statements allow for this, but
              also the rpz functionality can be used, described in the RPZ section.

            <u>deny</u> Do not send an answer, drop the query.  If there is a match  from  local  data,  the  query  is
                 answered.

            <u>refuse</u>
                 Send  an  error  message  reply,  with rcode REFUSED.  If there is a match from local data, the
                 query is answered.

            <u>static</u>
                 If there is a match from local data, the query is answered.  Otherwise, the query  is  answered
                 with  nodata  or nxdomain.  For a negative answer a SOA is included in the answer if present as
                 local-data for the zone apex domain.

            <u>transparent</u>
                 If there is a match from local data, the query is answered.   Otherwise  if  the  query  has  a
                 different  name, the query is resolved normally.  If the query is for a name given in localdata
                 but no such type of data is given in localdata, then a noerror nodata answer is  returned.   If
                 no local-zone is given local-data causes a transparent zone to be created by default.

            <u>typetransparent</u>
                 If  there  is  a match from local data, the query is answered.  If the query is for a different
                 name, or for the same name but for a different type,  the  query  is  resolved  normally.   So,
                 similar to transparent but types that are not listed in local data are resolved normally, so if
                 an A record is in the local data that does not cause a nodata reply for AAAA queries.

            <u>redirect</u>
                 The  query  is  answered  from  the  local  data for the zone name.  There may be no local data
                 beneath the zone name.  This answers queries for the zone, and all subdomains of the zone  with
                 the local data for the zone.  It can be used to redirect a domain to return a different address
                 record  to the end user, with local-zone: "example.com." redirect and local-data: "example.com.
                 A 127.0.0.1" queries for www.example.com and www.foo.example.com are redirected, so that  users
                 with web browsers cannot access sites with suffix example.com.

            <u>inform</u>
                 The  query  is  answered normally, same as transparent.  The client IP address (@portnumber) is
                 printed to the logfile.  The log message is:  timestamp,  unbound-pid,  info:  zonename  inform
                 IP@port  queryname  type  class.   This  option can be used for normal resolution, but machines
                 looking up infected names are logged, eg. to run antivirus on them.

            <u>inform_deny</u>
                 The query is dropped, like 'deny', and logged,  like  'inform'.   Ie.  find  infected  machines
                 without answering the queries.

            <u>inform_redirect</u>
                 The  query  is redirected, like 'redirect', and logged, like 'inform'.  Ie. answer queries with
                 fixed data and also log the machines that ask.

            <u>always_transparent</u>
                 Like transparent, but ignores local data and resolves normally.

            <u>block_a</u>
                 Like transparent, but ignores local data and resolves normally all query types excluding A. For
                 A queries it unconditionally returns  NODATA.   Useful  in  cases  when  there  is  a  need  to
                 explicitly force all apps to use IPv6 protocol and avoid any queries to IPv4.

            <u>always_refuse</u>
                 Like refuse, but ignores local data and refuses the query.

            <u>always_nxdomain</u>
                 Like static, but ignores local data and returns nxdomain for the query.

            <u>always_nodata</u>
                 Like static, but ignores local data and returns nodata for the query.

            <u>always_deny</u>
                 Like deny, but ignores local data and drops the query.

            <u>always_null</u>
                 Always  returns  0.0.0.0 or ::0 for every name in the zone.  Like redirect with zero data for A
                 and AAAA.  Ignores local data in the zone.  Used for some block lists.

            <u>noview</u>
                 Breaks out of that view and moves towards the global local zones for answer to the  query.   If
                 the  view  first  is no, it'll resolve normally.  If view first is enabled, it'll break perform
                 that step and check the global answers.  For when the view has view specific overrides but some
                 zone has to be answered from global local zone contents.

            <u>nodefault</u>
                 Used to turn off default contents for AS112 zones.  The  other  types  also  turn  off  default
                 contents  for  the  zone.  The  'nodefault' option has no other effect than turning off default
                 contents for the given zone.  Use <u>nodefault</u> if you use exactly that zone, if you want to use  a
                 subzone, use <u>transparent</u>.

       The  default  zones are localhost, reverse 127.0.0.1 and ::1, the home.arpa, the onion, test, invalid and
       the AS112 zones. The AS112 zones are reverse DNS zones for private use  and  reserved  IP  addresses  for
       which  the servers on the internet cannot provide correct answers. They are configured by default to give
       nxdomain (no reverse information) answers. The  defaults  can  be  turned  off  by  specifying  your  own
       local-zone of that name, or using the 'nodefault' type. Below is a list of the default zone contents.

            <u>localhost</u>
                 The  IP4  and  IP6  localhost  information  is  given.  NS  and  SOA  records  are provided for

                 Reverse data for zone 8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa. This zone is used for tutorials  and  examples.
                 You can remove the block on this zone with:
                   local-zone: 8.B.D.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa. nodefault
                 You  can  also  selectively  unblock  a part of the zone by making that part transparent with a
                 local-zone statement.  This also works with the other default zones.

       <b>local-data:</b> <u>"&lt;resource</u> <u>record</u> <u>string&gt;"</u>
            Configure local data, which is served in reply to queries for it.  The query has  to  match  exactly
            unless  you  configure  the  local-zone  as  redirect.  If  not matched exactly, the local-zone type
            determines further processing. If local-data is configured that is not a subdomain of a  local-zone,
            a  transparent  local-zone  is  configured.   For record types such as TXT, use single quotes, as in
            local-data: 'example. TXT "text"'.

            If you need more complicated authoritative data, with referrals, wildcards, CNAME/DNAME support,  or
            DNSSEC authoritative service, setup a stub-zone for it as detailed in the stub zone section below.

       <b>local-data-ptr:</b> <u>"IPaddr</u> <u>name"</u>
            Configure  local data shorthand for a PTR record with the reversed IPv4 or IPv6 address and the host
            name.  For example "192.0.2.4 www.example.com".  TTL can be inserted like  this:  "2001:DB8::4  7200
            www.example.com"

       <b>local-zone-tag:</b> <u>&lt;zone&gt;</u> <u>&lt;"list</u> <u>of</u> <u>tags"&gt;</u>
            Assign  tags  to  localzones.  Tagged  localzones  will only be applied when the used access-control
            element has a matching tag. Tags must be defined in <u>define-tags</u>.  Enclose list  of  tags  in  quotes
            ("") and put spaces between tags.  When there are multiple tags it checks if the intersection of the
            list of tags for the query and local-zone-tag is non-empty.

       <b>local-zone-override:</b> <u>&lt;zone&gt;</u> <u>&lt;IP</u> <u>netblock&gt;</u> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
            Override  the localzone type for queries from addresses matching netblock.  Use this localzone type,
            regardless the type configured for the local-zone (both tagged and untagged) and regardless the type
            configured using access-control-tag-action.

       <b>response-ip:</b> <u>&lt;IP-netblock&gt;</u> <u>&lt;action&gt;</u>
            This requires use of the "respip" module.

            If the IP address in an AAAA or A RR in the answer section of a response matches  the  specified  IP
            netblock,  the  specified  action will apply.  <u>&lt;action&gt;</u> has generally the same semantics as that for
            <u>access-control-tag-action</u>, but there are some exceptions.

            Actions for <u>response-ip</u> are different from those for <u>local-zone</u> in that in case of the former  there
            is  no  point  of  such conditions as "the query matches it but there is no local data".  Because of
            this difference, the semantics of <u>response-ip</u> actions are modified or  simplified  as  follows:  The
            <u>static,</u>  <u>refuse,</u>  <u>transparent,</u>  <u>typetransparent,</u>  and <u>nodefault</u> actions are invalid for <u>response-ip</u>.
            Using any of these will cause the configuration to be rejected as faulty. The <u>deny</u>  action  is  non-
            conditional,  i.e.  it  always  results  in dropping the corresponding query.  The resolution result
            before applying the deny action is still cached and can be used for other queries.

       <b>response-ip-data:</b> <u>&lt;IP-netblock&gt;</u> <u>&lt;"resource</u> <u>record</u> <u>string"&gt;</u>
            This requires use of the "respip" module.

            This specifies the action data for <u>response-ip</u>  with  action  being  to  redirect  as  specified  by
            "<u>resource</u> <u>record</u> <u>string</u>".  "Resource record string" is similar to that of <u>access-control-tag-action</u>,
            but  it  must  be  of either AAAA, A or CNAME types.  If the IP-netblock is an IPv6/IPv4 prefix, the
            record must be AAAA/A respectively, unless it is a CNAME (which can be used for both versions of  IP
            netblocks).   If  it  is  CNAME  there  must  not be more than one <u>response-ip-data</u> for the same IP-
            netblock.  Also, CNAME and other types of  records  must  not  coexist  for  the  same  IP-netblock,
            following  the  normal rules for CNAME records.  The textual domain name for the CNAME does not have
            to be explicitly terminated with a dot ("."); the root name is assumed to  be  the  origin  for  the
            name.

       <b>response-ip-tag:</b> <u>&lt;IP-netblock&gt;</u> <u>&lt;"list</u> <u>of</u> <u>tags"&gt;</u>
            This requires use of the "respip" module.

            Assign tags to response IP-netblocks.  If the IP address in an AAAA or A RR in the answer section of
            a  response  matches  the  specified IP-netblock, the specified tags are assigned to the IP address.
            Then, if an <u>access-control-tag</u> is defined for the client and it includes one of  the  tags  for  the
            response  IP, the corresponding <u>access-control-tag-action</u> will apply.  Tag matching rule is the same
            as that for <u>access-control-tag</u> and  <u>local-zones</u>.   Unlike  <u>local-zone-tag</u>,  <u>response-ip-tag</u>  can  be
            defined  for  an  IP-netblock  even  if  no  <u>response-ip</u>  is defined for that netblock.  If multiple
            <u>response-ip-tag</u> options are specified for the same IP-netblock in different statements, all but  the
            first  will  be ignored.  However, this will not be flagged as a configuration error, but the result
            is probably not what was intended.

            Actions specified in an <u>access-control-tag-action</u> that has a matching tag with  <u>response-ip-tag</u>  can
            be  those  that  are "invalid" for <u>response-ip</u> listed above, since <u>access-control-tag-action</u>s can be
            shared with local zones.  For these actions, if they behave differently depending on  whether  local
            data  exists  or not in case of local zones, the behavior for <u>response-ip-data</u> will generally result
            in NOERROR/NODATA instead of NXDOMAIN, since the <u>response-ip</u> data are inherently type specific,  and
            non-existence  of  data does not indicate anything about the existence or non-existence of the qname
            itself.  For example, if  the  matching  tag  action  is  <u>static</u>  but  there  is  no  data  for  the
            corresponding  <u>response-ip</u>  configuration,  then  the  result will be NOERROR/NODATA.  The only case
            where NXDOMAIN is returned is when an <u>always_nxdomain</u> action applies.

       <b>ratelimit:</b> <u>&lt;number</u> <u>or</u> <u>0&gt;</u>
            Enable ratelimiting of queries sent to nameserver for performing recursion.  If 0, the  default,  it
            is disabled.  This option is experimental at this time.  The ratelimit is in queries per second that
            are  allowed.   More queries are turned away with an error (servfail).  This stops recursive floods,
            eg. random query names, but not spoofed reflection floods.  Cached responses are not ratelimited  by
            this  setting.   The  zone  of the query is determined by examining the nameservers for it, the zone
            name is used to keep track of the rate.  For example, 1000 may be  a  suitable  value  to  stop  the
            server  from  being  overloaded  with  random  names,  and keeps Unbound from sending traffic to the
            nameservers for those zones.  Configured forwarders are excluded from ratelimiting.

       <b>ratelimit-size:</b> <u>&lt;memory</u> <u>size&gt;</u>
            Give the size of the data structure in which the current ongoing rates are kept track  in.   Default
            4m.   In  bytes  or  use  <a href="../manmega/m.mega.html">m</a>(mega), k(kilo), g(giga).  The ratelimit structure is small, so this data
            structure likely does not need to be large.

       <b>ratelimit-slabs:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
            Give power of 2 number of slabs, this is used to reduce lock contention in  the  ratelimit  tracking
            data structure.  Close to the number of cpus is a fairly good setting.

       <b>ratelimit-factor:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
            Set  the  amount  of queries to rate limit when the limit is exceeded.  If set to 0, all queries are
            dropped for domains where the limit is exceeded.  If set to another  value,  1  in  that  number  is
            allowed  through to complete.  Default is 10, allowing 1/10 traffic to flow normally.  This can make
            ordinary queries complete (if repeatedly queried for), and enter the cache, whilst  also  mitigating
            the traffic flow by the factor given.

       <b>ratelimit-backoff:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
            If  enabled,  the  ratelimit  is  treated  as  a hard failure instead of the default maximum allowed
            constant rate.  When the limit is reached, traffic is ratelimited and demand continues  to  be  kept
            track  of  for  a  2  second rate window.  No traffic is allowed, except for ratelimit-factor, until
            demand decreases below the configured ratelimit for a 2 second rate window.  Useful to set ratelimit
            to a suspicious rate to aggressively limit unusually high traffic.  Default is off.

       <b>ratelimit-for-domain:</b> <u>&lt;domain&gt;</u> <u>&lt;number</u> <u>qps</u> <u>or</u> <u>0&gt;</u>
            Override the global ratelimit for an exact match domain name with the listed number.  You  can  give
            this  for  any  number  of names.  For example, for a top-level-domain you may want to have a higher
            limit than other names.  A value of 0 will disable ratelimiting for that domain.

       <b>ratelimit-below-domain:</b> <u>&lt;domain&gt;</u> <u>&lt;number</u> <u>qps</u> <u>or</u> <u>0&gt;</u>
            Override the global ratelimit for a domain name that ends in this name.  You can give this  multiple
            times,  it  then  describes  different  settings  in  different parts of the namespace.  The closest
            matching suffix is used to determine the qps limit.  The rate for the exact matching domain name  is
            not  changed,  use  ratelimit-for-domain to set that, you might want to use different settings for a
            top-level-domain and subdomains.  A value of 0 will disable ratelimiting for domain names  that  end
            in this name.

       <b>ip-ratelimit:</b> <u>&lt;number</u> <u>or</u> <u>0&gt;</u>
            Enable  global ratelimiting of queries accepted per IP address.  This option is experimental at this
            time.  The ratelimit is in queries per second that are allowed.  More queries are completely dropped
            and will not receive a reply, SERVFAIL or otherwise.  IP ratelimiting happens before looking in  the
            cache.  This  may  be  useful for mitigating amplification attacks.  Clients with a valid DNS Cookie
            will bypass the ratelimit.  If a ratelimit for such clients is still needed, <b>ip-ratelimit-cookie</b> can
            be used instead.  Default is 0 (disabled).

       <b>ip-ratelimit-cookie:</b> <u>&lt;number</u> <u>or</u> <u>0&gt;</u>
            Enable global ratelimiting of queries accepted per IP address with a valid DNS Cookie.  This  option
            is  experimental  at  this  time.   The  ratelimit  is in queries per second that are allowed.  More
            queries are completely dropped and will not receive a reply, SERVFAIL or otherwise.  IP ratelimiting
            happens before looking in the cache.  This option could be useful in combination  with  <u>allow_cookie</u>
            in  an attempt to mitigate other amplification attacks than UDP reflections (e.g., attacks targeting
            Unbound itself) which are already handled with DNS Cookies.  If used, the value is suggested  to  be
            higher than <b>ip-ratelimit</b> e.g., tenfold.  Default is 0 (disabled).

       <b>ip-ratelimit-size:</b> <u>&lt;memory</u> <u>size&gt;</u>
            Give  the  size of the data structure in which the current ongoing rates are kept track in.  Default
            4m.  In bytes or use <a href="../manmega/m.mega.html">m</a>(mega), k(kilo), g(giga).  The ip ratelimit structure is small, so  this  data
            structure likely does not need to be large.

       <b>ip-ratelimit-slabs:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
            Give power of 2 number of slabs, this is used to reduce lock contention in the ip ratelimit tracking
            data structure.  Close to the number of cpus is a fairly good setting.

       <b>ip-ratelimit-factor:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
            Set  the  amount  of queries to rate limit when the limit is exceeded.  If set to 0, all queries are
            dropped for addresses where the limit is exceeded.  If set to another value, 1  in  that  number  is
            allowed  through to complete.  Default is 10, allowing 1/10 traffic to flow normally.  This can make
            ordinary queries complete (if repeatedly queried for), and enter the cache, whilst  also  mitigating
            the traffic flow by the factor given.

       <b>ip-ratelimit-backoff:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
            If  enabled,  the  ratelimit  is  treated  as  a hard failure instead of the default maximum allowed
            constant rate.  When the limit is reached, traffic is ratelimited and demand continues  to  be  kept
            track  of  for a 2 second rate window.  No traffic is allowed, except for ip-ratelimit-factor, until
            demand decreases below the configured  ratelimit  for  a  2  second  rate  window.   Useful  to  set
            ip-ratelimit to a suspicious rate to aggressively limit unusually high traffic.  Default is off.

       <b>outbound-msg-retry:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
            The  number of retries, per upstream nameserver in a delegation, that Unbound will attempt in case a
            throwaway response is received.  No response (timeout) contributes  to  the  retry  counter.   If  a
            forward/stub zone is used, this is the number of retries per nameserver in the zone.  Default is 5.

       <b>max-sent-count:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
            Hard  limit  on the number of outgoing queries Unbound will make while resolving a name, making sure
            large NS sets do not loop.  Results in SERVFAIL when reached.  It resets on  query  restarts  (e.g.,
            CNAME) and referrals.  Default is 32.

       <b>max-query-restarts:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
            Hard  limit  on  the number of times Unbound is allowed to restart a query upon encountering a CNAME
            record.  Results in SERVFAIL when reached.  Changing this value needs caution as it can  allow  long
            CNAME  chains  to  be  accepted,  where  Unbound  needs  to verify (resolve) each link individually.
            Default is 11.

       <b>iter-scrub-ns:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
            Limit on the number of NS records allowed in an rrset of type NS, from the iterator  scrubber.  This
            protects the internals of the resolver from overly large NS sets. Default is 20.

       <b>iter-scrub-cname:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
            Limit  on the number of CNAME, DNAME records in an answer, from the iterator scrubber. This protects
            the internals of the resolver from overly long indirection chains. Clips off the  remainder  of  the
            reply packet at that point.  Default is 11.

       <b>max-global-quota:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
            Limit  on  the  number  of  upstream  queries sent out for an incoming query and its subqueries from
            recursion. It is not reset during the resolution. When it is exceeded the query is  failed  and  the
            lookup process stops.  Default is 128.

       <b>fast-server-permil:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
            Specify  how  many  times  out of 1000 to pick from the set of fastest servers.  0 turns the feature
            off.  A value of 900 would pick from the fastest servers 90 percent of the time, and  would  perform
            normal  exploration  of  random  servers  for  the  remaining  time.  When  prefetch  is enabled (or
            serve-expired), such prefetches are not sped up, because there is no one  waiting  for  it,  and  it
            presents  a  good  moment  to  perform server exploration. The <b>fast-server-num</b> option can be used to
            specify the size of the fastest servers set. The default for fast-server-permil is 0.

       <b>fast-server-num:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
            Set the number of servers that should be used for  fast  server  selection.  Only  use  the  fastest
            specified  number  of  servers  with  the  fast-server-permil option, that turns this on or off. The
            default is to use the fastest 3 servers.

       <b>answer-cookie:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
            If enabled, Unbound will answer to requests containing DNS Cookies as specified in RFC 7873 and  RFC
            9018.  Default is no.

       <b>cookie-secret:</b> <u>&lt;128</u> <u>bit</u> <u>hex</u> <u>string&gt;</u>
            Server's  secret  for  DNS  Cookie  generation.   Useful to explicitly set for servers in an anycast
            deployment that need to share the secret in order to verify each other's Server Cookies.  An example
            hex string would be  "000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f".   Default  is  a  128  bits  random  secret
            generated at startup time.  This option is ignored if a <b>cookie-secret-file</b> is present.  In that case
            the secrets from that file are used in DNS Cookie calculations.

       <b>cookie-secret-file:</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
            File  from  which  the  secrets are read used in DNS Cookie calculations. When this file exists, the
            secrets in this file are used and the secret specified  by  the  <b>cookie-secret</b>  option  is  ignored.
            Enable  it  by  setting a filename, like "/usr/local/etc/unbound_cookiesecrets.txt".  The content of
            this   file   must   be   manipulated   with   the   <b>add_cookie_secret</b>,    <b>drop_cookie_secret</b>    and
            <b>activate_cookie_secret</b>  commands  to  the <u><a href="../man8/unbound-control.8.html">unbound-control</a></u>(8) tool. Please see that manpage on how to
            perform a safe cookie secret rollover.  Default is "" (disabled).

       <b>edns-client-string:</b> <u>&lt;IP</u> <u>netblock&gt;</u> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>
            Include an EDNS0 option containing configured ascii  string  in  queries  with  destination  address
            matching the configured IP netblock.  This configuration option can be used multiple times. The most
            specific match will be used.

       <b>edns-client-string-opcode:</b> <u>&lt;opcode&gt;</u>
            EDNS0  option  code  for the <u>edns-client-string</u> option, from 0 to 65535.  A value from the `Reserved
            for Local/Experimental` range (65001-65534) should be used.  Default is 65001.

       <b>ede:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
            If enabled, Unbound will respond with  Extended  DNS  Error  codes  (RFC8914).   These  EDEs  attach
            informative error messages to a response for various errors. Default is "no".

            When the <b>val-log-level</b> option is also set to <b>2</b>, responses with Extended DNS Errors concerning DNSSEC
            failures  that  are  not  served  from cache, will also contain a descriptive text message about the
            reason for the failure.

       <b>ede-serve-expired:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
            If enabled, Unbound will attach an Extended DNS Error (RFC8914) Code  3  -  Stale  Answer  as  EDNS0
            option  to  the  expired  response.  Note that this will not attach the EDE code without setting the
            global <b>ede</b> option to "yes" as well.  Default is "no".

   <b>Remote</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Options</b>
       In the <b>remote-control:</b> clause are the declarations for the remote control facility.  If this is  enabled,
       the  <u><a href="../man8/unbound-control.8.html">unbound-control</a></u>(8)  utility  can be used to send commands to the running Unbound server.  The server
       uses these clauses to setup TLSv1 security for the connection.  The <u><a href="../man8/unbound-control.8.html">unbound-control</a></u>(8) utility also reads
       the <b>remote-control</b>  section  for  options.   To  setup  the  correct  self-signed  certificates  use  the
       <u><a href="../man8/unbound-control-setup.8.html">unbound-control-setup</a></u>(8) utility.

       <b>control-enable:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
            The  option  is  used to enable remote control, default is "no".  If turned off, the server does not
            listen for control commands.

       <b>control-interface:</b> <u>&lt;ip</u> <u>address</u> <u>or</u> <u>interface</u> <u>name</u> <u>or</u> <u>path&gt;</u>
            Give IPv4 or IPv6 addresses or local socket path to listen on for control commands.  If an interface
            name is used instead of an ip address, the list of ip addresses on  that  interface  are  used.   By
            default  localhost  (127.0.0.1  and  ::1)  is  listened  to.   Use  0.0.0.0 and ::0 to listen to all
            interfaces.  If you change this and permissions have been dropped, you must restart the  server  for
            the change to take effect.

            If  you  set  it  to  an  absolute  path, a unix domain socket is used. This socket does not use the
            certificates and keys, so those files need  not  be  present.   To  restrict  access,  Unbound  sets
            permissions  on  the file to the user and group that is configured, the access bits are set to allow
            the group members to access the control socket file.  Put users that need to access  the  socket  in
            the  that  group.   To  restrict access further, create a directory to put the control socket in and
            restrict access to that directory.

       <b>control-port:</b> <u>&lt;port</u> <u>number&gt;</u>
            The port number to listen on for IPv4 or IPv6 control interfaces, default is 8953.   If  you  change
            this and permissions have been dropped, you must restart the server for the change to take effect.

       <b>control-use-cert:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
            For  localhost  control-interface  you  can  disable  the use of TLS by setting this option to "no",
            default is "yes".  For local sockets, TLS is disabled and the value of this option is ignored.

       <b>server-key-file:</b> <u>&lt;private</u> <u>key</u> <u>file&gt;</u>
            Path to the server private key, by default  unbound_server.key.   This  file  is  generated  by  the
            <u>unbound-control-setup</u> utility.  This file is used by the Unbound server, but not by <u>unbound-control</u>.

       <b>server-cert-file:</b> <u>&lt;certificate</u> <u>file.pem&gt;</u>
            Path  to  the server self signed certificate, by default unbound_server.pem.  This file is generated
            by the <u>unbound-control-setup</u> utility.  This file  is  used  by  the  Unbound  server,  and  also  by
            <u>unbound-control</u>.

       <b>control-key-file:</b> <u>&lt;private</u> <u>key</u> <u>file&gt;</u>
            Path  to  the control client private key, by default unbound_control.key.  This file is generated by
            the <u>unbound-control-setup</u> utility.  This file is used by <u>unbound-control</u>.

       <b>control-cert-file:</b> <u>&lt;certificate</u> <u>file.pem&gt;</u>
            Path to the control client certificate, by default unbound_control.pem.  This certificate has to  be
            signed  with  the  server certificate.  This file is generated by the <u>unbound-control-setup</u> utility.
            This file is used by <u>unbound-control</u>.

   <b>Stub</b> <b>Zone</b> <b>Options</b>
       There may be multiple <b>stub-zone:</b> clauses. Each with a name: and zero or more hostnames or  IP  addresses.
       For the stub zone this list of nameservers is used. Class IN is assumed.  The servers should be authority
       servers, not recursors; Unbound performs the recursive processing itself for stub zones.

       The  stub  zone  can  be  used  to configure authoritative data to be used by the resolver that cannot be
       accessed using the public internet servers.  This is useful for  company-local  data  or  private  zones.
       Setup  an  authoritative server on a different host (or different port). Enter a config entry for Unbound
       with <b>stub-addr:</b> &lt;ip address of host[@port]&gt;.  The Unbound resolver can  then  access  the  data,  without
       referring to the public internet for it.

       This  setup allows DNSSEC signed zones to be served by that authoritative server, in which case a trusted
       key entry with the public key can be put in config, so that Unbound can validate the data and set the  AD
       bit  on  replies  for  the  private zone (authoritative servers do not set the AD bit).  This setup makes
       Unbound capable of answering queries for the private zone, and can even set the AD bit ('authentic'), but
       the AA ('authoritative') bit is not set on these replies.

       Consider adding <b>server:</b> statements for <b>domain-insecure:</b> and for <b>local-zone:</b> <u>name</u> <u>nodefault</u> for  the  zone
       if  it is a locally served zone.  The insecure clause stops DNSSEC from invalidating the zone.  The local
       zone nodefault (or <u>transparent</u>) clause makes the (reverse-) zone bypass Unbound's  filtering  of  RFC1918
       zones.

       <b>name:</b> <u>&lt;domain</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              Name of the stub zone. This is the full domain name of the zone.

       <b>stub-host:</b> <u>&lt;domain</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              Name  of stub zone nameserver. Is itself resolved before it is used.  To use a nondefault port for
              DNS communication append '@' with the port number.  If tls is enabled, then you can append  a  '#'
              and  a  name, then it'll check the tls authentication certificates with that name.  If you combine
              the '@' and '#', the '@' comes first.  If only '#' is used the  default  port  is  the  configured
              tls-port.

       <b>stub-addr:</b> <u>&lt;IP</u> <u>address&gt;</u>
              IP  address  of  stub  zone  nameserver.  Can  be  IP 4 or IP 6.  To use a nondefault port for DNS
              communication append '@' with the port number.  If tls is enabled, then you can append a '#' and a
              name, then it'll check the tls authentication certificates with that name.  If you combine the '@'
              and '#', the '@' comes first.  If only '#' is used the default port is the configured tls-port.

       <b>stub-prime:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              This option is by default no.  If enabled it performs NS set priming, which  is  similar  to  root
              hints,  where  it  starts using the list of nameservers currently published by the zone.  Thus, if
              the hint list is slightly outdated, the resolver picks up a correct list online.

       <b>stub-first:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If enabled, a query is attempted without the stub clause if it  fails.   The  data  could  not  be
              retrieved  and would have caused SERVFAIL because the servers are unreachable, instead it is tried
              without this clause.  The default is no.

       <b>stub-tls-upstream:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enabled or disable whether the queries to this stub use TLS for transport.  Default is no.

       <b>stub-ssl-upstream:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Alternate syntax for <b>stub-tls-upstream</b>.

       <b>stub-tcp-upstream:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If it is set to "yes" then upstream queries use TCP only for transport regardless of  global  flag
              tcp-upstream.  Default is no.

       <b>stub-no-cache:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Default  is  no.   If  enabled,  data inside the stub is not cached.  This is useful when you want
              immediate changes to be visible.

   <b>Forward</b> <b>Zone</b> <b>Options</b>
       There may be multiple <b>forward-zone:</b> clauses. Each  with  a  <b>name:</b>  and  zero  or  more  hostnames  or  IP
       addresses.   For the forward zone this list of nameservers is used to forward the queries to. The servers
       listed as <b>forward-host:</b> and <b>forward-addr:</b> have to handle further recursion for the  query.   Thus,  those
       servers are not authority servers, but are (just like Unbound is) recursive servers too; Unbound does not
       perform  recursion  itself  for  the forward zone, it lets the remote server do it.  Class IN is assumed.
       CNAMEs are chased by Unbound itself, asking the remote server for every name in the indirection chain, to
       protect the local cache from illegal indirect referenced items.  A forward-zone entry with name "." and a
       forward-addr target will forward all queries to that other server (unless it can answer from the cache).

       <b>name:</b> <u>&lt;domain</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              Name of the forward zone. This is the full domain name of the zone.

       <b>forward-host:</b> <u>&lt;domain</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              Name of server to forward to. Is itself resolved before it is used.  To use a nondefault port  for
              DNS  communication  append '@' with the port number.  If tls is enabled, then you can append a '#'
              and a name, then it'll check the tls authentication certificates with that name.  If  you  combine
              the  '@'  and  '#',  the  '@' comes first.  If only '#' is used the default port is the configured
              tls-port.

       <b>forward-addr:</b> <u>&lt;IP</u> <u>address&gt;</u>
              IP address of server to forward to. Can be IP 4 or IP  6.   To  use  a  nondefault  port  for  DNS
              communication append '@' with the port number.  If tls is enabled, then you can append a '#' and a
              name, then it'll check the tls authentication certificates with that name.  If you combine the '@'
              and '#', the '@' comes first.  If only '#' is used the default port is the configured tls-port.

              At  high  verbosity  it  logs the TLS certificate, with TLS enabled.  If you leave out the '#' and
              auth name from the forward-addr, any name is accepted.  The cert must also match  a  CA  from  the
              tls-cert-bundle.

       <b>forward-first:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If  a  forwarded query is met with a SERVFAIL error, and this option is enabled, Unbound will fall
              back to normal recursive resolution for this query as if no query forwarding had  been  specified.
              The default is "no".

       <b>forward-tls-upstream:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enabled  or  disable  whether the queries to this forwarder use TLS for transport.  Default is no.
              If you enable this, also configure a  tls-cert-bundle  or  use  tls-win-cert  to  load  CA  certs,
              otherwise the connections cannot be authenticated.

       <b>forward-ssl-upstream:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Alternate syntax for <b>forward-tls-upstream</b>.

       <b>forward-tcp-upstream:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If  it  is set to "yes" then upstream queries use TCP only for transport regardless of global flag
              tcp-upstream.  Default is no.

       <b>forward-no-cache:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Default is no.  If enabled, data inside the forward is not cached.  This is useful when  you  want
              immediate changes to be visible.

   <b>Authority</b> <b>Zone</b> <b>Options</b>
       Authority  zones  are  configured with <b>auth-zone:</b>, and each one must have a <b>name:</b>.  There can be multiple
       ones, by listing multiple auth-zone clauses, each with a different name, pertaining to that part  of  the
       namespace.   The authority zone with the name closest to the name looked up is used.  Authority zones can
       be processed on two distinct, non-exclusive, configurable stages.

       With <b>for-downstream:</b> <u>yes</u> (default), authority zones are processed after  <b>local-zones</b>  and  before  cache.
       When used in this manner, Unbound responds like an authority server with no further processing other than
       returning  an answer from the zone contents.  A notable example, in this case, is CNAME records which are
       returned verbatim to downstream clients without further resolution.

       With <b>for-upstream:</b> <u>yes</u> (default), authority zones are processed after the cache lookup, just before going
       to the network to fetch information for recursion.  When used in this manner they provide a local copy of
       an authority server that speeds up lookups for that data during resolving.

       If both options are enabled (default), client queries for an authority zone are answered  authoritatively
       from  Unbound,  while  internal  queries that require data from the authority zone consult the local zone
       data instead of going to the network.

       An interesting configuration is <b>for-downstream:</b> <u>no</u>, <b>for-upstream:</b> <u>yes</u> that allows for hyperlocal behavior
       where both client and internal queries consult the local zone data while resolving.  In  this  case,  the
       aforementioned CNAME example will result in a thoroughly resolved answer.

       Authority  zones can be read from zonefile.  And can be kept updated via AXFR and IXFR.  After update the
       zonefile is rewritten.  The update mechanism uses the SOA timer values and performs SOA  UDP  queries  to
       detect zone changes.

       If  the  update  fetch fails, the timers in the SOA record are used to time another fetch attempt.  Until
       the SOA expiry timer is reached.  Then the zone  is  expired.   When  a  zone  is  expired,  queries  are
       SERVFAIL,  and  any  new  serial  number is accepted from the primary (even if older), and if fallback is
       enabled, the fallback activates to fetch from the upstream instead of the SERVFAIL.

       <b>name:</b> <u>&lt;zone</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              Name of the authority zone.

       <b>primary:</b> <u>&lt;IP</u> <u>address</u> <u>or</u> <u>host</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              Where to download a copy of the zone  from,  with  AXFR  and  IXFR.   Multiple  primaries  can  be
              specified.   They  are  all  tried  if  one fails.  To use a nondefault port for DNS communication
              append '@' with the port number.  You can append a '#' and a name, then AXFR over TLS can be  used
              and  the  tls  authentication certificates will be checked with that name.  If you combine the '@'
              and '#', the '@' comes first.  If you point it at another Unbound  instance,  it  would  not  work
              because  that  does  not  support  AXFR/IXFR  for  the  zone, but if you used <b>url:</b> to download the
              zonefile as a text file from a webserver that would work.  If you specify the hostname, you cannot
              use the domain from the zonefile, because it may not have that when retrieving that data,  instead
              use a plain IP address to avoid a circular dependency on retrieving that IP address.

       <b>master:</b> <u>&lt;IP</u> <u>address</u> <u>or</u> <u>host</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              Alternate syntax for <b>primary</b>.

       <b>url:</b> <u>&lt;url</u> <u>to</u> <u>zonefile&gt;</u>
              Where  to  download  a  zonefile  for  the  zone.   With http or https.  An example for the url is
              "<a href="http://www.example.com/example.org.zone">http://www.example.com/example.org.zone</a>".  Multiple url statements can be given, they  are  tried
              in  turn.   If only urls are given the SOA refresh timer is used to wait for making new downloads.
              If also primaries are listed, the primaries are first probed with UDP SOA queries to  see  if  the
              SOA  serial  number  has changed, reducing the number of downloads.  If none of the urls work, the
              primaries are tried with IXFR and AXFR.  For https, the <b>tls-cert-bundle</b> and the hostname from  the
              url are used to authenticate the connection.  If you specify a hostname in the URL, you cannot use
              the  domain from the zonefile, because it may not have that when retrieving that data, instead use
              a plain IP address  to  avoid  a  circular  dependency  on  retrieving  that  IP  address.   Avoid
              dependencies   on   name   lookups   by   using   a   notation   like   "<a href="http://192.0.2.1/unbound">http://192.0.2.1/unbound</a>-
              primaries/example.com.zone", with an explicit IP address.

       <b>allow-notify:</b> <u>&lt;IP</u> <u>address</u> <u>or</u> <u>host</u> <u>name</u> <u>or</u> <u>netblockIP/prefix&gt;</u>
              With allow-notify you can specify additional sources  of  notifies.   When  notified,  the  server
              attempts  to  first  probe  and  then  zone  transfer.   If the notify is from a primary, it first
              attempts that primary.  Otherwise other primaries are attempted.  If there are no  primaries,  but
              only  urls, the file is downloaded when notified.  The primaries from primary: and url: statements
              are allowed notify by default.

       <b>fallback-enabled:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Default no.  If enabled, Unbound falls back to querying the internet as a resolver for  this  zone
              when lookups fail.  For example for DNSSEC validation failures.

       <b>for-downstream:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Default  yes.  If enabled, Unbound serves authority responses to downstream clients for this zone.
              This option makes Unbound behave, for the queries with  names  in  this  zone,  like  one  of  the
              authority  servers  for  that  zone.  Turn it off if you want Unbound to provide recursion for the
              zone but have a local copy of zone data.  If for-downstream is no and for-upstream  is  yes,  then
              Unbound  will DNSSEC validate the contents of the zone before serving the zone contents to clients
              and store validation results in the cache.

       <b>for-upstream:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Default yes.  If enabled, Unbound fetches data from this data collection for  answering  recursion
              queries.   Instead  of  sending  queries over the internet to the authority servers for this zone,
              it'll fetch the data directly from the zone data.  Turn it on when you  want  Unbound  to  provide
              recursion for downstream clients, and use the zone data as a local copy to speed up lookups.

       <b>zonemd-check:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enable this option to check ZONEMD records in the zone. Default is disabled.  The ZONEMD record is
              a  checksum  over  the  zone data. This includes glue in the zone and data from the zone file, and
              excludes comments from the zone file.  When there is a DNSSEC chain of  trust,  DNSSEC  signatures
              are checked too.

       <b>zonemd-reject-absence:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enable  this  option  to  reject the absence of the ZONEMD record.  Without it, when zonemd is not
              there it is not checked.  It is useful to enable for a nonDNSSEC signed zone  where  the  operator
              wants  to  require  the verification of a ZONEMD, hence a missing ZONEMD is a failure.  The action
              upon failure is controlled by the <b>zonemd-permissive-mode</b> option, for log only or  also  block  the
              zone.  The default is no.

              Without  the  option  absence of a ZONEMD is only a failure when the zone is DNSSEC signed, and we
              have a trust anchor, and the DNSSEC verification of the absence of the  ZONEMD  fails.   With  the
              option enabled, the absence of a ZONEMD is always a failure, also for nonDNSSEC signed zones.

       <b>zonefile:</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              The  filename  where the zone is stored.  If not given then no zonefile is used.  If the file does
              not exist or is empty, Unbound will attempt to fetch zone data (eg. from the primary servers).

   <b>View</b> <b>Options</b>
       There may be multiple <b>view:</b> clauses. Each with a  <b>name:</b>  and  zero  or  more  <b>local-zone</b>  and  <b>local-data</b>
       elements.  Views  can also contain view-first, response-ip, response-ip-data and local-data-ptr elements.
       View can be mapped to requests by specifying the view name in  an  <b>access-control-view</b>  element.  Options
       from  matching  views  will  override  global options. Global options will be used if no matching view is
       found, or when the matching view does not have the option specified.

       <b>name:</b> <u>&lt;view</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              Name of the view. Must be unique. This name is used in access-control-view elements.

       <b>local-zone:</b> <u>&lt;zone&gt;</u> <u>&lt;type&gt;</u>
              View specific local-zone elements. Has the same types  and  behaviour  as  the  global  local-zone
              elements. When there is at least one local-zone specified and view-first is no, the default local-
              zones  will  be  added  to  this  view.   Defaults  can be disabled using the nodefault type. When
              view-first is yes or when a view does not have a local-zone, the global local-zone  will  be  used
              including it's default zones.

       <b>local-data:</b> <u>"&lt;resource</u> <u>record</u> <u>string&gt;"</u>
              View specific local-data elements. Has the same behaviour as the global local-data elements.

       <b>local-data-ptr:</b> <u>"IPaddr</u> <u>name"</u>
              View  specific  local-data-ptr  elements.  Has  the  same  behaviour  as the global local-data-ptr
              elements.

       <b>view-first:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If enabled, it attempts to use the global local-zone and local-data if there is no  match  in  the
              view specific options.  The default is no.

   <b>Python</b> <b>Module</b> <b>Options</b>
       The  <b>python:</b>  clause  gives  the  settings  for  the  <u><a href="../man1/python.1.html">python</a></u>(1) script module.  This module acts like the
       iterator and validator modules do, on queries and answers.  To enable the script  module  it  has  to  be
       compiled  into  the  daemon,  and  the  word "python" has to be put in the <b>module-config:</b> option (usually
       first, or between the validator and iterator). Multiple instances of the python module are  supported  by
       adding the word "python" more than once.

       If  the  <b>chroot:</b>  option  is  enabled,  you should make sure Python's library directory structure is bind
       mounted in the new root environment, see <u><a href="../man8/mount.8.html">mount</a></u>(8).  Also the <b>python-script:</b> path should be  specified  as
       an absolute path relative to the new root, or as a relative path to the working directory.

       <b>python-script:</b> <u>&lt;python</u> <u>file&gt;</u>
              The  script  file  to  load.  Repeat  this  option  for  every python module instance added to the
              <b>module-config:</b> option.

   <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Library</b> <b>Module</b> <b>Options</b>
       The <b>dynlib:</b> clause gives the settings for the <u>dynlib</u> module.  This module is only a  very  small  wrapper
       that  allows  dynamic  modules to be loaded on runtime instead of being compiled into the application. To
       enable the dynlib module it has to be compiled into the daemon, and the word "dynlib" has to  be  put  in
       the  <b>module-config:</b>  option.  Multiple  instances  of  dynamic libraries are supported by adding the word
       "dynlib" more than once.

       The <b>dynlib-file:</b> path should be specified as an absolute path relative to the new  path  set  by  <b>chroot:</b>
       option, or as a relative path to the working directory.

       <b>dynlib-file:</b> <u>&lt;dynlib</u> <u>file&gt;</u>
              The dynamic library file to load. Repeat this option for every dynlib module instance added to the
              <b>module-config:</b> option.

   <b>DNS64</b> <b>Module</b> <b>Options</b>
       The  dns64  module  must  be configured in the <b>module-config:</b> "dns64 validator iterator" directive and be
       compiled into the daemon to be enabled.  These settings go in the <b>server:</b> section.

       <b>dns64-prefix:</b> <u>&lt;IPv6</u> <u>prefix&gt;</u>
              This sets the DNS64 prefix to use to synthesize AAAA records with.  It must  be  /96  or  shorter.
              The default prefix is 64:ff9b::/96.

       <b>dns64-synthall:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Debug  option, default no.  If enabled, synthesize all AAAA records despite the presence of actual
              AAAA records.

       <b>dns64-ignore-aaaa:</b> <u>&lt;name&gt;</u>
              List domain for which the AAAA records are ignored and the A record is used  by  dns64  processing
              instead.   Can  be  entered  multiple times, list a new domain for which it applies, one per line.
              Applies also to names underneath the name given.

   <b>NAT64</b> <b>Operation</b>
       NAT64 operation allows using a NAT64 prefix for outbound requests to IPv4-only servers.  It is controlled
       by two options in the <b>server:</b> section:

       <b>do-nat64:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Use NAT64 to reach IPv4-only servers.  Consider also enabling <b>prefer-ip6</b>  to  prefer  native  IPv6
              connections to nameservers.  Default no.

       <b>nat64-prefix:</b> <u>&lt;IPv6</u> <u>prefix&gt;</u>
              Use  a  specific NAT64 prefix to reach IPv4-only servers.  Defaults to using the prefix configured
              in <b>dns64-prefix</b>, which in turn defaults to 64:ff9b::/96.  The prefix length must be  one  of  /32,
              /40, /48, /56, /64 or /96.

   <b>DNSCrypt</b> <b>Options</b>
       The  <b>dnscrypt:</b> clause gives the settings of the dnscrypt channel. While those options are available, they
       are  only  meaningful  if  Unbound  was  compiled  with  <b>--enable-dnscrypt</b>.   Currently  certificate  and
       secret/public  keys  cannot  be  generated  by  Unbound.  You can use dnscrypt-wrapper to generate those:
       https://github.com/cofyc/dnscrypt-wrapper/blob/master/README.md#usage

       <b>dnscrypt-enable:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Whether or not the <b>dnscrypt</b> config should  be  enabled.  You  may  define  configuration  but  not
              activate it.  The default is no.

       <b>dnscrypt-port:</b> <u>&lt;port</u> <u>number&gt;</u>
              On  which port should <b>dnscrypt</b> should be activated. Note that you should have a matching <b>interface</b>
              option defined in the <b>server</b> section for this port.

       <b>dnscrypt-provider:</b> <u>&lt;provider</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              The  provider  name  to  use  to  distribute  certificates.  This  is  of  the  form:  <b>2.dnscrypt-</b>
              <b>cert.example.com.</b>. The name <u>MUST</u> end with a dot.

       <b>dnscrypt-secret-key:</b> <u>&lt;path</u> <u>to</u> <u>secret</u> <u>key</u> <u>file&gt;</u>
              Path to the time limited secret key file. This option may be specified multiple times.

       <b>dnscrypt-provider-cert:</b> <u>&lt;path</u> <u>to</u> <u>cert</u> <u>file&gt;</u>
              Path  to  the  certificate  related  to  the  <b>dnscrypt-secret-key</b>s.   This option may be specified
              multiple times.

       <b>dnscrypt-provider-cert-rotated:</b> <u>&lt;path</u> <u>to</u> <u>cert</u> <u>file&gt;</u>
              Path to a certificate that we should be able to serve existing connection from but do not want  to
              advertise  over  <b>dnscrypt-provider</b>'s  TXT  record  certs distribution.  A typical use case is when
              rotating certificates, existing clients may still use the client magic from the old cert in  their
              queries  until  they  fetch and update the new cert. Likewise, it would allow one to prime the new
              cert/key without distributing the new cert yet, this can be useful when using a network of servers
              using anycast and on which the configuration may not get  updated  at  the  exact  same  time.  By
              priming  the  cert,  the servers can handle both old and new certs traffic while distributing only
              one.  This option may be specified multiple times.

       <b>dnscrypt-shared-secret-cache-size:</b> <u>&lt;memory</u> <u>size&gt;</u>
              Give the size of the data structure in which the shared secret keys are kept in.  Default 4m.   In
              bytes  or  use  <a href="../manmega/m.mega.html">m</a>(mega),  k(kilo), g(giga).  The shared secret cache is used when a same client is
              making multiple queries using the same public key. It saves a substantial amount of CPU.

       <b>dnscrypt-shared-secret-cache-slabs:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Give power of 2 number of slabs, this is used to reduce lock contention  in  the  dnscrypt  shared
              secrets cache.  Close to the number of cpus is a fairly good setting.

       <b>dnscrypt-nonce-cache-size:</b> <u>&lt;memory</u> <u>size&gt;</u>
              Give  the size of the data structure in which the client nonces are kept in.  Default 4m. In bytes
              or use <a href="../manmega/m.mega.html">m</a>(mega), k(kilo), g(giga).  The nonce cache is used to prevent dnscrypt message  replaying.
              Client nonce should be unique for any pair of client pk/server sk.

       <b>dnscrypt-nonce-cache-slabs:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Give  power  of  2  number  of slabs, this is used to reduce lock contention in the dnscrypt nonce
              cache.  Close to the number of cpus is a fairly good setting.

   <b>EDNS</b> <b>Client</b> <b>Subnet</b> <b>Module</b> <b>Options</b>
       The ECS module must be configured in the <b>module-config:</b> "subnetcache validator iterator" directive and be
       compiled into the daemon to be enabled.  These settings go in the <b>server:</b> section.

       If the destination address is allowed in the configuration Unbound will add the EDNS0 option to the query
       containing the relevant part of the client's address.   When  an  answer  contains  the  ECS  option  the
       response  and  the  option  are placed in a specialized cache. If the authority indicated no support, the
       response is stored in the regular cache.

       Additionally, when a client includes the option in its queries, Unbound  will  forward  the  option  when
       sending the query to addresses that are explicitly allowed in the configuration using <b>send-client-subnet</b>.
       The option will always be forwarded, regardless the allowed addresses, if <b>client-subnet-always-forward</b> is
       set to yes. In this case the lookup in the regular cache is skipped.

       The  maximum size of the ECS cache is controlled by 'msg-cache-size' in the configuration file. On top of
       that, for each query only 100 different subnets are  allowed  to  be  stored  for  each  address  family.
       Exceeding that number, older entries will be purged from cache.

       This module does not interact with the <b>serve-expired*</b> and <b>prefetch:</b> options.

       <b>send-client-subnet:</b> <u>&lt;IP</u> <u>address&gt;</u>
              Send  client  source  address  to  this  authority. Append /num to indicate a classless delegation
              netblock, for example like 10.2.3.4/24 or 2001::11/64. Can be given  multiple  times.  Authorities
              not  listed  will  not  receive  edns-subnet  information,  unless domain in query is specified in
              <b>client-subnet-zone</b>.

       <b>client-subnet-zone:</b> <u>&lt;domain&gt;</u>
              Send client source address in queries for this domain and its subdomains. Can  be  given  multiple
              times.  Zones  not  listed  will  not  receive edns-subnet information, unless hosted by authority
              specified in <b>send-client-subnet</b>.

       <b>client-subnet-always-forward:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Specify whether the ECS address check (configured using <b>send-client-subnet</b>)  is  applied  for  all
              queries,  even  if  the triggering query contains an ECS record, or only for queries for which the
              ECS record is generated using the querier address (and therefore did not contain ECS data  in  the
              client  query).  If  enabled,  the  address check is skipped when the client query contains an ECS
              record. And the lookup in the regular cache is skipped.  Default is no.

       <b>max-client-subnet-ipv6:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Specifies the maximum prefix length of the client source address we are willing to expose to third
              parties for IPv6.  Defaults to 56.

       <b>max-client-subnet-ipv4:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Specifies the maximum prefix length of the client source address we are willing to expose to third
              parties for IPv4. Defaults to 24.

       <b>min-client-subnet-ipv6:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Specifies the minimum prefix length of the IPv6 source mask we are willing to accept  in  queries.
              Shorter source masks result in REFUSED answers. Source mask of 0 is always accepted. Default is 0.

       <b>min-client-subnet-ipv4:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Specifies  the  minimum prefix length of the IPv4 source mask we are willing to accept in queries.
              Shorter source masks result in REFUSED answers. Source mask of 0 is always accepted. Default is 0.

       <b>max-ecs-tree-size-ipv4:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Specifies the maximum number of subnets ECS answers kept in  the  ECS  radix  tree.   This  number
              applies for each qname/qclass/qtype tuple. Defaults to 100.

       <b>max-ecs-tree-size-ipv6:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              Specifies  the  maximum  number  of  subnets  ECS answers kept in the ECS radix tree.  This number
              applies for each qname/qclass/qtype tuple. Defaults to 100.

   <b>Opportunistic</b> <b>IPsec</b> <b>Support</b> <b>Module</b> <b>Options</b>
       The IPsec module must be configured in the <b>module-config:</b> "ipsecmod validator iterator" directive and  be
       compiled  into  Unbound  by  using  <b>--enable-ipsecmod</b>  to  be  enabled.  These settings go in the <b>server:</b>
       section.

       When Unbound receives an A/AAAA query that is not in the cache and finds a valid answer, it will withhold
       returning the answer and instead will generate an IPSECKEY subquery for the  same  domain  name.   If  an
       answer was found, Unbound will call an external hook passing the following arguments:

            <u>QNAME</u>
                 Domain name of the A/AAAA and IPSECKEY query.  In string format.

            <u>IPSECKEY</u> <u>TTL</u>
                 TTL of the IPSECKEY RRset.

            <u>A/AAAA</u>
                 String  of  space  separated IP addresses present in the A/AAAA RRset.  The IP addresses are in
                 string format.

            <u>IPSECKEY</u>
                 String of space separated IPSECKEY RDATA present in the IPSECKEY RRset.  The IPSECKEY RDATA are
                 in DNS presentation format.

       The A/AAAA answer is then cached and returned to the client.  If the external hook  was  called  the  TTL
       changes to ensure it doesn't surpass <b>ipsecmod-max-ttl</b>.

       The  same procedure is also followed when <b>prefetch:</b> is used, but the A/AAAA answer is given to the client
       before the hook is called.  <b>ipsecmod-max-ttl</b> ensures that the A/AAAA answer given  from  cache  is  still
       relevant for opportunistic IPsec.

       <b>ipsecmod-enabled:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Specifies  whether the IPsec module is enabled or not.  The IPsec module still needs to be defined
              in the <b>module-config:</b> directive.  This  option  facilitates  turning  on/off  the  module  without
              restarting/reloading Unbound.  Defaults to yes.

       <b>ipsecmod-hook:</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              Specifies  the  external hook that Unbound will call with <u><a href="../man3/system.3.html">system</a></u>(3).  The file can be specified as
              an absolute/relative path.  The file needs the proper permissions to be able to be executed by the
              same user that runs Unbound.  It must  be  present  when  the  IPsec  module  is  defined  in  the
              <b>module-config:</b> directive.

       <b>ipsecmod-strict:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If  enabled  Unbound  requires the external hook to return a success value of 0.  Failing to do so
              Unbound will reply with SERVFAIL.  The A/AAAA answer will also not be cached.  Defaults to no.

       <b>ipsecmod-max-ttl:</b> <u>&lt;seconds&gt;</u>
              Time to live maximum for A/AAAA cached records after calling the external hook.  Defaults to 3600.

       <b>ipsecmod-ignore-bogus:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Specifies the behaviour of Unbound when the IPSECKEY answer is bogus.  If set  to  yes,  the  hook
              will  be called and the A/AAAA answer will be returned to the client.  If set to no, the hook will
              not be called and the answer to the A/AAAA query will  be  SERVFAIL.   Mainly  used  for  testing.
              Defaults to no.

       <b>ipsecmod-allow:</b> <u>&lt;domain&gt;</u>
              Allow the ipsecmod functionality for the domain so that the module logic will be executed.  Can be
              given  multiple  times,  for  different  domains.  If the option is not specified, all domains are
              treated as being allowed (default).

       <b>ipsecmod-whitelist:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Alternate syntax for <b>ipsecmod-allow</b>.

   <b>Cache</b> <b>DB</b> <b>Module</b> <b>Options</b>
       The Cache DB module must be configured in the <b>module-config:</b> "validator cachedb iterator"  directive  and
       be  compiled  into  the  daemon  with  <b>--enable-cachedb</b>.   If  this module is enabled and configured, the
       specified backend database works as a second level cache: When Unbound cannot find an answer to  a  query
       in  its  built-in  in-memory cache, it consults the specified backend.  If it finds a valid answer in the
       backend, Unbound uses it to respond to the query without performing iterative DNS resolution.  If Unbound
       cannot even find an answer in the backend, it resolves the query as usual, and stores the answer  in  the
       backend.

       This  module  interacts  with  the <b>serve-expired-*</b> options and will reply with expired data if Unbound is
       configured for that.

       If Unbound was built with <b>--with-libhiredis</b> on a system that has installed the hiredis C  client  library
       of  Redis,  then  the  "redis"  backend  can be used.  This backend communicates with the specified Redis
       server over a TCP connection to store and retrieve cache data.  It can be used  as  a  persistent  and/or
       shared  cache  backend.   It  should be noted that Unbound never removes data stored in the Redis server,
       even if some data have expired in terms of DNS TTL or the Redis server  has  cached  too  much  data;  if
       necessary  the  Redis  server  must  be  configured to limit the cache size, preferably with some kind of
       least-recently-used eviction policy.  Additionally, the <b>redis-expire-records</b> option can be used in  order
       to  set  the  relative  DNS  TTL  of  the message as timeout to the Redis records; keep in mind that some
       additional memory is used per key and that the expire information is stored as absolute  Unix  timestamps
       in  Redis  (computer  time  must  be stable).  This backend uses synchronous communication with the Redis
       server based on the assumption that the communication  is  stable  and  sufficiently  fast.   The  thread
       waiting  for  a response from the Redis server cannot handle other DNS queries.  Although the backend has
       the ability to reconnect to the server when  the  connection  is  closed  unexpectedly  and  there  is  a
       configurable  timeout  in  case the server is overly slow or hangs up, these cases are assumed to be very
       rare.  If connection close or timeout happens too often, Unbound will be effectively unusable  with  this
       backend.  It's the administrator's responsibility to make the assumption hold.

       The <b>cachedb:</b> clause gives custom settings of the cache DB module.

       <b>backend:</b> <u>&lt;backend</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              Specify  the  backend  database  name.   The  default  database  is  the  in-memory  backend named
              "testframe", which, as the name suggests, is not of any practical use.  Depending  on  the  build-
              time configuration, "redis" backend may also be used as described above.

       <b>secret-seed:</b> <u>&lt;"secret</u> <u>string"&gt;</u>
              Specify  a  seed to calculate a hash value from query information.  This value will be used as the
              key of the corresponding answer for the backend database and can be customized if the hash  should
              not  be  predictable  operationally.   If  the  backend  database  is  shared  by multiple Unbound
              instances, all instances must use the same secret seed.  This option defaults to "default".

       <b>cachedb-no-store:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If the backend should be read from, but not written to. This makes this  instance  not  store  dns
              messages in the backend. But if data is available it is retrieved. The default is no.

       <b>cachedb-check-when-serve-expired:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If  enabled, the cachedb is checked before an expired response is returned.  When <b>serve-expired</b> is
              enabled, without <b>serve-expired-client-timeout</b>, it  then  does  not  immediately  respond  with  an
              expired  response  from  cache, but instead first checks the cachedb for valid contents, and if so
              returns it. If the cachedb also has no valid contents, the serve expired  response  is  sent.   If
              also  <b>serve-expired-client-timeout</b>  is  enabled, the expired response is delayed until the timeout
              expires. Unless the lookup succeeds within the timeout. The default is yes.

       The following <b>cachedb</b> options are specific to the redis backend.

       <b>redis-server-host:</b> <u>&lt;server</u> <u>address</u> <u>or</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              The IP (either v6 or v4) address or domain name of the Redis server.  In  general  an  IP  address
              should be specified as otherwise Unbound will have to resolve the name of the server every time it
              establishes a connection to the server.  This option defaults to "127.0.0.1".

       <b>redis-server-port:</b> <u>&lt;port</u> <u>number&gt;</u>
              The TCP port number of the Redis server.  This option defaults to 6379.

       <b>redis-server-path:</b> <u>&lt;unix</u> <u>socket</u> <u>path&gt;</u>
              The  unix  socket  path to connect to the redis server. Off by default, and it can be set to "" to
              turn this off. Unix sockets may have better throughput than the IP address option.

       <b>redis-server-password:</b> <u>"&lt;password&gt;"</u>
              The Redis AUTH password to use for the redis server.  Only relevant if  Redis  is  configured  for
              client password authorisation.  Off by default, and it can be set to "" to turn this off.

       <b>redis-timeout:</b> <u>&lt;msec&gt;</u>
              The  period until when Unbound waits for a response from the Redis sever.  If this timeout expires
              Unbound closes the connection, treats it as if the Redis server does not have the requested  data,
              and will try to re-establish a new connection later.  This option defaults to 100 milliseconds.

       <b>redis-command-timeout:</b> <u>&lt;msec&gt;</u>
              The timeout to use for redis commands, in milliseconds. If 0, it uses the redis-timeout value. The
              default is 0.

       <b>redis-connect-timeout:</b> <u>&lt;msec&gt;</u>
              The  timeout  to use for redis connection set up, in milliseconds. If 0, it uses the redis-timeout
              value. The default is 0.

       <b>redis-expire-records:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If Redis record expiration is enabled.  If yes, Unbound sets timeout for  Redis  records  so  that
              Redis can evict keys that have expired automatically.  If Unbound is configured with <b>serve-expired</b>
              and  <b>serve-expired-ttl</b>  is  0, this option is internally reverted to "no".  Redis SETEX support is
              required for this option (Redis &gt;= 2.0.0).  This option defaults to no.

       <b>redis-logical-db:</b> <u>&lt;logical</u> <u>database</u> <u>index&gt;</u>
              The logical database in Redis to use.  These are databases in the same Redis instance sharing  the
              same  configuration  and  persisted  in the same RDB/AOF file.  If unsure about using this option,
              Redis documentation  (https://redis.io/commands/select/)  suggests  not  to  use  a  single  Redis
              instance  for  multiple  unrelated  applications.   The default database in Redis is 0 while other
              logical databases need to be explicitly SELECT'ed upon connecting.  This option defaults to 0.

   <b>DNSTAP</b> <b>Logging</b> <b>Options</b>
       DNSTAP support, when compiled in by using <b>--enable-dnstap</b>, is  enabled  in  the  <b>dnstap:</b>  section.   This
       starts an extra thread (when compiled with threading) that writes the log information to the destination.
       If  Unbound  is  compiled  without  threading it does not spawn a thread, but connects per-process to the
       destination.

       <b>dnstap-enable:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If dnstap is enabled.  Default no.  If yes, it connects to the dnstap server and  if  any  of  the
              dnstap-log-..-messages options is enabled it sends logs for those messages to the server.

       <b>dnstap-bidirectional:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Use frame streams in bidirectional mode to transfer DNSTAP messages. Default is yes.

       <b>dnstap-socket-path:</b> <u>&lt;file</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              Sets  the  unix  socket  file  name for connecting to the server that is listening on that socket.
              Default is "/run/dnstap.sock".

       <b>dnstap-ip:</b> <u>&lt;IPaddress[@port]&gt;</u>
              If "", the unix socket is used, if set with an IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) that address is  used  to
              connect to the server.

       <b>dnstap-tls:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Set  this to use TLS to connect to the server specified in <b>dnstap-ip</b>.  The default is yes.  If set
              to no, TCP is used to connect to the server.

       <b>dnstap-tls-server-name:</b> <u>&lt;name</u> <u>of</u> <u>TLS</u> <u>authentication&gt;</u>
              The TLS server name to authenticate the server with.  Used when <b>dnstap-tls</b> is enabled.  If  ""  it
              is ignored, default "".

       <b>dnstap-tls-cert-bundle:</b> <u>&lt;file</u> <u>name</u> <u>of</u> <u>cert</u> <u>bundle&gt;</u>
              The pem file with certs to verify the TLS server certificate. If "" the server default cert bundle
              is used, or the windows cert bundle on windows.  Default is "".

       <b>dnstap-tls-client-key-file:</b> <u>&lt;file</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              The  client  key  file  for  TLS  client  authentication. If "" client authentication is not used.
              Default is "".

       <b>dnstap-tls-client-cert-file:</b> <u>&lt;file</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              The client cert file for TLS client authentication.  Default is "".

       <b>dnstap-send-identity:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If enabled, the server identity is included in the log messages.  Default is no.

       <b>dnstap-send-version:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If enabled, the server version if included in the log messages.  Default is no.

       <b>dnstap-identity:</b> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>
              The identity to send with messages, if "" the hostname is used.  Default is "".

       <b>dnstap-version:</b> <u>&lt;string&gt;</u>
              The version to send with messages, if "" the package version is used.  Default is "".

       <b>dnstap-sample-rate:</b> <u>&lt;number&gt;</u>
              The sample rate for log of messages, it logs only 1/N messages. With 0 it is disabled. Default  is
              0.  This  is  useful  in a high volume environment, where log functionality would otherwise not be
              reliable. For example 10 would spend only 1/10th time on logging,  and  100  would  only  spend  a
              hundredth of the time on logging.

       <b>dnstap-log-resolver-query-messages:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enable  to  log  resolver  query  messages.   Default  is  no.  These are messages from Unbound to
              upstream servers.

       <b>dnstap-log-resolver-response-messages:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enable to log resolver response messages.  Default is no.  These are replies from upstream servers
              to Unbound.

       <b>dnstap-log-client-query-messages:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enable to log client query messages.  Default is no.  These are client queries to Unbound.

       <b>dnstap-log-client-response-messages:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enable to log client response messages.  Default is no.   These  are  responses  from  Unbound  to
              clients.

       <b>dnstap-log-forwarder-query-messages:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enable to log forwarder query messages.  Default is no.

       <b>dnstap-log-forwarder-response-messages:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Enable to log forwarder response messages.  Default is no.

   <b>Response</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Zone</b> <b>Options</b>
       Response  Policy  Zones  are  configured with <b>rpz:</b>, and each one must have a <b>name:</b>. There can be multiple
       ones, by listing multiple RPZ clauses, each with a different name. RPZ clauses are applied  in  order  of
       configuration  and any match from an earlier RPZ zone will terminate the RPZ lookup. Note that a PASSTHRU
       action is still considered a match.  The <b>respip</b> module needs to be  added  to  the  <b>module-config</b>,  e.g.:
       <b>module-config:</b> <b>"respip</b> <b>validator</b> <b>iterator"</b>.

       QNAME,  Response  IP  Address, nsdname, nsip and clientip triggers are supported.  Supported actions are:
       NXDOMAIN, NODATA, PASSTHRU, DROP, Local Data, tcp-only and drop.  RPZ QNAME triggers  are  applied  after
       <b>local-zones</b> and before <b>auth-zones</b>.

       The RPZ zone is a regular DNS zone formatted with a SOA start record as usual.  The items in the zone are
       entries, that specify what to act on (the trigger) and what to do (the action).  The trigger to act on is
       recorded in the name, the action to do is recorded as the resource record.  The names all end in the zone
       name, so you could type the trigger names without a trailing dot in the zonefile.

       An example RPZ record, that answers example.com with NXDOMAIN
            example.com CNAME .

       The triggers are encoded in the name on the left
            name                          query name
            netblock.rpz-client-ip        client IP address
            netblock.rpz-ip               response IP address in the answer
            name.rpz-nsdname              nameserver name
            netblock.rpz-nsip             nameserver IP address
       The  netblock  is written as &lt;netblocklen&gt;.&lt;ip address in reverse&gt;.  For IPv6 use 'zz' for '::'.  Specify
       individual  addresses  with  scope  length  of  32  or  128.   For  example,  24.10.100.51.198.rpz-ip  is
       198.51.100.10/24 and 32.10.zz.db8.2001.rpz-ip is 2001:db8:0:0:0:0:0:10/32.

       The actions are specified with the record on the right
            CNAME .                      nxdomain reply
            CNAME *.                     nodata reply
            CNAME rpz-passthru.          do nothing, allow to continue
            CNAME rpz-drop.              the query is dropped
            CNAME rpz-tcp-only.          answer over TCP
            A 192.0.2.1                  answer with this IP address
       Other  records  like AAAA, TXT and other CNAMEs (not rpz-..) can also be used to answer queries with that
       content.

       The RPZ zones can be configured in the config file with these settings in the <b>rpz:</b> block.

       <b>name:</b> <u>&lt;zone</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              Name of the authority zone.

       <b>primary:</b> <u>&lt;IP</u> <u>address</u> <u>or</u> <u>host</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              Where to download a copy of the zone  from,  with  AXFR  and  IXFR.   Multiple  primaries  can  be
              specified.   They  are  all  tried  if  one fails.  To use a nondefault port for DNS communication
              append '@' with the port number.  You can append a '#' and a name, then AXFR over TLS can be  used
              and  the  tls  authentication certificates will be checked with that name.  If you combine the '@'
              and '#', the '@' comes first.  If you point it at another Unbound  instance,  it  would  not  work
              because  that  does  not  support  AXFR/IXFR  for  the  zone, but if you used <b>url:</b> to download the
              zonefile as a text file from a webserver that would work.  If you specify the hostname, you cannot
              use the domain from the zonefile, because it may not have that when retrieving that data,  instead
              use a plain IP address to avoid a circular dependency on retrieving that IP address.

       <b>master:</b> <u>&lt;IP</u> <u>address</u> <u>or</u> <u>host</u> <u>name&gt;</u>
              Alternate syntax for <b>primary</b>.

       <b>url:</b> <u>&lt;url</u> <u>to</u> <u>zonefile&gt;</u>
              Where  to  download  a  zonefile  for  the  zone.   With http or https.  An example for the url is
              "<a href="http://www.example.com/example.org.zone">http://www.example.com/example.org.zone</a>".  Multiple url statements can be given, they  are  tried
              in  turn.   If only urls are given the SOA refresh timer is used to wait for making new downloads.
              If also primaries are listed, the primaries are first probed with UDP SOA queries to  see  if  the
              SOA  serial  number  has changed, reducing the number of downloads.  If none of the urls work, the
              primaries are tried with IXFR and AXFR.  For https, the <b>tls-cert-bundle</b> and the hostname from  the
              url are used to authenticate the connection.

       <b>allow-notify:</b> <u>&lt;IP</u> <u>address</u> <u>or</u> <u>host</u> <u>name</u> <u>or</u> <u>netblockIP/prefix&gt;</u>
              With  allow-notify  you  can  specify  additional  sources of notifies.  When notified, the server
              attempts to first probe and then zone transfer.  If  the  notify  is  from  a  primary,  it  first
              attempts  that  primary.  Otherwise other primaries are attempted.  If there are no primaries, but
              only urls, the file is downloaded when notified.  The primaries from primary: and url:  statements
              are allowed notify by default.

       <b>zonefile:</b> <u>&lt;filename&gt;</u>
              The  filename  where the zone is stored.  If not given then no zonefile is used.  If the file does
              not exist or is empty, Unbound will attempt to fetch zone data (eg. from the primary servers).

       <b>rpz-action-override:</b> <u>&lt;action&gt;</u>
              Always use this RPZ action for matching triggers from this zone. Possible  action  are:  nxdomain,
              nodata, passthru, drop, disabled and cname.

       <b>rpz-cname-override:</b> <u>&lt;domain&gt;</u>
              The CNAME target domain to use if the cname action is configured for <b>rpz-action-override</b>.

       <b>rpz-log:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Log all applied RPZ actions for this RPZ zone. Default is no.

       <b>rpz-log-name:</b> <u>&lt;name&gt;</u>
              Specify a string to be part of the log line, for easy referencing.

       <b>rpz-signal-nxdomain-ra:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              Signal  when  a  query  is  blocked  by  the RPZ with NXDOMAIN with an unset RA flag.  This allows
              certain clients, like dnsmasq, to infer that the domain is externally blocked. Default is no.

       <b>for-downstream:</b> <u>&lt;yes</u> <u>or</u> <u>no&gt;</u>
              If enabled the zone is authoritatively answered for and queries for the RPZ zone  information  are
              answered  to  downstream  clients. This is useful for monitoring scripts, that can then access the
              SOA information to check if the RPZ information is up to date. Default is no.

       <b>tags:</b> <u>&lt;list</u> <u>of</u> <u>tags&gt;</u>
              Limit the policies from this RPZ clause to clients with a matching tag. Tags need to be defined in
              <b>define-tag</b> and can be assigned to client addresses using <b>access-control-tag</b>. Enclose list of  tags
              in quotes ("") and put spaces between tags. If no tags are specified the policies from this clause
              will be applied for all clients.

</pre><h4><b>MEMORY</b> <b>CONTROL</b> <b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       In the example config settings below memory usage is reduced. Some service levels are lower, notable very
       large  data  and  a  high  TCP  load  are  no  longer  supported.  Very large data and high TCP loads are
       exceptional for the DNS.  DNSSEC validation is enabled, just add trust anchors.  If you do  not  have  to
       worry  about  programs using more than 3 Mb of memory, the below example is not for you. Use the defaults
       to receive full service, which on BSD-32bit tops out at 30-40 Mb after heavy usage.
