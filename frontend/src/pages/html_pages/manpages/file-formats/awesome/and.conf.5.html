</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/and.conf - general configuration parameters for the auto nice daemon.

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       This manual page documents and.conf for <b>and</b> version 1.2.2.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  is  the  general  configuration  file for <b>and.</b>  It stores settings like the default nice level, the
       renice intervals, the three stages of renicing, and the affinity  of  the  priority  database,  i.e.  the
       weight  of  (user,  group,  command)  when  resolving  nice  levels from the database. These settings are
       described below.

       Comments start with a # in the <b>first</b> <b>column.</b>  Empty lines are ignored. Unlike  with  other  configuration
       files, lines <b>cannot</b> <b>be</b> <b>concatenated</b> with a backslash. Furthermore, this file is <b>case</b> <b>sensitive.</b>

       <b>and</b>  allows  for  host-specific  sections  in  the configuration file. These work as lines of the form <u>on</u>
       <u>somehost</u> and work as follows: the parser determines if the host name (as returned by gethostname) matches
       the extended regular expression that follows the <u>on</u> keyword. If it does, it  just  keeps  processing  the
       file  as  if nothing had happened. If it does not match, however, everything up to the next <u>on</u> keyword is
       skipped. So if you want to end a host-specific section, you must write <u>on</u> <u>.*</u>  (which matches  all  hosts)
       to switch back to normal.

       Don't forget to <b>kill</b> <b>-HUP</b> the auto nice daemon to enable the changes.

</pre><h4><b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>defaultnice</b>
            The  default  nice  level.  A  number  between  0  and  19.  Jobs for which no entry can be found in
            <u>/etc/and.priorities</u> are reniced to this level, regardless of the CPU time they've used  so  far.  If
            you  prefer  to  renice unknown jobs gradually, you can do so by supplying three asterisks as (user,
            group, command) tuple in <u>/etc/and.priorities.</u>  The default nice level is <u>0</u>

       <b>interval</b>
            The default interval between nice checks of the auto nice daemon, in  seconds.  This  value  can  be
            overridden by the <u>-i</u> command-line option of <b>and.</b>  The default interval is <u>60</u> seconds.

       <b>lv1time</b>

       <b>lv2time</b>

       <b>lv3time</b>
            Ranges  for  the  nice  levels.  Jobs  with less than lv1time seconds CPU time are not reniced; jobs
            between lv1time and lv2time seconds are reniced to the first level in  an.priorities;  jobs  between
            lv2time  and lv3time seconds to the second level; jobs with more than lv3time seconds are reniced to
            the third level.  Defaults are <u>120</u> , <u>1200</u> , and <u>3600</u> seconds.

       <b>minuid,</b> <b>mingid</b>
            Minimum user id and group id to be considered for renicing.  Processes whose user id is below <u>minuid</u>
            are left alone, as are processes with a group id of below <u>mingid.</u>  (Note that even if you set minuid
            to zero, root processes are left alone.)

       <b>affinity</b>
            Strategy for picking the right priority entry  for  a  user/group/job  triple.  The  strategy  is  a
            permutation  of  "cgu", "c"ommand, "g"roup, "u"ser. The order specifies the affinity of the priority
            lookup method. Suppose you have an entry for all jobs of user <u>foo,</u> another entry  for  all  jobs  of
            group  <u>bar,</u> and yet another entry for the command <u>baz.</u>  Furthermore suppose user <u>foo</u> (who happens to
            belong to group <u>bar</u> ) starts a job named <u>baz</u> -- which entry should  be  chosen?  This  is  what  the
            affinity setting means, for example "cug" means an exact match of the command has priority over both
            an  exact match of the user and the group. The default affinity is "cug", which is probably sensible
            for most cases, since it's the job which takes up CPU time, not the user or group ID.

       <b>Default</b> <b>Configuration</b>
            # This is the default configuration:
            defaultnice 0
            interval 60
            lv1time 300
            lv2time 1800
            lv3time 3600
            affinity cug
            minuid 0
            mingid 0

       <b>Default</b> <b>Configuration,</b> <b>with</b> <b>terminals</b>
            # Normal default configuration for all
            defaultnice 0
            interval 60
            lv1time 300
            lv2time 1800
            lv3time 3600
            # Hosts foo, bar, baz are terminals and must
            # be more responsive, so earlier renice.
            on (foo|bar)
            lv1time 120
            lv2time 600
            lv3time 1200
            on .*
            # This is for all hosts again
            affinity cug

       <b>Group-specific</b> <b>Hosts</b>
            defaultnice 0
            interval 60
            lv1time 300
            lv2time 1800
            lv3time 3600
            # Normal affinity for all hosts.
            affinity cug
            # Hosts bar, baz belong to group foo, which
            # is privileged on these hosts, so override
            # affinity. (Note regexp!)
            on ba[rz]
            affinity guc
            on .*
            minuid 500
            mingid 100

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/and.conf</b>
            General configuration file. Stores default nice level, default interval, the "time  zones"  and  the
            database lookup affinity. This is what this manual page is about.
