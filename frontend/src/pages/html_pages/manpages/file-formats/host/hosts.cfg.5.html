</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       hosts.cfg - Main Xymon configuration file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       hosts.cfg

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u><a href="../man5/hosts.cfg.5.html">hosts.cfg</a>(5)</u> file is the most important configuration file for all of the Xymon programs.  This file
       contains the full list of all the systems monitored by Xymon,  including  the  set  of  tests  and  other
       configuration items stored for each host.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Each  line of the file defines a host. Blank lines and lines starting with a hash mark (#) are treated as
       comments and ignored.  Long lines can be broken up by putting a backslash at the  end  of  the  line  and
       continuing the entry on the next line.

       The format of an entry in the hosts.cfg file is as follows:
          IP-address hostname # tag1 tag2 ...

       The  IP-address  and  hostname are mandatory; all of the tags are optional.  Listing a host with only IP-
       address and hostname will cause a network test to be executed for the host -  the  connectivity  test  is
       enabled by default, but no other tests.

       The optional tags are then used to define which tests are relevant for the host, and also to set e.g. the
       time-interval used for availability reporting by <u><a href="../man1/xymongen.1.html">xymongen</a>(1)</u>

       An  example  of  setting up the hosts.cfg file is in the Xymon on-line documentation (from the Help menu,
       choose "Configuring Monitoring").  The following describes the possible  settings  in  a  hosts.cfg  file
       supported by Xymon.

</pre><h4><b>TAGS</b> <b>RECOGNIZED</b> <b>BY</b> <b>ALL</b> <b>TOOLS</b></h4><pre>
       include filename
              This tag is used to include another file into the hosts.cfg file at run-time, allowing for a large
              hosts.cfg file to be split up into more manageable pieces.

              The  "filename"  argument  should  point  to  a  file  that uses the same syntax as hosts.cfg. The
              filename can be an absolute filename (if it begins with a '/'), or a relative filename -  relative
              file  names  are  prefixed  with  the  directory where the main hosts.cfg file is located (usually
              $XYMONHOME/etc/).

              You can nest include tags, i.e. a file that is included from the main hosts.cfg  file  can  itself
              include other files.

       dispinclude filename
              Acts  like  the "include" tag, but only for the xymongen tool.  Can be used e.g. to put a group of
              hosts on multiple sub-pages, without having to repeat the host definitions.

       netinclude filename
              Acts like the "include" tag, but only for the xymonnet tool.

       directory directoryname
              This tag is used to include all files in the named directory.  Files are included in  alphabetical
              order. If there are sub- directories, these are recursively included also. The following files are
              ignored:  Files  that begin with a dot, files that end with a tilde, RCS files that end with ",v",
              RPM package manager files ending in ".rpmsave" or ".rpmnew", DPKG package manager files ending  in
              ".dpkg-new" or ".dpkg-orig", and all special files (devices, sockets, pipes etc).

       optional include/directory
              Both  "include"  and  "directory"  can  be prefixed with the tag "optional", which will prevent an
              error message being logged if the file or directory is not present on a system.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>PER-HOST</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       noclear
              Controls whether stale status messages go purple or clear when a host is down.  Normally,  when  a
              host  is  down  the  client statuses ("cpu", "disk", "memory" etc) will stop updating - this would
              usually make them go "purple" which can trigger alerts. To avoid that, Xymon checks if the  "conn"
              test has failed, and if that is true then the other tests will go "clear" instead of purple so you
              only  get  alerts for the "conn" test. If you do want the stale statuses to go purple, you can use
              the "noclear" tag to override this behaviour.

              Note that "noclear" also affects the behaviour of network tests; see below.

       prefer When a single host is defined multiple time in the hosts.cfg file, xymongen tries to  guess  which
              definition  is the best to use for the information used on the "info" column, or for the NOPROPRED
              and other xymongen-specific settings. Host definitions that have  a  "noconn"  tag  or  an  IP  of
              0.0.0.0 get lower priority.

              By using the "prefer" tag you tell xymongen that this host definition should be used.

              Note:  This  only applies to hosts that are defined multiple times in the hosts.cfg file, although
              it will not hurt to add it on other hosts as well.

       multihomed
              Tell Xymon that data from the host can arrive from multiple IP-addresses.  By default, Xymon  will
              warn  if  it  sees  data  for  one  host  coming from different IP-addresses, because this usually
              indicates a mis-configuration of the hostname on at least one of the servers involved. Some  hosts
              with  multiple  IP-addresses  may  use different IP's for sending data to Xymon, however. This tag
              disables the check of source IP when receiving data.

       delayred=STATUSCOLUMN:DELAY[,STATUSCOLUMN:DELAY...]
              Usually, status changes happen immediately. This tag is used to defer an update  to  red  for  the
              STATUSCOLUMN  status for DELAY minutes. E.g.  with <b>delayred=disk:10,cpu:30</b>, a red disk-status will
              not appear on the Xymon webpages until it has been red for at least 10 minutes.  Note: Since  most
              tests only execute once every 5 minutes, it will usually not make sense to set N to anything but a
              multiple  of  5.  The  exception  is  network tests, since <u><a href="../man1/xymonnet-again.sh.1.html">xymonnet-again.sh</a>(1)</u> will re-run failed
              network tests once a minute for up to 30 minutes.

       delayyellow=STATUSCOLUMN:DELAY[,STATUSCOLUMN:DELAY...]
              Same as <b>delayred</b>, but defers the change to a yellow status.

</pre><h4><b>XYMONGEN</b> <b>DISPLAY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These tags are processed by the <u><a href="../man1/xymongen.1.html">xymongen</a>(1)</u> tool when generating the Xymon webpages or reports.

       page NAME [Page-title]
              This defines a page at the level below the entry page. All hosts following  the  "page"  directive
              appear on this page, until a new "page", "subpage" or "subparent" line is found.

       subpage NAME [Page-title]
              This defines a sub-page in the second level below the entry page.  You must have a previous "page"
              line to hook this sub-page to.

       subparent parentpage newpage [Page-title]
              This is used to define sub-pages in whatever levels you may wish. Just like the standard "subpage"
              tag,  "subparent" defines a new Xymon web page; however with "subparent" you explicitly list which
              page it should go as a sub-page to. You can pick any page as the parent - pages, sub-pages or even
              other subparent pages. So this allows you to define any tree structure of pages that you like.

              E.g. with this in hosts.cfg:

                 page USA United States
                 subpage NY New York
                 subparent NY manhattan Manhattan data centers
                 subparent manhattan wallstreet Wall Street center

              you get this hierarchy of pages:

                 USA (United States)
                   NY (New York)
                     manhattan (Manhattan data centers)
                        wallstreet (Wall Street center)

              Note: The parent page must be defined before you define the subparent. If not, the page  will  not
              be generated, and you get a message in the log file.

              Note: xymongen is case-sensitive, when trying to match the name of the parent page.

              The  inspiration  for  this  came from Craig Cook's mkbb.pl script, and I am grateful to Craig for
              suggesting that I implement it in xymongen. The idea to explicitly list the  parent  page  in  the
              "subparent" tag was what made it easy to implement.

       vpage

       vsubpage

       vsubparent
              These  are page-definitions similar to the "page", "subpage" and "subparent" definitions. However,
              on these pages the rows are the tests, and the columns are the hosts (normal  pages  have  it  the
              other  way  around).  This is useful if you have a very large number of tests for a few hosts, and
              prefer to have them listed on a page that can be scrolled vertically.
              Note that the "group" directives have no effect on these types of pages.

       group [group-title]

       group-compress [group-title]
              Defines a group of hosts, that appear together on the web page, with a single header-line  listing
              all  of the columns. Hosts following the "group" line appear inside the group, until a new "group"
              or page-line is found. The two group-directives are handled identically by Xymon and xymongen, but
              both forms are allowed for backwards compatibility.

       group-sorted [group-title]
              Same as the "group" line, but will sort the hosts inside  the  group  so  they  appear  in  strict
              lexicographic order.

       group-only COLUMN1|COLUMN2|COLUMN3 [group-title]
              Same as the "group" and "group-compress" lines, but includes only the columns explicitly listed in
              the group. Any columns not listed will be ignored for these hosts.

       group-except COLUMN1|COLUMN2|COLUMN3 [group-title]
              Same  as  the  "group-only"  lines, but includes all columns EXCEPT those explicitly listed in the
              group. Any columns listed will be ignored for these hosts - all other columns are shown.

       title Page, group or host title text
              The "title" tag is used to put custom headings into the pages generated by xymongen, in  front  of
              page/subpage links, groups or hosts.

              The title tag operates on the next item in the hosts.cfg file following the title tag.

              If  a  title  tag  precedes a host entry, the title is shown just before the host is listed on the
              status page. The column headings present for the host will be repeated just after the heading.

              If a title tag precedes a group entry, the title is show just before the group on the status page.

              If a title tag precedes a page/subpage/subparent entry, the title text replaces the normal  "Pages
              hosted  locally"  heading  normally  inserted by Xymon. This appears on the page that links to the
              sub-pages, not on the sub-page itself. To get a custom heading on the sub-page, you  may  want  to
              use the "--pagetext-heading" when running <u><a href="../man1/xymongen.1.html">xymongen</a>(1)</u>

       NAME:hostname
              Overrides  the default hostname used on the overview web pages.  If "hostname" contains spaces, it
              must be enclosed in double quotes, e.g. NAME:"R&amp;D Oracle Server"

       CLIENT:hostname
              Defines an alias for a host, which  will  be  used  when  identifying  status  messages.  This  is
              typically  used  to  accommodate  a  local  client  that  sends in status reports with a different
              hostname, e.g. if you use hostnames with domains in your Xymon configuration, but the client is  a
              silly  Window box that does not include the hostname. Or vice-versa. Whatever the reason, this can
              be used to match status reports with the hosts you  define  in  your  hosts.cfg  file.  It  causes
              incoming  status  reports  with  the  specified hostname to be filed using the hostname defined in
              hosts.cfg.

       NOCOLUMNS:column[,column]
              Used to drop certain of the status columns generated by the Xymon client. <b>column</b> is  one  of  <b>cpu</b>,
              <b>disk</b>,  <b>files</b>, <b>memory</b>, <b>msgs</b>, <b>ports</b>, <b>procs</b>.  This setting stops these columns from being updated for
              the host. Note: If the columns already exist, you must use the <u><a href="../man1/xymon.1.html">xymon</a>(1)</u> utility to <b>drop</b>  them,  or
              they will go purple.

       COMMENT:Host comment
              Adds  a  small  text  after  the  hostname on the web page. This can be used to describe the host,
              without completely changing its display-name as the  NAME:  tag  does.  If  the  comment  includes
              whitespace, it must be in double-quotes, e.g. COMMENT:"Sun web server"

       DESCR:Hosttype:Description
              Define  some  informational  text  about the host. The "Hosttype" is a text describing the type of
              this device - "router", "switch", "hub", "server" etc. The "Description" is an informational  text
              that will be shown on the "Info" column page; this can e.g. be used to store information about the
              physical  location  of  the  device, contact persons etc. If the text contain whitespace, you must
              enclose it in double-quotes, e.g.  DESCR:"switch:4th floor Marketing switch"

       CLASS:Classname
              Force the host to belong to a specific class.  Class-names  are  used  when  configuring  log-file
              monitoring   (they   can  be  used  as  references  in  <u><a href="../man5/client-local.cfg.5.html">client-local.cfg</a>(5),</u>  <u><a href="../man5/analysis.cfg.5.html">analysis.cfg</a>(5)</u>  and
              <u><a href="../man5/alerts.cfg.5.html">alerts.cfg</a>(5)</u> to group log file checks or alerts). Normally, class-names  are  controlled  on  the
              client by starting the Xymon client with the "--class=Classname" option.  If you specify it in the
              hosts.cfg  file  on  the Xymon server, it overrides any class name that the client reports. If not
              set, then the host belongs to a class named by the operating system the Xymon  client  is  running
              on.

       dialup The  keyword  "dialup"  for  a  host  means  that it is OK for it to be off-line - this should not
              trigger an alert. All network tests will go "clear" upon failure, and  any  missing  reports  from
              e.g.  cpu- and disk-status will not go purple when they are not updated.

       nonongreen
              Ignore  this  host  on  the  "All  non-green" page. Even if it has an active alert, it will not be
              included in the "All non-green" page. This also removes the host from the event-log display.

       nodisp Ignore this host completely when generating the Xymon webpages.  Can be useful  for  monitoring  a
              host  without  having it show up on the webpages, e.g. because it is not yet in production use. Or
              for hiding a host that is shown only on a second pageset.

       TRENDS:[*,][![graph,...]]
              Defines the RRD graphs to include in the "trends"  column  generated  by  xymongen.   This  option
              syntax is complex.
              If  this  option  is not present, xymongen provides graphs matching the standard set of RRD files:
              la, disk, memory, users, vmstat, iostat, netstat, tcp, bind, apache, sendmail
              * If this option is specified, the list of graphs to include start out as being empty (no graphs).
              * To include all default graphs, use an asterisk.  E.g. "TRENDS:*"
              * To exclude a certain graph, specify it prefixed with '!'. E.g.  to see all graphs except  users:
              "TRENDS:*,!users"
              *  The  netstat,  vmstat  and  tcp  graphs have many "subgraphs".  Which of these are shown can be
              specified like this: "TRENDS:*,netstat:netstat2|netstat3,tcp:http|smtp|conn" This  will  show  all
              graphs,  but  instead  of  the  normal netstat graph, there will be two: The netstat2 and netstat3
              graphs. Instead of the combined tcp graphs showing all services, there will be three: One for each
              of the http, conn and smtp services.

       COMPACT:COLUMN=COLUMN1|COLUMN2|COLUMN3[,ditto]
              Collapses a series of statuses into a single column on the overview web page.

       INTERFACES:REGEXP
              On systems with multiple network interfaces, the operating system may report a number  of  network
              interface  where the statistics are of no interest. By default Xymon tracks and graphs the traffic
              on all network interfaces. This option defines a regular expression,  and  only  those  interfaces
              whose name matches the expression are tracked.

</pre><h4><b>XYMON</b> <b>TAGS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>THE</b> <b>CRITICAL</b> <b>SYSTEMS</b> <b>OVERVIEW</b> <b>PAGE</b></h4><pre>
       <b>NOTE:</b>  The  "NK"  set of tags is deprecated. They will be supported for Xymon 4.x, but will be dropped in
       version 5.  It is recommended that you move your critical systems view to the <u><a href="../man1/criticalview.cgi.1.html">criticalview.cgi</a>(1)</u> viewer,
       which has a separate configuration tool, <u><a href="../man1/criticaleditor.cgi.1.html">criticaleditor.cgi</a>(1)</u> with more facilities than the NK  tags  in
       hosts.cfg.

       xymongen  will  create  three  sets  of  pages: The main page xymon.html, the all-non-green-statuses page
       (nongreen.html),  and  a  specially  reduced  version  of  nongreen.html   with   only   selected   tests
       (critical.html).  This page includes selected tests that currently have a red or yellow status.

       NK:testname[,testname]
              NOTE: This has been deprecated, you should use <u><a href="../man1/criticalview.cgi.1.html">criticalview.cgi</a>(1)</u> instead of the NK tag.

              Define  the  tests that you want included on the critical page.  E.g. if you have a host where you
              only want to see the http tests on critical.html, you specify it as

                12.34.56.78  www.acme.com  # <a href="http://www.acme.com/">http://www.acme.com/</a> NK:http

              If you want multiple tests for a host to show up on the critical.html page, specify all the  tests
              separated by commas.  The test names correspond to the column names (e.g.  https tests are covered
              by an "NK:http" tag).

       NKTIME=day:starttime:endtime[,day:starttime:endtime]
              This tag limits the time when an active alert is presented on the NK web page.

              By default, tests with a red or yellow status that are listed in the "NK:testname" tag will appear
              on  the  NK page. However, you may not want the test to be shown outside of normal working hours -
              if, for example, the host is not being serviced during week-ends.

              You can then use the NKTIME tag to define the time periods where the alert will show up on the  NK
              page.

              The time specification consists of

              <b>day-of-week:</b> <b>W</b> means Mon-Fri ("weekdays"), <b>*</b> means all days, <b>0</b> .. <b>6</b> = Sunday .. Saturday.  Listing
              multiple days is possible, e.g. "60" is valid meaning "Saturday and Sunday".

              <b>starttime:</b>  Time  to  start showing errors, must be in 24-hour clock format as HHMM hours/minutes.
              E.g. for 8 am enter "0800", for 9.30 pm enter "2130"

              <b>endtime:</b> Time to stop showing errors.

              If necessary, multiple periods can be specified. E.g. to monitor a site 24x7, except between  noon
              and 1 pm, use NKTIME=*:0000:1159,*:1300:2359

              The  interval  between start time and end time may cross midnight, e.g. <b>*:2330:0200</b> would be valid
              and have the same effect as <b>*:2330:2400,*:0000:0200</b>.

</pre><h4><b>XYMON</b> <b>TAGS</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>THE</b> <b>WML</b> <b>(WAP)</b> <b>CARDS</b></h4><pre>
       If xymongen is run with the "--wml" option, it will generate a set of WAP-format output "cards" that  can
       be viewed with a WAP-capable device, e.g. a PDA or cell-phone.

       WML:[+|-]testname[,[+|-]testname]
              This  tag  determines  which  tests  for  this hosts are included in the WML (WAP) page. Syntax is
              identical to the NK: tag.

              The default set of WML tests are taken from the --wml command line option.  If no  "WML:"  tag  is
              specified, the "NK:" tag is used if present.

</pre><h4><b>XYMON</b> <b>STATUS</b> <b>PROPAGATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These  tags  affect  how  a status propagates upwards from a single test to the page and higher. This can
       also be done with the command-line  options  --nopropyellow  and  --nopropred,  but  the  tags  apply  to
       individual hosts, whereas the command line options are global.

       NOPROPRED:[+|-]testname[,[+|-]testname]
              This  tag  is  used  to inhibit a yellow or red status from propagating upwards - i.e. from a test
              status color to the (sub)page status color, and further on to xymon.html or nongreen.html

              If a host-specific tag begins with a '-' or a '+', the host-specific tags are removed/added to the
              default setting from the command-line option. If the host-specific tag does not begin with  a  '+'
              or  a  '-',  the  default  setting is ignored for this host and the NOPROPRED applies to the tests
              given with this tag.

              E.g.: xymongen runs with "--nopropred=ftp,smtp".  "NOPROPRED:+dns,-smtp" gives a NOPROPRED setting
              of "ftp,dns" (dns is added to the default, smtp is removed).  "NOPROPRED:dns" gives a  setting  of
              "dns" only (the default is ignored).

              Note: If you set use the "--nopropred=*" command line option to disable propagation of all alerts,
              you  cannot  use the "+" and "-" methods to add or remove from the wildcard setting. In that case,
              do not use the "+" or "-" setting, but simply list the required tests that you want to  keep  from
              propagating.

       NOPROPYELLOW:[+|-]testname[,[+|-]testname]
              Similar to NOPROPRED: tag, but applies to propagating a yellow status upwards.

       NOPROPPURPLE:[+|-]testname[,[+|-]testname]
              Similar to NOPROPRED: tag, but applies to propagating a purple status upwards.

       NOPROPACK:[+|-]testname[,[+|-]testname]
              Similar to NOPROPRED: tag, but applies to propagating an acknowledged status upwards.

</pre><h4><b>XYMON</b> <b>AVAILABILITY</b> <b>REPORT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       These  options affect the way the Xymon availability reports are processed (see <u><a href="../man1/report.cgi.1.html">report.cgi</a>(1)</u> for details
       about availability reports).

       REPORTTIME=day:starttime:endtime[,day:starttime:endtime]
              This tag defines the time interval where you measure uptime of a service for reporting purposes.

              When xymongen generates a report, it  computes  the  availability  of  each  service  -  i.e.  the
              percentage of time that the service is reported as available (meaning: not red).

              By  default,  this  calculation  is  done  on a 24x7 basis, so no matter when an outage occurs, it
              counts as downtime.

              The REPORTTIME tag allows you to specify a  period  of  time  other  than  24x7  for  the  service
              availability  calculation.   If you have systems where you only guarantee availability from e.g. 7
              AM to 8 PM on weekdays, you can use
                REPORTTIME=W:0700:2000
              and the availability calculation will only be performed for the  service  with  measurements  from
              this time interval.

              The syntax for REPORTTIME is the same as the one used by the NKTIME parameter.

              When REPORTTIME is specified, the availability calculation happens like this:

              * Only measurements done during the given time period is used for the calculation.
              *  "blue"  time reduces the length of the report interval, so if you are generating a report for a
              10-hour period and there are 20 minutes of "blue" time, then  the  availability  calculation  will
              consider  the  reporting period to be 580 minutes (10 hours minus 20 minutes).  This allows you to
              have scheduled downtime during the REPORTTIME interval without hurting your availability; this  is
              (I believe) the whole idea of the downtime being "planned".
              * "red" and "clear" status counts as downtime; "yellow" and "green" count as uptime. "purple" time
              is ignored.

              The  availability calculation correctly handles status changes that cross into/out of a REPORTTIME
              interval.

              If no REPORTTIME is given, the standard 24x7 calculation is used.

       WARNPCT:percentage
              Xymon's reporting facility uses a computed availability threshold to color  services  green  (100%
              available), yellow (above threshold, but less than 100%), or red (below threshold) in the reports.

              This  option  allows  you  to  set the threshold value on a host-by-host basis, instead of using a
              global setting for all hosts. The threshold is defined as the percentage of the time that the host
              must be available, e.g. "WARNPCT:98.5" if you want the threshold to be at 98.5%

       noflap[=test1,test2,...]
              Disable flap detection for this host, or for specific  tests  on  this  host.  Flap  detection  is
              globally  controlled  by  options  given to xymond on the command line, but, if enabled, it can be
              disabled using this option.

</pre><h4><b>NETWORK</b> <b>TEST</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       testip By default, Xymon will perform a name lookup of the hostname to get the IP address it will use for
              network tests. This tag causes Xymon to use the IP listed in the hosts.cfg file.

       NET:location
              This tag defines the host as being tested from a specific location.  If  xymonnet  sees  that  the
              environment  variable  XYMONNETWORK  is  set,  it  will  only  test the hosts that have a matching
              "NET:location" tag in the hosts.cfg file. So this tag is useful if you have more than  one  system
              running  network  tests,  but  you  still  want to keep a consolidated hosts.cfg file for all your
              systems.

              Note: The "--test-untagged" option modifies this behaviour, see <u><a href="../man1/xymonnet.1.html">xymonnet</a>(1)</u>

       noclear
              Some network tests depend on others. E.g. if the host does not respond to  ping,  then  there's  a
              good chance that the entire host is down and all network tests will fail. Or if the http server is
              down, then any web content checks are also likely to fail.  To avoid floods of alerts, the default
              behaviour is for xymonnet to change the status of these tests that fail because of another problem
              to  "clear"  instead  of  "red".  The "noclear" tag disables this behaviour and causes all failing
              tests to be reported with their true color.

              This behaviour can also be implemented on a per-test basis by putting the "~" flag on any  network
              test.

              Note  that  "noclear" also affects whether stale status messages from e.g. a client on the host go
              purple or clear when the host is down; see the "noclear"  description  in  the  "GENERAL  PER-HOST
              OPTIONS" section above.

       nosslcert
              Disables  the  standard check of any SSL certificates for this host. By default, if an SSL-enabled
              service is tested, a second test result is generated with information about the SSL certificate  -
              this tag disables the SSL certificate checks for the host.

       ssldays=WARNDAYS:ALARMDAYS
              Define  the  number of days before an SSL certificate expires, in which the sslcert status shows a
              warning (yellow) or alarm (red) status. These default to  the  values  from  the  "--sslwarn"  and
              "--sslalarm" options for the <u><a href="../man1/xymonnet.1.html">xymonnet</a>(1)</u> tool; the values specified in the "ssldays" tag overrides
              the default.

       sslbits=MINIMUMKEYBITS
              Enable  checking  of  the  encryption  strength  of the SSL protocol offered by the server. If the
              server offers encryption using a key with fewer than MINIMUMKEYBITS bits, the "sslcert" test  will
              go  red.  E.g.  to  check  that  your server only uses strong encryption (128 bits or better), use
              "sslbits=128".

       sni

       nosni  Enables or disables use of SNI (Server Name Indication) for SSL tests.

              Some SSL implementations cannot handle SSL handshakes with SNI data, so Xymon by default does  not
              use  SNI.  This  default  can  be  changed with the "--sni" option for <u><a href="../man1/xymonnet.1.html">xymonnet</a>(1)</u> but can also be
              managed per host with these tags.

              SNI support was added in Xymon 4.3.13, where the default was to  use  SNI.  This  was  changed  in
              4.3.14  so  SNI  support  is  disabled  by default, and the "sni" and "nosni" tags were introduced
              together with the "--sni" option for xymonnet.

       DOWNTIME=day:starttime:endtime[,day:starttime:endtime]

       DOWNTIME=columns:day:starttime:endtime:cause[,columns:day:starttime:endtime:cause]
              This tag can be used to ignore failed checks during specific times of the day - e.g.  if  you  run
              services  that are only monitored e.g. Mon-Fri 8am-5pm, or you always reboot a server every Monday
              between 5 and 6 pm.

              What happens is that if a test fails during the specified time, it is reported  with  status  BLUE
              instead  of  red,  yellow, or purple. Thus you can still see when the service was unavailable, but
              alarms will not be triggered and the downtime is not  counted  in  the  availability  calculations
              generated by the Xymon reports.

              The  "columns" and "cause" settings are optional, but both or neither must be specified. "columns"
              may be a comma-separated list of status columns to which DOWNTIME will apply.  The "cause"  string
              will be displayed on the status web page to explain why the system is down.

              The syntax for DOWNTIME is the same as the one used by the NKTIME parameter.

       SLA=day:starttime:endtime[,day:starttime:endtime]
              This tag is now deprecated. Use the DOWNTIME tag instead.

              This  tag  works  the  opposite of the DOWNTIME tag - you use it to specify the periods of the day
              that the service should be green. Failures OUTSIDE the SLA interval are reported as blue.

       depends=(testA:host1/test1,host2/test2),(testB:host3/test3),[...]
              This tag allows you to define dependencies between tests.  If "testA" for the current host depends
              on "test1" for host "host1" and test "test2" for "host2", this can be defined with

                 depends=(testA:host1/test1,host2/test2)

              When deciding the color to report for testA, if either host1/test1 failed or  host2/test2  failed,
              if testA has failed also then the color of testA will be "clear" instead of red or yellow.

              Since  all tests are actually run before the dependencies are evaluated, you can use any host/test
              in the dependency - regardless of the actual sequence that the hosts are listed, or the tests run.
              It is also valid to use tests from the same host that the dependency is for. E.g.

                 1.2.3.4  foo # <a href="http://foo/">http://foo/</a> webmin depends=(webmin:foo/http)

              is valid; if both the http and the webmin tests fail, then webmin will be reported as clear.

              Note: The "depends" tag is evaluated by xymonnet while running the network tests. It can therefore
              only refer to other network tests that are handled by the same server - there is currently no  way
              to  use  the  e.g.  the  status of locally run tests (disk, cpu, msgs) or network tests from other
              servers in a dependency definition. Such dependencies are silently ignored.

       badTEST[-weekdays-starttime-endtime]:x:y:z
              NOTE: This has been deprecated, use the <b>delayred</b> and <b>delayyellow</b> settings instead.

              Normally when a network test fails, the status changes to red immediately.  With a "badTEST:x:y:z"
              tag this behaviour changes:
              * While "z" or more successive tests fail, the column goes RED.
              * While "y" or more successive tests fail, but fewer than "z", the column goes YELLOW.
              * While "x" or more successive tests fail, but fewer than "y", the column goes CLEAR.
              * While fewer than "x" successive tests fail, the column stays GREEN.

              The optional time specification can be used to limit this "badTEST" setting to a  particular  time
              of  day,  e.g. to require a longer period of downtime before raising an alarm during out-of-office
              hours. The time-specification uses:
              * Weekdays: The weekdays this badTEST tag applies, from 0 (Sunday) through 6  (Saturday).  Putting
              "W"  here  counts  as  "12345",  i.e. all working days. Putting "*" here counts as all days of the
              week, equivalent to "0123456".
              * start time and end time are specified using 24-hour clocks, e.g. "badTEST-W-0900-2000" is  valid
              for working days between 9 AM (09:00) and 8 PM (20:00).

              When using multiple badTEST tags, the LAST one specified with a matching time-spec is used.

              Note: The "TEST" is replaced by the name of the test, e.g.

               12.34.56.78  www.foo.com  # <a href="http://www.foo.com/">http://www.foo.com/</a> badhttp:1:2:4

              defines  a  http  test  that  goes  "clear" after the first failure, "yellow" after two successive
              failures, and "red" after four successive failures.

              For LDAP tests using URL's, use the  option  "badldapurl".   For  the  other  network  tests,  use
              "badftp", "badssh" etc.

</pre><h4><b>CONNECTIVITY</b> <b>(PING)</b> <b>TEST</b></h4><pre>
       These tags affect the behaviour of the xymonnet connectivity test.

       noping Disables  the  ping-test, but will keep the "conn" column on the web display with a notice that it
              has been disabled.

       noconn Disables the ping-test, and does not put a "conn" column on the web display.

       conn   The "conn" test (which does a ping of the host) is enabled for all hosts by default, and  normally
              you  just  want  to disable it using "noconn" or "noping". However, on the rare occasion where you
              may want to check that a host is NOT up, you can specify it as  an  explicit  test,  and  use  the
              normal  test  modifiers,  e.g.  "!conn"  will be green when the host is NOT up, and red if it does
              appear on the network.

              The actual name of the tag - "conn" by default -  depends  on  the  "--ping=TESTNAME"  option  for
              xymonnet, as that decides the testname for the connectivity test.

       conn={best,|worst,}IP1[,IP2...]
              This  adds  additional  IP-addresses  that are pinged during the normal "conn" test. So the normal
              "conn" test must be enabled (the default) before this tag has any effect. The IP-addresses  listed
              here are pinged in addition to the main IP-address.

              When multiple IP's are pinged, you can choose if ALL IP's must respond (the "worst" method), or AT
              LEAST  one  IP  must respond (the "best" setting). All of the IP's are reported in a single "conn"
              status, whose color is determined from the result of pinging the IP's and the best/worst  setting.
              The default method is "best" - so it will report green if just one of the IP's respond to ping.

       badconn[-weekdays-starttime-endtime]:x:y:z
              This  is  taken directly from the "fping.sh" connectivity- testing script, and is used by xymonnet
              when it runs with ping testing enabled (the default). See the description of the "badTEST" tag.

       route:router1,router2,....
              This tag is taken from the "fping.sh" script, and is used by xymonnet when run with  the  "--ping"
              option to enable ping testing.

              The  router1,router2,...  is  a comma-separated list of hosts elsewhere in the hosts.cfg file. You
              cannot have any spaces in the list - separate hosts with commas.

              This tag changes the color reported for a ping check that fails, when one or more of the hosts  in
              the  "route"  list is also down. A "red" status becomes "yellow" - other colors are unchanged. The
              status message will include information about the hosts in the router-list that are down,  to  aid
              tracking down which router is the root cause of the problem.

              Note:  Internally,  the ping test will still be handled as "failed", and therefore any other tests
              run for this host will report a status of "clear".

       route_LOCATION:router1,router2,...
              If the XYMONNETWORK environment variable is defined, a tag of "route_XYMONNETWORK:" is  recognized
              by  xymonnet with the same effect as the normal "route:" tag (see above).  This allows you to have
              different route: tags for each server running xymonnet. The actual text  for  the  tag  then  must
              match  the  value  you  have  for  the  XYMONNETWORK setting.  E.g. with XYMONNETWORK=dmz, the tag
              becomes "route_dmz:"

       trace  If the connectivity test fails, run a "traceroute" and include the output from this in the  status
              message  from  the  failed  connectivity  test. Note: For this to work, you may have to define the
              TRACEROUTE environment variable, see <u><a href="../man5/xymonserver.cfg.5.html">xymonserver.cfg</a>(5)</u>

       notrace
              Similar to the "trace" option, this disables the running of a traceroute  for  the  host  after  a
              failed  connectivity  test.  It  is  only  used  if running traceroute is made the default via the
              --trace option.

</pre><h4><b>SIMPLE</b> <b>NETWORK</b> <b>TESTS</b></h4><pre>
       These tests perform a simple network test of a service by connecting to the port  and  possibly  checking
       that a banner is shown by the server.

       How  these  tests operate are configured in the <u><a href="../man5/protocols.cfg.5.html">protocols.cfg</a>(5)</u> configuration file, which controls which
       port to use for the service, whether to send any data to the service, whether to  check  for  a  response
       from the service etc.

       You  can  modify  the behaviour of these tests on a per-test basis by adding one or more modifiers to the
       test: <b>:NUMBER</b> changes the port number from the default to the one you specify for  this  test.   E.g.  to
       test ssh running on port 8022, specify the test as <b>ssh:8022</b>.

       <b>:s</b>  makes  the test silent, i.e. it does not send any data to the service. E.g. to do a silent test of an
       smtp server, enter <b>smtp:s</b>.

       You can combine these two: <b>ftp:8021:s</b> is valid.

       If you must test a service from a multi-homed host (i.e. using a specific source  IP-address  instead  of
       the  one  your  operating  system provides), you can use the modifier "@IPADDRESS" at the end of the test
       specification, <b>after</b> any other modifiers or port number.  "IPADDRESS" must be a valid  dotted  IP-address
       (not hostname) which is assigned to the host running the network tests.

       The  name  of the test also determines the column name that the test result will appear with in the Xymon
       webpages.

       By prefixing a test with "!" it becomes a  reverse  test:  Xymon  will  expect  the  service  NOT  to  be
       available,  and  send a green status if it does NOT respond. If a connection to the service succeeds, the
       status will go red.

       By prefixing a test with "?" errors will be reported with a "clear" status instead of red. This is  known
       as  a  test  for  a  "dialup"  service,  and allows you to run tests of hosts that are not always online,
       without getting alarms while they are off-line.

       ftp ssh telnet smtp pop3 imap nntp rsync clamd oratns qmtp qmqp
              These tags are for testing services offering the FTP, Secure Shell (ssh), SMTP, POP3, IMAP,  NNTP,
              rsync,  CLAM  anti-virus  daemon  (clamd),  Oracle  TNS  listener  (oratns),  qmail  QMTP and QMQP
              protocols.

       ftps telnets smtps pop3s imaps nntps
              These tags are for testing of the SSL-tunneled versions of the standard ftp, telnet,  smtp,  pop3,
              imap  and  nntp  protocols.   If  Xymon  was  configured  with support for SSL, you can test these
              services like any other network service - xymonnet  will  setup  an  SSL-encrypted  session  while
              testing  the  service.   The  server certificate is validated and information about it sent in the
              "sslcert" column. Note that smtps does not have a standard port number  assignment,  so  you  will
              need to enter this into the protocols.cfg file or your <a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a> file.

       bbd    Test  that  a  Big  Brother  compatible  daemon  is  running.  This check works both for the Xymon
              <u><a href="../man8/xymond.8.html">xymond</a>(8)</u> daemon, and the original Big Brother bbd daemon.

</pre><h4><b>DNS</b> <b>SERVER</b> <b>TESTS</b></h4><pre>
       These tags are used to setup monitoring of DNS servers.

       dns    Simple DNS test. It will attempt to lookup the A record for the hostname of the DNS server.

       dig    This is an alias for the  "dns"  test.  In  xymonnet,  the  "dns"  and  "dig"  tests  are  handled
              identically,  so all of the facilities for testing described for the "dns" test are also available
              for the "dig" test.

       dns=hostname

       dns=TYPE:lookup[,TYPE:lookup...]
              The default DNS tests will attempt a DNS lookup of the DNS' servers own hostname. You can  specify
              the hostname to lookup on a DNS server by listing it on each test.

              The  second  form of the test allows you to perform multiple queries of the DNS server, requesting
              different types of DNS records. The TYPE defines the type of DNS data: A  (IP-address),  MX  (Mail
              eXchanger), PTR (reverse), CNAME (alias), SOA (Start-Of-Authority), NS (Name Server) are among the
              more  common ones used. The "lookup" is the query. E.g. to lookup the MX records for the "foo.com"
              domain, you would use "dns=mx:foo.com". Or to lookup the nameservers  for  the  "bar.org"  domain,
              "dns=ns:bar.org".  You can list multiple lookups, separated by commas. For the test to end up with
              a green status, all lookups must succeed.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>NETWORK</b> <b>TESTS</b></h4><pre>
       ntp    Check  for a running NTP (Network Time Protocol) server on this host. This test uses the "ntpdate"
              utility to check for a NTP server - you should either have  ntpdate  in  your  PATH,  or  set  the
              location of the ntpdate program in $XYMONHOME/etc/xymonserver.cfg

       rpc[=rpcservice1,rpcservice2,...]
              Check  for  one or more available RPC services. This check is indirect in that it only queries the
              RPC Portmapper on the host, not the actual service.

              If only "rpc" is given, the test only verifies that the port mapper is  available  on  the  remote
              host. If you want to check that one or more RPC services are registered with the port mapper, list
              the  names  of  the  desired RPC services after the equals-sign. E.g. for a working NFS server the
              "mount",  "nlockmgr"  and  "nfs"  services  must  be  available;  this   can   be   checked   with
              "rpc=mount,nlockmgr,nfs".

              This  test uses the rpcinfo tool for the actual test; if this tool is not available in the PATH of
              xymonnet,  you  must  define  the  RPCINFO  environment  variable  to  point  at  this  tool.  See
              <u><a href="../man5/xymonserver.cfg.5.html">xymonserver.cfg</a>(5)</u>

</pre><h4><b>HTTP</b> <b>TESTS</b></h4><pre>
       Simple  testing  of  a http URL is done simply by putting the URL into the hosts.cfg file. Note that this
       only applies to URL's that begin with "http:" or "https:".

       The following items describe more advanced forms of http URL's.

       Basic Authentication with username/password
              If the URL requires authentication in the form of a username and password, it is most likely using
              the HTTP "Basic" authentication. xymonnet support this, and  you  can  provide  the  username  and
              password either by embedding them in the URL e.g.
                  <a href="http://USERNAME">http://USERNAME</a>:<a href="mailto:PASSWORD@www.sample.com">PASSWORD@www.sample.com</a>/
              or by putting the username and password into the <a href="file:~/.netrc">~/.netrc</a> file (see <u><a href="../man1/ftp.1.html">ftp</a>(1)</u> for details).

       Authentication with SSL client certificates
              An  SSL  client  certificate  can be used for authentication.  To use this, the client certificate
              must be stored in  a  PEM-formatted  file  together  with  the  client  certificate  key,  in  the
              $XYMONHOME/certs/ directory. The URL is then given as
                  <a href="http://CERT">http://CERT</a>:<a href="mailto:FILENAME@www.sample.com">FILENAME@www.sample.com</a>/
              The  "CERT:"  part  is  literal  -  i.e. you write C-E-R-T-colon and then the filename of the PEM-
              formatted certificate.
              A PEM-formatted certificate file can be  generated  based  on  certificates  stored  in  Microsoft
              Internet Explorer and OpenSSL. Do as follows:
              From the MSIE Tools-Options menu, pick the Content tab, click on Certificates, choose the Personal
              tab,  select  the  certificate and click Export. Make sure you export the private key also. In the
              Export File Format, choose PKCS 12 (.PFX), check  the  "Include  all  certificates"  checkbox  and
              uncheck  the  "Enable strong protection".  Provide a temporary password for the exported file, and
              select a filename for the PFX-file.
              Now run "openssl pkcs12 -in file.pfx -out file.pem". When  prompted  for  the  "Import  Password",
              provide  the  temporary password you gave when exporting the certificate. Then provide a "PEM pass
              phrase" (twice) when prompted for one.
              The file.pem file is the one you should use in the FILENAME field in the URL - this file  must  be
              kept  in  $XYMONHOME/certs/.   The  PEM  pass phrase must be put into a file named the same as the
              certificate,  but  with  extension  ".pass".  E.g.   if  you   have   the   PEM   certificate   in
              $XYMONHOME/certs/client.pem,  you  must  put the pass phrase into the $XYMONHOME/certs/client.pass
              file. Make sure to protect this file with Unix permissions, so that only the  user  running  Xymon
              can read it.

       Forcing an HTTP or SSL version
              Some  SSL  sites  will  only  allow you to connect, if you use specific "dialects" of HTTP or SSL.
              Normally this is auto-negotiated, but experience shows that this fails on some systems.

              xymonnet can be told to use specific dialects, by adding one or more "dialect names"  to  the  URL
              scheme, i.e. the "http" or "https" in the URL:

              * "2",  e.g. https2://www.sample.com/ : use only SSLv2
              * "3",  e.g. https3://www.sample.com/ : use only SSLv3
              * "t",  e.g. httpst://www.sample.com/ : use only TLSv1.0
              * "a",  e.g. httpsa://www.sample.com/ : use only TLSv1.0
              * "b",  e.g. httpsb://www.sample.com/ : use only TLSv1.1
              * "c",  e.g. httpsc://www.sample.com/ : use only TLSv1.2
              * "m",  e.g. httpsm://www.sample.com/ : use only 128-bit ciphers
              * "h",  e.g. httpsh://www.sample.com/ : use only &gt;128-bit ciphers
              * "10", e.g. http10://www.sample.com/ : use HTTP 1.0
              * "11", e.g. http11://www.sample.com/ : use HTTP 1.1

              These  can  be  combined  where  it  makes  sense,  e.g to force TLS1.2 and HTTP 1.0 you would use
              "httpsc10".

              Note that SSLv2 support is disabled in all current OpenSSL releases.  TLS version-specific  scheme
              testing requires OpenSSL 1.0.1 or higher.

       Testing sites by IP-address
              xymonnet  ignores  the  "testip"  tag normally used to force a test to use the IP-address from the
              hosts.cfg file instead of the hostname, when it performs http and https tests.

              The reason for this is that it interacts badly with virtual hosts, especially  if  these  are  IP-
              based as is common with https-websites.

              Instead the IP-address to connect to can be overridden by specifying it as:

                   <a href="http://www.sample.com">http://www.sample.com</a>=1.2.3.4/index.html

              The  "=1.2.3.4"  will  case  xymonnet  to run the test against the IP-address "1.2.3.4", but still
              trying to access a virtual website with the name "www.sample.com".

              The "=ip.address.of.host" must be the last part of the hostname, so if you need  to  combine  this
              with e.g. an explicit port number, it should be done as

                   <a href="http://www.sample.com">http://www.sample.com</a>:3128=1.2.3.4/index.html

       HTTP Testing via proxy
              <b>NOTE:</b>  This  is  not  enabled by default. You must add the "--bb-proxy-syntax" option when running
              <u><a href="../man1/xymonnet.1.html">xymonnet</a>(1)</u> if you want to use this.

              xymonnet supports the Big Brother syntax for specifying an HTTP proxy to use when performing  http
              tests. This syntax just joins the proxy- and the target-URL into one, e.g.
                  <a href="http://webproxy.sample.com">http://webproxy.sample.com</a>:3128/<a href="http://www.foo.com/">http://www.foo.com/</a>
              would   be   the   syntax   for   testing  the  www.foo.com  website  via  the  proxy  running  on
              "webproxy.sample.com" port 3128.

              If the proxy port number is not specified, the default HTTP port number (80) is used.

              If your proxy requires authentication, you can specify the username and password inside the proxy-
              part of the URL, e.g.
                  <a href="http://fred">http://fred</a>:<a href="mailto:Wilma1@webproxy.sample.com">Wilma1@webproxy.sample.com</a>:3128/<a href="http://www.foo.com/">http://www.foo.com/</a>
              will authenticate to the proxy using a username of "fred"  and  a  password  of  "Wilma1",  before
              requesting the proxy to fetch the www.foo.com homepage.

              Note  that it is not possible to test https-sites via a proxy, nor is it possible to use https for
              connecting to the proxy itself.

       cont[=COLUMN];URL;[expected_data_regexp|#digesttype:digest]
              This tag is used to specify a http/https check, where it is also checked that specific content  is
              present in the server response.

              If  the  URL  itself  includes a semi-colon, this must be escaped as '%3B' to avoid confusion over
              which semicolon is part of the URL, and which semicolon acts as a delimiter.

              The data that must be returned can be specified  either  as  a  regular  expression  (except  that
              &lt;space&gt; is not allowed) or as a message digest (typically using an MD5 sum or SHA-1 hash).

              The regex is pre-processed for backslash "\" escape sequences. So you can really put any character
              in this string by escaping it first:
                 \n     Newline (LF, ASCII 10 decimal)
                 \r     Carriage return (CR, ASCII 13 decimal)
                 \t     TAB (ASCII 8 decimal)
                 \\    Backslash (ASCII 92 decimal)
                 \XX    The character with ASCII hex-value XX

              If you must have whitespace in the regex, use the [[:space:]] syntax, e.g. if you want to test for
              the  string  "All  is OK", use "All[[:space:]]is[[:space:]]OK".  Note that this may depend on your
              particular implementation of the regex functions found in your C library. Thanks to Charles Goyard
              for this tip.

              Note: If you are migrating from the "cont2.sh" script, you must change the '_' used  as  wildcards
              by cont2.sh into '.' which is the regular-expression wildcard character.

              Message digests can use whatever digest algorithms your libcrypto implementation (usually OpenSSL)
              supports.   Common  message  digests  are  "md5",  "sha1",  "sha256"  or  "sha512".  The digest is
              calculated on the data portion of the response from the server, i.e. HTTP headers are not included
              in the digest (as they change from one request to the next).

              The expected digest value can be computed with the <u><a href="../man1/xymondigest.1.html">xymondigest</a>(1)</u> utility.

              "cont" tags in hosts.cfg result in two status reports: One  status  with  the  "http"  check,  and
              another with the "content" check.

              As  with normal URL's, the extended syntax described above can be used e.g. when testing SSL sites
              that require the use of SSLv2 or strong ciphers.

              The column name for the result of the content check is by  default  called  "content"  -  you  can
              change the default with the "--content=NAME" option to xymonnet. See <u><a href="../man1/xymonnet.1.html">xymonnet</a>(1)</u> for a description
              of this option.

              If  more  than one content check is present for a host, the first content check is reported in the
              column "content", the second is reported in the column "content1", the third in "content2" etc.

              You can also specify the column name  directly  in  the  test  specification,  by  writing  it  as
              "cont=COLUMN;http://...".  Column-names cannot include whitespace or semi-colon.

              The  content-check  status  by default includes the full URL that was requested, and the HTML data
              returned by the server.  You can hide the HTML data on a per-host (not per-test) basis  by  adding
              the <b>HIDEHTTP</b> tag to the host entry.

       content=URL
              This syntax is deprecated. You should use the "cont" tag instead, see above.

       post[=COLUMN];URL;form-data;[expected_data_regexp|#digesttype:digest]
              This  tag can be used to test web pages, that use an input form. Data can be posted to the form by
              specifying them in the form-data field, and the result can be  checked  as  if  it  was  a  normal
              content  check  (see  above  for a description of the cont-tag and the restrictions on how the URL
              must be written).

              The form-data field must be entered in "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" format,  which  is  the
              most commonly used format for web forms.

              E.g. if you have a web form defined like this:

                 &lt;form action="/cgi-bin/form.cgi" method="post"&gt;
                   &lt;p&gt;Given name&lt;input type="text" name="givenname"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                   &lt;p&gt;Surname&lt;input type="text" name="surname"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                   &lt;input type="submit" value="Send"&gt;
                 &lt;/form&gt;

              and  you  want to post the value "John" to the first field and "Doe Jr." to the second field, then
              the form data field would be

                  givenname=John&amp;surname=Doe+Jr.

              Note that any spaces in the input value is replaced with '+'.

              If your form-data requires a different content-type, you can specify it by beginning the form-data
              with <b>(content-type=TYPE)</b>, e.g. "(content-type=text/xml)" followed by the POST data. Note  that  as
              with  normal  forms,  the  POST  data  should  be  specified  using  escape-sequences for reserved
              characters: "space" should be entered  as  "\x20",  double  quote  as  "\x22",  newline  as  "\n",
              carriage-return  as  "\r",  TAB  as  "\t", backslash as "\\".  Any byte value can be entered using
              "\xNN" with NN being the hexadecimal value, e.g. "\x20" is the space character.

              The [expected_data_regexp|#digesttype:digest] is the expected data returned  from  the  server  in
              response  to  the  POST.   See  the  "cont;"  tag above for details. If you are only interested in
              knowing if it is possible to submit the form (but don't care about the data), this can be an empty
              string - but the ';' at the end is required.

       nocont[=COLUMN];URL;forbidden_data_regexp
              This  tag  works  just  like  "cont"  tag,  but  reverses  the  test.   It  is  green   when   the
              "forbidden_data_regexp"  is NOT found in the response, and red when it IS found. So it can be used
              to watch for data that should NOT be present in the response, e.g. a server error message.

       nopost[=COLUMN];URL;form-data;expected_data_regexp
              This  tag  works  just  like  "post"  tag,  but  reverses  the  test.   It  is  green   when   the
              "forbidden_data_regexp"  is NOT found in the response, and red when it IS found. So it can be used
              to watch for data that should NOT be present in the response, e.g. a server error message.

       type[=COLUMN];URL;expected_content_type
              This is a variant of the content check - instead of checking the content data, it checks the  type
              of  the  data  as  given by the HTTP Content-Type: header. This can used to check if a URL returns
              e.g. a PDF file, regardless of what is inside the PDF file.

       soap[=COLUMN];URL;SOAPMESSAGE;[expected_data_regexp|#digesttype:digest]
              Send SOAP message over HTTP. This is identical to the "cont" test, except that the request sent to
              the server uses a Content-type of "application/soap+xml", and it also sends a "SOAPAction"  header
              with  the URL. SOAPMESSAGE is the SOAP message sent to the server. Since SOAP messages are usually
              XML documents, you can store this  in  a  separate  file  by  specifying  "file:FILENAME"  as  the
              SOAPMESSAGE parameter.  E.g. a test specification of
                  soap=echo;<a href="http://soap.foo.bar/baz">http://soap.foo.bar/baz</a>?wsdl;file:/home/foo/msg.xml;.   will  read  the SOAP message
              from the file /home/foo/msg.xml and post it to the URL <a href="http://soap.foo.bar/bas">http://soap.foo.bar/bas</a>?wsdl

              Note that SOAP XML documents usually must begin with the XML version line, <b>&lt;?xml</b> <b>version="1.0"&gt;</b>

       nosoap[=COLUMN];URL;SOAPMESSAGE;[forbidden_data_regexp|#digesttype:digest]
              This  tag  works  just  like  "soap"  tag,  but  reverses  the  test.   It  is  green   when   the
              "forbidden_data_regexp"  is NOT found in the response, and red when it IS found. So it can be used
              to watch for data that should NOT be present in the response, e.g. a server error message.

       httphead[=COLUMN];URL
              This is used to perform an HTTP HEAD request instead of a GET.

       httpstatus[=COLUMN];URL;okstatusexpr;notokstatusexpr
              This is used to explicitly test for certain HTTP statuscodes returned when the URL  is  requested.
              The  <b>okstatusexpr</b>  and  <b>nokokstatusexpr</b>  expressions are Perl-compatible regular expressions, e.g.
              "2..|302" will match all OK codes and the redirect  (302)  status  code.  If  the  URL  cannot  be
              retrieved, the status is "999".

       HIDEHTTP
              The  status  display  for  HTTP  checks  usually includes the URL, and for content checks also the
              actual data from the web page.  If you would like to hide these from view, then the  HIDEHTTP  tag
              will keep this information from showing up on the status webpages.

       headermatch
              Content  checks by default only search the HTML body returned by the webserver. This option causes
              it to also search the HTTP headers for the string that must / must not be present.

       browser=BROWSERNAME
              By default, Xymon sends an HTTP "User-Agent"  header  identifying  it  a  "Xymon".  Some  websites
              require that you use a specific browser, typically Internet Explorer. To cater for testing of such
              sites, this tag can be used to modify the data sent in the User-Agent header.
              E.g.  to  perform  an  HTTP  test with Xymon masquerading as an Internet Explorer 6.0 browser, use
              <b>browser="Mozilla/4.0</b> <b>(compatible;</b> <b>MSIE</b> <b>6.0;</b> <b>Windows</b> <b>NT</b>  <b>5.0)"</b>.   If  you  do  not  know  what  the
              User-Agent  header  should  be, open up the browser that works with this particular site, and open
              the URL "javascript:document.writeln(navigator.userAgent)" (just copy this  into  the  "Open  URL"
              dialog. The text that shows up is what the browser sends as the User-Agent header.

       httphdr=STRING
              Xymon  can  be send additional headers when performing HTTP checks, to allow for validation of any
              custom configurations needed for your site. Note that  this  is  a  host-wide  configuration.  The
              string  will be added directly to the headers for all URLs on that host. There is currently no way
              to have this occur only for specific URLs checked.
              The string should be encased in quotes, like <b>httphdr="X-Requested-With:</b> <b>XMLHttpRequest"</b>.  Newlines
              can be included, however the string MUST NOT end with a newline as that may cause premature ending
              of the headers sent.

</pre><h4><b>LDAP</b> <b>(DIRECTORY</b> <b>SERVER)</b> <b>TESTS</b></h4><pre>
       ldap

       ldaps  Simple check for an LDAP service.  This  check  merely  looks  for  any  service  running  on  the
              ldap/ldaps service port, but does not perform any actual LDAP transaction.

       ldap://hostport/dn[?attrs[?scope[?filter[?exts]]]]
              Check  for  an  LDAP service by performing an LDAP request. This tag is in the form of an LDAP URI
              (cf. RFC 2255). This type of LDAP test requires that <u><a href="../man1/xymonnet.1.html">xymonnet</a>(1)</u> was built with support for  LDAP,
              e.g. via the OpenLDAP library.  The components of the LDAP URI are:
                <u>hostport</u> is a host name with an optional ":portnumber"
                <u>dn</u> is the search base
                <u>attrs</u> is a comma separated list of attributes to request
                <u>scope</u> is one of these three strings:
                  base one sub (default=base)
                <u>filter</u> is filter
                <u>exts</u> are recognized set of LDAP and/or API extensions.

       ldaps://hostport/dn[?attrs[?scope[?filter[?exts]]]]
              LDAP  service  check  using  LDAPv3  and  STARTTLS for talking to an LDAP server that requires TLS
              encryption. See <u><a href="../man1/xymonnet.1.html">xymonnet</a>(1)</u> for a discussion of the different ways of running  LDAP  servers  with
              SSL/TLS, and which of these are supported by xymonnet.

       ldaplogin=username:password
              Define  a  username and password to use when binding to the LDAP server for ldap URI tests. If not
              specified, xymonnet will attempt an anonymous bind.

       ldapyellowfail
              Used with an LDAP URL test. If the LDAP query fails during the search of the directory,  the  ldap
              status  is  normally  reported  as  "red" (alarm). This tag reduces a search failure to a "yellow"
              (warning) status.

</pre><h4><b>PERFORMANCE</b> <b>MONITORING</b> <b>TESTS</b></h4><pre>
       apache[=URL]
              If you are running an Apache web server, adding this tag  makes  <u><a href="../man1/xymonnet.1.html">xymonnet</a>(1)</u>  collect  performance
              statistics      from      the      Apache      web      server     by     querying     the     URL
              <b><a href="http://IP.ADDRESS.OF.HOST/server-status">http://IP.ADDRESS.OF.HOST/server-status</a>?auto</b>.  The response is sent as a data-report and processed
              by the Xymon xymond_rrd module into an RRD file and an "apache" graph. If your web server requires
              e.g. authentication, or runs on a different URL for the server-status, you can  provide  the  full
              URL         needed        to        fetch        the        server-status        page,        e.g.
              <b>apache=<a href="http://LOGIN">http://LOGIN</a>:<a href="mailto:PASSWORD@10.0.0.1">PASSWORD@10.0.0.1</a>/server-status?auto</b> for a  password  protected  server-status
              page, or <b>apache=<a href="http://10.0.0.1">http://10.0.0.1</a>:8080/apache/server-status?auto</b> for a server listening on port 8080
              and with a different path to the server-status page.

              Note  that  you  need  to enable the server-status URL in your Apache configuration. The following
              configuration is needed:

                  &lt;Location /server-status&gt;
                      SetHandler server-status
                      Order deny,allow
                      Deny from all
                      allow from 127.0.0.1
                  &lt;/Location&gt;
                  ExtendedStatus On

              Change "127.0.0.1" to the IP-address of the server that runs your network tests.

</pre><h4><b>DEFAULT</b> <b>HOST</b></h4><pre>
       If you have certain tags that you want to apply to all hosts, you can define a host name ".default."  and
       put the tags on that host. Note that per-host definitions will override the default ones. To apply to all
       hosts this should be listed FIRST in your file.

       <b>NOTE:</b>  The  ".default."  host  entry  will  only accept the following tags - others are silently ignored:
       delayyellow, delayred, NOCOLUMNS, COMMENT, DESCR, CLASS,  dialup,  testip,  nonongreen,  nodisp,  noinfo,
       notrends,  noclient,  TRENDS, NOPROPRED, NOPROPYELLOW, NOPROPPURPLE, NOPROPACK, REPORTTIME, WARNPCT, NET,
       noclear, nosslcert, ssldays, DOWNTIME,  depends,  noping,  noconn,  trace,  notrace,  HIDEHTTP,  browser,
       pulldata.  Specifically,  note  that  network  tests, "badTEST" settings, and alternate pageset relations
       cannot be listed on the ".default." host.

</pre><h4><b>SENDING</b> <b>SUMMARIES</b> <b>TO</b> <b>REMOTE</b> <b>XYMON</b> <b>SERVERS</b></h4><pre>
       summary ROW.COLUMN IP URL
              If you have multiple Xymon servers, the "summary" directive lets you form a hierarchy  of  servers
              by sending the overall status of this server to a remote Xymon server, which then displays this in
              a  special  summary  section. E.g. if your offices are spread over three locations, you can have a
              Xymon server at each office. These branch-office  Xymon  have  a  "summary"  definition  in  their
              hosts.cfg  file  that  makes  them  report the overall status of their branch Xymon to the central
              Xymon server you maintain at the corporate headquarters.

              Multiple "summary" definitions are allowed.

              The ROW.COLUMN setting defines how this summary is presented  on  the  server  that  receives  the
              summary.  The  ROW text will be used as the heading for a summary line, and the COLUMN defines the
              name of the column where this summary is shown - like the hostname and testname used in the normal
              displays. The IP is the IP-address of the <b>remote</b> (upstream) Xymon server, where  this  summary  is
              sent). The URL is the URL of your <b>local</b> Xymon server.

              The  URL  need not be that of your Xymon server's main page - it could be the URL of a sub-page on
              the local Xymon server. Xymon will report the summary using the color of the page found at the URL
              you specify.  E.g. on your corporate Xymon server you want a summary from the Las Vegas  office  -
              but  you would like to know both what the overall status is, and what is the status of the servers
              on the critical Sales department back-office servers in Las Vegas. So you configure the Las  Vegas
              Xymon server to send <b>two</b> summaries:

                  summary Vegas.All 10.0.1.1 <a href="http://vegas.foo.com/xymon/">http://vegas.foo.com/xymon/</a>
                  summary Vegas.Sales 10.0.1.1 <a href="http://vegas.foo.com/xymon/sales/">http://vegas.foo.com/xymon/sales/</a>

              This  gives  you  one  summary  line  for Baltimore, with two columns: An "All" column showing the
              overall status, and a "Sales" column showing the status of the "sales" page on the Baltimore Xymon
              server.

              Note: Pages defined using alternate pageset definitions cannot be used, the URL must  point  to  a
              web page from the default set of Xymon webpages.

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>TAGS</b></h4><pre>
       pulldata[=[IP][:port]]
              This  option is recognized by the <u><a href="../man8/xymonfetch.8.html">xymonfetch</a>(8)</u> utility, and causes it to poll the host for client
              data. The optional IP-address and port-number can be used if the client-side <u><a href="../man8/msgcache.8.html">msgcache</a>(8)</u> daemon is
              listening on a non-standard IP-address or port-number.
