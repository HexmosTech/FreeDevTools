</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pacman.conf - pacman package manager configuration file

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/pacman.conf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Pacman, using <b><a href="../man3/libalpm.3.html">libalpm</a></b>(3), will attempt to read pacman.conf each time it is invoked. This configuration
       file is divided into sections or repositories. Each section defines a package repository that pacman can
       use when searching for packages in <u>--sync</u> mode. The exception to this is the options section, which
       defines global options.

       Comments are only supported by beginning a line with the hash (#) symbol. Comments cannot begin in the
       middle of a line.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
           #
           # pacman.conf
           #
           [options]
           NoUpgrade = etc/passwd etc/group etc/shadow
           NoUpgrade = etc/fstab

           [core]
           Include = /etc/pacman.d/core

           [custom]
           Server = file:///home/pkgs

           <b>Note</b>

           Each directive must be in CamelCase. If the case isn’t respected, the directive won’t be recognized.
           For example. noupgrade or NOUPGRADE will not work.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>RootDir</b> <b>=</b> /path/to/root/dir
           Set the default root directory for pacman to install to. This option is used if you want to install a
           package on a temporary mounted partition which is "owned" by another system, or for a chroot install.
           <b>NOTE</b>: If database path or log file are not specified on either the command line or in <b><a href="../man5/pacman.conf.5.html">pacman.conf</a></b>(5),
           their default location will be inside this root path.

       <b>DBPath</b> <b>=</b> /path/to/db/dir
           Overrides the default location of the toplevel database directory. The default is /var/lib/pacman/.
           Most users will not need to set this option.  <b>NOTE</b>: if specified, this is an absolute path and the
           root path is not automatically prepended.

       <b>CacheDir</b> <b>=</b> /path/to/cache/dir
           Overrides the default location of the package cache directory. The default is /var/cache/pacman/pkg/.
           Multiple cache directories can be specified, and they are tried in the order they are listed in the
           config file. If a file is not found in any cache directory, it will be downloaded to the first cache
           directory with write access.  <b>NOTE</b>: this is an absolute path, the root path is not automatically
           prepended.

       <b>HookDir</b> <b>=</b> /path/to/hook/dir
           Add directories to search for alpm hooks in addition to the system hook directory
           (/usr/share/libalpm/hooks/). The default is /etc/pacman.d/hooks. Multiple directories can be
           specified with hooks in later directories taking precedence over hooks in earlier directories.  <b>NOTE</b>:
           this is an absolute path, the root path is not automatically prepended. For more information on the
           alpm hooks, see <b><a href="../man5/alpm-hooks.5.html">alpm-hooks</a></b>(5).

       <b>GPGDir</b> <b>=</b> /path/to/gpg/dir
           Overrides the default location of the directory containing configuration files for GnuPG. The default
           is /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/. This directory should contain two files: pubring.gpg and trustdb.gpg.
           pubring.gpg holds the public keys of all packagers.  trustdb.gpg contains a so-called trust database,
           which specifies that the keys are authentic and trusted.  <b>NOTE</b>: this is an absolute path, the root
           path is not automatically prepended.

       <b>LogFile</b> <b>=</b> /path/to/log/file
           Overrides the default location of the pacman log file. The default is /var/log/pacman.log. This is an
           absolute path and the root directory is not prepended.

       <b>HoldPkg</b> <b>=</b> package ...
           If a user tries to <u>--remove</u> a package that’s listed in HoldPkg, pacman will ask for confirmation
           before proceeding. Shell-style glob patterns are allowed.

       <b>IgnorePkg</b> <b>=</b> package ...
           Instructs pacman to ignore any upgrades for this package when performing a <u>--sysupgrade</u>. Shell-style
           glob patterns are allowed.

       <b>IgnoreGroup</b> <b>=</b> group ...
           Instructs pacman to ignore any upgrades for all packages in this group when performing a
           <u>--sysupgrade</u>. Shell-style glob patterns are allowed.

       <b>Include</b> <b>=</b> /path/to/config/file
           Include another configuration file. This file can include repositories or general configuration
           options. Wildcards in the specified paths will get expanded based on <b><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a></b>(7) rules.

       <b>Architecture</b> <b>=</b> auto &amp;| i686 &amp;| x86_64 | ...
           If set, pacman will only allow installation of packages with the given architectures (e.g.  <u>i686</u>,
           <u>x86_64</u>, etc). The special value <u>auto</u> will use the system architecture, provided via “uname -m”. If
           unset, no architecture checks are made.  <b>NOTE</b>: Packages with the special architecture <u>any</u> can always
           be installed, as they are meant to be architecture independent.

       <b>XferCommand</b> <b>=</b> /path/to/command %u [%o]
           If set, an external program will be used to download all remote files. All instances of %u will be
           replaced with the download URL. If present, instances of %o will be replaced with the local filename,
           plus a “.part” extension, which allows programs like wget to do file resumes properly.

           This option is useful for users who experience problems with built-in HTTP/FTP support, or need the
           more advanced proxy support that comes with utilities like wget.

       <b>NoUpgrade</b> <b>=</b> file ...
           All files listed with a NoUpgrade directive will never be touched during a package install/upgrade,
           and the new files will be installed with a <u>.pacnew</u> extension. These files refer to files in the
           package archive, so do not include the leading slash (the RootDir) when specifying them. Shell-style
           glob patterns are allowed. It is possible to invert matches by prepending a file with an exclamation
           mark. Inverted files will result in previously blacklisted files being whitelisted again. Subsequent
           matches will override previous ones. A leading literal exclamation mark or backslash needs to be
           escaped.

       <b>NoExtract</b> <b>=</b> file ...
           All files listed with a NoExtract directive will never be extracted from a package into the
           filesystem. This can be useful when you don’t want part of a package to be installed. For example, if
           your httpd root uses an <u>index.php</u>, then you would not want the <u>index.html</u> file to be extracted from
           the <u>apache</u> package. These files refer to files in the package archive, so do not include the leading
           slash (the RootDir) when specifying them. Shell-style glob patterns are allowed. It is possible to
           invert matches by prepending a file with an exclamation mark. Inverted files will result in
           previously blacklisted files being whitelisted again. Subsequent matches will override previous ones.
           A leading literal exclamation mark or backslash needs to be escaped.

       <b>CleanMethod</b> <b>=</b> KeepInstalled &amp;| KeepCurrent
           If set to KeepInstalled (the default), the <u>-Sc</u> operation will clean packages that are no longer
           installed (not present in the local database). If set to KeepCurrent, <u>-Sc</u> will clean outdated
           packages (not present in any sync database). The second behavior is useful when the package cache is
           shared among multiple machines, where the local databases are usually different, but the sync
           databases in use could be the same. If both values are specified, packages are only cleaned if not
           installed locally and not present in any known sync database.

       <b>SigLevel</b> <b>=</b> ...
           Set the default signature verification level. For more information, see Package and Database
           Signature Checking below.

       <b>LocalFileSigLevel</b> <b>=</b> ...
           Set the signature verification level for installing packages using the "-U" operation on a local
           file. Uses the value from SigLevel as the default.

       <b>RemoteFileSigLevel</b> <b>=</b> ...
           Set the signature verification level for installing packages using the "-U" operation on a remote
           file URL. Uses the value from SigLevel as the default.

       <b>UseSyslog</b>
           Log action messages through syslog(). This will insert log entries into /var/log/messages or
           equivalent.

       <b>Color</b>
           Automatically enable colors only when pacman’s output is on a tty.

       <b>NoProgressBar</b>
           Disables progress bars. This is useful for terminals which do not support escape characters.

       <b>CheckSpace</b>
           Performs an approximate check for adequate available disk space before installing packages.

       <b>VerbosePkgLists</b>
           Displays name, version and size of target packages formatted as a table for upgrade, sync and remove
           operations.

       <b>DisableDownloadTimeout</b>
           Disable defaults for low speed limit and timeout on downloads. Use this if you have issues
           downloading files with proxy and/or security gateway.

       <b>ParallelDownloads</b> <b>=</b> ...
           Specifies number of concurrent download streams. The value needs to be a positive integer. If this
           config option is not set then only one download stream is used (i.e. downloads happen sequentially).

       <b>DownloadUser</b> <b>=</b> username
           Specifies the user to switch to for downloading files. If this config option is not set then the
           downloads are done as the user running pacman.

       <b>DisableSandbox</b>
           Disable the default sandbox applied to the process downloading files on Linux systems. Useful if
           experiencing landlock related failures while downloading files when running a Linux kernel that does
           not support this feature.

</pre><h4><b>REPOSITORY</b> <b>SECTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Each repository section defines a section name and at least one location where the packages can be found.
       The section name is defined by the string within square brackets (the two above are <u>core</u> and <u>custom</u>).
       Repository names must be unique and the name <u>local</u> is reserved for the database of installed packages.
       Locations are defined with the <u>Server</u> directive and follow a URL naming structure. If you want to use a
       local directory, you can specify the full path with a “file://” prefix, as shown above.

       A common way to define DB locations utilizes the <u>Include</u> directive. For each repository defined in the
       configuration file, a single <u>Include</u> directive can contain a file that lists the servers for that
       repository.

           [core]
           # use this server first
           Server = <a href="ftp://ftp.archlinux.org/">ftp://ftp.archlinux.org/</a>$repo/os/$arch
           # next use servers as defined in the mirrorlist below
           Include = {sysconfdir}/pacman.d/mirrorlist

       The order of repositories in the configuration files matters; repositories listed first will take
       precedence over those listed later in the file when packages in two repositories have identical names,
       regardless of version number.

       <b>Include</b> <b>=</b> path
           Include another config file. This file can include repositories or general configuration options.
           Wildcards in the specified paths will get expanded based on <b><a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a></b>(7) rules.

       <b>CacheServer</b> <b>=</b> url
           A full URL to a location where the packages, and signatures (if available) for this repository can be
           found. Cache servers will be tried before any non-cache servers, will not be removed from the server
           pool for 404 download errors, and will not be used for database files.

       <b>Server</b> <b>=</b> url
           A full URL to a location where the database, packages, and signatures (if available) for this
           repository can be found.

           During parsing, pacman will define the $repo variable to the name of the current section. This is
           often utilized in files specified using the <u>Include</u> directive so all repositories can use the same
           mirrorfile. pacman also defines the $arch variable to the first (or only) value of the Architecture
           option, so the same mirrorfile can even be used for different architectures.

       <b>SigLevel</b> <b>=</b> ...
           Set the signature verification level for this repository. For more information, see Package and
           Database Signature Checking below.

       <b>Usage</b> <b>=</b> ...
           Set the usage level for this repository. This option takes a list of tokens which must be at least
           one of the following:

           <b>Sync</b>
               Enables refreshes for this repository.

           <b>Search</b>
               Enables searching for this repository.

           <b>Install</b>
               Enables installation of packages from this repository during a <u>--sync</u> operation.

           <b>Upgrade</b>
               Allows this repository to be a valid source of packages when performing a <u>--sysupgrade</u>.

           <b>All</b>
               Enables all of the above features for the repository. This is the default if not specified.

               Note that an enabled repository can be operated on explicitly, regardless of the Usage level set.

</pre><h4><b>PACKAGE</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DATABASE</b> <b>SIGNATURE</b> <b>CHECKING</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>SigLevel</u> directive is valid in both the [options] and repository sections. If used in [options], it
       sets a default value for any repository that does not provide the setting.

       •   If set to <b>Never</b>, no signature checking will take place.

       •   If set to <b>Optional</b> , signatures will be checked when present, but unsigned databases and packages
           will also be accepted.

       •   If set to <b>Required</b>, signatures will be required on all packages and databases.

       Alternatively, you can get more fine-grained control by combining some of the options and prefixes
       described below. All options in a config file are processed in top-to-bottom, left-to-right fashion,
       where later options override and/or supplement earlier ones. If <u>SigLevel</u> is specified in a repository
       section, the starting value is that from the [options] section, or the built-in system default as shown
       below if not specified.

       The options are split into two main groups, described below. Terms used such as “marginally trusted” are
       terms used by GnuPG, for more information please consult <b><a href="../man1/gpg.1.html">gpg</a></b>(1).

       When to Check
           These options control if and when signature checks should take place.

           <b>Never</b>
               All signature checking is suppressed, even if signatures are present.

           <b>Optional</b> (default)
               Signatures are checked if present; absence of a signature is not an error. An invalid signature
               is a fatal error, as is a signature from a key not in the keyring.

           <b>Required</b>
               Signatures are required; absence of a signature or an invalid signature is a fatal error, as is a
               signature from a key not in the keyring.

       What is Allowed
           These options control what signatures are viewed as permissible. Note that neither of these options
           allows acceptance of invalid or expired signatures, or those from revoked keys.

           <b>TrustedOnly</b> (default)
               If a signature is checked, it must be in the keyring and fully trusted; marginal trust does not
               meet this criteria.

           <b>TrustAll</b>
               If a signature is checked, it must be in the keyring, but is not required to be assigned a trust
               level (e.g., unknown or marginal trust).

       Options in both groups can additionally be prefixed with either <b>Package</b> or <b>Database</b>, which will cause it
       to only take effect on the specified object type. For example, PackageTrustAll would allow marginal and
       unknown trust level signatures for packages.

       The built-in default is the following:

           SigLevel = Optional TrustedOnly

</pre><h4><b>USING</b> <b>YOUR</b> <b>OWN</b> <b>REPOSITORY</b></h4><pre>
       If you have numerous custom packages of your own, it is often easier to generate your own custom local
       repository than install them all with the <u>--upgrade</u> option. All you need to do is generate a compressed
       package database in the directory with these packages so pacman can find it when run with <u>--refresh</u>.

           repo-add /home/pkgs/custom.db.tar.gz /home/pkgs/*.pkg.tar.gz

       The above command will generate a compressed database named <u>/home/pkgs/custom.db.tar.gz</u>. Note that the
       database must be of the form defined in the configuration file and <u>{ext}</u> is a valid compression type as
       documented in <b><a href="../man8/repo-add.8.html">repo-add</a></b>(8). That’s it! Now configure your custom section in the configuration file as
       shown in the config example above. Pacman will now use your package repository. If you add new packages
       to the repository, remember to re-generate the database and use pacman’s <u>--refresh</u> option.

       For more information on the repo-add command, see “repo-add --help” or <b><a href="../man8/repo-add.8.html">repo-add</a></b>(8).
