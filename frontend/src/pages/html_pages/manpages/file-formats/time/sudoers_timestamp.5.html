       sudoers_timestamp — Sudoers Time Stamp Format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>sudoers</b>  plugin  uses  per-user-ID  time  stamp  files for credential caching.  Once a user has been
       authenticated, they may use <b>sudo</b> without a password for  a  short  period  of  time  (<u>15</u>  minutes  unless
       overridden  by  the  <u>timestamp_timeout</u>  option).   By  default,  <b>sudoers</b>  uses a separate record for each
       terminal, which means that a user's login sessions  are  authenticated  separately.   The  <u>timestamp_type</u>
       option can be used to select the type of time stamp record <b>sudoers</b> will use.

       A  multi-record  time  stamp  file format was introduced in <b>sudo</b> 1.8.10 that uses a single file per user.
       Previously, a separate file was used for each user and terminal combination unless tty-based time  stamps
       were  disabled.   The  new  format  is  extensible and records of multiple types and versions may coexist
       within the same file.

       All records, regardless of type or version, begin with a 16-bit version number and a 16-bit record size.

       Time stamp records have the following structure:

       /* Time stamp entry types */
       #define TS_GLOBAL               0x01U   /* not restricted by tty or ppid */
       #define TS_TTY                  0x02U   /* restricted by tty */
       #define TS_PPID                 0x03U   /* restricted by ppid */
       #define TS_LOCKEXCL             0x04U   /* special lock record */

       /* Time stamp flags */
       #define TS_DISABLED             0x01U   /* entry disabled */
       #define TS_ANYUID               0x02U   /* ignore uid, only valid in key */

       struct timestamp_entry {
           unsigned short version;     /* version number */
           unsigned short size;        /* entry size */
           unsigned short type;        /* TS_GLOBAL, TS_TTY, TS_PPID */
           unsigned short flags;       /* TS_DISABLED, TS_ANYUID */
           uid_t auth_uid;             /* uid to authenticate as */
           pid_t sid;                  /* session ID associated with tty/ppid */
           struct timespec start_time; /* session/ppid start time */
           struct timespec ts;         /* time stamp (CLOCK_MONOTONIC) */
           union {
               dev_t ttydev;           /* tty device number */
               pid_t ppid;             /* parent pid */
           } u;
       };

       The timestamp_entry struct fields are as follows:

       version
             The version number of the timestamp_entry struct.  New entries are created with a version number of
             2.  Records with different version numbers may coexist in the same file but are not inter-operable.

       size  The size of the record in bytes.

       type  The record type, currently TS_GLOBAL, TS_TTY, or TS_PPID.

       flags
             Zero or more record flags which can be bit-wise ORed together.  Supported  flags  are  TS_DISABLED,
             for records disabled via <b>sudo</b> <b>-k</b> and TS_ANYUID, which is used only when matching records.

       auth_uid
             The  user-ID  that  was used for authentication.  Depending on the value of the <u>rootpw</u>, <u>runaspw</u> and
             <u>targetpw</u> options, the user-ID may be that of the invoking user, the root user,  the  default  runas
             user or the target user.

       sid   The  ID  of  the  user's  terminal  session, if present.  The session ID is only used when matching
             records of type TS_TTY.

       start_time
             The start time of the session leader for records of type  TS_TTY  or  of  the  parent  process  for
             records of type TS_PPID.  The <u>start_time</u> is used to help prevent reuse of a time stamp record after
             a user has logged out.  Not all systems support a method to easily retrieve a process's start time.
             The  <u>start_time</u>  field  was  added  in  <b>sudoers</b>  version  1.8.22  for  the  second  revision of the
             timestamp_entry struct.

       ts    The actual time stamp.  A monotonic time source (which does not  move  backward)  is  used  if  the
             system  supports it.  Where possible, <b>sudoers</b> uses a monotonic timer that increments even while the
             system is suspended.  The value of <u>ts</u> is updated each time a command  is  run  via  <b>sudo</b>.   If  the
             difference  between <u>ts</u> and the current time is less than the value of the <u>timestamp_timeout</u> option,
             no password is required.

       u.ttydev
             The device number of the terminal associated with the session for records of type TS_TTY.

       u.ppid
             The ID of the parent process for records of type TS_PPID.

       The <b>tsdump</b> utility, included with the sudo source distribution, can be used to display the contents of  a
       <u>sudoers</u> time stamp file.

</pre><h4><b>LOCKING</b></h4><pre>
       In  <b>sudoers</b>  versions  1.8.10  through 1.8.14, the entire time stamp file was locked for exclusive access
       when reading or writing to the file.  Starting in <b>sudoers</b> 1.8.15, individual records are  locked  in  the
       time stamp file instead of the entire file and the lock is held for a longer period of time.  This scheme
       is described below.

       The  first  record  in the time stamp file is of type TS_LOCKEXCL and is used as a <u>lock</u> record to prevent
       more than one <b>sudo</b> process from adding a new record at the same time.  Once the desired time stamp record
       has been located or created (and locked), the TS_LOCKEXCL record is unlocked.  The lock on the individual
       time stamp record, however, is held until authentication is  complete.   This  allows  <b>sudoers</b>  to  avoid
       prompting for a password multiple times when it is used more than once in a pipeline.

       Records  of type TS_GLOBAL cannot be locked for a long period of time since doing so would interfere with
       other <b>sudo</b> processes.  Instead, a separate lock record is used to prevent multiple <b>sudo</b>  processes  using
       the same terminal (or parent process ID) from prompting for a password as the same time.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       Originally, <b>sudo</b> used a single zero-length file per user and the file's modification time was used as the
       time  stamp.   Later  versions  of  <b>sudo</b>  added restrictions on the ownership of the time stamp files and
       directory as well as checks on the validity of the time stamp itself.  Notable changes were introduced in
       the following <b>sudo</b> versions:

       1.4.0
             Support for tty-based time stamp file was added by appending the terminal name to  the  time  stamp
             file name.

       1.6.2
             The  time  stamp file was replaced by a per-user directory which contained any tty-based time stamp
             files.

       1.6.3p2
             The target user name was added to the time stamp file name when the <u>targetpw</u> option was set.

       1.7.3
             Information about the terminal device was stored in tty-based time stamp files for validity checks.
             This included the terminal device numbers, inode number and, on systems where it  was  not  updated
             when the device was written to, the inode change time.  This helped prevent reuse of the time stamp
             file after logout.

       1.8.6p7
             The  terminal session ID was added to tty-based time stamp files to prevent reuse of the time stamp
             by the same user in a different terminal session.  It also helped prevent reuse of the  time  stamp
             file on systems where the terminal device's inode change time was updated by writing.

       1.8.10
             A  new,  multi-record  time stamp file format was introduced that uses a single file per user.  The
             terminal device's change time was not included since most systems now update the change time  after
             a write is performed as required by POSIX.

       1.8.15
             Individual  records  are  locked  in the time stamp file instead of the entire file and the lock is
             held until authentication is complete.

       1.8.22
             The start time of the terminal session leader or parent process is now stored  in  non-global  time
             stamp records.  This prevents reuse of the time stamp file after logout in most cases.

             Support was added for the kernel-based tty time stamps available in OpenBSD which do not use an on-
             disk time stamp file.

       1.9.15
             Time  stamp  file  path names are now based on the invoking user-ID instead of the user name.  This
             avoids problems with user names that include a path separator character.
