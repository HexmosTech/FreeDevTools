       dirfile — a filesystem-based database format for time-ordered binary data

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>dirfile</u>  database format is designed to provide a fast, simple format for storing and reading binary
       time-ordered data.  Dirfiles  can  be  read  using  the  GetData  Library,  which  provides  a  reference
       implementaiton of these Standards.

       The  dirfile database is centred around one or more time-ordered data streams (a <u>time</u> <u>stream</u>).  Each time
       stream is written to the filesystem in a separate file, as binary data.  The name of these  binary  files
       correspond  to the time stream's <u>field</u> <u>name</u>.  Dirfiles support binary data fields for signed and unsigned
       integer types of 8 to 64 bits, as well as single and double precision floating-point real or complex data
       types.

       Two time streams may have different constant sampling frequencies and mechanisms exist within the dirfile
       format to ensure these time streams remain properly sequenced in time.

       To do this, the time streams in the dirfile are subdivided into <u>frames</u>.   Each  frame  contains  a  fixed
       integer  number  of samples of each time stream.  Two time streams in the same dirfile may have different
       numbers of samples per frame, but the number of samples per frame of any given time stream is fixed.

       When synchronous retrieval of data from more than one time stream is required, position  in  the  dirfile
       can be specified in frames, which will ensure synchronicity.

       The  binary  files  are  all  located  in  one  ore  more filesystem directories, rooted around a central
       directory, known as the <u>dirfile</u> <u>directory</u>.  The dirfile as a whole may be  referred  to  by  its  dirfile
       directory path.

       Included  in the dirfile along with the time streams is the <u>dirfile</u> <u>format</u> <u>specification</u>, which is one or
       more ASCII text files containing the dirfile database metadata.  The primary  file  is  the  file  called
       <b>format</b> located in the dirfile directory.  This file and any additional files that it names, fully specify
       the dirfile's metadata.  For the syntax of these files, see <b><a href="../man5/dirfile-format.5.html">dirfile-format</a></b>(5).

       Version  3  of  the  Dirfile  Standards introduced the <u>large</u> <u>dirfile</u> extension.  This extension added the
       ability to distribute the dirfile metadata among multiple files (called <u>fragments</u>)  in  addition  to  the
       <b>format</b>  file, as well as the ability to house portions of the database in <u>subdirfiles</u>.  These subdirfiles
       may be fully fledged dirfiles in their own right, but may also  be  contained  within  a  larger,  parent
       dirfile.  See <b><a href="../man5/dirfile-format.5.html">dirfile-format</a></b>(5) for information on specifying these subdirfiles.

       In  addition  to the raw fields on disk, the dirfile format specification may also specify <u>derived</u> <u>fields</u>
       which are calculated by performing simple element-wise operations on one or more input  fields.   Derived
       fields behave identically to raw fields when read via GetData.  See <b><a href="../man5/dirfile-format.5.html">dirfile-format</a></b>(5) for a complete list
       of  derived  field  types.  Dirfiles may also contain both numerical and character string constant <u>scalar</u>
       <u>fields</u>, also further outlined in <b><a href="../man5/dirfile-format.5.html">dirfile-format</a></b>(5).

       Dirfiles are designed to be written to and read simultaneously. The dirfile specification  dictates  that
       one  particular  raw  field  (specified either explicitly or implicitly by the dirfile metadata) is to be
       used as the <u>reference</u> <u>field</u>: all other vector fields are assumed to have at least as many frames  as  the
       reference  field  has, and the size (in frames) of the reference field is used as the size of the dirfile
       as a whole.

       Version 6 of the Dirfile Standards added the ability to encode the binary files on disk.   Each  <u>fragment</u>
       may  have  its own encoding scheme.  Most commonly, encodings are used to compress the data files to same
       space.  See <b><a href="../man5/dirfile-encoding.5.html">dirfile-encoding</a></b>(5) for information on encoding schemes.

   <b>Complex</b> <b>Number</b> <b>Storage</b> <b>Format</b>
       Version 7 of the Dirfile Standards added support for complex valued data.  Two types  of  complex  valued
       data are supported by the Dirfile Standards:

       •   A 64-bit complex number consisting of a IEEE-754 standard 32-bit single precision floating point real
           part and a IEEE-754 standard 32-bit single precision floating point imaginary part, and

       •   A  128-bit  complex  number  consisting of a IEEE-754 standard 64-bit double precision floating point
           real part and a IEEE-754 standard 64-bit double precision floating point imaginary part.

       No integer-type complex numbers are supported.

       Unencoded complex numbers are stored on disk in "Fortran order", that is  with  the  IEEE-754  real  part
       followed  by the IEEE-754 imaginary part.  The specified endianness of the two components follows that of
       purely real floating point numbers.  Endianness does not affect the ordering of the  real  and  imaginary
       parts.  This format also conforms to the C99 and C++11 standards.

       To  aid  in  using  complex  valued  data,  dirfile field codes may contain a <u>representation</u> <u>suffix</u> which
       specifies a function to apply to the  complex  valued  data  to  map  it  into  purely  real  data.   See
       <b><a href="../man5/dirfile-format.5.html">dirfile-format</a></b>(5).
