</pre><h4><b>PROPOSAL</b> <b>FOR</b> <b>EXTENDED</b> <b>VI</b> <b>TAGS</b> <b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       Version: 0.06 DRAFT
       Date: 1998 Feb 8
       Author: Bram Moolenaar &lt;Bram at vim.org&gt; and Darren Hiebert &lt;dhiebert at users.sourceforge.net&gt;

   <b>Introduction</b>
       The file format for the "tags" file, as used by Vi and many of its descendants, has limited capabilities.

       This additional functionality is desired:

       1. Static or local tags.  The scope of these tags is the file where they are defined.  The same  tag  can
          appear in several files, without really being a duplicate.

       2. Duplicate  tags.  Allow the same tag to occur more then once.  They can be located in a different file
          and/or have a different command.

       3. Support for C++.  A tag is not only specified by its name, but also by the context (the class name).

       4. Future extension.  When even more additional functionality is desired, it must be possible to add this
          later, without breaking programs that don't support it.

   <b>From</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>to</b> <b>standard</b>
       To make this proposal into a standard for tags files, it needs to be supported by most people working  on
       versions of Vi, ctags, etc..  Currently this standard is supported by:

       <b>Darren</b> <b>Hiebert</b> <b>&lt;dhiebert</b> <b>at</b> <b>users.sourceforge.net&gt;</b>
              Exuberant Ctags

       <b>Bram</b> <b>Moolenaar</b> <b>&lt;Bram</b> <b>at</b> <b>vim.org&gt;</b>
              Vim (Vi IMproved)

       These have been or will be asked to support this standard:

       <b>Nvi</b>    Keith Bostic &lt;bostic at bsdi.com&gt;

       <b>Vile</b>   Tom E. Dickey &lt;dickey at clark.net&gt;

       <b>NEdit</b>  Mark Edel &lt;edel at ltx.com&gt;

       <b>CRiSP</b>  Paul Fox &lt;fox at crisp.demon.co.uk&gt;

       <b>Lemmy</b>  James Iuliano &lt;jai at accessone.com&gt;

       <b>Zeus</b>   Jussi Jumppanen &lt;jussij at ca.com.au&gt;

       <b>Elvis</b>  Steve Kirkendall &lt;kirkenda at cs.pdx.edu&gt;

       <b>FTE</b>    Marko Macek &lt;Marko.Macek at snet.fri.uni-lj.si&gt;

   <b>Backwards</b> <b>compatibility</b>
       A  tags file that is generated in the new format should still be usable by Vi.  This makes it possible to
       distribute tags files that are usable by all versions and descendants of Vi.

       This restricts the format to what Vi can handle.  The format is:

       1. The tags file is a list of lines, each line in the format:

             {tagname}&lt;Tab&gt;{tagfile}&lt;Tab&gt;{tagaddress}

          <b>{tagname}</b>
                 Any identifier, not containing white space..

                 EXCEPTION: Universal Ctags violates this item of the  proposal;  tagname  may  contain  spaces.
                 However, tabs are not allowed.

          <b>&lt;Tab&gt;</b>  Exactly one TAB character (although many versions of Vi can handle any amount of white space).

          <b>{tagfile}</b>
                 The name of the file where {tagname} is defined, relative to the current directory (or location
                 of the tags file?).

          <b>{tagaddress}</b>
                 Any Ex command.  When executed, it behaves like 'magic' was not set.

       2. The tags file is sorted on {tagname}.  This allows for a binary search in the file.

       3. Duplicate  tags  are  allowed,  but which one is actually used is unpredictable (because of the binary
          search).

       The best way to add extra text to the line for the new functionality, without breaking it for Vi,  is  to
       put  a  comment  in  the  {tagaddress}.   This  gives the freedom to use any text, and should work in any
       traditional Vi implementation.

       For example, when the old tags file contains:

          main    main.c  /^main(argc, argv)$/
          DEBUG   defines.c       89

       The new lines can be:

          main    main.c  /^main(argc, argv)$/;"any additional text
          DEBUG   defines.c       89;"any additional text

       Note that the ';' is required to put the cursor in the right line, and then the '"' is recognized as  the
       start of a comment.

       For  Posix  compliant  Vi  versions  this  will NOT work, since only a line number or a search command is
       recognized.  I hope Posix can be adjusted.  Nvi suffers from this.

   <b>Security</b>
       Vi allows the use of any Ex command in a tags file.  This has the potential of a  trojan  horse  security
       leak.

       The  proposal  is  to  allow only Ex commands that position the cursor in a single file.  Other commands,
       like editing another file, quitting the editor, changing a file or writing a file, are not  allowed.   It
       is therefore logical to call the command a tagaddress.

       Specifically, these two Ex commands are allowed:

       • A decimal line number:

            89

       • A search command.  It is a regular expression pattern, as used by Vi, enclosed in // or ??:

            /^int c;$/
            ?main()?

       There are two combinations possible:

       • Concatenation  of  the above, with ';' in between.  The meaning is that the first line number or search
         command is used, the cursor is positioned in that line, and then the second search command is  used  (a
         line  number  would  not  be  useful).   This  can  be  done  multiple  times.  This is useful when the
         information in a single line is not unique, and the search needs to start in a specified line.

            /struct xyz {/;/int count;/
            389;/struct foo/;/char *s;/

       • A trailing comment can be added, starting with ';"'  (two  characters:  semi-colon  and  double-quote).
         This is used below.

            89;" foo bar

       This  might  be  extended  in the future.  What is currently missing is a way to position the cursor in a
       certain column.

   <b>Goals</b>
       Now the usage of the comment text has to be defined.  The following is aimed at:

       1. Keep the text short, because:

          • The line length that Vi can handle is limited to 512 characters.

          • Tags files can contain thousands of tags.  I have seen tags files of several Mbytes.

          • More text makes searching slower.

       2. Keep the text readable, because:

          • It is often necessary to check the output of a new ctags program.

          • Be able to edit the file by hand.

          • Make it easier to write a program to produce or parse the file.

       3. Don't use special characters, because:

          • It should be possible to treat a tags file like any normal text file.

   <b>Proposal</b>
       Use a comment after the {tagaddress} field.  The format would be:

          {tagname}&lt;Tab&gt;{tagfile}&lt;Tab&gt;{tagaddress}[;"&lt;Tab&gt;{tagfield}..]

       <b>{tagname}</b>
              Any identifier, not containing white space..

              EXCEPTION: Universal Ctags violates this item of the proposal; name may contain  spaces.  However,
              tabs  are  not allowed.  Conversion, for some characters including &lt;Tab&gt; in the "value", explained
              in the last of this section is applied.

       <b>&lt;Tab&gt;</b>  Exactly one TAB character (although many versions of Vi can handle any amount of white space).

       <b>{tagfile}</b>
              The name of the file where {tagname} is defined, relative to the current directory (or location of
              the tags file?).

       <b>{tagaddress}</b>
              Any Ex command.  When executed, it behaves like 'magic' was not set.  It may be  restricted  to  a
              line number or a search pattern (Posix).

       Optionally:

       <b>;"</b>     semicolon + doublequote: Ends the tagaddress in way that looks like the start of a comment to Vi.

       <b>{tagfield}</b>
              See below.

       A tagfield has a name, a colon, and a value: "name:value".

       • The name consist only out of alphabetical characters.  Upper and lower case are allowed.  Lower case is
         recommended.  Case matters ("kind:" and "Kind: are different tagfields).

         EXCEPTION: Universal Ctags allows users to use a numerical character in the name other than its initial
         letter.

       • The value may be empty.  It cannot contain a &lt;Tab&gt;.

         • When a value contains a <b>\t</b>, this stands for a &lt;Tab&gt;.

         • When a value contains a <b>\r</b>, this stands for a &lt;CR&gt;.

         • When a value contains a <b>\n</b>, this stands for a &lt;NL&gt;.

         • When a value contains a <b>\\</b>, this stands for a single <b>\</b> character.

         Other  use of the backslash character is reserved for future expansion.  Warning: When a tagfield value
         holds an MS-DOS file name, the backslashes must be doubled!

         EXCEPTION: Universal Ctags introduces more conversion rules.

         • When a value contains a <b>\a</b>, this stands for a &lt;BEL&gt; (0x07).

         • When a value contains a <b>\b</b>, this stands for a &lt;BS&gt; (0x08).

         • When a value contains a <b>\v</b>, this stands for a &lt;VT&gt; (0x0b).

         • When a value contains a <b>\f</b>, this stands for a &lt;FF&gt; (0x0c).

         • The characters in range 0x01 to 0x1F included, and 0x7F are  converted  to  <b>\x</b>  prefixed  hexadecimal
           number if the characters are not handled in the above "value" rules.

         • The  leading  space  (0x20) and <b>!</b> (0x21) in {tagname} are converted to <b>\x</b> prefixed hexadecimal number
           (<b>\x20</b> and <b>\x21</b>) if the tag is not a pseudo-tag. As described later, a pseudo-tag starts with <b>!</b>. These
           rules are for distinguishing pseudo-tags and non pseudo-tags (regular tags) when tags lines in a  tag
           file are sorted.

       Note  that these are mostly for C and C++.  When tags programs are written for other languages, this list
       should be extended to include the used field names.  This will help users to be independent of  the  tags
       program used.

       Examples:

          asdf    sub.cc  /^asdf()$/;"    new_field:some\svalue   file:
          foo_t   sub.h   /^typedef foo_t$/;"     kind:t
          func3   sub.p   /^func3()$/;"   function:/func1/func2   file:
          getflag sub.c   /^getflag(arg)$/;"      kind:f  file:
          inc     sub.cc  /^inc()$/;"     file: class:PipeBuf

       The  name of the "kind:" field can be omitted.  This is to reduce the size of the tags file by about 15%.
       A program reading the tags file can recognize the "kind:" field by the missing ':'.  Examples:

          foo_t   sub.h   /^typedef foo_t$/;"     t
          getflag sub.c   /^getflag(arg)$/;"      f       file:

       Additional remarks:

       • When a tagfield appears twice in a tag line, only the last one is used.

       Note about line separators:

       Vi traditionally runs on Unix systems, where the line separator is a single linefeed character &lt;NL&gt;.   On
       MS-DOS  and  compatible  systems  &lt;CR&gt;&lt;NL&gt; is the standard line separator.  To increase portability, this
       line separator is also supported.

       On the Macintosh a single &lt;CR&gt; is used for line  separator.   Supporting  this  on  Unix  systems  causes
       problems,  because  most  fgets()  implementation  don't see the &lt;CR&gt; as a line separator.  Therefore the
       support for a &lt;CR&gt; as line separator is limited to the Macintosh.

       The characters &lt;CR&gt; and &lt;LF&gt; cannot be used inside a tag line.  This is not mentioned elsewhere  (because
       it's obvious).

       Note about white space:

       Vi  allowed  any  white  space  to  separate  the  tagname  from  the  tagfile, and the filename from the
       tagaddress.  This would need to be allowed for backwards compatibility.  However, all known programs that
       generate tags use a single &lt;Tab&gt; to separate fields.

       There is a problem for using file names with embedded white space in the tagfile field.  To  work  around
       this,  the  same  special  characters  could  be  used  as  in  the  new  fields,  for  example <b>\s</b>.  But,
       unfortunately, in MS-DOS the backslash  character  is  used  to  separate  file  names.   The  file  name
       <b>c:\vim\sap</b>  contains <b>\s</b>, but this is not a &lt;Space&gt;.  The number of backslashes could be doubled, but that
       will add a lot of characters, and make parsing the tags file slower and clumsy.

       To avoid these problems, we will only allow a &lt;Tab&gt; to separate fields, and not support a  file  name  or
       tagname  that contains a &lt;Tab&gt; character.  This means that we are not 100% Vi compatible.  However, there
       is no known tags program that uses something else than a &lt;Tab&gt; to separate the fields.  Only when a  user
       typed the tags file himself, or made his own program to generate a tags file, we could run into problems.
       To  solve  this,  the  tags  file  should be filtered, to replace the arbitrary white space with a single
       &lt;Tab&gt;.  This Vi command can be used:

          :%s/^\([^ ^I]*\)[ ^I]*\([^ ^I]*\)[ ^I]*/\1^I\2^I/

       (replace ^I with a real &lt;Tab&gt;).

       TAG FILE INFORMATION:

       Pseudo-tag lines can be used to encode information into the tag file regarding details about its  content
       (e.g. have the tags been sorted?, are the optional tagfields present?), and regarding the program used to
       generate  the  tag  file.   This  information  can  be  used  both  to optimize use of the tag file (e.g.
       enable/disable binary searching) and provide general information  (what  version  of  the  generator  was
       used).

       The  names  of  the tags used in these lines may be suitably chosen to ensure that when sorted, they will
       always be located near the first lines of the tag file.  The use of "!_TAG_" is recommended.  Note that a
       rare tag like "!" can sort to before these lines.  The program reading the  tags  file  should  be  smart
       enough to skip over these tags.

       The lines described below have been chosen to convey a select set of information.

       Tag lines providing information about the content of the tag file:

          !_TAG_FILE_FORMAT   {version-number}        /optional comment/
          !_TAG_FILE_SORTED   {0|1}                   /0=unsorted, 1=sorted/

       The  {version-number}  used in the tag file format line reserves the value of "1" for tag files complying
       with the original UNIX vi/ctags format, and reserves the value "2" for  tag  files  complying  with  this
       proposal.  This  value  may  be used to determine if the extended features described in this proposal are
       present.

       Tag lines providing information about the program used to generate the tag file, and provided solely  for
       documentation purposes:

          !_TAG_PROGRAM_AUTHOR        {author-name}   /{email-address}/
          !_TAG_PROGRAM_NAME  {program-name}  /optional comment/
          !_TAG_PROGRAM_URL   {URL}   /optional comment/
          !_TAG_PROGRAM_VERSION       {version-id}    /optional comment/

       EXCEPTION: Universal Ctags introduces more kinds of pseudo-tags.  See <a href="../man7/ctags-client-tools.7.html">ctags-client-tools</a>(7) about them.

</pre><h4><b>EXCEPTIONS</b> <b>IN</b> <b>UNIVERSAL</b> <b>CTAGS</b></h4><pre>
       Universal Ctags supports this proposal with some exceptions.

   <b>Exceptions</b>
       1. {tagname}  in  tags file generated by Universal Ctags may contain spaces and several escape sequences.
          Parsers for documents like Tex and reStructuredText, or liberal  languages  such  as  JavaScript  need
          these exceptions. See {tagname} of Proposal section for more detail about the conversion.

       2. "name"  part  of  {tagfield} in a tag generated by Universal Ctags may contain numeric characters, but
          the first character of the "name" must be alphabetic.

   <b>Compatible</b> <b>output</b> <b>and</b> <b>weakness</b>
       Default  behavior  (<b>--output-format=u-ctags</b>  option)  has  the   exceptions.    In   other   hand,   with
       <b>--output-format=e-ctags</b>  option  ctags  has  no  exception; Universal Ctags command may use the same file
       format as Exuberant Ctags. However, <b>--output-format=e-ctags</b> throws away a tag entry which name includes a
       space or a tab character. <b>TAG_OUTPUT_MODE</b> pseudo-tag tells which format is  used  when  ctags  generating
       tags file.
