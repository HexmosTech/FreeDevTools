</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       inn.conf - Configuration data for InterNetNews programs

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>inn.conf</u> in <u>pathetc</u> is the primary general configuration file for all InterNetNews programs.  Settings
       which control the general operation of various programs, as well as the paths to all portions of the news
       installation, are found here.  The INNCONF environment variable, if set, specifies an alternate path to
       <u>inn.conf</u>.

       This file is intended to be fairly static.  Any changes made to it will generally not affect any running
       programs until they restart.  Unlike nearly every other configuration file, <u>inn.conf</u> cannot be reloaded
       dynamically using <a href="../man8/ctlinnd.8.html">ctlinnd</a>(8); <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) must be stopped and restarted for relevant changes to <u>inn.conf</u> to
       take effect ("ctlinnd xexec innd" is the fastest way to do this.)

       Blank lines and lines starting with a number sign ("#") are ignored.  All other lines specify parameters,
       and should be of the following form:

           &lt;name&gt;: &lt;value&gt;

       (Any amount of whitespace can be put after the colon and is optional.)  If the value contains embedded
       whitespace or any of the characters "[]&lt;&gt;{}"\:;", it must be enclosed in double quotes ("").  A backslash
       ("\") can be used to escape quotes and backslashes inside double quotes.  &lt;name&gt; is case-sensitive;
       "server" is not the same as "Server" or "SERVER".  (<u>inn.conf</u> parameters are generally all in lowercase.)

       If &lt;name&gt; occurs more than once in the file, the first value is used.  Some parameters specified in the
       file may be overridden by environment variables.  Most parameters have default values if not specified in
       <u>inn.conf</u>; those defaults are noted in the description of each parameter.

       Many parameters take a boolean value.  For all such parameters, the value may be specified as "true",
       "yes", or "on" to turn it on and may be any of "false", "no", or "off" to turn it off.  The case of these
       values is significant.

       This documentation is extremely long and organized as a reference manual rather than as a tutorial.  If
       this is your first exposure to INN and these parameters, it would be better to start by reading other man
       pages and referring to this one only when an <u>inn.conf</u> parameter is explicitly mentioned.  Those
       parameters which need to be changed when setting up a new server are discussed in <u>INSTALL</u>.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>General</b> <b>Settings</b>
       These parameters are used by a wide variety of different components of INN.

       <u>domain</u>
           This should be the domain name of the local host.  It should not have a leading period, and it should
           not  be  a full host address.  It is used only if a fully qualified domain name cannot be found.  INN
           first  tries  to  retrieve  it  from  the  INN_HOSTNAME  environment  variable  if  set,  then   from
           <a href="../man3/gethostname.3.html">gethostname</a>(3)  and  <a href="../man3/getaddrinfo.3.html">getaddrinfo</a>(3)  calls.   The  check  is  very  simple; if the retrieved hostname
           contains a period, then it is assumed to have the full domain name.  Otherwise, a dot  followed  with
           the value of <u>domain</u> is appended to the retrieved hostname.  The default value is unset.

           You  are  encouraged  to  declare  your  fully  qualified  domain  name  in  <u><a href="file:/etc/hostname">/etc/hostname</a></u>, or in the
           INN_HOSTNAME environment variable if you can't.

           The intent is to obtain a hostname guaranteed to be unique, so a value  like  "localhost.localdomain"
           for  the  hostname  or  "localdomain"  for the <u>domain</u> parameter should be avoided.  Ideally, a domain
           affiliated with the administrators of the news server should be used.

           This parameter is not meant to be used to affect the right-hand side  of  autogenerated  Message-IDs;
           you  have  to directly use <u>domain</u> in <a href="../man5/readers.conf.5.html">readers.conf</a>(5) instead, for backwards-compatible reasons.  (The
           name of this parameter in  <u>readers.conf</u>  will  likely  be  changed  in  a  future  major  release  to
           disambiguate its use.)

       <u>innflags</u>
           The  flags  to  pass to <b>innd</b> on startup.  See <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) for details on the possible flags.  The default
           value is unset.

           Note that these flags are only used when <b>innd</b> is started from <b>rc.news</b> or <b>nntpsend</b>.

       <u>mailcmd</u>
           The path to the program to be used for mailing reports and errors to  the  news  administrator.   The
           default is <u>pathbin</u>/innmail.  This should not normally need to be changed.

       <u>mta</u> The command to use when sending a mail (e.g. mailing postings to moderators, gatewaying news to mail,
           sending  statistics  to  the  TOP1000 project, mailing errors and reports to the news administrator).
           Some programs use <a href="../man1/innmail.1.html">innmail</a>(1) which in turn runs the command in the <u>mta</u> parameter.  The message,  with
           its  headers,  will  be  piped  into  this <u>mta</u> program.  Depending on the calling program, additional
           header fields may be added when appropriate, like To, Subject or Auto-Submitted header fields.

           The string "%s", if present, will be replaced by the expected recipient(s) like the e-mail address of
           the moderator or of a remote list.  It's strongly recommended for this command to end  with  "%s"  on
           the  command  line rather than, when not present, use the addresses in the To and Cc header fields of
           the message, since the latter approach allows the news server to be abused as  a  mechanism  to  send
           mail  to  arbitrary addresses and will result in unexpected behaviour.  There is no default value for
           this parameter; it must be set in <u>inn.conf</u> or a fatal error message will be logged via syslog.

           For most systems, "/usr/lib/sendmail -oi -oem %s" (adjusted for the correct  path  to  <b>sendmail</b>,  and
           between double quotes) is a good choice.

           To  improve  deliverability of sent mails, especially moderated group submissions, you are encouraged
           to install a modern and full-featured MTA like Postfix instead  of  a  frugal  MTA  like  Nullmailer.
           You'll  then  be  able  to  configure  bounces  and benefit from DSN (Delivery Status Notifications).
           Useful flags to add, if your <u>mta</u> program supports them, are "-N failure" (to only  return  a  DSN  on
           failure,   not   delay),   "-F   'Newsmaster'"   (to   set   the  full  name  of  the  notification),
           "-<a href="mailto:fnewsmaster@server.com">fnewsmaster@server.com</a>" (to set the envelope sender  address),  and  "-opnobodyreturn"  (a  privacy
           option to only return headers in the DSN).  Feel free to add any other options you think appropriate.

       <u>pathhost</u>
           What  to  put into the Path header field to represent the local site.  This path identity is added to
           the Path header field body of all articles that pass through the  system,  including  locally  posted
           articles, and is also used when processing some control messages and when naming the server in status
           reports.  There is no default value; this parameter must be set in <u>inn.conf</u> or INN will not start.  A
           good value to use is the fully qualified hostname of the system.

           The  main purpose of the path identity is to avoid being proposed by your peers articles that already
           contain your path identity in their Path header fields.

           In case you are running several internal news servers, you may want to also set <u>pathcluster</u> so as  to
           define  the  primary  path identity to advertise to your peers for their use in correctly identifying
           your news servers and adding the right path  diagnostic  (see  Section 3.2.1  of  RFC 5537  for  more
           details about path diagnostics).

       <u>runasgroup</u>
           The  group  under  which  the news server will run.  The default is "news" (or the group specified at
           configure time) and should not normally need to be changed.

       <u>runasuser</u>
           The user under which the news server will run.  The default is  "news"  (or  the  user  specified  at
           configure time) and should not normally need to be changed.

       <u>server</u>
           The  name  of  the  default NNTP server.  If <u>nnrpdposthost</u> is not set and UNIX domain sockets are not
           supported, <b>nnrpd</b> tries to hand off locally-posted articles through an  INET  domain  socket  to  this
           server.

           <b>actsync</b>, <b>getlist</b>, <b>inews</b>, and <b>nntpget</b> also use this value as the default server to connect to.  In the
           latter  cases,  the  value of the NNTPSERVER environment variable, if it exists, overrides this.  The
           default value is unset.  You may want to set it to "localhost" or the fully qualified domain name  of
           your local news server or of a remote news server.

           <b>rnews</b> uses this value as a fallback when <u>nnrpdposthost</u> is not set, and there's no localhost server.

       <u>syntaxchecks</u>
           A list of values controlling the level of checks performed by <b>innd</b> and <b>nnrpd</b>.  For instance:

               syntaxchecks: [ no-laxmid ]

           The  last  occurrence  of  a  given  value  takes precedence, that is to say if "no-laxmid laxmid" is
           listed, <u>laxmid</u> takes precedence.

           Only one check can currently be enabled/disabled:

           <u>laxmid</u> / <u>no-laxmid</u>
               When <u>laxmid</u> is set, Message-IDs containing ".." in  the  left  part  are  accepted,  as  well  as
               Message-IDs  with  two  "@".  Some non-compliant news posters generate such syntactically invalid
               Message-IDs, especially in binary newsgroups.  The default is  <u>no-laxmid</u>,  that  is  to  say  INN
               strictly  follows the standard regarding syntax checks (it will neither accept these articles nor
               propagate them to remote peers).

   <b>Feed</b> <b>Configuration</b>
       These parameters govern incoming and outgoing feeds: what size of articles are accepted,  what  filtering
       and  verification  is  performed  on them, whether articles in groups not carried by the server are still
       stored and propagated, and other similar settings.

       <u>artcutoff</u>
           Articles older than this number of days are dropped.  The default value is "10", which means that  an
           incoming article will be rejected if its posting date is farther in the past than ten days.

           In order to disable that check on date, you can set this parameter to "0".

           The  number  on  the  "/remember/" line in <u>expire.ctl</u> should probably be one more than that number in
           order to take into account articles whose posting date is one day into the future.

       <u>bindaddress</u>
           Which  IP  address  <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8)  should  bind  itself  to.   This   must   be   in   dotted-quad   format
           (nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn).   If  set  to "all" or not set, innd defaults to listening on all interfaces.  The
           value of the INND_BIND_ADDRESS environment variable, if set, overrides  this  setting.   The  default
           value is unset.

           This parameter has no effect when systemd socket activation is used.

       <u>bindaddress6</u>
           Like <u>bindaddress</u> but for IPv6 sockets.  If only one of the <u>bindaddress</u> and <u>bindaddress6</u> parameters is
           used,  then  only the socket for the corresponding address family is created.  If both parameters are
           used then two sockets are created.  If neither of them is used, the list of sockets to listen on will
           be determined by the system library <u><a href="../man3/getaddrinfo.3.html">getaddrinfo</a>(3)</u> function.  The  value  of  the  INND_BIND_ADDRESS6
           environment variable, if set, overrides this setting.  The default value is unset.

           Note  that  you  will generally need to put double quotes ("") around this value if you set it, since
           IPv6 addresses contain colons.

           This parameter has no effect when systemd socket activation is used.

       <u>docancels</u>
           This parameter is intended for sites concerned about abuse of cancels, or  that  wish  to  enforce  a
           mechanism to authenticate cancels.  This parameter does not change how NoCeM notices are processed by
           <a href="../man8/perl-nocem.8.html">perl-nocem</a>(8),  and  only  applies  to  cancel  articles  (with a Control header field) and supersede
           requests (with a Supersedes header field).

           Unless rejected by the use of a filter hook, <b>innd</b> always accepts and propagates cancel  articles  and
           supersede  requests.   However, actually processing such articles on the local news server depends on
           this parameter which can take the following values:

           "require-auth"
               Only articles originally protected by the Cancel-Lock authentication mechanism can  be  withdrawn
               by  a valid authenticated cancel article or a valid authenticated supersede request.  Withdrawals
               of articles not originally protected by Cancel-Lock will not be executed.

               This is the default value if <b>innd</b> knows how to authenticate cancels (that is to say  if  INN  was
               built with Cancel-Lock support).  Otherwise, the behaviour will be the same as "none".

           "auth"
               Withdrawals of articles not originally protected by the Cancel-Lock authentication mechanism will
               always  be  executed.   However, if the original article is protected, only a valid authenticated
               cancel article or a valid authenticated supersede request will permit withdrawing  it.   (If  INN
               was not built with Cancel-Lock support, such protected articles won't be withdrawn.)

           "none"
               Neither cancel articles nor supersede requests will be processed; no articles will be withdrawn.

               This  is  the  default value if <b>innd</b> does not know how to authenticate cancels (that is to say if
               INN was not built with Cancel-Lock support) as it has no means to ensure  that  these  withdrawal
               requests are legitimate.

           "all"
               <b>innd</b>  will process all cancel articles and supersede requests, even if unauthenticated, forged or
               with bad authentication.  You should be sure of what you are doing if you choose  that  value  as
               any article can be withdrawn (even by someone who is not the author of the article).

       <u>dontrejectfiltered</u>
           Normally  <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8)  rejects  incoming  articles  when directed to do so by any enabled article filters
           (Perl or Python).  However, this parameter causes such articles <u>not</u> to be rejected; instead filtering
           can be applied on outbound articles.  If this parameter is set, all articles will be accepted on  the
           local  machine,  but  articles  rejected  by  the  filter  will  <u>not</u> be fed to any peers specified in
           <u>newsfeeds</u> with the "Af" flag.  The default value is false.

           If this parameter is set, you may also use the <u>filtered</u> key of storage method entries in <u>storage.conf</u>
           to store filtered articles in dedicated storage classes.

       <u>hiscachesize</u>
           If set to a value other than "0", a hash of recently received Message-IDs is kept in memory to  speed
           history  lookups.   The value is the amount of memory to devote to the cache in kilobytes.  The cache
           is only used for incoming feeds and a small cache can hold quite a few Message-IDs, so  large  values
           aren't  necessarily  useful  unless  you  have  incoming feeds that are badly delayed.  <b>innreport</b> can
           provide useful statistics regarding the use of the history cache, especially when it misses.  A  good
           value  for  a  system  with more than one incoming feed is "256"; systems with only one incoming feed
           should probably set this to "0".  The default value is "256".

       <u>ignorenewsgroups</u>
           Whether newsgroup creation control messages (newgroup and rmgroup) should be  fed  as  if  they  were
           posted  to  the  newsgroup  they are creating or deleting rather than to the newsgroups listed in the
           Newsgroups header field.  If this parameter is set, the newsgroup affected  by  the  control  message
           will  be  extracted  from  the  Control header field and the article will be fed as if its Newsgroups
           header field contained solely that newsgroup.  This is useful for routing control messages  to  peers
           when  they  are  posted to irrelevant newsgroups that shouldn't be matched against the peer's desired
           newsgroups in <u>newsfeeds</u>.  This is a boolean value and the default is false.

       <u>immediatecancel</u>
           When using the timecaf storage method, article cancels are normally just cached to be cancelled,  not
           cancelled  immediately.  If this is set to true, they will instead by cancelled as soon as the cancel
           is processed.  This is a boolean value and the default is false.

           This setting is ignored unless the timecaf storage method is used.

       <u>linecountfuzz</u>
           If set to something other than "0", the line count of the article is checked against the Lines header
           field body of the article (if present) and the article is rejected if the values differ by more  than
           this  amount.   A  reasonable setting is "5", which is the standard maximum signature length plus one
           (some injection software calculates the Lines header field before adding the signature).  The default
           value is "0", which tells INN not to check the Lines header field of incoming articles.

       <u>maxartsize</u>
           The maximum size of article (headers and body) that will be accepted by  the  server,  in  bytes.   A
           value  of "0" allows any size of article, but note that <b>innd</b> will crash if system memory is exceeded.
           The default value is "1000000" (approximately 1 MB).  This is checked against  the  article  in  wire
           format (CRLF at the end of each line, leading periods protected, and with the trailing "\r\n.\r\n" at
           the end).  See also <u>localmaxartsize</u>.

       <u>maxconnections</u>
           The maximum number of incoming NNTP connections <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) will accept.  The default value is "50".

       <u>pathalias</u>
           If  set,  this value is prepended as a path identity immediately to the right of <u>pathhost</u> in the Path
           header field body of accepted articles if it doesn't already appear in the Path  header  field.   The
           default value is unset.

           The  main purpose of this parameter is when there is some other path identity that you want to add to
           the Path header field of every article passing through your news server(s)  for  some  reason,  maybe
           because  you used to have some other path identity and you have peers that are configured to not send
           you articles that have already passed through that entity, and you can't get them to update  to  your
           current path identity for some reason.

       <u>pathcluster</u>
           If  set,  this  value  is appended as a path identity immediately to the left of <u>pathhost</u> in the Path
           header field body of accepted articles if it isn't already present as the  leftmost  element  of  the
           Path header field body.  The default value is unset.

           The  main  purpose  of  this  parameter is to set the name that you are using to identify yourself to
           peers (i.e. the path identity they should expect to see from you) in the  cases  where  that  doesn't
           match the main path identity <u>pathhost</u> for this news server.  (The most common case where that happens
           is  when  you  have multiple news servers that you want to present as a "united front" to the outside
           world and identify as the same virtual server, but you still want distinct path identities  so  those
           servers  can internally feed each other.  Also, even without internal feeds, <u>pathcluster</u> could be set
           to an organization name if the organization has multiple news servers.)

       <u>pgpverify</u>
           Whether to enable PGP verification of control messages other than cancel.  This is  a  boolean  value
           and  the  default  in the <u>inn.conf</u> sample file is based on whether configure found <b>pgp</b>, <b>pgpv</b>, <b>pgpgpg</b>,
           <b>gpgv</b>, <b>gpgv1</b>, <b>gpgv2</b>, <b>gpg</b>,  <b>gpg1</b>  or  <b>gpg2</b>.   Note  that  if  the  parameter  is  not  present  in  the
           configuration file, it defaults to false.

       <u>port</u>
           What TCP port <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) should listen on.  The default value is "119", the standard NNTP port.

       <u>remembertrash</u>
           By  default, <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) records rejected articles in history so that, if offered the same article again,
           it can be refused before it is sent.  If you wish to disable this behavior, set this to false.   This
           can  cause  a  substantial  increase in the amount of bandwidth consumed by incoming news if you have
           several peers and reject a lot of articles, so be careful with it.  Even if this is set to true,  INN
           won't  log  some  rejected  articles  to  history  if  there's reason to believe the article might be
           accepted if offered by a different peer, so there is usually no reason to set this to false (although
           doing so can decrease the size of the history file).  This is a boolean  value  and  the  default  is
           true.

       <u>sourceaddress</u>
           Which local IP address to bind to for outgoing NNTP sockets (used by <a href="../man8/innxmit.8.html">innxmit</a>(8) among other programs,
           as  well as <a href="../man8/innfeed.8.html">innfeed</a>(8) as long as not overridden by <u>bindaddress</u> in <a href="../man5/innfeed.conf.5.html">innfeed.conf</a>(5)).  This must be in
           dotted-quad format (nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn).  If set to "all", the operating system will choose  the  source
           IP address for outgoing connections.  The default value is unset.

       <u>sourceaddress6</u>
           Like <u>sourceaddress</u> but for IPv6 sockets.  Note that you will generally need to put double quotes ("")
           around this value if you set it, since IPv6 addresses contain colons.

       <u>verifygroups</u>
           Set  this to true to reject incoming articles which contain an unknown newsgroup in the whole list of
           newsgroups to which they are posted.  In case <u>wanttrash</u> is set to true, such articles will  still  be
           rejected.  This is a boolean value, and the default is false.

       <u>wanttrash</u>
           Set  this  to  true  if you want to file articles posted to unknown newsgroups (newsgroups not in the
           <u>active</u> file) into the "junk" newsgroup rather than rejecting them.  This is sometimes  useful  for  a
           transit  news  server  that  needs  to  propagate  articles  (according to the setting of "Aj" in the
           <u>newsfeeds</u> feed pattern) in all newsgroups regardless if they're carried locally.  This is  a  boolean
           value and the default is false.

           The  <u>logtrash</u>  parameter  specifies  whether  such  articles  should  be logged as posted to unwanted
           newsgroups in the <u>news</u> log file.

       <u>wipcheck</u>
           If INN is offered an article by a peer on one channel, it will return deferral responses  (code  436)
           to  all  other  offers  of  that  article  for this many seconds.  (After this long, if the peer that
           offered the article still hasn't sent it, it will be accepted  from  other  channels.)   The  default
           value is "5" and probably doesn't need to be changed.

       <u>wipexpire</u>
           How long, in seconds, to keep track of message IDs offered on a channel before expiring articles that
           still haven't been sent.  The default value is "10" and probably doesn't need to be changed.

   <b>History</b> <b>Settings</b>
       The following parameter affect the history database.

       <u>hismethod</u>
           Which  history  storage  method  to use.  The only currently supported value is "hisv6".  There is no
           default value; this parameter must be set.

           "hisv6"
               Stores history data in the INN history v6 format: <a href="../man5/history.5.html">history</a>(5)  text  file  and  a  number  of  <u>dbz</u>
               database  files;  this  may be in true history v6 format, or tagged hash format, depending on the
               build options.  Separation of these two is a project which has not yet been undertaken.

   <b>Article</b> <b>Storage</b>
       These parameters affect how articles are stored on disk.

       <u>cnfscheckfudgesize</u>
           If set to a value other than "0", the claimed size of articles in CNFS cycbuffs  is  checked  against
           <u>maxartsize</u>  plus  this  value,  and  if  larger, the CNFS cycbuff is considered corrupt.  This can be
           useful as a sanity check after a system crash, but be  careful  using  this  parameter  if  you  have
           changed <u>maxartsize</u> recently.  The default value is "0".

       <u>enableoverview</u>
           Whether  to  write  out  overview  data for articles.  If set to false, INN will run much faster, but
           reading news from the system will be impossible (the server will be for news transit only).  If  this
           option is set to true, <u>ovmethod</u> must also be set.  This is a boolean value and the default is true.

       <u>extraoverviewadvertised</u>
           Besides  the  seven  standard  overview  fields  (which  are  in  order  "Subject",  "From",  "Date",
           "Message-ID", "References", ":bytes" and ":lines") and the eighth "Xref:full" field required  by  INN
           in  order  to  handle  crossposts, it is possible to add other fields in the overview database.  This
           parameter expects a list of such header field names.   Overview  data  for  these  additional  header
           fields will be generated for each new article at the time of arrival.  For instance, if you specify:

               extraoverviewadvertised: [ Path Newsgroups ]

           it  implies that <b>nnrpd</b> will advertise "Path:full" and "Newsgroups:full" as the ninth and tenth fields
           in response to LIST OVERVIEW.FMT and that these two  header  field  bodies  will  be  stored  in  the
           overview  database  for  each  new  article.   It  may be a useful configuration to have as some news
           readers do article scoring with rules based on these two header fields.  Having them in the  overview
           database  permits  being  faster  at  scoring for these readers, without having to separately request
           them, but on the other hand these additional fields are also present in overview requests of all  the
           other readers, which slightly slows their reading.

           The  default  value  is an empty list (no additional fields are stored).  Owing to optimizations when
           <b>innd</b> parses the articles it receives, it is possible  that  all  the  values  in  the  list  are  not
           recognized by <b>innd</b> as standard header field names.  In such cases, <b>innd</b> will log an error in <u>news.err</u>
           at  startup  and  the  unrecognized  fields  will be discarded.  Moreover, the deprecated "Bytes" and
           "Lines" header fields, already present in the standard overview fields as metadata items,  cannot  be
           added.

           You  should  advertise  only  fields for which the overview database is consistent, that is to say it
           records the content or absence of these fields for <u>all</u> articles, including those already existing  in
           the  news  spool.   Consequently, if you decide to add or remove a field from your overview database,
           you  should  either  modify  <u>extraoverviewadvertised</u>  and  rebuild  your   overview   database   with
           <a href="../man8/makehistory.8.html">makehistory</a>(8)  after removing all existing overview files, or implement a transition period by first
           using <u>extraoverviewhidden</u> as described below.

           Use of a transition period can  accommodate  most  overview  reconfigurations,  but  certain  drastic
           changes may still require a complete overview rebuild.

           If  for instance you want to store the content of the Injection-Info header field body in addition to
           the fields already stored above, you should use:

               extraoverviewadvertised: [ Path Newsgroups ]
               extraoverviewhidden:     [ Injection-Info ]

           This way, "Injection-Info:full" will not be advertised by <b>nnrpd</b> but  will  be  stored  for  each  new
           article.   Once you know that all articles in your overview database record the content or absence of
           that new field (if <a href="../man5/expire.ctl.5.html">expire.ctl</a>(5) is parameterized so that all your articles  expire  within  30 days,
           you can assume the database is in such a state after 30 days -- however, note that time to expiration
           can  be  unpredictable  with CNFS and you then have to use "cnfsstat -a" for checking on when buffers
           have rolled over), you should put:

               extraoverviewadvertised: [ Path Newsgroups Injection-Info ]
               extraoverviewhidden:     [ ]

           The "Injection-Info" value must be added at the end of the list  because  order  matters  and  fields
           mentioned  in  <u>extraoverviewhidden</u>  are  generated  after those mentioned in <u>extraoverviewadvertised</u>.
           <b>nnrpd</b> will now advertise "Injection-Info:full" in response to the LIST OVERVIEW.FMT  command  ("full"
           indicates that the header field name appears followed by its value).

           Now  suppose  you  want  to  remove the content of the Newsgroups header field from the overview.  As
           order matters, the overview database will no longer  be  consistent  for  the  Injection-Info  header
           field.  Therefore, you need to specify:

               extraoverviewadvertised: [ Path ]
               extraoverviewhidden:     [ Injection-Info ]

           And once overview data is accurate for all articles, you should use:

               extraoverviewadvertised: [ Path Injection-Info ]
               extraoverviewhidden:     [ ]

           Note  that  you  have  to  restart  <b>nnrpd</b>  if  it  runs  as a daemon whenever you change the value of
           <u>extraoverviewadvertised</u>; a mere "ctlinnd xexec innd" is not enough.

       <u>extraoverviewhidden</u>
           This parameter should be used  in  conjunction  with  <u>extraoverviewadvertised</u>  (see  above  for  more
           details).   It  expects  a list of header field names.  Overview data for these header fields will be
           generated for each new article at the time of arrival  but,  contrary  to  the  fields  mentioned  in
           <u>extraoverviewadvertised</u>,  <b>nnrpd</b> will not advertise them in response to the LIST OVERVIEW.FMT command.
           It also implies that  <b>nnrpd</b>  will  not  look  in  the  overview  database  for  fields  mentioned  in
           <u>extraoverviewhidden</u>  when  it  handles  HDR,  XHDR  and XPAT requests as the overview database is not
           considered consistent yet for these fields; <b>nnrpd</b> will have to parse the  headers  of  the  requested
           articles in the news spool, which is slower than directly querying the overview database.

           The  default  value  is an empty list (no additional fields are stored).  Owing to optimizations when
           <b>innd</b> parses the articles it receives, it is possible  that  all  the  values  in  the  list  are  not
           recognized by <b>innd</b> as standard header field names.  In such cases, <b>innd</b> will log an error in <u>news.err</u>
           at  startup  and  the  unrecognized  fields  will be discarded.  Moreover, the deprecated "Bytes" and
           "Lines" header fields, already present in the standard overview fields as metadata items,  cannot  be
           added.

       <u>groupbaseexpiry</u>
           Whether  to  enable newsgroup-based expiry.  If set to false, article expiry is done based on storage
           class of storing method.  If set to true (and overview information is available), expiry is  done  by
           newsgroup  name.   This affects the format of <u>expire.ctl</u>.  This is a boolean value and the default is
           true.

       <u>mergetogroups</u>
           Whether to file all postings to "to.*" groups in the pseudonewsgroup "to".  If this is set  to  true,
           the newsgroup "to" must exist in the <u>active</u> file or INN will not start.  (See the discussion of "to."
           groups in <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) under CONTROL MESSAGES.)  This is a boolean value and the default is false.

       <u>nfswriter</u>
           For  servers  writing  articles,  determine whether the article spool is on NFS storage.  If set, INN
           attempts to flush articles to the spool in a more timely manner, rather than relying on the operating
           system to flush things such as the CNFS article bitmaps.  You should only set this parameter  if  you
           are  attempting  to  use  a shared NFS spool on a machine acting as a single writer within a cluster.
           This is a boolean value and the default is false.

       <u>overcachesize</u>
           How many cache slots to reserve for open overview files.  If  INN  is  writing  overview  files  (see
           <u>enableoverview</u>),  <u>ovmethod</u>  is  set  to "tradindexed", and this is set to a value other than "0", INN
           will keep around and open that many recently written-to overview files in case more articles come  in
           for  those newsgroups.  Every overview cache slot consumes two file descriptors, so be careful not to
           set this value too high.  You may be able to use the "ulimit -n" command to see how  many  open  file
           descriptors  your  operating  system  allows.   <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8)  also  uses  an open file descriptor for each
           incoming feed and outgoing channel or batch file, and if it runs out of open file descriptors, it may
           throttle and stop accepting new news.  The default value is "128" (which is probably still too low if
           you have a large number of file descriptors available).

           Please have a look at the documentation of the <u>rlimitnofile</u>  parameter,  as  increasing  the  default
           value may lead to an exhaustion of usable file descriptors.

           This setting is ignored unless <u>ovmethod</u> is set to "tradindexed".

       <u>ovgrouppat</u>
           If  set,  restricts  the  overview  data  stored  by  INN to only the newsgroups matching this comma-
           separated list of <u>uwildmat</u> expressions.  Newsgroups not matching this setting may  not  be  readable,
           and if <u>groupbaseexpiry</u> is set to true and the storage method for these newsgroups does not have self-
           expire functionality, storing overview data will fail.  The default is unset.

       <u>ovflushcount</u>
           How many articles received between flushing their overview data to disk.  This parameter is only used
           for  the  buffindexed  overview  storage  method,  and  defaults  to  "50".   (Flushing  to  disk  is
           parameterized  differently  for  other  methods:   <u>txn_nosync</u>   in   <u>ovdb.conf</u>,   <u>transrowlimit</u>   and
           <u>transtimelimit</u> in <u>ovsqlite.conf</u>, and always after each article arrival for tradindexed.)

           See <u>icdsynccount</u> (related to flushes of the <u>active</u> and <u>history</u> files) for more information about this
           trade-off between faster speed and more data loss if <b>innd</b> crashes.

       <u>ovmethod</u>
           Which  overview  storage  method  to  use.   Currently  supported  values  are "buffindexed", "ovdb",
           "ovsqlite"  and  "tradindexed".   There  is  no  default  value;  this  parameter  must  be  set   if
           <u>enableoverview</u> is true (the default).

           "buffindexed"
               It  stores overview data and index information into preconfigured large files like CNFS.  Fast at
               writing, the "buffindexed" overview storage method can keep up with a large feed more easily  and
               never  consumes  additional  disk  space beyond that allocated to these buffers.  The downside is
               that these buffers are hard to recover in case of corruption and somewhat slower for readers  and
               the  expiry  process.   Also, overview data is limited to 8 KB per article, which may lead to the
               lack of integration of a few articles with headers of unusual length into the overview  database.
               See the <a href="../man5/buffindexed.conf.5.html">buffindexed.conf</a>(5) man page for more details, and notably how to create the buffers.

           "ovdb"
               It  stores  overview  information into a Berkeley DB database, whose development pace has stalled
               these last years.  This method is fast and very robust, but may require more disk  space,  unless
               compression  is enabled.  Overview data is fetched one article at a time, which makes this method
               a bit slower than "ovsqlite" for readers.  See the <a href="../man5/ovdb.5.html">ovdb</a>(5) man page for more details.

           "ovsqlite"
               It stores overview information into an SQLite database, known for  its  long-term  stability  and
               compatibility.   Robust and faster than "ovdb" at reading ranges of overview data (since overview
               data is transferred in 128-kilobyte chunks between <b>ovsqlite-server</b> and <b>nnrpd</b>) but somewhat slower
               at writing, this method may require more disk space, unless  compression  is  enabled.   See  the
               <a href="../man5/ovsqlite.5.html">ovsqlite</a>(5) man page for more details.

           "tradindexed"
               It  uses  two files per newsgroup, one containing the overview data and one containing the index.
               Fast for readers, but slow to write to because it has to  update  two  files  for  each  incoming
               article.   Its main advantage is to be the best tested, the most reliable and the method with the
               best recovery tools (<b>tdx-util</b>).

       <u>storeonxref</u>
           If set to true, articles will be stored based on the newsgroup names in the Xref  header  field  body
           rather  than  in  the  Newsgroups  header field body.  This affects what the patterns in <u>storage.conf</u>
           apply to.  The primary interesting effect of setting this to true is to enable filing of all  control
           messages  according to what storage class the control pseudogroups are filed in rather than according
           to the newsgroups the control messages are posted to.  This is a boolean value  and  the  default  is
           true.

           If the tradspool article storage method is used, <u>storeonxref</u> must be true.

       <u>useoverchan</u>
           Whether to <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) should create overview data internally through <a href="../man3/libinnstorage.3.html">libinnstorage</a>(3).  If set to false,
           innd  creates  overview  data by itself.  If set to true, innd does not create; instead overview data
           must be created by <a href="../man8/overchan.8.html">overchan</a>(8) from an appropriate entry  in  <u>newsfeeds</u>.   Setting  to  true  may  be
           useful,  if  innd  cannot  keep up with incoming feed and the bottleneck is creation of overview data
           within innd.  This is a boolean value and the default is false.

       <u>wireformat</u>
           Only used with the tradspool storage method, this says whether to  write  articles  in  wire  format.
           Wire  format  means  storing  articles  with  "\r\n"  at the end of each line and with periods at the
           beginning of lines doubled, the article format required by the NNTP  protocol.   Articles  stored  in
           this  format  are suitable for sending directly to a network connection without requiring conversion,
           and therefore setting this to true can make the server more efficient.  The primary reason not to set
           this is if you have old existing software that looks around in the spool and doesn't  understand  how
           to  read  wire  format.   Storage  methods other than tradspool always store articles in wire format.
           This is a boolean value and the default is true.

       <u>xrefslave</u>
           Whether to act as the slave of another server.  If set, INN attempts to duplicate exactly the article
           numbering of the server feeding it by looking at the Xref header field body of incoming articles  and
           assigning  the  same  article numbers to articles as was noted in the Xref header field body from the
           upstream server.  The result is that clients should be able to point at either server interchangeably
           (using some load balancing scheme, for example) and see the same internal article numbering.  Servers
           with this parameter set should generally  only  have  one  upstream  feed,  and  should  always  have
           <u>nnrpdposthost</u>  set  to hand locally posted articles off to the master server.  The upstream should be
           careful to always feed articles in order (<a href="../man8/innfeed.8.html">innfeed</a>(8) can have problems with this in the  event  of  a
           backlog).  This is a boolean value and the default is false.

   <b>Reading</b>
       These  parameters  affect the behavior of INN for readers.  Most of them are used by <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8).  There are
       some special sets of settings that are broken out separately after the initial alphabetized list.

       <u>allownewnews</u>
           Whether to allow use of the NEWNEWS command by clients.  This command used to put a heavy load on the
           server in older versions of INN, but is now reasonably efficient, at least if only one  newsgroup  is
           specified  by  the  client.   This is a boolean value and the default is true.  If you use the <u>access</u>
           parameter in <u>readers.conf</u>, be sure to read about the way it overrides <u>allownewnews</u>.

       <u>articlemmap</u>
           Whether to attempt to mmap() articles.  Setting this to true will give  better  performance  on  most
           systems,  but some systems have problems with mmap().  If this is set to false, articles will be read
           into memory before being sent to readers.  This is a boolean value and the default is true.

       <u>clienttimeout</u>
           How long (in seconds) a client connection can be idle before it exits.  When setting this  parameter,
           be  aware  that  some newsreaders use the same connection for reading and posting and don't deal well
           with the connection timing out while a post is being composed.  If the system isn't having a  problem
           with  too  many  long-lived  connections,  it may be a good idea to increase this value to "3600" (an
           hour).  The default value is "1800" (thirty minutes).

       <u>initialtimeout</u>
           How long (in seconds) <b>nnrpd</b> will wait for the first command from a reader connection before  dropping
           the  connection.   This is a defensive timeout intended to protect the news server from badly behaved
           reader clients that open and abandon a multitude of connections  without  every  closing  them.   The
           default  value is "10" (ten seconds), which may need to be increased if many clients connect via slow
           network links.

       <u>msgidcachesize</u>
           How many cache slots to reserve for message-IDs to storage token translations.  When serving overview
           data to clients (NEWNEWS, OVER, etc.), <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8)  can  cache  the  storage  token  associated  with  a
           message-ID  and  save the cost of looking it up in the <u>history</u> file; for some configurations, setting
           this parameter can save more than 90% of the wall clock time for a session.   The  default  value  is
           "64000".

       <u>nfsreader</u>
           For  servers  reading  articles,  determine whether the article spool is on NFS storage.  If set, INN
           will attempt to force articles and overviews to be read directly from the NFS spool rather than  from
           cached copies.  You should only set this parameter if you are attempting to use a shared NFS spool on
           a machine acting as a reader within a cluster.  This is a boolean value and the default is false.

       <u>nfsreaderdelay</u>
           If  <u>nfsreader</u>  is set, INN will use the value of <u>nfsreaderdelay</u> to delay the apparent arrival time of
           articles to clients by this amount.  Note that  only  answers  to  GROUP  and  NEWNEWS  commands  are
           affected.   This value should be tuned based on the NFS cache timeouts locally.  The default is "60",
           that is to say one minute.

       <u>nnrpdcheckart</u>
           Whether <b>nnrpd</b> should check the existence of an article before listing it as present in response to an
           NNTP command (HDR, LISTGROUP, NEWNEWS, OVER, XPAT).  The primary use of this setting  is  to  prevent
           <b>nnrpd</b>  from  returning information about articles which are no longer present on the server but which
           still have overview data available.  Checking the existence of  articles  before  returning  overview
           information  slows  down the overview commands, but reduces the number of "article is missing" errors
           seen by the client.  This is a boolean value and the default is true.

           You may also want to  see  the  <u>groupexactcount</u>  parameter  in  <a href="../man5/readers.conf.5.html">readers.conf</a>(5)  which  controls  the
           computing of the estimated article count returned in NNTP commands (GROUP, LIST COUNTS, LISTGROUP).

       <u>nnrpdflags</u>
           When  <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8)  is  spawned  from  <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8), these flags are passed as arguments to the nnrpd process.
           This setting does not affect instances of nnrpd that are started in daemon mode,  or  instances  that
           are  started  via  another  listener  process  such  as  <a href="../man8/inetd.8.html">inetd</a>(8)  or  <a href="../man8/xinetd.8.html">xinetd</a>(8).   Shell quoting and
           metacharacters are not supported.  This is a string value and the default is unset.

       <u>nnrpdloadlimit</u>
           If set to a value other than "0", connections to nnrpd will be refused if the system load average  is
           higher than this value.  The default value is "16".

       <u>noreader</u>
           Normally,  <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) will fork a copy of <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8) for all incoming connections from hosts not listed in
           <u>incoming.conf</u>.  If this parameter is set to true, those connections will instead be rejected  with  a
           502  error  code.  This should be set to true for a transit-only server that doesn't support readers,
           or if nnrpd is running in daemon mode or being started out of inetd.  This is a boolean value and the
           default is false.

       <u>readerswhenstopped</u>
           Whether to allow readers to connect even if  the  server  is  paused  or  throttled.   This  is  only
           applicable  if <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8) is spawned from <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) rather than run out of inetd or in daemon mode.  This
           is a boolean value and the default is false.

       <u>readertrack</u>
           Whether to enable the tracking system for  client  behavior.   Tracked  information  is  recorded  to
           <u>pathlog</u>/tracklogs/log-<u>ID</u>,  where  ID  is  determined  by  nnrpd's PID and launch time.  Currently the
           information recorded includes initial connection and posting; only information about  clients  listed
           in   <u>nnrpd.track</u>   is   recorded.    In   addition,   every   posted   article   will   be  saved  in
           <u>pathlog</u>/trackposts/track.<u>message-id</u>, where <u>message-id</u> is the message ID  of  the  post.   This  is  a
           boolean value and the default is false.

       <u>tradindexedmmap</u>
           Whether  to  attempt to mmap() tradindexed overviews articles.  Setting this to true will give better
           performance on most systems, but some systems have problems with mmap().  If this is  set  to  false,
           overviews  will  be  read  into memory before being sent to readers.  This is a boolean value and the
           default is true.

       INN has optional support for generating keyword information automatically  from  article  body  text  and
       putting  that information in overview for the use of clients that know to look for it (HDR, OVER and XPAT
       commands).  The following parameters control that feature, which should be considered <u>experimental</u>.   Its
       very simple text tokenization works only on plain-text ASCII articles, and totally lacks of understanding
       of anything other than English.  Articles encoded in Base64 or Quoted-Printable, having a MIME structure,
       or farther afield from English will have garbage in the generated Keywords header field.

       This feature may be too slow if you're taking a substantial feed, and probably will not be useful for the
       average  news  reader;  enabling  this is not recommended unless you have some specific intention to take
       advantage of it.

       <u>keywords</u>
           Whether the keyword generation support should be enabled.  This is a boolean value and the default is
           false.

           If an article already contains a Keywords header  field,  no  keyword  generation  is  done  and  the
           original Keywords header field is kept untouched.

           In  order  to  use  this  feature,  the regex library should be available and INN configured with the
           <b>--enable-keywords</b> flag.  Otherwise, no keywords will be generated, even though this boolean value  is
           set   to   true.    You  also  have  to  add  the  Keywords  header  field  into  the  overview  with
           <u>extraoverviewadvertised</u> or <u>extraoverviewhidden</u>.

       <u>keyartlimit</u>
           Articles larger than this value in bytes will not have keywords generated for them  (since  it  would
           take too long to do so).  The default value is "100000" (approximately 100 KB).

       <u>keylimit</u>
           Maximum  number  of  bytes allocated for keyword data.  If there are more keywords than will fit into
           this many bytes when separated by commas, the rest are discarded.  The default value is "512".

       <u>keymaxwords</u>
           Maximum number of keywords that will be generated for an article.  (The keyword generation code  will
           attempt  to  discard  "noise"  words  in English, so the number of keywords actually written into the
           overview will usually be smaller than this even if the maximum number of  keywords  is  found.)   The
           default value is "250".

   <b>Posting</b>
       These  parameters  are  only  used  by  <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8),  <a href="../man1/inews.1.html">inews</a>(1),  and  other programs that accept or generate
       postings.  There are some special sets of settings that are  broken  out  separately  after  the  initial
       alphabetized list.

       <u>addinjectiondate</u>
           Whether  to  add  an Injection-Date header field to all local posts.  This is a boolean value and the
           default is true.

           Note that no Injection-Date header fields will be added to local  posts  already  containing  both  a
           Message-ID header field and a Date header field.  This is done in conformance with standards, to help
           minimize  the  possibility of a loop in e-mail gatewaying and ensure that a newly injected article is
           not treated as a new, separate article in case of multiple injection of the same article to different
           injecting agents.

       <u>addinjectionpostingaccount</u>
           Whether to add a posting-account attribute to the Injection-Info header field body to all local posts
           giving the username assigned to the user at connection time  or  after  authentication.   This  is  a
           boolean  value  and  the  default is false.  There is no intrinsic support for obfuscating the value.
           That has to be done with a user-written Perl filter, if desired.

       <u>addinjectionpostinghost</u>
           Whether to add a posting-host attribute to the Injection-Info header field body to  all  local  posts
           giving  an FQDN (when known, by reverse lookup of the client IP address) and IP address of the system
           from which the post was received.  This is a boolean value and the default is true.   Note  that  INN
           either does not add this attribute or adds the name (when known) and IP address of the client.  There
           is  no  intrinsic  support  for obfuscating the name of the client.  That has to be done with a user-
           written Perl filter, if desired.

           When this parameter is set to true, an FQDN (obtained by reverse lookup of the client IP address  or,
           if  unknown,  the IP address itself) of the client is also added to the Path header field body, after
           the "!.POSTED" diagnostic.

       <u>checkincludedtext</u>
           Whether to check local postings for the ratio of new to quoted text and reject them if that ratio  is
           under  50%.   Included text is recognized by looking for lines beginning with "&gt;", "|", or ":".  This
           is a boolean value and the default is false.

       <u>complaints</u>
           The value of the mail-complaints-to attribute of the Injection-Info header field added to  all  local
           posts.   The  default  is the newsmaster's e-mail address.  (If the newsmaster, selected at configure
           time and defaulting to "usenet", doesn't contain "@", the address will consist of the newsmaster,  an
           "@", and the value of <u>fromhost</u>.)

       <u>fromhost</u>
           Contains  a  domain  used to construct e-mail addresses.  The address of the local news administrator
           will be given as &lt;user&gt;@<u>fromhost</u>, where &lt;user&gt; is the newsmaster user set at compile  time  ("usenet"
           by  default).   This  setting  will  also  be  used  by <a href="../man8/mailpost.8.html">mailpost</a>(8) to fully qualify addresses and by
           <a href="../man1/inews.1.html">inews</a>(1) to generate the Sender header field (and the From header field if missing).   The  value  of
           the  FROMHOST  environment  variable,  if  set,  overrides  this  setting.   The default is the fully
           qualified domain name of the local host.

       <u>localmaxartsize</u>
           The maximum article size (in bytes) for locally posted articles.  Articles larger than this  will  be
           rejected.   A  value  of  "0"  allows any size of article, but note that <b>nnrpd</b> and <b>innd</b> will crash if
           system memory is exceeded.  See also <u>maxartsize</u>, which applies to all articles including those posted
           locally.  The default value is "1000000" (approximately 1 MB).

       <u>moderatormailer</u>
           The address to which to send submissions for moderated groups.  It is only  used  if  the  <u>moderators</u>
           file  doesn't  exist,  or  if the moderated group to which an article is posted is not matched by any
           entry in that file, and takes the same form as an entry in  the  <u>moderators</u>  file.   In  most  cases,
           "%<a href="mailto:s@moderators.isc.org">s@moderators.isc.org</a>"  is  a  good  value  for  this parameter ("%s" is expanded into a form of the
           newsgroup name).  See <a href="../man5/moderators.5.html">moderators</a>(5) for more details about the syntax.  The  default  is  unset.   If
           this  parameter isn't set and an article is posted to a moderated group that does not have a matching
           entry in the <u>moderators</u> file, the posting will be rejected with an error.

       <u>nnrpdauthsender</u>
           Whether to generate a Sender header field based on reader authentication.  If this parameter is  set,
           a  Sender header field will be added to local posts containing the identity assigned by <u>readers.conf</u>.
           If the assigned identity does not include an "@", the reader's hostname is used.  If  this  parameter
           is  set  but  no identity is assigned, the Sender header field will be removed from all posts even if
           the poster includes one.  This is a boolean value and the default is false.

       <u>nnrpdposthost</u>
           If set, <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8) and <a href="../man1/rnews.1.html">rnews</a>(1) will pass all locally posted articles to the specified host rather than
           trying to inject them locally.  See also <u>nnrpdpostport</u>.  This should always be set  if  <u>xrefslave</u>  is
           true.  The default value is unset.

       <u>nnrpdpostport</u>
           The port on the remote server to connect to to post when <u>nnrpdposthost</u> is used.  The default value is
           "119".

       <u>organization</u>
           What  to  put  in the Organization header field body if it is left blank by the poster.  The value of
           the ORGANIZATION environment variable, if set, overrides this setting.  The default is  unset,  which
           tells INN not to insert an Organization header field.

       <u>spoolfirst</u>
           If  true, <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8) will spool new articles rather than attempting to send them to <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8).  If false,
           nnrpd will spool articles only if it receives an error trying to send them to innd.  Setting this  to
           true  can  be  useful  if  nnrpd  must  respond as fast as possible to the client; however, when set,
           articles will not appear to readers until they are given to innd.  nnrpd won't do  this;  "rnews  -U"
           must be run periodically to take the spooled articles and post them.  This is a boolean value and the
           default is false.

       <u>strippostcc</u>
           Whether  to  strip  To,  Cc,  and Bcc header fields out of all local posts via <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8).  The primary
           purpose of this setting is to prevent abuse of the news server by posting to a  moderated  group  and
           including  To  or  Cc  header  fields  in  the  post so that the news server will send the article to
           arbitrary addresses.  INN now protects against this abuse in other ways provided  <u>mta</u>  is  set  to  a
           command  that  includes "%s" and honors it, so this is generally no longer needed.  This is a boolean
           value and the default is false.

       <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8) has support for controlling  high-volume  posters  via  an  exponential  backoff  algorithm,  as
       configured by the following parameters.

       Exponential  posting  backoff  works as follows: news clients are indexed by IP address (or username, see
       <u>backoffauth</u> below).  Each time a post is received from an IP address,  the  time  of  posting  is  stored
       (along  with the previous sleep time, see below).  After a configurable number of posts in a configurable
       period of time, <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8) will begin to sleep for increasing  periods  of  time  before  actually  posting
       anything  (posting backoff is therefore activated).  Posts will still be accepted, but at an increasingly
       reduced rate.

       After backoff has been activated, the length of time to sleep is computed based on the difference in time
       between the last posting and the current posting.  If this difference is less than  <u>backoffpostfast</u>,  the
       new  sleep  time  will  be  1  +  (previous  sleep  time  *  <u>backoffk</u>).   If this difference is less than
       <u>backoffpostslow</u> but greater than <u>backoffpostfast</u>, then the new sleep time will equal the  previous  sleep
       time.  If this difference is greater than <u>backoffpostslow</u>, the new sleep time is zero and posting backoff
       is  deactivated  for  this  poster.   (Note that this does not mean posting backoff cannot be reactivated
       later in the session.)

       Exponential posting backoff will  not  be  enabled  unless  <u>backoffdb</u>  is  set  and  <u>backoffpostfast</u>  and
       <u>backoffpostslow</u> are set to something other than their default values.

       Here are the parameters that control exponential posting backoff:

       <u>backoffauth</u>
           Whether  to  index  posting  backoffs  by  user  rather than by source IP address.  You must be using
           authentication in <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8) for a value of true to have any meaning.  This is a boolean value and  the
           default is false.

       <u>backoffdb</u>
           The  path  to a directory, writeable by the news user, that will contain the backoff database.  There
           is no default for this parameter; you must provide a path to a creatable or  writeable  directory  to
           enable exponential backoff.

       <u>backoffk</u>
           The  amount to multiply the previous sleep time by if the user is still posting too quickly.  A value
           of "2" will double the sleep time for each excessive post.  The default value is "1".

       <u>backoffpostfast</u>
           Postings from the same identity that arrive in less than  this  amount  of  time  (in  seconds)  will
           trigger increasing sleep time in the backoff algorithm.  The default value is "0".

       <u>backoffpostslow</u>
           Postings  from  the  same  identity that arrive in greater than this amount of time (in seconds) will
           reset the backoff algorithm.  Another way to look at this constant is to realize that posters will be
           allowed to generate at most 86400/<u>backoffpostslow</u> posts per day.  The default value is "1".

       <u>backofftrigger</u>
           This many postings are allowed before the backoff algorithm  is  triggered.   The  default  value  is
           "10000".

   <b>TLS/SSL</b> <b>Support</b> <b>for</b> <b>Reading</b> <b>and</b> <b>Posting</b>
       Here are the parameters used by <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8) to provide TLS/SSL support.

       The parameters related to certificates are:

       <u>tlscafile</u>
           The  path to a file containing certificate authority root certificates, used to present a trust chain
           to a TLS client.  This parameter is only used if <b>nnrpd</b> is built with TLS/SSL  support.   The  default
           value is an empty string.

       <u>tlscapath</u>
           The  path  to  a  directory  containing  certificate  authority  root certificates.  Each file in the
           directory should contain one CA certificate, and the name of the file should be the CA  subject  name
           hash  value.   See  the  OpenSSL  documentation for more information.  This parameter is only used if
           <b>nnrpd</b> is built with TLS/SSL support.  The default value is <u>pathetc</u>.

       <u>tlscertfile</u>
           The path to a file containing the server certificate to present to TLS clients.   This  parameter  is
           only used if <b>nnrpd</b> is built with TLS/SSL support.  The default value is <u>pathetc</u>/cert.pem.

           If  you  want  to  use  a  complete  certificate  chain, you can directly put it in <u>tlscertfile</u> (like
           Apache's <u>SSLCertificateFile</u> directive).  Alternately, you can put a single certificate in <u>tlscertfile</u>
           and use <u>tlscafile</u> for additional certificates needed to complete the chain, like a separate authority
           root certificate.

           More concretely, when using Let's Encrypt certificates, Certbot's files can be installed as follows:

               tlscapath:      /etc/letsencrypt/live/news.server.com
               tlscertfile:    /etc/letsencrypt/live/news.server.com/fullchain.pem
               tlskeyfile:     /etc/letsencrypt/live/news.server.com/privkey.pem

           or:

               tlscapath:      /etc/letsencrypt/live/news.server.com
               tlscafile:      /etc/letsencrypt/live/news.server.com/chain.pem
               tlscertfile:    /etc/letsencrypt/live/news.server.com/cert.pem
               tlskeyfile:     /etc/letsencrypt/live/news.server.com/privkey.pem

           Make sure that the permission rights are properly set so that the news user or  the  news  group  can
           read  these  directories and files (typically, he should access <u>/etc/letsencrypt/live/news.server.com</u>
           and <u>/etc/letsencrypt/archive/news.server.com</u> where the real keys are located,  and  the  private  key
           should not be world-readable).

           If  you  prefer  to point to files outside the directory of Let's Encrypt, you may add a post-renewal
           hook for Let's Encrypt to copy the generated files to another location, and give  them  the  expected
           rights.

       <u>tlskeyfile</u>
           The  path  to  a  file containing the encryption key for the server certificate named in <u>tlscertfile</u>.
           This may be the same as <u>tlscertfile</u> if, when you created the certificate, you put the key in the same
           file (if, for example, you gave the same file name to both the <b>-out</b> and <b>-keyout</b> options  to  "openssl
           req").   This  parameter  is  only used if <b>nnrpd</b> is built with TLS/SSL support.  The default value is
           <u>pathetc</u>/key.pem.

           This file must only be readable by the news user or <b>nnrpd</b> will refuse to use it.

       Finally, here are the parameters that can be used to tighten the level of security provided by TLS/SSL in
       case new attacks exploitable in NNTP on the TLS protocol or some supported cipher suite are discovered:

       <u>tlsciphers</u>
           The string describing the cipher suites OpenSSL will support for TLS 1.2 and  below.   See  OpenSSL's
           <a href="../man1/ciphers.1.html">ciphers</a>(1)  command  documentation  for  details.  The default is unset, which uses OpenSSL's default
           cipher suite list.

       <u>tlsciphers13</u>
           The string describing the cipher suites OpenSSL will support for TLS 1.3.  See  OpenSSL's  <a href="../man1/ciphers.1.html">ciphers</a>(1)
           command  documentation  for details.  The default is unset, which uses OpenSSL's default cipher suite
           list.

           Note that a separate cipher suite configuration parameter  is  needed  for  TLS 1.3  because  TLS 1.3
           cipher suites are not compatible with TLS 1.2, and vice-versa.  In order to avoid issues where legacy
           TLS 1.2 cipher suite configuration configured in the <u>tlsciphers</u> parameter would inadvertently disable
           all TLS 1.3 cipher suites, the <u>inn.conf</u> configuration has been separated out.

       <u>tlscompression</u>
           Whether  to  enable or disable TLS/SSL-level compression support, if the negotiated protocol supports
           it (notably, TLS 1.3 no longer supports it).  This is a boolean and the default is false, that is  to
           say  compression  is  disabled, so as to follow the best current practices for a secure use of TLS in
           application protocols (see RFC 8143 for NNTP).

           Note that enabling TLS/SSL-level compression will be possible only if the  OpenSSL  library  INN  has
           been built with, supports that feature.

       <u>tlseccurve</u>
           The  name  of  the  elliptic  curve  to  use  for ephemeral key exchanges.  To see the list of curves
           supported by OpenSSL, use "openssl ecparam -list_curves".

           The default is unset, which means an appropriate curve is auto-selected (if your OpenSSL  version  is
           at least 1.0.2 or you are using LibreSSL) or the NIST P-256 curve is used.

           This option is only effective if your OpenSSL version has ECDH support.

       <u>tlspreferserverciphers</u>
           Whether  to  let  the  client or the server decide the preferred cipher suite, signature algorithm or
           elliptic curve to use for an incoming connection.  This is a boolean and the default is true, that is
           to say the server will choose following its own preferences.

       <u>tlsprotocols</u>
           The list of TLS/SSL protocol versions to support.  Valid protocols are <b>SSLv2</b>, <b>SSLv3</b>, <b>TLSv1</b>,  <b>TLSv1.1</b>,
           <b>TLSv1.2</b> and <b>TLSv1.3</b>.  The default value is to only allow secure TLS protocols:

               tlsprotocols: [ TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3 ]

           Note  that  the listed protocols will be enabled only if the OpenSSL library INN has been built with,
           supports them.   In  case  OpenSSL  supports  protocols  more  recent  than  TLSv1.3,  they  will  be
           automatically enabled (which anyway is fine regarding security, as newer protocols are supposed to be
           more secure).

           "SSLv2"  was  formally  deprecated  by  RFC 6176  in 2011, "SSLv3" by RFC 7568 in 2015, "TLSv1.0" and
           "TLSv1.1" by RFC 8996 in 2021.

   <b>Monitoring</b>
       These parameters control the behavior of <a href="../man8/innwatch.8.html">innwatch</a>(8), the program that monitors INN and informs the  news
       administrator if anything goes wrong with it.

       <u>doinnwatch</u>
           Whether to start <a href="../man8/innwatch.8.html">innwatch</a>(8) from rc.news.  This is a boolean value, and the default is true.

       <u>innwatchbatchspace</u>
           Free  space  in <u>pathoutgoing</u>, in <a href="../man8/inndf.8.html">inndf</a>(8) output units (normally kilobytes), at which <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) will be

       <u>innwatchlibspace</u>
           Free space in <u>pathdb</u>, in <a href="../man8/inndf.8.html">inndf</a>(8) output  units  (normally  kilobytes),  at  which  <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8)  will  be
           throttled by <a href="../man8/innwatch.8.html">innwatch</a>(8), assuming a default <u>innwatch.ctl</u>.  The default value is "25000".

       <u>innwatchloload</u>
           Load average times 100 at which <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) will be restarted by <a href="../man8/innwatch.8.html">innwatch</a>(8) (undoing a previous pause or
           throttle),  assuming a default <u>innwatch.ctl</u>.  The default value is "1000" (that is, a load average of
           10.00).

       <u>innwatchhiload</u>
           Load average times 100 at which  <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8)  will  be  throttled  by  <a href="../man8/innwatch.8.html">innwatch</a>(8),  assuming  a  default
           <u>innwatch.ctl</u>.  The default value is "2000" (that is, a load average of 20.00).

       <u>innwatchpauseload</u>
           Load  average  times  100  at  which  <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8)  will  be  paused  by  <a href="../man8/innwatch.8.html">innwatch</a>(8),  assuming a default
           <u>innwatch.ctl</u>.  The default value is "1500" (that is, a load average of 15.00).

       <u>innwatchsleeptime</u>
           How long (in seconds) <a href="../man8/innwatch.8.html">innwatch</a>(8) will sleep between each check of INN.  The default value is "600".

       <u>innwatchspoolnodes</u>
           Free inodes in <u>patharticles</u> at which <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) will be throttled by  <a href="../man8/innwatch.8.html">innwatch</a>(8),  assuming  a  default
           <u>innwatch.ctl</u>.  The default value is "200".

       <u>innwatchspoolspace</u>
           Free  space in <u>patharticles</u> and <u>pathoverview</u>, in <a href="../man8/inndf.8.html">inndf</a>(8) output units (normally kilobytes), at which
           <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) will be throttled by <a href="../man8/innwatch.8.html">innwatch</a>(8), assuming a default  <u>innwatch.ctl</u>.   The  default  value  is
           "25000".

   <b>Logging</b>
       These parameters control what information INN logs.

       <u>docnfsstat</u>
           Whether  to  start  <a href="../man8/cnfsstat.8.html">cnfsstat</a>(8)  when  <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8)  is started.  cnfsstat will log the status of all CNFS
           cycbuffs to syslog on a periodic basis (frequency is the default for  "cnfsstat  -l",  currently  600
           seconds).  This is a boolean value and the default is false.

       <u>htmlstatus</u>
           Whether <b>innd</b> should write the status report as HTML file or in plain text.  The HTML status file goes
           to <u>pathhttp</u>/inn_status.html, while the plain text status file is written to <u>pathlog</u>/inn.status.  This
           is  a  boolean  value  and the default is true (an HTML status file is written).  Also see the <u>status</u>
           parameter.

       <u>incominglogfrequency</u>
           How many articles to process on an incoming channel before logging the activity.  The  default  value
           is "200".

       <u>logartsize</u>
           Whether  the size of accepted articles (in bytes) should be written to the article log file.  This is
           useful for flow rate statistics and is recommended.  This is a boolean value and the default is true.

       <u>logcancelcomm</u>
           Set this to true to log "ctlinnd cancel" commands to syslog.  This is a boolean value and the default
           is false.

       <u>logcycles</u>
           How many old logs <a href="../man8/scanlogs.8.html">scanlogs</a>(8) keeps.  <a href="../man8/scanlogs.8.html">scanlogs</a>(8) is generally run by <a href="../man8/news.daily.8.html">news.daily</a>(8) and will  archive
           compressed copies of this many days worth of old logs.  The default value is "3".

       <u>logipaddr</u>
           Whether the verified name of the remote feeding host should be logged to the article log for incoming
           articles  rather than the last entry in the Path header field body.  The only reason to ever set this
           to false is due to some interactions with <u>newsfeeds</u> flags; see  <a href="../man5/newsfeeds.5.html">newsfeeds</a>(5)  for  more  information.
           This is a boolean value and the default is true.

       <u>logsitename</u>
           Whether the names of the sites to which accepted articles will be sent should be put into the article
           log  file.   This is useful for debugging and statistics.  This is a boolean value and the default is
           true.

       <u>logstatus</u>
           Whether <b>innd</b> should write a shortened version of its status report to syslog  every  <u>status</u>  seconds.
           This  is  a boolean value and the default is true.  If set to true, see the <u>status</u> parameter for more
           details on how to enable status reporting.

       <u>logtrash</u>
           Whether <b>innd</b> should add a line in the <u>news</u> log file to report unwanted newsgroups  (that  is  to  say
           newsgroups not locally carried by the news server).  This is a boolean value and the default is true.
           It may be useful to set it to false when <u>wanttrash</u> is set to true.

       <u>nnrpdoverstats</u>
           Whether  nnrpd  overview  statistics  should  be logged via syslog.  This can be useful for measuring
           overview performance.  This is a boolean value and the default is true.

       <u>nntplinklog</u>
           Whether to put the storage API token for accepted articles (used by nntplink)  in  the  article  log.
           This is a boolean value and the default is false.

       <u>stathist</u>
           Where  to  write  history  statistics  for  analysis with <u>contrib/stathist</u>; this can be modified with
           <a href="../man8/ctlinnd.8.html">ctlinnd</a>(8) while <b>innd</b> is running.  Logging does not occur unless a path is given,  and  there  is  no
           default value.

       <u>status</u>
           How  frequently  (in  seconds)  <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8)  should  write out a status report.  The report is written to
           <u>pathhttp</u>/inn_status.html or <u>pathlog</u>/inn.status depending on the value of <u>htmlstatus</u>.  If this is  set
           to  "0" or "false", status reporting is disabled.  The default value is "600" (that is to say reports
           are written every 10 minutes).

       <u>timer</u>
           How frequently (in seconds) <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) should report performance timings to syslog.  If this is  set  to
           "0",  performance  timing  is  disabled.   Enabling  this is highly recommended, and <a href="../man8/innreport.8.html">innreport</a>(8) can
           produce a nice summary of the timings.  If set to "0",  performance  timings  in  <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8)  are  also
           disabled,  although  <b>nnrpd</b>  always  reports  statistics  on  exit and therefore any non-zero value is
           equivalent for it.  The default value is "600" (that is to say performance timings are reported every
           10 minutes).

   <b>System</b> <b>Tuning</b>
       The following parameters can be modified to tune  the  low-level  operation  of  INN.   In  general,  you
       shouldn't need to modify any of them except possibly <u>rlimitnofile</u> unless the server is having difficulty.

       <u>badiocount</u>
           How many read or write failures until a channel is put to sleep or closed.  The default value is "5".

       <u>blockbackoff</u>
           Each  time  an  attempted  write  returns  EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK, <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) will wait for an increasing
           number of seconds before trying it again.  This is the multiplier for  the  sleep  time.   If  you're
           having  trouble with channel feeds not keeping up, it may be good to change this value to "2" or "3",
           since then when the channel fills INN will try again in a couple of seconds rather than  waiting  two
           minutes.  The default value is "120".

       <u>chaninacttime</u>
           The time (in seconds) to wait between noticing inactive channels.  The default value is "600".

       <u>chanretrytime</u>
           How many seconds to wait before a channel restarts.  The default value is "300".

       <u>datamovethreshold</u>
           The  threshold  for  deciding  whether  to  move already-read data to the top of buffer or extend the
           buffer.  The buffer described here is used for reading NNTP data.  Increasing this value may  improve
           performance,  but  it  should not be increased on Systems with insufficient memory.  Permitted values
           are between "0" and "1048576" (out of range values are treated as "1048576") and the default value is
           "16384".

       <u>icdsynccount</u>
           How many article writes between updating the <u>active</u> and <u>history</u> files.  The default value is "10".

           This is a trade-off between faster speed and more data loss if <b>innd</b> crashes (or the  system  crashes,
           or  loses  power,  etc.).   The  higher  this  parameter is, the less frequent syncs are done.  It is
           essentially the frequency of checkpoints: the maximum number of articles that may be orphaned in case
           of a crash as they wouldn't have been recorded in the <u>history</u> file.  Besides, the missing updates  to
           the <u>active</u> file would cause other problems later, such as duplicate article numbers and corresponding
           errors  when  storing new articles.  (If <b>innd</b> has crashed, you can fix these errors by rebuilding the
           <u>history</u> file and overview with <a href="../man8/makehistory.8.html">makehistory</a>(8).  The <u>active</u> file will be automatically  be  renumbered
           after that operation.)

       <u>keepmmappedthreshold</u>
           When  using buffindexed, retrieving overview data (that is, responding to OVER or running expireover)
           causes mmapping of all overview data blocks which include requested overview data for newsgroup.  But
           for high volume newsgroups like control.cancel, this may cause too much mmapping at once  leading  to
           system  resource  problems.   To avoid this, if the amount to be mmapped exceeds <u>keepmmappedthreshold</u>
           (in KB), buffindexed  mmap's  just  one  overview  block  (8 KB).   This  parameter  is  specific  to
           buffindexed overview storage method.  The default value is "1024" (1 MB).

       <u>maxcmdreadsize</u>
           If  set to anything other than "0", maximum buffer size (in bytes) for reading NNTP command will have
           this value.  It should not be large on systems which are slow to process and store articles, as  that
           would  lead  to <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) spending a long time on each channel and keeping other channels waiting.  The
           default value is BUFSIZ defined in stdio.h (usually between "1024" and "8192" in  most  environments,
           see <a href="../man3/setbuf.3.html">setbuf</a>(3)).

       <u>maxforks</u>
           How many times to attempt a <a href="../man2/fork.2.html">fork</a>(2) before giving up.  The default value is "10".

       <u>maxlisten</u>
           How  many  incoming  connections  can queue up in the listen backlog for <b>innd</b>, <b>nnrpd</b> and two overview
           storage methods ("ovdb" and "ovsqlite").  The default value is "128" and should be raised in case you
           notice that some connection requests get dropped.

       <u>nicekids</u>
           If set to anything other than "0", all child processes of <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) will have this <a href="../man2/nice.2.html">nice</a>(2) value.  This
           is usually used to give all child processes of <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) a lower priority (higher nice value)  so  that
           <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) can get the lion's share of the CPU when it needs it.  The default value is "4".

       <u>nicenewnews</u>
           If  set  to  anything  greater  than  "0",  all <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8) processes that receive and process a NEWNEWS
           command will <a href="../man2/nice.2.html">nice</a>(2) themselves to this value (giving other nnrpd processes a higher priority).   The
           default  value  is  "0".  Note that this value will be ignored if set to a lower value than <u>nicennrpd</u>
           (or <u>nicekids</u> if <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8) is spawned from <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8)).

       <u>nicennrpd</u>
           If set to anything greater than "0", all <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8) processes will <a href="../man2/nice.2.html">nice</a>(2) themselves  to  this  value.
           This gives other news processes a higher priority and can help <a href="../man8/overchan.8.html">overchan</a>(8) keep up with incoming news
           (if  that's  the  object,  be sure <a href="../man8/overchan.8.html">overchan</a>(8) isn't also set to a lower priority via <u>nicekids</u>).  The
           default value is "0", which will cause <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8) processes spawned from <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) to use  the  value  of
           <u>nicekids</u>,  while  <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8)  run  as  a  daemon  will  use the system default priority.  Note that for
           <a href="../man8/nnrpd.8.html">nnrpd</a>(8) processes spawned from <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8), this value will be ignored if set  to  a  value  lower  than
           <u>nicekids</u>.

       <u>pauseretrytime</u>
           Wait for this many seconds before noticing inactive channels.  Wait for this many seconds before innd
           processes  articles when it's paused or the number of channel write failures exceeds <u>badiocount</u>.  The
           default value is "300".

       <u>peertimeout</u>
           How long (in seconds) an <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) incoming channel may be inactive before innd closes it.  The default
           value is "3600" (an hour).

       <u>rlimitnofile</u>
           The maximum number of file descriptors that <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) or <a href="../man8/innfeed.8.html">innfeed</a>(8) can have open at once.  If  <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8)
           or  <a href="../man8/innfeed.8.html">innfeed</a>(8) attempts to open more file descriptors than this value, it is possible the program may
           throttle or otherwise  malfunction  or  suffer  reduced  functionality.   The  number  of  open  file
           descriptors is roughly the maximum number of incoming feeds and outgoing batches for <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8) added to
           the  number of outgoing streams for <a href="../man8/innfeed.8.html">innfeed</a>(8) and, if you are using the tradindexed overview method,
           the value of the <u>overcachesize</u> parameter.  If <u>rlimitnofile</u> is set to a negative  value,  the  default
           limit  of  the  operating  system  will be used; this will normally be adequate on systems other than
           Solaris.  Nearly all operating systems have some hard maximum limit beyond which this value cannot be
           raised, usually either 256, 1024, or 65536.  The default value of this parameter is "-1".

           Setting this parameter to "256" on Solaris systems is highly recommended for 32-bit Solaris  versions
           or  32-bit  applications running on 64-bit Solaris, as well as 64-bit Solaris versions prior to 11.0.
           See         the         Solaris         documentation         about         file          descriptors
           &lt;https://support.oracle.com/knowledge/Sun%20Microsystems/1005979_1.html&gt; for more details.

           Note  for  expert  users  building  INN  from  sources: if you need using more than "FD_SETSIZE" file
           descriptors (as defined in the <u>sys/select.h</u> system header,  usually  defaulting  to  1024),  you  can
           increase  this  value  for  instance  to  "4096" by rebuilding INN with the "-DLARGE_FD_SETSIZE=4096"
           option given to the compiler.

   <b>Paths</b> <b>Names</b>
       <u>patharchive</u>
           Where to store archived news.  The default value is <u>pathspool</u>/archive.

       <u>patharticles</u>
           The path to where the news articles are stored (for storage methods other than  CNFS).   The  default
           value is <u>pathspool</u>/articles.

       <u>pathbin</u>
           The path to the news binaries.  The default value is <u>pathnews</u>/bin.

       <u>pathcontrol</u>
           The  path  to  the  files  that handle control messages.  The code for handling each separate type of
           control message is located here.  Be very careful what you put in this directory with a  name  ending
           in ".pl", as it can potentially be a severe security risk.  The default value is <u>pathbin</u>/control.

       <u>pathdb</u>
           The  path  to  the  database  files  used and updated by the server (currently, <u>active</u>, <u>active.times</u>,
           <u>history</u> and its indices, and <u>newsgroups</u>).  The default value is <u>pathnews</u>/db.

       <u>pathetc</u>
           The path to the news configuration files.  The default value is <u>pathnews</u>/etc.

       <u>pathfilter</u>
           The path to the Perl and Python filters.  The default value is <u>pathbin</u>/filter.

       <u>pathhttp</u>
           Where any HTML files (such as periodic status reports) are placed.  If the  news  reports  should  be
           available in real-time on the web, the files in this directory should be served by a web server.  The
           default value is the value of <u>pathnews</u>/http.

       <u>pathincoming</u>
           Location where incoming batched news is stored.  The default value is <u>pathspool</u>/incoming.

       <u>pathlog</u>
           Where the news log files are written.  The default value is <u>pathnews</u>/log.

       <u>pathnews</u>
           The home directory of the news user and usually the root of the news hierarchy.  There is no default;
           this parameter must be set in <u>inn.conf</u> or INN will refuse to start.

       <u>pathoutgoing</u>
           Default location for outgoing feed files.  The default value is <u>pathspool</u>/outgoing.

       <u>pathoverview</u>
           The path to news overview files.  The default value is <u>pathspool</u>/overview.

       <u>pathrun</u>
           The path to files required while the server is running and run-time state information.  This includes
           lock files and the sockets for communicating with <a href="../man8/innd.8.html">innd</a>(8).  This directory and the control sockets in
           it  should  be  protected  from  unprivileged  users  other than the news user.  The default value is
           <u>pathnews</u>/run.

       <u>pathspool</u>
           The root of the news spool hierarchy.  This used mostly to set the defaults for other parameters, and
           to determine the path to the backlog directory for <a href="../man8/innfeed.8.html">innfeed</a>(8).  The default value is <u>pathnews</u>/spool.

       <u>pathtmp</u>
           Where INN puts temporary files.  For security reasons, this is not the same as the  system  temporary
           files  directory  (INN  creates  a  lot  of temporary files with predictable names and does not go to
           particularly great lengths to protect against symlink attacks and the like;  this  is  safe  provided
           that  normal  users can't write into its temporary directory).  The default value is set at configure
           time and defaults to <u>pathnews</u>/tmp.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       Here is a very minimalist example that only sets those parameters that are required.

           mta:                "/usr/lib/sendmail -oi -oem %s"
           ovmethod:           tradindexed
           pathhost:           news.example.com
           pathnews:           /usr/local/news
           hismethod:          hisv6

       For a more comprehensive example, see the sample  <u>inn.conf</u>  distributed  with  INN  and  installed  as  a
       starting point; it contains all of the default values for reference.

       Nearly every program in INN uses this file to one degree or another.  The above are just  the  major  and
       most frequently mentioned ones.
