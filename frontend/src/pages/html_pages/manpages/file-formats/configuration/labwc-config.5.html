</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       labwc - configuration files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Labwc uses openbox-3.6 specification for configuration and theming, but does not support all options. The
       following  files  form  the  basis  of  the  labwc  configuration: rc.xml, menu.xml, autostart, shutdown,
       environment and xinitrc.

       No configuration files are needed to start and run labwc.

       In accordance with XDG Base  Directory  Specification,  configuration  files  are  searched  for  in  the
       following order:

       •   ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/labwc
       •   ${XDG_CONFIG_DIRS:-<a href="file:/etc/xdg">/etc/xdg</a>}/labwc

       When  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is defined, it replaces (rather than augments) $HOME/.config. The same is the case
       for $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS and /etc/xdg.

       The XDG Base Directory Specification does not specify whether or not programs should (a) allow the first-
       identified configuration file to supersede any others, or (b) define rules for  merging  the  information
       from more than one file.

       By  default,  labwc  uses  option  (a),  reading only the first file identified.  With the --merge-config
       option, the search order is reserved, but every configuration file  encountered  is  processed  in  turn.
       Thus,  user-specific  files  will  augment  system-wide configurations, with conflicts favoring the user-
       specific alternative.

       The configuration directory location can be overridden with the -C command line option.

       All configuration and theme files except autostart and shutdown are re-loaded on receiving signal SIGHUP.

       Environment variables may be set within <b>environment</b> files, wherein each line defines shell  variables  in
       the  format  <b>variable=value</b>.  It is recommended to specify keyboard layout settings and cursor size/theme
       here; see environment variable section below for details. Within an XDG  Base  Directory,  a  file  named
       "environment"  will  be parsed first, followed by any file matching the glob "environment.d/*.env". Files
       within the environment.d directory are parsed in alphabetical order. Unless the --merge-config option  is
       specified,  labwc  will  consider a particular XDG Base Directory to have provided an environment file if
       that directory contains either the "environment" file or at least one "environment.d/*.env" file.

       Note: environment files are treated differently by Openbox, which will simply source the file as a  valid
       shell  script  before  running  the  window  manager.  Files are instead parsed directly by labwc so that
       environment variables can be re-loaded on --reconfigure.

       Any environment variables referenced as $VARIABLE or ${VARIABLE} will be substituted and  the  tilde  (~)
       will be expanded as the user's home directory.

       Please  note that as labwc reloads the environment file(s) on reconfigure, recursive/circular assignments
       (for example FOO=$FOO:bar) should not be made.

       The <b>autostart</b> file is executed as a shell script after labwc has read its configuration and set variables
       defined in the environment file. Additionally, the environment variables WAYLAND_DISPLAY and (when  labwc
       is  built  with  Xwayland  support)  DISPLAY will be defined. This is the place for executing clients for
       handling background images, panels and other tasks that should run automatically when labwc launches.

       The <b>shutdown</b> file is executed as a shell  script  when  labwc  is  preparing  to  terminate  itself.  All
       environment  variables,  including WAYLAND_DISPLAY and DISPLAY, will be available to the script. However,
       because the script runs asynchronously with other termination tasks, the shutdown file should not  assume
       that  the  display  will  be  usable.  This  file is useful to perform any custom operations necessary to
       finalize a labwc session.

       The <b>menu.xml</b> file defines the context/root-menus and is described in <a href="../man5/labwc-menu.5.html">labwc-menu</a>(5).

       There is a small &lt;theme&gt; section in rc.xml, for example to set rounded corners, but the remainder of  the
       theme specification and associated files are described in <a href="../man5/labwc-theme.5.html">labwc-theme</a>(5).

       <b>rc.xml</b> is the main configuration file and all its options are described in detail below.

       The  <b>xinitrc</b> file is executed as a shell script whenever labwc launches the Xwayland X11 server. This may
       happen multiple times throughout the session if Xwayland is not configured to persist when no X11 clients
       are connected.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       This section describes <b>rc.xml</b> configuration options.

   <b>SYNTAX</b>
       Configuration must be wrapped in a &lt;labwc_config&gt; root-element like this:

           &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
           &lt;labwc_config&gt;

           &lt;!-- settings --&gt;

           &lt;/labwc_config&gt;

       <b>labwc</b> parses XML in an element/attribute agnostic way. This is a design decision to increase config  file
       flexibility  and  keep  code  simple.  In  practical  terms, this means that `&lt;a&gt;&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;` is usually
       equivalent to `&lt;a b="c" /&gt;`. However, there are some caveats:

           1. In menu.xml, the attributes <b>id</b>, <b>label</b> and <b>execute</b> must be expressed as attributes rather  than  as
           separate child elements.

           2.  Ordering  of  attributes  can  sometimes  be  significant.  For  example,  when setting fonts via
           attributes rather than children,

               <b>&lt;font</b> <b>place="ActiveWindow"</b> <b>name="..."</b> <b>size="..."</b> <b>/&gt;</b>

           will set a font for active window titles, while

               <b>&lt;font</b> <b>name="..."</b> <b>size="..."</b> <b>place="ActiveWindow"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>

           will set a font as if <b>place</b> were unspecified, because <b>name</b> and <b>size</b> will be processed before <b>place</b>.

       In general, it is recommended that attributes not be  used  to  collapse  more  than  one  level  of  the
       configuration hierarchy.

       The following three are therefore treated the same:

           &lt;action&gt;
             &lt;name&gt;Execute&lt;/name&gt;
             &lt;command&gt;foot&lt;/command&gt;
           &lt;/action&gt;

           &lt;action name="Execute"&gt;
             &lt;command&gt;foot&lt;/command&gt;
           &lt;/action&gt;

           &lt;action name="Execute" command="foot" /&gt;

       The  benefit of the final one is brevity whereas the advantage of the first two is that you can add ' and
       " within the `&lt;command&gt;` block, for example:

           &lt;command&gt;sh -c 'grim -g "`slurp`"'&lt;/command&gt;

       Elements at the same level can have the same name whereas attributes cannot.  Therefore,  where  multiple
       objects of the same kind are required (for example <b>&lt;action&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;keybind&gt;</b>) the top-node of the object has
       to be an element.

   <b>BOOLEANS</b>
       Note that in this manual, Boolean values are listed as [yes|no] for simplicity, but it's also possible to
       use [true|false] and/or [on|off]; this is for compatibility with Openbox.

   <b>CORE</b>
           &lt;core&gt;
             &lt;decoration&gt;server&lt;/decoration&gt;
             &lt;gap&gt;0&lt;/gap&gt;
             &lt;adaptiveSync&gt;no&lt;/adaptiveSync&gt;
             &lt;allowTearing&gt;no&lt;/allowTearing&gt;
             &lt;autoEnableOutputs&gt;yes&lt;/autoEnableOutputs&gt;
             &lt;reuseOutputMode&gt;no&lt;/reuseOutputMode&gt;
             &lt;xwaylandPersistence&gt;yes&lt;/xwaylandPersistence&gt;
           &lt;/core&gt;

       <b>&lt;core&gt;&lt;decoration&gt;</b> [server|client]
           Specify server or client side decorations for xdg-shell views. Note that it is not always possible to
           turn off client side decorations. Default is server.

       <b>&lt;core&gt;&lt;gap&gt;</b>
           The  distance  in  pixels  between  views  and  output edges when using movement actions, for example
           MoveToEdge. Default is 0.

       <b>&lt;core&gt;&lt;adaptiveSync&gt;</b> [yes|no|fullscreen]
           Enable adaptive sync. Default is no.

           <b>fullscreen</b> enables adaptive sync whenever a window is in fullscreen mode.

       <b>&lt;core&gt;&lt;allowTearing&gt;</b> [yes|no|fullscreen|fullscreenForced]
           Allow tearing to reduce input lag. Default is no.

           <b>yes</b> allows tearing if requested by the active window.

           <b>fullscreen</b> allows tearing if requested by  the  active  window,  but  only  when  the  window  is  in
           fullscreen mode.

           <b>fullscreenForced</b> enables tearing whenever the active window is in fullscreen mode, whether or not the
           application has requested tearing.

           Use the <b>ToggleTearing</b> action for forcefully enable tearing.

           Note:  Enabling  this  option with atomic mode setting is experimental. If you experience undesirable
           side effects when tearing is allowed, consider setting the environment  variable  WLR_DRM_NO_ATOMIC=1
           when launching labwc.

       <b>&lt;core&gt;&lt;autoEnableOutputs&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           Automatically enable outputs at startup and when new outputs are connected. Default is yes.

           Caution:  Disabling  this option will make the labwc session unusable unless an external tool such as
           `wlr-randr` or `kanshi` is used to manage outputs.

       <b>&lt;core&gt;&lt;reuseOutputMode&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           Try to re-use the existing output mode (resolution / refresh  rate).  This  may  prevent  unnecessary
           screenblank delays when starting labwc (also known as flicker free boot). If the existing output mode
           can not be used with labwc the preferred mode of the monitor is used instead. Default is no.

       <b>&lt;core&gt;&lt;xwaylandPersistence&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           Keep XWayland alive even when no clients are connected, rather than using a "lazy" policy that allows
           the server to launch on demand and die when it is no longer needed.

           When  labwc  is compiled with wlroots 0.18.2 or later, the default is no. When labwc is compiled with
           wlroots &lt; 0.18.2, the default is yes to avoid a wlroots bug that can  result  in  compositor  crashes
           when performing drag-and-drop actions when the XWayland server is shut down.

           Note: changing this setting requires a restart of labwc.

   <b>PLACEMENT</b>
           &lt;placement&gt;
             &lt;policy&gt;cascade&lt;/policy&gt;
             &lt;cascadeOffset x="40" y="30" /&gt;
           &lt;/placement&gt;

       <b>&lt;placement&gt;&lt;policy&gt;</b> [center|automatic|cursor|cascade]
           Specify  a  placement  policy  for  new windows. The "center" policy will always place windows at the
           center of the active output. The "automatic" policy will try to place new windows in such a way  that
           they  will  have  minimal  overlap with existing windows. The "cursor" policy will center new windows
           under the cursor. The "cascade" policy will try to place new windows at  the  center  of  the  active
           output,  but  possibly  shifts its position to bottom-right not to cover existing windows. Default is
           "cascade".

       <b>&lt;placement&gt;&lt;cascadeOffset&gt;&lt;x&gt;</b>
       <b>&lt;placement&gt;&lt;cascadeOffset&gt;&lt;y&gt;</b>
           Specify  the  offset  by  which  a  new  window  can  be  shifted  from  an  existing   window   when
           &lt;placement&gt;&lt;policy&gt;  is  "cascade".  These values must be positive. Default is the height of titlebar
           (the sum of <b>titlebar.height</b> and <b>border.width</b> from theme) plus 5 for both <b>x</b> and <b>y</b>.

   <b>WINDOW</b> <b>SWITCHER</b>
           &lt;windowSwitcher show="yes" preview="yes" outlines="yes" allWorkspaces="no"&gt;
             &lt;fields&gt;
               &lt;field content="type" width="25%"/&gt;
               &lt;field content="trimmed_identifier" width="25%"/&gt;
               &lt;field content="title" width="50%"/&gt;
             &lt;/fields&gt;
           &lt;/windowSwitcher&gt;

       <b>&lt;windowSwitcher</b> <b>show=""</b> <b>preview=""</b> <b>outlines=""</b> <b>allWorkspaces=""&gt;</b>
           <b>show</b> [yes|no] Draw the OnScreenDisplay when switching between windows. Default is yes.

           <b>preview</b> [yes|no] Preview the contents of the selected window when switching between windows.  Default
           is yes.

           <b>outlines</b>  [yes|no] Draw an outline around the selected window when switching between windows. Default
           is yes.

           <b>allWorkspaces</b> [yes|no] Show windows regardless of what workspace they are on.  Default  no  (that  is
           only windows on the current workspace are shown).

       <b>&lt;windowSwitcher&gt;&lt;fields&gt;&lt;field</b> <b>content=""</b> <b>width="%"&gt;</b>
           Define window switcher fields.

           <b>content</b> defines what the field shows and can be any of:

           •   <b>type</b> Show view type ("xdg-shell" or "xwayland")

           •   <b>identifier</b> Show identifier (app_id for native Wayland windows and WM_CLASS for XWayland clients)

           •   <b>trimmed_identifier</b>  Show  trimmed  identifier.  Trimming  removes  the  first two nodes of 'org.'
               strings.

           •   <b>desktop_entry_name</b> Show application name from freedesktop.org desktop entry/file. Falls  back  to
               trimmed identifier (trimmed_identifier).

           •   <b>title</b> Show window title if different to app_id

           •   <b>workspace</b> Show workspace name

           •   <b>state</b> Show window state, M/m/F (max/min/full)

           •   <b>type_short</b> Show view type ("W" or "X")

           •   <b>output</b> Show output id, if more than one output detected

           •   <b>custom</b> A printf style config that can replace all the above fields are:
               •   'B' - shell type, values [xwayland|xdg-shell]
               •   'b' - shell type (short form), values [X|W]
               •   'S' - state of window, values [M|m|F] (3 spaces allocated)
                         (maximized, minimized, fullscreen)
               •   's' - state of window (short form), values [M|m|F] (1 space)
               •   'I' - wm-class/app-id
               •   'i' - wm-class/app-id trimmed, remove "org." if available
               •   'n' - desktop entry/file application name, falls back to
                         wm-class/app-id trimmed
               •   'W' - workspace name
               •   'w' - workspace name (if more than 1 ws configured)
               •   'O' - output name
               •   'o' - output name (show if more than 1 monitor active)
               •   'T' - title of window
               •   't' - title of window (if different than wm-class/app-id)
           Recommend using with a monospace font, to keep alignment.
           •   <b>custom</b> <b>-</b> <b>subset</b> <b>of</b> <b>printf</b> <b>options</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>--</b> <b>man</b> <b>3</b> <b>printf</b>
               •   random text may be inserted
               •   field length, example "%10" use 10 spaces, even if text uses less
               •   left justify text, example "%-"
               •   right justify text, example "%" instead of "%-"
               •   example, %-10 would left justify and make room for 10 characters
           •   Only one custom format allowed now. Future enhancements may allow more than one.

           <b>width</b>  defines the width of the field expressed as a percentage of the overall window switcher width.
           The "%" character is required.

   <b>RESISTANCE</b>
       <b>&lt;resistance&gt;&lt;screenEdgeStrength&gt;</b>
       <b>&lt;resistance&gt;&lt;windowEdgeStrength&gt;</b>
           Resist interactive moves and resizes of a window across screen  edges  or  the  edges  of  any  other
           window, respectively.

           When an edge strength is positive, it indicates a distance, in pixels, that the cursor must move past
           any  relevant  encountered  edge  before an interactive move or resize operation will continue across
           that edge.

           When the strength is negative, any interactive move or resize operation that brings the cursor within
           the absolute value of the specified distance, in  pixels,  from  any  relevant  edge  will  snap  the
           operation to that edge. Thus, as a move or resize approaches an edge, it will "attract" the cursor to
           that  edge  within  the  specified  distance.  As the move or resize continues past the edge, it will
           provide resistance until the cursor has moved beyond the distance.

           A strength of zero disables the corresponding resistance effect.

           The default value for both parameters is 20 pixels.

       <b>&lt;resistance&gt;&lt;unSnapThreshold&gt;</b>
           Sets the movement of cursor in pixel required for a tiled or maximized window to  be  moved  with  an
           interactive move. Default is 20.

       <b>&lt;resistance&gt;&lt;unMaximizeThreshold&gt;</b>
           Sets  the  one-dimensional  movement  of  cursor  in  pixel required for a <b>vertically</b> <b>or</b> <b>horizontally</b>
           maximized window to be moved with an interactive move. Default is 150.

   <b>FOCUS</b>
       <b>&lt;focus&gt;&lt;followMouse&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           Make focus follow mouse, i.e. focus is given to window under mouse cursor. Default is no.

       <b>&lt;focus&gt;&lt;followMouseRequiresMovement&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           Requires cursor movement if followMouse is enabled. It is the same as  the  "underMouse"  setting  in
           Openbox.  If set to "no", labwc will additionally focus the window under the cursor in all situations
           which change the position of a window (e.g. switching workspaces, opening/closing windows).  Focusing
           a different window via A-Tab is still possible, even with this setting set to "no". Default is yes.

       <b>&lt;focus&gt;&lt;raiseOnFocus&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           Raise window to top when focused. Default is no.

   <b>WINDOW</b> <b>SNAPPING</b>
       Windows  may  be  "snapped" to an edge or user-defined region of an output when activated with SnapToEdge
       actions or, optionally, by dragging windows to the edges of an output. Edge snapping causes a  window  to
       occupy half of its output, extending outward from the snapped edge.

       <b>&lt;snapping&gt;&lt;range&gt;</b>
           If an interactive move ends with the cursor a maximum distance <b>range</b>, (in pixels) from the edge of an
           output,  the  move will trigger a SnapToEdge action for that edge. A <b>range</b> of 0 disables snapping via
           interactive moves. Default is 1.

       <b>&lt;snapping&gt;&lt;overlay&gt;&lt;enabled&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           Show an overlay when snapping to a window to an edge. Default is yes.

       <b>&lt;snapping&gt;&lt;overlay&gt;&lt;delay&gt;&lt;inner&gt;</b>
       <b>&lt;snapping&gt;&lt;overlay&gt;&lt;delay&gt;&lt;outer&gt;</b>
           Sets the delay to show an overlay when snapping a window to each type of edge. Defaults are  500  ms.
           <b>inner</b> edges are edges with an adjacent output and <b>outer</b> edges are edges without an adjacent output.

       <b>&lt;snapping&gt;&lt;topMaximize&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           If  <b>yes</b>,  an  interactive  move  that snaps a window to the top edge will maximize the window. If <b>no</b>,
           snapping will behave as it does with other edges, causing the window to occupy the  top  half  of  an
           output. Default is yes.

       <b>&lt;snapping&gt;&lt;notifyClient&gt;</b> [always|region|edge|never]
           Snapping  windows can trigger corresponding tiling events for native Wayland clients. Clients may use
           these events to alter their rendering based on knowledge that some edges of the view are confined  to
           edges  of  a snapping region or output. For example, rounded corners may become square when tiled, or
           media players may letter-box or pillar-box video rather than imposing rigid aspect ratios on  windows
           that will violate the constraints of window snapping.

           •   When  <b>always</b>  is specified, any window that is snapped to either an output edge or a user-defined
               region will receive a tiling event.

           •   When <b>region</b> is specified, only windows snapped to a user-defined region will receive an event.

           •   When <b>edge</b> is specified, only windows snapped to an output edge will receive an event.

           •   When <b>never</b> is specified, tiling events will never be triggered.

           The default is "always".

   <b>REGIONS</b>
       <b>&lt;regions&gt;&lt;region</b> <b>name="snap-1"</b> <b>x="10%"</b> <b>y="10%"</b> <b>width="80%"</b> <b>height="80%"&gt;</b>
           Define snap regions. The regions are calculated based on the usable area of each output. Usable  area
           in this context means space not exclusively used by layershell clients like panels. The "%" character
           is  required.  Windows  can either be snapped to regions by keeping a keyboard modifier pressed while
           moving a window (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Logo) or by using the SnapToRegion action. By default there are no
           regions defined.

   <b>WORKSPACES</b>
       <b>&lt;desktops</b> <b>number=""&gt;&lt;names&gt;&lt;name&gt;</b>
           Define workspaces. A workspace covers all outputs. Workspaces can be switched to with GoToDesktop and
           windows can be moved with SendToDesktop.  See  <a href="../man5/labwc-actions.5.html">labwc-actions</a>(5)  for  more  information  about  their
           arguments.

           The  number attribute defines the minimum number of workspaces. Default is 1. The number attribute is
           optional. If the number attribute is specified, names.name is not required.

       <b>&lt;desktops&gt;&lt;popupTime&gt;</b>
           Define the timeout after which to hide the workspace OSD. A setting of 0 disables the OSD. Default is
           1000 ms.

       <b>&lt;desktops&gt;&lt;prefix&gt;</b>
           Set the prefix to use when using "number" above. Default is "Workspace"

   <b>THEME</b>
       <b>&lt;theme&gt;&lt;name&gt;</b>
           The name of the Openbox theme to use. It is not set by default.

       <b>&lt;theme&gt;&lt;icon&gt;</b>
           The name of the icon theme to use. Inherits <b>&lt;theme&gt;&lt;name&gt;</b> if not set.

       <b>&lt;theme&gt;&lt;fallbackAppIcon&gt;</b>
           The name of the icon to use as a fallback  when  the  application  icon  (e.g.  window  icon  in  the
           titlebar)  is not available. The name follows the ones specified in "Icon=" entries in desktop files.
           Default is 'labwc'.

       <b>&lt;theme&gt;&lt;titlebar&gt;&lt;layout&gt;</b>
           Selection and order of buttons in a window's titlebar. The following identifiers can  be  used,  each
           only once:
           •   'icon': window icon
           •   'menu': window menu
           •   'iconify': iconify
           •   'max': maximize toggle
           •   'close': close
           •   'shade': shade toggle
           •   'desk': all-desktops toggle

           A  colon  deliminator  is  used to separate buttons on the left and right, whereas commas are used to
           separate items within a section. It is mandatory to use one colon.

           Default: icon:iconify,max,close

       <b>&lt;theme&gt;&lt;titlebar&gt;&lt;showTitle&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           Show the window title in the titlebar. Default is yes.

       <b>&lt;theme&gt;&lt;cornerRadius&gt;</b>
           The radius of server side decoration top corners. Default is 8.

       <b>&lt;theme&gt;&lt;keepBorder&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           Even when disabling server side decorations via ToggleDecorations, keep a small  border  (and  resize
           area) around the window. Default is yes.

       <b>&lt;theme&gt;&lt;dropShadows&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           Should drop-shadows be rendered behind windows. Default is no.

       <b>&lt;theme&gt;&lt;font</b> <b>place=""&gt;</b>
           The font to use for a specific element of a window, menu or OSD. Places can be any of:
           •   ActiveWindow - titlebar of active window
           •   InactiveWindow - titlebar of all windows that aren't focused by the cursor
           •   MenuHeader - menu title
           •   MenuItem - menu item (currently only root menu)
           •   OnScreenDisplay - items in the on screen display
       If no place attribute is provided, the setting will be applied to all
           places.

       <b>&lt;theme&gt;&lt;font</b> <b>place=""&gt;&lt;name&gt;</b>
           Describes font name. Default is sans.

       <b>&lt;theme&gt;&lt;font</b> <b>place=""&gt;&lt;size&gt;</b>
           Font size in pixels. Default is 10.

       <b>&lt;theme&gt;&lt;font</b> <b>place=""&gt;&lt;slant&gt;</b>
           Font slant (normal, oblique or italic). Default is normal.

       <b>&lt;theme&gt;&lt;font</b> <b>place=""&gt;&lt;weight&gt;</b>
           Font weight (normal or bold). Default is normal.

   <b>MARGIN</b>
       <b>&lt;margin</b> <b>top=""</b> <b>bottom=""</b> <b>left=""</b> <b>right=""</b> <b>output=""</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Specify   the   number   of   pixels   to   reserve   at   the   edges  of  an  output  (typically  a
           display/screen/monitor). New, maximized and tiled windows will not be placed in these areas. The use-
           case for <b>&lt;margin&gt;</b> is as a workaround for clients such as panels that do NOT  support  the  wlr-layer-
           shell protocol.

           <b>output</b>  is  optional;  if this attribute is not provided (rather than leaving it an empty string) the
           margin will be applied to all outputs.

   <b>RESIZE</b>
       <b>&lt;resize&gt;&lt;popupShow&gt;</b> [Never|Always|Nonpixel]
           Show a small indicator on top of the window when resizing or moving. When the application sets  size-
           hints  (usually X11 terminal emulators), the indicator will show the dimensions divided by size hints
           instead. In the case of terminal emulators this usually means columns x rows.

           The different values mean:
           •   <b>Never</b> Do not render the indicator
           •   <b>Always</b> Render the indicator while moving and resizing windows
           •   <b>Nonpixel</b> Only render the indicator during resize for windows using size-hints

           Default is Never.

       <b>&lt;resize&gt;&lt;drawContents&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           Let the application redraw its contents while resizing. If disabled, an outlined rectangle  is  shown
           to indicate the geometry of resized window. Default is yes.

       <b>&lt;resize&gt;&lt;cornerRange&gt;</b>
           The  size  of corner regions to which the 'TLCorner', 'TRCorner', 'BLCorner' and 'RLCorner' mousebind
           contexts apply, as well as the size of the border region for which mouse  resizing  will  apply  both
           horizontally and vertically rather than one or the other. Default is half the titlebar height.

       <b>&lt;resize&gt;&lt;minimumArea&gt;</b>
           Treat borders of server-side decorations as if they were at least the indicated thickness, regardless
           of  their  visual  size.  Borders  visually  narrower  than  the  minimum effective thickness will be
           augmented with invisible zones just beyond the window that serve as click targets for mouse  actions.
           Default is 8.

   <b>KEYBOARD</b>
       <b>&lt;keyboard&gt;&lt;numlock&gt;</b> [on|off]
           When recognizing a new keyboard enable or disable Num Lock. Default is unset.

       <b>&lt;keyboard</b> <b>layoutScope=""&gt;</b> [global|window]
           Stores  the  keyboard layout either globally or per window and restores it when switching back to the
           window. Default is global.

       <b>&lt;keyboard&gt;&lt;keybind</b> <b>key=""</b> <b>layoutDependent=""</b> <b>onRelease=""</b> <b>allowWhenLocked=""&gt;</b>
           Define a <b>key</b> binding in the format <b>modifier-key</b>, where supported modifiers are:
           •   S (shift)
           •   C (control)
           •   A or Mod1 (alt)
           •   H or Mod3 (hyper)
           •   W or Mod4 (super / logo)
           •   M or Mod5 (meta)

           Multiple modifiers can be combined like <b>A-S-f</b> for Alt-Shift-f. The key  itself  can  be  any  unicode
           character or a keyname like <b>Return</b>.

           Unlike  Openbox,  multiple  space-separated  key  combinations  and key-chains are not supported. The
           application "wev" (wayland event viewer) is packaged in a lot of distributions and  can  be  used  to
           view all available keynames.

           When matching against keybinds, input keys are processed in the following order of precedence:
           •   Keycodes of physical keys (except if keybind is layoutDependent)
           •   Translated  keysyms  taking  into account modifiers (so if Shift+1 were pressed on a us keyboard,
               the keysym would be '!')
           •   Raw keysyms ignoring modifiers such as shift (so in the above example the keysym  would  just  be
               '1')

           The reasons for this approach are:
           •   To  make keybinds keyboard-layout agnostic (by checking keycodes before keysyms). This means that
               in a multi-layout situation, keybinds work regardless of which layout is active at  the  time  of
               the key-press.
           •   To  support  keybinds  relating  to  keysyms  that are only available in a particular layout, for
               example å, ä and ö.
           •   To support keybinds that are only valid with a modifier, for example the numpad keys with NumLock
               enabled: KP_x. These would only be matched by the translated keysyms.
           •   To support keybinds such as `S-1` (by checking raw keysyms).

           <b>layoutDependent</b> [yes|no] Make this specific keybind depend on the currently active  keyboard  layout.
           If  enabled,  a  keybind  using a key which does not exist in the currently active layout will not be
           executed. The physical key to trigger a keybind may also change along with the active layout. If  set
           to "no" (or is absent) the keybind will be layout agnostic. Default is no.

           <b>allowWhenLocked</b> [yes|no] Make this keybind work even if the screen is locked. Default is no.

           <b>onRelease</b>  [yes|no]  When  yes, fires the keybind action when the key or key combination is released,
           rather than first pressed. This is useful to bind actions to only modifier  keys,  where  the  action
           should fire when the modifier is used without another key. Default is no.

           The  example  below will trigger the launch of rofi when the super key is pressed &amp; released, without
           interference from other multi-key combinations that include the super key:

               &lt;keybind key="Super_L" onRelease="yes"&gt;
                 &lt;action name="Execute" command="rofi -show drun"/&gt;
               &lt;/keybind&gt;

       <b>&lt;keyboard&gt;&lt;keybind</b> <b>key=""&gt;&lt;action</b> <b>name=""&gt;</b>
           Keybind action. See <a href="../man5/labwc-actions.5.html">labwc-actions</a>(5).

       <b>&lt;keyboard&gt;&lt;default</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Load the default keybinds listed below. This is an addition to the openbox specification and provides
           a way to keep config files simpler whilst allowing your specific keybinds. Note that if no rc.xml  is
           found,  or  if no &lt;keyboard&gt;&lt;keybind&gt; entries exist, the same default keybinds will be loaded even if
           the &lt;default /&gt; element is not provided.

             A-Tab - next window
             A-S-Tab - previous window
             W-Return - alacritty
             A-F3 - run bemenu
             A-F4 - close window
             W-a - toggle maximize
             A-&lt;arrow&gt; - move window to edge
             W-&lt;arrow&gt; - resize window to fill half the output
             A-Space - show window menu

           Audio and MonBrightness keys are also bound to amixer and brightnessctl, respectively.

       <b>&lt;keyboard&gt;&lt;repeatRate&gt;</b>
           Set the rate at which keypresses are repeated per second. Default is 25.

       <b>&lt;keyboard&gt;&lt;repeatDelay&gt;</b>
           Set the delay before keypresses are repeated in milliseconds. Default is 600.

   <b>MOUSE</b>
       <b>&lt;mouse&gt;&lt;doubleClickTime&gt;</b>
           Set double click time in milliseconds. Default is 500.

       <b>&lt;mouse&gt;&lt;context</b> <b>name=""&gt;&lt;mousebind</b> <b>button=""</b> <b>direction=""</b> <b>action=""&gt;&lt;action&gt;</b>
           Multiple <b>&lt;mousebind&gt;</b> can exist within one <b>&lt;context&gt;</b>; and  multiple  <b>&lt;action&gt;</b>  can  exist  within  one
           <b>&lt;mousebind&gt;</b>.

           Define a mouse binding. Supported context-names include:
           •   TitleBar:  The decoration on top of the window, where the window buttons and the window title are
               shown.
           •   Title: The area of the titlebar (including blank space) between the  window  buttons,  where  the
               window title is displayed.
           •   Icon: A window icon that, by default, displays a window menu.
           •   WindowMenu: A button that, by default, displays a window menu.
           •   Iconify: A button that, by default, iconifies a window.
           •   Maximize: A button that, by default, toggles maximization of a window.
           •   Shade: A button that, by default, toggles window shading.

           •   BLCorner: The bottom-left corner of the window's border.
           •   BRCorner: The bottom-right edge of the window's border.
           •   Client:  The  client  area  of  a window, inside its decorations. Events bound to Client are also
               passed to applications.
           •   Frame: Any part of a window, but events bound to Frame are not passed through to the application.
           •   Desktop: The desktop background, where no windows are present.
           •   Root: A synonym for Desktop (for compatibility).
           •   All: Anywhere on the screen.

           Supported mouse <b>buttons</b> are:

           •   Drag: Pressing the button within the context, then moving the cursor.
           •   Scroll: Scrolling in specified <b>direction</b> in the context.

       <b>&lt;mouse&gt;&lt;default</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Load  default mousebinds. This is an addition to the openbox specification and provides a way to keep
           config files simpler whilst allowing user specific binds.  Note that if no rc.xml is found, or if  no
           &lt;mouse&gt;&lt;mousebind&gt;  entries exist, the same default mousebinds will be loaded even if the &lt;default /&gt;
           element is not provided.

   <b>TOUCH</b>
           &lt;touch deviceName="" mapToOutput="" mouseEmulation="no"/&gt;

       <b>&lt;touch</b> <b>deviceName=""</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           A touch configuration can be bound to a specific device. If device name  is  left  empty,  the  touch
           configuration  applies to all touch devices or functions as a fallback. Multiple touch configurations
           can exist. See the libinput device section for obtaining the device names.

       <b>&lt;touch</b> <b>mapToOutput=""</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Direct cursor movement to a specified output. If the compositor is running in nested mode, this  does
           not take effect.

       <b>&lt;touch</b> <b>mouseEmulation=""</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           If  mouseEmulation  is  enabled,  all  touch up/down/motion events are translated to mouse button and
           motion events.

   <b>TABLET</b>
           &lt;tablet mapToOutput="" rotate="0" mouseEmulation="no"&gt;
             &lt;area top="0.0" left="0.0" width="0.0" height="0.0" /&gt;
             &lt;map button="Tip" to="Left" /&gt;
             &lt;map button="Stylus" to="Right" /&gt;
             &lt;map button="Stylus2" to="Middle" /&gt;
           &lt;/tablet&gt;

       <b>&lt;tablet</b> <b>mapToOutput=""</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           The tablet cursor movement can be restricted to a single output. If the output name is left empty  or
           the output does not exists, the tablet will span all outputs.

           The  tablet  cursor  automatically  applies  the orientation/rotation of a mapped output for absolute
           motion.

       <b>&lt;tablet</b> <b>rotate=""</b> <b>/&gt;</b> [0|90|180|270]
           The tablet orientation can be changed in 90 degree steps. Default is no rotation (0).  Rotation  will
           be applied before applying tablet area transformation.

           See also <b>calibrationMatrix</b> in libinput section below for advanced transformation.

       <b>&lt;tablet&gt;&lt;area</b> <b>top="mm"</b> <b>left="mm"</b> <b>width="mm"</b> <b>height="mm"</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           By  default  the  complete  tablet area is mapped to the full output. The <b>area</b> element can be used to
           truncate the active area of the tablet surface. By truncating the active area, it is e.g. possible to
           maintain the same aspect ratio between output and tablet.

           The active tablet  area  can  be  specified  by  setting  the  <b>top</b>/<b>left</b>  coordinate  (in  mm)  and/or
           <b>width</b>/<b>height</b>  (in  mm).  If width or height are omitted or default (0.0), width/height will be set to
           the remaining width/height seen from top/left.

           Aspect ratio example: The dimensions of the tablet are 215mm x 115mm and the output has a  resolution
           of 3440x1440. When setting height to "90", because 215 x 1440 / 3440 = 90, the responsive tablet area
           height will be truncated to match the 21:9 aspect ratio of the output. By additionally setting top to
           "12.5", the active area is centered vertically on the tablet surface.

       <b>&lt;tablet</b> <b>mouseEmulation=""</b> <b>/&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           The  tablet  can be forced to always use mouse emulation. This prevents tablet specific restrictions,
           e.g. no support for drag-and-drop, but  also  omits  tablet  specific  features  like  reporting  pen
           pressure.

           Use the <b>ToggleTabletMouseEmulation</b> action for toggling between mouse emulation on and off.

       <b>&lt;tablet&gt;&lt;map</b> <b>button=""</b> <b>to=""</b> <b>/&gt;</b>
           Pen  and pad buttons behave like regular mouse buttons.With mouse emulation set to "no", which is the
           default, and if not     specified otherwise, the first pen  button  is  mapped  to  the  right  mouse
           button, the second pen button to the middle mouse button and a third pen button is mapped to the side
           mouse button.

           Supported map <b>buttons</b> are:
           •   Stylus
           •   Stylus2
           •   Stylus3

           The stylus buttons can be mapped <b>to</b>:
           •   Right
           •   Middle

           The tip cannot be remapped.

           When  using  mouse  emulation, all pen buttons emulate regular mouse buttons. The tip, stylus and pad
           buttons can be mapped to all available mouse     buttons. If not  specified  otherwise,  the  tip  is
           mapped  to  left mouse click, the first pen button (Stylus) is mapped to right mouse button click and
           the second pen button (Stylus2) emulates a middle mouse  button click.

           Supported map <b>buttons</b> for mouse emulation are:
           •   Tip
           •   Stylus
           •   Stylus2
           •   Stylus3
           •   Pad
           •   Pad2..Pad9

           See mouse section above for all supported mouse buttons.

   <b>TABLET</b> <b>TOOL</b>
           &lt;tabletTool motion="absolute" relativeMotionSensitivity="1" /&gt;

       <b>&lt;tabletTool</b> <b>motion=""&gt;</b> [absolute|relative]
           All tablet tools, except of type mouse and lens, use "absolute" positioning by  default.  The  <b>motion</b>
           attribute  allows  to  set tools to relative motion instead. Positioning for a tablet mouse or tablet
           lens cannot be changed, those tools always use relative mode.

       <b>&lt;tabletTool</b> <b>relativeMotionSensitivity=""&gt;</b>
           When using relative motion, <b>relativeMotionSensitivity</b> controls the speed of the cursor. Using a value
           lower than 1.0 decreases the speed, using a value greater than 1.0 increases the speed of the cursor.
           The default is "1.0".

           &lt;/libinput&gt;

       <b>&lt;libinput&gt;&lt;device&gt;</b>
           Define a new libinput configuration category (profile).

           <b>CATEGORY</b> Defines a category of devices (by type or name) to  apply  the  settings  that  follow.  The
           category attribute as optional. If no category attribute is provided, a 'default' device profile will
           created  that  will  act  as the fallback for all libinput devices. Category can be set to any of the
           following types:
           •   <b>touch</b> - Devices which have a defined width/height, but  do  not  support  multitouch  (i.e.  they
               cannot  track  multiple  locations  where the screen has been touched). Drawing tablets typically
               fall into this type.
           •   <b>touchpad</b> - Same as 'touch' but support multitouch. This typically includes laptop track pads with
               two-finger scroll and swipe gestures.
           •   <b>non-touch</b> - Anything not described above, for example traditional mouse pointers.
           •   <b>default</b> - Defines a device-category applicable to all devices not matched by anything else.  This
               can be useful for a fallback, or if you want the same settings to be applied to all devices.

           If the provided category value is different from all of the above key words, it will be used to match
           the device name directly.

           A list of device names can be obtained by running <b>libinput</b> <b>list-devices</b> (you may need to be root or a
           part of the input group to perform this).

       <b>&lt;libinput&gt;&lt;device&gt;&lt;naturalScroll&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           Use natural scrolling for this category if available.

       <b>&lt;libinput&gt;&lt;device&gt;&lt;leftHanded&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           Use your devices left-handed mode if available.

       <b>&lt;libinput&gt;&lt;device&gt;&lt;pointerSpeed&gt;</b> [-1.0 to 1.0]
           Set  the  pointer speed for this category. The speed is a number between -1.0 and 1.0, with 0.0 being
           the default in most cases, and 1.0 being the fastest.

       <b>&lt;libinput&gt;&lt;device&gt;&lt;accelProfile&gt;</b> [flat|adaptive]
           Set the pointer's acceleration profile for this category. Flat applies no acceleration (the  pointers
           velocity is constant), while adaptive changes the pointers speed based the actual speed of your mouse
           or finger on your touchpad.

       <b>&lt;libinput&gt;&lt;device&gt;&lt;tap&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           Enable or disable tap-to-click for this category. This is enabled by default for all categories.

       <b>&lt;libinput&gt;&lt;device&gt;&lt;tapButtonMap&gt;</b> [lrm|lmr]
           Set  the  buttons  mapped  to one-, two-, and three-finger taps to the left button, right button, and
           middle button, respectively (lrm) (the default), or to left button, middle button, and  right  button
           (lmr).

       <b>&lt;libinput&gt;&lt;device&gt;&lt;tapAndDrag&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           Enable  or  disable tap-and-drag for this category. Tap-and-drag processes a tap immediately followed
           by a finger down as the start of a drag.

       <b>&lt;libinput&gt;&lt;device&gt;&lt;dragLock&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           Enable or disable drag lock for this category. Drag lock ignores a  momentary  release  of  a  finger
           during tap-and-dragging.

       <b>&lt;libinput&gt;&lt;device&gt;&lt;middleEmulation&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           Enable  or  disable  middle  button  emulation  for  this  category.  Middle  emulation  processes  a
           simultaneous left and right click as a press of the middle mouse button (scroll wheel).

       <b>&lt;libinput&gt;&lt;device&gt;&lt;disableWhileTyping&gt;</b> [yes|no]
           Enable or disable disable while typing for this category. DWT  ignores  any  motion  events  while  a
           keyboard is typing, and for a short while after as well.

       <b>&lt;libinput&gt;&lt;device&gt;&lt;clickMethod&gt;</b> [none|buttonAreas|clickfinger]
           Configure the method by which physical clicks on a touchpad are mapped to mouse-button events.

           The click methods available are:
           •   <b>buttonAreas</b>  - The bottom of the touchpad is divided into distinct regions corresponding to left,
               middle and right buttons; clicking within  the  region  will  trigger  the  corresponding  event.
               Clicking the main area further up produces a left button event.
           •   <b>clickfinger</b> - Clicking with one, two or three finger(s) will produce left, right or middle button
               event without regard to the location of a click.
           •   <b>none</b> - Physical clicks will not produce button events.

           The default method depends on the touchpad hardware.

       <b>&lt;libinput&gt;&lt;device&gt;&lt;sendEventsMode&gt;</b> [yes|no|disabledOnExternalMouse]
           Optionally enable or disable sending any device events.

           The options available are:
           •   <b>yes</b> - Events are sent as usual
           •   <b>no</b> - No events are sent from this device
           •   <b>disabledOnExternalMouse</b>  -  This  device  does  not  send  events  if  an external mouse has been
               detected.

           It is possible to prevent events from a device in the config and then do a Reconfigure to temporarily
           enable / disable specific devices.

           By default, this setting is not configured.

       <b>&lt;libinput&gt;&lt;device&gt;&lt;calibrationMatrix&gt;</b> [six float values split by space]
           Apply the 3x3 transformation matrix to absolute device coordinates. This  matrix  has  no  effect  on
           relative events.

           Given a 6-element array [a b c d e f], the matrix is applied as
               [ a  b  c ]   [ x ]
               [ d  e  f ] * [ y ]
               [ 0  0  1 ]   [ 1 ]

           The most common matrices are:
               90 deg cw:      180 deg cw:     270 deg cw:     reflect along y axis:
               [ 0 -1 1]       [ -1  0 1]      [  0 1 0 ]      [ -1 0 1 ]
               [ 1  0 0]       [  0 -1 1]      [ -1 0 1 ]      [  1 0 0 ]
               [ 0  0 1]       [  0  0 1]      [  0 0 1 ]      [  0 0 1 ]

           visit https://wayland.freedesktop.org/libinput/doc/latest/absolute-axes.html#calibration-of-absolute-
           devices for more information.

       <b>&lt;libinput&gt;&lt;scrollFactor&gt;</b>
           Set scroll factor. Default is 1.0.

   <b>WINDOW</b> <b>RULES</b>
       Two types of window rules are supported, actions and properties. They are defined as shown below.

           &lt;windowRules&gt;

             &lt;!-- Action --&gt;
             &lt;windowRule identifier="" title="" type=""&gt;
               &lt;action name=""/&gt;
             &lt;/windowRule&gt;

             &lt;!-- Property --&gt;
             &lt;windowRule identifier="" serverDecoration="" /&gt;

           &lt;/windowRules&gt;

       <b>Criteria</b>

       <b>&lt;windowRules&gt;&lt;windowRule</b> <b>identifier=""</b> <b>title=""</b> <b>sandboxEngine=""</b> <b>sandboxAppId=""</b> <b>type=""</b> <b>matchOnce=""&gt;</b>
           Define  a window rule for any window which matches the criteria defined by the attributes <b>identifier</b>,
           <b>title</b>, or <b>type</b>. If more than one is defined, AND logic is used, so all have  to  match.  Matching  is
           case-insensitive  and  is  performed  using shell wildcard patterns (see <a href="../man7/glob.7.html">glob</a>(7)) so '*' (not between
           brackets) matches any string and '?' matches any single character.

           <b>identifier</b> relates to app_id for native Wayland windows and WM_CLASS for XWayland clients.

           <b>title</b> is the title of the window.

           <b>sandboxEngine</b> is a sandbox engine name from the security context.

           <b>sandboxAppId</b> is a sandbox-specific identifier for an application from the security context.

           <b>type</b>                                  [desktop|dock|toolbar|menu|utility|splash|dialog|dropdown_menu|
           popup_menu|tooltip|notification|combo|dnd|normal] relates to NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE for XWayland clients.
           Native  wayland  clients  have  type  "dialog"  when  they have a parent or a fixed size, or "normal"
           otherwise.

           <b>matchOnce</b> can be true|false. If true, the rule will only apply to the first instance  of  the  window
           with the specified identifier or title.

       <b>Properties</b>

       Property values can be <b>yes</b>, <b>no</b> or <b>default</b>.

       If  a  window  matches criteria for multiple rules which set the same property, later config entries have
       higher priority. <b>default</b> can be useful in this situation.

       <b>&lt;windowRules&gt;&lt;windowRule</b> <b>serverDecoration=""&gt;</b> [yes|no|default]
           <b>serverDecoration</b> over-rules any other setting for server-side window decoration on first map.

       <b>&lt;windowRules&gt;&lt;windowRule</b> <b>skipTaskbar=""&gt;</b> [yes|no|default]
           <b>skipTaskbar</b> removes window foreign-toplevel protocol handle so that it does  not  appear  in  clients
           such as panels and taskbars using that protocol.

       <b>&lt;windowRules&gt;&lt;windowRule</b> <b>skipWindowSwitcher=""&gt;</b> [yes|no|default]
           <b>skipWindowSwitcher</b> removes window from the Window Switcher (alt-tab on-screen-display).

       <b>&lt;windowRules&gt;&lt;windowRule</b> <b>ignoreFocusRequest=""&gt;</b> [yes|no|default]
           <b>ignoreFocusRequest</b> prevents window to activate itself.

       <b>&lt;windowRules&gt;&lt;windowRule</b> <b>ignoreConfigureRequest=""&gt;</b> [yes|no|default]
           <b>ignoreConfigureRequest</b> prevents a X11 window to position and size itself.

       <b>&lt;windowRules&gt;&lt;windowRule</b> <b>fixedPosition=""&gt;</b> [yes|no|default]
           <b>fixedPosition</b> disallows interactive move/resize and prevents re-positioning in response to changes in
           reserved output space, which can be caused by <b>&lt;margin&gt;</b> settings or exclusive layer-shell clients such
           as panels.

   <b>MENU</b>
           &lt;menu&gt;
             &lt;ignoreButtonReleasePeriod&gt;250&lt;/ignoreButtonReleasePeriod&gt;
             &lt;showIcons&gt;yes&lt;/showIcons&gt;
           &lt;/menu&gt;

       <b>&lt;menu&gt;&lt;ignoreButtonReleasePeriod&gt;</b>
           How long (in milliseconds) the initial button release event is ignored for. The reason for this logic
           and behaviour is to avoid a fast press-move-release sequence intended to just open the menu resulting
           in  the  closure of the menu or the selection of (typically the first) menu item. This behaviour only
           affects the first button-release. It is not anticipated that most users will want to change this, but
           the  config  option  has  been  exposed  for  unusual  use-cases.  It  is  equivalent  to   Openbox's
           `&lt;hideDelay&gt;`. Default is 250 ms.

       <b>&lt;menu&gt;&lt;showIcons&gt;</b>
           Show  menu  icons  based  on  the  `icon`  attribute of menu label elements. Default is yes. Requires
           libsfdo. If labwc is built without it, no icons will be shown.

   <b>MAGNIFIER</b>
           &lt;magnifier&gt;
             &lt;width&gt;400&lt;/width&gt;
             &lt;height&gt;400&lt;/height&gt;
             &lt;initScale&gt;2&lt;/initScale&gt;
             &lt;increment&gt;0.2&lt;/increment&gt;
             &lt;useFilter&gt;true&lt;/useFilter&gt;
           &lt;/magnifier&gt;

       <b>&lt;magnifier&gt;&lt;width&gt;</b>
           Width of magnifier window in pixels. Default is 400. Set to -1 to use fullscreen magnifier.

       <b>&lt;magnifier&gt;&lt;height&gt;</b>
           Height of magnifier window in pixels. Default is 400. Set to -1 to use fullscreen magnifier.

       <b>&lt;magnifier&gt;&lt;initScale&gt;</b>
           Initial number of times by which magnified image is scaled. Value is the  default  at  boot;  can  be
           modified  at  run-time  in  a  keyboard or mouse binding by calling 'ZoomIn' or 'ZoomOut'. Default is
           x2.0.

       <b>&lt;magnifier&gt;&lt;increment&gt;</b>
           Step by which magnification changes on each call to 'ZoomIn' or 'ZoomOut'. Default is 0.2.

       <b>&lt;magnifier&gt;&lt;useFilter&gt;</b> [yes|no|default]
           Whether to apply a bilinear filter to the magnified image, or just to use nearest-neighbour.  Default
           is true - bilinear filtered.

   <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>
       <b>XCURSOR_THEME</b>  and <b>XCURSOR_SIZE</b> are supported to set cursor theme and size respectively. The default size
       is 24. System cursor themes can typically be found with a command such as:

           find <a href="file:/usr/share/icons/">/usr/share/icons/</a> -type d -name "cursors"

       The following  keyboard-configuration  variables  are  supported:  <b>XKB_DEFAULT_RULES</b>,  <b>XKB_DEFAULT_MODEL</b>,
       <b>XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT</b>, <b>XKB_DEFAULT_VARIANT</b> and <b>XKB_DEFAULT_OPTIONS</b>.

       See <a href="../man7/xkeyboard-config.7.html">xkeyboard-config</a>(7) for details.
