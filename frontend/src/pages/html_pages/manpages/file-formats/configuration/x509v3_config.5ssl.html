</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       x509v3_config - X509 V3 certificate extension configuration format

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Several OpenSSL commands can add extensions to a certificate or certificate request based on the contents
       of a configuration file and CLI options such as <b>-addext</b>.  The syntax of configuration files is described
       in <b><a href="../man5/config.5.html">config</a></b>(5).  The commands typically have an option to specify the name of the configuration file, and a
       section within that file; see the documentation of the individual command for details.

       This page uses <b>extensions</b> as the name of the section, when needed in examples.

       Each entry in the extension section takes the form:

        name = [critical, ]value(s)

       If <b>critical</b> is present then the extension will be marked as critical.

       If multiple entries are processed for the same extension name, later entries override earlier ones with
       the same name.

       The format of <b>values</b> depends on the value of <b>name</b>, many have a type-value pairing where the type and
       value are separated by a colon.  There are four main types of extension:

        string
        multi-valued
        raw
        arbitrary

       Each is described in the following paragraphs.

       String extensions simply have a string which contains either the value itself or how it is obtained.

       Multi-valued extensions have a short form and a long form. The short form is a comma-separated list of
       names and values:

        basicConstraints = critical, CA:true, pathlen:1

       The long form allows the values to be placed in a separate section:

        [extensions]
        basicConstraints = critical, @basic_constraints

        [basic_constraints]
        CA = true
        pathlen = 1

       Both forms are equivalent.

       If an extension is multi-value and a field value must contain a comma the long form must be used
       otherwise the comma would be misinterpreted as a field separator. For example:

        subjectAltName = URI:ldap://somehost.com/CN=foo,OU=bar

       will produce an error but the equivalent form:

        [extensions]
        subjectAltName = @subject_alt_section

        [subject_alt_section]
        subjectAltName = URI:ldap://somehost.com/CN=foo,OU=bar

       is valid.

       OpenSSL does not support multiple occurrences of the same field within a section. In this example:

        [extensions]
        subjectAltName = @alt_section

        [alt_section]
        email = <a href="mailto:steve@example.com">steve@example.com</a>
        email = <a href="mailto:steve@example.org">steve@example.org</a>

       will only recognize the last value.  To specify multiple values append a numeric identifier, as shown
       here:

        [extensions]
        subjectAltName = @alt_section

        [alt_section]
        email.1 = <a href="mailto:steve@example.com">steve@example.com</a>
        email.2 = <a href="mailto:steve@example.org">steve@example.org</a>

       The syntax of raw extensions is defined by the source code that parses the extension but should be
       documented.  See "Certificate Policies" for an example of a raw extension.

       If an extension type is unsupported, then the <u>arbitrary</u> extension syntax must be used, see the "ARBITRARY
       EXTENSIONS" section for more details.

</pre><h4><b>STANDARD</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following sections describe the syntax of each supported extension.  They do not define the semantics
       of the extension.

   <b>Basic</b> <b>Constraints</b>
       This is a multi-valued extension which indicates whether a certificate is a CA certificate. The first
       value is <b>CA</b> followed by <b>TRUE</b> or <b>FALSE</b>. If <b>CA</b> is <b>TRUE</b> then an optional <b>pathlen</b> name followed by a
       nonnegative value can be included.

       For example:

        basicConstraints = CA:TRUE

        basicConstraints = CA:FALSE

        basicConstraints = critical, CA:TRUE, pathlen:1

       A CA certificate <u>must</u> include the <b>basicConstraints</b> name with the <b>CA</b> parameter set to <b>TRUE</b>. An end-user
       certificate must either have <b>CA:FALSE</b> or omit the extension entirely.  The <b>pathlen</b> parameter specifies
       the maximum number of CAs that can appear below this one in a chain. A <b>pathlen</b> of zero means the CA
       cannot sign any sub-CA's, and can only sign end-entity certificates.

   <b>Key</b> <b>Usage</b>
       Key usage is a multi-valued extension consisting of a list of names of the permitted key usages.  The
       defined values are: "digitalSignature", "nonRepudiation", "keyEncipherment", "dataEncipherment",
       "keyAgreement", "keyCertSign", "cRLSign", "encipherOnly", and "decipherOnly".

       Examples:

        keyUsage = digitalSignature, nonRepudiation

        keyUsage = critical, keyCertSign

   <b>Extended</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Usage</b>
       This extension consists of a list of values indicating purposes for which the certificate public key can
       be used.  Each value can be either a short text name or an OID.  The following text names, and their
       intended meaning, are known:

        Value                  Meaning according to RFC 5280 etc.
        -----                  ----------------------------------
        serverAuth             SSL/TLS WWW Server Authentication
        clientAuth             SSL/TLS WWW Client Authentication
        codeSigning            Code Signing
        emailProtection        E-mail Protection (S/MIME)
        timeStamping           Trusted Timestamping
        OCSPSigning            OCSP Signing
        ipsecIKE               ipsec Internet Key Exchange
        msCodeInd              Microsoft Individual Code Signing (authenticode)
        msCodeCom              Microsoft Commercial Code Signing (authenticode)
        msCTLSign              Microsoft Trust List Signing
        msEFS                  Microsoft Encrypted File System

       While IETF RFC 5280 says that <b>id-kp-serverAuth</b> and <b>id-kp-clientAuth</b> are only for WWW use, in practice
       they are used for all kinds of TLS clients and servers, and this is what OpenSSL assumes as well.

       Examples:

        extendedKeyUsage = critical, codeSigning, 1.2.3.4

        extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth, clientAuth

   <b>Subject</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Identifier</b>
       The SKID extension specification has a value with three choices.

       <b>none</b>
           No SKID extension will be included.

       <b>hash</b>
           The  process specified in RFC 5280 section 4.2.1.2. (1) is followed: The keyIdentifier is composed of
           the 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the value of the BIT STRING subjectPublicKey (excluding  the  tag,  length,
           and number of unused bits).

       A hex string (possibly with ":" separating bytes)
           The provided value is output directly.  This choice is strongly discouraged.

       By default the <b>x509</b>, <b>req</b>, and <b>ca</b> apps behave as if <b>hash</b> was given.

       Example:

        subjectKeyIdentifier = hash

   <b>Authority</b> <b>Key</b> <b>Identifier</b>
       The  AKID  extension  specification  may  have  the value <b>none</b> indicating that no AKID shall be included.
       Otherwise it may have the value <b>keyid</b> or <b>issuer</b> or both of them, separated by ",".  Either  or  both  can
       have  the  option  <b>always</b>, indicated by putting a colon ":" between the value and this option.  For self-
       signed certificates the AKID is suppressed unless <b>always</b> is present.

       By default the <b>x509</b>, <b>req</b>, and <b>ca</b> apps behave as if  <b>none</b>  was  given  for  self-signed  certificates  and
       <b>keyid</b>"," <b>issuer</b> otherwise.

       If  <b>keyid</b>  is  present,  an  attempt  is  made  to copy the subject key identifier (SKID) from the issuer
       certificate except if the issuer certificate is the same as the current one and it  is  not  self-signed.
       The  hash  of the public key related to the signing key is taken as fallback if the issuer certificate is
       the same as the current certificate.  If <b>always</b> is present but no value can  be  obtained,  an  error  is
       returned.

       If  <b>issuer</b>  is  present, and in addition it has the option <b>always</b> specified or <b>keyid</b> is not present, then
       the issuer DN and serial number are copied from the issuer certificate.   If  this  fails,  an  error  is
       returned.

       Examples:

        authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid, issuer

        authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid, issuer:always

   <b>Subject</b> <b>Alternative</b> <b>Name</b>
       This  is  a  multi-valued  extension  that supports several types of name identifier, including <b>email</b> (an
       email address), <b>URI</b> (a uniform resource indicator), <b>DNS</b> (a DNS domain name), <b>RID</b> (a registered ID: OBJECT
       IDENTIFIER), <b>IP</b> (an IP address), <b>dirName</b> (a distinguished name), and <b>otherName</b>.  The syntax  of  each  is
       described in the following paragraphs.

       The <b>email</b> option has two special values.  "copy" will automatically include any email addresses contained
       in  the  certificate  subject  name in the extension.  "move" will automatically move any email addresses
       from the certificate subject name to the extension.

       The IP address used in the <b>IP</b> option can be in either IPv4 or IPv6 format.

       The value of <b>dirName</b> is specifies the configuration section containing the distinguished name to use,  as
       a set of name-value pairs.  Multi-valued AVAs can be formed by prefacing the name with a <b>+</b> character.

       The  value  of  <b>otherName</b>  can include arbitrary data associated with an OID; the value should be the OID
       followed by a semicolon and the content in specified using the syntax in <b><a href="../man3/ASN1_generate_nconf.3.html">ASN1_generate_nconf</a></b>(3).

       Examples:

        subjectAltName = email:copy, email:<a href="mailto:my@example.com">my@example.com</a>, URI:<a href="http://my.example.com/">http://my.example.com/</a>

        subjectAltName = IP:192.168.7.1

        subjectAltName = IP:13::17

        subjectAltName = email:<a href="mailto:my@example.com">my@example.com</a>, RID:1.2.3.4

        subjectAltName = otherName:1.2.3.4;UTF8:some other identifier

        [extensions]
        subjectAltName = dirName:dir_sect

        [dir_sect]
        C = UK
        O = My Organization
        OU = My Unit
        CN = My Name

       Non-ASCII Email Address conforming the syntax defined  in  Section  3.3  of  RFC  6531  are  provided  as
       otherName.SmtpUTF8Mailbox.  According to RFC 8398, the email address should be provided as UTF8String. To
       enforce the valid representation in the certificate, the SmtpUTF8Mailbox should be provided as follows

        subjectAltName=@alts
        [alts]
        otherName = 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.8.9;FORMAT:UTF8,UTF8String:nonasciiname.example.com

   <b>Issuer</b> <b>Alternative</b> <b>Name</b>
       This extension supports most of the options of subject alternative name; it does not support  <b>email:copy</b>.
       It  also adds <b>issuer:copy</b> as an allowed value, which copies any subject alternative names from the issuer
       certificate, if possible.

       Example:

        issuerAltName = issuer:copy

   <b>Authority</b> <b>Info</b> <b>Access</b>
       This extension gives details about how to retrieve information that related to the certificate  that  the
       CA  makes  available. The syntax is <b>access_id;location</b>, where <b>access_id</b> is an object identifier (although
       only a few values are well-known) and <b>location</b> has the same syntax as subject  alternative  name  (except
       that <b>email:copy</b> is not supported).

       Possible  values for access_id include <b>OCSP</b> (OCSP responder), <b>caIssuers</b> (CA Issuers), <b>ad_timestamping</b> (AD
       Time Stamping), <b>AD_DVCS</b> (ad dvcs), <b>caRepository</b> (CA Repository).

       Examples:

        authorityInfoAccess = OCSP;URI:<a href="http://ocsp.example.com/">http://ocsp.example.com/</a>,caIssuers;URI:<a href="http://myca.example.com/ca.cer">http://myca.example.com/ca.cer</a>

        authorityInfoAccess = OCSP;URI:<a href="http://ocsp.example.com/">http://ocsp.example.com/</a>

   <b>CRL</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>points</b>
       This is a multi-valued extension whose values can be either a name-value pair  using  the  same  form  as
       subject  alternative  name  or a single value specifying the section name containing all the distribution
       point values.

       When a name-value pair is used, a DistributionPoint extension will be set with the  given  value  as  the
       fullName field as the distributionPoint value, and the reasons and cRLIssuer fields will be omitted.

       When  a  single  option is used, the value specifies the section, and that section can have the following
       items:

       fullname
           The full name of the distribution point, in the same format as the subject alternative name.

       relativename
           The  value  is  taken  as  a  distinguished  name  fragment  that  is  set  as  the  value   of   the
           nameRelativeToCRLIssuer field.

       CRLIssuer
           The value must in the same format as the subject alternative name.

       reasons
           A   multi-value  field  that  contains  the  reasons  for  revocation.  The  recognized  values  are:
           "keyCompromise",   "CACompromise",   "affiliationChanged",   "superseded",    "cessationOfOperation",
           "certificateHold", "privilegeWithdrawn", and "AACompromise".

       Only one of <b>fullname</b> or <b>relativename</b> should be specified.

       Simple examples:

        crlDistributionPoints = URI:<a href="http://example.com/myca.crl">http://example.com/myca.crl</a>

        crlDistributionPoints = URI:<a href="http://example.com/myca.crl">http://example.com/myca.crl</a>, URI:<a href="http://example.org/my.crl">http://example.org/my.crl</a>

       Full distribution point example:

        [extensions]
        crlDistributionPoints = crldp1_section

        [crldp1_section]
        fullname = URI:<a href="http://example.com/myca.crl">http://example.com/myca.crl</a>
        CRLissuer = dirName:issuer_sect
        reasons = keyCompromise, CACompromise

        [issuer_sect]
        C = UK
        O = Organisation
        CN = Some Name

   <b>Issuing</b> <b>Distribution</b> <b>Point</b>
       This  extension should only appear in CRLs. It is a multi-valued extension whose syntax is similar to the
       "section" pointed to by the CRL distribution points extension. The following names have meaning:

       fullname
           The full name of the distribution point, in the same format as the subject alternative name.

       relativename
           The  value  is  taken  as  a  distinguished  name  fragment  that  is  set  as  the  value   of   the
           nameRelativeToCRLIssuer field.

       onlysomereasons
           A   multi-value  field  that  contains  the  reasons  for  revocation.  The  recognized  values  are:
           "keyCompromise",   "CACompromise",   "affiliationChanged",   "superseded",    "cessationOfOperation",
           "certificateHold", "privilegeWithdrawn", and "AACompromise".

       onlyuser, onlyCA, onlyAA, indirectCRL
           The value for each of these names is a boolean.

       Example:

        [extensions]
        issuingDistributionPoint = critical, @idp_section

        [idp_section]
        fullname = URI:<a href="http://example.com/myca.crl">http://example.com/myca.crl</a>
        indirectCRL = TRUE
        onlysomereasons = keyCompromise, CACompromise

   <b>Certificate</b> <b>Policies</b>
       This is a <u>raw</u> extension that supports all of the defined fields of the certificate extension.

       Policies  without qualifiers are specified by giving the OID.  Multiple policies are comma-separated. For
       example:

        certificatePolicies = 1.2.4.5, 1.1.3.4

       To include policy qualifiers, use the "@section" syntax to point to a  section  that  specifies  all  the
       information.

       The  section  referred  to must include the policy OID using the name <b>policyIdentifier</b>. cPSuri qualifiers
       can be included using the syntax:

        CPS.nnn = value

       where "nnn" is a number.

       userNotice qualifiers can be set using the syntax:

        userNotice.nnn = @notice

       The value of the userNotice qualifier is specified in the relevant section.   This  section  can  include
       <b>explicitText</b>,  <b>organization</b>,  and  <b>noticeNumbers</b> options. explicitText and organization are text strings,
       noticeNumbers is a comma separated list of  numbers.  The  organization  and  noticeNumbers  options  (if
       included)  must  BOTH  be  present.  Some software might require the <b>ia5org</b> option at the top level; this
       changes the encoding from Displaytext to IA5String.

       Example:

        [extensions]
        certificatePolicies = ia5org, 1.2.3.4, 1.5.6.7.8, @polsect

        [polsect]
        policyIdentifier = 1.3.5.8
        CPS.1 = "<a href="http://my.host.example.com/">http://my.host.example.com/</a>"
        CPS.2 = "<a href="http://my.your.example.com/">http://my.your.example.com/</a>"
        userNotice.1 = @notice

        [notice]
        explicitText = "Explicit Text Here"
        organization = "Organisation Name"
        noticeNumbers = 1, 2, 3, 4

       The character encoding of explicitText can be specified by prefixing the value with <b>UTF8</b>, <b>BMP</b>, or <b>VISIBLE</b>
       followed by colon. For example:

        [notice]
        explicitText = "UTF8:Explicit Text Here"

   <b>Policy</b> <b>Constraints</b>
       This  is  a  multi-valued  extension   which   consisting   of   the   names   <b>requireExplicitPolicy</b>   or
       <b>inhibitPolicyMapping</b> and a non negative integer value. At least one component must be present.

       Example:

        policyConstraints = requireExplicitPolicy:3

   <b>Inhibit</b> <b>Any</b> <b>Policy</b>
       This is a string extension whose value must be a non negative integer.

       Example:

        inhibitAnyPolicy = 2

   <b>Name</b> <b>Constraints</b>
       This is a multi-valued extension. The name should begin with the word <b>permitted</b> or <b>excluded</b> followed by a
       <b>;</b>.  The  rest  of  the  name  and the value follows the syntax of subjectAltName except <b>email:copy</b> is not
       supported and the <b>IP</b> form should consist of an IP addresses and subnet mask separated by a <b>/</b>.

       Examples:

        nameConstraints = permitted;IP:192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0

        nameConstraints = permitted;email:.example.com

        nameConstraints = excluded;email:.com

   <b>OCSP</b> <b>No</b> <b>Check</b>
       This is a string extension. It is parsed, but ignored.

       Example:

        noCheck = ignored

   <b>TLS</b> <b>Feature</b> <b>(aka</b> <b>Must</b> <b>Staple)</b>
       This is a multi-valued extension consisting of a list of TLS extension identifiers. Each  identifier  may
       be  a  number (0..65535) or a supported name.  When a TLS client sends a listed extension, the TLS server
       is expected to include that extension in its reply.

       The supported names are: <b>status_request</b> and <b>status_request_v2</b>.

       Example:

        tlsfeature = status_request

</pre><h4><b>DEPRECATED</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       The following extensions are non standard, Netscape specific and  largely  obsolete.  Their  use  in  new
       applications is discouraged.

   <b>Netscape</b> <b>String</b> <b>extensions</b>
       Netscape  Comment (<b>nsComment</b>) is a string extension containing a comment which will be displayed when the
       certificate is viewed in some browsers.  Other extensions of this type are:  <b>nsBaseUrl</b>,  <b>nsRevocationUrl</b>,
       <b>nsCaRevocationUrl</b>, <b>nsRenewalUrl</b>, <b>nsCaPolicyUrl</b> and <b>nsSslServerName</b>.

   <b>Netscape</b> <b>Certificate</b> <b>Type</b>
       This  is  a  multi-valued  extensions  which  consists  of a list of flags to be included. It was used to
       indicate the purposes for which a certificate could be used. The basicConstraints, keyUsage and  extended
       key usage extensions are now used instead.

       Acceptable values for nsCertType are: <b>client</b>, <b>server</b>, <b>email</b>, <b>objsign</b>, <b>reserved</b>, <b>sslCA</b>, <b>emailCA</b>, <b>objCA</b>.

</pre><h4><b>ARBITRARY</b> <b>EXTENSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       If  an  extension  is  not  supported  by  the  OpenSSL  code then it must be encoded using the arbitrary
       extension format. It is also possible to use the arbitrary format for supported extensions. Extreme  care
       should be taken to ensure that the data is formatted correctly for the given extension type.

       There are two ways to encode arbitrary extensions.

       The  first  way  is  to  use  the  word  ASN1  followed by the extension content using the same syntax as
       <b><a href="../man3/ASN1_generate_nconf.3.html">ASN1_generate_nconf</a></b>(3).  For example:

        [extensions]
        1.2.3.4 = critical, ASN1:UTF8String:Some random data
        1.2.3.4.1 = ASN1:SEQUENCE:seq_sect

        [seq_sect]
        field1 = UTF8:field1
        field2 = UTF8:field2

       It is also possible to use the word DER to include the raw encoded data in any extension.

        1.2.3.4 = critical, DER:01:02:03:04
        1.2.3.4.1 = DER:01020304

       The value following DER is a hex dump of the DER encoding of the extension Any extension can be placed in
       this form to override the default behaviour.  For example:

        basicConstraints = critical, DER:00:01:02:03

</pre><h4><b>WARNINGS</b></h4><pre>
       There is no guarantee that a specific implementation will process a given extension. It may therefore  be
       sometimes  possible  to  use  certificates for purposes prohibited by their extensions because a specific
       application does not recognize or honour the values of the relevant extensions.

       The DER and ASN1 options should be used with caution. It is possible to create invalid extensions if they
       are not used carefully.
