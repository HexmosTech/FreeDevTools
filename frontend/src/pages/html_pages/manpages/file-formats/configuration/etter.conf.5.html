       etter.conf - Ettercap configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>etter.conf</b>  is  the configuration file that determines ettercap behaviour. It is always loaded at startup
       and it configures some attributes used at runtime.

       The file contains entries of the form:

              <b>[section]</b>
              <b>entry</b> <b>=</b> <b>value</b>
              <u>...</u>

       Each entry defines a variable that can be customized. Every value MUST be an integer. Sections  are  used
       only to group together some variables.

       <b>NOTE:</b>  if  you  omit a variable in the conf file, it will be initialized with the value 0. It is strongly
       discouraged to not initialize critical variables such as "arp_poison_delay" or "connection_timeout".

       The following is a list of available variables:

       <b>[privs]</b>

       <b>ec_uid</b>              This variable specifies the UID to which privileges are dropped at startup. After the
                           socket at link layer has been opened the privileges are dropped  to  a  specific  uid
                           different  from  root  for security reasons. etter.conf is the only file that is read
                           with root privs. Be sure that the specified uid has enough privs to read other  files
                           (etter.*)  You can bypass this variable by setting the environment variable EC_UID.

       <b>[mitm]</b>

       <b>arp_storm_delay</b>     The  value represents the milliseconds to wait between two consecutive packets during
                           the initial ARP scan. You can increment this value to be less aggressive at  startup.
                           The randomized scan plus a high delay can fool some types of ARP scan detectors.

       <b>arp_poison_smart</b>    With this variable set, only 3 initial poisoned ARP messages are sent to the victims.
                           This  poisoned  status  is  kept  up by ettercap with responding to ARP requests from
                           victims that want to refresh their ARP cache.  This  makes  the  ARP  poisoning  very
                           stealthy but may be unreliable on shared media such as WiFi.

       <b>arp_poison_warm_up</b>  When  the  poisoning  process  starts,  the inter-packet delay is low for the first 5
                           poisons (to be sure the poisoning process has been successful).  After  the  first  5
                           poisons,  the delay is incremented (to keep up the poisoning). This variable controls
                           the delay for the first 5 poisons. The value is in seconds.
                           The same delay is used when the victims are restored  to  the  original  associations
                           (RE-ARPing) when ettercap is closed.

       <b>arp_poison_delay</b>    This  variable  controls  the poisoning delay after the first 5 poisons. The value is
                           expressed in seconds. You can increase this value (to try to fool the IDS) up to  the
                           timeout of the ARP cache (which depends on the poisoned operating system).

       <b>arp_poison_icmp</b>     Enable  the  sending  of  a  spoofed ICMP message to force the targets to make an arp
                           request. This will create an arp entry in the host cache, so ettercap will be able to
                           win the race condition and poison the target. Useful  against  targets  that  do  not
                           accept gratuitous arp if the entry is not in the cache.

       <b>arp_poison_reply</b>    Use ARP replies to poison the targets. This is the classic attack.

       <b>arp_poison_request</b>  Use  ARP  request  to  poison the targets. Useful against targets that cache even arp
                           request values.

       <b>arp_poison_equal_mac</b>
                           Set this option to 0 if you want to skip the poisoning of two hosts with the same mac
                           address. This may happen if a NIC has one or more aliases on the same network.

       <b>dhcp_lease_time</b>     This is the lease time (in seconds) for a dhcp assignment. You can lower  this  value
                           to  permit  the  victims  to receive a correct dhcp reply after you have stopped your
                           attack. Using higher timeouts can seriously mess up your network after the attack has
                           finished. On the other hand some clients will prefer a higher lease time, so you have
                           to increase it to win the race condition against the real server.

       <b>port_steal_delay</b>    This is the delay time (in milliseconds) between stealing packets for the "port" mitm
                           method. With low delays you will be able to intercept  more  packets,  but  you  will
                           generate  more  traffic.  You have to tune this value in order to find a good balance
                           between the number of intercepted packets, re-transmitted packets and  lost  packets.
                           This  value  depends  on  full/half  duplex  channels,  network drivers and adapters,
                           network general configuration and hardware.

       <b>port_steal_send_delay</b>
                           This is the delay time (in microseconds) between packets when the "port" mitm  method
                           has  to  re-send  packets  queues. As said for port_steal_delay you have to tune this
                           option to the lowest acceptable value.

       <b>ndp_poison_warm_up</b>  This option operates similar to the arp_poison_warm_up option.   When  the  poisoning
                           process starts, this option controls the NDP poison delay for the first 5 poisons (to
                           be  sure  the poisoning process has been successful).  After the first 5 poisons, the
                           delay is incremented (to keep up the poisoning).  This variable  controls  the  delay
                           for  the  first  5  poisons. The value should be lower than the <b>ndp_poison_delay</b>. The
                           value is in seconds.
                           The same delay is used when the victims are restored to the original associations
                            when ettercap is closed.

       <b>ndp_poison_delay</b>    This option is similar to the arp_poison_delay option.   It  controls  the  delay  in
                           seconds  for  sending out the poisoned NDP packets to poison victim's neighbor cache.
                           This value may be increased to hide from IDSs.  But increasing the value increases as
                           well the probability for failing race conditions during  neighbor  discovery  and  to
                           miss some packets.

       <b>ndp_poison_send_delay</b>
                           This option controls the delay in microseconds between poisoned NDP packets are sent.
                           This  value may be increased to hide from IDSs. But increasing the value increases as
                           well the probability for failing race conditions during  neighbor  discovery  and  to
                           miss some packets.

       <b>ndp_poison_icmp</b>     Enable  the  sending  of  a spoofed ICMPv6 message to motivate the targets to perform
                           neighbor discovery. This will create an entry in the host neighbor cache, so ettercap
                           will be able to win the race condition and poison the target. Useful against  targets
                           that do not accept neighbor advertisements if the entry is not in the cache.

       <b>ndp_poison_equal_mac</b>
                           Set this option to 0 if you want to skip the NDP poisoning of two hosts with the same
                           mac address. This may happen if a NIC has one or more aliases on the same network.

       <b>icmp6_probe_delay</b>   This  option  defines  the  time  in  seconds ettercap waits for active IPv6 nodes to
                           respond to the ICMP probes. Decreasing this value could lead  to  miss  replies  from
                           active IPv6 nodes, hence miss them in the host list. Increasing the value usually has
                           no impact; normally nodes can manage to answer during the default delay.

                           <b>NOTE:</b>  The  ndp  and icmp6 options are only available if ettercap has been built with
                           IPv6 support

       <b>[connections]</b>

       <b>connection_timeout</b>  Every time a new connection is discovered, ettercap allocates the needed  structures.
                           After  a customizable timeout, you can free these structures to keep the memory usage
                           low. This variable represents this timeout. The value is expressed in  seconds.  This
                           timeout  is  applied  even to the session tracking system (the protocol state machine
                           for dissectors).

       <b>connection_idle</b>     The number of seconds to wait before a connection is marked as IDLE.

       <b>connection_buffer</b>   This variable controls the size of the  buffer  linked  to  each  connection.   Every
                           sniffed  packet  is added to the buffer and when the buffer is full the older packets
                           are deleted to make room for newer ones. This buffer is useful to view data that went
                           on the cable before you select and view a specific connection. The higher this value,
                           the higher the ettercap memory occupation.  By the way, the buffer is dynamic, so  if
                           you set a buffer of 100.000 byte it is not allocated all together at the first packet
                           of a connection, but it is filled as packets arrive.

       <b>connect_timeout</b>     The  timeout  in  seconds  when using the connect() syscall. Increase it if you get a
                           "Connection timeout" error. This option has nothing to do with connections sniffed by
                           ettercap. It is a timeout for the connections made by ettercap to  other  hosts  (for
                           example when fingerprinting remote host).

       <b>[stats]</b>

       <b>sampling_rate</b>       Ettercap  keeps  some  statistics  on  the  processing  time  of the bottom half (the
                           sniffer) and top half (the protocol  decoder).  These  statistics  are  made  on  the
                           average processing time of sampling_rate packets. You can decrease this value to have
                           a  more  accurate  real-time  picture  of  processing  time  or increase it to have a
                           smoother picture. The total average will not change, but  the  worst  value  will  be
                           heavily influenced by this value.

       <b>[misc]</b>

       <b>close_on_eof</b>        When  reading  from a dump file and using console or daemon UI, this variable is used
                           to determine what action has to be done on EOF. It is a boolean value. If  set  to  1
                           ettercap  will  close itself (useful in scripts). Otherwise the session will continue
                           waiting for user input.

       <b>store_profiles</b>      Ettercap collects in memory a profile for each host it detects. Users  and  passwords
                           are  collected  there.  If  you  want  to  run ettercap in background logging all the
                           traffic, you may want to disable the collecting in memory to save system memory.  Set
                           this  option  to  0  (zero) to disable profiles collection.  A value of 1 will enable
                           collection for all the hosts, 2 will collect only local hosts and 3 only remote hosts
                           (a host is considered remote if it does not belong to the netmask).

       <b>aggressive_dissectors</b>
                           Some dissectors (such as SSH and HTTPS) need to modify the payload of the packets  in
                           order  to  collect  passwords and perform a decryption attack. If you want to disable
                           the "dangerous" dissectors all together, set this value to 0.

       <b>skip_forwarded</b>      If you set this value to 0 you will sniff even packets forwarded by  ettercap  or  by
                           the  kernel.  It  will  generate  duplicate  packets in conjunction with the arp mitm
                           method (for example). It could be useful while running ettercap in  unoffensive  mode
                           on  a  host  with more than one network interface (waiting for the multiple-interface
                           feature...)

       <b>checksum_warning</b>    If you set the value to  0  the  messages  about  incorrect  checksums  will  not  be
                           displayed in the user messages windows (nor logged to a file with -m).
                           Note that this option will not disable the check on the packets, but only prevent the
                           message to be displayed (see below).

       <b>checksum_check</b>      This  option  is  used to completely disable the check on the checksum of the packets
                           that ettercap receives. The check on the  packets  is  performed  to  avoid  ettercap
                           spotting  thru  bad checsum packets (see Phrack 60.12). If you disable the check, you
                           will be able to sniff even bad checksummed packet, but you will be spotted if someone
                           is searching for you...

       <b>sniffing_at_startup</b> If this option is set to 1, then ettercap will immediately start unified  or  bridged
                           sniffing after the setup phase has been completed. This option helps to avoid traffic
                           blocking  when  a  MITM  technique  has been started but forgotten to start sniffing.
                           Therefore this options is set to 1 by default.
                           If this behaviour is not desired set it to  0  to  manually  control  the  status  of
                           unified or bridged sniffing after ettercap startet.  However, sniffing can be stopped
                           and started at any time while ettercap runs.

       <b>geoip_support_enable</b>
                           This option controls if GeoIP information shall be processed for IP addresses whether
                           or not ettercap has been built with GeoIP support.

       <b>gtkui_prefer_dark_theme</b>
                           This option tries to enforce the dark variant of the applied theme. However this does
                           only  have  an  effect  if  the  applied theme provides a dark variant.  Normally the
                           desktop environment controls the theme of applications. But some lightweight  desktop
                           environments  doesn't  support  a  configuration option for dark themes even when the
                           theme provides a dark variant.  To leave the theme variant  setting  to  the  desktop
                           environment this option is set to 0 by default.
                           <b>NOTE:</b>  This  option  is only relevant in GTK mode and if ettercap has been built with
                           full GTK3 support.

       <b>[dissectors]</b>

       <b>protocol_name</b>       This value represents the port on which the protocol dissector has  to  be  bound.  A
                           value  of  0  will disable the dissector. The name of the variable is the same of the
                           protocol name. You can specify a non standard port for  each  dissector  as  well  as
                           multiple   ports.   The   syntax   for   multiport   selection   is   the  following:
                           port1,port2,port3,...
                           NOTE: some dissectors are conditionally compiled . This means that depending  on  the
                           libraries  found  in your system some dissectors will be enabled and some others will
                           not. By default etter.conf contains all supported dissectors. if you  got  a  "FATAL:
                           Dissector  "xxx" does not exists (etter.conf line yy)" error, you have to comment out
                           the yy line in etter.conf.

       <b>[curses]</b>

       <b>color</b>               You can customize the colors of the curses GUI.
                           Simply set a field to one of the following values and look at the GUI aspect :)
                           Here is a list of values: 0 Black, 1 Red, 2 Green, 3 Yellow, 4  Blue,  5  Magenta,  6
                           Cyan, 7 White

       <b>[strings]</b>

       <b>utf8_encoding</b>       specifies  the encoding to be used while displaying the packets in UTF-8 format.  Use
                           the `iconv --list` command for a list of supported encodings.

       <b>remote_browser</b>      This command is executed by the remote_browser plugin each time it catches a good URL
                           request into an HTTP connection.  The command should be able to get 2 parameters:

                           <b>%host</b>  the Host: tag in the HTTP header. Used to create the  full  request  into  the
                                  browser.

                           <b>%url</b>   The page requested inside the GET request.

       <b>redir_command_on</b>    You  must provide a valid command (or script) to enable tcp redirection at the kernel
                           level in order to be able to use SSL dissection. Your script should be able to get  5
                           parameters:

                           <b>%iface</b> The network interface on which the rule must be set

                           <b>%source</b>
                                  The  source  IP  or  network matching the packets to be redirected (default is
                                  0.0.0.0/0, ::/0 resp. or any)

                           <b>%destination</b>
                                  The destination IP or network matching the packets to be  redirected  (default
                                  is 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0 resp. or any)

                           <b>%port</b>  The source port of the packets to be redirected (443 for HTTPS, 993 for imaps,
                                  etc).

                           <b>%rport</b> The internally bound port to which ettercap listens for connections.
       NOTE:  this  script is executed with an execve(), so you cannot use pipes or output redirection as if you
       were in a shell. We suggest you to make a script if you need those commands.

       NOTE: for this to work, you must set ec_uid to a UID what is privileged to execute the  redir_command  or
       provide a setuid program.

       <b>redir_command_off</b>   This  script is used to remove the redirect rules applied by 'redir_command_on'.  You
                           should note that this script is called atexit() and thus it has not high  privileges.
                           You  should  provide a setuid program or set ec_uid to 0 in order to be sure that the
                           script is executed successfully.
