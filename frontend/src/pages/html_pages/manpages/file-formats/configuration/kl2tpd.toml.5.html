</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>kl2tpd.toml</b> - configuration file for <b>kl2tpd</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>kl2tpd.toml</b> file configures <b>kl2tpd</b>.  It calls out the L2TP tunnels and sessions to establish.

       <b>kl2tpd.toml</b> is written in the TOML markup language (https://toml.io/en/).

       Tunnel and session instances are called out in the configuration file using named TOML tables.

       Each  tunnel  or  session instance table contains configuration parameters for that instance as key:value
       pairs.

       Each tunnel and session has a minimal set of configuration which <u><b>must</b></u> be specified.

       In addition, each tunnel or session entry may call  out  various  optional  key:value  pairs  which  will
       control <b>kl2tpd</b>’s runtime behaviour.

       These  options are generally not required, and <b>kl2tpd</b> will use sensible defaults for them if they are not
       included in the configuration.

   <b>TUNNEL</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       Tunnels are described using named entries in the `tunnel' table.

       Each tunnel entry describes a single tunnel instance, and must call out at least:

       • the peer’s IP address,

       • the tunnel L2TP version (currently only L2TPv2 is supported),

       • the tunnels encapsulation protocol (currently only UDP is supported).

       Here is the full list of tunnel configuration options:

              # This is a tunnel instance named "t1"
              [tunnel.t1]

              # peer specifies the address of the peer that the tunnel should
              # connect its socket to
              peer = "127.0.0.1:5001"

              # version specifies the version of the L2TP specification the
              # tunnel should use.
              # Currently supported values are "l2tpv2".
              version = "l2tpv2"

              # encap specifies the encapsulation to be used for the tunnel.
              # L2TPv2 tunnels are UDP only.
              encap = "udp"

              # local specifies the local address that the tunnel should
              # bind its socket to
              local = "127.0.0.1:5000"

              # tid specifies the local tunnel ID of the tunnel.
              # Tunnel IDs must be unique for the host.
              # L2TPv2 tunnel IDs are 16 bit, and may be in the range 1 - 65535.
              # L2TPv3 tunnel IDs are 32 bit, and may be in the range 1 - 4294967295.
              tid = 62719

              # ptid specifies the peer's tunnel ID for the tunnel.
              # The peer's tunnel ID must be unique for the peer, and are unrelated
              # to the local tunnel ID.
              # The rules for tunnel ID range apply to the peer tunnel ID too.
              ptid = 72819

              # window_size specifies the initial window size to use for the L2TP
              # reliable transport algorithm which is used for control protocol
              # messages.  The window size dictates how many control messages the
              # tunnel may have "in flight" (i.e. pending an ACK from the peer) at
              # any one time.  Tuning the window size can allow high-volume L2TP servers
              # to improve performance.  Generally it won't be necessary to change
              # this from the default value of 4.
              window_size = 10 # control messages

              # hello_timeout if set enables L2TP keep-alive (HELLO) messages.
              # A hello message is sent N milliseconds after the last control
              # message was sent or received.  It allows for early detection of
              # tunnel failure on quiet connections.
              # By default no keep-alive messages are sent.
              hello_timeout = 7500 # milliseconds

              # retry_timeout if set tweaks the starting retry timeout for the
              # reliable transport algorithm used for L2TP control messages.
              # The algorithm uses an exponential backoff when retrying messages.
              # By default a starting retry timeout of 1000ms is used.
              retry_timeout = 1500 # milliseconds

              # max_retries sets how many times a given control message may be
              # retried before the transport considers the message transmission to
              # have failed.
              # It may be useful to tune this value on unreliable network connections
              # to avoid suprious tunnel failure, or conversely to allow for quicker
              # tunnel failure detection on reliable links.
              # The default is 3 retries.
              max_retries 5

              # host_name sets the host name the tunnel will advertise in the
              # Host Name AVP per RFC2661.
              # If unset the host's name will be queried and the returned value used.
              host_name "basilbrush.local"

              # framing_caps sets the framing capabilities the tunnel will advertise
              # in the Framing Capabilities AVP per RFC2661.
              # The default is to advertise both sync and async framing.
              framing_caps = ["sync","async"]

   <b>SESSION</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b>
       Sessions are described using named entries in the `session' table inside the parent tunnel table.

       Each session entry describes a single session instance within the parent tunnel, and  must  call  out  at
       least:

       • the pseudowire type to be used (for L2TPv2 this must be ppp or pppac).

       Here is the full list of session configuration options:

              # This is a session instance called "s1" within parent tunnel "t1".
              # Session instances are always created inside a parent tunnel.
              [tunnel.t1.session.s1]

              # pseudowire specifies the type of layer 2 frames carried by the session.
              # Currently supported values are "ppp", "eth", and "pppac".
              # L2TPv2 tunnels support PPP and PPPAC pseudowires only.
              pseudowire = "eth"

              # pppd_args specifes a file to be read for pppd arguments.  These should
              # be either whitespace or newline delimited, and should call out pppd command
              # line arguments as described in the pppd manpage.
              pppd_args = "/etc/kl2tpd/t1s1_pppd_args.txt"

              # sid specifies the local session ID of the session.
              # Session IDs must be unique to the tunnel for L2TPv2, or unique to
              # the peer for L2TPv3.
              # L2TPv2 session IDs are 16 bit, and may be in the range 1 - 65535.
              # L2TPv3 session IDs are 32 bit, and may be in the range 1 - 4294967295.
              sid = 12389

              # psid specifies the peer's session ID for the session.
              # The peer's session ID is unrelated to the local session ID.
              # The rules for the session ID range apply to the peer session ID too.
              psid = 1234

              # seqnum, if set, enables the transmission of sequence numbers with
              # L2TP data messages.  Use of sequence numbers enables the data plane
              # to reorder data packets to ensure they are delivered in sequence.
              # By default sequence numbers are not used.
              seqnum = false

              # pppoe_session_id specifies the assigned PPPoE session ID for the session.
              # Per RFC2516, the PPPoE session ID is in the range 1 - 65535
              # This parameter only applies to pppac pseudowires.
              pppoe_session_id = 1234

              # pppoe_peer_mac specifies the MAC address of the PPPoE peer for the session.
              # This parameter only applies to pppac pseudowires.
              pppoe_peer_mac = [ 0x02, 0x42, 0x94, 0xd1, 0x4e, 0x9a ]
