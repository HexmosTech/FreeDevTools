</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       burst_buffer.conf - Slurm configuration file for burst buffer management.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>burst_buffer.conf</b> is an ASCII file which describes the configuration of burst buffer resource management.
       This  file  is  only  required  on  the head node(s), where the slurmctld daemon executes.  The file will
       always be located in the same directory as the <b>slurm.conf</b>.

       Parameter names are case insensitive.  Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated as a
       comment through the end of that line.  Changes to the configuration file  take  effect  upon  restart  of
       Slurm daemons, daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution of the command "scontrol reconfigure".

       The configuration parameters available include:

       <b>AllowUsers</b>
              Comma  separated  list  of  user  names  and/or  IDs  permitted to use burst buffers.  The options
              <b>AllowUsers</b> and <b>DenyUsers</b> can not both be specified.  By default all users  are  permitted  to  use
              burst buffers.

       <b>DefaultPool</b>
              Name  of  the  pool used by default for resource allocations.  The default value is the first pool
              reported  by  the  burst   buffer   infrastructure.    This   option   is   only   used   by   the
              burst_buffer/datawarp plugin.

       <b>DenyUsers</b>
              Colon  delimited  list  of  user names and/or IDs prevented from using burst buffers.  The options
              <b>AllowUsers</b> and <b>DenyUsers</b> can not both be specified.  By default all users  are  permitted  to  use
              burst buffers.

       <b>Directive</b>
              The  string  that must be used by a job to request a burst buffer. This string must be immediately
              preceded by a single '#' character. This is currently only used by the lua  plugin.  For  the  lua
              plugin, the default value is "BB_LUA".  See burst_buffer.html for more details.

       <b>Flags</b>  String  used  to  control  various functions.  Multiple options may be comma separated.  Supported
              options include:

              <b>DisablePersistent</b>
                     Prevents regular users from being able to create  and  destroy  persistent  burst  buffers.
                     This  is  the  default behavior, only privileged users (Slurm operators and administrators)
                     can create or destroy persistent burst buffers.

              <b>EmulateCray</b>
                     Emulating a Cray DataWarp system using the dw_wlm_cli script in  the  burst_buffer/datawarp
                     plugin.  This is only used by the datawarp plugin.

              <b>EnablePersistent</b>
                     Enables  regular  users  to  create and destroy persistent burst buffers.  By default, only
                     privileged users (Slurm operators and administrators)  can  create  or  destroy  persistent
                     burst buffers.  This is only used by the datawarp plugin.

              <b>PrivateData</b>
                     If set, then only Slurm operators and the burst buffer owner can see burst buffer data.

              <b>TeardownFailure</b>
                     If set, then teardown a burst buffer after file staging error. Otherwise preserve the burst
                     buffer for analysis and manual teardown.

       <b>GetSysState</b>
              Fully  qualified path name of a program which will return the current burst buffer state.  For the
              DataWarp plugin, this should be the path of the  <u>dw_wlm_cli</u>  command  and  its  default  value  is
              /opt/cray/dw_wlm/default/bin/dw_wlm_cli.  This is not used by the lua plugin.

       <b>GetSysStatus</b>
              Fully qualified path name of a program which will return the current burst buffer status.  For the
              DataWarp  plugin,  this  should  be  the  path  of  the  <u>dwstat</u>  command  and its default value is
              /opt/cray/dws/default/bin/dwstat.  This is not used by the lua plugin.

       <b>OtherTimeout</b>
              If a burst buffer operation (other than job validation, stage in, or stage out)  runs  for  longer
              than  this  number of seconds, the job will be placed in a held state.  A Slurm administrator will
              be required to release the job.  By default there is a 300 second (5  minute)  timeout  for  these
              operations.   Also  see <b>StageInTimeout</b>, <b>StageOutTimeout</b>, and <b>ValidateTimeout</b> options.  For the lua
              plugin, the maximum timeout value is 2073600 seconds (24 days).

       <b>PollInterval</b>
              This option only applies to the lua plugin.  If the test_data_{in|out} hooks  return  success  and
              "BUSY",  then  they  will  be  called again after waiting for the specified number of seconds. The
              default value is 15 seconds.

       <b>PrivateData</b>
              If set to "true" then users will only  be  able  to  view  burst  buffers  they  can  use.   Slurm
              administrators will still be able to view all burst buffers.  By default, users can view all burst
              buffers.

       <b>StageInTimeout</b>
              If  the  stage in of files for a job takes more than this number of seconds, the burst buffer will
              be released and the job will be placed in a held state.  A Slurm administrator will be required to
              release the job.  By default there is a one day timeout for the stage in  process.   For  the  lua
              plugin, the maximum timeout value is 2073600 seconds (24 days).

       <b>StageOutTimeout</b>
              If  the stage out of files for a job takes more than this number of seconds, the burst buffer will
              be released and the job will be purged.  By default there is a one day timeout for the  stage  out
              process.  For the lua plugin, the maximum timeout value is 2073600 seconds (24 days).

       <b>ValidateTimeout</b>
              If  the  validation  of  a  job  submission  request  takes  more than this number of seconds, the
              submission will be rejected.  The value  of  <b>ValidateTimeout</b>  must  be  less  than  the  value  of
              <b>MessageTimeout</b>  configured  in  the  slurm.conf  file  or  job submission requests may fail with a
              response timeout error.  By default there is a 5 second timeout for the validation operations.  In
              the lua plugin, because the validation operation cannot be killed, this option is not used.
