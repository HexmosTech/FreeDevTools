</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       login.defs - shadow password suite configuration

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <a href="file:/etc/login.defs">/etc/login.defs</a> file defines the site-specific configuration for the shadow password suite. This file
       is required. Absence of this file will not prevent system operation, but will probably result in
       undesirable operation.

       This file is a readable text file, each line of the file describing one configuration parameter. The
       lines consist of a configuration name and value, separated by whitespace. Blank lines and comment lines
       are ignored. Comments are introduced with a "#" pound sign and the pound sign must be the first non-white
       character of the line.

       Parameter values may be of four types: strings, booleans, numbers, and long numbers. A string is
       comprised of any printable characters. A boolean should be either the value <u>yes</u> or <u>no</u>. An undefined
       boolean parameter or one with a value other than these will be given a <u>no</u> value. Numbers (both regular
       and long) may be either decimal values, octal values (precede the value with <u>0</u>) or hexadecimal values
       (precede the value with <u>0x</u>). The maximum value of the regular and long numeric parameters is
       machine-dependent.

       The following configuration items are provided:

       <b>CHFN_RESTRICT</b> (string)
           This parameter specifies which values in the <u>gecos</u> field of the <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> file may be changed by
           regular users using the <b>chfn</b> program. It can be any combination of letters <u>f</u>, <u>r</u>, <u>w</u>, <u>h</u>, for Full name,
           Room number, Work phone, and Home phone, respectively. For backward compatibility, <u>yes</u> is equivalent
           to <u>rwh</u> and <u>no</u> is equivalent to <u>frwh</u>. If not specified, only the superuser can make any changes. The
           most restrictive setting is better achieved by not installing <b>chfn</b> SUID.

       <b>CREATE_HOME</b> (boolean)
           Indicate if a home directory should be created by default for new users.

           This setting does not apply to system users, and can be overridden on the command line.

       <b>DEFAULT_HOME</b> (boolean)
           Indicate if login is allowed if we can't cd to the home directory. Default is no.

           If set to <u>yes</u>, the user will login in the root (/) directory if it is not possible to cd to her home
           directory.

       <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD</b> (string)
           This defines the system default encryption algorithm for encrypting passwords (if no algorithm are
           specified on the command line).

           It can take one of these values: <u>DES</u> (default), <u>MD5</u>, <u>SHA256</u>, <u>SHA512</u>, <u>YESCRYPT</u>. MD5 and DES should not
           be used for new hashes, see <a href="../man5/crypt.5.html">crypt</a>(5) for recommendations.

           Note: this parameter overrides the <b>MD5_CRYPT_ENAB</b> variable.

           Note: This only affect the generation of group passwords. The generation of user passwords is done by
           PAM and subject to the PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable consistently with
           the PAM configuration.

       <b>ENV_PATH</b> (string)
           If set, it will be used to define the PATH environment variable when a regular user login. The value
           is a colon separated list of paths (for example <u><a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a></u>) and can be preceded by <u>PATH=</u>. The
           default value is <u>PATH=<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a></u>.

       <b>ENV_SUPATH</b> (string)
           If set, it will be used to define the PATH environment variable when the superuser login. The value
           is a colon separated list of paths (for example <u><a href="file:/sbin">/sbin</a>:<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a></u>) and can be preceded by
           <u>PATH=</u>. The default value is <u>PATH=<a href="file:/sbin">/sbin</a>:<a href="file:/bin">/bin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/sbin">/usr/sbin</a>:<a href="file:/usr/bin">/usr/bin</a></u>.

       <b>ERASECHAR</b> (number)
           Terminal ERASE character (<u>010</u> = backspace, <u>0177</u> = DEL).

           The value can be prefixed "0" for an octal value, or "0x" for an hexadecimal value.

       <b>FAIL_DELAY</b> (number)
           Delay in seconds before being allowed another attempt after a login failure.

       <b>FAKE_SHELL</b> (string)
           If set, <b>login</b> will execute this shell instead of the users' shell specified in /etc/passwd.

       <b>GID_MAX</b> (number), <b>GID_MIN</b> (number)
           Range of group IDs used for the creation of regular groups by <b>useradd</b>, <b>groupadd</b>, or <b>newusers</b>.

           The default value for <b>GID_MIN</b> (resp.  <b>GID_MAX</b>) is 1000 (resp. 60000).

       <b>HOME_MODE</b> (number)
           The mode for new home directories. If not specified, the <b>UMASK</b> is used to create the mode.

           <b>useradd</b> and <b>newusers</b> use this to set the mode of the home directory they create.

       <b>HUSHLOGIN_FILE</b> (string)
           If defined, this file can inhibit all the usual chatter during the login sequence. If a full pathname
           is specified, then hushed mode will be enabled if the user's name or shell are found in the file. If
           not a full pathname, then hushed mode will be enabled if the file exists in the user's home
           directory.

       <b>KILLCHAR</b> (number)
           Terminal KILL character (<u>025</u> = CTRL/U).

           The value can be prefixed "0" for an octal value, or "0x" for an hexadecimal value.

       <b>LASTLOG_UID_MAX</b> (number)
           Highest user ID number for which the lastlog entries should be updated. As higher user IDs are
           usually tracked by remote user identity and authentication services there is no need to create a huge
           sparse lastlog file for them.

           No <b>LASTLOG_UID_MAX</b> option present in the configuration means that there is no user ID limit for
           writing lastlog entries.

       <b>LOG_OK_LOGINS</b> (boolean)
           Enable logging of successful logins.

       <b>LOG_UNKFAIL_ENAB</b> (boolean)
           Enable display of unknown usernames when login failures are recorded.

           Note: logging unknown usernames may be a security issue if an user enter her password instead of her
           login name.

       <b>LOGIN_RETRIES</b> (number)
           Maximum number of login retries in case of bad password.

           This will most likely be overridden by PAM, since the default pam_unix module has its own built in of
           3 retries. However, this is a safe fallback in case you are using an authentication module that does
           not enforce PAM_MAXTRIES.

       <b>LOGIN_TIMEOUT</b> (number)
           Max time in seconds for login.

       <b>MAIL_DIR</b> (string)
           The mail spool directory. This is needed to manipulate the mailbox when its corresponding user
           account is modified or deleted. If not specified, a compile-time default is used. The parameter
           CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL in <a href="file:/etc/default/useradd">/etc/default/useradd</a> determines whether the mail spool should be created.

       <b>MAIL_FILE</b> (string)
           Defines the location of the users mail spool files relatively to their home directory.

       The <b>MAIL_DIR</b> and <b>MAIL_FILE</b> variables are used by <b>useradd</b>, <b>usermod</b>, and <b>userdel</b> to create, move, or delete
       the user's mail spool.

       <b>MAX_MEMBERS_PER_GROUP</b> (number)
           Maximum members per group entry. When the maximum is reached, a new group entry (line) is started in
           <a href="file:/etc/group">/etc/group</a> (with the same name, same password, and same GID).

           The default value is 0, meaning that there are no limits in the number of members in a group.

           This feature (split group) permits to limit the length of lines in the group file. This is useful to
           make sure that lines for NIS groups are not larger than 1024 characters.

           If you need to enforce such limit, you can use 25.

           Note: split groups may not be supported by all tools (even in the Shadow toolsuite). You should not
           use this variable unless you really need it.

       <b>MD5_CRYPT_ENAB</b> (boolean)
           Indicate if passwords must be encrypted using the MD5-based algorithm. If set to <u>yes</u>, new passwords
           will be encrypted using the MD5-based algorithm compatible with the one used by recent releases of
           FreeBSD. It supports passwords of unlimited length and longer salt strings. Set to <u>no</u> if you need to
           copy encrypted passwords to other systems which don't understand the new algorithm. Default is <u>no</u>.

           This variable is superseded by the <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD</b> variable or by any command line option used to
           configure the encryption algorithm.

           This variable is deprecated. You should use <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD</b>.

           Note: This only affect the generation of group passwords. The generation of user passwords is done by
           PAM and subject to the PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable consistently with
           the PAM configuration.

       <b>NONEXISTENT</b> (string)
           If a system account intentionally does not have a home directory that exists, this string can be
           provided in the <a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a> entry for the account to indicate this. The result is that pwck will not
           emit a spurious warning for this account.

       <b>PASS_MAX_DAYS</b> (number)
           The maximum number of days a password may be used. If the password is older than this, a password
           change will be forced. If not specified, -1 will be assumed (which disables the restriction).

       <b>PASS_MIN_DAYS</b> (number)
           The minimum number of days allowed between password changes. Any password changes attempted sooner
           than this will be rejected. If not specified, 0 will be assumed (which disables the restriction).

       <b>PASS_WARN_AGE</b> (number)
           The number of days warning given before a password expires. A zero means warning is given only upon
           the day of expiration, a value of -1 means no warning is given. If not specified, no warning will be
           provided.

       <b>PASS_MAX_DAYS</b>, <b>PASS_MIN_DAYS</b> and <b>PASS_WARN_AGE</b> are only used at the time of account creation. Any changes
       to these settings won't affect existing accounts.

       <b>SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS</b> (number), <b>SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS</b> (number)
           When <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD</b> is set to <u>SHA256</u> or <u>SHA512</u>, this defines the number of SHA rounds used by the
           encryption algorithm by default (when the number of rounds is not specified on the command line).

           With a lot of rounds, it is more difficult to brute force the password. But note also that more CPU
           resources will be needed to authenticate users.

           If not specified, the libc will choose the default number of rounds (5000), which is orders of
           magnitude too low for modern hardware.

           The values must be inside the 1000-999,999,999 range.

           If only one of the <b>SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS</b> or <b>SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS</b> values is set, then this value will
           be used.

           If <b>SHA_CRYPT_MIN_ROUNDS</b> &gt; <b>SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS</b>, the highest value will be used.

           Note: This only affect the generation of group passwords. The generation of user passwords is done by
           PAM and subject to the PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable consistently with
           the PAM configuration.

       <b>SULOG_FILE</b> (string)
           If defined, all su activity is logged to this file.

       <b>SU_NAME</b> (string)
           If defined, the command name to display when running "su -". For example, if this is defined as "su"
           then a "ps" will display the command is "-su". If not defined, then "ps" would display the name of
           the shell actually being run, e.g. something like "-sh".

       <b>SUB_GID_MIN</b> (number), <b>SUB_GID_MAX</b> (number), <b>SUB_GID_COUNT</b> (number)
           If <a href="file:/etc/subuid">/etc/subuid</a> exists, the commands <b>useradd</b> and <b>newusers</b> (unless the user already have subordinate
           group IDs) allocate <b>SUB_GID_COUNT</b> unused group IDs from the range <b>SUB_GID_MIN</b> to <b>SUB_GID_MAX</b> for each
           new user.

           The default values for <b>SUB_GID_MIN</b>, <b>SUB_GID_MAX</b>, <b>SUB_GID_COUNT</b> are respectively 100000, 600100000 and
           65536.

       <b>SUB_UID_MIN</b> (number), <b>SUB_UID_MAX</b> (number), <b>SUB_UID_COUNT</b> (number)
           If <a href="file:/etc/subuid">/etc/subuid</a> exists, the commands <b>useradd</b> and <b>newusers</b> (unless the user already have subordinate
           user IDs) allocate <b>SUB_UID_COUNT</b> unused user IDs from the range <b>SUB_UID_MIN</b> to <b>SUB_UID_MAX</b> for each
           new user.

           The default values for <b>SUB_UID_MIN</b>, <b>SUB_UID_MAX</b>, <b>SUB_UID_COUNT</b> are respectively 100000, 600100000 and
           65536.

       <b>SYS_GID_MAX</b> (number), <b>SYS_GID_MIN</b> (number)
           Range of group IDs used for the creation of system groups by <b>useradd</b>, <b>groupadd</b>, or <b>newusers</b>.

           The default value for <b>SYS_GID_MIN</b> (resp.  <b>SYS_GID_MAX</b>) is 101 (resp.  <b>GID_MIN</b>-1).

       <b>SYS_UID_MAX</b> (number), <b>SYS_UID_MIN</b> (number)
           Range of user IDs used for the creation of system users by <b>useradd</b> or <b>newusers</b>.

           The default value for <b>SYS_UID_MIN</b> (resp.  <b>SYS_UID_MAX</b>) is 101 (resp.  <b>UID_MIN</b>-1).

       <b>SYSLOG_SG_ENAB</b> (boolean)
           Enable "syslog" logging of <b>sg</b> activity.

       <b>SYSLOG_SU_ENAB</b> (boolean)
           Enable "syslog" logging of <b>su</b> activity - in addition to sulog file logging.

       <b>TTYGROUP</b> (string), <b>TTYPERM</b> (number)
           The terminal permissions: the login tty will be owned by the <b>TTYGROUP</b> group, and the permissions will
           be set to <b>TTYPERM</b>.

           <b>TTYGROUP</b> can be either the name of a group or a numeric group identifier.

           If TTYGROUP is not defined, then the group ownership of the terminal is set to the user's primary
           group. If TTYPERM is not defined, then the permissions are set to <u>0600</u>.

           If you have a <b>write</b> program which is "setgid" to a special group which owns the terminals, define
           TTYGROUP to the group number and TTYPERM to 0620. Otherwise leave TTYGROUP commented out and assign
           TTYPERM to either 622 or 600.

       <b>TTYTYPE_FILE</b> (string)
           If defined, file which maps tty line to TERM environment parameter. Each line of the file is in a
           format something like "vt100 tty01".

       <b>UID_MAX</b> (number), <b>UID_MIN</b> (number)
           Range of user IDs used for the creation of regular users by <b>useradd</b> or <b>newusers</b>.

           The default value for <b>UID_MIN</b> (resp.  <b>UID_MAX</b>) is 1000 (resp. 60000).

       <b>UMASK</b> (number)
           The file mode creation mask is initialized to this value. If not specified, the mask will be
           initialized to 022.

           <b>useradd</b> and <b>newusers</b> use this mask to set the mode of the home directory they create if <b>HOME_MODE</b> is
           not set.

           It is also used by <b>pam_umask</b> as the default umask value.

       <b>USERDEL_CMD</b> (string)
           If defined, this command is run when removing a user. It should remove any at/cron/print jobs etc.
           owned by the user to be removed (passed as the first argument).

           The return code of the script is not taken into account.

           Here is an example script, which removes the user's cron, at and print jobs:

               #! <a href="file:/bin/sh">/bin/sh</a>

               # Check for the required argument.
               if [ $# != 1 ]; then
                    echo "Usage: $0 username"
                    exit 1
               fi

               # Remove cron jobs.
               crontab -r -u $1

               # Remove at jobs.
               # Note that it will remove any jobs owned by the same UID,
               # even if it was shared by a different username.
               AT_SPOOL_DIR=/var/spool/cron/atjobs
               find $AT_SPOOL_DIR -name "[^.]*" -type f -user $1 -delete \;

               # Remove print jobs.
               lprm $1

               # All done.
               exit 0

       <b>USERGROUPS_ENAB</b> (boolean)
           If set to <u>yes</u>, <b>userdel</b> will remove the user's group if it contains no more members, and <b>useradd</b> will
           create by default a group with the name of the user.

       <b>YESCRYPT_COST_FACTOR</b> (number)
           When <b>ENCRYPT_METHOD</b> is set to <u>YESCRYPT</u>, this defines the cost factor used by the encryption algorithm
           by default (when the cost factor is not specified on the command line).

           With a high cost factor, it is more difficult to brute force the password. But note also that more
           CPU resources will be needed to authenticate users.

           The value must be inside the 1-11 range.

           Note: This only affect the generation of group passwords. The generation of user passwords is done by
           PAM and subject to the PAM configuration. It is recommended to set this variable consistently with
           the PAM configuration.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Much of the functionality that used to be provided by the shadow password suite is now handled by PAM.
       Thus, <a href="file:/etc/login.defs">/etc/login.defs</a> is no longer used by <b><a href="../man1/passwd.1.html">passwd</a></b>(1), or less used by <b><a href="../man1/login.1.html">login</a></b>(1), and <b><a href="../man1/su.1.html">su</a></b>(1). Please refer
       to the corresponding PAM configuration files instead.
