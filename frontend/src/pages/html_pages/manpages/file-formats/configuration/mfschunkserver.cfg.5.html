</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mfschunkserver.cfg - main configuration file for <b>mfschunkserver</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The file <b>mfschunkserver.cfg</b> contains configuration of MooseFS chunkserver process.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       Syntax is:

       <u>OPTION</u> <b>=</b> <u>VALUE</u>

       Lines starting with <b>#</b> character are ignored as comments.

</pre><h4><b>STARTUP</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Changes in this section require process restart.

       <b>WORKING_USER</b>
              user to run daemon as

       <b>WORKING_GROUP</b>
              group to run daemon as; optional value - if empty then default user group will be used

       <b>SYSLOG_IDENT</b>
              name of process to place in syslog messages; default is mfschunkserver

       <b>LOCK_MEMORY</b>
              whether to perform mlockall() to avoid swapping out mfschunkserver process; default is 0, i.e. no

       <b>LIMIT_GLIBC_MALLOC_ARENAS</b>
              limit  malloc  arenas  to  given  value - prevents server from using huge amount of virtual memory
              (Linux only, default is 4)

       <b>DISABLE_OOM_KILLER</b>
              disable out of memory killer (Linux only, default is 1)

       <b>NICE_LEVEL</b>
              nice level to run daemon with; default is -19; note: process must be started as root  to  increase
              priority, if setting of priority fails, process retains the nice level it started with

       <b>FILE_UMASK</b>
              set default umask for group and others (user has always 0); default is 027 - block write for group
              and block all for others

       <b>DATA_PATH</b>
              where to store daemon lock file

       <b>ALLOW_STARTING_WITH_INVALID_DISKS</b>
              when  set  to  one  chunkserver  will  not  abort  start  even when incorrect entries are found in
              'mfshdd.cfg' file; default is 0 (do not start with invalid entries)

       <b>CAN_USE_MMAP</b>
              using mmap for allocation can slightly reduce ram usage and give a silight performance boost,  but
              on certain architectures/kernels can lead to problems - especially on architectures with more than
              one physical CPU; default is 0

</pre><h4><b>RUNTIME</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Changes in this section require only process reload.

       <b>HDD_CONF_FILENAME</b>
              alternate location/name of <b>mfshdd.cfg</b> file

       <b>HDD_TEST_SPEED</b>
              Speed of background chunk tests in MB/s per disk (formally entry defined in <b>mfshdd.cfg</b>). Value can
              be given as a decimal number; default is 1.0

       <b>HDD_MIN_TEST_INTERVAL</b>
              prevents  from  testing  chunk  integrity  when  last I/O (including test) was performed less than
              HDD_MIN_TEST_INTERVAL ago; default is 1 day; for value formatting see TIME

       <b>HDD_FADVISE_MIN_TIME</b>
              If possible use posix_fadvise(POSIX_DONTNEED)  after  each  chunk  test  (but  only  if  last  I/O
              operation  was  performed  more  than  HDD_FADVISE_MIN_TIME  ago).  Using zero will always perform
              posix_fadvise (flush cache) and using negative value will never  flush  cache  after  tests.  This
              setting  is  valid  only  for  systems  that  support  posix_fadivise; default is 1 day; for value
              formatting see TIME

       <b>HDD_LEAVE_SPACE_DEFAULT</b>
              how   much   space   should   be   left   unused   on   each   hard    drive;    number    format:
              [0-9]*(.[0-9]*)?([kMGTPE]|[KMGTPE]i)?B?  ; default is 256MiB; examples: 0.5GB, .5G, 2.56GiB, 1256M
              etc.

       <b>HDD_REBALANCE_UTILIZATION</b>
              percent of total work time the chunkserver is allowed to spend on hdd space  rebalancing;  default
              is 20

       <b>HDD_HIGH_SPEED_REBALANCE_LIMIT</b>
              maximum simultaneous writes per disk in high speed disk rebalance (0 means use standard rebalance;
              default is 0)

       <b>HDD_ERROR_TOLERANCE_COUNT</b>, <b>HDD_ERROR_TOLERANCE_PERIOD</b>
              how  many  i/o  errors  (COUNT)  to  tolerate in given amount of seconds (PERIOD) on a single hard
              drive; if the number of errors exceeds this setting, the offending hard drive will  be  marked  as
              damaged; defaults are 2 and 600

       <b>HDD_FSYNC_BEFORE_CLOSE</b>
              enables/disables fsync before chunk closing; default is 0 (off)

       <b>HDD_SPARSIFY_ON_WRITE</b>
              enables/disables  sparsification  (skip  leading  and  trailing  zeroz)  during writing new block;
              default is 1 (on)

       <b>HDD_RR_CHUNK_COUNT</b>
              how many chunks should be created in one directory before moving to the next  one;  higher  values
              are  better  with  most  OSes caching algorithms, low values lead to more even chunk distribution;
              default is 10000 which works best in most cases

       <b>HDD_KEEP_DUPLICATES_HOURS</b>
              how many hours duplicate chunks should be kept before deleting (default  is  one  week);  changing
              this value and reloading will reset the counter; for value formatting see TIME

       <b>WORKERS_MAX</b>, <b>WORKERS_MAX_IDLE</b>
              maximum number of active workers and maximum number of idle workers; defaults are 250 and 40

       <b>SYSLOG_MIN_LEVEL</b>
              minimum  level  of  messages  that will be reported by chunkserver; levels in order of importance:
              ERROR, WARNING, NOTICE, INFO, DEBUG (default is INFO)

       <b>SYSLOG_ELEVATE_TO</b>
              reported messages of level lower than set by this option will be elevated to this level  (i.e.  if
              <b>SYSLOG_MIN_LEVEL</b>  is  set  to  DEBUG  and  <b>SYSLOG_ELEVATE_TO</b>  is set to NOTICE, all INFO and DEBUG
              messages will be sent to syslog as NOTICE ; default is NOTICE)

</pre><h4><b>MASTER</b> <b>CONNECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Changes in this section require only process reload.

       <b>LABELS</b> labels string defined as a set of letters (case  insensitive)  separated  by  coma  or  semicolon;
              default is empty - no labels

       <b>BIND_HOST</b>
              local address to use for master connections; default is *, i.e. default local address

       <b>MASTER_HOST</b>
              MooseFS master host, IP is allowed only in single-master installations; default is mfsmaster

       <b>MASTER_PORT</b>
              MooseFS master command port; default is 9420

       <b>MASTER_CONTROL_PORT</b>
              (pro only) MooseFS master control port; default is 9419

       <b>MASTER_TIMEOUT</b>
              timeout  in seconds for master connections (if not 0); If this value is zero then chunkserver sets
              it initially to 10 and asks master for this value. default is 0 (ask master).

       <b>MASTER_RECONNECTION_DELAY</b>
              delay in seconds before trying to reconnect to master after disconnection (default is 5)

       <b>AUTH_CODE</b>
              authentication string (used only when master requires authorization)

       <b>CHUNKS_PER_REGISTER_PACKET</b>
              maximum number of chunks system will try to put in a single register  message  (default  is  1000,
              limits 100-10000)

</pre><h4><b>CLIENTS</b> <b>CONNECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Changes in this section require only process reload.

       <b>CSSERV_LISTEN_HOST</b>
              IP address to listen on for client (mount) connections (<b>*</b> means any)

       <b>CSSERV_LISTEN_PORT</b>
              port to listen on for client (mount) connections (default is 9422)

</pre><h4><b>TIME</b></h4><pre>
       For config variables that define time without requiring a single, specific unit, time can be defined as a
       number of seconds (integer) or a time period in one of two possible formats:

       first  format:  #.#T  where  T  is one of: s-seconds, m-minutes, h-hours, d-days or w-weeks; fractions of
       seconds will be rounded to full seconds

       second format: #w#d#h#m#s, any number of definitions can be ommited, but the remaining  definitions  must
       be  in order (so #d#m is still a valid definition, but #m#d is not); ranges: s,m: 0 to 59, h: 0 to 23, d:
       0 t o 6, w is unlimited and the first definition is also always unlimited (i.e.  for  #d#h#m  d  will  be
       unlimited)

       Notice! For variable <b>HDD_KEEP_DUPLICATES_HOURS</b> only h,d and w time units are accepted and a value without
       a time unit is treated as hours; fractions are rounded to full hours.

       Examples:

       1.5h is the same as 1h30m, is the same as 90m, is the same as 5400s, is the same as 5400

       2.5d  is  the  same  as  2d12h,  is the same as 60h; 1d36h is not a valid time period (h is not the first
       definition, so it is bound by range 0 to 23)

       1.03m is the same as 62s (61.8 seconds will be rounded up to 62)
