</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       detoxrc — configuration file for <u><a href="../man1/detox.1.html">detox</a></u>(1)

</pre><h4><b>OVERVIEW</b></h4><pre>
       detox  allows for configuration of its sequences through config files.  This document describes how these
       files work.

</pre><h4><b>IMPORTANT</b></h4><pre>
       When setting up a new set of rules, the <b>safe</b> and <b>wipeup</b> filters must always be run  after  a  translating
       filter  (or  series thereof), such as the <b>utf_8</b> or the <b>uncgi</b> filters.  Otherwise, the risk of introducing
       illegal characters into the filename is introduced.

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       The format of this configuration file is C-like.  It is based loosely off  named's  configuration  files.
       Each  statement  is semicolon terminated, and modifiers on a particular statement are generally contained
       within braces.

       <b>sequence</b> "<u>name</u>" {<u>...</u>};
           Defines a sequence of filters to run a filename through.  "name" specifies how the user will refer to
           the particular sequence during runtime.  Quotes around the sequence name are generally optional,  but
           should be used if the sequence name does not start with a letter.

           There  is a special sequence, named "default", which is the default sequence used by detox.  This can
           be overridden through the command line option <b>-s</b> or the environmental variable DETOX_SEQUENCE.

           Sequence names are case sensitive and unique throughout all sequences; that is, if a system wide file
           defines <u>normal_seq</u> and a user has a sequence with  the  same  name  in  their  <u>.detoxrc</u>,  the  users'
           <u>normal_seq</u> will take precedence.

       <b>iso8859_1</b> {<b>filename</b> "<u>/path/to/filename</u>";};
           This  translates ISO 8859-1 (aka Latin-1) characters into lower ASCII equivalents.  The output is not
           necessarily safe, and should also be run through the <b>safe</b> filter.

           Under normal circumstances, the filename syntax is not needed.  Detox looks in several locations  for
           a  file  called <u>iso8859_1.tbl</u>, which is a set of rules defining how an ISO 8859-1 character should be
           translated.

           In the event this table doesn't exist, you have two options.  You can download or  create  your  own,
           and  tell  detox  the location of it using the filename syntax shown above, or you can let detox fall
           back on its internal tables.  The internal tables translate the same as the stock translation tables.

           You can chain together multiple iso8859_1 translations, as long as the default value of all  but  the
           last one is set to nothing.  This is explained in <u><a href="../man5/detox.tbl.5.html">detox.tbl</a></u>(5).

           This filter is mutually exclusive with the <b>utf_8</b> filter.

       <b>utf_8</b> {<b>filename</b> "<u>/path/to/filename</u>";};
           This translates Unicode characters, encoded by the UTF-8 translation method, into safe equivalents.

           This  operates  in  a  manner  similar  to  <b>iso8859_1</b>, except it looks for a translation table called
           <u>unicode.tbl</u>.

           The default internal translation for Unicode characters only contains the  lower  256  characters  of
           Unicode, which is equivalent to the set of Basic Latin and Latin-1 characters.

       <b>uncgi</b>;
           This  translates  CGI  escaped  strings  into  their  ASCII  equivalents.  The  output of this is not
           necessarily safe, and could contain ISO 8859-1 chars or potentially UTF-8 characters.

       <b>safe</b> {<b>filename</b> "<u>/path/to/filename</u>";};
           This could also be called "safe for UNIX-like operating systems".  It translates characters that  are
           difficult to work with in UNIX environments into characters that are not.

           In  earlier  versions  this  filter  was  entirely  internal.   Starting  with  1.2.0, this filter is
           controlled by a translation table.  In the absence of the translation table, the previous  code  will
           be  employed  for  the  translation.  Also, prior to 1.2.0, the safe filter removed leading dashes to
           prevent the hassle of dealing with a  filename  in  the  format  <u>-filename</u>.   This  functionality  is
           exclusively handled by the <b>wipeup</b> filter now.

           See the “SAFE” section for more details on what this filter translates by default.

       <b>wipeup</b> {<b>remove_trailing</b>;};
           This  wipes  up  any  excessive  characters.   For  instance,  multiple underscores or dashes will be
           converted into a single underscore or dash.  Any series of dash and underscore (i.e. "_-_")  will  be
           converted into a single dash.

           The remove trailing option removes a dash or underscore followed immediately by a period.

           See the “WIPEUP” section for more details on what this filter translates.

       <b>max_length</b> {<b>length</b> <u>value</u>;};
           This trims a file down to the length specified (or less).  It is conscious of extensions and attempts
           to preserve anything following the last period in a filename.

           For  instance,  given  a  max length of 12, and a filename of "this_is_my_file.txt", the filter would
           output "this_is_.txt".

       <b>lower</b>;
           This translates uppercase characters into lowercase characters.

       <b>#</b> <b>Comments</b>
           Any thing after a # on any line is ignored.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       sequence default {
         uncgi;
         iso8859_1 {
           filename "iso8859_1.tbl";
         };
       # utf_8 {
       #   filename "unicode.tbl";
       # };
         safe {
           filename "safe.tbl";
         };
         wipeup {
           remove_trailing;
         };
       # max_length {
       #   length 128;
       # };
       };

</pre><h4><b>SAFE</b></h4><pre>
       The following characters are translated by the stock <b>safe</b> filter.  They can be tuned by updating safe.tbl
       or creating a copy of safe.tbl and updating your rc file.

   <b>Rules</b> <b>that</b> <b>apply</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>filename:</b>
             <b>Safe</b>       <b>Original</b>
             _and_      &amp;
             _          <u>space</u> ` ! @ $ * \ | : ; " ' &lt; &gt; ? /
             -          ( ) [ ] { }

</pre><h4><b>WIPEUP</b></h4><pre>
       The following characters are translated by the <b>wipeup</b> filter.

   <b>Rules</b> <b>that</b> <b>apply</b> <b>anywhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>filename:</b>
             <b>Wipeup</b>    <b>Original</b>
             -         -_
             -         _-
             -         --
             _         __

   <b>Rules</b> <b>that</b> <b>apply</b> <b>only</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>filename:</b>
       Any leading dashes are stripped to prevent  programs  from  interpreting  these  files  as  command  line
       options.

             <b>Wipeup</b>     <b>Original</b>
             <u>removed</u>    - _ #

   <b>Rules</b> <b>that</b> <b>apply</b> <b>when</b> <b>remove</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>is</b> <b>enabled:</b>
             <b>Wipeup</b>    <b>Original</b>
             .         .-
             .         -.
             .         ._
             .         _.
