</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pdfpcrc - pdfpc configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b><a href="../man1/pdfpc.1.html">pdfpc</a></b>(1) first reads its system-wide configuration file, followed by the user-specific one if it exists.

   <b>Keybindings</b>
       The following commands are accepted:

       <b>bind</b> <b>&lt;key&gt;</b> <b>&lt;action&gt;</b> <b>[&lt;arg&gt;]</b>
              Bind a key to an action, passing a specified argument for actions that require one

       <b>unbind</b> <b>&lt;key&gt;</b>
              Unbind the given key

       <b>unbind_all</b>
              Clear all the key bindings

       <b>mouse</b> <b>&lt;button&gt;</b> <b>&lt;action&gt;</b>
              Bind a mouse button to an action

       <b>unmouse</b> <b>&lt;button&gt;</b>
              Unbind a mouse button

       <b>unmouse_all</b>
              Clear all the mouse bindings

       Key  names  can  be obtained with the help of the <b><a href="../man1/xev.1.html">xev</a></b>(1) utility. Note that names are case sensitive. Key
       combinations with modifiers can be specified in the form &lt;mod&gt;+&lt;key&gt;,  where  &lt;mod&gt;  is  one  of  S  (for
       shift), C (for control) and A/M (for Alt/Meta).

       A  shorthand  for specifying key combinations constituting shift and an alphabetic character is to simply
       give the uppercase version of the alphabetic character. For example, S+r and R are equivalent.

       A list of all possible actions can be obtained via the <b>-L</b> command line option of  <b><a href="../man1/pdfpc.1.html">pdfpc</a></b>(1).  Use  the  <b>-B</b>
       command line option to list the action bindings defined.

   <b>Options</b>
       Some permanent changes can be configured via the config file. The syntax is:

       <b>option</b> <b>&lt;option_name&gt;</b> <b>&lt;option_value&gt;</b>

       The following option_name's are recognized:

       <b>black-on-end</b>
              Add an additional black slide at the end of the presentation (bool, Default is false).

       <b>cache-clean-period</b>
              Period (in units of s) to check for expired cached content (int, Default is 60).

       <b>cache-expiration</b>
              Time  (in  units  of  s) to keep (pre)rendered slides in the cache (int, Default is 600). Set to a
              negative value to keep cached slides permanently.

       <b>cache-max-rtime</b>
              Maximal time (in units of ms) it takes to render a slide  for  its  cache  to  be  protected  from
              expiration (int, Default is 1000).

       <b>cache-min-rtime</b>
              Minimal time (in units of ms) it takes to render a slide for it to be cached (int, Default is 10).

       <b>cache-max-usize</b>
              Maximal size (in units of kB) of a slide image to store it uncompressed in the cache (int, Default
              is 256).

       <b>current-height</b>
              Percentage  of  the  height  of  the  "main" presenter area to be used for the current slide (int,
              Default is 80).

       <b>current-size</b>
              Percentage of the width of the presenter screen to be used for the current slide (int, Default  is
              60).

       <b>cursor-timeout</b>
              Mouse inactivity timeout (in units of s) after which the cursor gets hidden (int, Default is 2).

       <b>disable-input-autodetection</b>
              Do not automatically detect type (pen or eraser) of tablet input devices (bool, Default is false).

       <b>disable-input-pressure</b>
              Ignore  pressure  sensitivity of tablet input devices (pen or eraser) even when it is supported by
              the hardware (bool, Default is false).

       <b>disable-scrolling</b>
              Disable scrolling events on the presenter window (bool, Default is false).

       <b>disable-tooltips</b>
              Disable tooltips for the toolbox (bool, Default is false).

       <b>enable-auto-srt-load</b>
              Try loading video subtitle files automatically. For each video media, pdfpc will append ".srt"  to
              the  media  URI  and attempt to load a subtitle file (in the SRT format) from that location (bool,
              Default is false).

       <b>final-slide</b>
              Show the final slide of an overlay group instead of the next slide. If the user reaches  the  last
              slide of the overlay group the next slide will be shown again.

       <b>move-on-mapped</b>
              Dual-monitor  full-screen window placement is a tricky business. Some window managers (e.g., FVWM)
              ignore the placement if made before the window is shown. This option enables a  workaround  (bool,
              Default is false).

       <b>next-height</b>
              Percentage  of the height of the "main" presenter area to be used for the next slide (int, Default
              is 70).

       <b>next-slide-first-overlay</b>
              If the next slide is an overlay group, show the first slide of that group in the next  slide  view
              instead of the last slide of that group (bool, Default is false).

       <b>overview-min-size</b>
              Minimum width for the overview miniatures, in pixels (int, Default is 150).

       <b>pointer-color</b>
              Set the pointer color. Can be a literal color name or a #rrggbb representation (default is red).

       <b>pointer-opacity</b>
              Set the pointer opacity in percent (int, default is 50).

       <b>pointer-size</b>

       <b>prerender-delay</b>
              Delay (in seconds) to launch the pre-rendering process after a slide change (int, default is 4).

       <b>prerender-slides</b>
              Number  of  slides ahead of the current one to pre-render (int, default is 2). Set to 0 to disable
              the pre-rendering; set to a negative number to pre-render all at once.

       <b>presentation-interactive</b>
              Let the presentation window react to user actions, similar to  the  presenter  (bool,  default  is
              false).  Note  that  if  the presentation window is the only pdfpc GUI (i.e., if run with <b>-sS</b>), it
              will be interactive irrespective of this flag.

       <b>presentation-screen</b>
              Screen to be used for the presentation (output name, see e.g. "xrandr --listmonitors").

       <b>presenter-screen</b>

       <b>rest-passwd</b>
              Password to authenticate against the REST server (string, if not set, a randomly generated one  is
              used).

       <b>rest-static-root</b>
              Root  path  to  serve  static  HTML content. If begins with "/", it is interpreted as the absolute
              path; otherwise, relative to /usr/share/pdfpc (string, Default is "www").

       <b>spotlight-opacity</b>
              Set opacity of the area outside of the spotlight, in percent (int, default is 50).

       <b>spotlight-size</b>

       <b>status-height</b>
              Percentage of the height of the presenter screen  left  for  the  status  area  (timer,  progress,
              icons), leaving (100 - status_height)% for the "main" area (int, Default is 10).

       <b>switch-screens</b>

              bottom, or botton-to-top, respectively (Default is LtoR).

       <b>toolbox-minimized</b>
              Set the initial toolbox state minimized (bool, Default is false).
