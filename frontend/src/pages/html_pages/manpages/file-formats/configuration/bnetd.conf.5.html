</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       bnetd.conf - configuration for the Unix Battle.net daemon

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  file  <u>bnetd.conf</u>  contains information used by the Unix Battle.net daemon <b><a href="../man1/bnetd.1.html">bnetd</a></b>(1) to obtain system-
       specific information such as file locations and policies.

       The file consists of a list of configuration entries and comments.  A comment starts  with  a  pound  (#)
       sign  and  continues  to the end of the line.  Blank lines and whitespace are ignored between entries.  A
       configuration entry is composed of two fields separated by an equals (=) sign:

              <u>directive</u> = <u>value</u>

       The <u>directive</u> field contains the name of the configuration item you want to set to the  value  of  <u>value</u>.
       If  the  value contains spaces it should be surrounded by quotation marks (").  The value may not contain
       quotation marks.  Multiple entries are not allowed on a single line.

       If the field is Boolean, any of <b>true</b>, <b>false</b>, <b>yes</b>, <b>no</b>, <b>1</b>, or <b>0</b> may be used.  If the field is  numeric,  it
       must  be in base ten.  If the field is an address list, it must be delimited by commas.  Each element may
       contain a hostname (or IP) and a port number.  If a port number is given, it must be preceded by a  colon
       (:).   A  colon  by  itself  may  be  used  to represent the wildcard address.  If the field is a file or
       directory path, use of an absolute pathname is  recommended.   The  values  for  <b>iconfile</b>,  <b>tosfile</b>,  and
       <b>mpqauthfile</b> are not pathnames but just the names of the files.  They must be in the <b>filedir</b> directory.

       Recognized values for <u>directive</u> include:

              <b>filedir</b>   Specifies the path where downloadable files are stored.  These files are include the TOS

              <b>mpqauthfile</b>
                        Specify the name of the MPQ authorization file which  must  be  inside  of  the  <b>filedir</b>
                        directory.   This  file  is  used to determine the current client version.  This is only
                        needed if <b>allow_autoupdate</b> is turned on.  (Normally "IX86ver1.mpq")

              <b>usersync</b>  Specify the time in seconds between account file saves.  A value  of  0  means  to  wait

              <b>latency</b>   How often to send user latency tests to the user, in seconds.  These are used to  decide
                        how many "lag bars" to print next to users in channels.

              <b>shutdown_delay</b>
                        Specify the amount of time in seconds to delay shutting down the server when it receives

              <b>shutdown_decr</b>
                        You  can decrease the amount of time to wait by this value by sending another SIGTERM or

              <b>newaccounts</b>

                        If  this  value  is  true  then a second login by the same user will kick off the first,

              <b>hide_temp_channels</b>
                        If this value is true, private channels will not be shown in the channel list just  like

              <b>disc_is_loss</b>
                        If this value is true then any disconnect will be treated as a loss (regardless  of  the

              <b>enable_conn_all</b>
                        If  this  value  is  true  then  all  users  may use the /con and /connections commands.
                        Otherwise only administrators may use them.

              <b>hide_addr</b> If this value is true then IP addresses will be hidden from non-admins in the output  of
                        the /con, /games, /gameinfo, and /netinfo commands.

              <b>chanlog</b>   If  this  value  is true then private channels will be logged to files in the <b>chanlogdir</b>
                        direcotry.  The logging of public (permanent) channels is controlled in the  <b>channelfile</b>
                        file.

              <b>track</b>     Set this value to 0 to disable sending updates to the tracking server.  Any other number
                        will  set  the number of seconds between tracking packets.  Try to use a number above 60
                        seconds unless you know the tracking server administrator doesn't mind being spammed.

              <b>trackaddrs</b>
                        Specify a comma-delimited list of addresses of tracking servers to send updates to.  The
                        address for the master server is "track.bnetd.org".  A port may  be  specified  after  a
                        colon  numerically or by name from <b><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></b>(5).  If a port number is not specified,
                        it defaults to 6114.

              <b>location</b>  Give a description of the physical location of the server such as "San Diego, CA,  USA".
                        This is reported to the tracking server.

              <b>description</b>
                        Give  a  description of title or role of the server such as "Joe's Spiffy Server".  This

                        "<a href="http://www.foo.com/joeserv.html">http://www.foo.com/joeserv.html</a>".  This is reported to the tracking server.

              <b>contact_name</b>
                        Give  the  name of the contact for the server such as "Joe Blockhead".  This is reported

              <b>contact_email</b>
                        Give the email address of the contact for the server such  as  "<a href="mailto:joe@foo.com">joe@foo.com</a>".   This  is
                        reported to the tracking server.

              <b>use_keepalive</b>
                        If  this  value is set to true, the server will enable the TCP keepalive option to allow
                        the system to detect stale connections.

              <b>servaddrs</b> Specify the comma-delimited list of addresses the server should listen on.  A  port  may
                        be  specified  after  a  colon  numerically or by name from <b><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></b>(5).  If a port
                        number is not specified, it defaults to 6112.

              <b>udptest_port</b>
                        The UDP port number which is assumed for clients if they don't send SESSIONADDR packets.
                        If it is set to zero, the server will use the remote TCP port number as the default  UDP
                        port number.
