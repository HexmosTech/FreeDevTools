</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       radiusd.conf - configuration file for the FreeRADIUS server

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>radiusd.conf</b>  file  resides  in  the  radius database directory, by default <b>/etc/freeradius/3.0</b>.  It
       defines the global configuration for the FreeRADIUS RADIUS server.

</pre><h4><b>CONTENTS</b></h4><pre>
       There are a large number of configuration parameters for the server.  Most are  documented  in  the  file
       itself  as comments.  This page documents only the format of the file.  Please read the <b>radiusd.conf</b> file
       itself for more information.

       The configuration file parser is independent of the server configuration.  This means that  you  can  put
       almost anything into the configuration file.  So long as it is properly formatted, the server will start.

       When  the  server  parses  the configuration file, it looks only for those configurations it understands.
       Extra configuration items are ignored.  This "feature" can be (ab)used in certain interesting ways.

</pre><h4><b>FILE</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       The file format is line-based, like many other Unix configuration files.  Each entry in the file must  be
       placed on a line by itself, although continuations are supported.

       The file consists of configuration items (variable = value pairs), sections, and comments.

       Variables
              Variables can be set via:

                   name = value

              Single and double-quoted strings are permitted:

                   string1 = "hello world"
                   string2 = 'hello mom'

       Sections
              A  section  begins with a section name, followed on the same line by an open bracket '<b>{</b>'.  Section
              may contain other sections, comments, or variables.  Sections may be nested to any depth,  limited
              only by available memory.  A section ends with a close bracket Â´<b>}</b>', on a line by itself.

                   section {
                        ...
                   }

              Sections  can  sometimes have a second name following the first one.  The situations where this is
              legal depend on the context.  See the examples and comments in  the  <b>radiusd.conf</b>  file  for  more
              information.

                   section foo {
                        ...
                   }

       Comments
              Any  line  beginning  with  a  (<b>#</b>) is deemed to be a comment, and is ignored.  Comments can appear
              after a variable or section definitions.

                   # comment
                   foo = bar # set variable 'foo' to value 'bar'
                   section { # start of section
                   ...
                   }         # end of section

       Continuations
              Long lines can be broken up via continuations, using '\' as the last character of the  line.   For
              example, the following entry:

                   foo = "blah \
                   blah \
                   blah"

              will  set  the value of the variable "foo" to "blah blah blah".  Any CR or LF is not turned into a
              space, but all other whitespace is preserved in the final value.

</pre><h4><b>REFERENCES</b></h4><pre>
       The value of a variable can  reference  another  variable.   These  references  are  evaluated  when  the
       configuration  file  is  loaded,  which  means that there is no run-time cost associated with them.  This
       feature is most useful for turning long, repeated pieces of text into short ones.

       Variables are referenced by ${variable_name}, as in the following examples.

            foo = bar       # set variable 'foo' to value 'bar'
            who = ${foo}    # sets variable 'who' to value of variable 'foo'
            my = "${foo} a" # sets variable 'my' to "bar a"

       If   the   variable   exists   in   a   section   or   subsection,    it    can    be    referenced    as
       ${section.subsection.variable}.  Forward references are not allowed.  Relative references are allowed, by
       pre-pending the name with one or more period.

            blogs = ${.foo}

       Will set variable <b>blogs</b> to the value of variable <b>foo</b>, from the current section.

            blogs = ${..foo}

       Will  set  variable  <b>blogs</b>  to  the  value  of  variable <b>foo</b>, from the section which contains the current
       section.

            blogs = ${modules.detail.filename}

       Will set variable <b>blogs</b> to the value of variable <b>filename</b>, of the <b>detail</b> module, which is in the  <b>modules</b>
       section of the configuration file.

       Properties  of  anonymous  parent  sections  may  also  be  referenced,  currently  <b>name</b> and <b>instance</b> are
       supported.

            modules {           example foo {                file = ${.:name}           }      }       Will  set
       variable <b>file</b> to the name of the containing section (example).

            modules  {           example foo {                file = ${.:instance}           }      }       Will
       set variable <b>file</b> to the instance name of the containing section (foo).

            modules {           example foo {                file = ${..:name}           }      }       Will set
       variable <b>file</b> to the name of the parent of the containing section (modules).
