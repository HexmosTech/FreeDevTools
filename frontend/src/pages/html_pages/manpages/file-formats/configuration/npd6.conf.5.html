</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       npd6.conf - configuration file for neighbor proxy daemon ipv6 npd6

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This  file  contains  parameters which affect the manner of npd6's operation. The first section contain a
       few common parameters - you will need to change these to suit your situation. The  second  set  are  less
       likely  to  require  changing and will typically work fine at their default value. In fact: if you change
       the second set and get it wrong, npd6 may work badly, intermittently or not  at  all.  Leave  them  alone
       unless you have a real reason to change them!

       All  these  parameters  can  be dauting. Fear not! Probably 95% of the folks who use npd6 have received a
       64-bit prefix from their ISP and want to have their box answer neighbor solicitations for the prefix  on,
       maybe,  interface  eth0. And that's all they want. So read a bit of General Parameters below and set your
       one prefix and one interface and happily leave everything else alone... It'll work great for you.

   <b>General</b> <b>parameters</b>
       <b>prefix</b> <b>=</b> prefix[/mask]
              This defines the prefix which will be matched against received  Neighbor  Solicitations.  It  will
              often be a /64 supplied by an ISP, but this is by no means mandatory.

              Note that leading zeros are not required, but can be used. So
                     <b>prefix=2a01:0123:0456:0007:</b>
              is equivalent to
                     <b>prefix=2a01:123:456:7:</b>

              The prefix does require a terminating colon, e.g.
                     <b>prefix=2a01:123:456:7:</b>

              The  <b>/mask</b>  value  is optional, and often not required. In many cases where npd6 is used, the user
              will have received a 64-bit prefix from their ISP. Simply add this as the prefix here  and  you'll
              be good to go!

              If  the  /mask  value  is <b>not</b> supplied, but the prefix given is <b>not</b> a 64-bit one, then an implicit
              mask is used of <b>the</b> <b>prefix's</b> <b>length</b> <b>rounded</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>16-bit</b> <b>boundary.</b>  e.g.
                     <b>prefix</b> <b>=</b> <b>2000:11:22:33:8000::</b>
              is implicitly euivalent to
                     <b>prefix</b> <b>=</b> <b>2000:11:22:33:8000::/80</b>

              If a /mask value is used, then it operates in  the  traditional  (although  maybe  unintuitive  to
              some!) maner of an IP mask. For example:
                     <b>prefix</b> <b>=</b> <b>2000:11:22:33::/65</b>
              would match <b>2000:11:22:33::0</b> thru <b>2000:11:22:33:7fff:ffff:ffff:ffff</b>

              Whereas
                     <b>prefix</b> <b>=</b> <b>2000:11:22:33:8000::/65</b>
              would match <b>2000:11:22:33:8000::0</b> thru <b>2000:11:22:33:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff</b>

              If  you  understand masks, then they are there and available. If you do not understand masks, just
              ignore this.

              Finally: a useful shorthand to match any address within a NS on the designated interface is
                     <b>prefix=0::/0</b>
              However its use would be unusual and could lead to some  unforseen  consequences  if  not  thought
              through. Use with care.

       <b>interface</b> <b>=</b> [interfacename]
              This  defines the interface to which we will bind and listen. Note also that this is the interface
              which will, by default (see below), have the multicast flag enabled if required too.

              It will typically be one of the ethernet interfaces, e.g.
                     <b>interface=eth0</b>

       Note that there is no static limit to how many interface/prefix pairs that can  be  specified.  Also  not
       fixed  is  how  multiple pairs are configured: you can choose to list the interfaces first, followed by a
       list of prefixes. Or alternatively to pair them up in the config file instead. Note  however  that  there
       must  be an equal number of prefixes as interfaces. Every interface must have a prefix defined for it (if
       only a wildcard)

   <b>Address</b> <b>blacklisting</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>whitelisting</b>
       <b>listtype</b> <b>=</b> [none|black|white]
              This defines the type of "listing" (if any) to be performed: whitelisting, blacklisting or none at
              all. What is "listing"? In general, a whitelist ONLY allows items pre-configured on the list to be
              permitted. A blacklist allows anything EXCEPT those items pre-configured on the list.

              If <b>black</b> or <b>white</b> is specified then you should also then define at least 1 (and as  many  more  as
              you require) <b>addrlist</b> and/or <b>exprlist</b> items.

              Note also that this config item must be before the <b>addrlist</b> or <b>exprlist</b> items in the config file.

       <b>addrlist</b>= &lt;ipv6 address&gt;

              e.g.  <b>addrlist</b> <b>=</b> <b>2a01:0123:456:7::22</b> (All the usual formats are supported.)

              Defines the list of addresses to be either white- or black-listed.

       <b>exprlist</b> <b>=</b> <b>&lt;expression</b> <b>to</b> <b>match&gt;</b>

              e.g.  <b>exprlist</b> <b>=</b> <b>(HOST);SEAN=(HOST&amp;0xffff);((SEAN&gt;0x99)&amp;&amp;(SEAN&lt;0x124))</b>

              This  example  will (if black listing) refuse any NS that is for PREFIX::100 up to PREFIX::123. It
              any other PREFIX:: value will match. Or if whitelisting, will only allow value in those ranges.

       <b>listlogging</b> <b>=</b> [off|on]
              If <b>on</b> addresses which match a white/blacklist will be logged (even if debug is  not  enabled).  If
              <b>off</b> matches will not be logged (unless debug is in use, when they will be logged regardless)

              Default: off

       <b>List-type</b> <b>precedence</b>

       Note that <b>exprlist</b> values take precedence over <b>addrlist</b> values (if both are specified)

       <b>Behaviour</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>black-</b> <b>or</b> <b>whitelisting</b>

       This  is  the default mode of operation and likely what most people will want. In this mode (the original
       mode before this feature was introduced) any Neighbor Solicitation received with a target  address  which
       matches  the prefix will be answered by an appropriate Neighbor Advertisement, irrespective of whether or
       not that target actually exists and/or is reachable from here.

       <b>Behaviour</b> <b>with</b> <b>blacklisting</b>

       This mode of operation modifies how npd6 behaves: when a Neighbor Solicitation is received with a  prefix
       which  matches  that  configured,  before  a  Neighbor  Advertisement is generated in reply the target is
       additionally checked against the list of addresses defined. If it matches one of those addresses then the
       Neighbor Solicitation is silently ignored and no response generated.

       <b>Behaviour</b> <b>with</b> <b>whitelisting</b>

       This mode of operation modifies how npd6 behaves: when a Neighbor Solicitation is received with a  prefix
       which  matches  that  configured,  before  a  Neighbor  Advertisement is generated in reply the target is
       additionally checked against the list of addresses defined. Only if it matches one of those addresses  is
       a Neighbor Solicitation is generated in response.

   <b>Special</b> <b>parameters</b>
       <b>collectTargets</b> <b>=</b> amount
              Optionally,  npd6 can record a list of targets received in the incoming Neighbor Solicitations, to
              which it has replied. These can be displayed in the defined log by sending  a  USR2  signal  npd6.
              e.g. kill -USR2 &lt;pid of npd6&gt;

              This parameter defines a limit to the number of addresses recorded. If the value is zero, then the
              feature  is  disabled.  This  is  the default behaviour. The parameter should be set to a suitably
              large but sane value. The only significant overhead is memory (for storing  the  addresses)  Given
              the address space of IPv6 and the possibility of receiving very many different target addresses to
              not  provide a ceiling to this feature would potentially open npd6 up to a denial-of-service based
              upon memory depletion.

              In a typical situation, where a network might expect to receive Neighbor Solicitations for several
              dozen devices, there's likely no harm in setting this to  100  or  1000.  Just  don't  set  it  at
              10,000,000  without  thinking  first.  Memory is only allocated as-required - if you do set a high
              limit, npd6 does not preallocate the memory, but only use it as and if required.

       <b>linkOption</b> <b>=</b>  <b>false|true</b>
              Normal RFC-compliant behaviour  requires  that  if  npd6  is  replying  to  a  multicast  Neighbor
              Solicitation  it  must include the Target Link-Layer option in any reply. However if replying to a
              unicast Neighbor Solicitation this option is not required. Hence it is normally  not  used  unless
              enabled here by changing the this to <b>true</b>

              Default: false

       <b>ignoreLocal</b> <b>=</b>  <b>false|true</b>
              If  npd6  receives  a Neighbor Solicitation for the global address of the interface to which it is
              bound, if set to <b>true</b> npd6 will ignore and not reply - this is since ordinarily  the  kernel  will
              itself automatically respond to such a situation.

              If  changed from the default and set to <b>false</b> then such Neighbor Solcitations will be responded to
              - possibly resulting in duplicated Neighbor Advertisements.

              Default: true

       <b>routerNA</b> <b>=</b>  <b>false|true</b>
              Normal RFC-compliant behaviour requires that outgoing Neighbor Advertisements have the ROUTER flag
              set in them. This will be done unless disabled by changing this to <b>false.</b>

              Default: true

       <b>maxHops</b> <b>=</b>  <b>[0-255]</b>
              Outgoing Neighbor Advertisements will normally have their maximum hop value set  to  255.  if  set
              incorrectly  no  anomaly  in  the  operation of npd6 will be seen - however Neghbor Advertisements
              generated by npd6 may be silently ignored by the receiving device.  Do  not  change  without  good
              reason!

              Default: 255

       <b>pollErrorLimit</b> <b>=</b>  <b>[0-255]</b>
              This is to cater for situations when an interface goes bad for a short time, but comes back in the
              end. e.g. bouncing an interface, or during boot-up when things might take a second or three longer
              than expected to be ready and available.

              Set to 0 to disable the mechanism completely.

              Given  the  nature of the underlying mechanisms, if an interface goes away and does not come back,
              this threshold strictly speaking is the minimum number of poll failures we will  wait  for  before
              permanently  failing.  However  practically  speaking, this value represents the minimum period in
              seconds which we will wait before taking this action. The maximum period is potentially twice this
              value.

              Note that if this value is set higher than 30, the mechanism may not operate as expected! This  is
              implementation dependent. Best left alone, to be honest... 20 is a sensible default value!

              Default: 20
