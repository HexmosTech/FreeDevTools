       torus-2QoS.conf - Torus-2QoS configuration for OpenSM subnet manager

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The file <b>torus-2QoS.conf</b> contains configuration information that is specific to the OpenSM routing engine
       torus-2QoS.   Blank lines and lines where the first non-whitespace character is "#" are ignored.  A token
       is any contiguous group of non-whitespace characters.  Any tokens on  a  line  following  the  recognized
       configuration tokens described below are ignored.

       [<b>torus</b>|<b>mesh</b>] <u>x_radix</u>[<b>m</b>|<b>M</b>|<b>t</b>|<b>T</b>] <u>y_radix</u>[<b>m</b>|<b>M</b>|<b>t</b>|<b>T</b>] <u>z_radix</u>[<b>m</b>|<b>M</b>|<b>t</b>|<b>T</b>]
              Either  <b>torus</b>  or  <b>mesh</b> must be the first keyword in the configuration, and sets the topology that
              torus-2QoS will try to construct.  A 2D topology can be configured by specifying one  of  <u>x_radix</u>,
              <u>y_radix</u>,  or  <u>z_radix</u>  as  1.   An  individual dimension can be configured as mesh (open) or torus
              (looped) by suffixing its radix specification with one of <b>m</b>, <b>M</b>, <b>t</b>, or <b>T</b>.  Thus, "mesh 3T 4 5"  and
              "torus 3 4M 5M" both specify the same topology.

              Note  that  although  torus-2QoS  can  route  mesh  fabrics,  its  ability  to route around failed
              components is severely compromised on such fabrics.  A failed fabric component is very  likely  to
              cause a disjoint ring; see <b>UNICAST</b> <b>ROUTING</b> in <a href="../man8/torus-2QoS.8.html">torus-2QoS</a>(8).

       <b>xp_link</b> <u>sw0_GUID</u> <u>sw1_GUID</u>
       <b>yp_link</b> <u>sw0_GUID</u> <u>sw1_GUID</u>
       <b>zp_link</b> <u>sw0_GUID</u> <u>sw1_GUID</u>
       <b>xm_link</b> <u>sw0_GUID</u> <u>sw1_GUID</u>
       <b>ym_link</b> <u>sw0_GUID</u> <u>sw1_GUID</u>
       <b>zm_link</b> <u>sw0_GUID</u> <u>sw1_GUID</u>
              These  keywords  are  used  to seed the torus/mesh topology.  For example, "xp_link 0x2000 0x2001"
              specifies that a link from the switch with node GUID 0x2000 to the switch with  node  GUID  0x2001
              would  point in the positive x direction, while "xm_link 0x2000 0x2001" specifies that a link from
              the switch with node GUID 0x2000 to the switch with node GUID 0x2001 would point in the negative x
              direction.  All the link keywords for a given seed must specify the same "from" switch.

              In general, it is not necessary to configure both the positive and negative directions for a given
              coordinate; either is sufficient.  However, the algorithm used for topology discovery needs  extra
              information  for  torus  dimensions  of radix four (see <b>TOPOLOGY</b> <b>DISCOVERY</b> in <a href="../man8/torus-2QoS.8.html">torus-2QoS</a>(8)).  For
              such cases both the positive and negative coordinate directions must be specified.

              Based on the topology specified via the <b>torus</b>/<b>mesh</b> keyword, torus-2QoS will detect and log when it
              has insufficient seed configuration.

       <b>x_dateline</b> <u>position</u>
       <b>y_dateline</b> <u>position</u>
       <b>z_dateline</b> <u>position</u>
              In order for torus-2QoS to provide the guarantee that path SL  values  do  not  change  under  any
              conditions  for which it can still route the fabric, its idea of dateline position must not change
              relative to physical switch locations.  The dateline keywords provide the means to configure  such
              behavior.

              The  dateline  for a torus dimension is always between the switch with coordinate 0 and the switch
              with coordinate radix-1 for that dimension.  By default, the common switch  in  a  torus  seed  is
              taken  as  the  origin  of  the  coordinate system used to describe switch location.  The <u>position</u>
              parameter for a dateline keyword moves the origin (and hence the dateline)  the  specified  amount
              relative to the common switch in a torus seed.

       <b>next_seed</b>
              If  any of the switches used to specify a seed were to fail torus-2QoS would be unable to complete
              topology discovery successfully.  The <b>next_seed</b> keyword specifies  that  the  following  link  and
              dateline keywords apply to a new seed specification.

              For  maximum  resiliency,  no  seed  specification  should  share  a  switch  with  any other seed
              specification.  Multiple seed specifications should use  dateline  configuration  to  ensure  that
              torus-2QoS  can  grant  path  SL  values  that  are constant, regardless of which seed was used to
              initiate topology discovery.

       <b>portgroup_max_ports</b> <u>max_ports</u>
              This keyword specifies the maximum number of parallel inter-switch links,  and  also  the  maximum
              number  of  host  ports  per  switch,  that  torus-2QoS can accommodate.  The default value is 16.
              Torus-2QoS will log an error message during topology discovery  if  this  parameter  needs  to  be
              increased.  If this keyword appears multiple times, the last instance prevails.

              Note  that  the  switch management port (switch port 0) gets put into the same port group with the
              host ports, so if you have 16 host ports per switch, portgroup_max_ports would need to be at least
              17.

       <b>port_order</b> <u>p1</u> <u>p2</u> <u>p3</u> <u>...</u>
              This keyword specifies the order in which CA ports  on  a  destination  switch  are  visited  when
              computing routes. When the fabric contains switches connected with multiple parallel links, routes
              are  distributed  in  a  round-robin  fashion across such links, and so changing the order that CA
              ports are visited changes the distribution of routes across such links.  This may be  advantageous
              for some specific traffic patterns.

              The default is to visit CA ports in increasing port order on destination switches.

              Duplicate values in the list will be ignored.

       <b>max_changes</b> <u>max</u>
              This keyword specifies the maximum number of torus changes reported.  The default value is 32.

       # Look for a 2D (since x radix is one) 4x5 torus.
       torus 1 4 5

       # y is radix-4 torus dimension, need both
       # ym_link and yp_link configuration.
       yp_link 0x200000 0x200005  # sw @ y=0,z=0 -&gt; sw @ y=1,z=0
       ym_link 0x200000 0x20000f  # sw @ y=0,z=0 -&gt; sw @ y=3,z=0

       # z is not radix-4 torus dimension, only need one of
       # zm_link or zp_link configuration.
       zp_link 0x200000 0x200001  # sw @ y=0,z=0 -&gt; sw @ y=0,z=1

       next_seed

       yp_link 0x20000b 0x200010  # sw @ y=2,z=1 -&gt; sw @ y=3,z=1
       ym_link 0x20000b 0x200006  # sw @ y=2,z=1 -&gt; sw @ y=1,z=1
       zp_link 0x20000b 0x20000c  # sw @ y=2,z=1 -&gt; sw @ y=2,z=2

       y_dateline -2  # Move the dateline for this seed
       z_dateline -1  # back to its original position.

       # If OpenSM failover is configured, for maximum resiliency
       # one instance should run on a host attached to a switch
       # from the first seed, and another instance should run
       # on a host attached to a switch from the second seed.
       # Both instances should use this torus-2QoS.conf to ensure
       # path SL values do not change in the event of SM failover.

       # port_order defines the order on which the ports would be
       # chosen for routing.
       port_order 7 10 8 11 9 12 25 28 26 29 27 30
