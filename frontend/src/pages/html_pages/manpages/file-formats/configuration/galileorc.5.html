</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       galileorc - configuration files for the galileo Fitbit synchronization utility

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>galileorc</b> file is used to provide default settings to the <b><a href="../man1/galileo.1.html">galileo</a></b>(1) utility. Any settings that would
       normally  be  passed  as command-line arguments to galileo can, instead, be present in this configuration
       file to prevent having to repeat them again and again.

       Settings provided in the configuration files can be overridden by  run-time  command-line  switches.  See
       <b><a href="../man1/galileo.1.html">galileo</a></b>(1)

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  files will be read if present. Later one override previous settings and settings provided
       on the command-line override settings defined in configuration files.

       •      <u>/etc/galileo/config</u>

       •      <u>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/galileo/config</u> (The <b>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b> environment variable default to <u><a href="file:~/.config">~/.config</a></u>  if
              not defined)

       •      <u><a href="file:~/.galileorc">~/.galileorc</a></u>

       •      any file specified with the <b>-c</b> command-line switch

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       The  settings file is defined in <u>YAML</u> format. Blank lines and comments (from the first hash character '#'
       to the end of the line) are ignored.

       The configuration file is parsed as a dictionary of settings, which means that each  setting  is  defined
       using  a  keyword  followed  by  a  colon  character. For single-value settings (the majority), the value
       follows the colon, for example:

       do-upload: true

       For settings of type <u>list</u> (such as the tracker ID inclusion and exclusion lists), the values appear  with
       an indentation on subsequent lines and prefixed with a dash, for example:

       include:
         - '123456789ABC'
         - '9876543210AB'

</pre><h4><b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  settings  can be added to the configuration files - not all options have to be specified;
       any that are not mentioned will leave the defaults in  effect.  See  <b><a href="../man1/galileo.1.html">galileo</a></b>(1)  for  details  about  the
       default values.

       <b>logging</b>
              controls the amount of progress output. Can be <b>verbose</b> to display progress during synchronization,
              <b>debug</b>  for  more  detailed  information useful for diagnosing problems, or <b>quiet</b> to display only a
              warning and error messages.

       <b>syslog</b> setting this to <b>true</b> will send all logging output to the syslog facility. Due to the rate-limiting
              of some syslog servers, this option might not work in combination with the debug log level.

       <b>include</b>
              the list of tracker IDs to synchronize. If this is specified then only  trackers  from  this  list
              will be synchronised.

       <b>exclude</b>
              the list of tracker IDs not to synchronize.

       <b>force-sync</b>
              setting this to <b>true</b> causes trackers to be synchronized even if they report that they already have
              been synchronized recently.

       <b>daemon-period</b>
              this  defines,  in  milliseconds,  the period at which a synchronisation attempt will be performed
              when galileo is run in <b>daemon</b> mode.

       <b>keep-dumps</b>
              setting this to <b>true</b> causes galileo to save the data retrieved  from  trackers  to  the  directory
              specified in <b>dump-dir</b>.

       <b>dump-dir</b>
              the directory used for saving tracker data if the <b>keep-dumps</b> option is set.

       <b>do-upload</b>
              setting this to <b>false</b> will prevent galileo from sending tracker data to the Fitbit web service.

       <b>fitbit-server</b>
              this  setting  allow  to  specify  the  name  of  the  server  to  connect  to when performing the
              synchronization.

       <b>https-only</b>
              setting this to <b>false</b> will allow galileo to fallback  to  unencrypted  HTTP  if  HTTPS  fails  for
              sending tracker data to the Fitbit web service.

       <b>hardcoded-ui</b>
              This  is  a structured section that includes the answers needed during the pairing/firmware update
              process.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       The following is an example configuration file:

       daemon-period: 60000
       keep-dumps: false
       do-upload: true
       dump-dir: <a href="file:~/.galileo-tracker-data">~/.galileo-tracker-data</a>
       logging: verbose
       force-sync: false
       https-only: false
       include:
         - '123456789ABC'
         - '9876543210AB'
       exclude:
         - 'AABBCCDDEEFF'
         - '881144BB1234'

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       Tracker IDs which consist of only numbers must be surrounded  with  single  quotes  (as  in  the  <u>EXAMPLE</u>
       section above). It's probably a good idea to always quote tracker IDs to avoid possible confusion.

       Please report additional bugs to &lt;<b>https://bitbucket.org/benallard/galileo/issues</b>&gt;.
