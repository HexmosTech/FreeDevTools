       sway - configuration file and commands

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       A  sway  configuration  file  is  a  list  of  sway commands that are executed by sway on startup.  These
       commands usually consist of setting your preferences and setting  key  bindings.  An  example  config  is
       likely present in /etc/sway/config for you to check out.

       Lines in the configuration file might be extended through multiple lines by adding a '\' character at the
       end of line. e.g.:

           bindsym Shift+XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec \
                pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ -1%

       Commands  can  also  be  given  as  a block in the form <b>command</b> <b>{</b> <b>&lt;subcommands...&gt;</b> <b>}</b>. Anything before the
       opening <b>{</b> will be prepended to the lines inside the block. For example:

           output eDP-1 {
                background <a href="file:~/wallpaper.png">~/wallpaper.png</a> fill
                resolution 1920x1080
           }

       is identical to

           output eDP-1 background <a href="file:~/wallpaper.png">~/wallpaper.png</a> fill
           output eDP-1 resolution 1920x1080

       These commands can be executed in your config file, via <b><a href="../man1/swaymsg.1.html">swaymsg</a></b>(1), or via the bindsym command.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>CONVENTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Commands are split into several arguments using spaces. You can enclose arguments  with  quotation  marks
       (<b>"..."</b>  or  <b>'...'</b>)  to  add  spaces  to  a single argument. You may also run several commands in order by
       separating each with <b>,</b> or <b>;</b>. Criteria is retained across commands separated by <b>,</b>, but will be reset  (and
       allow for new criteria, if desired) for commands separated by a <b>;</b>.

       Throughout  the  documentation,  <b>|</b> is used to distinguish between arguments for which you may only select
       one. <b>[...]</b> is used for optional arguments, and <b>&lt;...&gt;</b> for arguments where you are expected to supply  some
       value.

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       This section only lists general commands. For input and output commands, refer to <b><a href="../man5/sway-input.5.html">sway-input</a></b>(5) and <b><a href="../man5/swayoutput.5.html">sway-</a></b>
       <b><a href="../man5/swayoutput.5.html">output</a></b>(5).

   <b>Config</b> <b>only</b> <b>commands</b>
       The following commands may only be used in the configuration file.

       <b>bar</b> [&lt;bar-id&gt;] &lt;bar-subcommands...&gt;
           For details on bar subcommands, see <b><a href="../man5/sway-bar.5.html">sway-bar</a></b>(5).

       <b>default_orientation</b> horizontal|vertical|auto
           Sets the default container layout for tiled containers.

       <b>include</b> &lt;path&gt;
           Includes  another  file  from  <u>path</u>.  <u>path</u> can be either a full path or a path relative to the parent
           config, and expands shell syntax (see <b><a href="../man3/wordexp.3.html">wordexp</a></b>(3) for details). The same  include  file  can  only  be
           included once; subsequent attempts will be ignored.

       <b>swaybg_command</b> &lt;command&gt;
           Executes custom background <u>command</u>. Default is <u>swaybg</u>. Refer to <b><a href="../man5/sway-output.5.html">sway-output</a></b>(5) for more information.

           It can be disabled by setting the command to a single dash: <u>swaybg_command</u> <u>-</u>

       <b>swaynag_command</b> &lt;command&gt;
           Executes  custom command for <u>swaynag</u>. Default is <u>swaynag</u>. Additional arguments may be appended to the
           end. This should only be used to either direct sway to call swaynag from a custom path or to  provide
           additional arguments. This should be placed at the top of the config for the best results.

           It can be disabled by setting the command to a single dash: <u>swaynag_command</u> <u>-</u>

       <b>workspace_layout</b> default|stacking|tabbed
           Specifies the initial layout for new containers in an empty workspace.

       <b>xwayland</b> enable|disable|force
           Enables  or  disables  Xwayland support, which allows X11 applications to be used. <u>enable</u> will lazily
           load Xwayland so Xwayland will not be launched until the first client attempts to  connect.  In  some
           cases,  such  as  slower  machines, it may be desirable to have Xwayland started immediately by using
           <u>force</u> instead of <u>enable</u>.

   <b>Runtime</b> <b>only</b> <b>commands</b>
       The following commands cannot be used directly in the configuration file. They are expected  to  be  used
       with <b>bindsym</b> or at runtime through <b><a href="../man1/swaymsg.1.html">swaymsg</a></b>(1).

       <b>border</b> none|normal|csd|pixel [&lt;n&gt;]
           Set  border  style for focused window. <u>normal</u> includes a border of thickness <u>n</u> and a title bar. <u>pixel</u>
           is a border without title bar <u>n</u> pixels thick. The title  bar  always  shows  in  stacking  or  tabbed
           layouts.  <u>csd</u>  is  short  for  client-side-decorations,  which  allows  the  client  to  draw its own
           decorations. Default is <u>normal</u> with border thickness 2.

       <b>border</b> toggle
           Cycles through the available border styles.

       <b>exit</b>
           Exit sway and end your Wayland session.

       <b>floating</b> enable|disable|toggle
           Make focused view floating, non-floating, or the opposite of what it is now.

       &lt;criteria&gt; <b>focus</b>
           Moves focus to the container that matches the specified criteria.

       <b>focus</b> up|right|down|left
           Moves focus to the next container in the specified direction.

       <b>focus</b> prev|next [sibling]
           Moves focus to the previous or next container in the current layout.  By  default,  the  last  active
           child of the newly focused container will be focused. The <u>sibling</u> option indicates not to immediately
           focus a child of the container.

       <b>focus</b> child
           Moves focus to the last-focused child of the focused container.

       <b>focus</b> parent
           Moves focus to the parent of the focused container.

       <b>focus</b> output up|right|down|left
           Moves focus to the next output in the specified direction.

       <b>focus</b> output &lt;name&gt;
           Moves focus to the named output.

       <b>focus</b> tiling
           Sets focus to the last focused tiling container.

       <b>focus</b> floating
           Sets focus to the last focused floating container.

       <b>focus</b> mode_toggle
           Moves focus between the floating and tiled layers.

       <b>fullscreen</b> [enable|disable|toggle] [global]
           Makes  focused  view fullscreen, non-fullscreen, or the opposite of what it is now. If no argument is
           given, it does the same as <u>toggle</u>. If <u>global</u> is specified, the view will  be  fullscreen  across  all
           outputs.

       <b>gaps</b> inner|outer|horizontal|vertical|top|right|bottom|left all|current set|plus|minus|toggle &lt;amount&gt;
           Changes the <u>inner</u> or <u>outer</u> gaps for either <u>all</u> workspaces or the <u>current</u> workspace. <u>outer</u> gaps can be
           altered per side with <u>top</u>, <u>right</u>, <u>bottom</u>, and <u>left</u> or per direction with <u>horizontal</u> and <u>vertical</u>.

       <b>inhibit_idle</b> focus|fullscreen|open|none|visible
           Set/unset  an  idle  inhibitor  for the view. <u>focus</u> will inhibit idle when the view is focused by any
           seat. <u>fullscreen</u> will inhibit idle when the view is fullscreen  (or  a  descendant  of  a  fullscreen
           container)  and  is  visible.  <u>open</u>  will  inhibit idle until the view is closed (or the inhibitor is
           unset/changed). <u>visible</u> will inhibit idle when the view is visible on any output.  <u>none</u>  will  remove
           any existing idle inhibitor for the view.

           This can also be used with criteria to set an idle inhibitor for any existing view or with <u>for_window</u>
           to set idle inhibitors for future views.

       <b>layout</b> default|splith|splitv|stacking|tabbed
           Sets the layout mode of the focused container.

           When  using  the  <u>stacking</u>  layout,  only  the focused window in the container is displayed, with the
           opened windows' list on the top of the container.

           The <u>tabbed</u> layout is similar to <u>stacking</u>, but the windows’ list is vertically split.

       <b>layout</b> toggle [split|all]
           Cycles the layout mode of the focused container though a preset list of layouts. If  no  argument  is
           given,  then it cycles through stacking, tabbed and the last split layout. If <u>split</u> is given, then it
           cycles through splith and splitv. If <u>all</u> is given, then it cycles through every layout.

       <b>layout</b> toggle [split|tabbed|stacking|splitv|splith] [split|tabbed|stacking|splitv|splith]...
           Cycles the layout mode of the focused container through a list of layouts.

       <b>max_render_time</b> off|&lt;msec&gt;
           Controls when the relevant application is told to  render  this  window,  as  a  positive  number  of
           milliseconds  before  the  next  time  sway  composites the output. A smaller number leads to fresher
           rendered frames being composited by sway and lower perceived input latency, but if set too  low,  the
           application may not finish rendering before sway composites the output, leading to delayed frames.

           When  set  to  off,  the relevant application is told to render this window immediately after display
           refresh. How much time is left for rendering before sway composites the output at that point  depends
           on the output <b>max_render_time</b> setting.

           To set this up for optimal latency:
           1.  Set up <b>output</b> <b>max_render_time</b> (see <b><a href="../man5/sway-output.5.html">sway-output</a></b>(5)).
           2.  Put the target application in <u>full-screen</u> and have it continuously render something.
           3.  Start by setting <b>max_render_time</b> <b>1</b>. If the application drops frames, increment by <b>1</b>.

           This setting only has an effect if a per-output <b>max_render_time</b> is in effect on the output the window
           is currently on. See <b><a href="../man5/sway-output.5.html">sway-output</a></b>(5) for further details.

       <b>allow_tearing</b> yes|no
           Allows or disallows screen tearing as a result of immediate page flips for a fullscreen application.

           When  this option is not set, the tearing hints provided by the application determine whether tearing
           is allowed. When <u>yes</u> is specified, the application allows tearing regardless of  the  tearing  hints.
           When  <u>no</u>  is  specified,  tearing will never be allowed on the application, regardless of the tearing
           hints.

           This setting only has an  effect  if  tearing  is  allowed  on  the  output  through  the  per-output
           <b>allow_tearing</b> setting. See <b><a href="../man5/sway-output.5.html">sway-output</a></b>(5) for further details.

       <b>move</b> left|right|up|down [&lt;px&gt; px]
           Moves  the  focused container in the direction specified. The optional <u>px</u> argument specifies how many
           pixels to move the container. If unspecified, the default is  10  pixels.  Pixels  are  ignored  when
           moving tiled containers.

       <b>move</b> [absolute] position &lt;pos_x&gt; [px|ppt] &lt;pos_y&gt; [px|ppt]
           Moves the focused container to the specified position in the workspace. The position can be specified
           in  pixels  or  percentage  points,  omitting  the  unit defaults to pixels. If <u>absolute</u> is used, the
           position is relative to all outputs. <u>absolute</u> can not be used with percentage points.

       <b>move</b> [absolute] position center
           Moves the focused container to be centered on the workspace. If <u>absolute</u> is used, it is moved to  the
           center of all outputs.

       <b>move</b> position cursor|mouse|pointer
           Moves the focused container to be centered on the cursor.

       <b>move</b> [container|window] [to] mark &lt;mark&gt;
           Moves the focused container to the specified mark.

       <b>move</b> [--no-auto-back-and-forth] [container|window] [to] workspace [number] &lt;name&gt;
           Moves  the focused container to the specified workspace. The string <u>number</u> is optional and is used to
           match a workspace with the same number, even if it has a different name.

       <b>move</b> [container|window] [to] workspace prev|next|current
           Moves the focused container to the previous, next or current workspace  on  this  output,  or  if  no
           workspaces remain, the previous or next output.

       <b>move</b> [container|window] [to] workspace prev_on_output|next_on_output
           Moves  the  focused  container  to  the previous or next workspace on this output, wrapping around if
           already at the first or last workspace.

       <b>move</b> [container|window] [to] workspace back_and_forth
           Moves the focused container to previously focused workspace.

       <b>move</b> [container|window] [to] output &lt;name-or-id&gt;|current
           Moves the focused container to the specified output.

       <b>move</b> [container|window] [to] output up|right|down|left
           Moves the focused container to next output in the specified direction.

       <b>move</b> [container|window] [to] scratchpad
           Moves the focused container to the scratchpad.

       <b>move</b> workspace [to] output &lt;name-or-id&gt;|current
           Moves the focused workspace to the specified output.

       <b>move</b> workspace to [output] &lt;name-or-id&gt;|current
           Moves the focused workspace to the specified output.

       <b>move</b> workspace [to] output up|right|down|left
           Moves the focused workspace to next output in the specified direction.

       <b>move</b> workspace to [output] up|right|down|left
           Moves the focused workspace to next output in the specified direction.

       <b>nop</b> &lt;comment&gt;
           A no operation command that can be used to override default behaviour. The optional comment  argument
           is ignored, but logged for debugging purposes.

       <b>reload</b>
           Reloads the sway config file and applies any changes. The config file is located at path specified by
           the command line arguments when started, otherwise according to the priority stated in <b><a href="../man1/sway.1.html">sway</a></b>(1).

       <b>rename</b> workspace [&lt;old_name&gt;] to &lt;new_name&gt;
           Rename either &lt;old_name&gt; or the focused workspace to the &lt;new_name&gt;

       <b>resize</b> shrink|grow width|height [&lt;amount&gt; [px|ppt]]
           Resizes  the  currently focused container by <u>amount</u>, specified in pixels or percentage points. If the
           units are omitted, floating containers are resized in px and tiled containers  by  ppt.  <u>amount</u>  will
           default to 10 if omitted.

       <b>resize</b> set height &lt;height&gt; [px|ppt]
           Sets  the  height  of the container to <u>height</u>, specified in pixels or percentage points. If the units
           are omitted, floating containers are resized in px and tiled containers by ppt. If <u>height</u> is  0,  the
           container will not be resized.

       <b>resize</b> set [width] &lt;width&gt; [px|ppt]
           Sets  the width of the container to <u>width</u>, specified in pixels or percentage points. If the units are
           omitted, floating containers are resized in px and tiled containers  by  ppt.  If  <u>width</u>  is  0,  the
           container will not be resized.

       <b>resize</b> set [width] &lt;width&gt; [px|ppt] [height] &lt;height&gt; [px|ppt]
           Sets  the  width  and  height of the container to <u>width</u> and <u>height</u>, specified in pixels or percentage
           points. If the units are omitted, floating containers are resized in px and tiled containers by  ppt.
           If <u>width</u> or <u>height</u> is 0, the container will not be resized on that axis.

       <b>scratchpad</b> show
           Shows  a  window from the scratchpad. Repeatedly using this command will cycle through the windows in
           the scratchpad.

       <b>shortcuts_inhibitor</b> enable|disable
           Enables or disables the ability of clients  to  inhibit  keyboard  shortcuts  for  a  view.  This  is
           primarily  useful  for  virtualization  and  remote desktop software. It affects either the currently
           focused view or a set of views selected by criteria. Subcommand <u>disable</u> additionally deactivates  any
           active inhibitors for the given view(s). Criteria are particularly useful with the <b>for_window</b> command
           to  configure  a  class  of  views  differently  from  the  per-seat defaults established by the <b>seat</b>
           subcommand of the same name. See <b><a href="../man5/sway-input.5.html">sway-input</a></b>(5) for more ways to affect inhibitors.

       <b>split</b> vertical|v|horizontal|h|none|n|toggle|t
           Splits the current container, vertically or horizontally. When <u>none</u> is specified,  the  effect  of  a
           previous split is undone if the current container is the only child of a split parent. When <u>toggle</u> is
           specified, the current container is split opposite to the parent container's layout.

       <b>splith</b>
           Equivalent to <b>split</b> <b>horizontal</b>

       <b>splitv</b>
           Equivalent to <b>split</b> <b>vertical</b>

       <b>splitt</b>
           Equivalent to <b>split</b> <b>toggle</b>

       <b>sticky</b> enable|disable|toggle
           "Sticks" a floating window to the current output so that it shows up on all workspaces.

       <b>swap</b> container with id|con_id|mark &lt;arg&gt;
           Swaps  the  position,  geometry,  and fullscreen status of two containers. The first container can be
           selected either by criteria or focus. The second container can be selected by <u>id</u>, <u>con_id</u>, or <u>mark</u>. <u>id</u>
           can only be used with xwayland views. If the first container has focus, it will retain  focus  unless
           it is moved to a different workspace or the second container becomes fullscreen on the same workspace
           as the first container. In either of those cases, the second container will gain focus.

       <b>title_format</b> &lt;format&gt;
           Sets the format of window titles. The following placeholders may be used:

               %title - The title supplied by the window
                         %app_id - The wayland app ID (applicable to wayland windows only)
                         %class - The X11 classname (applicable to xwayland windows only)
                         %instance - The X11 instance (applicable to xwayland windows only)
                         %shell - The protocol the window is using (typically xwayland or
                   xdg_shell)

           This command is typically used with <b>for_window</b> criteria. For example:

               for_window [title="."] title_format "&lt;b&gt;%title&lt;/b&gt; (%app_id)"

           Note that markup requires pango to be enabled via the <b>font</b> command.

           The default format is "%title".

   <b>Config</b> <b>or</b> <b>runtime</b> <b>commands</b>
       The following commands may be used either in the configuration file or at runtime.

       <b>assign</b> &lt;criteria&gt; [→] [workspace] [number] &lt;workspace&gt;
           Assigns  views  matching <u>criteria</u> (see <b>CRITERIA</b> for details) to <u>workspace</u>. The → (U+2192) is optional
           and cosmetic. This command is equivalent to:

               for_window &lt;criteria&gt; move container to workspace &lt;workspace&gt;

       <b>assign</b> &lt;criteria&gt; [→] output left|right|up|down|&lt;name&gt;
           Assigns views matching <u>criteria</u> (see <b>CRITERIA</b> for details) to the specified output. The → (U+2192) is
           optional and cosmetic. This command is equivalent to:

               for_window &lt;criteria&gt; move container to output &lt;output&gt;

       <b>bindsym</b> [--whole-window] [--border] [--exclude-titlebar]  [--release]  [--locked]  [--to-code]  [--input-
       device=&lt;device&gt;] [--no-warn] [--no-repeat] [--inhibited] [Group&lt;1-4&gt;+]&lt;key combo&gt; &lt;command&gt;
           Binds  <u>key</u>  <u>combo</u>  to  execute  the sway command <u>command</u> when pressed. You may use XKB key names here
           (<b><a href="../man1/wev.1.html">wev</a></b>(1) is a good tool for discovering these). With the flag <u>--release</u>, the command is executed  when
           the key combo is released. If <u>input-device</u> is given, the binding will only be executed for that input
           device  and will be executed instead of any binding that is generic to all devices. If a group number
           is given, then the binding will only be available for that group. By  default,  if  you  overwrite  a
           binding, swaynag will give you a warning. To silence this, use the <u>--no-warn</u> flag.

           For  specifying  modifier  keys,  you  can  use  the  XKB modifier names <u>Shift</u>, <u>Lock</u> (for Caps Lock),
           <u>Control</u>, <u>Mod1</u> (for Alt), <u>Mod2</u> (for Num Lock), <u>Mod3</u> (for XKB modifier Mod3), <u>Mod4</u> (for the Logo  key),
           and  <u>Mod5</u>  (for  AltGr). In addition, you can use the aliases  <u>Ctrl</u> (for Control), <u>Alt</u> (for Alt), and
           <u>Super</u> (for the Logo key).

           Unless the flag <u>--locked</u> is set, the command will not be run when a screen locking program is active.
           If there is a matching binding with and without <u>--locked</u>, the one with will be preferred when  locked
           and  the one without will be preferred when unlocked. If there are matching bindings and one has both
           <u>--input-device</u> and <u>--locked</u> and the other has  neither,  the  former  will  be  preferred  even  when
           unlocked.

           Unless  the  flag <u>--inhibited</u> is set, the command will not be run when a keyboard shortcuts inhibitor
           is active for the currently focused window. Such inhibitors are usually requested by  remote  desktop
           and  virtualization  software  to enable the user to send keyboard shortcuts to the remote or virtual
           session. The <u>--inhibited</u> flag allows one to define bindings which will be exempt from pass-through to
           such software. The same preference logic as for <u>--locked</u> applies.

           Unless the flag <u>--no-repeat</u> is set, the command  will  be  run  repeatedly  when  the  key  is  held,
           according to the repeat settings specified in the input configuration.

           Bindings  to keysyms are layout-dependent. This can be changed with the <u>--to-code</u> flag. In this case,
           the keysyms will be translated into the corresponding keycodes in the first configured layout.

           Mouse bindings operate on the container under the cursor instead of the  container  that  has  focus.
           Mouse  buttons can either be specified in the form <u>button[1-9]</u> or by using the name of the event code
           (ex <u>BTN_LEFT</u> or <u>BTN_RIGHT</u>). For the former option, the buttons will be mapped to their values in  X11
           (1=left,  2=middle,  3=right,  4=scroll  up,  5=scroll  down,  6=scroll left, 7=scroll right, 8=back,
           9=forward). For the latter option, you can find the event names using <u>libinput</u> <u>debug-events</u>.

           The priority for matching bindings is as follows: input device, group, and locked state.

           <u>--whole-window</u>, <u>--border</u>, and <u>--exclude-titlebar</u> are mouse-only options which affect  the  region  in
           which  the  mouse bindings can be triggered.  By default, mouse bindings are only triggered when over
           the title bar. With the <u>--border</u> option, the border of the window will be included  in  this  region.
           With the <u>--whole-window</u> option, the cursor can be anywhere over a window including the title, border,
           and  content. <u>--exclude-titlebar</u> can be used in conjunction with any other option to specify that the
           titlebar should be excluded from the region of consideration.

           If <u>--whole-window</u> is given, the command can be triggered when the cursor is over an empty  workspace.
           Using a mouse binding over a layer surface's exclusive region is not currently possible.

           Example:
                     # Execute firefox when alt, shift, and f are pressed together
                     bindsym Mod1+Shift+f exec firefox

           <b>bindcode</b>   [--whole-window]   [--border]   [--exclude-titlebar]   [--release]   [--locked]  [--input-
           device=&lt;device&gt;]  [--no-warn]  [--no-repeat]  [--inhibited]  [Group&lt;1-4&gt;+]&lt;code&gt;  &lt;command&gt;  is  also
           available for binding with key/button codes instead of key/button names.

       <b>bindswitch</b> [--locked] [--no-warn] [--reload] &lt;switch&gt;:&lt;state&gt; &lt;command&gt;
           Binds  &lt;switch&gt;  to  execute  the  sway  command <u>command</u> on state changes. Supported switches are <u>lid</u>
           (laptop lid) and <u>tablet</u> (tablet mode) switches. Valid values for <u>state</u> are <u>on</u>, <u>off</u> and <u>toggle</u>.  These
           switches  are  on  when the device lid is shut and when tablet mode is active respectively. <u>toggle</u> is
           also supported to run a command both when the switch is toggled on or off.

           Unless the flag <u>--locked</u> is set, the command will not be run when a screen locking program is active.
           If there is a matching binding with and without <u>--locked</u>, the one with will be preferred when  locked
           and the one without will be preferred when unlocked.

           If  the <u>--reload</u> flag is given, the binding will also be executed when the config is reloaded. <u>toggle</u>
           bindings will not be executed on reload. The <u>--locked</u> flag will operate as normal so if the config is
           reloaded while locked and <u>--locked</u> is not given, the binding will not be executed.

           By default, if you overwrite a binding, swaynag will give you a warning. To  silence  this,  use  the
           <u>--no-warn</u> flag.

           Example:
                     # Show the virtual keyboard when tablet mode is entered.
                     bindswitch tablet:on busctl call --user sm.puri.OSK0 /sm/puri/OSK0 sm.puri.OSK0 SetVisible b true

                     # Log a message when the laptop lid is opened or closed.
                     bindswitch lid:toggle exec echo "Lid moved"

       <b>bindgesture</b> [--exact] [--input-device=&lt;device&gt;] [--no-warn] &lt;gesture&gt;[:&lt;fingers&gt;][:directions] &lt;command&gt;
           Binds  <u>gesture</u>  to execute the sway command <u>command</u> when detected. Currently supports the <u>hold</u>, <u>pinch</u>
           or <u>swipe</u> gesture. Optionally can be limited to bind to a certain number of <u>fingers</u> or, for a <u>pinch</u> or
           <u>swipe</u> gesture, to certain <u>directions</u>.

       └───────┴─────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

           The <u>fingers</u> can be limited to any sensible number or left empty to accept any  finger  counts.  Valid
           directions  are <u>up</u>, <u>down</u>, <u>left</u> and <u>right</u>, as well as <u>inward</u>, <u>outward</u>, <u>clockwise</u>, <u>counterclockwise</u> for
           the <u>pinch</u> gesture. Multiple directions can be combined by a plus.

           If a <u>input-device</u> is given, the binding will only be executed for  that  input  device  and  will  be
           executed  instead  of  any  binding  that  is  generic to all devices. By default, if you overwrite a
           binding, swaynag will give you a warning. To silence this, use the <u>--no-warn</u> flag.

           The <u>--exact</u> flag can be used to ensure a binding only matches when exactly all  specified  directions
           are matched and nothing more. If there is matching binding with <u>--exact</u>, it will be preferred.

           The  priority  for  matching  bindings  is  as  follows: input device, then exact matches followed by
           matches with the highest number of matching directions.

           Gestures executed while the pointer is above a bar are  not  handled  by  sway.  See  the  respective
           documentation, e.g. <b>bindgesture</b> in <b><a href="../man5/sway-bar.5.html">sway-bar</a></b>(5).

           Example:

       <b>client.background</b> &lt;color&gt;
           This command is ignored and is only present for i3 compatibility.

       <b>client.&lt;class&gt;</b> &lt;border&gt; &lt;background&gt; &lt;text&gt; [&lt;indicator&gt; [&lt;child_border&gt;]]
           Configures  the  color  of  window  borders and title bars. The first three colors are required. When
           omitted <u>indicator</u> will use a sane default and <u>child_border</u> will use the  color  set  for  <u>background</u>.
           Colors may be specified in hex, either as <u>#RRGGBB</u> or <u>#RRGGBBAA</u>.

           The available classes are:

           <b>client.focused</b>
               The window that has focus.

           <b>client.focused_inactive</b>
               The most recently focused view within a container which is not focused.

           <b>client.focused_tab_title</b>
               A  view that has focused descendant container. Tab or stack container title that is the parent of
               the focused container but is not directly focused. Defaults to focused_inactive if not  specified
               and does not use the indicator and child_border colors.

           <b>client.placeholder</b>
               Ignored (present for i3 compatibility).

           <b>client.unfocused</b>
               A view that does not have focus.

           <b>client.urgent</b>
               A  view  with  an urgency hint. <b>Note</b>: Native Wayland windows do not support urgency. Urgency only
               works for Xwayland windows.

           The meaning of each color is:

           <u>border</u>
               The border around the title bar.

           <u>background</u>
               The background of the title bar.

           <u>text</u>
               The text color of the title bar.

           <u>indicator</u>
               The color used to indicate where a new view will open. In a tiled container, this would paint the
               right border of the current view if a new view would be opened to the right.

           <u>child_border</u>
               The border around the view itself.

       The default colors are:

       <b>default_border</b> normal|none|pixel [&lt;n&gt;]
           Set default border style for new tiled windows. Config reload won't  affect  existing  windows,  only
           newly created ones after the reload.

       <b>default_floating_border</b> normal|none|pixel [&lt;n&gt;]
           Set  default  border style for new floating windows. This only applies to windows that are spawned in
           floating mode, not windows that become floating afterwards.

       <b>exec</b> &lt;shell command&gt;
           Executes <u>shell</u> <u>command</u> with sh.

       <b>exec_always</b> &lt;shell command&gt;
           Like <b>exec</b>, but the shell command will be executed <u>again</u> after <b>reload</b>.

       <b>floating_maximum_size</b> &lt;width&gt; x &lt;height&gt;
           Specifies the maximum size of floating windows. -1 x -1 removes the upper limit. The default is  0  x
           0, which will use the width and height of the entire output layout as the maximums

       <b>floating_minimum_size</b> &lt;width&gt; x &lt;height&gt;
           Specifies the minimum size of floating windows. The default is 75 x 50.

       <b>floating_modifier</b> &lt;modifier&gt; [normal|inverse]
           When  the  <u>modifier</u>  key  is  held  down, you may hold left click to move windows, and right click to
           resize them. Setting <u>modifier</u> to <u>none</u> disables this feature. If <u>inverse</u> is specified, left  click  is
           used for resizing and right click for moving.

       <b>focus_follows_mouse</b> yes|no|always
           If  set  to <u>yes</u>, moving your mouse over a window will focus that window. If set to <u>always</u>, the window
           under the cursor will always be focused, even after switching between workspaces.

       <b>focus_on_window_activation</b> smart|urgent|focus|none
           This option determines what to do when a client requests window activation. If  set  to  <u>urgent</u>,  the
           urgent  state will be set for that window. If set to <u>focus</u>, the window will become focused. If set to
           <u>smart</u>, the window will become focused only if it is already visible, otherwise the urgent state  will
           be set. Default is <u>urgent</u>.

       <b>focus_wrapping</b> yes|no|force|workspace
           This  option  determines  what to do when attempting to focus over the edge of a container. If set to
           <u>no</u>, the focused container will retain focus, if there are no other containers in  the  direction.  If
           set  to  <u>yes</u>,  focus  will  be  wrapped  to the opposite edge of the container, if there are no other
           containers in the direction. If set to <u>force</u>, focus will be wrapped  to  the  opposite  edge  of  the
           container,  even if there are other containers in the direction. If set to <u>workspace</u>, focus will wrap
           like in the <u>yes</u> case and additionally wrap when moving outside of workspaces boundaries.  Default  is
           <u>yes</u>.

       <b>font</b> [pango:]&lt;font&gt;
           Sets  font  to use for the title bars. To enable support for pango markup, preface the font name with
           <u>pango:</u>. For example, <u>monospace</u>  <u>10</u>  is  the  default  font.  To  enable  support  for  pango  markup,
           <u>pango:monospace</u> <u>10</u> should be used instead. Regardless of whether pango markup is enabled, <u>font</u> should
           be  specified  as  a  pango  font  description.  For more information on pango font descriptions, see
           https://docs.gtk.org/Pango/type_func.FontDescription.from_string.html#description

       <b>force_display_urgency_hint</b> &lt;timeout&gt; [ms]
           If an application on another workspace sets an urgency hint, switching to this workspace may lead  to
           immediate focus of the application, which also means the window decoration color would be immediately
           reset  to  <b>client.focused</b>. This may make it unnecessarily hard to tell which window originally raised
           the event. This option allows one to set a <u>timeout</u> in ms to delay the urgency hint reset.

       <b>titlebar_border_thickness</b> &lt;thickness&gt;
           Thickness of the titlebar border in pixels

       <b>titlebar_padding</b> &lt;horizontal&gt; [&lt;vertical&gt;]
           Padding of the text in the titlebar. <u>horizontal</u> value affects horizontal padding of  the  text  while
           <u>vertical</u>  value  affects  vertical  padding  (space  above and below text). Padding includes titlebar
           borders so their value should be greater than titlebar_border_thickness. If  <u>vertical</u>  value  is  not
           specified it is set to the <u>horizontal</u> value.

       <b>for_window</b> &lt;criteria&gt; &lt;command&gt;
           Whenever a window that matches <u>criteria</u> appears, run list of commands. See <b>CRITERIA</b> for more details.

       <b>gaps</b> inner|outer|horizontal|vertical|top|right|bottom|left &lt;amount&gt;
           Sets  default  <u>amount</u>  pixels of <u>inner</u> or <u>outer</u> gap, where the inner affects spacing around each view
           and outer affects the spacing around each workspace. Outer gaps are in addition  to  inner  gaps.  To
           reduce  or  remove  outer  gaps,  outer  gaps  can be set to a negative value. <u>outer</u> gaps can also be
           specified per side with <u>top</u>, <u>right</u>, <u>bottom</u>, and <u>left</u> or per direction with <u>horizontal</u> and <u>vertical</u>.

           This affects new workspaces only, and is used when the workspace doesn't have its own  gaps  settings
           (see: workspace &lt;ws&gt; gaps ...).

       <b>hide_edge_borders</b> [--i3] none|vertical|horizontal|both|smart|smart_no_gaps
           Hides  window  borders  adjacent  to  the  screen  edges.  Default  is  <u>none</u>. The <u>--i3</u> option enables
           i3-compatible behavior to hide the title bar on tabbed and stacked containers  with  one  child.  The
           <u>smart</u>|<u>smart_no_gaps</u>   options   are   equivalent   to   setting   <u>smart_borders</u>   smart|no_gaps   and
           <u>hide_edge_borders</u> none.

       <b>input</b> &lt;input_device&gt; &lt;input-subcommands...&gt;
           For details on input subcommands, see <b><a href="../man5/sway-input.5.html">sway-input</a></b>(5).

           * may be used in lieu of a specific device name to configure all  input  devices.  A  list  of  input
           device names may be obtained via <b>swaymsg</b> <b>-t</b> <b>get_inputs</b>.

       <b>seat</b> &lt;seat&gt; &lt;seat-subcommands...&gt;
           For details on seat subcommands, see <b><a href="../man5/sway-input.5.html">sway-input</a></b>(5).

       <b>kill</b>
           Kills (closes) the currently focused container and all of its children.

       <b>smart_borders</b> on|no_gaps|off
           If  smart_borders  are  <u>on</u>,  borders  will only be enabled if the workspace has more than one visible
           child. If smart_borders is set to <u>no_gaps</u>, borders will only be enabled if  the  workspace  has  more
           than one visible child and gaps equal to zero.

       <b>smart_gaps</b> on|off|toggle|inverse_outer
           If  smart_gaps are <u>on</u> gaps will only be enabled if a workspace has more than one child. If smart_gaps
           are <u>inverse_outer</u> outer gaps will only be enabled if a workspace has exactly one child.

       <b>mark</b> --add|--replace [--toggle] &lt;identifier&gt;
           Marks are arbitrary labels that can be used to identify certain windows and then jump to  them  at  a
           later  time.  Each <u>identifier</u> can only be set on a single window at a time since they act as a unique
           identifier. By default, <b>mark</b> sets <u>identifier</u> as the only mark on a window.  <u>--add</u>  will  instead  add
           <u>identifier</u>  to  the  list of current marks for that window. If <u>--toggle</u> is specified mark will remove
           <u>identifier</u> if it is already marked.

       <b>mode</b> &lt;mode&gt;
           Switches to the specified mode. The default mode is <u>default</u>.

       <b>mode</b> [--pango_markup] &lt;mode&gt; &lt;mode-subcommands...&gt;
           The only valid <u>mode-subcommands...</u> are <b>bindsym</b>, <b>bindcode</b>, <b>bindswitch</b>, and <b>set</b>. If  <u>--pango_markup</u>  is
           given, then <u>mode</u> will be interpreted as pango markup.

       <b>mouse_warping</b> output|container|none
           If  <u>output</u>  is  specified,  the mouse will be moved to new outputs as you move focus between them. If
           <u>container</u> is specified, the mouse will be moved to the middle of the container on switch. Default  is
           <u>output</u>.

       <b>no_focus</b> &lt;criteria&gt;
           Prevents  windows matching &lt;criteria&gt; from being focused automatically when they're created. This has
           no effect on the first window in a workspace.

       <b>output</b> &lt;output_name&gt; &lt;output-subcommands...&gt;
           For details on output subcommands, see <b><a href="../man5/sway-output.5.html">sway-output</a></b>(5).

           * may be used in lieu of a specific output name to configure all outputs. A list of output names  may
           be obtained via <b>swaymsg</b> <b>-t</b> <b>get_outputs</b>.

       <b>popup_during_fullscreen</b> smart|ignore|leave_fullscreen
           Determines  what to do when a fullscreen view opens a dialog. If <u>smart</u> (the default), the dialog will
           be displayed. If <u>ignore</u>, the dialog will not be rendered. If <u>leave_fullscreen</u>,  the  view  will  exit
           fullscreen mode and the dialog will be rendered.

       <b>primary_selection</b> enabled|disabled
           Enable  or  disable  the  primary  selection  clipboard. May only be configured at launch. Default is
           <u>enabled</u>.

       <b>set</b> $&lt;name&gt; &lt;value&gt;
           Sets variable $<u>name</u> to <u>value</u>. You can use the new variable in the arguments of future commands.  When
           the  variable  is  used,  it  can be escaped with an additional $ (ie $$<u>name</u>) to have the replacement
           happen at run time instead of when reading the config. However, it does not always make sense for the
           variable to be replaced at run time since some arguments do need to be known at config time.

       <b>show_marks</b> yes|no
           If <b>show_marks</b> is yes, marks will be displayed in the window borders. Any mark  that  starts  with  an
           underscore will not be drawn even if <b>show_marks</b> is yes. The default is <u>yes</u>.

       <b>opacity</b> [set|plus|minus] &lt;value&gt;
           Adjusts  the  opacity  of the window between 0 (completely transparent) and 1 (completely opaque). If
           the operation is omitted, <u>set</u> will be used.

       <b>tiling_drag</b>  enable|disable|toggle
           Sets whether or not tiling containers can be dragged  with  the  mouse.  If  <u>enabled</u>  (default),  the
           <u>floating_mod</u> can be used to drag tiling, as well as floating, containers. Using the left mouse button
           on title bars without the <u>floating_mod</u> will also allow the container to be dragged. <u>toggle</u> should not
           be used in the config file.

       <b>tiling_drag_threshold</b> &lt;threshold&gt;
           Sets  the  threshold that must be exceeded for a container to be dragged by its titlebar. This has no
           effect if <u>floating_mod</u> is used or if <u>tiling_drag</u> is set to <u>disable</u>.   Once  the  threshold  has  been
           exceeded once, the drag starts and the cursor can come back inside the threshold without stopping the
           drag.  <u>threshold</u> is multiplied by the scale of the output that the cursor on.  The default is 9.

       <b>title_align</b> left|center|right
           Sets  the title alignment. If <u>right</u> is selected and <u>show_marks</u> is set to <u>yes</u>, the marks will be shown
           on the <u>left</u> side instead of the <u>right</u> side.

       <b>unbindswitch</b> &lt;switch&gt;:&lt;state&gt;
           Removes a binding for when &lt;switch&gt; changes to &lt;state&gt;.

       <b>unbindgesture</b> [--exact] [--input-device=&lt;device&gt;] &lt;gesture&gt;[:&lt;fingers&gt;][:directions]
           Removes a binding for the specified <u>gesture</u>, <u>fingers</u> and <u>directions</u> combination.

       <b>unbindsym</b> [--whole-window] [--border] [--exclude-titlebar] [--release] [--locked]  [--to-code]  [--input-
       device=&lt;device&gt;] &lt;key combo&gt;
           Removes the binding for <u>key</u> <u>combo</u> that was previously bound with the given flags.  If <u>input-device</u> is
           given, only the binding for that input device will be unbound.

           <b>unbindcode</b>   [--whole-window]   [--border]   [--exclude-titlebar]  [--release]  [--locked]  [--input-
           device=&lt;device&gt;] &lt;code&gt; is also available for unbinding with key/button codes instead  of  key/button
           names.

       <b>unmark</b> [&lt;identifier&gt;]
           <b>unmark</b>  will  remove <u>identifier</u> from the list of current marks on a window. If <u>identifier</u> is omitted,
           all marks are removed.

       <b>urgent</b> enable|disable|allow|deny
           Using <u>enable</u> or <u>disable</u> manually sets or unsets the  window's  urgent  state.  Using  <u>allow</u>  or  <u>deny</u>
           controls  the  window's ability to set itself as urgent. By default, windows are allowed to set their
           own urgency.

       <b>workspace</b> [--no-auto-back-and-forth] [number] &lt;[num:]name&gt;
           Switches to the specified workspace. The <u>num:</u> portion of the name is optional and will  be  used  for
           ordering. If <u>num:</u> is not given and <u>name</u> is a number, then it will be also be used for ordering.

           If  the  <u>no-auto-back-and-forth</u>  option is given, then this command will not perform a back-and-forth
           operation when the workspace is already focused and <u>workspace_auto_back_and_forth</u> is enabled.

           If the <u>number</u> keyword is specified and a workspace with the number already exists, then the workspace
           with the number will be used. If a workspace with the number does not exist, a new workspace will  be
           created with the name <u>name</u>.

       <b>workspace</b> prev|next
           Switches  to  the next workspace on the current output or on the next output if currently on the last
           workspace.

       <b>workspace</b> prev_on_output|next_on_output
           Switches to the next workspace on the current output.

       <b>workspace</b> back_and_forth
           Switches to the previously focused workspace.

       <b>workspace</b> &lt;name&gt; gaps inner|outer|horizontal|vertical|top|right|bottom|left &lt;amount&gt;
           Specifies that workspace <u>name</u> should have the given gaps settings when it is created.

           This command does not affect existing workspaces. To alter the gaps of an existing workspace, use the
           <u>gaps</u> command.

       <b>workspace</b> &lt;name&gt; output &lt;outputs...&gt;
           Specifies that workspace <u>name</u> should be shown on the  specified  <u>outputs</u>.  Multiple  outputs  can  be
           listed  and  the first available will be used. If the workspace gets placed on an output further down
           the list and an output that is higher on the list becomes available, the workspace will be  moved  to
           the higher priority output.

           This command does not affect existing workspaces. To move an existing workspace, use the <u>move</u> command
           in  combination  with  the  <u>workspace</u>  criteria  (non-empty workspaces only) or <u>workspace</u> command (to
           switch to the workspace before moving).

       <b>workspace_auto_back_and_forth</b> yes|no
           When <u>yes</u>, repeating a workspace switch command will switch back to the prior workspace. For  example,
           if  you  are  currently  on  workspace  1, switch to workspace 2, then invoke the <b>workspace</b> <b>2</b> command
           again, you will be returned to workspace 1. Default is <u>no</u>.

</pre><h4><b>CRITERIA</b></h4><pre>
       A criteria is a string in the form of, for example:

           [class="[Rr]egex.*" title="some title"]

       The string contains one or more (space separated) attribute/value pairs. They are used by  some  commands
       to  choose  which  views  to  execute  actions  on.  All attributes must match for the criteria to match.
       Criteria is retained across commands separated by a <b>,</b>, but will be reset (and allow for new criteria,  if
       desired) for commands separated by a <b>;</b>.

       Criteria  may  be  used with either the <b>for_window</b> or <b>assign</b> commands to specify operations to perform on
       new views. A criteria may also be used to perform specific commands (ones  that  normally  act  upon  one
       window) on all views that match that criteria. For example:

       Focus on a window with the mark "IRC":

           [con_mark="IRC"] focus

       Kill all windows with the title "Emacs":

           [class="Emacs"] kill

       You  may  like to use swaymsg -t get_tree for finding the values of these properties in practice for your
       applications.

       The following attributes may be matched with:

       <b>all</b>
           Matches all windows.

       <b>app_id</b>
           Compare value against the app id. Can be a regular expression. If value is __focused__, then the  app
           id  must  be  the  same  as  that  of  the  currently  focused window. <u>app_id</u> are specific to Wayland
           applications.

       <b>class</b>
           Compare value against the window class. Can be a regular expression. If value  is  __focused__,  then
           the  window class must be the same as that of the currently focused window. <u>class</u> are specific to X11
           applications and require XWayland.

       <b>con_id</b>
           Compare against the internal container ID, which you can find via IPC. If value is __focused__,  then
           the id must be the same as that of the currently focused window.

       <b>con_mark</b>
           Compare against the window marks. Can be a regular expression.

       <b>floating</b>
           Matches floating windows.

       <b>id</b>
           Compare  value  against  the  X11  window ID. Must be numeric. id is specific to X11 applications and
           requires XWayland.

       <b>instance</b>
           Compare value against the window instance. Can be a regular expression. If value is __focused__, then
           the window instance must be the same as that of the currently focused window. instance is specific to
           X11 applications and requires XWayland.

       <b>pid</b>
           Compare value against the window's process ID. Must be numeric.

       <b>shell</b>
           Compare value against the window  shell,  such  as  "xdg_shell"  or  "xwayland".  Can  be  a  regular
           expression. If value is __focused__, then the shell must be the same as that of the currently focused
           window.

       <b>tiling</b>
           Matches tiling windows.

       <b>title</b>
           Compare  against  the  window  title.  Can be a regular expression. If value is __focused__, then the
           window title must be the same as that of the currently focused window.

       <b>urgent</b>
           Compares the urgent state of the window. Can be <u>first</u>, <u>last</u>, <u>latest</u>, <u>newest</u>, <u>oldest</u> or <u>recent</u>.

       <b>window_role</b>
           Compare against the  window  role  (WM_WINDOW_ROLE).  Can  be  a  regular  expression.  If  value  is
           __focused__,  then  the  window  role  must  be  the  same  as  that of the currently focused window.
           window_role is specific to X11 applications and requires XWayland.

       <b>window_type</b>
           Compare against the window type (_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE). Possible values are normal,  dialog,  utility,
           toolbar,  splash,  menu, dropdown_menu, popup_menu, tooltip and notification. window_type is specific
           to X11 applications and requires XWayland.

       <b>workspace</b>
           Compare against the workspace name for this view. Can be  a  regular  expression.  If  the  value  is
           __focused__, then all the views on the currently focused workspace matches.
