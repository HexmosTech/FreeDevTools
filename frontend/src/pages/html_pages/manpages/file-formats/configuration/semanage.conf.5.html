       semanage.conf - global configuration file for the SELinux Management library

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>semanage.conf</b>  file  is usually located under the directory <a href="file:/etc/selinux">/etc/selinux</a> and it is used for run-time
       configuration of the behavior of the SELinux Management library.

       Each line should contain a configuration parameter followed by the equal sign ("=") and then followed  by
       the  configuration value for that parameter.  Anything after the "#" symbol is ignored similarly to empty
       lines.

       The following parameters are allowed:

              <b>module-store</b>
                     Specify how the SELinux Management library should interact with the SELinux  policy  store.
                     When  set  to  "direct", the SELinux Management library writes to the SELinux policy module
                     store directly (this is the default setting).  Otherwise a socket path or a server name can
                     be used for the argument.   If  the  argument  begins  with  "/"  (as  in  "/foo/bar"),  it
                     represents  the path to a named socket that should be used to connect the policy management
                     server.  If the argument does not begin with a "/" (as in "example.com:4242"), it should be
                     interpreted as the name of a remote policy management server  to  be  used  through  a  TCP
                     connection  (default port is 4242 unless a different one is specified after the server name
                     using the colon to separate the two fields).

              <b>root</b>   Specify an alternative root path to use for the store.  The default is "/"

              <b>store-root</b>
                     Specify an alternative store_root path to use.  The default is "/var/lib/selinux"

              <b>compiler-directory</b>
                     Specify an alternative directory that contains HLL to CIL compilers.  The default value  is
                     "/usr/libexec/selinux/hll".

              <b>ignore-module-cache</b>
                     Whether  or  not  to  ignore  the cache of CIL modules compiled from HLL.  It can be set to
                     either "true" or "false" and is set to "false" by default.  If the cache is  ignored,  then
                     all CIL modules are recompiled from their HLL modules.

              <b>policy-version</b>
                     When   generating  the  policy,  by  default  <b>semanage</b>  will  set  the  policy  version  to
                     POLICYDB_VERSION_MAX, as defined in &lt;sepol/policydb/policydb.h&gt;.  Change this setting if  a
                     different version needs to be set for the policy.

              <b>target-platform</b>
                     The target platform to generate policies for.  Valid values are "selinux" and "xen", and is
                     set to "selinux" by default.

              <b>expand-check</b>
                     Whether  or  not to check "neverallow" rules when executing all <b>semanage</b> command. It can be
                     set to either "0" (disabled) or "1" (enabled) and by default it is enabled.  There might be
                     a large penalty in execution time if this option is enabled.

              <b>file-mode</b>
                     By default the permission mode for the run-time policy files is set to 0644.

              <b>save-previous</b>
                     It controls whether the previous module directory is saved after a successful commit to the
                     policy store and it can be set to either "true" or  "false".   By  default  it  is  set  to
                     "false" (the previous version is deleted).

              <b>save-linked</b>
                     It controls whether the previously linked module is saved (with name "base.linked") after a
                     successful  commit  to  the policy store.  It can be set to either "true" or "false" and by
                     default it is set to "false" (the previous module is deleted).

              <b>ignoredirs</b>
                     List, separated by ";", of directories to ignore when  setting  up  users  homedirs.   Some
                     distributions use this to stop labeling <a href="file:/root">/root</a> as a homedir.

              <b>usepasswd</b>
                     Whether  or not to enable the use <b>getpwent()</b> to obtain a list of home directories to label.
                     It can be set to either "true" or "false".  By default it is set to "true".

              <b>disable-genhomedircon</b>
                     It controls whether or not the genhomedircon function is executed when using  the  <b>semanage</b>
                     command  and  it  can  be  set  to  either "false" or "true".  By default the genhomedircon
                     functionality is enabled (equivalent to this option set to "false").

              <b>handle-unknown</b>
                     This option overrides the kernel behavior for handling permissions defined  in  the  kernel
                     but  missing  from  the  actual  policy.  It can be set to "deny", "reject" or "allow".  By
                     default the setting from the policy is taken.

              <b>bzip-blocksize</b>
                     It should be in the range 0â€“9.  A value of 0 means no compression.   By  default  the  bzip
                     block  size  is  set  to  9  (actual  block  size value is obtained after multiplication by
                     100,000).

              <b>bzip-small</b>
                     When set to "true", the bzip algorithm shall try to reduce its system memory usage.  It can
                     be set to either "true" or "false" and by default it is set to "false".

              <b>remove-hll</b>
                     When set to "true", HLL files will be removed after compilation  into  CIL.   In  order  to
                     delete  HLL  files  already  compiled into CIL, modules will need to be recompiled with the
                     <b>ignore-module-cache</b> option set to 'true'  or  using  the  <b>ignore-module-cache</b>  option  with
                     semodule.   The  remove-hll option can be set to either "true" or "false" and by default it
                     is set to "false".

                     Please note that since this option deletes all HLL files, an updated HLL compiler will  not
                     be  able to recompile the original HLL file into CIL.  In order to compile the original HLL
                     file into CIL, the same HLL file will need to be reinstalled.

              <b>optimize-policy</b>
                     When set to "true", the kernel policy will be optimized upon rebuilds.  It can  be  set  to
                     either "true" or "false" and by default it is set to "true".

              <b>multiple-decls</b>
                     When  set to "true", duplicate type, type attribute, and role declarations will be allowed.
                     It can be set to either "true" or "false" and by default it is set to "true".

       For certain tasks the SELinux Management library resorts to running external commands.  For the following
       commands their path and arguments can be overridden:

                     <b>load_policy</b>
                            Command  to  load  a  kernel   policy.    Requires   no   argument.    Defaults   to
                            <u>/sbin/load_policy</u> with no arguments.

                     <b>setfiles</b>
                            Command to verify file context definitions.  Requires two arguments, the path to the
                            kernel  policy  and  the  path  to  the  file  context definition file.  Defaults to
                            <u>/sbin/setfiles</u> with the arguments '-q -c $@ $&lt;'.

                     <b>sefcontext_compile</b>
                            Command to compile a file context definition file.  Requires one argument, the  path
                            to   the   to   be   compiled   file   context   definition   file.    Defaults   to
                            <u>/sbin/sefcontext_compile</u> with the argument '$@'.

              Either <u>path</u> or <u>args</u> can be omitted.  The argument string must contain '$@' for the first  required
              argument, and '$&lt;' for the second one.  The syntax for overriding an external command property is:

                     [<u>name</u>]
                     path = /path/to/command
                     args = --flag
                     [end]

              Example

                     [sefcontext_compile]
                     path = /usr/sbin/sefcontext_compile
                     args = -r $@
                     [end]

              Optionally  the  SELinux  Management library can invoke external commands to verify source modules
              (<b>verify</b> <b>module</b>), linked modules (<b>verify</b> <b>linked</b>), and kernel policies (<b>verify</b> <b>kernel</b>).  The  syntax
              is  identical  to  the  above  command  overrides.   The  program should exit with a value of 0 on
              success, and non zero on failure.
