</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       foot.ini - configuration file for <b><a href="../man1/foot.1.html">foot</a></b>(1)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>foot</b> uses the standard <u>unix</u> <u>configuration</u> <u>format</u>, with section based key/value pairs. The default section
       is  usually  unnamed, i.e. not prefixed with a <u>[section]</u>. However it can also be explicitly named <u>[main]</u>,
       say if it needs to be reopened after any of the other sections.

       foot will search for a configuration file in the following locations, in this order:

           •   <b>XDG_CONFIG_HOME/foot/foot.ini</b> (defaulting to <b>$HOME/.config/foot/foot.ini</b> if unset)
           •   <b>XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/foot/foot.ini</b> (defaulting to <b>/etc/xdg/foot/foot.ini</b> if unset)

       An example configuration file containing all options with their default value commented out will  usually
       be installed to <b>/etc/xdg/foot/foot.ini</b>.

       Options are set using KEY=VALUE pairs:

           <b>[colors]</b>
           <b>background=000000</b>
           <b>foreground=ffffff</b>

       Empty values (<b>KEY=</b>) are not supported. String options do allow the empty string to be set, but it must be
       quoted: <b>KEY=""</b>)

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>main</b></h4><pre>
       <b>shell</b>
           Executable  to  launch. Typically a shell. Default: <u>$SHELL</u> if set, otherwise the user's default shell
           (as specified in <u><a href="file:/etc/passwd">/etc/passwd</a></u>). You can also pass arguments. For example <b><a href="file:/bin/bash">/bin/bash</a></b> <b>--norc</b>.

       <b>login-shell</b>
           Boolean. If enabled, the shell will be launched as a login shell, by prepending  a  '-'  to  argv[0].
           Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>term</b>
           Value to set the environment variable <b>TERM</b> to. Default: <u>foot</u>

       <b>font</b>, <b>font-bold</b>, <b>font-italic</b>, <b>font-bold-italic</b>
           Comma  separated  list of fonts to use, in fontconfig format. That is, a font name followed by a list
           of colon-separated options. Most noteworthy is <b>:size=n</b> (or <b>:pixelsize=n</b>), which is used  to  set  the
           font size. Note that the font size is also affected by the <b>dpi-aware</b> option.

           Examples:
               •   Dina:weight=bold:slant=italic
               •   Courier New:size=12
               •   Fantasque Sans Mono:fontfeatures=ss01
               •   Iosevka:fontfeatures=cv01=1:fontfeatures=cv06=1
               •   Meslo LG S:size=12, Noto Color Emoji:size=12
               •   Courier New:pixelsize=8

           Be aware that, depending on your setup, there may be global FontConfig options that overrides options
           set  here.  If an option appears to have no effect, ensure there is no global configuration file that
           sets the same option with <b>assign</b> or <b>assign_replace</b>; use one of the many <b>append</b>  or  possibly  <b>prepend</b>
           modes.

           For each option, the first font is the primary font. The remaining fonts are fallback fonts that will
           be used whenever a glyph cannot be found in the primary font.

           The  fallback  fonts  are searched in the order they appear. If a glyph cannot be found in any of the
           fallback fonts, the dynamic fallback list from fontconfig (for the primary font) is searched.

           <b>font-bold</b>, <b>font-italic</b> and <b>font-bold-italic</b> allow custom fonts to be used for bold/italic/bold+italic
           fonts. If left unconfigured, the bold/italic variants of the regular font(s) specified  in  <b>font</b>  are
           used.  <b>Note</b>:  you  <u>may</u> have to tweak the size(s) of the custom bold/italic fonts to match the regular
           font.

           To disable bold and/or italic fonts, set e.g. <b>font-bold</b> to <u>exactly</u> the same value as <b>font</b>.

           size is in <u>points</u> (as defined by the FontConfig format). To set a <u>pixel</u> size, use pixelsize  instead.
           Note  that  pixel  sizes  are  unaffected by DPI aware rendering (see <b>dpi-aware</b>), but are affected by
           desktop scaling.

           Default: <u>monospace:size=8</u> (<b>font</b>), <u>not</u> <u>set</u> (<b>font-bold</b>, <b>font-italic</b>, <b>font-bold-italic</b>).

       <b>font-size-adjustment</b>
           Amount, in <u>points</u>, <u>pixels</u> or <u>percent</u>, to increment/decrement the font size when zooming in our out.

           Examples:
               font-size-adjustment=0.5   # Adjust by 0.5 points
               font-size-adjustment=10px  # Adjust by 10 pixels
               font-size-adjustment=7.5%  # Adjust by 7.5 percent

           Default: <u>0.5</u>

       <b>include</b>
           Absolute path to configuration file to import.

           The import file has its own section scope. I.e. the including configuration is still in  the  default
           section after the include, regardless of which section the included file ends in.

               •   The path must be an absolute path, or start with <b>~/</b>.
               •   Multiple include directives are allowed, but only one path per directive.
               •   Nested imports are allowed.

           Default: <u>not</u> <u>set</u>.

       <b>line-height</b>
           An absolute value, in <u>points</u>, that override line height from the font metrics.

           You can specify a height in <u>pixels</u> by using the <b>px</b> suffix: e.g. <b>line-height=12px</b>.

           <b>Warning</b>:  when changing the font size at runtime (i.e. zooming in our out), foot will change the line
           height by the same percentage. However, due to rounding, it is possible the line height will be  "too
           small" for some font sizes, causing e.g. underscores to "disappear".

           See also: <b>vertical-letter-offset</b>.

           Default: <u>not</u> <u>set</u>.

       <b>letter-spacing</b>
           Spacing  between  letters,  in  <u>points</u>.  A positive value will increase the cell size, and a negative
           value shrinks it.

           You can specify a letter spacing in <u>pixels</u> by using the <b>px</b> suffix: e.g. <b>letter-spacing=2px</b>.

           See also: <b>horizontal-letter-offset</b>.

           Default: <u>0</u>.

       <b>horizontal-letter-offset</b>, <b>vertical-letter-offset</b>
           Configure the horizontal and vertical offsets used when positioning glyphs within cells,  in  <u>points</u>,
           relative to the top left corner.

           To specify an offset in <u>pixels</u>, append <b>px</b>: e.g. <b>horizontal-letter-offset=2px</b>.

           Default: <u>0</u>.

       <b>underline-offset</b>
           Use  a  custom  offset  for  underlines. The offset is, by default, in <u>points</u> and relative the font's
           baseline. A positive value positions the  underline  under  the  baseline,  while  a  negative  value
           positions it above the baseline.

           To specify an offset in <u>pixels</u>, append <b>px</b>: <b>underline-offset=2px</b>.

           If  left  unset  (the default), the offset specified in the font is used, or estimated by foot if the
           font lacks underline positioning information.

           Default: <u>unset</u>.

       <b>underline-thickness</b>
           Use a custom thickness (height) for underlines. The thickness is, by default, in <u>points</u>.

           To specify a thickness in <u>pixels</u>, append <b>px</b>: <b>underline-thickness=1px</b>.

           If left unset (the default), the thickness specified in the font is used.

           Default: <u>unset</u>

       <b>strikeout-thickness</b>
           Use a custom thickness (height) for strikeouts. The thickness is, by default, in <u>points</u>.

           To specify a thickness in <u>pixels</u>, append <b>px</b>: <b>strikeout-thickness=1px</b>.

           If left unset (the default), the thickness specified in the font is used.

           Default: <u>unset</u>

       <b>gamma-correct-blending</b>
           Boolean. When enabled, foot will do gamma-correct blending in linear color space. This  is  how  font
           glyphs  are  supposed  to  be  rendered, but since nearly no applications or toolkits are doing it on
           Linux, the result may not look like you are used to.

           Compared to the default (disabled), bright glyphs on a dark background will appear thicker, and  dark
           glyphs on a light background will appear thinner.

           Also  be  aware that many fonts have been developed on systems that do not do gamma-correct blending,
           and may therefore look thicker than intended when rendered with  gamma-correct  blending,  since  the
           font designer set the font weight based on incorrect rendering.

           FreeType  can  limit  the  effect  of  the latter, with a technique called stem darkening. It is only
           available for CFF fonts (OpenType, .otf) and disabled by default (in FreeType). You can enable it  by
           setting the environment variable <b>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES="cff:no-stem-darkening=0"</b> before starting foot.

           You  may  also  want  to  enable  10-bit image buffers when gamma-correct blending is enabled. Though
           probably only if you do not use a transparent background (with 10-bit buffers, you only  get  2  bits
           alpha). See <b>tweak.surface-bit-depth</b>.

           Default: enabled when compositor support is available

       <b>box-drawings-uses-font-glyphs</b>
           Boolean. When disabled, foot generates box/line drawing characters itself. The are several advantages
           to doing this instead of using font glyphs:

               •   No antialiasing effects where e.g. line endpoints appear dimmed down, or blurred.
               •   Line-  and  box  characters  are  guaranteed to span the entire cell, resulting in a gap-less
                   appearance.
               •   No alignment issues, i.e. lines are centered when they should be.
               •   Many fonts lack some, or all, of the line- and box drawing characters, causing fallback fonts
                   to be used, which results in out-of-place looking glyphs (for example, badly sized).

           When enabled, box/line drawing characters are rendered using font glyphs. This may result in  a  more
           uniform look, in some use cases.

           When disabled, foot will render the following Unicode codepoints by itself:

               •   U+02500 - U+0259F
               •   U+02800 - U+028FF
               •   U+1Fb00 - U+1FB9B

           Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>dpi-aware</b>
           Boolean.

           When set to <b>yes</b>, fonts are sized using the monitor's DPI, making a font of a given size have the same
           physical  size,  regardless  of  monitor. In other words, if you drag a foot window between different
           monitors, the font size remains the same.

           In this mode, the monitor's scaling factor is ignored; doubling the scaling factor  will  <b>not</b>  double
           the font size.

           When  set  to <b>no</b>, the monitor's DPI is ignored. The font is instead sized using the monitor's scaling
           factor; doubling the scaling factor <b>does</b> double the font size.

           Note that this option typically does not work with bitmap fonts, which only  contains  a  pre-defined
           set  of  sizes,  and  cannot  be dynamically scaled. Whichever size (of the available ones) that best
           matches the DPI or scaling factor, will be used.

           Also note that if the font size has been specified in pixels (<b>:pixelsize=</b><u>N</u>, instead of <b>:size=</b><u>N</u>),  DPI
           scaling  (<b>dpi-aware=yes</b>)  will  have no effect (the specified pixel size will be used as is). But, if
           the monitor's scaling factor is used to size the font (<b>dpi-aware=no</b>), the font's pixel size  will  be
           multiplied with the scaling factor.

           Default: <u>no</u>

       <b>pad</b>
           Padding between border and glyphs, in pixels (subject to output scaling), in the form <u>XxY</u>.

           This  will add <u>at</u> <u>least</u> X pixels on both the left and right sides, and Y pixels on the top and bottom
           sides. The grid content will be anchored in the top left corner. I.e. if the window manager forces an
           odd window size on foot, the additional pixels will be added to the right and bottom sides.

           To instead center the grid content, append <b>center</b> (e.g. <b>pad=5x5</b> <b>center</b>).

           Default: <u>0x0</u>.

       <b>resize-delay-ms</b>

           Time, in milliseconds, of "idle time" before foot performs text reflow,  and  sends  the  new  window
           dimensions to the client application while doing an interactive resize of a foot window. Idle time in
           this context is a period of time where the window size is not changing.

           In  other  words,  while  you  are  fiddling  with  the  window  size, foot does not send the updated
           dimensions to the client. It also does a fast "truncating" resize of the grid,  instead  of  actually
           reflowing  the  contents.  Only  when  you pause the fiddling for <b>resize-delay-ms</b> milliseconds is the
           client updated, and the contents properly reflowed.

           Emphasis is on <u>while</u> here; as soon as the interactive resize ends (i.e. when you let go of the window
           border), the final dimensions is sent to the client, without any delays.

           Setting it to 0 disables the delay completely.

           Default: <u>100</u>.

       <b>resize-by-cells</b>
           Boolean.

           When set to <b>yes</b>, the window size will be  constrained  to  multiples  of  the  cell  size  (plus  any
           configured  padding).  When  set  to  <b>no</b>,  the  window size will be unconstrained, and padding may be
           adjusted as necessary to accommodate window sizes that are not multiples of the cell size.

           This option only applies to floating windows. Sizes of maxmized, tiled or fullscreen windows will not
           be constrained to multiples of the cell size.

           Default: <u>yes</u>

       <b>resize-keep-grid</b>
           Boolean.

           When set to <b>yes</b>, the window size will  be  adjusted  with  changes  in  font  size  to  preserve  the
           dimensions  of  the text grid. When set to <b>no</b>, the window size will remain constant and the text grid
           will be adjusted as necessary to fit the window.

           This option only applies to floating windows.

           Default: <u>yes</u>

       <b>initial-window-size-pixels</b>
           Initial window width and height in <u>pixels</u> (subject to output scaling), in the form <u>WIDTHxHEIGHT</u>.  The
           height <u>includes</u> the titlebar when using CSDs. Mutually exclusive to <b>initial-window-size-chars</b>.

           Note  that  this option may not work as expected if fractional scaling is being used, due to the fact
           that many compositors do not report the correct scaling factor until after a window has been mapped.

           Default: <u>700x500</u>.

       <b>initial-window-size-chars</b>
           Initial window width and height in <u>characters</u>,  in  the  form  <u>WIDTHxHEIGHT</u>.  Mutually  exclusive  to
           <b>initial-window-size-pixels</b>.'

           Note  that  if you have a multi-monitor setup, with different scaling factors, there is a possibility
           the window size will not be set correctly.  If  that  is  the  case,  use  <b>initial-window-size-pixels</b>
           instead.

           And, just like <b>initial-window-size-pixels</b>, this option may not work as expected if fractional scaling
           is being used (see <b>initial-window-size-pixels</b> for details).

           Default: <u>not</u> <u>set</u>.

       <b>initial-window-mode</b>
           Initial  window  mode  for  each  newly  spawned  window: <b>windowed</b>, <b>maximized</b> or <b>fullscreen</b>. Default:
           <u>windowed</u>.

       <b>title</b>
           Initial window title. Default: <u>foot</u>.

       <b>locked-title</b>
           Boolean. If enabled, applications are not allowed to change the title at run-time. Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>app-id</b>
           Value to set the <b>app-id</b> property on the Wayland window to. The compositor can use this value to  e.g.
           group  multiple windows, or apply window management rules. Default: <u>foot</u> (normal mode), or <u>footclient</u>
           (server mode).

       <b>bold-text-in-bright</b>
           Semi-boolean. When enabled, bold text is rendered in a brighter color (in addition to  using  a  bold
           font). The color is brightened by increasing its luminance.

           If  set to <b>palette-based</b>, rather than a simple <b>yes|true</b>, colors matching one of the 8 regular palette
           colors will be brightened using the corresponding bright palette color.  Other  colors  will  not  be
           brightened.

           Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>word-delimiters</b>
           String of characters that act as word delimiters when selecting text. Note that whitespace characters
           are <u>always</u> word delimiters, regardless of this setting. Default: <u>,│`|:"'()[]{}&lt;&gt;</u>

       <b>selection-target</b>
           Clipboard  target  to  automatically  copy selected text to. One of <b>none</b>, <b>primary</b>, <b>clipboard</b> or <b>both</b>.
           Default: <u>primary</u>.

       <b>workers</b>
           Number of threads to use for rendering. Set to 0 to disable multithreading. Default:  the  number  of
           available  logical  CPUs (including SMT). Note that this is not always the best value. In some cases,
           the number of physical <u>cores</u> is better.

       <b>utmp-helper</b>
           Path to utmp logging helper binary.

           When starting foot, an utmp record is created by launching  the  helper  binary  with  the  following
           arguments:

               add $WAYLAND_DISPLAY

           When  foot  is  closed,  the utmp record is removed by launching the helper binary with the following
           arguments:

               del

           Set to <b>none</b> to disable utmp records. Default: <u><a href="file:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/utempter/utempter">/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/utempter/utempter</a></u>.

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>environment</b></h4><pre>
       This section is used to define environment variables that will be  set  in  the  client  application,  in
       addition to the variables inherited from the terminal process itself.

       The format is simply:

       <b>name</b>=<u>value</u>

       Note: do not set <b>TERM</b> here; use the <b>term</b> option in the main (default) section instead.

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>security</b></h4><pre>
       <b>osc52</b>

           Whether  OSC-52  (clipboard  access)  is  enabled  or disabled. One of <b>disabled</b>, <b>copy-enabled</b>, <b>paste-</b>
           <b>enabled</b> or <b>enabled</b>.

           OSC-52 gives terminal application access to the host clipboard (i.e. the Wayland clipboard). This  is
           normally  not  a  security  issue,  since all applications can access the clipboard directly over the
           Wayland socket.

           However, when SSH:ing into a remote system, or accessing a container etc, the  terminal  applications
           may be untrusted, and you might consider disabling the host clipboard access.

           •   <b>disabled</b>: disables all clipboard access
           •   <b>copy-enabled</b>: applications can write to the clipboard, but not read from it.
           •   <b>paste-enabled</b>: applications can read from the clipboard, but not write to it.
           •   <b>enabled</b>: all applications have full access to the host clipboard. This is the default.

           Default: <u>enabled</u>

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>bell</b></h4><pre>
       <b>system</b>
           Boolean,  when  set  to  <u>yes</u>,  ring the system bell. The bell is rung independent of whether the foot
           window has keyboard focus or not. Exact behavior is compositor dependent.

           Default: <u>yes</u>

       <b>urgent</b>
           Boolean, when set to <u>yes</u>, foot will signal urgency to  the  compositor  through  the  XDG  activation
           protocol whenever <b>BEL</b> is received, and the window does NOT have keyboard focus.

           If the compositor does not implement this protocol, the margins will be painted in red instead.

           Applications  can enable/disable this feature programmatically with the <b>CSI</b> <b>?</b> <b>1042</b> <b>h</b> and <b>CSI</b> <b>?</b> <b>1042</b> <b>l</b>
           escape sequences.

           Default: <u>no</u>

       <b>notify</b>
           Boolean, when set to <u>yes</u>, foot will emit a desktop notification using the command  specified  in  the
           <b>notify</b> option whenever <b>BEL</b> is received. By default, bell notifications are shown only when the window
           does <b>not</b> have keyboard focus. See <u>desktop-notifications.inhibit-when-focused</u>.

           Default: <u>no</u>

       <b>visual</b>
           Boolean, when set to <u>yes</u>, foot will flash the terminal window. Default: <u>no</u>

       <b>command</b>
           When set, foot will execute this command when <b>BEL</b> is received. Default: none

       <b>command-focused</b>
           Boolean, whether to run the command on <b>BEL</b> even while focused. Default: <u>no</u>

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>desktop-notifications</b></h4><pre>
       <b>command</b>
           Command to execute to display a notification.

           Template arguments
               <u>${title}</u>  and  <u>${body}</u>  will  be  replaced with the notification's actual <u>title</u> and <u>body</u> (message
               content).

               <u>${app-id}</u> is replaced with the value of the command line option <u>--app-id</u>, and  defaults  to  <b>foot</b>
               (normal mode), or <b>footclient</b> (server mode).

               <u>${window-title}</u> is replaced with the current window title.

               <u>${icon}</u>  is replaced by the icon specified in the notification request, or the empty string if no
               icon was specified. Can be used with e.g. notify-send's <b>--icon</b> option, or preferably, by  setting
               the <b>image-path</b> hint (with e.g. notify-send's <b>--hint</b> option).

               <u>${category}</u>  is  replaced  by the notification's catogory. Can be used together with e.g. notify-
               send's <b>--category</b> option.

               <u>${urgency}</u> is replaced with the notifications urgency; <b>low</b>,  <b>normal</b>  or  <b>critical</b>.  Can  be  used
               together with e.g. notify-send's <b>--urgency</b> option.

               <u>${expire-time}</u>  is  replaced  with  the  notification specified notification timeout. Can be used
               together with e.g. notify-send's <b>--expire-time</b> option.

               <u>${replace-id}</u>  is  replaced  by  the  notification  daemon  assigned  ID  that  the  notification
               replaces/updates.  For this to work, foot needs to know the externally assigned IDs of previously
               emitted notifications, see the 'stdout' section below. Can be used  together  with  e.g.  notify-
               send's <b>--replace-id</b> option.

               <u>${muted}</u> is replaced by either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>, depending on whether the notification has requested
               all  notification  sounds  be  muted.  It  is  intended to set the <b>suppress-sound</b> hint (with e.g.
               notify-send's <b>--hint</b> option).

               <u>${sound-name}</u> is replaced by sound-name requested by the notification. This should be a name from
               the freedesktop sound naming specification, but this is not something that foot enforces.  It  is
               intended to set the <b>sound-name</b> hint (with e.g. notify-send's <b>--hint</b> option).

               <u>${action-argument}</u>  will be expanded to the <b>command-action-argument</b> option, for each notification
               action. There will always be at least one action, the "default" action. Foot uses this to  enable
               window  focusing,  and  reporting  notification  activation  to  applications that requested such
               events.

               Applications can also define their own  custom  notification  actions.  See  the  <b>command-action-</b>
               <b>argument</b> option for details.

           Ways to trigger notifications
               Applications can trigger notifications in the following ways:

               •   OSC 777: <b>\e]777;notify;&lt;title&gt;;&lt;body&gt;\e\\</b>
               •   OSC  99:  <b>\e]99;;&lt;title&gt;\e\\</b>  (this  is  just a bare bones example; this protocol has lots of
                   features, see https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/desktop-notifications)

               By default, notifications are <b>inhibited</b> if the foot  window  has  keyboard  focus.  See  <u>desktop-</u>
               <u>notifications.inhibit-when-focused</u>.

           Window activation (focusing)
               Foot can focus the window when the notification is 'activated'. It can also send an event back to
               the  client  application, notifying it that the notification has been 'activated', This typically
               happens when the default action is invoked, and/or when the notification is  clicked,  but  exact
               behavior depends on the notification daemon in use, and how it has been configured.

               For  this  to  work,  foot  needs to know when the notification was activated (as opposed to just
               dismissed), and it needs an XDG activation token.

               There are two parts to handle this. First, the notification  must  define  an  action.  For  this
               purpose,  foot  will  add a "default" action to the notification (see the <b>command-action-argument</b>
               option).

               Second, foot needs to know when the notification is activated, and it needs to get  hold  of  the
               XDG activation token.

               Both are expected to be printed on stdout.

               Foot expects the action name (not label) to be printed on a single line. No prefix, no postfix.

               Foot expects the activation token to be printed on a single line, prefixed with <b>xdgtoken=</b>.

               Example:
                   default
                   xdgtoken=18179adf579a7a904ce73754964b1ec3

               The  expected  format  of stdout may change at any time. Please read the changelog when upgrading
               foot.

               <b>Note</b>: notify-send does not, out of the box, support reporting the XDG  activation  token  in  any
               way. This means window activation will not work by default.

           Stdout
               Foot recognizes the following things from the notification helper's stdout:

               •   <u>id</u>: integer in base 10, daemon assigned notification ID
               •   <b>id=</b><u>id</u>: same as plain <u>nnn</u>.
               •   <b>default</b>: the 'default' action was triggered
               •   <b>action=</b><u>default</u>: same as <u>default</u>
               •   <b>action=</b><u>n</u>: application custom action <u>n</u> triggered
               •   <u>n</u>: integer in base 10, appearing after the ID; application custom action <u>n</u> triggered
               •   <b>xdgtoken=</b><u>xyz</u>: XDG activation token.

               Example #1:
                   17
                   action=default
                   xdgtoken=95ebdfe56e4f47ddb5bba9d7dc3a2c35

                   Foot recognizes this as:
                   •   notification has the daemon assigned ID 17
                   •   the user triggered the default action
                   •   the notification send an XDG activation token

               Example #2:
                   17
                   1

                   Foot recognizes this as:
                   •   notification has the daemon assigned ID 17
                   •   the user triggered the first custom action, "1"

               Example #3:
                   id=17
                   1

                   Foot recognizes this as:
                   •   notification has the daemon assigned ID 17
                   •   the user triggered the first custom action, "1

           Default: <u>notify-send</u>
                          <u>--wait</u>
                          <u>--app-name</u>    <u>${app-id}</u>
                          <u>--icon</u>        <u>${app-id}</u>
                          <u>--category</u>    <u>${category}</u>
                          <u>--urgency</u>     <u>${urgency}</u>
                          <u>--expire-time</u> <u>${expire-time}</u>
                          <u>--hint</u>        <u>STRING:image-path:${icon}</u>
                          <u>--hint</u>        <u>BOOLEAN:suppress-sound:${muted}</u>
                          <u>--hint</u>        <u>STRING:sound-name:${sound-name}</u>
                          <u>--replace-id</u>  <u>${replace-id}</u>
                          <u>${action-argument}</u>
                          <u>--print-id</u>
                          <u>--</u> <u>${title}</u> <u>${body}</u>.

       <b>command-action-argument</b>
           String to use with <b>command</b> to enable passing action/button names to the notification helper.

           Foot  will always configure a "default" action that can be used to "activate" the notification, which
           in turn can cause the foot window to be focused, or an escape to be sent to the terminal  application
           (depending on how the application generated the notification).

           Furthermore,  the OSC-99 notifications protocol allows applications to define their own actions. Foot
           uses a combination of the <b>command</b> option, and the <b>command-action-argument</b> option to pass the names of
           the actions to the notification helper.

           This option has the following template arguments:

           •   <u>${action-name}</u>: the name of the action; <b>default</b> for the default action configured by foot, and <u>n</u>,
               where <u>n</u> is an integer &gt;= 1, for application defined actions.
           •   <u>${action-label}</u>: <b>Activate</b> for the default action, and a free-form string for application  defined
               actions.

           For  each  notification action (remember, there will always be at least one), <b>command-action-argument</b>
           will be expanded with the action's name and label.

           Then, <u>${action-argument}</u> is expanded <b>command</b> to the full list of actions.

           If <b>command-action-argument</b> is set to the empty string, no actions will be passed to <b>command</b>. That is,
           <u>${action-argument}</u> will be replaced with the empty string.

           Example:

           <b>command-action-argument=--action</b> <b>${action-name}=${action-label}</b>
           <b>command=notify-send</b> <b>${action-argument}</b> <b>...</b>

           Assume the application defined two custom actions: <b>OK</b> and <b>Cancel</b>.

           Given the above, foot will execute:

               notify-send
                              --action default='Click to activate'
                              --action 1=OK
                              --action 2=Cancel
                              ...

           Default: <u>--action</u> <u>${action-name}=${action-label}</u>

       <b>close</b>
           Command to execute to close an existing notification.

           <u>${id}</u> is expanded to the ID of the notification that should be closed. For example:

               fyi --close ${id}

           Closing a notification is only supported by the Kitty Desktop Notification protocol, OSC-99.

           If set to the empty string (the default), foot will instead try to close the notification by  sending
           SIGINT  to  the  notification  helper  process.  For example, <b>notify-send</b> <b>--wait</b> (libnotify &gt;= 0.8.0)
           responds to SIGINT by closing the notification.

           Default: <u>not</u> <u>set</u>

       <b>inhibit-when-focused</b>
           Boolean. If enabled, foot will not display notifications if the terminal window has keyboard focus.

           Default: <u>yes</u>

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>scrollback</b></h4><pre>
       <b>lines</b>
           Number of scrollback lines. The maximum number of allocated lines will be this value plus the  number
           of visible lines, rounded up to the nearest power of 2. Default: <u>1000</u>.

       <b>multiplier</b>
           Amount to multiply mouse scrolling with. It is a decimal number, i.e. fractions are allowed. Default:
           <u>3.0</u>.

       <b>indicator-position</b>
           Configures  the  style  of  the  scrollback  position indicator. One of <b>none</b>, <b>fixed</b> or <b>relative</b>. <b>none</b>
           disables the indicator completely. <b>fixed</b> always renders the indicator near the top of the window, and
           <b>relative</b> renders the indicator at the position corresponding  to  the  current  scrollback  position.
           Default: <u>relative</u>.

       <b>indicator-format</b>
           Which  format to use when displaying the scrollback position indicator. Either <u>percentage</u>, <u>line</u>, or a
           custom fixed string. This option is ignored if <b>indicator-position=none</b>. Default: <u>empty</u> <u>string</u>.

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>url</b></h4><pre>
       Note that you can also add custom regular expressions, see the 'regex' section.

       <b>launch</b>
           Command to execute when opening URLs. <u>${url}</u> will be replaced with the actual URL. Default:  <u>xdg-open</u>
           <u>${url}</u>.

       <b>osc8-underline</b>
           When to underline OSC-8 URLs. Possible values are <b>url-mode</b> and <b>always</b>.

           When set to <b>url-mode</b>, OSC-8 URLs are only highlighted in URL mode, just like auto-detected URLs.

           When  set  to  <b>always</b>, OSC-8 URLs are always highlighted, regardless of their other attributes (bold,
           italic etc). Note that this does <u>not</u> make them clickable.

           Default: <u>url-mode</u>

       <b>label-letters</b>
           String of characters to use when generating key sequences for URL jump labels.

           If you change this option to include  the  letter  <b>t</b>,  you  should  also  change  the  default  <b>[url-</b>
           <b>bindings].toggle-url-visible</b> key binding to avoid a clash.

           Default: <u>sadfjklewcmpgh</u>.

       <b>regex</b>
           Regular   expression  to  use  when  auto-detecting  URLs.  The  format  is  "POSIX-Extended  Regular
           Expressions". Note that the first marked subexpression is used as the URL. In  other  words,  if  you
           want  the  whole  regex  match  to  be  used  as an URL, surround all of it with parenthesis: <b>(regex-</b>
           <b>pattern)</b>.

           Default:                                                             <u>(([a-z][[:alnum:]-]+:(/{1,3}|[a-</u>
           <u>z0-9%])|www[:digit:]{0,3}[.])([^[:space:](){}&lt;&gt;]+|(([^[:space:](){}&lt;&gt;]+|(([^[:space:](){}&lt;&gt;]+)))*)|[([^][[:space:](){}&lt;&gt;]+|([[^][[:space:](){}&lt;&gt;]+]))*])+((([^[:space:](){}&lt;&gt;]+|(([^[:space:](){}&lt;&gt;]+)))*)|[([^][[:space:](){}&lt;&gt;]+|([[^][[:space:](){}&lt;&gt;]+]))*]|[^][[:space:]`!(){};:'".,&lt;&gt;?«»“”‘’]))</u>

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>regex</b></h4><pre>
       Similar to the 'url' mode, but with custom defined regular expressions (and launchers).

       To  use  a  custom defined regular expression, you also need to add a key binding for it. This is done in
       the <b>key-binding</b> section, see below for details. For example, a regex to detect  hash  digests  (e.g.  git
       commit hashes) could look like:

           [regex:hashes]
           regex=([a-fA-F0-9]{7,128})
           launch=path-to-script-or-application ${match}

           [key-bindings]
           regex-launch=[hashes] Control+Shift+q
           regex-copy=[hashes] Control+Mod1+Shift+q

       <b>launch</b>
           Command  to  execute  when  "launching" a regex match. <u>${match}</u> will be replaced with the actual URL.
           Default: <u>not</u> <u>set</u>.

       <b>regex</b>
           Regular expression to use when matching text. The format  is  "POSIX-Extended  Regular  Expressions".
           Note  that the first marked subexpression is used as the match. In other words, if you want the whole
           regex match to be used, surround all of it with parenthesis: <b>(regex-pattern)</b>.

           Default: <u>not</u> <u>set</u>.

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>cursor</b></h4><pre>
       This section controls the cursor style and color. Note that applications can change these at runtime.

       <b>style</b>
           Configures the default cursor style, and is one of: <b>block</b>, <b>beam</b>, <b>underline</b> or <b>hollow</b>. Note that  this
           can be overridden by applications. Default: <u>block</u>.

       <b>unfocused-style</b>
           Configures how the cursor is rendered when the terminal window is unfocused. Possible values are:

           •   unchanged: render cursor in exactly the same way as when the window has focus.
           •   hollow: render a block cursor, but hollowed out.
           •   none: do not display any cursor at all.

       <b>blink</b>
           Boolean.  Enables  blinking cursor. Note that this can be overridden by applications. Related option:
           <b>blink-rate</b>. Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>blink-rate</b>
           The rate at which the cursor blink, when cursor blinking has been enabled. Expressed in  milliseconds
           between each blink. Default: <u>500</u>.

       <b>color</b>
           Two  space separated RRGGBB values (i.e. plain old 6-digit hex values, without prefix) specifying the
           foreground (text) and background (cursor) colors for the cursor.

           Example: <b>ff0000</b> <b>00ff00</b> (green cursor, red text)

           Default: the regular foreground and background colors, reversed.

       <b>beam-thickness</b>
           Thickness (width) of the beam styled cursor. The value is in points, and its exact value thus depends
           on the monitor's DPI. To instead specify a thickness  in  pixels,  use  the  <b>px</b>  suffix:  e.g.  <b>beam-</b>
           <b>thickness=2px</b>. Default: <u>1.5</u>

       <b>underline-thickness</b>
           Thickness  (height)  of the underline styled cursor. The value is in points, and its exact value thus
           depends on the monitor's DPI.

           To instead specify a thickness in pixels, use the <b>px</b> suffix: e.g. <b>underline-thickness=2px</b>.

           Note that if left unset, the cursor's thickness will scale with the font size, while if set, the size
           is fixed.

           Default: <u>font</u> <u>underline</u> <u>thickness</u>.

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>mouse</b></h4><pre>
       <b>hide-when-typing</b>
           Boolean. When enabled, the mouse cursor is hidden while typing. Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>alternate-scroll-mode</b>
           Boolean. This option controls the initial value for the <u>alternate</u> <u>scroll</u>  <u>mode</u>.  When  this  mode  is
           enabled,  mouse  scroll  events  are  translated  to <u>up</u>/<u>down</u> key events when displaying the alternate
           screen.

           This lets you scroll with the mouse in e.g. pagers (like <u>less</u>) without enabling native mouse  support
           in them.

           Alternate scrolling is <b>not</b> used if the application enables native mouse support.

           This  option  can  be  modified  by  applications at run-time using the escape sequences <b>CSI</b> <b>?</b> <b>1007</b> <b>h</b>
           (enable) and <b>CSI</b> <b>?</b> <b>1007</b> <b>l</b> (disable).

           Default: <u>yes</u>.

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>touch</b></h4><pre>
       <b>long-press-delay</b>
           Number of milliseconds to distinguish between a short press and a long press on the touchscreen.

           Default: <u>400</u>.

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>colors</b></h4><pre>
       This section controls the 16 ANSI colors, the default foreground and background colors, and the  extended
       256 color palette. Note that applications can change these at runtime.

       The colors are in RRGGBB format (i.e. plain old 6-digit hex values, without prefix). That is, they do <b>not</b>
       have an alpha component. You can configure the background transparency with the <u>alpha</u> option.

       <b>foreground</b>
           Default foreground color. This is the color used when no ANSI color is being used. Default: <u>839496</u>.

       <b>background</b>
           Default background color. This is the color used when no ANSI color is being used. Default: <u>002b36</u>.

       <b>regular0</b>, <b>regular1</b> <b>..</b> <b>regular7</b>
           The eight basic ANSI colors (Black, Red, Green, Yellow, Blue, Magenta, Cyan, White). Default: <u>242424</u>,
           <u>f62b5a</u>, <u>47b413</u>, <u>e3c401</u>, <u>24acd4</u>, <u>f2affd</u>, <u>13c299</u>, <u>e6e6e6</u> (starlight theme, V4).

       <b>bright0</b>, <b>bright1</b> <b>..</b> <b>bright7</b>
           The  eight  bright  ANSI  colors  (Black,  Red,  Green, Yellow, Blue, Magenta, Cyan, White). Default:
           <u>616161</u>, <u>ff4d51</u>, <u>35d450</u>, <u>e9e836</u>, <u>5dc5f8</u>, <u>feabf2</u>, <u>24dfc4</u>, <u>ffffff</u> (starlight theme, V4).

       <b>dim0</b>, <b>dim1</b> <b>..</b> <b>dim7</b>
           Custom colors to use with dimmed colors. Dimmed colors do not have an entry  in  the  color  palette.
           Applications emit them by combining a color value, and a "dim" attribute.

           By  default,  foot  implements this by reducing the luminance of the current color. This is a generic
           approach that applies to both colors from the 256-color palette, as well as 24-bit RGB colors.

           You can change this behavior by setting the <b>dimN</b> options. When set, foot will match the current color
           against the color palette, and if it matches one of the <b>regularN</b> colors, the corresponding <b>dimN</b> color
           will be used.

           If instead the current color matches one of the <b>brightN</b> colors, the corresponding <b>regularN</b> color will
           be used.

           If the current color does not match any known color, it is dimmed by reducing the luminance (i.e. the
           same behavior as if the <b>dimN</b> options are unconfigured). 24-bit RGB colors will  typically  fall  into
           this category.

           Note  that  applications can change the <b>regularN</b> and <b>brightN</b> colors at runtime. However, they have no
           way of changing the <b>dimN</b> colors. If an application has changed the <b>regularN</b> colors, foot  will  still
           use the corresponding <b>dimN</b> color, as configured in foot.ini.

           Default: <u>not</u> <u>set</u>.

       <b>0</b> <b>..</b> <b>255</b>
           Arbitrary  colors  in  the  256-color  palette. Default: for <b>0</b> <b>..</b> <b>15</b>, see regular and bright defaults
           above; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#8-bit for an explanation of the remainder.

       <b>sixel0</b> <b>..</b> <b>sixel15</b>
           The default sixel color palette. Default: <u>000000</u>, <u>3333cc</u>, <u>cc2121</u>,  <u>33cc33</u>,  <u>cc33cc</u>,  <u>33cccc</u>,  <u>cccc33</u>,
           <u>878787</u>, <u>424242</u>, <u>545499</u>, <u>994242</u>, <u>549954</u>, <u>995499</u>, <u>549999</u>, <u>999954</u>, <u>cccccc</u>.

       <b>alpha</b>
           Background  translucency.  A  value in the range 0.0-1.0, where 0.0 means completely transparent, and
           1.0 is opaque. Default: <u>1.0</u>.

       <b>selection-foreground</b>, <b>selection-background</b>
           Foreground (text) and background color to use in selected text. Note that <b>both</b> options must  be  set,
           or the default will be used. Default: <u>inverse</u> <u>foreground/background</u>.

       <b>jump-labels</b>
           Two  color  values  specifying the foreground (text) and background colors to use when rendering jump
           labels in URL mode. Default: <u>regular0</u> <u>regular3</u>.

       <b>scrollback-indicator</b>
           Two color values specifying the foreground (text) and background (indicator itself)  colors  for  the
           scrollback indicator. Default: <u>regular0</u> <u>bright4</u>.

       <b>search-box-no-match</b>
           Two  color  values  specifying  the foreground (text) and background colors for the scrollback search
           box, when there are no matches. Default: <u>regular0</u> <u>regular1</u>.

       <b>search-box-match</b>
           Two color values specifying the foreground (text) and background colors  for  the  scrollback  search
           box, when the search box is either empty, or there are matches. Default: <u>regular0</u> <u>regular3</u>.

       <b>urls</b>
           Color to use for the underline used to highlight URLs in URL mode. Default: <u>regular3</u>.

       <b>flash</b>
           Color to use for the terminal window flash. Default: <u>7f7f00</u>.

       <b>flash-alpha</b>
           Flash  translucency. A value in the range 0.0-1.0, where 0.0 means completely transparent, and 1.0 is
           opaque. Default: <u>0.5</u>.

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>csd</b></h4><pre>
       This section controls the look of the <u>CSDs</u> (Client Side Decorations). Note that the default is to <b>not</b> use
       CSDs, but instead to use <u>SSDs</u> (Server Side Decorations) when the compositor supports it.

       Note that unlike the colors defined in the <u>colors</u> section, the color values here are  in  AARRGGBB  (i.e.
       plain  old  8-digit  hex  values)  format.  I.e.  they  contain  an alpha component - 00 means completely
       transparent, and ff fully opaque.

       Examples:

       •   ffffffff: white, fully opaque
       •   ff000000: black, fully opaque
       •   7fffffff: white, semi-transparent
       •   ff00ff00: green, fully opaque

       <b>preferred</b>
           Which type of window decorations to prefer: <b>client</b> (CSD), <b>server</b> (SSD) or <b>none</b>.

           Note that this is only a hint to the compositor. Depending on compositor support, and how it has been
           configured, it may instruct foot to use CSDs even though this option  has  been  set  to  <b>server</b>,  or
           render SSDs despite <b>client</b> or <b>none</b> being set.

           Default: <u>server</u>.

       <b>size</b>
           Height,  in  pixels  (subject  to  output  scaling),  of  the titlebar. Setting it to 0 will hide the
           titlebar, while still showing the border (if <b>border-width</b> is set to a non-zero value). Default: <u>26</u>.

       <b>color</b>
           Titlebar color. Default: use the default <u>foreground</u> color.

       <b>font</b>
           Font to use for the title bar. This is a list of fonts, similar to the main <b>font</b>  option.  Note  that
           the font will be sized using the title bar size. That is, all <b>:size</b> and <b>:pixelsize</b> attributes will be
           ignored. Default: <u>primary</u> <u>font</u>.

       <b>hide-when-maximized</b>
           Boolean.  When  enabled,  the  CSD  titlebar  is  hidden when the window is maximized. The completely
           disable the titlebar, set <b>size</b> to 0 instead. Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>double-click-to-maximize</b>
           Boolean. When enabled, double-clicking the CSD titlebar will (un)maximize the window. Default: <u>yes</u>.

       <b>border-width</b>
           Width of the border, in pixels (subject to output scaling). Note  that  the  border  encompasses  the
           entire window, including the title bar. Default: <u>0</u>.

       <b>border-color</b>
           Color  of  border.  By default, the title bar color is used. If the title bar color has not been set,
           the default foreground color (from the color scheme) is used. Default: <u>titlebar</u> <u>color</u>.

       <b>button-width</b>
           Width, in pixels (subject to output scaling), of the minimize/maximize/close buttons. Default: <u>26</u>.

       <b>button-color</b>
           Foreground color on the minimize/maximize/close buttons. Default: use the default <u>background</u> color.

       <b>button-minimize-color</b>
           Minimize button's background color. Default: use the default <u>regular4</u> color (blue).

       <b>button-maximize-color</b>
           Maximize button's background color. Default: use the default <u>regular2</u> color (green).

       <b>button-close-color</b>
           Close button's background color. Default: use the default <u>regular1</u> color (red).

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>key-bindings</b></h4><pre>
       This section lets you override the default key bindings.

       The general format is <u>action=combo1...comboN</u>. That is, each action may have one or more key combinations,
       space separated. Each combination is in the form <u>mod1+mod2+key</u>. The names of the modifiers  and  the  key
       <b>must</b> be valid XKB key names.

       Note  that  if  <b>Shift</b>  is  one  of  the  modifiers,  the  <u>key</u>  <b>must</b>  <b>not</b>  be  in upper case. For example,
       <b>Control+Shift+V</b> will never trigger, but <b>Control+Shift+v</b> will.

       Note that <b>Alt</b> is usually called <b>Mod1</b>.

       <b>xkbcli</b> <b>interactive-wayland</b> can be useful for finding keysym names.

       When matching key presses to key bindings, foot uses a couple of different approaches.

       As an example, let's say you press ctrl+shift+c (assume plain  us  ASCII  layout).  XKB  will  tell  foot
       <b>Control+C</b>  was  pressed. Note the lack of the shift modifier, and the upper case 'C'. Internally, this is
       called the "translated" form, and is what foot tries to match first.

       If no "translated" key bindings can be found, foot proceeds to checking the "untranslated" variant. Using
       the same example as above, this will match <b>Control+Shift+c</b> (shift modifier present, lower case 'c').

       This means you can use either form in your foot configuration,  and  that  <b>Control+C</b>  (and  similar)  has
       higher  priority  than  <b>Control+Shift+c</b>.  Also  note  that  while  foot  normally  detects  when the same
       combination is assigned to multiple actions, it will not detect <b>Control+C</b> vs. <b>Control+Shift+c</b> collisions.
       Call it a known bug...

       Finally, foot tries to match the raw key code. Here, the primary layout is queried for all key codes that
       generate a particular XKB symbol, and the pressed key's code is matched against this. For example, if you
       use the layouts <b>"us,de(neo)"</b>, the 'r' key generates the symbol 'c' in the neo layout. I.e. to get a  'c',
       you  press  'r'. The match logic described above will only match 'c' key bindings (e.g. <b>Control+Shift+c</b>).
       The raw mode however, will match 'r' key bindings (e.g. <b>Control+Shift+r</b>). This is  useful  for  non-latin
       layouts, where you would otherwise have to customize all key bindings.

       A  key  combination  can  only  be  mapped  to  <b>one</b> action. Let's say you want to bind <b>Control+Shift+R</b> to
       <b>fullscreen</b>. Since this is the default shortcut for <b>search-start</b>, you first  need  to  unmap  the  default
       binding. This can be done by setting <u>action=none</u>; e.g. <b>search-start=none</b>.

       <b>noop</b>
           All key combinations listed here will not be sent to the application. Default: <u>none</u>.

       <b>scrollback-up-page</b>
           Scrolls up/back one page in history. Default: <u>Shift+Page_Up</u> <u>Shift+KP_Page_Up</u>.

       <b>scrollback-down-half-page</b>
           Scroll down/forward half of a page in history. Default: <u>none</u>.

       <b>scrollback-down-line</b>
           Scroll down/forward a single line in history. Default: <u>none</u>.

       <b>scrollback-home</b>
           Scroll to the beginning of the scrollback. Default: <u>none</u>.

       <b>scrollback-end</b>
           Scroll to the end (bottom) of the scrollback. Default: <u>none</u>.

       <b>clipboard-copy</b>
           Copies the current selection into the <u>clipboard</u>. Default: <u>Control+Shift+c</u> <u>XF86Copy</u>.

       <b>clipboard-paste</b>
           Pastes from the <u>clipboard</u>. Default: <u>Control+Shift+v</u> <u>XF86Paste</u>.

       <b>primary-paste</b>
           Pastes from the <u>primary</u> <u>selection</u>. Default: <u>Shift+Insert</u> (also defined in <b>mouse-bindings</b>).

       <b>search-start</b>
           Starts a scrollback/history search. Default: <u>Control+Shift+r</u>.

       <b>font-increase</b>
           Increases the font size by 0.5pt. Default: <u>Control+plus</u> <u>Control+equal</u> <u>Control+KP_Add</u> (also defined in
           <b>mouse-bindings</b>).

       <b>font-decrease</b>
           Decreases  the font size by 0.5pt. Default: <u>Control+minus</u> <u>Control+KP_Subtract</u> (also defined in <b>mouse-</b>
           <b>bindings</b>).

       <b>font-reset</b>
           Resets the font size to the default. Default: <u>Control+0</u> <u>Control+KP_0</u>.

       <b>spawn-terminal</b>
           Spawns a new terminal. If the shell has been configured to emit the OSC 7 escape  sequence,  the  new
           terminal will start in the current working directory. Default: <u>Control+Shift+n</u>.

       <b>minimize</b>
           Minimizes the window. Default: <u>none</u>.

       <b>maximize</b>
           Toggle the maximized state. Default: <u>none</u>.

       <b>fullscreen</b>
           Toggles the fullscreen state. Default: <u>none</u>.

       <b>pipe-visible</b>, <b>pipe-scrollback</b>, <b>pipe-selected</b>, <b>pipe-command-output</b>
           Pipes  the  currently  visible  text, the entire scrollback, the currently selected text, or the last
           command's output to an external tool. The syntax for this option is a bit special; the first part  of
           the value is the command to execute enclosed in "[]", followed by the binding(s).

           You  can  configure  multiple pipes as long as the command strings are different and the key bindings
           are unique.

           Note that the command is <b>not</b> automatically run inside a shell; use <b>sh</b> <b>-c</b> <b>"command</b> <b>line"</b> if  you  need
           that.

           Example #1:
               #  Extract currently visible URLs, let user choose one (via fuzzel), then launch firefox with the
               selected URL
               <b>pipe-visible=[sh</b> <b>-c</b> <b>"xurls</b> <b>|</b> <b>uniq</b> <b>|</b> <b>tac</b> <b>|</b> <b>fuzzel</b> <b>|</b> <b>xargs</b> <b>-r</b> <b>firefox"]</b> <b>Control+Print</b>

           Example #2:
               # Open scrollback contents in Emacs running in a new foot instance
               <b>pipe-scrollback=[sh</b> <b>-c</b>  <b>"f=$(mktemp)</b>  <b>&amp;&amp;</b>  <b>cat</b>  <b>-</b>  <b>&gt;</b>  <b>$f</b>  <b>&amp;&amp;</b>  <b>foot</b>  <b>emacsclient</b>  <b>-t</b>  <b>$f;</b>  <b>rm</b>  <b>$f"]</b>
               <b>Control+Shift+Print</b>

           Default: <u>none</u>

       <b>show-urls-launch</b>
           Enter  URL  mode,  where  all currently visible URLs are tagged with a jump label with a key sequence
           that will open the URL (and exit URL mode). Default: <u>Control+Shift+o</u>.

       <b>show-urls-persistent</b>
           Similar to <b>show-urls-launch</b>, but does not automatically  exit  URL  mode  after  activating  an  URL.
           Default: <u>none</u>.

       <b>show-urls-copy</b>
           Enter  URL  mode,  where  all currently visible URLs are tagged with a jump label with a key sequence
           that will place the URL in the clipboard. Default: <u>none</u>.

       <b>regex-launch</b>
           Enter regex mode. This works exactly the same as URL mode; all regex matches are tagged with  a  jump
           label with a key sequence that will "launch" to match (and exit regex mode).

           The name of the regex section must be specified in the key binding:

               [regex:hashes]
               regex=([a-fA-F0-9]{7,128})
               launch=path-to-script-or-application ${match}

               [key-bindings]
               regex-launch=[hashes] Control+Shift+q
               regex-copy=[hashes] Control+Mod1+Shift+q

           Default: <u>none</u>.

       <b>regex-copy</b>
           Same as <b>regex-copy</b>, but the match is placed in the clipboard, instead of "launched", upon activation.
           Default: <u>none</u>.

       <b>prompt-prev</b>
           Jump  to  the  previous,  currently  not  visible,  prompt (requires shell integration, see <b><a href="../man1/foot.1.html">foot</a></b>(1)).
           Default: <u>Control+Shift+z</u>.

       <b>prompt-next</b>
           Jump the next prompt (requires shell integration, see <b><a href="../man1/foot.1.html">foot</a></b>(1)). Default: <u>Control+Shift+x</u>.

       <b>unicode-input</b>
           Input a Unicode character by typing its codepoint in hexadecimal, followed by <b>Enter</b> or <b>Space</b>.

           For example, to input the character <u>ö</u> (LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH DIAERESIS, Unicode codepoint  0xf6),
           you would first activate this key binding, then type: <b>f</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>Enter</b>.

           Another  example:  to  input  😍  (SMILING  FACE  WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES, Unicode codepoint 0x1f60d),
           activate this key binding, then type: <b>1</b>, <b>f</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>0</b>, <b>d</b>, <b>Enter</b>.

           Recognized key bindings in Unicode input mode:

           •   Enter, Space: commit the Unicode character, then exit this mode.
           •   Escape, q, Ctrl+c, Ctrl+d, Ctrl+g: abort input, then exit this mode.
           •   0-9, a-f: append next digit to the Unicode's codepoint.
           •   Backspace: undo the last digit.

           Note that there is no visual feedback while in this mode. This is by  design;  foot's  Unicode  input
           mode  is considered to be a fallback. The preferred way of entering Unicode characters, emojis etc is
           by using an IME.

           Default: <u>Control+Shift+u</u>.

       <b>quit</b>
           Quit foot. Default: <u>none</u>.

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>search-bindings</b></h4><pre>
       This section lets you override the default key bindings used in scrollback search  mode.  The  syntax  is
       exactly the same as the regular key-bindings.

       <b>cancel</b>
           Aborts  the  search.  The  viewport  is  restored  and the <u>primary</u> <u>selection</u> is not updated. Default:

       <b>commit</b>
           Exit search mode and copy current selection into the <u>primary</u> <u>selection</u>. Viewport is not restored.  To
           copy the selection to the regular <u>clipboard</u>, use <b>Control+Shift+c</b>. Default: <u>Return</u> <u>KP_Enter</u>.

       <b>find-prev</b>
           Search backwards in the scrollback history for the next match. Default: <u>Control+r</u>.

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>url-bindings</b></h4><pre>
       This  section lets you override the default key bindings used in URL mode. The syntax is exactly the same
       as the regular key-bindings.

       Be careful; do not use single-letter keys that are also used in <b>[url].label-letters</b>,  as  doing  so  will
       make some URLs inaccessible.

       <b>cancel</b>
           Exits URL mode without opening a URL. Default: <u>Control+g</u> <u>Control+c</u> <u>Control+d</u> <u>Escape</u>.

       <b>toggle-url-visible</b>
           By  default, the jump label only shows the key sequence required to activate it. This is fine as long
           as the URL is visible in the original text.

           But with e.g. OSC-8 URLs (the terminal version of HTML anchors, i.e. "links"), the text on the screen
           can be something completely different than the URL.

           This action toggles between showing and hiding the URL on the jump label.

           Default: <u>t</u>.

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>text-bindings</b></h4><pre>
       This section lets you remap key combinations to custom escape sequences.

       The format is <u>text=combo1...comboN</u>. That is, the string to emit may have one or  more  key  combinations,
       space  separated.  Each  combination is in the form <u>mod1+mod2+key</u>. The names of the modifiers and the key
       <b>must</b> be valid XKB key names.

       The text string specifies the characters, or bytes, to emit when the associated  key  combination(s)  are
       pressed. There are two ways to specify a character:

       •   Normal, printable characters are written as-is: <b>abcdef</b>.
       •   Bytes (e.g. ESC) are written as two-digit hexadecimal numbers, with a <b>\x</b> prefix: <b>\x1b</b>.

       Example: you would like to remap <u>Super+k</u> to the <u>Up</u> key.

       The  escape  sequence  for  the  Up key is <u>ESC</u> <u>[</u> <u>A</u> (without the spaces). Thus, we need to specify this in
       foot.ini (<b>Mod4</b> is the XKB name for the Super/logo key):

       <b>\x1b[A</b> <b>=</b> <b>Mod4+k</b>

       Another example: to remap <u>Super+c</u> to <u>Control+c</u>:

       <b>\x03</b> <b>=</b> <b>Mod4+c</b>

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>mouse-bindings</b></h4><pre>
       This section lets you override the default mouse bindings.

       The general format is <u>action=combo1...comboN</u>. That is, each action may have one or more key combinations,
       space separated. Each combination is in the form <u>mod1+mod2+BTN_&lt;name&gt;[-COUNT]</u>. The names of the modifiers
       <b>must</b> be valid XKB key names, and the button name <b>must</b> be a valid libinput name. You can find  the  button
       names using <b>libinput</b> <b>debug-events</b>.

       The  trailing  <b>COUNT</b>  (number  of times the button has to be clicked) is optional and specifies the click
       count required to trigger the binding. The default if <b>COUNT</b> is omitted is <u>1</u>.

       To map wheel events (i.e. scrolling), use the button  names  <b>BTN_WHEEL_BACK</b>  (up)  and  <b>BTN_WHEEL_FORWARD</b>
       (down).  Note  that  these  events  never  generate a <b>COUNT</b> larger than 1. That is, <b>BTN_WHEEL_BACK+2</b>, for
       example, will never trigger.

       Foot also recognizes tiltable wheels; to map these, use <b>BTN_WHEEL_LEFT</b> and <b>BTN_WHEEL_RIGHT</b>.

       A modifier+button combination can only be mapped to <b>one</b> action. Let's say you want to bind <b>BTN_MIDDLE</b>  to
       <b>fullscreen</b>.  Since  <b>BTN_MIDDLE</b>  is  the  default  binding  for <b>primary-paste</b>, you first need to unmap the
       default binding. This can be done by setting <u>action=none</u>; e.g. <b>primary-paste=none</b>.

       <b>selection-override-modifiers</b>
           The modifiers set in this set (which may be set to any combination of modifiers, e.g. <u>mod1+mod2+mod3</u>,
           as well as <u>none</u>) are used to enable selecting text with the mouse irrespective of  whether  a  client
           application  currently  has  the  mouse grabbed. These modifiers cannot be used as modifiers in mouse
           bindings. Because the order of bindings is significant, it is best to set this  prior  to  any  other
           mouse bindings that might use modifiers in the default set. Default: <u>Shift</u>

       The  actions  to  which mouse combos can be bound are listed below. All actions listed under <b>key-bindings</b>
       can be used here as well.

       <b>scrollback-up-mouse</b>
           Normal screen: scrolls up the contents.

           Alt screen: send fake <u>KeyUP</u> events to the client application, if alternate scroll mode is enabled.

           Default: <u>BTN_WHEEL_BACK</u>

       <b>scrollback-down-mouse</b>
           Normal screen: scrolls down the contents.

           Alt screen: send fake <u>KeyDOWN</u> events to the client application, if alternate scroll mode is enabled.

           Default: <u>BTN_WHEEL_FORWARD</u>

       <b>select-begin</b>
           Begin an interactive selection. The selection is finalized, and copied to the <u>primary</u> <u>selection</u>, when
           the button is released. Default: <u>BTN_LEFT</u>.

       <b>select-begin-block</b>
           Begin an interactive block  selection.  The  selection  is  finalized,  and  copied  to  the  <u>primary</u>
           <u>selection</u>, when the button is released. Default: <u>Control+BTN_LEFT</u>.

       <b>select-word</b>
           Begin  an interactive word-wise selection, where words are separated by whitespace and all characters
           defined by the <b>word-delimiters</b> option.  The  selection  is  finalized,  and  copied  to  the  <u>primary</u>
           <u>selection</u>, when the button is released. Default: <u>BTN_LEFT-2</u>.

       <b>select-word-whitespace</b>
           Same  as  <b>select-word</b>,  but  the  characters  in  the  <b>word-delimiters</b>  option  are ignored. I.e only
           whitespace characters act as delimiters. The selection  is  finalized,  and  copied  to  the  <u>primary</u>
           <u>selection</u>, when the button is released. Default: <u>Control+BTN_LEFT-2</u>.

       <b>select-quote</b>
           Begin  an  interactive  "quote"  selection. This is similar to <b>select-word</b>, except an entire quote is
           selected (that is, everything inside the quote, excluding the  quote  characters).  Recognized  quote
           characters are: <b>"</b> and <b>'</b>.

           If a complete quote cannot be found on the current logical row (only one quote character, or none are
           found), the entire row is selected.

           The selection is finalized, and copied to the <u>primary</u> <u>selection</u>, when the button is released.

           After the initial selection has been made, it behaves like a normal word, or row selection, depending
           on  whether  a  quote  was  found  or not. This affects what happens when, for example, extending the
           selection.

           Notes:
           •   Escaped quote characters are not supported (<b>"foo</b> <b>\"bar"</b> will match <b>'foo</b> <b>\'</b>, not <b>'foo</b> <b>"bar'</b>).
           •   Foot does not try to handle mismatched quote characters; they will simply not match.
           •   Nested quotes (using different quote characters) are supported.

           Default: <u>BTN_LEFT-3</u>.

       <b>select-row</b>
           Begin an interactive row-wise selection. The selection  is  finalized,  and  copied  to  the  <u>primary</u>
           <u>selection</u>, when the button is released. Default: <u>BTN_LEFT-4</u>.

       <b>select-extend</b>
           Interactively  extend  an existing selection, using the original selection mode (normal, block, word-
           wise or row-wise). The selection is finalized, and copied to the <u>primary</u> <u>selection</u>, when  the  button
           is released. Default: <u>BTN_RIGHT</u>.

       <b>select-extend-character-wise</b>
           Same  as <b>select-extend</b>, but forces the selection mode to <u>normal</u> (i.e. character wise). Note that this
           causes subsequent <b>select-extend</b> operations to be character wise. This action  is  ignored  for  block
           selections. Default: <u>Control+BTN_RIGHT</u>.

       <b>primary-paste</b>
           Pastes from the <u>primary</u> <u>selection</u>. Default: <u>BTN_MIDDLE</u>.

       <b>font-increase</b>
           Increases the font size by 0.5pt. Default: <u>Control+BTN_WHEEL_BACK</u> (also defined in <b>key-bindings</b>).

       <b>font-decrease</b>
           Decreases the font size by 0.5pt. Default: <u>Control+BTN_WHEEL_FORWARD</u> (also defined in <b>key-bindings</b>).

</pre><h4><b>TWEAK</b></h4><pre>
       This  section  is for advanced users and describes configuration options that can be used to tweak foot's
       low-level behavior.

       These options are <b>not</b> included in the example configuration. You  should  not  change  these  unless  you
       understand what they do.

       Note that these options may change, or be removed at any time, without prior notice.

       When reporting bugs, please mention if, and to what, you have changed any of these options.

       <b>scaling-filter</b>
           Overrides the default scaling filter used when down-scaling bitmap fonts (e.g. emoji fonts). Possible
           values  are  <b>none</b>,  <b>nearest</b>,  <b>bilinear</b>,  <b>impulse</b>,  <b>box</b>, <b>linear</b>, <b>cubic</b> <b>gaussian</b>, <b>lanczos2</b>, <b>lanczos3</b> or
           <b>lanczos3-stretched</b>.

           Default: <u>lanczos3</u>.

       <b>overflowing-glyphs</b>
           Boolean. When enabled, glyphs wider than their cell(s) are allowed  to  render  into  one  additional
           neighbouring cell.

           One  use  case for this are fonts with wide italic characters that "bend" into the next cell. Without
           this option, such glyphs will appear "cut off".

           Another use case are fonts with "icon" characters in the Unicode private usage area, e.g. Nerd Fonts,
           or Powerline Fonts and legacy emoji characters like <b>WHITE</b> <b>FROWNING</b> <b>FACE</b>.

           Note: might impact performance depending on the font used. Especially small font sizes can cause many
           overflowing glyphs because of subpixel rendering.

           Default: <u>yes</u>.

       <b>render-timer</b>
           Enables a frame rendering timer, that prints the time it takes to render each frame, in microseconds,
           either on-screen, to stderr, or both. Valid values are <b>none</b>, <b>osd</b>, <b>log</b> and <b>both</b>. Default: <u>none</u>.

       <b>box-drawing-base-thickness</b>
           Line thickness to use for <b>LIGHT</b> box drawing line characters, in points. This value  is  converted  to
           pixels  using  the  monitor's  DPI,  and then multiplied with the cell size. The end result is that a
           larger font (and thus larger cells) result in thicker lines. Default: <u>0.04</u>.

       <b>box-drawing-solid-shades</b>
           Boolean. When enabled, box drawing "shades" (e.g. LIGHT SHADE,  MEDIUM  SHADE  and  DARK  SHADE)  are
           rendered as solid blocks using a darker variant of the current foreground color.

           When  disabled,  they are instead rendered as checker box pattern, using the current foreground color
           as is.

           Default: <u>yes</u>.

       <b>delayed-render-lower</b>, <b>delayed-render-upper</b>
           These two values control the timeouts (in nanoseconds) that  are  used  to  mitigate  screen  flicker
           caused by clients writing large, non-atomic screen updates.

           If  a  client  splits  up  a  screen  update over multiple <b><a href="../man3/write.3.html">write</a></b>(3) calls, we may end up rendering an
           intermediate frame, quickly followed by another frame with the final screen content. For example, the
           client may erase part of the screen (or scroll) in one write, and then write new content  in  one  or
           more  subsequent writes. Rendering the frame when the screen has been erased, but not yet filled with
           new content will be perceived as screen flicker.

           The      <b>real</b>      solution      to      this      is      <u>Application</u>      <u>Synchronized</u>      <u>Updates</u>
           (https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/terminal-wg/specifications/-/merge_requests/2).

           The  problem  with  this is twofold - first, it has not yet been standardized, and thus there are not
           many terminal emulators that implement it (foot <b>does</b> implement it), and second, applications must  be
           patched to use it.

           Until this has happened, foot offers an interim workaround; an attempt to mitigate the screen flicker
           <b>without</b> affecting neither performance nor latency.

           It is based on the fact that the screen is updated at a fixed interval (typically 60Hz). For us, this
           means  it  does  not  matter if we render a new frame at the <b>beginning</b> of a frame interval, or at the
           <b>end</b>. Thus, the goal is to introduce a delay between receiving client data and rendering the resulting
           state, but without causing a frame skip.

           While it should be possible to estimate the  amount  of  time  left  until  the  next  frame,  foot's
           algorithm  is  currently  not  that  advanced, but is based on statistics I guess you could say - the
           delay we introduce is so small that the risk of pushing the frame over to the next frame interval  is
           also very small.

           Now, that was a lot of text. But what is it foot actually does?

           When  receiving client data, it schedules a timer, the <b>delayed-render-lower</b>. If we do not receive any
           more client data before the timer has run out, we render the frame. If however, we  do  receive  more
           data,  the  timer  is  re-scheduled.  That  is,  each time we receive client data, frame rendering is
           delayed another <b>delayed-render-lower</b> nanoseconds.

           Now, while this works very well with most clients, it would be  possible  to  construct  a  malicious
           client  that  keeps writing data at a slow pace. To the user, this would look like foot has frozen as
           we never get to render a new frame. To prevent this, an upper limit is set - <b>delayed-render-upper</b>. If
           this timer runs out, we render the frame regardless of what the client is doing.

           If changing these values, note that the lower timeout <b>must</b> be set lower than the upper  timeout,  but
           that this is not verified by foot. Furthermore, both values must be less than 16ms (that is, 16000000
           nanoseconds).

           You  can  disable  the  feature  altogether  by  setting  either value to 0. In this case, frames are
           rendered "as soon as possible".

           Default: lower=<u>500000</u> (0.5ms), upper=<u>8333333</u> (8.3ms - half a frame interval).

       <b>damage-whole-window</b>
           Boolean. When enabled, foot will 'damage' the entire window each time a frame has been rendered. This
           forces the compositor to redraw the entire window. If disabled, foot will only 'damage' updated rows.

           There is normally <b>no</b> reason to enable this. However, it has been seen to  workaround  an  issue  with
           <u>fractional</u> <u>scaling</u> in <u>Gnome</u>.

           Note  that enabling this option is likely to increase CPU and/or GPU usage (by the compositor, not by
           foot), and may have a negative impact on battery life.

           Default: <u>no</u>.

       <b>grapheme-shaping</b>
           Boolean. When enabled, foot will use <u>utf8proc</u> to  do  grapheme  cluster  segmentation  while  parsing
           "printed"  text.  Then, when rendering, it will use <u>fcft</u> (if compiled with <u>HarfBuzz</u> support) to shape
           the grapheme clusters.

           This is required to render e.g. flag (emoji) sequences, keycap sequences, modifier  sequences,  zero-
           width-joiner  (ZWJ)  sequences  and  emoji tag sequences. It might also improve rendering of composed
           characters, depending on font.

               •   foot must have been compiled with utf8proc support
               •   fcft must have been compiled with HarfBuzz support

           This option can also be set runtime with DECSET/DECRST 2027.

           See also: <b>grapheme-width-method</b>.

           Default: <u>yes</u>

       <b>grapheme-width-method</b>
           Selects which method to use when calculating the  width  (i.e.  number  of  columns)  of  a  grapheme
           cluster. One of <b>wcswidth</b>, <b>double-width</b> and <b>max</b>.

           <b>wcswidth</b> simply adds together the individual width of all codepoints making up the cluster.

           <b>double-width</b>  does the same, but limits the maximum number of columns to 2. This is more correct, but
           may break some applications since applications typically use <b><a href="../man3/wcswidth.3.html">wcswidth</a></b>(3) internally to calculate  the
           width. This results in cursor de-synchronization issues.

           <b>max</b> uses the width of the largest codepoint in the cluster.

           Default: <u>double-width</u>

       <b>font-monospace-warn</b>
           Boolean.  When  enabled,  foot  will  use heuristics to try to verify the primary font is a monospace
           font, and warn if it is not.

           Disable this if you still want to use the font, even if foot thinks it is not monospaced.

           You may also want to disable it to get slightly faster startup times.

           Default: <u>yes</u>

       <b>max-shm-pool-size-mb</b>
           This option controls the amount of virtual address space used by  the  pixmap  memory  to  which  the
           terminal screen content is rendered.

           It does not change how much physical memory foot uses.

           Foot uses a memory mapping trick to implement fast rendering of interactive scrolling (typically, but
           applies to "slow" scrolling in general). Example: holding down the 'up' or 'down' arrow key to scroll
           in a text editor.

           For  this  to  work,  it  needs a large amount of virtual address space. Again, note that this is not
           physical memory.

           On a normal x64 based computer, each process has 128TB of virtual address space, and newer ones  have
           64PB. This is an insane amount and most applications do not use anywhere near that amount.

           Each  foot  terminal  window  can  allocate up to 2GB of virtual address space. With 128TB of address
           space, that means a maximum of 65536 windows in server/daemon mode (for 2GB). That should be  enough,
           yes?

           However,  the  Wayland  compositor  also  needs to allocate the same amount of virtual address space.
           Thus, it has a slightly higher chance of running out of address space since  it  needs  to  host  all
           running Wayland clients in the same way, at the same time.

           In  the  off  chance  that  this  becomes a problem for you, you can reduce the amount used with this
           option.

           Or, for optimal performance, you can increase it to the maximum allowed value, 2GB (but note that you
           most likely will not notice any difference compared to the default value).

           Setting it to 0 disables the feature.

           Limitations:
               •   only supported on 64-bit architectures
               •   only supported on Linux

           Default: <u>512</u>. Maximum allowed: <u>2048</u> (2GB).

       <b>sixel</b>
           Boolean. When enabled, foot will process sixel images. Default: <u>yes</u>

       <b>bold-text-in-bright-amount</b>
           Amount by which bold fonts are brightened when <b>bold-text-in-bright</b> is set to <b>yes</b>  (the  <b>palette-based</b>
           variant is not affected by this option). Default: <u>1.3</u>.

       <b>surface-bit-depth</b>
           Selects which RGB bit depth to use for image buffers. One of <b>8-bit</b>, or <b>10-bit</b>.

           The  default,  <b>8-bit</b>,  uses  8  bits for all channels, alpha included. When <b>gamma-correct-blending</b> is
           disabled, this is the best option.

           When <b>gamma-correct-blending</b> is enabled, you may want to enable 10-bit surfaces, as that improves  the
           color  resolution. Be aware however, that in this mode, the alpha channel is only 2 bits instead of 8
           bits. Thus, if you are using a transparent background, you may want to use the default,  <b>8-bit</b>,  even
           if you have gamma-correct blending enabled.

           You  should  also  note  that 10-bit surface is slower. This will increase input latency and decrease
           rendering throughput.

           Default: <u>8-bit</u>
