</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       pbuilderrc - configuration files for personal package builder

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/pbuilderrc</b> contains default values used in the <b>pbuilder</b> program invocation.

       The  file  itself  is sourced by a shell script, so it is required that the file conforms to shell script
       conventions.

       The environment variable <u>PBUILDER_OPERATION</u> contains the current operation mode of pbuilder, and  can  be
       used  to  do a conditional configuration.  Possible values are <b>build</b>, <b>clean</b>, <b>create</b>, <b>debuild</b>, <b>dumpconfig</b>,
       <b>execute</b>, <b>login</b>, <b>update</b>.

</pre><h4><b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>APTCACHE=</b><u>/var/cache/pbuilder/aptcache</u>
              Specify the location that the packages downloaded by apt should be cached.  Setting this value  to
              "" will cause caching to be turned off.

       <b>APTCACHEHARDLINK=</b><u>yes</u>
              Specify using hard links in apt cache handling.  Changing this to no will disable hard linking and
              will copy the files.

              It is advised to set this to <b>no</b> if you are using user-mode-linux.

       <b>APTCONFDIR=</b><u><a href="file:/etc/apt">/etc/apt</a></u>
              Configures  where  the  apt configuration files are copied from.  By default, this value is empty,
              allowing the usual configuration options to take effect.  Setting this  variable  overrides  other
              options.

       <b>ARCHITECTURE=</b><u>`dpkg</u> <u>--print-architecture`</u>
              Specifies   the   <b>build</b>  <b>architecture</b>  (as  described  in  <b><a href="../man1/dpkg-architecture.1.html">dpkg-architecture</a></b>(1)).   It'll  be  the
              architecture used when creating the chroot, defaults to the
               system one.  The supported values are the ones debootstrap supports.

       <b>AUTOCLEANAPTCACHE=</b><u>yes</u>
              Always run with <b>--autocleanaptcache</b> option.

       <b>AUTO_DEBSIGN=</b><u>yes</u>
              When this value is set to yes, <b>pdebuild</b> will invoke debsign command after building.

       <b>BASETGZ=</b><u>/var/cache/pbuilder/base.tgz</u>
              Specifies the default location for the archived chroot image to be  created  and  used.   This  is
              overridden with the option <b>--basetgz</b>.

       <b>BINDMOUNTS=</b><u>directories-to-bind-mount[:internal-mountpoint]</u>
              When  this  value  is  set,  pbuilder  will  mount  these directories using bind-mount.  Different
              directories are space separated, a column can optionally specify a mount  destination  inside  the
              chroot.
              Do not bind-mount <b>/</b>.
              An Example:

              BINDMOUNTS="<a href="file:/home">/home</a> /mnt/test /home/joe/repo:/var/repo"

       <b>BUILDDIR=</b><u>/build</u>
              The  directory  inside  the chroot where the build happens.  This directory will contain the build
              products; the source packages  will  be  unpacked  in  a  subdirectory  therein  contained,  named
              <u>$srcpkg</u>-<u>$ver</u>, with <u>$ver</u> being the upstream part of the version, without epoch and debian revision.

              Attention! Some directories — such as <b><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></b> — are not safe to use since they can be world-writable,
              and external users can temper with the build process.

       <b>BUILDPLACE=</b><u>/var/cache/pbuilder/build/</u>
              The default place which the chroot is constructed.  <b>pbuilder</b> will use the directory <b>$BUILDPLACE$$</b>.
              which  means,  that it will use the directory and the PID to determine the directory to use.  This
              should obtain an unique directory for concurrent runs of pbuilder in one  machine.   This  is  not
              guaranteed  to  happen  on  network shared drives, so be aware of this fact when playing with this
              option    on    NFS    shared    beowulf    clusters.     Change    it    to    something     like
              <u>/var/cache/pbuilder/build/$HOSTNAME/</u> when doing such a thing.

              <b>pbuilder</b> <b>clean</b> cleans up this directory.

       <b>BUILDRESULT=</b><u>/var/cache/pbuilder/result/</u>
              Specify the default directory which the build result will be copied over to after the building.

              Unlike  the <b>--buildresult</b> command-line option the path is not canonicalized, so you should specify
              a full path, not a relative path.

       <b>EATMYDATA=</b><u>no</u>
              Enable or disable the builtin eatmydata support.
              For this to work the library of the same architecture as the one  inside  the  chroot  has  to  be
              installed in the host.

       <b>CCACHEDIR=</b>
              Specifies where ccache will keep its cached compiler output.  If this is specified, ccache will be
              installed  upon pbuilder create or pbuilder update, <u>/usr/lib/ccache</u> will be prepended to the <b>PATH</b>,
              <b>CCACHEDIR</b> will be bind-mounted in the chroot, and <b>CCACHE_DIR</b> (ccache  variable)  will  be  set  to
              <b>CCACHEDIR</b>.  Note that files in <b>CCACHEDIR</b> are chowned to <b>BUILDUSERID</b> (1234 by default).
              <u>ccache</u> is disabled by default.

       <b>BUILDRESULTUID=</b>

       <b>BUILDRESULTGID=</b>
              Set  the  UID  and  GID of the files built as result.  They probably need to be set to numeric UID
              values, so that it works the same inside the chroot and outside the chroot.

              If sudo is used, the values specified by sudo is used.  They  are  <b>SUDO_UID</b>,  and  <b>SUDO_GID</b>.   The
              default value is <b>0</b>

       <b>BUILDSOURCEROOTCMD=</b><u>fakeroot</u>
              This option is used on invocation of fakeroot for <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b> in <b>pdebuild</b>

       <b>BUILDUSERID=</b><u>1234</u>
              The  uid to be used inside chroot.  It should ideally not collide with user-id outside the chroot,
              to avoid user inside chroot having access to processes owned by the user id outside the chroot.

       <b>BUILDUSERNAME=</b><u>pbuilder</u>
              The user name of the user the build will run as.  Specifying this will enable the use of  fakeroot
              inside pbuilder.

              Note  that  this  will  require  fakeroot  to  be  installed  within the chroot, and fakeroot will
              automatically be installed.  And <b>-rfakeroot</b> will be added to <b>DEBBUILDOPTS</b>

       <b>COMPONENTS=</b><u>main</u>
              Specify the default distribution components to use.  This option is  space-delimited,  use  quotes
              when  listing  multiple  components.   This option only affects when doing <b>pbuilder</b> <b>create</b> or when
              <b>--override-config</b> is specified for <b>pbuilder</b> <b>update</b> option.

       <b>COMPRESSPROG=</b><u>gzip</u>
              Program to use for compression of the base.tgz.  The default is to use gzip, and any program  that
              can be used to compress data using a pipe can be used.

              If  set  to  "pigz",  compression  and decompression is gzip compatible but will use all available
              CPUs.
              If set to "cat", there will be no compression at all (so compression/decompression will be  a  lot
              faster but takes much more space on the disk).

       <b>export</b> <b>http_proxy=</b><u><a href="http://your-proxy">http://your-proxy</a>:8080/</u>
              Defines the proxy for http connection.

       <b>export</b> <b>DEBIAN_BUILDARCH=</b><u>athlon</u>
              Uses  this variable as <b>DEBIAN_BUILDARCH</b>.  This trick can be used for other environmental variables
              as well.

       <b>DEBBUILDOPTS=</b>
              The options given here will be passed on to  <b>dpkg-buildpackage</b>.   This  can  be  useful  e.g.  for
              binary-only  builds.  The  command-line  option  <b>--debbuildopts</b>  <b>will</b>  <b>be</b> <b>appended</b> <b>to</b> <b>any</b> <b>contents</b>
              <b>specified</b> <b>here</b> <b>but</b> may also be used to reset the list of options.

              The default value is to build source and binary package.

       <b>DEBOOTSTRAPOPTS=</b><u>(</u> <u>'--variant=buildd'</u> <u>'--keyring'</u> <u>'/usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg'</u> <u>)</u>
              When  this  option  is  set  to  <b>--variant=buildd</b>   <b>pbuilder</b>   will   invoke   <b>$DEBOOTSTRAP</b>   with
              <b>--variant=buildd</b> option, which results in debootstrap creating a minimal chroot for buildd instead
              of  trying  to  create  a minimal installation chroot.  <b>--keyring</b> is used to specify a keyring for
              debootstrap.

       <b>APTKEYRINGS=</b><u>()</u>
              Additional keyrings to use for package verification  with  apt,  not  used  for  debootstrap  (use
              <b>$DEBOOTSTRAPOPTS</b>).   Use  this  to add (local) signed repositories. By default the debian-archive-
              keyring package inside the chroot is used.

              Keyrings are copied into <u><a href="file:/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d">/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d</a></u> in the chroot.   APT  supports  it  since  version
              0.7.25.1,  firstly  available  in  the Debian release codenamed "squeeze" (released on 2011).  For
              older chroots, use a <b>G</b> hook to run <b>apt-key</b> manually.

       <b>DEBOOTSTRAP=</b><u>debootstrap</u>
              Use this option to switch the implementation of debootstrap.  Known implementations of debootstrap
              are <b>cdebootstrap</b> and <b>debootstrap</b>

       <b>export</b> <b>DEBIAN_FRONTEND=</b><u>noninteractive</u>
              Sets interactiveness of pbuilder run.  Setting this value to blank will cause the pbuilder run  to
              be interactive.  Change this value when noninteractive upgrades do not work.

       <b>DISTRIBUTION=</b><u>sid</u>
              Specify  the  default distribution to use.  This option only affects when doing <b>pbuilder</b> <b>create</b> or
              when <b>--override-config</b> is specified for <b>pbuilder</b> <b>update</b> option.

       <b>EXTRAPACKAGES=</b><u>"ccache</u> <u>lintian</u> <u>XXX"</u>
              Specifies extra packages which the system should install in the chroot on <b>pbuilder</b>  <b>create</b>.   This
              is a space-delimited list.  Also this is installed on <b>pbuilder</b> <b>update</b>

       <b>HOOKDIR=</b><u>/usr/lib/pbuilder/hooks</u>
              Specifies  the  default location for the user hooks directory.  This is overridden with the option
              <b>--hookdir</b>.

              If this is specified, hooks are searched for in the chroot, when running <b>pbuilder</b>.  If it  is  not
              defined, or is an empty string, hooks are not executed.

              For details, see <b><a href="../man8/pbuilder.8.html">pbuilder</a>(8)</b>

       <b>LOGLEVEL=</b><u>I</u>
              Specify  how  much  output you want from pbuilder, valid values are <b>E</b> (errors only), <b>W</b> (errors and
              warnings), <b>I</b>  (errors,  warnings  and  informational)  and  <b>D</b>  (everything  including  some  debug
              messages).

       <b>USECOLORS=</b><u>auto</u>
              Specify  whether you'd like to see colored output from pbuilder.  Valid values are <b>auto</b> (to try to
              automatically detect whether the terminal supports them), <b>yes</b> (to always use colors), and  <b>no</b>  (to
              never use colors).

       <b>MIRRORSITE=</b><u><a href="http://www.jp.debian.org/debian">http://www.jp.debian.org/debian</a></u>
              Specify the mirror site which contains the main Debian distribution.

              Note  that  you  cannot really use <b>file:/</b> kind of URL, because the location needs to be accessible
              from within the chroot.

       <b>OTHERMIRROR=</b><u>deb</u> <u><a href="http://xxx/xxx/">http://xxx/xxx/</a></u> <u>./</u> <b>[|</b> <u>other</u> <u>deb</u> <u>lines...</u> <b>]</b>
              The lines which is added to the sources.list, delimited with <b>|</b> Like:
              <b>deb</b> <b><a href="http://local/mirror">http://local/mirror</a></b> <b>sid</b> <b>main|deb</b> <b>file:/usr/local/mirror</b> <b>./</b>

              The deb lines here are the ones that will appear at the top of the <b>sources.list</b> inside the chroot.
              Be sure to follow the syntax rules of <b><a href="../man5/sources.list.5.html">sources.list</a></b>(5).  These lines appear at the beginning of the
              constructed sources file, so this is the place to list your <b>local</b> mirror sites; apt will then  use
              them in preference to the ones listed in <b>MIRRORSITE</b> <b>.</b>

              To make changes on mirror site effective on <b>update</b> <b>--override-config</b> needs to be specified.

       <b>PDEBUILD_PBUILDER=</b><u>pbuilder</u>
              Specify  what  pbuilder  implementation  to  use  for pdebuild.  The currently possible values are
              <b>pbuilder</b> and <b>cowbuilder</b>

       <b>PKGNAME_LOGFILE_EXTENSION=_</b><u>$(dpkg</u> <u>--print-architecture).build</u>
              The extension of filename used in pkgname-logfile option.

       <b>PKGNAME_LOGFILE=</b><u>yes</u>
              Always run with <b>--pkgname-logfile</b> option, and create a logfile named after the package name.

       <b>PBUILDERROOTCMD=</b><u>sudo</u> <u>-E</u>
              This option is used on invocation of <b>pbuilder</b> <b>build</b> in <b>pdebuild</b>

       <b>PBUILDERSATISFYDEPENDSCMD=</b><u>/usr/lib/pbuilder/pbuilder-satisfydepends</u>
              This option is used by various parts of pbuilder to satisfy (i.e. install) the  build-dependencies
              of a package.  These are the available implementations:

              <u>pbuilder-satisfydepends-apt</u>  the  newest  implementation, which leverage the ability of apt 1.4 to
              satisfy build dependencies and build conflicts from a .dsc; useful  since  it's  pretty  fast  and
              doesn't require the installation of any non-required package in the chroot, nor of dummy packages.

              <u>pbuilder-satisfydepends-experimental</u> might be useful to pull packages from repositories with a low
              APT Pin Priority (for example, Debian's experimental or stable-backports).

              <u>pbuilder-satisfydepends-aptitude</u> will resolve build-dependencies and build-conflicts with aptitude
              which helps dealing with complex cases but does not support unsigned APT repositories.

              <u>pbuilder-satisfydepends-gdebi</u>  will  resolve  build-dependencies  using gdebi, faster than classic
              implementation,  and  does  not  require  installation  of  a  dummy  package  like  the  aptitude
              implementation.

              <u>pbuilder-satisfydepnds-classic</u> the "classic" implementation, which was the original implementation
              used by default until v0.172.

              The default is now "aptitude".

       <b>PBUILDERSATISFYDEPENDSOPT=</b><u>()</u>
              Array of flags to give to pbuilder-satisfydepends.

       <b>SOURCE_ONLY_CHANGES=</b><u>yes</u>
              Specify  whether  to  generate  an additional .changes file for a source-only upload, whilst still
              producing a full .changes file for any binary packages built.

       <b>ALLOWUNTRUSTED=</b><u>no</u>
              Allow untrusted (no key installed) and unsigned repositories.  <b>Warning:</b> Enabling this  option  may
              allow  remote attackers to compromise the system.  Better use signed repositories and <b>$APTKEYRINGS</b>
              to add the key(s).

       <b>APTGETOPT=</b><u>()</u>
              Extra flags to give to apt-get.

       <b>APTITUDEGETOPT=</b><u>()</u>
              Extra flags to give to aptitude.

       <b>DEBDELTA=</b><u>no</u>
              Enable use of debdelta to download the needed updated  in  the  chroot,  if  debdelta  is  already
              installed.

       <b>REMOVEPACKAGES=</b><u>lilo</u>
              Specify  the  packages  to  be  removed on creation of <b>base.tgz</b> Leaving lilo in the chroot is like
              keeping a timebomb...

       <b>TIMEOUT_TIME=</b><u>2h</u>
              Sets timeout time.  Build will be stopped with SIGTERM after the set time.

       <b>USEDEVFS=</b><u>no</u>
              Whether to mount a devfs or not.  Has no effect on kFreeBSD, as a devfs (and fdescfs for  <b><a href="file:/dev/fd">/dev/fd</a></b>)
              is always used.

       <b>USEDEVPTS=</b><u>yes</u>
              Specify <b>yes</b> when it is desired to mount <b><a href="file:/dev/pts">/dev/pts</a></b> interface. It is usually a good idea, since there
              are many software which fail miserably when there is no <b><a href="file:/dev/pts">/dev/pts</a></b> being mounted.

       <b>USESYSFS=</b><u>yes</u>
              Whether to mount a sysfs (linsysfs for kFreeBSD) in <b><a href="file:/sys">/sys</a></b> or not.  Has no effect on GNU/Hurd hosts,
              where  sysfs  is not available.  It is usually a good idea, since there are several software which
              require <b><a href="file:/sys">/sys</a></b> being populated.

       <b>USENETWORK=</b><u>no</u>
              Specify <b>yes</b> when you do not want to disable network access during build.  Network is not available
              on a Debian buildd, so you might want to keep the default.   Disabling  network  access  currently
              only works on Linux.

       <b>USECGROUP=</b><u>yes</u>
              Specify <b>yes</b> to use a cgroup to isolate build processes, so that any stray processes from the build
              can be cleaned up afterwords.  This currently only works on Linux systems running systemd.

       <b>USESHM=</b><u>yes</u>
              Specify  <b>yes</b>  when it is desired to mount <b><a href="file:/dev/shm">/dev/shm</a></b> mount point. It is usually a good idea in order
              to work with software that expects shm to work.
              <b><a href="file:/run/shm">/run/shm</a></b> will be configured as a symbolic link to <b><a href="file:/dev/shm">/dev/shm</a></b>.
              This option used to be named <b>USERUNSHM</b>, for compatibility purpose the old name is still supported,
              and if set it'll override any <b>USESHM</b>.
              Has no effect on GNU/Hurd hosts due to bugs in <b>/hurd/tmpfs</b>; since <a href="file:/dev">/dev</a> is always bind-mounted, the
              host's <b><a href="file:/dev/shm">/dev/shm</a></b> will be used.

       <b>USE_PDEBUILD_INTERNAL=</b><u>yes</u>
              When this option is set to <u>yes</u> <b>pdebuild-internal</b> implementation of <b>pdebuild</b> is used.

       <b>USEPROC=</b><u>yes</u>
              Specify <b>yes</b> when it is desired to mount <b><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></b> interface. It is usually a good  idea,  since  there
              are many software which fail miserably when there is no <b><a href="file:/proc">/proc</a></b> being mounted.

       <b>ADDITIONAL_BUILDRESULTS=</b><u>(foo</u> <u>"bar*"</u> <u>"baz\</u> <u>biz")</u>
              Array of additional files to copy out of the build area.
              In  case  a  wildcard  is  needed  (e.g.  <b>*.changes</b>) quote it to have the wildcard escaped and not
              expanded at configuration load time, but instead expanded at run time when  the  additional  build
              artifacts  are  exported.   Spaces in file names needs to be escaped by using a \ or a wildcard to
              match the space.

       <b>CONFDIR=</b><u>/etc/pbuilder/conf_files</u>
              <b>pbuilder</b> copies some configuration files (like <b><a href="file:/etc/hosts">/etc/hosts</a></b> or <b><a href="file:/etc/hostname">/etc/hostname</a></b>) from the  host  system
              into  the  chroot.   If  the  directory specified here exists and contains one of the copied files
              (without the leading <a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>) that file will be copied from here instead of the system one.

       <b>BUILD_HOME=</b><u>/nonexistent</u>
              Set the what the <b>HOME</b> environment variable points to during the builds.  It  defaults  to  a  non-
              existing  directory  to  prevent  builds from writing to HOME, which is reserved to users.  If you
              need a working HOME you can set it to <b>$BUILDDIR</b> instead.

       <b>BINNMU_MAINTAINER=</b>
              Set the value of the maintainer name and email in the changelog during binNMU.  Such value is then
              copied to the Changed-By field of the .changes file.  Can be set at run time with  the  <b>--bin-nmu-</b>
              <b>maintainer</b> command line option.
