       nslcd.conf - configuration file for LDAP nameservice daemon

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  <u>nss-pam-ldapd</u>  package  allows LDAP directory servers to be used as a primary source of name service
       information. (Name service information typically includes users,  hosts,  groups,  and  other  such  data
       historically stored in flat files or NIS.)

       The  file  <u>nslcd.conf</u>  contains the configuration information for running <b>nslcd</b> (see <b><a href="../man8/nslcd.8.html">nslcd</a></b>(8)).  The file
       contains options, one on each line, defining the way NSS lookups and  PAM  actions  are  mapped  to  LDAP
       lookups.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
   <b>RUNTIME</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>threads</b> <u>NUM</u>
              Specifies  the number of threads to start that can handle requests and perform LDAP queries.  Each
              thread opens a separate connection to the LDAP server.  The default is to start 5 threads.

       <b>uid</b> <u>UID</u>
              This specifies the user id with which the daemon should be run.  This can be a numerical id  or  a
              symbolic value.  If no uid is specified no attempt to change the user will be made.  Note that you
              should use values that don't need LDAP to resolve.

       <b>gid</b> <u>GID</u>
              This  specifies the group id with which the daemon should be run.  This can be a numerical id or a
              symbolic value.  If no gid is specified no attempt to change the group will be  made.   Note  that
              you should use values that don't need LDAP to resolve.

       <b>log</b> <u>SCHEME</u> [<u>LEVEL</u>]
              This  option  controls the way logging is done.  The <u>SCHEME</u> argument may either be none, syslog or
              an absolute file name.  The <u>LEVEL</u> argument is optional and specifies the log level.  The log level
              may be one of: crit, error, warning, notice, info or debug. The default log level  is  info.   All
              messages  with  the specified loglevel or higher are logged.  This option can be supplied multiple
              times.  If this option is omitted syslog info is assumed.

   <b>GENERAL</b> <b>CONNECTION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>uri</b> <u>URI</u> ...
              Specifies the LDAP URI of the server to connect to.  The URI scheme may be ldap, ldapi  or  ldaps,
              specifying LDAP over TCP, ICP or SSL respectively (if supported by the LDAP library).

              Alternatively,  the  value  DNS may be used to try to lookup the server using DNS SRV records.  By
              default the current domain is used but another domain can  be  queried  by  using  the  DNS:DOMAIN
              syntax.  To convert SRV records for port 389 into an ldaps:// URI, DNSLDAPS can be used.

              When    using    the    ldapi   scheme,   %2f   should   be   used   to   escape   slashes   (e.g.
              ldapi://%2fvar%2frun%2fslapd%2fldapi/), although most of the time this should not be needed.

              This option may be specified multiple times and/or with  more  URIs  on  the  line,  separated  by
              spaces.  Normally, only the first server will be used with the following servers as fall-back (see
              <b>bind_timelimit</b> below).

              If LDAP lookups are used for host name resolution, any host names should be  specified  as  an  IP
              address or name that can be resolved without using LDAP.

       <b>ldap_version</b> <u>VERSION</u>
              Specifies  the  version  of  the  LDAP protocol to use.  The default is to use the maximum version
              supported by the LDAP library.

       <b>binddn</b> <u>DN</u>
              Specifies the distinguished name with which to bind to the  directory  server  for  lookups.   The
              default is to bind anonymously.

       <b>bindpw</b> <u>PASSWORD</u>
              Specifies  the  credentials  with  which  to  bind.  This option is only applicable when used with
              <b>binddn</b> above.  If you set this  option  you  should  consider  changing  the  permissions  of  the
              <u>nslcd.conf</u> file to only grant access to the root user.

       <b>rootpwmoddn</b> <u>DN</u>
              Specifies the distinguished name to use when the root user tries to modify a user's password using
              the PAM module.

              Note that currently this DN needs to exist as a real entry in the LDAP directory.

       <b>rootpwmodpw</b> <u>PASSWORD</u>
              Specifies  the  credentials with which to bind if the root user tries to change a user's password.
              This option is only applicable when used with <b>rootpwmoddn</b> above.  If this option is not  specified
              the  PAM  module  prompts  the user for this password.  If you set this option you should consider
              changing the permissions of the <u>nslcd.conf</u> file to only grant access to the root user.

   <b>SASL</b> <b>AUTHENTICATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>sasl_mech</b> <u>MECHANISM</u>
              Specifies the SASL mechanism to be used when performing SASL authentication.

       <b>sasl_realm</b> <u>REALM</u>
              Specifies the SASL realm to be used when performing SASL authentication.

       <b>sasl_authcid</b> <u>AUTHCID</u>
              Specifies the authentication identity to be used when performing SASL authentication.

       <b>sasl_authzid</b> <u>AUTHZID</u>
              Specifies the authorization identity to be used when  performing  SASL  authentication.   Must  be
              specified in one of the formats: dn:&lt;distinguished name&gt; or u:&lt;username&gt;.

       <b>sasl_secprops</b> <u>PROPERTIES</u>
              Specifies Cyrus SASL security properties.  Allowed values are described in the <b><a href="../man5/ldap.conf.5.html">ldap.conf</a></b>(5) manual
              page.

       <b>sasl_canonicalize</b> yes|no
              Determines  whether  the  LDAP server host name should be canonicalised. If this is set to yes the
              LDAP library will do a reverse host name lookup.  By default, it is left up to  the  LDAP  library
              whether this check is performed or not.

   <b>KERBEROS</b> <b>AUTHENTICATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>krb5_ccname</b> <u>NAME</u>
              Set the name for the GSS-API Kerberos credentials cache.

   <b>SEARCH/MAPPING</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>base</b> [<u>MAP</u>] <u>DN</u>
              Specifies the distinguished name (DN) to use as search base.  This option may be supplied multiple
              times and all specified bases will be searched.

              A  global search base may be specified or a MAP-specific one.  If no MAP-specific search bases are
              defined the global ones are used.

              If, instead of a DN, the value <u>DOMAIN</u> is specified, the host's DNS domain is used to  construct  a
              search base.  A value of <u>""</u> can be used to indicate an empty search base (quotes are not otherwise
              supported for base values and not all LDAP server configurations support this).

              If  this  value  is not defined an attempt is made to look it up in the configured LDAP server. If
              the LDAP server is unavailable during start-up <b>nslcd</b> will not start.

       <b>scope</b> [<u>MAP</u>] sub[tree]|one[level]|base|children
              Specifies the search scope (subtree, onelevel, base or children).  The default scope  is  subtree;
              base scope is almost never useful for name service lookups; children scope is not supported on all
              servers.

       <b>deref</b> never|searching|finding|always
              Specifies  the  policy  for  dereferencing  aliases.   The  default policy is to never dereference
              aliases.

       <b>referrals</b> yes|no
              Specifies whether automatic referral chasing should be enabled.  The default behaviour is to chase
              referrals.

       <b>filter</b> <u>MAP</u> <u>FILTER</u>
              The <u>FILTER</u> is an LDAP search filter to use for a specific map.  The  default  filter  is  a  basic
              search on the objectClass for the map (e.g. (objectClass=posixAccount)).

       <b>map</b> <u>MAP</u> <u>ATTRIBUTE</u> <u>NEWATTRIBUTE</u>
              This  option  allows  for  custom  attributes  to  be  looked  up  instead of the default RFC 2307
              attributes.  The <u>MAP</u> may be one of the supported maps below.  The <u>ATTRIBUTE</u> is the one as used  in
              RFC 2307 (e.g. userPassword, ipProtocolNumber, macAddress, etc.).

              The <u>NEWATTRIBUTE</u> may be the name of any attribute as it is available in the directory.

              If  the  <u>NEWATTRIBUTE</u>  is  quoted (") as <u>"EXPRESSION"</u> it is treated as an expression which will be
              evaluated to build up the actual value used.  See the section  on  attribute  mapping  expressions
              below for more details.

              Only  some  attributes  for  group,  passwd  and  shadow  entries may be mapped with an expression
              (because other attributes may be used in search filters).  For group entries only the userPassword
              attribute may be mapped with an expression.  For passwd entries the following  attributes  may  be
              mapped  with  an  expression:  userPassword,  gidNumber, gecos, homeDirectory and loginShell.  For
              shadow  entries  the  following  attributes  may  be  mapped  with  an  expression:  userPassword,
              shadowLastChange,   shadowMin,   shadowMax,   shadowWarning,   shadowInactive,   shadowExpire  and
              shadowFlag.

              The uidNumber and gidNumber attributes in the passwd and group maps may be mapped to the objectSid
              followed  by  the  domain  SID  to  derive  numeric  user  and  group  ids  from  the  SID   (e.g.
              objectSid:S-1-5-21-3623811015-3361044348-30300820).

              By  default  all  userPassword  attributes  are  mapped to the unmatchable password ("*") to avoid
              accidentally leaking password information.

   <b>TIMING/RECONNECT</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>bind_timelimit</b> <u>SECONDS</u>
              Specifies the time limit (in seconds) to use when connecting to the  directory  server.   This  is
              distinct from the time limit specified in <b>timelimit</b> and affects the set-up of the connection only.
              Note  that  not  all  LDAP client libraries have support for setting the connection time out.  The
              default <b>bind_timelimit</b> is 10 seconds.

       <b>timelimit</b> <u>SECONDS</u>
              Specifies the time limit (in seconds) to wait for a response from the LDAP  server.   A  value  of
              zero (0), which is the default, is to wait indefinitely for searches to be completed.

       <b>idle_timelimit</b> <u>SECONDS</u>
              Specifies the period of inactivity (in seconds) after which the connection to the LDAP server will
              be closed.  The default is not to time out connections.

       <b>reconnect_sleeptime</b> <u>SECONDS</u>
              Specifies  the number of seconds to sleep when connecting to all LDAP servers fails.  By default 1
              second is waited between the first failure and the first retry.

       <b>reconnect_retrytime</b> <u>SECONDS</u>
              Specifies the time after which the LDAP server is considered to be permanently unavailable.   Once
              this time is reached retries will be done only once per this time period.  The default value is 10
              seconds.

       Note that the reconnect logic as described above is the mechanism that is used between <b>nslcd</b> and the LDAP
       server.  The  mechanism  between  the  NSS  and PAM client libraries on one end and <b>nslcd</b> on the other is
       simpler with a fixed compiled-in time out of a 10 seconds for writing to <b>nslcd</b>  and  a  time  out  of  60
       seconds  for reading answers.  <b>nslcd</b> itself has a read time out of 0.5 seconds and a write time out of 60
       seconds.

   <b>SSL/TLS</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>ssl</b> on|off|start_tls
              Specifies whether to use SSL/TLS or not (the default is not to). If <u>start_tls</u>  is  specified  then
              StartTLS  is  used rather than raw LDAP over SSL.  Not all LDAP client libraries support both SSL,
              StartTLS and all related configuration options.

       <b>tls_reqcert</b> never|allow|try|demand|hard
              Specifies what checks to perform on a server-supplied certificate.  The meaning of the  values  is
              described  in  the  <b><a href="../man5/ldap.conf.5.html">ldap.conf</a></b>(5) manual page.  At least one of <b>tls_cacertdir</b> and <b>tls_cacertfile</b> is
              required if peer verification is enabled.

       <b>tls_cacertdir</b> <u>PATH</u>
              Specifies the directory containing X.509 certificates for peer authentication.  This parameter  is
              ignored when using GnuTLS.  On Debian OpenLDAP is linked against GnuTLS.

       <b>tls_cacertfile</b> <u>PATH</u>
              Specifies the path to the X.509 certificate for peer authentication.

       <b>tls_randfile</b> <u>PATH</u>
              Specifies  the path to an entropy source.  This parameter is ignored when using GnuTLS.  On Debian
              OpenLDAP is linked against GnuTLS.

       <b>tls_ciphers</b> <u>CIPHERS</u>
              Specifies the ciphers to use for TLS.  See your TLS  implementation's  documentation  for  further
              information.

       <b>tls_cert</b> <u>PATH</u>
              Specifies the path to the file containing the local certificate for client TLS authentication.

       <b>tls_key</b> <u>PATH</u>
              Specifies the path to the file containing the private key for client TLS authentication.

       <b>tls_reqsan</b> never|allow|try|demand|hard
              Specifies  the  way  server  Subject  Alternative  Name  (SAN)  is  checked in the server-supplied
              certificate.  The meaning of the values is described in the <b><a href="../man5/ldap.conf.5.html">ldap.conf</a></b>(5) manual page.

       <b>tls_crlcheck</b> none|peer|all
              Specifies if the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) of the CA should  be  used  to  verify  if  the
              server  certificates  have  not  been  revoked.   The  meaning  of  the values is described in the
              <b><a href="../man5/ldap.conf.5.html">ldap.conf</a></b>(5) manual page.

       <b>tls_crlfile</b> <u>PATH</u>
              Specifies the path to the file containing a Certificate Revocation List to be used  to  verify  if
              the server certificates.  The meaning of the values is described in the <b><a href="../man5/ldap.conf.5.html">ldap.conf</a></b>(5) manual page.

   <b>OTHER</b> <b>OPTIONS</b>
       <b>pagesize</b> <u>NUMBER</u>
              Set  this  to  a number greater than 0 to request paged results from the LDAP server in accordance
              with RFC2696.  The default (0) is to not request paged results.

              This is useful for LDAP servers that contain a lot of entries (e.g. more than 500) and  limit  the
              number  of  entries  that are returned with one request.  For OpenLDAP servers you may need to set
              <b>sizelimit</b> <b>size.prtotal=unlimited</b> for allowing more entries to be returned over multiple pages.

       <b>nss_initgroups_ignoreusers</b> user1,user2,...
              This option prevents group membership lookups through LDAP for the specified users.  This  can  be
              useful in case of unavailability of the LDAP server.  This option may be specified multiple times.

              Alternatively,  the  value  ALLLOCAL may be used. With that value nslcd builds a full list of non-
              LDAP users on startup.

       <b>nss_min_uid</b> <u>UID</u>
              This option ensures that LDAP users with a numeric user id lower  than  the  specified  value  are
              ignored. Also requests for users with a lower user id are ignored.

       <b>nss_uid_offset</b> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This  option  specifies an offset that is added to all LDAP numeric user ids.  This can be used to
              avoid user id collisions with local users or, when using objectSid attributes,  for  compatibility
              reasons.

              The value from the <b>nss_min_uid</b> option is evaluated after applying the offset.

       <b>nss_gid_offset</b> <u>NUMBER</u>
              This  option specifies an offset that is added to all LDAP numeric group ids.  This can be used to
              avoid user id collisions with local groups or, when using objectSid attributes, for  compatibility
              reasons.

       <b>nss_nested_groups</b> yes|no
              If  this  option  is  set, the member attribute of a group may point to another group.  Members of
              nested groups are also returned in the higher level group and  parent  groups  are  returned  when
              finding  groups  for  a  specific  user.   The default is not to perform extra searches for nested
              groups.

       <b>nss_getgrent_skipmembers</b> yes|no
              If this option is set, the group member list is not retrieved when looking up groups.  Lookups for
              finding which groups a user belongs to will remain functional so the user will  likely  still  get
              the correct groups assigned on login.

              This  can  offer  a  speed-up  on  systems  that  have  very large groups.  It has the downside of
              returning inconsistent information about group membership which  may  confuse  some  applications.
              This option is not recommended for most configurations.

       <b>nss_disable_enumeration</b> yes|no
              If  this  option  is  set,  functions which cause all user/group entries to be loaded (getpwent(),
              getgrent(), setspent()) from the directory will not succeed in doing so.  Applications that depend
              on being able to sequentially read all users and/or groups may fail to operate correctly.

              This can dramatically reduce LDAP server load in situations where there  are  a  great  number  of
              users  and/or groups.  This is typically used in situations where user/program access to enumerate
              the entire directory is undesirable,  and  changing  the  behavior  of  the  user/program  is  not
              possible.  This option is not recommended for most configurations.

       <b>validnames</b> <u>REGEX</u>
              This  option  can be used to specify how user and group names are verified within the system. This
              pattern is used to check all user and group names that are requested and returned from LDAP.

              The regular expression should be specified as a POSIX extended regular expression. The  expression
              itself  needs  to be separated by slash (/) characters and the 'i' flag may be appended at the end
              to   indicate   that   the   match   should   be   case-insensitive.    The   default   value   is
              /^[a-z0-9._@$()]([a-z0-9._@$() \\~-]*[a-z0-9._@$()~-])?$/i

       <b>ignorecase</b> yes|no
              This  specifies  whether  or  not to perform searches for group, netgroup, passwd, protocols, rpc,
              services and shadow maps using case-insensitive matching.  Setting this to yes could open  up  the
              system  to authorisation bypass vulnerabilities and introduce nscd cache poisoning vulnerabilities
              which allow denial of service.  The default is to perform case-sensitive filtering of LDAP  search
              results for the above maps.

       <b>pam_authc_ppolicy</b> yes|no
              This  option  specifies  whether  password policy controls are requested and handled from the LDAP
              server when performing user authentication.  By default the controls are requested and handled  if
              available.

       <b>pam_authc_search</b> <u>FILTER</u>
              By  default  <b>nslcd</b> performs an LDAP search with the user's credentials after BIND (authentication)
              to ensure that the BIND operation was successful.  The default search is a simple check to see  if
              the user's DN exists.

              A  search  filter  can be specified that will be used instead.  The same substitutions as with the
              <b>pam_authz_search</b> option will be performed and the search should at least return one entry.

              The value BASE may be used to force the default search for the user DN.

              The value NONE may be used to indicate that no search should be performed after BIND.   Note  that
              some LDAP servers do not always return a correct error code as a result of a failed BIND operation
              (e.g. when an empty password is supplied).

       <b>pam_authz_search</b> <u>FILTER</u>
              This  option  allows flexible fine tuning of the authorisation check that should be performed. The
              search filter specified is executed and if any entries match, access is granted, otherwise  access
              is denied.

              The  search  filter  can  contain  the following variable references: $username, $service, $ruser,
              $rhost, $tty, $hostname, $fqdn, $domain, $dn, and $uid.  These references are substituted  in  the
              search  filter  using the same syntax as described in the section on attribute mapping expressions
              below.

              For example, to check that the user has a proper  authorizedService  value  if  the  attribute  is
              present (this almost emulates the <b>pam_check_service_attr</b> option in PADL's pam_ldap):

              (&amp;(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=$username)(|(authorizedService=$service)(!(authorizedService=*))))

              The <b>pam_check_host_attr</b> option can be emulated with:

              (&amp;(objectClass=posixAccount)(uid=$username)(|(host=$hostname)(host=$fqdn)(host=\\*)))

              This  option may be specified multiple times and all specified searches should at least return one
              entry for access to be granted.

       <b>pam_password_prohibit_message</b> "<u>MESSAGE</u>"
              If this option is set password modification using  pam_ldap  will  be  denied  and  the  specified
              message  will  be presented to the user instead.  The message can be used to direct the user to an
              alternative means of changing their password.

       <b>reconnect_invalidate</b> <u>DB</u>,<u>DB</u>,...
              If this option is set, <b>nslcd</b> will try to flush the  specified  external  caches  on  start-up  and
              whenever a connection to the LDAP server is re-established after an error.

              <u>DB</u>  can  refer to one of the nsswitch maps, in which case <b>nscd</b> is contacted to flush its cache for
              the specified database.  If <u>DB</u> is nfsidmap, <b>nfsidmap</b> is contacted to clear its cache.

              Using this option ensures that external caches are cleared of incorrect information (typically the
              absence of users) that may be present due to unavailability of the LDAP server.

       <b>cache</b> <u>CACHE</u> <u>TIME</u> [<u>TIME</u>]
              Configure the time entries are kept in the specified internal cache.

              The first <u>TIME</u> value specifies the time to keep found entries in the cache.  The second <u>TIME</u> value
              specifies to the time to remember that a particular entry was not found.  If the second  parameter
              is absent, it is assumed to be the same as the first.

              Time  values are specified as a number followed by an s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours or
              d for days.  Use 0 or off to disable the cache.

              Currently, only the dn2uid cache is supported that is used to remember DN to username lookups that
              are used when the member attribute is used.  The default time value for this cache is 15m.

</pre><h4><b>SUPPORTED</b> <b>MAPS</b></h4><pre>
       The following maps are supported. They are referenced as <u>MAP</u> in the options above.

       alias[es]
              Mail aliases.  Note that most mail servers do not  use  the  NSS  interface  for  requesting  mail
              aliases and parse <u>/etc/aliases</u> on their own.

       ether[s]
              Ethernet numbers (mac addresses).

       group  Posix groups.

       host[s]
              Host names.

       netgroup
              Host and user groups used for access control.

       network[s]
              Network numbers.

       passwd Posix users.

       protocol[s]
              Protocol definitions (like in <u><a href="file:/etc/protocols">/etc/protocols</a></u>).

       rpc    Remote procedure call names and numbers.

       service[s]
              Network service names and numbers.

       shadow Shadow user password information.

</pre><h4><b>ATTRIBUTE</b> <b>MAPPING</b> <b>EXPRESSIONS</b></h4><pre>
       For some attributes a mapping expression may be used to construct the resulting value.  This is currently
       only possible for attributes that do not need to be used in search filters.  The expressions are a subset
       of  the  double quoted string expressions in the Bourne (POSIX) shell.  Instead of variable substitution,
       attribute lookups are done on the current entry and the attribute value is  substituted.   The  following
       expressions are supported:

       "${attr}" (or "$attr" for short)
              will substitute the value of the attribute

       "${attr:-word}"
              (use  default) will substitute the value of the attribute or, if the attribute is not set or empty
              substitute the word

       "${attr:+word}"
              (use alternative) will substitute word if attribute is set, otherwise substitute the empty string

       "${attr:offset:length}"
              will substitute length characters (actually bytes) starting from position offset (which is counted
              starting at zero); the substituted string is truncated if it is too long; in particular, it can be
              of length zero (if length is zero or offset falls out of the original string)

       "${attr#word}"
              remove the shortest possible match of word from the left of the attribute value

       "${attr##word}"
              remove the longest possible match of word from the left of the attribute value (<b>pynslcd</b> only)

       "${attr%word}"
              remove the shortest possible match of word from the right of the attribute value (<b>pynslcd</b> only)

       "${attr%%word}"
              remove the longest possible match of word from the right of the attribute value (<b>pynslcd</b> only)

       Only the # matching expression is supported in <b>nslcd</b> and only with the ?  wildcard  symbol.  The  <b>pynslcd</b>
       implementation supports full matching.

       Quote ("), dollar ($) and backslash (\) characters should be escaped with a backslash (\).

       The expressions are inspected to automatically fetch the appropriate attributes from LDAP.  Some examples
       to demonstrate how these expressions may be used in attribute mapping:

       map shadow shadowFlag "${shadowFlag:-0}"
              use the shadowFlag attribute, using the value 0 as default

       map passd homeDirectory "${homeDirectory:-<a href="file:/home/">/home/</a>$uid}"
              use the uid attribute to build a homeDirectory value if that attribute is missing

       map shadow shadowExpire "${isDisabled:+100}"
              if the isDisabled attribute is set, return 100, otherwise leave value empty

       map shadow userPassword "${userPassword#{crypt\}}"
              strip the {crypt} prefix from the userPassword attribute, returning the raw hash value
