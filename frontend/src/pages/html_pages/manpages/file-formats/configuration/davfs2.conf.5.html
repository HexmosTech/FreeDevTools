</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>davfs2.conf</b> - Configuration file for <b>mount.davfs</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       There  is  a  system  wide  configuration  file  <u>/etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf</u>  and  user  configuration  files
       <u><a href="file:~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf">~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf</a></u>. When <b>mount.davfs</b> is invoked by root, only the system wide  configuration  file  is
       read.  When  invoked  by an ordinary user, the user configuration file is read in addition. Settings from
       the user configuration file will take precedence over the system wide configuration.

       The configuration file consists of lines where each line contains a keyword value pair. Keyword and value
       are separated by spaces and/or tabs.

       The file may contain sections that are for one specific mount point only.  Such a section starts  with  a
       line, that contains the full path of the mount point enclosed in square brackets. The section ends at the
       start  of  the  next section or the end of file. Options that shall apply to all mounted file system must
       come before the first sections. Options given in a mount specific section will have precedence.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       proxy     foo.bar:8080
       use_locks 0
       [/media/dav]
       use_locks 1
       [/home/otto/mywebspace]
       gui_optimize 1

       All mounted davfs2 file systems will use the proxy foo.bar. All davfs2  file  systems  except  /media/dav
       will disable the use of the locks. /home/otto/mywebspace will use the gui_optimize option.

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>SYNTAX</b> <b>RULES</b></h4><pre>
       Lines that only contain spaces and tabs (empty lines) are ignored.

       # indicates a comment. The rest of the line is ignored.

       \ is the escape character.

       "" is used for quotation.

       If  a value contains one of the special characters space, tab, #, \, or ", this character must be escaped
       by a preceding \. Use ’\ ’ instead of ’ ’, ’\#’ instead of ’#’, ’\\’ instead of ’\’ and ’\"’  instead  of
       ’"’.

       Values  containing  spaces,  tabs  or  #  may  instead be enclosed in double quotes.  But " and ’ must be
       escaped even within double quotes. If the starting line of a section is enclosed in  double  quotes,  the
       square brakets must be within the quotes (like "[/home/otto/with space]").

       Boolean option values (yes/no) must be given as numerical value.  0 for no, 1 for yes.

</pre><h4><b>AVAILABLE</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>General</b> <b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>dav_user</b>
              When  invoked  by root the <b>mount.davfs</b> daemon will run as this user.  Value must be given as <u>name</u>,
              <b>not</b> as numerical id.
              Default: davfs2
              <b>Only</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>wide</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>file.</b>

       <b>dav_group</b>
              The group of the running <b>mount.davfs</b> daemon. Ordinary users must be member of this group in  order
              to mount a davfs2 file system.  Value must be given as <u>name</u>, <b>not</b> as numerical id.
              Default: davfs2
              <b>Only</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>wide</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>file.</b>

       <b>buf_size</b>
              Size  in  KiByte  of the buffer used to communicate with the kernel file system.  Only useful with
              <u>fuse</u>, where read and write operations may profit from a larger buffer.
              Default: 16

</pre><h4><b>WebDAV</b> <b>Related</b> <b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>use_proxy</b>
              Whether to use a proxy to connect to the WebDAV server. 0 = no, 1 = yes.  If no proxy  is  defined
              in  the configration file or the environment variables <b>https_proxy</b>, <b>http_proxy</b> and <b>all_proxy</b>, this
              option has no effect.
              Default: 1
              <b>Only</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>wide</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>file.</b>

       <b>proxy</b>  Name of the proxy. The name must be the fully qualified domain name (no scheme). If the proxy port
              differs from the  default  of  8080,  it  must  be  appended,  separated  by  a  colon.  Examples:
              <u>foo.bar:1704</u> or <u>foo.bar</u>
              <b>Only</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>wide</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>file.</b>

       <b>trust_ca_cert</b>
              Name of a certificate file in PEM format. The name of the file may be given as absolute path or as
              file  name  only. In the latter case the directories <u><a href="file:~/.davfs2/certs">~/.davfs2/certs</a></u> and <u>/etc/davfs2/certs</u> will be
              searched.
              This option is useful when the certificate presented by the server cannot be  verified  using  the
              system's  data base of trusted certificate authorities (CA). The certificate file must contain the
              self-signed certificate of the top level CA in the chain of trust. It may be a self-signed  server
              certificate  (but  see  also  <b>trust_server_cert</b>).   With  this option the system's CA data base is
              ignored.
              <b>Note:</b> Even if the server's certificate is trusted that does not mean it is accepted.  Additionally
              the  certificate's  date  must be valid and either the CommonName or the SubjectAltName must match
              the host name of the server.

       <b>servercert</b>
              Same as <b>trust_ca_cert</b> but badly named.
              <b>Deprecated</b>

       <b>trust_server_cert</b>
              Name of a certificate file in PEM format. The name of the file may be given as absolute path or as
              file name only. In the latter case the directories <u><a href="file:~/.davfs2/certs">~/.davfs2/certs</a></u> and <u>/etc/davfs2/certs</u>  will  be
              searched.
              Useful  when  the server's certificate can't be verified or is even invalid, but <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that you
              can trust this certificate.  When the server presents a certificate that is exactly equal to  this
              one  and  when  the  server  is  able  to  authenticate  against  the public key contained in this
              certificate the connection will be established.
              This is the preferred option for self signed server certificates.
              No other ways to verify the certificate will be tried and the certificate will not be checked  for
              validity.

       <b>clientcert</b>
              Name  of  a  certificate  in PKCS#12 format that will be used to authenticate with the server. The
              name of the file may be given as absolute path or as file  name  only.  In  the  latter  case  the
              directories <u><a href="file:~/.davfs2/certs/private">~/.davfs2/certs/private</a></u> and <u>/etc/davfs2/certs/private</u> will be searched.
              <b>Warning:</b>  If the client certificate is issued by an intermediary CA and not by a top level CA then
              the TLS-specification requires the client to send the complete chain of certificates (without  the
              top  level  CA-certificate). davfs2 only sends the client certificate. To work around this bug the
              server must store and trust the complete chain of CA-certificates down to the one CA that  isssued
              the client certificate.

       <b>secrets</b>
              Name  of a file that holds the credentials for servers and the proxy, and passwords to decrypt the
              client certificate. The name must be an absolute path. The file must be read and writable  by  the
              owner only (mode 600).
              Default: <a href="file:~/.davfs2/secrets">~/.davfs2/secrets</a>
              <b>Only</b>   <b>allowed</b>   <b>in</b>  <b>the</b>  <b>user</b>  <b>configuration</b>  <b>file.</b>  The  system  wide  secrets  file  is  always
              <u>/etc/davfs2/secrets</u>.

       <b>ask_auth</b>
              Ask the user interactively for credentials and passwords if not found in the secretsfile. Ask  the
              user if a servercert cannot be verified. 0 = no, 1 = yes.
              Default: 1

       <b>use_locks</b>
              Whether to lock files on the server when they are opened for writing.  0 = no, 1 = yes.
              Default: 1

       <b>lock_owner</b>
              A  string  send to the server to identify the owner of a lock. If a WebDAV resource is used at the
              same time by different clients using the same credentials, different values for lock_owner  should
              be chosen.
              Default: the username from the credentials

       <b>lock_timeout</b>
              How  long in seconds locks should be valid, before the server removes them.  The server may ignore
              this and set its own timeout value.
              Default: 1800

       <b>lock_refresh</b>
              That many seconds before the lock times out, <b>mount.davfs</b> will try to refresh the lock.  The  value
              should be substantially greater than <b>delay_upload</b>.
              Default: 60

       <b>use_expect100</b>
              To  avoid   uploading  big  files  that will be refused by the server, <b>mount.davfs</b> uses the header
              <u>expect:</u> <u>100-continue</u> to get the o.k.  from the server before uploading. Not all servers understand
              this.  0 = no, 1 = yes.
              Default: 0

       <b>if_match_bug</b>
              Some servers do not  handle  If-Match  and  If-None-Match-headers  correctly.   This  otion  tells
              <b>mount.davfs</b> to use HEAD instead of thes headers.  0 = no, 1 = yes.
              Default: 0

       <b>drop_weak_etags</b>
              Popular  servers  send a weak etag whenever they are not able to calculate a strong one. This weak
              etag will never be valid, but after one second it is silently turned into a  strong,  valid  etag.
              With  this  flag  set  to  1,  <b>mount.davfs</b>  will  never use this weak etags. If the flag is 0, the
              weakness indicator will be removed and the etag is assumed to be strong. There is some  danger  of
              the Lost-Update-Problem with this. But it is minimized when using locks.
              You  should turn this on, when you can't use locks and there is the danger of concurrent access to
              the same resource. In this case the etag is not used at all and the resource cannot be cached.
              0 = no, 1 = yes.
              Default: 0

       <b>n_cookies</b>
              Some servers will only work when they are allowed to set a cookie and this cookie is  returned  in
              subsequent  requests. This option sets the number of cookies you are willing to accept and include
              in subsequent requests. davfs2 will only care for the name and the value of the cookie and  ignore
              all of the possible attributes.
              Default: 0

       <b>precheck</b>
              If  option <b>if_match_bug</b> is set: use HEAD-requests to check for existence or modification of a file
              to avoid unintended overwriting what somebody else changed. Has no effect if  option  <b>if_match_bug</b>
              is 0. You should only set it 0, if there is no concurrent access to the server.  0 = no, 1 = yes.
              Default: 1

       <b>ignore_dav_header</b>
              Some  servers send wrong information about their capabilities in the DAV-header.  In this case the
              header should be ignored.
              Default: 0

       <b>use_compression</b>
              Use gzip-compression for downloading files, if supported by the server.   Uploads  will  still  be
              uncompressed.
              Default: 0

       <b>min_propset</b>
              Some  servers  are  reported to significantly slow down when the Etag and Last-Modified properties
              are requested. This option will reduce the set of WebDAV-properties requested from the  server  to
              the minimal set. Don't use it if your file system is used for reading and writing. Without Etag or
              Last-Modified  davfs2  will  not  be  able  to check for changes on the server which may result in
              unnecessary downloads and lost updates. This option will also effectively disable caching of files
              because files in the cache can't be reused.
              Default: 0

       <b>follow_redirect</b>
              If the server redirects a GET-request to a different resource (maybe on a different  server)  then
              follow this redirection.
              Currently  there  are  some restrictions: all redirects are treated as temporary redirects; if the
              new server requires authentication then the same credentials are use as for the  original  server;
              if the connection is over TLS the server certificate will be checked against the trusted CAs known
              by  the  system;  user configured server certificates and client certificates are not used for the
              new server.
              Default: 0

       <b>sharepoint_href_bug</b>
              SharePoint does not properly encode UTF8-characters within the href-element.  Because of this some
              files are invisible because the href-element violates  the  rules.  Neon  0.31  and  newer  has  a
              workaround for this SharePoint bug. This option will activate this workaround.
              Default: 0

       <b>server_charset</b>
              When  extracting  file  names from the path component of the URL, <b>mount.davfs</b> will assume they are
              encoded using this character set and translate file names to the local character set. This is  <b>not</b>
              about encoding of file contents and <b>not</b> about HTTP escaping rules.
              There  is no means in HTTP to know the character encoding of the path component. There may be even
              different encodings within the same path, as the encoding of file names is often  defined  by  the
              clients  that  created  them.   Nowadays  it  is  best  to  use  only  UTF-8 encoding and to do no
              conversion. If you are not sure that all clients understand UTF-8, restrict  file  names  to  pure
              us-ascii.  Never  use characters in file names, that may have a special function on some operating
              systems (like /, : and \).
              Default: no character set conversion

       <b>connect_timeout</b>
              When creating a TCP connection to the server <b>mount.davfs</b> will wait that many seconds for an answer
              before assuming an error. If a value of '0' is used then no explicit timeout handling is  set  and
              the connect call will only timeout as dictated by the TCP stack.
              This  parameter  only  takes effect if the version of neon in use (neon version &gt; 0.26) and the OS
              support non-blocking I/O.
              Default: 10

       <b>read_timeout</b>
              How long in seconds <b>mount.davfs</b> will wait for an answer from the server before assuming an error.
              Default: 30

       <b>retry</b>  When <b>mount.davfs</b> can not reach the server it will try again after <b>retry</b>  seconds.  For  subsequent
              retries the interval will be increased up to <b>max_retry</b> seconds.
              Default: 30

       <b>max_retry</b>
              Maximum value of the retry interval.
              Default: 300

       <b>max_upload_attempts</b>
              When  uploading a changed file fails temporarily <b>mount.davfs</b> will retry with increasing intervals,
              but not more often than this.
              With a bad connection this will cause additional traffic. To reduce traffic caused by unsuccessful
              attempts option <b>use_expect100</b> can be set. But please test it. Most proxies and some servers  don't
              support this header.
              Default: 15

       <b>add_header</b>
              Your  server  might expect special headers to do what you want. Different from other options, this
              one takes two values: the name of the header and its value.  Some  ASP-backends  to  IIS  seem  to
              require the Microsoft specific header "Translate: F". You can add it like this:
              add_header Translate F
              <b>mount.davfs</b> will add header "Translate: F" on all requests.
              This  option  is cumulative. You can enter more than one add_header option and all of them will be
              added. Also add_header options from /etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf and <a href="file:~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf">~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf</a> are merged.

</pre><h4><b>Cache</b> <b>Related</b> <b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>backup_dir</b>
              Each mounted davfs2 file system has a directory to store backups of files that could not be stored
              back to the server. This sets the  name  of  this  directory.  You  should  regularly  check  this
              directory.
              Default: lost+found

       <b>cache_dir</b>
              The directory where <b>mount.davfs</b> will store cached files. For every mount point a subdirectory will
              be created.
              In the systemwide configuration file this will set the system wide cache, used by root. In a users
              configuration file it will set the cache used by this user.
              Defaults: /var/cache/davfs2 and <a href="file:~/.davfs2/cache">~/.davfs2/cache</a>

       <b>cache_size</b>
              The  amount of disk space in MiByte that may be used. <b>mount.davfs</b> will always take enough space to
              cache open files, ignoring this value if necessary.
              Default: 50

       <b>table_size</b>
              <b>mount.davfs</b> maintains a hash table with an entry for each known file or directory. This gives  the
              number  of  entries  in  this  table.  For  large  file systems (more than some hundreds of files)
              increasing this number may speed up file operations. The value should be a power of 2.
              Default: 1024

       <b>dir_refresh</b>
              After <b>mount.davfs</b> has got information about files in a directory it considers it  valid  for  this
              time  in  seconds.  Note:  This  does  not  affect  opening of files and reading a directory by an
              application.
              Default: 60

       <b>file_refresh</b>
              When a file or directory is opened by an application, <b>mount.davfs</b> will first check the server  for
              a  newer version. But some applications do open calls on the same file in short sequence. To avoid
              unnecessary traffic <b>mount.davfs</b> will wait that many seconds before it send a new request  for  the
              same information.
              Default: 1

       <b>delay_upload</b>
              When  a  file  that  has been changed is closed, <b>mount.davfs</b> will wait that many seconds before it
              will upload it to the server. This will avoid uploading of temporary files that  will  be  removed
              immediately  after  closing.   If  you  need  the  files to appear on the server immediately after
              closing, set this option to 0.
              Default: 10

       <b>gui_optimize</b>
              When a file is opened, <b>mount.davfs</b> will have to check the server whether there is a newer version.
              Graphical User Interfaces tend to open just any file, slowing down things dramatically  for  large
              directories.   With  this  option <b>mount.davfs</b> will try to get this information from all files in a
              directory with one PROPFIND request. 0 = no, 1 = yes.
              Default: 0

       <b>minimize_mem</b>
              davfs2 holds information about files and directories in the working memory. It will stay there  as
              long  as  the  file  system is mounted and the file is not deleted. By this memory usage by davfs2
              will grow over time and may slow down davfs2. With this option set  to  1  davfs2  will  regularly
              clean the memory from information that has not be used for some time.  0 = no, 1 = yes.
              <b>Warning:</b> Most file attributes are only maintained locally because there is no corresponding WebDAV
              property.  So  if users change attributes (owner, group, access bits) locally this changes will be
              lost and attribute values will be reset to the default values.
              Default: 0

</pre><h4><b>Debugging</b> <b>Options</b></h4><pre>
       <b>debug</b>  Send debug messages to the syslog daemon. The value  tells  what  kind  of  information  shall  be
              logged. The messages are send with facility LOG_DAEMON and priority LOG_DEBUG. It depends from the
              configuration  of  the  syslog  daemon  where  the  messages  will go (propably /var/log/messages,
              <a href="file:/var/log/syslog">/var/log/syslog</a> or /var/log/daemon.log). Whether HTTP related debug messages are available depends
              on your neon library.
              Unlike other options, this option is cumulative. If there are several debug entries with different
              values, all of  them  will  be  applied.  Also  debug  options  from  /etc/davfs2/davfs2.conf  and
              <a href="file:~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf">~/.davfs2/davfs2.conf</a> are merged.
              <b>Note:</b>  Debug messages let the log-files grow quickly. Never use this option in normal operation of
              mount.davfs.
              Default: no debugging messages
