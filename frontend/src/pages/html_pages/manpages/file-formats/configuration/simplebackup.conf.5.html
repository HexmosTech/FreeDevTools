</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       <b>simplebackup.conf</b> - configuration file for <u><a href="../man1/simplebackup.1.html">simplebackup</a></u>(1)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This file contains the configuration for the backups done by <u><a href="../man1/simplebackup.1.html">simplebackup</a></u>(1).

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       This  file  is  a <u><a href="../man1/bash.1.html">bash</a></u>(1) shell script.  It is used to set some shell variables and a shell function that
       are used by the backup script.  Be careful in what you write here: the configuration file is sourced  and
       all commands within are executed on the beginning of a backup.

</pre><h4><b>VARIABLES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>SILENT</u> If set to <u>true</u>, simplebackup will print only errors and warnings.

       <u>TARGETDIR</u>
              This  is  the  directory  where  the backup is written to.  Be sure to have enough free disk space
              here.

       <u>WORKDIR</u>
              This is the directory where the backup is prepared.  Disk space needed here is the sum of all data
              to be backed up.  This directory will be deleted on startup, so don't point to anyting important.

       <u>BACKUPDIRS</u>
              These paths and their subdirectories are to be backed up while crossing  file  system  boundaries.
              Use : to separate multiple paths.

       <u>BACKUPDIRS_ONEFS</u>
              These  paths  and  their  subdirectories  are  to be backed up.  No file system boundaries will be
              crossed.  Use : to separate multiple paths.

       <u>NAME</u>   This is the name of the backup.  It is later prepended with a timestamp.

       <u>LOCKFILE</u>
              This lockfile is used to detect another running backup.  You can run multiple different backups in
              parallel by using different lockfiles in different configurations.

       <u>NICELEVEL</u>
              Nice level to run with.  20 is low priority, 0 is normal, -20 is high priority (only root  can  do
              this).

       <u>CHROOT</u> Chroot  path.   If  you  want to backup another system that is reachable via your file system, you
              have to point this variable to  the  other  system's  root  directory.   Leave  empty  for  normal
              operation.

</pre><h4><b>FUNCTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>extracommands()</u>
              These  commands  are executed before the backup.  Here you can dump databases, save your partition
              layout etc.  Put additional files to  be  backed  up  into  <u>$WORKDIR</u>  or  subdirectories  thereof.
              <u>extracommand()</u> is executed before entering a possible <u>$CHROOT</u>.

       <u>postcopy()</u>
              These  commands  are  executed  after copying all files into the <u>$WORKDIR</u>, but before putting them
              into the backup archive.  If some files need to be excluded from the <u>$BACKUPDIRS</u> then delete  them
              here.  <u>postcopy()</u> is executed outside a possible <u>$CHROOT</u>.

       <u>postbackup()</u>
              These  commands  are  executed  after  the  backup.   The  new  backup  filename  is  available as
              $BACKUPFILE.
