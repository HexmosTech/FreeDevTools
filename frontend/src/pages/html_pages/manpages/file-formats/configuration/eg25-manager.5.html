</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       eg25-manager configuration file format

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       eg25-manager uses toml formatted files for configuration.

       Configurations are loaded from:
           •   <b>/etc/eg25-manager/&lt;compatible&gt;.toml</b>: User-provided overrides (optional)
           •   <b>/usr/share/eg25-manager/&lt;compatible&gt;.toml</b>: Default configuration (required)

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>manager</b></h4><pre>
       General settings for eg25-manager.

       <b>poweron_delay</b> int (microseconds)
           Delay between de-asserting RESET and starting the PWRKEY sequence.

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>suspend</b></h4><pre>
       Settings for how to handle suspend on the system where eg25-manager is running.

       <b>boot_timeout</b> int (seconds)
           Prevent the system from suspending for boot_timeout seconds to allow the modem to fully boot.

           Default: 120 if unset or zero.

       <b>recovery_timeout</b> int (seconds)
           Amount of time to wait for the modem to reappear after suspend. If the timeout is reached the modem's
           USB connection will be reset.

           Default: 9 if unset or zero.

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>at</b></h4><pre>
       AT commands to send when different events happen, and where to send them to.

       Each command has 4 possible elements:
           •   <b>cmd</b>: the AT command itself, which will be translated to "AT+`cmd`"
           •   <b>subcmd</b>:  the  subcommand  in  case a single AT command can be used to change multiple parameters,
               such as QCFG
           •   <b>value</b>: the command's argument(s), usually used to set the value of a specific parameter
           •   <b>expect</b>: the expected return value; the command is first executed without any value  in  order  to
               query  the  current state. This state is then compared to the <b>expect</b> string; if they don't match,
               the command is then executed with value <b>expect</b> in order to set  the  parameter  to  the  expected
               value
       A command can have <b>expect</b> OR <b>value</b> configured, but it shouldn't have both

       <b>NOTE:</b>  If a command sequence is configured in an override file, the default commands won't be loaded from
       the system configuration. The default commands should be copied into  the  override  file  when  changing
       them.

       <b>uart</b> string
           The serial port to use for sending AT commands to the modem.

       <b>configure</b> List of commands
           AT commands to send to the modem when it is first started.

       <b>suspend</b> List of commands
           AT commands to send to the modem before the system suspends.

       <b>resume</b> List of commands
           AT commands to send to the modem after the system resumes from suspend.

       <b>reset</b> List of commands
           AT commands to send to the modem if resetting the usb port fails.

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>gnss</b></h4><pre>
       Settings for uploading AGPS assistance data to the modem.

       <b>enabled</b> boolean
           Enable or disable uploading AGPS data to the modem

       <b>url</b> string
           The directory on the server that contains the assistance files

           Example: https://xtrapath4.izatcloud.net

       <b>file</b> string
           The name of the assistance file on the server.

           Example: xtra2.bin

</pre><h4><b>SECTION:</b> <b>gpio</b></h4><pre>
       The  <b>gpio</b>  section defines the GPIO pins to use for different modem functions. These settings should only
       be changed when porting eg25-manager to a new device; for this reason they aren't documented here.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       Print the firmware version every time the phone wakes from suspend:
           [at]
           resume = [
               { cmd = "QGMR" },
           ]

       Disable uploading AGPS data to the modem:
           [gnss]
           enabled = false
