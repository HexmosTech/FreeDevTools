</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       greetd - configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       greetd uses a simple TOML configuration file to define its behavior.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration is divided into <b>sections</b>. Sections are delimited like so:

           [section_name]
           config_key = value

       Configuration  keys  can  be integer literals, or quote-delimited strings. The configuration sections are
       described below.

   <b>terminal</b>
       This section contains terminal configuration.

       <b>vt</b> = num|"next"|"current"
           The VT to run on. Can be the number of a specific VT, "next" to select  the  next  available  VT,  or
           "current"  to stay wherever greetd was started. The specific VT is evaluated at startup, and does not
           change during the execution of greetd.

           If using the current or a specific VT, you must ensure that there are no other users of that  VT.  If
           using  systemd  with  autovt  and  getty,  conflict avoidance can be handled in the service unit with
           "Conflicts=<a href="mailto:getty@ttyN.service">getty@ttyN.service</a>", where N is the VT number.

           Use of a specific VT with appropriate conflict avoidance is recommended.

       <b>switch</b> = true|false
           Whether or not to switch to <b>vt</b>.

           If set to false and <b>vt</b> is not currently active VT, greetd will wait for <b>vt</b> to become  active,  before
           doing anything including starting greeter.

           If set to true, greetd will switch current VT to <b>vt</b>,

           Default is true.

   <b>general</b>
       This  section  contains  general  configuration  that does not fit in other sections nor deserved its own
       section.

       <b>source_profile</b> = true|false
           Whether or not to source <a href="file:~/.profile">~/.profile</a> and <a href="file:/etc/profile">/etc/profile</a> if present when running  commands.  Defaults  to
           true.

       <b>runfile</b> = path-to-runfile
           Location of greetd's runfile that is created during the first run to prevent the initial session from
           being run again on session termination or on greetd restart.

           This file should be in a location that is cleared during a reboot.

   <b>default_session</b>
       This section describes the default session, also referred to as the <b>greeter</b>.

       <b>command</b> = command-line
           The  command-line  that  greetd  will  run  to start the default session, e.g. "agreety -c sway". The
           default session is automatically started when no other session  is  running,  such  as  when  a  user
           session terminates or when greetd is initially started with no initial session configured.

           The command-line is run by <b><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></b>(1), and as such accepts standard POSIX shell syntax.

           See <b><a href="../man7/greetd-ipc.7.html">greetd-ipc</a></b>(7) for information on how a greeter can create sessions.

       <b>user</b> = user
           The user to use for running the greeter. Defaults to "greeter".

   <b>initial_session</b>
       This optional section describes the initial session, commonly referred to as "auto-login".

       The  initial  session  will only be executed during the first run of greetd since boot in order to ensure
       signing out works properly and to prevent security issues whenever greetd or the greeter  exit.  This  is
       checked through the presence of the runfile.

       <b>command</b> = command-line
           The  command-line that greetd will run to start the initial session, e.g. "sway". The initial session
           will be started exactly once when greetd is initially launched.

           The command-line is run by <b><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></b>(1), and as such accepts standard POSIX shell syntax.

       <b>user</b> = user
           The user to use for running the initial session.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Regular</b> <b>setup</b> <b>with</b> <b>agreety</b> <b>and</b> <b>sway</b>
           [terminal]
           vt = 1

           [default_session]
           command = "agreety -c sway"

   <b>Auto-login</b>
           [terminal]
           vt = 1

           [default_session]
           command = "agreety -c sway"

           [initial_session]
           command = "sway"
           user = "john"
