       papd.conf  —  Configuration  file  used  by  papd  to determine the configuration of printers used by the
       Netatalk printing daemon

</pre><h4><b>Description</b></h4><pre>
       <b>papd.conf</b> is the configuration file used by papd to configure the printing services offered by  netatalk.
       <u>papd</u> shares the same defaults as lpd on many systems. One notable exception is Solaris.

       The  format  of  papd.conf  is  derived  from  <b><a href="../man5/printcap.5.html">printcap</a></b>(5) and can contain configurations for one or more
       printers. Any line not prefixed with <u>#</u> is interpreted. The configuration lines are composed like this:

       <u>printername:[options]</u>

       On systems running a System V printing system, the simplest case is to have either no  papd.conf,  or  to
       have  one  that  has no active lines. In this case, <b>atalkd</b> should auto-discover the local printers on the
       machine. Please note that you can split lines with a <u>\</u> (backslash).

       printername may be just a name (<u>Printer</u> <u>1</u>), or it  may  be  a  full  name  in  nbp_name  format  (<u>Printer</u>
       <u>1:LaserWriter@My</u> <u>Zone</u>).

       Systems  using a BSD printing system should make use of a pipe to the printing command in question within
       the <u>pr</u> option (e.g.  <u>pr=|/usr/bin/lpr</u>).

       When CUPS support is compiled in, then <u>cupsautoadd</u> as the first entry  in  papd.conf  will  automagically
       configure  and  make  all  CUPS  printers  available  to  papd  (customizable  –  see below). This can be
       overwritten for individual printers by subsequently adding individual entries using the CUPS  queue  name
       as <u>pr</u> entry. Note: CUPS support is mutually exclusive with System V support described above.

       The  possible  options  are  colon delimited (<u>:</u>), and lines must be terminated with colons. The available
       options and flags are:

       <b>am=(uams</b> <b>list)</b>

              The <b>am</b> option allows specific UAMs to be specified for a particular printer. It has no  effect  if
              the  <b>au</b>  flag is not present. Note: possible values are <u>uams_guest.so</u> and <u>uams_clrtxt.so</u> only. The
              first method requires a valid username, but no password. The second requires both a valid username
              and the correct password.

       <b>au</b>

              If present, this flag enables authentication for the printer.

       <b>co=(CUPS</b> <b>options)</b>

              The <u>co</u> option allows options to be passed through to CUPS (e.g.  <u>co=“protocol=TBCP”</u> or <u>co=“raw”</u>).

       <b>cupsautoadd[:type][@zone]</b>

              If used as the first entry in papd.conf this will share all  CUPS  printers  via  papd.  type/zone
              settings  as  well  as  other parameters assigned to this special shared printer will apply to all
              CUPS printers.  Unless the <u>pd</u> option is set, the CUPS PPDs will be used. To overwrite these global
              settings for individual printers simply add them subsequently to papd.conf  and  assign  different
              settings.

       <b>fo</b>

              If  present,  this  flag  enables  a  hack to translate line endings originating from pre-Mac OS X
              LaserWriter drivers to let <u>foomatic-rip</u> recognize foomatic PPD options set in the printer  dialog.
              Attention: Use with caution since this might corrupt binary print jobs!

       <b>op=(operator)</b>

              This specifies the operator name, for lpd spooling. Default value is “operator”.

       <b>pa=(appletalk</b> <b>address)</b>

              Allows specification of AppleTalk addresses. Usually not needed.

       <b>pd=(path</b> <b>to</b> <b>ppd</b> <b>file)</b>

              Specifies a particular PPD (printer description file) to associate with the selected printer.

       <b>pr=(lpd/CUPS</b> <b>printer</b> <b>name</b> <b>or</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>command)</b>

              Sets the <u>lpd</u> or <u>CUPS</u> printer that this is spooled to. Default value is “lp”.

</pre><h4><b>Examples</b></h4><pre>
       Unless  CUPS  support has been compiled in (which is default from Netatalk 2.0 on) one simply defines the
       lpd queue in question by setting the <b>pr</b> parameter to the queue name, in the following example “ps”. If no
       <b>pr</b> parameter is set, the default printer will be used.

   <b>Example:</b> <b>papd.conf</b> <b>System</b> <b>V</b> <b>printing</b> <b>system</b> <b>examples</b>
       The first spooler is known by the AppleTalk name Mac Printer Spooler, and uses  a  PPD  file  located  in
       <u>/usr/share/lib/ppd</u>.  In addition, the user mcs will be the owner of all jobs that are spooled. The second
       spooler is known as HP Printer and all options are the default.

              Mac Printer Spooler:\
                 :pr=ps:\
                 :pd=/usr/share/lib/ppd/HPLJ_4M.PPD:\
                 :op=mcs:

              HP Printer:\
                 :

       An alternative to the technique outlined above is to  direct  papd’s  output  via  a  pipe  into  another
       program. Almost any printing system can be driven using this mechanism.

   <b>Example:</b> <b>papd.conf</b> <b>examples</b> <b>using</b> <b>pipes</b>
       The  first  spooler  is  known  as  HP  8100.  It  pipes the print job to <u>/usr/bin/lpr</u> for printing. PSSP
       authenticated printing is enabled, as is CAP-style authenticated printing. Both methods support guest and
       cleartext authentication as specified by the ‘<b>am</b>’ option. The PPD used is <u>/etc/atalk/ppds/hp8100.ppd</u>.

              HP 8100:\
                 :pr=|/usr/bin/lpr -Plp:\
                 :sp:\
                 :ca=/tmp/print:\
                 :am=uams_guest.so,uams_clrtxt.so:\
                 :pd=/etc/atalk/ppds/hp8100.ppd:

       Starting with Netatalk 2.0, direct CUPS integration is available. In this case,  defining  only  a  queue
       name  as  <b>pr</b>  parameter won’t invoke the SysV lpd daemon but uses CUPS instead. Unless a specific PPD has
       been assigned using the <b>pd</b> switch, the PPD configured in CUPS will be used by <b>papd</b>, too.

       There exists one special share named “cupsautoadd”. If this is  present  as  the  first  entry  then  all
       available  CUPS  queues  will be served automagically using the parameters assigned to this global share.
       But subsequent printer definitions can be used to override these global settings for individual spoolers.

   <b>Example:</b> <b>papd.conf</b> <b>CUPS</b> <b>examples</b>
       The first entry sets up automatic sharing of all CUPS printers. All those shares appear in the zone  “1st
       floor”  and  since  no additional settings have been made, they use the CUPS printer name as NBP name and
       use the PPD configured in CUPS. The second entry defines different settings for one single CUPS  printer.
       Its NBP name is differing from the printer’s name and the registration happens in another zone.

              cupsautoadd@1st floor:op=root:

              Boss' LaserWriter@2nd floor:\
                 :pr=laserwriter-chief:

</pre><h4><b>Caveats</b></h4><pre>
       If  you  are  using  more than 15 printers in your network, you must specify AppleTalk zones for the papd
       printer configurations. Otherwise, only some of the printers may appear in the Chooser on Mac clients.
