       ekeyd.conf - entropy key configuration

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>/etc/entropykey/resolv.conf</b>

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The <u>ekeyd</u> daemon allows Entropy Keys to transfer their random data to the kernels random pool. The daemon
       configuration file is a series of statements each controlling an aspect of the daemons operation.

       If this file does not exist the daemon will not start.

       The different configuration options are:

       <b>TCPControlSocket</b> TCP port number to listen on.
              The daemon can be controlled using a TCP network connection. Any number of control connections may
              be  made  by  repeating  this  statement with differnt port numbers, there is no authentication or
              protection against clients which connet to this interface. The socket is always bound to localhost
              (127.0.0.1).

       <b>UnixControlSocket</b> UNIX domain socket to use.
              The  daemon  is  typically  controlled  using  a   unix   domain   socket   (<u>/var/run/ekeyd.sock</u>).
              Authentication is as for any file on a UNIX filesystem.

       <b>Keyring</b> The keyring file to use.
              The Entropy Key encrypts the data it sends to the host. To successfully decrypt this data the host
              requires the current encryption key. The keyring is a file containing a list of serial numbers and
              encryption keys. The keyring is generally updated using the <b><a href="../man8/ekey-lt-rekey.8.html">ekey-lt-rekey</a></b>(8) tool.

       <b>SetOutputToKernel</b> bits per byte to add to kernel pool.
              The Kernel maintains an entropy pool into which the <b><a href="../man8/ekeyd.8.html">ekeyd</a></b>(8) injects the entropy gathered from the
              Entropy  Keys.  The  data gathered from the Entropy Keys may be considered to have one shannon per
              bit so every bit gathered from the devices may be injected  into  the  kernel  pool.  However,  by
              default, to be conservative only seven of eight bits are entered into the kernel pool.

       <b>EGDUnixSocket</b> UNIX domain socket to use
              In this mode, which is mutually exclusive with the <b>SetOutputToKernel</b> output mode, <b><a href="../man8/ekeyd.8.html">ekeyd</a></b>(8) gathers
              the  entropy  from  the  attached  Entropy Keys and presents an <b><a href="../man8/EGD.8.html">EGD</a></b>(8) compatible interface on the
              named UNIX domain socket to access the data. This may optionally take an  octal  mode  string  and
              username  and  group  to  chmod  and chown the socket to. If you do not wish to change the user or
              group, use empty strings. You cannot change the user/group without also providing a  mode  string.
              The default is to leave the user/group alone and set the socket to mode 0600

       <b>EGDTCPSocket</b> TCP port number to listen on.
              In this mode, which is mutually exclusive with the <b>SetOutputToKernel</b> output mode, <b><a href="../man8/ekeyd.8.html">ekeyd</a></b>(8) gathers
              the entropy from the attached Entropy Keys and presents an <b><a href="../man8/EGD.8.html">EGD</a></b>(8) compatible interface on a socket
              on the specified port to access the data. The socket is bound to localhost (127.0.0.1) by default,
              but  a second optional string parameter can be used to specify a different IP address, so that the
              EGD protocol is exported more widely (e.g. for egd-linux to read from another machine).

       <b>AddEntropyKey</b> Device node of entropy key.
              Add an Entropy key to be managed by the <b><a href="../man8/ekeyd.8.html">ekeyd</a></b>(8) daemon. The encryption key for the  added  device
              should be available in the keyring.

       <b>AddEntropyKeys</b> Directory of device nodes of entropy keys.
              Adds  one  or  more  Entropy keys to be managed by the <b><a href="../man8/ekeyd.8.html">ekeyd</a></b>(8) daemon. The encryption key for the
              added devices should be available in the keyring. This is generally set to  <u>/dev/entropykey</u>  which
              is the location the default UDEV rules create symbolic links.
