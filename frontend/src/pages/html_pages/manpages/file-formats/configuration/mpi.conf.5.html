</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       mpi.conf - Slurm configuration file to allow the configuration of MPI plugins.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <b>mpi.conf</b>  is  an  ASCII file which defines parameters that control the behavior of MPI plugins. Currently
       the configuration file can only be used to configure the PMIx plugin, but it can be extended  to  support
       other  MPI plugins as well. The file will always be located in the same directory as the <b>slurm.conf</b>. This
       file is optional.

       Parameter names are case insensitive. Any text following a "#" in the configuration file is treated as  a
       comment  through  the  end  of  that line.  Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of
       Slurm daemons, daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution of the  command  "scontrol  reconfigure"
       unless otherwise noted.

       Settings  from  this  configuration  file  can  be  viewed  in the output of "scontrol show config". This
       configuration file can be included when using "configless" mode. Information from  mpi.conf  is  read  at
       startup or upon reconfigure by slurmctld and slurmd. Instances of slurmstepd for batch steps will receive
       information about the plugin requested from slurmd.

</pre><h4><b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>PMIxCliTmpDirBase</b>=&lt;<u>path</u>&gt;
              Directory to have PMIx use for temporary files.  Defaults to not being set.

       <b>PMIxCollFence</b>={mixed|tree|ring}
              Define  the  type  of fence to use for collecting inter-node data.  Defaults to not being set. See
              also <b>PMIxFenceBarrier</b>.

       <b>PMIxDebug</b>={0|1}
              Enable debug logging for the PMIx plugin.  Defaults to 0.

       <b>PMIxDirectConn</b>={true|false}
              Disable direct launching of tasks. Default is "true".

       <b>PMIxDirectConnEarly</b>={true|false}
              Allow early connections to a parent node.  Defaults to "false".

       <b>PMIxDirectConnUCX</b>={true|false}
              Allow PMIx to use UCX for communication.  Defaults to "false".

       <b>PMIxDirectSameArch</b>={true|false}
              Enable additional communication optimizations when <b>PMIxDirectConn</b> is set to true, assuming all the
              job's nodes have the same architecture.  Defaults to "false".

       <b>PMIxEnv</b>=&lt;<u>environment</u> <u>variables</u>&gt;
              Semicolon separated list of environment variables to be set in job  environments  to  be  used  by
              PMIx. Defaults to not being set.

       <b>PMIxFenceBarrier</b>={true|false}
              Define  whether  to  fence  inter-node communication for data collection.  Default is "false". See
              also <b>PMIxCollFence</b>.

       <b>PMIxNetDevicesUCX</b>=&lt;<u>device</u> <u>type</u>&gt;
              Type of network device to use for communication.  Defaults to not being set.

       <b>PMIxTimeout</b>=&lt;<u>time</u>&gt;
              The maximum time (in seconds) allowed for communication between hosts to take place.  Defaults  to
              300 seconds.

       <b>PMIxTlsUCX</b>=&lt;<u>tl1</u>&gt;[,&lt;<u>tl2</u>&gt;...]
              Sets  the  UCX_TLS variable which restricts the transports to use. The accepted values are defined
              in the UCX documentation and may vary between installations.  Multiple values can be set and  must
              be  separated  by  commas.   If not set, UCX tries to use all available transports and selects the
              best ones according to their performance capabilities and scale.  Defaults to not being set.
