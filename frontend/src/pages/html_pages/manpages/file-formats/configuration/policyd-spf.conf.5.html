</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       policyd-spf - policyd-spf python configuration parameters

</pre><h4><b>VERSION</b></h4><pre>
       3.1.0

</pre><h4><b>USAGE</b></h4><pre>
       Usage:
         policyd-spf [/etc/postfix-policyd-spf-python/policyd-spf.conf]

</pre><h4><b>OTHER</b> <b>DOCUMENTATION</b></h4><pre>
       This  documentation  assumes  you have read Postfix's README_FILES/ SMTPD_POLICY_README and are generally
       familiar with Sender Policy Framework (SPF).  See RFC 7208 for details.

       man 1 policyd-spf provides general operation documentation for this package.

       man 5 policyd-spf.peruser provides documentation on setting up and using different configuration  options
       on a per user (mail reciepient) basis.

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       spf-engine  provides  both a Postfix policy server front end and a milter front end that can be used with
       any mail server which supports the milter protocol.  Most options apply to both policy server and  milter
       usage.   Options  specific  to  the  milter  are  listed at the end.  The package operates with a default
       installed configuration file and set of default configuration options that are used if the  configuration
       file  cannot  be  found.   These  options can be changed by changing the installed configuration files or
       through giving a path to an alternate configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Additionally, whitelisting certain IP addresses from SPF checks is supported.   This  man  page  and  the
       sample  configuration  file  show  the  format to use.  These options can be adjusted on a per user (mail
       recipient) basis.  Details on per user  settings  can  be  found  in  <a href="../man5/policyd-spf.peruser.5.html">policyd-spf.peruser</a>(5).   Per  user
       settings are applicable only to the policy server.

</pre><h4><b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
</pre><h4><b>LOGGING</b></h4><pre>
       "debugLevel" controls the amount of information logged by the policy server.

       The  default,  1,  logs no debugging messages, just basic policy results and errors generated through the
       policy server.  This value can be increased up to 5 (values higher than 5 will not cause  an  error,  but
       will not log any additional information).

       debug  level  2  adds a log message if no client address (IP address from which the connection was made),
       Mail From address, or HELO/EHLO name is received by the policy server, and logs SPF results for each Mail
       From and HELO check.

       debug level 3 generates a log message each time the policy server starts and each time it exits, as  well
       as  logging  a  copy of the exact header returned to Postfix to be prepended into the message.  Each time
       the policy server starts, debug level 3 also logs  the  configuration  information  used  by  the  policy
       server.

       debug level 4 logs the complete data set received by Postfix via the policy interface and when the end of
       the entry is read.

       debug  level 5 is used to debug config file processing and, for this purpose, can only be set in code and
       not via the config file.  It also provides additional internal status details generally of interest  only
       to developers.

       If debug level is 0, then the policy server logs errors only.

       When  set to -1, nothing is logged once the configuration file has been read in, not even error messages.
       Use with caution.

       Default:

       debugLevel = 1

</pre><h4><b>TEST</b> <b>OPERATION</b></h4><pre>
       The policy server can operate in a test only mode. This allows you to see the  potential  impact  of  SPF
       checking  in  your  mail  logs  without  rejecting  mail.  Headers are prepended in messages, but message
       delivery is not affected. This mode is not enabled by default.  To enable it, set TestOnly = 0.   If  you
       want test operation with no header added, also set Header_Type = None.

       Note: This option was previously named defaultSeedOnly.  This is still accepted, but logs an error.

       Default:

       TestOnly = 1

</pre><h4><b>HELO/EHLO</b> <b>CHECKING</b></h4><pre>
       HELO check rejection policy options are:

       Fail  - (Default) Reject only on HELO Fail. HELO/EHLO is known first in the SMTP dialogue and there is no
       practical reason to waste resources on Mail From checks if the HELO check will already cause the  message
       to be rejected.  This should not cause interoperability problems when used for HELO.

       SPF_Not_Pass - Reject if result not Pass, None, or Temperror (alternatively put, reject if the SPF result
       is Fail, Softfail, Neutral, PermError). Unlike Mail From checking, there are no standard e-mail use cases
       where  a  HELO check should not Pass if there is an SPF record for the HELO name (transparent forwarding,
       for example, is not an issue). HELO/EHLO is known first in the SMTP dialogue and there  is  no  practical
       reason  to  waste  resources  on  Mail From checks if the HELO check will already cause the message to be
       rejected. This is not consistent with the RFC 7208 requirement to treat none and neutral  the  same,  but
       should not cause interoperability problems when used for HELO.

       Softfail  -  Reject on HELO Softfail or Fail.  HELO/EHLO is known first in the SMTP dialogue and there is
       no practical reason to waste resources on Mail From checks if the  HELO  check  will  already  cause  the
       message to be rejected.  This should not cause interoperability problems when used for HELO.

       Null  -  Only  reject  HELO Fail for Null sender (SPF Classic).  This is the approach used by the pre-RFC
       4408 reference implementation and many of the pre- RFC specifications.   Use  of  at  least  this  option
       (SPF_Not_Pass or Fail) are preferred) is highly recommended.

       False  -  Never  reject  on  HELO,  append header only. This is useful for post-SMTP spam filters such as
       SpamAssassin.

       No_Check - Never check HELO.  This is only recommended if you are calling the policy server  twice  (once
       for  HELO checks and once for Mail From) with two different configuration files.  This approach is useful
       to get both the HELO and Mail From headers prepended to a message.

       Note: If No_Mail is set to True, it overrides rejections in any case where the SPF record is not  "v=spf1
       -all".

       Default:

       HELO_reject = Fail

</pre><h4><b>HELO/EHLO</b> <b>PASS</b> <b>RESTRICTION</b></h4><pre>
       HELO  Pass  Restriction allows integration with other Postfix access controls by provding a user supplied
       name of a postfix access restriction to be applied to a message when the HELO checking  result  is  Pass.
       The  indicated  restriction must be an action as defined for a Postfix SMTP server access table <a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a>(5)
       and explained in the Postfix RESTRICTION CLASS README.  The  README.per_user_whitelisting  file  provided
       with  this distribution provides examples. Note: A helo pass restriction will be the returned result even
       if the mail from result would cause the message to be rejected.

       Example:

       HELO_pass_restriction = helo_passed_spf

       Default:

       None

</pre><h4><b>Mail</b> <b>From</b> <b>CHECKING</b></h4><pre>
       Mail From rejection policy options are:

       SPF_Not_Pass - Reject if result not Pass/None/Tempfail. This option is not RFC 7208 compliant  since  the
       mail  with an SPF Neutral result is treated differently than mail with no SPF record and Softfail results
       are not supposed to cause mail rejection.  Global use of this option is not recommended.  Use  per-domain
       if needed (per-domain usage described below).

       Softfail  - Reject on Mail From Softfail or Fail.  Global use of this option is not recommended. Use per-
       domain if needed (per-domain usage described below).

       Fail (default) - Reject on Mail From Fail.

       False - Never reject on Mail From, append header only.  This is useful for post-SMTP spam filters such as
       SpamAssassin.

       No_Check - Never check Mail From/Return Path.  This is only recommended if you  are  calling  the  policy
       server  twice (once for HELO checks and once for Mail From) with two different configuration files.  This
       approach is useful to get both the HELO and Mail From headers prepended to a message.  It could  also  be
       used  to  do  HELO  checking  only  (because HELO checking has a lower false positive risk than Mail From
       checking), but this approach may not be fully  RFC  7208  compliant  since  the  Mail  From  identity  is
       mandatory if HELO checking does not reach a definitive result.

       Note:  If No_Mail is set to True, it overrides rejections in any case where the SPF record is not "v=spf1
       -all".  Default:

       Mail_From_reject = Fail

</pre><h4><b>Mail</b> <b>From</b> <b>PASS</b> <b>RESTRICTION</b></h4><pre>
       Mail From Pass Restriction allows integration with other Postfix  access  contlols  by  provding  a  user
       supplied  name  of  a  postfix  access restriction to be applied to a message when the Mail From checking
       result is Pass.  The indicated restriction must be an action as defined for a Postfix SMTP server  access
       table  <a href="../man5/access.5.html">access</a>(5)  and explained in the Postfix RESTRICTION CLASS README. The README.per_user_whitelisting
       file provided with this distribution provides examples. Note: A mail from pass restriction  will  be  the
       returned result even if the helo result would cause the message to be rejected.

       Example:

       Mail_From_pass_restriction = mfrom_passed_spf

       Default:

       None

</pre><h4><b>Limit</b> <b>Rejections</b> <b>To</b> <b>Domains</b> <b>That</b> <b>Send</b> <b>No</b> <b>Mail</b></h4><pre>
       No_Mail  - Only reject when SPF indicates the host/domain sends no mail. This option will only cause mail
       to be rejected if the HELO/Mail From record is "v=spf1 -all".  This option is useful for  rejecting  mail
       in  situations  where  the  tolerance for rejecting wanted mail is very low. It operates on both HELO and
       Mail From identities if set.

       Default:

       No_Mail = False

</pre><h4><b>Domain</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Receiver</b> <b>Policy</b></h4><pre>
       Using this option, a list of domains can be defined for special processing when messages do not Pass SPF.
       This can be useful for commonly spoofed domains that are  not  yet  publishing  SPF  records  with  -all.
       Specifically,  if  mail from a domain in this list has a Neutral/Softfail result, it will be rejected (as
       if it had a Fail result).  If needed, it is better to do it on a per-domain basis rather than globally.

       Example:

       Reject_Not_Pass_Domains = aol.com,hotmail.com

       Default:

       None

</pre><h4><b>Permanent</b> <b>Error</b> <b>Processing</b></h4><pre>
       Policy for rejecting due to SPF PermError options are:

       True - Reject the message if the SPF result (for HELO or Mail From) is  PermError.   This  has  a  higher
       short-term false positive risk, but does result in senders getting feedback that they have a problem with
       their SPF record.

       False  - Treat PermError the same as no SPF record at all.  This is consistet with the pre-RFC usage (the
       pre-RFC name for this error was "Unknown").

       This is a global option that affects both HELO and Mail From  scopes  when  checks  for  that  scope  are
       enabled. The only per scope setting that can over-ride this is Mail_From/HELO_reject = False/

       Default:

       PermError_reject = False

</pre><h4><b>Temporary</b> <b>Error</b> <b>Processing</b></h4><pre>
       Policy for deferring messages due to SPF TempError options are:

       True - Defer the message if the SPF result (for HELO or Mail From) is TempError.  This is the traditional
       usage  and  has proven useful in reducing acceptance of unwanted messages.  Sometimes spam senders do not
       retry.  Sometimes by the time a message is retried the sending IP has made it onto a DNS RBL and can then
       be rejected.  This is not the default because it is possible for some DNS errors that are  classified  as
       "Temporary" per RFC 7208 to be permanent in the sense that they require operator intervention to correct.

       This  is  a  global  option  that  affects  both HELO and Mail From scopes when checks for that scope are
       enabled. The only per scope setting that can over-ride this is Mail_From/HELO_reject = False/

       False - Treat TempError the same as no SPF record at all.  This is the default to minimize false positive
       risk.

       Default:

       TempError_Defer = False

</pre><h4><b>Prospective</b> <b>SPF</b> <b>Check</b></h4><pre>
       Prospective SPF checking - Check to see if mail sent from the defined IP address  would  pass.   This  is
       useful  for  outbound  MTAs to avoid sending mail that would Fail SPF checks when received.  Disable HELO
       checking when using this option.  It's only potentially useful  for  Mail  From  checking.  SPF  Received
       headers are not added when this option is used.

       Prospective = 192.168.0.4

       Default:

       None

</pre><h4><b>LOCAL</b> <b>SPF</b> <b>BYPASS</b> <b>LIST</b></h4><pre>
       Do  not  check  SPF  for localhost addresses - add to skip addresses to skip SPF for internal networks if
       desired. Defaults are standard IPv4 and IPv6 localhost addresses. This can also be used,  to  allow  mail
       from  local clients submitting mail to an MTA also acting as a Mail Submission Agent (MSA) to be skipped.
       An x-header is prepended indicating SPF checks were skipped due to a local  address.   This  is  a  trace
       header only.  Note the lack of spaces in the list.

       Default:

       skip_addresses = 127.0.0.0/8,::ffff:127.0.0.0/104,::1

</pre><h4><b>SPF</b> <b>IP</b> <b>WHITELIST</b></h4><pre>
       A  comma separated CIDR Notation list of IP addresses to skip SPF checks for.  Use this list to whitelist
       trusted relays (such as a secondary MX and trusted forwarders).  An x-header is prepended indicating  the
       IP  was  whitelisted  against  SPF  checks.  This is a trace header only.  Note the lack of spaces in the
       list.

       Example:

       Whitelist = 192.168.0.0/31,192.168.1.0/30

       Default:

       None

</pre><h4><b>SPF</b> <b>HELO</b> <b>WHITELIST</b></h4><pre>
       A comma separated HELO/EHLO host names to skip SPF checks for.  Use this list to whitelist trusted relays
       (such as a secondary MX and trusted forwarders) or to work around a host with a buggy SPF record.  An  x-
       header is prepended indicating the host was whitelisted against SPF checks.  This is a trace header only.
       Note the lack of spaces in the list.

       This option includes a check to ensure the connect IP address is referenced in an A or AAAA record by the
       HELO/EHLO  domain  that  is  whitelisted.  This is to avoid inadvertent bypass of SPF checks if HELO/EHLO
       names are forged.  If a HELO/EHLO domain is unable to pass such a forward IP address  match  check,  then
       use an SPF IP Whitelist for the host's IP address instead.

       Example:

       HELO_Whitelist = relay.example.com,sender.example.org

       Default:

       None

</pre><h4><b>SPF</b> <b>DOMAIN</b> <b>WHITELIST</b></h4><pre>
       Domain_Whitelist:  List  of domains whose sending IPs should be whitelisted from SPF checks.  Use this to
       list trusted forwarders by domain name.  Client IP addresses are tested against SPF records published  by
       the  listed  domains.   This is useful for large forwarders with complex outbound infrastructures and SPF
       records.  This option is less scalable than the SPF IP Whitelist.  An x-header  is  prepended  indicating
       the IP was whitelisted against SPF checks.  This is a trace header only.  This option does nothing if the
       domain  does  not  have  an  SPF  record.   In  this  case  use  the  SPF IP Whitelist described above or
       Domain_Whitelist_PTR (below). Note the lack of spaces in the list.

       Example:

       Domain_Whitelist = pobox.com,trustedforwarder.org

       Default:

       None

</pre><h4><b>PTR</b> <b>DOMAIN</b> <b>WHITELIST</b></h4><pre>
       Domain_Whitelist_PTR: List of domains (and subdomains)  whose sending IPs should be whitelisted from  SPF
       checks  based  on  PTR match of the domain. Use this to list trusted forwarders by domain name if they do
       not publish SPF records.  Client IP addresses PTR names are tested  to  see  if  they  match  the  listed
       domains.   This  is useful for large forwarders with complex outbound infrastructures, but no SPF records
       and predictable host naming. Matching is done using the same rules as the SPF PTR mechanism as  described
       in RFC 7208.  List the parent domain and all subdomains will match. This option is less scalable than the
       SPF  IP  Whitelist.  An x-header is prepended indicating the IP was whitelisted against SPF checks.  This
       is a trace header only.  This option does nothing if the host does not have a PTR record record.  In this
       case use the SPF IP Whitelist described above. Note the lack of spaces in the list.

       Example:

       Domain_Whitelist_PTR = yahoo.com,yahoogroups.com

       Default:

       None

</pre><h4><b>SPF</b> <b>ENHANCED</b> <b>STATUS</b> <b>CODES</b></h4><pre>
       By default, Postfix will use the 4/5.7.1 enhanced status code for defer/reject actions  from  the  policy
       server  (originally  defined  in  RFC 1893, RFC 3463 is the current reference).  New email authentication
       (including SPF) specific codes were defined in RFC 7372.  The policy server  now  overrides  the  Postfix
       enhanced status codes to use the RFC 7372 values.  This can be disabled by setting this option to "No" in
       the event of interoperability issues.

       Example:

       SPF_Enhanced_Status_Codes = No

       Default:

       Yes

</pre><h4><b>RESULTS</b> <b>HEADER</b></h4><pre>
       The standard method for documenting SPF results in a message (for consumption by downstream processes) is
       the  Received-SPF  header  defined  in  RFC  7208. This is the default header to use. Results can also be
       documented in the Authentication-Results header, which is also covered  in   RFC  7208.  The  default  is
       Received-SPF  (SPF),  but inclusion of Authentication-Results (AR) headers as an alternative to Received-
       SPF can be specified.

       If there is a requirement to prepend both Received-SPF and Authentication- Results headers, then it  must
       be  done  by  processing  the  message  with  more than one instance of the policy server using different
       configuration files with different Header_Type settings.

       For no header at all, use Header_Type = None.

       Examples:

       Header_Type = SPF or Header_Type = AR

       Default:

       SPF

</pre><h4><b>HIDE</b> <b>RCPT</b> <b>TO</b> <b>IN</b> <b>RESULTS</b> <b>HEADER</b></h4><pre>
       Both Received-SPF and Authentication-Results (AR) header fields include the receiving (RCPT TO) host,  if
       available.   In  this  application, it will always be the host of the first recipient sent by the sending
       MTA, even if that recipient is a BCC recipient.  This  is  unavoidable  as  neither  the  Postfix  policy
       interface  nor  the  milter  interface  provides  any  indication  if  the  recipient is BCC or not (this
       information is not available in until after SMTP DATA in the body of  the  message).   This  presented  a
       possible avenue for a privacy breach, but in version 3.0 it was modified to be only the host name and not
       the full address.

       Hide_Receiver  can set to Yes interest of maximizing privacy.  If per user processing is not in use, this
       setting will replace the actual host name with &lt;UNKNOWN&gt; both in header fields and SMTP  responses.   The
       latter  may  make it more difficult for senders to troubleshoot issues with their SPF deployments.  As an
       implementation detail, currently specifying any value other than No will result in  the  recipient  being
       hidden, but that may change in the future.  If per user processing is in use, this setting has no effect.

       For the milter interface, checks are always done at the Mail From stage in the SMTP protocol, so receiver
       data is never available.  When using the milter, this setting has no effect.

       Examples:

       Hide_Receiver = Yes or Hide_Receiver = No

       Default:

       No

</pre><h4><b>Authentications</b> <b>Results</b> <b>Authentication</b> <b>Identifier</b></h4><pre>
       Every Authentication-Results header field has an authentication identifier field ('Authserv_Id'). This is
       similar in syntax to a fully-qualified domain name. See policyd-spf.conf.5 and RFC 7001 paragraph 2.4 for
       details.   Default  is HOSTNAME. The results of socket.gethostname will be used unless an alternate value
       is specified.  An Authserv-Id must be provided if Header_Type 'AR' is used.

       The authentication identifier field provides a  unique  identifier  that  refers  to  the  authenticating
       service  within  a  given  administrative  domain.  The  identifier  MUST be unique to that domain.  This
       identifier is intended to be machine-readable and not necessarily meaningful to users.

       Example:

       Authserv_Id = mx.example.com

       Default:

       HOSTNAME

</pre><h4><b>DNS</b> <b>Timeout</b> <b>Limit</b></h4><pre>
       RFC 7208 recommends an elapsed time limit for SPF checks of at least 20 seconds.  Lookup_Time allows  the
       maximum  time  (seconds) to be adjusted.  20 seconds is the default.  This limit is applied separately to
       Mail From and HELO/EHLO checks, so if both are performed, the lookups may take up  to  twice  Lookup_Time
       (plus any additional time required for whitelisting related DNS lookups).

       It  is  important  that the combination of Lookup_Time(s) and applicable Whitelist_Lookup_Time(s) be less
       than the smtpd_policy_service_timeout defined for the service (default 100 seconds).  Since HELO and Mail
       From time limits are independent, smtpd_policy_service_timeout needs to  be  at  least  double  the  time
       allowed for the SPF policy server per entity type.

       Example:

       Lookup_Time = 20

       Default

       20 (seconds)

</pre><h4><b>Whitelist</b> <b>DNS</b> <b>Timeout</b> <b>Limit</b></h4><pre>
       Some   of  the  available  whitelisting  mechanisms,  i.e.  Domain_Whitelist,  Domain_Whitelist_PTR,  and
       HELO_Whitelist, require specific non-SPF DNS lookups to determine if a connection should be white  listed
       from  SPF  checks.  The maximum amount of time (in seconds) allocated for each of these checks, when used
       (none are enabled by default), is controlled by the Whitelist_Lookup_Time parameter.  It defaults  to  10
       seconds   and   is   applied   independently  to  each  whitelisting  method  in  use  (e.g.  if  both  a
       Domain_Whitelist_PTR and HELO_Whitelist are defined, together they may take up to 20 seconds).   This  is
       in addition to the time allowed for SPF Lookup_Time.

       It  is  important  that the combination of Lookup_Time(s) and applicable Whitelist_Lookup_Time(s) be less
       than the smtpd_policy_service_timeout defined for the service (default 100 seconds).  Since HELO and Mail
       From time limits are independent, smtpd_policy_service_timeout needs to  be  at  least  double  the  time
       allowed for the SPF policy server per entity type.

       Example:

       Whitelist_Lookup_Time = 10

       Default

       10 (seconds)

</pre><h4><b>DNS</b> <b>Void</b> <b>Lookup</b> <b>Limit</b></h4><pre>
       RFC  7208  adds  a new processing limit called "void lookup limit" (See section 4.6.4).  Void lookups are
       DNS queries within an SPF record for which DNS queries return either a positive answer (RCODE 0) with  an
       answer count of 0, or a "Name Error" (RCODE 3) answer.  This should not need to be changed.  Although new
       in  an  RFC in RFC 7208, this limit has been widely deployed in the Mail::SPF perl library without issue.
       Default is 2, but it can be adjusted.

       Example:

       Void_Limit = 2

       Default

       2

</pre><h4><b>Mock</b> <b>SPF</b> <b>Check</b> <b>To</b> <b>Add</b> <b>Milter</b> <b>Compatibility</b> <b>Header</b> <b>Field</b></h4><pre>
       In some versions of postfix, for bizarre Sendmail compatibility reasons, the first header field added  by
       a  policy server is not visible to milters.  To make this easy to work around, set the Mock value to true
       and a fixed header field will be inserted so the actual SPF check will be the second field and visible to
       milters such as DMARC milter.

       To use this feature requires additional postfix configuration to execute the second,  mock,  instance  of
       the policy server:

        Add a second service to /etc/postfix/master.cf:

               policyd-spf-mock  unix  -       n       n       -       0       spawn
                   user=nobody argv=/usr/bin/policyd-spf '/etc/pypolicyd-spf/mock

       Configure  the  Postfix  additional  policy  service  in  /etc/postfix/main.cf  to run before the regular
       service:

               smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
                   ...
                   reject_unauth_destination
                   check_policy_service unix:private/policyd-spf-mock
                   check_policy_service unix:private/policyd-spf
                   ...

       Create the specified configuration file in the location indicated with Mock set to True.

       Example:

       Mock = True

       Default

       False

</pre><h4><b>Log</b> <b>Queue</b> <b>ID</b></h4><pre>
       Include Postfix Queue ID in policy server log messages.  This option only applies to log  level  0  or  1
       messages  that  are unique to the policy server interface when configured for post-queue processing.  Not
       used for milter or common code logging.  Included  to  assist  with  correlating  logging  with  specific
       Postfix message processing.

       Example:

       QueueID = True

       Default

       True

</pre><h4><b>Reason</b> <b>Message/URL</b></h4><pre>
       If  a  message  is  rejected  or  deferred  because  of the SPF policy, a reason is given for logging and
       debugging purposes. The String configured supports the following format specifiers:

              rejectdefer - either the string 'rejected' or 'deferred'

              spf         - SPF result code

              url         - Parameterized URL to <a href="http://www.openspf.net/">http://www.openspf.net/</a> explaining SPF

       The default url can be overridden by setting Reason_URL.  It defaults to the defunct openspf.org URL  due
       to  a  lack  of  a  standardized alternative.  This is intended for use with a web service which provides
       additional information to a user.  The following components are supported and required:

       {0} - SPF result type (pass, fail, etc.)  {1} -  Result rationale provided  by  the  SPF  library  {2}  -
       Connect IP address {3} - Recipient address, if available

       All  four  components  must be included in your custom URL.  As shown in the default and the example, '='
       may be used in the URL.  This is the only configuration setting where it is allowed.

       Example:

       Reason_Message     =     Message      {rejectdefer}      due      to:      {spf}.       Reason_URL      =
       <a href="http://www.openspf.net/Why">http://www.openspf.net/Why</a>?s={0};id={1};ip={2};r={3}

       Default:

       Reason_Message   =   Message   {rejectdefer}   due   to:   {spf}.   Please   see   {url}   Reason_URL   =
       <a href="http://www.openspf.net/Why">http://www.openspf.net/Why</a>?s={0};id={1};ip={2};r={3}

</pre><h4><b>MILTER</b> <b>ONLY</b> <b>OPTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       <u>Socket</u> <u>(string)</u>
              Specifies the socket that should  be  established  by  the  filter  to  receive  connections  from
              <u><a href="../man1/postfix.1.html">postfix</a>(1)</u>  in  order  to  provide  service.  <u>socketspec</u> is in one of two forms: <u>local:path,</u> which
              creates a UNIX domain socket at the specified <u>path,</u> or <u>inet:port[@host]</u> or <u>inet6:port[@host]</u> which
              creates a TCP socket on the specified <u>port</u> and in the specified protocol family.  If the  <u>host</u>  is
              not  given  as either a hostname or an IP address, the socket will be listening on all interfaces.
              A literal IP address must be enclosed in  square  brackets.   This  option  is  mandatory  in  the
              configuration file.

       <u>PidFile</u> <u>(string)</u>
              Specifies  the  path  to a file that should be created at process start containing the process ID.
              If not specified, no such file will be created.

       <u>UserID</u> <u>(string)</u>
              Attempts to become the specified userid before starting operations.  The  value  is  of  the  form
              <u>userid[:group].</u>   The process will be assigned all of the groups and primary group ID of the named
              <u>userid</u> unless an alternate <u>group</u> is specified.

       <u>UMask</u> <u>(integer)</u>
              Requests a specific permissions mask to be used for file creation.  This only  really  applies  to
              creation  of  the  socket when <u>Socket</u> specifies a UNIX domain socket, and to the <u>PidFile</u> (if any);
              temporary files are created by the <u><a href="../man3/mkstemp.3.html">mkstemp</a>(3)</u> function that  enforces  a  specific  file  mode  on
              creation regardless of the process umask.  See <u><a href="../man2/umask.2.html">umask</a>(2)</u> for more information.

       <u>InternalHosts</u> <u>(dataset)</u>
              Identifies  a set internal hosts whose mail should be signed rather than verified.  The set should
              contain on each line a hostname, domain name (e.g. ".example.com"), IP address,  an  IPv6  address
              (including  an IPv4 mapped address), or a CIDR-style IP specification (e.g. "192.168.1.0/24").  An
              entry beginning with a bang ("!") character means "not", allowing  exclusions  of  specific  hosts
              that  are  otherwise members of larger sets.  Host and domain names are matched first, then the IP
              or IPv6 address depending on the connection type.  More precise entries are  preferred  over  less
              precise  ones,  i.e.  "192.168.1.1"  will  match  before "!192.168.1.0/24".  The text form of IPv6
              addresses will be forced to lowercase when queried (RFC5952), so the contents  of  this  data  set
              should  also  use  lowercase.   The  IP  address portion of an entry may optionally contain square
              brackets; both forms (with and without) will  be  checked.   If  not  specified,  the  default  of
              "127.0.0.1"  is applied.  Naturally, providing a value here overrides the default, so if mail from
              127.0.0.1 should be signed, the list provided here should include that address explicitly.

       <u>MacroList</u> <u>(dataset)</u>
              Defines a set of MTA-provided <u>macros</u> that should  be  checked  to  see  if  the  sender  has  been
              determined  to  be  a  local user and therefore whether or not the message checked.  If a <u>value</u> is
              specified matching a macro name in the data set, the  value  of  the  macro  must  match  a  value
              specified  (matching  is  case-sensitive), otherwise the macro must be defined but may contain any
              value.  The set is empty by default, meaning macros are not  considered  when  making  the  verify
              decision.   The  general  format  of  the  value is <u>value1[|value2[|...]];</u> if one or more value is
              defined then the macro must be set to one of the listed values, otherwise the macro  must  be  set
              but can contain any value.

              In order for the macro and its value to be available to the filter for checking, the MTA must send
              it  during the protocol exchange.  This is either accomplished via manual configuration of the MTA
              to send the desired macros or, for MTA/filter combinations that support the  feature,  the  filter
              can request those macros that are of interest.  The latter is a feature negotiated at the time the
              filter  receives a connection from the MTA and its availability depends upon the version of milter
              used to compile the filter and the version of the MTA making the connection.
