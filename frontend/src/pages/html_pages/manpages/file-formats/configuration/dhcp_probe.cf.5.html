</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dhcp_probe.cf - configuration file for dhcp_probe

</pre><h4><b>SYNPOSIS</b></h4><pre>
       /etc/dhcp_probe.cf

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  file  <b>/etc/dhcp_probe.cf</b>  contains  configuration  information  used  by  the  <b><a href="../man8/dhcp_probe.8.html">dhcp_probe</a></b>(8) daemon.
       dhcp_probe reads the file when it begins (and whenever it receives a SIGHUP signal).

       The location of this file defaults to <b>/etc/dhcp_probe.cf</b>, but may be overridden by a command-line  option
       to <b><a href="../man8/dhcp_probe.8.html">dhcp_probe</a></b>(8).

       The file consists of a series of statements, one per line.  Each statement begins with a keyword followed
       by  one  or  more arguments (depending on the keyword); keywords and arguments are separated by spaces or
       tabs.  Statements may be specified in any order.

       Some keywords take an <u>ethernet-address</u> argument.  Ethernet address values must be written in a form  that
       <b><a href="../man3/ether_aton.3.html">ether_aton</a></b>(3) recognizes; e.g.  1:2:3:4:5:6 or 00:A5:b2:0:BB:c.

       Some  keywords  take  an  <u>ip-address</u>  as  a  value.   IP  address  values  must be written in a form that
       <b><a href="../man3/inet_aton.3.html">inet_aton</a></b>(3) recognizes; e.g.  192.168.1.2.

       Blank lines are ignored.  Lines for which the first non-blank character is a '#' are treated as comments.
       Trailing comments on statements are <u>not</u> supported.

       Because all presently-defined keywords are optional, the file may be empty, however, it must exist.

</pre><h4><b>KEYWORDS</b></h4><pre>
       The keywords are as follows:

   <b>chaddr</b>
              The <b>chaddr</b> statement is optional, and is used to specify the value of  the  <u>chaddr</u>  field  in  the
              request  packets  sent  by  the  program.   This  value  is  also  used to compute the DHCP Client
              Identifier option in some of the request packets sent by the program (by prepending x'01').

              Specify:

                     chaddr <u>ethernet-address</u>

              If not specified, this value defaults to the Ethernet address corresponding to the  interface  you
              specified on the commandline.

              You might want to use the <b>chaddr</b> statement if the interface is also a DHCP client, so that sending
              requests  with  the  interface's  own  chaddr/DHCP  Client Identifier will not interfere with that
              functionality.

              If you specify a value, be sure to specify a unicast Ethernet address that does not belong to  any
              valid client on your network.

              Correctly-functioning  BootP  and  DHCP servers that respond will send any responses to the <u>chaddr</u>
              address, or in some cases, to the Ethernet broadcast address.  Therefore, if you specify  a  value
              here  (and  it differs from your interface's Ethernet address), the program will have to place the
              interface into promiscuous mode to be sure it hears unicast responses.

              Note that the <u>chaddr</u> value does not affect the Ethernet source address of the Ethernet frames sent
              by the program.

              If you specify this value, you may also wish to specify the same value in the <b>ether_src</b> statement.
              See the description of that statement for further discussion.

              The <b>chaddr</b> statement is required if <b>do_not_lookup_enet_and_ip_addresses</b> is specified.

   <b>ether_src</b>
              The <b>ether_src</b> statement is optional, and is used to specify the value of the  <u>ether_src</u>  field  in
              the Ethernet frames sent by the program.

              Specify:

                     ether_src <u>ethernet-address</u>

              If  not  specified, this value defaults to the Ethernet address corresponding to the interface you
              specified on the commandline.

              If you specify a value, be sure to specify a unicast Ethernet address that does not belong to  any
              valid client on your network.

              Note  that  this value does not affect the <u>chaddr</u> field or the DHCP Client Identifier option field
              in request packets sent by the program.

              If you specified a <u>chaddr</u> value, you may also wish to specify an equal <u>ether_src</u> value.  While not
              strictly necessary, doing so will cause any Layer 2 switches on the network  to  learn  that  this
              hardware  address  is  on your leg of the network, so they will not need to flood response packets
              directed to that hardware address, but instead can direct the response packets only to your leg of
              the network.

              Additionally, specifying the same <u>ether_src</u> <u>value</u> could help you discover any buggy BootP or  DHCP
              servers  that  mistakenly  direct  their  responses  to  the sender's ether_src (instead of to the
              sender's bootp_chaddr).

              The <b>ether_src</b> statement is required if <b>do_not_lookup_enet_and_ip_addresses</b> is specified.

   <b>do_not_lookup_enet_and_ip_addresses</b>
              The <b>do_not_lookup_enet_and_ip_addresses</b> statement is optional.  When not  specified,  the  program
              will  try  to  look up the Ethernet address of the network interface specified on the commandline.
              (It does so by querying the operating system for this information.)  In order to  do  so,  it  may
              need  to  first  look  up  the  IP  address of the network interface specified on the commandline.
              Performing either operation may be troublesome on some interfaces or platforms.  Failure of  these
              lookups is a fatal error.

              Specifying  <b>do_not_lookup_enet_and_ip_addresses</b>  instructs  the  program to not try to look up the
              interface's Ethernet address and IP address.

              If <b>do_not_lookup_enet_and_ip_addresses</b> is specified,  then  both  <b>ether_src</b>  and  <b>chaddr</b>  must  be
              specified.

              Specifying  <b>do_not_lookup_enet_and_ip_addresses</b>  may  allow  use  of  this  program  on interfaces
              configured with no IP address.

   <b>server_id</b>
              The <b>server_id</b> statement is optional, and is used to specify the value of the DHCP Server Identifer
              option in some of the request packets sent by the program.

              Specify:

                     server_id <u>ip-address</u>

              If not specified, this value defaults to 10.254.254.254.

              The DHCP Server Identifer option appears in the packets the program sends when it  mimics  a  DHCP
              client in the SELECTING state.

              It's  best that the DHCP Server Identifier option the program uses not match the IP address of any
              valid DHCP server on your network, to avoid confusing them.  Other than that, any IP address is  a
              reasonable value; you may wish to specify one that could never be a valid address on your network.

   <b>client_ip_address</b>
              The  <b>client_ip_address</b>  statement  is  optional,  and  is  used to specify the IP address that the
              program should request, or claim to have a lease on.

              Specify:

                     client_ip_address <u>ip-address</u>

              If not specified, this value defaults to 172.31.254.254.

              When the program generates a DHCPREQUEST packet that mimics a DHCP client that  is  in  the  INIT-
              REBOOT  or  SELECTING  state,  the  packet  contains a Requested IP Address option containing this
              value.  When the program generates a DHCPREQUEST packet that mimics a DHCP client that is  in  the
              REBINDING state, the packet contains a <u>ciaddr</u> field containing this value.

              It's  best  that  the  value the program uses not match the IP address of any valid DHCP client on
              your network, to avoid confusing valid DHCP servers.

              It's extremely useful if the value the program uses <u>not</u> be valid (topologically speaking) for  the
              physical  network  on  which the program sends the packets.  Sending a topologically inappropriate
              value may stimulate some DHCP servers to respond with a DHCPNAK, which helps the program flush out
              DHCP servers.

   <b>response_wait_time</b>
              The <b>response_wait_time</b> statement is optional, and is used to specify how long the  program  should
              wait for responses after sending a single request packet.

              Specify

                     response_wait_time <u>num_milliseconds</u>

              If not specified, this value defaults to 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds).

              The  value  is specified in milliseconds, and must fit into an 'int' on your host.  (Values larger
              than an 'int' may be silently misinterpreted.)  Typical values are on the order of a few  thousand
              milliseconds; i.e. several seconds.

   <b>cycle_time</b>
              The  <b>cycle_time</b>  statement  is  optional, and is used to specify how long the program should sleep
              between each probe cycle.

              Specify

                     cycle_time <u>num_seconds</u>

              If not specified, this value defaults to 300 seconds.

              The value is specified in seconds, and must into into an 'unsigned int'  on  your  host.   (Values
              larger  than  an 'unsigned int' may be silently misinterpreted.)  Typical valus range from several
              hundred to several thousand seconds (i.e. several minutes to several hours).

              During each probe cycle, the program sends  one  of  the  request  packet  flavors,  captures  any
              responses  that  arrive  during  the  <u>response_wait_time</u>,  then repeats this for each of the other
              request packet flavors.  After doing this for each flavor of request packet, the  probe  cycle  is
              complete, and the program sleeps for the <u>cycle_time</u>.

   <b>legal_server</b>
              The  <b>legal_server</b> statement is optional, and is used to specify the IP source address of responses
              that come from a legal BootP or DHCP server on your  network.   The  statement  may  be  specified
              multiple times.

              Specify

                     legal_server <u>ip-address</u>

              If  not  specified, the program assumes there are no legal BootP and DHCP servers on your network;
              all responses will be treated as coming from an unknown DHCP server.

              When the program receives a response packet, it compares the packet's IP source address to all the
              addresses you have specified in <b>legal_server</b> statements.  If the IP source address matches one  of
              these  values,  the  response is deemed to have come from a known DHCP server, and is ignored.  If
              the IP source address does not match any of these values (or you do not specify any <b>legal_server</b>),
              then the program logs a message that reports the packet's IP source address  and  Ethernet  source
              address.   Additionally,  if the program was started with the <b>-o</b> commandline option, the packet is
              also written to a packet capture file.

              If both <b>legal_server</b> and <b>legal_server_ethersrc</b> statements appear, then a response must have both a
              valid IP source and a valid ethernet source to be considered  to  have  come  from  a  known  DHCP
              server.

              When  relaying  a  response  from  a  server  to  a client, some BootP Relay Agents may change the
              response's IP source address, replacing the server's IP address  with  that  of  the  BootP  Relay
              Agent.  If BootP Relay Agents on your network do this, you will need to specify their IP addresses
              here instead.

   <b>legal_server_ethersrc</b>
              The  <b>legal_server_ethersrc</b>  statement  is  optional,  and  is  used to specify the Ethernet source
              address of responses that come from a legal BootP or DHCP server on your network.   The  statement
              may be specified multiple times.

              Specify

                     legal_server_ethersrc <u>ethernet-address</u>

              If not specified, the program does not check the Ethernet source address of responses.

              If  you  have  specified  at  least  one  <b>legal_server_ethersrc</b> value, when the program receives a
              response packet, the program compares the packet's Ethernet source address to  all  the  addresses
              you have specified in <b>legal_server_ethersrc</b> statements.  If the Ethernet source does not match one
              of these values, the response is deemed to have come from an unknown DHCP server; the program logs
              a  message that reports the packet's IP source address and Ethernet source address.  Additionally,
              if the program was started with the <b>-o</b> commandline option, the packet is also written to a  packet
              capture file.

              If both <b>legal_server</b> and <b>legal_server_ethersrc</b> statements appear, then a response must have both a
              valid  IP  source  and  a  valid  ethernet  source to be considered to have come from a known DHCP
              server.

              Each router on the path from the DHCP server to the DHCP client will overwrite the Ethernet source
              address field.  So if you specify any <b>legal_server_ethersrc</b> statements,  also  list  the  Ethernet
              source  value(s) for the last hop router(s).  A BootP Relay Agent on the path from the DHCP server
              to the DHCP client will overwrite the Ethernet field.  So also list the Ethernet  source  value(s)
              for the BootP Relay Agent.  (The BootP Relay Agent is often co-resident in the last-hop IP router,
              so you may have already taken care of this when you listed the last-hop router(s).

              The  <b>legal_server_ethersrc</b>  statement  is considered experimental in versions 1.3.0 - 1.3.1, as it
              has received only limited testing.

   <b>lease_network_of_concern</b>
              The <b>lease_network_of_concern</b> statement is optional, and may  be  specified  multiple  times.   The
              statement  is  used  to  specify one or more network ranges that are of concern relative to the IP
              addresses distributed by a rogue BootP/DHCP server.

              Specify

                     lease_network_of_concern <u>network-ip-address</u> <u>network-mask</u>

              Specifying one or more  <b>lease_network_of_concern</b>  statements  activates  the  "Lease  Networks  of
              Concern" feature.

              When  the  program  receives  a  response  packet that it determines to be from a rogue BootP/DHCP
              server, if the "Lease Networks of Concern" feature is active, the program will examine the  packet
              further.  If the packet's <b>yiaddr</b> field is non-zero, the value in that field is tested to see if it
              falls  within  any  of the "Leases Networks of Concern."  If it does, then the message the program
              logs is extended to also report this  fact,  and  to  include  the  value  of  the  <b>yiaddr</b>  field.
              Furthermore,  if  an  <b>alert_program_name2</b> was specified, when that program is called, it is called
              with an additional <b>-y</b> <b>yiaddr</b>  option.   (This  is  not  supported  if  an  <b>alert_program_name</b>  was
              specified, as the older <b>alert_program_name</b> uses a syntax that cannot be extended.)

              The  "Lease Networks of Concern" feature does not change the way the program probes for or detects
              rogue BootP/DHCP servers.  Upon detection of a rogue BootP/DHCP server, the feature only may cause
              additional information to be added to the message logged (and passed to <b>alert_program_name2</b>).

              This feature may be used, for example, by specifying your networks' legitimate address  ranges  as
              "Lease Networks of Concern".  While most rogue BootP/DHCP servers distribute private IP addresses,
              or  send  DHCPNAKs  to  legitimate  clients,  other  more  damaging  rogue  BootP/DHCP servers may
              distribute IP addresses  that  fall  within  your  legitimate  network  ranges.   This  will  help
              differentiate those more damaging incidents from the more common ones.

   <b>alert_program_name</b>
              The  <b>alert_program_name</b>  statement is optional, and may be used to specify the name of an external
              program that should be run every time a response packet is received from an unexpected server.

              Note that using the newer <b>alert_program_name2</b> statement is preferrable.

              Specify

                     alert_program_name <u>/absolute/path/name</u>

              Unexpected response packets are reported as a matter of course, and optionally written to a packet
              capture file.  You may use an <b>alert_program_name</b> to provide additional handling of the event,  for
              example,  to alert an appropriate party via mail or paging.  The <b>alert_program_name</b> you specify is
              called with four arguments in  the  following  order:  the  name  of  the  calling  program  (e.g.
              <b>dhcp_probe</b>),  the  name of the interface on which the unexpected response packet was received, the
              IP source address of the packet, and the Ethernet source address of the packet.

              As the <b>alert_program_name</b> is called with the same privileges as <b>dhcp_probe</b> (i.e. root), you should
              exercise caution to ensure that the alert program is safe for a privileged user to execute.

              Because  the  syntax  supported  by  the  external  program  is  not  extensible,   the   use   of
              <b>alert_program_name2</b> is preferrable.

              You may not specify both <b>alert_program_name</b> and <b>alert_program_name2</b>.

   <b>alert_program_name2</b>
              The  <b>alert_program_name2</b> statement is optional, and may be used to specify the name of an external
              program that should be run every time a response packet is received from an unexpected server.

              Specify

                     alert_program_name2 <u>/absolute/path/name</u>

              Unexpected response packets are reported as a matter of course, and optionally written to a packet
              capture file.  You may use an <b>alert_program_name2</b> to provide additional handling of the event, for
              example, to alert an appropriate party via mail or paging.  The <b>alert_program_name2</b> you specify is
              called with the following required options:

                     -p the name of the calling program (e.g. dhcp_probe),
                     -I the name of the interface on which the unexpected response packet was received
                     -i the IP source address of the packet
                     -m Ethernet source address of the packet

              The following non-required options may also be passed:

                     -y the non-zero yiaddr value from the packet, when it falls inside a "Lease Network of Concern"

              The <b>alert_program_name2</b> program  you  specify  must  ignore  options  or  arguments  it  does  not
              recognize; this is to ensure it remains forward-compatible with future enhancements to <b>dhcp_probe</b>.
              It must be prepared to accept options in any order.

              As  the  <b>alert_program_name2</b>  is  called  with  the same privileges as <b>dhcp_probe</b> (i.e. root), you
              should exercise caution to ensure that the alert program is safe for a privileged user to execute.

              You may not specify both <b>alert_program_name</b> and <b>alert_program_name2</b>.
