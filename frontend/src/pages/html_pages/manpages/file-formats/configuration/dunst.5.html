</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dunstrc - dunst configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The configuration is divided into sections in an ini-like format. Every section starts with the section's
       name in square brackets. After that is a list of key-value pairs that specify the settings. Whitespace is
       purely cosmetic and doesn't change the result.

       The "global" section contains the general settings applying to all of dunst. The rest of the settings can
       be specified via rules and can be located in any section. These rules can change a notification based on
       its properties. There are filtering rules and modifying rules. Filtering rules specify what notifications
       the rule applies to. Modifying rules specify changes to the matching notifications. Some special sections
       have implied filters that cannot be changed. For example, the "global" section has no filters: it applies
       to all notifications.

       See RULES for more details.

       All experimental settings are marked with <u>Experimental</u>.

   <b>Global</b> <b>section</b>
       <b>monitor</b> (default: 0)
           Specifies  on  which  monitor  the notifications should be displayed in, either by name or by number,
           starting from 0. See the <b>follow</b> setting.

       <b>follow</b> (values: [none/mouse/keyboard] default: none)
           Defines where the notifications should be placed in a multi-monitor setup.  All  values  except  <u>none</u>
           override the <b>monitor</b> setting.

           On  Wayland there is no difference between mouse and keyboard focus. When either of them is used, the
           compositor will choose an output. This will generally be the output last interacted with.

           <b>none</b>
               The notifications will be placed on the monitor specified by the <b>monitor</b> setting.

           <b>mouse</b>
               The notifications will be placed on the monitor that the mouse is currently in.

           <b>keyboard</b>
               The notifications will be placed on the monitor that contains the window with keyboard focus.

       <b>enable_posix_regex</b> (default: false)
           When set to true (recommended), you can use POSIX regular expressions for filtering  rules.  It  uses
           the             POSIX            Extended            Regular            Expression            syntax:
           https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Regular_Expressions/POSIX-Extended_Regular_Expressions.

           If this is set to false (not recommended), dunst will use  <b><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></b>(3)  for  matching  strings.  Dunst
           doesn't pass any flags to fnmatch, so you cannot make use of extended patterns.

           The  POSIX  syntax  is  more  powerful  and  will eventually become the default. The main differences
           between POSIX and <b><a href="../man3/fnmatch.3.html">fnmatch</a></b>(3) is that POSIX uses ".*" for wildcards instead of "*"  and  POSIX  allows
           for  partial  matches  without  needing  wildcards.  This means that the pattern "abc" will match all
           strings that contain "abc", like "abcdef".

       <b>geometry</b> DEPRECATED
           This setting is deprecated and removed. It's split up into <b>width</b>, <b>height</b>, <b>origin</b>,  <b>notification_limit</b>
           and  <b>offset</b>.   For  quickly  transitioning  to the new syntax, you can take the numbers from your old
           geometry config as follows:
                   geometry = &lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;+&lt;offset&gt;

           In the new config you can then set the following variables (make sure to remove any negative signs)

               width = &lt;width&gt;
               height = &lt;height&gt;
               offset = &lt;offset&gt;
               origin = top-right # or top-left, or any other direction you prefer

       <b>width</b>
           The width of the notification window in pixels. This can be a single number  to  specify  a  constant
           width or two numbers for the minimum and maximum width. The notification will expand from the minimum
           width as neccesary.

           Examples:

               width = 300      # constant width of 300
               width = (0, 300) # width between 0 and 300

           When  setting  a  width bigger than the screen, dunst will clamp the width to the screen width. So if
           you want the notifcation to stretch the entire screen dynamically, you may set the width  to  a  high
           enough number, which none of your screens exceed (e.g. 10000).

       <b>height</b>
           The  height  of each notification in pixels. This can be a single number to specify a constant height
           or two numbers for the minimum and maximum width. The  notification  will  expand  from  the  minimum
           height as neccesary.

           Examples:

               height = 300      # constant height of 300
               height = (0, 300) # height between 0 and 300

           Note that unlike width, different notifications can have diffrent height values.

           Dunst  v1.11  and  older  do  not  support  a  dynamic height and <b>height</b> accepts a single value whose
           behaviour is equivalent to (0, value).

       <b>notification_limit</b> (default: 20)
           The number of notifications that can appear at one time. When this limit is  reached  any  additional
           notifications  will  be queued and displayed when the currently displayed ones either time out or are
           manually dismissed. The value 0 means no limit. If <b>indicate_hidden</b> is true, then the specified  limit
           is  reduced  by  1 and the last notification is a message informing how many hidden notifications are
           waiting to be displayed. See the <b>indicate_hidden</b> entry for more information.

       <b>origin</b> (default: top-right)
           The origin of the notification window on the screen. It can then be moved with offset.  Origin can be
           one of:

               top-left
               top-center
               top-right
               bottom-left
               bottom-center
               bottom-right
               left-center
               center
               right-center

       <b>offset</b> format: (horizontal, vertical)
           Respectively the horizontal and vertical offset in pixels from the corner of the screen specified  by
           <b>origin</b>. A negative offset will lead to the notification being off screen.

           Examples:

               origin = top-right
               offset = (10, 300) # a margin of 10 pixels from the right and 300 pixels from the top

           Dunst  v1.11 and older use the syntax NxN instead (X offset x Y offset).  For backwards compatibility
           this syntax is also accepted.

               offset = 10x300

       <b>scale</b> (default: 0, X11 only)
           Specifies a scale factor for dimensions to adapt notifications to  HiDPI  screens.  This  scales  the
           notification geometry and it's contents. It is not recommended to use a fractional scaling factor, as
           this  may  result  in things being one pixel off. Try to use a whole number scaling factor and adjust
           the font size and other sizes as needed. If 0 is specified, the scale factor is auto-detected.

       <b>progress_bar</b> (values: [true/false], default: true)
           When an integer value is passed to dunst as a hint (see NOTIFY-SEND), a progress bar will be drawn at
           the bottom of the notification. This behavior can be turned off by setting this setting to false.

       <b>progress_bar_horizontal_alignment</b> (values: [left/center/right], default: center)
           Horizontal alignment of  the  progress  bar.  The  progress  bar  will  always  keep  a  distance  of
           <b>horizontal_padding</b> from the edge of the notification.

       <b>progress_bar_height</b> (default: 10)
           The height of the progress bar in pixel. This includes the frame. Make sure this value is bigger than
           twice the frame width.

       <b>progress_bar_min_width</b> (default: 150)
           The minimum width of the progress bar in pixels. The notification is rescaled to fit the bar.

       <b>progress_bar_max_width</b> (default: 300)
           The maximum width of the progress bar in pixels. The notification is resized to fit the progress bar.

       <b>progress_bar_frame_width</b> (default: 1)
           The frame width of the progress bar in pixels. This value should be smaller than half of the progress
           bar height.

       <b>progress_bar_corner_radius</b> (default: 0)
           The  corner radius of the progress bar in pixels. Gives the progress bar rounded corners. Set to 0 to
           disable.

           This setting will be ignored if <b>progress_bar_corners</b> is set to none.

       <b>progress_bar_corners</b> (default: all)
           Define which corners to round when drawing the progress bar. If progress_bar_corner_radius is set  to
           0 this option will be ignored.

           See the <b>corners</b> setting for the value format.

       <b>icon_corner_radius</b> (default: 0)
           The corner radius of the icon image in pixels. Gives the icon rounded corners. Set to 0 to disable.

           This setting will be ignored if <b>icon_corners</b> is set to none.

       <b>icon_corners</b> (default: all)
           Define  which  corners  to  round when drawing the icon image. If icon_corner_radius is set to 0 this
           option will be ignored.

           See the <b>corners</b> setting for the value format.

       <b>indicate_hidden</b> (values: [true/false], default: true)
           If this is set to true, a notification indicating how many notifications are not being displayed  due
           to  the  notification  limit (see <b>notification_limit</b>) will be shown <b>in</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>notification</b>
           <b>slot</b>.

           Meaning that if this is enabled the number of visible notifications will  be  1  less  than  what  is
           specified by <b>notification_limit</b>, the last slot will be taken by the hidden count.

       <b>transparency</b> (default: 0) (X11 only)
           A 0-100 range on how transparent the notification window should be, with 0 being fully opaque and 100
           invisible.

           This  will  affect the whole window. To make only parts of a window transparent set the alpha channel
           in a color, see COLORS.

           To make windows transparent on wayland, set the transparent part of a color, see COLORS.

           This setting will only work if a compositor is running.

       <b>separator_height</b> (default: 2)
           The height in pixels of the separator between notifications, if set to 0 there will be no  separating
           line between notifications. This setting will be ignored if <b>gap_size</b> is greater than 0.

       <b>padding</b> (default: 8)
           The distance in pixels from the content to the separator/border of the window in the vertical axis.

       <b>horizontal_padding</b> (default: 8)
           The distance in pixels from the content to the border of the window in the horizontal axis.

       <b>text_icon_padding</b> (default: 0)
           The distance in pixels from the text to the icon (or vice versa) in the horizontal axis.

           Setting  this  to  a non-zero value overwrites any padding that horizontal_padding was adding between
           the notification text and icon.

           So for example setting

               text_icon_padding=10
               horizontal_padding=10

           is equivalent to

               text_icon_padding=0
               horizontal_padding=10

       <b>frame_width</b> (default: 3)
           Defines width in pixels of frame around the notification window. Set to 0 to disable.

       <b>gap_size</b> (default: 0)
           Size of gap to display between notifications.

           If value is greater than 0, <b>separator_height</b> will be ignored and a border of size <b>frame_width</b> will be
           drawn around each notification instead.

           This setting requires a compositor and any applications displayed between the gaps are not  currently
           clickable.

       <b>separator_color</b> (values: [auto/foreground/frame/#RRGGBB] default: frame)
           Sets the color of the separator line between two notifications.

           <b>auto</b>
               Dunst tries to find a color that fits the rest of the notification color scheme automatically.

           <b>foreground</b>
               The  color  will  be  set  to the same as the foreground color of the topmost notification that's
               being separated.

           <b>frame</b>
               The color will be set to the frame color of the notification with the highest urgency between the
               2 notifications that are being separated.

           <b>anything</b> <b>else</b>
               Any other value is interpreted as a color, see COLORS.

       <b>sort</b> (values: [true/false/id/urgency_ascending/urgency_descending/update], default: true)
           If set to true or urgency_descending, display notifications with higher  urgency  above  the  others.
           critical first, then normal, then low.

           If set to false or id, sort notifications by id.

           If  set  to  urgency_ascending,  notifications  are  sorted  by urgency, low first, then normal, then
           critical.

           If set to update, notifications are sorted by their update_time.  So the most recent is always at the
           top. This means that if you set sort to update, and stack_duplicates  to  true,  the  duplicate  will
           always be at the top.

           When the notification window is at the bottom of the screen, this order is automatically reversed.

       <b>idle_threshold</b> (default: 0)
           Don't timeout notifications if user is idle longer than this time.  See TIME FORMAT for valid times.

           Set to 0 to disable.

           A  client  can mark a notification as transient to bypass this setting and timeout anyway. Use a rule
           with 'set_transient = no' to disable this behavior.

           Note: this doesn't work on xwayland.

       <b>layer</b> (values: [bottom/top/overlay], default: overlay) (Wayland only)
           Place dunst notifications on the selected  layer.  Using  overlay  will  cause  notifications  to  be
           displayed above fullscreen windows, though this may also occur at top depending on your compositor.

           The bottom layer is below all windows and above the background.

       <b>force_xwayland</b> (values: [true/false], default: false) (Wayland only)
           Force  the use of X11 output, even on a wayland compositor. This setting has no effect when not using
           a Wayland compositor.

           This setting will be ignored if dunst was compiled without X11 support.

       <b>font</b> (default: "Monospace 8")
           Defines the font or font set used. Optionally set the size as a decimal number after  the  font  name
           and space.  Multiple font options can be separated with commas.

           This  options  is  parsed  as  a Pango font description. More information on the string format can be
           found here https://docs.gtk.org/Pango/type_func.FontDescription.from_string.html.

       <b>line_height</b> (default: 0)
           The amount of extra spacing between text lines in pixels. Set to 0 to disable.

       <b>format</b> (default: "&lt;b&gt;%s&lt;/b&gt;\n%b")
           Specifies how the various attributes of the notification should  be  formatted  on  the  notification
           window.

           Regardless  of  the status of the <b>markup</b> setting, any markup tags that are present in the format will
           be parsed. Note that because of that, if a literal ampersand (&amp;) is needed it needs to be escaped  as
           '&amp;amp;'

           If '\n' is present anywhere in the format, it will be replaced with a literal newline.

           If  any  of the following strings are present, they will be replaced with the equivalent notification
           attribute.

           For a complete markup reference, see &lt;https://docs.gtk.org/Pango/pango_markup.html&gt;.

           <b>%a</b>  appname
           <b>%s</b>  summary
           <b>%b</b>  body
           <b>%i</b>  iconname (including its path)
           <b>%I</b>  iconname (without its path)
           <b>%p</b>  progress value ([  0%] to [100%])
           <b>%n</b>  progress value without any extra characters
           <b>%%</b>  Literal %

           If any of these exists in the format but hasn't been specified in the notification (e.g. no icon  has
           been set), the placeholders will simply be removed from the format.

       <b>vertical_alignment</b> (values: [top/center/bottom], default: center)
           Defines how the text and icon should be aligned vertically within the notification.

       <b>show_age_threshold</b> (default: 60)
           Show age of message if message is older than this time.  See TIME FORMAT for valid times.

           Set to -1 to disable.

       <b>ignore_newline</b> (values: [true/false], default: false)
           If set to true, replace newline characters in notifications with whitespace.

       <b>stack_duplicates</b> (values: [true/false], default: true)
           If  set  to  true,  duplicate  notifications  will  be  stacked  together  instead of being displayed
           separately.

           Two notifications are considered duplicate if the name of the program that sent  it,  summary,  body,
           icon and urgency are all identical.

       <b>hide_duplicate_count</b> (values: [true/false], default: false)
           Hide the count of stacked duplicate notifications.

       <b>show_indicators</b> (values: [true/false], default: true)
           Show  an  indicator  if  a notification contains actions and/or open-able URLs. See ACTIONS below for
           further details.

       <b>icon_path</b> (default: "/usr/share/icons/gnome/16x16/status/:/usr/share/icons/gnome/16x16/devices/")
           Can be set to a colon-separated list of paths to search for icons to use with notifications.

           Dunst doens't  search  outside  of  these  direcories.  For  a  recursive  icon  lookup  system,  see
           <b>enable_recursive_icon_lookup</b>. This new system will eventually replace icon_path search.

       <b>icon_theme</b> (default: "Adwaita", example: "Adwaita, breeze")
           Comma-separated  list  of names of the themes to use for looking up icons. This has to be the name of
           the directory in which the theme is located, not  the  human-friendly  name  of  the  theme.  So  for
           example,  the  theme <b>Breeze</b> <b>Dark</b> is located in <u>/usr/share/icons/breeze-dark</u>. In this case you have to
           set the theme to <b>breeze-dark</b>.

           The first theme in the list is the most important. Only if the icon cannot be found  in  that  theme,
           the next theme will be tried.

           Dunst  will  look  for the themes in <b>XDG_DATA_HOME/icons</b> and <b>$XDG_DATA_DIRS/icons</b> as specified in the
           icon                                       theme                                       specification:
           https://specifications.freedesktop.org/icon-theme-spec/icon-theme-spec-latest.html.

           If the theme inherits from other themes, they will be used as a backup.

           This  setting is experimental and not enabled by default. See <b>enable_recursive_icon_lookup</b> for how to
           enable it.

       <b>enable_recursive_icon_lookup</b> (default: false)
           This setting enables the new icon lookup method. This new system will  eventually  be  the  old  icon
           lookup.

           Currently  icons are looked up in the <b>icon_path</b>. Since the <b>icon_path</b> wasn't recursive, one had to add
           a ton of paths to this list.  This has been drastically simplified by the new lookup method. Now  you
           only  have  to  set  <b>icon_theme</b>  to the name of the theme you want. To enable this new behaviour, set
           <b>enable_recursive_icon_lookup</b> to true in the <u>[global]</u> section. See the respective  settings  for  more
           details.

       <b>sticky_history</b> (values: [true/false], default: true)
           If set to true, notifications that have been recalled from history will not time out automatically.

       <b>history_length</b> (default: 20)
           Maximum  number  of  notifications  that  will be kept in history. After that limit is reached, older
           notifications will be deleted once a new one arrives. See HISTORY.

       <b>dmenu</b> (default: "/usr/bin/dmenu -p dunst")
           The command that will be run when opening the context menu. Should be either a  dmenu  command  or  a
           dmenu-compatible menu.

       <b>browser</b> (default: "/usr/bin/xdg-open")
           The  command that will be run when opening a URL. The URL to be opened will be appended to the end of
           the value of this setting.

       <b>always_run_script</b> (values: [true/false] default: true]
           Always run rule-defined scripts, even if the notification is  suppressed  with  "format  =  """.  See
           SCRIPTING.

       <b>title</b> (default: "Dunst") (X11 only)
           Defines the title (<b>_</b><u>NET_WM_NAME</u> property) of notification windows spawned by dunst.

           There should be no need to modify this setting for regular use.

       <b>class</b> (default: "Dunst") (X11 only)
           Defines the class (<u>WM_CLASS</u> first part) of notification windows spawned by dunst.

           There should be no need to modify this setting for regular use.

       <b>force_xinerama</b> (values: [true/false], default: false) (X11 only)
           Use  the  Xinerama extension instead of RandR for multi-monitor support. This setting is <u>provided</u> <u>for</u>
           <u>compatibility</u> with older nVidia drivers that do not support  RandR  and  using  it  on  systems  that
           support RandR is <u>highly</u> <u>discouraged</u>.

           By enabling this setting dunst will not be able to detect when a monitor is connected or disconnected
           which might break follow mode if the screen layout changes.

       <b>corner_radius</b> (default: 0)
           Define  the  corner  radius  in  pixels.  A  corner  radius  of  0  will result in rectangular shaped
           notifications.

           By enabling this setting the outer border and the  frame  will  be  shaped.   If  you  have  multiple
           notifications,  the whole window is shaped, not every single notification, unless if gaps are enabled
           (see <b>gaps_size</b>).

           To avoid the corners clipping the icon or text the corner radius will  be  automatically  lowered  to
           half of the notification height if it exceeds it.

           This setting will be ignored if <b>corners</b> is set to none.

       <b>corners</b> (values: [none/all/bottom-right/bottom-left/top-right/top-left/top/bottom/left/right], default:
       all)
           Comma-separated list of the corners to round when drawing the window.

           If the corner radius is set to 0 this option will be ignored.

       <b>mouse_[left/middle/right]_click</b> (values: [none/do_action/close_current/close_all/context/context_all])
           Defines action of mouse click. A touch input in Wayland acts as a mouse left click. A list of values,
           separated by commas, can be specified for multiple actions to be executed in sequence.

           <b>Defaults:</b>

           •       "mouse_left_click=close_current"

           •       "mouse_middle_click=do_action, close_current"

           •       "mouse_right_click=close_all"

           <b>none</b>
               Don't do anything.

           <b>do_action</b>
               Invoke  the  action  determined  by  the  action_name  rule. If there is no such action, open the
               context menu.

           <b>open_url</b>
               If the notification has exactly one url, open it. If there are multiple ones,  open  the  context
               menu.

           <b>close_current</b>
               Close current notification.

           <b>close_all</b>
               Close all notifications.

           <b>context</b>
               Open context menu for the notification.

           <b>context_all</b>
               Open context menu for all notifications.

       <b>ignore_dbusclose</b> (default: false)
           Ignore  the  dbus  <u>CloseNotification</u>  message.  This  is  useful  to enforce the timeout set by dunst
           configuration. Without this parameter, an application may close the notification sent before the user
           defined timeout.

       <b>override_pause_level</b> (values: [0-100], default: 0)
           A notification will appear whenever notification's <u>override_pause_level</u> is greater  than  the  paused
           level.   Setting  this  to  values  other than 0 allows you to create partial pause modes, where more
           urgent notifications get through, but less urgent stay paused.

           For example, when you can set a low battery noficiation's override_pause_level to  60  and  then  set
           dunst's  pause  level to 60. This will cause dunst to only show battery level notification (and other
           notifications with override_pause_level &gt;= 60), while suspending others.

   <b>Keyboard</b> <b>shortcuts</b> <b>(X11</b> <b>only)</b>
       Keyboard shortcuts are defined in the following format: "Modifier+key"  where  the  modifier  is  one  of
       ctrl,mod1,mod2,mod3,mod4 and key is any keyboard key.

       Note that the keyboard shortcuts have been moved to the <b>global</b> section of the config for consistency with
       other settings.

       Alternatively  you  can  also  define  shortcuts  inside your window manager and bind them to <b><a href="../man1/dunstctl.1.html">dunstctl</a></b>(1)
       commands.

       Wayland does not allow applications to  listen  to  global  keyboard  events,  so  this  feature  can  be
       implemented only for X.

       <b>close</b>
           Specifies the keyboard shortcut for closing a notification.

       <b>close_all</b>
           Specifies the keyboard shortcut for closing all currently displayed notifications.

       <b>history</b>
           Specifies the keyboard shortcut for recalling a single notification from history.

       <b>context</b>
           Specifies the keyboard shortcut that opens the context menu.

   <b>Urgency</b> <b>sections</b>
       The  urgency  sections  work  in  a  similar  way  to rules and can be used to specify attributes for the
       different urgency levels of  notifications  (low,  normal,  critical).  Currently  only  the  background,
       foreground, hightlight, timeout, frame_color and icon attributes can be modified.

       The  urgency  sections  are  urgency_low,  urgency_normal,  urgency_critical for low, normal and critical
       urgency respectively.

       See the example configuration file for examples.

       Old version of dunst allowed changing the colors of different urgencies  through  command  line  options.
       This has been long removed in favour of RULES, see issue #328.

</pre><h4><b>DUNSTCTL</b></h4><pre>
       Dunst  now  contains a command line control command that can be used to interact with it. It supports all
       functions previously done only via keyboard shortcuts but also has a lot of extra functionality. For more
       information, see <b><a href="../man1/dunstctl.1.html">dunstctl</a></b>(1).

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       Dunst saves a number of notifications (specified by <b>history_length</b>) in memory.  These  notifications  can
       be recalled (i.e. redisplayed) by calling <b>dunstctl</b> <b>history</b> (see <b><a href="../man1/dunstctl.1.html">dunstctl</a></b>(1)). Whether these notifications
       will  time  out  like  if  they  have  been just send depends on the value of the <b>sticky_history</b> setting.
       Actions are invalidated once the notification is closed, so you cannot execute that action when you bring
       back a notification from history.

       Past notifications are redisplayed in a first-in-last-out order, meaning that pressing  the  history  key
       once will bring up the most recent notification that had been closed/timed out.

</pre><h4><b>WAYLAND</b></h4><pre>
       Dunst  has Wayland support since version 1.6.0. Because the Wayland protocol is more focused on security,
       some things that are possible in X11 are not possible in Wayland. Those differences are reflected in  the
       configuration.   The  main  things  that  change are that dunst on Wayland cannot use global hotkeys, use
       dunstctl instead.

       Some dunst features on Wayland might need your compositor to support a certain protocol. Dunst will  warn
       you if an optional feature isn't supported and will disable the corresponding functionality.

       Fullscreen  detection works on wayland with some limitations (see <b>fullscreen</b>).  If you want notifications
       to appear over fullscreen windows, set <b>layer</b> <b>=</b> <b>overlay</b> in the global options.

       Note that the same limitations exist when using XWayland.

       If something doesn't quite work in Wayland, please file a bug report. In the mean time, you  can  try  if
       the X11 output does work on wayland. Use <b>force_xwayland</b> <b>=</b> <b>true</b> for that.

       If  you  have  your  dunst  notifications  on the same side of your display as your status bar, you might
       notice that your notifications appear a bit higher or lower than on X11. This is because the notification
       cannot be placed on top of your status bar. The notifications are placed relative  to  your  status  bar,
       making  them  appear  higher  or lower by the height of your status bar. We cannot do anything about that
       behavior.

       Note that dunst creates a "desktop layer" using the layer  shell  protocol  and  not  a  regular  Wayland
       window. This has some limitations like stated above.  For example you can't set a window title/class.

</pre><h4><b>RULES</b></h4><pre>
       Rules  allow  the  conditional  modification  of notifications. They can be located in a section with any
       name, even the special sections. The special sections do not allow filters to be added, since  they  have
       implied filters by default.

       'global'
           No filters, matches all notifications.

       'urgency_low', 'urgency_normal' and 'urgency_critical'
           Matches low, normal or critical urgency respectively.

       There  are 2 parts in configuring a rule: Defining the filters that controls when a rule should apply and
       then the actions that should be taken when the rule is matched. It's also possible  to  not  specify  any
       filters, in which case the rule will match all notifications.

       Rules  are  applied in order of appearance. Beware: if a notification is changed by a rule, it may affect
       if it's being matched by a later rule.

       <b>filtering</b>
           With filtering rules you can match notifications to apply rules to only a subset of notifications.

           For filtering rules that filter based on strings you can use regular expressions. It's recommended to
           set <b>enable_posix_regex</b> to true. You can then  use  the  POSIX  Extended  Regular  Expression  syntax:
           https://en.m.wikibooks.org/wiki/Regular_Expressions/POSIX-Extended_Regular_Expressions.

           A  matching  rule is made by assigning a filter attribute to the value you want to match.  Shell-like
           globbing is supported when matching values.

           If multiple filter expressions are present, all of them have to match for  the  rule  to  be  applied
           (logical AND).

           An example of rule that only operates on messages sent by notify-send is:

               appname="notify-send"

           The allowed attributes are listed below.

           "appname" (discouraged, see desktop_entry)
               The  name  of  the application as reported by the client. Be aware that the name can often differ
               depending on the locale used.

               It's recommended to use the "desktop_entry" filter instead.

           "body"
               The body of the notification

           "category"
               The   category   of   the   notification   as   defined   by   the   notification    spec.    See
               https://specifications.freedesktop.org/notification-spec/latest/categories.html.

           "desktop_entry"
               GLib  based  applications  export  their  desktop-entry  name.  In comparison to the appname, the
               desktop-entry won't get localized.

           "icon"
               The icon of the notification in the form of a file path. Can be empty if no icon is available  or
               a  raw  icon  is  used  instead.  This setting is not to be confused with the icon setting in the
               urgency section.

           "match_transient"
               Match if the notification has been declared as transient by the client or by some other rule.

               See "set_transient" for more details about this attribute.

           "match_dbus_timeout"
               Matches the dbus timeout of the notification as set by the client or by some other rule.

               See "override_dbus_timeout" for more details about this attribute.

           "msg_urgency"
               Matches the urgency of the notification as set by the client or by some other rule.

               It is named so to not conflict with trying to modify the urgency.

           "stack_tag"
               Matches the stack tag of the notification as set by the client or by some other rule.

               See set_stack_tag for more information about stack tags.

           "summary"
               Matches the summary, 'title', of the notification.

       <b>modifying</b>
           A modifying rule, similarly to a filtering one, is made  by  assigning  a  value  to  a  notification
           attribute in the rule definition.

           The following attributes can be overridden:

           "background"
               The background color of the notification. See COLORS for possible values.

           "foreground"
               The foreground color of the notification. See COLORS for possible values.

           "highlight"
               The  highlight  color  of the notification. This color is used for coloring the progress bar. See
               COLORS for possible values.

               You can also set additional color values (as a comma-separated list) to define a linear  gradient
               spanning all the length of the progress bar.

           "format"
               Equivalent to the "format" setting.

           "frame_color"
               The frame color color of the notification. See COLORS for possible values.

           "fullscreen" (values: [delay/show/pushback], default: show)
               This  attribute  specifies  how  notifications  are handled if a fullscreen window is focused. By
               default it's set to show so notifications are being shown.

               Other possible values are delay: Already shown notifications are continued to be displayed  until
               they  are  dismissed  or  time out but new notifications will be held back and displayed when the
               focus to the fullscreen window is lost.

               Or pushback which is equivalent to delay with the difference that already existing  notifications
               are paused and hidden until the focus to the fullscreen window is lost.

               On  Wayland,  if <b>follow</b> is set to mouse or keyboard, the output where the notification is located
               cannot be determined. So dunst will delay or pushback if any of the outputs is fullscreen.  Since
               the  fullscreen  protocol  is  fairly  new,  you  will need a recent version of a compositor that
               supports it. At the time of writing, you will need the git version of sway.  See  also  <b>layer</b>  to
               change if notifications appear above fullscreen windows in Wayland.

           "min_icon_size" (default: 32)
               Defines  the  minimum  size  in pixels for the icons.  If the icon is larger than or equal to the
               specified value it won't be affected.  If it's smaller then it will be  scaled  up  so  that  the
               smaller axis is equivalent to the specified size.

               When  using recursive icon lookup (see <b>enable_recursive_icon_lookup</b>), all icons from a theme will
               be this size.

               If <b>icon_position</b> is set to off, this setting is ignored.

           "max_icon_size" (default: 128)
               Defines the maximum size in pixels for the icons.  If the icon is smaller than or  equal  to  the
               specified  value  it  won't  be affected.  If it's larger then it will be scaled down so that the
               larger axis is equivalent to the specified size.

               Set to 0 to disable icon downscaling.

               If both <b>min_icon_size</b> and <b>max_icon_size</b> are enabled, the latter gets the last say.

               If <b>icon_position</b> is set to off, this setting is ignored.

           "new_icon"
               Updates the icon of the notification, it should be a path or a  name  for  a  valid  image.  This
               overrides  the  icon  that  was sent with dunstify or another notification tool. Expansion of the
               argument is carried out using <b><a href="../man3/wordexp.3.html">wordexp</a></b>(3) with command substitution disabled.

           "icon_position" (values: [left/right/top/off], default: left)
               Defines the position of the icon in the notification window. Setting it to off disables icons.

           "default_icon"
               Sets the default icon of the notification, it should be a path or a name for a valid image.  This
               does <b>not</b> override the icon that was sent with dunstify or another notification tool. Expansion of
               the argument is carried out using <b><a href="../man3/wordexp.3.html">wordexp</a></b>(3) with command substitution disabled.

           "set_stack_tag"
               Sets  the  stack  tag for the notification, notifications with the same (non-empty) stack tag and
               the same appid will replace each-other so only the newest one is visible. This can be useful  for
               example in volume or brightness notifications where you only want one of the same type visible.

               The   stack  tag  can  be  set  by  the  client  with  the  'synchronous',  'private-synchronous'
               'x-canonical-private-synchronous' or the 'x-dunst-stack-tag' hints.

           "set_transient"
               Sets whether the notification is considered transient.  Transient notifications will  bypass  the
               idle_threshold setting.

               By  default notifications are _not_ considered transient but clients can set the value of this by
               specifying the 'transient' hint when sending notifications.

           "set_category"
               Sets  the  category  of  the   notification.    For   a   list   of   standard   categories   see
               https://specifications.freedesktop.org/notification-spec/latest/categories.html.

           "timeout"
               Equivalent to the "timeout" setting in the urgency sections.

           "override_dbus_timeout"
               Overrides the timeout specified in dbus.  This takes precedence over "timeout".

           "urgency"
               This sets the notification urgency.

               <b>IMPORTANT</b>  <b>NOTE</b>: This currently DOES NOT re-apply the attributes from the urgency_* sections. The
               changed urgency will only be visible in rules defined later. Use "msg_urgency" to match it.

           "skip_display"
               Setting this to true will prevent the notification from being displayed  initially  but  will  be
               saved in history for later viewing.

           "history_ignore"
               Setting this to true will display the notification initially, but stop it from being recalled via
               the history.

           "action_name" (default: "default")
               Sets  the  name  of  the  action  to be invoked on do_action. If not specified, the action set as
               default action or the only available action will be invoked.

           "word_wrap" (values: [true/false], default: true)
               Specifies whether to wrap the text if the lines get longer than the maximum  notification  width.
               If  it's  set  to  true, long lines will be broken into multiple lines expanding the notification
               window height as necessary for them to fit. If the text doesn't fit in the  window,  it  will  be
               ellipsize according to ellipsize.

           "ellipsize" (values: [start/middle/end], default: middle)
               Specifies where truncated lines should be ellipsized.

           "alignment" (values: [left/center/right], default: left)
               Defines how the text should be aligned within the notification.

           "hide_text" (values: [true/false], default: false)
               Setting this to true will skip displaying any text related to the notification.  The notification
               icon  and progress bar will still be displayed. This option may be useful for notifications where
               an icon or progress bar may be sufficient information for the notification, such as audio  volume
               or brightness level.

           "markup" (values: [full/strip/no], default: no)
               Defines how markup in notifications is handled.

               It's important to note that markup in the format option will be parsed regardless of what this is
               set to.

               Possible values:

               <b>full</b>
                   Allow a small subset of html markup in notifications

                       &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;

               <b>strip</b>
                   This  setting  is  provided  for compatibility with some broken clients that send markup even
                   though it's not enabled on the server.

                   Dunst will try to strip the markup but the parsing is simplistic so using this option outside
                   of matching rules for specific applications <b>IS</b> <b>GREATLY</b> <b>DISCOURAGED</b>.

                   See RULES for matching specific broken clients.

               <b>no</b>  Disable markup parsing, incoming notifications will be treated as plain text. Dunst will  not
                   advertise that it can parse markup if this is set as a global setting.

   <b>SCRIPTING</b>
       Within  rules you can specify a script to be run every time the rule is matched by assigning the 'script'
       option to the name of the script to be run.

       When the script is called details of the notification that triggered it will be  passed  via  environment
       variables.   The   following   variables   are   available:  <b>DUNST_APP_NAME</b>,  <b>DUNST_SUMMARY</b>,  <b>DUNST_BODY</b>,
       <b>DUNST_ICON_PATH</b>, <b>DUNST_URGENCY</b>, <b>DUNST_ID</b>, <b>DUNST_PROGRESS</b>,  <b>DUNST_CATEGORY</b>,  <b>DUNST_STACK_TAG</b>,  <b>DUNST_URLS</b>,
       <b>DUNST_TIMEOUT</b>, <b>DUNST_TIMESTAMP</b>, <b>DUNST_DESKTOP_ENTRY</b>, and <b>DUNST_STACK_TAG</b>.

       Another,  less  recommended way to get notifcations details from a script is via command line parameters.
       These are passed to the script in the following order: <b>appname</b>, <b>summary</b>, <b>body</b>, <b>icon_path</b>, <b>urgency</b>.

       Where <b>DUNST_ICON_PATH</b> or <b>icon_path</b> is the absolute path to the icon file if there is  one.  <b>DUNST_URGENCY</b>
       or  <b>urgency</b>  is  one  of  "LOW",  "NORMAL"  or "CRITICAL". <b>DUNST_URLS</b> is a newline-separated list of urls
       associated with the notification.

       Note that some variables may be empty.

       If the notification is suppressed, the script will not be run unless <b>always_run_script</b> is set to true.

       The script parameter is expanded according to <b><a href="../man3/wordexp.3.html">wordexp</a></b>(3)  with  command  substitution  disabled.  If  the
       expanded  value  is  not  an  absolute path, the directories in the PATH variable will be searched for an
       executable of the same name.

</pre><h4><b>COLORS</b></h4><pre>
       Colors are values with the format #RGB or #RRGGBB.

       You may also specify a transparency component by using the format #RGBA or #RRGGBBAA.

       <b>NOTE</b>: '#' is interpreted as a comment, to use it the entire value needs to be quoted.  For example:

               separator_color="#123456"

</pre><h4><b>NOTIFY-SEND</b> <b>HINTS</b></h4><pre>
       Dunst is able to get different colors for a message via notify-send.  In order to do that you have to add
       a hint via the -h option.  The progress value can be set with a hint, too.

       Note: Dunstify is compatible with notify-send and all of these settings work the same way.

       All the accepted hints are listed below.

       See RULES for more detailed explanations for some options.

       <b>fgcolor</b>
           Foreground color.

       <b>bgcolor</b>
           Background color.

       <b>frcolor</b>
           Frame color.

       <b>hlcolor</b>
           Highlight color.

       <b>value</b>
           Progress value.

       <b>image-path</b>
           Icon name. This may be a path or just the icon name.

       <b>image-data</b>
           A stream of raw image data.

       <b>category</b>
           The category.

       <b>desktop-entry</b>
           The desktop entry.

       <b>transient</b>
           The transient value.

       Some examples:

               notify-send -h string:fgcolor:#ff4444

               notify-send -h string:bgcolor:#4444ff -h string:fgcolor:#ff4444 -h string:frcolor:#44ff44

               notify-send -h int:value:42 "Working ..."

</pre><h4><b>ACTIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Dunst allows notifiers (i.e.: programs that send the notifications) to specify actions. Dunst has support
       for both displaying indicators for these, and interacting with these actions.

       If "show_indicators" is true and a notification has  an  action,  an  "(A)"  will  be  prepended  to  the
       notification  format.  Likewise,  an  "(U)"  is  prepended  to notifications with URLs. It is possible to
       interact with notifications that have actions regardless of this setting, though it may  not  be  obvious
       which notifications HAVE actions.

       The  "context"  keybinding is used to interact with these actions, by showing a menu of possible actions.
       This feature requires "dmenu" or a dmenu drop-in replacement present.

       Alternatively, you can invoke an action with a middle click on the notification.  If there is exactly one
       associated action, or one is marked as default, that one is invoked. If there are multiple,  the  context
       menu is shown. The same applies to URLs when there are no actions.

</pre><h4><b>TIME</b> <b>FORMAT</b></h4><pre>
       A  time  can  be  any decimal integer value suffixed with a time unit. If no unit given, seconds ("s") is
       taken as default.

       Time units understood by dunst are "ms", "s", "m", "h" and "d".

       Example time: "1000ms", "10m".
