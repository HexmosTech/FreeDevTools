</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       proxsmtpd.conf — the configuration file for <u><a href="../man8/proxsmtpd.8.html">proxsmtpd</a></u>(8)

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u><a href="../man8/proxsmtpd.8.html">proxsmtpd</a></u>(8)  reads  a  configuration file when starting up. The location of the file is dependent on how
       you compiled proxsmtp but it should usually be in either the <u><a href="file:/usr/local/etc/">/usr/local/etc/</a></u>  or  <u><a href="file:/etc/">/etc/</a></u>  directories.  If
       <u><a href="../man8/proxsmtpd.8.html">proxsmtpd</a></u>(8)  does not find its configuration file it'll print a warning when it starts up along with the
       location it's expecting to find it in. You can also specify a different location for  a  config  file  by
       passing the <b>-f</b> argument to <u><a href="../man8/proxsmtpd.8.html">proxsmtpd</a></u>(8)

       The  settings  are specified one per line. The setting names come first, followed by a colon and then the
       value. Comments start with the '#' character on a line  of  their  own.  Whitespace  is  ignored  at  the
       beginning of line, end of line and around the colons.

       A sample configuration file can be found in the <u>doc/</u> directory of the proxsmtp distribution.

</pre><h4><b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The various settings are as follows:

       <u>FilterCommand</u>
                   This  is the command used to filter email through. If not specified then no filtering will be
                   done. Specify all the arguments the command needs as you would on a command-line.

                   [ Default: no filtering ]

       <u>FilterTimeout</u>
                   The amount of time in seconds to wait for the <u>FilterCommand</u> to process email data.

                   [ Default: 30 seconds ]

       <u>FilterReject</u>
                   The rejection message used when <u>FilterType</u> is set to 'reject'.

                   [ Default: 530 Email Rejected ]

       <u>FilterType</u>  When set to 'pipe' the email data is piped through the <u>FilterCommand</u> using  standard  in  and
                   standard  out.  When  set  to  'file'  the email data is saved to a file and the file name is
                   passed to the <u>FilterCommand</u> using the <u>EMAIL</u> environment variable.

                   When set to 'reject' then  email  is  immediately  rejected  using  message  defined  by  the
                   <u>FilterReject</u> option.

                   [ Default: pipe ]

       <u>Header</u>      A  header to add to scanned messages. Put an empty value to suppress adding a header. You can
                   include the following special formatting characters in the string to include special values:

                   <u>%i</u> Client IP Address

                   <u>%l</u> Local IP Address

                   <u>%d</u> Current Date

                   You can also include the standard \r or \n escapes.

                   [ Optional ]

       <u>KeepAlives</u>  On slow connections the  server  will  sometimes  timeout  before  <u><a href="../man8/proxsmtpd.8.html">proxsmtpd</a></u>(8)  is  finished
                   filtering  the  file.  This  option  sends NOOP's to the server to keep the connection alive.
                   Specify the number of seconds, or 0 to disable.

                   [ Default: 0 ]

       <u>Listen</u>      The address and port to listen for SMTP connections on. See syntax of addresses below.

                   [ Default: port 10025 on all local IP addresses ]

       <u>MaxConnections</u>
                   Specifies the maximum number of connections to accept at once.

                   [ Default: 64 ]

       <u>OutAddress</u>  The address of the SMTP server to send email  to  once  it's  been  scanned.  See  syntax  of
                   addreses below.

                   [ Required ]

       <u>Skip</u>        Whether  to  skip  certain  kinds  of  connections  or email from running through the filter.
                   Specify 'authenticated' to skip SMTP authenticated connections.

                   [ Optional ]

       <u>TempDirectory</u>
                   The directory to write temp files to.

                   [ Default: <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> ]

       <u>TimeOut</u>     The number of seconds to wait while reading data from network connections.

                   [ Default: 180 seconds ]

       <u>TransparentProxy</u>
                   Setting this option to 'client' enables transparent proxy support, which allows you to  route
                   all  SMTP  traffic that's going through a gateway through proxsmtp which will then send it on
                   to its final destination. This setup usually involves firewall rules which  redirect  traffic
                   to proxsmtp, and the setup varies from OS to OS.

                   Specify  'full'  to  enable  a  true transparent proxy where neither the client or server are
                   aware of the proxy by way of the packet headers.  This  setup  usually  involves  routers  to
                   redirect traffic to proxsmtp, and the setup varies from OS to OS.

                   [ Default: off ]

       <u>User</u>        The user to run as. If this option is specified then <u><a href="../man8/proxsmtpd.8.html">proxsmtpd</a></u>(8) must be started as root. It
                   will  then  drop root privileges and run as the specified user. The user can either be a name
                   or a numerical user id.

                   [ Optional ]

       <u>XClient</u>     Send an XCLIENT command to the  receiving  server.  This  is  useful  for  forwarding  client
                   addresses and connection info to servers that support this feature.

                   [ Default: off ]

</pre><h4><b>ADDRESSES</b></h4><pre>
       Addresses can be specified in multiple formats:

       <b>•</b>   Unix local addresses can be specified by specifying their full path.  (ie: '/var/run/socket').

       <b>•</b>   IP  addresses  can  be  specified  using  dotted  notation  with  a colon before the port number (ie:
           '127.0.0.1:3310').

       <b>•</b>   IPv6 addresses are implemented but disabled. The code needs testing.
