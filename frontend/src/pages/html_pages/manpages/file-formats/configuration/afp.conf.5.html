</pre><h4><b>Name</b></h4><pre>
       afp.conf - Netatalk configuration file

</pre><h4><b>Synopsis</b></h4><pre>
       The <b>afp.conf</b> file is the configuration file for the <b>Netatalk</b> AFP file server.

       All AFP-specific configurations and AFP volume definitions are done via this file.

</pre><h4><b>File</b> <b>Format</b></h4><pre>
       The  file  consists  of  sections and parameters. A section begins with the name of the section in square
       brackets and continues until the next section begins. Sections contain parameters of the form:

              option = value

       The file is line-based - that is, each newline-terminated line represents either  a  comment,  a  section
       name or a parameter.

       Parameter names are case sensitive, while section names are not.

       Only  the  first  equals  sign in a parameter is significant. Whitespace before or after the first equals
       sign is discarded.  Leading,  trailing  and  internal  whitespace  in  section  and  parameter  names  is
       irrelevant.   Leading  and  trailing  whitespace  in a parameter value is discarded.  Internal whitespace
       within a parameter value is retained verbatim.

       Any line beginning with a semicolon (“;”) or a hash (“#”) character is ignored, as are  lines  containing
       only whitespace.

       Any line ending in a <b>\</b> (backslash) is continued on the next line in the customary UNIX fashion.

       The  values  following  the  equals  sign  in  parameters are all either a string (no quotes needed) or a
       boolean, which may be given as yes/no, 1/0 or true/false. Case is not significant in boolean values,  but
       is preserved in string values. Some options such as <b>file</b> <b>perm</b> take numeric values.

       The  parameter  <b>include</b> <b>=</b> <b>path</b> allows you to include one config file inside another. The file is included
       literally, as though typed in place. Nested includes are not supported.

</pre><h4><b>Section</b> <b>Descriptions</b></h4><pre>
       Each section in the configuration file (except for the [Global]  section)  describes  a  shared  resource
       (known as a “volume”).  The parameters within the section define the volume attributes and options.

       There  are  two  special  sections, [Global] and [Homes], which are described under <u>special</u> <u>sections</u>. The
       following notes apply to ordinary section descriptions.

       A volume consists of a directory to which access is being given plus a description of the  access  rights
       which  are  granted to the user of the service. For volumes the <b>path</b> option must specify the directory to
       share.

       The name of the volume is defined via the <b>volume</b> <b>name</b> option.  When absent, the volume name is  the  name
       of the section, expressed in lowercase.

       Any  volume  section without <b>path</b> option is considered a <u>vol</u> <u>preset</u> which can be selected in other volume
       sections via the <b>vol</b> <b>preset</b> option and constitutes defaults for the volume. For any option specified both
       in a preset <u>and</u> in a volume section the volume section setting completely substitutes the preset option.

       The access rights granted by the server are masked by the access rights granted to the specified or guest
       UNIX user by the host system. The server does not grant more access than the host system grants.

       The following sample section defines an AFP volume. The user has full access to the  path  <u>/foo/bar</u>.  The
       share is accessed via the share name <u>Baz</u>:

              [baz]
                  volume name = Baz
                  path = /foo/bar

</pre><h4><b>Special</b> <b>Sections</b></h4><pre>
   <b>The</b> <b>[Global]</b> <b>section</b>
       Parameters  in this section apply to the server as a whole. Parameters denoted by a (G) below are must be
       set in this section.

   <b>The</b> <b>[Homes]</b> <b>section</b>
       This section enable sharing of the UNIX server user  home  directories.   The  one  mandatory  option  is
       <b>basedir</b> <b>regex</b>. It should be set to a path which matches the parent directory of the user homes.

       Specifying the optional <b>path</b> parameter makes it so that only the subdirectory <b>path</b> is shared, rather than
       the  entire  home directory.  The following example illustrates this. Given all user home directories are
       stored under <u><a href="file:/home">/home</a></u>:

              [Homes]
                  path = afp-data
                  basedir regex = <a href="file:/home">/home</a>

       For a user <u>john</u> this results in an AFP home volume with a path of <u>/home/john/afp-data</u>.

       If <b>basedir</b> <b>regex</b> contains symlink, set the canonicalized absolute path. When <u><a href="file:/home">/home</a></u> links to <u>/usr/home</u>:

              [Homes]
                  basedir regex = /usr/home

       The optional parameter <b>home</b> <b>name</b> can be used to change the Homes volume  name,  which  is  <u>$u’s</u>  <u>home</u>  by
       default. See below for more information on VARIABLE SUBSTITUTIONS.

              [Homes]
                  home name = The home of $u
                  basedir regex = <a href="file:/home">/home</a>

       For the same user <u>john</u> this results in an AFP home volume called <u>The</u> <u>home</u> <u>of</u> <u>john</u>.

       Any parameter denoted by a <b>(H)</b> below can be used in the Homes section.

</pre><h4><b>Parameters</b></h4><pre>
       Parameters define the specific attributes of sections.

       Some parameters are specific to the [Global] section (e.g., <b>log</b> <b>type</b>). All others are permissible only in
       volume  sections.  The  letter  <u>G</u>  in  parentheses indicates that a parameter is specific to the [Global]
       section. The letter <u>V</u> indicates that a parameter can be specified in a volume specific section.

</pre><h4><b>Variable</b> <b>Substitutions</b></h4><pre>
       You can use variables in volume names. The use of variables in paths is limited to $u.

       1.  if you specify an unknown variable, it will not get converted.

       2.  if you specify a known variable, but that variable doesn’t have a value, it will get ignored.

       The variables which can be used for substitutions are:

              $b

                     basename

              $c

                     client’s ip address

              $d

                     volume pathname on server

              $f

                     full name (contents of the gecos field in the passwd file)

              $g

                     group name

              $h

                     hostname

              $i

                     client’s ip, without port

              $s

                     server name (this can be the hostname)

              $u

                     user name (if guest, it is the user that guest is running as)

              $v

                     volume name

              $$

                     prints dollar sign ($)

</pre><h4><b>Explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Parameters</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Authentication</b> <b>Options</b>
       ad domain = <u>domain</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Append @DOMAIN to username when authenticating.  Useful  in  Active  Directory  environments  that
              otherwise would require the user to enter the full user@domain string.

       admin auth user = <u>user</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Specifying  e.g.  “<b>admin</b>  <b>auth</b>  <b>user</b>  <b>=</b> <b>root</b>” whenever a normal user login fails, afpd will try to
              authenticate as the specified <b>admin</b> <b>auth</b> <b>user</b>.  If this succeeds, a normal session is created  for
              the  original  connecting user. Said differently: if you know the password of <b>admin</b> <b>auth</b> <b>user</b>, you
              can authenticate as any other user.

       admin group = <u>group</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Allows users of a certain group to be seen as the superuser when  they  log  in.  This  option  is
              disabled by default.

       force user = <u>user</u> <b>(G)</b>

              This specifies a UNIX user name that will be assigned as the default user for all users connecting
              to  this  server.  This  is useful for sharing files. You should also use it carefully as using it
              incorrectly can cause security problems.

       force group = <u>group</u> <b>(G)</b>

              This specifies a UNIX group name that will be assigned as the default primary group for all  users
              connecting to this server.

       guest account = <u>name</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Specifies  the  user  that guests should use (default is <b>nobody</b>). The name must be a valid user on
              the host system.

       k5 keytab = <u>path</u> <b>(G)</b>; k5 service = <u>service</u> <b>(G)</b>; k5 realm = <u>realm</u> <b>(G)</b>

              These are required if the server supports the Kerberos 5 authentication UAM.

       nt domain = <u>domain</u> <b>(G)</b>; nt separator = <u>SEPARATOR</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Use for e.g. winbind authentication, prepends both strings before the username from login and then
              tries to authenticate with the result through the available and active UAM authentication modules.

       save password = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>yes</u>) <b>(G)</b>

              Enables or disables the ability of clients to save passwords locally.

       set password = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(G)</b>

              Enables or disables the ability of clients to change their passwords via chooser or  the  “connect
              to server” dialog.

       uam list = <u>uam</u> <u>list</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Space or comma separated list of UAMs. (The default is “uams_dhx.so uams_dhx2.so”).

       The most commonly used UAMs are:

              uams_guest.so

                     allows guest logins

              uams_clrtxt.so

                     (uams_pam.so  or  uams_passwd.so)  Allow  logins  with  passwords transmitted in the clear.
                     Compatible with Mac OS 9 and earlier.

              uams_randnum.so

                     allows Random Number and Two-Way Random Number  Exchange  for  authentication  (requires  a
                     separate  file  containing  the  passwords,  either  the  default <u>afppasswd</u> file or the one
                     specified via “<b>passwd</b> <b>file</b>”). See <b><a href="../man1/afppasswd.1.html">afppasswd</a></b>(1) for details.  Compatible with Mac OS  9  and
                     earlier.

              uams_dhx.so

                     (uams_dhx_pam.so   or   uams_dhx_passwd.so)   Allow   Diffie-Hellman   eXchange  (DHX)  for
                     authentication.

              uams_dhx2.so

                     (uams_dhx2_pam.so or  uams_dhx2_passwd.so)  Allow  Diffie-Hellman  eXchange  2  (DHX2)  for
                     authentication.

              uam_gss.so

                     Allow Kerberos V for authentication (optional)

       uam path = <u>path</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Sets the default path for UAMs for this server.

   <b>Charset</b> <b>Options</b>
       With  OS  X  Apple introduced the AFP3 protocol. One of the big changes was, that AFP3 uses Unicode names
       encoded  as  Decomposed  UTF-8  (UTF8-MAC).  Previous  AFP/OS  versions  used  charsets  like   MacRoman,
       MacCentralEurope, etc.

       To  be  able  to  serve AFP3 and older clients at the same time, <b>afpd</b> needs to be able to convert between
       UTF-8 and Mac charsets. Even OS X clients partly still rely on the mac charset. As there’s no  way,  <b>afpd</b>
       can  detect the codepage a pre AFP3 client uses, you have to specify it using the <b>mac</b> <b>charset</b> option. The
       default is MacRoman, which should be fine for most western users.

       As <b>afpd</b> needs to interact with UNIX operating system as well,  it  needs  to  be  able  to  convert  from
       UTF8-MAC  /  Mac  charset  to  the UNIX charset.  By default <b>afpd</b> uses <u>UTF8</u>. You can set the UNIX charset
       using the <b>unix</b> <b>charset</b> option. If you’re using extended characters in the configuration files  for  <b>afpd</b>,
       make sure your terminal matches the <b>unix</b> <b>charset</b>.

       mac charset = <u>charset</u> <b>(G)</b>/<b>(V)</b>

              Specifies  the  Mac clients charset, e.g. <u>MAC_ROMAN</u>. This is used to convert strings and filenames
              to the clients codepage for OS9 and Classic, i.e. for authentication  and  AFP  messages  (SIGUSR2
              messaging).  This will also be the default for the volumes <b>mac</b> <b>charset</b>. Defaults to <u>MAC_ROMAN</u>.

       unix charset = <u>charset</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Specifies  the  servers  unix charset, e.g. <u>ISO-8859-15</u> or <u>EUC-JP</u>. This is used to convert strings
              to/from the systems locale, e.g. for authentication, server messages and volume names.  If  <u>LOCALE</u>
              is set, the systems locale is used. Defaults to <u>UTF8</u>.

       vol charset = <u>charset</u> <b>(G)</b>/<b>(V)</b>

              Specifies the encoding of the volumes filesystem. By default, it is the same as <b>unix</b> <b>charset</b>.

              <b>NOTE</b>

              It is highly recommended to stick to the default UTF-8 encoding.

   <b>Password</b> <b>Options</b>
       passwd file = <u>path</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Sets the path to the Randnum UAM passwd file for this server.

       passwd minlen = <u>number</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Sets the minimum password length, if supported by the UAM

   <b>Network</b> <b>Options</b>
       advertise ssh = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(G)</b>

              Allows  old  Mac  OS  X clients (10.3.3-10.4) to automagically establish a tunneled AFP connection
              through SSH. If this option is set,  the  server’s  answers  to  client’s  FPGetSrvrInfo  requests
              contain  an additional entry.  It depends on both client’s settings and a correctly configured and
              running <b><a href="../man8/sshd.8.html">sshd</a></b>(8) on the server to let things work.

              <b>NOTE</b>

              Setting this option is not recommended since globally encrypting  AFP  connections  via  SSH  will
              increase the server’s load significantly. On the other hand, Apple’s client side implementation of
              this feature in MacOS X versions prior to 10.3.4 contained a security flaw.

       afp interfaces = <u>name</u> <u>[name</u> <u>…]</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Specifies the network interfaces that the server should listen on. The default is to advertise the
              first IP address of the system, while listening for any incoming request.

              <b>NOTE</b>

              Do not use at the same time as the <b>afp</b> <b>listen</b> option.

       afp listen = <u>ip</u> <u>address[:port]</u> <u>[ip</u> <u>address[:port]</u> <u>…]</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Specifies the IP address that the server should advertise <b>and</b> listens to. The default is advertise
              the  first  IP  address of the system, but to listen for any incoming request. The network address
              may be specified either in dotted-decimal format for IPv4 or in hexadecimal format for IPv6.

              IPv6 address + port combination must use URL the format using square brackets [IPv6]:port

              <b>NOTE</b>

              Do not use at the same time as the <b>afp</b> <b>interfaces</b> option.

       afp port = <u>port</u> <u>number</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Allows a different TCP port to be used for AFP. The default is 548. Also  sets  the  default  port
              applied when none specified in an <b>afp</b> <b>listen</b> option.

       afp read locks = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(G)</b>

              Whether  to  apply  locks to the byte region read in FPRead calls. The AFP spec mandates this, but
              it’s not really in line with UNIX semantics and is a performance hog.

       cnid listen = <u>ip</u> <u>address[:port]</u> <u>[ip</u> <u>address[:port]</u> <u>…]</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Specifies the IP address and port that the CNID server should listen on.  This  should  match  the
              address and port of the <b>cnid</b> <b>server</b> option for most deployments. The default is <b>localhost:4700</b>.

       disconnect time = <u>number</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Keep disconnected AFP sessions for <u>number</u> hours before dropping them.  Default is 24 hours.

       dsireadbuf = <u>number</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Scale  factor  that  determines  the  size of the DSI/TCP readahead buffer, default is 12. This is
              multiplies with the DSI server quantum (default 1MiB) to give the size of the  buffer.  Increasing
              this  value  might  increase throughput in fast local networks for volume to volume copies.  <u>Note</u>:
              This buffer is allocated per afpd child process, so specifying large  values  will  eat  up  large
              amount of memory (buffer size * number of clients).

       fqdn = <u>name[:port]</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Specifies  a  fully-qualified  domain name, with an optional port. This is discarded if the server
              cannot resolve it. This option is not honored by AppleShare  clients  &lt;=  3.8.3.  This  option  is
              disabled  by  default.  Use with caution as this will involve a second name resolution step on the
              client side. Also note that afpd will advertise this name:port combination but  not  automatically
              listen to it.

       hostname = <u>name</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Use  this  instead  of  the  result  from  calling  hostname  for  determining which IP address to
              advertise, therefore the hostname is resolved to an IP which is the advertised. This is  NOT  used
              for listening and can be overridden by <b>afp</b> <b>listen</b>.

       max connections = <u>number</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Sets the maximum number of clients that can simultaneously connect to the server (default is 200).

       server quantum = <u>number</u> <b>(G)</b>

              This specifies the DSI server quantum. The default value is 0x100000 (1 MiB). The maximum value is
              0xFFFFFFFFF,  the minimum is 32000. If you specify a value that is out of range, the default value
              will be set. Do not change this value unless you’re absolutely sure, what you’re doing

       sleep time = <u>number</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Keep sleeping AFP sessions for <u>number</u> hours before disconnecting clients in sleep mode. Default is
              10 hours.

       tcprcvbuf = <u>number</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Try to set  TCP  receive  buffer  using  setsockopt().  Often  OSes  impose  restrictions  on  the
              applications ability to set this value.

       tcpsndbuf = <u>number</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Try  to set TCP send buffer using setsockopt(). Often OSes impose restrictions on the applications
              ability to set this value.

       recvfile = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(G)</b>

              Whether to use splice() on Linux for receiving data.

       splice size = <u>number</u> (default: <u>64k</u>) <b>(G)</b>

              Maximum number of bytes spliced.

       use sendfile = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>yes</u>) <b>(G)</b>

              Whether to use sendfile syscall for sending file data to clients.

       zeroconf = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>yes</u>) <b>(G)</b>

              Whether to use automatic Zeroconf service registration if Avahi or mDNSResponder were compiled in.

   <b>CNID</b> <b>Database</b> <b>Backend</b> <b>Options</b>
       Global configurations specific to the CNID database backend, which controls how the  database  is  stored
       and accessed.

       For granular control over the CNID database backend, see the Volume Parameters section below.

       cnid mysql host = <u>MySQL</u> <u>server</u> <u>address</u> <b>(G)</b>

              name or address of a MySQL server for use with the mysql CNID backend.

       cnid mysql user = <u>MySQL</u> <u>user</u> <b>(G)</b>

              MySQL user for authentication with the server.

       cnid mysql pw = <u>password</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Password for MySQL server.

       cnid mysql db = <u>database</u> <u>name</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Name of an existing database for which the specified user has full privileges.

       cnid server = <u>ipaddress[:port]</u> <b>(G)</b>/<b>(V)</b>

              Specifies  the IP address and port of a cnid_metad server, required for the CNID dbd backend. This
              should match the address and port of the <b>cnid</b> <b>listen</b> option  for  most  deployments.  Defaults  to
              localhost:4700.

              The  network  address  may be specified either in dotted-decimal format for IPv4 or in hexadecimal
              format for IPv6.

       vol dbpath = <u>path</u> <b>(G)</b>/<b>(V)</b>

              Sets the path where the database information will be  stored.  You  have  to  specify  a  writable
              location, even if the volume is read only.

       vol dbnest = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(G)</b>

              Setting  this  option  to  true brings back Netatalk 2 behaviour of storing the CNID database in a
              folder called .AppleDB inside the volume root of each share.

   <b>Miscellaneous</b> <b>Options</b>
       afpstats = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(G)</b>

              Whether to provide AFP runtime statistics (connected users, open volumes) via dbus.

       close vol = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(G)</b>

              Whether to close volumes possibly opened by clients when they’re removed  from  the  configuration
              and the configuration is reloaded.

       dircachesize = <u>number</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Maximum  possible  entries  in  the directory cache. The cache stores directories and files. It is
              used to cache the full path to directories  and  CNIDs  which  considerably  speeds  up  directory
              enumeration.

              Default  size  is  8192,  maximum size is 131072. Given value is rounded up to nearest power of 2.
              Each entry takes about 100 bytes, which is not much, but remember that every  afpd  child  process
              for every connected user has its cache.

       extmap file = <u>path</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Sets the path to the file which defines file extension type/creator mappings.

       force xattr with sticky bit = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(G)</b>/<b>(V)</b>

              Writing  metadata  xattr  on  directories with the sticky bit set may fail even though we may have
              write access to a directory, because if the sticky bit is set only the owner is allowed  to  write
              xattrs.

              By enabling this option Netatalk will write the metadata xattr as root.

       ignored attributes = <u>all</u> | <u>nowrite</u> | <u>nodelete</u> | <u>norename</u> <b>(G)</b>/<b>(V)</b>

              Specify  a  set of file and directory attributes that shall be ignored by the server, <u>all</u> includes
              all the other options.

              In OS X when the Finder sets a lock on a file/directory or you  set  the  BSD  uchg  flag  in  the
              Terminal,  all  three  attributes are used. Thus in order to ignore the Finder lock/BSD uchg flag,
              add set <u>ignored</u> <u>attributes</u> <u>=</u> <u>all</u>.

       mimic model = <u>model</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Specifies a custom icon for the mounted AFP volume on macOS (Mac OS X) clients. Default is to  let
              macOS choose. Requires netatalk to be built with Zeroconf. Examples:

              • <b>Laptop</b>

              • <b>RackMount</b>

              • <b>Tower</b>

              A  complete  set  of  supported  model  codes  by a macOS client can be found by inspecting system
              properties files,  such  as  <u>/System/Library/CoreServices/CoreTypes.bundle/Contents/Info.plist</u>  on
              macOS 15 Sequoia.

       server name = <u>name</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Specifies  a human-readable name that uniquely describes the AFP server.  Defaults to the value of
              <b>hostname</b> up until the first period.  When netatalk is built with Zeroconf support,  this  is  also
              registered as the service name and advertised as UTF-8, up to 63 octets (bytes) in length.

       signature = <u>STRING</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Specify  a  server  signature.  The  maximum  length  is  16 characters. This option is useful for
              clustered environments, to provide fault isolation etc. By default, afpd generates a signature and
              saves it to a file called <b>afp_signature.conf</b> automatically (based on  random  numbers).  See  also
              <a href="../man1/asip-status.1.html">asip-status</a>(1).

       solaris share reservations = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>yes</u>) <b>(G)</b>

              Use  share  reservations  on  Solaris.  Solaris  CIFS  server  uses this too, so this makes a lock
              coherent multi protocol server.

       veto message = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(G)</b>

              Send optional AFP messages for vetoed files. Then whenever a client tries to access  any  file  or
              directory  with  a  vetoed  name,  it  will  be  sent  an  AFP message indicating the name and the
              directory.

       volnamelen = <u>number</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Max length of UTF8-MAC volume name for Mac OS X. Note that Hangul is especially sensitive to this.

              73: limit of Mac OS X 10.1
              80: limit of Mac OS X 10.4/10.5 (default)
              255: limit of recent Mac OS X

              Mac OS 9 and earlier are not influenced by this, because Maccharset volume name is always  limited
              to 27 bytes.

       vol preset = <u>name</u> <b>(G)</b>/<b>(V)</b>

              Use  section  <u>name</u>  as option preset for all volumes (when set in the [Global] section) or for one
              volume (when set in that volume’s section).

   <b>Spotlight</b> <b>Options</b>
       Configure Netatalk’s Spotlight compatibility layer.

       dbus daemon = <u>path</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Sets the path to dbus-daemon  binary  used  by  the  Spotlight  feature.  Can  be  used  when  the
              compile-time default path does not match the runtime environment.

       sparql results limit = <u>NUMBER</u> (default: <u>UNLIMITED</u>) <b>(G)</b>

              Impose a limit on the number of results queried from Tracker or LocalSearch via SPARQL queries.

       spotlight = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(G)</b>/<b>(V)</b>

              Whether  to enable Spotlight searches. Note: once the global option is enabled, any volume that is
              not enabled won’t be searchable at all. See also <u>dbus</u> <u>daemon</u> option.

       spotlight attributes = <u>COMMA</u> <u>SEPARATED</u> <u>STRING</u> (default: <u>EMPTY</u>) <b>(G)</b>

              A list of attributes that are allowed to be used in Spotlight searches.  By default all attributes
              can be searched, passing a string limits attributes to elements of the string. Example:

              spotlight attributes = *,kMDItemTextContent

       spotlight expr = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>yes</u>) <b>(G)</b>

              Whether to allow the use of logic expression in searches.

   <b>Logging</b> <b>Options</b>
       Control what kinds of messages are logged, and where they are logged.

       log file = <u>logfile</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Write logs to <u>logfile</u> on the file system. If not specified, Netatalk logs  to  the  syslog  daemon
              facility.

       log level = <u>type:level</u> <u>[type:level</u> <u>…]</u> <b>(G)</b>; log level = <u>type:level,[type:level,</u> <u>…]</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Specify that any message of a loglevel up to the given <u>log</u> <u>level</u> should be logged.

              By default afpd logs to syslog with a default logging setup equivalent to <b>default:note</b>

              logtypes: default, afpdaemon, logger, uamsdaemon

              loglevels: severe, error, warn, note, info, debug, debug6, debug7, debug8, debug9, maxdebug

              <b>NOTE</b>

              Both logtype and loglevels are case insensitive.

       log microseconds = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>yes</u>) <b>(G)</b>

              Log  timestamps  with accuracy down to microseconds. If disabled, the timestamps record only whole
              seconds. Only takes effect when used in tandem with the <b>log</b> <b>file</b> option.

   <b>Filesystem</b> <b>Change</b> <b>Events</b> <b>(FCE)</b>
       Netatalk includes a nifty filesystem change  event  mechanism  where  afpd  processes  notify  interested
       listeners about certain filesystem event by UDP network datagrams.

       The following FCE events are defined:

       • file modification (<b>fmod</b>)

       • file deletion (<b>fdel</b>)

       • directory deletion (<b>ddel</b>)

       • file creation (<b>fcre</b>)

       • directory creation (<b>dcre</b>)

       • file move or rename (<b>fmov</b>)

       • directory move or rename (<b>dmov</b>)

       • login (<b>login</b>)

       • logout (<b>logout</b>)

       fce listener = <u>host[:port]</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Enables  sending  FCE  events  to  the  specified  <u>host</u>,  default  <u>port</u> is 12250 if not specified.
              Specifying multiple listeners is done by having this option once for each of them.

       fce version = <u>1</u> | <u>2</u> <b>(G)</b>

              FCE protocol version, default is 1. You need version 2 for the fmov, dmov, login or logout events.

       fce events = <u>fmod,fdel,ddel,fcre,dcre,fmov,dmov,login,logout</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Specifies which FCE events are active, default is <b>fmod,fdel,ddel,fcre,dcre</b>.

       fce coalesce = <u>all</u> | <u>delete</u> | <u>create</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Coalesce FCE events.

       fce holdfmod = <u>seconds</u> <b>(G)</b>

              This determines the time delay in seconds which is always waited if another file modification  for
              the  same  file  is  done  by  a  client before sending an FCE file modification event (fmod). For
              example saving a  file  in  Photoshop  would  generate  multiple  events  by  itself  because  the
              application  is opening, modifying and closing a file multiple times for every “save”. Default: 60
              seconds.

       fce sendwait = <u>milliseconds</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Defines a delay in milliseconds between the emission of each FCE  event.   Use  this  if  you  are
              experiencing  lost  FCE events when creating or deleting a very large number of files at once. The
              deluge of events that such an operation triggers can lead to UDP buffer overflow and  subsequently
              to packet loss. Has to be a number between 0 and 999.  Default: 0 milliseconds.

       fce ignore names = <u>NAME[,NAME2,…]</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Comma-delimited list of filenames for which FCE events shall not be generated. Default: <u>.DS_Store</u>

       fce ignore directories = <u>PATH[,PATH2,…]</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Comma-delimited  list  of paths to directories for which FCE events shall not be generated. Has to
              be an absolute path on the host file system.  Must not end with a slash. Default: empty

       fce notify script = <u>path</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Script which will be executed for every FCE event, see  contrib/shell_utils/fce_ev_script.sh  from
              the Netatalk sources for an example script.

   <b>Options</b> <b>for</b> <b>ACL</b> <b>handling</b>
       By  default, the effective permission of the authenticated user are only mapped to the mentioned UARights
       permission structure, not the UNIX mode. You can adjust this behaviour with the configuration option  <b>map</b>
       <b>acls</b>:

       chmod request = <u>preserve</u> (default) | <u>ignore</u> | <u>simple</u> <b>(G)</b>/<b>(V)</b>

              Advanced permission control that deals with ACLs.

              • <b>ignore</b>  -  UNIX  chmod()  requests  are  completely ignored, use this option to allow the parent
                directory’s ACL inheritance full control over new items.

              • <b>preserve</b> - preserve ZFS ACEs for named users and groups or POSIX ACL group mask

              • <b>simple</b> - just to a chmod() as requested without any extra steps

       map acls = <u>none</u> | <u>rights</u> | <u>mode</u> <b>(G)</b>

              none

                     no mapping of ACLs

              rights

                     effective permissions are mapped to UARights structure. This is the default.

              mode

                     ACLs are additionally mapped to the UNIX mode of the filesystem object.

       If you want to be able to display ACLs on the client, you must setup both client and server as part on  a
       authentication domain (directory service, e.g. LDAP, Open Directory, Active Directory). The reason is, in
       OS  X  ACLs  are  bound  to  UUIDs, not just uid’s or gid’s. Therefore Netatalk must be able to map every
       filesystem uid and gid to a UUID so that it can return the server side ACLs which are bound to  UNIX  uid
       and gid mapped to OS X UUIDs.

       Netatalk can query a directory server using LDAP queries. Either the directory server already provides an
       UUID  attribute  for  user and groups (Active Directory, Open Directory) or you reuse an unused attribute
       (or add a new one) to you directory server (eg OpenLDAP).

       The following LDAP options must be configured for Netatalk:

       ldap auth method = <u>none</u> | <u>simple</u> <b>(G)</b>

              none

                     anonymous LDAP bind

              simple

                     simple LDAP bind

       ldap auth dn = <u>dn</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Distinguished Name of the user for simple bind.

       ldap auth pw = <u>password</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Password for simple bind.

       ldap uri = <u>ldap://somehost:1234/</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Specifies the LDAP URI of the server to connect to. The URI scheme may be ldap,  ldapi  or  ldaps,
              specifying LDAP over TCP, ICP or TLS respectively (if supported by the LDAP library). This is only
              needed for explicit ACL support in order to be able to query LDAP for UUIDs.

              You can use <b><a href="../man1/afpldaptest.1.html">afpldaptest</a></b>(1) to syntactically check your config.

       ldap userbase = <u>base</u> <u>dn</u> <b>(G)</b>

              DN of the user container in LDAP.

       ldap userscope = <u>scope</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Search scope for user search: <b>base</b> | <b>one</b> | <b>sub</b>

       ldap groupbase = <u>base</u> <u>dn</u> <b>(G)</b>

              DN of the group container in LDAP.

       ldap groupscope = <u>scope</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Search scope for group search: <b>base</b> | <b>one</b> | <b>sub</b>

       ldap uuid attr = <u>dn</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Name of the LDAP attribute with the UUIDs.

              Note: this is used both for users and groups.

       ldap name attr = <u>dn</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Name of the LDAP attribute with the users short name.

       ldap group attr = <u>dn</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Name of the LDAP attribute with the groups short name.

       ldap uuid string = <u>STRING</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Format  of  the  uuid  string in the directory. A series of x and -, where every x denotes a value
              0-9a-f and every - is a separator.

              Default: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

       ldap uuid encoding = <u>string</u> (default) | <u>ms-guid</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Format of the UUID of the LDAP attribute, allows usage of the binary objectGUID fields from Active
              Directory. If left unspecified, string is  the  default,  which  passes  through  the  ASCII  UUID
              returned  by  most  other  LDAP  stores.  If  set  to ms-guid, the internal UUID representation is
              converted to and from the binary format used in the  objectGUID  attribute  found  on  objects  in
              Active Directory when interacting with the server.

              See also the options <b>ldap</b> <b>user</b> <b>filter</b> and <b>ldap</b> <b>group</b> <b>filter</b>.

              string

                     UUID is a string, use with e.g. OpenDirectory.

              ms-guid

                     Binary objectGUID from Active Directory

       ldap user filter = <u>STRING</u> (default: unused) <b>(G)</b>

              Optional  LDAP  filter  that  matches  user  objects.  This  is  necessary  for  Active  Directory
              environments where users and groups are stored in the same directory subtree.

              Recommended setting for Active Directory: <b>objectClass=user</b>.

       ldap group filter = <u>STRING</u> (default: unused) <b>(G)</b>

              Optional LDAP  filter  that  matches  group  objects.  This  is  necessary  for  Active  Directory
              environments where users and groups are stored in the same directory subtree.

              Recommended setting for Active Directory: <b>objectClass=group</b>.

   <b>Classic</b> <b>Options</b>
       Enable  Netatalk  features  that  are  only relevant for Classic Mac OS or Apple II clients. See also the
       Charset options elsewhere in this manual.

       appletalk = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(G)</b>

              Enables support for AFP-over-AppleTalk. This option requires that your operating  system  supports
              the AppleTalk networking protocol, and that Netatalk was built with AppleTalk support.

       ddp address = <u>ddp</u> <u>address</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Specifies  the  DDP address of the server. The default is to auto-assign an address (0.0). This is
              only useful if you are running AppleTalk on more than one interface.

       ddp zone = <u>ddp</u> <u>zone</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Specifies the AppleTalk zone to register the server in. The default is to register the  server  in
              the default zone of the last interface configured by the system.

       legacy icon = <u>icon</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Sets the shared volume icon displayed in the Finder in Classic Mac OS.  Note that some versions of
              Classic Mac OS ignores this icon. Examples of valid icon styles:

              • <b>daemon</b>

              • <b>globe</b>

              • <b>sdcard</b>

       legacy volume size = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(V)</b>

              Limit  disk  size  reporting  to  2GB  for  legacy clients. This can be used for older Macintoshes
              running System 7.1 or earlier and using newer AppleShare clients.

       login message = <u>message</u> <b>(G)</b>/<b>(V)</b>

              Sets a message to be displayed when Classic Mac OS clients log on  to  the  server.   The  message
              should be in <b>unix</b> <b>charset</b>.  Extended characters are allowed.

       prodos = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(V)</b>

              Enable  ProDOS  support.  This  option should only be enabled for volumes you expect to netboot an
              Apple II from. In addition to setting the boot flag on the volume, it restricts  the  volume  free
              space reported to the client to 32MB.

   <b>Debug</b> <b>Parameters</b>
       These options are useful for debugging only. Do <b>NOT</b> enable them in production environments!

       tickleval = <u>number</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Sets the tickle timeout interval (in seconds). Defaults to 30.

       timeout = <u>number</u> <b>(G)</b>

              Specify the number of tickles to send before timing out a connection.  The default is 4, therefore
              a connection will timeout after 2 minutes.

       client polling = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(G)</b>

              With this option enabled, afpd won’t advertise that it is capable of server notifications, so that
              connected clients poll the server every 10 seconds to detect changes in opened server windows.

</pre><h4><b>Explanation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Volume</b> <b>Parameters</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Home</b> <b>Section</b> <b>Parameters</b>
       Special parameters that only apply to the home volume.

       basedir regex = <u>regex</u> <b>(H)</b>

              Regular  expression  which  matches  the  parent  directory  of  the user homes.  If <b>basedir</b> <b>regex</b>
              contains symlink, you must set the canonicalized absolute path. In the simple case this is just  a
              path i.e.  <b>basedir</b> <b>regex</b> <b>=</b> <b><a href="file:/home">/home</a></b>

       home name = <u>name</u> <b>(H)</b>

              AFP user home volume name. The default is <u>$u’s</u> <u>home</u>. The name must contain “<u>$u</u>”.

   <b>Volume</b> <b>Sections</b> <b>Parameters</b>
       Each volume should at least define <b>path</b> and <b>volume</b> <b>name</b>.

       path = <u>path</u> <b>(V)</b>

              The path name must be a fully qualified path name.

       volume name = <u>STRING</u> (default: section name in lowercase) <b>(V)</b>

              The  volume  name option specifies the name of the shared AFP volume.  When not set, this defaults
              to the name of the ini file section where the volume is defined, converted to lowercase.

              No two volumes may have the same name.  The volume name cannot contain  the  ‘:’  character.   The
              volume  name  is mangled if it is very long.  Mac charset volume name is limited to 27 characters.
              UTF8-MAC volume name is limited to volnamelen parameter.

       vol size limit = <u>size</u> <u>in</u> <u>MiB</u> <b>(V)</b>

              Useful for Time Machine: limits the reported volume size, thus preventing Time Machine from  using
              the  whole  real disk space for backup.  Example: “<b>vol</b> <b>size</b> <b>limit</b> <b>=</b> <b>1000</b>” would limit the reported
              disk space to 1 GB.

              <b>IMPORTANT</b>

              This is an approximated calculation taking into account the contents of Time Machine  sparsebundle
              images.  Therefore  you  MUST  NOT  use this volume to store other content when using this option,
              because it would NOT be accounted for. The calculation works by reading the  band  size  from  the
              Info.plist  XML file of the sparsebundle, reading the bands/ directory counting the number of band
              files, and then multiplying one with the other.

       valid users = <u>user</u> / <u>@group</u> <b>(V)</b>

              The allow option allows the users and groups that access a share to be specified. Users and groups
              are specified, delimited by spaces or commas. Groups are designated by a @ prefix. Example:

              valid users = user @group

       invalid users = <u>user</u> / <u>@group</u> <b>(V)</b>

              The deny option specifies users and groups who are not allowed access to the share. It follows the
              same format as the “valid users” option.

       hosts allow = <u>IP</u> <u>host</u> <u>address/IP</u> <u>netmask</u> <u>bits</u> [ … ] <b>(V)</b>

              Only listed hosts and networks are allowed, all others are rejected. The network  address  may  be
              specified either in dotted-decimal format for IPv4 or in hexadecimal format for IPv6.

              Example: hosts allow = 10.1.0.0/16 10.2.1.100 2001:0db8:1234::/48

       hosts deny = <u>IP</u> <u>host</u> <u>address/IP</u> <u>netmask</u> <u>bits</u> [ … ] <b>(V)</b>

              Listed hosts and nets are rejected, all others are allowed.

              Example: hosts deny = 192.168.100/24 10.1.1.1 2001:db8::1428:57ab

       cnid scheme = <u>backend</u> <b>(V)</b>

              set  the  CNID  backend  to  be  used  for  the  volume.  The “dbd” and “last” backends are always
              available. Default is <b>dbd</b>.  Run <u>afpd</u> <u>-v</u> to see a list of available backends.

              The “last” backend is read only, used to mount CD-ROMs and similar media.

              The optional “mysql” backend requires the system  administrator  to  provision  a  MySQL  database
              instance for use with Netatalk, as well as setting the <u>cnid</u> <u>mysql</u> <u>*</u> configuration options.

       ea = <u>sys</u> | <u>samba</u> | <u>ad</u> | <u>none</u> (default: auto detect) <b>(V)</b>

              Specify how Extended Attributes and Classic Mac OS resource forks are stored.

              By default, we attempt to enable <b>sys</b> with a fallback to <b>none</b>.  For the auto detection to work, the
              volume  needs  to be writable because we attempt to set an EA on the shared directory itself.  For
              read-only volumes, set this option explicitly.

              sys

                     Use filesystem Extended Attributes.

              samba

                     Use filesystem Extended Attributes, but append a 0 byte  to  each  xattr  in  order  to  be
                     compatible with Samba’s vfs_streams_xattr.

              ad

                     Use  AppleDouble v2 metadata stored as files in <u>.AppleDouble</u> directories.  This should only
                     be used when the host’s filesystem does not support Extended Attributes.

              none

                     No Extended Attributes support.

              <b>WARNING</b>

              The <b>samba</b> option should not be used on a volume that was previously set to <b>sys</b>. This may lead data
              loss.

       mac charset = <u>charset</u> <b>(V)</b>

              specifies the Mac client charset for this Volume, e.g. <u>MAC_ROMAN</u>, <u>MAC_CYRILLIC</u>. If  not  specified
              the  global  setting  is applied. This setting is only required if you need volumes, where the Mac
              charset differs from the one globally set in the [Global] section.

       casefold = <u>option</u> <b>(V)</b>

              The casefold option handles, if the case of filenames should be changed.   The  available  options
              are:

              <b>tolower</b> - Lowercases names in both directions.

              <b>toupper</b> - Uppercases names in both directions.

              <b>xlatelower</b> - Client sees lowercase, server sees uppercase.

              <b>xlateupper</b> - Client sees uppercase, server sees lowercase.

       password = <u>password</u> <b>(V)</b>

              This  option  allows  you  to  set  a volume password, which can be a maximum of 8 characters long
              (using ASCII strongly recommended at the time of this writing).

       file perm = <u>mode</u> <b>(V)</b>; directory perm = <u>mode</u> <b>(V)</b>

              Add(or) with the client requested permissions: <b>file</b> <b>perm</b> is for files only, <b>directory</b> <b>perm</b> is  for
              directories only. Don’t use with “<b>unix</b> <b>priv</b> <b>=</b> <b>no</b>”.

              <b>Example</b>: Volume for a collaborative workgroup

              file perm = 0660
              directory perm = 0770

       umask = <u>mode</u> <b>(V)</b>

              set perm mask. Don’t use with “<b>unix</b> <b>priv</b> <b>=</b> <b>no</b>”.

       preexec = <u>command</u> <b>(V)</b>

              command to be run when the volume is mounted

       postexec = <u>command</u> <b>(V)</b>

              command to be run when the volume is closed

       rolist = <u>users/groups</u> <b>(V)</b>

              Allows  certain  users  and  groups  to  have read-only access to a share.  This follows the allow
              option format.

       rwlist = <u>users/groups</u> <b>(V)</b>

              Allows certain users and groups to have read/write access to a  share.   This  follows  the  allow
              option format.

       veto files = <u>vetoed</u> <u>names</u> <b>(V)</b>

              hide  files and directories,where the path matches one of the ‘/’ delimited vetoed names. The veto
              string must always be  terminated  with  a  ‘/’,  e.g.  “<b>veto</b>  <b>files</b>  <b>=</b>  <b>veto1/</b>”,  “<b>veto</b>  <b>files</b>  <b>=</b>
              <b>veto1/veto2/</b>”.

   <b>Volume</b> <b>options</b>
       Boolean volume options.

       acls = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>yes</u>) <b>(V)</b>

              Whether to flag volumes as supporting ACLs. If ACL support is compiled in, this is yes by default.

       case sensitive = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>yes</u>) <b>(V)</b>

              Whether   to   flag   volumes  as  supporting  case-sensitive  filenames.  If  the  filesystem  is
              case-insensitive, set to no. However, it is not fully verified.

              <b>NOTE</b>

              In spite of being case sensitive as a matter of fact, netatalk 3.1.3 and earlier  did  not  notify
              kCaseSensitive flag to the client. Starting with 3.1.4, it is notified correctly by default.

       cnid dev = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>yes</u>) <b>(V)</b>

              Whether  to  use  the  device  number  in  the  CNID backends. Helps when the device number is not
              constant across a reboot, e.g. cluster, …

       convert appledouble = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>yes</u>) <b>(V)</b>

              Whether automatic conversion  from  AppleDouble  v2  to  Extended  Attributes  is  performed  when
              accessing  filesystems  from  clients.  This is generally useful, but costs some performance. It’s
              recommendable to run <b>dbd</b> on volumes and do the conversion with that. Then this option can  be  set
              to <u>no</u>.

       delete veto files = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(V)</b>

              This  option  is  used when Netatalk is attempting to delete a directory that contains one or more
              vetoed files or directories (see the veto files option). If this option is set to no (the default)
              then if a directory contains any non-vetoed files or directories then the  directory  delete  will
              fail. This is usually what you want.

              If  this  option  is  set  to  yes, then Netatalk will attempt to recursively delete any files and
              directories within the vetoed directory.

       follow symlinks = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(V)</b>

              The default setting is false thus symlinks are not followed  on  the  server.  This  is  the  same
              behaviour  as  OS X’s AFP server. Setting the option to true causes afpd to follow symlinks on the
              server. symlinks may point outside of the AFP volume, currently afpd doesn’t  do  any  checks  for
              “wide symlinks”.

              <b>NOTE</b>

              This option will subtly break when the symlinks point across filesystem boundaries.

       invisible dots = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(V)</b>

              make  dot  files invisible. WARNING: enabling this option will lead to unwanted side effects where
              OS X applications, when saving files to a temporary file starting with a dot first, then  renaming
              the  temp  file  to  its final name, result in the saved file being invisible. The only thing this
              option is useful for is making files that start with a dot invisible on Mac OS 9. It’s  completely
              useless  on  Mac  OS  X,  as  both  in Finder and in Terminal files starting with a dot are hidden
              anyway.

       network ids = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>yes</u>) <b>(V)</b>

              Whether the server support network ids. Setting this to <u>no</u> will result in the client not using ACL
              AFP functions.

       preexec close = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(V)</b>

              A non-zero return code from preexec close the volume  being  immediately,  preventing  clients  to
              mount/see the volume in question.

       read only = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(V)</b>

              Specifies the share as being read only for all users.  Forces <b>ea</b> <b>=</b> <b>sys</b>.

       search db = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(V)</b>

              Use  fast  CNID  database  namesearch  instead  of  slow  recursive filesystem search. Relies on a
              consistent CNID database, i.e. Samba or local  filesystem  access  lead  to  inaccurate  or  wrong
              results. Works only for “dbd” CNID db volumes.

       stat vol = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>yes</u>) <b>(V)</b>

              Whether  to  stat  volume  path  when enumerating volumes list, useful for automounting or volumes
              created by a preexec script.

       time machine = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>no</u>) <b>(V)</b>

              Whether to enable Time Machine support for this volume.

       unix priv = <u>BOOLEAN</u> (default: <u>yes</u>) <b>(V)</b>

              Whether to use AFP3 UNIX privileges. This should be set for OS X clients.  See  also:  <b>file</b>  <b>perm</b>,
              <b>directory</b> <b>perm</b>, and <b>umask</b>.

</pre><h4><b>Examples</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Example:</b> <b>Modern</b> <b>Mac</b> <b>clients</b>
       This  enables  Spotlight  and  AFP  stats if Netatalk was built with Spotlight and AFP stats support. The
       <b>mimic</b> <b>model</b> option is used to make the server look like an Xserve.

       The home directory is mounted on <u><a href="file:/home/">/home/</a>{user}/afp-data</u>.

              [Global]
              afpstats = yes
              spotlight = yes
              mimic model = RackMac

              [Home]
              basedir regex = <a href="file:/home">/home</a>
              path = afp-data

   <b>Example:</b> <b>Classic</b> <b>Mac</b> <b>clients</b>
       This enables AppleTalk if Netatalk was built with AppleTalk support.   The  Random  Number  and  ClearTxt
       authentication  modules  are  used.   The  <b>legacy</b>  <b>icon</b> option is used to make the server look like a BSD
       Daemon.

       With <b>legacy</b> <b>volume</b> <b>size</b> the volume size is limited to 2 GB for very old Macs, while  <b>prodos</b>  is  used  to
