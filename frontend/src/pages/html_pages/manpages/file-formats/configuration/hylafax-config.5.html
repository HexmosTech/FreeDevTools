       config - <u>HylaFAX</u> configuration database

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>HylaFAX</u> uses a configuration file for the central queueing agent and for each facsimile modem attached to
       a  machine.   These files contain information about the modems and about how the <u>HylaFAX</u> server processes
       that service these modem should operate.  Configuration files are located in the <b>etc</b>  subdirectory.   The
       configuration  file  for  the <u><a href="../man8/faxq.8.html">faxq</a></u>(8) program is named <b>config</b>.  The per-modem configuration files used by
       the <u><a href="../man8/faxgetty.8.html">faxgetty</a></u>(8), <u><a href="../man8/faxsend.8.html">faxsend</a></u>(8), and <u><a href="../man8/pagesend.8.html">pagesend</a></u>(8) programs have names of the form <b>config.</b><u>devid</u><b>,</b> where <u>devid</u> is
       an identifier derived from the name of the modem's device file; for example <u>ttym2</u> for <u>/dev/ttym2</u>, <u>term_10</u>
       for <u>/dev/term/10</u>.

       Configuration files have a simple format and are entirely ASCII.  A configuration  parameter  is  of  the
       form
            <b>tag</b>: <u>value</u>
       where  a  <u>tag</u>  identifies a parameter and a <u>value</u> is either a string, number, or boolean value.  Comments
       are introduced by the ``#'' character and extend to the end of the line.   String  values  start  at  the
       first  non-blank  character  after  the  ``:''  and continue to the first non-whitespace character or, if
       whitespace is to be included, may be enclosed in quote marks (``"'').  String values  enclosed  in  quote
       marks  may also use the standard C programming conventions for specifying escape codes; e.g. ``\n'' for a
       newline character and ``\xxx'' for an octal value.  Numeric values  are  specified  according  to  the  C
       programming  conventions (leading ``0x'' for hex, leading ``0'' for octal, otherwise decimal), except for
       a few parameters, such as <b>RecvFileMode</b>, whose value is  interpreted  strictly  as  an  octal  number  and
       <b>PageChopThreshold</b>  whose  value  is  interpreted strictly as a floating point number.  Boolean values are
       case insensitive.  For a true value, either ``Yes'' or ``On'' should be used.  For  a  false  value,  use
       ``No'' or ``Off''.

       The  following  table itemizes the tags and the expected type of their value.  The first part lists items
       specific to the operation of each server, while the second part has items related to the servicing of the
       modem.  Parameters marked with a ¹ are used only by the <u>HylaFAX</u> scheduler process and should appear  only
       in  the  file named <b>config</b>.  Parameters marked with a ² are used by both the scheduler and the per-device
       applications and so should appear in all appropriate configuration files (i.e.  <b>config</b> and any per-device
       files that make sense).  Parameters not otherwise marked should appear only in  per-device  configuration
       files.  More detailed information about each item is given following the table.

</pre><h4><b>SERVER-ORIENTED</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       These configuration parameters affect the general operation of the fax server.

       <b>AdaptiveAnswer</b>
              Control whether or not an adaptive answering strategy is used whereby an incoming call is answered
              in  multiple  ways according to the list specified in the <b>AnswerRotary</b> parameter.  For example, if
              adaptive answering is enabled and <b>AnswerRotary</b> specifies ``fax data'', then an incoming call  will
              first  be  answered  as  fax  using  <b>ModemAnswerFaxCmd</b>  and  then,  if  that  fails, as data using
              <b>ModemAnswerDataCmd</b>.  If the adaptive answer strategy is not enabled, then calls are answered using
              the appropriate <b>ModemAnswer*Cmd</b> parameter  (normally  <b>ModemAnswerCmd</b>  for  unattended  operation).
              Note  that  the  adaptive answer strategy depends on many factors that limit its usefulness.  When
              calls are answered first as fax, it typically only works with  a  Class  1  modem  because  it  is
              important  that  the  sequence  of  operations related to answering as fax be completed in a short
              enough time that a subsequent answer for data be done before the caller times out and hangs up the
              telephone (for this reason <b>Class1RecvIdentTimer</b> should be set to a  value  that  is  shorter  than
              <b>FaxT1Timer</b>.)   Also,  note  that it is sometimes necessary to arrange that the phone be placed on-
              hook between successive answers; this can typically be done by inserting the  appropriate  command
              at the start of the second and subsequent <b>ModemAnswer*Cmd</b>s.

       <b>AdminGroup</b>
              Tells  PAM  what user group is allowed to administer the fax server.  Only useful if the server is
              compiled with PAM enabled.

       <b>AnswerRotary</b>
              The sequence of answering techniques the server should ``rotate  through''  when  answer  incoming
              calls.  Answering techniques are:
              <b>Name</b>    <b>Description</b>
              fax     answer a fax call
              data    answer a data call
              voice   answer a voice call
              extern  use the <u>vgetty</u> application to answer a call
              any     answer a call of any/unknown type
              When  a  call  is  not answered successfully, the server advances the rotary to the next specified
              answering technique.  If <b>AdaptiveAnswer</b>  is  enabled,  the  server  will  try  all  the  answering
              techniques  for  each incoming call.  Otherwise, the rotary is advanced <u>between</u> unsuccessful phone
              calls.  For example, if <b>AdaptiveAnswer</b> is disabled and <b>AnswerRotary</b>  is  ``fax  data'',  then  the
              calls  will  initially be answered as fax until the first call is received that does not appear to
              be from a fax machine; after that calls will be answered as if they were from a data  modem  until
              the  next  unsuccessful  call; after which they will one again be answered as fax.  Only the first
              three techniques  listed  are  used;  any  additional  ones  are  (silently)  ignored.   See  also
              <b>AnswerBias</b>.

       <b>AnswerBias</b>
              The  index  into  the  <b>AnswerRotary</b>  list  that  the  server  should rotate the list to after each
              successful incoming phone call.  List indices are numbered starting  at  zero.   For  example,  if
              <b>AnswerRotary</b>  is  ``fax  data''  and <b>AnswerBias</b> is 1, then after each successful inbound call, the
              next call will be answered as data.

       <b>AreaCode²</b>
              The local area code in which the facsimile modem resides.  This value is passed to the dial string
              rules that are  used,  for  example,  to  formulate  canonical  phone  numbers  for  dialing  (see
              <b>DialStringRules</b> below.)

       <b>AuditHook¹</b>
              Specifies  a program command and an interest specification indicating which events as described in
              <u><a href="../man8/faxwatch.8.html">faxwatch</a></u>(8) should trigger the execution of the program.  For example, this configuration:

                  AuditHook: "bin/hook: J*S*M*R*"

              would cause bin/hook to be executed upon every event.  The arguments passed to  the  hook  program
              are respectively <u>&lt;class&gt;</u>, <u>&lt;mask&gt;</u>, <u>&lt;id&gt;</u>, and optionally <u>[info]</u> where...

                  &lt;class&gt; = JOB | SEND | MODEM | RECV
                  &lt;mask&gt;  = the specific event
                  &lt;id&gt;    = id of the job/modem with which the event is associated
                  [info]  = additional information

       <b>BadPageHandlingMethod</b>
              (Class  1/1.0  only)  Specifies how to react to a bad page received from the remote sender: one of
              ``RTN'', ``DCN'', or ``RTN-SAVE''.

              If a page is received in non-ECM mode with unacceptable quality according to  <b>PercentGoodLines</b>  or
              <b>MaxConseutiveBadLines</b>  then  it  can  be  somewhat  difficult to inform the sender of the problem.
              Historically, <u>HylaFAX</u> has assumed  that  signalling  RTN  to  the  sender  will  accomplish  this.
              However,  some  senders  are incapable of retransmitting pages, and to reduce burden they treat an
              RTN signal as a receipt confirmation and proceed to the next page without  notifying  the  sending
              user of the potential problem in readability on the receive-end.  (The assumption there being that
              the receiving user will notify the sending user if there actually is a readability problem.)

              A setting of ``RTN'' is the historic behavior and assumes that an RTN signal will be enough to get
              the  sender  to  retransmit  or  be  otherwise  informed of a potential readability problem on the
              receive-end.  The previously-received page data is marked to be overwritten by the next page  data
              received from the sender.

              A  setting  of ``DCN'' tells <u>HylaFAX</u> to transmit a DCN signal in response to the post-page message
              and should trigger a call abortion by the sender.  This should clearly indicate a problem in  page
              readability  to  the sender, although the receipt of any following pages in a later call cannot be
              guaranteed.

              A setting  of  ``RTN-SAVE''  more  closely  approximates  the  behavior  of  other  fax  receivers
              (especially  fax  machines).  It causes <u>HylaFAX</u> to send the RTN signal but it saves the previously
              received page data and places the next transmitted page data in another page.  This is the default
              setting.  However, this could result in multiple copies of the same page image being saved in  the
              same file - if the sender does indeed retransmit the unacceptable pages during the same call.

       <b>BatchLogs¹</b>
              When  sending  or  receiving  multiple  documents  (denoted  by EOM), this value determines if the
              session logs span the entire batch or, if set to no, only contain a single document.

       <b>CallIDPattern</b>
              A string that identifies the caller's identity in any call identification messages provided by the
              modem (such as Caller*ID or DNIS/DID).  The specified string is compared against any  unrecognized
              status messages received from the modem before <b>ModemAnswerCmd</b> is sent to the modem.  If there is a
              match,  then  the  remainder of the message is returned as <b>CallIDn</b> where n corresponds to the n'th
              instance that this <b>CallIDPattern</b> is from the top in the modem configuration  file.   For  example,
              for the ZyXEL U-1496 this parameter would be set to
              CallIDPattern: ``CALLER NAME: '' (note the trailing space).
              If more than one message matches between instances of "RING" messages, then the message remainders
              are concatenated.

              The  special  <b>CallID</b>  value  of  "SHIELDED_DTMF" is used in conjunction with <b>ModemRingResponse</b> and
              <b>CallIDAnswerLength.</b>  After executing <b>ModemRingResponse,</b> HylaFAX will  expect  DTMF  data  (usually
              DLE-shielded) for <b>CallIDn</b> until <b>CallIDAnswerLength</b> is reached.  Note that if the modem is in voice
              mode  to  hear  these DTMF digits, then it must be returned to fax mode in the <b>ModemAnswerCmd.</b>  In
              order to prevent this feature from losing incoming fax calls, if fax sender CNG is detected  while
              waiting  for  DTMF  or  if  ten seconds elapse without sufficient DTMF then the remaining expected
              digits will be populated by whitespace, triggering fax answering.

              For example, the following settings will cause HylaFAX to enter voice mode and go off-hook when  a
              RING is detected.  It will then expect four DTMF digits (presumably for routing), and then it will
              pause for 100 ms before returning to fax mode and answering the call.

                ModemRingResponse:     AT+FCLASS=8;H1
                CallIDPattern:         SHIELDED_DTMF
                CallIDAnswerLength:    4
                ModemAnswerCmd:        &lt;delay:100&gt;AT+FCLASS=1;A

              For  modems  that  do not support AT+FCLASS=8 (such as some USR modems) this may be an appropriate
              equivalent:

                ModemRingResponse:      "AT#CLS=8\nAT#VLS=4\nATA"
                CallIDPattern:          SHIELDED_DTMF
                CallIDAnswerLength:     4
                ModemAnswerCmd:         "&lt;delay:100&gt;AT+FCLASS=1\nATA"

              Multiple entries of <b>CallIDPattern</b> are used together in one modem configuration file  in  order  to
              capture  multiple  <b>CallID</b>  responses.   For  example,  the following settings would capture "NDID"
              responses from the modem as CallID1, "NMBR" responses from the modem as CallID2, "NAME"  responses
              as  CallID3, and it would trigger <b>ModemAnswerCmd</b> whenever CallID1 or CallID2 were longer than 7 or
              10 characters, respectively.

                CallIDPattern:         "NDID="
                CallIDAnswerLength:    7
                CallIDPattern:         "NMBR="
                CallIDAnswerLength:    10
                CallIDPattern:         "NAME="

              Note that this example is only given as an example, and probably would cause  unexpected  results.
              Because  pattern-matching  ends  when  <b>ModemAnswerCmd</b> is sent to the modem, if "NDID", "NMBR", and
              "NAME" responses came from the modem in that order,  and  the  "NDID"  response  was  at  least  7
              characters  long,  then <b>ModemAnswerCmd</b> would be sent to the modem immediately following the "NDID"
              response,  and  the  "NMBR"  and  "NAME"  responses  would  be  ignored.    Generally   only   one
              <b>CallIDAnswerLength</b> item should be in a modem configuration file.

       <b>CallIDAnswerLength</b>
              An  integer  indicating  the  minimum  number  of  characters  in  a  <b>CallID</b> matching the previous
              <b>CallIDPattern</b> to be received when  <b>ModemAnswerCmd</b>  is  sent  to  the  modem  irrespective  of  any
              <b>RingsBeforeAnswer</b>  value  greater  than  zero.   This  allows the answering of calls which deliver
              CID/DID data but not RINGs.  For example,
              CallIDAnswerLength: ``7''
              would cause the call to be answered when <b>CallID2</b> reached a length of seven  digits.   A  value  of
              zero for <b>CallIDAnswerLength</b> disables this feature.

       <b>ClocalAsRoot</b>
              Control  whether operations that set the CLOCAL bit on the modem device special file are done with
              the effective user-ID set to the super-user or the ``fax'' user.  By default such  operations  are
              done  as  the  fax  user,  except  under  IRIX where they are done as the super-user (because IRIX
              disallows manipulation of CLOCAL by anyone but the super-user).

       <b>ContCoverCmd¹</b>
              The command to invoke to generate a continuation cover page; see <b>ContCoverPage</b> and <u><a href="../man8/mkcover.8.html">mkcover</a></u>(8).

       <b>ContCoverPage¹</b>
              A template file to use in creating <u>continuation</u> <u>cover</u> <u>pages</u>.  If this parameter is non-null,  then
              the server will pass the filename to the command specified by <b>ContCoverCmd</b> to generate cover pages
              for  outbound  jobs  that  are  continued  after  protocol errors.  These cover pages identify the
              receiver and indicate that the document is a continued transmission.  If  this  parameter  is  not
              specified  or  is null, then the server will not generate continuation cover pages.  The specified
              pathname must be relative to the top of the fax server's spooling area.

       <b>CountryCode²</b>
              The local country code in which the facsimile modem resides.   As  for  <b>AreaCode</b>,  this  value  is
              passed  to the dial string rules for use in formulating canonical phone numbers for dialing (among
              other things.)

       <b>CountSkippedPages</b>
              If a page range has been specified in the job, and pages are being skipped during the  send,  this
              controls  if the pages skipped are counted in the pages counted and totaled.  If skipped pages are
              to be counted, it will appear as if the pages were instantly sent  in  0:00  with  no  data.   The
              tagline  counts will be incremented on skipped pages, and faxq will notify clients via triggers of
              them as well.  If the are not to be counted, then tagline page counts will act  as  if  the  pages
              never existed, and not faxq trigger notifications will be sent.

       <b>DeviceMode</b>
              The  file  protection  mode  that the server should set for the modem device file.  Note that this
              value is given in octal.  The default value of 0600 implies that only the facsimile user  (usually
              <u>uucp</u>) can access the modem.  See also <u><a href="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod</a></u>(2).

       <b>DialStringRules²</b>
              The  pathname  of  the  file that holds the rules for processing user-specified dial strings; c.f.
              <u><a href="../man5/dialrules.5.html">dialrules</a></u>(5).  The specified pathname must be relative to the top of  the  fax  server's  spooling
              area; e.g.  <b>etc/dialrules</b>.

       <b>DistinctiveRings</b>
              Modern  distinctive  ring  support on most modems indicates the ring cadence rather than the older
              style of ``RING1'', ``RING2'', etc.  To indicate the ring cadence, <b>DRingOn</b> and <b>DRingOff</b> values are
              presented by the modem to the <u>faxgetty</u> process.  The modem indicates the  entire  cadence  between
              ``RING'' indications Like this:

                RING
                DROF=40
                DRON=8
                DROF=4
                DRON=8
                RING

              The corresponding <b>DistinctiveRings</b> parameter for this ring cadence would be:

                DistinctiveRings:  F-8-4-8

              where  ``F''  tells the <u>faxgetty</u> process that the ring cadence is for a facsimile (``V'' for voice
              and ``D'' for data), and the other values describe  the  ring  cadence  with  leading  and  ending
              <b>DRingOff</b>  values  ignored.  Multiple ring cadences are indicated by delimiting them with commas in
              this fashion:

                DistinctiveRings:  V-20,F-8-4-8,D-4-2-4-8

       <b>DRingOff</b>
              A string that identifies the ``off'' value in any distinctive ring cadence, for example ``DROF=''.
              See also <b>DRingOn</b> and <b>DistinctiveRings</b>.

       <b>DRingOn</b>
              A string that identifies the ``on'' value in any distinctive ring cadence, for example  ``DRON=''.
              See also <b>DRingOff</b> and <b>DistinctiveRings</b>.

       <b>DynamicConfig</b>
              The  pathname  of  the  optional  program,  e.g. ``etc/localid'', that makes dynamic configuration
              changes, i.e., to <b>LocalIdentifier,</b> based on device ID and call  identification.   The  program  is
              passed  those  values as the parameters ($1 = device id, $2 = CallID1, $3 = CallID2, $4 = CallID3,
              ...), when answering an incoming call.  The program can then perform local processing  as  desired
              to send on standard output the configuration items to change in a ``parameter:value'' format, i.e.
              ``LocalIdentifier:  +1.800.555.1212''.   If there are multiple parameters to be changed, then each
              item must be on its own line.  This is commonly used to dynamically alter the local identification
              of systems which use DID/DNIS, but it can also be used to allow different modem configurations for
              different senders.  This program can also set the <b>RejectCall</b> options to cause the current call  to
              be rejected instead of answered.  Note that this file must be marked as executable by the faxgetty
              process.

       <b>EGettyArgs</b>
              A  string  that indicates whether or not the server should use an an external getty application to
              deduce and possibly handle an incoming call.  If  the  string  value  is  not  null,  then  it  is
              interpreted  as  a set of arguments to pass to the getty program.  Before supplying the arguments,
              the string is first scanned for ``%''-escape sequences: any appearance of ``%l'' is replaced  with
              the  tty  name  and  any appearance of ``%s'' is replaced with the serial port speed (in decimal).
              Any appearance of escaped numbers 1 through 9 (``%1'' through ``%9'') are replaced by the match to
              the corresponding <b>CallIDPattern</b>, if present.  The ``%'' character can be  specified  with  ``%%''.
              If  the  <b>EGettyArgs</b> parameter is not specified in the configuration file or if the string value is
              null, then ``extern'' connections will be rejected.   Note  that  in  addition  to  the  specified
              command line arguments, the external getty program is invoked with its standard input, output, and
              error descriptors directed to the controlling tty device.

              When  the external getty application completes, its exit status is evaluated and is interpreted to
              indicate what, if anything, should be done with the call.  An exit status of  ``0''  indicates  an
              unknown  call  type  and  that the call should be handled as if the external getty program had not
              been used.  An exit status of ``1'' indicates a data connection  and  that  the  <u><a href="../man8/getty.8.html">getty</a></u>(8)  program
              should   be   used   to   handle   the   call   (see   <b>GettyArgs</b>)   after   being   answered  with
              <b>ModemAnswerDataBeginCmd</b> <b>.</b>  An exit status of ``2'' indicates  a  fax  connection  that  should  be
              handled  after  being  answered  with <b>ModemAnswerFaxBeginCmd</b>.  An exit status of ``3'' indicates a
              voice call and that the <u>vgetty</u> program should be used to handle the call  (see  <b>VGettyArgs</b>)  after
              being  answered with BR ModemAnswerVoiceBeginCmd .  An exit status of ``4'' is considered to be an
              error condition.  The session will be terminated.  An exit status of ``5''  is  used  to  indicate
              that the external getty program handled the call entirely, is not an error condition, and that the
              session is to be considered terminated.

       <b>FAXNumber</b>
              The  phone  number  associated  with  the  facsimile  modem.   This string is used to generate the
              Transmitter Subscriber Identification (TSI) and Caller Subscriber Identification (CSI) information
              passed to remote machines—unless the <b>LocalIdentifier</b> parameter is explicitly set.   The  <b>FAXNumber</b>
              is  also used to name the session log file where information for incoming phone calls is recorded;
              see <u><a href="../man5/hylafax-log.5.html">hylafax-log</a></u>(5).  If this phone number is not a fully qualified number the values  of  <b>AreaCode</b>
              and <b>CountryCode</b> are used to generate the transmitted CSI and TSI.

       <b>Include²</b>
              Include the specified file and parse it as a config file

       <b>InternationalPrefix²</b>
              The  string  to  use to place an international phone call.  In the United States, this is ``011''.
              This string is passed to the dial string rules.

       <b>JobControlCmd¹</b>
              The command to invoke to which provides Job Control information for a job. See <u><a href="../man8/JobControl.8.html">JobControl</a></u>(8).

       <b>JobReqBusy</b>
              The delay in seconds to wait before retrying a job whose dialing attempt failed  with  a  ``BUSY''
              status result.

       <b>JobReqDataConn</b>
              The  delay in seconds to wait before retrying a facsimile job whose dialing attempt failed because
              a data modem answered the phone.

       <b>JobReqError</b>
              The delay in seconds to wait before retrying a job whose dialing attempt failed with  a  ``ERROR''
              status result.

       <b>JobReqNoAnswer</b>
              The  delay  in  seconds  to  wait  before  retrying a job whose dialing attempt failed with a ``NO
              ANSWER'' status result.

       <b>JobReqNoCarrier</b>
              The delay in seconds to wait before retrying a job  whose  dialing  attempt  failed  with  a  ``NO
              CARRIER'' status result.

       <b>JobReqNoFCon</b>
              The  delay in seconds to wait before retrying a facsimile job whose dialing attempt failed because
              the initial facsimile protocol handshake failed (i.e. no ``+FCON:'' result  was  received  from  a
              Class 2/2.0 modem).

       <b>JobReqOther²</b>
              The delay in seconds to wait before retrying a job that failed for a reason not already covered by
              one of the <b>JobReq*</b> parameters.

       <b>JobReqProto</b>
              The delay in seconds to wait before retrying a facsimile job that failed because of a fax protocol
              error.

       <b>JobRetryBusy</b>
              The  number  of  times  to  redial  a phone number after receiving a ``BUSY'' result code when the
              number has not been successfully dialed before.

       <b>JobRetryDataConn</b>
              The number of times to redial a phone number after the dialing attempt failed because a data modem
              answered the phone when the number has not been successfully dialed before.

       <b>JobRetryError</b>
              The number of times to redial a phone number after receiving a  ``ERROR''  result  code  when  the
              number has not been successfully dialed before.

       <b>JobRetryNoAnswer</b>
              The number of times to redial a phone number after the dialing attempt failed because of NO ANSWER
              when the number has not been successfully dialed before.

       <b>JobRetryNoCarrier</b>
              The  number  of  times  to  redial  a  phone number after the dialing attempt failed because of NO
              CARRIER when the number has not been successfully dialed before.   In  normal  operation  the  fax
              server will treat this result code to mean that a facsimile modem/machine did not answer the phone
              and  reject  the  transmit  job.  This is done to avoid repeatedly dialing wrong phone numbers and
              depends on the modem distinguishing between no carrier and no answer.  However,  some  modems  are
              not  capable of reliably distinguishing between no carrier and no answer, or when instructed to do
              so do not identify a busy signal correctly.  For  these  modems  one  may  find  it  necessary  to
              increase  the  value  of  this parameter to compensate.  It is strongly recommended, however, that
              this value not be set to a large number.

       <b>JobRetryOther</b>
              The number of times to redial a phone number after the dialing attempt failed  for  a  reason  not
              already covered by one of the other JobRetry* parameters when the number has not been successfully
              dialed before.

       <b>GettyArgs</b>
              A  string  that indicates whether or not the server should invoke the <u><a href="../man8/getty.8.html">getty</a></u>(8) program in response
              to an incoming call from a data modem.  If the string value is not null, then it is interpreted as
              a set of arguments to pass to the getty program.  Before supplying the arguments,  the  string  is
              first  scanned  for ``%''-escape sequences: any appearance of ``%l'' is replaced with the tty name
              and any appearance of ``%s'' is replaced with the serial port speed (in decimal).  Any  appearance
              of  escaped  numbers  1  through  9  (``%1''  through  ``%9'')  are  replaced  by the match to the
              corresponding <b>CallIDPattern</b>, if present.  The ``%'' character can be specified  with  ``%%''.   If
              the <b>GettyArgs</b> parameter is not specified in the configuration file or if the string value is null,
              then  data  connections  will  be  rejected.   Note that in addition to the specified command line
              arguments, the <u>getty</u> program is invoked with its standard input,  output,  and  error  descriptors
              directed to the controlling tty device.

       <b>LocalIdentifier</b>
              The  local  station  identification  string  to  use  when  transmitting  TSI and CSI strings (see
              <b>FAXNumber</b> above).  NB: while this string may contain any printable ASCII characters;  beware  that
              CCITT T.30 specifies a restricted character set and some fax modems and machines may reject or not
              display   non-conforming  strings.   If the local identifier is not specified, a canonical form of
              the <b>FAXNumber</b> is used instead.

       <b>LockDataCalls</b>
              Hold the UUCP lockfile during the time an inbound data call is processed  by  the  external  getty
              program.   If  this is disabled then the lockfile will be removed just before the getty program is
              invoked.  Note however that doing this introduces a race condition whereby an outbound program may
              sneak in and take control of the modem after the inbound call has been accepted,  but  before  the
              getty program has started up and installed it's own lockfile.

       <b>LockVoiceCalls</b>
              Hold  the  UUCP  lockfile  during the time an inbound data call is processed by the external voice
              getty program.  If this is disabled then the lockfile will be removed just before the voice  getty
              program  is invoked.  Note however that doing this introduces a race condition whereby an outbound
              program may sneak in and take control of the modem after the inbound call has been  accepted,  but
              before the voice getty program has started up and installed it's own lockfile.

       <b>LogFacility²</b>
              The   symbolic   name  for  the  <u><a href="../man3/syslog.3.html">syslog</a></u>(3)  facility  to  use  when  logging  error  messages  and
              informational/debugging messages requested through  the  <b>ServerTracing</b>  parameter.   The  list  of
              facility names is standardized; it can be found in the system include file <b>&lt;syslog.h&gt;</b>; comparisons
              are case-insensitive.

       <b>LogCalls</b>
              Log all incoming calls into xferfaxlog as CALL records.  This allows a quick check of all incoming
              calls, regardless of fax completion or not in a unified manner with other fax logs.

       <b>LogFileMode</b>
              The  file protection mode that should be used when creating files to hold session logs.  Note that
              this value is given in octal.  The default value of 0600  implies  that  the  log  files  are  not
              generally  accessible,  which  is  important  if sensitive information such as calling card access
              codes are logged.  If log files are to be publicly accessible, this value may be set, for example,
              to 0644.  See also <u><a href="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod</a></u>(2).

       <b>LongDistancePrefix²</b>
              The string to use to place a long distance phone call.  In the United States, this is ``1''.

       <b>MaxConcurrentCalls¹</b>
              The default value to use for the maximum  number  of  jobs  for  the  same  destination  that  are
              processed  concurrently.  Thus this parameter defines the maximum number of concurrent phone calls
              to the same destination.  Unless all of your fax destinations have multiple fax  lines  using  the
              same  fax number per destination then <b>MaxConcurrentCalls</b> is probably best left as the default of 1
              and exceptions should be accommodated by the <b>JobControl</b> mechanism.

       <b>MaxBatchJobs¹</b>
              The maximum number of jobs to batch together in a single call.

       <b>MaxConsecutiveBadLines</b>
              The maximum number of consecutive erroneous rows of image data that the server will receive before
              it deems a page to have unacceptable copy quality.  Setting this  parameter  to  zero  causes  the
              server  to  not check the quality of received facsimile.  Facsimile received with error-correction
              do not have copy quality checking performed.  See also <b>PercentGoodLines</b>.

       <b>MaxDials¹</b>
              The default value for the maximum number of times the server will place a  call  for  an  outbound
              job.  This value may be overridden by rules in the <b>JobControl</b> mechanism.  See also <b>MaxTries</b>.

       <b>MaxRecvPages</b>
              The  maximum  number  of pages the server will accept in a received facsimile before it aborts the
              session.

       <b>MaxSendPages¹</b>
              The default value for the maximum number  of  pages  the  server  will  permit  in  a  transmitted
              facsimile.   Outbound  jobs  that exceed this limit are rejected.  This value may be overridden by
              rules in the <b>JobControl</b> mechanism.

       <b>MaxSetupAttempts</b>
              The maximum number of times a <u>HylaFAX</u> server program will attempt to  initialize  a  modem  before
              considering it ``<u>wedged</u>''.

       <b>MaxTries¹</b>
              The  default  value  for the maximum number of times the server will attempt to communicate with a
              remote site.  Note that for a call to be counted against this limit, carrier must be  established;
              this  is in contrast to the value of <b>MaxDials</b> which limits the number of calls that will be placed
              on behalf of a job.  This value may be overridden by rules in the <b>JobControl</b> mechanism.  See  also
              <b>MaxDials</b>.

       <b>MinAcceptedLineCount</b>
              The  minimum  number  of  received  scanlines  allowed on an ``OK'' page.  The use of this setting
              prevents confirmation from being sent for very short pages.

       <b>ModemGroup¹</b>
              Define a logical name for a set of modem devices.  This parameter can be used  to  define  a  name
              that  clients  can  use to refer to a collection of modems.  The syntax is ``<u>&lt;name&gt;&lt;regex&gt;</u>'' where
              <u>&lt;name&gt;</u> is the name for the group and <u>&lt;regex&gt;</u> is a regular expression that <u><a href="../man8/faxq.8.html">faxq</a></u>(8) matches  against
              known  modems.   Thus  for  example,  the  default  modem  to  use  for  a job, <b>any</b>, is defined as
              ``any:.*''.  This parameter may be specified multiple times  to  define  multiple  modem  classes.
              Modem  classes may overlap.  The actual set of modems in a modem class that are considered for use
              may vary based on which modems are believed to be ready for use.

       <b>ModemPriority</b>
              The scheduling priority to use for a modem.  Priority values are in the range 0 to 255 with lesser
              values signifying higher (more desirable) priority.  The <u>HylaFAX</u>  scheduler  process  assigns  the
              highest priority modem that is ready for use when scheduling an outbound job.

              If  multiple  available  modems  in a job's selected <b>ModemGroup</b> have the same <b>ModemPriority</b> value,
              then the <u>HylaFAX</u> scheduler assigns jobs to them in a round-robin fashion.

       <b>NoAnswerVoice</b>
              Whether or not to disable the answering of calls indicated as voice (e.g. by <b>DistinctiveRings</b> ).

       <b>NoCarrierRetrys</b>
              This is mapped onto JobRetryNoCarrier

       <b>ModemReadyState</b>
              Define the <u>state</u> transmitted to the <u>HylaFAX</u> scheduler process each time a modem is made ready by a
              <u>faxgetty</u> process.  State is one of: ``R'' (ready for use), ``B'' (busy),  or  ``D''  (down).   The
              modem state can be used to control whether or not modems are assigned to outbound jobs.  A modem's
              state  is  initially  set  to  ``R''  (ready).   Modem  state  can be dynamically changed with the
              <u><a href="../man8/faxstate.8.html">faxstate</a></u>(8) program or by setting this configuration parameter with the <u><a href="../man8/faxconfig.8.html">faxconfig</a></u>(8) program.

       <b>ModemRingResponse</b>
              This can be used to cause the command defined by <b>ModemRingResponse</b> to be sent to the  modem  after
              hearing at least <b>ModemRingsBeforeResponse</b> RINGs in order to receive DID-DTMF data, for example.

       <b>ModemRingsBeforeResponse</b>
              This defines the minimum number of RINGs that must be heard before <b>ModemRingResponse</b> is first sent
              to the modem.

       <b>NotifyCmd²</b>
              The command to invoke to notify a client of a job status change; see <u><a href="../man8/notify.8.html">notify</a></u>(8).

       <b>PageChop¹</b>
              Whether  or not to automatically truncate trailing whitespace on pages of outbound facsimile (when
              possible).  If page chopping is enabled, then  pages  with  at  least  <b>PageChopThreshold</b>  trailing
              whitespace  on  a  page  will  be  transmitted  as  a ``short page'' if the receiver is capable of
              accepting variable-length pages.  The possible values are: ``last'' to enable chopping of the last
              page of each document, ``all'' to enable chopping of  all  pages,  or  ``none''  to  disable  page
              chopping.

       <b>PageChopThreshold¹</b>
              The minimum amount of trailing whitespace that must be present on a page before page chopping will
              be attempted; see <b>PageChop</b>.  Note that this value is specified in inches.

       <b>PCL2FaxCmd¹</b>
              The  command to invoke to convert a HP-PCL document submitted for transmission to TIFF/F, suitable
              for transmission.

       <b>PercentGoodLines</b>
              The minimum percentage of good rows of image data required for a received  facsimile  page  to  be
              deemed  to  have acceptable copy quality.  Setting this parameter to zero causes the server to not
              check the quality of received facsimile.  Facsimile received with  error-correction  do  not  have
              copy quality checking performed.  See also <b>MaxConsecutiveBadLines</b>.

       <b>PollLockPokeModem</b>
              When  polling  for  the  presence/removal  of a UUCP lockfile, also test to make sure the modem is
              still reachable.  This is useful for scenarios where the modem is apt to become disconnected while
              the modem is idle, such as an external modem that may lose power, where  the  administrator  wants
              notification of this (as a ``wedged'' condition).

       <b>PollLockWait</b>
              When  polling  for  the presence/removal of a UUCP lockfile, the time (in seconds) to wait between
              checks.  Lockfile polling occurs to ensure the fax server doesn't  collide  with  another  process
              using the modem.

       <b>PollModemWait</b>
              The  time  (in seconds) to wait between checks for a modem to become ready for use.  Modem polling
              occurs when a modem fails to reset cleanly.

       <b>PriorityScheduling</b>
              Indicates  whether  the  <u>HylaFAX</u>  scheduler  should  utilize  available  priority  job  scheduling
              mechanisms  to  enhance  realtime  execution, particularly with Class 1 configurations on older or
              slower systems.

              Currently <b>PriorityScheduling</b> is available for IRIX, SVR/4, HP-UX, and POSIX-compliant (i.e. Linux)
              operating systems.  The default value varies to maintain traditional <u>HylaFAX</u> behavior.   On  IRIX,
              SVR/4,  and  HP-UX  systems  where  the  configure script detects one of the functions schedctl(),
              priocntl() or rtprio() the default is true.  The only other supported priority mechanism is  POSIX
              sched_setscheduler(),  which  is  used  on  Linux, OpenServer and possibly other systems.  On such
              systems, as well as on systems where no priority  scheduling  mechanism  exists,  the  default  is
              false."

       <b>PS2FaxCmd¹</b>
              The  command  to  invoke  to  convert  a POSTSCRIPT document submitted for transmission to TIFF/F,
              suitable for transmission; see <u><a href="../man8/ps2fax.8.html">ps2fax</a></u>(8).

       <b>QualifyPWD</b>
              A string that specifies whether or not the  identity  of  calling  facsimile  machines  should  be
              checked  against  an  access  control list before receiving facsimile.  If <b>QualifyPWD</b> is non-null,
              then only messages from facsimile  machines  identified  in  the  file  specified  by  the  string
              (typically <b>etc/passwd</b>) will be accepted; similar to <b>QualifyTSI.</b>

       <b>QualifyTSI</b>
              A  string  that  specifies  whether  or  not  the identity of calling facsimile machines should be
              checked against an access control list before receiving facsimile.   If  <b>QualifyTSI</b>  is  non-null,
              then  only  messages  from  facsimile  machines  identified  in  the  file specified by the string
              (typically <b>etc/tsi</b>) will be  accepted;  see  <u><a href="../man5/tsi.5.html">tsi</a></u>(5).   If  <b>QualifyTSI</b>  is  not  specified  in  the
              configuration file, or the value is null, then all incoming facsimile messages will be accepted.

       <b>RecvDataFormat</b>
              The  data  format (compression scheme) to write received facsimile data when copy quality checking
              is performed on the host.  (When copy quality checking is not done by the server, for example when
              error correction protocol is used, the received  facsimile  data  is  written  exactly  as  it  is
              received  from  the  modem.)   The  format  may  be  one:  ``1-D MH'', ``2-D MR'', ``2-D MMR'', or
              ``adaptive''.  An ``adaptive'' format causes the received data to be written using the data format
              negotiated by the sender and receiver.  Note that while 2-D MMR is the most  space-efficient  data
              format the resultant file may not be viewable (certain commonly used programs do not properly read
              multi-strip TIFF with 2-D MMR data).

       <b>RecvFileMode</b>
              The file protection mode that should be used when creating files to hold incoming facsimile.  Note
              that this value is given in octal.  The default value of 0600 implies that only the facsimile user
              can  read received facsimile.  If incoming facsimile are to be publicly accessible, this value may
              be set, for example, to 0644.  See also <u><a href="../man2/chmod.2.html">chmod</a></u>(2).

       <b>RejectCall</b>
              If this is set to true, the current call will not be answered, and will be rejected.  This  option
              has  no  effect  if  set  in  the  configuration  file, but when set by the <b>DynamicConfig</b> program,
              controls the current call.  This options supersedes the obsolete <b>QualifyCID</b> option.

       <b>RingData</b>
              A modem status string that identifies that an incoming call is for data use.  This  string  should
              be  set  when  a  phone  line  has been setup with <u>distinctive</u> <u>ring</u> service.  See also <b>RingFax</b> and
              <b>RingVoice</b>.

       <b>RingExtended</b>
              An identifier which matches the initial portion of an extended RING message sent by the  modem  to
              relay CID and/or DNIS data instead of sending it formatted on separate lines.

       <b>RingFax</b>
              A  modem  status  string  that identifies that an incoming call is for facsimile use.  This string
              should be set when a phone line has been setup with <u>distinctive</u> <u>ring</u> service.  See  also  <b>RingData</b>
              and <b>RingVoice</b>.

       <b>RingsBeforeAnswer</b>
              The number of rings to wait before answering the phone.  If this value is set to 0, then the phone
              will only be answered in response to an explicit answer command; see <u><a href="../man8/faxanswer.8.html">faxanswer</a></u>(8).

       <b>RingTimeout</b>
              If  a ring is heard and the call is not answered, the time in ms to wait before reinitializing the
              modem for the next call.

       <b>RingVoice</b>
              A modem status string that identifies that an incoming call is for voice use.  This string  should
              be  set  when  a  phone  line has been setup with <u>distinctive</u> <u>ring</u> service.  See also <b>RingData</b> and
              <b>RingFax</b>.

       <b>RTNHandlingMethod</b>
              Specifies how to react to  an  RTN  signal  received  from  the  remote:  one  of  ``Retransmit'',
              ``Giveup'',``Ignore'', or ``Retransmit-Ignore''.

              ``Retransmit''  assumes  that  the page is not received successfully.  HylaFAX will make up to two
              additional attempts to  send  the  page,  decreasing  signalling  rate  and  retraining.   If  RTN
              continues,  up  to  2  additional calls will be placed.  The downside is that if the remote always
              responds with RTN, the page will be sent 9 times and no following pages will be  sent.   Many  fax
              machines will not behave this way, although T.30 specification seems clear that this is the intent
              of the RTN signal.

              Many  fax machines will interpret RTN as meaning to not send the same data again.  That is because
              RTN may indicate problems with flow control, incorrectly encoded T.4 data, or some incompatibility
              other than line noise.  Fax machines that interpret RTN this way will  disconnect  and  require  a
              manual  retransmission.  This ``over and out'' behaviour can be activated by the ``Giveup'' value.
              The advantage to this behavior is that the same page of image  data  will  not  be  sent  multiple
              times, but the downside is that the following pages will not be sent.

              ``Ignore''  is  similar  to  ``Giveup''  in  that  it  makes  the  assumption  the  data cannot be
              automatically accepted by the receiver.  However, rather than disconnecting the page of image data
              is abandoned and processing moves on to the next.  The remote is left to decide what  to  do  with
              the unacceptable page of image data.  The downside to this behavior, is that the remote may or may
              not  have  kept the page, depending on its interpretation of the RTN signal - but it does allow us
              to continue on to the next page.

              ``Retransmit-Ignore'' is a combination of ``Retransmit'' and ``Ignore''.  The page of  image  data
              is  retransmitted  up  to  two  additional  times, but rather than disconnecting after a third RTN
              signal for the same page, processing then continues on to the next  page.   This  approach  is  an
              effort  to  satisfy  both  interpretations  of an RTN signal.  It allows the receiver to hopefully
              receive a better copy of the image data while not  failing  to  send  subsequent  pages.   If  the
              receiver  saves  or prints a copy of pages for which it transmits RTN, then it could save or print
              up to three copies of every page.

       <b>SaveUnconfirmedPages</b>
              Whether or not to save a received facsimile image page if the sender disconnects  without  sending
              the  post-page message, without hearing our message confirmation, without retraining as requested,
              or otherwise breaks fax protocol following such pages for which  the  sender  should  not  have  a
              ``receipt confirmation''.

       <b>SendFaxCmd¹</b>
              The command to use to process outbound facsimile jobs; see <u><a href="../man8/faxsend.8.html">faxsend</a></u>(8).

              The command to use to process outbound UUCP jobs.  This parameter is not currently used, it is for
              future development.

       <b>ServerTracing²</b>
              A number that controls the generation of tracing information by a server when not actively sending
              or  receiving  facsimile.   Tracing  is  divided  into <u>areas</u> that are individually controlled.  To
              enable tracing of multiple areas of operation, the flag associated with each area should  be  bit-
              or'd to form the value for this tag.

              of the logged messages.

       <b>SessionTracing²</b>
              A  number  that  controls  the  generation  of  tracing  information  by a server while sending or

       <b>SpeakerVolume</b>
              The  volume  level  that  the  in-modem  speaker should be adjusted to while in command mode.  The
              possible values are:
              <b>Value</b>     <b>Description</b>
              Off       silent
              Quiet     almost inaudible
              Low       tolerable in privacy
              Medium    loud enough to hear in the next room
              High      intolerable
              Note that the speaker is always turned off once carrier is established.   Also  beware  that  some
              modems support fewer volume settings; see <b>ModemSetVolumeCmd</b>.

       <b>TagLineCoverNumString</b>

              Setting  TagLineCoverNumString instructs faxsend to not include the cover pages in the normal page
              numbering mechanism.  The page numbers used in the tagline generation will adjusted to  not  count
              the  cover  pages, and the TagLineCoverNumString value wil be used instead of a page number on the
              tagline of the cover page.

       <b>TagLineFont</b>
              The filename of the font to use in imaging <u>tag</u> <u>lines</u> across the  top  of  each  transmitted  page.
              Fonts  must  be  stored  in the Portable Compiled Font (PCF) format used by the X11 Window System.
              Filenames are specified relative to the root of the spooling area; e.g.  etc/lutRS18.pcf.   If  no
              font is specified, if a null filename is specified, or if the specified font file is not readable,
              then tag lines will not be generated.  See also <b>TagLineFormat</b>.

       <b>TagLineFormat</b>
              The  format  string  to  use when imaging <u>tag</u> <u>lines</u> across the top of each transmitted page.  This
              string may include escape codes that cause various items to be interpolated into  the  imaged  tag
              line.   Any  escape  code  supported  by <u><a href="../man3C/strftime.3C.html">strftime</a></u>(3C) may be used as well as the following server-
              implemented codes:
              <b>Escape</b>    <b>Description</b>
              %%a       destination subaddress
              %%c       destination company name

              %%d       destination phone number
              %%g       destination geographic location
              %%G       sender's geographic location
              %%i       job identifier
              %%I       group identifier
              %%j       user-specified job tag
              %%l       <b>LocalIdentifier</b> or canonicalized <b>FAXNumber</b>
              %%m       sender's electronic mail address
              %%n       canonicalized <b>FAXNumber</b>
              %%p       current page number of session
              %%P       current page number of job
              %%r       receiver's name
              %%s       sender's name
              %%S       subject
              %%t       total pages in session
              %%T       total pages in job
              %%v       destination voice number
              %%V       sender's voice number
              %%%       ``%''
              In addition, the format string may indicate that text is to be centered  in  multiple  equal-sized
              <u>fields</u>  by separating text with ``|'' characters.  For example, ``a|b|c'' would cause the tag line
              to be broken up into three equal-sized areas with the strings ``a'',  ``b'',  and  ``c''  centered
              within  each  region.  The default tag line format string is ``From %%n|%c|Page %%P of %%T''.  The
              differences between the %%p or %%P and the %%t or %%T options  are  noticed  when  a  fax  job  is
              retried  after  an  incomplete  attempt  and only the previously unsent pages are then queued in a
              successive session.  See also <b>TagLineFont</b>.

       <b>TIFF2FaxCmd¹</b>
              The command to invoke to convert a  TIFF  submitted  for  transmission  to  TIFF/F,  suitable  for
              transmission; see <u><a href="../man8/tiff2fax.8.html">tiff2fax</a></u>(8).

       <b>TimeOfDay¹</b>
              The  default  time-of-day restrictions to apply to outbound jobs.  Outbound jobs will be processed
              only during the specified time.  Any jobs submitted outside this time period will  be  held  until
              the start of this time.  The syntax for time-of-day restrictions is designed to be compatible with
              the syntax used by the UUCP software.  The following BNF describes the syntax:
                 Syntax = tod ["," tod]
                    tod = &lt;days&gt;&lt;timerange&gt;
                   days = "Any" | "Wk" | &lt;dayname&gt;+ | nothing
                dayname = "Sun" | "Mon" | "Tue" | "Wed" | "Thu" | "Fri" | "Sat"
              timerange = &lt;start&gt; "-" &lt;end&gt; | nothing
                  start = &lt;24hrtime&gt;
                    end = &lt;24hrtime&gt;
               24hrtime = {0-9}{0-9}{0-9}{0-9}
                nothing =
              where  <u>start</u> and <u>end</u> are 24-hour times, day names can be either 2- or 3-characters, and a null day
              or time specification means any time or day.  White space and other syntactic sugar may be  freely
              inserted between tokens but may not be inserted between 24-hour times in the time range.

              This value may be overridden by rules in the <b>JobControl</b> mechanism.

       <b>Use2D¹</b> Control the use of 2D-encoded data for transmitted facsimile.

       <b>UseJobTagLine</b>
              Allow the use of the job-specified tagline instead of the configured <b>TaglineFormat</b>

       <b>UUCPLockMode²</b>
              The  file  protection mode that should be used when creating UUCP lockfiles.  Note that this value
              is given in octal.

       <b>UUCPLockDir²</b>
              The pathname of the directory in which UUCP lockfiles are to be created.

       <b>UUCPLockTimeout²</b>
              The time in seconds to wait before removing a <u>stale</u> UUCP lockfile (i.e.  a  lockfile  whose  owner
              does  not  appear  to  exist).  If this value is set to 0, then the fax server will never remove a
              stale lockfile.

       <b>UUCPLockType²</b>
              A string that specifies the type of UUCP lockfile to create.  The string may be one  of  ``ascii''
              or  ``binary''  depending on whether the process-ID of the lock owner is written to the file as an
              ascii string or as a binary value, respectively.  In addition, two prefixes may be used to control
              the format of the lock filename.  If the type string is prefixed with  a  ``+'',  then  SVR4-style
              filenames  are  generated  using the major device number of the tty device and the major and minor
              device numbers for the filesystem on which the tty device resides.  If the type string is prefixed
              with a ``-'', then any upper case letters in the device part of the lockfile name are converted to
              lower case letters; for example, ``LCK..ttyA01'' is converted to ``LCK..ttya01''.  This  upper-to-
              lower  case  conversion  is useful for systems such as SCO where the convention is to name devices
              with upper-case letters, but create lockfiles with lower-case letters.

       <b>VGettyArgs</b>
              A string that indicates whether or not the server should invoke a voice getty program in  response
              to  an  incoming  voice call.  If the string value is not null, then it is interpreted as a set of
              arguments to pass to the <u>vgetty</u> program.  Before supplying the  arguments,  the  string  is  first
              scanned for ``%''-escape sequences: any appearance of ``%l'' is replaced with the tty name and any
              appearance  of  ``%s''  is  replaced  with  the serial port speed (in decimal).  Any appearance of
              escaped numbers 1 through 9 (``%1'' through ``%9'') are replaced by the match to the corresponding
              <b>CallIDPattern</b>, if present.  The ``%'' character can be specified with ``%%''.  If  the  <b>VGettyArgs</b>
              parameter  is  not  specified in the configuration file or if the string value is null, then voice
              connections will be rejected.  Note that in addition to the specified command line arguments,  the
              <u>vgetty</u>  program  is invoked with its standard input, output, and error descriptors directed to the
              controlling tty device.

       <b>WedgedCmd¹</b>
              The command to invoke when a modem is deemed ``<u>wedged</u>''; see <u><a href="../man8/wedged.8.html">wedged</a></u>(8).

</pre><h4><b>MODEM-ORIENTED</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       This section lists configuration parameters that are specific to the setup and operation  of  the  modem.
       All  <u>commands</u>  must  be specified exactly as they are to be transmitted to the modem (note that this is a
       departure from previous versions of this software that automatically prepended ``AT''  to  each  line  of
       commands  sent to the modem).  When multi-line commands are required, enclose the commands in quote marks
       (``"'') and insert a newline character ``\n'' where lines should be broken.  An example of  a  multi-line
       command string is ``AT+FCQ=1\nAT+FBADMUL=20\nAT+FBADLIN=10''.

       Command  strings  sent  to the modem may include command escapes that force the host to alter the DTE-DCE
       communication rate, the flow control scheme used between the host and modem, delay for a period of  time,
       flush  input  data,  and  wait  for  a  specific response from the modem.  The following escape codes are
       interpreted:
              <b>Escape</b>             <b>Effect</b>
              &lt;none&gt;             enable no flow control between DTE and DCE
              &lt;xon&gt;              enable software flow control between DTE and DCE
              &lt;rts&gt;              enable hardware flow control between DTE and DCE
              &lt;2400&gt;             set the DCE-DTE baud rate to 2400 bps
              &lt;4800&gt;             set the DCE-DTE baud rate to 4800 bps
              &lt;9600&gt;             set the DCE-DTE baud rate to 9600 bps
              &lt;19200&gt;            set the DCE-DTE baud rate to 19200 bps
              &lt;38400&gt;            set the DCE-DTE baud rate to 38400 bps
              &lt;57600&gt;            set the DCE-DTE baud rate to 57600 bps
              &lt;76800&gt;            set the DCE-DTE baud rate to 76800 bps
              &lt;115200&gt;           set the DCE-DTE baud rate to 115200 bps
              &lt;delay:N&gt;          delay N x 10 ms on the host (0 &lt;= N &lt;= 255)
              &lt;flush&gt;            flush any pending input data from the modem
              &lt;waitfor:R&gt;        wait for the response R from the modem (see below)
              &lt;play:filename&gt;    play the specified audio file (see below)
       Note that commands to the left of an escape code are sent to the modem before the associated actions  are
       carried  out  on  the  host.   This  may be important when changing baud rates, as the result code from a
       command may be returned at the new baud rate.  Also, beware that not all baud rates are supported by  all
       systems and modems; the set of baud rates supported by a host is usually listed in <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1).

       The  ``&lt;waitfor:..&gt;'' escape can be used to override the default behaviour which is to wait for an ``OK''
       response to a command sent to the modem.  The possible response codes are:
              NOTHING       a null response
              OK            the default response
              CONNECT       ``CONNECT...''
              NOANSWER      ``NO ANSWER...''
              NOCARRIER     ``NO CARRIER...''
              NODIALTONE    ``NO DIALTONE...''
              BUSY          ``BUSY''
              OFFHOOK       ``PHONE OFF-HOOK''
              RING          ``RING...''
              ERROR         error status from modem
              VCON          voice connection indicator
              OTHER         any unrecognized modem response
       For example ``ATO\r&lt;waitfor:CONNECT&gt;'' would send ``ATO\r'' to the modem and then  wait  for  a  response
       with   a  leading  ``CONNECT''  in  it;  and  ``ATS99=2\r&lt;delay:2&gt;&lt;flush&gt;&lt;waitfor:NOTHING&gt;''  would  send
       ``ATS99=2\r'' to the modem, delay 20 ms, flush any input from the modem, and then continue (not wait  for
       any response).

       The  ``&lt;play:filename&gt;''  escape  can be used to play a raw audio file with a voice modem.   This feature
       can be used, for example, to play a brief audio message after picking up the line but  before  answering.
       A configuration example may be:

         ModemRingResponse:  "AT+FCLASS=8;H1\nAT+VSM=131\nAT+VLS=1\nAT+VTX\n&lt;waitfor:CONNECT&gt;&lt;play:/sounds/enter-extension.raw&gt;&lt;waitfor:OK&gt;AT+VTS=[933,,150]"
         ModemAnswerCmd:     "&lt;delay:100&gt;AT+FCLASS=1;A"
         CallIDPattern:      SHIELDED_DTMF
         CallIDAnswerLength: 4

       In  this  example  using an IS-101 voice-compliant modem, a RING indication from the modem will cause the
       modem to be placed in voice mode, set ulaw audio compression, and via the connected phone line play  back
       the etc/play1.raw audio file, which may say, "After the tone enter a four-digit extension, then start the
       fax."  Following the message a tone is played.

       <b>ModemAnswerCmd</b>
              The  command  to answer the phone.  If possible, this command should generate a result string that
              identifies whether the incoming call is from a facsimile, voice, or data  modem.   Typically  this
              auto-detection  is  configured  ahead  of  time;  e.g.   for  Class 2 modems with the ``AT+FAA=1''
              command.

              The following table describes how the result codes are interpreted by the facsimile server.
              <b>Result</b> <b>String</b>    <b>Default</b>          <b>Class</b> <b>1</b>      <b>Class</b> <b>2</b>      <b>Class2.0</b>

              The ``Default'' column indicates the interpretation made for the result string in either  class  1
              or  2  unless  explicitly  overridden.   The  ``Class  1'' column indicates result strings handled
              specially for modems operating in class 1, the ``Class 2'' column indicates special  handling  for
              modems  operating  in  class 2, and the ``Class 2.0'' column indicates special handling for modems
              operating in class 2.0.  <u>Unknown</u> entries imply that interpretation is based on the  way  in  which
              the  call  was  answered;  if  answering  is done for an explicit call type, that type is assumed,
              otherwise a Fax call is presumed.

       <b>ModemAnswerDataBeginCmd</b>
              The command to send to the modem once a data connection has been established.

       <b>ModemAnswerDataCmd</b>
              The command to explicitly answer the phone for a data connection.  This command  must  generate  a
              result  string  that  identifies the incoming call is from a data modem.  If this parameter is not
              specified or is null, then the value of <b>ModemAnswerCmd</b> is used instead.  See  also  <b>AdaptiveAnswer</b>
              and <b>AnswerRotary</b>.

       <b>ModemAnswerDialCmd</b>
              The  command to explicitly answer the phone for a dialed connection.  This command must generate a
              result string that identifies the incoming call is from a facsimile modem.  If this  parameter  is
              not specified or is null, then the value of <b>ModemAnswerCmd</b> is used instead.

       <b>ModemAnswerFaxBeginCmd</b>
              The command to send to the modem once a facsimile connection has been established.

       <b>ModemAnswerFaxCmd</b>
              The command to explicitly answer the phone for a facsimile connection.  This command must generate
              a result string that identifies the incoming call is from a facsimile modem.  If this parameter is
              not  specified  or  is  null,  then  the  value  of  <b>ModemAnswerCmd</b>  is  used  instead.   See also
              <b>AdaptiveAnswer</b> and <b>AnswerRotary</b>.

       <b>ModemAnswerVoiceBeginCmd</b>
              The command to send to the modem once a voice connection has been established.

       <b>ModemAnswerVoiceCmd</b>
              The command to explicitly answer the phone for a voice connection.  This command must  generate  a
              result  string that identifies the incoming call is for voice.  If this parameter is not specified
              or is null, then the value of  <b>ModemAnswerCmd</b>  is  used  instead.   See  also  <b>AdaptiveAnswer</b>  and
              <b>AnswerRotary</b>.

       <b>ModemAnswerResponseTimeout</b>
              The  maximum  time,  in  milliseconds,  to  wait  for  a  response  from  the  modem after sending
              <b>ModemAnswerCmd</b>.  Note that you may want to shorten this value when using the server-based adaptive
              answer strategy; see <b>AdaptiveAnswer</b>.

       <b>ModemATCmdDelay</b>
              A delay, in milliseconds, that should be performed before each ``AT'' command string  is  sent  to
              the modem.

       <b>ModemBaudRateDelay</b>
              The  amount  of  time,  in  milliseconds, to pause after setting the baud rate on the serial line.
              This is only needed for hosts and modems (such as USRs) where setting the serial  line  parameters
              does not take effect immediately.

       <b>ModemCommaPauseTimeCmd</b>
              The  command  to  set  the time, in seconds, that the modem should pause when encountering a ``,''
              modifier in the dialing string.

       <b>ModemDialCmd</b>
              The command to place a phone call.  The string is assumed to be suitable for use as a parameter to
              the <u><a href="../man3S/sprintf.3S.html">sprintf</a></u>(3S) function; so the ``%'' character should be escaped as ``%%''.   The  dial  command
              must  include  a  single  ``%s''  where  the  number  that  is  to be dialed is to be substituted.
              Facilities such as tone or pulse dialing, outgoing prefixes to route  though  a  PBX,  and  so  on
              should  be  included  in  the  dialing  command string.  It is also important that, if possible, a
              trailing ``@'' symbol should be included so that the modem returns result codes  that  distinguish
              between  no  answer and no carrier.  Use of the ``@'' permits the server to reduce the probability
              that a wrong number is continually redialed.  If the modem does not support this facility, then it
              may be necessary to raise the number of retries done when a ``NO CARRIER'' result is returned.

       <b>ModemDialResponseTimeout</b>
              The maximum time to wait, in milliseconds, for a response from the modem after sending This  value
              should  be  longer  than  the  timeout  programmed  into  the  modem  through the <b>ModemWaitTimeCmd</b>
              parameter.  This additional server-based timeout is provided to  guard  against  modems  that  can
              ``lock up'' when dialing the telephone.

       <b>ModemDoPhaseCDebug</b>
              Whether  or  not  to  query  the modem for responses during image data transmission.  Normally the
              modem should not produce any responses  during  Phase  C  data  transmission.   However,  in  some
              debugging  scenarios  (i.e.  some  Class  2.1  modems  may  show  debugging information) it may be
              appropriate to query the modem for responses during the data transmission.

       <b>ModemDTRDropDelay</b>
              The time, in milliseconds, to pause between placing DTR OFF and DTR ON while  resetting  a  modem.
              This value should be at least equal to the time-value of the analogous S-register, usually S25.

       <b>ModemEchoOffCmd</b>
              The command to disable echoing of commands sent to the modem.

       <b>ModemFlowControl</b>
              The  type of flow control to use between DTE and DCE; one of ``NONE'', ``XONXOFF'' and ``RTSCTS''.
              This value is used to select the string sent to the modem  to  initially  establish  DTE-DCE  flow
              control;  one of <b>ModemNoFlowCmd</b>, <b>ModemSoftFlowCmd</b>, and <b>ModemHardFlowCmd</b>.  The current flow control
              setting is also used to select the appropriate flow control command to send to the modem when  the
              software  switches  to  Class  1,  2,  or  2.0;  see  <b>Class1HFLOCmd</b>, <b>Class1NFLOCmd</b>, <b>Class1SFLOCmd</b>,
              <b>Class2HFLOCmd</b>, <b>Class2NFLOCmd</b>, and <b>Class2SFLOCmd</b>.

              The server supports both software and hardware flow control for Class 1, Class 2,  and  Class  2.0
              modems.  Whether to use hardware or software flow control depends on the capabilities of the modem
              and  the  host  hardware  and operating system.  Communication rates above 9600 baud often require
              that hardware flow control be used for reliable DTE-DCE communication.  However, beware that  many
              modems only support software flow control when sending or receiving facsimile.

              Note that modems usually support software flow control even if they have no explicit AT-command to
              activate  it;  in this case it is switched on when the modem enters fax mode, having AT+FCLASS=...
              from DTE.

       <b>ModemFrameFillOrder</b>
              The bit order to expect for received HDLC frames and to use when formulating HDLC frames to  send.
              This  value  may  be  either  LSB2MSB  when  bits  are ordered from least-significant-bit to most-
              significant-bit (as in the CCITT specification) or MSB2LSB when bits are ordered  in  the  reverse
              direction.

       <b>ModemHardFlowCmd</b>
              The command to setup hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control between DTE and DCE.

       <b>ModemMinSpeed</b>
              The minimum acceptable signalling rate for transmitting facsimile page data.  Possible values are:
              2400, 4800, 7200, 9600, 12200, and 14400.

       <b>ModemMfrQueryCmd</b>
              The command to send to the modem to get the manufacturer identification string.  If this parameter
              is not set, then it is initialized to ``AT+FMFR?'' for Class 2 modems, or to ``AT+FMI?'' for Class
              2.0  modems,  or  to  ``ATI3'' for Class 1 modems.  If the parameter begins with a ``!'', then the
              remainder of the string is taken to be the identification string and no command is issued  to  the
              modem.

       <b>ModemModelQueryCmd</b>
              The command to send to the modem to get the model identification string.  If this parameter is not
              set, then it is initialized to to ``AT+FMDL?'' for Class 2 modems, or to ``AT+FMM?'' for Class 2.0
              modems,  or  to  ``ATI0''  for  Class  1  modems.   If the parameter begins with a ``!'', then the
              remainder of the string is taken to be the identification string and no command is issued  to  the
              modem.

       <b>ModemNoAutoAnswerCmd</b>
              The command to stop the modem from automatically answering when the phone rings.

       <b>ModemNoAutoAnswerCmdDelay</b>
              The  time,  in milliseconds, to pause after receiving the OK following <b>ModemNoAutoAnswerCmd</b> before
              any further commands are sent to the modem.  All input from the modem is flushed after pausing.

       <b>ModemNoFlowCmd</b>
              The command to disable flow control between DTE and DCE.

       <b>ModemOnHookCmd</b>
              The command to place the phone ``on hook'' (i.e. hangup).

       <b>ModemPageDoneTimeout</b>
              The maximum time to wait, in milliseconds, for a response from the modem after sending a  page  of
              facsimile data (e.g.  the time to wait for a response to a Class 2/2.0 AT+FET command).

       <b>ModemPageStartTimeout</b>
              The  maximum  time to wait, in milliseconds, for an initial response from the modem when sending a
              page of facsimile data (e.g. the time to wait for a response to a Class 2/2.0 AT+FDR command).

       <b>ModemRaiseATCommands</b>
              Indicates whether or not all configuration AT commands for the modem should be  raised  to  upper-
              case  automatically.   The  standard  is for all upper-case to be used in AT commands, and indeed,
              some rare modems have been known to malfunction with lower-case commands.  However,  sometimes  an
              administrator may want to use lower-case commands in a rare condition such as to work around modem
              blacklisting of dialed numbers.

       <b>ModemRate</b>
              The  baud  rate to use for DCE-DTE communication.  This value may be one of: 115200, 76800, 57600,
              38400, 19200, 9600, 4800, 2400, 1200.  The default value is 19200 because  many  modems  lock  the
              rate  at 19200 when sending or receiving facsimile.  Note that not all values are supported by all
              operating systems and modems; consult <u><a href="../man1/stty.1.html">stty</a></u>(1) for the available rates on your system.

       <b>ModemReadyCmds</b>
              A string of commands to issue to the modem during reception initialization.  This string  is  sent
              to the modem <u>after</u> the standard set of configuration commands required by the fax server.  This is
              done, for example, to un-busy a DID line so that calls can come through.

       <b>ModemRecvFillOrder</b>
              The  bit  order to expect for received facsimile data.  This value may be either LSB2MSB when bits
              are ordered from least-significant-bit to most-significant-bit (as in the CCITT specification)  or
              MSB2LSB  when  bits are ordered in the reverse direction.  According to the various specifications
              all modems should return data in LSB2MSB order.  However most Class 2 modems  (except  maybe  only
              Multitech)   use   MSB2LSB   for   compatibility   with  modems  that  were  built  with  Rockwell
              hardware/firmware that included a bug that was too widespread to correct.

              If this parameter is not set, then it is autodetected and set to LSB2MSB for Class 1 and Class 2.0
              modems and MSB2LSB for non-Multitech Class 2 modems. However this may be wrong for your modem,  so
              you will have to specify this parameter explicitly.

       <b>ModemRecvSuccessCmd</b>
              A  string  of commands to issue to the modem after a successful receive session before the call is
              disconnected.

       <b>ModemResetCmds</b>
              A string of commands to issue to the modem during initialization.  This  string  is  sent  to  the
              modem  <u>before</u>  the  standard  set of configuration commands required by the fax server.  Note that
              these commands <b>should</b>  <b>not</b>  <b>include</b>  <b>normal</b>  <b>reset</b>  <b>commands</b>  <b>that</b>  <b>are</b>  <b>specified</b>  <b>through</b>  <b>other</b>
              <b>parameters</b>.   For example, commands to setup flow control, DCD handling, DTR handling, etc. should
              be specified through the appropriate configuration parameters and not through this parameter.   In
              addition  the  soft  reset  command  (usually  ``ATZ'') should not be included in this string; the
              servers issue this command explicitly.

       <b>ModemResetDelay</b>
              The time, in milliseconds, to pause after setting DTR ON, while resetting a modem.   DTR  ON  does
              not  respond  with  ``OK'',  so this parameter should be long enough to allow the modem time to be
              ready for <b>ModemSoftResetCmd</b> successively.

       <b>ModemResultCodesCmd</b>
              The command to enable result codes.

       <b>ModemRevQueryCmd</b>
              The command to send to the modem to get  a  firmware  revision  identification  string.   If  this
              parameter is not set, then it is initialized to ``AT+FREV?'' for Class 2 modems, or to ``AT+FMR?''
              for  Class  2.0 modems.  If the parameter begins with a ``!'', then the remainder of the string is
              taken to be the identification string and no command is issued to the modem.

       <b>ModemSendBeginCmd</b>
              The command to send to the modem upon establishing carrier  during  a  transmit  operation.   This
              parameter  is  useful for systems that are incapable of enabling hardware flow control without DCD
              asserted.

       <b>ModemSendFillOrder</b>
              The bit order the modem expects for transmitted facsimile data.  This value may be either  LSB2MSB
              or MSB2LSB (see also <b>ModemRecvFillOrder</b> above.)  Virtually all modems expect transmitted facsimile
              data in LSB2MSB bit order.

       <b>ModemSetVolumeCmd</b>
              The  commands  to  use  to  set the modem speaker volume levels.  There should be five whitespace-
              separated commands, one each for setting the volume to ``Off'',  ``Quiet'',  ``Low'',  ``Medium'',
              and ``High''; the default is ``"ATM0 ATL0M1 ATL1M1 ATL2M1 ATL3M1"''.  See also <b>SpeakerVolume</b>.

       <b>ModemSetupAACmd</b>
              The  command  to  setup <u>adaptive</u> <u>answer</u> support in the modem-if available.  Adaptive answer is the
              term used for the ability to distinguish between calls from facsimile, voice,  and  data  sources.
              Note  that  this  string  is  the  last  command issued by the device drivers during setup, so the
              command string may, if necessary, switch to a different operating mode  (e.g.  on  some  Rockwell-
              based modems it is necessary to issue the ``AT+FAA=1'' command in Class 0).

       <b>ModemSetupDCDCmd</b>
              The  command  to  setup DCD handling.  On most systems the facsimile server will enable the CLOCAL
              flag on the tty device to which the modem is connected.  This should insure that the  system  does
              not close an open file descriptor associated with the modem if carrier is dropped.  Thus, for most
              systems and modems <b>ModemSetupDCDCmd</b> should setup DCD to reflect carrier.

       <b>ModemSetupDTRCmd</b>
              The command to setup DTR handling so that the modem is reset when the DTR signal is lowered by the
              host.   The  facsimile  server uses this facility to insure that modems are not left in a ``locked
              up'' state.

       <b>ModemSoftFlowCmd</b>
              The command to setup software (XON/XOFF) flow control between DTE and DCE.

       <b>ModemSoftResetCmd</b>
              The command to force a soft reset of the modem.

       <b>ModemSoftResetCmdDelay</b>
              The time, in milliseconds, to pause after receiving the OK following <b>ModemSoftResetCmd</b> before  any
              further commands are sent to the modem.

       <b>ModemSoftRTFCC</b>
              Whether  or  not  to  enable  software-driven  Real-Time Fax Compression Conversion.  RTFCC allows
              HylaFAX to convert the image compression between MH MR and MMR  formats  regardless  of  how  faxq
              formatted  the image file.  Note that when using RTFCC, the compression format of the file will be
              ignored, thus the ``-1'', ``-2'', and ``-3'' options for sendfax, ps2fax,  and  others  will  only
              influence  how  the  document  is  prepared  by  faxq and will not influence the actual negotiated
              session parameters.  <b>Class2RTFCC</b> takes precedence over <b>ModemSoftRTFCC</b> and  if  both  are  enabled,
              then software-driven RTFCC will not be performed in favor of the firmware-driven RTFCC.

       <b>ModemType</b>
              This  parameter  must  be set to one of: ``Class2'', ``Class2.0'', or ``Class1''; to indicate that
              the modem is a Class 2-, Class 2.0-, or Class 1-style modem, respectively.  If this  parameter  is
              not set, then it is autodetected and the highest supported fax class is used.

       <b>ModemVerboseResultsCmd</b>
              The command to enable verbose, as opposed to numeric, result codes.

       <b>ModemWaitForConnect</b>
              If  enabled,  the  facsimile  server  will not consider a connection established when answering an
              incoming call until a ``CONNECT'' status string is received.  This is useful mainly  for  Rockwell
              RC32ACL-based modems that send ``FAX'' and ``DATA'' status messages before sending ``CONNECT''.

       <b>ModemWaitTimeCmd</b>
              The  command  to  set  the  number  of seconds to wait for a carrier signal when placing a call or
              answering the phone.

</pre><h4><b>T.30</b> <b>PROTOCOL</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       The following parameters apply to the implementation of the CCITT T.30 facsimile protocol in the Class  1
       device driver.  They should not be changed without full understanding of the operation of the server.

       <b>FaxT1Timer</b>
              The  value  of  the  T1 timer in milliseconds.  This timer is used to time out the initial session
              contact; i.e. receipt of DIS/DCS.

       <b>FaxT2Timer</b>
              The value of the T2 timer in milliseconds.  This timer is used to time out receiving responses and
              commands.

       <b>FaxT4Timer</b>
              The value of the T4 timer in milliseconds.  This timer is used to time out the reception  of  HDLC
              frames and, usually, trigger frame retransmissions.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>1</b> <b>MODEM</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  parameters  are specific to the configuration of Class 1-style modems; they should not be
       changed lightly:

       <b>Class1Cmd</b>
              The command to set the modem into Class 1 operation.

       <b>Class1AdaptRecvCmd</b>
              The command used to enable adaptive reception support (usually ``AT+FAR=1'').  This feature is new
              in T.31, and many modems will not support it.  This feature may reduce  the  number  of  reception
              failures due to errors cascading from +FCERROR messages.

       <b>Class1ColorJPEGSupport</b>
              Whether  or not to enable support for T.30-E full-color facsimile with JPEG compression.  Enabling
              this automatically enables <b>Class1GreyJPEGSupport.</b>

       <b>Class1EnableV34Cmd</b>
              The command to enable V.34-fax support with at least the desired maximum primary channel rate.

       <b>Class1ECMSupport</b>
              Whether or not to support T.30-A error correction protocol.  Use of ECM will require 64  kilobytes
              of free memory per modem in active use.

       <b>Class1PersistentECM</b>
              Whether  or  not  to continue to retransmit and allow one to continue to receive image data in ECM
              protocol which is not accepted as valid after four successive attempts.

       <b>Class1ECMFrameSize</b>
              The size in bytes of image frames to  transmit  during  ECM  protocol.   This  setting  will  also
              indicate  a preference in receive sessions.  The only acceptable values are 64 and 256.  A setting
              of 64 may be useful on high-load systems  and  possibly  environments  with  extremely  poor  line
              quality.

       <b>Class1ExtendedRes</b>
              Whether or not to support resolutions other than normal and fine.  This option has been deprecated
              by <b>Class1Resolutions.</b>

       <b>Class1FrameOverhead</b>
              The  number  of  extraneous  bytes  in  HDLC  frames sent to the host in response to an ``AT+FRH''
              command.  For modems that properly implement the Class 1 interface, this number should be  4  (the
              default).

       <b>Class1GreyJPEGSupport</b>
              Whether  or  not  to enable support for T.30-E greyscale facsimile with JPEG compression.  This is
              always enabled if <b>Class1ColorJPEGSupport</b> is enabled.

       <b>Class1HookSensitivity</b>
              The number of times to ignore on-hook detections and merely treat them as command or modem errors.

       <b>Class1JBIGSupport</b>
              Whether or not to enable support for T.85 monochrome facsimile with JBIG compression.  Options are
              ``true'' for support in both sending and receiving, ``false'' for no support, ``send'' for support
              only in sending, and ``receive'' for support only in receiving.  If, during the  build  process  a
              compatible  JBIG  library was found then send support is enabled by default.  If, during the build
              process the TIFF tools are found to support JBIG then receive support is enabled by default.

       <b>Class1HasRHConnectBug</b>
              A Class 1 modem should only report CONNECT  after  AT+FRH=3  when  V.21  HDLC  data  is  detected.
              However,  some  modems  will  incorrectly  report  CONNECT  after AT+FRH=3 whenever any carrier is
              present. In such cases <b>Class1HasRHConnectBug</b> should be set to ``true''.

       <b>Class1HFLOCmd</b>
              The command to setup hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control between DTE and DCE when operating  in  Class
              1.   This command is issued immediately after sending the <b>Class1Cmd</b> to switch the modem to Class 1
              operation.

       <b>Class1MRSupport</b>
              Whether or not to enable  support  for  two-dimensional  Modified  Read  (MR)  image  data  format
              compression.

       <b>Class1MMRSupport</b>
              Whether  or  not  to  enable  support  for two-dimensional Modified Modified Read (MMR) image data
              format compression.  Note that MMR support requires also ECM support to be enabled.

       <b>Class1NFLOCmd</b>
              The command to setup no flow control between DTE and DCE when operating in Class 1.  This  command
              is issued immediately after sending the <b>Class1Cmd</b> to switch the modem to Class 1 operation.

       <b>Class1PageLengthSupport</b>
              The coded value for page lengths supported by the modem.  The only correct values and meanings are
              these: ``1'', A4 page length; ``3'', both A4 and B4 page length; ``7'', unlimited page length.

       <b>Class1PageWidthSupport</b>
              The  coded value for page widths supported by the modem.  The only correct values and meanings are
              these: ``1'', A4 page width; ``3'', both A4 and B4 page width; ``7'', all of A4, B4, and  A3  page
              widths.

       <b>Class1PPMWaitCmd</b>
              The command used to stop and wait before sending the post page message, except before sending EOP,
              when  <b>Class1EOPWaitCmd</b>  is  used  instead.  We must ensure that the high-speed carrier has stopped
              completely.  According to T.30, Chapter 5, Note 4, this delay should be 75 +/- 20 ms.

       <b>Class1ResponseWaitCmd</b>
              The command used to stop and wait after sending TCF,  before  attempting  to  receive  a  training
              response from the remote.  Set this to ``AT+FRS=1'' if you experience ``DIS/DTC received 3 times''
              errors.

       <b>Class1Resolutions</b>
              A  bitmapped  (bit-or'd)  value  indicating  the  resolutions  to  be  supported  during facsimile
              operation.  Individual resolutions follow Table 21/T.32 and are defined as follows:
              <b>Bit</b>              <b>Description</b>
              0 (0x00)         R8 x 3.85 l/mm, Normal
              1 (0x01)         R8 x 7.7 l/mm, Fine
              2 (0x02)         R8 x 15.4 l/mm, Superfine
              4 (0x04)         R16 x 15.4 l/mm, Hyperfine
              8 (0x08)         200 dpi x 100 l/inch
              16 (0x10)        200 dpi x 200 l/inch
              32 (0x20)        200 dpi x 400 l/inch
              64 (0x40)        300 dpi x 300 l/inch
              Thus, a value of 3 would indicate support for normal, fine, and superfine resolutions.

       <b>Class1RMQueryCmd</b>
              The command to send to the modem to get  the  list  of  supported  reception  bit-rates.   If  the
              parameter  begins with a ``!'', then the remainder of the string is taken to be the modem response
              and no command is issued to the modem.

       <b>Class1TCFWaitCmd</b>
              The command used to stop and wait before sending TCF, similar to <b>Class1PPMWaitCmd.</b>   According  to
              T.30, Chapter 5, Note 3, this delay should be 75 +/- 20 ms.

       <b>Class1TMQueryCmd</b>
              The  command  to  send  to  the modem to get the list of supported transmission bit-rates.  If the
              parameter begins with a ``!'', then the remainder of the string is taken to be the modem  response
              and no command is issued to the modem.

       <b>Class1EOPWaitCmd</b>
              The   command   used   to  stop  and  wait  before  sending  the  post  page  message  similar  to
              <b>Class1PPMWaitCmd.</b>  We allow a different setting in the case of EOP, however,  because  empirically
              some machines may need more time.

       <b>Class1ModemHasDLEBug</b>
              Used  to  indicate  that  the  modem  does  not  correctly  duplicate  DLE  characters in the V.21
              communication to the DTE.

       <b>Class1MsgRecvHackCmd</b>
              If  receive  failures  occur  due  to  +FCERROR  just  prior  to  image  data  reception,  setting
              <b>Class1MsgRecvHackCmd</b> to AT+FRS=1 may help.

       <b>Class1RecvAbortOK</b>
              The time, in milliseconds, to wait for an ``OK'' result code from the modem after aborting an HDLC
              frame  receive (``AT+FRH=3'').  If this number is zero, then the modem is assumed to not correctly
              implement aborting and instead the driver will wait 200ms, flush any input, and then send ``AT\n''
              and wait 100ms for an ``OK'' result.

       <b>Class1RecvIdentTimer</b>
              The time, in milliseconds, to  wait  for  an  initial  DCS  when  receiving  a  facsimile.   CCITT
              recommendation  T.30  specifies  this  as  the value of the T1 timer.  However, adaptive answering
              schemes such as that described above under the <b>AdaptiveAnswer</b>  parameter  may  require  that  this
              timer be shortened.

       <b>Class1RMPersistence</b>
              The  number  of  times  that  an  attempt  to  receive the high-speed data carrier should be made,
              resulting in +FCERROR, before the low-speed message carrier reception is attempted.   Some  modems
              are  quick to (perhaps incorrectly) return +FCERROR, and for those modems a value of 2 or 3 should
              be used.  For modems that are not quick to return +FCERROR, a value of 1 should be  used.   Proper
              tuning  of  this  can  provide  a  type of "adaptive reception control" for modems that accurately
              return  +FCERROR  without  supporting  <b>Class1AdaptRecvCmd.</b>   For   those   modems   that   support
              <b>Class1AdaptRecvCmd,</b>  <b>Class1RMPersistence</b> should probably not be set at 1, although +FCERROR should
              almost never occur with such modems.

              If the modem does not support the reporting  of  +FCERROR  or  adaptive  reception  control,  then
              <b>Class1RMPersistence</b>  should  probably  be set at 0, which causes the timeout looking for the high-
              speed data carrier  to  be  shortened,  thus  increasing  the  likelihood  of  recovery  from  any
              dissynchronization.  When  <b>Class1RMPersistence</b>  is  other  than  0 it is assumed that the +FCERROR
              reporting or <b>Class1AdaptRecvCmd</b> is functional and therefore the timeout looking for the high-speed
              data carrier is lengthened.

       <b>Class1SwitchingCmd</b>
              The command used to ensure that the sending facsimile device has turned off  its  modulator  (i.e.
              loss-of-carrier) as recommended by T.31: Appendix II.1.

       <b>Class1SFLOCmd</b>
              The  command to setup software (XON/XOFF) flow control between DTE and DCE when operating in Class
              1.  This command is issued immediately after sending the <b>Class1Cmd</b> to switch the modem to Class  1
              operation.

       <b>Class1TCFMaxNonZero</b>
              The  maximum percentage of non-zero data bytes permitted in an acceptable received TCF.  Note that
              this number does  not  include  any  leading  non-zero  data  in  the  received  data.   See  also
              <b>Class1TCFMinRun</b>.

       <b>Class1TCFMinRun</b>
              The  duration,  in  milliseconds,  of  the minimum run of zero data in an acceptable received TCF.
              This value should be specified according to a 1.5 second transmission of zero data (i.e. it should
              be between 0 and 1500).  See also <b>Class1TCFMaxNonZero</b> and <b>Class1TCFMinRunECMMod</b>.

       <b>Class1TCFMinRunECMMod</b>
              The factor by which <b>Class1TCFMinRun</b> should be modified in the case of  an  ECM  session.   As  ECM
              protocol  allows  retransmissions it is commonly faster to accept a lesser-quality data stream and
              the subsequent retransmisisons than it is to allow the communication speed to slow down (where the
              demodulation may still not produce an ideal data stream, anyway).

       <b>Class1TCFRecvHackCmd</b>
              If  receive  failures  occur  due  to  +FCERROR  just  prior  to  TCF  data   reception,   setting
              <b>Class1TCFRecvHackCmd</b> to AT+FRS=1 may help.

       <b>Class1TCFRecvTimeout</b>
              The  maximum  time  to wait, in milliseconds, for the first byte and again for the entirety of the
              Training Check (TCF) message data that is received during the  training  phase  of  the  facsimile
              reception protocol.

       <b>Class1TMConnectDelay</b>
              The  time,  in  milliseconds, to delay after receiving CONNECT following +FTM before sending image
              data.  T.31 8.3.3 requires the modem to  respond  with  CONNECT  before  the  modulation  training
              pattern.   If  transmission begins before the remote has successfully completed its own modulation
              training pattern then data, especially during TCF, could be lost.  Many modems do not follow  T.31
              in this regard, and thus the default is zero; however its use with such modems would likely have a
              negligible effect.

       <b>Class1ValidateV21Frames</b>
              Whether or not to use the FCS bits of received V.21 HDLC frames to check the validity of the frame
              itself.   Most  Class  1 modems perform this check independently (per T.31 7.4) and do not require
              this feature to be enabled.

</pre><h4><b>CLASS</b> <b>2</b> <b>AND</b> <b>2.0</b> <b>MODEM</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       The following parameters are specific to the configuration of Class 2- and Class 2.0-style modems:

       <b>Class2Cmd</b>
              The command to set the modem into Class 2/2.0 operation.

       <b>Class2AbortCmd</b>
              The command to use to abort an established session.  After using this command to abort a  session,
              the fax software will send <b>ModemOnHookCmd</b> and then reset the modem by dropping DTR .

       <b>Class2APCmd</b>
              A  largely unused option for modems supporting ITU-T.32, Class 2.1, standards.  This command would
              be used to enable sending and receiving SUB, SEP, and PWD frames.

       <b>Class2APQueryCmd</b>
              A largely unused option for modems supporting ITU-T.32, Class 2.1, standards.  This command  would
              be  used  to  query the capabilities of sending and receiving SUB, SEP, and PWD frames.  The value
              ``none'' may be used if the modem does not support any <b>Class2APQueryCmd.</b>

       <b>Class2BORCmd</b>
              The command to setup the bit order of sent and  received  facsimile  data.   Usually  the  command
              ``AT+FBOR=0''  is  used  so  that  data  is sent and received in <u>direct</u> bit order (LSB2MSB).  Some
              modems, such as the Everex 24/96D, must use reversed bit order for Phase B and D data exchanges to
              avoid a bug that results in garbage data being placed in the padding of EOL codes.  The bit  order
              specified  by  this  command  must  correspond  to  the  settings  of  the  <b>ModemSendFillOrder</b> and
              <b>ModemRecvFillOrder</b> parameters.

       <b>Class2BUGCmd</b>
              The command to use to enable or disable the tracing of HDLC frames sent and received by the modem.
              This tracing information should be returned to the host in ``+FHR:'' and ``+FHT:'' status strings.
              Note that many Class 2 modems do not support this facility, which is largely used  for  diagnostic
              purposes.  The value ``none'' may be used if the modem does not support any <b>Class2BUGCmd.</b>

       <b>Class2CIGCmd</b>
              The  command  used  to  set  a  polling  identifier.   This  string  is  inserted  into the format
              ``%s="&lt;id&gt;"''.

       <b>Class2CQCmd</b>
              The command to use to set up parameters for copy quality checking.  For  example,  for  an  Everex
              24/96D   modem   this   parameter  might  be  set  to  ``AT+FCQ=1\nAT+FBADMUL=20\nAT+FBADLIN=10''.
              <b>Class2CQCmd</b> should be configured to set-up all  available  copy  quality  services  available  per
              <b>Class2CQQueryCmd.</b>   To  disable  features  that  are  available, configure <b>Class2CQQueryCmd</b> with a
              ``!'', and then set <b>Class2CQCmd</b> accordingly.

       <b>Class2CQQueryCmd</b>
              The command to send to the modem to get the copy quality capabilities string.   If  the  parameter
              begins  with  a ``!'', then the remainder of the string is taken to be the capabilities string and
              no command is issued to the modem; this can be used together with the <b>Class2CQCmd</b>  to  force  copy
              quality  checking to be done in the server instead of in the modem.  See also <b>PercentGoodLines</b> and
              <b>MaxConsecutiveBadLines</b> for parameters used to do server copy quality checking.   If  copy  quality
              checking is configured to be done by the modem then it is not done by the server.

       <b>Class2CRCmd</b>
              The command to use to enable the reception of facsimile.

       <b>Class2DCCCmd</b>
              The   command  used  to  set  modem  capabilities.   This  string  is  inserted  into  the  format
              ``%s=vr,br,wd,ln,df,ec,bf,st''.

       <b>Class2DCCQueryCmd</b>
              The command to send to the modem to get the Class 2/2.0 capabilities.   If  the  parameter  begins
              with  a  ``!'',  then  the  remainder  of the string is taken to be the capabilities string and no
              command is issued to the modem.

       <b>Class2DDISCmd</b>
              The command to set session parameters before dialing.  This string is  inserted  into  the  format
              ``%s=vr,br,wd,ln,df,ec,bf,st''.  Setting this parameter enables support for Class 2 modems that do
              not properly implement the ``AT+FDIS'' command by setting up session parameters before dialing the
              telephone.

       <b>Class2DISCmd</b>
              The  command  used to set the current session parameters.  This string is inserted into the format
              ``%s=vr,br,wd,ln,df,ec,bf,st''.

       <b>Class2ECMType</b>
              The interpretation of the EC parameter in the modem DCC  response  varies  between  the  Class  2,
              ``2'',   and  Class  2.0,  ``2.0'',  specifications.   This  configuration  parameter  allows  the
              administrator to specify which type to use.  The  corresponding  specification  type  is  used  by
              default.

       <b>Class2HexNSF</b>
              Whether  or  not  to  parse  the  NSF  strings reported by the modem using hexadecimal values.  By
              default, they are parsed as hexadecimal values.

       <b>Class2HFLOCmd</b>
              The command to setup hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control between DTE and DCE when operating  in  Class
              2/2.0.   This  command  is  issued  immediately after sending the <b>Class2Cmd</b> to switch the modem to
              Class 2/2.0 operation.  For Class 2.0 operation the default is ``AT+FLO=2''.

       <b>Class2JPEGSupport</b>
              Whether or not to enable and utilize the JPEG support found in the modem.

       <b>Class2LIDCmd</b>
              The command used to set the local identifier string.  This string  is  inserted  into  the  format
              ``%s="&lt;id&gt;"''

       <b>Class2MINSPCmd</b>
              The  command used to set the minimum acceptable speed to be negotiated for transmitting page data.
              This string is inserted into the format ``%s=&lt;speed&gt;''

       <b>Class2NFLOCmd</b>
              The command to setup no flow control between DTE and DCE when  operating  in  Class  2/2.0.   This
              command  is  issued  immediately  after  sending  the  <b>Class2Cmd</b>  to  switch  the modem to Class 2
              operation.  For Class 2.0 operation the default is ``AT+FLO=0''.

       <b>Class2NRCmd</b>
              (<u>Class</u> <u>2.0</u> <u>only</u>) The command to setup negotiation message reporting.  For the correct operation of
              the Class 2.0 driver this command must enable the reporting of: receiver  parameters,  transmitter
              parameters,  and  ID  strings.  It is not necessary to enable reporting of non-standard frames for
              correct operation of the Class 2.0 driver.

       <b>Class2PACmd</b>
              A largely unused option for modems supporting ITU-T.32, Class 2.1, standards.  This command  would
              be used to set up the polling address string enabled by the <b>Class2APCmd</b>.

       <b>Class2PHCTOCmd</b>
              The  command  to use to set the Phase C timeout parameter (in seconds).  The value ``none'' may be
              used if the modem does not support any <b>Class2PHCTOCmd.</b>

       <b>Class2PIECmd</b>
              (<u>Class</u> <u>2.0</u> <u>only</u>) The command to use to control procedure interrupt handling.  Procedure interrupts
              should be disabled because  <u>HylaFAX</u>  does  not  provide  a  mechanism  for  dispatching  procedure
              interrupts to an administrator.

       <b>Class2PTSCmd</b>
              The  command  to  use to set the received page status code.  When copy quality checking is done in
              the host, this command may be used to control the post-page  response  delivered  to  the  sender.
              Beware  that some modems do not properly implement this command in which case the server should be
              configured to not do copy quality  check:  see  the  <b>PercentGoodLines</b>  and  <b>MaxConsecutiveBadLines</b>
              parameters to understand how to defeat copy quality checking.

       <b>Class2PTSQueryCmd</b>
              The  command to use to query the received page status code.  This command may be used to determine
              the post-page response returned from the receiver.   Beware  that  some  modems  do  not  properly
              implement this command in which case this setting should be set to ``none''.

       <b>Class2PWCmd</b>
              A  largely unused option for modems supporting ITU-T.32, Class 2.1, standards.  This command would
              be used to set up the password string enabled by the <b>Class2APCmd</b>.

       <b>Class2RecvDataTrigger</b>
              The character to send to the modem to trigger the transmission of received data from the modem  to
              the  host.  This character is specified to be DC1 (octal 21) in the draft specification 2388-A and
              DC2 (octal 22) in the 2388-B specification.  Most Class 2 modems accept DC1 or both DC1  and  DC2.
              Some  modems  however  only  accept  DC2.   Note  that  string  parameters  may use C-style escape
              sequences, so DC2, for example, would be specified as ``"\022"''.

       <b>Class2RELCmd</b>
              The command to use to enable the delivery of byte-aligned EOL codes  in  received  facsimile.   If
              this  parameter is defined, then received facsimile data will be marked to indicate that EOL codes
              are byte-aligned; otherwise they will be marked as not (necessarily) having byte-aligned codes.

       <b>Class2RTFCC</b>
              Whether or not to enable MultiTech's Real-Time Fax Compression Conversion which  is  available  in
              later firmware revisions for the MT5634ZBA-V92, MT5634ZPX-PCI-V92, and other models.  RTFCC allows
              HylaFAX  to  convert  the  image  compression between MH MR and MMR formats regardless of how faxq
              formatted the image file.  If RTFCC  is  available  with  your  firmware,  then  the  response  to
              ``AT+FFC=?''  is non-zero.  Note that when using RTFCC, the compression format of the file will be
              ignored, thus the ``-1'', ``-2'', and ``-3'' options for sendfax,  ps2fax,  and  others  will  not
              influence the actual negotiated session parameters.

       <b>Class2SACmd</b>
              A  largely unused option for modems supporting ITU-T.32, Class 2.1, standards.  This command would
              be used to set up the destination subaddress string enabled by the <b>Class2APCmd</b>.

       <b>Class2SendRTC</b>
              Whether or not to append an explicit ``Return To Control'' (RTC) signal  to  the  page  data  when
              transmitting.   The  Class  2  and Class 2.0 specs (i.e. SP-2388-A and TIA/EIA-592) state that the
              modem will append RTC when it receives the post-page message command from the host; this parameter
              is provided in case the modem does not correctly implement this.

       <b>Class2SFLOCmd</b>
              The command to setup software (XON/XOFF) flow control between DTE and DCE when operating in  Class
              2/2.0.   This  command  is  issued  immediately after sending the <b>Class2Cmd</b> to switch the modem to
              Class 2/2.0 operation.  For Class 2.0 operation the default is ``AT+FLO=1''.

       <b>Class2SPLCmd</b>
              The command to use to enable a polling request.  The value ``none'' may be used if the modem  does
              not support any <b>Class2SPLCmd.</b>

       <b>Class2TBCCmd</b>
              The  command  to  use  to  enable stream-mode communication between the host and modem.  The value
              ``none'' may be used if the modem does not support any <b>Class2TBCCmd.</b>

       <b>Class2UseLineCount</b>
              Whether or not to use the line count reported to HylaFAX by the modem firmware decoder.

       <b>Class2UseHex</b>
              Whether or not to parse the capabilities strings reported by the modem using  hexadecimal  values.
              By default, they are parsed as decimal values.

       <b>Class2XmitWaitForXON</b>
              Whether  or  not  to wait for an XON character from the modem before sending facsimile data to the
              modem for transmission.  Note that this is only relevant for modems that conform to  the  Class  2
              spec  (i.e.  SP-2388-A).   The  Class  2.0  specification  states  that the host may transmit data
              immediately upon receiving CONNECT and that no XON character will be sent to the host.

</pre><h4><b>PAGER-RELATED</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>PARAMETERS</b></h4><pre>
       The following parameters are specific to the configuration and operation of the IXO/TAP and  UCP  support
       for sending pager messages and GSM SM. Parameter not used for UCP are marked with ``(<u>IXO/TAP</u> <u>only</u>)''.

       <b>PagerSetupCmds</b>
              The  commands  to  send  to  a  modem  to  prepare the modem for a call to pager service provider.
              Typically these commands place direct the modem to communicate with the service  provider  at  300
              bps  using  the  V.21  protocol.   Per-service  provider  command strings can be setup in the info
              database; see <u><a href="../man5/hylafax-info.5.html">hylafax-info</a></u>(5).

       <b>PagerMaxMsgLength</b>
              The maximum length for a pager text message.  Messages longer  than  this  number  are  truncated.
              Per-service provider message lengths can be setup in the info database; see <u><a href="../man5/hylafax-info.5.html">hylafax-info</a></u>(5).

       <b>IXOService</b>
              (<u>IXO/TAP</u> <u>only</u>) The service identification string transmitted as part of the IXO/TAP protocol.

       <b>IXODeviceID</b>
              (<u>IXO/TAP</u>  <u>only</u>)  The  terminal  device  identification  string  transmitted as part of the IXO/TAP
              protocol.

       <b>IXOMaxUnknown</b>
              The maximum number of unrecognized messages that will be accepted at various stages of the IXO/TAP
              protocol before the sender will abort and hangup the phone.

       <b>IXOIDProbe</b>
              (<u>IXO/TAP</u> <u>only</u>) The time, in seconds, between sending a ``\r'' during the  initial  ID  recognition
              sequence of the IXO/TAP protocol.

       <b>IXOIDTimeout</b>
              (<u>IXO/TAP</u>  <u>only</u>) The maximum time, in seconds, to wait for the initial ID response from the service
              provider.

       <b>IXOLoginRetries</b>
              (<u>IXO/TAP</u> <u>only</u>) The maximum number of attempts to login to a service provider.

       <b>IXOLoginTimeout</b>
              (<u>IXO/TAP</u> <u>only</u>) The maximum time, in seconds, to wait to complete the login procedure.

       <b>IXOGATimeout</b>
              (<u>IXO/TAP</u> <u>only</u>) The maximum time, in seconds, to wait for  a  Go-Ahead  message  from  the  service

              (secs) The maximum time, in seconds, to wait for an acknowledgement to a transmitted message.

</pre><h4><b>PROTOTYPE</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       Per-modem configuration files are typically derived from prototype files that have been created for known
       modems.  These prototype files are kept in the <b>config</b> subdirectory and, by convention,  have  names  that
       identify  a  brand  or  type of modem and the DTE-DCE flow control scheme the prototype files configures.
       The <u><a href="../man8/faxaddmodem.8.html">faxaddmodem</a></u>(8) program that is used to configure a modem for use with  <u>HylaFAX</u>  selects  a  prototype
       configuration  file  using  information  retrieved  from the modem and comments embedded in the prototype
       files.  For Class 1 modems the product ID code returned by the command ``ATI0'' and the response from the
       command ``ATI3'' are used to select a  prototype  configuration  file,  while  for  Class  2  modems  the
       manufacturer  and  model  as  returned  by  ``AT+FMFR?''  and  ``AT+FMDL?'',  respectively,  are used (or
       ``AT+FMI?'' and ``AT+FMM?'' for Class 2.0 modems).

       A Class 1 prototype configuration file is identified for use by <u>faxaddmodem</u> by searching for a comment of
       the form:
       # CONFIG:CLASS1:144:.*:RTSCTS: Manufacturer='AT&amp;T' Model=Dataport
       In this example ``144'' is the product ID code for an AT&amp;T DataPort modem, ``.*'' is a regular expression
       matched against the result string returned by the ``ATI3'' command, and ``RTSCTS'' indicates the modem is
       configured to use hardware flow control during fax operation.  The remainder of the line is evaluated  by
       the  <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1)  and  used  to  specify  the  modem's manufacturer and model (since Class 1 modems do not have
       standard commands to query this information).

       Class 2 and 2.0 prototype configuration files match the string ``<u>manufacturer</u>-<u>model</u>-<u>flowcontrol</u>'' against
       a <u><a href="../man1/sh.1.html">sh</a></u>(1) glob pattern specified in the configuration file, where <u>manufacturer</u> and <u>model</u>  are  the  strings
       returned  by  querying  the  modem  and  <u>flowcontrol</u>  is  either  ``RTSCTS'' for hardware flow control or
       ``XONXOFF'' for software flow control.  For example:
       # CONFIG: CLASS2: ZyXEL*-RTSCTS
       # CONFIG: CLASS2.0: USRobotics*-XONXOFF
       are configuration comments that appear in the prototype file for a ZyXEL 1496E with Class 2 support,  and
       for a US Robotics Courier modem with Class 2.0 firmware.

       The  <u>faxaddmodem</u>  program  merges server-specific configuration parameters into a prototype configuration
       according to comments placed in the prototype  file.   All  lines  between  ``BEGIN-SERVER''  and  ``END-
       SERVER''  comments are placed with the appropriate server configuration parameters.  Note that this means
