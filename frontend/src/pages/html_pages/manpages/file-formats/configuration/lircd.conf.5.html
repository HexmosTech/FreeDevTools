</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       lircd.conf - lirc main configuration file

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  file  has  two  purposes:  to  provide timing information to the driver so it can decode the data to
       button presses, and to provide a mapping from button presses to key symbols used by <b><a href="../man8/lircd.8.html">lircd</a>(8).</b>

       The basic structure is a list of remote blocks.  Whitespace and line breaks are used as delimiters.

       If the comment character (#) appears as the first character on a line the rest of the line is ignored.

</pre><h4><b>REMOTE</b> <b>BLOCKS</b></h4><pre>
       Remote blocks are either normal or raw.

       Normal remote blocks begin with <b>begin</b> <b>remote</b> and ends with <b>end</b> <b>remote.</b>   The  first  part  of  the  block
       describes  the basic properties of the remote, see REMOTE DESCRIPTION SECTION.  Following this is a codes
       section, which is delimited by <b>begin</b> <b>codes</b> and <b>end</b> <b>codes.</b>

       Each line in a codes section contains the name of a button on the remote followed by a  hexadecimal  data
       value  matching  the  data  part of the IR frame (see REMOTE DESCRIPTION SECTION). You may not assign the
       same name to two buttons in the same remote section.

       Raw remote blocks are identical to normal blocks besides the codes section which  is  a  list  of  button
       descriptions enclosed by <b>begin</b> <b>raw_codes</b> and <b>end</b> <b>raw_codes.</b>

       A  raw  button  description begins with the parameter <b>name</b> followed by the name of the button. The button
       description ends with the next button description or the end of the raw_codes block. The lines in between
       is a list of decimal numbers describing the signal sent by that button. The first  number  indicates  the
       duration of the first pulse in microseconds.  The second number indicates the duration of the space which
       follows  it.   Pulse  and space durations alternate for as long as is necessary. The last duration should
       represent a pulse.

</pre><h4><b>REMOTE</b> <b>DESCRIPTION</b> <b>SECTION</b></h4><pre>
       Each line in this section contains a parameter followed by the value or values that should be assigned to
       that parameter. Parameters are optional unless otherwise stated.

       All values are decimal integers that are either  dimensionless  or  have  units  of  microseconds  unless
       otherwise  stated. Hexadecimal numbers should be prefixed by 0x. If the remote does not have a particular
       "feature," then the line may be omitted. The button code is sent just  after  the  pre  signal  and  just
       before the post signal.

       Some parameters describe the bits in the IR protocol. The frame is normally defined like

              |header|plead|pre data|pre|data|post|post data|ptrail|foot|gap|

       where  most  parameters  defaults to 0. Some parameters change the overall frame layout e. g., the repeat
       parameter.

       <b>include</b> <b>”&lt;path&gt;”</b>
           Include the given path using normal <u>include</u> semantics. If the path  is  relative,  it's   interpreted
           relative  to  the  main  lircd.conf  file. &lt;path&gt; must be enclosed in double quotes. It can contain a
           <a href="../man3/glob.3.html">glob</a>(3) pattern in which case all matching files are included.

       <b>manual_sort</b> <b>&lt;1|0&gt;</b>
           Normally, lircd tries to sort multiple remotes so the one  which  decodes  fastest  are  used  first.
           Setting  manual_sort  to  1  in  any  remote disables this and uses the remotes in the order they are
           listed in lircd.conf or as the alphanumerically sorted filenames in lircd.conf.d.

       <b>name</b> <b>&lt;remote</b> <b>name&gt;</b>
           The unique name assigned to the remote control (may not contain whitespace).  Within  a  single  file
           all names must be unique. Parameter is mandatory.

       <b>suppress_repeat</b> <b>&lt;repeats&gt;</b>
           Suppress a given number of repeats for all buttons in this remote. Defaults to 0, which means that no
           repeats  are  suppressed.  Note that lircrc has a corresponding <u>repeat</u> parameter which can be used to
           suppress repeats for specific button/client combinations.

       <b>flags</b> <b>&lt;flag1&gt;&lt;|flag2&gt;...</b>
           Flags are special text strings which describe various properties of  the  remote  and  determine  the
           semantics of some of the following fields.  Multiple flags should be separated by the pipe(|) symbol.
           See FLAGS.

       <b>driver</b> <b>&lt;driver</b> <b>name&gt;</b>
           For  lirccode  drivers which does not have timing information the optional driver attribute names the
           driver which is required to use this remote.

       <b>bits</b> <b>&lt;number</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> <b>bits&gt;</b>
           The number of data bits in the hexadecimal codes which describe each button (decimal integer).

       <b>eps</b> <b>&lt;relative</b> <b>error</b> <b>tolerance&gt;</b>
           The relative error tolerance for received signals in percent. By default, irrecord set this to 30 (i.
           e., 30%).

       <b>aeps</b> <b>&lt;absolute</b> <b>error</b> <b>tolerance&gt;</b>
           The absolute error tolerance for received signals (microseconds). The default is the hardcoded driver
           dependent resolution value. By default irrecord sets this to 100.

       <b>header</b> <b>&lt;phead&gt;</b> <b>&lt;shead&gt;</b>
           The initial pulse and space sent (microseconds).

       <b>foot</b> <b>&lt;pfoot&gt;</b> <b>&lt;sfoot&gt;</b>
           A pulse and space, immediately following the trailing pulse.

       <b>repeat</b> <b>&lt;prepeat&gt;</b> <b>&lt;srepeat&gt;</b>
           A pulse and space that replaces everything between leading pulse and the trailing pulse,  whenever  a
           signal is repeated. The foot is not sent, and the header is not sent unless the REPEAT_HEADER flag is
           present.

       <b>pre_data_bits</b> <b>&lt;number</b> <b>of</b> <b>pre_data_bits&gt;</b>

           A  gap  immediately  following the trailing pulse, and preceding a repetition of the same code that's
           due to a the same press of the button.

       <b>min_repeat</b> <b>&lt;minimum</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>repetitions&gt;</b>
           The minimum times a signal is repeated when sent. Note that 0 means the signal is sent only once. Not

       <b>toggle_bit</b> <b>&lt;bit</b> <b>to</b> <b>toggle&gt;</b>
           A bit of the pre_data, code, or post_data that is toggled between one and zero each time a button  is
           pressed. This parameter is obsoleted by toggle_bit_mask and should be used in new configs.

       <b>toggle_bit_mask</b> <b>&lt;hexadecimal</b> <b>mask&gt;</b>
           Bits  which  are  toggled between one and zero each time a button is pressed.  The mask is applied to

           1-100 inclusive.  default is 50.

</pre><h4><b>FLAGS</b></h4><pre>
       Flags are values set in the flags parameter.

       <b>RC5</b> The remote uses the RC5 protocol.

       <b>RC6</b> The remote uses the RC6 protocol.

       <b>RCMM</b>
           The remote uses the RC-MM protocol.

       <b>SHIFT_ENC</b>
           Obsolete  flag,  now  a  synonym  for  RC5.  The  position  of  the pulse (before or after the space)
           determines whether the bit is a one or a zero.

       <b>SPACE_ENC</b>
           A one and a zero can be distinguished by the length of the spaces,  used  by  the  NEC  protocol  and
           others.

       <b>REVERSE</b>
           Reverses  the  bit order of the pre_data, the post_data and the codes (e.g., 0x123 becomes 0xC48). If
           this flag is present, the least significant bit is sent first.

       <b>NO_HEAD_REP</b>
           The header is not sent when a signal (the button is held down) is repeated even though  there  is  no
           special repeat code.

       <b>NO_FOOT_REP</b>
           The  foot  is  not  sent  when a signal is repeated (the button is held down) even though there is no
           special repeat code .

       <b>CONST_LENGTH</b>
           The total signal length is always constant. The gap length now represents the length  of  the  entire
           signal, and the actual gap at the end of the signal is adjusted accordingly.

       <b>RAW_CODES</b>
           The codes are in raw format.

       <b>REPEAT_HEADER</b>
           Send the header when the signal is repeated even though the remote has a special repeat code.

</pre><h4><b>DISCLAIMER</b></h4><pre>
       LIRC  was  designed  to collect IR data and save it in a private, compact, yet human readable format with
       the purpose of being able to re-transmit (or re-recognize) these signals. It was not  designed  with  the
       goal  of  providing  a  well  documented and tested configuration file format that could be used e.g., to
       generate arbitrary IR signals or to convert them to other formats. The configuration file should thus not
       be considered a public interface to LIRC.

       This manpage should be understood with this in mind. It was authored by reading the  code  of  LIRC,  and
       does  not  constitute  an authoritative specification of the behavior of LIRC and its configuration file.
       Also, some less commonly used flags and parameters are not documented.
