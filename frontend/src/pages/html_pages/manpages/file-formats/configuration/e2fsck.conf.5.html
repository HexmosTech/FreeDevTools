</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       e2fsck.conf - Configuration file for e2fsck

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       <u>e2fsck.conf</u> is the configuration file for <b><a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck</a></b>(8).  It controls the default behavior of <b><a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck</a></b>(8) while
       it is checking ext2, ext3, or ext4 file systems.

       The  <u>e2fsck.conf</u>  file uses an INI-style format.  Stanzas, or top-level sections, are delimited by square
       braces: [ ].  Within each section, each line defines a relation, which assigns tags to values,  or  to  a
       subsection,  which contains further relations or subsections.  An example of the INI-style format used by
       this configuration file follows below:

            [section1]
                 tag1 = value_a
                 tag1 = value_b
                 tag2 = value_c

            [section 2]
                 tag3 = {
                      subtag1 = subtag_value_a
                      subtag1 = subtag_value_b
                      subtag2 = subtag_value_c
                 }
                 tag1 = value_d
                 tag2 = value_e
            }

       Comments are delimited by a semicolon (';') or a hash ('#') character at the beginning  of  the  comment,
       and are terminated by the end of line character.

       Tags  and  values must be quoted using double quotes if they contain spaces.  Within a quoted string, the
       standard backslash interpretations apply: "\n" (for the newline character), "\t" (for the tab character),
       "\b" (for the backspace character), and "\\" (for the backslash character).

       The following stanzas are used in the <u>e2fsck.conf</u> file.  They will be described in more detail in  future
       sections of this document.

       <u>[options]</u>
              This stanza contains general configuration parameters for <b>e2fsck</b>'s behavior.

       <u>[defaults]</u>
              Contains  relations  which  define  the  default  parameters used by <b><a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck</a></b>(8).  In general, these
              defaults may be overridden by command-line options provided by the user.

       <u>[problems]</u>
              This stanza allows the administrator  to  reconfigure  how  e2fsck  handles  various  file  system
              inconsistencies.

       <u>[scratch_files]</u>
              This stanza controls when e2fsck will attempt to use scratch files to reduce the need for memory.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>[options]</b> <b>STANZA</b></h4><pre>
       The following relations are defined in the <u>[options]</u> stanza.

       <u>allow_cancellation</u>
              If  this  relation is set to a boolean value of true, then if the user interrupts e2fsck using ^C,
              and the file system is not explicitly flagged as containing errors, e2fsck will exit with an  exit
              status of 0 instead of 32.  This setting defaults to false.

       <u>accept_time_fudge</u>
              Unfortunately, due to Windows' unfortunate design decision to configure the hardware clock to tick
              localtime,  instead  of  the  more  proper and less error-prone UTC time, many users end up in the
              situation where the system clock is incorrectly set at the time when e2fsck is run.

              Historically this was  usually  due  to  some  distributions  having  buggy  init  scripts  and/or
              installers   that  didn't  correctly  detect  this  case  and  take  appropriate  countermeasures.
              Unfortunately, this is occasionally true even today, usually  due  to  a  buggy  or  misconfigured
              virtualization  manager  or  the  installer  not having access to a network time server during the
              installation process.  So by default, we allow the superblock times to  be  fudged  by  up  to  24
              hours.   This  can  be  disabled by setting <u>accept_time_fudge</u> to the boolean value of false.  This
              setting defaults to true.

       <u>broken_system_clock</u>
              The <b><a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck</a></b>(8) program has some heuristics that assume  that  the  system  clock  is  correct.   In
              addition, many system programs make similar assumptions.  For example, the UUID library depends on
              time  not  going  backwards  in  order  for  it  to  be  able to make its guarantees about issuing
              universally unique ID's.  Systems with broken system clocks, are well,  broken.   However,  broken
              system  clocks, particularly in embedded systems, do exist.  E2fsck will attempt to use heuristics
              to determine if the time can not be trusted; and to skip time-based checks if this  is  true.   If
              this  boolean  is  set  to  true,  then e2fsck will always assume that the system clock can not be
              trusted.

       <u>buggy_init_scripts</u>
              This boolean relation is an alias for <u>accept_time_fudge</u> for backwards compatibility; it used to be
              that the behavior defined by <u>accept_time_fudge</u> above defaulted to  false,  and  <u>buggy_init_scripts</u>
              would enable superblock time field to be wrong by up to 24 hours.  When we changed the default, we
              also renamed this boolean relation to <u>accept_time_fudge.</u>

       <u>clear_test_fs_flag</u>
              This  boolean  relation  controls whether or not <b><a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck</a></b>(8) will offer to clear the test_fs flag if
              the ext4 file system is available on the system.  It defaults to true.

       <u>defer_check_on_battery</u>
              This boolean relation controls whether or not the interval  between  file  system  checks  (either
              based  on  time  or number of mounts) should be doubled if the system is running on battery.  This
              setting defaults to true.

       <u>indexed_dir_slack_percentage</u>
              When <b><a href="../man8/e2fsck.8.html">e2fsck</a></b>(8) repacks a indexed directory, reserve the specified percentage  of  empty  space  in
              each  leaf  nodes  so  that a few new entries can be added to the directory without splitting leaf
              nodes, so that the average fill ratio of directories can be maintained at a higher, more efficient
              level.  This relation defaults to 20 percent.

       <u>inode_count_fullmap</u>
              If this boolean relation is true, trade off using memory for speed when  checking  a  file  system
              with  a  large  number of hard-linked files.  The amount of memory required is proportional to the
              number of inodes in the file system.  For large file systems, this can  be  gigabytes  of  memory.
              (For  example  a 40TB file system with 2.8 billion inodes will consume an additional 5.7 GB memory
              if this optimization is enabled.)  This setting defaults to false.

       <u>log_dir</u>
              If the <u>log_filename</u> or <u>problem_log_filename</u> relations contains a relative pathname, then  the  log
              file will be placed in the directory named by the <u>log_dir</u> relation.

       <u>log_dir_fallback</u>
              This  relation  contains  an  alternate  directory that will be used if the directory specified by
              <u>log_dir</u> is not available or is not writable.

       <u>log_dir_wait</u>
              If this boolean relation is true, them if the directories specified by <u>log_dir</u> or <u>log_dir_fallback</u>
              are not available or are not yet writable, e2fsck will save the output in a memory buffer,  and  a
              child  process  will  periodically test to see if the log directory has become available after the
              boot sequence has mounted the requested file system  for  reading/writing.   This  implements  the
              functionality provided by <b><a href="../man8/logsave.8.html">logsave</a></b>(8) for e2fsck log files.

       <u>log_filename</u>
              This  relation  specifies  the  file  name  where  a copy of e2fsck's output will be written.   If
              certain problem reports are suppressed using the <u>max_count_problems</u> relation, (or on a per-problem
              basis using the <u>max_count</u> relation), the full set of problem reports will be written  to  the  log
              file.   The  filename  may  contain  various  percent-expressions (%D, %T, %N, etc.) which will be
              expanded so that the file name for the log file can include things like date, time,  device  name,
              and other run-time parameters.  See the <b>LOGGING</b> section for more details.

       <u>max_count_problems</u>
              This relation specifies the maximum number of problem reports of a particular type will be printed
              to  stdout  before  further problem reports of that type are squelched.  This can be useful if the
              console is slow (i.e., connected to a serial port) and so a large amount of output  could  end  up
              delaying the boot process for a long time (potentially hours).

       <u>no_optimize_extents</u>
              If  this boolean relation is true, do not offer to optimize the extent tree by reducing the tree's
              width or depth.  This setting defaults to false.

       <u>problem_log_filename</u>
              This relation specifies the file name where a log of problem codes found  by  e2fsck  be  written.
              The  filename may contain various percent-expressions (%D, %T, %N, etc.) which will be expanded so
              that the file name for the log file can include things like date, time,  device  name,  and  other
              run-time parameters.  See the <b>LOGGING</b> section for more details.

       <u>readahead_mem_pct</u>
              Use  this  percentage of memory to try to read in metadata blocks ahead of the main e2fsck thread.
              This should reduce run times, depending on the speed of the underlying storage and the  amount  of
              free memory.  There is no default, but see <b>readahead_kb</b> for more details.

       <u>readahead_kb</u>
              Use  this  amount of memory to read in metadata blocks ahead of the main checking thread.  Setting
              this value to zero disables readahead entirely.  By default, this is set the  size  of  two  block
              groups'  inode  tables (typically 4MiB on a regular ext4 file system); if this amount is more than
              1/50th of total physical memory, readahead is disabled.

       <u>report_features</u>
              If this boolean relation is true, e2fsck will print the  file  system  features  as  part  of  its
              verbose reporting (i.e., if the <b>-v</b> option is specified)

       <u>report_time</u>
              If  this  boolean  relation  is  true, e2fsck will run as if the options <b>-tt</b> are always specified.
              This will cause e2fsck to print timing statistics on a pass by pass basis  for  full  file  system
              checks.

       <u>report_verbose</u>
              If  this  boolean relation is true, e2fsck will run as if the option <b>-v</b> is always specified.  This
              will cause e2fsck to print some additional information at the end of each full file system check.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>[defaults]</b> <b>STANZA</b></h4><pre>
       The following relations are defined in the <u>[defaults]</u> stanza.

       <u>undo_dir</u>
              This relation specifies the directory where the undo file should be stored.  It can be  overridden
              via  the  <b>E2FSPROGS_UNDO_DIR</b>  environment variable.  If the directory location is set to the value
              <u>none</u>, <b>e2fsck</b> will not create an undo file.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>[problems]</b> <b>STANZA</b></h4><pre>
       Each tag in the <u>[problems]</u> stanza names a problem code specified with a leading "0x" followed by six  hex
       digits.  The value of the tag is a subsection where the relations in that subsection override the default
       treatment of that particular problem code.

       Note  that  inappropriate  settings in this stanza may cause <b>e2fsck</b> to behave incorrectly, or even crash.
       Most system administrators should not be making changes to this section without referring to source code.

       Within each problem code's subsection, the following tags may be used:

       <u>description</u>
              This relation allows the message which is printed when this file system inconsistency is  detected
              to be overridden.

       <u>preen_ok</u>
              This  boolean relation overrides the default behavior controlling whether this file system problem
              should be automatically fixed when <b>e2fsck</b> is running in preen mode.

       <u>max_count</u>
              This integer relation overrides the <u>max_count_problems</u> parameter (set in the options section)  for
              this particular problem.

       <u>no_ok</u>  This  boolean  relation  overrides the default behavior determining whether or not the file system
              will be marked as inconsistent if the user declines to fix the reported problem.

       <u>no_default</u>
              This boolean relation overrides whether the default answer for this problem (or  question)  should
              be "no".

       <u>preen_nomessage</u>
              This  boolean  relation  overrides the default behavior controlling whether or not the description
              for this file system problem should be suppressed when <b>e2fsck</b> is running in preen mode.

       <u>no_nomsg</u>
              This boolean relation overrides the default behavior controlling whether or  not  the  description
              for  this  file  system problem should be suppressed when a problem forced not to be fixed, either
              because <b>e2fsck</b> is run with the <b>-n</b> option or because  the  <u>force_no</u>  flag  has  been  set  for  the
              problem.

       <u>force_no</u>
              This  boolean  option, if set to true, forces a problem to never be fixed.  That is, it will be as
              if the user problem responds 'no' to the  question  of  'should  this  problem  be  fixed?'.   The
              <u>force_no</u>  option  even  overrides  the  <b>-y</b> option given on the command-line (just for the specific
              problem, of course).

       <u>not_a_fix</u>
              This boolean option, it set to true, marks the problem as one where if the user  gives  permission
              to  make the requested change, it does not mean that the file system had a problem which has since
              been fixed.  This is used for requests to optimize the  file  system's  data  structure,  such  as
              pruning an extent tree.

</pre><h4><b>THE</b> <b>[scratch_files]</b> <b>STANZA</b></h4><pre>
       The following relations are defined in the <u>[scratch_files]</u> stanza.

       <u>directory</u>
              If  the  directory named by this relation exists and is writeable, then e2fsck will attempt to use
              this directory to store scratch files instead of using in-memory data structures.

       <u>numdirs_threshold</u>
              If this relation is set, then in-memory data structures will be used if the number of  directories
              in the file system are fewer than amount specified.

       <u>dirinfo</u>
              This  relation  controls whether or not the scratch file directory is used instead of an in-memory
              data structure for directory information.  It defaults to true.

       <u>icount</u> This relation controls whether or not the scratch file directory is used instead of  an  in-memory
              data structure when tracking inode counts.  It defaults to true.

</pre><h4><b>LOGGING</b></h4><pre>
       E2fsck  has  the  facility  to  save  the  information from an e2fsck run in a directory so that a system
       administrator can review its output at their  leisure.   This  allows  information  captured  during  the
       automatic  e2fsck  preen  run, as well as a manually started e2fsck run, to be saved for posterity.  This
       facility is controlled by the <u>log_filename</u>, <u>log_dir</u>, <u>log_dir_fallback</u>, and <u>log_dir_wait</u> relations in  the
       <u>[options]</u> stanza.

       The  filename  in  <u>log_filename</u>  may  contain  the following percent-expressions that will be expanded as
       follows.

       <b>%d</b>     The current day of the month

       <b>%D</b>     The current date; this is a equivalent of <b>%Y%m%d</b>

       <b>%h</b>     The hostname of the system.

       <b>%H</b>     The current hour in 24-hour format (00..23)

       <b>%m</b>     The current month as a two-digit number (01..12)

       <b>%M</b>     The current minute (00..59)

       <b>%N</b>     The name of the block device containing the file system, with any directory pathname stripped off.

       <b>%p</b>     The pid of the e2fsck process

       <b>%s</b>     The current time expressed as the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC

       <b>%S</b>     The current second (00..59)

       <b>%T</b>     The current time; this is equivalent of <b>%H%M%S</b>

       <b>%u</b>     The name of the user running e2fsck.

       <b>%U</b>     This percent expression does not expand to anything, but it signals that  any  following  date  or
              time expressions should be expressed in UTC time instead of the local timezone.

       <b>%y</b>     The last two digits of the current year (00..99)

       <b>%Y</b>     The current year (i.e., 2012).

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       The  following  recipe  will  prevent  e2fsck  from  aborting  during the boot process when a file system
       contains orphaned files.  (Of course, this is not always a good  idea,  since  critical  files  that  are
       needed  for  the  security  of the system could potentially end up in lost+found, and starting the system
       without first having a system administrator check things out may be dangerous.)

            [problems]
                 0x040002 = {
                      preen_ok = true
                      description = "@u @i %i.  "
                 }

       The following recipe will cause an e2fsck logfile to be written to the directory /var/log/e2fsck, with  a
       filename  that  contains  the device name, the hostname of the system, the date, and time: e.g., "e2fsck-
       sda3.server.INFO.20120314-112142".  If the directory containing <a href="file:/var/log">/var/log</a> is  located  on  the  root  file
       system which is initially mounted read-only, then the output will be saved in memory and written out once
       the  root file system has been remounted read/write.   To avoid too much detail from being written to the
       serial console (which could potentially slow down  the  boot  sequence),  only  print  no  more  than  16
       instances of each type of file system corruption.
