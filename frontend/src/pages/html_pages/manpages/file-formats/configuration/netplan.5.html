</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       netplan - YAML network configuration abstraction for various backends

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>netplan</b> [<u>COMMAND</u>|help]

</pre><h4><b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       See <b>netplan</b> <b>help</b> for a list of available commands on this system.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       Distribution  installers,  cloud  instantiation, image builds for particular devices, or any other way to
       deploy an operating system put its desired network configuration into YAML configuration file(s).  During
       early boot, the Netplan "network renderer" runs  which  reads  /{lib,etc,run}/netplan/*.yaml  and  writes
       configuration to <a href="file:/run">/run</a> to hand off control of devices to the specified networking daemon.

       • Configured devices get handled by systemd-networkd by default, unless explicitly marked as managed by a
         specific renderer (NetworkManager)

       • Devices not covered by the network configuration do not get touched at all.

       • Usable in initramfs (few dependencies and fast)

       • No persistent generated configuration, only original YAML configuration

       • Parser  supports  multiple  configuration  files  to  allow applications like libvirt or lxd to package
         expected network configuration (virbr0, lxdbr0),  or  to  change  the  global  default  policy  to  use
         NetworkManager for everything.

       • Retains  the  flexibility  to  change  back  ends/policy later or adjust to removing NetworkManager, as
         generated configuration is ephemeral.

   <b>General</b> <b>structure</b>
       Netplan configuration files use  the  YAML format.   All  /{lib,etc,run}/netplan/*.yaml  are  considered.
       Lexicographically  later  files  (regardless  of in which directory they are) amend (new mapping keys) or
       override (same mapping keys) previous ones.  A file in /run/netplan completely shadows a file  with  same
       name  in  <a href="file:/etc/netplan">/etc/netplan</a>,  and  a  file in either of those directories shadows a file with the same name in
       /lib/netplan.

       The top-level node in a Netplan configuration file is a network: mapping that contains  version:  2  (the
       YAML  currently  being  used by curtin, MAAS, etc.  is version 1), and then device definitions grouped by
       their type, such as ethernets:, modems:, wifis:, or bridges:.  These are the types that our renderer  can
       understand and are supported by our back ends.

       Each  type  block  contains  device  definitions as a map where the keys (called "configuration IDs") are
       defined as below.

   <b>Device</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>IDs</b>
       The key names below the per-device-type definition maps (like ethernets:) are called "ID"s.  They must be
       unique throughout the entire set of configuration files.  Their primary purpose is  to  serve  as  anchor
       names  for  composite  devices,  for example to enumerate the members of a bridge that is currently being
       defined.

       (Since 0.97) If an interface is defined with an ID in a configuration file; it will be brought up by  the
       applicable renderer.  To not have Netplan touch an interface at all, it should be completely omitted from
       the Netplan configuration files.

       There  are  two  physically/structurally  different classes of device definitions, and the ID field has a
       different interpretation for each:

       Physical devices

              (Examples: Ethernet, modem, Wi-Fi) These can dynamically come and  go  between  reboots  and  even
              during  runtime  (hot  plugging).   In  the  generic case, they can be selected by match: rules on
              desired properties, such as name/name pattern, MAC address, driver, or device paths.   In  general
              these  will  match any number of devices (unless they refer to properties which are unique such as
              the full path or MAC address), so without further knowledge about the hardware these  will  always
              be considered as a group.

              It  is  valid to specify no match rules at all, in which case the ID field is simply the interface
              name to be matched.  This is mostly useful if you want to keep simple cases simple, and  it's  how
              network device configuration has been done for a long time.

              If  there are match: rules, then the ID field is a purely opaque name which is only being used for
              references from definitions of compound devices in the configuration.

       Virtual devices

              (Examples: veth, bridge, bond, vrf) These are fully under the control of the configuration file(s)
              and the network stack.  I. e.  these devices are being created instead of  matched.   Thus  match:
              and  set-name:  are  not applicable for these, and the ID field is the name of the created virtual
              device.

</pre><h4><b>YAML</b> <b>configuration</b></h4><pre>
   <b>Top-level</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>structure</b>
       The general structure of a Netplan YAML file is shown below.

              network:
                version: NUMBER
                renderer: STRING
                bonds: MAPPING
                bridges: MAPPING
                dummy-devices: MAPPING
                ethernets: MAPPING
                modems: MAPPING
                tunnels: MAPPING
                virtual-ethernets: MAPPING
                vlans: MAPPING
                vrfs: MAPPING
                wifis: MAPPING
                nm-devices: MAPPING

       • <b>version</b> (number)

                Defines what version of the configuration format is  used.   The  only  value  supported  is  2.
                Defaults to 2 if not defined.

       • <b>renderer</b> (scalar)

                Defines what network configuration tool will be used to set up your configuration.  Valid values
                are networkd and NetworkManager.  Defaults to networkd if not defined.

       • <b>bonds</b> (mapping)

                Creates and configures link aggregation (bonding) devices.

       • <b>bridges</b> (mapping)

                Creates and configures bridge devices.

       • <b>dummy-devices</b> (mapping) – since 0.107

                Creates and configures virtual devices.

       • <b>ethernets</b> (mapping)

                Configures physical Ethernet interfaces.

       • <b>modems</b> (mapping)

                Configures modems

       • <b>tunnels</b> (mapping)

                Creates and configures different types of virtual tunnels.

       • <b>virtual-ethernets</b> (mapping) – since 0.107

                Creates and configures Virtual Ethernet (veth) devices.

       • <b>vlans</b> (mapping)

                Creates and configures VLANs.

       • <b>vrfs</b> (mapping)

                Configures Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) devices.

       • <b>wifis</b> (mapping)

                Configures physical Wi-Fi interfaces as client, adhoc or access point.

       • <b>nm-devices</b> (mapping)

                nm-devices  are  used  in situations where Netplan doesn't support the connection type.  The raw
                configuration expected by NetworkManager can be defined and will be passed as  is  (passthrough)
                to the .nmconnection file.  Users will not normally use this type of device.

       All the properties for all the device types will be described in the next sections.

   <b>Properties</b> <b>for</b> <b>physical</b> <b>device</b> <b>types</b>
       These properties are used with physical devices such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi network interfaces.

       <b>Note:</b>  Some options will not work reliably for devices matched by name only and rendered by networkd, due
       to interactions with device renaming in udev.  Match devices by MAC when setting options like:  wakeonlan
       or *-offload.

       • <b>match</b> (mapping)

                This  selects  a  subset  of  available  physical  devices  by various hardware properties.  The
                following configuration will then apply to all matching devices, as soon as  they  appear.   <u>All</u>
                specified properties must match.

         • <b>name</b> (scalar)

                  Current  interface name.  Globs are supported, and the primary use case for matching on names,
                  as selecting one fixed name can be more easily achieved with having no match: at all and  just
                  using the ID (see above).  (NetworkManager: as of v1.14.0)

         • <b>macaddress</b> (scalar)

                  6-byte  permanent  MAC  address  of  the  device in the form XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX or 20 bytes for
                  InfiniBand devices (IPoIB).  Globs are not allowed.  This doesn't match virtual MAC  addresses
                  for veth, bridge, bond, vlan, ...

         • <b>driver</b> (scalar or sequence of scalars) – sequence since 0.104

                  Kernel  driver  name,  corresponding  to  the  DRIVER  udev  property.  A sequence of globs is
                  supported, any of which must match.  Matching on driver is <u>only</u> supported with networkd.

         Examples:

         • All cards on second PCI bus:

                  network:
                    ethernets:
                      myinterface:
                        match:
                          name: enp2*

         • Fixed MAC address:

                  network:
                    ethernets:
                      interface0:
                        match:
                          macaddress: 11:22:33:AA:BB:FF

         • First card of driver ixgbe:

                  network:
                    ethernets:
                      nic0:
                        match:
                          driver: ixgbe
                          name: en*s0

         • First card with a driver matching bcmgenet or smsc*:

                  network:
                    ethernets:
                      nic0:
                        match:
                          driver: ["bcmgenet", "smsc*"]
                          name: en*

       • <b>set-name</b> (scalar)

                When matching on unique properties such as path or MAC, or with additional assumptions  such  as
                "there  will  only ever be one Wi-Fi device", match rules can be written so that they only match
                one device.  Then this property can be used to give that device a  more  specific  or  desirable
                name  than  the default from udev ifnames.  Any additional device that satisfies the match rules
                will then fail to get renamed and keep the original kernel name (and dmesg will show an error).

       • <b>wakeonlan</b> (boolean)

                Enable wake on LAN.  Off by default.

       • <b>emit-lldp</b> (boolean) – since 0.99

                (networkd back end only) Whether to emit LLDP packets.  Off by default.

       • <b>receive-checksum-offload</b> (boolean) – since 0.104

                (networkd back end only) If set to true  (false),  the  hardware  offload  for  checksumming  of
                ingress network packets is enabled (disabled).  When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

       • <b>transmit-checksum-offload</b> (boolean) – since 0.104

                (networkd back end only) If set to true (false), the hardware offload for checksumming of egress
                network packets is enabled (disabled).  When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

       • <b>tcp-segmentation-offload</b> (boolean) – since 0.104

                (networkd  back  end only) If set to true (false), the TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO) is enabled
                (disabled).  When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

       • <b>tcp6-segmentation-offload</b> (boolean) – since 0.104

                (networkd  back  end  only)  If  set  to   true   (false),   the   TCP6   Segmentation   Offload
                (tx-tcp6-segmentation) is enabled (disabled).  When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

       • <b>generic-segmentation-offload</b> (boolean) – since 0.104

                (networkd  back  end  only)  If  set  to true (false), the Generic Segmentation Offload (GSO) is
                enabled (disabled).  When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

       • <b>generic-receive-offload</b> (boolean) – since 0.104

                (networkd back end only) If set to true (false), the Generic Receive Offload  (GRO)  is  enabled
                (disabled).  When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

       • <b>large-receive-offload</b> (boolean) – since 0.104

                (networkd  back  end  only)  If  set to true (false), the Large Receive Offload (LRO) is enabled
                (disabled).  When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

       • <b>openvswitch</b> (mapping) – since 0.100

                This provides additional configuration for the openvswitch network device.  If Open  vSwitch  is
                not  available  on  the  system,  Netplan treats the presence of openvswitch configuration as an
                error.

                Any supported network device that is declared with the openvswitch mapping (or  any  bond/bridge
                that  includes  an  interface  with an openvswitch configuration) will be created in openvswitch
                instead of the defined renderer.  In the case of  a  vlan  definition  declared  the  same  way,
                Netplan will create a fake VLAN bridge in openvswitch with the requested vlan properties.

         • <b>external-ids</b> (mapping) – since 0.100

                  Passed-through directly to Open vSwitch

         • <b>other-config</b> (mapping) – since 0.100

                  Passed-through directly to Open vSwitch

         • <b>lacp</b> (scalar) – since 0.100

                  Valid for bond interfaces.  Accepts active, passive or off (the default).

         • <b>fail-mode</b> (scalar) – since 0.100

                  Valid for bridge interfaces.  Accepts secure or standalone (the default).

         • <b>mcast-snooping</b> (boolean) – since 0.100

                  Valid for bridge interfaces.  False by default.

         • <b>protocols</b> (sequence of scalars) – since 0.100

                  Valid  for  bridge  interfaces  or  the  network  section.   List of protocols to be used when
                  negotiating a connection with the controller.   Accepts  OpenFlow10,  OpenFlow11,  OpenFlow12,
                  OpenFlow13, OpenFlow14, and OpenFlow15.

         • <b>rstp</b> (boolean) – since 0.100

                  Valid for bridge interfaces.  False by default.

         • <b>controller</b> (mapping) – since 0.100

                  Valid for bridge interfaces.  Specify an external OpenFlow controller.

           • <b>addresses</b> (sequence of scalars)

                    Set  the list of addresses to use for the controller targets.  The syntax of these addresses
                    is   as    defined    in    <b><a href="../man8/ovs-vsctl.8.html">ovs-vsctl</a></b>(8).     Example:    addresses:    [tcp:127.0.0.1:6653,
                    "ssl:[fe80::1234%eth0]:6653"].

           • <b>connection-mode</b> (scalar)

                    Set  the connection mode for the controller.  Supported options are in-band and out-of-band.
                    The default is in-band.

         • <b>ports</b> (sequence of sequence of scalars) – since 0.100

                  Open vSwitch patch ports.  Each port is declared as a pair of names which can be referenced as
                  interfaces in dependent virtual devices (bonds, bridges).

           Example:

                  openvswitch:
                    ports:
                      - [patch0-1, patch1-0]

         • <b>ssl</b> (mapping) – since 0.100

                  Valid for global openvswitch settings.  Options for configuring SSL server  endpoint  for  the
                  switch.

           • <b>ca-cert</b> (scalar)

                    Path to a file containing the CA certificate to be used.

           • <b>certificate</b> (scalar)

                    Path to a file containing the server certificate.

           • <b>private-key</b> (scalar)

                    Path to a file containing the private key for the server.

   <b>Properties</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>device</b> <b>types</b>
       • <b>renderer</b> (scalar)

                Use  the  given  networking  back end for this definition.  Currently supported are networkd and
                NetworkManager.  This property can be specified globally in network:, for a device type (in e.g.
                ethernets:) or for a particular device definition.  Default is networkd.

                (Since 0.99) The renderer property has one additional acceptable value for  VLAN  objects  (i.e.
                defined  in  vlans:): sriov.  If a VLAN is defined with the sriov renderer for an SR-IOV Virtual
                Function interface, this causes Netplan to set up a hardware VLAN filter for it.  There  can  be
                only one defined per VF.

       • <b>dhcp4</b> (boolean)

                Enable DHCP for IPv4.  Off by default.

       • <b>dhcp6</b> (boolean)

                Enable  DHCP for IPv6.  Off by default.  This covers both stateless DHCP - where the DHCP server
                supplies information like DNS name servers but not the IP address - and stateful DHCP, where the
                server provides both the address and the other information.

                If you are in an IPv6-only environment with completely stateless auto-configuration (SLAAC  with
                RDNSS),  this  option  can  be  set to cause the interface to be brought up.  (Setting accept-ra
                alone is not sufficient.)  Auto-configuration will still  honour  the  contents  of  the  router
                advertisement and only use DHCP if requested in the RA.

                Note  that  <b><a href="../man8/rdnssd.8.html">rdnssd</a></b>(8) is required to use RDNSS with networkd.  No extra software is required for
                NetworkManager.

       • <b>ipv6-mtu</b> (scalar) – since 0.98 &gt; Set the IPv6 MTU (only supported with networkd back end).  Note &gt; that
         needing to set this is an unusual requirement.  &gt; &gt; <b>Requires</b> <b>feature:</b> <b>ipv6-mtu</b>

       • <b>ipv6-privacy</b> (boolean)

                Enable IPv6 Privacy Extensions (RFC 4941) for the  specified  interface,  and  prefer  temporary
                addresses.   Defaults  to  false  -  no privacy extensions.  There is currently no way to have a
                private address but prefer the public address.

       • <b>link-local</b> (sequence of scalars)

                Configure the link-local addresses to  bring  up.   Valid  options  are  ipv4  and  ipv6,  which
                respectively  allow enabling IPv4 and IPv6 link local addressing.  If this field is not defined,
                the default is to enable only IPv6 link-local addresses.  If the field is defined but configured
                as an empty set, IPv6 link-local addresses are disabled as well as IPv4 link- local addresses.

                This  feature  enables  or  disables  link-local  addresses  for  a  protocol,  but  the  actual
                implementation  differs  per back end.  On networkd, this directly changes the behaviour and may
                add an extra address on  an  interface.   When  using  the  NetworkManager  back  end,  enabling
                link-local has no effect if the interface also has DHCP enabled.

         Examples:

         • Enable only IPv4 link-local: link-local: [ ipv4 ]

         • Enable all link-local addresses: link-local: [ ipv4, ipv6 ]

         • Disable all link-local addresses: link-local: [ ]

       • <b>ignore-carrier</b> (boolean) – since 0.104

                (networkd  back  end  only)  Allow  the  specified  interface to be configured even if it has no
                carrier.

       • <b>critical</b> (boolean)

                Designate the connection as "critical to the system", meaning that special care will be taken by
                to not release the assigned IP when the daemon is restarted.  (not recognised by NetworkManager)

       • <b>dhcp-identifier</b> (scalar)

                (networkd back end only) Sets the source of DHCP (v4) client identifier.  If mac  is  specified,
                the  MAC  address  of  the  link  is  used.  If this option is omitted, or if duid is specified,
                networkd will generate an RFC4361-compliant client identifier for the interface by combining the
                link's IAID and DUID.

       • <b>dhcp4-overrides</b> (mapping)

                (networkd back end only) Overrides default DHCP behaviour; see the DHCP Overrides section below.

       • <b>dhcp6-overrides</b> (mapping)

                (networkd back end only) Overrides default DHCP behaviour; see the DHCP Overrides section below.

       • <b>accept-ra</b> (boolean)

                Accept Router Advertisement that would have the kernel configure IPv6 by itself.  When  enabled,
                accept Router Advertisements.  When disabled, do not respond to Router Advertisements.  If unset
                use the host kernel default setting.

       • <b>ra-overrides</b> (mapping) – since 1.1

                (networkd  back  end  only)  Overrides default IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) behaviour; see the
                IPv6 Router Advertisement Overrides section below.

       • <b>addresses</b> (sequence of scalars and mappings)

                Add static addresses to the interface in addition to the ones received through DHCP or RA.  Each
                sequence entry is in CIDR notation, i.e.  of the form addr/prefixlen.  addr is an IPv4  or  IPv6
                address as recognised by <b><a href="../man3/inet_pton.3.html">inet_pton</a></b>(3) and prefixlen the number of bits of the subnet.

                For  virtual  devices  (bridges,  bonds,  VLAN)  if  there  is no address configured and DHCP is
                disabled, the interface may still be brought online,  but  will  not  be  addressable  from  the
                network.

                In  addition  to  the addresses themselves one can specify configuration parameters as mappings.
                Current supported options are:

         • <b>lifetime</b> (scalar) – since 0.100

                  Default: forever.  This can be forever or 0 and corresponds to the PreferredLifetime option in
                  the Address section of systemd-networkd.  Currently supported on the networkd back end only.

         • <b>label</b> (scalar) – since 0.100

                  An IP address label, equivalent to the ip address label command.  Currently supported  on  the
                  networkd back end only.

         Examples:

         • Simple: addresses: [192.168.14.2/24, "2001:1::1/64"]

         • Advanced:

                  network:
                    ethernets:
                      eth0:
                        addresses:
                          - "10.0.0.15/24":
                              lifetime: 0
                              label: "maas"
                          - "2001:1::1/64"

       • <b>ipv6-address-generation</b> (scalar) – since 0.99

                Configure  method  for  creating  the  address  for  use  with  RFC4862  IPv6  Stateless Address
                Auto-configuration.  Possible values are eui64 or stable-privacy.

       • <b>ipv6-address-token</b> (scalar) – since 0.100

                Define an IPv6 address token for creating a  static  interface  identifier  for  IPv6  Stateless
                Address Auto-configuration.  This is mutually exclusive with ipv6-address-generation.

       • <b>gateway4</b>, <b>gateway6</b> (scalar)

                Deprecated,   see   Default  routes.   Set  default  gateway  for  IPv4/6,  for  manual  address
                configuration.  This requires setting addresses too.  Gateway IP addresses must  be  in  a  form
                recognised  by <b><a href="../man3/inet_pton.3.html">inet_pton</a></b>(3).  There should only be a single gateway per IP address family set in
                your global configuration, to make it unambiguous.  If you need multiple default routes,  please
                define them via routing-policy.

         Examples

         • IPv4: gateway4: 172.16.0.1

         • IPv6: gateway6: "2001:4::1"

       • <b>nameservers</b> (mapping)

                Set  DNS  servers and search domains, for manual address configuration.  There are two supported
                fields: addresses: is a list of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses similar to gateway*,  and  search:  is  a
                list of search domains.

         Example:

                network:
                  ethernets:
                    id0:
                      [...]
                      nameservers:
                        search: [lab, home]
                        addresses: [8.8.8.8, "FEDC::1"]

       • <b>macaddress</b> (scalar)

                Set  the  device's  MAC  address.  The MAC address must be in the form "XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX".  The
                following special options are also  accepted:  permanent  and  random.   In  addition  to  these
                options, the NetworkManager renderer also accepts stable, stable-ssid (Wi-Fi only) and preserve.

                <b>Note:</b> This will not work reliably for devices matched by name only and rendered by networkd, due
                to interactions with device renaming in udev.  Match devices by MAC when setting MAC addresses.

         Example:

                network:
                  ethernets:
                    id0:
                      match:
                        macaddress: 52:54:00:6b:3c:58
                      [...]
                      macaddress: 52:54:00:6b:3c:59

       • <b>mtu</b> (scalar)

                Set  the Maximum Transmission Unit for the interface.  The default is 1500.  Valid values depend
                on your network interface.

                <b>Note:</b> This will not work reliably for devices matched by name only and rendered by networkd, due
                to interactions with device renaming in udev.  Match devices by MAC when setting MTU.

       • <b>optional</b> (boolean)

                An optional device is not required for booting.  Normally, networkd  will  wait  some  time  for
                device  to  become configured before proceeding with booting.  However, if a device is marked as
                optional, networkd will not wait for it.  This is <u>only</u> supported by networkd, and the default is
                false.

         Example:

                network:
                  ethernets:
                    eth7:
                      # this is plugged into a test network that is often
                      # down - don't wait for it to come up during boot.
                      dhcp4: true
                      optional: true

       • <b>optional-addresses</b> (sequence of scalars)

                Specify types of addresses that are not required for a device to  be  considered  online.   This
                changes  the  behaviour of back ends at boot time to avoid waiting for addresses that are marked
                optional, and thus consider the interface as "usable"  sooner.   This  does  not  disable  these
                addresses, which will be brought up anyway.

         Example:

                network:
                  ethernets:
                    eth7:
                      dhcp4: true
                      dhcp6: true
                      optional-addresses: [ ipv4-ll, dhcp6 ]

       • <b>activation-mode</b> (scalar) – since 0.103

                Allows  specifying  the management policy of the selected interface.  By default, Netplan brings
                up any configured interface if possible.  Using the activation-mode setting users  can  override
                that behaviour by either specifying manual, to hand over control over the interface state to the
                administrator  or  (for  networkd  back  end  <u>only</u>) off to force the link in a down state at all
                times.  Any interface with activation-mode defined is implicitly considered optional.  Supported
                officially as of networkd v248+.

         Example:

                network:
                  ethernets:
                    eth1:
                      # this interface will not be put into an UP state automatically
                      dhcp4: true
                      activation-mode: manual

       • <b>routes</b> (sequence of mappings)

                Configure static routing for the device; see the Routing section below.

       • <b>routing-policy</b> (sequence of mappings)

                Configure policy routing for the device; see the Routing section below.

       • <b>neigh-suppress</b> (scalar) – since 0.105

                Takes a boolean.  Configures whether ARP and ND neighbour suppression is enabled for this bridge
                port.  When unset, the kernel's default will be used.

       • <b>hairpin</b> (scalar) – since <b>1.0</b>

                Takes a boolean.  Configures whether traffic may be sent back out of the bridge port on which it
                was received.  When this flag is false, then the bridge does not forward traffic back out of the
                receiving port.  When unset, the back end default is used.

       • <b>port-mac-learning</b> (scalar) – since <b>1.0</b>

                Takes a boolean.  Configures whether MAC address learning is enabled for this bridge port.  When
                unset, the kernel default is used.  Currently supported on the networkd back end only.

   <b>DHCP</b> <b>Overrides</b>
       Several DHCP behaviour overrides are available.  Most currently only  have  any  effect  when  using  the
       networkd back end, with the exception of use-routes and route-metric.

       Overrides only have an effect if the corresponding dhcp4 or dhcp6 is set to true.

       If both dhcp4 and dhcp6 are true, the networkd back end requires that dhcp4-overrides and dhcp6-overrides
       contain  the  same  keys  and values.  If the values do not match, an error will be shown and the network
       configuration will not be applied.

       When using the NetworkManager back end,  different  values  may  be  specified  for  dhcp4-overrides  and
       dhcp6-overrides, and will be applied to the DHCP client processes as specified in the Netplan YAML.

       • <b>dhcp4-overrides</b>, <b>dhcp6-overrides</b> (mapping)

                The dhcp4-overrides and dhcp6-override mappings override the default DHCP behaviour.

         • <b>use-dns</b> (boolean)

                  Default: true.  When true, the DNS servers received from the DHCP server will be used and take
                  precedence  over any statically configured ones.  Currently only has an effect on the networkd
                  back end.

         • <b>use-ntp</b> (boolean)

                  Default: true.  When true, the NTP servers received from the  DHCP  server  will  be  used  by
                  systemd-timesyncd and take precedence over any statically configured ones.  Currently only has
                  an effect on the networkd back end.

         • <b>send-hostname</b> (boolean)

                  Default:  true.   When  true, the machine hostname will be sent to the DHCP server.  Currently
                  only has an effect on the networkd back end.

         • <b>use-hostname</b> (boolean)

                  Default: true.  When true, the hostname received from the DHCP  server  will  be  set  as  the
                  transient hostname of the system.  Currently only has an effect on the networkd back end.

         • <b>use-mtu</b> (boolean)

                  Default: true.  When true, the MTU received from the DHCP server will be set as the MTU of the
                  network  interface.   When  false,  the  MTU  advertised  by  the DHCP server will be ignored.
                  Currently only has an effect on the networkd back end.

         • <b>hostname</b> (scalar)

                  Use this value for the hostname which is  sent  to  the  DHCP  server,  instead  of  machine's
                  hostname.  Currently only has an effect on the networkd back end.

         • <b>use-routes</b> (boolean)

                  Default:  true.   When true, the routes received from the DHCP server will be installed in the
                  routing table normally.  When set to false, routes from the DHCP server will  be  ignored:  in
                  this  case,  the user is responsible for adding static routes if necessary for correct network
                  operation.  This allows users to avoid installing a default gateway for interfaces  configured
                  via DHCP.  Available for both the networkd and NetworkManager back ends.

         • <b>route-metric</b> (scalar)

                  Use  this  value  for  default  metric for automatically-added routes.  Use this to prioritise
                  routes for devices by setting a lower metric on a preferred interface.  Available for both the
                  networkd and NetworkManager back ends.

         • <b>use-domains</b> (scalar) – since 0.98

                  Takes a boolean, or the special value route.  When true, the domain  name  received  from  the
                  DHCP  server  will  be  used as DNS search domain over this link, similar to the effect of the
                  Domains= setting.  If set to route, the domain name received from the DHCP server will be used
                  for routing DNS queries only, but not for searching, similar to the  effect  of  the  Domains=
                  setting when the argument is prefixed with ~ (tilde).

                  <b>Requires</b> <b>feature:</b> <b>dhcp-use-domains</b>

   <b>IPv6</b> <b>Router</b> <b>Advertisement</b> <b>Overrides</b>
       Overrides for IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) behaviour (only supported with networkd back end).

       • <b>ra-overrides</b> (mapping) – since 1.1

                The ra-overrides mappings override the default IPv6 Router Advertisement behaviour.

         • <b>use-dns</b> (boolean)

                  Default:  true.   When  true,  the  DNS servers received from the Router Advertisement will be
                  used.  Currently only has an effect on the networkd back end.

         • <b>use-domains</b> (scalar)

                  Takes a boolean, or the special value route.  When true, the domain  name  received  from  the
                  Router  Advertisement  will be used as DNS search domain over this link.  If set to route, the
                  domain name received from the IPv6 RA will be used for routing DNS queries only, but  not  for
                  searching.  Defaults to false.

         • <b>table</b> (scalar)

                  The  routing  table  number  for  routes received in the IPv6 RA.  Allowed values are positive
                  integers starting from 1.  Some values are already in use to refer to specific routing tables:
                  see {<a href="file:/etc">/etc</a>,<a href="file:/usr/share">/usr/share</a>}/iproute2/rt_tables.

   <b>Routing</b>
       Complex routing is possible with Netplan.  Standard static routes as well as policy routing using routing
       tables are supported via the networkd back end.

       These options are available for all types of interfaces.

   <b>Default</b> <b>routes</b>
       The most common need for routing concerns the definition of default routes to reach the  wider  internet.
       Those default routes can only defined once per IP family and routing table.  A typical example would look
       like the following:

              network:
                ethernets:
                  eth0:
                    [...]
                    routes:
                      - to: default # could be 0.0.0.0/0 optionally
                        via: 10.0.0.1
                        metric: 100
                        on-link: true
                        advertised-mss: 1400
                      - to: default # could be ::/0 optionally
                        via: cf02:de:ad:be:ef::2
                  eth1:
                    [...]
                    routes:
                      - to: default
                        via: 172.134.67.1
                        metric: 100
                        on-link: true
                        # Not on the main routing table,
                        # does not conflict with the eth0 default route
                    table: 76

       • <b>routes</b> (mapping)

                The  routes  block  defines  standard  static  routes  for  an  interface.   At least to must be
                specified.  If type is local or nat a default scope of host is assumed.  If type is unicast  and
                no  gateway (via) is given or type is broadcast, multicast or anycast a default scope of link is
                assumed.  Otherwise, a global scope is the default setting.

                For from, to and via, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are recognised,  and  must  be  in  the  form
                addr/prefixlen or addr.

         • <b>from</b> (scalar)

                  Set a source IP address for traffic going through the route.  (NetworkManager: as of v1.8.0)

         • <b>to</b> (scalar)

                  Destination address for the route.

         • <b>via</b> (scalar)

         • <b>table</b> (scalar)

                  The table number to use for the route.  In some scenarios, it may be useful to set routes in a
                  separate  routing  table.   It  may  also  be used to refer to routing policy rules which also
                  accept a table parameter.  Allowed values are positive integers starting from 1.  Some  values
                  are  already  in  use  to  refer  to  specific  routing  tables:  see /etc/iproute2/rt_tables.

                  device MTU.  Must be a positive integer.

       • <b>routing-policy</b> (mapping)

                The routing-policy block defines extra routing policy  for  a  network,  where  traffic  may  be
                handled specially based on the source IP, firewall marking, etc.

                For  from,  to,  both  IPv4  and  IPv6  addresses  are  recognised,  and  must  be  in  the form

                  a separate routing table.  It may also be used to refer to routes which also  accept  a  table
                  parameter.   Allowed values are positive integers starting from 1.  Some values are already in
                  use to refer to specific routing tables: see /etc/iproute2/rt_tables.

         • <b>priority</b> (scalar)

                  Specify a priority for the routing policy rule, to influence the order in which routing  rules
                  are  processed.   A  higher  number  means  lower  priority:  rules  are processed in order by
                  increasing priority number.  Specifying an explicit, unique, priority for each routing  policy
                  rule is strongly recommended and is mandatory on the NetworkManager back-end.

         • <b>mark</b> (scalar)

       (yaml-auth)= ## Authentication

       Netplan supports advanced  authentication  settings  for  Ethernet  and  Wi-Fi  interfaces,  as  well  as
       individual Wi-Fi networks, by means of the auth block.

       • <b>auth</b> (mapping)

                Specifies authentication settings for a device of type ethernets:, or an access-points: entry on
                a wifis: device.

                The auth block supports the following properties:

         • <b>key-management</b> (scalar)

                  The supported key management modes are none (no key management); psk (WPA with pre-shared key,
                  common for home Wi-Fi); psk-sha256 (WPA2 with pre-shared key, common for home Wi-Fi); eap (WPA
                  with   EAP,   common   for   enterprise   Wi-Fi);   eap-sha256  (used  with  WPA3-Enterprise);
                  eap-suite-b-192 (used with WPA3-Enterprise); sae (used by WPA3); and  802.1x  (used  primarily

         • <b>method</b> (scalar)

                  The  EAP  method  to use.  The supported EAP methods are tls (TLS), peap (Protected EAP), leap
                  (Lightweight EAP), pwd (EAP Password) and ttls (Tunnelled TLS).

         • <b>identity</b> (scalar)

                  The identity to use for EAP.

         • <b>anonymous-identity</b> (scalar)

                  The identity to pass over the unencrypted channel if the chosen EAP method supports passing  a
                  different tunnelled identity.

         • <b>ca-certificate</b> (scalar)

   <b>Properties</b> <b>for</b> <b>device</b> <b>type</b> ethernets
       <b>Status</b>: Optional.

       <b>Purpose</b>: Use the ethernets key to configure Ethernet interfaces.

       <b>Structure</b>:  The  key  consists  of  a  mapping  of Ethernet interface IDs.  Each ethernet has a number of
       configuration options.  You don't need to define each  interface  by  their  name  inside  the  ethernets
       mapping.   You  can  use  any ID that describes the interface and match the actual network card using the
       match key.  The general configuration structure for Ethernet is shown below.

              network:
                ethernets:
                  device-id:
                    ...

       device-id is the interface identifier.  If you use the interface name as the ID, Netplan will match  that
       interface.

       Consider the example below.  In this case, an interface called eth0 will be configured with DHCP.

              network:
                ethernets:
                  eth0:
                    dhcp4: true

       The  device-id  can  be  any descriptive name your find meaningful.  Although, if it doesn't match a real
       interface name, you must use the property match to identify the device you want to configure.

       The example below defines an Ethernet connection called isp-interface (supposedly an  external  interface
       connected  to  the  Internet  Service Provider) and uses match to apply the configuration to the physical
       device with MAC address aa:bb:cc:00:11:22.

              network:
                ethernets:
                  isp-interface:
                    match:
                      macaddress: aa:bb:cc:00:11:22
                    dhcp4: true

       Ethernet device definitions, beyond common ones described above, also support some additional  properties
       that can be used for SR-IOV devices.

       • <b>link</b> (scalar) – since 0.99

                (SR-IOV  devices  only)  The  link  property  declares  the  device as a Virtual Function of the
                selected Physical Function device, as identified by the given Netplan ID.

         Example:

                network:
                  ethernets:
                    enp1: {...}
                    enp1s16f1:
                      link: enp1

       • <b>virtual-function-count</b> (scalar) – since 0.99

                (SR-IOV devices only) In certain special cases VFs  might  need  to  be  configured  outside  of
                Netplan.   For  such  configurations  virtual-function-count  can  be  optionally used to set an
                explicit number of Virtual Functions for the given Physical Function.  If unset, the default  is
                to create only as many VFs as are defined in the Netplan configuration.  This should be used for
                special cases only.

                <b>Requires</b> <b>feature:</b> <b>sriov</b>

       • <b>embedded-switch-mode</b> (scalar) – since 0.104

                (SR-IOV devices only) Change the operational mode of the embedded switch of a supported SmartNIC
                PCI device (e.g.  Mellanox ConnectX-5).  Possible values are switchdev or legacy, if unspecified
                the vendor's default configuration is used.

                <b>Requires</b> <b>feature:</b> <b>eswitch-mode</b>

       • <b>delay-virtual-functions-rebind</b> (boolean) – since 0.104

                (SR-IOV  devices  only) Delay rebinding of SR-IOV virtual functions to its driver after changing
                the embedded-switch-mode setting to a later stage.  Can be enabled when  bonding/VF  LAG  is  in
                use.  Defaults to false.

                <b>Requires</b> <b>feature:</b> <b>eswitch-mode</b>

       • <b>infiniband-mode</b> (scalar) – since 0.105

                (InfiniBand  devices  only)  Change the operational mode of a IPoIB device.  Possible values are
                datagram or connected.  If unspecified the kernel's default configuration is used.

                <b>Requires</b> <b>feature:</b> <b>infiniband</b>

       (yaml-modems)= ## Properties for device type modems

       <b>Status</b>: Optional.

       <b>Purpose</b>: Use the modems key  to  configure  modem  interfaces.   GSM/CDMA  modem  configuration  is  only
       supported for the NetworkManager back end.  systemd-networkd does not support modems.

       <b>Structure</b>: The key consists of a mapping of modem IDs.  Each modem has a number of configuration options.
       The general configuration structure for Modems is shown below.

              network:

                device-id which contains a SIM card matching the given identifier.

       • <b>sim-operator-id</b> (scalar) – since 0.99

                Specify  the  MCC/MNC  string  (such  as 310260 or 21601) which identifies the carrier that this
                connection should apply to.  If given, the connection will apply to any device also  allowed  by

   <b>Properties</b> <b>for</b> <b>device</b> <b>type</b> wifis
       <b>Status</b>: Optional.

       <b>Purpose</b>: Use the wifis key to configure Wi-Fi access points.

       <b>Structure</b>: The key consists of a mapping of Wi-Fi IDs.  Each wifi has a number of configuration  options.
       The general configuration structure for Wi-Fi is shown below.

              network:
                version: 2
                wifis:
                  wlp0s1:

                      "network_ssid_name":
                        password: "**********"

       Note that systemd-networkd does not have native support Wi-Fi, so you need wpasupplicant installed if you
       let the networkd renderer handle Wi-Fi.

       • <b>access-points</b> (mapping)

                This  provides  pre-configured  connections  to  NetworkManager.   Note that users can of course
                select other access points/SSIDs.  The keys of the mapping are the SSIDs,  and  the  values  are
                mappings with the following supported properties:

         • <b>password</b> (scalar)

                  Enable  WPA/WPA2  authentication  and  set the passphrase for it.  If neither this nor an auth
                  block are given, the network is assumed to be open.  The setting

                         password: "S3kr1t"

                  is equivalent to

                         auth:
                           key-management: psk
                           password: "S3kr1t"

         • <b>mode</b> (scalar)

                  Possible access point modes are infrastructure (the default), ap (create an  access  point  to
                  which  other  devices  can connect), and adhoc (peer to peer networks without a central access
                  point).  ap is only supported with NetworkManager.

         • <b>bssid</b> (scalar) – since 0.99

                  If specified, directs the device to only associate with the given access point.

         • <b>band</b> (scalar) – since 0.99

                  Possible bands are 5GHz (for 5GHz 802.11a) and 2.4GHz (for 2.4GHz 802.11), do not restrict the
                  802.11 frequency band of the network if unset (the default).

         • <b>channel</b> (scalar) – since 0.99

                  Wireless channel to use for the Wi-Fi connection.  Because  channel  numbers  overlap  between
                  bands, this property takes effect only if the band property is also set.

         • <b>hidden</b> (boolean) – since 0.100

                  Set  to  true to change the SSID scan technique for connecting to hidden Wi-Fi networks.  Note
                  this may have slower performance compared to false (the default) when connecting  to  publicly
                  broadcast SSIDs.

       • <b>wakeonwlan</b> (sequence of scalars) – since 0.99

                This  enables WakeOnWLan on supported devices.  Not all drivers support all options.  May be any
                combination   of    any,    disconnect,    magic_pkt,    gtk_rekey_failure,    eap_identity_req,
                four_way_handshake,  rfkill_release or tcp (NetworkManager only).  Or the exclusive default flag
                (the default).

       • <b>regulatory-domain</b> (scalar) – since 0.105

                This can be used to define the radio's regulatory  domain,  to  make  use  of  additional  Wi-Fi
                channels  outside  the  "world  domain".  Takes an ISO/ IEC 3166 country code (like GB) or 00 to
                reset              to              the              "world             domain".              See

                    ...

       When applied, a virtual interface of type bridge called br0 will be created in the system.

       The specific settings for bridges are defined below.

       • <b>interfaces</b> (sequence of scalars)

                All devices matching this ID list will be added to the bridge.  This may be an  empty  list,  in
                which case the bridge will be brought online with no member interfaces.

         Example:

                network:
                  ethernets:
                    switchports:
                      match: {name: "enp2*"}
                  [...]
                  bridges:
                    br0:
                      interfaces: [switchports]

       • <b>parameters</b> (mapping)

                Customisation  parameters for special bridging options.  Time intervals may need to be expressed
                as a number of seconds  or  milliseconds:  the  default  value  type  is  specified  below.   If
                necessary,  time  intervals  can be qualified using a time suffix (such as s for seconds, ms for
                milliseconds) to allow for more control over its behaviour.

         • <b>ageing-time</b>, <b>aging-time</b> (scalar)

                  Set the period of time to keep a MAC address in the forwarding  database  after  a  packet  is
                  received.  This maps to the AgeingTimeSec= property when the networkd renderer is used.  If no
                  time suffix is specified, the value will be interpreted as seconds.

         • <b>priority</b> (scalar)

                  Set  the  priority  value  for the bridge.  This value should be a number between 0 and 65535.
                  Lower values mean higher priority.  The bridge with the higher priority will be elected as the
                  root bridge.

         • <b>port-priority</b> (mapping)

                  Set the port priority per interface.  The priority value is a number between 0 and  63.   This
                  metric is used in the designated port and root port selection algorithms.

           Example:

                  network:
                    ethernets:
                      eth0:
                        dhcp4: false
                      eth1:
                        dhcp4: false
                    bridges:
                      br0:
                        interfaces: [eth0, eth1]
                        parameters:
                          port-priority:
                            eth0: 10
                            eth1: 20

         • <b>forward-delay</b> (scalar)

                  Specify  the  period  of  time  the bridge will remain in Listening and Learning states before
                  getting to the Forwarding state.  This field maps to the  ForwardDelaySec=  property  for  the
                  networkd renderer.  If no time suffix is specified, the value will be interpreted as seconds.

         • <b>hello-time</b> (scalar)

                  Specify  the  interval  between  two hello packets being sent out from the root and designated
                  bridges.  Hello packets communicate information about the network topology.  When the networkd
                  renderer is used, this maps to the HelloTimeSec= property.  If no time  suffix  is  specified,
                  the value will be interpreted as seconds.

         • <b>max-age</b> (scalar)

                  Set the maximum age of a hello packet.  If the last hello packet is older than that value, the
                  bridge  will attempt to become the root bridge.  This maps to the MaxAgeSec= property when the
                  networkd renderer is used.  If no time suffix is specified, the value will be  interpreted  as
                  seconds.

         • <b>path-cost</b> (mapping)

                  Set  the  per-interface  cost  of a path on the bridge.  Faster interfaces should have a lower
                  cost.  This allows a finer control on the network topology  so  that  the  fastest  paths  are
                  available whenever possible.

           Example:

                  network:
                    ethernets:
                      eth0:
                        dhcp4: false
                      eth1:
                        dhcp4: false
                    bridges:
                      br0:
                        interfaces: [eth0, eth1]
                        parameters:
                          path-cost:
                            eth0: 100
                            eth1: 200

         • <b>stp</b> (boolean)

                  Define whether the bridge should use Spanning Tree Protocol.  The default value is true, which
                  means that Spanning Tree should be used.

   <b>Properties</b> <b>for</b> <b>device</b> <b>type</b> dummy-devices
       <b>Status</b>: Optional.

       <b>Purpose</b>: Use the dummy-devices key to create virtual interfaces.

       <b>Structure</b>:  The key consists of a mapping of interface names.  Dummy devices are virtual devices that can
       be used to route packets to without actually transmitting them.

              network:
                dummy-devices:
                  dm0:
                    addresses:
                      - 192.168.0.123/24
                    ...

       When applied, a virtual interface called dm0 will be created in the system.

       See the "Properties for all device types" section for the list of properties that can be used  with  this
       type of interface.

   <b>Properties</b> <b>for</b> <b>device</b> <b>type</b> bonds
       <b>Status</b>: Optional.

       <b>Purpose</b>: Use the bonds key to create Bond (Link Aggregation) interfaces.

       <b>Structure</b>:  The  key  consists  of  a mapping of Bond interface names.  Each bond has an optional list of
       interfaces that will be part of the aggregation.  The interfaces listed in the interfaces key  must  also
       be defined in your Netplan configuration.  The general configuration structure for Bonds is shown below.

              network:
                bonds:
                  bond0:
                    interfaces:
                      - enp5s0
                      - enp5s1
                      - enp5s2
                    parameters:
                      mode: active-backup
                    ...

       When applied, a virtual interface of type bond called bond0 will be created in the system.

       The specific settings for bonds are defined below.

       • <b>interfaces</b> (sequence of scalars)

                All devices matching this ID list will be added to the bond.

         Example:

                network:
                  ethernets:
                    switchports:
                      match: {name: "enp2*"}
                  [...]
                  bonds:
                    bond0:
                      interfaces: [switchports]

       • <b>parameters</b> (mapping)

                Customisation  parameters  for special bonding options.  Time intervals may need to be expressed
                as a number of seconds  or  milliseconds:  the  default  value  type  is  specified  below.   If
                necessary,  time  intervals  can be qualified using a time suffix (such as s for seconds, ms for
                milliseconds) to allow for more control over its behaviour.

         • <b>mode</b> (scalar)

                  Set the bonding mode used for the  interfaces.   The  default  is  balance-rr  (round  robin).
                  Possible  values  are  balance-rr, active-backup, balance-xor, broadcast, 802.3ad, balance-tlb
                  and balance-alb.  For Open vSwitch active-backup and  the  additional  modes  balance-tcp  and
                  balance-slb are supported.

         • <b>lacp-rate</b> (scalar)

                  Set the rate at which LACPDUs are transmitted.  This is only useful in 802.3ad mode.  Possible
                  values are slow (30 seconds, default), and fast (every second).

         • <b>mii-monitor-interval</b> (scalar)

                  Specifies the interval for MII monitoring (verifying if an interface of the bond has carrier).
                  The  default  is  0;  which disables MII monitoring.  This is equivalent to the MIIMonitorSec=
                  field for the networkd back  end.   If  no  time  suffix  is  specified,  the  value  will  be
                  interpreted as milliseconds.

         • <b>min-links</b> (scalar)

                  The minimum number of links up in a bond to consider the bond interface to be up.

         • <b>transmit-hash-policy</b> (scalar)

                  Specifies  the  transmit  hash  policy  for  the  selection  of ports.  This is only useful in
                  balance-xor, 802.3ad and balance-tlb modes.  Possible values are layer2,  layer3+4,  layer2+3,
                  encap2+3 and encap3+4.

         • <b>ad-select</b> (scalar)

                  Set  the  aggregation  selection mode.  Possible values are stable, bandwidth and count.  This
                  option is only used in 802.3ad mode.

         • <b>all-members-active</b> (boolean) – since 0.106

                  If the bond should drop duplicate frames received on inactive ports, set this option to false.
                  If they should be delivered, set this option to true.  The default value is false and  is  the
                  desirable behaviour in most situations.

                  Alias: <b>all-slaves-active</b>

         • <b>arp-interval</b> (scalar)

                  Set  the  interval  value  for  how frequently ARP link monitoring should happen.  The default
                  value is 0, which disables ARP monitoring.  For the  networkd  back  end,  this  maps  to  the
                  ARPIntervalSec=  property.   If  no time suffix is specified, the value will be interpreted as
                  milliseconds.

         • <b>arp-ip-targets</b> (sequence of scalars)

                  IP addresses of other hosts on the link which should be sent ARP requests in order to validate
                  that a port is up.  This option is only used when arp-interval is set to a value other than 0.
                  At least one IP address must be  given  for  ARP  link  monitoring  to  function.   Only  IPv4
                  addresses  are  supported.   You  can  specify up to 16 IP addresses.  The default value is an
                  empty list.

         • <b>arp-validate</b> (scalar)

                  Configure how ARP replies are to be validated when using ARP link monitoring.  Possible values
                  are none, active, backup, and all.

         • <b>arp-all-targets</b> (scalar)

                  Specify whether to use any ARP IP target being up as sufficient for a port  to  be  considered
                  up;  or  if  all  the  targets  must  be  up.   This  is only used for active-backup mode when
                  arp-validate is enabled.  Possible values are any and all.

         • <b>up-delay</b> (scalar)

                  Specify the delay before enabling a link once the link is physically up.  The default value is
                  0.  This maps to the UpDelaySec= property for the networkd  renderer.   This  option  is  only
                  valid  for  the  miimon  link  monitor.   If  no  time  suffix is specified, the value will be
                  interpreted as milliseconds.

         • <b>down-delay</b> (scalar)

                  Specify the delay before disabling a link once the link has been lost.  The default  value  is
                  0.   This  maps  to the DownDelaySec= property for the networkd renderer.  This option is only
                  valid for the miimon link monitor.  If  no  time  suffix  is  specified,  the  value  will  be
                  interpreted as milliseconds.

         • <b>fail-over-mac-policy</b> (scalar)

                  Set whether to set all ports to the same MAC address when adding them to the bond, or how else
                  the system should handle MAC addresses.  The possible values are none, active and follow.

         • <b>gratuitous-arp</b> (scalar)

                  Specify  how  many  ARP  packets  to  send after failover.  Once a link is up on a new port, a
                  notification is sent and possibly repeated if this value is set to a number  greater  than  1.
                  The  default  value  is  1  and  valid  values  are  between  1  and  255.   This only affects
                  active-backup mode.

                  For historical reasons, the misspelling gratuitious-arp is also  accepted  and  has  the  same
                  function.

         • <b>packets-per-member</b> (scalar) – since 0.106

                  In  balance-rr mode, specifies the number of packets to transmit on a port before switching to
                  the next.  When this value is set to 0, ports are chosen  at  random.   Allowable  values  are
                  between 0 and 65535.  The default value is 1.  This setting is only used in balance-rr mode.

                  Alias: <b>packets-per-slave</b>

         • <b>primary-reselect-policy</b> (scalar)

                  Set  the  reselection  policy for the primary port.  On failure of the active port, the system
                  will use this policy to decide how the new active port will be chosen and how recovery will be
                  handled.  The possible values are always, better and failure.

         • <b>resend-igmp</b> (scalar)

                  In modes balance-rr, active-backup, balance-tlb and balance-alb, a failover  can  switch  IGMP
                  traffic from one port to another.

                  This  parameter  specifies  how  many  IGMP membership reports are issued on a failover event.
                  Values range from 0 to 255.  0 disables sending  membership  reports.   Otherwise,  the  first
                  membership report is sent on failover and subsequent reports are sent at 200ms intervals.

         • <b>learn-packet-interval</b> (scalar)

                  Specify  the  interval  between  sending  learning  packets  to each port.  The value range is
                  between 1 and 0x7fffffff.  The default value is 1.  This option only affects  balance-tlb  and
                  balance-alb    modes.     Using    the   networkd   renderer,   this   field   maps   to   the
                  LearnPacketIntervalSec= property.   If  no  time  suffix  is  specified,  the  value  will  be
                  interpreted as seconds.

         • <b>primary</b> (scalar)

                  Specify  a  device  to be used as a primary port, or preferred device to use as a port for the
                  bond (i.e.  the preferred device to send data through), whenever it is available.   This  only
                  affects active-backup, balance-alb and balance-tlb modes.

       (yaml-tunnels)= ## Properties for device type tunnels

       <b>Status</b>: Optional.

       <b>Purpose</b>: Use the tunnels key to create virtual tunnel interfaces.

       <b>Structure</b>:  The  key  consists  of  a  mapping  of  tunnel  interface  names.   Each  tunnel requires the
       identification of the tunnel mode (see the section mode below for the  list  of  supported  modes).   The
       general configuration structure for Tunnels is shown below.

              network:
                tunnels:
                  tunnel0:
                    mode: SCALAR
                    ...

       When  applied,  a  virtual interface called tunnel0 will be created in the system.  Its operation mode is
       defined by the property mode.

       Tunnels allow traffic to pass as if it was between systems on the same local  network,  although  systems
       may be far from each other but reachable via the Internet.  They may be used to support IPv6 traffic on a
       network  where  the ISP does not provide the service, or to extend and "connect" separate local networks.
       See Tunneling_protocol for more general information about tunnels.

       The specific settings for tunnels are defined below.

       • <b>mode</b> (scalar)

                Defines the tunnel mode.  Valid options are sit, gre, ip6gre, ipip, ipip6,  ip6ip6,  vti,  vti6,
                wireguard, vxlan, gretap and ip6gretap modes.  In addition, the NetworkManager back end supports
                isatap tunnels.

       • <b>local</b> (scalar)

                Defines  the  address of the local endpoint of the tunnel.  (For VXLAN) This should match one of
                the parent's IP addresses or make use of the networkd special values.

       • <b>remote</b> (scalar)

                Defines the address of the remote endpoint of the tunnel  or  multicast  group  IP  address  for
                VXLAN.

       • <b>ttl</b> (scalar) – since 0.103

                Defines the Time To Live (TTL) of the tunnel.  Takes a number in the range 1..255.

       • <b>key</b> (scalar or mapping)

                Define  keys to use for the tunnel.  The key can be a number or a dotted quad (an IPv4 address).
                For wireguard it can be a base64-encoded private key or (as of networkd v242+) an absolute  path
                to  a  file,  containing  the  private  key  (since 0.100).  It is used for identification of IP
                transforms.  This is only required for vti and vti6 when using the networkd back end.

                This field may be used as a scalar (meaning that a single key is specified and to  be  used  for
                input,   output   and   private   key),   or  as  a  mapping,  where  you  can  further  specify
                input/output/private.

         • <b>input</b> (scalar)

                  The input key for the tunnel

         • <b>output</b> (scalar)

                  The output key for the tunnel

         • <b>private</b> (scalar) – since 0.100

                  A base64-encoded private key required for WireGuard tunnels.  When the  systemd-networkd  back
                  end (v242+) is used, this can also be an absolute path to a file containing the private key.

         • <b>private-key-flags</b> (sequence of scalars) – since 0.107

                  Private  key  flags  used  by NetworkManager.  Possible values are: agent-owned, not-saved and
                  not-required.

                  agent-owned: a user-session secret agent is responsible for providing and storing this secret.

                  not-saved: this secret should not be saved but should be requested from the user each time  it
                  is required.

                  not-required: this flag hints that the secret is not required and should not be requested from
                  the user.

           Example:

                  network:

   <b>Properties</b> <b>for</b> <b>device</b> <b>type</b> virtual-ethernets
       <b>Status</b>: Optional.

       <b>Purpose</b>: Use the virtual-ethernets key to create virtual Ethernet interfaces.

       <b>Structure</b>: The key consists of a mapping of veth interface names.  Each veth requires a peer.   In  order
       to have a fully working veth pair, both devices must be defined, i.e., only setting the peer key with the
       peer  name is not enough, the peer interface must also be defined and set the first one as its peer.  The
       general configuration structure for virtual Ethernet is shown below.

              network:
                virtual-ethernets:
                  veth0:
                    peer: veth1
                  veth1:
                    peer: veth0

       When applied, two virtual interfaces called veth0 and veth1 will be created in the system.

       Virtual Ethernet devices act as tunnels forwarding traffic from one interface to the other.  They can  be
       used  to connect two separate virtual networks such as network namespaces and bridges.  It's not possible
       to move virtual-ethernets to different namespaces through Netplan at the present moment.

       The specific settings for virtual-ethernets are defined below.

       • <b>peer</b> (scalar)

                Defines the virtual-ethernet peer.  The peer interface must also be a virtual-ethernet device.

       Below is a complete example that uses a pair of virtual Ethernet devices to create  a  link  between  two
       bridges:

              network:
                version: 2
                renderer: networkd
                virtual-ethernets:
                  veth0-peer1:
                    peer: veth0-peer2
                  veth0-peer2:
                    peer: veth0-peer1

                bridges:
                  br0:
                    interfaces:
                      - veth0-peer1
                  br1:
                    interfaces:
                      - veth0-peer2

   <b>Properties</b> <b>for</b> <b>device</b> <b>type</b> vlans
       <b>Status</b>: Optional.

       <b>Purpose</b>: Use the vlans key to create VLAN interfaces.

       <b>Structure</b>:  The key consists of a mapping of VLAN interface names.  The interface used in the link option
       (enp5s0 in the  example  below)  must  also  be  defined  in  the  Netplan  configuration.   The  general
       configuration structure for VLANs is shown below.

              network:
                vlans:
                  vlan123:
                    id: 123
                    link: enp5s0
                    dhcp4: yes

       The specific settings for VLANs are defined below.

       • <b>id</b> (scalar)

                VLAN ID, a number between 0 and 4094.

       • <b>link</b> (scalar)

                Netplan ID of the underlying device definition on which this VLAN gets created.

       Example:

              network:
                ethernets:
                  eno1: {...}
                vlans:
                  en-intra:
                    id: 1
                    link: eno1
                    dhcp4: yes
                  en-vpn:
                    id: 2
                    link: eno1
                    addresses: [...]

   <b>Properties</b> <b>for</b> <b>device</b> <b>type</b> vrfs
       <b>Status</b>: Optional.

       <b>Purpose</b>: Use the vrfs key to create Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) interfaces.

       <b>Structure</b>:  The  key consists of a mapping of VRF interface names.  The interface used in the link option
       (enp5s0 in the  example  below)  must  also  be  defined  in  the  Netplan  configuration.   The  general
       configuration structure for VRFs is shown below.

              network:
                renderer: networkd
                vrfs:
                  vrf1:

                    interfaces:
                      - enp5s0
                    routes:
                      - to: default
                        via: 10.10.10.4
                    routing-policy:
                      - from: 10.10.10.42

       • <b>table</b> (scalar) – since 0.105

                The numeric routing table identifier.  This setting is compulsory.

       • <b>interfaces</b> (sequence of scalars) – since 0.105

                All devices matching this ID list will be added to the VRF.  This may be an empty list, in which
                case the VRF will be brought online with no member interfaces.

       • <b>routes</b> (sequence of mappings) – since 0.105

                Configure static routing for the device; see the Routing section.  The table value is implicitly
                set to the VRF table.

       • <b>routing-policy</b> (sequence of mappings) – since 0.105

                Configure policy routing for the device; see the Routing section.  The table value is implicitly
                set to the VRF table.

       Example:

              network:
                vrfs:
                  vrf20:
                    table: 20

       <b>Purpose</b>:  Use  the  nm-devices  key to configure device types that are not supported by Netplan.  This is
       NetworkManager specific configuration.

       <b>Structure</b>: The key consists of a mapping of NetworkManager connections.  The nm-devices  device  type  is
       for  internal  use only and should not be used in normal configuration files.  It enables a fallback mode
       for unsupported settings, using the passthrough mapping.  The  general  configuration  structure  for  NM

   <b>Back</b> <b>end-specific</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>parameters</b>
       In  addition  to the other fields available to configure interfaces, some back ends may require to record
       some  of  their  own  parameters  in  Netplan,  especially  if  the  Netplan  definitions  are  generated
       automatically by the consumer of that back end.  Currently, this is only used with NetworkManager.

       • <b>networkmanager</b> (mapping) – since 0.99

                Keeps  the  NetworkManager-specific  configuration  parameters  used  by the daemon to recognise
                connections.

         • <b>name</b> (scalar) – since 0.99

                  Set the display name for the connection.

         • <b>uuid</b> (scalar) – since 0.99

                  Defines the UUID (unique identifier) for  this  connection,  as  generated  by  NetworkManager
                  itself.

         • <b>stable-id</b> (scalar) – since 0.99

                  Defines  the  stable ID (a different form of a connection name) used by NetworkManager in case
                  the name of the connection might otherwise change, such as when  sharing  connections  between
                  users.

         • <b>device</b> (scalar) – since 0.99

                  Defines the interface name for which this connection applies.

         • <b>passthrough</b> (mapping) – since 0.102

                  Can be used as a fallback mechanism to missing key-file settings.
