</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       dicod.conf - GNU dictionary server configuration file.

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The  file <b>/etc/dicod.conf</b> contains configuration settings and database definitions for the GNU dictionary
       server <b><a href="../man8/dicod.8.html">dicod</a></b>(8).  The server reads this file once, upon startup, and uses the settings until it  is  shut
       down  or the HUP signal is delivered, in which case previous configuration settings are discarded and the
       file is re-read.

</pre><h4><b>NOTE</b></h4><pre>
       This manpage is a short description of the <b>dicod.conf</b> configuration file.   For  a  detailed  discussion,
       including  examples  and usage recommendations, refer to the <b>GNU</b> <b>Dico</b> <b>Manual</b> available in texinfo format.
       If the <b>info</b> reader and <b>GNU</b> <b>Dico</b> documentation are properly installed on your system, the command

           <b>info</b> <b>dico</b>

       should give you access to the complete manual.

       You can also view the manual using the info mode in <b><a href="../man1/emacs.1.html">emacs</a></b>(1), or find it in various formats online at

           <b><a href="http://www.gnu.org.ua/software/dico/manual">http://www.gnu.org.ua/software/dico/manual</a></b>

       If any discrepancies occur between this manpage and the <b>GNU</b> <b>Dico</b> <b>Manual</b>, the later  shall  be  considered
       the authoritative source.

</pre><h4><b>LEXICAL</b> <b>STRUCTURE</b></h4><pre>
       There  are three classes of lexical tokens: words, quoted strings, and separators. Blanks, tabs, newlines
       and comments, collectively called <u>white</u> <u>space</u> are ignored except as they serve to separate  tokens.  Some
       white space is required to separate otherwise adjacent keywords and values.

   <b>Words</b>
       A <u>word</u> is a sequence of letters, digits, and any of the following characters: <b>_</b>, <b>-</b>, <b>.</b>, <b>/</b>, <b>@</b>, <b>*</b>, <b>:</b>, <b>[</b>, <b>]</b>.

   <b>Strings</b>
       A  <u>quoted</u>  <u>string</u>  is  any  sequence  of characters enclosed in double-quotes (<b>"</b>).  A backslash appearing
       within a quoted string introduces an <u>escape</u> <u>sequence</u>, which is replaced with a single character according
       to the following rules:

               <u>Sequence</u>  <u>Expansion</u>               <u>ASCII</u>
               <b>\\</b>        <b>\</b>                       134
               <b>\"</b>        <b>"</b>                       042
               <b>\a</b>        audible bell            007
               <b>\b</b>        backspace               010
               <b>\f</b>        form-feed               014
               <b>\n</b>        new line                012
               <b>\r</b>        charriage return        015
               <b>\t</b>        horizontal tabulation   011
               <b>\v</b>        vertical tabulation     013

       In addition, the sequence <b>\</b><u>newline</u> is removed from the string.  This allows to split  long  strings  over
       several physical lines, e.g.:

       "a long string may be\
        split over several lines"

       If  the character following a backslash is not one of those specified above, the backslash is ignored and
       a warning is issued.

       Two or more adjacent quoted strings are concatenated, which gives another way to split long strings  over
       several  lines  to  improve  readability.  The following fragment produces the same result as the example
       above:

       "a long string may be"
       " split over several lines"

       A <u>here-document</u> is a special construct that allows to  introduce  strings  of  text  containing  embedded
       newlines.

       The  <b>&lt;&lt;</b><u>word</u> construct instructs the parser to read all the following lines up to the line containing only
       <u>word</u>, with possible trailing blanks.  Any lines thus read are concatenated together into a single string.
       For example:

       &lt;&lt;EOT
       A multiline
       string
       EOT

       The body of a here-document is interpreted the same  way  as  a  double-quoted  string,  unless  <u>word</u>  is
       preceded  by  a  backslash (e.g.  <b>&lt;&lt;\EOT</b>) or enclosed in double-quotes, in which case the text is read as
       is, without interpretation of escape sequences.

       If <u>word</u> is prefixed with <b>-</b> (a dash), then all leading tab characters are stripped from  input  lines  and
       the  line  containing  <u>word</u>.   Furthermore,  <b>-</b>  is  followed by a single space, all leading whitespace is
       stripped from them.  This allows to indent here-documents in a natural fashion.  For example:

       &lt;&lt;- TEXT
           The leading whitespace will be
           ignored when reading these lines.
       TEXT

       It is important that the terminating delimiter be the only token on its line.  The only exception to this
       rule is allowed if a here-document appears as the last element of a statement.  In this case a  semicolon
       can be placed on the same line with its terminating delimiter, as in:

       help-text &lt;&lt;-EOT
           A sample help text.
       EOT;

   <b>Comments</b>
       The usual comment styles are supported:

       C style: <b>/*</b> <b>*/</b>

       C++ style: <b>//</b> to end of line

       Unix style: <b>#</b> to end of line

       <u>Pragmatic</u>  <u>comments</u> are similar to the usual single-line comments, except that they cause some changes in
       the way the configuration is parsed.  Pragmatic comments begin with a  <b>#</b>  sign  and  end  with  the  next
       physical newline character.

       <b>#include</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>FILE</u><b>&gt;</b>
       <b>#include</b> <u>FILE</u>
              Include  the  contents of the file <u>file</u>.  Both forms are equivalent.  The <u>FILE</u> must be an absolute
              file name.

       <b>#include_once</b> <b>&lt;</b><u>FILE</u><b>&gt;</b>
       <b>#include_once</b> FILE
              Same as <b>#include</b>, except that, if the <u>FILE</u> has already been included,  it  will  not  be  included
              again.

       <b>#line</b> <u>num</u>
       <b>#line</b> <u>num</u> <b>"</b><u>FILE</u><b>"</b>
              This line causes the parser to believe, for purposes of error diagnostics, that the line number of
              the next source line is given by <u>num</u> and the current input file is named by <u>FILE</u>. If the latter is
              absent, the remembered file name does not change.

       <b>#</b> <u>num</u> <b>"</b><u>FILE</u><b>"</b>
              This  is  a  special  form  of  the  <b>#line</b>  statement,  understood  for  compatibility  with the C
              preprocessor.

</pre><h4><b>STATEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       A <u>simple</u> <u>statement</u> consists of a  keyword  and  value  separated  by  any  amount  of  whitespace.   Some
       statements take more than one value.  Simple statement is terminated with a semicolon (<b>;</b>).

       The following is a simple statement:

           pidfile /var/run/direvent.pid;

       See below for a list of valid simple statements.

       A <u>value</u> can be one of the following:

       <u>number</u> A number is a sequence of decimal digits.

       <u>boolean</u>
              A  boolean  value  is one of the following: <b>yes</b>, <b>true</b>, <b>t</b> or <b>1</b>, meaning <u>true</u>, and <b>no</b>, <b>false</b>, <b>nil</b>, <b>0</b>
              meaning <u>false</u>.

       <u>word</u>

       <u>quoted</u> <u>string</u>

       <u>list</u>   A comma-separated list of values, enclosed in parentheses.

   <b>Block</b> <b>Statement</b>
       A block statement introduces a logical group of statements.  It consists of a  keyword,  followed  by  an
       optional  value,  called  a  <b>tag</b>,  and a sequence of statements enclosed in curly braces, as shown in the
       example below:

       acl global {
          allow all from 198.51.100.0/24;
          deny all;
       }
       The closing curly brace may be followed by a semicolon, although this is not required.

</pre><h4><b>SERVER</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>user</b> <u>NAME</u>
              Run with the privileges of this user.  The argument is either a user name, or UID prefixed with  a
              plus sign.

       <b>group</b> <u>LIST</u>
              If  the  <b>user</b>  statement  is  present,  <b>dicod</b> will drop all supplementary groups and switch to the
              principal group of that user.  Sometimes, however, it may be  necessary  to  retain  one  or  more
              supplementary  groups.   For example, this might be necessary to access dictionary databases.  The
              <b>group</b> statement retains the supplementary groups listed in <u>LIST</u>.   Each  group  can  be  specified
              either by its name or by its GID number, prefixed with @samp{+}, e.g.:
              user nobody;
              group (man, dict +88);
       This statement is ignored if no <b>user</b> statement is present or if <b>dicod</b> is running in inetd mode.

       <b>mode</b> <b>daemon</b>|<b>inetd</b>
              Sets server operation mode.

       <b>listen</b> <u>LIST</u>
              Specify  the IP addresses and ports to listen on in daemon mode.  By default, <b>dicod</b> will listen on
              port 2628 on all existing interfaces.

              Elements of <u>LIST</u> can have the following forms:

              <u>HOST</u><b>:</b><u>PORT</u>
                     Specifies an IP (version 4 or 6) socket to listen on.  The <u>HOST</u> part is either an  IPv4  in
                     ``dotted-quad''  notation,  or  an IPv6 address in square brackets, or a host name.  In the
                     latter case, <b>dicod</b> will listen on all IP addresses corresponding to  its  <b>A</b>  and  <b>AAAA</b>  DNS
                     records.

                     The  <u>PORT</u>  part  is  either  a  numeric  port  number  or  a symbolic service name from the
                     <b><a href="file:/etc/services">/etc/services</a></b> file.

                     Either of the two parts may be omitted.  If <b>HOST</b> is omitted, the server will listen on  all
                     interfaces.  If <b>PORT</b> is omitted, the default port 2628 will be used.

              <b>inet://</b><u>HOST</u><b>:</b><u>PORT</u>, <b>inet4://</b><u>HOST</u><b>:</b><u>PORT</u>
                     Listen  on  IPv4  socket.  <u>HOST</u> is either an IP address or a host name. In the latter case,
                     <b>dicod</b> will start listening on all IP addresses from the <b>A</b> records for this host.

                     Either <u>HOST</u> or <u>PORT</u> (but not both) can be omitted.  Missing <u>HOST</u> defaults to IPv4 addresses
                     on all available network interfaces, and missing <u>PORT</u> defaults to 2628.

              <b>inet6://</b><u>HOST</u><b>:</b><u>PORT</u>
                     Listen on IPv6 socket.  <u>HOST</u> is either an IPv6 address in square brackets, or a host  name.
                     In  the  latter  case, <b>dicod</b> will start listening on all IP addresses from the <b>AAAA</b> records
                     for this host.

                     Either <u>HOST</u> or <u>PORT</u> (but not both) can be omitted.  Missing <u>HOST</u> defaults to IPv6 addresses
                     on all available network interfaces, and missing <u>PORT</u> defaults to 2628.

              <u>FILENAME</u>, <b>unix://</b><u>FILENAME</u>
                     Specifies the name of a UNIX socket to listen on.  <u>FILENAME</u> must be an absolute  file  name
                     of the socket.

       <b>pidfile</b> <u>STRING</u>
              Store PID of the master process in this file.  Default is <b>/var/run/dicod.pid</b>.

       <b>max-children</b> <u>NUMBER</u>
              Sets maximum number of subprocesses that can run simultaneously.  This is equivalent to the number
              of clients that can simultaneously use the server.  The default is 64.

       <b>inactivity-timeout</b> <u>NUMBER</u>
              Sets  inactivity  timeout  to  the <u>NUMBER</u> of seconds.  The server disconnects automatically if the
              remote client has not sent any command within this  number  of  seconds.   Setting  timeout  to  0
              disables inactivity timeout (the default).

              This statement along with <b>max-children</b> allows you to control the server load.

       <b>shutdown-timeout</b> <u>NUMBER</u>
              When  the  master  server  is  shutting  down,  wait  this  number  of seconds for all children to
              terminate.  Default is 5 seconds.

       <b>identity-check</b> <u>BOOLEAN</u>
              Enable identification check using AUTH protocol (RFC 1413).  The received user name or UID can  be
              shown in access log using the <b>%l</b> conversion (see below).

       <b>ident-keyfile</b> <u>STRING</u>
              Use encryption keys from the named file to decrypt AUTH replies encrypted using DES.

       <b>ident-timeout</b> <u>NUMBER</u>
              Set timeout for AUTH input/output operation to NUMBER of seconds.  Default timeout is 3 seconds.

</pre><h4><b>AUTHENTICATION</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       The authentication database is defined as:

       <b>user-db</b> <u>URL</u> <b>{</b>
           # Additional configuration options.
           <b>options</b> <u>STRING</u><b>;</b>
           # Name of the password resource.
           <b>password-resource</b> <u>RESOURCE</u><b>;</b>
           # Name of the resource returning user group information.
           <b>group-resource</b> <u>RESOURCE</u><b>;</b>
       <b>}</b>

       The <u>URL</u> consists of the following parts (square brackets denoting optional ones):

       <u>TYPE</u><b>://</b>[[<u>USER</u>[:<u>PASSWORD</u>]<b>@</b>]<u>HOST</u>]<b>/</b><u>PATH</u>[<u>PARAMS</u>]

       where:

       <u>TYPE</u>   Database type.  Two types are supported: <b>text</b> and <b>ldap</b>.

       <u>USER</u>   User name, if necessary to access the database.

       <u>PASSWORD</u>
              User password, if necessary to access the database.

       <u>HOST</u>   Domain name or IP address of a machine running the database.

       <u>PATH</u>   A  path to the database.  The exact meaning of this element depends on the database protocol.  See
              the texinfo documentation.

       <u>PARAMS</u> A list of protocol-dependent parameters.  Each parameter is of  the  form  <u>KEYWORD</u><b>=</b><u>NAME</u>,  multiple
              parameters are separated with semicolons.

       The following statements can appear within the <b>user-db</b> block:

       <b>options</b> <u>STRING</u>
              Pass  additional options to the underlying mechanism.  The argument is treated as an opaque string
              and passed to the authentication <b>open</b> procedure verbatim.  Its exact meaning depends on  the  type
              of the database.

       <b>password-resource</b> <u>ARG</u>
              A database resource which returns the user's password.

       <b>group-resource</b> <u>ARG</u>
              A database resource which returns the list of groups this user is member of.

       The  exact  semantics of the <u>database</u> <u>resource</u> depends on the type of database being used.  For flat text
       databases, it means the name of a text file that contains these data, for LDAP databases, the resource is
       the filter string, etc.  Please refer to the <b>GNU</b> <b>Dico</b>  <b>Manual</b>,  subsection  <b>4.3.3</b>  <b>Authentication</b>  for  a
       detailed discussion.

</pre><h4><b>SASL</b> <b>AUTHENTICATION</b></h4><pre>
       The  SASL  authentication  is available if the server was compiled with GNU SASL.  It is configured using
       the following statement:

       <b>sasl</b> <b>{</b>
           # Disable SASL mechanisms listed in MECH.
           <b>disable-mechanism</b> <u>MECH</u><b>;</b>
           # Enable SASL mechanisms listed in MECH.
           <b>enable-mechanism</b> <u>MECH</u><b>;</b>
           # Set service name for GSSAPI and Kerberos.
           <b>service</b> <u>NAME</u><b>;</b>
           # Set realm name for GSSAPI and Kerberos.
           <b>realm</b> <u>NAME</u>;
           # Define groups for anonymous users.
           <b>anon-group</b> <u>GROUPS</u>;
       <b>}</b>

       <b>disable-mechanism</b> <u>MECH</u>
              Disable SASL mechanisms listed in <u>MECH</u>, which is a list of names.

       <b>enable-mechanism</b> <u>MECH</u>
              Enable SASL mechanisms listed in <u>MECH</u>, which is a list of names.

       <b>service</b> <u>NAME</u>
              Sets the service name for GSSAPI and Kerberos mechanisms.

       <b>realm</b> <u>NAME</u>
              Sets the realm name.

       <b>anon-group</b> <u>LIST</u>
              Declares the list of user groups considered anonymous.

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b> <b>CONTROL</b> <b>LISTS</b></h4><pre>
       Define an ACL:

       <b>acl</b> <u>NAME</u> <b>{</b>
           <u>DEFINITION</u>...
       <b>}</b>

       The parameter <u>NAME</u> assigns a unique name to that ACL.  This name will be used  by  another  configuration
       statements to refer to that ACL (see <b>SECURITY</b> <b>SETTINGS</b>, and <b>Database</b> <b>Visibility</b>).

       Each <u>DEFINITION</u> is:

       <b>allow</b>|<b>deny</b> [<b>all</b>|<b>authenticated</b>|<b>group</b> <u>GROUPLIST</u>] [<b>acl</b> <u>NAME</u>] [<b>from</b> <u>ADDRLIST</u>]

       A definition starting with <b>allow</b> allows access to the resource, and the one starting with <b>deny</b> denies it.

       The next part controls what users have access to the resource:

       <b>all</b>    All users (the default).

       <b>authenticated</b>
              Only authenticated users.

       <b>group</b> <u>GROUPLIST</u>
              Authenticated users which are members of at least one of the groups listed in <u>GROUPLIST</u>.

       The <b>acl</b> part refers to an already defined ACL.

       The  <b>from</b>  keyword declares that the client IP must be within the <u>ADDRLIST</u> in order for the definition to
       apply.  Elements of <u>ADDRLIST</u> are:

       <b>any</b>    Matches any client address.

       IP address
              Matches if the request comes from the given IP (both IPv4 and IPv6 are allowed).

       <u>ADDR</u><b>/</b><u>NETLEN</u>
              Matches if first <u>NETLEN</u> bits from the client IP address equal to <u>ADDR</u>.  The network  mask  length,
              NETLEN  must  be an integer number between 0 and 32 for IPv4, and between 0 and 128 for IPv6.  The
              address part, <u>ADDR</u>, is as described above.

       <u>ADDR</u><b>/</b><u>NETMASK</u>
              The specifier matches if the result of logical AND between  the  client  IP  address  and  <u>NETMASK</u>
              equals  to  ADDR.   The  network  mask  must  be  specified  in a IP address (either IPv4 or IPv6)
              notation.

</pre><h4><b>SECURITY</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>connection-acl</b> <u>NAME</u>
              Use ACL <u>NAME</u> to control incoming  connections.   The  ACL  itself  must  be  defined  before  this
              statement.   Using  the <b>group</b> clause in this ACL makes no sense, because the authentication itself
              is performed only after the connection have been established.

       <b>show-sys-info</b> <u>NAME</u>
              Controls whether to show system information in reply to <b>SHOW</b> <b>SERVER</b> command.  The information will
              be shown only if ACL <u>NAME</u> allows it.

       <b>visibility-acl</b> <u>NAME</u>
              Sets name of the ACL that controls visibility of all databases.

</pre><h4><b>LOGGING</b> <b>AND</b> <b>DEBUGGING</b></h4><pre>
       <b>log-tag</b> <u>STRING</u>
              Prefix syslog messages with this string.  By default, the program name is used.

       <b>log-facility</b> <u>STRING</u>
              Sets the syslog facility to use.  Allowed values are: <b>user</b>, <b>daemon</b>, <b>auth</b>,  <b>authpriv</b>,  <b>mail</b>,  <b>cron</b>,
              <b>local0</b> through <b>local7</b> (case-insensitive), or a decimal facility number.

       <b>log-print-severity</b> <u>BOOLEAN</u>
              Prefix diagnostics messages with a string identifying their severity.

       <b>transcript</b> <u>BOOLEAN</u>

</pre><h4><b>ACCESS</b> <b>LOG</b></h4><pre>
       GNU  Dico  provides  a  feature  similar  to  Apache's  <b>CustomLog</b>,  which keeps a log of <b>MATCH</b> and <b>DEFINE</b>
       requests.

       <b>access-log-file</b> <u>STRING</u>
              Sets access log file name.

       <b>access-log-format</b> <u>STRING</u>
              Defines the format string.  Its argument can contain literal characters, which are copied into the
              log file verbatim, and <u>format</u> <u>specifiers</u>, i.e. special  sequences  beginning  with  <b>%</b>,  which  are
              replaced in the log file as shown in the table below:

              <b>%%</b>     The percent sign.

              <b>%a</b>     Remote IP address.

              <b>%A</b>     Local IP address.

              <b>%B</b>     Size of response in bytes.

              <b>%b</b>     Size  of  response  in  bytes  in CLF format, i.e. a dash rather than a <b>0</b> when no bytes are
                     sent.

              <b>%C</b>     Remote client (from the <b>CLIENT</b> command).

              <b>%D</b>     The time taken to serve the request, in microseconds.

              <b>%d</b>     Request command verb in abbreviated form, suitable for use in URLs, i.e. <b>d</b> for <b>DEFINE</b>,  and
                     <b>m</b> for <b>MATCH</b>.

              <b>%h</b>     Remote host.

              <b>%H</b>     Request command verb (<b>DEFINE</b> or <b>MATCH</b>).

              <b>%l</b>     Remote   logname   (from   <b><a href="../man1/identd.1.html">identd</a></b>(1),  if  supplied).   This  will  return  a  dash  unless
                     <b>identity-check</b> statement is set to true.

              <b>%m</b>     The search strategy.

              <b>%p</b>     The canonical port of the server serving the request.

              <b>%P</b>     The PID of the child that served the request.

              <b>%q</b>     The database from the request.

              <b>%r</b>     Full request.

              <b>%{</b><u>N</u><b>}R</b>  The <u>N</u>th token from the request (<u>N</u> is 0-based).

              <b>%s</b>     Reply status.  For multiple replies, the form <b>%s</b> returns the status  of  the  first  reply,
                     while <b>%&gt;s</b> returns that of the last reply.

              <b>%t</b>     Time the request was received in the standard Apache format, e.g.:
                       [04/Jun/2008:11:05:22 +0300]

              <b>%{</b><u>FORMAT</u><b>}t</b>
                     The  time,  in the form given by <u>FORMAT</u>, which should be a valid <b><a href="../man3/strftime.3.html">strftime</a></b>(3) format string.
                     The standard <b>%t</b> format is equivalent to
                       [%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z]

              <b>%T</b>     The time taken to serve the request, in seconds.

              <b>%V</b>     Actual host name of the server (in case it was overridden in configuration).

              <b>%W</b>     The word from the request.

       The absence of <b>access-log-format</b> statement is equivalent to the following:

         access-log-format "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %&gt;s %b";

</pre><h4><b>GENERAL</b> <b>SETTINGS</b></h4><pre>
       <b>initial-banner-text</b> <u>TEXT</u>
              Display <u>TEXT</u> in the textual part of the initial server reply.

       <b>hostname</b> <u>STRING</u>
              Sets the hostname.  By default it is determined automatically.

              The server hostname is used, among others, in the initial reply after the  <b>220</b>  and  may  also  be
              displayed in the access log file using the <b>%v</b> escape (see <b>ACCESS</b> <b>LOG</b>).

       <b>server-info</b> <u>TEXT</u>
              Sets the server description to be shown in reply to the <b>SHOW</b> <b>SERVER</b> command.

              It is common for <u>TEXT</u> to use the <u>here-document</u> syntax, e.g.:
                server-info &lt;&lt;EOT
                  Welcome to the FOO dictionary service.

                  Contact &lt;<a href="mailto:dict@foo.example.org">dict@foo.example.org</a>&gt; if you have questions or
                  suggestions.
                EOT;

       <b>help-text</b> <u>TEXT</u>
              Sets the text to be displayed in reply to the <b>HELP</b> command.

              The default reply displays a list of commands understood by the server with a short description of
              each.

              If <u>TEXT</u> begins with a plus sign, it will be appended to the default reply.

       <b>default-strategy</b>  <b>NAME</b>
              Sets  the name of the default matching strategy (*note MATCH::).  By default, Levenshtein matching
              is used, which is equivalent to <b>default-strategy</b> <b>lev;</b>

</pre><h4><b>CAPABILITIES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>capability</b> <u>LIST</u>
              Requests additional capabilities from the <u>LIST</u>.

       Capabilities are certain server features that can be enabled or disabled at  the  system  administrator's
       will.  The following capabilities are defined:

       <b>auth</b>   The <b>AUTH</b> command is supported.  See the section <b>AUTHENTICATION</b>, for its configuration.

       <b>mime</b>   The  <b>OPTION</b>  <b>MIME</b> command is supported.  Notice that <b>RFC</b> <b>2229</b> requires all servers to support that
              command, so you should always specify this capability.

       <b>xversion</b>
              The <b>XVERSION</b> command is supported.  It is a GNU extension that displays the  <b>dicod</b>  implementation
              and version number.

       <b>xlev</b>   The  <b>XLEV</b>  command  is  supported.   This command allows the remote party to set and query maximal
              Levenshtein distance for the <b>lev</b> matching strategy.

       The capabilities set using  this  directive  are  displayed  in  the  initial  server  reply,  and  their
       descriptions  are  added  to  the  <b>HELP</b>  command  output  (unless  specified  otherwise  by the <b>help-text</b>
       statement).

</pre><h4><b>DATABASE</b> <b>MODULES</b></h4><pre>
       A <u>database</u> <u>module</u> is an external piece of software designed to handle a particular format  of  dictionary
       databases.  This piece of software is built as a shared library that `dicod' loads at run time.

       A <b>handler</b> is an instance of the database module loaded by <b>dicod</b> and configured for a specific database or
       a set of databases.

       Database handlers are defined using the following block statement:

       <b>load-module</b> <u>NAME</u> <b>{</b>
           <b>command</b> <u>CMD</u><b>;</b>
       <b>}</b>

       The <b>load-module</b> statement creates an instance of a database module.  The <u>NAME</u> argument specifies a unique
       name  which  will be used by subsequent parts of the configuration to refer to this handler.  The command
       line for this handler is supplied with the <b>command</b> statement.  It must begin with the name of the  module
       (without  the  library  suffix)  and  can contain any additional arguments.  If the module name is not an
       absolute file name, the module will be searched in the module load path.

       For example:

       load-module dict {
          command "dictorg dbdir=/var/dicodb";
       }

       A simplified form of this statement:

           load-module <u>NAME</u>;

       is equivalent to:

           load-module <u>NAME</u> {
               command <u>NAME</u>;
           }

       A <u>module</u> <u>load</u> <u>path</u> is an internal list of directories which <b>dicod</b> scans in order to find a loadable  file
       name specified in the <b>command</b> statement.  By default the search order is as follows:

       1.     Optional <u>prefix</u> search directories specified in the <b>prepend-load-path</b> statement (see below);

       2.     <b>GNU</b> <b>Dico</b> module directory <b>/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dico</b>;

       3.     Additional search directories specified in the <b>module-load-path</b> statement (see below);

       4.     The value of the environment variable <b>LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH</b>;

       5.     The  system  dependent  library  search  path  (e.g.  on  GNU/Linux  it  is  defined  by  the file
              <b><a href="file:/etc/ld.so.conf">/etc/ld.so.conf</a></b> and the environment variable <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>).

       The value of <b>LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH</b> and <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b> must be a colon-separated list of  absolute  directory
       names.

       In  each  of these directories, <b>dicod</b> first attempts to find and load the given filename.  If this fails,
       it tries to append the following suffixes to it:

       1.     the libtool archive suffix <b>.la</b>;

       2.     the suffix used for native dynamic libraries on the host platform, e.g., <b>.so</b>, <b>.sl</b>, etc.

       <b>module-load-path</b> <u>LIST</u>
              Add directories from <u>LIST</u> to the end of the module load path.

       <b>prepend-load-path</b> <u>LIST</u>
              Add directories from <u>LIST</u> to the beginning of the module load path.

</pre><h4><b>DATABASES</b></h4><pre>
       <b>database</b> <b>{</b>
           <b>name</b> <u>WORD</u><b>;</b>
           <b>description</b> <u>STRING</u><b>;</b>
           <b>info</b> <u>TEXT</u><b>;</b>
           <b>languages-from</b> <u>LANGLIST</u><b>;</b>
           <b>languages-to</b> <u>LANGLIST</u><b>;</b>
           <b>handler</b> <u>NAME</u><b>;</b>
           <b>visibility-acl</b> <u>NAME</u><b>;</b>
           <b>mime-headers</b> <u>TEXT</u><b>;</b>
       <b>}</b>

       <b>name</b> <u>STRING</u>
              Sets the name of this database (a single word).  This name will be used to identify this  database
              in <b>DICT</b> commands.

       <b>handler</b> <u>STRING</u>
              Specifies  the handler name for this database and optional arguments for it.  This handler must be
              previously defined using the <b>load-module</b> statement (see above).

       <b>description</b> <u>STRING</u>
              Supplies a short description, to be shown in reply to the <b>SHOW</b> <b>DB</b> command.   The  <u>STRING</u>  may  not
              contain newlines.

       <b>info</b> <u>STRING</u>
              Defines  a  full description of the database.  This description is shown in reply to the <b>SHOW</b> <b>INFO</b>
              command.  It is usually a multi-line text, so it is common to use here-document syntax.

       <b>content-type</b> <u>STRING</u>
              Sets the content type of the reply (for use in MIME headers).

       <b>content-transfer-encoding</b> <u>VALUE</u>
              Sets transfer encoding to use when sending MIME replies for  this  database.   <u>VALUE</u>  is  one  of:
              <b>base64</b>, <b>quoted-printable</b>.

       <b>visibility-acl</b> <u>NAME</u>
              Sets name of the ACL that controls that database visibility.

</pre><h4><b>STRATEGIES</b> <b>AND</b> <b>SEARCHES</b></h4><pre>
       A <u>default</u> <u>search</u> is a <b>MATCH</b> request with <b>*</b> or <b>!</b> as the database argument.  The former means search in all
       available databases, and the latter means search in all databases until a match is found.

       Default  searches  cabd be quite expensive and can cause considerable strain on the server.  For example,
       the command <b>MATCH</b> <b>*</b> <b>priefix</b> <b>""</b> returns all entries from all available databases, which  would  consume  a
       lot of resources both on the server and on the client side.

       To  minimize  harmful  effects from such potentially dangerous requests, the following statement makes it
       possible to limit the use of certain strategies in default searches:

       <b>strategy</b> <u>NAME</u> <b>{</b>
           <b>deny-all</b> <u>BOOL</u><b>;</b>
           <b>deny-word</b> <u>CONDLIST</u><b>;</b>
           <b>deny-length-lt</b> <u>NUMBER</u><b>;</b>
           <b>deny-length-le</b> <u>NUMBER</u><b>;</b>
           <b>deny-length-gt</b> <u>NUMBER</u><b>;</b>
           <b>deny-length-ge</b> <u>NUMBER</u><b>;</b>
           <b>deny-length-eq</b> <u>NUMBER</u><b>;</b>
           <b>deny-length-ne</b> <u>NUMBER</u><b>;</b>
       <b>}</b>

       <b>deny-all</b> <u>BOOL</u>
              Unconditionally deny the use of this strategy in default searches.

       <b>deny-word</b> <u>LIST</u>
              Deny this strategy if the search word matches one of the words from <u>LIST</u>.

       <b>deny-length-lt</b> <u>NUMBER</u>
              Deny if length of the search word is less than <u>NUMBER</u>.

       <b>deny-length-le</b> <u>NUMBER</u>
              Deny if length of the search word is less than or equal to <u>NUMBER</u>.

       <b>deny-length-gt</b> <u>NUMBER</u>
              Deny if length of the search word is greater than <u>NUMBER</u>.

       <b>deny-length-ge</b> <u>NUMBER</u>
              Deny if length of the search word is greater than or equal to <u>NUMBER</u>.

       <b>deny-length-eq</b> <u>NUMBER</u>
              Deny if length of the search word is equal to <u>NUMBER</u>.

       <b>deny-length-ne</b> <u>NUMBER</u>
              Deny if length of the search word is not equal to <u>NUMBER</u>.

       For example, the following statement denies the use  of  <b>prefix</b>  strategy  in  default  searches  if  its
       argument is an empty string:

       strategy prefix {
           deny-length-eq 0;
       }

</pre><h4><b>TUNING</b></h4><pre>
       While  tuning  your  server, it is often necessary to get timing information which shows how much time is
       spent serving certain requests.  This can be achieved using the following configuration directive:

       <b>timing</b> <u>BOOLEAN</u>
              Provide timing information after successful completion of an operation.

       This information is displayed after replies to the following requests:  <b>MATCH</b>,  <b>DEFINE</b>,  and  <b>QUIT</b>.   The
       format is:

       <b>[d/m/c</b> <b>=</b> <u>ND</u><b>/</b><u>NM</u><b>/</b><u>NC</u> <u>RT</u><b>r</b> <u>UT</u><b>u</b> <u>ST</u><b>s]</b>

       where:

       <u>ND</u>     Number of processed define requests.

       <u>NM</u>     Number of processed match requests.

       <u>NC</u>     Number  of  comparisons made.  This value may be inaccurate if the underlying database module does
              not provide such information.

       <u>RT</u>     Real time spent serving the request.

       <u>UT</u>     Time in user space spent serving the request.

       <u>ST</u>     Time in kernel space spent serving the request.

       You can also add timing information to your access log files.  See the <b>%T</b> conversuion in  section  <b>ACCESS</b>
       <b>LOG</b>.

</pre><h4><b>COMMAND</b> <b>ALIASES</b></h4><pre>
       Aliases  allow a string to be substituted for a word when it is used as the first word of a command.  The
       daemon maintains a list of aliases that are created using the <b>alias</b> configuration file statement:

       <b>alias</b> <u>WORD</u> <u>COMMAND</u>
              Creates a new alias.

       Aliases may be recursive, i.e. the first word of <u>COMMAND</u> may refer to another alias.  To prevent  endless
       loops,  recursive expansion is stopped if the first word of the replacement text is identical to an alias
       expanded earlier.

       Aliases are useful to facilitate manual interaction with the server, as they allow the  administrator  to
       create  abbreviations  for  some frequently typed commands.  For example, the following alias creates new
       command <b>d</b> which is equivalent to <b>DEFINE</b> <b>*</b>:

       alias d DEFINE "*";
