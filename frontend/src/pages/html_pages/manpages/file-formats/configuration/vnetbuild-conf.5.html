</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       There  is  no  default  configuration  file for <a href="../man1/vnetbuild.1.html">vnetbuild</a>(1); one must always be specified on the command
       line.

       The configuration file defines a set of namespaces that will be operated on.

       VNetBuild defines two types of namespace, a host and a switch.  Any number of each may be specified, with
       any number of configuration statements in each.

       Note   The Linux kernel does not see any difference between a host and  a  switch  namespace.   VNetBuild
              provides the distinction to make it easy build full virtual networks.

</pre><h4><b>NAMESPACE</b> <b>DEFINITIONS</b></h4><pre>
       Namespace  definitions  come  in two types, host and switch.  Simply provide a simple unique alphanumeric
       <u>ID</u>.  Any subsequent statements apply to this namespace until the next host or switch statement.

       A host definition is designed to work like a physical machine.  It allows you to specify  any  number  of
       dev  entries  for  network  interfaces, with their IP addresses.  You can also define any number of Linux
       bridges with bridgedev to add your defined interfaces to.

       A host also allows any number of custom exec commands for extensibility and provides a route statement to
       deal with the common case of wanting to add network routes to the host.

       A switch definition is designed to work like a physical network switch.  It allows you to add any  number
       of dev entries (and also custom exec commands for extensibility) but nothing else.

       In  addition,  dev  entries  in  a  switch  may only specify device names, they cannot have an IP address
       associated.  A switch has a bridge automatically created in it and  all  dev  entries  are  automatically
       added to it.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b> <b>STATEMENTS</b></h4><pre>
       dev <u>DEVICE</u> ...
              Define a virtual ethernet device, <u>DEVICE</u> in a host or switch.

              Devices  must  exist  in  pairs.   A  dev must first be defined unpaired in a namespace, then some
              subsequent dev must define the pair:

                     host a
                       dev veth0
                     host b
                       dev vppp0 a/veth0

              Any <u>DEVICE</u> name which is acceptable to the Linux kernel may be used.   We  recommend  sticking  to
              e.g. veth0,  vppp0  etc.   to make it clear that they are virtual and also how you are thinking of
              the device in terms of your setup.  Devices will be created as type veth, irrespective of what you
              call them.

              Hosts may optionally specify one or more <u>IP</u>/<u>MASK</u> values which will  be  applied  (along  with  the
              calculated broadcast address) automatically, e.g.:

                     host a
                       dev veth0 10.0.0.1/8 192.168.1.2/24
                     host b
                       dev vppp0 a/veth0 10.0.0.2/8 192.168.1.3/24

              A  dev  may  not  specify an IP address if it is in a switch.  Switches exist just to tie together
              multiple devices in hosts, just like a physical network switch.

       bridgedev <u>BRIDGE</u> ...
              Define an ethernet bridge, <u>BRIDGE</u> in a host.  These are setup automatically using <a href="../man8/ip.8.html">ip</a>(8) and  shown
              with <a href="../man8/bridge.8.html">bridge</a>(8).

              A  bridge can specify network devices from its own namespace to be automatically added, as well as
              its own IP address(es).

                     host a
                       dev veth0
                       dev veth1 otherns/vdev0
                       bridgedev vbr0 veth0 veth1 10.0.0.3/8

              Devices included in a bridge generally do  not  need  their  own  IP  address  (although  that  is
              permitted).

              Bridges cannot have a pair themselves, but any devices added to a bridge need a pair as usual.

       route <u>ROUTECMD</u>
              Specify an additional network route for a host.

              Most  commonly to add a default route from hosts on a “LAN” to the machine that acts as a gateway,
              e.g.:

                     route default via 10.0.0.254

              The syntax of <u>ROUTECMD</u> is anything that can fit this pattern:

                     ip route add ROUTECMD

              See <a href="../man8/ip.8.html">ip</a>(8) and <a href="../man8/ip-route.8.html">ip-route</a>(8) for help adding routes.  If you want to do anything  more  complex  than
              simply adding routes, use the exec configuration statement.

       pre_up <u>DEVICE</u> <u>CUSTOMCMD</u>
              Execute  custom commands in a host or switch just before bringing up the specified device.  All of
              the pre_up statements for a device are combined and executed in the namespace.

              In addition to any explicitly defined interfaces, switches have an implicit bridge  device  called
              switch which can also be used in pre_up commands.

              Bridges  always  start  after  other  devices,  so  to run a command after all everything has been
              created but before any interfaces are up, you can make use of pre_up on the first defined dev.

              See below for some common uses for custom pre_up and exec commands.

       exec <u>CUSTOMCMD</u>
              Execute a custom command in a host or switch once the rest of the namespace setup is complete.

              Once all the namespaces are created, the final step in setting each one up is  to  have  its  exec
              statements combined and executed.

              It is roughly the equivalent to writing your own script and executing it after vnetbuild start has
              finished:

                     sudo ip netns exec myns ./myscript.sh

              See below for some common uses for custom pre_up and exec commands.

</pre><h4><b>COMMON</b> <b>CUSTOM</b> <b>COMMANDS</b></h4><pre>
       For  the  most  part it doesn’t matter whether these commands are used in pre_up or exec operations - the
       only difference is when they will execute, so e.g. if you want a firewall in place before any  interfaces
       come  up  then  start  it  from  the pre_up of the first device.  If you only want the firewall after all
       devices are up, put it in exec, e.g.:

              host myfirewall
                  ...
                  exec firehol myfirewall.conf start

       Forwarding is not enabled by the Linux kernel when a namespace is first created.  This can be easily done
       for any hosts that need to forward traffic:

              host mygateway
                  ...
                  exec echo 1 &gt; <a href="file:/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward">/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</a>

       The exec operates in the mygateway namespace so your host is not affected.

       Bridges are created without STP being enabled.  To enable STP  to  ensure  loops  are  not  created,  the
       following can be done:

              host myhost
                  bridgedev vbr0 ...
                  ...
                  pre_up vbr0 echo 2 &gt; /sys/class/net/vbr0/bridge/stp_state

              switch myswitch
                  ...
                  pre_up switch echo 2 &gt; /sys/class/net/vbr0/bridge/stp_state

       You  could also use brctl stp vbr0 on and brctl stp switch on instead of setting the values directly.  To
       disable multicast snooping you can use exactly the same method e.g.:

              switch myswitch
                  ...
                  pre_up switch echo 0 &gt; /sys/class/net/switch/bridge/multicast_snooping

       It is possible to run firehol within a namespace to set up custom

       Logs from network namespaces are not included in the normal system logs.  To enable iptables logging  you
       must  start  an  instance  of <a href="../man8/ulogd.8.html">ulogd</a>(8) in the namespace and use <u>ULOG</u> or <u>NFLOG</u> logging.  For FireHOL, that
       means set FIREHOL_LOG_MODE=ULOG or FIREHOL_LOG_MODE=NFLOG.  Note that <u>NFLOG</u> only works with ulogd version
       2.

       The default configuration for <a href="../man8/ulogd.8.html">ulogd</a>(8) is /etc/ulogd.conf.  Assuming the  default  place  it  will  write
       iptables  logs  to  is  /var/log/ulog/syslogemu.log (otherwise change the sed command as required), it is
       simple to set up per-namespace logging:

              host mygateway
                ...
                exec sed 's:/var/log/ulog/syslogemu.log:/var/log/ulog/mygateway.log:' /etc/ulogd.conf &gt; $NSTMP/ulogd.conf
                exec /usr/sbin/ulogd -d -c $NSTMP/ulogd.conf

       The -d flag to <a href="../man8/ulogd.8.html">ulogd</a>(8) makes it become a daemon; when vnetbuild stop executes it will automatically kill
       any programs running in the namespaces is is stopping, which includes the logging daemon.

       The configuration file will get cleaned as soon as vnetbuild start is finished.  To  be  able  to  access
       such  files  you  need  to write them to a location not under $NSTMP or create them outside the vnetbuild
       configuration altogether.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLE</b></h4><pre>
       A simple LAN arrangement with two hosts, one of which is a gateway to third host:

              host host01
                dev veth0 10.0.0.1/8
                dev vppp0 192.168.0.1/24
                exec echo 1 &gt; <a href="file:/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward">/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</a>
                route default via 192.168.0.1

              host host02
                dev veth0 10.0.0.2/8
                route default via 10.0.0.1

              switch lan
                dev d01 host01/veth0
                dev d02 host02/veth0

              host extern01
                dev veth0 host01/vppp0 192.168.0.254/24
                route default via 192.168.0.1
                exec echo 1 &gt; <a href="file:/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward">/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward</a>

</pre><h4><b>LIMITATIONS</b></h4><pre>
       When created, the namespaces setup by vnetbuild are completely disconnected from any real network.  There
       is no way of defining such a connection in the vnetbuild configuration  as  allowing  it  would  lead  to
       conflicts with the normal network setup tools and configuration files in most distributions.

       It  is  possible  to  arrange  your  network  so  you  can  connect real devices into one or more network
       namespaces.    For   the   general   approach   see   this    <a href="http://lists.firehol.org/pipermail/firehol">http://lists.firehol.org/pipermail/firehol</a>-
