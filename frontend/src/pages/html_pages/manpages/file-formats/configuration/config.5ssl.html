</pre><h4><b>NAME</b></h4><pre>
       config - OpenSSL CONF library configuration files

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       This page documents the syntax of OpenSSL configuration files, as parsed by <b><a href="../man3/NCONF_load.3.html">NCONF_load</a></b>(3) and related
       functions.  This format is used by many of the OpenSSL commands, and to initialize the libraries when
       used by any application.

       The first part describes the general syntax of the configuration files, and subsequent sections describe
       the semantics of individual modules. Other modules are described in <b><a href="../man5/fips_config.5.html">fips_config</a></b>(5) and <b><a href="../man5/x509v3_config.5.html">x509v3_config</a></b>(5).
       The syntax for defining ASN.1 values is described in <b><a href="../man3/ASN1_generate_nconf.3.html">ASN1_generate_nconf</a></b>(3).

</pre><h4><b>SYNTAX</b></h4><pre>
       A configuration file is a series of lines.  Blank lines, and whitespace between the elements of a line,
       have no significance. A comment starts with a <b>#</b> character; the rest of the line is ignored. If the <b>#</b> is
       the first non-space character in a line, the entire line is ignored.

   <b>Directives</b>
       Two directives can be used to control the parsing of configuration files: <b>.include</b> and <b>.pragma</b>.

       For compatibility with older versions of OpenSSL, an equal sign after the directive will be ignored.
       Older versions will treat it as an assignment, so care should be taken if the difference in semantics is
       important.

       A file can include other files using the include syntax:

         .include [=] pathname

       If <b>pathname</b> is a simple filename, that file is included directly at that point.  Included files can have
       <b>.include</b> statements that specify other files.  If <b>pathname</b> is a directory, all files within that
       directory that have a ".cnf" or ".conf" extension will be included.  (This is only available on systems
       with POSIX IO support.)  Any sub-directories found inside the <b>pathname</b> are <b>ignored</b>.  Similarly, if a file
       is opened while scanning a directory, and that file has an <b>.include</b> directive that specifies a directory,
       that is also ignored.

       As a general rule, the <b>pathname</b> should be an absolute path; this can be enforced with the <b>abspath</b> and
       <b>includedir</b> pragmas, described below.  The environment variable <b>OPENSSL_CONF_INCLUDE</b>, if it exists, is
       prepended to all relative pathnames.  If the pathname is still relative, it is interpreted based on the
       current working directory.

       To require all file inclusions to name absolute paths, use the following directive:

        .pragma [=] abspath:value

       The default behavior, where the <b>value</b> is <b>false</b> or <b>off</b>, is to allow relative paths. To require all
       <b>.include</b> pathnames to be absolute paths, use a <b>value</b> of <b>true</b> or <b>on</b>.

       In these files, the dollar sign, <b>$</b>, is used to reference a variable, as described below.  On some
       platforms, however, it is common to treat <b>$</b> as a regular character in symbol names.  Supporting this
       behavior can be done with the following directive:

        .pragma [=] dollarid:value

       The default behavior, where the <b>value</b> is <b>false</b> or <b>off</b>, is to treat the dollarsign as indicating a
       variable name; "foo$bar" is interpreted as "foo" followed by the expansion of the variable "bar". If
       <b>value</b> is <b>true</b> or <b>on</b>, then "foo$bar" is a single seven-character name and variable expansions must be
       specified using braces or parentheses.

        .pragma [=] includedir:value

       If a relative pathname is specified in the <b>.include</b> directive, and the <b>OPENSSL_CONF_INCLUDE</b> environment
       variable doesn't exist, then the value of the <b>includedir</b> pragma, if it exists, is prepended to the
       pathname.

   <b>Settings</b>
       A configuration file is divided into a number of <u>sections</u>.  A section begins with the section name in
       square brackets, and ends when a new section starts, or at the end of the file.  The section name can
       consist of alphanumeric characters and underscores.  Whitespace between the name and the brackets is
       removed.

       The first section of a configuration file is special and is referred to as the <b>default</b> section. This
       section is usually unnamed and spans from the start of file until the first named section. When a name is
       being looked up, it is first looked up in the current or named section, and then the default section if
       necessary.

       The environment is mapped onto a section called <b>ENV</b>.

       Within a section are a series of name/value assignments, described in more detail below.  As a reminder,
       the square brackets shown in this example are required, not optional:

        [ section ]
        name1 = This is value1
        name2 = Another value
        ...
        [ newsection ]
        name1 = New value1
        name3 = Value 3

       The <b>name</b> can contain any alphanumeric characters as well as a few punctuation symbols such as <b>.</b> <b>,</b> <b>;</b> and
       <b>_</b>.  Whitespace after the name and before the equal sign is ignored.

       If a name is repeated in the same section, then all but the last value are ignored. In certain
       circumstances, such as with Certificate DNs, the same field may occur multiple times.  In order to
       support this, commands like <b><a href="../man1/openssl-req.1.html">openssl-req</a></b>(1) ignore any leading text that is preceded with a period. For
       example:

        1.OU = First OU
        2.OU = Second OU

       The <b>value</b> consists of the string following the <b>=</b> character until end of line with any leading and
       trailing whitespace removed.

       The value string undergoes variable expansion. The text $var or "${var}" inserts the value of the named
       variable from the current section.  To use a value from another section use $section::name or
       "${section::name}".  By using $ENV::name, the value of the specified environment variable will be
       substituted.

       Variables must be defined before their value is referenced, otherwise an error is flagged and the file
       will not load.  This can be worked around by specifying a default value in the <b>default</b> section before the
       variable is used.

       Any name/value settings in an <b>ENV</b> section are available to the configuration file, but are not propagated
       to the environment.

       It is an error if the value ends up longer than 64k.

       It is possible to escape certain characters by using a single <b>'</b> or double <b>"</b> quote around the value, or
       using a backslash <b>\</b> before the character, By making the last character of a line a <b>\</b> a <b>value</b> string can
       be spread across multiple lines. In addition the sequences <b>\n</b>, <b>\r</b>, <b>\b</b> and <b>\t</b> are recognized.

       The expansion and escape rules as described above that apply to <b>value</b> also apply to the pathname of the
       <b>.include</b> directive.

</pre><h4><b>OPENSSL</b> <b>LIBRARY</b> <b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The sections below use the informal term <u>module</u> to refer to a part of the OpenSSL functionality. This is
       not the same as the formal term <u>FIPS</u> <u>module</u>, for example.

       The OpenSSL configuration looks up the value of <b>openssl_conf</b> in the default section and takes that as the
       name of a section that specifies how to configure any modules in the library. It is not an error to leave
       any module in its default configuration. An application can specify a different name by calling
       <b>CONF_modules_load_file()</b>, for example, directly.

       OpenSSL also looks up the value of <b>config_diagnostics</b>.  If this exists and has a nonzero numeric value,
       any error suppressing flags passed to <b>CONF_modules_load()</b> will be ignored.  This is useful for diagnosing
       misconfigurations but its use in production requires additional consideration.  With this option enabled,
       a configuration error will completely prevent access to a service.  Without this option and in the
       presence of a configuration error, access will be allowed but the desired configuration will <b>not</b> be used.

        # These must be in the default section
        config_diagnostics = 1
        openssl_conf = openssl_init

        [openssl_init]
        oid_section = oids
        providers = providers
        alg_section = evp_properties
        ssl_conf = ssl_configuration
        engines = engines
        random = random

        [oids]
        ... new oids here ...

        [providers]
        ... provider stuff here ...

        [evp_properties]
        ... EVP properties here ...

        [ssl_configuration]
        ... SSL/TLS configuration properties here ...

        [engines]
        ... engine properties here ...

        [random]
        ... random properties here ...

       The semantics of each module are described below. The phrase "in the initialization section" refers to
       the section identified by the <b>openssl_conf</b> or other name (given as <b>openssl_init</b> in the example above).
       The examples below assume the configuration above is used to specify the individual sections.

   <b>ASN.1</b> <b>Object</b> <b>Identifier</b> <b>Configuration</b>
       The name <b>oid_section</b> in the initialization section names the section containing name/value pairs of
       OID's.  The name is the short name; the value is an optional long name followed by a comma, and the
       numeric value.  While some OpenSSL commands have their own section for specifying OID's, this section
       makes them available to all commands and applications.

        [oids]
        shortName = a very long OID name, 1.2.3.4
        newoid1 = 1.2.3.4.1
        some_other_oid = 1.2.3.5

       If a full configuration with the above fragment is in the file <u>example.cnf</u>, then the following command
       line:

        OPENSSL_CONF=example.cnf openssl asn1parse -genstr OID:1.2.3.4.1

       will output:

        0:d=0  hl=2 l=   4 prim: OBJECT            :newoid1

       showing that the OID "newoid1" has been added as "1.2.3.4.1".

   <b>Provider</b> <b>Configuration</b>
       The name <b>providers</b> in the initialization section names the section containing cryptographic provider
       configuration. The name/value assignments in this section each name a provider, and point to the
       configuration section for that provider. The provider-specific section is used to specify how to load the
       module, activate it, and set other parameters.

       Within a provider section, the following names have meaning:

       <b>identity</b>
           This  is  used  to  specify  an  alternate name, overriding the default name specified in the list of
           providers.  For example:

            [providers]
            foo = foo_provider

            [foo_provider]
            identity = my_fips_module

       <b>module</b>
           Specifies the pathname of the module (typically a shared library) to load.

       <b>activate</b>
           If present and set to one of the values yes, on, true or 1, then  the  associated  provider  will  be
           activated.  Conversely,  setting  this  value  to no, off, false, or 0 will prevent the provider from
           being activated. Settings can be given in lower or uppercase. Setting activate to any other  setting,
           or omitting a setting value will result in an error.

           = item <b>soft_load</b>

           If  enabled,  informs the library to clear the error stack on failure to activate requested provider.
           A value of 1, yes, true or on (in lower or uppercase) will activate this setting, while a value of 0,
           no, false, or off (again in lower or uppercase) will disable this  setting.   Any  other  value  will
           produce an error.  Note this setting defaults to off if not provided

       All parameters in the section as well as sub-sections are made available to the provider.

       <u>Default</u> <u>provider</u> <u>and</u> <u>its</u> <u>activation</u>

       If  no  providers  are  activated  explicitly, either the default provider or FIPS provider are activated
       implicitly   depending   on   the   environment.     See    <b><a href="../man7/crypto.7.html">crypto</a></b>(7),    <b><a href="../man7/OSSL_PROVIDER-default.7.html">OSSL_PROVIDER-default</a></b>(7)    and
       <b><a href="../man7/OSSL_PROVIDER-FIPS.7.html">OSSL_PROVIDER-FIPS</a></b>(7) for more details.

       If  you  add  a section explicitly activating any other provider(s), you most probably need to explicitly
       activate the default or FIPS provider, otherwise it becomes unavailable  in  openssl.  It  may  make  the
       system remotely unavailable.

   <b>EVP</b> <b>Configuration</b>
       The  name  <b>alg_section</b>  in the initialization section names the section containing algorithmic properties
       when using the <b>EVP</b> API.

       Within the algorithm properties section, the following names have meaning:

       <b>default_properties</b>
           The   value   may   be   anything   that   is   acceptable   as   a   property   query   string   for
           <b>EVP_set_default_properties()</b>.

       <b>fips_mode</b> (deprecated)
           The value is a boolean that can be <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>.  If the value is <b>yes</b>, this is exactly equivalent to:

            default_properties = fips=yes

           If  the value is <b>no</b>, nothing happens. Using this name is deprecated, and if used, it must be the only
           name in the section.

   <b>SSL</b> <b>Configuration</b>
       The name <b>ssl_conf</b> in the initialization  section  names  the  section  containing  the  list  of  SSL/TLS
       configurations.   As  with  the  providers,  each  name  in  this  section  identifies a section with the
       configuration for that name. For example:

        [ssl_configuration]
        server = server_tls_config
        client = client_tls_config
        system_default = tls_system_default

        [server_tls_config]
        ... configuration for SSL/TLS servers ...

        [client_tls_config]
        ... configuration for SSL/TLS clients ...

       The configuration name <b>system_default</b> has a special meaning.  If it exists, it  is  applied  whenever  an
       <b>SSL_CTX</b> object is created.  For example, to impose system-wide minimum TLS and DTLS protocol versions:

        [tls_system_default]
        MinProtocol = TLSv1.2
        MinProtocol = DTLSv1.2

       The  minimum TLS protocol is applied to <b>SSL_CTX</b> objects that are TLS-based, and the minimum DTLS protocol
       to those are DTLS-based.  The same applies also to maximum versions set with <b>MaxProtocol</b>.

       Each configuration section consists of name/value pairs that are parsed by <b><a href="../man3/SSL_CONF_cmd.3.html">SSL_CONF_cmd</a>(3)</b>, which will be
       called by <b>SSL_CTX_config()</b> or <b>SSL_config()</b>, appropriately.  Note that any characters  before  an  initial
       dot  in  the configuration section are ignored, so that the same command can be used multiple times. This
       probably is most useful for loading different key types, as shown here:

        [server_tls_config]
        RSA.Certificate = server-rsa.pem
        ECDSA.Certificate = server-ecdsa.pem

   <b>Engine</b> <b>Configuration</b>
       The name <b>engines</b> in  the  initialization  section  names  the  section  containing  the  list  of  ENGINE
       configurations.   As  with  the  providers,  each  name  in  this  section  identifies an engine with the
       configuration for that engine.  The engine-specific section is used to specify how to  load  the  engine,
       activate it, and set other parameters.

       Within an engine section, the following names have meaning:

       <b>engine_id</b>
           This  is  used  to  specify  an  alternate name, overriding the default name specified in the list of
           engines. If present, it must be first.  For example:

            [engines]
            foo = foo_engine

            [foo_engine]
            engine_id = myfoo

       <b>dynamic_path</b>
           This loads and adds an ENGINE from the given path. It is equivalent to sending the ctrls <b>SO_PATH</b> with
           the path argument followed by <b>LIST_ADD</b> with value <b>2</b> and <b>LOAD</b> to the dynamic ENGINE.  If this  is  not
           the  required  behaviour then alternative ctrls can be sent directly to the dynamic ENGINE using ctrl
           commands.

       <b>init</b>
           This specifies whether to initialize  the  ENGINE.  If  the  value  is  <b>0</b>  the  ENGINE  will  not  be
           initialized,  if  the value is <b>1</b> an attempt is made to initialize the ENGINE immediately. If the <b>init</b>
           command is not present then an attempt will be made to initialize the ENGINE after  all  commands  in
           its section have been processed.

       <b>default_algorithms</b>
           This    sets    the    default    algorithms    an    ENGINE   will   supply   using   the   function
           <b>ENGINE_set_default_string()</b>.

       All other names are taken to be the name of a ctrl command that is sent to the ENGINE, and the  value  is
       the  argument  passed with the command.  The special value <b>EMPTY</b> means no value is sent with the command.
       For example:

        [engines]
        foo = foo_engine

        [foo_engine]
        dynamic_path = /some/path/fooengine.so
        some_ctrl = some_value
        default_algorithms = ALL
        other_ctrl = EMPTY

   <b>Random</b> <b>Configuration</b>
       The name <b>random</b> in the initialization section names the section containing the  random  number  generator
       settings.

       Within the random section, the following names have meaning:

       <b>random</b>
           This is used to specify the random bit generator.  For example:

            [random]
            random = CTR-DRBG

           The available random bit generators are:

           <b>CTR-DRBG</b>
           <b>HASH-DRBG</b>
           <b>HMAC-DRBG</b>
       <b>cipher</b>
           This  specifies  what  cipher  a <b>CTR-DRBG</b> random bit generator will use.  Other random bit generators
           ignore this name.  The default value is <b>AES-256-CTR</b>.

       <b>digest</b>
           This specifies what digest the <b>HASH-DRBG</b> or <b>HMAC-DRBG</b> random bit generators will use.   Other  random
           bit generators ignore this name.

       <b>properties</b>
           This  sets  the  property  query  used  when  fetching  the  random  bit generator and any underlying
           algorithms.

       <b>seed</b>
           This sets the randomness source that should be used.  By default <b>SEED-SRC</b> will be used outside of the
           FIPS provider.  The FIPS provider uses call backs to access the same randomness sources from  outside
           the validated boundary.

       <b>seed_properties</b>
           This sets the property query used when fetching the randomness source.

       <b>random_provider</b>
           This  sets  the  provider to use for the <b><a href="../man3/RAND_bytes.3.html">RAND_bytes</a></b>(3) calls instead of the built-in entropy sources.
           It defaults to "fips".  If the named provider is not loaded, the built-in  entropy  sources  will  be
           used.

</pre><h4><b>EXAMPLES</b></h4><pre>
       This example shows how to use quoting and escaping.

        # This is the default section.
        HOME = /temp
        configdir = $ENV::HOME/config

        [ section_one ]
        # Quotes permit leading and trailing whitespace
        any = " any variable name "
        other = A string that can \
        cover several lines \
        by including \\ characters
        message = Hello World\n

        [ section_two ]
        greeting = $section_one::message

       This example shows how to expand environment variables safely.  In this example, the variable <b>tempfile</b> is
       intended  to refer to a temporary file, and the environment variable <b>TEMP</b> or <b>TMP</b>, if present, specify the
       directory where the file should be put.  Since the default section is checked  if  a  variable  does  not
       exist, it is possible to set <b>TMP</b> to default to <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>, and <b>TEMP</b> to default to <b>TMP</b>.

        # These two lines must be in the default section.
        TMP = <a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a>
        TEMP = $ENV::TMP

        # This can be used anywhere
        tmpfile = ${ENV::TEMP}/tmp.filename

       This example shows how to enforce FIPS mode for the application <u>sample</u>.

        sample = fips_config

        [fips_config]
        alg_section = evp_properties

        [evp_properties]
        default_properties = "fips=yes"

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       <b>OPENSSL_CONF</b>
           The  path  to the config file, or the empty string for none.  Ignored in set-user-ID and set-group-ID
           programs.

       <b>OPENSSL_ENGINES</b>
           The path to the engines directory.  Ignored in set-user-ID and set-group-ID programs.

       <b>OPENSSL_MODULES</b>
           The path to the directory with OpenSSL modules, such as providers.  Ignored in set-user-ID  and  set-
           group-ID programs.

       <b>OPENSSL_CONF_INCLUDE</b>
           The optional path to prepend to all <b>.include</b> paths.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       There is no way to include characters using the octal <b>\nnn</b> form. Strings are all null terminated so nulls
       cannot form part of the value.

       The  escaping isn't quite right: if you want to use sequences like <b>\n</b> you can't use any quote escaping on
       the same line.

       The limit that only one directory can be opened and read at a time can be considered a bug and should  be
       fixed.

</pre><h4><b>HISTORY</b></h4><pre>
       An undocumented API, <b>NCONF_WIN32()</b>, used a slightly different set of parsing rules there were intended to
       be  tailored  to the Microsoft Windows platform.  Specifically, the backslash character was not an escape
       character and could be used in pathnames, only the double-quote character was  recognized,  and  comments
       began  with  a  semi-colon.  This function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0; applications with configuration
       files using that syntax will have to be modified.
