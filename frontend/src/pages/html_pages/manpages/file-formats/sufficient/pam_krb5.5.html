       pam_krb5 - Kerberos PAM module

</pre><h4><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h4><pre>
         auth            sufficient      pam_krb5.so minimum_uid=1000
         session         required        pam_krb5.so minimum_uid=1000
         account         required        pam_krb5.so minimum_uid=1000
         password        sufficient      pam_krb5.so minimum_uid=1000

</pre><h4><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h4><pre>
       The Kerberos service module for PAM, typically installed at <u>/lib/security/pam_krb5.so</u>, provides
       functionality for the four PAM operations: authentication, account management, session management, and
       password management.  <u>pam_krb5.so</u> is a shared object that is dynamically loaded by the PAM subsystem as
       necessary, based on the system PAM configuration.  PAM is a system for plugging in external
       authentication and session management modules so that each application doesn't have to know the best way
       to check user authentication or create a user session on that system.  For details on how to configure
       PAM on your system, see the PAM man page, often <b><a href="../man7/pam.7.html">pam</a></b>(7).

       Here are the actions of this module when called from each group:

       auth
           Provides implementations of <b>pam_authenticate()</b> and <b>pam_setcred()</b>.  The former takes the username from
           the  PAM  session,  prompts  for  the  user's  password  (unless configured to use an already-entered
           password), and then performs a Kerberos initial authentication, storing the obtained credentials  (if
           successful)  in  a  temporary  ticket  cache.   The latter, depending on the flags it is called with,
           either takes the contents of the temporary ticket cache and writes it  out  to  a  persistent  ticket
           cache owned by the user or uses the temporary ticket cache to refresh an existing user ticket cache.

           Passwords  as  long  or  longer than PAM_MAX_RESP_SIZE octets (normally 512 octets) will be rejected,
           since excessively long passwords can be used as a denial of service attack.

           After doing the initial authentication, the Kerberos PAM module will attempt to obtain tickets for  a
           key  in  the  local  system keytab and then verify those tickets.  Unless this step is performed, the
           authentication is vulnerable to KDC spoofing, but it requires that the system have a  local  key  and
           that  the  PAM  module be running as a user that can read the keytab file (normally <u>/etc/krb5.keytab</u>.
           You can point the Kerberos PAM module at a different keytab with the <u>keytab</u> option.  If  that  keytab
           cannot  be read or if no keys are found in it, the default (potentially insecure) behavior is to skip
           this check.  If you want to instead fail authentication if the obtained tickets  cannot  be  checked,
           set  "verify_ap_req_nofail"  to  true in the [libdefaults] section of <u>/etc/krb5.conf</u>.  Note that this
           will affect applications other than this PAM module.

           By default, whenever the user is authenticated, a basic authorization check will also be  done  using
           <b>krb5_kuserok()</b>.   The default behavior of this function is to check the user's account for a <u>.k5login</u>
           file and, if one is present, ensure that the user's principal is listed in that file.  If <u>.k5login</u> is
           not present, the default check is to ensure that the user's principal is in the default  local  realm
           and  the user portion of the principal matches the account name (this can be changed by configuring a
           custom aname to localname mapping in <u>krb5.conf</u>; see the Kerberos documentation  for  details).   This
           can be customized with several configuration options; see below.

           If  the  username  provided  to  PAM  contains  an  "@"  and Kerberos can, treating the username as a
           principal, map it to a local account name, <b>pam_authenticate()</b> will change the PAM user to that  local
           account  name.   This  allows  users  to log in with their Kerberos principal and let Kerberos do the
           mapping to an account.  This can be disabled with the <u>no_update_user</u> option.  Be aware, however, that
           this facility cannot be used with OpenSSH.  OpenSSH will reject  usernames  that  don't  match  local
           accounts before this remapping can be done and will pass an invalid password to the PAM module.  Also
           be  aware  that several other common PAM modules, such as pam_securetty, expect to be able to look up
           the user with <b>getpwnam()</b> and cannot be called before pam_krb5 when using this feature.

           When <b>pam_setcred()</b> is called to initialize a new ticket cache, the environment variable KRB5CCNAME is
           set to the path to that ticket cache.  By default, the cache  will  be  named  <u>/tmp/krb5cc_UID_RANDOM</u>
           where  UID  is the user's UID and RANDOM is six randomly-chosen letters.  This can be configured with
           the <u>ccache</u> and <u>ccache_dir</u> options.

           pam-krb5 does not use the default ticket cache location or  <u>default_cc_name</u>  in  the  "[libdefaults]"
           section  of  <u>krb5.conf</u>.   The default cache location would share a cache for all sessions of the same
           user, which causes confusing behavior when the user logs out of one of multiple sessions.

           If <b>pam_setcred()</b> initializes a new ticket cache, it will also set up that ticket  cache  so  that  it
           will  be  deleted  when the PAM session is closed.  Normally, the calling program (<b>login</b>, <b>sshd</b>, etc.)
           will run the user's shell as a sub-process, wait for it to exit, and  then  close  the  PAM  session,
           thereby cleaning up the user's session.

       session
           Provides implementations of <b>pam_open_session()</b>, which is equivalent to calling <b>pam_setcred()</b> with the
           PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED  flag,  and  <b>pam_close_session()</b>,  which  destroys  the  ticket  cache  created by
           <b>pam_setcred()</b>.

       account
           Provides an implementation of <b>pam_acct_mgmt()</b>.  All it does is do the  same  authorization  check  as
           performed by the <b>pam_authenticate()</b> implementation described above.

       password
           Provides  an  implementation  of  <b>pam_chauthtok()</b>,  which  implements  password changes.  The user is
           prompted for their existing password (unless configured to use an already entered one)  and  the  PAM
           module  then  obtains  credentials  for  the  special  Kerberos principal "kadmin/changepw".  It then
           prompts the user for a new password, twice to ensure that the user entered it properly (again, unless
           configured to use an already entered password), and then does a Kerberos password change.

           Passwords as long or longer than PAM_MAX_RESP_SIZE octets (normally 512  octets)  will  be  rejected,
           since excessively long passwords can be used as a denial of service attack.

           Unlike  the  normal  Unix password module, this module will allow any user to change any other user's
           password if they know the old password.  Also, unlike the normal  Unix  password  module,  root  will
           always  be  prompted  for the old password, since root has no special status in Kerberos.  (To change
           passwords in Kerberos without knowing the old password, use <b><a href="../man8/kadmin.8.html">kadmin</a></b>(8) instead.)

       Both the account and session management calls of the Kerberos PAM module will return PAM_IGNORE if called
       in the context of a PAM session for a user who did not authenticate  with  Kerberos  (a  return  code  of
       "ignore" in the Linux PAM configuration language).

       Note  that this module assumes the network is available in order to do a Kerberos authentication.  If the
       network is not available, some Kerberos libraries have timeouts longer than the timeout  imposed  by  the
       login  process.   This  means  that  using  this  module incautiously can make it impossible to log on to
       console as root.  For this reason, you should always use the <u>ignore_root</u> or <u>minimum_uid</u> options,  list  a
       local  authentication  module  such  as  <b>pam_unix</b>  first with a control field of "sufficient" so that the
       Kerberos PAM module will be skipped if local password authentication was successful.

       This is not the same PAM module as the Kerberos  PAM  module  available  from  Sourceforge,  or  the  one
       included  on  Red  Hat  systems.   It supports many of the same options, has some additional options, and
       doesn't support some of the options those modules do.

</pre><h4><b>CONFIGURATION</b></h4><pre>
       The Kerberos PAM module takes many options, not all of which are relevant to  every  PAM  group;  options
       that are not relevant will be silently ignored.  Any of these options can be set in the PAM configuration
       as  arguments  listed  after  "pam_krb5.so".  Some of the options can also be set in the system <u>krb5.conf</u>
       file; if this is possible, it will be noted below in the option description.

       To set a boolean option in the PAM configuration file, just give the name of the option in the arguments.
       To set an option that takes an argument, follow the option name with an equal sign  (=)  and  the  value,
       with no separating whitespace.  Whitespace in option arguments is not supported in the PAM configuration.

       To  set an option for the PAM module in the system <u>krb5.conf</u> file, put that option in the "[appdefaults]"
       section.  All options must be followed by an equal sign (=) and a value, so for boolean  options  add  "=
       true".   The  Kerberos  PAM  module  will look for options either at the top level of the "[appdefaults]"
       section or in a subsection named "pam", inside or outside a section for  the  realm.   For  example,  the
       following  fragment  of  a  <u>krb5.conf</u>  file  would  set <u>forwardable</u> to true, <u>minimum_uid</u> to 1000, and set
       <u>ignore_k5login</u> only if the realm is EXAMPLE.COM.

           [appdefaults]
               forwardable = true
               pam = {
                   minimum_uid = 1000
                   EXAMPLE.COM = {
                       ignore_k5login = true
                   }
               }

       For more information on the syntax of <u>krb5.conf</u>, see <b><a href="../man5/krb5.conf.5.html">krb5.conf</a></b>(5).  Note that options that depend on  the
       realm  will be set only on the basis of the default realm, either as configured in <b><a href="../man5/krb5.conf.5.html">krb5.conf</a></b>(5) or as set
       by the <u>realm</u> option described below.  If the user authenticates to an account  qualified  with  a  realm,
       that realm will not be used when determining which options will apply.

       There  is  no  difference  to the PAM module whether options are specified at the top level or in a "pam"
       section; the "pam" section is supported in case there are options that should be set for the  PAM  module
       but not for other applications.

       If  the  same option is set in <u>krb5.conf</u> and in the PAM configuration, the latter takes precedent.  Note,
       however, that due to the configuration syntax, there's no way to turn off a boolean  option  in  the  PAM
       configuration that was turned on in <u>krb5.conf</u>.

       The  start  of each option description is annotated with the version of pam-krb5 in which that option was
       added with the current meaning.

   <b>Authorization</b>
       alt_auth_map=&lt;format&gt;
           [3.12] This functions similarly to the <u>search_k5login</u> option.  The &lt;format&gt; argument is used  as  the
           authentication  Kerberos  principal,  with  any  %s  in  &lt;format&gt; replaced with the username.  If the
           username contains an "@", only the part of the username before the realm is used to replace  %s.   If
           &lt;format&gt;  contains  a  realm,  it will be used; otherwise, the realm of the username (if any) will be
           appended to the result.  There is no quote removal.

           If this option is present, the default behavior is to try this alternate  principal  first  and  then
           fall back to the standard behavior if it fails.  The primary usage is to allow alternative principals
           to be used for authentication in programs like <b>sudo</b>.  Most examples will look like:

               alt_auth_map=%s/root

           which  attempts  authentication as the root instance of the username first and then falls back to the
           regular username (but see <u>force_alt_auth</u> and <u>only_alt_auth</u>).

           This option also allows a cheap way to attempt authentication in an alternative realm first and  then
           fall back to the primary realm.  A setting like:

               alt_auth_map=%<a href="mailto:s@EXAMPLE.COM">s@EXAMPLE.COM</a>

           will  attempt  authentication  in the EXAMPLE.COM realm first and then fall back on the local default
           realm.  This is more convenient than running the module multiple times with multiple  default  realms
           set  with  <u>realm</u>,  but  it  is very limited: only two realms can be tried, and the alternate realm is
           always tried first.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u>, although normally it doesn't make sense to do
           that; normally it is used in the PAM options of configuration for  specific  programs.   It  is  only
           applicable  to the auth and account groups.  If this option is set for the auth group, be sure to set
           it for the account group as well or account authorization may fail.

       force_alt_auth
           [3.12] This option is used with <u>alt_auth_map</u> and forces authentication as  the  mapped  principal  if
           that  principal  exists  in the KDC.  Only if the KDC returns principal unknown does the Kerberos PAM
           module fall back to normal authentication.   This  can  be  used  to  force  authentication  with  an
           alternate instance.  If <u>alt_auth_map</u> is not set, it has no effect.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the auth group.

       ignore_k5login
           [2.0]  Never  look  for  a  <u>.k5login</u> file in the user's home directory.  Instead, only check that the
           Kerberos principal maps to the local account name.  The default check is to ensure the realm  matches
           the local realm and the user portion of the principal matches the local account name, but this can be
           customized by setting up an aname to localname mapping in <u>krb5.conf</u>.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the auth and account
           groups.

       ignore_root
           [1.1]  Do  not  do  anything  if  the username is "root".  The authentication and password calls will
           silently fail (allowing that status to be ignored via a control of "optional" or  "sufficient"),  and
           the account and session calls (including pam_setcred) will return PAM_IGNORE, telling the PAM library
           to  proceed as if they weren't mentioned in the PAM configuration.  This option is supported and will
           remain, but normally you want to use <u>minimum_uid</u> instead.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u>.

       minimum_uid=&lt;uid&gt;
           [2.0] Do not do anything if the authenticated account name corresponds to a local  account  and  that
           local  account  has a UID lower than &lt;uid&gt;.  If both of those conditions are true, the authentication
           and password calls will silently fail (allowing that status to be ignored via a control of "optional"
           or "sufficient"), and the account and session calls (including pam_setcred) will  return  PAM_IGNORE,
           telling the PAM library to proceed as if they weren't mentioned in the PAM configuration.

           Using  this  option  is highly recommended if you don't need to use Kerberos to authenticate password
           logins to the root account (which isn't recommended since Kerberos requires  a  network  connection).
           It  provides  some  defense  in  depth  against user principals that happen to match a system account
           incorrectly authenticating as that system account.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u>.

       only_alt_auth
           [3.12] This option is used with  <u>alt_auth_map</u>  and  forces  the  use  of  the  mapped  principal  for
           authentication.    It  disables  fallback  to  normal  authentication  in  all  cases  and  overrides
           <u>search_k5login</u> and <u>force_alt_auth</u>.  If <u>alt_auth_map</u> is not set, it has no  effect  and  the  standard
           authentication behavior is used.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the auth group.

       search_k5login
           [2.0]  Normally,  the  Kerberos implementation of pam_authenticate attempts to obtain tickets for the
           authenticating username in the local realm.  If this option is set and the local user has a  <u>.k5login</u>
           file in their home directory, the module will instead open and read that <u>.k5login</u> file, attempting to
           use  the  supplied  password to authenticate as each principal listed there in turn.  If any of those
           authentications succeed, the user will be successfully authenticated; otherwise, authentication  will
           fail.   This  option is useful for allowing password authentication (via console or <b>sshd</b> without GSS-
           API support) to shared accounts.  If there is no <u>.k5login</u> file, the behavior is the same  as  normal.
           Using this option requires that the user's <u>.k5login</u> file be readable at the time of authentication.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the auth group.

   <b>Kerberos</b> <b>Behavior</b>
       anon_fast
           [4.6]  Attempt  to use Flexible Authentication Secure Tunneling (FAST) by first authenticating as the
           anonymous user (WELLKNOWN/ANONYMOUS) and using its credentials as  the  FAST  armor.   This  requires
           anonymous  PKINIT  be enabled for the local realm, that PKINIT be configured on the local system, and
           that the Kerberos library support FAST and anonymous PKINIT.

           FAST is a mechanism to protect Kerberos against password guessing attacks and provide other  security
           improvements.   To  work,  FAST  requires  that  a  ticket  be  obtained with a strong key to protect
           exchanges with potentially weaker user passwords.   This  option  uses  anonymous  authentication  to
           obtain that key and then uses it to protect the subsequent authentication.

           If  anonymous  PKINIT  is  not  available or fails, FAST will not be used and the authentication will
           proceed as normal.

           To instead use an existing ticket cache for the FAST credentials, use  <u>fast_ccache</u>  instead  of  this
           option.   If  both  <u>fast_ccache</u>  and <u>anon_fast</u> are set, the ticket cache named by <u>fast_ccache</u> will be
           tried first, and the Kerberos PAM module will fall back on attempting anonymous PKINIT if that  cache
           could not be used.

           This  option  can  be  set  in  "[appdefaults]"  in  <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the auth and
           password groups.

           The operation is the same as if using the <u>fast_ccache</u> option, but the cache is created and  destroyed
           automatically.   If  both <u>fast_ccache</u> and <u>anon_fast</u> options are used, the <u>fast_ccache</u> takes precedent
           and no anonymous authentication is done.

       fast_ccache=&lt;ccache_name&gt;
           [4.3] The same as <u>anon_fast</u>, but use an existing Kerberos ticket cache rather than anonymous  PKINIT.
           This  allows  use  of  FAST  with  a  realm  that doesn't support PKINIT or doesn't support anonymous
           authentication.

           &lt;ccache_name&gt; should be a credential cache containing a ticket obtained using a strong key,  such  as
           the randomized key for the host principal of the local system.  If &lt;ccache_name&gt; names a ticket cache
           that  is  readable  by  the  authenticating process and has tickets then FAST will be attempted.  The
           easiest way to use this option is to use a program like <b>k5start</b> to maintain a ticket cache using  the
           host's  keytab.   This ticket cache should normally only be readable by root, so this option will not
           be able to protect authentications done as non-root users (such as screensavers).

           If no credentials are present in the ticket cache, or if the ticket cache does not exist  or  is  not
           readable,  FAST will not used and authentication will proceed as normal.  However, if the credentials
           in that ticket cache are expired, authentication will fail if the KDC supports FAST.

           To use anonymous PKINIT to protect the FAST exchange, use the <u>anon_fast</u> option instead.  <u>anon_fast</u> is
           easier to configure, since no existing ticket cache is required, but requires PKINIT be available and
           configured and that the local realm  support  anonymous  authentication.   If  both  <u>fast_ccache</u>  and
           <u>anon_fast</u>  are  set,  the ticket cache named by <u>fast_ccache</u> will be tried first, and the Kerberos PAM
           module will fall back on attempting anonymous PKINIT if that cache could not be used.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u>  and  is  only  applicable  to  the  auth  and
           password groups.

       forwardable
           [1.0]  Obtain  forwardable  tickets.  If set (to either true or false, although it can only be set to
           false in <u>krb5.conf</u>), this overrides the Kerberos library default set in the [libdefaults] section  of
           <u>krb5.conf</u>.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the auth group.

       keytab=&lt;path&gt;
           [3.0] Specifies the keytab to use when validating the user's credentials.  The default is the default
           system  keytab (normally <u>/etc/krb5.keytab</u>), which is usually only readable by root.  Applications not
           running as root that use this PAM module for authentication may wish to point it  to  another  keytab
           the  application can read.  The first principal found in the keytab will be used as the principal for
           credential verification.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the auth group.

       realm=&lt;realm&gt;
           [2.2] Set the default Kerberos realm and obtain credentials in that realm, rather than in the  normal
           default  realm  for  this system.  If this option is used, it should be set for all groups being used
           for consistent results.  This setting will  affect  authorization  decisions  since  it  changes  the
           default  realm.   This  setting  will  also  change the service principal used to verify the obtained
           credentials to be in the specified realm.

           If you only want to set the realm  assumed  for  user  principals  without  changing  the  realm  for
           authorization  decisions  or  the  service  principal  used to verify credentials, see the <u>user_realm</u>
           option.

       renew_lifetime=&lt;lifetime&gt;
           [2.0] Obtain renewable tickets with a maximum renewable lifetime of &lt;lifetime&gt;.  &lt;lifetime&gt; should be
           a Kerberos lifetime string such as "2d4h10m" or a time  in  minutes.   If  set,  this  overrides  the
           Kerberos library default set in the [libdefaults] section of <u>krb5.conf</u>.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the auth group.

       ticket_lifetime=&lt;lifetime&gt;
           [3.0] Obtain tickets with a maximum lifetime of &lt;lifetime&gt;.  &lt;lifetime&gt; should be a Kerberos lifetime
           string  such  as "2d4h10m" or a time in minutes.  If set, this overrides the Kerberos library default
           set in the [libdefaults] section of <u>krb5.conf</u>.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the auth group.

       user_realm
           [4.6] Obtain credentials in the specified realm rather than in the default realm for this system.  If
           this option is used, it should be set for all groups being used for consistent results (although  the
           account group currently doesn't care about realm).  This will not change authorization decisions.  If
           the  obtained  credentials  are  supposed  to  allow access to a shell account, the user will need an
           appropriate <u>.k5login</u> file entry or the system will have to have a custom aname_to_localname mapping.

   <b>PAM</b> <b>Behavior</b>
       clear_on_fail
           [3.9] When changing passwords, PAM first does a  preliminary  check  through  the  complete  password
           stack, and then calls each module again to do the password change.  After that preliminary check, the
           order  of module invocation is fixed.  This means that even if the Kerberos password change fails (or
           if one of the other password changes in the stack fails), other password PAM  modules  in  the  stack
           will still be called even if the failing module is marked required or requisite.  When using multiple
           password  PAM  modules  to  synchronize  passwords  between  multiple  systems when they change, this
           behavior can cause unwanted differences between the environments.

           Setting this option provides a way to work around this  behavior.   If  this  option  is  set  and  a
           Kerberos  password change is attempted and fails (due to network errors or password strength checking
           on the KDC, for example), this module will clear the stored password in the  PAM  stack.   This  will
           force  any  subsequent modules that have <u>use_authtok</u> set to fail so that those environments won't get
           out of sync with the password in Kerberos.  The Kerberos PAM module will not meddle with  the  stored
           password if it skips the user due to configuration such as minimum_uid.

           Unfortunately,  setting  this  option  interferes  with  other  desirable PAM configurations, such as
           attempting to change the password in Kerberos first and falling  back  on  the  local  Unix  password
           database  if  that fails.  It therefore isn't the default.  Turn it on (and list pam_krb5 first after
           pam_cracklib if used) when synchronizing passwords between multiple environments.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the password group.

       debug
           [1.0] Log more verbose trace and debugging information to syslog  at  LOG_DEBUG  priority,  including
           entry and exit from each of the external PAM interfaces (except pam_close_session).

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u>.

       defer_pwchange
           [3.11]  By  default,  pam-krb5 lets the Kerberos library handle prompting for a password change if an
           account's password is expired during the auth group.  If this fails,  <b>pam_authenticate()</b>  returns  an
           error.

           According  to  the  PAM  standard, this is not the correct way to handle expired passwords.  Instead,
           <b>pam_authenticate()</b>  should  return  success  without  attempting  a   password   change,   and   then
           <b>pam_acct_mgmt()</b>  should  return  PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD,  at  which  point  the  calling application is
           responsible for either rejecting the authentication or calling <b>pam_chauthtok()</b>.   However,  following
           the  standard  requires  that  all  applications  call  <b>pam_acct_mgmt()</b>  and check its return status;
           otherwise, expired accounts may be able to successfully authenticate.  Many applications  do  not  do
           this.

           If  this  option  is set, pam-krb5 uses the fully correct PAM mechanism for handling expired accounts
           instead  of  failing  in  <b>pam_authenticate()</b>.   Due  to  the  security  risk  of  widespread   broken
           applications,  be  very  careful about enabling this option.  It should normally only be turned on to
           solve a specific problem (such as using Solaris Kerberos libraries that don't support  prompting  for
           password  changes  during  authentication),  and  then  only  for specific applications known to call
           <b>pam_acct_mgmt()</b> and check its return status properly.

           This option is only supported when pam-krb5 is built with MIT Kerberos.  If  built  against  Heimdal,
           this  option  does  nothing  and  normal expired password change handling still happens.  (Heimdal is
           missing the required API to implement this option, at least as of version 1.6.)

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the auth group.

       fail_pwchange
           [4.2] By default, pam-krb5 lets the Kerberos library handle prompting for a  password  change  if  an
           account's  password  is  expired during the auth group.  If this option is set, expired passwords are
           instead treated  as  an  authentication  failure  identical  to  an  incorrect  password.   Also  see
           <u>defer_pwchange</u> and <u>force_pwchange</u>.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the auth group.

       force_pwchange
           [3.11]  If  this  option  is set and authentication fails with a Kerberos error indicating the user's
           password is expired, attempt to immediately change  their  password  during  the  authenticate  step.
           Under  normal  circumstances, this is unnecessary.  Most Kerberos libraries will do this for you, and
           setting this option will prompt the user twice to change their password if the first attempt (done by
           the Kerberos library) fails.  However, some  system  Kerberos  libraries  (such  as  Solaris's)  have
           password change prompting disabled in the Kerberos library; on those systems, you can set this option
           to simulate the normal library behavior.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the auth group.

       no_update_user
           [4.7]  Normally,  if  pam-krb5  is  able  to  canonicalize  the  principal  to  a  local  name  using
           <b>krb5_aname_to_localname()</b> or similar calls, it changes the PAM_USER variable for this PAM session  to
           the  canonicalized local name.  Setting this option disables this behavior and leaves PAM_USER set to
           the initial authentication identity.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the auth group.

       silent
           [1.0] Don't show messages and errors from Kerberos, such as warnings of expiring  passwords,  to  the
           user via the prompter.  This is equivalent to the behavior when the application passes in PAM_SILENT,
           but can be set in the PAM configuration.

           This option is only applicable to the auth and password groups.

       trace=&lt;log-file&gt;
           [4.6]  Enables  Kerberos  library  trace  logging to the specified log file if it is supported by the
           Kerberos library.  This is intended for temporary debugging.  The specified file will be appended  to
           without further security checks, so do not specify a file in a publicly writable directory like <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>.

   <b>PKINIT</b>
       pkinit_anchors=&lt;anchors&gt;
           [3.0]  When doing PKINIT authentication, use &lt;anchors&gt; as the client trust anchors.  This is normally
           a reference to a file containing the trusted certificate authorities.  This option is  only  used  if
           <u>try_pkinit</u> or <u>use_pkinit</u> are set.

           This  option  can  be  set  in  "[appdefaults]"  in  <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the auth and
           password groups.

       pkinit_prompt
           [3.0] Before attempting PKINIT authentication, prompt the user to insert a smart card.  You may  want
           to  set  this  option  for  programs  such as <b>gnome-screensaver</b> that call PAM as soon as the mouse is
           touched and don't give the user an opportunity to  enter  the  smart  card  first.   Any  information
           entered  at  the  first prompt is ignored.  If <u>try_pkinit</u> is set, a user who wishes to use a password
           instead can just press Enter and then enter their password as normal.  This option is  only  used  if
           <u>try_pkinit</u> or <u>use_pkinit</u> are set.

           This  option  can  be  set  in  "[appdefaults]"  in  <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the auth and
           password groups.

       pkinit_user=&lt;userid&gt;
           [3.0] When doing PKINIT authentication, use &lt;userid&gt; as the user ID.  The value  of  this  string  is
           highly  dependent  on the type of PKINIT implementation you're using, but will generally be something
           like:

               PKCS11:/usr/lib/pkcs11/lib/soft-pkcs11.so

           to specify the module to use with a smart card.  It may also point to a user certificate or to  other
           types  of  user  IDs.   See the Kerberos library documentation for more details.  This option is only
           used if <u>try_pkinit</u> or <u>use_pkinit</u> are set.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u>  and  is  only  applicable  to  the  auth  and
           password groups.

       preauth_opt=&lt;option&gt;
           [3.3]  Sets  a  preauth option (currently only applicable when built with MIT Kerberos).  &lt;option&gt; is
           either a key/value pair with the key separated from the value by "=" or a boolean  option  (in  which
           case  it's turned on).  In <u>krb5.conf</u>, multiple options should be separated by whitespace.  In the PAM
           configuration, this option can be given multiple times to set  multiple  options.   In  either  case,
           &lt;option&gt; may not contain whitespace.

           The  primary  use  of  this  option,  at least in the near future, will be to set options for the MIT
           Kerberos PKINIT support.  For the full list of possible options, see the PKINIT plugin documentation.
           At the time of this writing, "X509_user_identity" is equivalent to <u>pkinit_user</u> and "X509_anchors"  is
           equivalent to <u>pkinit_anchors</u>.  "flag_DSA_PROTOCOL" can only be set via this option.

           Any  settings  made with this option are applied after the <u>pkinit_anchors</u> and <u>pkinit_user</u> options, so
           if an equivalent setting is made via <u>preauth_opt</u>, it will probably override the other setting.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u>  and  is  only  applicable  to  the  auth  and
           password  groups.   Note  that  there  is  no way to remove a setting made in <u>krb5.conf</u> using the PAM
           configuration, but options set in the PAM configuration are applied after options  set  in  <u>krb5.conf</u>
           and therefore may override earlier settings.

       try_pkinit
           [3.0] Attempt PKINIT authentication before trying a regular password.  You will probably also need to
           set  the <u>pkinit_user</u> configuration option.  If PKINIT fails, the PAM module will fall back on regular
           password authentication.  This option is currently only  supported  if  pam-krb5  was  built  against
           Heimdal 0.8rc1 or later or MIT Kerberos 1.6.3 or later.

           If  this  option  is  set and pam-krb5 is built against MIT Kerberos, and PKINIT fails and the module
           falls back to password authentication, the user's password will not be stored in the  PAM  stack  for
           subsequent  modules.   This  is  a  bug  in  the interaction between the module and MIT Kerberos that
           requires some reworking of the PKINIT authentication method to fix.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u>  and  is  only  applicable  to  the  auth  and
           password groups.

       use_pkinit
           [3.0,  4.9  for  MIT Kerberos] Require PKINIT authentication.  You will probably also need to set the
           <u>pkinit_user</u> configuration option.  If PKINIT fails, authentication will fail.  This  option  is  only
           supported if pam-krb5 was built against Heimdal 0.8rc1 or later or MIT Kerberos 1.12 or later.

           Be aware that, with MIT Kerberos, this option is implemented by using a responder without a prompter,
           and thus any informational messages from the Kerberos libraries or KDC during authentication will not
           be displayed.

           This  option  can  be  set  in  "[appdefaults]"  in  <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the auth and
           password groups.

   <b>Prompting</b>
       banner=&lt;banner&gt;
           [3.0] By default, the prompts when a user changes their password are:

               Current Kerberos password:
               Enter new Kerberos password:
               Retype new Kerberos password:

           The string "Kerberos" is inserted  so  that  users  aren't  confused  about  which  password  they're
           changing.   Setting  this  option  replaces  the word "Kerberos" with whatever this option is set to.
           Setting this option to the empty string removes the word before "password:" entirely.

           If set in the PAM configuration, &lt;banner&gt; may not contain whitespace.  If you want a value containing
           whitespace, set it in <u>krb5.conf</u>.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the password group.

       expose_account
           [3.0] By default, the Kerberos PAM module password prompt is simply "Password:".  This avoids leaking
           any information about the system realm or account to principal conversions.  If this option  is  set,
           the  string  "for  &lt;principal&gt;" is added before the colon, where &lt;principal&gt; is the user's principal.
           This string is also added before the colon on prompts when changing the user's password.

           Enabling this option with ChallengeResponseAuthentication enabled in OpenSSH may cause  problems  for
           some  ssh clients that only recognize "Password:" as a prompt.  This option is automatically disabled
           if <u>search_k5login</u> is enabled since the principal displayed would be inaccurate.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u>  and  is  only  applicable  to  the  auth  and
           password groups.

       force_first_pass
           [4.0]  Use  the password obtained by a previous authentication or password module to authenticate the
           user without prompting the user again.  If no previous module  obtained  the  user's  password,  fail
           without  prompting  the user.  Also see <u>try_first_pass</u> and <u>use_first_pass</u> for weaker versions of this
           option.

           This option is only applicable to the auth and password groups.  For the password group,  it  applies
           only to the old password.  See <u>use_authtok</u> for a similar setting for the new password.

       no_prompt
           [4.6]  Never  prompt  for  the  current  password.   Instead, pass in a NULL password to the Kerberos
           library and let the Kerberos library do the prompting.  This may  be  needed  if,  for  example,  the
           Kerberos  library  is configured to use other authentication mechanisms than passwords and needs full
           control over the prompting process.

           The major disadvantage of this option is that it means the PAM  module  will  never  see  the  user's
           password  and  therefore  cannot save it in the PAM module data for any subsequent modules.  In other
           words, this option cannot be used if another module is in the stack behind the  Kerberos  PAM  module
           and  wants  to  use  <u>use_first_pass</u>.  The Kerberos library also usually includes the principal in the
           prompt,  and  therefore  this  option  implies  behavior  similar  to  <u>expose_account</u>.   Similar   to
           <u>expose_account</u>,  this  can cause problems with OpenSSH if ChallengeResponseAuthentication is enabled,
           since clients may not recognize password prompts other than "Password:".

           Using this option with <u>search_k5login</u> would result in a password prompt for every principal listed in
           the user's <u>.k5login</u> file.  This is probably not desired behavior, although it's not prohibited by the
           module.

           This option is only applicable to the auth and password groups.  For the password group,  it  applies
           only to the authentication process; the user will still be prompted for a new password.

       prompt_principal
           [3.6]  Before  prompting  for  the  user's  password  (or  using  the previously entered password, if
           <u>try_first_pass</u>, <u>use_first_pass</u>, or <u>force_first_pass</u> are  set),  prompt  the  user  for  the  Kerberos
           principal to use for authentication.  This allows the user to authenticate with a different principal
           than  the  one  corresponding  to  the  local username, provided that either a <u>.k5login</u> file or local
           Kerberos principal to account mapping authorize that principal to access the local account.

           Be  cautious   when   using   this   configuration   option   and   don't   use   it   with   OpenSSH
           PasswordAuthentication,  only  ChallengeResponseAuthentication.  Some PAM-enabled applications expect
           PAM modules to only prompt for passwords and may even blindly give the password to the first  prompt,
           no  matter  what  it  is.   Such applications, in combination with this option, may expose the user's
           password in log messages and Kerberos requests.

       try_first_pass
           [1.0] If the authentication module isn't the first on the stack, and a previous module  obtained  the
           user's  password,  use  that password to authenticate the user without prompting them again.  If that
           authentication fails, fall back on prompting the user for their password.  This option has no  effect
           if  the  authentication  module  is  first  in the stack or if no previous module obtained the user's
           password.  Also see <u>use_first_pass</u> and <u>force_first_pass</u> for stronger versions of this option.

           This option is only applicable to the auth and password groups.  For the password group,  it  applies
           only to the old password.

       use_authtok
           [4.0] Use the new password obtained by a previous password module when changing passwords rather than
           prompting  for  the  new  password.   If the new password isn't available, fail.  This can be used to
           require passwords be checked by another, prior module, such as <b>pam_cracklib</b>.

           This option is only applicable to the password group.

       use_first_pass
           [1.0] Use the password obtained by a previous authentication module to authenticate the user  without
           prompting  the  user  again.   If  no  previous  module  obtained  the  user's password for either an
           authentication or password change, fall back on prompting the user.  If a previous module did  obtain
           the  user's  password but authentication with that password fails, fail without further prompting the
           user.  Also see <u>try_first_pass</u> and <u>force_first_pass</u> for other versions of this option.

           This option is only applicable to the auth and password groups.  For the password group,  it  applies
           only to the old password.  See <u>use_authtok</u> for a similar setting for the new password.

   <b>Ticket</b> <b>Caches</b>
       ccache=&lt;pattern&gt;
           [2.0]  Use  &lt;pattern&gt;  as  the pattern for creating credential cache names.  &lt;pattern&gt; must be in the
           form &lt;type&gt;:&lt;residual&gt; where &lt;type&gt; and the following colon are optional if a file  cache  should  be
           used.   The  special  token  %u, anywhere in &lt;pattern&gt;, is replaced with the user's numeric UID.  The
           special token %p, anywhere in &lt;pattern&gt;, is replaced with the current process ID.

           If &lt;pattern&gt; ends in the literal string "XXXXXX" (six X's), that string will be replaced by  randomly
           generated  characters  and  the  ticket  cache  will  be  created using <b><a href="../man3/mkstemp.3.html">mkstemp</a></b>(3).  This is strongly
           recommended if &lt;pattern&gt; points to a world-writable directory.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the auth and session
           groups.

       ccache_dir=&lt;directory&gt;
           [1.2] Store both the temporary ticket cache used during authentication  and  user  ticket  caches  in
           &lt;directory&gt;  instead  of  in  <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>.   The algorithm for generating the ticket cache name is otherwise
           unchanged.  &lt;directory&gt; may be prefixed with "FILE:" to make the cache type unambiguous (and this may
           be required on systems that use a cache type other than file as the default).

           Be aware that pam_krb5 creates and stores a temporary ticket cache file  owned  by  root  during  the
           login  process.   If  you  set  <u>ccache</u> above to avoid using the system <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> directory for user ticket
           caches, you may also want to set <u>ccache_dir</u> to move those temporary caches to  some  other  location.
           This will allow pam_krb5 to continue working even if the system <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u> directory is full.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the auth and session
           groups.

       no_ccache
           [1.0]  Do  not  create a ticket cache after authentication.  This option shouldn't be set in general,
           but is useful as part  of  the  PAM  configuration  for  a  particular  service  that  uses  PAM  for
           authentication  but  isn't  creating  user sessions and doesn't want the overhead of ever writing the
           user  credentials  to  disk.   When  using  this   option,   the   application   should   only   call
           <b>pam_authenticate()</b>;  other  functions  like  <b>pam_setcred()</b>,  <b>pam_start_session()</b>, and <b>pam_acct_mgmt()</b>
           don't make sense with this option.  Don't use this option if the application needs  PAM  account  and
           session management calls.

           This option is only applicable to the auth group.

       retain_after_close
           [2.3]  Normally, the user's ticket cache is destroyed when either <b>pam_end()</b> or <b>pam_close_session()</b> is
           called by the authenticating application so that ticket caches aren't left behind after the user logs
           out.  In some cases, however, this isn't  desirable.   (On  Solaris  8,  for  instance,  the  default
           behavior  means login will destroy the ticket cache before running the user's shell.)  If this option
           is set, the PAM module will never destroy the user's ticket cache.  If you set this, you may want  to
           call  <b>kdestroy</b>  in  the shell's logout configuration or run a temporary file removal program to avoid
           accumulating hundreds of ticket caches in <u><a href="file:/tmp">/tmp</a></u>.

           This option can be set in "[appdefaults]" in <u>krb5.conf</u> and is only applicable to the auth and session
           groups.

</pre><h4><b>ENVIRONMENT</b></h4><pre>
       KRB5CCNAME
           Set by <b>pam_setcred()</b> with the PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED option, and therefore also by <b>pam_open_session()</b>, to
           point to the new credential cache for the user.  See the <u>ccache</u> and <u>ccache_dir</u> options.  By  default,
           the cache name will be prefixed with "FILE:" to make the cache type unambiguous.

       PAM_KRB5CCNAME
           Set  by <b>pam_authenticate()</b> to point to the temporary ticket cache used for authentication (unless the
           <u>no_ccache</u> option was given).  <b>pam_setcred()</b>  then  uses  that  environment  variable  to  locate  the
           temporary  cache  even  if it was not called in the same PAM session as <b>pam_authenticate()</b> (a problem
           with <b>sshd</b> running in some modes).  This environment variable is only used internal to the PAM module.

</pre><h4><b>FILES</b></h4><pre>
       <u>/tmp/krb5cc_UID_RANDOM</u>
           The default credential cache name.  UID is the decimal UID of the local user and RANDOM is  a  random
           six-character  string.   The pattern may be changed with the <u>ccache</u> option and the directory with the
           <u>ccache_dir</u> option.

       <u>/tmp/krb5cc_pam_RANDOM</u>
           The credential cache name used for the temporary  credential  cache  created  by  <b>pam_authenticate()</b>.
           This  cache  is  removed again when the PAM session is ended or when <b>pam_setcred()</b> is called and will
           normally not be user-visible.  RANDOM is a random six-character string.

       <u><a href="file:~/.k5login">~/.k5login</a></u>
           File containing Kerberos principals that are allowed access to that account.

</pre><h4><b>BUGS</b></h4><pre>
       If <u>try_pkinit</u> is set and pam-krb5 is built with MIT Kerberos, the user's password is not saved in the PAM
       data if PKINIT fails and the module falls back to password authentication.

</pre><h4><b>CAVEATS</b></h4><pre>
       Be sure to list this module in the session group as well as the auth group when using it for  interactive
       logins.   Otherwise,  some  applications  (such  as  OpenSSH)  will  not  set  up the user's ticket cache
       correctly.

       The Kerberos library, via pam-krb5, will prompt the user to change their password if  their  password  is
       expired,  but  when  using  OpenSSH, this will only work when ChallengeResponseAuthentication is enabled.
       Unless this option is enabled, OpenSSH doesn't pass PAM messages to the user and can only  respond  to  a
       simple password prompt.

       If  you  are  using MIT Kerberos, be aware that users whose passwords are expired will not be prompted to
       change their password unless the KDC configuration for your realm in [realms]  in  krb5.conf  contains  a
       master_kdc  setting  or,  if  using DNS SRV records, you have a DNS entry for _kerberos-master as well as
       _kerberos.

       <b>pam_authenticate()</b> returns failure when called for an ignored account, requiring the system administrator
       to use "optional" or "sufficient" to ignore the module and move on to the  next  module.   It's  arguably
       more  correct  to  return  PAM_IGNORE,  which  causes  the  module  to be ignored as if it weren't in the
       configuration, but this increases the risk of inadvertent security holes when  listing  pam-krb5  as  the
       only authentication module.

       This  module  treats  the  empty password as an authentication failure rather than attempting to use that
       password to avoid unwanted prompting behavior  in  the  Kerberos  libraries.   If  you  have  a  Kerberos
       principal that intentionally has an empty password, it won't work with this module.

       This  module  will  not refresh an existing ticket cache if called with an effective UID or GID different
       than the real UID or GID, since refreshing an existing ticket  cache  requires  trusting  the  KRB5CCNAME
       environment variable and the environment should not be trusted in a setuid context.

       Old versions of OpenSSH are known to call pam_authenticate followed by pam_setcred(PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED)
       without  first  calling  pam_open_session,  thereby  requesting  that an existing ticket cache be renewed
       (similar to what a screensaver would want) rather than requesting a new ticket cache be  created.   Since
       this behavior is indistinguishable at the PAM level from a screensaver, pam-krb5 when used with these old
       versions  of  OpenSSH  will  refresh  the ticket cache of the OpenSSH daemon rather than setting up a new
       ticket cache for the user.  The resulting ticket cache will have the correct permissions, but will not be
       named correctly or referenced in the user's environment and will be overwritten by the next  user  login.
       The  best  solution  to  this  problem is to upgrade OpenSSH.  I'm not sure exactly when this problem was
       fixed, but at the very least OpenSSH 4.3 and later do not exhibit it.
